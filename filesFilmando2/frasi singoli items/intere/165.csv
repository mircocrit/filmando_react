1;Well some people found the storyline too confusing, but after seeing this film in theaters, I was convinced it is one of the best films of the year.
2;It's a pretty long movie with an awesome plot.
3;The storyline keeps you guessing, and even when you think it's over, it's not.
4;It's definetly a rush, and will keep you intensed until the very end.
5;I recommend this product to it's fullest
6;prosecuted innocent for a system that works most of the time?
7;But not all of it?In working out this plot via some of the wittiest screenplay to come along in a while and one or two superb chase scenes, the movie entertains and provokes.
8;colin Farrel threatens to outshine Cruise, but both do their job well.
9;But promising of a very enjoyable *once*.
10;fi thriller that poses the question, if you haven't commited a crime yet, how can you be charged for it.
11;This sends him on a tale that'll change his life.
12;Well crafted, beautiful, and a fun ride as well.
13;Steven Spielberg crafts yet another wonderful movie to watch.
14;The film was so excellently executed, and this film MORE than makes up for Steven Spielberg's sci.
15;'Minority Report' is a fascinating excursion into the future, 2054 to be exact, where pre.
16;be prepared for an entertaining adventure that boasts not only wonderful special effects, but a lot to think about as well.
17;A respectable attempt, tainted by clean sets and clean clothes and clean actors.
18;Tom Cruises futuristic thriller Minority Report is absolutely fantastic.
19;the murder rate drops to 0 and the system is perfect.
20;well one day tom cruise gets his name as a would be murderer and decides to buck the system.
21;this is his best work ever though.
22;tom cruise does a great job in this one.
23;this is a very good movie all in all but the hype makes it sound better.
24;this is tom cruises 2nd best movie.
25;A couple scenes showed real promise, but all in all.
26;This is an excellent movie.
27;Tom Cruise has proven to be an incredible actor over the years.
28;He shows an incredible versatility in his acting.
29;Still, nothing will ever top `Blade Runner'.
30;It would be paradoxical with respect to our time, for time travelers to have moved from any time ahead of us to an earlier time ahead of us on through to times behind us.
31;i liked the realism of this film, real in how it has a built.
32;It would have access to a lot of government developed and spy agency utilized memory affecting drugs, compounds etc.
33;crime is a most interesting judicial concept.
34;There is a protective mechanism that helps the mind to block early developmental traumas.
35;should have been a winning combination.
36;Spielberg has brought us some of the greatest movies (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Close Encounters), and it is safe to say that he is one of contemporary America's greatest filmmakers (certainly one of the most influential), but with Minority Report he failed to reach the greatness found in his previous movies.
37;Tom Cruise is one of our biggest box office draws, and with good reason, he's a great actor.
38;And Philip Dick is one of our greatest science fiction writers.
39;This movie could have been so much, great writer, great actor, great director, but in the end, it simply fizzles.
40;And we, of course, have the obligatory happy Spielberg ending.
41;I'm not saying it's the best movie ever, but if you're looking for a way to pass a lazy evening, this'll keep you way happy.
42;There's enough plot twists and action scenes to keep anyone happy.
43;Minority Report is definitely one of the year's best movies!
44;Cruise is a good actor and this movie is a must.
45;It's a fast very creative movie.
46;Spielberg has a great visual imagination!
47;It's very entertaining and thought provoking.
48;It's a delightful movie with great graphics.
49;The whole cast did a great job as well as the crew.
50;It's deserves the raving reviews and the 100 millions it has received on the box.
51;It's something for all Spielberg and Lucas film fans.
52;The film is pretty futuristic and makes you wonder.
53;It's dazzles the mid and the action sequences are award.
54;It's something that'll be remembered as a great sci.
55;Precrime is a program that uses the vision of psychics to put the future killers behind bars before they've done anything.
56;John Anderton (played by Tom Cruise) is a Precrime enforcer who believes it's great due to the fact that in the past his son had been abducted.
57;spielberg and Cruise are good together.
58;It's intelligent and certainly compelling.
59;The gadgets are very futuristic and are another enjoyable part of the movie.
60;The story and the plot holds you at the edge of your seat.
61;It's a little something that almost everyone will love.
62;It's has scenes that you'll remember in a long time to come like the Jetpack chase.
63;fantastic!It's something that all Sixth sense, AI, Tom Cruise, Spielberg, and Lucas fans will appreciate.
64;It's something that fans of Blade runner will love.
65;It's thoroughly entertaining and Kind of creepy!
66;Fascinating ideas and gripping scenes make this movie great!
67;This movie is an awesome science fiction thriller.
68;I loved A. i. Artificial Intelligence, but this is ten times better.
69;I loved every minute of it!
70;The 2h40min was all worth it.
71;This chilly tale of one man's haunted past AND future is a must see!
72;Very much along a typical Spielberg's recipy: great idea converted to be available for any type of customers, a perfect mediocricity.
73;under the vision of Spielberg, the movie is ladden with action, drama, surprise twists (the whole gammette) and is surprisingly stocked full of laughs from all directions.
74;Spielberg's setting is astounding, with a mix of classic Victorian and astonishing sidewinding skyscrapers, and Cruise moves through it with panache unheard of in action films.
75;Spielberg will enchant you with sympathy for the precognative beigns who wail away their lives in a vat of mysterious liquid, their heads incessantly bombinated by visions of future murder.
76;He will whisk you with feeling of vengance for Anderton's supposed enemies.
77;Then he will pull the hook and get you with the surprises.
78;Minority Report is a great dive into the possibilities of a multi.
79;It's long, but the story gets deeper and deeper as you go right up to a surprise ending.
80;A great thriller with twists and turns, that you will never know the answers to our heroe's questions until the very end.
81;this year's best thriller yet!
82;"Based on a short story by Philip K. Dick (whose works have inspired such sci fi noir films as Ridley Scott's Bladerunner and Paul Verhoeven's Total Recall), Minority Report is one of those rare action movies that engages the mind while giving the audience an exciting ""race the clock"" chase in a futuristic Washington, D. c. it is the year 2054, and the Nation's capital has been rendered homicide."
83;It is a flawless system, and with crime at an all.
84;time high in the U. s., Precrime seems to be the perfect solution.
85;and the audience will also see that the relatively young and dedicated Precrime chief has his own weak spots.
86;spielberg, working from a screenplay by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen, has made one of his best films in recent years.
87;He gives the audience a plausible vision of a future America where eye.
88;And even though Minority Report is also a cautionary tale of the abuse of power, the corrosive effects of grief and revenge, Spielberg's themes of hope and love shine through in this riveting and sometimes chilling sci.
89;Like Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, Minority Report is destined to be a classic of the genre.
90;"For as odd as it may seem to be, I actually found that I enjoyed Steven Spielberg's lastest film, ""Minority Report""."
91;"But, with ""A. i."" and now this film, Spielberg I feel has made back to back entertaining films."
92;Minority Report starts out in the year 2054.
93;And Precrime Law Enforcement is the new wave of the future.
94;Precrime as the title may suggest, is actually able to know in advance when a crime will take place.
95;And perhaps they are right, but, in order to enjoy the film, we must go along with it and accept it's ideas.
96;Tom Cruise plays Detective John Anderton, one of the best and hardest working cops at Precrime.
97;Anderton has a lot of secrets in his closet and when we find out what they are it adds a whole new level to the film.
98;Now, it plays on our human emotions as well.
99;Which was a smart move.
100;Anderton and Director Burgess (the great Max von Sydow) are under investigation for Precrime.
101;This is really just the movie's way of setting up it's story as to how this all works.
102;there's a feeling of an old.
103;"fashioned noir film to ""Minority Report"" recalling films like ""The Big Clock"" and ""Dark Passage""."
104;The film has a lot to say about what we should and shouldn't put our beliefs into.
105;Spielberg always manages to get the best special effects in the business.
106;He has a clever way with telling the story, which I enjoyed very much.
107;Good solid acting by Sydow, it would be nice if he was nominated for best supporting actor.
108;And Cruise somehow gets himself into good movies, movies that are always better than him.
109;"I also have to note the impressive job by Samath Morton, you should remember her from Woody Allen's ""Sweet and Lowdown""."
110;line:Spielberg does some movie magic with this film.
111;Should please all who see it.
112;Truly one of the year's best films!
113;So much so that I went back 2 or 3 more times just to see it.
114;all these years later and it is still a great movie.
115;Just makes me feel good every time I see that opening scene with John working that computer and going to prevent the first murder.
116;Brings back memories of being a kid while still being an amazing movie.
117;well worth the money to see this movie whenever I want.
118;It is a must own up there with Good Will Hunting, in that it deserves a spot on your movie shelf.
119;This movie was great in every sense of the word.
120;Tom Cruise pulled off his role perfectly!
121;I love the way Spielberg makes people step back and take a look in the mirror and think if we are taking technology too far too prosecute individuals.
122;As also in Artificial Intelligence a misunderstood and underappreciated masterpiece.
123;Sure society today has some flaws but it is sophisticated and fair for the most part.
124;thirds of this movie I was happy enough.
125;The action sequences were rather obviously stuck in simply because the creators wanted to stick them in, but they were well done and added to the excitement, if not the story.
126;There are novel bits, some of them quite good.
127;There are some nicely bizarre gory bits.
128;I liked the greenhouse scene.
129;Starting four or five years ago, Cruise began collaborating with high.
130;MINORITY REPORT, the first Spielberg.
131;cruise collaboration, is a superior science fiction.
132;action hybrid, with a very intriguing plot, and an ending so far away from the beginning you could lose track of how you got there.
133;This was a visionary masterpiece.
134;The plot deepens as you go along, interspersed with full.
135;throttle action through a sleek metropolis fascinating in its conceptualization.
136;the cinematography shows the future in sterilized colors, suggesting that everything was sleekly utilitarian, melding dazzling form with commonplace function, a corporate wonderland.
137;Every surface serves as an animated billboard scanning the passerby's eyes for identification, triggering sexy advertisements in which svelte models seamlessly refer to you by name and coo the latest fashion accouterments.
138;And there are automobiles that deliver you right up to your apartment, and jet packs and 3.
139;The second disc has interviews and special effects pieces for those of us who really enjoyed this movie and want to know all about it.
140;For science fiction fans, this is definitely one to add to the library.
141;Before I go on and nitpick about this film, I will say I really enjoyed this film.
142;mystery/action film that ends like a fairy tale.
143;There's also definitely some humor injected into the script.
144;But this film kicks it up a notch.
145;(You'll understand my statement after watching the film.)
146;I still liked the film a lot though.
147;this move explores the use of technology in government.
148;Minority Report on the surface has plenty of flash and dazzle.
149;The plot itself is worthy of entry into the blockbuster summer arena.
150;Riveting in it's twists and turns taking the characters toward a dynamic resolution.
151;Each character is given enough screen presence to give the audience a good hint into their motivations.
152;The second half is exactly what we hoped the entire movie would be, well paced, well directed and acted, it is a far cry from the first half.
153;Another distraction from the attempts to present this as a realistic view into that future.
154;with all of it's problems, the movie is still worth viewing and once you get through the initial problems with the first half is a highly engrossing tale of an all too real possible future.
155;The general audience will probably enjoy the movie for it's visual effects and gloss over the plot.
156;It remains to be seen which audience he succeeded with.
157;In the future Earth has found a new way to deal with murder.
158;This movie really does give you a scary image of the future.
159;All in all a great movie.
160;I am starting to love Spielberg's work, let's hope he keeps it up.
161;mR arguably stacked up right up there with the classics of the 80's and the balance between storyline and CGI seemed to have been struck .
162;I can best sum this film as a police thriller in the future.
163;Its story line in itself provides an entrancing mixture of suspense, thrills, and action (all naturally embellished by Speilberg's direction).
164;there are other interesting motifs involved, including water (water water everywhere!)
165;There are a lot of interesting devices in the film that gives it cinemagraphic depth.
166;the film's ideas of the future in themselves are interesting, particularly since they are derived from a compilation of minds.
167;There are holograms everywhere and retnail scans everywhere.
168;the characters of the film are fairly well developed.
169;I found the most interesting characters to be the 'precogs' who can detect murders before they happen.
170;overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable film, perhaps even the best Speilberg film of them all (it is certainly my favourite Tom Cruise film).
171;I can't help but to see it again.
172;We love this movie and watch it all the time.
173;But I do love this movie.
174;Steven Spielberg has always been good at action movies.
175;It has already cleaned up D. c. and now they want to unleash this new breakthrough to the world.
176;Like all Spielberg films, you are sure to be impressed by his storytelling and imagery.
177;the good news is that the movie's special FX are more subtle and downplayed in the backgrounds than the overwhealming monstrosity's of Star Wars I and II.
178;It is a detective movie.
179;It is a great movie with twists and turns and nonstop action.
180;The futuristic plot and very cool gadgets make this movie worth you're while.
181;Minority Report is one of the best science fiction films that I have seen in a very long time.
182;Combining science fiction, murder and brilliant special effects, Steven Speilburg has told one of his greatest tales to date.
183;This success has gained the attention of the nation, and the program is about to go to a national level.
184;Anderton's superior, Lamar Burgess, played by Max von Sydow, warns Anderton to be wary of the agent.
185;From Anderton's characterization to the gritty world of 2054, this film presents a story that not only looks good, but makes you think about it.
186;From the story that this movie was based on, I saw a huge improvement.
187;The story is more human, emotional and interesting.
188;anderton's and Agatha's characterizations were both well done.
189;Agatha's transformation goes from an object and police tool to a human who is a lot more complex than thought of.
190;speilburg's team succeded with the future world that they created as well.
191;From the drug use, transportation, advertising, it presents a frighteningly real and believable feel to the film.
192;Agmented by special effects, and we have a very real world.
193;This raises the film above most science fiction movies, both by it's complexity and grandur.
194;Anderton sees himself murdering someone, but it is much more complicated.
195;Science aside, one can debate the ethics and theory in the film for a long time, making this film even more memorable.
196;this movie is one of the best films of modern times, and will not fail to amaze and delight it's audience.
197;The idea that murderers could be stopped and convicted before they even commit the act probably sounds very reassuring and even beneficial to many people.
198;pretty much every aspect of this film is good.
199;The story is phenominal, the stunts and effects are amazing, and the acting is great.
200;I think that the only problem is that it starts to drag on a bit toward the end, but the unexpected ending is definitely worth the wait.
201;This movie will make you think while simultaneously visually pleasing you.
202;This is a great movie.
203;It artfully combines intelligence and suspense and paints a compelling view of the future.
204;I even enjoyed Tom Cruise's performance.
205;It's masterfully presented by Spielberg in such a way that its eventual adpotion in 'real life' looks like a done deal.
206;an unexpected delight here: prolific Swedish character actor Peter Stormare's turn as the creepy, back.
207;The film has some great ideas and does a good job bringing them to the screen.
208;The acting was good (even Tom Cruise who I don't usually care for) and the script was good as well.
209;MINORITY REPORT treads the thin line between present and future with style and grace.
210;It also raises some thorny questions .
211;While the film never achieves the serious tone of BLADE RUNNER, both are kindred spirits.
212;I thought it was good and had some powerful things to say.
213;fi film, but it is certainly one of the better efforts in recent memory.
214;The standard fare items are here: storyboards, commentary, interviews, photographs, effects discussions etc.
215;MINORITY REPORT is a film that should be seen by everyone at least once.
216;Some of you will love it and others of you will not care one bit.
217;Many said he acted very well in this movie, but I wasn't moved at all.
218;Because, I mean, it was quite entertaining.
219;The eventual uncovering of the truth that accompanies most of his sci.
220;paced, and the surprises are good.
221;in fact, I prefer it.
222;The way he portrayed consumerism and the internet seemed believable (and actually kind of neat, although the subsequent loss of privacy was eerie), but everything else?
223;Samantha Morton is hot, even when she's bald.
224;I liked the visuals of the film.
225;I liked how they managed to use simple glass shields and simply pull up what they want.
226;I liked the pumped up action scenes and visuals it has.
227;The plot gets somewhat hazy but has more than enough visuals and strong acting by its lead characters to compensate.
228;I think thsi is one of Tom Cruise's best roles and one of Spielberg's best films.
229;Minority Report fails on many levels, but succeeds enough to be worth watching.
230;I'm not the type who has to have a explanation for everything, but there's so many wild leaps and bounds in this movie it's simply outrageous at times.
231;all that being said though, despite some big time flaws it's still a decent movie and it's worth watching at least once.
232;Still, it manages to have it's moments, and the effects are pretty good.
233;I recieved this movie promptly and I got it at a great price so I was pretty happy about that.
234;That is a win win
235;It provides the perfect vehicle for us to go back and discuss for ourselves, as did BR.
236;steven's use of a futurist team as part of preproduction has obviously helped the movie .
237;things we hear about separately today as being possible have come to life.
238;the product placement is goodness and realistic .
239;Excellent work by everyone involved in this movie!
240;Even though this movie may not be as groundbreaking as other Spielberg's flicks but is still a true marvel.
241;The script/story of the movie is very innovative and intriguing, it will completely blow you away!
242;Tom Cruise is amazing as usual.
243;cogs and crime prevention is mind boggling.
244;"It's just beautiful
245;If you like movies that involve plenty of twists and turns, this one is for you.
246;But I should have known to just sit back and trust Steven Spielberg, because it all ties together in a haunting climax.
247;In such a """"perfect"""" system, it seems highly unlikely that the authorities wouldn't revoke his access immediately when they realize he is wanted for a future murder.3) Some reviewers have said that it would be impossible to predict the future because it hasn't happened yet."""
248;I will leave that for you to make you mind up about.
249;The action is great and some of the special effects scene are breathtaking, particularly the first chase scene which features a sprawling suburban freeway system, complete with futuristic vehicles and roadways.
250;there are also many sinister moments, which portray a dark image of what life might be like in fifty years.
251;the best moments of MINORITY REPORT are, however, not the action scenes, nor the sequences packed with special effects.
252;It actually has some astonishing drama, with Cruise in his best form since JERRY MCGUIRE.
253;will he or won't he pull the trigger?The movie is worth watching just for this one sequence alone.
254;I have found that viewing this vid isa much better than whewn I saw it the first time in the theatre.
255;Another great movie from Steven Spielberg .
256;imagine a world that has no crime.
257;The subject of the movie is a very interesting topic and the movie goes well until it falls into the usual formula of setting up and the plot.
258;but what holds the audience is the extravaganza of what all typically we can expect in another 50 years .
259;A special applause to Steven Spielberg.
260;adding to the above are the excellent photography and background music and the dialog Everybody runs .
261;On a whole the movie is enjoyable if you forgive certain aspects.
262;Even more rare is sci.
263;like Bladerunner, Spielberg tells a tale based on a story by the great Philip K. Dick and he does so with an equal amount of competence.
264;while this film was marketed as a summer action blockbuster, at it's heart it's a very philosophical film that really makes you think about your own views on life.
265;Spielberg is brilliant at selling you on the idea of precrime then later revealing it's problems while never once being biased.
266;visually, Spielberg chose to reflect the style of the movie by modifying the look of the film.
267;disc set with the first disc devoted to outstanding sound and visual presentation of the feature and nothing but.
268;The second disc is loaded with plenty of background material and documentaries.
269;Indeed form a pure cinematic viewpoint they have a lot in common .
270;the subtle lighting, the differing viewpoints, the pace of the story and a logical, satisfying conclusion.
271;Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances as the distraught father who gains a glimmer of hope that his stolen son is alive.
272;The mutant children are absolutely remarkable in their actions.
273;This one deserves top honors.
274;Spielberg has done it again.
275;He gave us an extraordinary future world in last year's 'A. i.' Now Spielberg's vision combined with Philip K. Dick's short story give viewers a look at 2054 Washington, DC, and it's a look that's hard to forget.
276;As we have come to expect from Spielberg, every last detail is perfectly in place and well thought out, making this futuristic DC very believable.
277;Spielberg shows us that while the future holds many technical advances and changes, the GAP and stores like it will be with us forever.
278;Oh well, you can't have a perfect future.
279;'Minority Report' is an exciting, intriguing sf/mystery that pulls you in and makes you believe that when you step out of the theatre you'll be seeing all the innovations you just saw on the screen.
280;It's a real rarity these days: Eye.
281;popping special effects AND a riveting story.
282;Somehow he keeps delivering the goods in a way that only he can.
283;very good special effects and visuals .
284;This film is simply Speilberg's finest hour.
285;He will never top this, and yes I know I'm talking about the man who directed Jaws, ET, Close Encounters, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List etc.
286;This film has everything .
287;breathtaking and groundbreaking special effects, a fabulous cast with superb performances (Cruise's finest since 'Born on the 4th of July' which was a tour de force) and an intricate byzantine plot that keeps you guessing until the very end.
288;And I defy anyone to understand the incredibly complex and fast moving story the first time.
289;But that's perfect as everytime I viewed it, it was as visually thrilling and exciting as the first time.
290;An absolute classic, thoroughly compelling, gripping, engaging and stunning from start to finish.
291;totally is a S. Spielberg movie with the good traces of his humor from his old 80s and 90s movies.
292;Good suspense and effects and a lot of fun.
293;Science fiction films have always been films that can either be really enjoyable or pretty silly.
294;Tom Cruise's character is really good and exciting throughout the movie.
295;You simply must give Minority Report a serious watch.
296;Minority Report, which works as a mystery, a sci.
297;fi film and a pretty damn exciting adventure film, one of the best films of 2002.
298;the acting is great, for Tom Cruise, in some of the scenes mourning his son, escapes his usual bravado to show some of that talent he so rarely gets to show in an action film.
299;stealing, brilliant Lois Smith also give compelling, supporting performances.
300;the plot is labyrinth, and the payoff is, for the most part, rewarding, though the ending could've been a bit less conventional.
301;And what is with that ultra.
302;The documentary is, mostly, Cruise and Spielberg patting themselves and each other on the back.
303;The mechanics behind the film are inspired, and I wanted to know more.
304;minute movie about how brilliant Spielberg is.
305;Give me the good stuff about it.
306;Minority report lots of action lots of twists and turns very happy to have in my collection arrived as advertised in excellent condition will be doing future business
307;"I just got back from my first viewing of Steven Spielberg's new movie ""Minority Report"" and just let me tell you."
308;He brought us amazing movies, such as: Jaws, ET, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, and Saving Private Ryan (not to mention the Indiana Jones trilogy).
309;It had action, it was intelligent, and it told a great story which is sure to open the minds of the people who have seen it.
310;The future of murders can be seen, and thus, prevented.
311;Cruise's character believes in the system, until he sees his future.
312;leads to great chase scenes and a few plot twists that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
313;A sheer thrill and worth seeing again.
314;If you haven't seen it, I high recommend seeing this gem.
315;Steven Speilberg has put yet another title worth taking a look at not only does this film star Tom Cruise but it also stars rising star Colin farrell who does a great performance as a rival who is trying to figure out how (Pre.
316;crime) works along with this film goes the un.
317;It is a good movie.
318;With Spielberg and Cruise together, you can't go wrong.
319;A very cool idea about crime fighting.
320;The storyline was very imaginative and very well done.
321;The special effects and action are awesome.
322;This movie will take you on one hell of a ride and keep you on the edge of your seat as you can't wait to see what happens at the end.
323;the program based only in Washington has become popular enough to go National.
324;"the ""yeah, right"" plot is explained as painlessly as possible and one is quite happy to suspend disbelief."
325;"The detail is the beauty, like another Philip K. Dick project, ""Total Recall"" the minutae of life in 2054 is happily paraded before us, generally in a very subtle manner."
326;"Well you've seen it before as ""The Fugitive"", but the end game defies one's expectations in some delightfully twisty ways."
327;another bonus, this is a surprisingly funny film from Spielberg, with a sense of humour reminiscent of Total Recall and Fifth Element.
328;And count 'em eleven special effects companies contributing to the seamless look of the thing.
329;so ultimately, action, technology, humour and even a little mind food too.
330;no Bladerunner, I'm afraid, but this is the best blockbuster sci.
331;fi to turn up since, well, Bladerunner.
332;go see on the big screen with an audience.
333;Steven Spielberg, here rebounding from the admirable failure of A. i., give us a cinematic science fiction film noir masterpiece with Minority Report.
334;story, plot, atmosphere, acting and characters, eerily prescient futuristic setting, and novel adaptation .
335;this is quite simply the finest science fiction film released since Blade Runner.
336;As a huge fan of Philip K. Dick's work .
337;I was delighted with the feel and atmosphere of this movie.
338;it presents a future world that is entirely believable, and eerily plausible.
339;"Spielberg, obviously a fan of the idiosyncratic author, inserts many ""PhiDickian"" moments into the film."
340;elements present in almost all of Dick's works .
341;"are worked skillfully and logically into the film, as are other moments that would be right at home in any work of Dick's: Anderton's (Cruise) bizzare meeting with ""the creator of Pre."
342;At nearly two and a half hours in length, Spielberg has indeed given us a masterpiece.
343;The film is very well.
344;The shots and level of lighting used througout the film are masterful and entirely appropriate.
345;choreographed: one virtuoso scene shows Anderton and Agatha (the pre.
346;This scene is very well done (as are several similar ones), and are very witty, without ever resorting to Hollywood cliche.
347;The film is very well.
348;I also applaud this film for being both very suspenseful and interesting, without forasking intelligence and provocativeness.
349;Although the movie features its fair share of action, there is also a lot of dialogue, and the movie's overall IQ (so to speak) is very high .
350;acted, and the cast was well.
351;I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, but he performs his role here admirably well: he's the best in all of Hollywood of displaying that look of utter astonishment and confusion, and his winning smile is put on in all the best spots.
352;Quite simply put, a masterful science fiction film that deserves all the success it can get.
353;The movie itself is a feast for the eyes, with many futuristic and imaginative things thrown in by Spielberg, my favorite being the spiders.
354;A superb piece of sci.
355;I came into the theatre with high expectations for this film, and why not?
356;And whats here is good, but it could have been far better, and it is for this I give it three stars.
357;the opening sequence does exactly what it should, it draws you into the movie, introduces some of the main characters, and in this case actually makes you think.
358;The whole precrime aspect, in fact, should make you think.
359;depth as I may have liked it to.
360;But it COMPLETELY WRECKS what was good about it when it draws on for another half an hour in order to give the audience an obligatory happy ending.
361;At any rate, you probably will enjoy this movie, and it's definetly worth watching at least once, but know that it could have been far better.
362;Great movie, destined to be listed as one of the great futuristic thrillers of all time.
363;A must see for avid movie watchers!
364;The visual effects are astonishing, the plot is so thick and complex it makes your head hurt.
365;Every aspect of the story is flawless, and the acting is excellent.
366;You never fully understand the whole plot until near the very end, but watching the entire film to find out what's going on is most certainly worth the time.
367;kudos to the entire cast and crew that assembled this masterpiece.
368;The first 45 minutes of this film sets up an intriguing premise, a thoughtful tone, and raises interesting questions about free will and predestination, intention and culpability, justice and individual rights.
369;a long action set piece (wrapping up with an automated.
370;a lot of grossout slapstick with two 'quirky' characters on loan from a David Lynch movie.
371;a tidy, treacly endingIn the movie's defense, the production design is brilliant.
372;The visuals have the just the right balance of the familiar and the shockingly new to make this a believable future.
373;The best (and funniest, and grimmest) detail was the ubiquitous, individually.
374;but address the moral and philosophical questions at its center.
375;there's enough going on in Spielberg's kitchen.
376;It made me sad, because all the ingredients of a great movie were here .
377;I'll just state that I only give 5 stars to a film that I'd want to watch again, that surprised and entertained me, and that held my attention and sucked me into its world.
378;the story is compelling, and so fast.
379;all in all the script is plausible and intelligent, a warning against surrendering one's civil rights.
380;In fact, it does this so well that at film's end I found myself seriously questioning the fate of the Precrime Division in spite of its shortcomings.
381;handed as always, and even though the multiple endings of the various plot lines feel contrived and tacked on, the first 2 hrs 20 mins of the film are so incredibly compelling that I'll certainly be watching again to see how much I missed the first time through.
382;10 years after release, this movie still holds up.
383;Very entertaining, even seeing it for the 3rd or so time.
384;The kids enjoyed it as well.
385;The computer animation was good but most computer animation these days is pretty good.
386;minority Report is am absolutely brilliant film,filled with complex characters and an intruiging storyline.
387;and the story is actually the best part of the movie,so much so that you can watch the film over and over again and find something new every time.
388;This movie succeeded everywhere that Spielburg's AI did not, and really got me excited about sci.
389;The story flows perfectly, Cruise fits the role, the action is ingenious, and the ideas presented activate the imagination rather than dulling it, like so many movies.
390;So I am now a fan.
391;The effects are incredible and I am not someone usually taken with special effects.
392;In fact the SFX in this movie is so good, people were amazed with what they saw on the screen.
393;It is a criminal experiment that is straight out of Orwells paranoid 1984, but it is successful enough to warrant a nationwide program.
394;There was lots of visual eye candy that served the story and the plot, but it was not overly done and the things that appear on the screen looked so vivid, that it looked real.
395;Spielberg's commitment to detail should be commended.
396;the acting was good overall.
397;cog and Cruise, who gets the thankless role of being the straight man.
398;One major one was Tom's eyes.
399;for the most part, great pace and effects.
400;It was an interesting role for Tom Cruise to play .
401;away from his slick Mission Impossible character.
402;A few sentimental scenes (Spielberg's trademark) are ok .
403;Great entertainment, great ending but a bit of a downer due to subject matter and mood of the film .
404;Minority Report is my second favorite Science Fiction film, after Blade Runner.
405;This is a great film with a complicated plot that twists and turns for 2.5 hours.
406;Colin Farrel does a really good job of showing us a multi.
407;He first comes off as a smart.
408;The viewer is pulled for loyalty between the fugitive Cruise, whom we think is innocent, and the ambitious newcomer Agent Witwer who reveals to us scene by scene a man of competence and justice seeking truth.
409;samatha Morton does a great job of playing Agatha, gradually coming out of her coma and revealing past, present, future to an endangered man who may help reveal the crime and criminal behind her mother's death.
410;"In ""Bladerunner"" he was able to construct a great science fiction story around existentialism."
411;"In ""Minority Report"" he resurrects the ancient Oracles of Delphi and builds an action packed story around Free Will and Determinism."
412;It is a strength of this film that at multiple points, the characters are faced with a decision that appears to be foretold but which is still in play.
413;This is the point in which he exerts his free will, his freedom to chose his course of action, and yet we also see how a structured deterministic world still confines that choice.
414;Phillip K. Dick creates a world for us here in which we see that freedom of choice and pre.
415;ordained determinism co. exist and that the consciousness of a good man makes all the difference.
416;two final comments on the technology of the future: first, the film rightly shows that customer consumer patterns will become so tailored that marketers will be able to show you exactly what you are looking for before you aware you are looking.
417;good acting, witty and suspenseful, intelligent and complicated plot, philosophical underpinning, and fantastic art direction and special effects all come together to make Minority Report an excellent film.
418;Despite the unfortunate fact that the villian of the movie can be determined within the first 15 minutes, this is an excellent flick that caters to my personal Johnson of time travel.
419;The implications of knowing the future and the paradoxes created by altering the forseen are wonderfully explored .
420;At that point, what I like to call the Spielberg AI Complex sets in and the movie wraps up all of the loose ends in a happy fashion.
421;Everybody gets what's coming to them and all is right with the world.
422;"Also sort of a modern ""1948"" movie."
423;"fi fans, but we really enjoyed ""Minority Report""."
424;The story, the action, and the hi.
425;tech gadgets are all great.
426;Tom Cruise is effective in the lead role and we can actually forget that he is Tom Cruise and just enjoy his character!
427;A fun ride from beginning to end.
428;"Max Von Sydow is fabulous
429;I really came away from A. i. feeling let down and Minority Report relieved that feeling.
430;To see how our world could very possibly look a few years from now was amazing!
431;aside from the technical mastery and effects wizardry, the emotional content of the film really hit me.
432;This film blended action, humor, drama, suspense and a serious message of free will over destiny that I think a lot of people overlooked when it hit the theaters.
433;Thanks to Washington's elite (and highly experimental) pre.
434;based on the Philip K. Dick short story of the same name, Minority Report features great directing courtesy of Stephen Spielberg, and in my opinion, one of Tom Cruise's best performances since A Few Good Men.
435;the setting, while highly imaginative and slighty futuristic, remains plausible and realistic throughtout the entire film.
436;It is a perfect combination of CGI and physical sets"
437;in terms of the film's storyline itself, perhaps the best way to describe it is a cross somewhere between The Fugitive and Blade Runner (which, coincidentally enough, was also based on a Philip K. Dick story).
438;i recommend Minority Report highly, and would have given it 5 stars, had it not have been for the ending.
439;Not because the plot doesn't get resolved (it does and does well) but because all in all it is a unique and greatly entertaining film .
440;the kind many directors aspire to, but few succeed in, making.
441;This was a very exciting movie.
442;There were great action sequences.
443;Yet there was also a very intriguing story.
444;I would recommend it to everyone who likes action movies.
445;"Tom Cruise was very good in this movie and in my opinion this is his best performance since ""Interview with the Vampire""."
446;Minority Report is one of the year's best films.
447;Minority Report is an action movie with a lot of heart.
448;It will surprise you in ways that you might not expect, even if you think you can guess the ending well ahead of time.
449;Hopefully it engages your brain just a little, because the notion that all it takes is one moment of courage .
450;to change the shape of the future is a very powerful one that I think many people take for granted.
451;there's plenty of cool imagery and top.
452;It's nothing far fetched, and it's magnificent to behold.
453;That real nature of the setting helps you to really empathize with the characters in the story, something that has often been a bit of a difficulty in scifi movies.
454;I think anyone can really enjoy it.
455;Tom Cruise does solid films as eccentric as he is.
456;The concept of the film is interesting and the acting well done.
457;"I just got back from seeing ""Minority Report"", and I hate to use this expression, but this movie rules!"
458;though don't get me wrong, it is profound.
459;it is about as good a time I've had at the movies in a long time.
460;Mark my words, this will get a Best Picture nomination.
461;"I really hope you, whoever you are, do yourself (and your family, if you've got one) the favor of seeing ""Minority Report""."
462;And while the action sequences were there, this movie also delivered quite a bit more.
463;The system is flawless or so it would seem.
464;The story really gets moving when the number one pre.
465;The story does take the road often traveled in one aspect.
466;"This movie delivered a couple of unexpected plot twists that move it into the upper echelon of movies, and still stuck to a story that wasn't at all confusing like Cruises' last movie ""Vanilla Sky."
467;The acting in this movie while good, wasn't not top notch.
468;He continues to make movies entertaining without being a very versatile actor.
469;There were a few notable minor players adding somewhat to the entertainment value of the picture.
470;The sporadic comedy throughout the movie seemed to keep the entire theatre entertained and one scene in particular made my stomach turn a little.
471;The best part of this movie was by far the visual aspects of it.
472;"While several movies in the recent past look at the future as a ""Jetsons"" type setting with everything looking high tech, this movie does an outstanding job of mixing modern day with everyone's views of the future."
473;For those who like movies that make you think, this movie will be entertaining.
474;"There are some decent action scenes for the ""movies for guys who like movies"" crowd."
475;And for suspense fans, this movie offers it's share of suspenseful moments with out the really overdramatic music custom made for horror movies.
476;Most Spielberg fans will enjoy it.
477;Characters.8 (Fairly simple characters with decent back stories)3.
478;Flow.9 (Surprisingly well paced for a 2 hr.
479;Entertainment Value.10 (Very interesting, start to finish)7.
480;Replay Value.8 (Worth watching again just for the effects)8.
481;I watched this movie expecting to see an intelligent, exciting, and enjoyable futuristic sci.
482;fi movie by a talented director.
483;"Nevertheless, these are the kinds of scenes I found in ""Minority Report"" and they prevented me from enjoying an otherwise good movie."
484;Another character is introduced blowing a large amount of snot all over his face.
485;I feel that Spielberg should have been more subtle to achieve that effect, but he is often anything but subtle.
486;the film has many good elements.
487;The story was good, many scenes are compelling, and the ending is satisying.
488;The story is profound and absorbing, and Cruise has never been better.
489;I love that it was sci.
490;There's a good murder mystery in the center and lots of futuristic thrills along the way.
491;the use of technical elements was actually pretty cool.
492;I can actually envision some/most of these gadgets being in use in the not.
493;It got very draggy at certain points and, under a less.
494;this is a good movie, but bring your attention span.
495;It's an eerily real picture, as if someone went into the future and came back and told everyone what he saw.
496;So we have Spielberg's first action blockbuster since the Lost World and it's not in the same category as E. t or Jaws but it's still an entertaining romp.
497;it's a future that seems quite possible.
498;Getting on a train gets you scanned.
499;These and many more are featured in the film and helped along by Spielberg's think tank.
500;It's merely a good movie.
501;tom Cruise can be a good actor if he had the right character.
502;He's actually surprising in that.
503;Tom Cruise kind of pulls it off, getting better as the film continues.
504;But it's close enough and even a near masterpiece is more better watching than the recent fare plaguing movie theatres(I'm looking at you The Pacifier, Monster.
505;Movie gets better everytime I watch it!
506;The best part is the first half of the movie is good, but the second half blows you away.
507;The action sequences are pure Hollywood pandering to the target audience.
508;"And Tom Cruise again gives a swaggering, ""intense"" and essentially meaningless performance."
509;Even with this said, Max von Sydow gives a strong, complex performance and Samantha Morton as the pre.
510;Minority Report is a spectacular science fiction masterpiece directed by the great Steven Spielberg and loosely adapted from a short story by Philip K. Dick, one of the fathers of the cyberpunk genre.
511;The movie shows us a world filled with dazzling technology but tells a personal story of a man who is betrayed by the system he worked for.
512;minority Report is set in Washington, in the year 2054 and it's a great time to live in.
513;Moving pictures draw your attention to every ad and poster.
514;He must use all of his skills to escape and outwit the now.
515;All the actors give great performances, especially Tom Cruise and Samantha Morton.
516;Is this a worthy price to pay to maintain a murder.
517;Minority Report will give you a lot to think about and its engrossing mystery will keep you engaged until the very end.
518;Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise combine forces to make what is really a substantial thriller with a science.
519;The story and the characters are what really make this work.
520;also fun are the in.
521;it's not a classic in any sense, but Minority Report is a fun, fast.
522;paced thriller with a brain and a message.
523;This gets high marks for being an involving film that, despite a long length of almost two.
524;the film is a good mixture of action and suspense.
525;The subject matter is interesting, too: what would do you (or the police) had very reliable information on crimes that were about to be committed, that you could prevent things from happening before they actually did?I am of the opinion that this is one of Spielberg's underrated gems.
526;Once again, Steven Spielberg has given us a very enjoyable, skillfully made science fiction film.
527;there are some great action set.
528;All five of the lead characters are well.
529;The whole precrime system MUST be a unconsitutional!
530;Having said that, for the most part, the future technology is quite realistic, especially the advertising system .
531;this brings us to the second, most serious problem of the film, and that's the cimematography.
532;The colour is pretty much bleached out to nothingness.
533;Think about this film crossed with Blade Runner's visuals and you can imagine how much better Minority Report could have been.
534;The action is done in new and interesting ways.
535;The plot is interesting (especially for what is really an action flick) and will keep you involved all the way through.
536;all of the actors give very good performances and though the special effects are quite amazing they are used in the service of the story.
537;There are many many many effects like that in this movie.
538;while I enjoyed the movie a great deal there were a couple or three scenes that caused me real discomfort.
539;i liked the movie enough to want it to be a big success, but not enough to tell my kids to go see it.
540;it really is that interesting.
541;but if you love an involved and interesting story, and relish seeing things you haven't seen before this is a good movie for you.
542;What I love about streaming videos through the net is accessibility.
543;I don't know how fast my Mac needs to be in order to stream videos but I still love the convenience .
544;I have seen the movie three times and appreciate its brilliance more after each viewing, Steven Spielberg challenges his audience to think while he tells this story as only he can.
545;The premise a very scary one seems that one day it will be real.
546;Samantha Morton whose beauty was so evident in Sweet and Lowdown is incredible as Agatha.
547;just so incredible an actor and so handsome on film that I forgot Tom Cruise was in the picture at all for awhile, but Tom is terrific and of course that scene stealer Max Von Sydow does a great job as well.
548;Get the Popcorn and the Milk Duds and hang on for a great ride!!!
549;Anderson is a member of a team of detectives who stop crimes before they happen.
550;The system seems to work fine until Anderson himself is seen committing a crime.
551;It is a thrill ride that will definitely turn ever the firmest Cruise hater into a fan.
552;The malicious sense of visceral fun and gallows humor that made Steven Speilberg's JAWS so irresistible have miraculously returned to the director after productive stints in World War II films and gentle fables.
553;MINORITY REPORT is his best film in years, retaining the chilly futurism of AI while injecting it with a feverish energy that recalls the INDIANA JONES films.
554;His is an engaging, surprisingly moving performance.
555;It is rare to find a film that gracefully (and somewhat effortlessly) balances action and thought, violence and meditation, adventure and philosophy.
556;MINORITY REPORT is such a film.
557;I love this movie one of his best I can watch this movie over over I even got my family into it.
558;It was a good movie that posed interesting questions.
559;"A film of which the 2nd highest critical compliment is neat"" and the better."
560;"valued compliment is designated principally by VOLUME: ""NEAT!"""
561;Thank you David for enlightening me !
562;What an incredible ego you have, david!
563;Thanks again for your cogent insight into the nature of film!
564;I think he's a highly overrated actor who receives far too much attention and praise for his own good, but I've always said that he knows how to pick a movie.
565;This catapults John into a game of cat and mouse as he tries to prove his innocence while uncovering a strange murder that pre.
566;steven Spielberg's direction here is fantastic.
567;Visually this movie is stunning from start to finish, and plot.
568;wise this is a film that will keep you intrigued and involved.
569;Samantha Morton is stunning as usual, completely stealing every scene she's in and becoming her character mind, body and soul.
570;Colin Farrell makes a fine breakout here, stealing scene after scene from Cruise and proving to be the more charismatic and entertaining actor of the two.
571;Max von Sydow also pulls out a nice little performance as the ambiguous Lamar Burgess, mentor to the now troubled John.
572;It was also nice to see Kathryn Morris (of `Cold Case' fame) here as Lara, John's ex.
573;overall `Minority Report' is one of the best films of 2002, visually, intellectually and entertaining.
574;It's a complete joyride from start to finish despite Tom and is well worth multiple viewings.
575;This movie has all the makings of a classic.
576;fi with a turn the tables story that is compelling and engaging.
577;Very creative minds were clearly working on that aspect of this film.
578;the story itself remains compelling and entertaining.
579;A great film noir from Spielberg and Cruise.
580;This has to be one of the best thought out, best shot movies ever made.
581;The plot twists keep on coming, and the acting is amazing.
582;One of the best films I've seen EVER, definitly a top 10 possibly a top 5 movie.
583;If it's not nominated for cinematography, directing, and best picture the acadamy should be going down.
584;Obviously the improvements in technology make this much more possible, but Spielberg, for all the special effects in a film like Minority Report, manages to keep the characters at the forefront and everything else in a supporting position.
585;a lot has been said and written about this film so I won't rehash old news, but here's what I thought made it an enjoyable viewing experience.
586;First, it was completely believable.
587;Second, the story, originally a creation of Philip K. Dick, is very well done because it takes a complex situation and turns it on a very simple premise .
588;Lastly, the numerous plot twists, including what turns out to be at least two false endings by my count, keep you on the edge of your seat.
589;Okay, it does drag the film's running time to well over the 2 hour mark, but it ties all the loose ends up very nicely and provides a satisfying ending.
590;type action, all sorts of nifty futuristic technologies and special effects, the star power of Tom Cruise, and the direction of Steven Spielberg.
591;Given all that, this movie was virtually guaranteed to please audiences, and it does not disappoint.
592;In the world of Minority Report, set in 2054, privacy has basically disappeared.
593;Things are going very well .
594;His friends and coworkers now face the unusual task of going after one of their own, and Anderton proves himself quite difficult to catch.
595;"i thought the ending of the movie was superb
596;If you like action and dazzling special effects, you'll find that here in spades, but those who crave an intelligent story behind all the bells and whistles will be doubly pleased by this film.
597;Apart from the heart of the story itself, Minority Report provides food for thought that you may still be chewing on days later .
598;Tom Cruise turns in another sterling performance, and his character is remarkably human and complex, as the loss of his son six years earlier and the problems he continues to have adjusting to that loss make of him an incredibly human type of hero.
599;I should also mention the fact that the film boasts several very funny scenes, serving to release the viewer's tension momentarily .
600;that's a good thing because things get pretty tense as the story progresses and you'll want to be mentally ready for the twists waiting for you around the final few bends.
601;the movie itself runs almost two and a half hours, and a second disc features an impressive number of featurettes examining the origins of this first Cruise.
602;spielberg project, the making of the film, and somewhat technical looks at the special effects that bring the world of 2054 to vivid life on the screen.
603;fi is hard to find and for those who love the genre (and love a decent mystery), Minority Report is a fine place to start.
604;For that you'll have to see the second disc.
605;For such a noted director and actor in a well.
606;This is definatly one of Cruise' best and my favorite of Spielberg's after A. i. Minority Report is snappy, fun and intriguing as Cruise fights to break the rules and find the murderer of his son, and the man who he is supposed to kill.
607;spielberg is a genus, and he weaves and tells this story like the best of them.
608;So sit back and enjoy, and let the master take you away into his world.
609;The movie has an engaging plot but the vision of the future it captures is the real star here.
610;The movie alternates between heavy themes and light hearted almost quirky humor.
611;I found these humorous elements a little out of place and inconsistant with the rest of the film however they do serve to lighten the tone after an intense sequence and give the viewer a chance to relax.
612;overall, definitely worth watching if you haven't.
613;Hold up over time very very well.
614;Sure, the special fx are fun to watch, but nothing ground.
615;The acting is good, great in some cases.
616;The film does succeed on the whole.
617;I found the revelation and the point of the film anticlimactic.
618;It's the cinematic equivalent of Japanese food: looks nice, smells nice, goes down easy, and 15 minutes later you'll be hungry again.
619;flop """"A. i."""", """"Minority Report"""" has already been done better, faster, smarter, and wiser: see """"Blade Runner"""" for the soul."""
620;Because it has a singularly impressive, very nasty sick joke, played (best of all) on Tom Cruise.
621;"I love Peter Stormare: I usually relish his insanity, and in ""Minority Report"" he's in top form."
622;That alone earns the flick gets one star.
623;tom Cruise does is spot.
624;Samantha Morton (Agatha) is spot.
625;op, and proves girls just wanna have fun.
626;colin Farrel (Detective Witwer) is spot.
627;Max Von Sydow (Director Burgess) is spot.
628;nails soldier, but does get a wild ride up to the top of the city with Tom Cruise, which is more than most can say.
629;The futuristic Lexus Mark.12 is spot.
630;again, it looks really pretty on a high.
631;The film climaxes in several places and really has a good pace up to the part where Cruise gets his eyes replaced.
632;"The Matrix and ""Logan's Run"" tell similar stories with much more panache."
633;This is an amazing movie, and I just can't get enough of it.
634;fi films, and thinking movie with some suspense, then I would definately recommend this film.
635;It has ind=credible acting, great story telling, and splendid special effects!
636;It's smart enough to make you think yet packed with enough action to keep you on your toes.
637;fi world this movie portrays is also really immersive and cool.
638;time favorite actor, he does a great job in this one.
639;"fi movies have been), ""Minority Report"" is one of my favorite sci."
640;With excellent direction and visuals by Steven Spielberg along with great acting by Tom Cruise, Samantha Morton, and others, it's an enjoyable movie for all.
641;The story provides some interesting questions about life on a basic level, as well as what direction technology is headed.
642;Witwer digs up dirt on Anderton, discovering that he's into some illegal drugs, likely as a result of the disappearance of his son years ago.
643;Things get truly complicated for Anderton when the pre.
644;Still, the acting is great and the effects are stunning at times.
645;There are chases which get you on the edge of your seat.
646;It is an entertaining mix of action, science fiction, and crime drama.
647;I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested at all in any of those genres.
648;"A film of which the 2nd highest critical compliment is ""neat"" and the better."
649;Roger Ebert called this the best film of 2002 and I am hard.
650;Freed from having to make a film that had to live up to the expectations of the late Stanley Kubrick, Spielberg made a film that contained his own personal vision but in some ways is informed by the lessons he learned from Kubrick.
651;The cinematography, art direction, and special effects are all top.
652;Cruise is excellent and is equalled by Samantha Morton, who plays one of the pre.
653;There is a great supporting cast here with Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell, and Kathryn Morris.
654;The story has twists and turns that make sense and result in a satisfying conclusion.
655;Minority Report definitely ranks as one of Spielberg's crowning achievements.
656;I, on the other hand, found it to be astonishingly entertaining, well.
657;"It is packed with great stuff from beginning to end: the detailed future mileau
658;Throw in a great cast including Colin Ferrel and the incomparable Max Von Sydow and the result is pure magic.
659;The important thing is to hang in there and the pieces will all start to fit together.
660;This is another one of those original story lines and takes the viewer on a wild ride.
661;fortunately the pieces begin to all fit together and do so with dramatic use of the surround speakers and plenty of action on screen.
662;The basic premise of the movie is a technology has developed that permits the viewing of a crime before it actually happens so police can step in and stop the crime before it has taken place.
663;His search for the truth provides the basis for this exciting action movie.
664;i encourage the viewer to give the movie a chance because although at first it might seem confusing it quickly shapes up into a good sci.
665;What do you get when you team one of the world's most bankable actors with the greatest director alive today?
666;In the case of Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg, the result is """"Minority Report"""", a thrilling and intriguing crime drama which will most certainly become a sci."""
667;free for six years, thanks to the implementaion of Pre.
668;This was undoubtedly the best film I saw in 2002(and I saw quite a few).
669;I never particularly cared for most of his other performances, but he is remarkably good in this film.
670;And Spielberg demonstates why he is the greatest director of the last 30 years.
671;"Yes, he's had some misses(""1941"", ""Always"", ""A. i.:Artificial Intelligence""), but as with all hs great films, he can thrill you one moment, elicit a laugh the next, even scare the pants off you, but his best films are the ones you talk about afterwards."
672;What's most surprising is the film's rating.
673;notch acting and a fascinating story, which is hard to come by in a lot of films these days.
674;By the year 2054, humanity.
675;all is going smoothly for pre.
676;the story, although a tad long, runs smoothly, and the special effects are simply superb.
677;overall, a highly recommended movie about the perils of short.
678;Tom Cruise and company really deliver the goods in this one.
679;The action keeps you jumping throughout, and the mind of PKD is evident throughout.
680;This film is the ultimate tribute to Phillip K. Dick's imagination, phobias and genius.
681;He has full confidence in his boss (Max Von Sydow) who assures the American citizens of 2054 that the system is perfect and innocent people are never wrongly convicted.
682;She is brilliant and almost alone salvages the tiring story line.
683;The great director likely now has two major failures in a row.
684;Minority Report earns only four stars, and not the five a box office success must have.
685;I thought Minority Report was great.
686;But if you want a creative, well made, and thought provoking film, watch Minority Report.
687;Steven Spielberg's Minority Report is one of his greatest films.
688;It is a triumph of story and storytelling, a dark and futuristic film noir that is both wildly entertaining and satisfyingly thoughtful.
689;"Tom Cruise gives one of his very best performances to date as a ""pre."
690;Roger Ebert named this the best film of 2002 and with good reason.
691;Minority Report is essential viewing.
692;In the past, Spielberg was well.
693;known for delivering two kinds of movie: the (often sappy) feel.
694;good movie like E. t. and the dark, devastating film like Schindler's List.
695;Lately, he has begun to mature as a director/producer with offerings that give the viewer more variety.
696;Minority Report is one of those films.
697;the gist of the movie can be explained simply.
698;The secret behind the success of Pre.
699;The comedy in some of the darkest scenes works well as both relief and set.
700;Minority Report contains some major holes, but all in all, comes off as an entertaining and, more importantly, original story.
701;The characterization is surprisingly detailed for a sci.
702;The acting is generally solid, and the cinematography often above.
703;Minority Report is an excellent choice for both teens and adults, especially for those who like a thrill with their flicks.
704;I got a chance to check this film out at a sneak preview and I can't tell you enough good things about it.
705;It was truly everything that you could have hoped for.
706;The action is amazing and the futuristic world that Spielburg has realized is beyond description.
707;I am so excited for the regular release date so that I can go and check this movie out again.
708;note, everybody knows this movie is based on the Philip K. Dick short story, but there was an additional credit at the end of the film citing certain ideas from the novel Glorious Failure by Ben Jonjak.
709;I have subsequently checked this book out and it has also really blown my mind.
710;Tom Cruise is John Anderton, Washington D. c.'s top.
711;The premise sounds wonderful until John discovers he's about to murder someone he has never met.
712;What lies beneath the story is much deeper and darker.You see, even in knowing the future, Mr. Anderton is confronted with an awful dilemma.
713;minority Report is a dark and disturbing vision of the future made believable with Cruise's much more human characterization of Anderton than his previous Mission Impossible persona.
714;The action scenes are impressive and appropriate, but one particular scene in the LEXUS factory contained so much eyeball.
715;Instead, Spielberg shows he's master of the technology as the impressive display of visuals serve to add to, not overwhelm the story.
716;There was a nice plot, a great story, and a fresh idea to Minority Report.
717;The collaboration between Spielberg and Cruise promises top.
718;notch entertainment and emerges unexpectedly as this year's most audacious science fiction that is beyond categorization.
719;It is a resonant cautionary tale to explore on topics like original sin and privacy issues.
720;Minority Report sees Spielberg at the zenith of his visions, fusing sprawling sets of sleek designs to compliment the galanizing action that sees Anderton fleeing through whizzing Lexus in vertical highways.
721;Probably his best performance to date, Tom Cruise lends emotional depth and grit under his brooding exterior.
722;Minority Report is provocative and slyly humorous in its hidden entrende of Pre.
723;This is Spielberg's extension of A. i with unfettered creativity, pitch.
724;perfect technicality and balanced senitmentality to submit a report card that would definitely please the majority.
725;This is destined to become a classic sci.
726;very entertaining and a bit horrifying on several levels.
727;Very creative futuristic sci fi thriller.
728;I always like to see how some directors picture the future and Spielberg always delivers.
729;His ideas about how people are tracked in the future and how cars may function and the way he presents everything down to the last detail are all plausible and seamless.
730;I enjoyed watching this movie for the third time and will watch it again in the future.
731;I recommend seeing it just for the visuals.
732;Go see it if you like Spielberg.
733;Go see it if you like Sci.
734;Well, it's one of the best sci.
735;fi movies of the past years and Spielberg redeemed himself after A. i.
736;The story is good, photography is really neat, and the film just grasps you attention.
737;I was surprised by what a good job Steven Spielberg did directing past Tom Cruise's overstuffed ego, and I thought the dystopian sci.
738;fi future he came up with was kind of interesting, but ultimately this didn't really hang together that well.
739;Visually, this had its fine points, but again, I felt like the direction was a little too loose.
740;I did enjoy Spielberg's small, goofy slapstick moments, though.
741;It was great to see a big, mega.
742;blockbuster filmmaker still able to pause and take time out for a well.
743;The future looks solid for all you budding musical conductors out there.
744;It was interesting stuff, then promptly discarded for the next chase scene.
745;tom Cruise, as usual, is solid as Precrime Detective John Anderton, an enthusiastic proponent of hauling people away before they commit murder until he himself is the target of a relentless manhunt by his former colleagues.
746;Sure, there's plenty of heart.
747;It is first the only good picture since A. i. I disliked every movie I watched this year, only Panic Room was not too bad but Minority Report like A. i. is a greatly shot motion picture.
748;Everything is first class in the film, music by Williams creates a suspenseful and dark future atmosphere and tension like Herrmann did in Hitchcock movies.
749;Kaminski's colours and lights are again extraordinary like in A. i., Kahn's editing is on its top since Saving Private Ryan, but I especially liked the editing on this one since there are some scenes with such a good montage which carry a lot of suspense and power mostly because of their montage.
750;The story is really strong.
751;I didn't read the short story of K. Dick but I'm sure Spielberg added some humour and some more action to the film just to make sure that the film makes some box office.
752;That 15 minute interval is a perfect example of filmmaking and all that time I never blinked.
753;Every single frame in those 15 minutes is amazingly well shot and edited.
754;And off course the beginning of the movie with the first rescue is great and the screen fades to black with a vision of Agatha in the water.
755;That 15 minutes is also a masterpiece on its own.
756;Those scenes are definitely mood.
757;breakers in the middle of 2 serious scenes and I believe that they were put for the box office there.
758;He finds himself inside of a car being built and then escapes with that car to Hineman.
759;Anyway, in general the movie is good.
760;The best since A. i. but I like A. i. more since it had less moodbreaker scenes than this one.
761;I hope Catch Me If You Can will feature a more serious mood than this one.
762;Some of the effects are really cool to look at, but the mixture of mod.
763;Also, the story is pretty pedestrian in spite of it's excellent premise.
764;Anyway, it's fun to look at for the first 90 of its' 225 minutes.
765;I gave this item as a gift, and the recipient was delighted to receive the item.
766;The look of the movie works for me.
767;satisfyingly) addressed, and he eyeball.
768;This starts with a scene ripped right from LA Confidential and is propelled forward by the old killer.
769;Fine and good, except that up until that point she hadn't seen the killer's face.
770;star classic through the first 90 minutes.
771;pocus will turn into comic hocus.
772;This is a great movie!
773;I'm impressed, not only is this movie action packed, but it has a well developed plot.
774;This movie presents an interesting vision of the future.
775;Good character interaction and great special effects make this movie very engaging and fun to watch.
776;Some interesting extras if you realy like the movie and want to know more about the creative process behind it.
777;All in all, a good use of a couple hours.
778;I usually don't care for Tom Cruise but for this film he was a beautiful fit.
779;fi background about a crime prevention program but it really is a who.
780;There are a multitude of people with motive but very few with the means to do so.
781;It was well put together.
782;You could watch the film on numerous occasions and keep it with a core group of films in your collection for the household.
783;Most people interested in this film are already familiar with the plot, so I'll mention something about the actual writer, Phillip Kindred Dick.
784;He told a writer from Rolling Stone he thought the government was involved in the break in.
785;What an imagination this guy has!
786;I saw this movie in thetheater, and thought it was really cool.
787;A world withoutmurder, someday maybe.
788;A couple of parts will make youjump out of your seat!
789;Steven Spielberg's direction is tight and dramatic, the actors all do excellent jobs, and the one downside is the lackluster fight scenes.
790;His faith in it is absolute, even when the justice of it is questioned by a clever young auditer, Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell).
791;"And who has set him up?You can't really have a story about knowing the future without delving into the whole ""free will vs. determinism"" debate ."
792;and while obviously it can't answer them entirely, it wraps the story in twists and double.
793;twists that swing it both ways.
794;spielberg's direction is tight, sleek and fast.
795;moving, and he tosses in casually cruel touches (the eye.
796;He also shows that he's pretty amazing at making a murder mystery, twisting together some seemingly unconnected murders with a truly plausible precog.
797;as for Cruise, he's pretty good here.
798;honestly, I was more intrigued by Colin Farrell's subtle performance as Danny Witwer .
799;a quiet, religious, intense man whose sense of justice is needled by the existence of PreCrime, and whose hunt for Anderton makes him realize that there's more going on here.
800;And there's a ring of other excellent performances .
801;Minority Report is a solid, sleek action movie draped in a mantle of philosophical ponderings, and only the clumsy action sequences bog it down.
802;Spouse really enjoyed this movie.
803;Good story and good plot.
804;Minority Report, Steven Spielberg's latest film, takes place in the year 2054.
805;cogs, a trio who float in liquid, and who can see murders that are destined to occur.
806;The system appears to be foolproof and Anderton is a dedicated and hard.
807;working chief who believes that his unit does an excellent and necessary job.
808;crime system is faulty, before he is caught and put away for good.
809;tom Cruise turns in his usual solid and intense performance as a man driven by desperation and fear to uncover the truth.
810;The supporting performers are all fine, with the lovely Samantha Morton especially touching as the most insightful of the Pre.
811;There is a terrific cameo by Lois Smith, who plays Dr. Hineman, the scientist who accidentally created the Pre.
812;major kudos go to Janusz Kaminski, the great cinematographer, and to the production and set designers.
813;The look of the movie is spectacular, with a mixture of high.
814;Spielberg wisely tempers his dystopian view of the future with some welcome humor.
815;Cruise pours cereal from a box that has animated advertising and he takes a walk through a shopping mall in which the lively ads address each person by name.
816;John Williams's fine score provides excellent background music for the movie, especially during the more frightening sequences.
817;The beginning of the movie is enormously original, clever, funny and intriguing.
818;After the first viewing of Minority Report I loved it.
819;After a second viewing I liked it.
820;One of the fundamental rules of fantasy and science fiction is when you establish the rules of the world you're creating you owe it to your audience to stick to those rules.
821;I'll compromise and give it four.
822;Argubly one of the best sci.
823;fi stories made to film since Blade Runner and 2001: A Space Odyssey, Minority Report features the main theme to be questioned .
824;cogs are the driving force behind the concept backed up by solid technology of the mid 21st century.
825;crime division has become a subject of fascination and debate among top scientists in the world as well as those in the government law.
826;this is Cruise and Spielberg's first collaboration ever .
827;While the novella presents the overall outline and concept of the story, filmmakers expanded the scope by putting in noir, mystery elements with a personal character driven.
828;And the story has evolved a lot more better than its novella due to pre.
829;production values were high here from its designs to visuals as well as to its convincing acting and sounds/music.
830;held, they are part of artistic reasons .
831;eye fans of Kubrick's films would be happy to see several moments that serves as homages to Kubrick.
832;nonetheless, it's a great sci.
833;It's worth the watch, even though it's a lengthy 150 minute feature.
834;just watch it and be immersed with the future.
835;"spielbergian qualities mainly come from the fact that ""Minority Report"" is based on a short story by the heavyweight postmodern writer Phillip K. Dick, who also wrote the book from which the classic existentialist."
836;and true to form, Spielberg doesn't disappointment.
837;Spielberg gets to go beserk with all sorts of technological gizmos since this film is of course set in the future, and there are a couple of somewhat original action/fight scenes to keep us entertained throughout.
838;Oh well, at least Spielberg didn't excrete another God.
839;Spielberg, ever the filmmaker to elicit responses of profound negativity or unabashed glee depending on which side of the artsy line you stood on, has shown why is the master of entertainment cinema.
840;But Spielberg fingerprints are all over this thing.
841;surgery and you'll be squirming and writhing more than you thought you would.
842;On the acting side, Tom Cruise gives a wonderful performance and you really start to forget its Tom Cruise, which I never thought I would do in his films.
843;Samantha Morton is wonderful and memorable as the Pre.
844;cog Agatha, she has an ethereal presence thats kind of hard to explain.
845;The supporting actors are all excellent too, especially Colin Farrell who really gets to show why he was labeled a big up.
846;top which seems to plaque quite a bit of Hollywood these days.
847;Scott Frank's screenplay is rife with lines of wit and coolness, although a few cliches pop up here and there, but its hardly something to get worked up about.
848;out, it makes sense with the screenplay and it keeps with the tone of the movie, so I don't find it sugary or cheesy.
849;dreams, but its still interesting to note.
850;"MINORITY REPORT is the kind of film I feel impelled to say I enjoyed: (1) its directed by Steven Spielberg, who arguably is always at the top of his game
851;laden chase sequences are eye candy to behold (it is Spielberg, after all), and Cruise does stretch his acting beyond his usual aplomb (it is Tom Cruise, after all).
852;The supporting cast goes largely unused"
853;What makes Minority Report so great?
854;It's all of these rolled into an enjoyable summer movie package.
855;Not only does it look phenominal, but it provides an extremely great mix of action and food for thought.
856;Not a great summer movie, a great movie period.
857;thought this futuristic take on controlling crime was very interesting and kept you on the edge.
858;tom cruise does a great job.
859;Think about the Fugitive, they always comes back to familiar territory.2.
860;The movie is enjoyable but no more than a popcorn movie.
861;what I liked about this movie was the eerie, melancholy way it was.
862;This was one excellent film.
863;Great acting, great script, great dialogue, sweet action scenes, and of course great directing.
864;I just loved the look and feel of Minority Report.
865;This is a really good story.
866;Cruise and Farrell do a wonderful job and the effects are excellent without being over done.
867;Spielberg and Cruise participate in a film that I enjoyed watching?
868;old could love, he comes along and spins a fairly dark and intelligent version of a Philip K. Dick story.
869;How do you get to the root of social ills?You can tell that Spielberg did is homework on this one.
870;it is this world .
871;i heartily recommend this film to all fans of science fiction or good old.
872;It's a real visual and auditory treat seeing this on a big screen.
873;If not for Fox's 24 (yes, the television series), Minority Report would probably be my choice for (so far) the best thriller of the decade.
874;Pretty hefty statement, I realize, but Minority Report's a pretty hefty movie, one that plays as an innovative mix of futuristic sci.
875;crime division (just how it's done is revealed in a very clever and tense opening sequence).
876;cogs' latest vision displays a pre.
877;"Going on the run, Anderton struggles to escape his old teammates and discover the truth behind this vision
878;It's nice to see he's never dissuaded (or influenced) by such complaints, he's a filmmaker who's always crafted his films with a touch of confidence and genuine emotion that few directors could even hope to achieve in decades worth of work (in case you can't tell, I'm a Spielberg fan, meaning I've just incurred the wrath of David Lynch lovers).
879;spielberg's work here is, right off the bat, much unlike anything I've ever seen him do.
880;It's a chilling, daring intro that holds a lot of promise, and instead of disappointing, the rest of the film actually manages to improve upon it.
881;the future that Spielberg presents here is entirely believable, from both a societal and technological viewpoint.
882;Finally, we get a film that features a dark view of the future, but simultaneously gives us reasonable, intelligent characters that realize there are pros and cons to everything.
883;The emotional baggage is handled mostly by Tom Cruise, who does quite an admirable job"
884;wise, the film is on solid ground with a few admittedly major stumbles.
885;One of the movie's narrative burners is the move to make Pre.
886;But for those who do get caught up in this twisty tale (and that should apply to most people), Minority Report offers a lot of rewards, more than you could reasonably expect from a big.
887;"While such a statement works to an extent for A. i., Report is mostly about morals, accepted ethics, and an intriguing look on just how far people are willing to go for their own survival in this ""winner takes all"" society."
888;the technology was really cool, acting was well done, and the story line was superb.
889;entertaining as a movie should be
890;This is the best film of 2002.
891;Steven Spielberg took us farther into film noir than ever before, and we are left with one of his best works ever.
892;"This film is wonderfully shot through Spielberg's imagination of what the D. c. area would look like in 2054, and surpasses Jaws for the most frightening Spielberg moment ever with the scene involving Anderton and the ""precog"" Agatha, played superbly by Samantha Morton."
893;Minority Report is a futuristic thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat from the get go.
894;Tom Cruise delivers in the action department while the plot of the film is very unique and suspenseful.
895;controlled computer system makes you so hungry for what future technology is going to be capable of.
896;This movie is a must see.
897;One can never underestimate director Steven Spielberg's ability to reinvent himself as a filmmaker.
898;violent 1990 smash TOTAL RECALL and Ridley Scott's 1982 cult masterpiece BLADE RUNNER.
899;Tom Cruise stars as the top cop of an elite anti.
900;under Spielberg's always inventive direction, Cruise is sharp as the beleagured cop trying to get out of his most complicated fix.
901;"Samantha Morton is also quite good as the ""pre."
902;"cog"" known as Agatha, and the legendary Max von Sydow scores as Cruise's boss and mentor who has a stake in seeing Pre."
903;"A film that deftly puts elements of the crime and psychological thriller film genres into its futuristic science fiction brew, MINORITY REPORT is a film that, like Spielberg's previous film A. i., may very well require more than one viewing
904;But it is well worth seeing!
905;and not just that, Minority Report is actually quite an intelligent film, if you would ask me.
906;While Tom Cruise is not my favorite actor, he does look good in the film, that's all.
907;It's Colin Farrel who makes this film brilliant.
908;And the actress who plays the female pre.
909;cog (the psychic) has lots of brilliant moments in this film.
910;a good film, but not one that would become a classic in years to come.
911;Seemed futuristic years ago, but it's pretty believable now.
912;This is another one of those movies where it starts well, and builds up and builds up and builds up only to crash the whole thing in 10.30 seconds at the end.
913;the ending was absolutely stupid and ruined the whole movie for me, but up to that point, it was entertaining so it's worth watching.
914;He's turned into a very good actor, indeed and this movie is no exception.
915;this movie is 100% excellent entertainment and overwhelming special effects, with a very good plot too!
916;This Department has succeeded in ending crimes, because they capture criminals(.
917;excellent performances too by Samantha Morton (as the only female """"precog""""), who, among other movies, previously had excelled in a 1990's british version of the classic """"Jane Eyre"""""
918;"i liked this movie very much, as Spielberg's previous ""A. i."" it's sci."
919;fi of very good level.
920;I know a good movie when I see one.
921;and to those of you who think this is one of the best movies you've ever seen, you need to see more movies.
922;I can't imagine someone like Spielberg actually read this and thought it would make a good movie.
923;the movie itself coolly transports viewers to a world 52 years ahead .
924;so cutting edge and visually startling that they seem right out of the movie itself.
925;Director Spielberg has his say on the second (single layer) disc, which has a generous selection of bonus materials that are well organized and to the point.
926;comes across with all of its unsettling power.
927;The cobalt blues saturate the images, evoking the specter of a locked.
928;The chilling subwoofer bottom keeps listeners on edge.
929;the featurette compilation opens and closes with Spielberg and Cruise exchanging superlatives (the package actually has a beginning, middle and end).
930;Spielberg talks about how A. i. and Minority Report fit into his midlife vision quest.
931;wisely, most of the extras focus on the effects wizards and craftsmen who realized this future world.
932;I enjoy the plot twists and paranoia of a PKD story.
933;Cruise did a believable job.
934;It has an actual plot.
935;A frightening vision of a possible future, and great entertainment.
936;'Minority Report' by Philip K. Dick is my all time favorite story.
937;I also really enjoy this movie, although a lot was added and changed in this film.
938;In some ways, some of the changes and additions actually added to the story.
939;tom Cruise comes off as a really smooth John Anderton and Colin Farrel does a good Whitwer.
940;The movie doesn't drag at all and the pace of excitement is constant and good throughout the film.
941;the special effects of the film are incredible.
942;cogs, the film really does bring the story to life.
943;And the music performed by John Williams only adds to the setting.
944;This is some of the best music I have heard from Williams.
945;overall, a great movie that I think most fans of Dick's book/short story will enjoy.
946;I did and I'm a huge fan of the real story by Philip.
947;He is without talent but highly motivated in true 'semina' style.
948;It's always fun to watch Cruise 'focus' with studied artlessness like he does on the cyber.
949;Goodness, what a great plot device.
950;Spielberg subjects us to a premature, over.
951;impose it, especially with it's obsession with freedom and civil rights.
952;I long for an old fashioned cowboy film with that fiery old horse that nobody can ride until, well, you know.
953;special effects, action, drama, thriller, who done it, suspense and futuristic scenery and ideas.
954;Not my favourite movie, but interesting, and rather eerie.
955;`Precrime', as it is called is, enthusiastically implemented by Captain John Anderton, and seems a pretty good thing, until it proves open to corruption and tampering to make the innocent look guilty and the guilty look innocent.
956;exciting, and brilliant vision of the future down to its details.
957;High Definition lets you see the film as it was intended by the filmmakers.
958;This wipes the image so that it is smooth and waxy.
959;Minority Report is intended and was shot to have a gritty feel, hence the grain.
960;This creates an emotional impact that informs the story and the characters.
961;Colors are fully accurate and resolved.
962;Blacks are inky and detail is gorgeous, making the special effects all the more dazzling.
963;This is one of the films I have been waiting to see in this format and it exceeded my expectations.
964;best I've ever seenpremise .
965;Minority Report definitely ranks as one of the best future.
966;theme movies of all time.
967;Although not as groundbreaking as The Matrix or visually stunning as Blade Runner, it has it's own pro's.
968;the storyline for the movie is interesting, very thought provoking.
969;Listen even more closely and you'll understand the entire movie, otherwise you will be lost.
970;Minority Report is definitely worth the price of admission.
971;This film is complicated, but is much more of an action movie than the latter are.
972;Minority Report has many chilling scenes, many great ideas, but it moves like a classic action thriller/mystery.
973;provoking and sytlish, and just shy of being a sci.
974;This is a great film.
975;The plot takes a few times watching to fully understand, but is very ingenious.
976;The movie presents some very accurate ideas of the future and the story has nothing that would make absolutely no sense or just couldn't happen.
977;The special effects are so real.
978;Some really neat special features.
979;Please Hollywood just make a good movie again!
980;sydow make great performances in this sci.
981;Excellent action sequences, great story line, exciting chases and DTS digital surround sound.
982;This looks and sounds great (for us Hi.
983;This film puts you on the edge from the opening scenes.
984;This storyline is fully tricked out, and takes you on a roller.
985;the film is set about 50 years into the future and the transport systems are way cool, and include: complex auto tranport systems, jet back packs and hover craft type military transporters.
986;this is a top notch sci.
987;fi thriller and it's loaded with high.
988;end special effects, but the stroyline also packs a great punch.
989;It is Spielberg self parody.
990;Very good movie,I couldn't relax the whole movie.
991;Very clever story, I would recommend this movie to people who like action or sci.
992;I agree with most of the other people who rated the content of this movie.
993;par, especially by today's standards.
994;I have yet to view the new release, but I did thoroughly enjoy the inovative stle of the not to far future, and love any type of science fiction,or future that lies ahead!
995;It will be a treat when I find the time to view this wonderful film.
996;The story here is as gripping as every earth based sci.
997;Grounded in reality, Spielberg masterfully brings to life an undeniably stunning vision.
998;And, it's even better on blu.
999;I can't speak for the special features, but it's a film with a strong message, which makes it all the more interesting to watch.
1000;It will remain in my top five sci.
1001;"Steven Spielberg's masterful use of special effects in this futuristic film is not the slightest bit distracting because the effects are not where he places the film's focus
1002;powered car into an apartment perfectly illustrates this, as his defiance of both death and authority at high altitude conclude in arrival, partially upside.
1003;That all of this is done without dialogue perfectly illustrates Spielberg's craft.
1004;Watch this film, and perhaps you, too, could agree with Roger Ebert that this was the best film of 2002.
1005;Spielberg was """"keeping it real""""."""
1006;up common to Spielberg's films, I loved the mystery and the paranoia that he interwove into the story.
1007;along the way we are introduced to an entirely believable future vision of a society that has paid a large price for security.
1008;Ah, a Spielburg movie that makes you think a little, and one that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
1009;tom Cruise is tremendous, as are his supporting cast and the effects and detailed environments of the future Spielburg has envisioned.
1010;And that notion drives the film and draws you in.
1011;The characters are dynamic and the story is full of twists and turns, keeping the viewer involved and the reaction of the crowd I viewed it with reflects that.
1012;a wonderful Spielburg film and certainly one of his very best.
1013;At some point you just quit analyzing every little bit of logic in the film and enjoy it for what it is, a great movie.
1014;This is one of Tom Cruise's last good movies.
1015;so it happens now in our 'real' world.
1016;"if u like CG/SFX, I recommend:""Johnny Mnemonic"" ."
1017;The bottom line is, good special effects for free and a few interesting scenes like the chase in the car factory, other than that I can watch commercials at home on my TV for free.
1018;Wow, did I have high hopes for this one!
1019;It had a cool trailer (that was consistently shoved down moviegoers' throats over and over again), an excellent cast, over.
1020;top special effects, a seemingly awesome story, and a director who gave us some of the film industry's most beloved classics.
1021;it's so subtle at first that it's hard to even realize.
1022;ray player does a decent job of upscaling standard definition movies.
1023;if you are a home theater sound purist, perhaps the Dolby and DTS Surround Sound will make it worth your upgrade.
1024;ray addition is with the Extra Features.
1025;Minority report is the best science fiction film.
1026;The actors act very well !
1027;It's one of the best movie I ever seen !
1028;This is exactly what you can expect from Spielberg.
1029;A good science fiction movie with good thrills and a very creative plot.
1030;Tom Cruise is part of thi police and the movie first introduces this system.
1031;What's interesting is the neat jetpacks by the cops and also, when the person is arrested.
1032;The movie is powerful with some great thrills, action scenes, and a neat look into the future.
1033;Minority Report is a great futuristic thriller.
1034;The blu ray disc features stunning detail and colors from beginning to end.
1035;Tom Cruise is great as a crime prevention detective, who is framed and gets involved in uncovering a conspiracy.
1036;Max von Sydow, Samantha Morton also provide great performances.
1037;fi movie does an interesting take on law enforcement in the future.
1038;How this character eludes his capture and investigates the actual crime makes for an interesting and exciting story!
1039;An older movie but fantastic to watch in Blu.
1040;if you want to see it, watch it, you may enjoy it.
1041;This helped to reintrouduce a movie that was once popular in the 70's to a younger generation such as myself with a few added twists and plots.
1042;Tom Cruise did a very good job playing this role and making it exactly what it should be.
1043;The plot and action was very well done and the whole concept of stoping future crimes and events just play with your thoughts a bit about the real future and where we will be.
1044;"With an opening sequence of intense quick cuts and camera movements, it was obviously going to be an exciting show
1045;Minority Report is a fun movie to watch.
1046;The action is nicely down and is a true representation of Steven Spielberg's directive abilities, and the plot is intriguing and touching.
1047;the world of Minority Report is of the year 2054, and it looks just like the world would look like then.
1048;high homicide rate in the District of Columbia.
1049;Astonished, he races against the clock to discover the truth behind what happened and the truth behind the system.
1050;What's really going on behind.
1051;The plot moves relentlessly and with intelligence and drama.
1052;It explores the psychological aspects of humanity, and comes out with a touching, emotional experience to support the main story.
1053;She gets a vision of the son's possible future if he was alive.
1054;It's very touching, and the way it ties into the main story is really neat.
1055;That's not saying it's bad"
1056;The action is built more of suspense than visuals too.
1057;the special effects are good, and are used mostly for the big.
1058;The audio is done nicely, especially the music.
1059;like, yet fits the action very well.
1060;the acting in this movie is surprisingly good.
1061;Tom Cruise does soem very fine work here, and Colin Farrel rarely gets better.
1062;The rest of the cast potrays their characters very well.
1063;overall, this is probably one of Spielberg's best films and definitely his best sci.
1064;"Although one note: this is not a kid's movie definitely
1065;I always love a good Stephen Spielberg movie, and this is another great addition.
1066;The suspense throughout the movie, the plot is wonderfully done.
1067;the twists in happenings keeps you on your toes and wondering.
1068;Tom Cruise also does a fantastic job at acting as normal.
1069;he is the dark and mysterious character we all know and love.
1070;who works in the Department of Precime in Washington D. c. which uses people with the gift of precognition to prevent murders before they happen.
1071;I found this to be a quite excellent film, with an intelligent plot, first.
1072;rate protagonist played by Tom Cruise and a wonderfully realised future world (the special effects really are something else).
1073;Spielberg is as usual in his element when making science fiction and this film is even better than the outstanding `A. i. Artificial Intelligence' which he made the year before.
1074;A flawless combination of exceptional story telling and science fiction vision that is quite simply film.
1075;Minority Report got a whole bunch of positive press, and it's the sort of movie that, in production values alone, basically couldn't fail to get at least a """"thumb up"""" from the average reviewer."""
1076;"to give you one example: the ""pre."
1077;"cogs"" in the movie can, as a team, see the future ."
1078;"They can only ""see"" events that are exceptionally wrenching or emotional ."
1079;A chase movie with lots of flashy action.
1080;"We get a ""fight in a factory"" sequence in which the good guy leaps in and out of the machinery."
1081;I thought of that theme music, even, during the movie.
1082;For the same reason lots of people really, really love Blade Runner.
1083;The world Spielberg created in this movie is lavishly done.
1084;But the movie's worth watching, if you happen to have a chance, because the world is interesting to poke around in.
1085;When I saw the trailer I thought it was going to be a cool film.
1086;The visuals in this film are very good but the plot is very dark.
1087;the acting from Cruise was good.
1088;I think he does a fine job and the other members of the cast also good but you don't really see much of them.
1089;If you are into the dark future stuff then this film will be fine.
1090;This is very interesting action movie.
1091;And what about a little better attention to the details.
1092;He loves action adventure movies and this delivered.
1093;He is also a Tom Cruise fan.
1094;Minority Report, based on a mediocre short.
1095;story by the very talented sci.
1096;fi writer Philip K. Dick, turns out to be a pretty good film with a fast pace, good special effects, and a twist and turn ending with at least one good surprise.
1097;It uses the original story only as a starting point, which is a good thing.
1098;Great script and plot here, and the scene with Cruise jumping from car to car on a vertical highway blew me away.
1099;Humanity has to plan its future in order to survive, hence it has to predict its future needs.
1100;It is, and has been, tempting to predict what and which indidviduals will become cirminals in order to prevent that crime.
1101;So let us put away those who have the crime genes.
1102;Steven Spielberg deals with this dilemma but based this time on a modern embodiment of the seers of old.
1103;The second is probably true.
1104;But it is a great film nevertheless that reveals this question of the future and its possible prediction is essential to man and humanity.
1105;I knew little about this movie going in and it was a very entertaining movie.
1106;It gets 5 stars from me simply because it was so entertaining not because it has some great message or should be considered a classic of American film.
1107;It was however one of the best action films I have seen in a while.
1108;The plot is gripping as events and evidence unfold and you progress with the main character.
1109;There were some solid actors in the film and I like to see so many lesser known supporting players.
1110;They did a terrific job.
1111;The effects were very well done.
1112;The technology was great in the film and very believable.
1113;The storyline itself was fresh and had nice twists.
1114;There was also a bit of humor in the film which was a nice touch.
1115;I think Tom Cruise is a good actor who sticks to what he knows best.
1116;his character here is a strong willed man great at his job who meets some conspiracy or hardship and has to overcome it while dealing with his personal demons.
1117;This movie is along the lines of Mission Impossible yet I found it to be much better.
1118;"No ""Blade Runner,"" ""Minority Report"" is far superior to ""Paycheck"" (the three are based on Philip K. Dick stories)."
1119;The formula goes like this: Cruise is a winner with a flaw.
1120;Cruise pulls himself together, emerges more of a winner than before and wins the girl.
1121;But it's not quite what happens here, and that's a good thing.
1122;"I've been a Cruise fan ever since ""Risky Business,"" which was one of my favorite movies during college, but I've also seen his flaws and wondered if he was set for the kind of lifetime career say a Paul Newman had or whether he'd eventually play out."
1123;"Bottom line: This movie is Cruise moving in a good direction, unlike the lamentable ""Vanilla Sky"" or ""Cocktail,"" both of which were low points."
1124;The spiders that read retinas are wonderful, especially the scene where we see them entering a series of apartments in the same building, interrupting various activities such as domestic fights and lovemaking, which is brilliant.
1125;agatha is wonderfully portrayed by Samantha Morton.
1126;Indeed Cruise and Morton are the best in the movie.
1127;i love the seeing/not seeing theme that continues throughout the movie.
1128;"It's Shakespearean, reminiscent of ""King Lear,"" in which one of the main characters only starts to see after his eyes are put out."
1129;Minority Report is an excellent film, with one of the greatest screenplays I've ever seen in a film.
1130;Well, watch Minority Report again, and you'll see that it's a work that deserves more than just 4 out of 5 stars.
1131;When you combine the amazing story by Phillip K Dick (Blade Runner), one of the worlds greatest directors Steven Spielberg and the one of the world's largest stars in Tom Cruise you'd imagine it would be a spectacle if nothing else.
1132;'Minority Report' comes so very close to being an amazing modern sci.

1136;minute roller coaster ride through some of the most amazing locales seen.
1137;the film is very classy.
1138;Fine script, great acting, good characterization and cinematography to take your breath away.
1139;Everything depicted is purely possible.
1140;This is attributed to Spielberg talking to a number of leading futurists before undertaking the film.
1141;the acting in the film is very good indeed.
1142;Through this we understand his loss and empathize with the action onscreen.
1143;This works to great effect.
1144;the single problem with the film is its need for a happy ending.
1145;'Minority Report' needs to be seen for all fans of Spielberg to see his new direction in his, well, direction.
1146;see it again and leave at the right moment, half.
1147;With Gattaca we see what happens when a movie's main draw is the science behind it, it doesnt make for a good story or film.
1148;The film is filled with many ideas, most of which are so plausible I shudder.
1149;Tom Cruise is terrific once again.
1150;The story is something fairly original, and unexpected.
1151;The acting is top notch, with performances by Cruise and Farrell that are pretty much the best they will ever do.
1152;The special effects are believable and fun to watch.
1153;This is an all around great sci.
1154;I classify it as a mix between Blade Runner and Dirty Harry.
1155;Minority Report has been well worth the wait.
1156;the visual effects for this film were simply incredible .
1157;This is definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a long time and would encourage anyone to go see it!
1158;the mood of the film really helps it in the end,though.
1159;tom cruise gives another underrated performance and spielberg shows off his expensive special effects (with good reason).
1160;add another good phillip k. dick adaptation to the list!
1161;Tom Cruise is an awfully weird fella and quite possibly a chump but for some reason he is great actor!
1162;The film explores the plot and the characters more than many so called 'Sci.
1163;"I enjoyed ""Minority Report"" a lot, but it wasn't exactly the epic masterpiece that everyone has lead me to believe it is."
1164;cruise is very good in this movie.
1165;He really does a nice job playing a character who's beliefs are shattered and who now has to try and disprove the very system he has staunchly defended.
1166;The other actors in this movie are also excellent and very nicely convey the storyline and the emotions involved in it.
1167;"the picture of the future that Spielberg paints is not quite as fantastic as it was in ""AI"", but it still is interesting to see."
1168;It sort of shows how public our information is becoming.
1169;The other effects are also very well done, although you'd think the machine that the Pre.
1170;There's a scene where Cruise is giving a government official a tour of the base and they get into a huge philosophical debate, even bringing the Bible into the mix.
1171;otherwise, it's an entertaining movie with a few plotholes (like why is his ex.
1172;photography,Dark utopic history and a superb action movieby Tom Cruise
1173;Like some of the other disappointed reviewers, I had high expectations of Minority Report going into the theater.
1174;Spielberg is given lots to work with.
1175;The concept of precrime has enormous potential, and I was interested in how Spielberg's vision of precrime could blow me away in the theaters.
1176;watching a movie like Pulp Fiction, 12 Monkeys or Memento, where events are seen out of order and pieced together until a full picture can be seen and appreciated, is far more satisfying than watching this film, in which events are seen out of order (through the Precogs) and pieced together to create a complete picture which could have never actually happened.
1177;so many films involving non.
1178;sequential events or time travel create a fascinating illusion of reality that bends and twists into a wonderful and satisfying conclusion that is unlike anything that could have been anticipated.
1179;It seems he blew what could have been a fantastic concept for a movie.
1180;Some of the effects are fun to watch, but you expect Spielberg to have had a much better handle on the plot.
1181;Directed by S. Spielberg, for adults rather than kids.
1182;Great actors, keeps you thinking.
1183;Almost good for the whole family.
1184;Great concept for a story.
1185;Good action with a purpose not senseless violence or vengeance.
1186;"Steve Spielberg, ""wonderkid"" of Hollywood brings his latest sci."
1187;fi/thriller opus to us this summer and it works as his best in the genre since Jurassic Park in making us be fascinated by character and plot while still getting some kicks from futuristic cars, pre.
1188;This movie is very captivating.
1189;(yeah i love getting right into the action).
1190;The latest from the master of film, Steven Spielberg, Minority Report is a very entertaining film.
1191;He has a certain amount of time before the pre.
1192;(This is a very, extremely, dumbed down version of the synopsis)Spielberg tried to draw on the film noir genre to make the film, and doing this definitely gave the film a much more dark feeling overall.
1193;There was a certain sense of mystery to the whole movie, and while it is fairly predictable who the villain is,(there are only a limited amount of main characters in the movie, which is why it is predictable) the ride to get to that point where the movie reveals the villain is altogether thrilling, and visually astonishing.
1194;The reason why the movie seemed action filled from beginning to end was really because Spielberg truly was able to convey a sense of excitement and intrigue through the dialogue.
1195;"It reminds me of what the movie ""The Beach"" wanted to be ."
1196;I disagree, as I felt the last part of the movie gave it that finishing touch that makes it even more film noir like.
1197;One of the scenes that perfectly illustrates this new Kubrickan Spielberg is one where a man in the movie has to chase after his own eyeballs, bouncing down a hallway .
1198;something that is sickeningly funny, and definitely a type of scene that was previously not part of Spielberg's film vocab.
1199;overall, Minority Report is a thoughtful thriller that definitely warrants at least one viewing.
1200;A great science fiction thriller is also one of Spielberg's strongest films.
1201;It earned four Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film and Best Direction.
1202;A Great plot is the key to any compelling science fiction film and this one is very thought provoking.
1203;"The film has cool gadgets and weapons, and new hip looking transit system and a more rundown looking part of the city called the ""sprawl""."
1204;The Tom Cruise Character has depth and has a tragic past that makes his plight very believable.
1205;I love this movie and watch it often.
1206;This movie actually delivers on the promises of the advertising.
1207;It's interesting, thought provoking, occasionally creepy, and has some good futuristic.
1208;predictions that are strikingly realistic.
1209;"Like on my title, Steven Speilberg's ""Minority Report"" is arguebly the best damn sci."
1210;Let's get down to what also makes this movie so freaking great.
1211;"Tom Cruise gives his best work since ""Born on the Fourth of July"", you can just see how drenched into character he's in of the role of John Anderton."
1212;commit, which sparks a terrific mystery brought together through great directing and writing.
1213;The use of psychics is a very interesting exploration of the future of law enforcement.
1214;cog Agatha, a homage to the legendary mystery writer Agatha Cristie, all of the performers are great.
1215;Which is also one of the other reasons what makes this film so original.
1216;Blade Runner which is also based on a Phillip K. Dick story which was also brilliant, but a little too out there.
1217;Not only that but it's a great movie.
1218;With great suspense, great action, great cinematograhpy, great dialogue, a pulse.
1219;pounding musical score by the legendary John Williams, a great script by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen, great performances, a great Tom Cruise, and above all, a great Steven Spielberg.
1220;Spielberg will always be on the top of his game.
1221;The idea of being able to identify people who will commit murders is an intriguing one.
1222;In this one, the Washington DC police force has a `Pre.
1223;Things are not great as we are introduced to the characters.
1224;Anderton is a good cop, a workaholic who is estranged from his wife because of the death of their son.
1225;The futuristic world is unlike many others, washed out with bright lights and filled with possible exploits of technology that could very well become real in the future.
1226;spielberg makes a huge hit with this movie and makes up gracefully for the abomination that was AI.
1227;This story moves at brisk pace and is chock full of his signature touches.
1228;The movie is a thriller of the highest caliber and should not be compared with AI, even though it shares some of its look.
1229;Avoid this movie at all costs.
1230;I liked the question proposed in the movie of if one can change one's destiny.
1231;This movie kept me on my toes with fast camrea action and well developed main charaters.
1232;Good movie, good actors, and good action!
1233;Two stars for a couple interesting visuals, but that's about it.
1234;If you want Philip Dick done right, go Blade Runner, go Screamers, and then go Total Recall (yes, big budet Hollywood action, but it still retains a good Philip Dick core).
1235;i bought it in presale, because I love all futuristic movies, even if they don't have good actors.
1236;For me, good effects are enough.
1237;After seeing the previews, I highly anticipated the release of MINORITY REPORT.
1238;It looked like it had great special effects, great action, outstanding direction and acting, and being based on a Phillip K. Dick novel (the roots for Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Imposter came from his short stories) I knew it was going to be great.
1239;the movie starts off great.
1240;What follows are some exciting fight scenes which include cool special effects, some great action scenes, and cool ideas.
1241;now if you like mysteries better than action films, you'll love MINORITY REPORT.
1242;Like I said, the first half was great because it was action packed and suspensful.
1243;For action fans, I recommend to watch the first half and then walk out and let your friend tell you what happend.
1244;Great Movie Action Is Excellent
1245;I loved this movie in the theaters.
1246;The movie is awesome, really a five.
1247;That is inexcusable for a two.
1248;I love this movie and want to add it to my blu.
1249;Spielberg really is the grand master of film in the modern age.
1250;cut stand with the plot resolution he gives.
1251;it will be a great day for film history if Spielberg ever gets his philosophy in tune with his sense of life.
1252;meanwhile, this is an enjoyable ride as long as you don't mind being left in the middle of nowhere at the end.
1253;It os by far the best movie of the year so far.
1254;The special effects are incredible and worth the ticket price alone.
1255;Tom Cruise gives a compelling performance of a man predicted to commit murder.
1256;Mostly a cat and mouse thriller, but also an incredible intelligent drama with lots of excitement and thrills.
1257;This movie will draw you in from the get go and leave you wanting more.
1258;bottom line is this, coming from a real filmmaker, a real film writer, and a real fan of real good movies, this almost tops them all.
1259;The story is by far the most intriguing ever done in a Spielberg film.
1260;It is an edge of your seat thriller with parts so well directed by Spielberg that it becomes hard to imagine if there is any movie that could possibly keep you this interested.
1261;The mall scene is a classic example of genius directing.
1262;The cinematography is ultimately incredible in this film by Kaminski, I especially like his lighting techniques to make the film really feel like it's in the future.
1263;the setting is great with tremendous heart.
1264;pounding action taking place within it.
1265;It looks full and complete and it's because of tremendous shots set.
1266;up by Spielberg, Kaminski, and the ILM team that it looks real and believeable.
1267;I see the future exactly the way Spielberg does, and I love it, especially the cars and the new Lexus.
1268;Great acting w/ great humor in this film, just the way moviegoers want it, and Spielberg.
1269;the only thing missing in this film is a real explosive body.
1270;my suggestion, see the movie and appreciate it's tremendous film techniques.
1271;And show your respect for the man who has made history in films, Steven Spielberg.
1272;This is an excellent movie.
1273;From the cinamatic tinting, to the action sequences, to an excellent exicution of the story.
1274;The future also seemed beleivable and real, and not too Fake, Plastic, and Stereo.
1275;I honestly beleive that having had Speilberg working on this movie is what made it a cinematic enjoyment, as well as having Tom Cruise in a role that he could really sink his new teeth into.
1276;This is by far the best in the series of films to date, and I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone!
1277;Okay, this is the best movie of the year.
1278;You are entitled to your opinion buddy, but I'm sure all of America disagrees with you.
1279;Tom Cruise is in it again at his best, and boy did he need it too!
1280;But getting back to Minority Report: This film has has everything a viewer wants to see.
1281;It has hard core action, an extraordinary plot, symbolism, character development, plot twists, exemplary computer graphics, and the perfect actors for the job of creating this masterpiece.
1282;"i walked in the theater and anticipated a ""good"" movie was going to be presented to me."
1283;This movie deserves 5 stars and for good reasons.
1284;It does have some wonderful elements like the advertising that addresses you by name.
1285;The nods to Blade Runner and Brazil are unmistakable and inferior.
1286;cogs, male twins and a woman are kept in a vat of water with electrodes attached.
1287;The means justifies the ends, get it.
1288;Scanners can identify people by their eyes so you get the picture.
1289;His escape with the female pre.
1290;max von Sydow is very good as Cruise's wily boss.
1291;if this is your taste, you'll love it.
1292;Optical surgeons may shed a few tears over it.
1293;Worth a look for free on cable I suppose.
1294;Both dramatic and prosaic in its cinematography the SFX are woven into the story seamlessly
1295;It arrives in two days after I made the order.
1296;Minority Report , Directed by Steven Spielberg, is an amazing portrayal of author Philip K. Dick's short story.
1297;Unlike A. i. Artificial Intelligence A tremendous look into the future where murder is stopped before it happens.
1298;The department of Precrime, is run by viewing the visions from the Precognitives.
1299;remember something very clear that, this movie does possess language, and one small brief 20 second scene with sexual content.
1300;"Anyway, Spielberg wanted this particular scene in the movie, to make a point in the movie, where technology had evolved to the point where it can invade our personal lives and affairs, and that we will never be able to hide from it
1301;the movie is in a nutshell a great action movie, with a great story, and a great message.
1302;fi and fantasy movies, where the CGI effects really shine through, and for a movie that's already a handful of years old (which is a long time in Hollywood), it's still holding very well with more recent and better tech sci.
1303;some of the CGI, like the green house scene, are pretty lame to the trained eye, but for the most part it's a very well made and exciting movie.
1304;About the only thing about Minority Report that is original is the spiffy effects.
1305;But Minority Report just makes it LOOK new.
1306;It will be regarded as a really cool movie for a few more months, perhaps, then the next effects.
1307;laden thriller will come along to supplant it.
1308;And after the next big Tom Cruise or Steven Spielberg movie has its day in the sun, Minority Report will seem as exciting as yesterday's news.
1309;He was a writer of great power and great paranoia, who used both to question the nature of humanity and of reality itself.
1310;i've liked Tom Cruise since about 1988 or so.
1311;He's continued since that time with a string of good movies, most of which I've enjoyed.
1312;If you've seen one, be sure to see the other sometime.)
1313;I've also liked several (though not all) of Steven Spielberg's films.
1314;_Minority Report_ is one of the finest Dick adaptations I've seen.
1315;I mean that it's an excellent motion picture on its own terms that successfully carries over some of the most important 'Dickian' themes and elements.)
1316;Every frame is an artfully constructed composition, some of them in colors that may never have existed before.
1317;the cast is also excellent (especially Samantha Morton and Max von Sydow).
1318;Even John Williams (of whom I am not normally a huge fan) does a nice job providing a suitable score.
1319;naturally the film owes a great deal to _Blade Runner_ for its overall mood, but it's also heavily indebted to Stanley Kubrick's screen adaptation of Anthony Burgess's _A Clockwork Orange_.
1320;dystopian SF films, you'll like this one even if you expect not to.
1321;Visually captivating with its grainy footage, washed out colors, and delightful visual motifs, """"Minority Report"""" makes up for any plot holes with sheer visual brilliance."""
1322;"Next to ""Schlindler's List,"" perhaps Spielberg's greatest achievement."
1323;Minority Report is a brilliant and exhilarating SciFi film.
1324;"minority Report has an amazing concept and engaging storytelling
1325;The story moves at a great pace, which kept me glued to my seat.
1326;The chase scenes in this film are also great, especially the jetpack scene.
1327;The futuristic setting is also immersive and often stunning.
1328;Most of the special effects still hold up today, despite being 10 years old.
1329;The acting was also amazing"
1330;"The music in this film matched the atmosphere and I loved it
1331;The second disc holds all of the special features.
1332;overall, Minority Report is an immersive, exhilarating, and ultimately brilliant film"
1333;Steven Spielberg made one of his best films since The Lost World.
1334;Minority Report is a great suspenseful story that pulls you in until the very last frame.
1335;When I grow up I want to become a director.
1336;I have been watching Spielbergs work since Jurassic Park ,and Minority Report reminds me of why I like Steven Spielberg.
1337;It's a great thrill ride but not what most people think and that's due to the trailer.
1338;And there is great character development.
1339;Tom Cruise character is an amazing character.
1340;this is one of the best crime films since who knows when.
1341;I like it so much that I hope that the Academy of Arts and Science think about it for an Oscar especially for Best Cinematography( Januzs Kaminski), Best Musical Score ( John Williams) Best Supporting Actor (Colin Farrel/ Max Von Sydow ), Best Director (Steven Spielberg), and best Picture Minority Report.
1342;I highly recommend this picture especially if your a Spielberg fan.
1343;One of the strongest sci.
1344;fi films in recent year, Minority Report came out in 2002, a poster year for the genre.
1345;cruise outing, the film is a thoughtful and chilling adaptation of a short story by the master Philip K. Dick, one of my favorite authors.
1346;It is nice to finally see a future movie done well
1347;Minority Report is a triumph that pairs up the talents of Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise.
1348;But the story was really fantastic!
1349;A wonderfully made storyline and plot, with unexpected parts.
1350;fi masterpiece that is full of action, is smart, and is thrilling.
1351;He takes Philip K. Dick's story and makes it his own, creating visual and mental candy for us to watch on the screen.
1352;He adds his own signature brand of directing by adding a emotional level to the film and making us feel for the characters and what they are going through.
1353;He takes the actors and makes them perform like it is their last movie, they all give great performances that would last long times.
1354;tom Cruise probably gives his second best performance(his first being in Born On The Fourth Of July) as Chief John Anderton.
1355;He makes the film seem so much greater and stronger because his peformance is intense and emotionally there.
1356;Samantha Morton was suprisingly wonderful in this as one of the pre.
1357;She really almost made you cry because she delivers some of the most powerful monologues in the film and her acting chops show here with her beautiful peformance.
1358;He is such a nice guy at first.
1359;But, all of them might not stay true to them, but this movie has taken the story and stayed true to it all the way through the film.
1360;I commend Steven for making such a fine adaptation of it and hope that he has more future adaptations of Philip K. Dick short stories.
1361;overall, the film was a great sci.
1362;fi tale heightened by great peformances with solid direction by Steven Spielberg, and a great starting story to make the film on.
1363;The theme is very futuristic and it keeps you in suspence.
1364;The special effects are well edited and 'clean'.
1365;Anderton believes in the system wholeheartedly and is proud of the results.
1366;The action sequences are all exciting and Cruise conveys enough urgency that it goes a long way toward carrying the film.
1367;It's well produced and Cruise's energy and passion in the role help show once again why he's a major star.
1368;Set in futuristic looking Washington, DC, Minority Report takes you on a wild ride of pre.
1369;That alone, the fact that Tom Cruise plays a burnout, should make it worth seeing this film.
1370;Cruise is a great main character and the end will leave you guessing.
1371;Max Von Sydow is the head of the team and Cruise is one of the officers.
1372;He goes on the run.
1373;this movie was very reminiscent of Spielberg's A. i. which was also full of stunning visuals not backed up by story or plot.
1374;With a little more attention and fewer special effects, this could have been an excellent film.
1375;Nothing to report with Minority Report.
1376;fi with good production value for the time.
1377;It's a classic of sorts from turn.
1378;paced and has an interesting storyline.
1379;The fast action and cool effects keep things fun.
1380;It's definitely worth seeing, but it's just not a movie I can claim that I love.
1381;fi classics in the tradition of Blade Runner and the 5th element.
1382;Except for some adrenaline moments, ie.
1383;Minority Report is easily one of the year's best and Cruise's best.
1384;the special and visual effect's are excellent,they are not as good as that of episode 2,but their just as good.
1385;the film was shot and lokks great.
1386;the plot was great and there were so many twists and turns.
1387;human type people who have the ability to see a murder before it happen's they can because they have a gift that allow's them to see it.
1388;then a man by the name of Ed Witwer who works with the attorney general comes to the pre.
1389;this film was so awesome it keep's you on the edge of your seet with plenty of thrill's,i also liked the way Spielberg focused on how Anderton's feeling's are because his son disappeared years ago.
1390;Watch out matrix fans, here comes a big one.
1391;The characters couldn't be better and the performing was excellent.
1392;Eventhough the matrix is a more deep.
1393;message movie, this one seems to touch an aspect never considered but psicologically interesting for crime bahavior studies.
1394;I was stunned when I heard Roger Ebert say it was his favorite movie of 2002.
1395;Highly recommended for people that like action, sci.
1396;have your favorite beverage and some popcorn handy.
1397;i would recommend it to a friend.
1398;As with Blade Runner, both based on Philip Dick scifi proposals, excelent!
1399;Throughout the last 30 years director Steven Spielberg has delivered blockbuster film after blockbuster film, with very few stinkers along the way.
1400;His successful efforts are numerous, some even garnering Academy Awards in varying fields, he's managed to launch many actors and actresses from Hollywood's B. list straight to the top of the A. list, and also launched many of Tinseltown's most lucrative film franchises.
1401;"hit ""Minority Report"", successfully laying to rest any doubts and fears movie audiences may have had regarding the veteran director's talents."
1402;"Roger Ebert summed up the movie best when he said, ""It reminds us why we go to the movies in the first place."""
1403;Who knows, but it sure makes one think, which is what all movies should aspire to, and what all good movies actually accomplish.
1404;this is definitely not a movie to be missed, and should definitely be watched by any sci.
1405;"fi fan, and if you are a fan of Steven Spielberg but was somewhat disappointed by ""A. i.: Artificial Intelligence"", then ""Minority Report"" is the movie to see, as it will help you to completely forget about that previous failure of Spielberg's."
1406;Minority Report was just spectacularly amazing!
1407;this movie was suspenseful, intriguing, one of the best I have seen!
1408;But I saw it on a sunday, and when I went back to school on monday, we started watching it in my futures class!
1409;"Minority Report is much better than ""Blade Runner""."
1410;His private life is full of angst because of the disappearance of his young son and the subsequent divorce by his wife.
1411;The movie is set in 2054 and so it contains a lot of clever technology and special effects.
1412;He has a keen eye and good dramatice sense.
1413;I think the effects were beautiful, from the 3.
1414;See the film , and you will see the similarities.
1415;p>For example, the eye jokes got old after a while.
1416;"Ok, so since everyone and their grandma has seen this movie, and I haven't my boyfriend made me watch it
1417;this is definitely a futuristic type of a movie with tons of action, good fighting, great chases, jumping of buildings, going back in the past and getting some sweet revenge.
1418;Yes Minority Report is all that you think it will be, and maybe even more.
1419;Other than that, it was really good.
1420;I love these futuristic stories!
1421;Some of the gadgets and inventions just crack me up in this movie, including the little spiders that can go through an apt building and perform retinal scans on every occupant for the police.
1422;again, using some cool kind of retinal/eye technology!
1423;cognitive abilities is fascinating, not to mention how the criminals are incarcerated!
1424;Tom Cruise gives a great performance as the tormented yet cocky cop who is framed for murder and learns to doubt the justice system he once had absolute confidence in.
1425;The movie also has a lot of exciting chase scenes, scenes of cathartic violence, humor to lighten the dark places, some emotional, tearjerking moments, and great special effects.
1426;Speilberg has created an intriguing little world here and I enjoyed visiting it for a couple of hours.
1427;The supporting cast members also gave memorable performances.
1428;this film reminds me a lot of another favorite film: Twelve Monkeys with Bruce Willis and Madeline Stowe.
1429;I enjoy this sort of movie, meaning sci.
1430;cog"""" crime thing was popular in '60s and '70s sci."""
1431;It's good to see it modernized in film.
1432;Great sets, acting, and special effects carry a gritty suspense story across the screen, darkly.
1433;About all I brough home from this movie was that they had a big special.
1434;"rather than the SF spectacular that often graces summer movie screens (including ""Star Wars: Episode II"" this summer), this is actually a murder mystery in a science fiction setting."
1435;careful attention to events is necessary if the payoff is to make any sense in the end.
1436;This rather long movie, sometimes hampered by its cast of thousands, is paced at a very rapid clip, as much the product of editor Michael Kahn as of director Steven Spielberg.
1437;There are also some eye.
1438;This always is pleasing, when you realize you're at least as smart as the characters on screen.
1439;Thoughtful moviegoers and fans of old.
1440;style character mysteries (including those of Dashiell Hammett, Agatha Christie, and Arthur Conan Doyle, all referenced in the movie) will be reasonably satisfied with the finished product, and will consider it a worthy new venture into the world of mystery fiction.
1441;cogs, gifted individuals that can see into the future through dreams.
1442;A stunned John escapes the pre.
1443;Minority Report is an exciting sci.
1444;fi film that has many interesting viewpoints that will entertain the audience.
1445;I like to watch it about once a year.
1446;This film is so entertaining and although it was made about 10 years ago, the special effects are still great.
1447;It has an almost timeless feel to it.
1448;Nice job on this one Spielberg and Cruise!
1449;I really like this movie and on Blu.
1450;It was great when it it first came out.
1451;Its fun, but a bit silly.
1452;After the commercial dissapointment of A. i Artificial Intelligence, Steven Spielberg's upcoming film Minority Report is set in more traditional Science Fiction territory.
1453;Tom Cruise, in his 25th film looks great as the Pre.
1454;From the trailers and previews, the action and FX are absolutley amazing and the dark tone is evident, with some creepy CG creations.
1455;Minority Report looks set to be one of the biggest films of the year.
1456;While I've never been a Tom Cruise fan, he is good in this movie, bearable even, and it's extremely entertaining.
1457;It's refreshing to see a science fiction movie presenting an interesting idea rather than a series of special effects.
1458;Here, the special effects serve the story, and with Spielberg involved you can expect it to be done well, which it is.
1459;Minority Report is a sophisticated and intelligent take on the time worn theme of the predator becoming the prey.
1460;He is a firm believer in new police technology that harnesses the power of three psychics .
1461;tom Cruise has seriously damaged his credibility but he is truly the mose underrated actor of our day.
1462;His performance in Minority Report is brilliant and Steven Speilburg creates a gritty noir world that invokes a stylish cross between Escape from New York and Blade Runner.
1463;It's haunting, disturbing, troubling and intense.
1464;This movie is extraordinary .
1465;quite a story and very good acting!
1466;I enjoyed total recall and this one was to have aronald in it.
1467;but this one is a great one to get if you like tom cruise.
1468;This is a movie that I was unfortunately unable to see at the theaters and regretted it then and even more so now, seeing how great a movie it is.
1469;"You can normally expect a Steven Spielberg film to contain
1470;Minority Report is an absolutely riveting film that will have you going from the moment the film starts to the very last second.
1471;He seems to be completely in his stride with this role.
1472;He performs brilliantly in this film.
1473;If you're into action/mystery films with a good dose of Science Fiction tossed in for good measure, this is your film.
1474;cogs, foretell a murder and as Tom Cruise is working his amazing futuristic computer to discover who the murderer is, he finds that it is he who is the murderer.
1475;Its obvious, Spielberg has a lot of friends in high places.
1476;A. i. and now this, good luck to the viewing masses.
1477;I suppose it helps to have Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise's names attached.
1478;, good acting, fast action.
1479;It morphed into a Sherlock Holmes type who done it.
1480;This was a good film that could have been much, much better.
1481;The film has a great premise, good acting, excellent special effects, and some intriguing philosophical questions.
1482;Spielberg's """"Minority Report"""" is a riviting roller coaster ride."""
1483;As a result, we have magnetic cars that can climb up the sides of buildings and park right next to your living room.
1484;Tom Cruise does a good job of working as the precrime director, until the precogs detail that he will commit a murder.
1485;The supporting roles are well done.
1486;"Samantha Morton who was in Woody Allen's ""Sweet and Lowdown"" with Sean Penn does an excellent job as the elf."
1487;Philip K. Dick's short story brings interesting themes about personal privacy, identity theft and intrusion into our homes to the fore which make this a film with issues that affect us in the present.
1488;Spielberg attempted a film noir style which he achieved with the stark cinematography.
1489;My impression is that this is an Alfred Hitchcock.
1490;style thriller set in the future with a high.
1491;This is a great rainy day film to have in your collection.
1492;five percent of the American population, I'm a huge fan of Steven Spielberg's work.
1493;"With that in mind, to see both ""Minority Report"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" released on Blu."
1494;ray within mere weeks of each other was quite thrilling indeed!
1495;"Much as with the ""Saving Private Ryan"" release, I was very pleased with the film transfer of ""Minority Report""."
1496;"Prior to the menu loading is an easily skipped trailer for the long overdue home video release of ""The African Queen"", which truly does look amazing on Blu, though the standard definition trailer doesn't do it justice."
1497;"This is an ""extended interview"" with Spielberg filmed on the eve of the film's theatrical release."
1498;The feature will prompt the user during playback of the interview to view storyboards, concept art, various interviews, and behind.
1499;"It's structured similar to the ""Maximum Movie Mode"" seen on recent Warner Bros. releases, with the notable difference of not having the film itself playing in the background (Spielberg is known for his dislike of commentary tracks)."
1500;Parts of this feature are in high definition, while some parts are not.
1501;This is a sort of faux documentary on the pre.
1502;"It's a fun feature, as it dives a bit deeper into the whole mythos of the idea.3) ""Phillip K. Dick, Steven Spielberg and Minority Report"" (14:18) ."
1503;"This features Dick's daughter and others discussing his life and works, in addition to commenting on how they felt about Spielberg bringing Dick's story to celluloid.4) ""Minority Report: Future Realized"" (6:22) ."
1504;A brief feature on the technology the pre.

1507;"Another two part feature including ""The Story/The Debate"" (9:36), a good feature discussing the development of the film, and ""The Players"" (9:27) a rundown of the principle characters within the film as presented by the actors who played them.2) ""Deconstructing Minority Report"" ."
1508;"This is a five part feature which includes ""The World of Minority Report ."
1509;"production elements of the film, including the unique ""think tank"" Spielberg brought together to brainstorm over ideas of the future."
1510;Precrime and Precogs (8:20) has information on the production design of the film with special emphasis on the precogs set with some good behind the scenes footage.
1511;Maglev (3:12) is yet another piece about those cool cars that drive themselves.
1512;Hovercraft and Hoverpacks (3:08) features the ideas behind the designs of those awesome devices we all wish we had.
1513;A bookend piece for the special features which has Cruise and Spielberg adding a few closing statements about the film.
1514;Rounding out the special features are three trailers in high definition.
1515;Minority Report is a pitch perfect example of how a Blu.
1516;"For now, I can easily recommend the ""Minority Report"" Blu."
1517;I thought the movies was very well done.
1518;Although I can't pass judgement on this film yet, it looks like a work of striking visuals, startling originality, and rare emotional depth.
1519;This one really makes you think.
1520;Like I said, it really makes you think.
1521;Minority Report brings to the screen a fascinating view of the future where law enforcement is in the hands of Precrime and arrests are made based on visions provided by three genetically tampered humans who can see into the future.
1522;tom Cruise, Colin Farrell and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.
1523;This can happen in our future and the world would be a safer place for me and you.
1524;I'm going to watch it again.
1525;My collection of action packed films is growing.
1526;People can say what they want to about this movie, but it has to be one of Steven Spielberg's best ever.
1527;With the right director and screenwriter, Tom Cruise can definitely be an action star.
1528;This movie had me on the edge of my seat at all times, watch it and you won't regret it.
1529;There are many changes here vs the original story.
1530;He's a young, slick hotshot.
1531;Security is run on eyeball recognition so he has his eyeballs yanked out and puts in new ones.
1532;this was a great action.
1533;The end of the story has the precrime system still in place.
1534;If the system is working perfectly, and it's about to go nation.
1535;it was a Happy Ending that Anderton and his wife end up together again, with her pregnant again.
1536;and the fact that Hollywood says free will triumphs!
1537;it's like making the movie version of Star Wars and having the Empire win in the end.
1538;And why lose the entire plot twist and base plot line that made the story so fascinating?
1539;With just the right imagination, more chase scenes and intricate plot could have been added to fill in the gaps of the storyline.
1540;One of the most original, thought.
1541;provoking, and entertaining movies to come along in twenty years.
1542;This is a true classic.
1543;tom Cruise and Colin Farrell are wonderful in their roles as Precrime Police, stopping crimes and charging criminals even though the crime has not taken place.
1544;She is one of the most compelling characters, although she does not say much or get much screen time.
1545;It is a great movie to look at.
1546;The technology and the promise of a future where we survive, make this an interesting film.
1547;Just to put things in perspective my favorite Spielberg films are (and they are in no order), Jaws, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, E. t. Schindlers List, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Always and Saving Private Ryan.
1548;the most interesting character and the most dynamic performer came from Lois Smith.
1549;She played the inventor of the software and system that allows the psychics to do what they do.
1550;She seemed to have a lot of fun with Tom.
1551;"We've always read that knowing the future can change the ""now,"" and this movie expresses that premise in an easily understandable action format."
1552;"For people who do have some belief in psychics, this film explores the possibilities of what it is that psychics ""really"" see."
1553;free perfect city of Washington D. c.?
1554;Precrime is a goverment experiment as a solution to an epidemic crime rate by arresting criminals just before they commit their crimes.
1555;The experiment is developed with the discovery of children with cosmic gifts specializing on precognition of murders and homicides.
1556;infested cities today, this can be a beautiful dream.
1557;free society, intrusion of privacy is a small price to pay.

1571;see movie and perhaps the adult blockbuster of the summer.
1572;It gives Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg a chance to work together, and to redeem themselves after a few missteps.
1573;"Cruise, a box office draw in the manner of Tom Hanks, and Harrison Ford, really needed a winning film after a couple of mistakes with excellent directors (Cameron Crowe's ""Vanilla Sky"" and Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"")."
1574;I feel he wants the success right now not only financially and artistically, but perhaps to keep up with the superior acting skills of Ms. Kidman.
1575;Because of his appeal, Cruise gets his choice of directors.
1576;"The loss of this child and his marriage gives Cruise the empathy and humane qualities he needs to deal with Agatha (one of the PreCrime unit's ""pre."
1577;the combination of Cruise's confident turn as John Anderton, a detective in the year 2054, and Spielberg's vision and special effects to give the film a chilling landscape of what the future holds.
1578;The film opens with a demonstration of the technique that is so well done, fearlessly led by Cruise, that viewers have few questions of the complicated mechanisms of the process.
1579;"cogs, and how it handles the criminals convicted of ""premurder"" is the most chilling part of the movie."
1580;The investigation of his own crime will draw you in and keep you paranoid about the action and the outcome until the film concludes.
1581;cruise is perfect for this film .
1582;"a film chameleon
1583;His flawed and grieving character is really the only well developed of the movie's many roles .
1584;Spielberg correctly lets the astonishing special effects drive the film.
1585;Spielberg also has been seeking redemption.
1586;Paired with cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (who will probably win an Oscar), with whom he has worked successfully in recent years, Spielberg gives us special effects worthy of the Indiana Jones series.
1587;The incredible career of Max Von Sydow continues as he has his biggest and best role on the big screen in years.
1588;Von Sydow is impeccable in the role of Anderton's mentor, Director Burgess.
1589;Her character, Dr. Iris Hineman, helped Burgess create PreCrime, and it is she who gives Anderton the clue needed to deal with his impending doom.
1590;What will the government be able to see and hear about us in the future.
1591;Minority Report stroke a chord in me since Steven Spielberg is kind of coming back to the kind of stories he used to tell in the 70s and the first half of the 80s.
1592;It's great to see that Spielberg made this movie in widescreen after a streak of films he filmed in normal screen.
1593;The premise of the story is quite interesting, and Spielberg manages to tell an action story very well because we see John Anderton (Tom Cruise) running away from his own colleagues from a crime he is supposed to commit in the future, and the chases are well.
1594;one thing I have to criticize though is the fact that Steven Spielberg seems to have the shadow of Stanley Kubrick hovering over him, especially when he tells us the sub.
1595;If he wants to be like Kubrick, he has to deal with those parts head on.Yet Spielberg knows how to keep his audience entertained, and he is a master of filming interesting stories.
1596;This movie has undoubtedly some merits.
1597;The richness of visual imagery is at the same level as """"Star Wars ."""
1598;Spielberg is without question a master at moviemaking.
1599;It is artful, sophisticated, rich in details, and, as a whole, a pleasure for the eyes.
1600;It is like dedicating years of intensive study to the history of eastern and western philosophy with awe and respect and then finding out that the Book of Ecclesiastes had already addressed, digested, and settled those arguments once and for all three thousand years ago.
1601;Maybe most viewers will, and maybe this movie will start a fierce debate between Calvinists and Anti.
1602;in conclusion, I think this movie is worth watching.
1603;It is a feast for the eyes and raises philosophical questions, indeed.
1604;I liked this movie and would give it a solid 8 out of 10, and at least a 7 out of 10.
1605;Except for the first 1/3 of the movie, where it drags sometimes (although the opening scene with the prevented murder is good), the rest of the movie is very suspenseful and keeps building all the way to the end.
1606;Some of the scenes and backdrops are really striking, such as the future city.
1607;scapes with their futuristic cars and highways, which are one of the cooler things in the film, and overall, it's a great.
1608;Also, it's good to see Max von Sydow is still working.
1609;"Based on the Phillip K. Dick story (whose story, ""We Can Remember it for You Wholesale,"" was the basis for the Schwarzenneger movie, Total Recall), overall, it's a good flick."
1610;overall, a pretty good movie.
1611;Great action scenes, as well as some superb futuristic stuff (just look at the traffic scenes!
1612;This is a very good film that could have been a great film.
1613;Mr. Spielberg should resist the temptation of explaining everything to the audience at the end of the story.
1614;I am a fan of good sci.
1615;"fi movies and ""Minority Report"" certainly fits to this description."
1616;"Still, it is a notch below excellent movies like ""Blade Runner""."
1617;"it belongs to the category that cinemagoers like to call ""thinking sci."

1622;"i also have to note a couple of sequences that vividly reminded me of a David Lynch movie: the first one is the ""eye."
1623;Still the story leaves a number of important issues open.
1624;It's one of his favorite movies.
1625;Minority Report breaks that chain, and shows Steven Speilberg in top form once again.
1626;This is the man that brought us E. t. over 20 years ago, also regarded as one of the greatest sci.
1627;When he chooses to, Spielberg delivers movies with carefully crafted stories, fully developed characters that draw us in and that we care about, realistic scripts, and of course special.
1628;this film gives him real meat to work with and act with.
1629;And he's really good at it.
1630;fi should be a reflection of our present condition and present day life, and should provoke us to think about ourselves, or our society, or our condition.
1631;This film does so and lends itself to multiple viewings, each time giving us something new to see or think about.
1632;Easily one of the ten best science fiction films in history.
1633;fi fantasy future, I like it for the action.
1634;But actually, come to think of it, it is entirely possible that Minority Report was written by machines .
1635;From the man who invented heart warming blockbusters comes another adult sci.
1636;fi teaser which, like his previous A. i.:Artificial Intelligence, is quite amazing, but this one even to a new level.
1637;Unlike the much talked about and much cheered and jeered A. i. (I myself think it's brilliant) Minority Report really knows where it's going and it's almost as if the previous venture was a test that has finally payed off.
1638;It's a future of wild amazement, but yet it's strangely familiar.
1639;He's the main man down at pre.
1640;cogs' who can see the future (well, at least the murderous future).
1641;The system is perfect, perfect that is until Anderton sees himself in one of the visions.
1642;without getting into too many details, Spielberg has spun a spider's web of twists and turns that make the movie fly by.
1643;Sure, the ending is typical Spielberg warmth (you know it's coming, enjoy it) but everything before it is a classic film ranking among Spielberg's best and that's about as good as it gets.
1644;The dark world of MINORITY REPORT explores this theme in both visuals and in a vision of justice that leaves the term bereft of the meaning with which we usually associate it.
1645;Director Steven Spielberg abandons the sense of wonder that usually accompanies his epics.
1646;In JURASSIC PARK and ET, Spielberg allows his inner child to present a vision of humanity that allows his cast to face danger knowing full well that the danger has a wonder indelibly etched within.
1647;The spectacular car scenes that show Anderton plunging from one vertically placed vehicle to another while at supersonic speeds are a sight to behold.
1648;fi thriller shows us a world in which technology supersedes humanity and achieves almost divine importance.
1649;"cogs are maintained under laboratory conditions in the ""Temple"" beneath the high tech police headquarters, where their visions, which become holographic images, allow the pre."
1650;With a national referendum pending on implementing the system nation.
1651;wide (and the usual political jockeying for power), Anderton suddenly finds himself set up and identified as a pre.
1652;spielberg's fascinating special effects are used here to question the almost.

1654;"Janusz Kaminski's cinematography emphasizes the black and white ""Twilight Zone"" atmosphere, the pre."
1655;cogs' dreamlike visions (shown in intense light), and the cold sterility of the setting.
1656;"Cruise, as usual, is competent in his role, von Sydow is effective as the ""grand old man,"" and Samantha Morton is a marvelously eerie pre."
1657;cog who manages to elicit considerable sympathy.
1658;Because the history of the pre.
1659;The tension is high throughout, however, and numerous chase scenes keep the viewer on the edge of the seat.
1660;Visually intriguing, thematically well developed, and loads of fun to watch, this film is terrific, light entertainment.
1661;This movie is one of Spielberg's great movies and it always has that Spielbergian way with a father and a son.
1662;It sounds kinda repeated but the future side makes it great.
1663;The plot has more twists than 1,000 knots which makes it really cool.
1664;My grade: B+, Great plot, idea, action, and intellengent dialouge but way, way too dark.
1665;This is undoubtedly one of the best sci.
1666;The special effects were outstanding.
1667;The plot was twisting and very exciting, keeping me on the edge of my seat through the whole movie.
1668;Other then that it was a wonderful must see.
1669;The movie had me hooked early and took me on a fantastic ride.
1670;tom Cruise is outstanding in the movie.
1671;This is one of his greatest performances of all time.
1672;He plays the character well.
1673;colin Farrel is good in the movie aswell.
1674;He plays the character so well.
1675;Farrel does such a good job of making you hate him.
1676;I love that kind of stuff.
1677;the special effects in the movie are some of the best all time.
1678;roger Ebert said Minority Report reminds us of why we go to the movies and I couldn't agree any more.
1679;Minority Report is Steven Spielberg's second foray into Sci.
1680;Today we have a more mature Spielberg, albeit one still obsessed with gadgets.
1681;Minority Report takes place half a century from now.
1682;A genetic experiment has created `precogs', a small group of people who can see a murder before it happens.
1683;What ensues is a thrilling story of a man on the run who is caught up in a web of mystery and deception.
1684;He is able to add layers which distract, intrigue and challenge us.
1685;He can take a present day phenomenon, such as the explosion in media technology, and imagine where it might take us in the future.
1686;He can take an ordinary, familiar action hero type and make him memorable.
1687;He can make us think while also entertaining us.
1688;Before I begin, I want to make clear that this is one of the best films I've seen this year.
1689;Unfortunately, Speilberg took a masterpiece and made it a good film.
1690;"the scene after Cruise had the eye transplants and the ""spiders"" were searching the building is one of the most intense and superbly shot scenes I have seen in a long time"
1691;"Which is a better film, ""Minority Report"" or ""Blade Runner?"""
1692;"I believe that ""Minority Report,""is why, because of the plot."
1693;"What I love about ""Blade Runner"" is the vision of the future and the settings that were both dark and somber."
1694;Minority Report is also a dark and yet beautiful film.
1695;"But I have to give credit to ""Metropolis""(1925), the first and best SCI."
1696;THE PLOTIn The Year 2054, a so. called pre.
1697;Author, Dashielle, and Agatha (Samantha Morton), whose power is the strongest of the three.
1698;"based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, ""Minority Report"" is about a cop name John Anderton (Tom Cruise)."
1699;*****SPOILERS AHEAD*****The film examines the political and ethical dilemma of arresting a person before the crime is committed.
1700;Then Spielberg takes the camera and places it on the right side of Tom body and captures the two face shot.
1701;Tom's face and Samantha's eye's and mouth portray a very powerful scene.
1702;Spielberg directs his films in a new yet classical way.
1703;"She received an Oscar nomination for her role as the mute girlfriend in Woody Allen's ""Sweet and Lowdown."""
1704;Collin Farrell delivers his best performance in this movie to date.
1705;there is a mental love story portrayed between Agatha and John.
1706;They've both been scarred deeply in the past and fate brings them together at this crucial time in John's life to solve this mystery.
1707;visually, the movie is stunning, however all the special effects cannot hide the fact the movie is doomed from the start.
1708;"One day at work, Cruise discovers that the ""Pre."
1709;steer clear of this film.
1710;This movie was great until the end.
1711;The bonus disc more than makes up for the ending in my opinion.
1712;minority Report is flawed, yes, but engaging from start to finish.
1713;The chase scenes, for example, are interesting as they reveal yet more technological wonders we haven't yet seen in this believable future world.
1714;kids figure prominently in so many of his films) but it adds depth to the story.
1715;reminds me strikingly of those dreams.
1716;spielberg's films always have happy endings, and this is no exception.
1717;Of course the film is much more detailed than the short story, but this is one of those rare cases where the original is improved upon.
1718;Those characters which were added by the screenwriters were added for good reasons, ones which advance the plot.
1719;The overall feel is somewhere in between A. i and Frequency.
1720;It is action packed, full of chases, fights, and mystery.
1721;It is sad, and glorious.
1722;It is delicate, and bombastic.
1723;this is a must see film.
1724;what I found funny about this movie, was the fact that I didn't recognise Samantha Morton until she came out of her 'bath'.
1725;She's got one of those recognisable faces.
1726;What you have to do all the time is cling onto Tom Cruise .
1727;there's quite a few famous cameos in this, mainly in the train scene, so you have to keep your eyes peeled for them.
1728;the PreCogs I found really interesting, and of course a woman .
1729;When Anderton undergoes his eye replacement procedure, his eyes are held open by clamps, reminiscent of the treatment sequences in A Clockwork Orange.
1730;Directly after the opening montage of the husband murdering his wife, it cuts directly to a close.
1731;Both films begin with an extreme close.
1732;up shot of an open eye, and repeat the eye motif throughout.
1733;Both films feature detectives making a key discovery by spotting a woman reflected in the mirror in the background of a crime.
1734;"Several times, bright shafts of light pour in through the windows behind the characters as they talk
1735;After Cruise's encounter with Crowe, he drives with Agatha through a gorgeous green scenery, and tells her they're going Someplace safe , a scene which parallels the ending scene of Blade Runner (the original, not the Director's Cut version).
1736;i did enjoy this movie, although there was a lot of talking about nonsense, which simple people will NOT understand.
1737;I'd highly recommend it, if you can stand watching Tom and Colin long enough for Samantha to steal the movie away from them.
1738;And the prison keeper who aside from acting weird uses the same disconnected tone.
1739;Enter Mr. Steven Spielberg,the master.
1740;the movie is very good, fast paced and, more important, INTELLIGENT.
1741;It builds its momentum to a climax.
1742;i enjoyed it a lot.
1743;I hate to go against the majority but the best two words to describe this movie are in my title.
1744;I know that that is very common in sci.
1745;fi/action film """"Minority Report"""" is certainly a massive special."""
1746;The film is based upon the brilliant short.
1747;tech chase (Hollywood sure loves chase scenes), Spielberg highlights many special effects.
1748;The billboards enhanced the film's Orwellian flavor.
1749;"though the film is entertaining, it is doubtful that ""Minority Report"" will attain the same level of respect and appreciation in the sci."
1750;"With its Orwellian portrayal of the future, morbid humor, cyberpunk sets and great special effects, but less than stellar portrayal of the original story, ""Minority Report"" earns a reserved 4."
1751;Any Phillip K. Dick story brought to the big screen is always a pleasure especially if they really take the time to do it well as Spielberg and Cruise do so well.
1752;The short story is infinitely better, but this adaptation is still worth watching.
1753;Tom Cruise, despite his mental state, is a fun actor and the story arc of this movie is worth watching.
1754;First of all I would like to say this movie was very exciting, yet very interesting.
1755;I recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys Tom Cruise's acting or likes action movies.
1756;"In the end "" Minority Report"" proves one of the years best movies."
1757;First of all the movie shows the possible future of cities which are under a technological lockdown.
1758;it is worth seeing since advances in technological may be accompanied by certain down sides.
1759;Under the belly of it is the human being with its basic instincts and so technology cannot do a thing about that.
1760;next to roles like Jerry Maguire and Ethan Hunt is Mission Immossible, theres Tom Cruise in Minority Report and this is really a great role for him and Steven Spielberg's direction and the characters and atmosphere pay off in this.
1761;this one hits the bullseye
1762;i found this to be a very good and credible flick.
1763;i was unnerved, as usual, by the plethora of product placements in the film, but as a vision of the future it seemed very real.
1764;yet he pulled them all off wonderfully, combining the right amount of futuristic powers at their control with their very human and lived.
1765;Philip K. Dick may very well be Hollywood's favorite science fiction writer.
1766;"Blade Runner, ""Scanners,"" ""Total Recall."""
1767;"directed thriller first
1768;it's a great idea, worthy of Philip K. Dick.
1769;At times, it's executed brilliantly.
1770;Spielberg teamed up with Stanley Kubrick in the preparations for filming """"A. i.,"""" and in that film as well as this one the Kubrickian influence on Spielberg's style has been obvious and welcome."""
1771;"The first third or so of ""Minority Report"" is almost like a Kubrick film without the inhuman bleakness
1772;One wishes Spielberg could stick with it, but he can't.
1773;enhanced chase scene to kick things into a higher gear.
1774;sweet ending no matter how much weaker the film may be as a result (a tendency that was just as egregious in """"A. i."""") """"Minority Report"""" has an interesting premise and some fine execution, but in the end it's another Spielberg film."""
1775;"fi with brains, ""Minority Report"" is an incredible movie that combines sci."
1776;It's one of those films where you can enjoy it without being the biggest sci.
1777;fi buff, but if there's a solid story behind it all, I'm there!
1778;And this film has it all.
1779;That's right, now murders can be stopped before they ever happen.
1780;"cogs"" that can see the future and predict when somebody is going to murder someone."
1781;everything about this movie I love.
1782;I love how dark and eerie of a movie it is!
1783;And what I love about it all is that even with out.
1784;the script was absolutely superb.
1785;It has some great acting too.
1786;Tom Cruise was perfect for the role.
1787;Colin Farrell and Max Von Sydow were terrific as well.
1788;The picture is great (some will complain that it looks all grainy, but that's exactly how it's supposed to look) and the sound is outstanding.
1789;Some of the extras are a bunch of documentaries on the special effects, behind the story and thought, stunts, locations, and a lot more.
1790;Minority Report is an outstanding film that really does remind me of great dark sci.
1791;Combined with action, suspense, drama, and elements of film noir, this movie proves to be a success on every front.
1792;"If you're looking for a great movie, check out ""Minority Report"" when you can."
1793;This was still a good deal for a good movie.
1794;There is an incredible amount of insight that went into this movie.
1795;It sounds good: after all, aren't they likely to engange in the act if they are locked up?Forget the issue as to whether such acts are constitutional (they clearly they are not), the question is, is it good policy?
1796;this is an important lesson for all those closet utopians who believe that an intellectual can come up with an idea and cure all of society's ills.
1797;I just loved Nancy Charles,there was such high energy emotion when she kissed Tom Cruise.
1798;This is a great movie , it has wonderful action scenes , and above all it is pure entertainment!
1799;Tom Cruise is at his best despite his earlier failures (Far and Away , Mission Imposible 2), and since Vanilla Sky he has made pretty decent films.
1800;Besides that I think most people will find it quite entertaining.
1801;Whether this is the case or not, both Spielberg and Cruise had read the short story by Phillip K. Dick and did everything in their power to bring the story to life on the big screen.
1802;And so far it has proven its worth with the absence of murderous acts in the nation's capitol for over six years.
1803;The story for Minority Report is probably one of the best that has come from Hollywood in quite some time and we wouldn't expect less from Steven Spielberg.
1804;The plot is very intelligent and proves that the summer doesn't have to be just brain.
1805;The biggest surprise comes from the balanced flow of the film considering this was based on a short story.
1806;the cast for Minority Report is put together exceedingly well.
1807;Tom Cruise has what could be another Oscar worthy performance as Detective John Anderton.
1808;Cruise expresses a wide range of emotions throughout the picture and fits perfectly into the role.
1809;Colin Farrell does a pretty good job in the role of Detective Ed Witwer.
1810;And Max Von Sydow gives an absolutely wonderful performance as Director Burgess and works well with Tom Cruise all the way to the very end.
1811;overall, Minority Report keeps the audience guessing and running out breath all the way to the very end.
1812;The film is definitely the best suspense thriller in summer 2002 if not the best film of the year.
1813;Spielberg truly makes up for the mistakes he made in A. i. Artificial Intelligence and Tom Cruise proves to many disbelievers that he can take on such a difficult project with one of the best directors of all time.
1814;Though the film is well put together, there are some things to pick at.
1815;This could definitely be one of the more mature films of the year and works exceedingly well with that.
1816;Special effects are pretty good, but I have seen better.
1817;Someone frames him, he runs and that is when you get the good action scenes.
1818;ray it sounds great with the effects in the factory part of the movie.
1819;Great acting, story, action, and special effects.
1820;Good mix of action and story.
1821;I've watched this movie twice now, and I'll probably watch it again in another couple of years.
1822;THe product arrived very quickly to the address where it was sent and it is a terrific movie.
1823;Love the movie, Love Tom Cruise movies, people have there opinion but I happen to love his moves a lot.
1824;There are a few with exceptions but religion aside, I think he's a great actor.
1825;Good performances, interesting plot, superb twists and slick but unobtrusive effects.
1826;go with it, and it'll take you to cool places.
1827;Interesting special effects, story line okay, acting fairly good, all in all worth watching.
1828;The strongest point was the special effects.
1829;Tom Cruse does a great job in this movie and I love the ending.
1830;The time that it took to be ship was great I got it sooner than I was told it would come.
1831;The story at first sounded interesting.
1832;I was able to predict down to the last twisting detail who was doing what and how it all would end.
1833;How the police got their hands on em is a whole nother story.
1834;a great movie by Spielberg where he is at his best.
1835;It was such a visually entertaining film I would go so far as to say it has the best futuristic visuals I have seen in film.
1836;Equally important is how great the plot was.
1837;This is a very suspenseful film.
1838;It is longer than most films, but well worth the time invested into it's viewing.
1839;Instead it continues to twist.
1840;I recommend this film to all who enjoy special effects and meandering scenarios.
1841;Minority Report is one of 2002's best movies, and besides Schindler's List, it's Spielberg's best movie yet.
1842;Seeing Minority Report on opening night was a truly memorable experience.
1843;everything about Minority Report is truly imaginative.
1844;as unbelievable as many of the scenes in Minority Report seem, the realism is amazing.
1845;There's all kind of high.
1846;Minority Report is a movie with incredible special effects, yet the movie is so darn good that they don't distract you.
1847;"It's not just excellent suspense and action
1848;this is one of the best movies of 2002.
1849;I just saw the best movie this weekend.
1850;As an adaptation of a Philip K. Dick short story it really hits the mark.
1851;I was impressed with the story line.
1852;The music as usual was brilliant and Spielberg has given us a plausible future not too far away.
1853;But the story really excels as a guy framed for something he has no intention of doing and runs to prove his innocence.
1854;This was an excellent film, one I will most definitely see again.
1855;I really loved this film, at the beginning I didn't expect much, I knew it was over 2 hours and if I didn't enjoy it I'd be dragging along!
1856;There is so much more to it.
1857;It's so explicit, twisted and a wonderful mind blowing Sci.
1858;I managed to predict something in the film, and it came true, then it was blown away right before the guy blew himself away!
1859;You will see and understand it all for yourself, and if it doesn't hit you the first time, watch it again.
1860;This is one of the best films ever made, so I'd definitely recommend it.
1861;Like many movies, this is the one you definitely enjoy best the first time round, so pay attention at all times, stay focused, if you miss something quickly go back, because the first time round Minority Report will BLOW YOU AWAY!PS: If you loved and understood 'The Matrix', then you'll love this movie.
1862;seriously, it's absolutely mind blowing.
1863;Minority Report is the best film that I've ever seen.
1864;Tom Cruise gives the performance of his career.
1865;This is the film of the year, look for this film at Oscar time.
1866;I will definitely recommend this film to anyone who loves films, you dont have to be a Spielberg/Cruise fan to love this film.
1867;The new Spielberg movie is almost always the big movie event of whatever time it's released.
1868;He's one of those directors who knows how to keep his audience entertained, so that's why the darker efforts `A. i' last year and now `Minority Report' came as a bit of a surprise.
1869;basically this is one of those movies where there's plenty of things that are right with it but as a whole it's not really what you'd expect.
1870;The best things about the movie are the incidental things that make up the vision of the not.
1871;Such a vision of the future also, realistically, doesn't move totally into a mechanised way of life where people are served by robots"
1872;In addition, Cruise puts in a very good performance indeed, proving that he is more than able to pick up a lead role with a bit more oomph than many Hollywood A. listers.
1873;If he's not quite as good as he was in `Magnolia', he certainly serves the picture very well.
1874;cog Agatha perfects her role with an impressive wide.
1875;Still, this is heaps better than `A. i', Spielberg's last sci.
1876;fi effort, and Cruise manages to lend the movie the right amount of humanity so that it never becomes overly sentimentalised like `A. i' nor too sterile.
1877;And there's a lot to admire, in particular a gripping scene relatively early on where Cruise learns about the leaks in the system.
1878;The paranoid streak about whether the system is always working for the good of the people is probably the best thing about the film and is certainly the most disturbing aspect of Spielberg's vision of our future.
1879;fi/futuristic mystery that has a fair supply of intrigue and suspense.
1880;cogs, who are three gifted people who can see future murders.
1881;The system is demonstrated very impressively in the beginning of the film.
1882;While Minority Report is technically a murder mystery.
1883;In truth, Minority Report takes off like a rocket: with a very effective beginning and suspenseful sequences as its center.
1884;the characters of Minority Report are mostly believable.
1885;The tension between Anderton and Whitfer is most enjoyable, as they battle with their words as well as fists.
1886;in summary, Minority Report is a very good futuristic film considering what Hollywood usually dishes out in this market.
1887;"Minority Report has suspense, a fair balance of action with drama
1888;The film is a treat, especially the first time around, despite a complicated plot and an underachieving storyline.
1889;The premise is cool and that to me is a key to Sci.
1890;fi success: If your interested in the subject matter then the movie has a reasonable chance to be good.
1891;well, this movie was better than expected and I really got into it at the end when things really came out and the plot unraveled.
1892;The acting and build up were just fine with some great twists along the way.
1893;Tom Cruise played his part well and didnt get in the way like he usually does.
1894;The supporting cast was well portrayed and I enjoyed the tension and environment everyone created.
1895;cool and these kind of things are what make us Sci.
1896;I love seeing what """"might"""" be in the future and this film had some great stuff like that in it."""
1897;The special effects were solid if unspectacular and the sets and scenes were believable enough.
1898;crime and cognitive awareness is freegin' cool and I like how both sides of it were given roughly equal support.
1899;good stuff!I really wanted to give the movie 3 1/2 stars but chose 4 stars.
1900;It's pretty solid and you'll probably like it if you're into the genre.
1901;definitely Recommended as a evening's entertainment!
1902;4.5 starsOn paper the teaming of Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise for Minority Report, a movie based upon a Philip K Dick short story, looks a sure.
1903;Anderton is chief of the Washington DC Pre.
1904;like premonitions are displayed on a giant screen, the images conducted and deciphered by a cyber.
1905;minority Report is an excellent and exhilarating ride into the future, full of action, suspense, FX and more twists and turns than a country road.
1906;It is also very much unlike any previous Tom Cruise vehicle, which is refreshing, although some parallels in the action sequences could obviously be drawn to the Mission Impossible movies.
1907;Much credit should also go to cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, and Scott Farrar, visual effects supervisor from Industrial Light and Magic, who helped make Minority Report a work of art.
1908;intelligent, very entertaining, ingenious and dark.
1909;Minority Report is another great success to add to Mr Spielbergs and Mr Cruises very impressive CVs.
1910;Minority Report was a relief.
1911;I love how computer enable directors to bring realistic dreams to the movie screen.
1912;The story is just as incredible.
1913;It reminds me of the old Twilight Zones or a great Alfred Hitchcock.
1914;Using a type of desaturation a crisp blue formed.
1915;The special Features found on disc two are amazing.
1916;The man delivers again with a breath taking film.
1917;quite honestly, the positive critical reviews this movie received still, to this day, puzzle me.
1918;Minority Report is a gripping drama about preventing murder before it happens.
1919;The thought of murders being prevented alone draws you into this film.
1920;Steven Spielberg does an excellent job of showing a futuristic Washington D. c. without it looking fake and silly.
1921;The story will also keep you glued.
1922;Not only is is visually interesting, but the story and performances are incredible!
1923;The movie was very enjoyable.
1924;At one point I thought I had it all figured out, when suddenly there was an unexpected twist.
1925;I give it three stars.

1929;Although some people take to the tv screen just as much as the Movie screen I particularly enjoyed in more for a larger screen.
1930;But besides that, the plot is very enticing and the characters very well acted.
1931;Minority Report is by far the most potent, intelligent, and provocative sci.
1932;fi thriller I have ever seen.
1933;Tom Cruise stars in this riveting masterpiece, giving a vivid and realistic portrayal of his character, as do all the actors in their individual roles.
1934;The storyline is extremely well.

1936;And the chilling depiction of the far future is realistic as well.
1937;old unit of astounding technology headquartered in Washington DC which identifies the culprits of future murders.
1938;in my opinion, Minority Report exceeds most other films in the sci.
1939;It is perfect in every way.
1940;Even the choreography is noticeably excellent.
1941;With his new film, though, Spielberg has restored the Kubrick touch to great effect.
1942;based on a short Philip K. Dick story, Minority Report is set in the year 2054.
1943;philosophical quibbles aside, the film is a good, old.
1944;It moves with pace, it's visually opulent, and a damn good story.
1945;In one superb shot, we are treated to a bird's.
1946;Cruise, reprising similar roles in Eyes Wide Shut and Vanilla Sky, is very watchable and joined by an excellent Max Von Sydow.
1947;Like any good, modern sci.
1948;fi, its homages are numerous.
1949;The vision of the future and its skyscrapers are pure Metropolis and its copy Bladerunner, as is Anderton being both the subject and object of his investigation.
1950;high boots and short skirts reflects the vision of the future in Starship Troopers.
1951;updating newspapers may not yet be with us, the Georgian housing of Georgetown is very much of our era.
1952;despite one or two sentimental moments, Minority Report is much darker than A. i. and hence a much more fitting tribute to Spielberg's former mentor.
1953;"Minority Report, like ""Bladerunner,"" is based on a Philip K. Dick story (although this time a short story)."
1954;The plot, which is excellent, is only half of the reason this film makes the list.
1955;"The film resembles ""Bladerunner,"" in more ways than having been based on a Dick story
1956;The future portrayed is believable, both gritty and sleek, and the ethical questions raised by the film are especially poignant as we increasingly live a world were we are videoed, photographed, and observed on a greater, and greater level.
1957;This is now one of my most favorite movies.
1958;I think this is one of Spielberg's best.
1959;It is a freaky look into the future that has many twists and interesting dialogue.
1960;fi twist, than you will love Minority Report.
1961;First off I want to say that this vision of the future is very believeable, and the visual effects are incredible as well.
1962;Spielberg's direction is some of his best here, and next to Schindler's List this is his best directorial effort.
1963;Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances as Anderton, and his character development is paced along well.
1964;Great, memorable roles for Max von Sydow, Colin Farrel (who steals many of his scenes with Cruise), and Samantha Morton (who is heartbreakingly tragic as a PreCog Cruise kidnaps) are among many highpoints of Minority Report, and this is without a doubt a new sci.
1965;fi classic that will be revered for years.
1966;When you combine the talents of superstar Tom Cruise (""""Vanilla Sky"""", """"Top Gun"""") and director Steven Spielberg (""""A. i."""", """"Jurassic Park""""), there's nothing that can stop them from bringing a great film to the big screen, and """"Minority Report"""" is no exception whatsoever!"""
1967;I have seen this film twice at the theater and I can't get enough of it!
1968;"But now, Spielberg has certainly outdone himself with ""Minority Report"", a film loaded with action and thrills galore, powerful drama, and cutting edge special effects that only Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) can provide us with!"
1969;"Possibly the best Cruise performance since the ""Mission: Impossible"" films!"
1970;Minority Report takes place in Washington, DC in the year 2054.
1971;And so begins an action.
1972;packed journey as Anderton races against time to clear his name, reclaim his life, and to find out who framed him and why.
1973;Minority Report is, without a doubt, one of the absolute best sci.
1974;Minority Report is one of those movies that comes once in a while.
1975;Steven Spielberg proves again with this movie that he is truly the king of movie.
1976;Minority Report is one of Spielberg's greatest movie.
1977;He tells this story quite complex that take place in the year 2054 with great action, dialogue and storyline.
1978;best performance in career after Jerry Maguire .
1979;Of course, for someone with a I. q. less than 90, this can be a challenge to understand this movie, but for others, you'll have one of the greatest time watching a Spielberg film.
1980;Along with Catch Me If You Can , Spielberg makes the year 2002, a wonderful year with the release of two of his greatest work in a long time.
1981;I highly recommend Minority Report for anyone who wants to see a good movie.
1982;this film is part of the rewarding trifecta of Speilberg's most specialist period of contemporary future sci.
1983;fi type Genre films, and as such is perhaps one of his most personable films.
1984;fi, all be it, a more cultish director, as i really think the elements of film maker come together in this type of film.
1985;fi Genre films, always seem to work really well, and this film is no exception.
1986;While not as good a film as the tantalizingly close to total Genre awesomeness of War of the Worlds, Minority Report is a better fully realized story.
1987;any film one likes to keep, usually best to have special edition, and this one is worthwhile for it's extras to that too.
1988;Both the cast and story line is great.
1989;Three humans with exceptional clarvoyance and telepathic abilities predict crimes before they occur.
1990;The audio is nicely represented.
1991;There is a sense, even from him, that he's done all this before and with far greater economy of wit, special effects, storytelling and charm.
1992;Many have lost loved ones and never get a sense of closure nor the sense of peace provided by the exercise of justice.
1993;It is worth watching multiple times.
1994;Instead we have something profoundly disturbing, moving and edifying all in one package.
1995;The themes are profound: predestination, the conflict of principle vs. uility, loss and healing.
1996;There is art, imagery and imagination and.
1997;also delivering an amazing performance is Samantha Morton, the female psychic Agatha, who sees John Asterton (Cruise)commit the murder.
1998;morton shows that she can deliver a range of extreme emotion and stress, desperation, fear, exhaustion, confusion, and simple bewilderment of the everyday world.
1999;One of my favorite movies that most people have never seen.
2000;Its weird how so many techno things have become reality from this movie, I've always thought it was overlooked as a really impressive piece of work.
2001;The other disc is a making of MR which is cool too.
2002;Good acting and great story line.
2003;watch it again and recommend it to others.
2004;Spielberg has created the thinking man's summer blockbuster.
2005;Through all of the special effects and excitement, he has created a movie that questions man's blindness through technology and ambition.
2006;I highly recommend this film .
2007;He's a Cancer to boot!
2008;This film is a nice departure from the normal action fair in that it moves fast through a possible future.
2009;There are a couple of twists here, one that he isn't being framed in the way that he thinks he is or why he thinks he is or that this frame has been going on for such a long time.
2010;though the film goes into Max Von Sydow being a a very complicated victim, Spielberg has created a world around Cruise's character.
2011;And like Julia Roberts, Cruise has been supplanted into the mass consciousness that even a film as complicated as thsi draws you in.
2012;i personally find Cruise infectious in the sense that he's so gung.
2013;And that is what makes thsi film really, really good, I would call it one of my favorite of the year.
2014;fi thrillers are always good to watch.
2015;Speilberg gives us a real treat and this is certainly one of Speilberg's darkest films to date.
2016;Minority Report has more in common with Schindler's List and Blade Runner than it does with Close Encounters of the Third Kind or Jurassic Park.
2017;This is new ground for Spielberg and having bombed with A. i. it is certainly a better direction for him to move in.
2018;His display of manipulating their imagination and dreams among a big glass digital screen is almost done with the same wizardry that Speilberg edits his own films.
2019;Speilberg's thoughts are on form in Minority Report and most of the movie is big and wild in a vast dreamscape.
2020;He manages to actually hunk in a tense action thriller full of suspense about a man on the run from his own system.
2021;It is also full of brains and creative imagery.
2022;Yes, Speilberg has gone a bit loco here and it pays off in aces.
2023;And the fight in the car factory it's almost the same as in the Star Wars: Episode 2 .
2024;This is one of his best works,a top notch sci.
2025;this movie will keep you riveted till the end,a stunning work.
2026;I really wanted to like this film.
2027;But I have to give them points for trying.
2028;In the film's one spectacular scene, the opening, Cruise and his team race against the clock to stop a cukoled husband from killing his wife and her lover.
2029;biter, and the movie may be worth a view based on that, but that's it.
2030;the system is unique to DC, but a national referrendum on a nationwide pre.
2031;crime system is up on the ballots, and Cruise and his mentor, played by the always excellent Max Von Sydow, want nothing more than to see it pass.
2032;this is the story, and it's a good idea.
2033;For example, we are told that the Pre.
2034;the final act is a paint by numbers game that any intelligent person would have seen coming, and again Spielberg avoids the big risks for his patented uplifting ending.
2035;It's as if Spielberg thought that by mentioning privacy issues, his film could address them.
2036;Sometimes, more questions than answers is a good thing, especially in Science Fiction.
2037;Spielberg has finally redeemed himself.
2038;Although, not as brilliant as Jaws, Jurassic Park, Empire of the Sun etc, this film manages to have all the right elements for a great summer blockbuster.
2039;Filmed with a special bleach process, the unique look of the film is washed out of most colors and at times is very bright and 'blown out'.
2040;It is a great look.
2041;comparing the rich, dark, look of Blade Runner or the bright, colorful look of The Fifth Element.
2042;Anyway, a fine film and an entertaining suspense thriller.
2043;I liked tihs movie less than AI.
2044;A good movie but not one of my favoriet cruise films.
2045;A good flick non the less and good for your personal collection.
2046;He acts so human and normal, (unlike the masterful performance from Haley Joel Osmand in A. i.) Then again, Tom Cruise is one of the greatest actors alive,so, perhaps it's hard for him to act with little emotion.
2047;however, like Schindler's List,Speilberg makes a great entertainment picture about events and things that only a genius can think of!Speilberg, good for you.
2048;although Cruise doesn't look like a mecca, you sure do make another great holocust film.
2049;mAN, the great Steven Spielberg succumbed to pressure and made one of the films that, arguably, is destined for the trash heap of film history.
2050;at best, REPORT serves as what happens when two great minds get together .
2051;Minority Report is, without a doubt in my mind, the best film so far this year.
2052;I will even go as far as saying it is one of Steven Spielberg's most ambitious, creative, visually stunning and best films in years.
2053;He has created a film that redefines him as a director.
2054;It actually adds to the greatness of the film.
2055;"The film reminded me a lot of Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner""."
2056;"The visual effects come into play a lot in this film, much like they did in ""Blade Runner""."
2057;The amazing visuals help in telling the story and bringing the new technology used in the film to life.
2058;the performances in the film a great all around, especially Tom Cruise who gives one of his best performances in years.
2059;The entire supporting cast is equally good, especailly Colin Farrell who is fantastic and Samantha Morton as the female Pre Cog who Cruise's character gets help from.
2060;I truly hope that the Academy does not over look this film when Oscar season starts because it truly is a gem and should not be missed.
2061;Naturally, I went to the cinema with great trepidation.
2062;In some ways, I am feeling apologetic for Tom Cruise because he can actually act and look good at the same time.
2063;Lexus is featured prominently in this movie throughout, and one can't help wondering if soft sponsorship occured in this instance.
2064;My trust in Steven Spielberg prevails!
2065;Great story, effects, and poses moral questions to the audience.
2066;John believes in the system, it is perfect.
2067;"i went to see ""Minority Report"" just recently with high expectations for it."
2068;I was at first VERY discouraged at the opening sequence which was to me undeniable scary, but as the film progressed I found myself very intrigued by the interesting and well.
2069;thought out plot, the exciting and breathtaking action, and body tensing suspense.
2070;steven Spielberg again does a marvelous job as the director of the film.
2071;But the film was all Tom Cruise's as each and every scene he gives such a strong role as John Anderton.
2072;He acts exceptionally well and gives a great performance with lots of character development.
2073;Also knowing that he did most of his stunts also earned a bit more respect from me.
2074;Though he is somewhat like the bad guy at first, I really loved his role.
2075;the plot is what really makes the movie so mesmerizing.
2076;I thought the whole story was well.
2077;When the movie finally tells why John Anderton was supposed to kill Leo Crowe, I was shocked!
2078;The conclusion for me was very satisfying though some have said it was a bit disappointing.
2079;the effects and action sequences were very well done.
2080;I loved all of the futuristic gadgets and new technology, especially the cars, advertisements, using the eyes for identification, and more.
2081;The action scenes were also very exciting.
2082;Good film raising important questions about an unknown future.
2083;up, and the chase is on through Spielberg's version of the future, where technology is shown to be fascinating and wonderful.
2084;putting to those unaccustomed to the machinations of complex Science Fiction, but the images of the future's advertising and transportation technologies are compelling and realistic.
2085;The film also provides an opportunity to see one of the greatest living actors, Max Von Sydow, in a bigtime Hollywood action flick.
2086;I saw the movie and I loved it.
2087;It has fantastic special effects.
2088;Anyway, this kind of technology and the enormous undertaking of converting the pre.
2089;The movie is only good the first time around.
2090;The action scenes are NICE, and so is the story and computer graphics.
2091;Some imperfections and a little long, but generally a very good show.
2092;A good cross between action, drama and suspense and worth viewing.
2093;Went with a friend and she as well was unimpressed.
2094;Not even the color of the film was impressive as it seemed dark and blue tinted.
2095;Sorry, but I thought it lacked something .
2096;The storyline was fairly good, improbable for 50 years from now, but it was interesting and great special effects, Spielberg.
2097;But since there were only 4 of us in our small town theatre, thought it best not to and actually was pretty happy with the rest of the movie, plus the theatre owners have the best popcorn in town.
2098;Beyond the middle of the movie where most of the yuck special effects end, it is fairly intelligent viewing.
2099;There are some flinchy parts in that I found myself jumping in my seat a few times, so that was kind of interesting .
2100;there needs to be a good story, good dialogue, great editing and to heck who's in it, just so there's good acting.
2101;crafted plot, cliffhanger situations, familial bonds (This IS a Spielberg film!)
2102;, political intrigue, and mysterious characters.
2103;what more could you want?John Williams has composed one of his best scores in years, a deft combination of the adventurous and the haunting.
2104;preservation, and fit, figuratively and literally, for the tasks brought upon him.
2105;Newcomer Samantha Morton is sympathetic as the individual that holds the key to Cruise's future.
2106;The actor balances the sincere and the menacing with the talent that only years on the screen can give.
2107;screen time is brief, she paints a memorable canvas as she provides Cruise's character with important information that can save his hide.
2108;I am a huge Spielberg fan and coud not wait to see this film.
2109;The action was hard core, the score was magnificent(well done John!)
2110;, the acting was very believeable, the story is very interesting and futuristic, and my favorite.
2111;the visual effects were completely realistic and dazzling.
2112;If anyone out there is looking for a great film for the summer, choose Steven Spielberg's Minority Report.
2113;Regardless, the film is wrought with intrigue not yet imagined, and some great sets.
2114;The performances were great, with Cruise gaining confidence as the film went on.
2115;This film gains momentum, due to excellent editing and very taut direction, as well as a literate script, and the result is an imaginative and exciting adventure, great ecapist fare.
2116;Great story all the interwoven plots and finally corruption.
2117;Storywise and from its flawless special effects, this film is sure to please anyone.
2118;I am somewhat of a Steven Spielberg fan, and he's showing no signs of slowing down in the way that he keeps on supplying great entertainment for the whole family.
2119;i strongly recommend this film, mainly for reasons already mentionned, and for the fact that this is an original idea for once.
2120;This movie has it all: depth, realistic special effects, psychological character development, bertrayal and loyalty all mixed together.
2121;More drama than science fiction, so it appeals to women as well.
2122;this movie is really good.
2123;The story line is original.
2124;good acting, photography and script
2125;But i don't think the american audience demands good acting pictures anymore and they count on special effects to pull them threw a movie which Spielberg is good at.
2126;i wasn't impressed but Tom is still good to look at.
2127;spielberg tells a great story here.
2128;I won't rehash the plot, but let's just say that not only is the story a zinger, but there are lots of great scenes.
2129;The sweeping camera work, as though the whole complex had been cut into a cross section, was absolutely terrific.
2130;When Cruise awakens and steals one of them, the movie takes a very interesting turn, as we see the world through the eyes of this empath, Agatha, who has a hard time telling if what she is seeing is the present or the future.
2131;colin Farrell makes for a cool adversary for the hot.
2132;Max VonSydow is terrific as Cruise's mentor.
2133;he has such a great voice.
2134;And Cruise, who has never been one of my favorite actors, is very good in this.
2135;He keeps himself from overacting in most scenes, and doesn't seem too self.
2136;conscious about looking good or charming.
2137;the whole vision of a not too distant future, coupled with some great scenes of suspense, good performances and even a tear.
2138;jerking moment or two make this one of the best movies of the year, and certainly the best sci.
2139;Speilberg has done it again.
2140;The year is 2054, and seeing crimes before they are commited is now possible.
2141;"this quote unqoute ""perfect"" world, however, is about to end for Anderton."
2142;When he shows up in the precogs' predictions, he is stunned.
2143;He immediatly starts denying it, and is soon running from the future police.
2144;The end is the best part, though, so it's worth the wait.
2145;It's got a somewhat unexpected twist.
2146;This film satisfies on all levels: acting is great, the story complex yet believable, deliciously quirky details on life in the future from personalized advertising via retina recognition to scurryng intelligent police robots, and even philosophical issues about fate and choice and service to the state.
2147;While the plot is that of a murder mystery, the themes are the choices that new technologies and a re.
2148;cruise is really a wonderful actor, in spite of all the weird stuff written about him that may even be true .
2149;He is super competent, athletic, and a natural leader, but also a tormented soul, completely convincingly.
2150;This is one of his best performances, which made me a genuine fan.
2151;Colin Ferrel and van Sydow are also excellent, as are many of the other characters.
2152;Nonetheless, there is an extremely well developed vision of a future society here, right down to every detail.
2153;It makes for an intricate plot and many many ideas, so that it can be viewed many times, which is the key to a great film experience.
2154;you can view it on many levels.
2155;It is a masterpiece and indeed one of the best scifi films I have even seen, destined to become a classic on the level of Forbidden Planet.
2156;This movie is highly entertaining, brilliantly directed and loaded with really cool special effects that seem so natural.
2157;somewhere, midway through this flick, it hit me.
2158;While this is a darker story, without anything comparable to ET being bicycled across the rising full moon, (his Amblin Entertainment logo) it still gives one a feeling of the fullness of being human and then a little bit further.
2159;In this case, that was being deliciously entertained.
2160;My faith in the master is back.
2161;There's magic in his touch.
2162;fi I think there is something for everybody, and the advanced technology is great as well, futurist helped to bring all of their ideals into a real world vision on screen !
2163;the effects are quiet superb, which warrants perhaps the real reason for seeing this film
2164;admiration society among the production team gushing over how great each other is.
2165;"In fact, ""Saboteur"" has many parallels with ""Minority Report"")."
2166;the cast is excellent, although poor Jessica Harper has no dialogue.
2167;"brilliant scenes: the Lois Smith encounter
2168;doctor"
2169;First and foremost, the dates of story occurrence.
2170;And yet so much has dramatically changed.
2171;As a matter of fact, there is a great deal of obstical in that a great portion of the people just think it is simply cinema movie drama technology, and will never happen that way in reality.
2172;There are pleanty of other reviews that will give you the basic idea of the plot.
2173;flat screen, it still looked amazing.
2174;Second, the Audio, the 5.1 Dolby Digital audio is impressive.
2175;Good, clean, and the levels are right on with no ambients or hums or hissess, which is always good.
2176;All that's left to the ears is the wonderful sound recordings of the original footage.
2177;I did give it four stars.
2178;What they have here is a good start with a great movie and great transfer, and ok extras.
2179;It is right there along with Wild Wild West, War of the worlds, Day after tomorrow, and Independence Day.
2180;He will be hard pressed to ever top his work with Oliver Stone.
2181;Tom is capable of so much better.
2182;Oh it sounds like it probably will be good, so I give it five stars!
2183;secondly, I did see Minority Report and give it a high recommendation.
2184;While it is more intelligently crafted than most Hollywood .
2185;aside from the core idea of the story, the best part about this film was the excellent cinematography from Janusz Kiminski, if you care about that stuff.
2186;the acting was fine, with the most stirring performance coming from Samantha Morton who plays the precog Agatha.
2187;Cruise was just himself really, as well were all the leads.
2188;But of course this is a Hollywood film so there must be a score to elevate the emotions of the characters!
2189;It's a great story from the creative mind of sci.
2190;All in all the film was entertaining and never boring.
2191;it is by far the best movie I have ever seen .
2192;steven spielberg does a superb job directing and Tom Cruise definetly holds his own as John Anderton.
2193;All of the actors do a excellent job and after watching you really think about the plot and its many questions.
2194;This is a good Spielberg film and good blu.
2195;Fans of The Matrix ought to love this one .
2196;Tom Cruise pulls off a stunning performance, and every moment of it is believable.
2197;While the general plot is easy to follow, it's the added surprises that give Minority Report its color .
2198;There's even a peek into a Gap store of the future.
2199;clues of the crime come in disconnected, dreamlike scenes.
2200;(Their power is something of a curse: the pre.
2201;"and the female ""Agatha"" is linchpin ."
2202;piecing together clues before it gives itself a chance to appreciate what the clues are.
2203;fi epic, it's nevertheless immensely satisfying as both.
2204;There are very few movies out there that can make you smile.
2205;I'm not just talking about happy go lucky movies, but movies that rivet you with something magical that no other movie contains.
2206;Cruise firmly believes in the ability of the Precogs, as well as their accuracy, yet is fed a taste of his own medicine when the Precogs predict a murder that he, himself, will commit.
2207;As a morality tale and as far as the message behind the whole movie was concerned, I was unimpressed, but this was taken away from the sheer magic of the movie's visual effects and the rich individual stories of the characters.
2208;every element of this movie is spectacular.
2209;There are fine performances from Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell, the special effects are some of the best since The Matrix, the story is spectacular and it holds your attention for the duration.
2210;looking movie with a great premise.
2211;Tom Cruise is perfect for the part of an intense cop in a future somewhat lacking in humanity, and Colin Ferrell is excellent as the upstart looking to prove him guilty of crimes he hasn't (yet) committed.
2212;The action is unusually memorable, including a fight in an automated Lexus plant, and there are half a dozen set.
2213;"The movie is great in its details, too
2214;absolutely, enjoy this movie, but don't expect anything more than an exceptionally fun ride.
2215;This movie starts with an interesting premise.
2216;Through a complex technology that utilizes three wired pre.
2217;In the riviting opening sequence, a woman is in the middle of an adulterous encounter.
2218;Stallone's futuristic flick creates a human world with people we can care about.
2219;Together with Burgess, they developed PreCrime, a state.
2220;Three precogs (human mutants with extraodinarily acute psychic.
2221;justice is served :)This movie is about the future, but it does make you think : what if one day we can all predict everything that's going to happen,and change them before they happen?
2222;Life is full of choices and possibilities.
2223;Very fast paced, very meaningful theme, you never really know what's gonna happen, and great special effects.
2224;This movie really had some great, and classic, movie scenes.
2225;The plot was flawless in action, some romance, perfect characters, and yes, it did have some mistakes.
2226;So, a great movie overall!
2227;well, actually no murder, presumably plenty of other types of crime.
2228;right from the beginning you begin to discern what kind of movie this is.
2229;cogs as you easily and successfully predict every turn of the plot.
2230;If you desire surprises, thoughtful stories, meaningful dialogue, exciting action, touching moments, turn around now.
2231;And with such a great story at the core of the film, it should have been used as the sequel to TOTAL RECALL.
2232;visually nice, and Tom Cruise do not a good film make.
2233;It is filled with twists and turns and subplots which really makes you pay attention.
2234;The smaller roles in this film, such as the prison guard, Dr. Hanigen and the Blackmarket physcician, are excellent and manage to say more about the society than any of the gadgets up on screen.
2235;tom Cruise does a great job he plays a complicated character without any of the pretentiousness displayed in the other mentioned movies.
2236;one of the reasons I love the character he plays is that he does so with a great deal of assurance without the overbearing machismo that is so often shown with other action heroes.
2237;The pain and lonliness he feels inside is actually pallitable.
2238;It makes him much more human, believable and easier to relate to.
2239;I have seen this film twice since its opening on Friday and it already is becoming a fast favorite.
2240;But if you are looking for a good (and for once) satisfying film that is worth your time and money this film is for you!
2241;fi that holds up pretty well.
2242;No, the movie does not stay true to P Dick's storyline, but it holds true in all the ways that matter.
2243;The acting, of course, was great, as were the special effects and editing.
2244;I remember when Minority Report first came out and it improved with a second viewing of the future.
2245;the future is an interesting place"
2246;lots of chases and lots of fighting with the occasional peak at the future make for some interesting science fiction entertainment .
2247;"Minority Report is a futurist ""Blade Runner"" type movie with the excellent storytelling by Spielberg!"
2248;Anyways its a great summer movie and keep up the good work Steven!
2249;It seems contradictory to use the words blockbuster movie and intelligent story in the same sentence, mostly because the big budget movies that fill the summer season's screens lack any kind of real depth and instead feature dazzling special effects and characters that are dazzling, but completely unbelievable.
2250;So it is interesting to note that, while Minority Report dazzles the audience with a future that is slick, cold and high.
2251;tech, it also delivers a story that is engaging, challenging and even thought.
2252;set in the year 2054, Minority Report is the story of a new form of law enforcement, an agency called Pre.
2253;Instead, this film builds layer upon layer, with complex and interesting dialogue between completely developed and believable characters.
2254;Mixed up in a conspiracy that reaches to the very heart of Pre.
2255;Spielberg, whose films are known globally, took a very definite approach to this film.
2256;The camera work too is shaky, consistent with the type of footage seen in documentaries and shows like COPS , giving the film a gritty and dismal look that is far from the glossy images so commonly seen in Spielberg's works.
2257;the soundtrack, by John Williams, whose music is heard in most of Spielberg's films, provides a soundtrack that is erie, haunting, beautiful and dark, again, adding a dimension to the stories abysmal feeling.
2258;the action sequences are elaborate, and the effects first rate.
2259;The world created here by Industrial Light and Magic is completely convincing, and the effects blend beautifully into the film, even with the grainy look that was achieved by Spielberg while shooting.
2260;as a whole, this is a complex, intelligent thriller, with a storyline that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat to the very end.
2261;Because of the darker tones, this film is not for everyone, but it is definitely a worthwhile experience, and a film that should be viewed multiple times to attain the full experience of the story Spielberg has created.
2262;"The great thing about ""Blade Runner"" was the story
2263;When I heard that Spielberg, fresh off making """"A. i."""", had the guts to work with material adapted from a Dick story, I thought this might end up being a great movie."""
2264;steven Spielberg is at the peak of his powers here and makes a truly great movie, probably the best science.
2265;The story runs deep, and his treatment of it is the work of a great filmmaker.
2266;"I thought ""Schindler's List"" for example was wildly overrated ."
2267;The world is not just, but it is full of great art, and this definitely qualifies.
2268;This movie was good, it had a great story idea and some really good action scenes and the special effects where amazing but something was missing from it to really make it amazing.
2269;"It seemed to me that everyone was impressed with the movie
2270;what a shock!I REALLY liked this movie.
2271;Good story, good editing, a kind of it.
2272;All I can say is .
2273;I have seen this excellent movie twice and enjoyed it very much.
2274;When John's precogs see into the future and predict HE will become a murderer, John finds himself the target of his own police force.
2275;Can John prove his own innocence, or is he destined to become a murderer?I really enjoyed Minority Report.
2276;I found it hard to believe that a seemingly somnambulant precog female was able to speak, talk, and interpret the sensory feedback she received after being contained within the 'temple' for quite so long.
2277;I give it 3.5 stars.
2278;It was good, although the sound went out during the intial fight chase scene.
2279;i have decent hearing but I can't hear that in a crowded theater.
2280;It's actually a very intricate plot, so it can be very easy to miss things.
2281;the movie had an awesome style, just as all Speilberg movies do.
2282;I loved the art direction, which I believe is truly the best art direction of 2002.
2283;I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through!There are also some strong performances here.
2284;Tom Cruise displays surprising depth for his character, and you're rooting for him the whole way through.
2285;Colin Farrell is also very good even though his role isn't as meaty as Cruise's.
2286;Samantha Morton was the strongest performer here if you ask me, she makes a great crazy person, and like Cruise brings depth to her character so you ultimately care about what happens to her.
2287;the action scenes in this movie are awesome, as you've probably heard.
2288;hopping scene as well (the climax to that scene is hilarious) and the very intense scene where Cruise attempts to escape the building.
2289;overall, I just thought this movie was great.
2290;It had emotion, action, and a great story.
2291;I just loved the way this worked and the premise of finding the killer before the crime is really really cool and Speilberg's vision for the future is realised here more than ever.
2292;Spielberg is at the top of his game with Minority Report.
2293;He doesn't just settle for the masterful special effects"
2294;Combined, the stunning visuals and the moving story line make for a great film.
2295;tom Cruise gives an intense performance and gets our sympathy as an officer in the pre.
2296;They are able to do this by using the mental powers of three pre.
2297;the movie is an engrossing futuristic thriller with unexpected twists.
2298;The supporting cast is also strong.
2299;where the film really shines is how they expand on the book.
2300;The visual representation of how the recordings of future are used to find clues to prevent the crime is brilliant.
2301;The following race against time is action packed and very dramatic.
2302;crime headquarters and fighting his way through his former teammates and federal agents is great action.
2303;The next hour is very good.
2304;Technology rarely makes the world a better place in PKD's universe.
2305;bans famous in Top Gun, there is a very funny scene involving a corridor and some items also involving vision.
2306;how to make this a better film simply by cutting footage.
2307;in summary, I would actually recommend seeing this film.
2308;When it's good, it's very good and that's most of the first 2 hours.
2309;Use the edits I suggested in your head when watching it.
2310;The story line and special effects are wonderful.
2311;Minority Report is an intense thriller that does not let up until the end.
2312;Adapting a Phillip K. Dick story, Steven Spielberg blends stunning visual effects in with powerful acting to make a movie with twists turns and suspense that will have you guessing who the real murderer is.
2313;He's extremely effective in his job catching murderers before they commit murder.
2314;This one simple use of a word definition as a plot device makes the story all the more intriguing because Anderton is not a murderer.
2315;spielberg treats us to some wonderful action sequences (the chase in the alley is great, the fights in the Lexus factory are amazing.)
2316;Spielberg thankfully keeps these sequences short to keep the story moving.
2317;But the special effects are secondary to the storytelling as they should be.
2318;He focuses on the characters and their motivations and that is the key to GOOD science fiction/ fantasy.
2319;tom Cruise gives a powerful performance as John Anderton showing us his intensity, drive and emotional pain.
2320;Her intense performance makes you feel her character's fear and sense of overwhelm in her first trip out in the real world.
2321;The actress who plays Anderton's wife is great too.
2322;She makes you feel tension and fear of her character.
2323;steven Spielberg is at the top of his game here making one of the best science fiction movies since Robocop.
2324;He uses less special effects and more storytelling and character development to show us a clear picture of what life in the near future is like.
2325;The film opens 52 years from now in Washington, D. c.
2326;fi elements, the classics from good movies are evident.
2327;love, loss, betrayal, loyalty, duty, angst and a pinch of humor.
2328;There's a touch of everything .
2329;fi elements are subtle in many ways.
2330;like scenes with modern cars that can quickly travel in any direction, even on a 90 degree highway, are a definite tribute to the classic films that Spielberg holds dear.
2331;The film is an experience .
2332;you feel it, and you sympathize with the characters and you even care what happens to them after the film is over.
2333;This may be Tom Cruise's finest performance and the entire cast deserves a standing ovation.
2334;I watched it because a friend said it was a good model of the revolutionary theory that the modern mind aided by technology can stop crime before it happens.
2335;It is a fairly good movie, but it completely twists the message of Philip K Dick's story.
2336;This is a great movie!!!
2337;One of the best movies i have ever seen!!!
2338;"First, and somewhat obviously, ""Minority Report"" deals with the question of predestination."
2339;"As it should, ""Minority Report"" does not fully answer this question, but does a decent job of setting it forth in a way that it can be popularly understood and discussed."
2340;ends question, and are presented in the friendly, narrative style that Speilberg generally uses.
2341;in any case, this is a truly thoughtful and thought.
2342;provoking movie that was sadly maligned by many caught up in the exciting chase scenes and strong special effects.
2343;But for those interested in thinking about the future, or with a philosophical bent, there are things here worth seeing.
2344;Tom Cruise sticks to acting in this movie and does a very good job.
2345;The special effects come off pretty well.
2346;Rest assured that Minority Report stays away from being catagorized with those films but insteads carves its own nitche in the sci fi genre.
2347;Minority Report stays away from being the mid summer spectacular that many want and becomes a rather plot filled film with much diaologue and twists.
2348;Minority Report rather uses its futuristic enviroment as a back drop to tell a rather involving story.
2349;Spielberg who is known for his sci fi and war epics strays away a delivers a well thoughout suspense drama using the visual effects of the futuristic technology only when necessary.
2350;"While many will complain that there is not enough futuristic visuals and action scenes to satisfy their ""Summer Experience"" cravings, ""Minority Report"" is a wonderfully crafted experience which although uses the Spielberg ""Personal Feelings"" dramatics a little too much and could have had a more happening ending it will satisfy the thinking man movie goer isntead of the visual effect thrillride craving one."
2351;The movie is very suspenseful, and it's action packed.
2352;That in itself is an interesting concept.
2353;When Anderton, becomes one of the criminals he is in the fight of his life!!!
2354;I was really into this movie, and if you don't have super high expectations, you will find this movie to be a really good one.
2355;The precogs were a nice twist in the film.
2356;There is a certain part of the film where choice plays a huge part in the film.
2357;I really liked that philosophical aspect of the film.
2358;Minority Report is one of very few movies that deals with the hugely important subject of invasion of privacy `gone wild' and the resultant destruction of individual rights that inevitably follows from it.
2359;while Minority Report is action.
2360;packed and reliant on science fiction and the great special effects that bring it to life, it is the underlying foundational theme/plot that those action.
2361;scenes and special effects build upon that makes this movie the outstanding success that it is.
2362;Anywho, you really feel for the main character, played very well by Tom Cruise, and I was kind of surprised that he did drugs, but that's just part of the role.
2363;The end is very intense, you should watch this just for the part where the Pre.
2364;Great movie, what you'd expect from This top.
2365;notch director and excellent premise.
2366;The old woman in the garden of living plants makes the movie worth watching alone.
2367;budgeted film of an interesting book.
2368;but done in such a ham.
2369;this movie started off really really boring, then it started to get really really good.
2370;the ending is a real shocker.
2371;all in all, this is a very cool movie to watch.
2372;it will keep you at the edge of your seat, and when its over, you'll beg for more!!!
2373;I'm not kidding, this is hands down the best motion picture that Mr. Spielberg has delivered us yet.
2374;It eclipses his previous best, which of course was Close Encounters (hey, being second on that list is like being above first on anyone elses list!)
2375;Does Minority Report succeed on these levels?
2376;The effects will boggle the mind of even the most jaded moviegoer.
2377;With A. i. , Mr. Spielberg was said to be channelling the spirit of the late Stanley Kubrick.
2378;True, but equally true here.
2379;The first hurdle to overcome is the science fiction, then you can concentrate on the film noir.
2380;"There hasn't been a murder in D. c. since the program started
2381;agatha, the female, is the most intelligent Precog but her mother,Anne Lively, wanted her back at the program's inception since she had conquered her drug addiction.
2382;Even Agatha can see Anderton's love for his son and """"all this love in the family."""
2383;Samantha Morton is hilarious as Agatha.
2384;the scenes in the shopping mall, where Anderton attempts to evade the police with Agatha's futuristic premonitions guiding him are hilarious, and numerous other scenes are interesting, notably Anderton's eye.
2385;I don't like Cruise but this movie was just good.
2386;"Easily the best film so far this year, ""Minority Report"" is well worth the money and the time of even the most casual moviegoer."
2387;MR is filled with entertaining and unexpected plot twists, as well as enlightening predictions about the future of the American criminal justice system and the basic future of the human race.
2388;Minority Report is a very fine film well worth the hype.
2389;Imagine a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, makes your head spin keeping up with the visual and narrative twists and turns, makes you jump out of your seat, and leaves you breathless at the end of it, and that's Minority Report.
2390;Far more than the action detective thriller it's billed as, MR is a story with depth, geninely unexpected moments, and one that'll stay in your head long after you've left the cinema.
2391;It is now 12 years later and we are closer than ever.
2392;Tom Cruise does a great job in this movie.
2393;professional wrestling, perhaps?That said, this is a phenomenal movie which blends a mix of creative genius, stark reality, humanity at its worst, and a precognizance of its own that is easily and chillingly recognizable in today's world of post.9/11 attempts at pre.
2394;From there it's a test of wits, strength and a clever twist on a classic murder.
2395;Alright, sounds like a good story, if a bit cliche.
2396;So what makes this movie so good?First is Steven Spielberg's brilliant direction.
2397;How refreshing to have a film where the special effects are folded INTO the mix, not used as the base.
2398;"In one of the most brilliant scenes, in which Cruise and one of the ""pre."
2399;I mentioned the special effects.
2400;some new technology or special effect that my jaw dropped simply from the surprise of a director unafraid to make them a simple backdrop.
2401;Instead, expect some slick sequences involving a futuristic world.
2402;webpage customized?There's also some comedic relief to keep this from being chilling to the bone (although if the thought of somebody touching your eye makes you queasy, I wouldn't recommend seeing this film), a surprising performance by the inconsistent Cruise, and some fantastic support from Max Von Sydow and especially Colin Farrell.
2403;Yes, this will make you think.
2404;But this is still a great movie, cream from this summer's lackluster crop, and destined (I believe) to become a classic.
2405;Spielberg's continuing exploration of dark, non.
2406;fi continues with Minority Report, a film noir whodunit set 50 years from now.
2407;In A. i., it was the creation of a robot Pinocchio to satisfy human needs for love .
2408;in Minority Report, Spielberg explores the creation of a system of Precrime to arrest would.
2409;While the psychic plotline stretches reality a bit, it leads to a lot of humor and bravura film shots.
2410;spielberg is also the master of popcorn chase scenes (Jurassic Park anyone?)
2411;style factory battle scene that is executed brilliantly.
2412;the plot itself has some fabulous twists and turns that I will not reveal here, but suffice it to say that your mind will be bent, and you'll like it.
2413;You'll enjoy this stylish blend of sci.
2414;"And ""Minority Report"" tells a pretty good one, even if it does reveal where it's going too soon and is occasionally marred by Spielberg's trademark mawkishness."
2415;Tom Cruise is hugely enjoyable as the frantic John Anderton, and Colin Farrell does a fine job of making you hate Detective Witwer.
2416;It looks great, sounds great, holds your attention for all 147 minutes, and will even have you giggling at the spectacular product placements and some unexpected comedy.
2417;Still, it's refreshing to see a bunch of filmmakers tackling a sci.
2418;fi adaptation seriously and successfully while still keeping an eye on the box.
2419;The result is a memorable film that strikes a savvy balance between deep thought and commercial appeal.
2420;Minority Report wisely walks the middle.
2421;But for the rest of us, it works.
2422;That quintessential juggernaut of the summer solstice moviegoing season has blessed us with a cinematic journey which will capture the imaginations of any and all willing participants.Yes, as with hypnosis, you have to freely allow yourself to be put under seduction by the spell.
2423;along with the celebrated Tom Cruise and the renowned conceptual mind of the late Philip K. Dick.
2424;In this fantasy world of the future, a police force.
2425;"has perfected a system whereby homicidal impulses can be sensed by mutant human beings known as Precogs
2426;And the system is, as aforementioned, perfect.
2427;The second thing people might grasp upon is the movement of the camera"
2428;Steven Spielbergs most recent work is simply, utterly, AMAZING.
2429;This movie will have you on the edge of your seat from first scene to last.
2430;I thought al of the effects were well done, the story well written, and, the acting was PHENOMENAL, one of Tom Cruise's best role in a while.
2431;"I found this movie to be rather dark, and the overall setting to be similar to the movie ""Dark City"", another excellent film."
2432;fi mystery and works very well.
2433;Once again Tom Cruise delivers . . . but as always never gets respected for it . . . .
2434;That's right . . . Hollywood's morality tells us that those are not really crimes.
2435;Think about it . . . late 70s he has title credits and he is still going strong.
2436;this movie has a great premise:they made THE discovery of the century.
2437;a spielberg production is usually meticulously crafted and also profound in many levels .
2438;freedom, humanity, future and what role every person play in this world.
2439;also outstanding was agent ed witwer .
2440;absolute genius if you ask me.
2441;this is a rather good watch .
2442;Minority Report is a good movie and kept me interested the whole way.
2443;There are a few nifty twists, but also a lot of predictable outcomes.
2444;spielberg proves that he is a master filmmaker with something that one must consider a modern masterpiece.
2445;It will stand in film history as a timecapsule of one of this era's great director's bleek vision of the near future .
2446;a very real, dark, and believable vision that will make you cringe at the thought of how close it really is.
2447;After all these years tom is still a good actor.
2448;I have seen a lot of films, but this was really good.
2449;Precrime is the ability to capture vision of the future from three twins that can envision the future of murders.
2450;the plot was solid except for a lingering question that I still can not answer.
2451;I like Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg so it was a win, win combination.
2452;The story line was interesting without being a R viewing experience.
2453;The plot takes a few more twists and turns before the movie's over, and the writer does a good job of purposefully misleading the audience in order to make the end a surprise.
2454;the best part of this movie is the plot.
2455;"Interesting and unpredictable, the screen play is near flawless and even ventures into the land of philosophy asking questions such as: ""Would it be fair to arrest someone for something they never did?"""
2456;I feel this movie deserves four stars largely because I was so impressed with the storyline and philosophical undertones.
2457;Watch this and see what you think.
2458;the movie opens with a confident, ever.
2459;"At one point, he kidnaps one of the ""precogs,"" powerfully and touchingly played by Samantha Morton, to help him prove his innocence."
2460;"It definitely is a Spielberg movie
2461;I liked the moral questions that were part of the warp and weave of the movie.
2462;The special effects were not overdone and seemed realistic for a movie set 50 years in the future.
2463;Overall, """"Minority Report"""" is about the best I have seen this year."""
2464;Spielberg is a master film maker.
2465;Some of the effects, shots, and parts of this film show us that he knows what he is doing and he knows how to do it.
2466;He takes subtle scenes and makes them extraordinary.
2467;He takes complex scenes and shows us how intriquet and poetic he can be with objects on screen.
2468;The way things move, the camera's view, all of it is magnificient.
2469;(A good democratic lesson if you ask me) But instead it's all wrapped up in a neat bow by the time the credits role.
2470;This movie got a bad reputation, but its creativity and moral questions are what keep the movie interesting.
2471;Tom Cruise is a good actor and the others were good too but the moral questioning is the movie.
2472;has been deemed a success and is on the verge of going national.
2473;Certainly, it's the most adult orientated of his films.
2474;For the most part it is a very enjoyable and intelligent film, which shouldn't fail to entertain most audiences.
2475;For once, the Amazon critics have it right.
2476;Tnis movie ranks with Bladerunner, Vanilla Sky, and the underrated A. i. ESPECIALLY Bladerunner (add in Dark City).
2477;He was always the romantic pretty boy.
2478;But his last two movies, Vanilla Sky and now Minority Report, have made me a fan.
2479;And I have always liked a good Spielberg film.
2480;This film is not just a great expo for Spielberg special effects, it is a great thriller a la Hitchcock.
2481;He has to overcome incredible odds to prove he wasn't going to commit the murder the precog's predicted.
2482;this is a dark film, and the whole movie is shot in near black and white.
2483;The fururistic vision of personalized advertising via retinal scanning is absolutely scary.
2484;I guarantee I will close my eyes in the future.
2485;this is one of the best sci.
2486;This is an excellent murder mystery not to be ignored.
2487;Trust me, you will want to see this movie.
2488;He knows its in a public apartment housing project.
2489;Interesting premise, decent acting, and some cool visions of the future.
2490;"THe ""widescreen"" copy I got is really a wide screen image on a 4:3 black background."
2491;"In my opinion, action movies such as quot
2492;Sure, I have seen plenty of movies in which an innocent man must defend his honor.
2493;There are people that might have enjoyed the movie a little less than I did, but I appreciate originality, jumping in my seat, and being shocked at least 1 or 2 good times.
2494;The Minority Report is another example of what happens when humans try to play God.
2495;It also underscores the repeated lesson that humans are always subject to err, even when they craft the most efficient of inventions.
2496;And can we completely trust those who are behind the controls?
2497;These questions are brought to light and are addressed with varying degrees of success in this film directed by Steven Speilberg.
2498;He delivers his best work in what is really an underrated performance.
2499;trusty Max Von Sydow also hold their own impressively in their respective roles.
2500;And the special effects are thrilling, and, thankfully, are not overdone to PlayStation extremes.
2501;In its 2.5 hours, """"The Minority Report"""" kept me interested and attentive, though Speilberg has certainly made better films."""
2502;above average summer flick that picks at the brain just as well as it thrills.
2503;In my school of cinema, it gets a solid B.
2504;Spielberg is definitely one of our national treasures!Cruise is impeccable!Art direction.
2505;what an amazing visual journey.
2506;john Williams delivers the goods again.
2507;"That happened to be a slightly edited quote from ""Minority Report"" This movie is excellent."
2508;There is a great plot twist towards the end that I wouldn't even think about telling you.
2509;packed and actually quite scary.
2510;This movie has great sets, from newspapers with moving images to billboards that recoginze you.
2511;And the cars, they are fantastic.
2512;I would reccomend this movie strongly for its great depiction of the future, unparalleled plot, stunning visuals, and, of course, the ac.
2513;just when you think mr speilberg ran out of insperation,he directs this gem.
2514;the plot was deep,the acting from all stupendous,the effects were,well,speilbergesque.
2515;and im really thrilled by tom cruises performance.
2516;i dont give him the credit he deserves.
2517;In the year 2055 everything is nice and neat and orderly except for John Anderton's (Tom Cruise) apartment.
2518;In Washington D. c. John works for an experimental pre.
2519;After a successful nine year experiment, the Justice Department has begun to question how can you find someone guilty of a crime they didn't commit?
2520;This sets off a long series of twisted events that make this a good sci.
2521;the film is a bit long, but relevant to today.
2522;And from there their was so many twists and turns I had to watch it again to fully understand the movie.
2523;But if you see one movie this month see The Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers but if you watch two see Minority Report.
2524;Minority Report is an amazing movie.
2525;"It's another Spielberg masterpiece
2526;The plot is great and the movie itself has so many twists and turns.
2527;You have got to go see Minority Report.
2528;Excellent little scifi action romp, with fine performances all around.
2529;Everyone's said the Spiderman is the best movie of the year and I agreed w/ them until I saw Minority Report.
2530;Minority Report is everything you could ever want in a movie.
2531;The plot is soo thick and deep it'll keep u on the edge of your seat.
2532;The plot got thicker and deeper and juicier every second.
2533;And it kept getting better until the end.
2534;It takes place 50 years from now and much of the technolgy could very possible take place when we reach 2050.
2535;The best movie i've seen this summer and probably one of the best movies i've ever seen.
2536;steven Spielberg is perhaps the only director in the history of film who has the ability to extract almost every human emotion in all of his films, whether its true terror (""""Jaws""""), utter anguish and despair (""""Schindler's List""""), absolute awe (""""Jurassic Park"""", """"Close Encounters of the Third Kind""""), pride (""""Saving Private Ryan""""), laughter (""""Hook""""), and love (""""E. t."""")."""
2537;Minority Report is a film that promotes suspicion, and more importantly, how greed can deteriorate the soul.
2538;"Spielberg delivers his most authoritative picture since ""Saving Private Ryan"", enchanting the audience using superb special effects and a cerebral screenplay based off Philip K. Dick's brilliant short story."
2539;very good special effects, decent action, and a good story.
2540;A very sleek and beautifully shot piece by Spielberg who does once again take a step farther away from what he is so known for.
2541;Like Total Recall, and Blade Runner before it, the story was adapted from the work of Philip K. Dick and like those films it offers many interesting subjects that can be viewed as challenging.
2542;don't expect Blade Runner, but do expect possibly one of the closest films to date to get the cyberpunk energy right, so just sit back and enjoy this as Hollywood fluff with just a little bit of artistic integrity behind it and you will enjoy.
2543;Take a look above and you'll find that a lot of people recommend Blade Runner in addition to this movie.
2544;"Okay, while ""Blade Runner"" has and most likely always will be the best film adaptation of a Philip K Dick story, ""Minority Report"" is a close second."
2545;what you get here is a very timely tale given today's society.
2546;But the imagery is good, the writting is good, the acting is well done, and the story flows evenly through the two hours.
2547;my wife and I discussed this film's failures for two full days after viewing it.
2548;certainly the film was interesting to look at, but was ultimately only swiss cheese.
2549;This is an interesting story with many innovative ideas and gadgets.
2550;Tom Cruise makes the whole thing believable.
2551;The cast is great including Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton, and Max Von Sydow.
2552;It's a long movie, but it moves along fine.
2553;Excellent Cruise+Spielberg+John Williams delve into free will.
2554;An absolutely spellbinding experience to watch.
2555;A beautififul portrayal of the future, and great plot based on the novel.
2556;Stephen Speilberg's genius shows though every aspect of this film.
2557;And what better touch than John William's music adding luster to the magnificent camera shots and colors portrayed in the film.
2558;this movie has a lot of suspense.
2559;The story held my attention from beginning to end.
2560;There is also a few scenes with great special effects.
2561;In my opinion, this is Tom Cruise's best film.
2562;And I have become more involved with local politics because of this.
2563;"The movie was perfectly directed to portray a not so distant future and, unlike other ""flying."
2564;"car"" futuristic movies, Minority Report is in touch with the reality that we all will still be walking instead of flying, taking the bus\subway."
2565;A cut above the usual science fiction fare, in the sense that this film relies on plot suspense, rather than being overly dependent on CGI, robots, spaceships, etc. to keep our interest.
2566;"Having that kind of power as one of the ""pre."
2567;Suspense is intense (hey, that rhymes . . . )What I didn't like: Not much.
2568;But this futuristic thriller is so well.
2569;crafted, I can't think of what I would change.
2570;The films Blade Runner, Total Recall, Screamers, Paycheck, A Scanner Darkly, Next, and The Adjustment Bureau were all based on stories or books that he wrote.
2571;Minority Report is yet another of his stories developed for the big screen and one of the most popular.
2572;This ingenious film was Directed by Stephen Spielberg and starred Tom Cruise.
2573;To his credit Cruise was very good and exciting throughout, showing a lot of charisma, it was unexpected, but a welcome change from what we normally see from him.
2574;This terrific futuristic tale tells the story of pre.
2575;Things are going well for him, that is until his name comes out of the machine and he becomes a target of his own men.
2576;The action and chase sequences were fantastic, as was the direction and special effects.
2577;Minority Report is a long, complex story, but it's fast paced, visually impactful, and will make you think.
2578;Minority Report was the best movie i saw this year,And it will become one of my favorites of all time.
2579;this movie is full of action and Suspence!
2580;You will enjoy it for sure!!
2581;The film begins well, as a lean mean tech.
2582;and the requisite sentimental family affirming stuff, and you have yet another Spielberg film that hasn't the slightest idea of what it really wants to be, and ends up trying to be everything at once, and falls apart in the process.
2583;Expectations can shape one's approach to a movie.
2584;Instead, a tense tapestry of intrigue, emotions and.
2585;the acting was subtle, yet crisp and often poignant.
2586;the technical effects and atmosphere balanced well.
2587;bottom line: Minority Report offers drama, intrigue, great acting, and much to ponder.
2588;I'll start telling why this movie rules!
2589;Set in the chillingly possible future of 2054, Steven Spielberg's Minority Report is arguably the most intelligently provocative sci.
2590;Up until then the film is reasonably suspenseful and fascinating to look at.
2591;Spielberg has done much better, of course.
2592;Good movie with a futuristic view.
2593;It's a bit obvious in spots but its entertaining.
2594;If you like Tom Cruise you will like this movie.
2595;Amazed at how great a film this is, and shocked at why I never bothered to watch it until now.
2596;Steven Spielberg has long been a favorite of mine when it comes to directors, and I always thought Tom Cruise wasn't too bad an actor himself.
2597;But with that said, Minority Report is an excellent piece of science fiction that works on a number of levels.
2598;For me personally, I enjoyed a lot of the film's moral and philosophical quandaries about science in general, its eventual over.
2599;Spielberg does a tremendous job weaving all of these issues into a deep enough narrative that gets you thinking, but also manages to entertain, as seen by some of the very sleek action sequences and visual effects.
2600;I also enjoyed a great deal of the screenplay and how it dispersed just the right amounts of action, adventure, drama, mystery, and thriller, never faltering and building up to a very satisfying last act.
2601;Regardless, though, it's an excellent movie crafted by one of the best in the business and well.
2602;acted by a great group of core actors in Cruise, Farrell, von Sydow, and even Peter Stormare with his brief appearance.
2603;Minority Report is a film that, like a lot of science fiction, has more questions than answers, but with a cool and stylish kind of gritty sheen that will probably satisfy serious and popcorn audiences alike.
2604;Minority Report is presented by Paramount in absolute pristine fashion.
2605;From the very beginning of the film to its end Janusz Kaminski's dark, yet gorgeous cinematography his preserved to perfection.
2606;Sharpness and image detail also look quite good with a great deal of dimensionality and depth between the actors, visual, and CG effects.
2607;Blacks are extremely deep with fine detail between lines and shadows, never losing consistency or getting lost within the photography, thanks in large part to the complimenting contrast.
2608;I actually hadn't seen a Spielberg movie on BD until Minority Report, so I was pleasantly surprised at what I heard.
2609;first) and it's subtle, yet immersive presence.
2610;It does a good job setting the pace and mood for the film and gives off some excellent fidelity for heavy string and percussion instruments in particular.
2611;In terms of effects, the sound design stays mostly quiet, as a lot of the movie is dialogue.
2612;But being the master film.
2613;maker Spielberg is, what action and chase sequences he does use manage to really give the sound system a workout.
2614;perfect, directionality and separation are tight and discernible from one another, and LFEs, while not too frequent, really give the room a pleasant rumble when present.
2615;Amounting to almost three hours worth of information, I learned quite a bit from these extras and found it fascinating just how much work went into all the production aspects.
2616;Everything from casting and writing, set and prop design, special and visual effects, sound design, music composition, and cinematography are covered to great length.
2617;In particular, I really enjoyed the Phillip K. Dick segment and a lot of the comments from cast and crew about the film's production and adaptation.
2618;But with that said, the extras still offer quite a bit of food for thought.
2619;5.0Minority Report is another excellent entry into the science fiction genre.
2620;In the hands of Steven Spielberg, he manages to infuse a very thought.
2621;provoking premise with a fun, action.
2622;packed screenplay making for a very entertaining, yet poignant film that brings about a lot of questions in the process.
2623;While the narrative isn't quite as focused as I'd hoped for in certain aspects, the film itself is still superbly produced, finely acted, and presented extremely well on Blu.
2624;ish price), Minority Report comes highly recommended.
2625;I really enjoyed it and would recomend this all the way!Note: This movie had a lot of twists and turns, and required you to do a little bit of thinking, so of course my dad came away with a feeling of confusion.
2626;aside from this, it had a very good story.
2627;To sum it up, there is a person who works with the United States pre.
2628;The whole story unfolds with twists and turns, characters seem to change right before your eyes.
2629;the music is awsome, very well done.
2630;the music along with the action scenes reminds me, a great deal, of Star Wars II.
2631;the visual effects are stunning and keep the feeling that you are truly IN a futuristic film.
2632;Dystopia fiction finds its way back into popular culture with Minority Report.
2633;there are many twists and turns and stunning visual effects in the film and Tom Cruise delivers a performance that you can't complian about.
2634;His performance makes you go back and forth about his character his motives and ultimately what is happening in the film.
2635;It is easy to see why he is becoming the next superstar of the movies.
2636;In a generation where 'new' is all that matters Colin Farrel shows staying power and talent.
2637;minority Report could easily get lost in the special effects grandure, but the story shines and the acting draws the viewer in, the action is just a special treat.
2638;When I first saw Minority Report, I knew I wanted to see it again.
2639;I really liked the beginning of the movie.
2640;The precogs were, in my opinion, the best characters in the movie, especially the brains of the three of them.
2641;This is a masterpiece, spielberg and cruise both meet at the top for this amazing thriller.
2642;this is a gift from the gods for film lovers, people who enjoy every little detail of the films which keep them living and breathing.
2643;i saw minority report 4 times and i am firmly convinced that it is a truly great film.
2644;it's one of spielberg's best and reaffirms his greatness after the lukewarm ai.
2645;needless to say, john williams provides an understated but great score.
2646;the editor, michael kahn, provides his most important contribution in the films chilling, suspenseful opening sequense.
2647;overall, one of steve's best and most powerful films.
2648;It is the nation's most advanced crime force, a perfect system.
2649;One of his (Steven Spielberg) most compelling and entertaining movies ever.
2650;"fi area
2651;There are great chase scenes, hauntingly realistic picture of the future world, and equally impressive acting from the leading actor Tom Cruise, whose role is not 100% heroic.
2652;the film presents effective actions, and as I said, its visuals are impeccable, but as you know, Steven sometimes overreaches himself, and he did it again.
2653;To me, those """"yoga"""" and """"meat"""" and, well, as I said """"eyes"""" should have been left in the cutting room."""
2654;"as for Tom Cruise's career, I can say ""Minority Report"" is the best so far since his film."
2655;The first half hour of watching this I was amazed that this was a Steven Spielberg film.
2656;The action and pace is great and there really is not a dull moment in the film.
2657;I also enjoyed seeing Max Von Sydow on screen again.
2658;Just relax and let it take you for a really fun ride.
2659;notch film that's done by the best.
2660;Very cool if you like adventure and special effects.
2661;It's a very interesting movie, deal with a lot of high new technology.
2662;i think that deal all more with imagination!
2663;it's very amazing to see how far our mid can go!
2664;But adding the fact of the ideia the film is just amazing.
2665;All of the light colors are amplified to a very bright white and the darker colors are hidden in black shadows.
2666;Everything has an intense aura and anything that light strikes becomes a bright white spot on the screen.
2667;up, watchable version will surface somewhere.
2668;Minority Report, I would say, is one of the best science fiction films to be released over the past twenty.
2669;Minority Report obviously had a lot of effort put into it by both the filmmakers and its actors and the result is a brilliant thriller.
2670;In the past decade I would call it Spielberg's best, ranking among his other great thrillers, `Raiders of the Lost Ark', and `Jaws'.
2671;fi master Philip K. Dick (Blade Runner, Total Recall, A Scanner Darkly) and it ranks up with Blade Runner as the greatest adaptations of his work.
2672;what really makes this movie stand out is not the visual effects (though, they certainly are amazing), but it is the human aspect of this film that makes it a memorable experience for the audience.
2673;The film manages to cater to all human emotions contained within the plot, from the fear of loss, obsession, greed, fear, insecurity, and many more.
2674;"tom Cruise pulls a very believable performance and I consider this one of the best of his ""Average Joe"" performances."
2675;He is perfectly believable as a sad soul who only wishes to make up for his past mistakes and punish the criminals of the world.
2676;John Anderton is suffering, but he hides it well, going on with his job.
2677;It's the compelling characters and performances from the actors that make the difference between a good movie and a great movie.
2678;the special effects of this film are amazing, providing a believable, yet still fascinating view of the future.
2679;Unlike visions presented in Blade Runner, and to a certain degree Total Recall, this is a very clean, well kept design for the future.
2680;All the buildings shine and all vehicles appear to be in tip.
2681;top condition, but like those other Dick based films the underlying structure of society is as corrupt as ever.
2682;How the effect crew for this film was skipped over by the Academy I will never understand, because even two years after I first saw the film many of the visuals remain stuck in my mind.You should not miss Minority Report, because in my opinion it is one of the best films ever made, let alone one of the best science fiction films ever made.
2683;For a thrilling, emotional, and mentally stimulating movie experience I can't recommend Minority Report strongly enough to give the film credit, for it goes above and beyond what so many other films have done.
2684;stop thrill ride of a movie.
2685;This is a bizare tale that in some ways the same strange universe as A. i. Artificial intelligence.
2686;this story is action packed yet tragic at the same time.
2687;I would highly recomend this to anyone out there who enjoys an action film, a sci fi film, or incredibly entertaining film.
2688;in the end this is well worth checking into.
2689;Dude this is the coolest movie ever Tom Cruse is great in it and dude this is one dark ass film I mean it doesnt really even have a happy ending but the action and plot is good.
2690;I liked this movie because it gives us a glimpse into what life might be like if we could predict the future.
2691;Its shows the positives and negatives if we did.
2692;The special effects attached to the film were quite clever.
2693;The first has to do with the status of his security clearance: it never changes.
2694;otherwise, it's a enjoyable flick to watch, and does raise some very interesting questions.
2695;A very original, interesting plot of mind readers saving society from murder.
2696;Sort of a play off Total Recall, but the script is strong.
2697;Really liked the futuristic panoramas and scenes that go in and out of future/past consciousness.
2698;"Very innovative
2699;This is one of those movies to which you can find yourself going back to once in a while.
2700;humans (just) who can see into the future and predict murders.
2701;Now all that's left of the movie are several interesting plot twists and Cruise's mission to clear his name.
2702;visually, this movie is pretty nice .
2703;I liked the """"the technology already exists"""" feel to some of the infrastructure."""
2704;There's an interesting bird's eye scene in an apartment block that I found amusing and the grungier sets put me in mind of Blade Runner at times .
2705;this is a good movie for that.
2706;But that's easy to do with most sci.
2707;Spielberg has produced a good movie but I think he may have focus.
2708;While most of the movie is tight, believable and suspenseful, the last ten minutes or so appear to have been written by the same folks who brought us the Teletubbies.
2709;The surprises and twists that come along are not executed very well.
2710;You can predict a lot of what is coming, and in the end it's just a good movie and not a great one.
2711;My wife has been talking about rewatching this movie for years, we finally got it and it was a great story and looked great.
2712;Perhaps I'm in the minority on this, but I find Minority Report to be one of the best adaptions of a Philip K. Dick story.
2713;Despite this, the film is successful because of the premise, the basic plot, the well written characters and Spielberg's sure handed direction.
2714;the visual effects are stunning and the storytelling style is more akin to Kubrick than Spielberg.
2715;It's clear that Spielberg's collaboration with Kubrick has had an impact on his style.
2716;despite its flaws, Minority Report signals new maturity and depth for Spielberg as a film director.
2717;It's a powerful piece of work that hammers the message home a bit too hard, but still manages to capture your interest and imagination.
2718;The extras are nice and include a discussion with Cruise and Spielberg about the making of the film and their perception of its meaning.
2719;The archives section includes production concepts, photos and gives you a sense of the evolution of the film from script to screen.
2720;the most important thing, though, is the story.
2721;I believe he would have been happy with the film as it ably reflects many of Dick's themes about the definition of self, paranoia and the flimsy nature of the reality around us.
2722;In the year 2054 the Justice Department has set up it's first Precrime unit in Washington DC.
2723;This future world that Spielberg creates is extremely well thought out and detailed, some real brilliance here (I can't say too much).
2724;paced film, not just with action, but also with dialog, ideas and new concepts.
2725;The Dark Knight (Christian Bale) is perfect picture, 10/10 liquid crystal clear picture while Minority Report is 7/10.
2726;I have always been a great fan of Steven Spielberg!
2727;I grew up with his films and I consider both Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan to be two of the best dramas ever produced.
2728;For the majority of the time, most of Spielberg's films are total masterpieces.
2729;now, Spielberg has gotten even darker with the science fiction film called Minority Report starring Tom Cruise in one of his best roles.
2730;Great action, terrific special effects, and of course top direction by the master himself, Spielberg, make Minority Report a can't miss by any standards.
2731;I loved Minority Report,a clever story and amazing special effects made for a great futuristic experience.
2732;I must confess that some of the philosophical undertones of this movie were poignant to me.
2733;That said, I think the filmmakers employed some cute effects, and the vision of our world in the future was eye.
2734;Steven Spielberg has joined the ranks of Ridley Scott and Paul Verhoeven in adapting a Philip K. Dick story to the big screen.
2735;It was taut, suspenseful, and .
2736;credible, in that the film did not violate its own logic.
