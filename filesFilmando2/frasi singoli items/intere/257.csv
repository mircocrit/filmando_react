id;spiegazione
1;I love the Blu Ray transfer.
2;Story wise it works better with age.
3;Nicholson gives a fine performance accompanied by Pfieffer.
4;Movie is a more performance oriented than usual special effects.
5;I love both Jack Nicholson and Michelle and Michelle Pfeiffer in this movie.
6;It was wonderful and glad it was liked.
7;Wonderful preformances from Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfiffer!
8;Finnaly a werewolf movie that shows us the feelings behind the bitten not just some blood lust, and paints them as good as the man they've entered.
9;This underrated film is a genuine find.
10;Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer are terrific together.
11;And James Spader does an excellent job of playing a smarmy villain.
12;there are little vignettes that stay in one's mind and draw attention to how well done the acting and storyline is.
13;jack Nicholson must have thoroughly enjoyed doing this film because of the dramatic metamorphosis involved.
14;Wolf (1994), starring Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer, is one of the few werewolf movies of its time that does a good job portraying what it would be like to become a werewolf.
15;So anyway, some cool stuff starts to happen to him.
16;He can hear better, see without his glasses, smell better, etc.
17;He can also hear things like crazy good, and they do a cool sequence of him listening to everything happening in his building (ear.
18;twitching and everything, very easy to accomplish on the screen, of course, but a wonderful touch nonetheless).
19;He finds a book on wolf.
20;spirits taking over human bodies, and this leads to that and soon he's got an appointment with an old Hindu dude who wrote the book way back in the day.
21;He goes to meet this guy, they have a talk, Jack gets a necklace.
22;oh yeah, Jack also meets Michelle Pfeiffer, whose dad is a rich jerk.
23;bear from Wes Craven's Cursed, they were absolutely right.
24;you've got yourself a perfect wolf.
25;Ol Jacky boy does a great performance in this, but more importantly, the guy is already a werewolf as far as his face is concerned.
26;Just give him the right teeth and eyes and you've got it down.
27;If a good man becomes a wolf, then it will be a good wolf.
28;Had me laughing for a good minute there.
29;horror with a decent story and good presentation.
30;Very precise and neat in terms of direction and some fabulous acting from Nicholson, Spader and Pfeiffer.
31;'Wolf' is one of the very rare horror films that really keep you by the edge of your seat and eyes glued to the screen but hey!
32;The film drags on for a little longer time, but the neat direction and acting overcomes it.
33;Jack Nicholson delivers a brilliant performance, his expressions alone are enough to convince the viewer.
34;An unforgettable, tiny gem of a film.
35;It's a simple story but hey, it's Jack Nicholson!
36;This movie I really like.
37;The best thing is that they manage a great werewolf movie with little gore.
38;The plot is evenly paced and clever.
39;Jack played his role VERY well, especially as a werewolf.
40;Pfiefer was also good as the love interest.
41;One word of advice: If you want to enjoy this movie, don't view it as a critic.
42;The music works well in some parts, but could've been improved to add more chill.
43;The movie is very original and is recommended highly for horror, Nicholson, and Pfiefer fans!
44;Liked it anyway and have viewed it several times.
45;and he got the gorgeous gal in a nice twist in the tale.
46;Jack Nicholson makes the perfect gentle, mild.
47;Great star power, atmosphere, and lush interiors in this film, with Pfeiffer as the blue.
48;David Hyde Pierce is also perfectly cast as Will's coworker and buddy who stands by him and whose role could have been expanded so he would have had more screen time, but hey, I'll take what I can get.
49;um, probably not, but hey, suspension of disbelief is important here), but are unique and interesting enough to keep you guessing as to how the action will end and who will survive.
50;Sit down with a hot cup of tea on a stormy night and enjoy this great re.
51;The scenario is structured as much as a jewel !
52;Sure i like this film !
53;This simply is one of the most realistic expos s ever on the publishing business.
54;Having worked at several major publishers, I can tell you that thing pretty much work exactly as they appear in the film.
55;Frankly there are so many well.
56;it is true that these days becoming possessed of an animal spirit is an easy way up the corporate publishing ladder.
57;That has gotten me ahead of a few rivals I can tell you!
58;Jack Nicholson gives a Crazed Performance up there with The Shining and Mike Nichols Directing is Subtle enough to please Critics, while also being Strong enough to Satisfy Horror fans.
59;Yes, this is science fiction but one of the best I've seen.
60;Product came in a timely manner and in the condition it was avertised in.
61;This is one of my husband's favorite movie.
62;Really, the picture of the movie look more like a VHS tape.
63;Will Randall [Jack Nicholson] is a meek editor at a New York publishing house, with few people he can trust.
64;He becomes charming and self.
65;assured, winning the affections of Alden's daughter, Laura [Michelle Pfeiffer]
66;But he also has a taste for flesh, and if he is to be free, he will have to run the gauntlet of police and conniving co. workers.
67;assured wolf with his usual finesse and expertise, and the supporting cast provides him with good material to work from.
68;Add excellent direction by veteran Mike Nichols, and you have a rich, complex story filled with taut suspense that will hold you all the way through.
69;it's sexy and scary and the whole cast is amazing.
70;Of course Jack Nicholson and James Spader are terrific, but I especially like Michelle Pfieffer in this movie.
71;She was perfectly cast in this part.
72;and Jack Nickolson was absolutely great in the part.
73;This is a movie I'd forgotten about, but thought it was worth going back to and writing a review.
74;Suddenly Randall has a wild streak and is fighting to be 'alpha male' again, though not even he is aware at first of how deadly his ambition has grown.
75;This is a really cool spin on the werewolf tales and I like the interaction between Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer who plays a rich man's daughter with an attitude.
76;Keep in mind the special effects were not 'up to date' on this one, but it is still worth a watch.
77;Nicholson has done it again.
78;Menacing and tender, ruthless and soft, he is a great screen presence.
79;This picture moved rather slowly as modern.
80;day pictures go, savoring every detail and allowing the plot to build.
81;And James Spader did what he does best .
82;played the ultimate slime with the manners of a choir boy.
83;As one newspaper reviewer noted, he radiates predatory self.
84;confidence, something I think he has done in all his roles.
85;The movie has a very romantic core, as Jack and Michelle come together and try to battle the wolf problem.
86;Real love of the ages type stuff.
87;Here's a werewolf movie done with some style and some class.
88;It features effective villains played by James Spader and Christopher Plummer and the always unpredictable Jack Nicholson.
89;nicholson has the lead role, naturally, and is refreshingly low.
90;day horror movies but yet this is such an intense story that you don't lose interest.
91;It's pretty good in the visual department, too, and it doesn't hurt to have Michelle Pfeiffer to ogle.
92;Jack Nicholson steals the show.
93;Good acting, good story line, fair special effects.
94;A werewolf movie that actually has a happy ending!
95;Jack nicholson is awesome in this thrilling movie about a guy who gets bite by a wolf and dosn't relize he was bite by a werewolf and turns into one himself overtime.
96;this is a good movie and i recommedn it for everyone of the age 14 and up
97;to be 100% honest with you, this movie stunk!
98;i was really looking forward to it as a fan of both jack nicholson as well as this genre of movies in general.
99;Good Jack Nicholson movie, not too scary and the special effects are pretty good.
100;I am glad I got it.
101;Love interest Michelle Pfeifer looks good and disinterested at the same time, while villain James Spader is, I suppose, comic relief.
102;The horror genre and werewolf movies have never been my favorites, but I really loved this movie.
103;They keep you guessing in this film, and it is full of suspense.
104;Of course Jack Nicholsen does a great job playing a wolfman, but his best and most compelling scenes are when he's (relatively) normal and sitting around thinking about what he may have done.
105;Michelle Pfeifer is also excellent, and I liked seeing Ross from Friends (David Schwimmer I think) playing a NY cop, even if it was for just a few moments.
106;I recommend this movie for Nicholsen fans and those who like horror movies or suspense.
107;This is an interesting film, because it's partly a character study of a tired, middle aged publisher and partly a horror film about werewolves.
108;This movie has top notch acting, an intriuging story and a cool ending.
109;Jack Nicholson plays a werewolf, and he's the most natural werewolf since Boris Karloff.
110;fans of werewolf movies may be surprised at the timbre of this particular tale.
111;The whole story is very surreal and has an everpresent dream.
112;The special effects of werewolves and transformation are actually pretty scarce.
113;this is a well done film if you're looking for a more cerebral type of WW film than the normal fare.
114;As I mentioned, the cast is also a higher calibre than normal.
115;Among the many,many flics on the subject of werewolves, this entry has in its cast one of the most beautiful actresses ever to have been in motion pictures.
116;Yes, I love the very presence of this doll in all of her pictures so far, but this picture Wolf holds ones attention with it's story line and a very good cast from beginning to end.
117;Excellent cast ( James Spader is so young!)
118;, and a good story that keeps moving.
119;This is one of the two best werewolf movies .
120;Starring Jack Nicholson, Michele Pfeiffer, Christopher Plummer and James Spader, it is directed with a sure hand by Mike Nichols.
121;it's intelligent, riveting, at times scary and realistic in its portrayal of the human concerns of people facing life and the super.
122;I truly loved this movie!
123;Of course anything Jack Nicholson or Michelle Pfeiffer is in is bound to be incredible!
124;Jack as usual with regards to any role he plays pours everything into it.
125;He has this incredible laid back way of acting.
126;No matter what role he plays he makes his character so believable.
127;Michelle as well is a very talented actress in deed!
128;It's a Werewolf romance in a sense.
129;Much to her liking it would seem.
130;A fun movie, as well as romantic, and of course a great werewolf fantasy.
131;This was in great condition and I have enjoyed watching it.
132;This is one of my favorite movies and I will order from this company again!
133;Jack Nicholson, Michelle Pfeiffer and James Spader star in this 1994 horror film.
134;jack and Michelle have good chemistry and Rick Baker's make.
135;up effectsare excellent as usual.
136;ray has good picture and sound, but noextras.
137;I still recommend this good, romantic horror flick.
138;First, yes this is a nice movie and worth seeing!
139;If you are expecting horror and suspense look somewhere else but if you are looking for a nice story, this one is nice.
140;both Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer are great actors.
141;it tells a nice story.
142;But I found this movie to be entertaining enough.
143;such as solving the murder cases at the end of the movie!
144;Will is also the editor.
145;Will feels strangely rejuvenated, even as he develops extremely heightened senses.
146;His newly gained confidence allows him to take charge of his life and even revenge himself on those what done him wrong.
147;once in a blue full moon, a schlock genre spits out a gem.
148;For a contemporary film, it wallows in this marvelous gothic atmosphere.
149;There are wicked, unexpected flourishes of humor, and even a smattering of social satire, if one presumes that Will Randall's gradual descent from reserved refinement to uninhibited wolfishness is a metaphor for the predatory, in.
150;trenches facet of the New York publishing world.
151;gaining a huge pair and constructing such a ruthless yet elegant get.
152;Nicholson submits a layered interpretation, delivering a fascinating study of a cultured man's growing horror as he succumbs to his baser instincts.
153;The fascinating bits all have to do with that part of him which revels in this turn to savagery.
154;brainer
155;WOLF instead relies more on suspense and the sense of horror being evoked thru effective use of lighting and score, thru adroit character study and spot.
156;In the final tally, WOLF is overwhelmingly a terrific horror movie, dark and subtle and literate, romantic and wicked funny.
157;formidable cast with Nicholson at the top, flanked by Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Plummer and James Spader, under the secure directorial hand of Mike Nichols.
158;What struck me after watching this film recently is the possibility that the transformation of man (or woman) into wolf can be viewed as a blessing, a gift.
159;It certainly is for Nicholson's character Will Randall.
160;What he gets out of it is an escape from the treacherous brutality and betrayal of homosapiens and the freedom to make his life what he wants it to become.
161;we get a clue of this early on from his truthful, but tasteless (and funny) remark at the party about the decline of civilization and the triumph of pop and therapeutic culture.
162;Added to this is the likely possibility that he'll wind up with his new love as an added bonus.
163;The cast of the movie that give the sense of credibility by their very plainly portrayed status.
164;the way the beast is introduced.
165;i love the story .
166;then he gets a gift.
167;he comes into his own, along the gift of the beast comes new confidence and a strength he had found lacking for a long time.
168;the twist in the plot comes with the entrance of another Wolf and a battle for the lady fair.
169;jack triumphs in this rolw and plays the part as if he were a man of thirty, his energy and virility a wonder to watch.
170;I have always liked the 'wolfman' and this was a pretty good rendition.
171;Great movie, so far removed from the Lon Channey werewolf classics.
172;Great suspense with Jack Nicholson along with good effects.
173;Jack Nicholson stars in this frighteningly good movie as Will Randall, an editor in chief of a book publishing company.
174;The car strikes the wolf, and Will stops to investigate.
175;Stewart Swinton, played by James Spader, has received Will's old position.
176;meanwhile, Will is undergoing physical changes, such as a heightened sense of smell and hearing, all caused by the wolf's bite.
177;Which wolf will win?This is an excellent movie.
178;Jack Nicholson has always been one of my favorite actors, and he was the perfect choice for this role.
179;James Spader and Michelle Pfeiffer are captivating as well.
180;Notice Michelle's yellow eyes and heightened sense of smell at the end of the movie.
181;stop and the special effects and wolf make.
182;Watch this movie and have a howling good time along the way.
183;I always take the opportunity to watch and own all of his movies.
184;The Howling series is much better.
185;2 of my favorite actors.
186;best flik on werewolf ever made.
187;See I want to be a cowboy.
188;Mr. Nicholson, please stay out of my horror genre!Oh and that anyone considers this movie to be a horror film.
189;if you love these two actors, then see the movie.
190;Still, I will definitely watch it more than once, and thoroughly enjoy it every time.
191;This is an awesome movie.
192;A asset to any Sci Fi Horror collection or Jack Nicholson fan.
193;One of my favorite movies.
194;Jack Nicholson is great in this movie.
195;He brings just the right amount of ferocity to the role.
196;The special effects are good.
197;Anyone who likes the supernatural will like this film.
198;A friend's recommendation convinced me to watch it.
199;top notch actors in all the principal roles.
200;Movie is not bad, especially the last scenes of Michelle transforming.
201;I've liked this movie ever since it came out.
202;This movie is very good.
203;Michele Pfeiffer does a good job with her role as well.
204;I'd have liked to see a sequel of some sort.
205;Much better than many of the modern Werewolf movies.
206;Two thumbs up on this movie.
207;Well directed by Mike Nichols, it features a stellar cast who give excellent performances.
208;Jack Nicholson, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Plummer, James Spader, Kate Nelligan, and David Hyde Pierce all contribute to the successful execution of this sophisticated and subtle horror film.
209;As an added bonus, those of you who are devotees of the TV series, Friends, should look for David Schwimmer's cameo appearance in the film.
210;when Jack gets back to his office, he is feeling the after effects of his interaction with the wolf.
211;betrayed by his underling who has been given his job, Jack finds himself undergoing a subtle, physical metamorphosis.
212;He no longer needs reading glasses, his hearing is extremely acute, and he has a keen, very keen, sense of smell.
213;It is these enhanced senses that lead him to discover that his wife, well played by Kate Nelligan, has shockingly betrayed his love and devotion, causing him to leave her.
214;finding himself more robust and aggressive, literally a new man, Jack goes on the attack and, and with the aid of his loyal underling, played to perfection by David Hyde Pierce, gets his job back.
215;There is a memorable scene to this effect.
216;In the process of regaining his life, Jack falls in love with the boss's beautiful daughter, played with gritty charm by Michelle Pfeiffer, and she with him.
217;still, Jack finds himself battling his inner demons over his change.
218;The transformation of Jack is subtle, and there is very lttle use of special effects to enhance his metamorphosis.
219;Jack is often able to convey to the viewer what he is undergoing with a flick of the eyebrow, a twitch of the nose, a curl of the lips.
220;It is a wonderful piece of acting and a tribute to the power of suggestion.
221;What he and she ultimately discover is that they both, in fact, have a great deal to fear, but that their initial fear was misplaced.
222;Look to a great finale.
223;This is a subtle, multi.
224;layered, symbolic type of horror film that will leave the viewer analyzing what they just saw.
225;It is simply a great werewolf film.
226;Had it on VHS and needed to replace itl Nicholson and Pfeiffer are great and James Spader plays a great villain.
227;I found the romance very interesting.
228;mike Nichols had the chance to work with a very talented cast, and special effects (slow mo and the final fight scene .
229;Michelle Pfeiffer is talented and believable as Nicholson's new love, David Hyde Pierce remarkably likeable as his loyal associate.
230;Jack's revenge on the characterwe all love to hate .
231;well, it's all here and it's all good.
232;going public, panned by most critics, Wolf will entertain you and make you wonder why you ever listen to critics, anyway!
233;Jack Nicholson delivers wonderfully in this movie.
234;It has incredible spoilers and great acting, and a very origanal plot.
235;well, rubber (what they're made out of).
236;here you have another recent Nicholson film where you have a great cast and a great director and a great movie idea.
237;but the script is just mediocre and it holds back all the actor's true star power.
238;the film ,The Pledge, was a prime example of this.Yes, Virginia there is no great Were.
239;Yet,it's just great to see Jack,Michelle Pfieffer,Christopher Plummer, all together in this were.
240;When you join the Catwoman and Joker from the Batman and Batman Returns franchise, you expect a funny movie.
241;When you see them develop a kindred affair after the wife of Nicholson's character cheats, then it really gets interesting.
242;
243;I love the beginning scene in the movie
244;I always watch it in the dark or if I can't sleep.
245;All of the actors are great.
246;The scenery is beautiful and that house and cottage!
247;My favorite Jack Nicholson line, Asparagus.
248;And I love the old Indian guy!!
249;I was very excited to find this move available here!
250;Jack and Michelle Pfeifer team up again after The Witches of Eastwick to make yet another really good film.
251;Michelle's character at the end is in for a few surprises as well.
252;This is one of my personal favorite movies, and I am one of the many who think that it is severly underrated.
253;This is not exactly your conventional horror film, it is way more itelligent, symbolic, and well.
254;mINOR grain), and VERY good sound (especially the 5.1).
255;two Audio commentaries on disc one
256;two Documentaries, one on disc one about the preproduction and scripting of the film and the acting
257;We've looked high and low for this movie and finally finding it, we are very pleased and surprised that there is more to the movie than what we saw when we watched it on network tv.
258;It's a good movie and I would recommend it to anyone.
259;I love Jack Nicholson's character, the erudite editor at publishing house, perhaps a bit weak as a man, and then I loved him more when (post wolf.
260;I love Michelle Pfeiffer's character, her toughness generally, her tenderness with the man about to become a wolf, and the way her eyes turn yellow at the end.
261;WOLF is a howling good movie, though, filled with typical werewolf scares and a penetrating script and sharp performances.
262;Nicholson is perfect as a mealy.
263;mouthed senior editor who is booted by boss Christopher Plummer in favor of his protege, the smarmy James Spader (excellent in his typical style).
264;wOLF is a classy horror film, and notoriously overlooked, but it's a good one!
265;Good werewolf tale with Jack Nicolson giving it all he has in his performance.
266;Spader also gives a good one as well.
267;I totally enjoyed this movie!Ok, as a huge horror fan, I liked the setting.
268;Unique and what better place than the corporate world for 'cut.
269;this movie has interesting visuals that aren't just blood and gore.
270;Jack is wonderful in his portrayal of a man discovering the wolf inside.
271;Maybe it has always been there?Michelle Pfeiffer plays the intriguing character of the Rich Boss's daughter who is naturally drawn to the man her father despises.
272;it's the details that make this movie.
273;The viewer is in the position of Pfeiffer's character and learns along with her.
274;the ending leaves the viewer with a wolfy grin.
275;I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end because it did what all good movies do.
276;It has good actors ( Jack Nicholson, Michelle Pfeiffer, James Spader, and Christopher Plummer).
277;Interesting spin on werewolf genre.
278;It is definitely in my top werewolf movies!!!!!!
279;com with their excellent packaging for mailing products.
280;Such a classic film with great actors and a unique story.
281;I chose this rating because I love these kind of movies.
282;Not able to find help at the doctors, he seeks the help of an alternative healer, who informs him that he is turning into a genuine wolf.
283;Her role is of course a big one, and it's easy to ascertain this just by reading the back cover blurb of the story.
284;A little romance is inevitable, and their relationship certainly proves to be an intriguing one.
285;Pfeiffer is truly gorgeous as Laura.
286;Being the rich and misunderstood beautiful girl, she makes a surprisingly sympathetic ally to Jack's character, Randall, in his time of need.
287;James Spader often plays the villainous roles, so here he fits into the part like a silk glove on a well manicured hand.
288;All acting is fine and top notch, as this is a top cast horror film, and of course this adds to the overall experience.
289;ennio Morricone's score is nearly Hitchcock like, fitting beautifully with the piece.
290;The direction by Mike Nichols is artful, skillful, and visually pleasing.
291;Being careful to choose films that suit his style (He also did the memorable Graduate), he's an underrated gem.
292;Quick and slow zooms are used often, and the cinematography is an ideal match for this type of film.
293;When a werewolf is shown, the make up job is excellent, portraying a realistic type of werewolf and not some supernaturally overcome creature.
294;where this film excels is in its more adult and modern approach to the lycanthrope legend.
295;It's learned that the change is inevitable and that things can be a blessing if you give them a chance and make the best of the situation
296;The interaction between Pfeiffer and Nicholson's character is intriguing, and their rocky romance is a thing to be reckoned with.
297;All heart warming stuff that works somehow with the werewolf story.
298;overall it's an intriguing enough film that's fun to watch for Nicholson and Pfeiffer's performance.
299;This is one of my favorite werewolf movies.
300;Very humanistic and the chemistry between JN and MP sizzles.
301;Photography and story are well done.
302;Really enjoy this movie to the max!
303;Jack and Michelle are a great acting pair!
304;One of my personal favorites.
305;Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer are the best team.
306;I love stories of classic folklore.
307;This film was done so well that the concept of lecanthropy almost seems believable.
308;The acting, as always is excellent.
309;Smart, sexy and at times funny, this is one that has aged well, and brings remnants of the old Jack, before he became a parody of himself
310;One of Jack Nicholsons greatest movies.
311;The movie arrived safely and I love watchen the movie it is very cool plus I enjoy it everytime I watch it
312;Who goes through a transformation that makes him feel young and vivacious again.
313;Who has a beautiful wife and an even more beautiful mistress.
314;And the ultimate fantasy, she's the boss' daughter.
315;While Hollywood still continues their obsession with vampire stories, Wolf has to be one of a few werewolf films that is surely worth the watch.
316;Now depending how well and how much you take your werewolf mythology, I find 'Wolf' to be a great watch every time I get to see it.
317;star cast and unique storytelling, film.
318;making that reminds me a lot of a classic Stephen King picture.
319;Jack Nicholson performance is well oiled, and does a fairly good job as the subhuman being.
320;Jack's Eastwick co. star Michelle Pfeiffer rejoins him as a aloof and loveless woman who has manages to open her heart to the character and you can definitely see their Eastwick chemistry is not lost.
321;One of my favorite Jack Nicholson roles
322;Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful and graceful.
323;Good story, direction and script as well.
324;Spader (always an interesting actor) and Nicholson make fine werewolves however.
325;It's just as good as the first time I saw it, everyone should own it.
326;Our favorite actors in their prime.
327;A 1994 movie as well made as today's movies.
328;One of the best wolf movies made and we've seen all of them.
329;i love this movie as it shows the strength and rejuvination which comes with the werewolf's bite.
330;Jack Nicholson is old but has an OK job, he has a cheating wife, and a new nose which smells a drop of tequilla in a cup of coffee on your breath.
331;I really liked how he looked as the new wolfman for a new up to date version.
332;This movie takes the whole werewolf legend to a new level.
333;It also gives you a good reference to how we as individuals have to deal with in everyday life situations, dealing with work and relationships in our personal lives, and how some people can be very diseveing and somethings you thought you knew them but you were wrong, and when things were going right until an unexcpected change in your life changes everything.
334;He has a good head on his shoulders untill after driving home one night from a business trip changes his whole life forever.
335;This is a good thinking movie as well as a pychologic thriller.
336;It's a good werewolf movie without so much blood but has a well deserved written story line.
337;It's got it twist and turns.
338;Trust me this movie is worth seeing over and over.
339;directed by Mike Nichols with a script by Wesley Strick and Jim Harrison (of Legends of the Fall fame), Nicholson is at his brilliant best as the jaded lead editor of a publishing house recently acquired by a billionaire asset stripper played in suitably predatory fashion by the excellent Christopher Plummer.
340;The movie has wit, irony, elegance and a superb and, by turns, lushly romantic and jazzy Ennio Morricone score: all this and some wonderfully amusing moments make for a truly enjoyable experience even if the label `horror' normally turns you off.
341;This movie is definitely one of them, especially because of the two starring actors!
342;This is set in modern times with a normal everyday businessman as the Wolf and involves office politics, new love, cheating wives, ambitious backstabbers and even a little comedy along with the horror factor.
343;In today's movies, that saying a lot by itself.
344;The acting is absolutely top notch, James Spader gives an A performance.
345;James gave so much of an performance, I truly growing up thought this dude was a sleaze.
346;lOL If you love an American story, an American true story, I am 35, and a male, every person can relate to Will Randle (Jack Nicholson) , some part of you has experienced the up's or down's of this character.
347;That said Wolf is an enjoyable movie, with way too little werewolf action for my heart.
348;jack makes this movie work because, he is convincing as a lycanthrope.
349;I enjoyed WOLF immensely which is why I gave it 4 stars.
350;par and I hear you brothers and sisters but.
351;WOLF was so refreshing because it protrayed a werewolf as a force of good for once and that earned it four stars from my amazon.
352;Wolf keeps the Werewolf genre' alive and does so with more class than most these days.
353;Jack Nicholson, Michelle Pfeiffer and James Spader all do their best to carry this movie off.
354;If you like them, you'll like this movie.
355;Mike Nichols brings his smart, steady hand to this biting satire of office politics.
356;day New York, Nicholson's performance is perfectly modulated, as this passive, on.
357;James Spader plays his favorite role as the yuppie backstabbing up.
358;As both transform into lupine aggressors and a beautiful woman .
359;gets between them, the fun (and horror) begins.
360;although there is much here to enjoy, it's clearly Jack's show, and he obviously is enjoying every minute of it.
361;My most absolutely favorite werewolf movie.
362;Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer are wonderful in it, and I just love anything James Spader its in anyway (he's so sexy even as a villain :P).
363;The story is so great.
364;Wolf is an entertaining comedic horror piece with over.
365;top special effects, that does please.
366;Very good director , Mike Nichols ( Regarding Henry , Working Girl , Silkwood , The Birdcage , The Graduate . )
367;It have to be good .
368;And I do like ( sometimes ) good scary staff .
369;The GIFT in some people is a gift .
370;Like a nuclear power .
371;Read other few reviews , some good reviewers did very good job , and I don't want to repead them .
372;Released during the early summer of 1994, Wolf is an interesting werewolf tale about a an aging editor.
373;as you can see, Wolf takes the werewolf legend and places it in modern New York, so don't expect the more Gothic ambiance of werewolf films like Wolfman, Curse of the Werewolf or Red Riding Hood.
374;Yet this is still very much a werewolf yarn with the horror elements associated with it.
375;As such, Will Randall's changes are positive for the most part.
376;Wolf works so well because of its emphasis on character.
377;Will is a worthy protagonist in which the common man can relate.
378;michele is effective in her role and she certainly has a striking face, but she never tripped my trigger as far as allurement goes.
379;Still, she's very good in the role.
380;In some ways he's likable and seems to show some character, but he keeps contradicting this.
