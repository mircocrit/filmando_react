I:8381;1;I would recommend any of his movies.
I:8381;2;The original version was so charming .
I:8381;3;My family loves My Neighbor Totoro.
I:8381;4;If you've seen and liked other Studio Ghibli movies, you've got to see this one.
I:8381;5;My Neighbor Totoro is great fun for adults and children alike.
I:8381;6;It also gives one a glimpse of 1940's era Japan, replete with scenic rice paddies, fashion, culture and tradition.
I:8381;7;bas (cat buss) gives the eldest daughter and her little sister (Mei) a ride to see their mother in the hospital.
I:8381;8;The film maker, Hayao Miyazaki, contributes a valuable new addition to the world of animation comparable, yet distinct from Disney's finest classics.
I:8381;9;a wonderful film for (cliche coming) children and adults alike.
I:8381;10;I would recommend this to anyone who loves foreign film.
I:8381;11;It's an adorable movie about a family learning to overcome something difficult in their lives, along with the help of the troll Totoro.
I:8381;12;Super cute and the disk itself was in good condition.
I:8381;13;One of my all time favorite movies.
I:8381;14;of children, especially with a loving father who is happy to share their young outlook on life.
I:8381;15;i have shown this movie to a group of 13 adults (including one critic who likes to analyze every film that comes along) who end up with tears in their eyes and who came up to me later and told me what a great film they thought it was.
I:8381;16;The nanny is old and ugly, but has an incredibly kind heart.
I:8381;17;The children act like the real children I've known .
I:8381;18;It was so easy to forget this was a cartoon and to identify with these people!I love the style of animation.
I:8381;19;It reminded me of some of the early Disney animations.
I:8381;20;When people laugh their mouths are too big, or steps are too long, or those things that exagerate and communicate something that realistic detail can't do.
I:8381;21;it is well worth it.
I:8381;22;i do like that it's from Disney so it has the Disney code.
I:8381;23;"The beautiful thing about Hiyao Miyazaki is how sort of ""foreign"" his story elements feel, but how readily identifiable his human characters are."
I:8381;24;The two sisters in this movie are cute to watch and interact believably with their world, not in an exaggerated manner like in many kids movies.
I:8381;25;Don't tell anyone, but there is animist Japanese religion all over this perfect animated movie.
I:8381;26;This movie is sweet and beautiful with a marvelous soundtrack.
I:8381;27;It is gentle without putting you to sleep.
I:8381;28;My neighbor Totoro is not only one of the finest animated films I have ever seen, it is one of the best movies period.
I:8381;29;It has enough heart to spead across a hundred film's, and still have some to spare.
I:8381;30;Hayao Miyazaki, the director, (also doing this years Spirited Away, released in America by Disney) has really outdone himself.
I:8381;31;My neighbor Totoro has many terrific qualities, such as the emaculate detail.
I:8381;32;(Also watch how the children walk, run, and play around, its awesomely realistic.)
I:8381;33;The way the story is handled is so unique.
I:8381;34;Any movie that has such family love is very special.
I:8381;35;These sisters, Mel, and Satzuki, genuinly love one another, and the father loves them back.
I:8381;36;This type of affection is rampant in this movie, and its great to see.
I:8381;37;my neighbor Totoro has won many deserving awards in the children and family realm (with other awards as well), and though it was made for younger audiences, it is something that adults willalso appreciate.
I:8381;38;the animationthat was already so beautifully well donein itsintricate, warmly.
I:8381;39;this is a decent film with deep substance that any personcan feel good about taking the time to en.
I:8381;40;corporate and allow itto become an integral part of themselves in their own lives and furthermoreto even share with othersand be delighted as well to watch over and over with close friends and familyduring the years to come.
I:8381;41;it shares realities of the world's good qualities and horrors,and also how the spirits within us and the world around us do help healand grow together in harmony.
I:8381;42;it was a great justice, to the film, to re.
I:8381;43;grateful to those who had the ability andtook the time/money/and trouble to the tweaking ofsuch an irresistible masterpiece.
I:8381;44;i will be happy and proud to share with any child or adult,now and in the future, this film.
I:8381;45;This video has become a cult classic of sorts in our family.
I:8381;46;My 4 and 2 year old boy and girl LOVE it, and the animation is so beautiful that we still enjoy it with them even the fiftieth time around!The fantasy characters are enchanting.
I:8381;47;The setting and scenery are represented with care, patience and artistry.
I:8381;48;It is a real pleasure and treat to watch this imaginative story unfold again and again.
I:8381;49;This movie is one of the greatest movies of my childhood.
I:8381;50;I loved this movie dearly.
I:8381;51;so yes, I would highly recommend this movie to the fullest extent!
I:8381;52;And take a look at the price to, it's soo.
I:8381;53;It's worth it in the end!
I:8381;54;The kids keep putting it in the VCR, and I'm pleased every time they do.
I:8381;55;when you go back to certain other Disney movies, with the villains and scary scenes, you appreciate the peaceful movie this is.
I:8381;56;I find myself continually recommending it.
I:8381;57;once you see the fox 2002 version, you'll never be able to watch the disney version again I assure you .
I:8381;58;We watched it with our 3 1/2 year old daughter, who burst into tears when it ended because she wanted to see it again immediately!
I:8381;59;Bringing the works of Miyazaki (and other Studio Ghibli films) to an American audience is the best thing Disney has done in the last 10 years, bar none (yes, that includes the deal with Pixar, whose films, while charming in their own way, are often too slick by half for me).
I:8381;60;my Neighbor Totoro appeals to the kid in all of us, and takes us back to a time before deadlines and the pressures of the world came calling.
I:8381;61;"I loved the Fox version of this film
I:8381;62;I always watched it as a kid, and I still do.
I:8381;63;"The Disney version was very poorly done
I:8381;64;ok let me get this outta the way I love this film, but the thing that worries me is who is publishing it.
I:8381;65;come on this is Disney!
I:8381;66;This is one of the animation classics.
I:8381;67;The story is very engaging and scenery is gorgeous.
I:8381;68;This is an excellent childhood story unrivaled by any since Peter Pan .
I:8381;69;The plot involves Satsuke, a girl on the cusp of womanhood, moving into the country with her father and younger sister Mei, where she discovers a child's realm of wonder and make.
I:8381;70;the story is a real jewel, simply, elegantly told.
I:8381;71;The characters are especially well.
I:8381;72;depicted, complete with expressive body language and realistically animated.
I:8381;73;In part because of the excellent dub, they are all sympathetic and deeply human, instantly recognizable as real people around us.
I:8381;74;especially evocative is the portrayal of the children's make.
I:8381;75;poly furballs, and the magnificent cat.
I:8381;76;bus with great shining eyes and two mice announcing the next stop .
I:8381;77;a fantastic, enchanting examination of a child's mentality, that is also a mainstay family film.
I:8381;78;otherwise, i recommend totoro for anyone over the age of 2!
I:8381;79;it is a wonderful, feel good, magical movie!
I:8381;80;my 3 year old wants to watch it every day (not that we let him) now that we've introduced it to him and he loves the cat bus, too!
I:8381;81;See is very happy to have her own copy.
I:8381;82;Lots of happy sounds and catchy music!
I:8381;83;ive loved this movie since i was a kid!
I:8381;84;received it promptly in perfect condition!
I:8381;85;i even shared it with a friend
I:8381;86;My son is very picky about his movies.
I:8381;87;I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!
I:8381;88;There is so many good comments on this movie yet no one sells it except online.
I:8381;89;If you find it, treasure it.
I:8381;90;Great for children and adults!
I:8381;91;funny thing is I haven't gotten sick of it after all the times it's been on.
I:8381;92;She loved the video as a child and was pleased to see the stuffed toy
I:8381;93;I love Miyuzaki's films, especially the music.
I:8381;94;My daughter was afraid at first of Totoro, but after we watched it a couple of times she really likes it.
I:8381;95;I have the original on tape but its time to update so I can keep watching and share the love with my kids!
I:8381;96;Amazingly directed, written, and produced.
I:8381;97;This may be the most beautiful cartoon movie ever created.
I:8381;98;She absolutely loves this movie and I ordered this one to replace the tape she had already burned out.
I:8381;99;One of the best children's films ever made.
I:8381;100;So gentle and full of wonder.
I:8381;101;Miyazaki is truly a great man.
I:8381;102;It is an absolutely beautiful tale for children of all ages and those of us who still have the ability to lose ourselves in fantasy worlds.
I:8381;103;The more I watched, the more I relaxed.
I:8381;104;It actually makes you shift your everyday gears and enjoy the moment.
I:8381;105;It is as sweet and gentle as it appears to be.
I:8381;106;totoro needs no big epic story, it has characters you will care for, with well developed backgrounds and the best dubbing i've ever heared.
I:8381;107;Totoro tells you funny, charming and a few sad situations in the japanese countryside of the 50's.
I:8381;108;There so many loving details of the life and living in that period.
I:8381;109;So many scenes of the children simply experiencing natur and the wonders of Totoro.
I:8381;110;The music (including the original songs) is a masterpiece.
I:8381;111;Jo Hisaishi composed for most of Miyazaki works and as usual did a magnificent work of art.
I:8381;112;For Hayao Miyazaki himself, its my favorit Film of the best Director in the Animation business.
I:8381;113;This is a major treat for children and grownups of all ages.
I:8381;114;It's a wonderful story of a magical creature and two small girls who have a nice dad and a mom in the hospital.
I:8381;115;This is a great movie.
I:8381;116;My hole family loves this movie.
I:8381;117;It is great start to end.
I:8381;118;Very cute,funny movie was interested but didn't get to see it until now and i love worth the money and a good family movie
I:8381;119;It is the oddest thing how big a fan of Hayao Miyazaki's animated films I have become this year.
I:8381;120;what's even more amazing is it's basically plot.
I:8381;121;creatures) the movie moves quickly along and manages to keep you involved and leave you smiling.
I:8381;122;miyazaki is a true artist in every sense of the word.
I:8381;123;I laughed with delight during some of the scenes.
I:8381;124;I loved watching the day to day activities of the children and their father, interwoven with their encounters with Totoro.
I:8381;125;I would give this movie as a gift to children, and to any adults who love anime or have an interest in Japan.
I:8381;126;The two children are realistically children, though sometimes realistic to the point of annoyance .
I:8381;127;Also I'm sending it back!
I:8381;128;I prefer the original dub and I like the widescreen.
I:8381;129;I wish they could have combined the best of both.
I:8381;130;If I had to choose between the two, I'd probably opt for the original because I really prefer the opening theme singer and the dubs of the two girls.
I:8381;131;I first saw Totoro with the English subtitles in the what I now know is the Fox version about 8 years ago and loved it.
I:8381;132;It's a touching tale of the friendship between two sister and a bunch of wonderful and friendly totoros.
I:8381;133;The soundtrack is fabulous and the animation/artwork is indescribable.
I:8381;134;He is truly a master storyteller and Disney really needs to get it together and release his movies (I believe they bought the right for American distribution) and release his other masterpieces to the public.
I:8381;135;People of all ages will be captivated by this magical tale.
I:8381;136;This movie absolutely should have included both an English and a Japanese track.
I:8381;137;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:8381;138;Just order something else please.
I:8381;139;Ok I LOVE this movie.
I:8381;140;It has been a favorite of mine for close to 20 years.
I:8381;141;Having a mature kid's voice come out of her mouth is like, What the what??
I:8381;142;If you can find the original English over Japanese dub, get it and enjoy this sweet movie.
I:8381;143;From the beautiful artistry to the moving music Totoro is just perfection.
I:8381;144;My Neighbor Totoro is an imaginative cartoon that is aimed at all age ranges.
I:8381;145;The animation and story are both engaging, and the characters are lovable.
I:8381;146;The story centers on two girls whose family has just moved out into the country.
I:8381;147;While they're exploring places around their house, they meet an interesting neighbor.
I:8381;148;I love the intro song on the fox version and have sung it to my children for years.
I:8381;149;It's fantastical and magical with enough realism to make kids understand what's really happening.
I:8381;150;Adults will enjoy watching this one with their children over and over, I know I have.
I:8381;151;This movie is adorable, entertaining, good for any ages!
I:8381;152;The languages that it comes with are French, Japanese, and English.
I:8381;153;You will love this movie!
I:8381;154;what's up with THAT?Aside from that, it's a great movie, great for kids, or kids and adults or even just adults (I must admit I bought this for BOTH of us).
I:8381;155;If you are stressed from work, take a chance to watch it.
I:8381;156;You will feel a lot better.
I:8381;157;This movie is a masterpiece.
I:8381;158;Totoro was always my childhood favorite along with kikis delivery service and it should be apart of everyone's childhood.
I:8381;159;dubbing it with the fannings.
I:8381;160;If you have never seen totoro then this will still be an amazing piece to your collection.
I:8381;161;Sad to see the change.
I:8381;162;I got it two days after I ordered it and nothing was wrong with it!
I:8381;163;The disk was clean :D If you're a fan of Hayao Miyazaki's movies you will surely want this in your collection!
I:8381;164;An adorable, fantastical, wonderful movie .
I:8381;165;a fairy tale happening in real life.
I:8381;166;The film is a bit long, and it confused me terribly when I watched it with my children when they were young, but it's adorable and the kids love it.
I:8381;167;I loved the original English voice cast from the 80's film release, so I did not care for the Fanning sisters.
I:8381;168;Besides that, this is a true jewel of a story from Studio Ghibli.
I:8381;169;Ghibli captures and brings to life the worlds inside our worlds that children and adults will love.
I:8381;170;this is a really great movie and is worth it's price, even if you are not an anime fan.
I:8381;171;This is one of my favorite anime films :)
I:8381;172;So Disney thought it be cute to have Dakota fanning and her sister dub this movie again.
I:8381;173;Subtitles may be a pain to read, but it's worth it to hear the original character actors.
I:8381;174;My Neighbor Tortoro is a wonderful story and production, beyond compare.
I:8381;175;The voices are so much better in this version.
I:8381;176;Its a family favorite and I'm so glad I found it on amazon for cheep.
I:8381;177;touching, beautiful,with clear accurate depictions of Japanese rural life.
I:8381;178;nice story for children and for adults.
I:8381;179;attention to detail, beautiful graphics.
I:8381;180;It is still just as good.
I:8381;181;They love Hayao Miyasaki anime.
I:8381;182;I know they'll enjoy this product.
I:8381;183;I'm happy I found it.
I:8381;184;The movie is wonderful, the animation is lush.
I:8381;185;old girls love this movie!
I:8381;186;Not all of Miyazaki's movies are good for all ages.
I:8381;187;1988 gave us one of the greatest animated films of all time, `The Grave of the Fireflies', a film that still haunts me and continues to develop strongly in my mind.
I:8381;188;"That very same year, another animated film that has garnered incredible praise was released
I:8381;189;To my astonishment, the two films work as beautiful companion pieces and I was taken aback by how honest and pure this film was.
I:8381;190;for me, this film broaches a lot of the same themes that `The Grave of the Fireflies' does, but in a more accessible and hopeful way.
I:8381;191;here we are introduced to young Satsuki and Mei, two sisters who move into the country with their father.
I:8381;192;In the meantime, the girls bond with a neighbor who offers her assistance in their mother's absence and the two girls also catch the eye of a spirit named Totoro.
I:8381;193;director Hayao Miyazaki does a fantastic job of allowing the audience to understand what is going on in the minds of these young protagonists.
I:8381;194;like I said, this is a great companion piece to `The Grave of the Fireflies'.
I:8381;195;It adds an avenue of hope, lacing the final frames, a hope that `The Grave of the Fireflies' doesn't possess.
I:8381;196;It is that hope that possibly (the ruling is still out) makes this the better film.
I:8381;197;I said possibly, and quite frankly they are BOTH masterpieces.
I:8381;198;It's always fun to watch kids who have never seen Miyazaki films watch one for the first time.
I:8381;199;Totoro is a winner, but see the rest of them too.
I:8381;200;I love this as well as do my kids, we watch it over and over again.
I:8381;201;So nice to have shows without all the American attitude and slang we have and still have the magic and mystery of childhood!
I:8381;202;This brings back so many good memories form my childhood.
I:8381;203;my sister and i grew up watching this version (fox) and it brings me right back to my childhood!
I:8381;204;I was impressed with how fast i received my order!!!
I:8381;205;It was fast and in perfect condition!!!!
I:8381;206;"This is one of my favorite ""anime"" movies because it is non."
I:8381;207;violent and has a positive message.
I:8381;208;The characters are adorable without being saccharine, and the film has just the right amount of suspense and action to keep you rooting for them.
I:8381;209;"For those of you lucky enough to live near a children's museum hosting the traveling exhibit ""Jump to Japan,"" you'll enjoy watching the effortless movement of the iconic characters that you saw life."
I:8381;210;"Miyazaki is being treated with much more respect in the Western world thanks to gifts like ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Spirited Away"" ."
I:8381;211;both were released in America with minimal success and a strong fanbase.
I:8381;212;"Like most of Miyazaki's work, this movie is rooted in Shintoism
I:8381;213;the film is great, and highly recommended.
I:8381;214;In Japan, most Ghibli films get proper respect (Princess Mononoke got a 3 disc box set!
I:8381;215;package it, and put well.
I:8381;216;"It's worth it, even without a ""bonus"" disc, which frankly isn't much of a bonus."
I:8381;217;The world of totoro is such a magical place.
I:8381;218;Totoro will lead you on the adventure of a life.
I:8381;219;Just hop on the cat.
I:8381;220;bus, and we're off!I would gladly rate it a hundred stars instead of 5, for it is infact my most favorite movie in the whole entire world.
I:8381;221;in the beautiful world of totoro.you'll always be safe.
I:8381;222;It's the best in the whole entire world!
I:8381;223;Totally adorable story, it is a window for learning of the Japanese culture for the young ones.
I:8381;224;But I have enjoyed every Miyazaki film I have watched so far, so no sense in leaving any out.
I:8381;225;highly Recommended, especially for children.
I:8381;226;I just received this today, much faster than they said it would arrive.
I:8381;227;A great movie for all ages.
I:8381;228;Studio Ghibli is one of the last art studios that actually hand draws all of their cells.
I:8381;229;I really admire the hard work and dedication they put into their movies.
I:8381;230;I would highly recommend this adorable movie to anyone.
I:8381;231;Still, the sweet story and the enchanting creatures hold the interest of my 4.7 year olds time and time again.
I:8381;232;Totoro is a perfect example that children don't need the hero to save the planet and fight and kill dozens of monsters in the process to have a good time.
I:8381;233;When it is on I can hear the laughter from the other end of the house!
I:8381;234;Bought this movie as a gift for my husband and he was thrilled to get it and loved watching it with our son.
I:8381;235;Good story and a fun movie all around.
I:8381;236;Anyone who enjoys anime movies will love this movie.
I:8381;237;Watched it when I was a very young lad and loved it.
I:8381;238;Watched it again finally in high school and finally understood what I loved it.
I:8381;239;Bought this to watch it with a friend and she loves it.
I:8381;240;Great movie for people of all ages.
I:8381;241;Once again, arrived on time and was in great condition.
I:8381;242;This was the best gift I could have given to my little nephew.
I:8381;243;Hayao Miyazaki isn't just a master director of animation.
I:8381;244;He's one of the greatest film makers since the invention of the motion picture.
I:8381;245;that had an english audio track (in addition to japanese with english subtitles), and I got to rediscover this film masterpiece once again.
I:8381;246;"Miyazaki's made three films since I last saw this
I:8381;247;Certainly most of Miyazaki's films (with the exception of Mononoke) are suitable for all ages, they are not targeted for that audience and are in fact more appealing to adults than to children.
I:8381;248;They have just moved into a new home with their father in the rural countryside that is rumored to be haunted.
I:8381;249;Right next to the house they've moved into exists an enormous camphor tree where the sisters eventually discover resides the king of the forest, Totoro.
I:8381;250;The film besides being animated and dealing with spirits of the forest, is incredibly realistic.
I:8381;251;The portrayal of the two sisters is better performed and more realistic than any hollywood film animated or not.You simply must see this film to understand as should other film makers who could learn many things from this master.
I:8381;252;Even if your not into all that japanese animation stuff, totoro is a classic and a must see, especially for children.
I:8381;253;one hopes that soon Disney or Buena Vista will reissue this wonderful classic in widescreen format .
I:8381;254;so viewers can appreciate the full intent and vision of the world's greatest animation writer/director.
I:8381;255;I have loved this movie for years.
I:8381;256;time favorite film, and is perfect for anyone, of any age.
I:8381;257;there are two releases of this film to American audiences.
I:8381;258;off for me, HOWEVER it is a very good dub, especially considering how often Fox butchers anime.
I:8381;259;They didn't mess it up at all, and the voice actors on that version are actually very very good.
I:8381;260;released it with a new dub track and two discs, the original Japanese, etc. etc.
I:8381;261;Once again, good voice actors were chosen, so even the dub track is done well.
I:8381;262;(Dakota Fanning and her younger sister play the two sisters in the film so they have good chemistry together).
I:8381;263;"she loves the early sequence when Mai and Satsuki first explore their new house
I:8381;264;She loves Totoro, she loves the Catbus.
I:8381;265;She'll watch the whole thing too!
I:8381;266;for young children, either version of the US release is good because both have very good dub tracks.
I:8381;267;For any anime enthusiast the new release from Disney is a must.
I:8381;268;It includes a very accurate subtitle translation, original music, lots of special features including the entire movie in storyboards on disc 2, and even the dub track is still done very well.
I:8381;269;One of the best movies ever made.
I:8381;270;It will remind you of what it's like to be a small child, where the wind rustling through the trees and seeds budding are the work of some indescribably fantastic magic.
I:8381;271;Anyone, regardless of age, will instantly fall in love with the characters in this film, especially Totoro and his two smaller friends.
I:8381;272;And it still has a fairly interesting story line.
I:8381;273;Lots of family characters and scenes a child can relate to.
I:8381;274;My kids and I have enjoyed this movie since they were toddlers.
I:8381;275;Our house is filled with excitement and laughter each time we watch it.
I:8381;276;It is a beautiful film from an amazing studio.
I:8381;277;This movie is STILL engaging, sweet, and heartfelt.
I:8381;278;Oh, how the two young girls squealed and went racing right out of the old moving truck to dance and do cartwheels on the open meadowland!
I:8381;279;So beautifully made and so driven with real emotion as well as some gentle little humor and a real eye for fine art.
I:8381;280;A very amusing family film indeed!
I:8381;281;But hey, it's a private little world meant for young children .
I:8381;282;The movie is a classic.
I:8381;283;It's the perfect way to watch this movie in English.
I:8381;284;"Wow, there sure are a lot of people complaining about the new Disney dub on ""My Neighbor Totoro""!"
I:8381;285;At least with the Disney dub, they got two real girls to voice the characters, and I thought Elle Fanning did a great job on Mei.
I:8381;286;"Ok, maybe a bit too ""screechy"", but still fairly believable as a four year old."
I:8381;287;It's still a wonderful film.
I:8381;288;i use to love this movie growing up and my daughter seems to also like it.
I:8381;289;she couldnt stop laughing and her mother also loved the movie.
I:8381;290;this is a great family movie that everyone can enjoy!!!
I:8381;291;Get ready to fall in love with a big furry, well, Totoro.
I:8381;292;wWII and revolves around 2 young girls moving into a mysterious new house on the edge of a forest.
I:8381;293;Together they become friends with the King of the Forest: Totoro.
I:8381;294;The story allows a childs imagination to work into the story, too.
I:8381;295;If you liked ''Ponyo', you will love 'Totoro'!
I:8381;296;These are absolutely enchanting stories.
I:8381;297;I was so happy when this was released on blu.
I:8381;298;Having watched it in both the original Japanese and the dubbed English, it's a wonderful story either way.
I:8381;299;This movie is a favorite of my daughter age 2 (who is normally an Elmo addict), and her cousins 6 and 8.
I:8381;300;It is sweet and simple, creative, enchanting and beautiful.
I:8381;301;The love between the sisters is so moving and sends such a powerful message.
I:8381;302;The visualizations are energetic and fun, and the silly voices of the girls and the funny things they say, make my daughter laugh out loud.
I:8381;303;This is probably one of my favorite if not favorite family films, and I never really liked animae, but this is such a treat!
I:8381;304;But this one was packed in bubble wrap and put in a bubble package, nicely done.
I:8381;305;So it arrived right on time in perfect condition.
I:8381;306;This movie is by far the best animated movie ever, and the most magical as well.
I:8381;307;Of the two, Mei is slightly more curious.
I:8381;308;One day while Satsuki is at home, something magical happens in their forest.
I:8381;309;"Mei finds ""Totoro,"" the ""guardian"" of the forest."
I:8381;310;they certainly have the resources to do so.
I:8381;311;In the process, they proceeded to destroy the aesthetic value of the delightful intent of the original.
I:8381;312;ABC family is the one I needed and I was more than overjoyed to finally find this.
I:8381;313;A great classic film to enjoy with our family.
I:8381;314;This was my favorite movie of all time when i was a little kid.
I:8381;315;This is a must have movie.
I:8381;316;This is the Studio Ghibli at its best.
I:8381;317;If you have kids, they must see this movie, if you are an adult you must see this movie.
I:8381;318;My grand daughter loved it, so that means I loved it too.
I:8381;319;Delivery time was very good.
I:8381;320;My Neighbor Totoro has always been a favorite movie of mine (which is fortunate as my youngest son watched it hundreds of times growing up), ever since I bought the VHS version which was released many years ago.
I:8381;321;The original English dub on the VHS release is far superior.
I:8381;322;You can see the difference if you turn on the English soundtrack along with the English subtitles.
I:8381;323;The subtitles are a much better reflection of the original Japanese language script.
I:8381;324;Have looked forever for this for my grandbaby,love it.
I:8381;325;Shipped fast, good shape, played perfect.
I:8381;326;Needless to say, the movie itself is brilliant, entertaining, and very sweet and sentimental.
I:8381;327;I absolutely love this film.
I:8381;328;I bought the film on a chance, then I sat down to watch it.
I:8381;329;It's such a lovely film, well worth watching with the family or even on your own.
I:8381;330;The scenes are beautiful, the story is lovely and the characters are an absolute delight.
I:8381;331;I love the relationship between the two sisters .
I:8381;332;They bounced off each other, perfectly.
I:8381;333;Satsuki being protective of her little sister Mei, who takes delight in everything around her.
I:8381;334;I loved it when Satsuki met Totoro for the first time, in the rain, while waiting for the bus.
I:8381;335;I would highly recommend this movie .
I:8381;336;Once you see it, I guarantee you'll want to see more!
I:8381;337;"There is a moment in ""My Neighbor Totoro"" that demonstrates what sets it apart from so many so. called family films."
I:8381;338;"But the father in ""My Neighbor Totoro"" believes his children are telling the truth."
I:8381;339;He believes it so much that he thanks the spirits for watching after Mei.
I:8381;340;The father can be a little absent minded, but he has such a good heart and is a kind person who loves his two daughters.
I:8381;341;"When was the last time a family entertainment was about two sisters instead of two brothers, or a brother and sister?That is one of the magics of ""My Neighbor Totoro""."
I:8381;342;when I wasn't laughing at some of this film, I had a very big grin on my face.
I:8381;343;I was caught up in this family, as well as the neighbors.
I:8381;344;The totoro's completely won me over.
I:8381;345;The father and his two girls enjoy a bath together.
I:8381;346;I had a response to them: In Japan it is traditional for families to enjoy evening baths together, although they take a quick shower before entering the bathtub together.
I:8381;347;It is considered impolite otherwise.
I:8381;348;The scene is interesting and something that would be very unlikely to be shown in any American film, let alone a family entertainment.
I:8381;349;"i would like to finish by indicating that the legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurowsawa called ""My Neighbor Totoro"" one of the best films he had ever scene."
I:8381;350;But for an animated film, it's truly an astonishing achievement.
I:8381;351;It is one of the best family films ever made.
I:8381;352;It is available at Amazon.
I:8381;353;This new dub features Dakota Fanning and her real.
I:8381;354;It is still an absolute delight all the way through.
I:8381;355;Our whole family loves this movie!
I:8381;356;The characters faces are so animated and they make my kids (ages 4 1/2 and 7) laugh!
I:8381;357;I think they do a great job with the voices also!
I:8381;358;The family cares so much about each other and is a great model for kids.
I:8381;359;I'd definitely recommend this movie!
I:8381;360;that alone is worth five stars.
I:8381;361;This is great animation with an excellent story for kids, immature adults, or anyone who is in a really bad mood.
I:8381;362;this movie is one of the best ghibli creations.
I:8381;363;and contrary to others opinions i really think it can be loved by both children and adults, as with most great films.
I:8381;364;aside from the artwork which is beautiful, it is about childhood, family, and a respect for your surrondings.
I:8381;365;i think myazaki did a wonderful job of portraying this story and reminding us of what its like to be a kid.
I:8381;366;I had originally watched this movie with my girlfriend about a year ago before this new edition came out and i loved it.
I:8381;367;She's always loved it, so i got it for her for christmas.
I:8381;368;He absolutely loves this movie (watches it almost every day)!
I:8381;369;The movie is super cute!
I:8381;370;I'm happy I bought this movie.
I:8381;371;Some older kids might enjoy
I:8381;372;It became one of our all time favorite movies.
I:8381;373;This is my son's favorite movie.
I:8381;374;I love the gentle spirit of this film, the introduction to another culture, and the relationship between the sisters.
I:8381;375;The music is gorgeous (get the soundtrack!)
I:8381;376;and the art is breathtaking.
I:8381;377;My Neighbor Totoro is certainly one of Hayao Miyazaki's most magical, and it is nice to see the Special Edition version released.
I:8381;378;These releases are a scar on the legacy of John Lasseter's creative Disney leadership to supposedly champion more 2D animation, and especially because of his affection for Hayao Miyazaki's work.
I:8381;379;My Neighbor Totoro is quite simply one of my favorite films of all time.
I:8381;380;It's beautifully animated, and has a storyline that reaches out to the heart.
I:8381;381;it's truly captivating to watch!
I:8381;382;I once took it with me to a family gathering on Thanksgiving, and at the children's insistence we ended up watching it six times in a row.
I:8381;383;"that title has to go to ""Spirited Away"", but it's still one of my all time favorite films."
I:8381;384;Gave it as a gift to my cousin's children.
I:8381;385;Watching this movie together was sheer delight!
I:8381;386;it brought back memories, and I had to see it again.
I:8381;387;Thank you Amazon, it came in plenty of time, and I'm so excited to share it with the girls!!
I:8381;388;"This will make a wonderful gift for children, or for those family fun ""Big Kids""!"
I:8381;389;It's creativly cute, and enjoyable to watch.
I:8381;390;One of Hayao Miyazaki's most creative child films, along with Ponyo and Kiki's Delivery Service!!
I:8381;391;My Neighbor Totoro is a grat movie and I love it.
I:8381;392;Disney did a great job and this is a great version.
I:8381;393;Other wise very well done.
I:8381;394;I have loved this movie for quite a long time.
I:8381;395;I wish it had been done more respectfully for the wonderful artwork that it was intended to be.
I:8381;396;You will be very pleasantly surprised.
I:8381;397;I've actually seen this version of Totoro before the Disney version and it's good but I think the newer one is better.
I:8381;398;But it's still the same movie and you can like any version that works for you.
I:8381;399;I love this film, and the english dub is actually quite good.
I:8381;400;If you have not seen the film, watch it!
I:8381;401;The Japanese origin of this film gives it a refreshing look compared to American animation.
I:8381;402;The story is delightful, and for a change a girl has the lead role.
I:8381;403;Kids will love the landscapes and the characters.
I:8381;404;This is the English version with the voices of American actors.
I:8381;405;So, watching this movie I had very high expectations since I watched the Fox version first.
I:8381;406;Bought this for my daughter who loved the story.
I:8381;407;She made me watch it with her and I have to admit, I liked it too.
I:8381;408;One of the best films for children, ever.
I:8381;409;give to new families and neighborhood kids.
I:8381;410;It's a colorful array of delightful whimsy, love for nature and for family.
I:8381;411;it's fun, it's beautiful animation, and it's all heart.
I:8381;412;This film embodies human love, wonder and joy!
I:8381;413;This movie is a delight.
I:8381;414;Everyone we know who has watched it has loved it.
I:8381;415;This was another Christmas present for my son Ian, but we have all enjoyed watching it.
I:8381;416;I love the creativity of the animated characters and vision that is shown by this creative film artist.
I:8381;417;It is suitable for all ages and although it is about children it is a great fun and very enjoyable movie for all ages.
I:8381;418;This one I will watch many times.
I:8381;419;I absolutely love this movie!
I:8381;420;I love Howl's Moving Castle, Ponyo and Spirited Away.
I:8381;421;many seem to love it.
I:8381;422;If you are looking for a more mature anime I would refer to the 3 I listed above.
I:8381;423;I love this movie and I am so happy that I can still get the original English Dubbed copy before Disney re.
I:8381;424;Another classic, great for the family movie by Mark Henley.
I:8381;425;While not as good, or complex as Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind or Princess Mononoke, this gentle fairy tale is still a beautiful.
I:8381;426;It is actually two story's in one.
I:8381;427;The first is the fairy tale.
I:8381;428;the two sisters are very real, Sasuke is the more responsible elder sister and May is the younger 5 year old who seems wiser beyond her years.
I:8381;429;The dubbing is done with professional care and one of the best out there.
I:8381;430;I loved the ending and don't turn the tape off while the credits roll.
I:8381;431;The still pictures tell their own little story and are worth watching.
I:8381;432;This is still my favourite animated film of all time.
I:8381;433;We discovered it before Disney had ever heard of this gem so we got this beautifully done rendition.
I:8381;434;The emotion expressed by the actors display the compassion and sensitivity we hope kids will learn and is one of the reasons this movie is so fantastic.
I:8381;435;Yes, this 2002 rendition by Fox is the one to get!
I:8381;436;This was my all time favorite movie when I was a child.
I:8381;437;But I'll give it a 3 because I absolutely love the story and I always will.
I:8381;438;This is an excellent movie for all ages!
I:8381;439;Wonderful story, acting, and attitude sets this movie from all others.
I:8381;440;one of the greatest movie, should have it, it's beautiful, it's cute, and it's a great family movie.
I:8381;441;again the Disney mafia destroyed the magic of this beautiful film.
I:8381;442;My advice is to watch this movie on Japanese language and English subtitles.
I:8381;443;For the time especially, the dubbed cast is amazing.
I:8381;444;It's a movie about values and responsibility, but with giant cat.
I:8381;445;it's the element of realism that makes this movie outstanding.
I:8381;446;The fact that we never really know what could happen is what makes this movie great.
I:8381;447;There's so many surprises around every corner that we're even ready for the shock of Mai dying when it becomes a possibility.
I:8381;448;This is the movie that made me fall in love with Japanese Animation and with Myazaki's work in particular.
I:8381;449;It made me feel good inside.
I:8381;450;My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful story about what happens 2 young girls and their father move into a country house to be closer to their mother, who is in a nearby hospital.
I:8381;451;The animation is stunningly done, with both people and fantasic creatures coming alive to make the story hum.
I:8381;452;This is one of the best dubs I have heard, with the English voice actors obviously 'getting' their characters and the writers did a good job of not changing the lines except where required.
I:8381;453;my wife and I both enjoyed this a great deal and was well recieved when given to a family with two daughters, age 6 and 2.
I:8381;454;This is a gift for my daughter, but we already saw the movie.
I:8381;455;We love it so much that I wanted to give her a copy!Enjoy!
I:8381;456;"We love this film
I:8381;457;We think it is Miyazaki's best.
I:8381;458;"No violence, scary segments, or big machines (as found in Howl's Moving Castle, for example)
I:8381;459;A note to anyone who might think the same about My Neighbor Totoro.
I:8381;460;get over it and see the movie.
I:8381;461;what an absolutely enchanting film.
I:8381;462;The artistry is breathtaking and the story is so touching.
I:8381;463;They are very sweet, charming creatures.
I:8381;464;He sort of adopts the girls, which is just another touching aspect of the story, especially when he enchants them by helping their little garden grow into an enormous, beautiful tree.
I:8381;465;all in all, Totoro is a wonderful movie that is definitely worth seeing.
I:8381;466;I have seen this movie many times and I adore it.
I:8381;467;My five year old adores it.
I:8381;468;two little girls form a relationship with a tree spirit in the pre.
I:8381;469;It's funny, moving, and meditatively paced.
I:8381;470;I grew up watching this movie and always remember the imagination put into it.
I:8381;471;I think it's really cute despite that it doesn't have much of a story that goes from point A to point B. However, it is a good watch and I would recommend it for children.
I:8381;472;The movie itself is and always will be a five star film for me.
I:8381;473;totoro was my favorite movie growing up.
I:8381;474;My boyfriend got this for me as a gift and did not know about the change, so it was just really disapointing.
I:8381;475;This is a charming tale with a couple of girls and a father dealing with a sick mother/wife.
I:8381;476;It has beautiful animation and an interesting storyline.
I:8381;477;I enjoyed it overall and think the average kid will enjoy watching it as well.
I:8381;478;This movie was a pleasure to watch with my daughter.
I:8381;479;It was fun to see the look my kid's face as she watch the movie with great intent.
I:8381;480;the story has a slow pace but it has endearing qualites of family life and a child like vision of their world.
I:8381;481;i liked the cat bus.
I:8381;482;Watch it, you'll love it.
I:8381;483;Hayao Miyazaki is a master in the field of anime.
I:8381;484;My Neighbor Totoro was his pet project for quite a while, and it is quite possibly still his best work.
I:8381;485;"i'm not a fan of calling a film ""magical,"" but it fits here."
I:8381;486;Everything about this movie makes you feel like a kid again.
I:8381;487;The animation is gorgeous, and imagination oozes from every frame.
I:8381;488;There isn't a whole lot of conflict here, but that's perfectly okay.
I:8381;489;This film is just fun and fantastic from beginning to end.
I:8381;490;It's like Miyazaki opened up his imagination and invited us all inside.
I:8381;491;watching My Neighbor Totoro, you are in for something weird and wonderful.
I:8381;492;This film is a treat that is guaranteed to leave you with a smile on your face.
I:8381;493;this movie is something special that everybody should see.
I:8381;494;I got hooked on Miyazaki films while living in Japan and have even visited the Tottoro bus stop in Oita, my husband's home town.
I:8381;495;i think this movie captures a lot about growing up, learning responsibility, being part of a family and appreciating the natural world around us, no matter what culture you come from.
I:8381;496;I was so excited to share this with my 10.
I:8381;497;year old niece who absolutely loved it!I definitely would recommend this movie to anyone.
I:8381;498;Disney always takes a good thing and poops all over it.
I:8381;499;The writing is better than the Disney reproduction and the voice acting is so much better as well.
I:8381;500;The small changes to the wording threw us at first, but it's still a wonderful movie with great animation.
I:8381;501;Miyazaki is simply brilliant and it shows in his works.
I:8381;502;This movie exudes charm and can be enjoyed but anyone.
I:8381;503;Studio Ghibli's movies are only beginning to gain a presence in the North American market, in spite of the fact that they have been released years ago.
I:8381;504;"He calls Miyazaki's works as being ""the most inspirational films""."
I:8381;505;While the mother is in the hospital, the two girls begin to explore the surroundings of their new dwelling.
I:8381;506;It takes a simple plot and still manages to capture your interest.
I:8381;507;intertwined with a great soundtrack, this movie is for anyone.
I:8381;508;I would greatly encourage anyone to delve into the Studio Ghibli world of animation.
I:8381;509;com and sure enough I had success.
I:8381;510;I just love this movie, and I think that Disney did a great job dubbing it in English.
I:8381;511;For those who are debating between this version and the older Fox dub, I think that this one is just fine.
I:8381;512;I really like the fact that the two young sisters were voiced by.
I:8381;513;A very cute film indeed.
I:8381;514;Yes it is still the same basic story line, and yes it is still the same basic animation.
I:8381;515;Dakota Fanning and her little sister need to stay away from anime and the classic works of a great artist and writer.
I:8381;516;My six month old nephew can draw better than that and come up with a more compelling story line.
I:8381;517;Totoro is a wonderful story about a family separated by their mothers sickness and the wonder of childhood, it is a beautiful, timeless story.
I:8381;518;I grew up with the works of Miyazaki, I came to love anime because of Totoro, Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service and Miyazakis other works.
I:8381;519;Totoro is a treasured part of our Miyazaki collection.
I:8381;520;In every respect, the dub on the Fox VHS version of several years ago is preferable.
I:8381;521;fantastic movie for kids and adults.
I:8381;522;Fun and a little scary.
I:8381;523;The perfect fantasy, done perfectly.
I:8381;524;The warm characters and calm nature in this movie made it a one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
I:8381;525;The Mother and Father were also friendly people who conducted themselves intelligently and amicably.
I:8381;526;I have a pretty good collection of Miyazaki's movies and this is one of my favorites!
I:8381;527;I am studying Japanese for work so we got this movie and several of the other Ghibli movies as well.
I:8381;528;Totoro is one of my favorites.
I:8381;529;Compared to a normal movie there actually isn't all that much going on in terms of storyline but it is so pleasant that I don't mind at all.
I:8381;530;I can see my own 2 girls in them.
I:8381;531;Another high point for me is that the music fits the movie perfectly.
I:8381;532;but fun, our kids aren't interested in it at all), Howl's moving Castle (kids neutral on it), Cat's Return (kids like it), Kiki (kids LOVE it, maybe even more than Totoro), and Spirited Away (kids neutral on it).
I:8381;533;Laputa and Nausica were decent.
I:8381;534;In particular the little girl, Mei.
I:8381;535;My Neighbor Totoro is by far the most outstanding animated film ever created and the best children's movie available.
I:8381;536;Miyazaki's animation skill and his attention to detail is amazing.
I:8381;537;The behaviors of the children are so classic of Japanese children .
I:8381;538;I love to watch this movie and be transported back to rural Japan and re.
I:8381;539;live the the visits I have had with my Japanese friends and families.
I:8381;540;This movie expresses the innocence and imagination of all children in a veritable and gentle manner.
I:8381;541;It has universal appeal and is enjoyed by my adult friends as well as my children.
I:8381;542;Miyazaki's ability to tell his story through visual means transcends most movies dependence on language, pyrotechnics and computer enhancements.
I:8381;543;I think the movie is best viewed using the Japanese language selection .
I:8381;544;the viewer is transported through images and language inflections and tones to a world of innocence, magic and reverance of nature.
I:8381;545;I give this movie 2 thumbs and 8 fingers up!
I:8381;546;I think she liked it.
I:8381;547;The movie came in a timely manner.
I:8381;548;I'm not sure how the Studio Ghibli will release its movies outside of Japan, but if they are anything like the Japanese release, one is in for a treat.
I:8381;549;The first disk contains the movie, with Japanese in 2 channel stereo (the sound is excellent) and English in Mono.
I:8381;550;There are also subtitles in Japanese and English available.
I:8381;551;The picture is also excellent, and in 16:9 letterbox format.
I:8381;552;The plot and graphics are perfect, and the characters are lovable.
I:8381;553;Miyazaki is on of the most creative story tellers of modern time.
I:8381;554;It was so well received and loved in in Japan that it spurred a movement to protect Japans forests.
I:8381;555;By and by the little five year old meets Totoro while exploring her new surroundings.
I:8381;556;Both of the children make friends with him and he ends up coming to their rescue when they are in need.
I:8381;557;The story is heart warming and will leave you feeling happy after you watch it.
I:8381;558;The music through out the movie is also wonderful even to listen to by itself.
I:8381;559;It is also a good movie if you want to learn a bit about Japanese culture.
I:8381;560;Now there is one thing and this is very important.
I:8381;561;"Recently my sister had a kid's show on TV that she loves yet I felt kind of ""meh"" about it."
I:8381;562;Well Miyazaki films are perfect since they're colorful and imaginative for the kids but they're quite entertaining for the adults too.
I:8381;563;satsuki and Mei are 2 girls who have just moved into a new house with their dad.
I:8381;564;Soon Satsuki also finds it and the 2 have fun with it.
I:8381;565;Only thing is is that their mom is in the hospital and Mei does something drastic to go see her.
I:8381;566;watching Totoro, you get the sense of you're watching something that fits perfectly with whatever situation you're in.
I:8381;567;it's certainly an imaginative film but it doesn't have that out.
I:8381;568;But the imagination in a way seems a bit more tamer.
I:8381;569;If they prefer big rousing songs and endless comic relief.
I:8381;570;I found both the animation and the voice acting to be superb.
I:8381;571;I and my girlfriend recommend it highly!
I:8381;572;A few others to see would be Ponyo, Hal's moving castle, and Kiki's delivery service.
I:8381;573;This is a wonderful film.
I:8381;574;Fine music, great animation and a truly wholesome, funny, sweet, fascinating and imaginative story about a family living in the country.
I:8381;575;Magic and special things are going on, nature weaves a sweet spell on the kids and interesting things occur.
I:8381;576;Just right for viewing by little ones and an adult along with them.
I:8381;577;with all the violence and cruelty in this world and in film, this is a refreshing change of pace for your family and especially for your little ones.
I:8381;578;everything about this film is great for children.
I:8381;579;i have a young son, and this is one of the only movies i feel comfortable with him watching.
I:8381;580;a lovely story that connects us with the importance of nature.
I:8381;581;This movie takes you back to a time when life was simple, when childhood was full of play, when trees were tall, and fairies lived in your backyard.
I:8381;582;It is full of whimsy, and the setting is so peaceful and serene.
I:8381;583;it is amazing how you can see the wind blowing without seeing the wind, and the water so clear you want to reach in and touch it.
I:8381;584;My Neighbor Totoro is a simply wonderful story.
I:8381;585;It portrays innocence and family love at its best and is very delightful to watch.
I:8381;586;This movie is one that i love, it is beautiful, the story is very sweet.
I:8381;587;Its a great way to introduce children to more serious topics, like illness, moving away, building stronger relationship.
I:8381;588;this is a wonderful movie.
I:8381;589;my son and i love it .
I:8381;590;perfect for all ages !
I:8381;591;I'll star with the film.
I:8381;592;This is a film with something for everyone.
I:8381;593;The entire family can watch it together and enjoy it.
I:8381;594;That being said, This is still a great film for people of all ages.
I:8381;595;My two year old daughter LOVES this movie.
I:8381;596;He is a forest spirit that helps the little girls on their journeys.
I:8381;597;She asks for this movie over and over and I don't mind watching it with her.
I:8381;598;I've had Totoro since it came out and I was Mei's age, and still to this day it is my favorite movie!
I:8381;599;I remember watching this many times when I was a kid.
I:8381;600;Just by watching the movie alone and not understanding any of it I feel in love with the story.
I:8381;601;A few years later I went to Japan and learned Japanese and bought he movie.
I:8381;602;I love the movie even more.
I:8381;603;This is one of the greatest animei I have seen.
I:8381;604;Good for all ages and a cute story.
I:8381;605;This vieo is one of favorite video for Japanese children.
I:8381;606;Whenever I watch it, my heart feel warm feeling.
I:8381;607;This video includes adventure, dream, family love, nighbour love, which we forget in busy life.
I:8381;608;Hayao Miyazaki made almost 10 movies, but Totoro is one of best one.
I:8381;609;What is other best one?
I:8381;610;Wonderful and imaginative movie for all ages.
I:8381;611;the story reawoke emotions from my youth and left me feeling giddy and happy.
I:8381;612;a real treat for both adults and children.
I:8381;613;a great film, wonderful story.
I:8381;614;our 5 year old loves it.
I:8381;615;highly recommended to all over age 4.
I:8381;616;during the summer, Satsuki and Mei, move with their father to a house in the countryside while their mother convalesces in a hospital.
I:8381;617;They have some nice neighbours, particularly the old lady who tends her fields and comes up with bountiful harvests.
I:8381;618;totoros are funny looking creatures living in a secret world inside a giant camphor tree.
I:8381;619;Others are more developed, gray and white that resemble rabbits.
I:8381;620;The girls befriend the Totoros and spend some purely magical moments together.
I:8381;621;this charming film depicts Japanese society that is a stark contrast to American society.
I:8381;622;the girls themselves are exceptionally unique.
I:8381;623;Mei in particular is more courageous and headstrong.
I:8381;624;one interesting concept is that of laughter chasing away soot sprites, or dust bunnies, who inhabit dark, lonely houses.
I:8381;625;Definitely a symbol of happy houses having no dark corners.
I:8381;626;my Neighbour Totoro is the film that first got Hayao Miyazaki notice in America, especially when it was released in the U. s. five years after its release in Japan.
I:8381;627;The animation is typical anime, but the warm characterizations of the people are what make this a cut above the rest.
I:8381;628;And if you thought the Totoros were creative, check out the cat bus.
I:8381;629;This is a great movie that I grew up watching.
I:8381;630;its childish but a classic I watched this movie when I was eight and I watched it again half a decade later and I still love.
I:8381;631;you can relate to the characters and their childhood imagination.
I:8381;632;This is my least like movie my Studio Gibli and it is still great so but them all, they will be great for you your children and your children s children.
I:8381;633;It made it all the more real.
I:8381;634;Miyazaki is a genius and I love his movies.
I:8381;635;I'd seen it years ago and didn't much for it care myself, but for a three year old it is the greatest film ever made!!!
I:8381;636;Watching her laugh and enjoy the characters has made this one of my favorite films to watch as well.
I:8381;637;This is a great movie for all ages, but especially good for kids under five.
I:8381;638;I bought this copy for my dare care it is perfect Miyazaki starter.
I:8381;639;My Neighbor Totoro, for my vote, is one of the best animated films of all time.
I:8381;640;This is just sweet, ingenious and creative.
I:8381;641;Hayao Miyazaki has made so many wonderful films that it's difficult to pick one out as his best.
I:8381;642;This is the perfect family film.
I:8381;643;There are no villains , no fights, no scary monsters, yet there is great drama in the sense of discovery that the sisters experience as they learn more about this secret world that exists just next door.
I:8381;644;Miyazaki's portrait of a world full of benevolent mystery is very moving.
I:8381;645;Just love this movie, it really takes me back to the feeling of childhood.
I:8381;646;I have two sisters and I love the relationship between these two.
I:8381;647;The 2006 release with Dakota Fanning seemed perfectly natural to me.
I:8381;648;rEVIEW:This is a wonderful, magical movie.
I:8381;649;My Neighbor Totoro (MNT) shows life in Japan in the 1950's from the perspective of 2 likable sisters, ages 10 and 4.
I:8381;650;The portrayal of this family is believable, and multi.
I:8381;651;What amazed me the most about this movie is it's portrayal of magic: How 'un.
I:8381;652;in addidtion, the timing of the magic is: Few and Far Between.
I:8381;653;i give this film my highest recommendation.
I:8381;654;nOTE:This movie is rated G, but American audiences will be surprised to see the family bathing (yes, nude) together.
I:8381;655;I have it on VHS and it is one of the most enjoyable, beautifully painted and almost meditative films I have ever seen.
I:8381;656;When a film comes from Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki, it has nearly a 98% chance of being spectacular and wholly unique.
I:8381;657;Each of his films has a warmth, passion and innocence that seems to be completely lost in films found in the US mainstream cinema.
I:8381;658;I was raised on Disney, and I love Disney.
I:8381;659;These are the films that I began to show my two year old.
I:8381;660;Graciously into our life came the answer to bad guy role models, this wonderful little film called My Neighbor Totoro.
I:8381;661;I will defer to other reviews that write profoundly about the history of the film, the lovely plot and such.
I:8381;662;This is a film about nature, and the joys of being children(for instance the children are always honored for their ideas and their vision), the joys of discovery and moving.
I:8381;663;The conflicts come from real issues but are always sensitively done.
I:8381;664;And it is fun, with a great sense of fantasy.
I:8381;665;Totoro is a film that has achieved cult status for all the right reasons, a stunningly sensitive and fun story that you can watch with your kids without fear of them negatively acting out.
I:8381;666;See the film and you'll figure it out.
I:8381;667;I've got a dozen or so movie and educational videos for children in my collection.
I:8381;668;the animation is simply beautiful.
I:8381;669;I don't mind watching this video with the kids because of the gorgeous scenery.
I:8381;670;You can tell that the work behind the movie was a labor of love and skill .
I:8381;671;A favorite video of both adults and children I know.
I:8381;672;There is little action, but the story is charming and the animation extremely beautiful.
I:8381;673;Miyazaki's lyric film is a beautiful evocation of time gone by.
I:8381;674;Not so much in its depiction of a shimmering and placid Japanese countryside but in that it is a film that takes its time with its setting and its characters.
I:8381;675;Before you have finished you will feel that you know this place and the family that is at the center of this story.
I:8381;676;The film's feeling for nature and of the nature of human relationships is so sure that you will truly feel that you are a part of this scene whether or not you are Japanese.
I:8381;677;The slow unwinding of the story of their joys and sorrows is a beautiful evocation of the Japanese film makers who went before Miyazaki.
I:8381;678;The film is constantly, gently reminding of us of that transcendent world that exists just over the crest of our everday lives.
I:8381;679;"that ""Totoro"" does all of this and has a good time in the process makes a real joy to watch."
I:8381;680;What an amazing heart felt story.
I:8381;681;, and thus I recommend the 20th Century Fox english dub over the Disney one.
I:8381;682;Very cute and sweet, and the best part is there is no violence.
I:8381;683;My 2 boys, ages 4 and 9 absolutly loved it.
I:8381;684;It is cute and funny for the little ones and there is an underlying story line appropriate for the older ones.
I:8381;685;This is a classic movie that should be in every young child's collection.
I:8381;686;It's whimsical, weird and wonderful .
I:8381;687;One of my 6 y/o daughter's perennial favorites.
I:8381;688;"Japanese animated feature about two young girls who meet a supernatural creature, or spirit, named ""Totoro."""
I:8381;689;Director Miyazaki's talents shine in this movie with beautiful animation and simple pleasures.
I:8381;690;The family is happy for the most part, but their mother is confined to a hospital for an illness not identified in the story.
I:8381;691;"Mei, the youngest of the two girls, meets him first and she's the one who names him ""Totoro."""
I:8381;692;stop during an evening rainstorm, which is probably the most enjoyable scene in the movie.
I:8381;693;The story is simple and it's enchanting.
I:8381;694;Don't know what took me so long, but this is my first Studio Ghibli film and it is so sweet, fanciful and GORGEOUS I'm hooked for life.
I:8381;695;I want to see more.
I:8381;696;Very funny in spots, but it had me sobbing in others.
I:8381;697;It's definitely a keeper and will leave you wanting more.
I:8381;698;the extras included on the disk are very fun to watch, especially the tour of Totoro's forests just outside of Tokyo.
I:8381;699;This is such a sweet and thought provoking children's Japanese classic.
I:8381;700;It's done well, without the normal syrupy sweet Disney touch.
I:8381;701;It's fun, transcultural, and well done.
I:8381;702;Every good thing you've read in these reviews is correct.
I:8381;703;This is an absolute feast for the eyes and imagination.
I:8381;704;All the other available works by Miyazaki are done beautifully in the United States.
I:8381;705;so it really is for kids of all ages) and it has something new for me every time I see it.
I:8381;706;Plus, I've seen it both wide.
I:8381;707;screen AND pan scan (full screen) and I can tell you that the difference is worth seeking out (it's available wide from Japan and China if you own an all.
I:8381;708;I had the strangest feeling watching this movie.
I:8381;709;Such a refreshing change, just beautiful story telling and animation.
I:8381;710;This movie is one of my all time favorites and i will watch it many times through the years and look forward to sharing this with my own kids and younger relatives.
I:8381;711;Although this is anime, and I am not a real fan of anime, this particular story is wonderful for children.
I:8381;712;My kids watched it over and over again when they were young, and they still love it (ages 21 and 25).
I:8381;713;Just lots of fun for children from 2 to 60.
I:8381;714;The characters are so charming.
I:8381;715;The animation is very pleasing to the very young.
I:8381;716;Beautiful to watch, it will tickle your funny bone and your heart.
I:8381;717;Great for the whole family to enjoy together!
I:8381;718;This movie is a staple to my childhood and I'm so glad to have it back in my life.
I:8381;719;It arrived on Valentines Day which was absolutely perfect.
I:8381;720;This movie is wonderful, and it arrived quickly and unscathed!
I:8381;721;I was very pleased with the service and product I received.
I:8381;722;I saw this movie when I was a child and I loved it.
I:8381;723;When I found this I just had to order it for my son.
I:8381;724;It's a wonderful children's film, and a must.
I:8381;725;Hayao Miyazaki, the most prominent Japanese filmmaker who has created animated films that not only broke Japanese box office records but has created animated films that reflect upon nature, technology, family and more.
I:8381;726;Compared to the accomplishments of Walt Disney, Miyazaki is a filmmaker who has amassed a respect from his fans worldwide and his animations studio, Studio Ghibli, continues to be one of the most appreciated and respected animation and production studios in the world.
I:8381;727;"vIDEO and AUDIO:""My Neighbor Totoro"" is just an amazing animated film which I first watched back in 1993 (in Japanese, no subtitles) and at the time, although I didn't know what was going on, I was simply in awe with the animation."
I:8381;728;Of how beautiful the artistic backgrounds were.
I:8381;729;old and watching it again, the film still holds up remarkably well today.
I:8381;730;as for the audio, audio is clear and understandable.
I:8381;731;The film is presented in English Dolby Digital Sound and also includes the Japanese and French language tracks.
I:8381;732;"Nevertheless, for those new to ""My Neighbor Totoro"", I'm sure they will enjoy the voice acting by the Fanning sisters."
I:8381;733;(2:00) Producer Toshio Suzuki talks about how the film didn't do well in the box office but when it aired on television, it did remarkably well.
I:8381;734;(5:41) Featuring the English dub voice talents talking about their role, their appreciation for Miyazaki and his films.
I:8381;735;scenes of the talent recording their voices.
I:8381;736;"(3:56) Hayao Miyazaki talks about the creation of ""Ponyo"" and wanting to create a film for young children."
I:8381;737;"(2:27) Hayao Miyazaki discussing the creation of ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and what inspired Miyazaki for the creation of the city in the film."
I:8381;738;"(2:37) Miyazaki talks about the characters of ""Castle in the Sky"" and discussing how his audiences are loyal to his films over time."
I:8381;739;"jUDGMENT CALL:I absolutely love ""My Neighbor Totoro""."
I:8381;740;He makes the kind of films that he wants and for the most part, every film that I have seen from Studio Ghibli, I've been more than satisfied.
I:8381;741;"i remember watching ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and enjoying the lively moments from the beginning but having seen his animated films ""Nausicaa"", ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"" and even ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", as his films are happy and humorous, by the final half of the film, the story definitely shifts to a serious tone and in this film, it does get a bit serious when both Satsuki and Mei facing the probability of their mother dying in the hospital."
I:8381;742;These are genuine emotions that these two young girls feel but at the same time, what transpires afterward was captivating and how the film ends, Miyazaki definitely knows how to wrap up a film and make you feel content and satisfied with overall story.
I:8381;743;My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful family film and by no means is it scary.
I:8381;744;"Miyazaki has mentioned in interviews that he created ""My Neighbor Totoro"" for the children while his latest film ""Ponyo"" was more of him wanting to create a film for even younger children."
I:8381;745;"But for the most part, if you want to introduce a Miyazaki film to your children, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is a great place to start."
I:8381;746;A great film with a lot of new bonus content.
I:8381;747;This is a great movie the.
I:8381;748;The story is great the visuals.
I:8381;749;This movie is full of fun.
I:8381;750;It's colorful with interesting creatures and a nice family friendly plot.
I:8381;751;The emotion and funny sounds put into that version really MADE the movie.
I:8381;752;It just wasn't as funny or entertaining.
I:8381;753;If you've never seen this movie, the Disney version is good, but trust me, the Fox is better!
I:8381;754;I'll enjoy this for a long time.
I:8381;755;On the one hand, it's great to finally have a version with the original Japanese soundtrack, and in widescreen (I think that is the main thing that cinephiles/serious anime collectors have been salivating for).
I:8381;756;as you can glean from all the glowing reviews on this site, it's a winner.
I:8381;757;"Most of the patented Miyazaki themes are present (young female protagonist, respecting nature, white magic, the ability to fly), but it plays now like a ""Cliff's Notes"" blueprint for the more mature and complex work that was to follow."
I:8381;758;My whole family loves this movie, and were able to see it on Turner classic movies, with the Disney dubbed version.
I:8381;759;"the ""original"" dub is much funnier, more clever, better word play."
I:8381;760;"Disney ""Have a nice day!"
I:8381;761;family members who clearly really love each other, including sisters who occasionally bicker but without malice or bitterness.
I:8381;762;"older children will ""get it"", younger children won't even notice this scary plot point and can enjoy the rest of the movie."
I:8381;763;scenes that are thrilling (a ride through the sky!)
I:8381;764;absolutely NO sexualization of children (unlike Disney films and all their small waisted big boobed heroines).
I:8381;765;Bar none, this is the best movie for kids.
I:8381;766;Humor, adventure, suspense and lovable creatures to boot.
I:8381;767;My complaint is that I returned this in tact and perfect to receive a little over $7.
I:8381;768;but I agree that the animation is really lovely.
I:8381;769;entendres, no sex/violence, and yet most (mature) adults will find it most enjoyable.
I:8381;770;Miyazaki's animation style is always a welcome touch.
I:8381;771;"There are Japanese cultural references so the uninitiated might be confused at times, however, the story transcends most boundaries and is simply a good ""friendly spirit"" movie."
I:8381;772;kids will enjoy Totoro and his friends as well as the fact that the children are the focus and stars of the movie.
I:8381;773;"this is one of those movies from which you will get the ""warm fuzzies."""
I:8381;774;Share it with others in your family!
I:8381;775;And it stayed that way throughout the film.
I:8381;776;So go in with an open mind, I personally think Disney did a great job on this one.
I:8381;777;I'v watched this so much and I think it's wonderful.
I:8381;778;It's a movie for the whole family.
I:8381;779;the story is human and heartwarming: Writer retires to the country with two little daughters, with his wife in the hospital.
I:8381;780;totoros are hilarious, and when the gigantic patriarch spirit appears, in a half.
I:8381;781;Still much better than the formulaic Disney musicals that reign over American animation.
I:8381;782;Wonderful score, as well, by one of film music's unheralded masters, Joe Hisaishi.
I:8381;783;I highly recommend that music and film lovers alike explore his other work for Miyazaki .
I:8381;784;most notably Laputa: Castle in the Sky and Nausica: Warriors of the Wind.
I:8381;785;This movie can make me feel better no matter what the status of my life.
I:8381;786;In fact, most times it not only makes me feel better, it usually brings tears of joy to my eyes.
I:8381;787;It's a remarkable film and my favorite of Miyazaki's works and that is saying more than anything else I might.
I:8381;788;Totoro is an endearing creature, resembling a largish bear.
I:8381;789;bunny hybrid, and he befriends the girls and helps them with various things.
I:8381;790;disney really takes the films for granted (almost refusing to release the amazing Spirited Away for a time), but the fans with wear them down I believe and we'll see a special edition soon.
I:8381;791;I keep the treasure mostly to myself.
I:8381;792;I really really love this movie.
I:8381;793;It's so refreshing to see an animated movie these days that's actually got a good story line.
I:8381;794;I won't give away the details and ruin it for everyone, but this movie is about using your imagination to see the good in life.
I:8381;795;It's been a while since I saw a movie that was this creative and fun to watch, and I'm not even a kid anymore.
I:8381;796;We love everything he has ever done.
I:8381;797;This one is our favorite.
I:8381;798;we still reach for the other version more often.
I:8381;799;Having said that, it's still one of my favorite movies regardless of who's doing the voices :)
I:8381;800;This film is one of my personal favorites.
I:8381;801;It is far above being an average kids movie.
I:8381;802;"It is wonderful as a children's movie
I:8381;803;It is also a favorite among the many fans of its creator, Academy Award winner Hayao Miyazaki.
I:8381;804;As being usual with the master animator, My Neighbor Totoro is another masterpiece from Miyazaki.
I:8381;805;The film set in Japan is beautifully animated by traditional methods (hand.
I:8381;806;drawn) with glorious detail in every frame.
I:8381;807;The story is a simple one but will captivate the hearts of children and adults everywhere.
I:8381;808;Is refreshing to see an animated film that does not rely on action sequences, explosions and a constant feeling of peril.
I:8381;809;Joe Hisaishi's score is an excellent companion to the visuals.
I:8381;810;Video is clear and strong, only fine grain appears in some scenes.
I:8381;811;The 2.0 dolby sound is nothing spectacular but it is clear and crisp.
I:8381;812;The movie is in anamorphic widescreen (really nice).
I:8381;813;Personally I prefer the Japanese track because it feels more natural and fluent.
I:8381;814;my Neighbor Totoro is one of the best animated films ever.
I:8381;815;I have enjoyed Totoro for many years and this is the best.
I:8381;816;Great for young children and adults alike.
I:8381;817;My granddaughter absolutely loves this movie and she's only one year old.
I:8381;818;We have watched and enjoyed it many times.
I:8381;819;The original English dub of this wonderful film is so far superior to the Disney dub.
I:8381;820;it's lost the charm, the warmth, the love of the original dub.
I:8381;821;I don't expect to watch it again and will probably sell it.
I:8381;822;The older Totoro with the original English voices is better.
I:8381;823;It gets high marks from people who haven't seen the Fox dub.
I:8381;824;It is lambasted by those who have.
I:8381;825;So if you haven't seen the Fox version, you will probably be fine with the Disney dub.
I:8381;826;"The one good thing about it is that it's widescreen and in the extras
I:8381;827;A good English dub of Japanese anime is absolutely RARE and this is one of the few shining examples of a perfect dub.
I:8381;828;Dust bunnies is waaaay cuter and fits much better within the confines of the story.
I:8381;829;THAT is one of the elements that makes the Fox dub so enduring, they understood what CUTE was in relation to a very cute and sweet movie.
I:8381;830;perfect example of Studio Ghibli's wonderful trademarked style.
I:8381;831;The plot isn't particularly deep or elaborate, but in many ways I can see that as a positive .
I:8381;832;why force drama into a scenario that's working perfectly well as a quiet, leisurely stroll down imagination lane?
I:8381;833;Magnificent animation pairs with a breathtaking setting, a playful spirit, a lovable cast of characters, great timing and a moderate dash of real.
I:8381;834;Authentic and vivid and pleasant, with at least one foot planted firmly in our world.
I:8381;835;My family enjoys all of the Miyazaki movies.
I:8381;836;This one is great for kids.
I:8381;837;Nice story and character development.
I:8381;838;Clean and sweet without being cloying or syrupy.
I:8381;839;Occasional repeat viewings are enjoyable (I rarely watch movies more than once).
I:8381;840;p. s. other reviews will be more than happy to fill you in on the plot and other Miyazaki movies.
I:8381;841;My brothers and I grew up watching the original Totoro dub by Fox and we still love and enjoy it.
I:8381;842;all of Miyazaki's films are tremendous, but this one in particular appeals to all ages.
I:8381;843;old will watch 'Spirited Away' with no qualms, 'My Neighbour Totoro' provides a similar magical adventure without the scary creatures.
I:8381;844;The totoro forest spirits are completely lovable, and will capitivate the imagination.
I:8381;845;Share this magical movie with your family and you won't be disappointed.
I:8381;846;yr old will watch repeatedly and so will I. great music, gorgeous scenery, lovely story, good messages, and the voices done by the Fanning sisters are A+++.
I:8381;847;My wife had never seen it so I bought it to show to her.
I:8381;848;Still holds up after all these years.
I:8381;849;I realize the film is more.
I:8381;850;Nobody captures the magic of childhood and bottles it into movie form quite like Hayao Miyazaki .
I:8381;851;There's not much actual plot, but the journey is the truly lovely part, and the lush animation and weird creatures (catbus!
I:8381;852;The girls are immediately taken under the wing of an old lady, and discover that the countryside is filled with strange and magical creatures .
I:8381;853;growing trees, flying with umbrellas, and riding in the cat.
I:8381;854;My Neighbor Totoro is sort of a fantasy slice.
I:8381;855;to that end, Miyazaki spins up a magical little world .
I:8381;856;It's all painted in lush, vibrant colors and great detail, and Miyazaki does a good job emphasizing the little moments of everyday life (Mei showing up at Satsuki's school) and interweaving them with the more fantastical stuff (Totoro flying across windswept fields with an umbrella).
I:8381;857;there's a genuinely touching subplot in which the girls hear that their mother is ill again, and there's a genuine sense of fear.
I:8381;858;the characters are all rather simple, but they're still quite likable, with upbeat personalities and loud laughter.
I:8381;859;Satsuki is particular is a realistic kid, staying positive most of the time but occasionally blowing up at Mei or crying out of fear that her mother will die.
I:8381;860;this movie has always gotten skimped somewhat on the extras, so it's nice to see that it's finally getting some attention .
I:8381;861;it has the Disney dub (which is quite good) and original Japanese dub, storyboards, behind.
I:8381;862;"scenes featurette, and a pair of interactive features called ""World of Ghibli"" and ""Enter the Lands""."
I:8381;863;"while it's more obviously aimed at kids than many of Miyazaki's movies, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is an enchanting little story with a warm heart, and Hayao Miyazaki perfectly captures the innocence of childhood."
I:8381;864;Utterly charming Hayao Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli Anime tale of two girls whose family moves to the Japanese countryside becuase the mother has to be in a hospital for some undisclosed illness.
I:8381;865;There are so few films about girls who are courageous,compassionate, and NOT militarized, and this is a superb example of what CAN be done!
I:8381;866;new English language cast, widescreen presentation and a second disc of bonus features.
I:8381;867;Two other films will be released the same day .
I:8381;868;i enjoyed this movie fully.
I:8381;869;It's widescreen presentations was flawless and full of color.
I:8381;870;next debate, the new dub.
I:8381;871;It was my favorite movie.
I:8381;872;I really loved watching it.
I:8381;873;Disney does a great job at these Ghibli movies.
I:8381;874;then Wow they sound older than they look.
I:8381;875;i know Dakota Fanning is a great young actress, but she sounded older than the previous one who played her.
I:8381;876;I also noticed a lot of dialouge changes.
I:8381;877;That way i get my favorite dialogue and good video.
I:8381;878;Its glimpses of the real are as entrancing as its detours into the fantastic.
I:8381;879;Miyazaki understands that childhood is a lithe, fanciful terrain haunted by wisps of mystery and foreboding .
I:8381;880;It's a great film, and that version transmitted the greatness.
I:8381;881;This version is even better.
I:8381;882;For one thing, the breathtaking landscape backgrounds are brilliant in their intensity.
I:8381;883;These child actresses bring an authenticity that is unparalleled.
I:8381;884;But they are also excellent actresses.
I:8381;885;The emotions are right on.
I:8381;886;They made a great film even better.
I:8381;887;I love it as much as my daughter does.
I:8381;888;You will love this movie.
I:8381;889;Your favorite munchkins will also love this movie.
I:8381;890;that having been said, everything about the movie itself is very, very right.
I:8381;891;The animation is beautiful, rich and detailed, and the story is simple enough for kids to understand, yet deep enough to reward multiple viewings.
I:8381;892;frame, identical to the Japanese version .
I:8381;893;This gem shines through even Fox's completely lackluster presentation.
I:8381;894;The true beauty of the film unfolded and for the first time I saw why My Neighbor Totoro is such a well.
I:8381;895;The original Japanese soundtrack, with the inflections and cute little voices of the children (especially Mei's) really add to the film, even though I don't speak Japanese.
I:8381;896;the inflections are so much more genuine, and the subtitles are very easy to follow.
I:8381;897;This is an oddly personal film, at times it feels like we're invading the privacy of this family through their home movies.
I:8381;898;They've just moved into a new house and we're allowed to watch the exuberance of two sisters as they explore the place with giddy anticipation of what they might find.
I:8381;899;It's a simple story, merry and infectious, where even the discovery of tadpoles is wondrous.
I:8381;900;"The characters are a marvel
I:8381;901;As always, the spoken and written words didn't match.
I:8381;902;I've always believed that voice work should go to actors willing to create a voice suited to a character.
I:8381;903;"A ""famous"" voice is always jarring because it calls to mind that actor and not the character you're watching."
I:8381;904;Next time I view this movie it will be with the Japanese tracks and English subtitles.
I:8381;905;Otherwise, this is a thoroughly charming film.
I:8381;906;Totoro is a delight, a little scary when he smiles and roars, but still a delight.
I:8381;907;I'm happy to include this movie in my collection.
I:8381;908;A Japanese family is moving to a rural area and dealing with their mother's illness.
I:8381;909;Little Mei and Satsuke have a lot of fun at the new location as they chase susuwatari (dust bunnies), make friends with an elderly lady, a young boy, and as they encounter mysterious fantastical creatures .
I:8381;910;there is a scene particular to the Japanese culture that may be surprising to the Western eye when dad bathes with his two little daughters.
I:8381;911;It is done tastefully and is a natural part of the story.
I:8381;912;This is a gem in the field of animation and of movies in general.
I:8381;913;The movie feels very authentic and some might say anti.
I:8381;914;disney in that the characters are deep and the motives are pure.
I:8381;915;This is the original one I grew up with and I like this dub the best.
I:8381;916;Disney did a great job of cleaning up the art and making the music more clear, but I enjoy this version the best.
I:8381;917;This movie and its music are both lovely.
I:8381;918;It is incandescent, just a wonderful artistic movie.
I:8381;919;But the best part of the movie is the relationship between the two sisters.
I:8381;920;It is a real sister relationship, without the contrived fights or the saccharine relationships that seem to be a part of so many other portrayals of sisters in movies.
I:8381;921;The sisters love each other, care for each other, and take care of each other.
I:8381;922;My two daughters very much love seeing this aspect of the movie.
I:8381;923;in fact, if you play the movie again right after you've seen it once, you'll most likely still have the happy/ magical feeling and will still feel a connection to the characters, so can pass of the annoying as.
I:8381;924;the girls take us on a journey, seeing the world through their eyes.
I:8381;925;when they get there they start bumping into spirits, and continue to do so throughout the movie.
I:8381;926;the story itself is a very plain story about two girls living their regular lives, waiting for their mother to come home from the hospital, but this magical world that only the girls can interact with and see takes the story to a whole other level.
I:8381;927;the magical beings the girls interact with can easily be rationalized as the imaginations of these two girls as they make more of their surroundings than is actually there (for example the soot gremlins could be just dust balls), but even if that is the case, it makes the story that much more fantastic.
I:8381;928;an adult however, much more skeptical than a child, may not do so and will look for instances to rationalize away the magic (soot gremlins = dust balls), and to that adult this story has the wonderful lesson of seeing the extraordinary in the ordinary.
I:8381;929;that's also why it helps to watch the movie twice as an adult to enjoy it, you get over your inhibitions and desire to make it fit into your own life after seeing it the first time, for those who don't need the first time i salute you.
I:8381;930;it's a wonderful movie, and as it's a myazaki film, definitely worth the watch.
I:8381;931;Two little girls move to the country with their father and discover magical creatures in the woods around their house.
I:8381;932;This may not be one of Miyazaki's more epic movies, but it certainly belongs high on the list of good anime movies.
I:8381;933;Like all the rest this is great, refreshing from some of the creepy and highly political adult propaganda cartoon videos for children.
I:8381;934;enjoyable, as all of them have been.
I:8381;935;My sons loved this movie growing up.
I:8381;936;I thought I would gift each of them, since they are older and still talk about this movie.
I:8381;937;I thought I was really giving them a special treat from their boyhood days.
I:8381;938;I should have viewed the cover but, I jumped on the Two.
I:8381;939;We loved it, and even though we've seen it about a million times I have yet to feel like I have watched it too much.
I:8381;940;I am very happy that I have the old Fox version.
I:8381;941;It will continue to be the version watched in my home since it has the dignity that I believe the original My Neighbor Totoro has.
I:8381;942;It's lost most of the magical beauty that was in it.
I:8381;943;The Fox version may not be as visually stunning, but the translation is so much better, as is the voice acting.
I:8381;944;It's part of the wonder of childhood, and that wonder is normally very well expressed in Studio Ghibli films.
I:8381;945;My daughter was two when we first viewed each of those films and saying both words and knew what they meant!
I:8381;946;I surprised him with it for Christmas and it brought back a lot of memories.
I:8381;947;I first learned of this movie in 1998 from a group of friends.
I:8381;948;I've never felt more joy from a movie.
I:8381;949;It's great to watch when you're just bummed, or sick.
I:8381;950;The animation and music are amazing.
I:8381;951;I love this so much I've watched it many times.
I:8381;952;This is appropriate for any age.
I:8381;953;The animation will astound you.
I:8381;954;The music is so wonderful.
I:8381;955;Truly an incredible and heart.
I:8381;956;I commend Disney for NOT adding extra dialog during the many quiet moments.
I:8381;957;"This first is the greatest ""Con."""
I:8381;958;This one's more a matter of personal preference, but the subtitles cover up the beautiful animation.
I:8381;959;"In some scenes, the subtitles cover up the main characters, obscuring the ""action."""
I:8381;960;i really love this movie.
I:8381;961;It's a great film with great imagery and characteres.
I:8381;962;Yet this is one wonderful movie.
I:8381;963;It is one of those rare works that are *so* original, and yet works so well, that they are all but impossible to describe.
I:8381;964;My Neighbor Totoro is a delightful film that even this adult loves.
I:8381;965;My Neighbor Totoro is a fun, light hearted film.
I:8381;966;"It may not have that serious, epic feel of Miyazaki's films like ""Spirited Away"" and ""Princess Mononoke"" but it is just as engaging to watch."
I:8381;967;the Disney version is still a charming movie, but the Fox version is more charming.
I:8381;968;The Fox dubbing makes it more sincere, in a way.
I:8381;969;My Woman loves studio ghibli and getting this for her made her day.
I:8381;970;"They complain that the ""original"" is better."
I:8381;971;"Folks, the ""original"" soundtrack is in Japanese!"
I:8381;972;What I notice most of the complaintants are NOT mentioning are the story and the fantastic animation.
I:8381;973;Miyazaki (and the fine people at Studio Ghibli) is an artist of that same caliber.
I:8381;974;My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful film that everyone can enjoy.
I:8381;975;As with virtually every other Miyazaki film, the characters are portrayed exceptionally well, very three dimensional and very human.
I:8381;976;The story is delightful, human and interesting.
I:8381;977;The animation is a feast for the eyes.
I:8381;978;If you know that name, then you are my best friend, because you probably recognize him as the genius behind Mother, Mother 2 (EarthBound), and Mother 3, the absolutely legendary RPG's.
I:8381;979;He was the voice of the girls' father, and quite honestly I can't see anyone doing a better job.
I:8381;980;He alone makes the original version superior in my opinion.
I:8381;981;so in the end, it's a fantastic movie, with a fantastic Japanese language track.
I:8381;982;I would recommend viewers to just get the film, it's well worth the watch.
I:8381;983;i bought the second for my wife and I, [Fox version] and thought it was great.
I:8381;984;All one has to do is check my film listings, and you will see that I love Japanese cinema, and have since I was a child in the early to mid 1960s.
I:8381;985;There are plenty of reviews of this film describing this magical cinematic treat, and you and your children will definitely enjoy the film.
I:8381;986;This film is highly recommended.
I:8381;987;I had the VHS version of this and I loved it.
I:8381;988;He's just finished watching it right now.
I:8381;989;my daughter absolutely adores this movie, as do my wife and i. it's super simple and super enjoyable.
I:8381;990;This is, first and foremost, a film of remarkable beauty and warmth.
I:8381;991;It is precious and timeless.
I:8381;992;I love this movie and my 3YO loves it too.
I:8381;993;This is a movie that have humanity, realism and love.You will love the girls.
I:8381;994;a simple and touching history!
I:8381;995;A life of two sisters who find a friend, Totoro, who will help them the to visit their mom in and adventurous way.
I:8381;996;This is an incredible piece of art that should be seen by people of all ages.
I:8381;997;"While this movie is aimed towards children, anyone can enjoy it
I:8381;998;Hayao Miyazaki has a gift for making films seem real, for making the impossible a reality, and for making imaginative pieces that more than top the garbage that comes out of Disney these days.
I:8381;999;And the catbus is awesome!
I:8381;1000;"They love ""helping the garden/trees"" grow, they dance and sing to the opening credits, are thrilled to see the ""cat bus"" and adore Totoro (the cat."
I:8381;1001;I've gotten all of my friends and their children hooked on this instant classic.
I:8381;1002;Such a sweet story with loveable characters.
I:8381;1003;Your family will love watching it again and again :)
I:8381;1004;The heroines are strong, happy, and kind.
I:8381;1005;now my 3 year old daughter loves this movie, and knows it by heart.
I:8381;1006;i recommend it to anyone.
I:8381;1007;The art of this movie is stunning.
I:8381;1008;I just love this movie .
I:8381;1009;It really is a very cute touching film, even if it is a bit slow.
I:8381;1010;I personally found it to be very entertaining, and I'd recommend it as a family film.
I:8381;1011;miyazaki has done a great job of making the sisters seem believable as real children and also likeable .
I:8381;1012;I also loved how elements of reality and fantasy were nicely interwoven .
I:8381;1013;such that the appearance of the Totoro(s) felt believable, yet still cute(and who doesn't want to give the big Totoro a good squeeze?)
I:8381;1014;The film also suceeds in presenting everything from the perspective of the children.
I:8381;1015;The information given is what the children perceive, thus we see the world through their eyes.
I:8381;1016;i also enjoyed their portrayal of the father.
I:8381;1017;He seems to be a very patient, loving father who actually spends some time with his children despite having to work a lot.
I:8381;1018;It's very refreshing to see a film portrayal of the loving sensitive father (we could use more of that).
I:8381;1019;For this reason I think the film has a very positive portrayal of family, thus making it a good family film (there's also a nice lack of violence and swearing, for those with small children).
I:8381;1020;overall, My Neighbor Totoro is an excellent whimsical fantasy tale as well as a good coming of age tale.
I:8381;1021;I highly recommend it both for children and adults.
I:8381;1022;I recently bought the 2010 release with added bonus features, and I'm happy to say that more interesting features have been added.
I:8381;1023;There's some interviews with Miyazaki, the producer, and the composer (which includes info.
I:8381;1024;"My favorite segment (and by far the longest) is a section called ""the locations of totoro"", which basically shows you the real life locations upon which various scenes in Totoro are based."
I:8381;1025;It's almost as charming as the film itself.
I:8381;1026;In addition, the voice actor interviews and storyboards make a return.
I:8381;1027;For all the people out there who wish to know, the movie includes the original Japanese audio track as well as English subtitles.
I:8381;1028;I'd definitely recommend you check out Miyazaki's other movies if you liked this one.
I:8381;1029;Since I'd never heard the Fox dub, I decided to go back and watch it on youtube to get an idea of what this amazing, better.
I:8381;1030;is actually closer the the original Japanese translation.
I:8381;1031;Also, the Fanning sisters do a decent job of voicing Satsuki and Mei.
I:8381;1032;"star reviews from people who are like ""OMG this is the best movie of all time!"
I:8381;1033;my baby and i love it so much ,that now i'm given it to friends.
I:8381;1034;this studio got very good movies ,but this one is our fav
I:8381;1035;"If I have children, I will make sure that ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is among the first films they ever see."
I:8381;1036;This is one of the purest, most untainted children's movies in existence, bursting with the kind of wonder and curiosity that few adults are able to hold onto.
I:8381;1037;"I'm guessing that Hayao Miyazaki is one of those adults
I:8381;1038;"Their mother is ill and has been moved to a local hospital
I:8381;1039;The house is one every child should aspire to live in: quirky, unpredictable, and just unsafe enough to be fun.
I:8381;1040;both a cat and a bus.
I:8381;1041;shaped cross between a cat, a rabbit, and an owl.
I:8381;1042;It seems almost childlike itself, sleepy and curious and delighted by raindrops falling on an umbrella, though it eventually reveals itself to have great elemental power.
I:8381;1043;It is about these sisters, who love each other and who love to explore.
I:8381;1044;It is about something marvelous that they find, something they are still young enough to hold onto.
I:8381;1045;The situation is fantastical, but the characters, ironically enough, are some of the most real people that you will see in an animated film.
I:8381;1046;Few films have that simple power.
I:8381;1047;My Neighbor Totoro is easy to overlook, which is a pity, because it's one of the greatest films ever made.
I:8381;1048;This is a great family movie.
I:8381;1049;Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki are two of my favorites, thank you Disney for getting these in America!
I:8381;1050;Clearly aimed at a younger audience, the video also provides an interesting insight into some of the customs and family life of rural Japan.
I:8381;1051;Children will enjoy and sympathize with the antics of the main character as she attempts to take the place of her ailing mother when they set up the household.
I:8381;1052;Older folk and Japanese anime fans will appreciate the beautifully rendered artistry and blending of scenes and character.
I:8381;1053;reminded me of the times as a kid when our family moved to knew homes a few times and the sense of getting used to new surroundings.
I:8381;1054;I come from a family of 6 siblings and this movie reminded me a lot of my times as a child.
I:8381;1055;The animation is sublime obviously and the story is simple, sweet and moving in an effortless manner.
I:8381;1056;This is a very nice movie to see with all the family.
I:8381;1057;my line of tastes in cinema is closer to cyberpunk epics than children's movies.
I:8381;1058;what really got me to love this film is the scenery.
I:8381;1059;i LOVE films with detailed environments.
I:8381;1060;i would love to visit the part of Japan that inspired the creator and see for myself the beauty.
I:8381;1061;in any case, this film will be enjoyable for anyone that has an open enough mind to try a movie that was originally intended as a young children's story.
I:8381;1062;it is far more entertaining and beautiful than you would expect(ps try and watch the subtitled version too, the granny is hilarious in japanese! )
I:8381;1063;that said, my children absolutely LOVE to watch Totoro.
I:8381;1064;"One of our favorite movies, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is magic for children of all ages, even those of us with whitening hair."
I:8381;1065;"Trees are very important in this tale, similar in rich spiritual significance as J. r. r. Tolkien's love of trees and art (read ""Leaf by Niggle"" inThe Tolkien Reader)."
I:8381;1066;work of Dakota and Elle Fanning is spectacular.
I:8381;1067;Wonderful, Japanese windows open wide to beautiful gardens, and a bathhouse with deep tubs for soaking.
I:8381;1068;"wild property
I:8381;1069;lined tunnel to a gentle, beautiful realm.
I:8381;1070;Later, the girls' father shows them a traditional shine next to the massive tree, and explains that the spirit of the forest lives there.
I:8381;1071;Friendship develops between the older sister, Satsuki, and a schoolmate, and his wise grandmother, who watches over the girls.
I:8381;1072;All ends well with their mother recovering, indicated in the closing credits with the addition of a baby brother.
I:8381;1073;"One of the most exquisite animated scenes is when the Totoro and his tiny companions help the girls' seeds sprout, and then they all fly in the wind with up into their enormous new tree, under a starry sky
I:8381;1074;Great price for blu ray package.
I:8381;1075;Disney movies are pricey, so glad I found this deal
I:8381;1076;"I absolutely agree with Roger Ebert who called ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""One of the most beloved of all family films""."
I:8381;1077;Its colorfully bright and sparkling animation is enchanting.
I:8381;1078;It is incredibly realistic and at the same time makes us along with two main characters, the young sisters ready for a miracle to happen any minute.
I:8381;1079;The gentle story is touching, uplifting, funny, and tender without being overly sentimental or didactic.
I:8381;1080;old Satsuki and her baby sister, curious and energetic 4.
I:8381;1081;The great master Hayao Miyazaki remembers well what it is like to be a child, to see magic in the everyday life and be always ready to encounter it.
I:8381;1082;This ability usually disappears as the child becomes adult but it stays forever in a few chosen, and they become the visionary Artists .
I:8381;1083;(From the IMDB film trivia)Totoro of the title is an adorable funny blue forest spirit who lives in the nest beneath a huge tree and makes the trees grow and the winds blow.
I:8381;1084;Totoro becomes the friend and protector of the sisters and one day he sends them on the bus journey that is like nothing they and the viewers could ever imagine.
I:8381;1085;I wish I could ride that cat bus.
I:8381;1086;What a wild and kind imagination an artist should have to create it.
I:8381;1087;How much happier we all are knowing that Hayao Miyazaki exists and makes his amazing films at the Studio Ghibli for which King Totoro is the mascot.
I:8381;1088;Totoro is one of the best animated features ever made.
I:8381;1089;The characters are totally believable, and the animation is magnificent.
I:8381;1090;The plot is deceptively simple, but emotionally powerful, with a lot of humor.
I:8381;1091;Easily one of the ten best movies I've ever seen!
I:8381;1092;The best anime family oriented release ever!
I:8381;1093;Feel good, furry, and funny.
I:8381;1094;"those are the adjectives I would use to describe the lovable ""Totoro"", the magical creature who inhabits the woodlands in this finely drawn animated film."
I:8381;1095;I had never even heard of this movie, which somehow escaped my notice, but a friend brought it to my attention the other day, and I'm glad she did.
I:8381;1096;"It is one of most imaginative things I've ever seen, while simultaneously doing a fine job of paying homage to the literary classic ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland""."
I:8381;1097;a. minute with famous names and product tie.
I:8381;1098;Some kids might find this boring, but I'm sure loners and kids with bright imaginations will take to it and see the possibilities for their own creativity and wonder.
I:8381;1099;"The nearby forest contains ""totoros,"" who are super adorable fluffy cat."
I:8381;1100;owl creatures that protect the forest.
I:8381;1101;i found the animation beautiful and the pacing very refreshing from what North American animation has offered in the past decade.
I:8381;1102;The totoros are winsome and an antidote to the you.
I:8381;1103;Totoro is silent, mysterious, charming and can sell me plenty of toys just by being himself.
I:8381;1104;It's a very relaxing and highly recommended experience.
I:8381;1105;A good animated film, with a realistic presentation of the interaction of siblings to both enjoyable and frightful situations.
I:8381;1106;The father's unquestioning willingness to go along with and support of his kids is also quite warming.
I:8381;1107;This is an excellent movie and with excellent details in the animation.
I:8381;1108;If you have children it's a must see!
I:8381;1109;I'm 21 years old and I absolutely love Totoro!
I:8381;1110;It's one of those movies you can watch over and over again.
I:8381;1111;Trust me, it's worth the price!
I:8381;1112;I got this for my sister because she loves totoro, plus I bought her the totoro hoodie haha it was a great christmas for her.
I:8381;1113;If you haven't seen it, this is one of the few movies I would feel comfortable recommending sight unseen.
I:8381;1114;Also notable for its strong female characters.
I:8381;1115;The picture is crisp and warm with plenty of detail.
I:8381;1116;Bought this as a gift and the grand kids love it.
I:8381;1117;Good entertainment for them, when they do get to watch TV.
I:8381;1118;It's nice to see an interesting film that doesn't rely on big bangs and an evil person who wants to rule the world.
I:8381;1119;Truly a family frendly film.
I:8381;1120;Hayao Miyazaki, the writer/director of this lovely little film.
I:8381;1121;He is a great artist and master.
I:8381;1122;"roger Ebert has written that this film has ""become the most beloved of all family films."
I:8381;1123;and it has done so without promotion.
I:8381;1124;I enjoyed Timothy Daly and Dakota Fanning's voice overs in the dubbed version.
I:8381;1125;They are created directly from the mind and heart of Miyazaki.
I:8381;1126;the film sets up a realistic scenario.
I:8381;1127;The plot included a charming family bathing scene that seemed to upset some Western viewers.
I:8381;1128;The creatures are very loving and protective.
I:8381;1129;and a great tree sprung to life immediately.
I:8381;1130;and the one where great Totoro produces a spinning top that allows him to fly.
I:8381;1131;What a lovely lesson for children.
I:8381;1132;My favorite creature was the Cat Bus.
I:8381;1133;and the ability to fly.
I:8381;1134;Totoro is our family favorite .
I:8381;1135;We love it sooo much and so do the grand kids!
I:8381;1136;Perfect for popcorn movie night!
I:8381;1137;This original copy is true to language and much better than the remake version!
I:8381;1138;Miyazaki is an amazing director.
I:8381;1139;This movie is one of my favorites!
I:8381;1140;The animation, the music, the story and the direction are all so effortless and moving at the same time that I can't think of any other animation, ever, that's left me feeling so satisfied, inspired and happy.
I:8381;1141;It's so original and good.
I:8381;1142;spirited, the images are just beautiful, the story is absorbing and touching, and there's a wide streak of pure fun and joy like a big vein of gold through the whole thing.
I:8381;1143;I just love this movie.
I:8381;1144;Between this and Princess Mononoke, I am coming to the understanding that Hayao Miyazaki is a major talent in animation .
I:8381;1145;is absolutely classic, and has quickly become one of my all.
I:8381;1146;it is big, and intimidating, and sometimes frightening.
I:8381;1147;He has his own life and his own preoccupations, and one senses that one must approach him with respect.
I:8381;1148;fear and wonder are very closely linked, and Miyazaki understands this.
I:8381;1149;mixed with the stunning vistas of the natural world, rendered in beautiful watercolors.
I:8381;1150;This film is a pure delight.
I:8381;1151;One of the best anime videos I have ever seen.
I:8381;1152;My wife and I are relatively new to Hayao Miyazaki movies, having only seen a couple, but we loved Ponyo, and so I got this for her for Christmas.
I:8381;1153;While I enjoyed Ponyo a little more, Totoro was still fun to watch.
I:8381;1154;i really enjoyed the family ties in the film, the sense of adventure, and just the oddness of the film's plot.
I:8381;1155;It was definitely a fresh film.
I:8381;1156;i loved Ponyo, I enjoyed Totoro, and I'll continue discovering Miyazaki.
I:8381;1157;If you want a cute, family.
I:8381;1158;centered, enjoyable, but quirky film, get this.
I:8381;1159;But I'd still give it a shot.
I:8381;1160;And for the most part, Disney's done a good job bringing their films to America.
I:8381;1161;my Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful film with a great story and lovable characters.
I:8381;1162;Disney went and trashed a wonderful film.
I:8381;1163;One is the title character, and the other is probably the most imaginative character in the story.
I:8381;1164;He is the king of the forest, but he's still cuddly!
I:8381;1165;And he takes good care of Mei and Satsuki.
I:8381;1166;As for Catbus, when I heard it my jaw dropped and I screamed for mercy.
I:8381;1167;I just pray that John Lassetter or Hayao Miyazaki will see this and file a lawsuit.
I:8381;1168;Especially since Spirited is a bit dark and strange, and Totoro, while literally dark, is very warm and friendly for young children.
I:8381;1169;My granddaughter at 2 is a huge anime fan and this is a fabulous movie, beautifully and movingly done, that her sister at 8 also enjoys immensely.
I:8381;1170;Plus the music is extremely catchy and no doubt they'll be singing it for weeks.
I:8381;1171;Our 23 year old granddaughter loved it when she was little and now our 3 year old granddaughter loves it just as much!
I:8381;1172;totoro is on the Studio Ghibli movies, an icon status comparable to Mickey Mouse with Disney and Luxo, Jr. with Pixar.
I:8381;1173;each Miyazaki feature boasts a voice cast of marquee names as well as top Hollywood voice artists.
I:8381;1174;"The ""name"" talent is seen in brief ""behind the microphone"" bonus features ."
I:8381;1175;in which you can sometimes also glimpse the strong supporting casts.
I:8381;1176;dakota and Elle Fanning turn in superb performances as the young sisters in Totoro, a very crucial element in making the English version work.
I:8381;1177;the extraordinary Frank Welker growls as the Totoro himself.
I:8381;1178;Welker, a gifted impressionist who entered voice work as the one and only Fred on Scooby Doo, is perhaps the most heard voice in film and TV today.
I:8381;1179;and that is because My Neighbor Totoro is not just any other animated film or story, it is a revolutionary work that explores the essence and wonder of what it's like to be a child again.
I:8381;1180;From getting lost in an enchanted forest to creeping up a stairway that leads into a dark and dusty attic, Hayoa Miyazaki creates an unbelievably magical feel that will make you take a second look at the everyday environments that you might usually take for granted and perhaps even give you a new found respect for them.
I:8381;1181;In it, a father and his two daughters share a hot bath together, which was common in Japan during the time period [circa 1950's].
I:8381;1182;Which is true, and which is why only a non.
I:8381;1183;american director could make a film without a shred of moral corruption or cynicism and still make it enjoyable.
I:8381;1184;I was surprised that Disney would produce another English translation since one had been done earlier by 20th Century.
I:8381;1185;for those who have not seen Totoro, this is a must.
I:8381;1186;After The Castle of Cagliostro, this is Hayao Miyazaki's greatest work.
I:8381;1187;It is pitched for the delight of smaller children, but it easily captures the imagination of an adult.
I:8381;1188;All of Disney's Studio Ghibli translations are worth owning.
I:8381;1189;The story is so simple and beautifully executed on film.
I:8381;1190;The fantastic with the normal like the dreamworld fusing into the reality of your life.
I:8381;1191;Ghibli is known for this great artistic ability and why their films are always on the top lists for classics.
I:8381;1192;Even as an adult this film works wonderfully like a kiss of sunlight on morning flowers.
I:8381;1193;What a way to start a business, with this film and Grave of the Fireflies, both touching the heart of the child in most everyone.
I:8381;1194;Upon moving into a house, the girls discover a fantastical world both in their new home and in the environment around them .
I:8381;1195;dust spirits, cat buses, and Totoros (3 of them!)
I:8381;1196;While they learn the secrets of the world around them, the Totoros help the girls navigate the sadness of their mother's separation from them.
I:8381;1197;With the Totoros' help, the girls manage to find a new emotional balance that helps them to come to terms with their mother's absence.
I:8381;1198;And Totoro is so famous and well.
I:8381;1199;loved that he even makes cameos in other films .
I:8381;1200;This story is really heart warming and now that I've watched the film twice, I have to say that it ranks in the top ten animated films of all time for me.
I:8381;1201;There are just certain moments that will leave you smiling .
I:8381;1202;additionally, if you have some knowledge of Japanese cultures and religions, then this story will make perfect sense given that the Japanese have traditionally believed in Animism, a belief system where animals and plants are imbued with spirits.
I:8381;1203;If you've already watched it, watch it again.
I:8381;1204;There are so many reviews of this masterful film that it is hard to justify another.
I:8381;1205;It is a delightful kid's film, an absorbing adult film and is therefore a member of that very small collection of art works that are truely family oriented.
I:8381;1206;first, Miyazaki consistently creates the greatest girl characters that I know of.
I:8381;1207;They are heartfelt, kind, independent, loving, brave and very determined.
I:8381;1208;It is a simple beautiful moment where a young child practices courage.
I:8381;1209;This film is full of such moments.
I:8381;1210;the animation is also full of moments of great natural beauty as well as surrealistic imagery.
I:8381;1211;Miyazaki takes the time to show us beautiful forest scences or a rain puddle in a storm with a frog hopping across the screen.
I:8381;1212;the totoros themselves, the CatBus and the other spirits are the work of a Japanese Lewis Carroll.
I:8381;1213;This man's imagination and humanity are as timeless as Carroll's.
I:8381;1214;This is an easily available version at a great price.
I:8381;1215;I have a sixteen week old daughter and this is the first work of art I have bought her.
I:8381;1216;the bits about catbus and totoro are so dreamlike that it is the only possible explanation.
I:8381;1217;i love the references to shintoism in this movie.
I:8381;1218;for a westerner it is so refreshing to see a movie where the references to nature and to the native religion of japan is so gracefully illustrated.
I:8381;1219;this is simply one of the best movies i have ever seen.
I:8381;1220;the story is just so touching.
I:8381;1221;i rate this movie up there with the reading of the bible for spiritual refreshment.
I:8381;1222;i highly recommend this film for kids.
I:8381;1223;This is one of my favorite movies of all times.
I:8381;1224;It's fun to watch no matter what age you are.
I:8381;1225;This is a classic that will never lose its charm!
I:8381;1226;It's awesome and fun to watch!
I:8381;1227;Either way, a good movie!
I:8381;1228;Dakota Fanning and Miyazaki Hayao make a great team in this classic tale.
I:8381;1229;This is one that everyone must own, even if you don't have any kids in your household.
I:8381;1230;It makes a great gift, too!
I:8381;1231;A beautiful classic that I will gladly watch over and over again!
I:8381;1232;A must see for everyone!
I:8381;1233;The animation is spectacular, and its portrayal of childhood imagination is deeply inspired.
I:8381;1234;It deals with the rich blend of childrens' joys and fears in a story that is one of the few films our entire family can watch again and again, even as the youngest hits adulthood.
I:8381;1235;In fact, fans of movies, in general, and of art must give Mr. Miyazaki his due propers.
I:8381;1236;The man is a genius in his purview, and he works hard.
I:8381;1237;Simply remarkable, the craftsmanship and soul and depth fused into these pictures.
I:8381;1238;Set on a more intimate scale than Mr. Miyazaki's other, more grandiose efforts, it's one of the best family films around, particularly in terms of portraying the family interrelationships.
I:8381;1239;The way in which the two young girls connect to each other is disarming and a sheer pleasure to watch.
I:8381;1240;He listens and even ventures an explanation.
I:8381;1241;the plot, real quick: Two young girls (with their dad) move to rural Japan to be closer to their ailing mother, who temporarily resides in a nearby hospital.
I:8381;1242;Along the way, the girls .
I:8381;1243;this is a rare film in that it contains neither villains nor violence.
I:8381;1244;Mr. Miyazaki renders his supernatural world so benevolent and wondrous that it elicits delighted smiles, and not shudders.
I:8381;1245;visually, technically, emotionally, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is a beautiful film.
I:8381;1246;No surprise then that Hayao Miyazaki writes, directs, and draws this thing.
I:8381;1247;There's an enchanting simplicity here, with a leisurely pace and a narrative which isn't rushed.
I:8381;1248;Again, respect to Mr. Miyazaki's attention to detail.
I:8381;1249;As usual, Mr. Miyazaki injects his cast with an appreciation and respect for nature.
I:8381;1250;And nature reciprocates in the form of the forest spirit Totoro, whose simple pleasures are sights to behold, from his lazy enjoyment of an afternoon nap to his infectious glee at the raindrops pelting his umbrella.
I:8381;1251;there's a joy in the sisters' interactions with Totoro.
I:8381;1252;There's something quite moving about this mysterious creature guiding the girls in a mystical rite to make their slow.
I:8381;1253;growing acorns shoot up into mature oak trees.
I:8381;1254;And, when, earlier, Totoro soared the night skies on his magical top, with the children and the little totoros crazily clinging to him, what a truly glorious and uplifting moment.
I:8381;1255;"a segment featuring the English voiceover actors (Dakota and Elle Fanning are a delight)
I:8381;1256;Meanwhile, Disc 2, if you have it, offers the original Japanese storyboards for the entire film.
I:8381;1257;as ever, Mr. Miyazaki's humanity and perceptiveness shine thru.
I:8381;1258;And this I can't emphasize enough: The film has appealing magical creatures, yes.
I:8381;1259;And the film presents several stunning magical sequences, sure.
I:8381;1260;Satsuki and Mei are simply irresistible, wonderfully realized characters.
I:8381;1261;sufficiency and warmth of Satsuki.
I:8381;1262;The cute stubbornness of Mei (maybe an ear of corn CAN cure maladies).
I:8381;1263;Gentle and whimsical and enchanting, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is recommended for the young and the young.
I:8381;1264;heart and even the cranky.
I:8381;1265;I'm a great fan of Hayao Miyazaki and so was not surprised when I enjoyed this film.
I:8381;1266;While I still enjoy other Miyazaki films more, this film has definitely found a place on my movie shelf.
I:8381;1267;I recently saw Kiki's Delvery Service and really liked it and thought this would be just as good given the glowing reviews.
I:8381;1268;I got really disturbed by the characters' huge mouths.
I:8381;1269;My kids even commented on the funny faces and big open mouths.
I:8381;1270;On a lighter note, fans of the Rugrats will notice that the little girl is voiced by the same person who does Angelica.
I:8381;1271;It got here very fast for me, I ordered it and it was here within maybe four or five days IF that.
I:8381;1272;My family and I adore it and so did several friends.
I:8381;1273;I wanted widesceen and vivid color, but the new version of the dubbing had my son in tears.
I:8381;1274;Leave it to Disney to promote monsters (and the smart.
I:8381;1275;mouthed children on the Disney Channel) over the beauty and simplicity of traditional Japanese lore.
I:8381;1276;A very charming anime for young children.
I:8381;1277;They meet and befriend the local spirits who ultimately help them.
I:8381;1278;what an awesome movie, its so happy and uplifting!
I:8381;1279;and Totoro is like a giant fluffy cool thing!
I:8381;1280;this movie was so good!
I:8381;1281;it left you with a happy feeling wanting more!
I:8381;1282;Reccomend this movie to anyone!
I:8381;1283;Bought it for my Lady.
I:8381;1284;We watched it and it turned out to be really good.
I:8381;1285;this has been one of the most magical movies in my life since I was younger, and I'm thrilled that Disney decided to release several Miyazaki/Ghibli movies.
I:8381;1286;so far, Disney has done wonderfully in my opinion, with other voice.
I:8381;1287;overs of these films and with preserving the overall feel that the movie was originally supposed to have.
I:8381;1288;they had quite a challenge, however, following the magnificent job that Fox had done years earlier.
I:8381;1289;I loved it because while some things may not have been directly translated (the opening theme), the overall feeling of the movie stayed the same and the voices fit wonderfully with the characters.
I:8381;1290;it always has been and always will be, so I believe that it should be presented as such.
I:8381;1291;the voice acting in this version is well done, as is the translation job of course (this .
I:8381;1292;It is still a perfectly wonderful version, but I have to wonder if the voice actors they chose were the best choices they could have made.
I:8381;1293;it's worth it to watch.
I:8381;1294;i appreciate Disney for translating these wonderful movies, and they do an excellent job.
I:8381;1295;Was one of my favorites as a kid.
I:8381;1296;This was a gift for my daughter=in.
I:8381;1297;It combines simplicity and elegance to form a beautiful movie for children, teens, and even adults.
I:8381;1298;This movie contains no violence seen in many other modern anime.
I:8381;1299;based movies, and is just plain enjoyable to watch.
I:8381;1300;It opens up the imagination of kids and is definitely a must.
I:8381;1301;watch for everyone in the family.
I:8381;1302;The scenery is at times very nice, especially with shadows, but there is nothing memorable.
I:8381;1303;My son and I are huge Studio Ghibli fans.
I:8381;1304;"My son is 20 months old and ""totoro"" was one of his first words."
I:8381;1305;I love the original film but I think that the Disney dubbing is wonderfuly done as well.
I:8381;1306;I love the opportunity to share well made movies with well thought out plots and characterization with the children in my life.
I:8381;1307;I am glad Disney is releasing wonderful English versions of these films.
I:8381;1308;It is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8381;1309;he loves it so much that he kept on saying Totoro!
I:8381;1310;It is a favorite at my house.
I:8381;1311;I love the character of totoro, he's such a giant cute ball of fur, I felt sad after watching this that such a creature doesn't exist in real life.
I:8381;1312;But if there's one thing Miyazaki does well is convey a sense of stellar imagination and MNT has that in spades.
I:8381;1313;Personally I love his other works more but this is a classic too in its own right.
I:8381;1314;This movie is easily one of my favorite of all time.
I:8381;1315;Entertaining for children and adults.
I:8381;1316;I bought this movie because I loved watching it as a kid.
I:8381;1317;The story is amazing and is sure to entertain viewers of all ages.
I:8381;1318;"There is a reason that so many people have a deep appreciation for this movie
I:8381;1319;I just bought it and I can't even watch it all the way through.
I:8381;1320;It is definately worth it to try to track down the fox family version.
I:8381;1321;The usual Ghibli subtext of the magic of nature is present too.
I:8381;1322;the good news is, you can't go wrong with this film.
I:8381;1323;It's beautifully animated, intelligent and well.
I:8381;1324;pS Disney pulled the same stunt with their release of Ghibli's Kiki's Delivery Service.
I:8381;1325;miyazaki is japan's premier cartoonist.
I:8381;1326;not only is this movie adorable (gotta love totoro!!!)
I:8381;1327;Totoro has got to be my favorite family movie to watch.
I:8381;1328;Even though i am an adult now, and i watched the movie frequently when i was a child, i still love watching the movie when ever i get the chance of free time.
I:8381;1329;Its a great movie and i highly recommend it to kids and adults of all ages.
I:8381;1330;When you describe this movie in one word, you need to say, Cute!
I:8381;1331;i have the orginal tape that streamline put out back in the early 90's and have pretty much grown up with the movie and i love it.
I:8381;1332;It took always all that we love about the anime.
I:8381;1333;It is a pure, sweet, innocent joy to watch, and seeing it always made me feel a little happier.
I:8381;1334;what was even better was introducing it to my 3 year old and discovering that we could enjoy watching it together.
I:8381;1335;"There are no guns, no violence, no bad words, no loud obnoxious songs or characters
I:8381;1336;, and a story that really draws you into caring for this imaginary family.
I:8381;1337;It would make me so happy to have this movie be the very first movie I could take my son to see.
I:8381;1338;etc. please, someone at Disney, hear my plea.
I:8381;1339;I'm sure this is great for those who've never seen the older(original?)
I:8381;1340;"This film is satisfying on several levels:1) animation is done with extreme care
I:8381;1341;human are done very well.
I:8381;1342;4) original and a very nice break from DisneyI recommend this film to anyone with a child or even a child's sense of wonder.
I:8381;1343;a good balance is struck here for all the characters involved.
I:8381;1344;i recommend this film in particular to people who have daughters.
I:8381;1345;Studio Ghibli has always done wonderful work with females as lead characters.
I:8381;1346;Female characterization by Ghibli is the most solid of all the anime studios and alas, many regular film studios.
I:8381;1347;The female characters are done with depth and a certain understanding that is rare.
I:8381;1348;It says something that they are moved as well.
I:8381;1349;Probably the most memorable of all of Miyazaki's movies, this one has become a true legend in the field of animation.
I:8381;1350;This one was done mostly for young children, and it pulls it off wonderfully without being too cheesy or sappy.
I:8381;1351;like spirits(who also make an appearance in Spirited Away).
I:8381;1352;larger forest spirit who calls himself Totoro.
I:8381;1353;After offering him a spare umbrella, he gives them some seeds, and then gets a ride on a giant cat bus!
I:8381;1354;The girls plant the seeds in their backyard, and Totoro visits them the next night by making them into a huge tree, which is gone by the next morning.
I:8381;1355;This is all minor though considering how whimsical and entertaining it is, and for all ages.
I:8381;1356;Any animation fan worth his salt is dutybound to seeing this movie as part of their bucket list.
I:8381;1357;Disney continues its lack of respect for Studio Ghibli's wonderful material.
I:8381;1358;release, actually, but I digress).
I:8381;1359;Jo Hisaishi's terrific score deserves loving care.
I:8381;1360;the positive here is that the visuals are better.
I:8381;1361;I was glad for the wider format, and the colors were more vibrant, closer to the amazing color of Spirited Away, the best colored animation in many years.
I:8381;1362;Fun to watch, entertaining, and completely creative.
I:8381;1363;With Anime, I watch it first in English to get the basic plot and then I watch it in Japanese with the subtitles because it adds much more clarity to the story line.
I:8381;1364;But the movie is warm hearted and very clever.
I:8381;1365;Honestly, I think this guy's more creative than Walt Disney himself.
I:8381;1366;But I still respect Disney because they have done an excellent job (so far) with Spirited Away and Castle in the Sky.
I:8381;1367;This movie is beloved by my family, and is great for kids.
I:8381;1368;I want the best English version of the movie more than I want extras.
I:8381;1369;This movie is HIGHLY recommended for all Miyazaki fans, and Anime fans in general.
I:8381;1370;numbers and have largely succeeded.
I:8381;1371;if you're new to Totoro, my advice holds.
I:8381;1372;"This movie has become a part of our family's unspoken list of ""Media that we want our kids and their kids and so on to experience"" right up there with Richard Scarrey, Bugs Bunny and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends."
I:8381;1373;In a recent course I taught on Japanese animation, I used My Neighbor Totoro during the section of the course on auteur theory and Hayao Miyazaki.
I:8381;1374;something, from anime newcomers to diehard otaku, and they ALL seemed to really love this film.
I:8381;1375;Through these two young girls, we discover Totoro, Nekobus/Catbus, and plenty of other imaginary/magical/fantasy creatures which are often comedic and always kind and caring towards the children.
I:8381;1376;"The girls learn from these creatures, and teach the creatures as well
I:8381;1377;acting is absolutely SUPERB .
I:8381;1378;acting is excellent in providing an aural portrayal of the characters of the film.
I:8381;1379;this is one of the best films ever for children.
I:8381;1380;"My Neighbor Totoro shows a lot of imagination on the part of Hayao Miyazaki and his animation team
I:8381;1381;To start off this was a great movie.
I:8381;1382;The movie is great for kids, anime freaks who are looking for something a little less gory, and famillys.
I:8381;1383;Great movie and I'm raising another little family on the original.
I:8381;1384;This is a wonderful movie.
I:8381;1385;It was used but it is still in great condition.
I:8381;1386;So I saved up and bought the original.
I:8381;1387;The facial expressions on the girls are delightful.
I:8381;1388;And their mannerisms and personalities, ditto the way they interact as sisters, are perfect.
I:8381;1389;highly recommend this for all ages.
I:8381;1390;Bold colors, perfect compression, and crystal sound.
I:8381;1391;and it goes without saying that this movie has a great story.
I:8381;1392;It is touted as one of the most beloved family movies of all time, and I have to agree.
I:8381;1393;visit some Miyazaki movies and loved this one, our kids love it too!It was a little weird getting used to Disney's dubbing instead of the older dubbing, but we like it better.
I:8381;1394;I think that this movie is great for the entire family.
I:8381;1395;It's a very good movie, for kids especially.
I:8381;1396;If you liked this I highly recommend Spirited Away which is also directed by Hitoshi Takagi.
I:8381;1397;I always see something new in its gorgeous animation.
I:8381;1398;The story is of two sisters experiencing a magical connection with the king of the forest (Totoro) who teaches them and helps them in a time of need.
I:8381;1399;The girl characters are strong, curious, brave and know what they want.
I:8381;1400;Hitoshi Takagi, who recently released the amazing animated film Spirited Away, is considered, in Japan, to be a national treasure.
I:8381;1401;I'm a fan of Miyazaki's work and enjoy watching his films over and over.
I:8381;1402;I especially noticed how well he shows young children's emotions.
I:8381;1403;As always, the scenery is beautifully rendered, the story is sweet, and the characters are believable.
I:8381;1404;The whole family baths together, and since the mom is in the hospital it is just the dad with the two daughters.
I:8381;1405;i think the movie is amazing in its own right and has more than enough charm and character to make up for a simple plot.
I:8381;1406;"First of all, this is a great move
I:8381;1407;My daughters (5 and 8) just love this book.
I:8381;1408;They drew all types of things that had simply never occurred to them to draw before, and created many fun little scenes and stories to go along with them.
I:8381;1409;Simple, fun, and inspiring imagination :)
I:8381;1410;I've long been a fan of his and I still smile watching his films to this day.
I:8381;1411;I really liked this movie.
I:8381;1412;But I thought it was very cute!
I:8381;1413;Enjoyed the animation and visual of this movie.
I:8381;1414;This is a truly beautiful film.
I:8381;1415;Our kids LOVE it and have watched it multiple times already.
I:8381;1416;Right up there with Ponyo, Kiki's Delivery Service and Spirited Away.
I:8381;1417;This is a classic kids film from Hiyao Miyazaki.
I:8381;1418;It's appropriate for a young audience.
I:8381;1419;as an adult, I watched this film a few times through and enjoyed it.
I:8381;1420;I don't know anything about this movie but my granddaughter wanted it for Christmas and she was happy.
I:8381;1421;So that makes me happy!
I:8381;1422;This movie is about a family in 1955 Japan with two girls, Satsuki and her four year old sister Mei.
I:8381;1423;I love the exuberance of the two girls.
I:8381;1424;I love seeing the Japanese countryside and their way of life.
I:8381;1425;seven times, four times in English, and twenty.
I:8381;1426;I'd recommend this movie to anybody who wants to learn something about Japan and wants to watch a delightful family movie with great characters.
I:8381;1427;Beware!I love this film but Disney has destroyed the charm of the original audio by re.
I:8381;1428;This is a family favorite.
I:8381;1429;well, maybe vivacious is better choice of words.
I:8381;1430;Magical, as most Miyazaki films are.
I:8381;1431;This is a beautiful story about two little girls spending the summer in the country while their mother recuperates (probably from tb).
I:8381;1432;Better in the original Japanese, but.
I:8381;1433;Miyazaki is the champion of animation!
I:8381;1434;I watch it with my daughter and we are 42 and 17!
I:8381;1435;Your kids will love it.
I:8381;1436;So will adults that are still kids at heart.
I:8381;1437;The 20th Century Fox version of this movie is what most fans would consider better than the Disney remake.
I:8381;1438;I received the package in about 6.7 days which was expected.
I:8381;1439;My neighbor Totoro is a fantastic movie for kids.
I:8381;1440;My two year old son loves the movie and always wants to watch it.
I:8381;1441;It is an entertaining movie and wonderful language tool.
I:8381;1442;I studied film in college many years ago (I know, big deal.)
I:8381;1443;Anyway, my point is i LOVE good movies, and this is good .
I:8381;1444;Animation or not, it is good because it is a good story.
I:8381;1445;It is a story of two small Japanese sisters just moved to a remarkable magical countryside with their professor dad while their mom recovers from an illness in the hospital.
I:8381;1446;The sisters meet the magical characters that inhabit the area as they worry about their mom.
I:8381;1447;It happens, and it is reasonable in the world of these small children.
I:8381;1448;More importantly it is a story of love.
I:8381;1449;The real magic is about the love within the family.
I:8381;1450;I was first introduced to My Neighbor Totoro about 4 years ago by a friend.
I:8381;1451;Mayazakis' attention to detail (Notice the bottle under the house with the marble stopper in it for instance) as well as the way he conveys the feeling of a hot, summer day, a late afternoon thunderstorm or a sultry full moon night, is artfully and effectively accomplished.
I:8381;1452;I'm guessing that it's resurgence in popularity indicates a re.
I:8381;1453;I've seen both the Japanese voiced version and the English version and I feel the English voices were well cast.
I:8381;1454;This is one of my favorite movies that my mom actually introduced me to.
I:8381;1455;I watched it the minute I got it.
I:8381;1456;The first dub was amazing, full of genuine feelings and portrayals, with a very close translation!
I:8381;1457;I always thought that it was kind of cute but slightly annoying.
I:8381;1458;My Neighbor Totoro is a movie of pure joy.
I:8381;1459;Although the plot is simple enough for young children to follow, it is still equally enjoyable to adults of all ages.
I:8381;1460;Set in Japan, it allows an accurate and intimate look inside its culture and beautiful country, without distracting from the story or straying from universal themes that touch us all.
I:8381;1461;Two young girls, and their Professor father, move to the countryside, near to the hospital where their mother is a patient.
I:8381;1462;Their beautiful old farmhouse is haunted, and all three of them are delighted!
I:8381;1463;I love anything this director makes!!
I:8381;1464;It came to my house fast and in great condition.
I:8381;1465;His stories/movies are so imaginative and enteraining!!!
I:8381;1466;It's extremely cute and fun even for little kids.
I:8381;1467;For me, the original cast of voices are a vital part of the film.
I:8381;1468;The first time my son saw this movie at 4 years old, it captivated him.
I:8381;1469;This has been a family favorite for years, along with other Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli films.
I:8381;1470;If you are interested in Japanese culture, or you have seen and enjoyed the movie Spirited Away or Ponyo, you might enjoy this one.
I:8381;1471;Payment was easy and I received the item earlier than expected.
I:8381;1472;as for the product, I love the movie and wanted to own a copy.
I:8381;1473;The are so many details in this movie, May, the little girl, is precious, innocent, playful and determined in her efforts.
I:8381;1474;A great family movie, my kids love it.
I:8381;1475;In specific this production is Pan Scan, and while you might be able to follow the plot, the beauty of the Miyazaki film is lost.
I:8381;1476;So get the best copy you can afford and enjoy.
I:8381;1477;it is, in fact, from the very first moment, utterly and completely enchanting.
I:8381;1478;"the story of two young girls with their father in a rural ""haunted"" house grabs you from the very first moment."
I:8381;1479;The girls exude the wonder of being children.
I:8381;1480;As the story moves along and the girls make their discoveries and have their adventures, it comes close to being a child again.
I:8381;1481;i highly recommend this film.
I:8381;1482;In my opinion the best Hayao Miyazaki film ever.
I:8381;1483;fun for all ages, but I'm so glad to be able to share these kinds of stories with my son when he's young.
I:8381;1484;I'm also delighted that the Japanese voice track with English subtitles is available in addition to the English dub by Disney.
I:8381;1485;I would defineately recommend this movie.
I:8381;1486;Very good story for children.
I:8381;1487;I remember watching totoro and other studio ghibli movies growing up and now in my mid twenties I still enjoy them as much as I did then.
I:8381;1488;Totoro is absolutely one of my favorites along with howls moving castle that can out a few years back.
I:8381;1489;I have a niece who is almost two who I babysit I was always looking forward to the days when she was big enough to sit and enjoy these wonderful movies that I grow up with and to my surprise she enjoys them as much as I do, she loves totoro and ponyo and Kiki delivery service actually these are the only movies she'll sit for.
I:8381;1490;So I'm glad that I can pass these wonderful movies to the next generation who knows maybe one day she' ll show her niece or nephew.
I:8381;1491;My Neighbor Totoro has become one of my animated favorites.
I:8381;1492;It is a simple and delightful tale of all ages.
I:8381;1493;I believe it to be a masterpiece.
I:8381;1494;the story is simplistic, yet heartwarming.
I:8381;1495;I found myself in both laughter and tears with this film.
I:8381;1496;Two young girls and their father find a new home.
I:8381;1497;The animations were well done and charming, but didn't seem as crisp and colorful as today's films.
I:8381;1498;Still I understand that it is an older movie.
I:8381;1499;The presence of the cute furry animals seemed short lived.
I:8381;1500;Still, the adventures two sisters go on is unforgettable.
I:8381;1501;The scenes are memorable, artistic, and imaginative, but it still takes a tentive viewer to enjoy it without getting anxious for some action.
I:8381;1502;Everything about it from beginning to end had great qualities to it.
I:8381;1503;it's a film that everyone needs to watch now and then, to relax and enjoy the pleasurable things in life.
I:8381;1504;Miazaki's world of adventure and strange creatures is unparalleled in film.
I:8381;1505;Few directors (writers, etc.) have the ability to create such works of truly catholic appeal.
I:8381;1506;The movie will grab you from the beginning and draw you into a place that may (or may not) exist in the mind of any child.
I:8381;1507;Not only is this a great movie for the youngest children, it also attracts us jaded grown.
I:8381;1508;It's a chance to remember what is was like to dream innocent dreams.
I:8381;1509;In that respect, Miazaki does what few since Disney could do.
I:8381;1510;He creates an escape pod for all ages to a wonderful fantasy world.
I:8381;1511;If you have children, or if you just need a break from the drama of the real world, I recommend you meet Totoro.
I:8381;1512;Enjoy the cat bus, and if you can, watch it in Japanese!
I:8381;1513;Personally, I especially enjoyed the depiction of the Japanese countryside and lifestyle of the 50s.
I:8381;1514;Of course they discover Totoro, the Spirit of the Forest, and when they need his help he comes to their aid.
I:8381;1515;My family has loved Totoro since our children were small.
I:8381;1516;Great movie for the kids.
I:8381;1517;Highly recommended especially for children who may be beginning studying Japanese as a second language as there are many songs that are usually taught for their Japanese lessons in the movie.
I:8381;1518;In a career full of animation masterpieces this may be Hayao Miyazaki's best film.
I:8381;1519;less complicated than his other films but still very inventive it follows 2 lonely young girls who befriend magical creatures of the forest.
I:8381;1520;purposely slow and saturated with a love of nature the film perfectly captures the feel of lazy sunny days and beautifully lush green forests.
I:8381;1521;for an animated film the girls are very believable and despite some bizarre sights like the chesire cat bus the film never turns goofy.
I:8381;1522;miyazaki has made more complex action packed films in his career but to me this love poem to nature,family and magic is his most satisfying.
I:8381;1523;My Neighbor Totoro is a film full of youthful energy and the joy of living.
I:8381;1524;The way the children are drawn, how they think, and speak is surprisingly accurate.
I:8381;1525;The film captures the joy and imagination of childhood and treats it as a valuable commodity for all ages.
I:8381;1526;My 3 year old son loves it and watches it repeatedly.
I:8381;1527;disk WIDESCREEN edition is a Disney.
I:8381;1528;release, so chances are (and previous releases in this series are a good indicator) this will have both dubbed and Japanese language tracks.
I:8381;1529;disney has done wonderful job with other Miyazaki films, and I have no doubt this will be the same.
I:8381;1530;this will be the definitive Totoro release, and WELL worth purchasing.
I:8381;1531;You should be *grateful* to Disney for bringing so many wonderful Studio Ghibli films to the U. s. .
I:8381;1532;and they've done an absolutely wonderful job with Kiki and Spirited Away, etc. (and will, I imagine, continue to do so with future releases of this sort).
I:8381;1533;And stop beating up on Disney.
I:8381;1534;The order came in very quickly and it was a very great gift.
I:8381;1535;Our entire family loves this movie and started out Miyazaki film obsession.
I:8381;1536;Although the themes are very Japanese, we were able to enjoy the animation.
I:8381;1537;What a perfect family movie.
I:8381;1538;Whatever version, I think this film is a total gem.
I:8381;1539;So sweet and creative .
I:8381;1540;one of the few movies I will watch with my kids.
I:8381;1541;great music, thought and it's simply visually pleasing too.
I:8381;1542;and he is the one i got it for.
I:8381;1543;it can keep a 4 yr old interested and amused.
I:8381;1544;I'm a big fan of Hayao Miyazaki's movies.
I:8381;1545;Totoro is big loveable friend that comes into play when he is needed.
I:8381;1546;The disc was brand new and delivered on time!
I:8381;1547;The total shopping experience was worth it.
I:8381;1548;i bought this movie along with totoro plush pillow as a childhood memory gift for my bf.
I:8381;1549;I recommend it to anyone who just wants to watch an excellent film, more or less a little masterpiece in its own way.
I:8381;1550;at first, watching the opening few scenes got me thinking that it was going to be a movie strictly aimed towards children, but as the movie progressed, I found it to be touching and full of delight.
I:8381;1551;Also, the movie is just a simple plot about two young girls who befriend a spirit of the forest, Totoro, after moving into a new house.
I:8381;1552;The characters are colorful, charming, and most of all, imaginative.
I:8381;1553;Everything in this movie brings out the wonder of enchantment and belief.You can't enjoy an animated picture without the eye.
I:8381;1554;Miyazaki's trademark use of beautiful vibrant colors are all here.
I:8381;1555;It's just nice to look at.
I:8381;1556;The music adds much, too.
I:8381;1557;The film was scored by Joe Hisiashi, who pretty much scored all of Miyazaki's works.
I:8381;1558;This is one admirable soundtrack.
I:8381;1559;from beginning to end, Totoro is a well.
I:8381;1560;made animated picture that will make you thank yourself you saw a Miyazaki film.
I:8381;1561;This is visual imagination that is Disney.
I:8381;1562;it's such a satisfying film to watch.
I:8381;1563;as the other reviews (obviously from other editions)say, this is a great film.
I:8381;1564;makes me feel good every time I watch it.
I:8381;1565;I love the scenery and the interplay between the charactors.
I:8381;1566;Children in a troubling situation find an amazing powerful magic.
I:8381;1567;animal helperas well as kindly adults and a heartwarming reunion at end.
I:8381;1568;Good to start the kids on Miyazaki films.
I:8381;1569;This movie also entertains the adults as well as the kids.
I:8381;1570;we love this film so much we have watch it over and over, the story, the animation, wonderful film all around
I:8381;1571;"Whimsical and benevolently strange, Miyazaki's ""Totoro"" is one of the finest animated children's tales in memory."
I:8381;1572;Sweeping Japanese landscapes and gorgeous hand.
I:8381;1573;drawn imagery by the director outfit this gentle story, in which two girls find solace in their friendship with a menagerie of affectionate mystical beings.
I:8381;1574;"Neither brash nor saccharine, ""Totoro"" is an imaginative, joyous film the entire clan will enjoy."
I:8381;1575;this movie is so wonderful an so magical i loved this movie a lot it shows real good story plots of how the life of two girls met a forest spirit
I:8381;1576;i try to watch my anime with the Japanese soundtrack as I took it in high.
I:8381;1577;It's a testament to the director and storywriter that 30 somethings can enjoy his films as much as the children that are ostensibly his target.
I:8381;1578;like in this story can be so compelling for adults.
I:8381;1579;As an avid fan of anime I've rarely been moved like I have with Miyazaki's movies and this story was one of his lightest and sweetest.
I:8381;1580;I love the artwork on the forest and rural settings and the attention to detail these films bring.
I:8381;1581;The children are never talked down to and are treated with respect and love at the same time.
I:8381;1582;Once again, highly recommended for all ages.
I:8381;1583;"The little sister Mei discovers nearby the house a large tree that contains special creatures called ""Totoros"" whom are friendly monsters that kids can see and grown."
I:8381;1584;a neat and wonderful animated Japanese fantasy from master animator Hayao Miyazaki with a nifty ecological theme and excellent animation to it.
I:8381;1585;"there's some decent extras like a ""Behind The Microphone Featurette"", Trailers, a full length storyboard presentation of the film and TV Spots."
I:8381;1586;a must have for the animation lover!
I:8381;1587;The animation is not as good as the newest Miyazaki movies, it's definitely a notch below, but my kids loved it.
I:8381;1588;Absolutely loved it, even went out and bought Totoro dolls.
I:8381;1589;i hate it when people praise Miyazaki movies saying they are so great, so artistic, such great plots.
I:8381;1590;that is the highlight of the movie.
I:8381;1591;A wonderful family movie which captivates children of many ages.
I:8381;1592;Miyazaki has proven time and time again that he is, and probably always will be, the greatest animator ever to live.
I:8381;1593;"No animator, not even the ""great"" Walt Disney, can boast such a massive amount of utterly amazing work."
I:8381;1594;FromNausicaa of the Valley of the WindtoSpirited Away, Miyazaki's movies have transcended time to become some of the best works of art ever conceived.
I:8381;1595;No one knows how to tell a story quite like Miyazaki, and he proves it with every movie he makes.
I:8381;1596;Take the characters fromGrave of the Fireflies (Collector's Edition), make them both girls, and place them in a fun, fantasy movie and this is what you get.
I:8381;1597;Totoro is pretty much a lighthearted, fun, and magical Grave of the Fireflies (both movies were made at the same time).
I:8381;1598;The characters are so much alike it's stunning.
I:8381;1599;this is just one of those movies that almost anyone and everyone can enjoy, from a four year old kid to a ninety year old grandma.
I:8381;1600;See this movie, I promise you won't regret it.
I:8381;1601;Without a doubt one of the best animated features ever made, Japan or otherwise, TOTORO is an outstanding original creation from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli.
I:8381;1602;moving with their somewhat scatterbrained but loving father to a new home in the Japanese countryside.
I:8381;1603;A tall, luscious camphor tree towers above the other trees in the back yard.
I:8381;1604;There is even one really BIG Totoro who sleeps under the tree, so cuddlesome and gentle that you'll swear that he's the equivalent of your pet.
I:8381;1605;He lets out thunderous roars, shake the ground by jumping with full force, grins as wide as a Cheshire cat (albeit with warmth and generosity), helps others when they're in trouble, and gives acorns wrapped in bamboo leaves in return for gifts.
I:8381;1606;An emotionally charged subplot involving the sisters' ailing mother (shades of Miyazaki's personal life here) gives TOTORO a dramatic edge.
I:8381;1607;What follows is a tearjerking sequence that builds to a truly happy ending.
I:8381;1608;life situations, emotions, and magical discoveries found in your nearest back yard make TOTORO feel authentic (even with its fantasy elements).
I:8381;1609;"mY NEIGHBOR TOTORO was not a box office success in either Japan or America, but the film has won over millions of children around the world as well as animation buffs for its gorgeous animation style
I:8381;1610;"at first, I was a little worried about hearing Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei, but both ended up captivating me from the start
I:8381;1611;it helps their chemistry come alive.
I:8381;1612;famous role, Ursula from THE LITTLE MERMAID), and Frank Welker, who does outstanding vocal foley for both Totoro and the Cat Bus.
I:8381;1613;"color at times
I:8381;1614;I'm sure that there will be many who will draw comparisons between the two dubs to the very bitter end, but I think it's great to have more than one adaptation of a beloved story, especially when done by folks who obviously love Miyazaki's works.
I:8381;1615;miyazaki's visuals really shine with pristine clarity on the screen, and the Japanese language track features literal subtitles, too.
I:8381;1616;"ups (and those who consider themselves too ""sophisticated"" for cartoons) will enjoy it too."
I:8381;1617;watch this film with your kids, even if you dont normally like Japanese animation (anime) .
I:8381;1618;this one will be enjoyed by everyone.
I:8381;1619;A film about life, simple and deep,full of wonderful lessons .
I:8381;1620;As whimsical and enchanting as I remembered it.
I:8381;1621;One of the first Ghibli movies and the first big break for the studio.
I:8381;1622;Defiantly a classic for fans of Miyazaki's work.
I:8381;1623;But it fills the time well with lovely characters and a memorable soundtrack.
I:8381;1624;I can understand this but keep in mind that sometimes smaller stories can can convey meaning in a way that bigger and flashier ones can not.
I:8381;1625;There's a message to be interpreted here.
I:8381;1626;Although it is still a fantastic dub (especially for 1988), objectively speaking the Disney dub is just as good.
I:8381;1627;i am partial to what I saw first but it really is a matter of preference.
I:8381;1628;I'd love to see that conversation in, say, Pat Robertson's house.
I:8381;1629;This was a great selection for our family.
I:8381;1630;For years and years I have enjoyed the Fox release of this movie.
I:8381;1631;Now I am excited to see Disney is releasing an improved version of Miyazaki's classic with restored visuals, letterbox and the original japanese soundtrack (as well as new dubs even though the old ones weren't bad).
I:8381;1632;I can't recommend this movie enough to anyone who wants to be entertained in a peaceful and magical way.
I:8381;1633;as you can tell from reading the other reviews here, this movie captivates viewers of all ages.
I:8381;1634;Even my mom, who hates most animated movies, thought that Totoro stood out as a great movie.
I:8381;1635;A classic film from a classic director, Hayao Miyazaki deserves all of the accolades he receives and more.
I:8381;1636;My Neighbor Totoro is a film that can be enjoyed by all ages for its pure vision of childhood.
I:8381;1637;The characterizations of the 2 female protagonists are sweet and genuine and it's a pleasure to watch their interactions with Totoro and the other wood spirits.
I:8381;1638;The animation shows great attention to detail and holds up well for its age.
I:8381;1639;i, as with most Japanese animation, encourage it to be viewed with the original Japanese language soundtrack.
I:8381;1640;May is a young girl, who with her family, has moved into a new house.
I:8381;1641;may meets Totoro and becomes friends with the powerful creature.
I:8381;1642;Eventually her sister also meets Totoro and some of the other strange things in the area.
I:8381;1643;The whole community unites to search for her and eventually her sister appeals to Totoro for help.
I:8381;1644;this is a wonderful and magical tale filled with spectacular animation.
I:8381;1645;But aside from that this is a wonderful story that can be enjoyed by all ages.
I:8381;1646;This is exactly what I wanted.
I:8381;1647;I got this movie for my 2 and 4 year old boys.
I:8381;1648;They are a little scared when Totoro roars, but he is ultimately discovered to be a benevolent, helpful and friendly character.
I:8381;1649;"To me this movie hits the balance of dark and light just perfectly
I:8381;1650;The movie is beautiful and imaginative.
I:8381;1651;Highly recommended for very little ones (and imaginative adults too).
I:8381;1652;This is a fun, captivating movie for all ages and beautiful to look at.
I:8381;1653;This movie is super cute and innocent.
I:8381;1654;They're so endearing and lovable!Setting: 3/5 The countryside in Japan.
I:8381;1655;animation: 4/5 Studio Ghibli again lives up to its marvelous reputation.
I:8381;1656;total: 12/20 This is a nice movie.
I:8381;1657;i remarked how cute it was.
I:8381;1658;That was 8.5 years ago and I love him more than ever!
I:8381;1659;Totoro symbolize our relationship and I have a wonderful collection of them all over my room.
I:8381;1660;and I even have a beautiful cloth scroll.
I:8381;1661;: )Totoro is a magical, wonderful movie.
I:8381;1662;it's a beautiful film, the story is classic, the color is lovely, the artwork is delicious, the soundtrack and music is unforgettable, and the ending is so sweet it makes me cry every time.
I:8381;1663;It deserves a special place in every home!
I:8381;1664;years old, I showed her this movie and she loved it (even today).
I:8381;1665;It works well as it adds to the alien atmosphere of the show yet grounds it strongly in the real world.
I:8381;1666;The story is simple, human and relatable for small children, yet deals with serious issues like illness and fear in a mature yet non.
I:8381;1667;who has not agreed it is a wonderful movie for any age audience.
I:8381;1668;It's quite cute in the original language and pretty much lost in translation, so now you know.
I:8381;1669;So refreshing to find a movie that isn't scary but also appropriate for all ages.
I:8381;1670;we love this movie at our house
I:8381;1671;Miyazaki movies will always amaze me with the beautiful story lines and animation.
I:8381;1672;Totoro is a sweet light hearted story that children and adults can appreciate.
I:8381;1673;This movie is absolutely adorable and beautiful.
I:8381;1674;My husband and I find it hard to find movies that are sweet natured and enjoyable for our young daughters, but this one is perfect.
I:8381;1675;"i can't praise this highly enough
I:8381;1676;it's sometimes overlooked in discussions of Miyazaki, but i think it's his best
I:8381;1677;I forgot how amazing this movie is, my nineteen year old sister and I were practically squealing at certain parts.
I:8381;1678;As for the product, it was brand new, in its plastic wrapping and well packaged, as if I just brought it home from the store.
I:8381;1679;It also came in quite a timely fashion (ordered in May).
I:8381;1680;If you want to see a cat in bus form, a large cat.
I:8381;1681;like animal with an umbrella, and rain scenes, watch the heck out of this movie.
I:8381;1682;This movie is very weird but amazing.
I:8381;1683;The entire movie is cute.
I:8381;1684;This movie is a wonderfully animated story of the wonders of childhood!
I:8381;1685;Studio Ghibli has outdone themselves with this classic!
I:8381;1686;i give the story and animation 5 stars as well as the 20th Century Fox version.
I:8381;1687;While this is one of the simpler movies from Miyazaki, it still is one that is fun for all ages.
I:8381;1688;The story revolves around a family that has moved to a new home because of the health of the mother.
I:8381;1689;Totoro helps the two young girls find hope while they wait for their mother to be able to join them.
I:8381;1690;The story thrives on its ability to make the simplest things magical.
I:8381;1691;The girls plant a garden for their mother and want it to grow.
I:8381;1692;The simple dance that they perform over the garden brings tears to both my wife and I each time we see this part.
I:8381;1693;This one, like all of Miyazaki's movies should be watched with your children.
I:8381;1694;Now I get to watch it with my son.
I:8381;1695;It's two sisters having an adventure.
I:8381;1696;The movie really captures childhood well.
I:8381;1697;The next movie I plan on getting him is Ponyo.
I:8381;1698;My children who love this movie are 4 1/2 and 6 1/2.
I:8381;1699;This is most likely their most favorite Studio Ghibli movie.
I:8381;1700;They love how the children interact, and love to see Totoro in all of his glory.
I:8381;1701;"my husband and I liked it from the first viewing
I:8381;1702;And each time we found something intriguing, endearing or something that we had not noticed yet.
I:8381;1703;My husband and I have enjoyed the English subtitles that belong to the Japanese audio immensely, as you get a better idea of what the original intentions were of the film maker (So we use the English Audio with subtitle track 3).
I:8381;1704;I have listened to the Japanese audio, and it's enough.
I:8381;1705;most important about this movie is the story.
I:8381;1706;This is a wonderful family movie.
I:8381;1707;:DI hope you enjoy this movie as much as we did.
I:8381;1708;My favorite childhood movie, and my first anime.
I:8381;1709;The tape works great and even showed up rewound!
I:8381;1710;totoro is a classic children's movie, and one of the best.
I:8381;1711;The story is touching, and the characters endearing.
I:8381;1712;A good example would be when Satsuki offers an umbrella to Totoro, telling him to hurry and take it because her sister (whom she is carrying) is slipping.
I:8381;1713;The entire anime movie is hand drawn.
I:8381;1714;My nieces absolutely love Totoro!
I:8381;1715;Before you look at my review and go its too long and not read it i just want to say I'm a normal person who saw this movie on cartoon network years ago and absolutely loved it.
I:8381;1716;My neighbor totoro IS a great movie, in the original english voice over and if you want to watch it in japanese.
I:8381;1717;The original voices actually sound like voice acting with real emotion.
I:8381;1718;The last time i saw this movie it aired on cartoon network and was heart moving.
I:8381;1719;I bought this movie, super excited to share it with my son.
I:8381;1720;I put it in my PS3 and got excited to sing the intro song.
I:8381;1721;We are moving in next door.
I:8381;1722;It was nice getting to meet you.
I:8381;1723;She loved this movie and even asked to see it again when it was done!
I:8381;1724;year old also loves the movie.
I:8381;1725;The kids just loved it and burst out laughing many times.
I:8381;1726;As an adult, I don't think I would watch it too often but it was enjoyable.
I:8381;1727;I have not seen the Fox version and I found the voice acting fine.
I:8381;1728;I thought that the kids voices were well done, especially the younger girl (Elle Fanning).
I:8381;1729;It was very true to what a 3 or 4.
I:8381;1730;I can't stand the redone version because they changed the dialogue a lot and I didn't find it quite as cute and entertaining.
I:8381;1731;I highly recommend this product.
I:8381;1732;My kids and I love the Japanese movies.
I:8381;1733;We like the delicate works of art, like Totoro.
I:8381;1734;there is a great numbers of beautiful Japanese movies for kids: Ponyo, Kiki's Delivery Service, The Secret World of Arrietty, Castle in the Sky .
I:8381;1735;I watch most of them with my kids 7+ and they love them.
I:8381;1736;They are also complex, like real life.
I:8381;1737;but they still make you dream.
I:8381;1738;First, let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of My Neighbor Totoro and the works of Miyazaki.
I:8381;1739;I will let the other reviews speak to the merits of the film.
I:8381;1740;I want to see the whole movie in its full glory, not cut up to fit our television screen space.
I:8381;1741;Yes, I agree with my fellow reviewers in saying that I think the movie itself is practically perfect, filled with beauty, joy, wonder and hope.
I:8381;1742;Also, my nearly three year old daughter loves this movie as much as I do and watches it over and over with great enthusiasm.
I:8381;1743;great good old Japanese country life and landscape showing.
I:8381;1744;Yet still funny and touchy.
I:8381;1745;Great movie to see with family.
I:8381;1746;Hayao Miyazaki's films are great.
I:8381;1747;This one is the one of best ever.
I:8381;1748;I hope they will translate someday.
I:8381;1749;This adds to my viewing experience
I:8381;1750;This is one of my kids favorite movies.
I:8381;1751;It's great for adults too!
I:8381;1752;I would definitely recommend having this in your movie collection
I:8381;1753;The film is simply great.
I:8381;1754;The 'behind the scenes' special features in this edition were really great to watch.
I:8381;1755;Since the film came out back in the 1980's, it is really nice to get a fresh perspective from the creator and his team.
I:8381;1756;it is a simple, innocent story of a family during (allegedly) the 1950's in Japan.
I:8381;1757;the film is a fantastic story of the sisters discovery of their neighbor 'Totoro', a big furry awesome character that lives 'next door'.
I:8381;1758;they have some great moments and some tremendous adventures.
I:8381;1759;The true story is really about the daughters dealing with the uncertainty of their mothers condition, moving to a new town and dealing with a new school all the while discovering new friendships and dealing with hardship simultaneously.
I:8381;1760;It does a great job of showing just how creative kids are, and also makes you think twice about your own inability to believe in the fantastic as an adult.
I:8381;1761;It perfectly captures the transitional period between being an innocent child and the wonderful discovery of a world that is much more than you ever imagined.
I:8381;1762;the english Voice Overs by the Fanning sisters is superb.
I:8381;1763;It's great front to back, and the extra features were a treat to watch.
I:8381;1764;I'm a fan of Hayao Miyazaki without question, but even a casual viewer will love this film.
I:8381;1765;Do yourself a favor and watch it after the kids go to bed and be transported back in time to when you were in that same impressionable time.
I:8381;1766;"I take issue with folks dressing up ""special edition"" boxes to look like the familiar Blu."
I:8381;1767;Amazing and beautiful, what a treat.
I:8381;1768;i feel kinda stupid gushing so, but this movie has such a great story, with weird, fascinating Japanese spirits and characters, gorgeous and lush animation and if all that wasn't enough, it gives great insight into Japanese rural lifestyle and culture, from a intimate look at country house, to food, to the Japanese family bath, this movie has got it all.
I:8381;1769;a wonderful, refreshing look at family life, a great movie for everyone.
I:8381;1770;The characters, Mei especially, were just so incredibly sincere and likable.
I:8381;1771;I love the fact that the two sisters were so brave and had so much heart.
I:8381;1772;My favorite scene, the bus stop, is just so magical.
I:8381;1773;It's great to finally see a family movie that's truly a FAMILY movie.
I:8381;1774;now don't get me wrong, I love Tarantino flicks too, but Totoro is just about as perfect as it gets when it comes to a perfect family movie.
I:8381;1775;I cried, and considering that I very seldom do this at movies says something.
I:8381;1776;My Neighbor Totoro is one of my children's favorite movies.
I:8381;1777;For me, the animation is detailed and awe some.
I:8381;1778;Mei and Satsuki move into a new home close to the hospital their Mom is in.
I:8381;1779;this is another Miyazaki masterpiece.
I:8381;1780;The characters and the story are amazing.
I:8381;1781;The soundtrack is also incredible.
I:8381;1782;This story is very cute and dramatic.
I:8381;1783;All of the Miyazaki films are legendary.
I:8381;1784;I loved this movie, and it is my #1 favorite.
I:8381;1785;Totoro is nothing short of Amazing, colorful, magical and displays a sense of visual simplicity that engulfs you and mesmerizes any viewer.
I:8381;1786;I more then love this movie.
I:8381;1787;When I heard Disney was going to be releasing Totoro I was excited!
I:8381;1788;Overall better then Disney's portrayal in every way shape and form.
I:8381;1789;one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8381;1790;I love all of Miyazaki's movies, and I wish to obtain them all.
I:8381;1791;Studio Ghibli is simply amazing, I recommend all Miyazaki films.
I:8381;1792;This is my favorite Studio Ghibli film, and therefore my favorite animated feature.
I:8381;1793;absolutely perfect, and recommended for everyone, all ages.
I:8381;1794;I bought this movie in August 2010.
I:8381;1795;This is a children's movie made for children.
I:8381;1796;No adult jokes that children won't get, but still a wonderful movie that deals with adult themes like being responsible for someone else's safety.
I:8381;1797;The 2 sisters in this movie are loving and fun.
I:8381;1798;A very visually beautiful and happy film.
I:8381;1799;My girls were excited when I told them I ordered it.
I:8381;1800;Our family love Totoro so much.
I:8381;1801;And I wanted it in English version too.
I:8381;1802;I will see if we also like this English dubbing.
I:8381;1803;"As will most of Miyazaki's film, ""Totoro"" dances lovingly around the edges of fantasy and reality, as the two sisters develop a friendship with the other."
I:8381;1804;the story to this film is just so sweet.
I:8381;1805;"I babysit for the 2 year old daughter of my best friend, and when it's raining outside, or the world has us a little blue, ""Totoro"" is a movie we both enjoy."
I:8381;1806;Great in its own right, there's NOTHING like watching the face of a young child light up when the cat bus appears.
I:8381;1807;titles (which is how I prefer to watch Japanese films, as with all releases in other languages).
I:8381;1808;i highly recommend this movie .
I:8381;1809;Utterly beautiful, this movie is obviously crafted with love.
I:8381;1810;This has been our entire family's favorite movie ever.
I:8381;1811;I was so upset and disappointed that they messed with such a great movie.
I:8381;1812;My Neighbor Totoro is well worth the money/time to see it.
I:8381;1813;But see the original (english version).
I:8381;1814;and the totoros are wonderful!
I:8381;1815;Totoro is a phenomenal family film.
I:8381;1816;The subtlety of the acting and sheer honesty of the characters is amazing.
I:8381;1817;Miyazaki's ability to hone in on well.
I:8381;1818;"spun ""everyday"" stories is incredible."
I:8381;1819;the fantastic world set up by studio ghibli is breathtakingly simple, and the characters are so real, you could hardly believe they're animated.
I:8381;1820;the dubbed version is quite well done, although some translations are misleading.
I:8381;1821;truly a work of genius.
I:8381;1822;Arrived as described in a timely manner.
I:8381;1823;This seller was great to work with.
I:8381;1824;"acre wood and our walks in it are enhanced by his hopes of seeing a ""Totoro"" under every tree."
I:8381;1825;san is unarguably the greatest genius working in children's animation today, and his visions are both sweet and richly detailed about the complicated relationships between humans and nature, light and dark, love and fear.
I:8381;1826;There are some loud noises, but otherwise it's totally suitable for small children.
I:8381;1827;Kids over 4 or 5 might feel some concern for Satsuki's fears about her mother, but those are put into a warm and reassuring context.
I:8381;1828;The Catbus is, without a doubt, the single most enchanting creation in animation.
I:8381;1829;But this style did not suit this particular film.
I:8381;1830;Such a great movie recieved it in a quick and timely manor.
I:8381;1831;I am so thankful to have this movie now its an amazing film and one of my favorite childhood movies!
I:8381;1832;I recommend purchasing this movie and watching it with your children.
I:8381;1833;This was a gift for my 3 daughters, they were asking for Totoro items for Christmas this year.
I:8381;1834;I had never heard of Totoro but when I started to look into it to learn more about it I found the movie.
I:8381;1835;I read the reviews and found that most people really enjoyed it.
I:8381;1836;Like those people, I too thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
I:8381;1837;It was a sweet story and my girls loved it too :)
I:8381;1838;My two young daughters really liked this sweet movie.
I:8381;1839;There were some really inventive scenes featuring giant forest spirits and cat buses (?!)
I:8381;1840;It was so well done that I would even watch it by myself if I had the time!
I:8381;1841;Be you young or old, this film will grab you and pull it into its wonderful world in about thirty seconds flat.
I:8381;1842;Disney, as wonderful as they are, could learn much from this film.
I:8381;1843;The character development is far superior to most Disney flicks, but what really distinguishes this film is how imaginative it is.
I:8381;1844;The bus stop scene is five of the most enchanting and beautiful mintutes of film I have ever seen.
I:8381;1845;This movie is a treasure.
I:8381;1846;Nobody portrays children better than Miyazaki.
I:8381;1847;I laughed at the little characters bobbing through the garden.
I:8381;1848;On the one hand, this is truly one of the great animated classics of our time, a fun, beautiful, and imaginative story, sure to be enjoyed by children from pre.
I:8381;1849;It's a really good match to have both Dakota and Elle Fanning in it.
I:8381;1850;This magical tale is full of adventure and fun!
I:8381;1851;This movie is for the whole family to enjoy!
I:8381;1852;Everyone will like it, probably!
I:8381;1853;Enter the excitment by watching this great movie!
I:8381;1854;See you at the end of the rainbow of magic!
I:8381;1855;This movie is so entertaining for my pre.
I:8381;1856;schooler, and I enjoy it, too.
I:8381;1857;Beautiful animation, magical setting, and nice story.
I:8381;1858;A friend of mine let us borrow this movie.
I:8381;1859;It's a favorite of her 3 year old daughter.
I:8381;1860;My 3 kids LOVED it.
I:8381;1861;My son loved it so much he asked me to write this review for him.
I:8381;1862;I grew up watching Totoro with my Grandma and watching it in all its original glory was special because she has since passed and it brought back the memories of spending time with her at her house .
I:8381;1863;I really dislike the new dub.
I:8381;1864;It is an amazing piece of film with a great story and having not seen it you won't have anything to judge it against.
I:8381;1865;I absolutely love this video!
I:8381;1866;I watched it a million times as a kid, and it is still just as good.
I:8381;1867;I would highly recommend it, and all of the other movies by this director.
I:8381;1868;I thoroughly enjoy this movie.
I:8381;1869;My Neighbor Totoro is so inventive and inspiring with lots of detail and exquisite animation.
I:8381;1870;It really has great imagination and colorful characters.
I:8381;1871;I love the story line and the amazing beautiful work that the art director did.
I:8381;1872;Grab it for the family.
I:8381;1873;My Neighbor Totoro is one of the greatest animated films ever produced (for children or otherwise).
I:8381;1874;It is a film that devoted fans such as myself love sharing with children and friends (I even teach it in my Children's Literature class.)
I:8381;1875;the delicacy of Hayao Miyazaki's tale of two young girls who must cope with the stresses of moving to a new house, neighborhood and school.
I:8381;1876;told through delightful and surprising events and beautiful animation.
I:8381;1877;That the girls need the friendship and support of their father, the neighbors and the Totoros (friendly nature spirits) is subtly presented and then heroically answered through Miyazaki's unforgettable imagery.
I:8381;1878;My 3 year old and 7 year old absolutely love this movie.
I:8381;1879;I, however, find the overall story fine with the Totoro friendship quite odd.
I:8381;1880;"Try ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" for a movie that kids and adults will love."
I:8381;1881;This is a quiet, simple film that will subtly stir your emotions and memorize you.
I:8381;1882;"The artwork is deceptively amazing
I:8381;1883;It's just about a nice family that encounter a little magic in their life.
I:8381;1884;And since the plot is simple, it works really well with English dubbing.
I:8381;1885;"If you liked Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", you will love ""Totoro""."
I:8381;1886;this movie helps you remember.
I:8381;1887;I am a grandma, and I love it.
I:8381;1888;That said, I *heart* Totoro.
I:8381;1889;This film almost doesn't need the subtitles, the animation and emotion of the characters is so strong, it translates.
I:8381;1890;It's a tale of love and magic and nature and full of the wonderment of childhood.
I:8381;1891;I bought this years ago and I'm just now writing a review.
I:8381;1892;This is a must see, really good for the whole family.
I:8381;1893;My 2 year old and my 9 yr old both love it, as do we.
I:8381;1894;A great example is when Satsuke is waiting with Totoro for the bus.
I:8381;1895;My Neighbor Totoro is a film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, and it was released in Japan in 1988.
I:8381;1896;the film tells the story of two girls and their father, and their move into a new house in order to be closer to the girls' mother (who is sick and in this hospital).
I:8381;1897;while the film clocks in at under 90 minutes, it's stil la very enjoyable film.
I:8381;1898;This is a very family.
I:8381;1899;friendly anime film, and I would highly recommend it.
I:8381;1900;While I'm a little disappointed in the special features, I still enjoy the story and the film itself.
I:8381;1901;It was the same wonderful visuals as I remember, but with the Fanning sisters and other American actors doing the voices.
I:8381;1902;I love this anime and am waiting for the Disney/Buena Vista release for the Japanese language version.
I:8381;1903;I lived in Japan during the early 1960s, so much in the film reflects the country I knew as a child.
I:8381;1904;I will often watch the anime just to remember back to my childhood and the Japan I remember.
I:8381;1905;Our whole family loves this movie.
I:8381;1906;My 16 month old twins clap their hands and dance to the music and laugh.
I:8381;1907;I now prefer the Disney version, but this was a great substitute for years until Disney negotiated to produce the English.
I:8381;1908;This film has been a favorite in our family since my children were very young.
I:8381;1909;They even loved it in Japanese (even though they couldn't understand it) before this English version was released!
I:8381;1910;Instead, it offers delightful characters and imaginative creatures in an original story that also introduces children to aspects of the Japanese culture.
I:8381;1911;And of course there's the beautiful animation.
I:8381;1912;Hayao Miyazaki is a favorite of mine, and this is his best film for children.
I:8381;1913;We loved Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service was sweetly enjoyable, and because this is another highly.
I:8381;1914;rated Miyazaki film, we bought My Neighbor Totoro.
I:8381;1915;(Nothing against Pokemon, we enjoyed that series.)
I:8381;1916;In Spirited Away, we believe that this world could exist, the story slowly unfolds with questions answered as we go, the characters are developed so we want to know them, and actually care about them.
I:8381;1917;I give this 2 stars only for the lovely animation, which is truly beautiful.
I:8381;1918;Film is another animation gem by critically acclaimed director Hayao Miyazaki.
I:8381;1919;little ones will absolutely love this film, and adults as well!
I:8381;1920;it well make us reflect on when we were little with inquisitive, imaginative brains, along with optimistic spirits as we grew exploring the mysteries of life.
I:8381;1921;definitely one of my favorites that I will watch again and again.
I:8381;1922;And when I have children they will watch this as well.
I:8381;1923;i hope to one day travel to Japan and explore the real forest of Totoro.
I:8381;1924;^^ lolI highly recommend this film to anyone who has children.
I:8381;1925;i highly recommend the film and the seller.
I:8381;1926;thanks, and God bless ^^
I:8381;1927;I've watched this a few times now and to me it is amazingly imaginative.
I:8381;1928;It will capture the hearts and minds of all children and adults if they care to give up the stuggles of every day life for a short time.
I:8381;1929;Great movie and I really really enoyed it.
I:8381;1930;My Neighbor Totoro is one of the most beautifully animated movies I have ever seen.
I:8381;1931;Kids of all ages will enjoy it, for the wonderful story and for the exquisite animated scenery.
I:8381;1932;Miyazaki is truly a master of anime.
I:8381;1933;The voice characterization is MUCH better than the dubbed English version!
I:8381;1934;She reluctantly agreed and it became my FAVORITE toy.
I:8381;1935;She is two, and she also loves it.
I:8381;1936;This movie is so sweet, inventive and one of a kind.
I:8381;1937;The drawings are beautiful and there's nothing formulaic about the story or characters.
I:8381;1938;Love this as an alternative to Disney's princess extravaganza.
I:8381;1939;I just love all of Miyazaki's work.
I:8381;1940;The magical creatures are cute and fuzzy.
I:8381;1941;See Kiki's Delivery Service as well.
I:8381;1942;She wanted the older original version, so this product was perfect.
I:8381;1943;Great price, fast shipping she was very happy!
I:8381;1944;I love this movie, I even have the stuffed Totoro animals.
I:8381;1945;The story is very well written and the animation is superb.
I:8381;1946;I love this movie so very much!
I:8381;1947;I have to say that Totoro is one of my favorite childhood movies, ever, and I still love it as an adult.
I:8381;1948;Japanese animated filmaker Hayao Miyazaki has a deep and abiding love of nature, and of the Japanese Shinto spirits who live deep in the forest.
I:8381;1949;Miyazaki shares this love in this wonderful film about two young girls who go to live with their father in a country house in rural Japan, far removed from the city lights of Tokyo.
I:8381;1950;one of Miyazaki's gifts is how he captures the mannerisms of children, especially little girls.
I:8381;1951;the new house and new neighbors provide many adventures for the girls, who soon discover the friendly and magical Shinto spirits who dwell in the nearby woods.
I:8381;1952;tale, the spirits, who would normally be hidden, respond to the girl's kindness.
I:8381;1953;One especially memorable scene happens when the girls are waiting at the rural bus stop for their father to come home from visiting his wife.
I:8381;1954;from a summer sky suddenly dark and about to burst with rain, to a slow setting of the sun, the animation in Totoro is amazing in it's simplicity.
I:8381;1955;The quiet nature scenes are extremely relaxing for adults, who will become nostalgic for their childhood while viewing this classic.
I:8381;1956;one scene is deeply moving and speaks of the bonds that can form between people who aren't even related.
I:8381;1957;This scene, and the climactic ending, will touch your heart.
I:8381;1958;Our family loves this movie.
I:8381;1959;"Even though the ""baby"" of our family is turning ten, all of us still watch the movie together."
I:8381;1960;Anybody with small children between the ages of 3 and 8 should get this one.
I:8381;1961;My daughter made drawings of the cat bus with all of us inside.
I:8381;1962;The other movies we love are Spirited Away and Kiki's Devilery Service.
I:8381;1963;Made a great gift for an 8.
I:8381;1964;This one has a bit longer bathing scene than the other one.
I:8381;1965;My daughter is a big fan of these movies.
I:8381;1966;She was very excited and it was one of the best prices I have seen for them.
I:8381;1967;My children and I have watched this movie literally a hundred times and we absolutely love it.
I:8381;1968;This is a delightful, gentle, beautiful movie.
I:8381;1969;Fun for me and my children.
I:8381;1970;This is the first movie I saw by this director and I was in elementary school at the time.
I:8381;1971;I was taken away by the scenery, magic, and the life.
I:8381;1972;After this movie, I wanted to see more movies like this.
I:8381;1973;I liked a lot of animated movies in elementary school, but others didn't compare to it and it immediately became my top favorite movie.
I:8381;1974;I'm glad there are other movies by this director that are just as great.
I:8381;1975;Warm characters and imaginative creatures.
I:8381;1976;Every picture is detailed and unique in it's view.
I:8381;1977;A lot of the dialogue had been substantially changed, or dumbed down, and the movie lost a lot of its original charm.
I:8381;1978;I have an older version on VHS and I just love it!
I:8381;1979;One for the regular film and the other was the entire soundtrack with story boarded pictures.
I:8381;1980;I found the dialog in English beautiful and well done.
I:8381;1981;A man and his two daughters move to the country in a new house while the mother is hospitalized.
I:8381;1982;Beautiful moving story with lots of hope.
I:8381;1983;very nice to have little girls as the primary characters.
I:8381;1984;The magical world and characters that the girls discover at their summer home is a great connection to the imaginary play that I see in the younger children.
I:8381;1985;The thing I love the most about this movie are the strong female characters.
I:8381;1986;The girls are brave, independant, curious, imaginative, and delightful.
I:8381;1987;very delightful movie and great for young children to watch!
I:8381;1988;The Disney release of My Neighbor Totoro is great!
I:8381;1989;This is a great movie, and the right version (not the new one with the Fanning sisters).
I:8381;1990;this is a super fun movie with a unique story line and interesting characters.
I:8381;1991;my kids love the movie and soundtrack.
I:8381;1992;I now know that Disney got their grubby hands on a beloved classic, and disgustingly re.
I:8381;1993;That Fox chose to treat 'My Neighbor Totoro' as a children's film, fitting it into the television aspect ratio and providing dubbing that was aimed at that audience, will displease some purists.
I:8381;1994;Part of writer/director Hayao Miyazaki's brilliance is in not turning this into a tragic story or morbid story.
I:8381;1995;Instead, we see the children's excitement in their new home, and the close affection that interpenetrates their family life.
I:8381;1996;This helps us to keep focused on the children's strength, rather than any sense of impending doom.
I:8381;1997;The Totoro is magic at its best, soft enough to sleep on, able to fly about the forest, grow giant trees and summon a cat bus that will always take you where you need to go.
I:8381;1998;For the two children, the Totoro and its other spirit friends are the creatures that shout love, the powers that keep things from falling apart.
I:8381;1999;the film is quite honest about the feelings of these children as they cope with their own fears for their mother.
I:8381;2000;It is rare that a film speaks genuinely for children in this predicament, and attempts to set an effective coping model.
I:8381;2001;It lifts the story to the level where it has something important to say to such children without making it the least bit preachy.
I:8381;2002;Perhaps the real message isn't about Totoro's that live in trees, but the Totoro's that live in our hearts and the hearts of our friends.
I:8381;2003;you missed the point and the magic in this perfectly human and gentle film.
I:8381;2004;I agree with my daughter: Totoro is really nice.
I:8381;2005;Totero is a beautiful film with a story easily followed by a four year old child.
I:8381;2006;Gentle, magical view of the world and a great reminder to value the natural environment.
I:8381;2007;My children ages 3 and 4 enjoyed this movie from start to finish.
I:8381;2008;This movie helped him realize that big isn't always scary and that he and his sister could enjoy something together.
I:8381;2009;It is a magical movie and I recommend it for young children everywhere.
I:8381;2010;I've loved this movie ever since I was a little girl.
I:8381;2011;It's an amazing tale that is comprised of love, adventure, and the fantasy world.
I:8381;2012;I was so happy when I bought it.
I:8381;2013;I loved this anime very much.
I:8381;2014;It brought a magical feeling back to me that I had not felt since childhood.
I:8381;2015;I was intrigued by the story and the realistic depictions of the children.
I:8381;2016;Totoro was frightening and uplifting at the same time.
I:8381;2017;This anime is a must for anime fans.
I:8381;2018;It's fun, funny, and full of whimsical adventures.
I:8381;2019;This is an Awesome movie for all ages.
I:8381;2020;love it and love this movie.
I:8381;2021;I will always be a favorite of mine.
I:8381;2022;another credit for the studio that made it.
I:8381;2023;A good example of family love and cooperation.
I:8381;2024;She asks to see it nearly every time she visits and I usually watch it with her.
I:8381;2025;We both love it and have recommended it to many friends.
I:8381;2026;This movie was funny and a little sad.
I:8381;2027;Director Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli always do a fantastic job.
I:8381;2028;The detail in the graphics is supurb, the storyline is captivating, and the insight into Japanese lifestyle of that era is fascinating.
I:8381;2029;Her mother said that they both were glued to the TV during the entire viewing, and it's definitely going to be one they'll be enjoying again and again.
I:8381;2030;All the positives that the other reviewers mentioned are accurate.
I:8381;2031;I'd recommend it for all ages.
I:8381;2032;Beautifully done with a good lesson.
I:8381;2033;They all love this movie!
I:8381;2034;I think it is a creative and original movie with beautiful animation.
I:8381;2035;I was incredibly pleased to hear that Totoro was finally getting a widescreen 2.
I:8381;2036;disc edition and the recognition it deserves.
I:8381;2037;Like I said before I love all the other Disney dubs of Miyazaki's films.
I:8381;2038;nausicaa is amazing, Whisper of the Heart.
I:8381;2039;incredible, and Howl's Moving Castle is the one of the best english dubs I've ever heard as Christian Bale was incredible as Howl.
I:8381;2040;one I will cherish forever as I watch it every couple of weeks and I'm 22.
I:8381;2041;"No other ""American"" animated film shows human emotion and family values as good as this one does."
I:8381;2042;I loved this movie when I was a kid, when I found it on amazon I was so excited and couldn't wait until it came in.
I:8381;2043;I greatly disliked the dubbed voices!
I:8381;2044;This is a wonderful movie.
I:8381;2045;i really love the hand drawn images.
I:8381;2046;This movie really brings out the fantasy aspect in children, and is a true classic.
I:8381;2047;One of my favorite movies to watch with the kids.
I:8381;2048;The kids always love Totoro and the cat bus.
I:8381;2049;My Neighbor Totoro is one of those rare films that defies easy catagorization.
I:8381;2050;teens, Miyazaki manages to bring the rest of us along for this pure, fantasy adventure.
I:8381;2051;"While I believe ""Spirited Away"" is his best work, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is certainly his most iconic and perhaps most loved."
I:8381;2052;i'll leave the joys of the film itself for you to discover as I will focus my review on the presentation and contents of this two.
I:8381;2053;"ray"" version as well like Miyazaki's latest movie ""Ponyo""."
I:8381;2054;Considering the sumptuos visions of bright, blue skies above lush trees, I would think a Blu.
I:8381;2055;"ray edition.You can choose to listen to the original Japanese language, but the ""English"" version featuring the Fanning sisters (Dakota and Elle) with Tim Daly (""Wings"") works well."
I:8381;2056;disc Two contains the special feature.
I:8381;2057;"Several videos documenting the creation of ""My Neighbor Totoro"" through the ""Behind the Microphone"" section featuring the aforementioned American actors are well produced and informative."
I:8381;2058;A wonderful touch for those especially interested in the process of animation.
I:8381;2059;"Enter the Lands allows you to access the ""worlds"" of four Miyazaki films, ""Totoro"", ""Ponyo"", Kiki's Delivery Service"" and ""Castle in the Sky""."
I:8381;2060;"While the others feature all their main characters in a ""promotional"" kind of way."
I:8381;2061;Princess Mononoke was the first Miyazaki movie I'd seen, and is perhaps my favorite (close call between it at Spirited Away).
I:8381;2062;But having come to the director by way of a film rivaling the best of Kurasawa in its epic scale, its always refreshing to see how Miyazaki is able to excel in telling more intimate (yet still magical and fantastical) stories of children learning to accept the adult responsibilities that come with growing up.
I:8381;2063;The plot is straightforward enough: Two young girls explore their new home, discovering the enchanted creatures that share the house and the encircling forests, while waiting for their mother to recover from her illness and be discharged from the hospital.
I:8381;2064;The children live their life in their enchanted new land, but they also think of their mother and anxiously await her return.
I:8381;2065;miyazaki of course includes the magical creatures and fantasy one expects from him, but ultimately his goal is just to tell a simple story, capturing emotions all children can relate to on some level.
I:8381;2066;"Of course, My Neighbor Totoro has spirits and magical catbuses and all, but they don't rate much screen time
I:8381;2067;The totoros are cute, and the catbus is amusing, though a little creepy.
I:8381;2068;I just think this is one case where the film is aimed at children, and they primarily will enjoy it.
I:8381;2069;Rather than big guns and good guys vs bad guys, this is a sweet and poignant movie with just the right amount of sentimentality and magic, and overall is a wonderful, fuzzy movie (literally and figuratively)The cat.
I:8381;2070;awaited release is well worth owning.
I:8381;2071;Even if only for the opportunity to view this classic film as it should always be presented: in true widescreen.
I:8381;2072;Odd that some of the credits are subtitled, but the most entertaining aspect.
I:8381;2073;Even the most sympathetically created dubbing inevitably obscures the intonation and emotional nuances created by the actors, guided by the director: these are (at least) as important to the rendering of character as the visuals.
I:8381;2074;only those fluent in Japanese are capable of fully comprehending every aspect of the work.
I:8381;2075;The more choices, the better.
I:8381;2076;it rankles, a bit, to read the back.
I:8381;2077;"one of the most delightful and charming family films ever."""
I:8381;2078;This is one of the best films ever.
I:8381;2079;my Neighbor Totoro is a small gem.
I:8381;2080;"reflecting the wondrous ""everything is new"" experience of childhood."
I:8381;2081;Evocative of Japanese rural life and simple everyday pleasures.
I:8381;2082;The world of the film is suffused with a Shinto.
I:8381;2083;inspired sense of the consciousness of all things, of joyful respect for 'kami'.
I:8381;2084;Everything is alive: in both the material and spiritual realms.
I:8381;2085;for the day they are certain will come, inevitably.
I:8381;2086;Immersed in a corporate culture which insists Disney is synonymous with feature.
I:8381;2087;She's from China, and she had been asking for the movie in Mandarin for months, and I was excited to find one on Amazon with such positive reviews.
I:8381;2088;In that version, the voices were spoken in English by actual oriental people, and I have to say, the dialogue was much better and funnier.
I:8381;2089;I absolutely love this film.
I:8381;2090;I recommend this to everone I know.
I:8381;2091;I do like the restored visuals.
I:8381;2092;It has made a beutiful animation stunning!Highly recommend this one!
I:8381;2093;Totoro is, unreservedly, the best movie for kids (and among the best for adults) that I have ever seen.
I:8381;2094;The cornerstone of it's success, in my mind, is respect.
I:8381;2095;Respect for adults, for children, for nature and for the mystery of living.
I:8381;2096;My Neighbor Totoro demonstrates that respect can be entertaining .
I:8381;2097;"i used to recommend ""Totoro"" pretty routinely to just about every customer at the video store I worked at in the early 90s and the movie enchanted each of them ."
I:8381;2098;"But they loved this ""kids"" movie."
I:8381;2099;(It actually became a fairly popular date movie for college students.)
I:8381;2100;"I bought a copy for my daughter before she was born and it has been one of her favorites since about age two
I:8381;2101;This is a great movie like all Gibli anime filmes, perfect for both child and adult alike.
I:8381;2102;All the Japanese released Gibli movies have both along with lots of extra stuff like original drawings and documentaries.
I:8381;2103;As long as you have subtitles the original Japanese is much better and fits in with Gibli's characters better than the English.
I:8381;2104;Of course it is good to have the dubbed version for kids.
I:8381;2105;My neighbor Totoro is an animated feature for all ages.
I:8381;2106;The high level of detail in the animation extends to both the characters and their surroundings.
I:8381;2107;Each frame of the animation is like a piece of artwork.
I:8381;2108;You see shadows on the walls and floors and in the water you see ripples and reflections.
I:8381;2109;The artwork and attention to detail all add to the realism of the story.
I:8381;2110;the story line is simple enough for younger children to follow and yet has elements to keep grownups interested.
I:8381;2111;It's a nice family story with a few fantastical characters like the Soot sprites and the forest spirits.
I:8381;2112;It's a fresh wholesome and upbeat story with no villains or protagonists, family fun at its best.
I:8381;2113;It is a true classic.
I:8381;2114;For those of you who have not bought any of the 2003 releases of the Ghibli films (Castle in the Sky, Kiki's Delivery Service, Sprited Away) that Disney has done, go and do so.
I:8381;2115;They are Meticulus with the subtitled versions (But that just might be Gibli's doing) and the extra features that are invloved Might Make it worth the (.)
I:8381;2116;any of the Ghibli films are a great way to get some you know to watch anime Because the plots are that well thought out.
I:8381;2117;the two sisters, voiced by Dakota Fanning and Elle Fanning, really bring warmth and heart to the story.
I:8381;2118;The spirits who live near the house are friendly and kind to the girls.
I:8381;2119;But there is also, besides joy and wonder, great sadness in many parts of the film.
I:8381;2120;Probably one of his best movies.
I:8381;2121;My 4 year old boy absolutely loves this movie and so do I. if you have already seen the movie and want to know about the girl on the cover or have other questions, I recommend reading this FAQ page: [.]
I:8381;2122;his cousins love it too!
I:8381;2123;they even bought this as presents for their teen friends.
I:8381;2124;translation: be forwarned, though a wonderful film, the original technical specs for this film include an aspect ration of 1.85:1, however, this is the pan.
I:8381;2125;youand your kids are gauranteed to love it.
I:8381;2126;With an excellent story and both original music and some familiar songs from Princess Mononoke, it is a genuine 5 star kids movie that will warm the hearts of everyones inner.
I:8381;2127;As an exchange student to Japan, I saw Totoro in Japanese years ago and loved it.
I:8381;2128;It is one of those shows that children adore.
I:8381;2129;My husband and I enjoy sitting next to them and being a part of the magic.
I:8381;2130;They love watching Mei land on Totoro's chest, and the cat bus is fantastic.
I:8381;2131;she makes lunches for the family and holds Mei at the bus stop.
I:8381;2132;Come on, one of the greatest anime movies of all time, and you people DUB it?
I:8381;2133;Animation by Hayao Miyazaki and one of my favorite!
I:8381;2134;This is a story about Totoro, the spirit of forest and little sisters living near.
I:8381;2135;The background is a Japanese local village in late 50s, where still beautiful forest is reserved.
I:8381;2136;It recalls my childhood in rural town.
I:8381;2137;With many fantastic and impressional scenes.
I:8381;2138;"and the girls discover they are neighbors to magical ""trolls""."
I:8381;2139;They learn the wonders of their new environs with the Totoros and they get a happy ending regarding their family situation, but in a way that will make you both smile and get moist in the eyes.
I:8381;2140;It's what the writer/director/artists do with this simple premise that adds up to soooooooooo much more.
I:8381;2141;this film taps into the warmest, most human, most loving, gentlest, dreamiest bits of my young self that still hides inside my middle.
I:8381;2142;It's hardly an issue in light of the amazing animation (just watch the girls, the little things, the details, that so absolutely prove that the artist(s) have observed young kids very, very carefully), the playfulness, the delights of the Totoros (I can't watch Chibi Totoro and not giggle.
I:8381;2143;The scene with Mei on Big Totoro's furry tummy is pure perfection.
I:8381;2144;The gorgeous bonding the ensues.
I:8381;2145;and the scene at the bus stop/catbus stop: Wow.
I:8381;2146;The hilarity of O Totoro and his leaf hat.
I:8381;2147;The joy of raindrops on an umbrella.
I:8381;2148;The sweetness of sleepy Mei and the unselfishness and kindness of Satsuki.
I:8381;2149;Who wouldn't want to be five or six again and ride on a Totoro's tummy through a moonlit night, over rice fields and camphor trees?If you have high BP, this movie will settle it down, it's such a bit of grace pouring on you.
I:8381;2150;If you want something beautiful that fills you with a sense of nostalgia: This is it.
I:8381;2151;disney version: Better than no Totoro.
I:8381;2152;it borders on sacrelige for those of us that love totoro.
I:8381;2153;I've been a fan of Miyazaki's work for life time.
I:8381;2154;almost every 5 minute it hits you with some of the most charming background music I've ever heard, for some reason it does really enhance the mood to a bizzare level.
I:8381;2155;You just want it keep going and going, and smile while watching.
I:8381;2156;This took me by surprise, I smiled when I heard it, but from the bottom of my heart, they did it good, good enough I would actually think it's the japanese singer singing in English language.
I:8381;2157;Highway sweet, can only call the songs that.
I:8381;2158;I've watched all the Miyazaki's work, this title pretty much still stands at the top 4 in my book even to compare to all of them.
I:8381;2159;this is a true treasure.
I:8381;2160;The characters are compelling enough to hold the kids attention.
I:8381;2161;Sometimes the subtitles are not perfect either, but you can get a sense of the emotional range of the characters, even if you don't understand the language.
I:8381;2162;Even with the flaws this is an entertaining movie for all ages.
I:8381;2163;Disney has done a beautiful job on Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service and Castle in the Sky.
I:8381;2164;"In case you do not already know, this is one of the great animated family movies of all time, another gem by the Japanese master Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli (maker of ""Kiki's Delivery Service"")."
I:8381;2165;There's no conflict driven plot, no good versus evil struggle, just a tale of discovery and wonder, and genuine emotion.
I:8381;2166;but like real life .
I:8381;2167;Rather than the audience being told what to think, and how to feel, Miyazaki lets us follow along while the two children discover and then befriend an amazing magical creature (Totoro) living in the enormous tree next door, a symbolic representation of both nature and the power of childhood imagination.
I:8381;2168;Highly recommended for ages 6 through 60.
I:8381;2169;This absolutely lovely video combines a fairy tale and a heartwarming family saga.
I:8381;2170;Whimsical is an excellent word for it.
I:8381;2171;is remarkable and visually captivating.
I:8381;2172;The characters are lovely and endearing.
I:8381;2173;The creatures are gentle, fun, and comforting.
I:8381;2174;hood because it's a movie that any little kid would love.
I:8381;2175;"The portrayal of the children is magical
I:8381;2176;"it's also a wonderful story
I:8381;2177;A friend suggested this movie, plus Kiki's delivery service, and these moveis are a breath of fresh air.
I:8381;2178;Product received in excellent condition.
I:8381;2179;This is a fun movie for all ages.
I:8381;2180;Glad I have the original version again!
I:8381;2181;This was my second delving into Miyazaki after Spirited Away, and while Spirited Away was the superior film, this was still a very enjoyable movie.
I:8381;2182;This film excels most as a story for small children, one of the best children's movies I have ever seen, in fact.
I:8381;2183;While the plot may be to simple for adults, it's still charming, and absolutely perfect for children.
I:8381;2184;The actual film is very visually apealling and doesn't have the garish, cartoony look of the cover art.
I:8381;2185;This is a wonderful movie for children.
I:8381;2186;This version by Fox has the original voice actors, not the disney voice, and sounds great.
I:8381;2187;I really love the hand drawn images.
I:8381;2188;This movie really brings out the fantasy aspect in children, and is a true classic.
I:8381;2189;The animation in this production is superb, a great example of classic animation where detail is not ignored.
I:8381;2190;Views like beautiful cinematography as much as animation, with great colors and illustrations.
I:8381;2191;And the actual composition and framing is so nicely done, again, like a well made film rather than the standard animation.
I:8381;2192;And the story itself is charming, interesting, and like a good fable, as well documented in so many other reviews.
I:8381;2193;Fun for the whole family, adults on down to my preschooler.
I:8381;2194;We'll view it many more times, I'm sure!
I:8381;2195;Her Mom and Dad and big sister are also thrilled for her.
I:8381;2196;both my 4 year old and 13 year old love this movie.
I:8381;2197;i myself is a big fan of old animation.
I:8381;2198;so that with a great story line, love it!
I:8381;2199;I would recommend purchasing an older version to pay tribute to such an excellent film.
I:8381;2200;I bought this after reviews said it was good for even the most sensitive children.
I:8381;2201;She was up 2 times that night saying that she was scared of Totoro.
I:8381;2202;"This animated feature follows ten year old Satsuki and her four year old sister Mei on their adventure in the Japanese countryside and encounter with the Lord of the Forest, the giant but very cute Totoro.You can read the other reviews to find out more about the plot
I:8381;2203;the animation, like all of Miyazaki's movies, is first rate.
I:8381;2204;The movie flows so much better that way and you get nuances that are bludgeoned by the English dubbing job.
I:8381;2205;They don't act precocious, they don't act bratty, they aren't made to be overly cute or lovable, they are simply made to be real and believable.
I:8381;2206;All in all, this is a charming story with excellent production values, and I am thankful that someone released it in its original aspect ratio with the original language and soundtrack.
I:8381;2207;Only this version does this great movie justice.
I:8381;2208;My Neighbor Totoro is one of the best movies ever!
I:8381;2209;Great story, beautiful animation, excellent voice cast (if you have the original).
I:8381;2210;If you must watch it watch the original.
I:8381;2211;This film evokes the magical world of young children better than any other I've seen.
I:8381;2212;on.21 daughter still finds it enthralling.
I:8381;2213;There's lots of reviews about what a great family movie Totoro is.
I:8381;2214;I'm in the middle of a divorce right now and watch it with my 3 year old almost every night.
I:8381;2215;The fact that the two girls are living with just their dad and the mom lives some place else is a great opportunity for us to talk about things and help him understand that what's going on in his life isn't unique.
I:8381;2216;This item was delivered fast and in great condition.
I:8381;2217;My son is a Disney fanatic.
I:8381;2218;Great movie, with lots of special features.
I:8381;2219;It's the best one, followed closely by Spirited Away.
I:8381;2220;This is such a fun and endearing movie.
I:8381;2221;My whole family loves it and we watch it often.
I:8381;2222;It's very whimsical, and a lovely story.
I:8381;2223;This is our most favorite Studio Ghibli film.
I:8381;2224;We like all of them but this one is the most imaginative, light.
I:8381;2225;hearted and whimsical to us as a family.
I:8381;2226;Some of this directors films have more mature themes (like Howl's Moving Castle or Pincess Mononoki for example), but this one I feel can be seen by all ages!
I:8381;2227;This is a great movie for most kids.
I:8381;2228;This movie is either your child will love it and think it is the most amazing and magical thing in the world or they will cry and be scared of it.
I:8381;2229;She believes thoroughly that Totoros truly exist.
I:8381;2230;Totoros are magical kami/sprite beings that perhaps only children (and adults who believe) can see.
I:8381;2231;My daughter has seen Totoros (especially the big gray one, the Totoro ) and they live for her moreso than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny.
I:8381;2232;See it and it will change you!
I:8381;2233;The characters are adorable, and the story is really unforgettable.
I:8381;2234;ray makes it look much nicer!
I:8381;2235;Although it is not listed, Fox has released a full screen version of Miyizaki's masterpiece.
I:8381;2236;my Neighbor Totoro is possibly my favorite animated film and it deserves better than this.
I:8381;2237;Totoro is a great family film, but even I enjoy it without the kids.
I:8381;2238;Beautiful, stunning animation makes this film a piece of art in itself.
I:8381;2239;The characters are entertaining, the story keeps you interested.
I:8381;2240;old's favorite movies, it is sweet, funny, with people doing good things because they want to.
I:8381;2241;The dialogue gets a little stilted and formal, but this is 1950's Japan, so it actually works fine.
I:8381;2242;i always find it fascinating to watch the English dub while the literal translation track runs on subtitles.
I:8381;2243;i recommend an excellent direct translation of the Japanese dialogue at www2.
I:8381;2244;This is my personal favorite film from one of the greatest animation directors of all time.
I:8381;2245;The wonderufl magical simplicity of two girls who move to a new home and discover magical beings living in and around it is perfectly captured imagination.
I:8381;2246;The English dub on this release is also excellent, much better than previous releases.
I:8381;2247;Yes, it's really that good.
I:8381;2248;scan format, with ONLY the (admittedly good) English.
I:8381;2249;Your kids won't notice the difference, and hopefully if this disc sells well someone at Fox will notice and put together a proper edition for the enthusiasts.
I:8381;2250;It's a great movie to watch over and over again.
I:8381;2251;a great film in its own right .
I:8381;2252;My children love this movie.
I:8381;2253;The story is unique and well done.
I:8381;2254;This is true magic, a world made from Children's imaginations.
I:8381;2255;it is absolute magic of gorgeous animation and enchanting beautiful storytelling.
I:8381;2256;MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is definitely a movie that the whole family can and will enjoy ^_^
I:8381;2257;if your a fan you know this is a good product no matter what.
I:8381;2258;We both viewed the film as an older VHS version.
I:8381;2259;This is such a good film that my 4 year old daughter has seen it about a hundred times, and so have I!
I:8381;2260;you see new details each time you watch.
I:8381;2261;The story is absolutely wonderful .
I:8381;2262;The girls soon meet the spirit king of the forest (Totoro) and fantastic adventures follow.
I:8381;2263;And Amazon contributes to this, do a search for 'Miyazaki Blu.
I:8381;2264;disney one is worth bank!
I:8381;2265;Plus it was fun watching both versions.
I:8381;2266;all that aside, this is a sweet story.
I:8381;2267;Great for the whole family, even wee ones who get scared at anything.
I:8381;2268;Miyazaki is a genius and even tho' I enjoy others of his like Princess Mononoke and Nausica, it's nice to watch one that's not trying to pummel me over the head about the dangers of war or the perils of industrialization.
I:8381;2269;Living in japan, it is a very interesting movie.
I:8381;2270;We can watch this one with the kids and stay entertained!
I:8381;2271;It is amazing to know that I can keep a piece of my childhood.
I:8381;2272;Nothing like the movie to put a smile on your face.
I:8381;2273;such a great movie by studio ghibili.
I:8381;2274;Its a great movie for families with children since there isn't any gruesomeness to it like some other studio ghibili movies.
I:8381;2275;This is still a favorite for me and I love the realness put into the characters.
I:8381;2276;This a great film, especially for young children.
I:8381;2277;The characters are engaging and the story is compelling and gentle.
I:8381;2278;Totoro and Buscat are great.
I:8381;2279;With so few fun and gentle G. rated movies around, this is a real treat.
I:8381;2280;But this older one is just perfect!
I:8381;2281;We love this movie .
I:8381;2282;and this release is great.
I:8381;2283;The english track is very well done, but it also includes the Japanese track with subtitles (which my kids like better).
I:8381;2284;So excited to have this in our collection!
I:8381;2285;It was great the way it was.
I:8381;2286;I recommend the original one over this FAKE one.
I:8381;2287;My children and I are huge fans.
I:8381;2288;I bought this to share with our newest edition our 2 yr old son.
I:8381;2289;My eyes actually got watery because it felt like something sacred was butchered.
I:8381;2290;If you are able to obtain a copy if the original English version before Disney took over a redid the voices please do.
I:8381;2291;It's the true Totoro in my opinion.
I:8381;2292;Is like someone painting a smile on the original Mona Lisa.
I:8381;2293;The movie captured kids behaviour very well.
I:8381;2294;All our family loves it.
I:8381;2295;One of miyazaki's classic animation films.
I:8381;2296;my children loved this movie, their favorite was kiki's delivery service.
I:8381;2297;Great and exciting movie for kids.
I:8381;2298;they got the story right and they love it
I:8381;2299;My wife is a big Miyazaki fan, and I've always enjoyed the visuals of his films, but this was the one that the story, characters, and of course the artistry all came together to create the Miyazaki magic!
I:8381;2300;As with all foreign films, it'd be best to see it in its original language (not dubbed) with subtitles.
I:8381;2301;Really happy about that, and the product was exactly everything as it was described in the reviews.
I:8381;2302;The pricing was amazing many of the other competitor stores did not meet the pricing this seller had it for!
I:8381;2303;I love that it is the original dubbing!
I:8381;2304;year old son and we (my son and myself) love it so much we have to have our own copy.
I:8381;2305;The animation is beautiful and the characters are just wonderful.
I:8381;2306;It's such a nice change from all this Pokemon and Power Rangers.
I:8381;2307;warming story that I know we'll enjoy for years to come!
I:8381;2308;Gotta love that furry Totoro XD!
I:8381;2309;I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Miyazaki's films.
I:8381;2310;The animation and color is amazing.
I:8381;2311;it made me tear up at some parts.
I:8381;2312;my nieces love watching it too.
I:8381;2313;This was one of my most favorite movies growing up.
I:8381;2314;The cast they had in the FOX version brought the heart and soul to the movie for those of us that grew up with this movie.
I:8381;2315;If you are a Totoro fan definitely order from this seller.
I:8381;2316;A wonderful magical film that I enjoyed along with my 6 year old grandaughter!
I:8381;2317;Beautifully done in a sweet gentle manner.
I:8381;2318;I am an artist and I just loved the way it was created.
I:8381;2319;This master piece is a fantastic example of his mastery.
I:8381;2320;This film is a wonderful treat for everyone in the family.
I:8381;2321;My little grandson was thrilled when he opened this gift on Christmas morning.
I:8381;2322;He really loved watching this movie during the holidays.
I:8381;2323;I _love _ this movie.
I:8381;2324;It's about their wild and wonderful friend Totoro and the games they play.
I:8381;2325;this is a wonderful movie for the whole family, from the tiniest tykes to the old grumpy folks .
I:8381;2326;it will bring a smile to your face.
I:8381;2327;It is beautifully animated, warm and thoughtful and would make a great addition to your animation collection or as a gift for some one who likes animation.
I:8381;2328;This is a fantastic movie that is pure story and imagination driven that can be enjoyed by any age.
I:8381;2329;The animation is just beautiful.
I:8381;2330;It kind of makes me believe in the cat.
I:8381;2331;Excellent child fantasy story that adults will have fun watching as well!
I:8381;2332;The movie My neighbor Totoro is one of the best movies ever!!!
I:8381;2333;I, personally, love Japanese cartoons, and this is one of the best I've ever seen!
I:8381;2334;Totoro, in classic Miyazaki tradition, brings the fantastic into the realm of everyday occurrences.
I:8381;2335;without giving anything away, MY NEIGHBOR, TOTORO is a heartwarming film that inspires both the young and the old alike.
I:8381;2336;Watching the film again several years after seeing it in the theaters, I realize that the story works NOT because it is about fantastic and magical characters but rather it involves everyday struggles.
I:8381;2337;In TOTORO, we see Miyaki revisiting the same themes (i. e. familial harmony, nature, environmental awareness, courage, etc.) that he further develops in his later works.
I:8381;2338;Nevertheless, the mastery and the imagination behind his craft keeps the story fresh.
I:8381;2339;despite what the Box Office report card may indicate for MY NEIGHBOR, TOTORO, this is a film sure to be a hit with the family.
I:8381;2340;Totoro has brought me so much joy.
I:8381;2341;original Japanese audio and new English dub, storyboards, behind.
I:8381;2342;It has the original Japanese language tracks.
I:8381;2343;now that their films are popular in the U. s. they are exercising their creative control and forbid Disney from altering the films.
I:8381;2344;The pronunciation of the names is closer to the original Japanese pronunciation.
I:8381;2345;It totally omits one of my favorite phrases in the movie.
I:8381;2346;This heart warming Anime is full of the love of family and how understanding adults can bring out the best in their children.
I:8381;2347;While magic and fantasy fill this movie, there is also a great role model for how a family should be.
I:8381;2348;Was fast delievery and a wonderful, timeless classic.
I:8381;2349;This movie is great for all ages.
I:8381;2350;it makes one feel like a young child again.
I:8381;2351;dubbed version yesterday and found it amazingly good!!
I:8381;2352;This movie has quickly become a family favorite in our home.
I:8381;2353;"My children love it because they relate to the children in the movie, and I love it because it is a wonderful and magical experience for anyone who is willing to suspend belief and allow the story to guide you through the world these two sisters and their neighbor ""Totoro""."
I:8381;2354;This movie has a special place in my heart and it's a must see.
I:8381;2355;So excited to have added it to my collection.
I:8381;2356;one of the best kids movies in existence still to this day.
I:8381;2357;a touching, warm, gentle story without any bad guys (why do disney movies always have to have bad guys, tinkerbell being the exception).2 strong and heartwarming girls trying their hardest to grow up in the world.
I:8381;2358;it will forever remain timeless.
I:8381;2359;by the way, the cat bus was the inspiration for one of the characters in the avatar/airbender series (another equally excellent kids show).
I:8381;2360;every since my daughter and I saw this movie soooo many years ago we have loved it!
I:8381;2361;it is an amazing adventure and she is now 19 and I wanted to get this movie to share with her over and over again
I:8381;2362;"Miyazaki's movies are great
I:8381;2363;but the kids absolutely love this movie.
I:8381;2364;It's not the signing, dancing type of movie, but it seems to be extremely watchable for them and they do love to watch it over and over.
I:8381;2365;A wonderful movie for kids, and a true PG movie.
I:8381;2366;No violence, not much in the way of scarry moments, and yet extraordinarily engaging.
I:8381;2367;breathtaking visuals, it takes you back to moments in childhood when the world was filled with wonder and magic.
I:8381;2368;big fan of Studio Ghibli work!
I:8381;2369;There is even even the English subtitle of the Japanese audio, as well as the English subtitle of the English audio.
I:8381;2370;This is another example of a Miyazaki masterpiece, that combines a interesting plot with a family orientated theme that is also appealing to the older viewer.
I:8381;2371;This is because the film contains many subtle points that will be readily grasped by the adult viewer.
I:8381;2372;The story centres on the friendship that develops between two children and a forest spirit.
I:8381;2373;While their mother is critically ill the children are made to feel happy due to their exploits.
I:8381;2374;I first seen this movie a few months ago, but loved it.
I:8381;2375;I'm sure my daughter will also enjoy it when she gets a bit older.
I:8381;2376;one of the things I love about the original is that it doesn't try to explain everything, it makes you think.
I:8381;2377;It's probably fine, for anyone who hasn't seen the original.
I:8381;2378;I was captivated by Totoro and its friends when I was a child.
I:8381;2379;As we grew up, becoming adults and preoccupied with our works to sustain our livelihood, we forget about the magical time being a child and the innocence that comes with it.
I:8381;2380;In fact, Miyazaki's offerings are always appealing to people of all ages and the stories are something that we can relate to as they talk of family, memory, friendship, coexistence with nature and other transient beings.
I:8381;2381;It's all about live and let live, humanity at its utmost best.
I:8381;2382;This movie allows us to see the postwar Japanese society when adults have to work hard in the city whilst their children are left in the countryside where standard of living is much lower.
I:8381;2383;Community spirit is strong where elderly would look after their children.
I:8381;2384;If you are keen to detail and your sense of humour is a bit off.you'll love this.
I:8381;2385;my teens still watch this over and over!
I:8381;2386;Miyazaki is a master at capturing children's personalities.
I:8381;2387;he breaks the traditional film structure and takes you on a unique journey.
I:8381;2388;The whimsical feel of this movie and the plot line made me feel curious and excited, just like a child (before they realize how crappy the real world actually is, hahhaha).
I:8381;2389;The new voice overs absolutely take away every aspect of the film that we love so dearly.
I:8381;2390;The opening and closing songs are so addictive.
I:8381;2391;Now onto the good stuff.
I:8381;2392;One day, while in the forest, Satsuki and Mei discover a magical spirit named the Totoro who becomes the gentle protector of the two children.
I:8381;2393;There is a depth of emotion between the two sisters which is unheard of in American animated films.
I:8381;2394;As always director Hayao Miyazaki leads us on a rich emotional journey in which character takes precedent over narrative.
I:8381;2395;Miyazaki is confident enough in his own craft to let his stories tell themselves.
I:8381;2396;My Neighbor Totoro is another great work from a modern master.
I:8381;2397;it is still worth having.
I:8381;2398;This is my three year old son's favorite movie.
I:8381;2399;There is always so much to see in a Miyazaki film.
I:8381;2400;This is a wonderful movie.
I:8381;2401;I have two eight year old daughters who with myself loved this film.
I:8381;2402;It is so refreshing to see an animated feature with such a gentle story and beautiful animation.
I:8381;2403;Totoro came into our family life such as a fresh breeze and gave us a total new look on kid's movie, more magical than any Disneyesque stuffs we saw in the past.
I:8381;2404;I wept when the kids cried and laughed throghuout the movie, specially my 2 year old.
I:8381;2405;it was great, the whole family loved it adults and kids alike.
I:8381;2406;The Special Features and Editorial Reviews sections from Amazon tell you probably all you need to know about the story and what you'll find on the bonus disc, but I will add that you can watch/listen to the movie with the original Japanese sound track/voices, which may be important to some people.
I:8381;2407;I enjoyed the English dub and then I watched it again with the original Japanese soundtrack, with English subtitles.
I:8381;2408;There is also a French dub option.
I:8381;2409;but I can say that this is a great version and all the actors did a great job with the voice acting.
I:8381;2410;My 3 year old loves this movie.
I:8381;2411;it's definitely a movie I don't mind watching every day.
I:8381;2412;He often gets scared with newer Disney and other movies but this is wonderfull for him.
I:8381;2413;The music is lovely and we love Studio Ghibli Movies anyway
I:8381;2414;One of the best Miyazaki movies ever!
I:8381;2415;A great story about how a little girl makes friends with a forest spirit when her family moves to a new home!
I:8381;2416;Saw this movie as a kid and still love it as an adult, my kids even love it!
I:8381;2417;As one of my favorite films of all time, I was crushed to have to give this release four stars.
I:8381;2418;I had high hopes for a Disney release, and the one bonus is the anamorphic (widescreen) presentation.
I:8381;2419;A cast of stars (Dakota Fanning, etc.) lend their voices, but the charm and spark is lessened.
I:8381;2420;Its a great family movie unique and diverse.
I:8381;2421;There is also a re.
I:8381;2422;Overall this is a great family movie very cute.
I:8381;2423;its definately worth getting to have in your collection.
I:8381;2424;violent and entertaining for all of us.
I:8381;2425;This movie certainly fits all of my criteria.
I:8381;2426;The characters are very engaging and the kids actually act like real kids.
I:8381;2427;This is a very cute entertaining video for all ages.
I:8381;2428;Great for children under 3 because it contains no violence.
I:8381;2429;My Neighbor Totoro is a great film and a must have part of even a modest anime collection.
I:8381;2430;I remember seeing this on tv a few years ago.
I:8381;2431;It was amazing, cute , just another great ghibli movie.
I:8381;2432;The concept is so imaginative and fun.
I:8381;2433;it was just as good as when I last saw it but it seems the voice acters changed but still good
I:8381;2434;Still, Miyazakie presents an exquisite experience.
I:8381;2435;My 5 and 6.5 year old sons loved this movie.
I:8381;2436;I read positive reviews on [.]
I:8381;2437;It is a sweet, tender movie that highlights how kids' imaginations shape their perception of the world.
I:8381;2438;The music is also very catchy and you'll find yourself singing it for days.
I:8381;2439;I loved this classic and wished to share it with my four year old niece.
I:8381;2440;She finally had to take it away and 'regulate' her Totoro watching.
I:8381;2441;overall, an excellent product, shipped fast.
I:8381;2442;My Neighbor Totoro is the classic that introduced American audiences to Miyazaki's magic.
I:8381;2443;On the one hand, you are brought back to a child.
I:8381;2444;"esque feel good platitude here
I:8381;2445;A wonderful show to be enjoyed by the whole familly.
I:8381;2446;My kids loved the movie.
I:8381;2447;It was well made and has a good story.
I:8381;2448;The graphics are also beautiful.
I:8381;2449;If you have children or love animation, you must see this movie!
I:8381;2450;Totoro is one of the best japanese animated movies of all time and even surpasses Disney!
I:8381;2451;We become immersed in a beautiful, innocent and simple world.
I:8381;2452;Magical, wonderous, uplifting amazingly animated!
I:8381;2453;what fun this movie is.
I:8381;2454;Simply put, one of the most unique films I have ever seen.
I:8381;2455;magical, charming, and at times breathtaking.
I:8381;2456;sweet like many other kids` movies.
I:8381;2457;This is by far my favorite movie by Hayao Miyazaki.
I:8381;2458;The story line is good, the characters are lovable, and the animation is classic.
I:8381;2459;This is a simple story in one respect, yet there is a continued, deeper meaning as I re.
I:8381;2460;I've loved this movie ever since I was a young child, but you are sure to enjoy this at any age!
I:8381;2461;This is Hayao Miyazaki at his finest.
I:8381;2462;"We have been on a Hayao Miyazaki kick since first seeing ""Spirited Away""."
I:8381;2463;yr old toddlers (boy and girl) just love this movie, and have been watching it often.
I:8381;2464;, along with the focus of the story being young children.
I:8381;2465;The artistic nature and attention to the little details of background sound in the movie is wonderful.
I:8381;2466;i can easily picture growing up in a similar environment.
I:8381;2467;Having seen Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle, both breath.
I:8381;2468;taking in all senses, Totoro comes way under par both in the plot and in the graphics, both of which I found over.
I:8381;2469;After all these years it is still enjoyed by the entire family!
I:8381;2470;My kids love this movie.
I:8381;2471;"If you google ""the meaning of My Neighbor Totoro,"" there are a lot of theories about this movie."
I:8381;2472;This is a magical tale of childhood.
I:8381;2473;This movie has lovely visuals and is great to watch if you are feeling depressed.
I:8381;2474;It's a magical, mystical story set in post.
I:8381;2475;Great animation and music add to the story, as well as a rescue mission that has a happy ending.
I:8381;2476;This is the definitive English.
I:8381;2477;You've got to have it.
I:8381;2478;steer clear of the Disney product.
I:8381;2479;I'm trying to watch a Japanese film so I can see a Japanese film.
I:8381;2480;this Fox product is great.
I:8381;2481;I still love this movie!
I:8381;2482;I love the Japanese version better than the English version.
I:8381;2483;This is a really good movie!
I:8381;2484;I remember seeing this back in '95, and after picking up the video just recently, this small wave of nostalgia ran over me.
I:8381;2485;my Neighbor Totoro, directed by one of THE greatest animators of all time, has touched the hearts of millions.
I:8381;2486;Hayao Miyazaki did a superb job when he adapted this movie from the children's book of the same name.
I:8381;2487;Though the book only had one girl, Hayao decided to metaphorically 'split her in two' and created an older sister, Setsuki, and a younger sister, Mei, for the anime.
I:8381;2488;"Totoro is quite the strange looking creature
I:8381;2489;While it all sounds very childish, anyone who ever was a child can enjoy this movie.
I:8381;2490;Even today Totoro's animation rivals the best animes'.
I:8381;2491;highly recommended for those with an open mind.
I:8381;2492;The reason is a good one, as reasons go: it was the last important film by Miyazaki that I had not yet seen, and I was saving it for a special occasion.
I:8381;2493;I love seeing again films that I have loved the first time through, but there is always a special magic to seeing a film for the first time.
I:8381;2494;Fortunately, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO was worth the weight.
I:8381;2495;how does this film compare with Miyazaki's finest films?
I:8381;2496;This is a hard question, because he has a large number clustered at the top, all of them excellent.
I:8381;2497;True, the girls have moved to the countryside with their father because their mother is in a nearby hospital recovering from a rather vague illness, and the forest is haunted, but the illness is never perceived as especially worrisome (except near the end, when a slight cold prevents her making a brief visit home, provoking a crisis with her daughters), and the spirits in the forest are remarkably benign and benevolent.
I:8381;2498;The world in this film is a loving world, all the way down to a remarkable creature that is a cross between Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat and a school bus (literally).
I:8381;2499;The way the wind is portrayed as moving through the tops of the trees, the hint of spraying mist, the manner in which the wind moves like a wave over the grass, the shuttering of the house under the assault of the air, are all things of remarkable artistry.
I:8381;2500;of all Miyazaki's extraordinary gifts as an animator and a storyteller, his greatest virtue might be his patience, and this is something he holds in common with many of the Japanese animators.
I:8381;2501;American animated films seem to be more interested in where they are going than in how they are getting there, while for Miyazaki the journey is the far more important part of the film.
I:8381;2502;Miyazaki, on the other hand, respects his viewers, and is confident that they won't give up on a film simply because the story moves at a steady pace.
I:8381;2503;In MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, one of the sisters will begin to enter a room, look from one side to the other, take a step, look around again, and gradually and slowly discover what is inside.
I:8381;2504;As a result, every moment of the film becomes a discovery of marvelous and wonderful things.
I:8381;2505;i would say that this is a very special film by a very special filmmaker, except for the fact that for Hayao Miyazaki special seems to be the norm.
I:8381;2506;This movie is beyond great.
I:8381;2507;It brings families together to watch a heart warming story of kids who find a spirit that is friendly.
I:8381;2508;A really great family movie, although with a few somewhat intense scenes.
I:8381;2509;Our kids have watched it dozens of times, and it's still on the top of their playlist.
I:8381;2510;My daughter (age 5) and son (age 4) love this movie.
I:8381;2511;Before it was a lovely, innocent, charming movie.
I:8381;2512;This is one of the most fabulous movies going, and if you can't find the original movie, by this one.
I:8381;2513;My Neighbor Totoro is a cute little movie.
I:8381;2514;Like I said, the characters are cute and the animation is good, but I think this is definitely a YOUNG child film.
I:8381;2515;they're full of fantasy surprises around every corner.
I:8381;2516;i give it 3 stars .
I:8381;2517;I would give it 2 stars, but the movie is definitely well animated, so I gave it 3.
I:8381;2518;My Neighbor Totoro is my favorite movie of all time.
I:8381;2519;This is a wonderful film that everyone will embrace.
I:8381;2520;The characters, especially Totoro himself, are beautifully drawn and charming.
I:8381;2521;The story is endearing and joyful.
I:8381;2522;This is my second favorite animated film.
I:8381;2523;doo One, The Cat in the Hat, and Rugrats Go Wild.
I:8381;2524;While films like those be long forgotten, Totoro will go on into the hearts and minds of all film.
I:8381;2525;The movie easily gets 5 stars.
I:8381;2526;For those who don't already know, Disney has owned all of Studio Ghibli's movies since 1996.
I:8381;2527;This includes My Neighbor Totoro in widescreen, Japanese, and anything they could hope to call an extra.
I:8381;2528;They worked with what they had and did the best they could.
I:8381;2529;we have 3 children ages 11 to 6, and they all love it.
I:8381;2530;known among the anime community that dubs usually do stink, and over 15 years after first watching Totoro I always thought Fox had done an exceptional job avoiding this stereotype.
I:8381;2531;Let me count the ways!
I:8381;2532;Also, for some reason the ending theme has a pop.
I:8381;2533;These songs are nostalgic and meaningful to me, and it was hard to hear them re.
I:8381;2534;The woman who sang in the Fox version had a very pleasant voice and there were no pop.
I:8381;2535;Part of what brings the characters to life are the non.
I:8381;2536;"verbal vocal noises they make, like ""hmm""s and grunts and the like."
I:8381;2537;par, ESPECIALLY when pitted against their previous English voices, which were so lively and well.
I:8381;2538;Mei's previous voice was babyish and cute, and gave the impression that she was much younger than her older sister.
I:8381;2539;As both a child and an adult, I always found this scene to be very moving.
I:8381;2540;Then all of a sudden, Satsuki bursts into tears!
I:8381;2541;In and of itself, My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful movie with no scary antagonists to defeat and a strong sense of familial bonds.
I:8381;2542;I think it's a great addition to any child's movie collection.
I:8381;2543;Why did Disney have to change something that was so charming and elegant in the first place.
I:8381;2544;true Totoro fans should steer clear of this Disney make.
I:8381;2545;It seemed a bit slow at times, but the kids enjoyed it.
I:8381;2546;I like this version a lot better than the one that Disney recently released.
I:8381;2547;I own them both and this is the one that I watch.
I:8381;2548;"The Disney one has its benefits
I:8381;2549;this movie was my introduction to Miyazaki many years ago and is one of my most favorite animated films.
I:8381;2550;Every child I have ever know that sees this movie loves it.
I:8381;2551;This movie is great for the whole family.
I:8381;2552;I would highly recommend it along with any other film from Studio Ghibli.
I:8381;2553;A wonderful story full of fantasy!
I:8381;2554;Miyazaki again uses animals and creatures to tell his amazing story.
I:8381;2555;The voice talent is great too.
I:8381;2556;I can respect the story and the cat/bear/owl is cool looking.
I:8381;2557;The product is licensed by Disney so you know what you are going to get.
I:8381;2558;I watched this film with my brother and we thought it as one od the beatifuly moving films in the last fifty years.
I:8381;2559;My wife and I are big fans of Miyazaki's films, but this particular one is very close to our hearts.
I:8381;2560;Everyone from age 1 to age 99 can find something to relate to and enjoy in this heartwarming movie for the whole family.
I:8381;2561;I've seen it in a theatre first time.
I:8381;2562;Yes, the story line is like a fairy tale.
I:8381;2563;The Head Butler recommended it, and he was spot on.
I:8381;2564;My grandchildren (3 year old triplets) were mesmerized throughout the whole film, and I loved it too.
I:8381;2565;really cute movie and the kids love watching it.
I:8381;2566;Glad that it also has the original Japanese version (language) as well.
I:8381;2567;All three of my children (ages 11, 9 and 2) LOVE this movie.
I:8381;2568;We love it so much that we bought the book and read it too!
I:8381;2569;ray version is nice and clean and the menu is easy to operate.
I:8381;2570;I bought this movie thinking 'oh, a classic, this'll be great!
I:8381;2571;This is an interesting movie.
I:8381;2572;loving ten.year old LOVES it.
I:8381;2573;Miyazaki has made some of the best animated films I know of, Spirited Away is my favorite of his works thus far.
I:8381;2574;I give this a three because of the advantages of a great story and the extras you get with this, however the voice acting takes this down.
I:8381;2575;This is the best of Miyazaki movies.
I:8381;2576;Totoro characters are all so cute and the movie has all good things such as family and neighbor love, children's dreams, beatiful scenery, etc.
I:8381;2577;It is a happy endiing story for everyone of a family.
I:8381;2578;This was a lovely film for the whole family.
I:8381;2579;It is an artwork in itself and a true pleasure to watch.
I:8381;2580;It offered a touching story, a fun ending, and was an instant favorite in our home.
I:8381;2581;I think this is great for kids!
I:8381;2582;The fanning sister's voices are no match for the wonderful Japanese animation.
I:8381;2583;my daughter loved this film in it's original format at a friend's house, and we decided to get it for her.
I:8381;2584;This is one of the most heartwarming films of director Hayao Miyazaki's collection.
I:8381;2585;I have seen practically all of Miyazaki's movies, and I love every one of them.
I:8381;2586;I'd highly recommend this movie to anyone.
I:8381;2587;Totoro is a forest god that can only be seen by children.
I:8381;2588;this movie can be enjoyed by anyone from 2year.
I:8381;2589;warming and makes you grin in many parts.
I:8381;2590;another great film by Miyazaki.
I:8381;2591;Even though I don't understand much Japanese, the movie is much more fun in the original with subtitles, because of the energy of the voices.
I:8381;2592;as for the movie itself, it is a very cute, older Hayao Miyazaki piece that is worth adding to any Miyazaki fan's collection.
I:8381;2593;friendly movie, and, even though it is an older piece, still can be enjoyed by adults and children alike.
I:8381;2594;i know this is a very cute movie because i loved it when i first saw it years ago.
I:8381;2595;A Great Gift for a Great Friend.
I:8381;2596;This movie is the best of Miyazaki's films.
I:8381;2597;Watch this one first if you are new to Miyazaki's movies, you will be in for a treat!
I:8381;2598;This movie captivated my heart after I discovered Kiki's Delivery Service.
I:8381;2599;It's a family fun film, full with adventures and newfound discoveries.
I:8381;2600;Hayao, once again you did a fantastic job directing this film.
I:8381;2601;SOOOOOOOOO amazing I love everything about it, includeing the voices, some people aomplain about, but I've never heard the other version so I'm cool!
I:8381;2602;Also I love how there is a sisterly love between the two that is not seen in any other show movie whatever!
I:8381;2603;They obveusly love eachother it's nice to see.
I:8381;2604;I recommend this movie to 2 year olds to 200 years old.
I:8381;2605;I loved the 20th Century Fox one, this Disney one just isn't as good.
I:8381;2606;"When my daughter was 4 I got her this movie and she was scared of the ""big scary cat""."
I:8381;2607;She now has a 2 year old that just loves the movie too.
I:8381;2608;"She got her old VHS out and let her watch before she was old enough to really know ""scared""."
I:8381;2609;She still loves watching it, now with her daughter.
I:8381;2610;Instead of judging it through adult eyes, let the little ones feel it in their heart.
I:8381;2611;Out of all the Disney movies and others that she has had, this one will always be her favorite.
I:8381;2612;the movie is very innocent and touching movie in so many ways.
I:8381;2613;"It's a make you feel good movie with what one could see it as fantasy or obscured idea
I:8381;2614;totoro's been around since the late 80's but it's one of those classic anime's that just stays around for decades.
I:8381;2615;The music of the movie is also touching and it'll ring in your head often.
I:8381;2616;A must see movie if you have children 3+ age.
I:8381;2617;a little mature, but plenty for the eye and the mind to chew on.
I:8381;2618;This movie is a true classic, especially if you have girls in the house.
I:8381;2619;I definitely should have paid a little more attention to dates and names and I would have known something was up.
I:8381;2620;I was surprised how ananimation movie can give me such peace and comfort.
I:8381;2621;It is important to realize that we are living everyday polluted with something.
I:8381;2622;mei, age 4, and Satsuki, age 8, are two (very) energetic girls.
I:8381;2623;the single coolest creature to ever be painted onto the silver screen.
I:8381;2624;He is adorable, yes freaking adorable, but tough looking, and his tail, oh man, what a tail.
I:8381;2625;Just like in Spirited Away, some of the paintings look like very beautiful nature photographs.
I:8381;2626;The girls' emotions are captured perfectly with the pen and easel.
I:8381;2627;They have vibrant imaginations, but realistic problems.
I:8381;2628;Almost everyone I knew into animation told me I'd love this movie after I got into Studio Gibli's work a few years back.
I:8381;2629;It's a good movie, but I don't think they used the magical elements and creatures enough.
I:8381;2630;But the important thing is that the movie itself is perfectly fine so I'm satisfied :)Thank you very much
I:8381;2631;My seven year old adores this film, as do I. My Neighbor Totoro is a gentle foray into Japanese animation and lore.
I:8381;2632;I highly recommend this film.
I:8381;2633;I love this movie, and I have used this film in my foreign language exploratory classes.
I:8381;2634;"My students have loved it for its ""cuteness"" and I've loved it for its numerous references to Japanese culture, especially having lived in Japan for a number of years."
I:8381;2635;"Even little things like explaining that the children were able to visit their mother on ""Rice Planting Day"" rather than just saying that they had a day off, is refreshing."
I:8381;2636;My young toddler daughter also enjoys this film, and I try to show it to anyone with any interest at all.
I:8381;2637;I've always loved this movie.
I:8381;2638;The animations are very fluid, supports the story telling.
I:8381;2639;The characters are also very cute and you get a connection with them as you watch the film progress.
I:8381;2640;Very well done animation and anyone who appreciates animation should definitely watch.
I:8381;2641;It is a family favorite, but only in orginal form, not with the Dakota Fanning voice.
I:8381;2642;Sorry to her fans, but the orginal voices are more true to the story line.
I:8381;2643;Some of the best stories and animation since the early days of Disney.
I:8381;2644;Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli produce some of the finest stories from Japanese culture.
I:8381;2645;I can't recommend any of their movies enough!
I:8381;2646;Fantastic film with beautiful backgrounds.
I:8381;2647;I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed this film.
I:8381;2648;Although I'm a self confessed ghibli fan, this is essentially a film aimed at children, but which I loved from the word go.
I:8381;2649;It has beautiful animation and a simple story that captivates you and makes you smile the whole way.
I:8381;2650;The characterisation is great and the kids in the film are genuinely endearing.
I:8381;2651;The specific touches, like the cat bus, add that spark of magic and wonder for kids and adults alike.
I:8381;2652;I really was surprised at how much I liked this film and have to rate it very highly in Ghibli's output of work.
I:8381;2653;Great viewing and not to be missed.
I:8381;2654;This is an incredibly cute wonderful movie.
I:8381;2655;Great for anyone who loves adventure and furry, hugable creatures!
I:8381;2656;Studio Ghibli makes another great movie.
I:8381;2657;This is probably one of the best animated movies made.
I:8381;2658;This movie is really good!
I:8381;2659;I turned it on, and was shocked with amazement!
I:8381;2660;It was so good and all this time I was passing right by it!
I:8381;2661;Plus it's a good family movie, my whole family did seemed to like it!
I:8381;2662;This is a wonderful story the whole family can enjoy.
I:8381;2663;Totoro is a good story with interesting characters that show themselves only to children.
I:8381;2664;The cat bus is ultra cool too.
I:8381;2665;You will see a few cultural differences in the basic story as well.
I:8381;2666;This makes the film more enjoyable.
I:8381;2667;Shortly after they move into the house, the girls discover amazing things, most importantly, Totoro.
I:8381;2668;Totoro is a forest spirit that only children can see.
I:8381;2669;The plot is relatively simple, but it just brings you back to a time of innocence.
I:8381;2670;The character development is superbly done.
I:8381;2671;You feel such a connection to the girls and their adventures in this movie.
I:8381;2672;He just has the best talent for capturing emotion and scenery so perfectly.
I:8381;2673;The dubbing from Japanese to English was very well done too.
I:8381;2674;I am watching it right now!
I:8381;2675;I hope you all enjoy this movie as much as me!
I:8381;2676;This is a very feel good movie for both adult and kids about two girls named Satsuki and Mei who have very strong and creative imaginations.
I:8381;2677;They end up moving to a gorgeous countryside with their father and embark on very powerful adventures with a being named Totoro.
I:8381;2678;They end up experiencing some very spiritual adventures created from their very powerful and creative adventures.
I:8381;2679;The beings that they meet are very loving and benevolent.
I:8381;2680;I believe that the strong message of this story is that things are not always as they seem and one's imagination can open one up to the blessings and miracles of life.
I:8381;2681;This movie will leave you with a smile on your face.
I:8381;2682;Overall a strong Miyazaki movie with a positive element about the power of a child's imagination.
I:8381;2683;"faceted stories, ""Totoro"" succeeds equally wonderfully due to itssimplicity."
I:8381;2684;Others wish to share this with their children, and having an English dub present they find pleasing is important.
I:8381;2685;If you need this in English, I recommend you spot check the English track and decide during your return window if it is acceptable or not.
I:8381;2686;my Neighbor Totoro is a movie about a university professor who moves himself and his two daughters to a remote village to be closer to their mother who is in the hospital.
I:8381;2687;totoro is a spirit living in the forest near their new home, and he winds up being a friend and ally of the two girls.
I:8381;2688;You won't really notice any video related issues and this is a very good thing.
I:8381;2689;The English language track is, as stated above, the re.
I:8381;2690;this was an interview style piece with Miyazaki that was created for the original Japanese release.
I:8381;2691;It's one of my all time favorite animated films.
I:8381;2692;The extras are good, but nothing amazing.
I:8381;2693;i'm happy I picked this up.
I:8381;2694;This movie is teeming with creativity and magic, but ultimately does not transcend enough beyond a kid's movie at times.
I:8381;2695;I greatly enjoyed this film, moreso than any other film that I would classify as strictly for children.
I:8381;2696;There are scenes that remind us of what childhood is like, and other scenes which take us on a fascinating journey.
I:8381;2697;this is a great kid's movie, and one which most adults will enjoy.
I:8381;2698;My Neighbor Totoro is one of the most charming animated films ever made.
I:8381;2699;screen option, and the image could be a bit sharper, but it is still pretty good.
I:8381;2700;with beautiful countryside scenes, rippling water, rainy busstops, and trees blowing in the wind wonderfully done.
I:8381;2701;The fantastic spirit creatures (especially the totoros of varying sizes and the Catbus) are charming and clever.
I:8381;2702;the human characters are warm and real.
I:8381;2703;I liked the suspense that built up when the 4.
I:8381;2704;I also liked the magical, dream sequence when Totoro's acorns grow into a giant camphor tree and the children fly with Totoro to the treetops.
I:8381;2705;animated movies are typically fast.
I:8381;2706;Each frame is like a watercolor painting and has a certain beauty.
I:8381;2707;It's a cultural difference and reflects a society in which people are more in tune with nature and the simple joy of being alive.
I:8381;2708;It works because the characters are well.
I:8381;2709;defined and we care about them.
I:8381;2710;The sisters are delighted with their new home.
I:8381;2711;I have never seen a more realistic depiction of how children think and behave.
I:8381;2712;the children are full of life and explore their new house with excitement.
I:8381;2713;It's not typical for animated films to deal with such themes as illness, but this is a realistic world and the situation fits.
I:8381;2714;She views the world with the charming fascination of a child, exploring her surroundings and watching tadpoles swim in the stream.
I:8381;2715;She tracks it into a tunnel formed by overhanging trees.
I:8381;2716;She prods it inquisitively and it seems unconcerned by her presence.
I:8381;2717;It's very refreshing to see that kind of trust between adult and child.
I:8381;2718;These simple words make her happy.
I:8381;2719;the film defies our expectations at every turn.
I:8381;2720;She feels important and quietly sits at her desk drawing a picture of the totoro.
I:8381;2721;i don't want to give away the whole story, but the totoro has an important part to play in the lives of the girls.
I:8381;2722;Their friend the totoro is a reassuring presence and knows how to solve the problem.
I:8381;2723;Little Mei is probably my favorite character in any animated film.
I:8381;2724;Miyazaki's drawings are quite simple, but he can convey emotion with just a few expressions.
I:8381;2725;He varies the size of the children's mouths and eyes according to the mood of the scene.
I:8381;2726;It's a warm and happy place to visit and I wish the real world were more like Miyazaki's imaginary ones.
I:8381;2727;miyazaki has a wonderful imagination and it's even more prominent in fantasy worlds such as those encountered in Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Castle in the Sky and the Oscar.
I:8381;2728;All of his stories have warmth and heart.
I:8381;2729;His enthusiasm is infectious and he smiles when he talks about his worlds.
I:8381;2730;i consider My Neighbor Totoro to be the perfect family film.
I:8381;2731;It may also be the happiest film I've ever seen and the relationship between the sisters is wonderful to watch.
I:8381;2732;Adults treat children seriously and genuinely want to know what's important to them.
I:8381;2733;miyazaki has crafted a film filled with wonder and a sense of discovery.
I:8381;2734;The expressions of concentration, determination and pure wonder on Mei's face are depicted perfectly.
I:8381;2735;The film is full of beauty.
I:8381;2736;although it is beautiful .
I:8381;2737;I'm also referring to the actions performed by the people and creatures in the film.
I:8381;2738;the feelings created by the story are considerably enhanced by Joe Hisaishi's haunting score.
I:8381;2739;He's responsible for the music in all of Miyazaki's films and the two have established a good understanding.
I:8381;2740;The good thing about the recent releases is that the original Japanese version is included as an option.
I:8381;2741;If you want to experience the film in its native language, you can now do so, with or without subtitles.
I:8381;2742;My forlorn hope is to see the short included among the special features when the film is released on Blu.
I:8381;2743;i would recommend Miyazaki's films to everyone, although I realize that some people won't connect with them.
I:8381;2744;The potential reward is worth the time investment.
I:8381;2745;Try to go in with an open mind.
I:8381;2746;It's closer to a film like Bambi than Megamind or Despicable Me.
I:8381;2747;Pixar has elevated North American films to new levels over the past two decades, but I can honestly say that Studio Ghibli, and Miyazaki in particular, has produced films with more heart.
I:8381;2748;They are beautiful, magical and full of imagination.
I:8381;2749;"Out of all of these films, this little gem, ""My Neighbor Totoro"", may just be the finest family film of all."
I:8381;2750;While it doesn't sound like engaging cinema, it has a warm, touching atmosphere with an emphasis on the importance of family togetherness.
I:8381;2751;While it is a fine family film, it is also a wonderfully experimental art film.
I:8381;2752;Instead of relying on a conventional plot, it explores it's world with a childlike sense of wonder, taking life one step at a time.
I:8381;2753;The human characters have surprisingly real personalities, and are somehow able to get along with each other for the most part.
I:8381;2754;The spirits also fit surprisingly well into the realistic world, as if they really did exist.
I:8381;2755;This film also has the most detailed and beautiful backgrounds you'll ever see in a film.
I:8381;2756;The beautifully crafted plants make you want to go outside and explore nature (after you're done watching the movie, of course).
I:8381;2757;One thing that really irks me however, is that many fans give this wonderful film one measly star, simply because they didn't like Disney's dub.
I:8381;2758;Also, the cover art makes it look like one of those Disney musical rip.
I:8381;2759;This really is one of Hayao Miyazaki's best works.
I:8381;2760;A wonderfully strange and delightful film with beautiful animation, and by beautiful I mean amazingly beautiful, with an absorbing story.
I:8381;2761;This is a MUST SEE video!I have watched in in Japanese English, and it is a classic.
I:8381;2762;So much fun, the whole family really enjoys it!
I:8381;2763;It is so much fun to sit with my kids and watch it.
I:8381;2764;A friend recommended this movie for my daughter who was 3 at the time.
I:8381;2765;I love the artistic style of the Japanese anime.
I:8381;2766;It is more like a beautiful, nature.y aesthetic experience that creates memories in a child's mind and enriches a love for nature and family throughout their lives.
I:8381;2767;I feel that overall this movie has way more positive life.
I:8381;2768;enriching moments to offer than those small complaints!
I:8381;2769;Beautiful music the entire time with raindrop noises during the rain.
I:8381;2770;both movies are good for ages 4.10, as long as you review Nausicaa for violence ahead of time!
I:8381;2771;I received this item, which I ordered off of this site, yesterday and watched it right away.
I:8381;2772;I was pleasantly surprised because I did not like Spirited Away very much.
I:8381;2773;this movie is aimed more at children than Spirited Away, making it easier for people who know little about Japanese culture to understand.
I:8381;2774;I discovered Totoro through my interest in anime (Japanese animation), and this movie is, without a doubt, one of the best.
I:8381;2775;I'm 35 years old (no children) and I find this one of the most comforting movies in my collection.
I:8381;2776;hearted, this is the tape I reach for.
I:8381;2777;By the end of the movie, all is right in the world.
I:8381;2778;A truly positive story for kids without violence or bullies, and a nice little escape for grown ups.
I:8381;2779;Moving to a new house, two sisters and their father discover they are not alone.
I:8381;2780;What unfolds is a beautiful story of friendship, belief, faith and trust.
I:8381;2781;Involving a whole community, the girls experience a new world of surprises, adventure and new friends.
I:8381;2782;Hayao Miyazaki's 1988 film surely broadened the fans of his animation style from avid anime fans to wide range of ordinary audience.
I:8381;2783;life oriented vivid one probably influenced by his long.
I:8381;2784;Then Totoro finds amazing way to search for Satsuki's stranded sister.
I:8381;2785;verdict: Probably the nice introduction to Miyazaki/Ghibli works.
I:8381;2786;Both me and my children loved this move and watched it repeatedly
I:8381;2787;Life charged, natural feel to it.
I:8381;2788;The children romp and explore just like real children do.
I:8381;2789;It's downright uncanny how Miyazaki can do that.
I:8381;2790;That's all I will say about that one.
I:8381;2791;I had the tendency that liked documental and truth story than fantasy story.
I:8381;2792;Off course for young children or the person that like fantasy, Totoro will be the best movie.
I:8381;2793;the movie that Miyazaki make is included the important messages.
I:8381;2794;That is to say, nature is one of imoportant things for human.
I:8381;2795;and I am surprised that many U. s,A people knew Miyazaki's movies.
I:8381;2796;The actors that play the characters in the film are all perfectly cast and you find their emotions believable.
I:8381;2797;Disney should have only opened it up for wide screen and improved the appearance.
I:8381;2798;Both my girls love this movie!!
I:8381;2799;It's got a great story line to it too.
I:8381;2800;Our daughter is quite the drama queen, at least for now, so this movie gives us some good stuff to compare her trials to the girls in this story.
I:8381;2801;This has become one of my favorite kids movies ever.
I:8381;2802;The children characters are well developed.
I:8381;2803;The story is very touching and the childhood magic of being able to see the soot.
I:8381;2804;sprites and totoro captures the days before one grows up.
I:8381;2805;This movie is really funny and cute.
I:8381;2806;The Totoro family is soooo cute.
I:8381;2807;The movie some funny songs too.
I:8381;2808;The girls in it think everything is funny.
I:8381;2809;So they laugh throughout the whole movie.
I:8381;2810;It's an excellent movie for everyone in your family.
I:8381;2811;so go on and laugh away those dust bunnies!!
I:8381;2812;I wanted the original with the original voices.
I:8381;2813;"Set in what I would estimate to be the late 50s or early 60s in rural Japan, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is the story of a family who relocates to the country and the wonderful mystical creatures they meet and the adventures they have."
I:8381;2814;"Their adventures start with discovering ""Soot Sprites"" while moving in the house but the greatest discovery is their neighbor, Totoro, a giant furry forest spirit."
I:8381;2815;The girls are learning to face their fears and growing in the process.
I:8381;2816;In order to make more, he jumps up and down and brings down a deluge from the trees.
I:8381;2817;It makes me laugh just thinking about it.
I:8381;2818;This early Studio Ghibli work helped set their high standard of excellence in animation.
I:8381;2819;"besides being a cute story, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" gives a good glimpse of rural Japan from that time period."
I:8381;2820;The two releases are Disney and Fox.
I:8381;2821;The additional features, particularly the Japanese language help make up for it in part but overall, I prefer the Fox version for sheer viewability.
I:8381;2822;that having been said, I give the Fox release 4 stars as well.
I:8381;2823;this is a cute story and I consider it excellent for children as there is no violence and the creatures, while strange, are not particularly scary.
I:8381;2824;It usually draws rave reviews when I show it to children and adults enjoy it, too.
I:8381;2825;I saw this for the first time recently, what a warm and truly wonderful film.
I:8381;2826;region Japanese pressing, in letterbox, with both English and Japanese audio.
I:8381;2827;old, who loves sing along and belt the words out.
I:8381;2828;But the lyrics translation is well done overall, so I can't really complain.)
I:8381;2829;All it has to offer is storyboards.
I:8381;2830;My wife, 4 year old daugthter and I all liked Spirited Away and Kiki's Delivery service, and so a friend recommended this movie to me.
I:8381;2831;He said it was a great family movie.
I:8381;2832;It is very fun, heart warming and humorous.
I:8381;2833;"BTW, if you like this, also check out ""Wisper of the Heart"", another great Studio Ghibli film."
I:8381;2834;Have fun, we know you will if you watch this movie.
I:8381;2835;star masterpeice that must be seen by anyone who can.
I:8381;2836;There is no better living Film director than Miyazaki and with every feature it grows truer and truer.
I:8381;2837;Totoro is a wonderful film the whole family can enjoy and it has the incredible ability to lift spirits at all times.
I:8381;2838;This is a travesty and a diservice to this great film.
I:8381;2839;Any fan of childlike sweetness will love this movie.
I:8381;2840;Every character is innocent and friendly.
I:8381;2841;Overall, however, the movie is very good .
I:8381;2842;an excellent choice for family viewing.
I:8381;2843;How wonderful it is to be able to experience what is surely a cherished family classic for a generation of people from another country.
I:8381;2844;as with all Studio Ghibli productions the animations and the artwork are a pure joy.
I:8381;2845;This is not so much a rousing adventure as much as it is a fanciful look at the imaginations of young children set against a backdrop of Japanese folklore and mysticism.
I:8381;2846;My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this film and highly recommend it to anyone who finds joy in seeing the world through the imagination of children.
I:8381;2847;It's been my favorite move for years and now it's my daughter's favorite movie too.
I:8381;2848;the father plays along and encourages them with kindness and understanding .
I:8381;2849;its just simply amazing and warm.
I:8381;2850;makes you want to just jump into the movie and play along.
I:8381;2851;I'm a teacher and always looking for children's movies that are appropriate for those rainy recess days.
I:8381;2852;It is engaging enough for all ages, and allows them to activate their imaginations.
I:8381;2853;I'll look forward to watching it over and over.
I:8381;2854;If you like Miyazaki films, this one is unique and great for children of all ages.
I:8381;2855;If you have two children close in age, you will see their relationship mirrored in this animated film.
I:8381;2856;The imagination, the mystery, the wonder, and the vulnerability of childhood is captured nicely, probably the adults appreciate this more.
I:8381;2857;But there is plenty for children to enjoy, especially when the humor escapes us adults but makes perfect sense to children.
I:8381;2858;My children, both girls, ages 8 and 6 laughed through out the film and could relate to the story and the characters.
I:8381;2859;Miyazaki is wonderful for making stories and characters complex and delves into the gray areas that other children's animated films dare not venture.
I:8381;2860;Check it out and you'll see.
I:8381;2861;I love, love, love the original English dub but this will do.
I:8381;2862;Thanks guys you did an excellent job keep it up.
I:8381;2863;I would have thought I would have gotten sick of this movie, but it stands up well after repeating viewings.
I:8381;2864;My sons favorite movie of all times.
I:8381;2865;This was my favorite movie when I was a teenager in hg school and thought I would introduce my son to this movie as well.
I:8381;2866;He has a very vivid imagination so this movie was perfect.
I:8381;2867;Great movie for all ages!
I:8381;2868;I watched this movie with my 12 year old cousin Kris recently and was in perfect awe by how amusing and wonderful the story was.
I:8381;2869;Immensly popular in Japan i have learned, i was stunned by the clean and excellent dubbing and music that added to the movie instead of making it sound awkward like many other anime that i have seen.
I:8381;2870;and the loveable and charictors that were not unlikly children.
I:8381;2871;the dialogue in the first american version by fox is alot more captivating.
I:8381;2872;having the fanning sisters voice as May and her sister and altering the dialogue is a spit in the face to Hayao Miyazaki
I:8381;2873;I agree with those here who rate this as one of their favorite films.
I:8381;2874;Two little girls, along with their dad, move into an old house in the country.
I:8381;2875;A delightful movie for everyone in the family.
I:8381;2876;Beautiful renderings of rural Japan, charming little girls, and a lot of imagination.
I:8381;2877;Everyone will want a ticket to ride the cat.
I:8381;2878;First let me say that I love the movie My Neighbor Totoro!
I:8381;2879;The changes are subtle, but noticeable.
I:8381;2880;I'll probably end up sending this one back or trading it in.
I:8381;2881;I bought this for my fiance because he loves the movie and we could not find it anywhere local.
I:8381;2882;I found it on Amazon and had to get it for him.
I:8381;2883;It came really quickly, was packaged well, and was in perfect condition.
I:8381;2884;He was so happy to see the movie again, and to own it.
I:8381;2885;So glad I found it, and in blu.
I:8381;2886;Totoro is one of the best animated films for not just kids, but kids.
I:8381;2887;This was our families first experience with a Miyazaki film, so it has a special place for us.
I:8381;2888;this version is the original with the original voiceover cast.
I:8381;2889;Once you have seen one Miyazaki film you will want to see them all!
I:8381;2890;When watching 'Toy Story 3' and Totoro makes an appearance my 18.
I:8381;2891;The characters are amazing .
I:8381;2892;the imagination is astounding and yet, with the family with a sick mom in a far.
I:8381;2893;away hospital, new house, new neighbors kids can relate.
I:8381;2894;Fantastic story, my 7 year old absolutely loves this film, again and again.
I:8381;2895;"One trivial point that will interest a tiny minority is there is a scene with the two girls bathing with their father (open bathing is normal in Japan and the film clearly stays G or PG here)
I:8381;2896;However, this film make my daughter happy again and again, so it's probably worth it.
I:8381;2897;there are definitely issues with the translation in the old version, but the charm and similarity to how actual sisters act is gone.
I:8381;2898;this is an amazing movie in both versions, but it does not change the fact that the version my kids grew up watching was what we were looking for.
I:8381;2899;i am sure any kid who grows up with the newer version will prefer it to the Streamline version, so if you do not have mine or my kids' prejudice you are probably going to love it, and I am sure you will love it as much as my kids and I love the version we are used to.
I:8381;2900;So maybe it is closer to his vision and better in that way.
I:8381;2901;I found myself giggling with Mei, and I love the scenes when she chases Chu and Chibi around the yard, and pokes Oh's tail to elicit that rubber ducky sound before dozing on his soft, furry belly.
I:8381;2902;they just look so soft!I marvel at the imagination it takes to think up a many.
I:8381;2903;We fell in love with it and I still love it to this day.
I:8381;2904;It is a rather simple plot that is easy to enjoy if you are kid or a kid at heart.
I:8381;2905;Since the first theatrical release in Japan, I have been a devoted fan of this film, and Totoro and two sisters' wonderful, magical, fascinating tale in rural Japan is my all.
I:8381;2906;up, but still can enjoy watching it.
I:8381;2907;Two lovable sisters are always well.
I:8381;2908;drawn and credible while three furry monsters Totoro s (lovely creatures, indeed) are nothing but charming.
I:8381;2909;And these things many fans have said rightly.
I:8381;2910;Now I could add some reasons for the enormous popularity, especially popularity in Japan.
I:8381;2911;as you know after watching the opening scenes, this animation uses the countryside of Japan as its background.
I:8381;2912;These facts, beside its good story telling, make the film all the more charming for us, Japanese.
I:8381;2913;Yes, we see even our autobiography in it sometimes.
I:8381;2914;I have, and all those memories would spring back to my mind vividly while watching Totoro.
I:8381;2915;Of course, kids enjoy this film, but it is something more as director Hayao Miyazaki's films always are.
I:8381;2916;bus is infallably the favorite and wonder for kids, and three Totoro s always steal your eyes.
I:8381;2917;Kids can enjoy it, and so can adults.
I:8381;2918;by the way, something about sisters' names.
I:8381;2919;"Satsuki is the old, elegant way of calling the fifth month of the year
I:8381;2920;In the history of animation all the way until today Disney has shined above the rest with the brining to life of classic stories.
I:8381;2921;It is the story of two sisters that move into a new house that they feel is being watched by spirits.
I:8381;2922;Being the adventurous girls they are, they find that there is a something there and it's big!
I:8381;2923;Once they find it an incredible world of wonderous adventures begin and their lives will never be the same.'
I:8381;2924;My Neighbor Totoro' was such a wonderful film.
I:8381;2925;I was captivated by the complexity of the characters in such a simple story.
I:8381;2926;It really stands up there along with some of the great Dinsey classics, which is no surprise that Disney got their hands on it.
I:8381;2927;You will laugh until it hurts and just stare in amazment of all the fantastic moments that will captivate you in this adorable family film.
I:8381;2928;It got to me, on time, in perfect condition, including the special edition cover and all.
I:8381;2929;Service was fantastic and he loved his gift!
I:8381;2930;This movie is great if you have children or love japanese animation.
I:8381;2931;I had this on VHS over a decade ago and I'm glad I have this again in an updated format.
I:8381;2932;Makes a wonderful gift for most any occasion.
I:8381;2933;My 3 year old daughter, my 8 year old son and myself all love this story.
I:8381;2934;It is not an action packed move to be sure, but it is beautifully illustrated and very magical.
I:8381;2935;This is my favorite of all this series of movies.
I:8381;2936;The first time I saw it I was 7 and it's as good now as it was then (I'm 19).
I:8381;2937;The animation is absolutely flawless and Totoro is as cool now as ever.
I:8381;2938;You won't go wrong with watching this movie, it's beautiful eye.
I:8381;2939;candy and a heartwarming story.
I:8381;2940;I have always enjoyed Miyazaki's work and his animation style.
I:8381;2941;Very good story line, good animation, and a good video for young children.
I:8381;2942;The character Totoro is very popular in Japan.
I:8381;2943;It is still a wonderful movie.
I:8381;2944;My 4 year old noticed the differences right away.
I:8381;2945;I just love this movie.
I:8381;2946;it is just such a cute story with adorable characters and you cant help but fall in love!
I:8381;2947;you wont regret adding this movie to your collection!
I:8381;2948;I was so happy to find this movie!
I:8381;2949;My Neighbor Totoro is one of those movies that you watch.
I:8381;2950;Miyazaki Hayao has once again opened the portals to imagination and given us a wonderful, heart.
I:8381;2951;warming story that children and adults will find entertaining, if not thought provoking.
I:8381;2952;If you've never watched a Miyazaki Hayao movie before, this is the one to start with!
I:8381;2953;I feel the older Fox release is more charming.
I:8381;2954;Was exactly what we wanted and made everyone happy.
I:8381;2955;Would recommend this to any family who likes Totoro as much as we do.
I:8381;2956;This movie is just terrific!
I:8381;2957;The story is somewhat unpredictable so adults will enjoy watching it with the kids.
I:8381;2958;There are some serious issues of illness, but there's a happy ending so kids will love it.
I:8381;2959;This is just such a movie, with lovely drawings and great animation.
I:8381;2960;disc set contains original Japanese language with an English subtitle option (along with English dub).
I:8381;2961;with that out of the way (and I think with little need to stress the fact that this is a spectacular family film), let me be an advocate of one approach here.
I:8381;2962;Even if you're showing this to children (and please, watch this with them, you'll be delighted), make every effort to watch it in the original Japanese, with subtitles, and read for them if needed.
I:8381;2963;"There's nothing innately bad about this but almost always, if you go to the original and listen very carefully to the emotions and inflections of a language you may not even understand, you'll find that the original film makes much more ""emotional"" sense than the American version."
I:8381;2964;I've worked with Disney on some projects and frankly they need someone to talk to them and help them get back to another world of magic entirely.
I:8381;2965;This is also the best way to start them on a path of appreciating other cultures and non.
I:8381;2966;c) The Japanese, with an ancient theatrical traditional, field spectacular actors and the voice talent that turns up in these movies is often as good as can be hoped for.
I:8381;2967;This particular film is beautifully acted.
I:8381;2968;In what I've encountered, Japanese actors generally portray finer ranges and nuances of emotion and manage gentleness and innocence particularly well.
I:8381;2969;Listen to the original and compare.
I:8381;2970;Crystal was brilliant in Monsters Inc. the part being pretty much written for him.
I:8381;2971;crack delivery is more than a little out.
I:8381;2972;well if you've read all these reviews you've had quite a bit of eye strain and opinion (along with some notable facts I might add).
I:8381;2973;For me, I couldn't wait to get this to share it with my 2 1/2 yr old daughter and she loves it.
I:8381;2974;Just enjoy it for what it is.
I:8381;2975;the beauty and spirit of Japan and of children.
I:8381;2976;I'd never seen this film before, but I bought it because I'm a Miyazaki fan.
I:8381;2977;I loved this film, sure, but not as much as say Howl's Moving Castle or Spirited Away (all highly recommended).
I:8381;2978;The silly forest spirits are actually more of a side plot to what is happening in the story.
I:8381;2979;could watch this movie all day long what a treasure every child should see this movie!!
I:8381;2980;great lessons and how families should love each other!
I:8381;2981;I'm a fan of many Studio Ghibli films, even the darker ones for older audiences, but this one is pure joy that's appropriate for even quite young kids.
I:8381;2982;The Cat Bus is absolutely great, and Totoro's pretty cool too.
I:8381;2983;I was searching the internet for a show for a 2 yo and this got some high reviews.
I:8381;2984;My neighbor totoro is the most magical film I have ever seen.
I:8381;2985;My Neighbor Totoro is the story of two children and their father who move to a house full of mystical sprits.
I:8381;2986;(That are cute beyond all reason).
I:8381;2987;All of which are animated with beauty beyond compare, which is expected seeing as how it's a studio ghibli production.
I:8381;2988;The english dub is very good compared too most anime.
I:8381;2989;This is a wonderful, magical story in the best Miyazaki tradition.
I:8381;2990;And, as usual, the imagery is beautiful, too.
I:8381;2991;This is a totally delightfull tale.
I:8381;2992;Miyazaki's films always amaze me with the grasp on scenery, detail and the depiction of human nature.
I:8381;2993;Everything is just so well orchestrated in this film, right down to the catchy music that plays white the Totoro is flying.
I:8381;2994;It was just in the last few years that I've opened up to more of it.
I:8381;2995;please, don't let annoying people keep you from enjoying the animation of other cultures.
I:8381;2996;Almost every area of the world has great animated features that get overlooked (Triplets of Belleville is good for example).
I:8381;2997;and inspiring is the word that I think best suits how I feel about My Neighbor Totoro, This was the second full length anime movie I ever sat down and watched (Spirited Away was first).
I:8381;2998;The film really conveys the feeling of the world it depicts.
I:8381;2999;What really impressed me was the depiction of people.
I:8381;3000;The little girls are portrayed as two happy, laughing kids enjoying life.
I:8381;3001;I swear, the animators this an amazing job of making the main Totoro look lovable and warm and fluffy, yet intelligent somehow.
I:8381;3002;You don't really get too much background on the Totoro or the wonderfully designed catbus, but the characters all fit very well in their respective scenes.
I:8381;3003;Just a sweet and good hearted story.
I:8381;3004;all of this said, while this film is definately a really good one, it's not Miyazaki's best.
I:8381;3005;But it's a great start if you're looking for an introduction to his style or even just a good movie you can watch with the kids or by yourself or whatever.
I:8381;3006;this film by the now famous Miyazaki is charming, endearing, touching, warm, cozy, magical.
I:8381;3007;as a Pagan woman with a son who was 4 when I got it for him, the film got a lot of play in my home.
I:8381;3008;children's videos that haunt the living rooms of the world, My Neighbor Totoro goes so much deeper and enters a world of mystery and beauty, fright and pain, sacrifice and friendship.
I:8381;3009;The Japanese Shinto religion is alive in this film, with tree spirits still being honored and various shrines dotting the landscape.
I:8381;3010;absolutely one of the best anime films ever made, and one of the best children's films ever made.
I:8381;3011;"I think ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is very good animation movie which show a beautiful scene of Japan."
I:8381;3012;I recommend you to watch it.
I:8381;3013;My Neighbor Totoro is a childhood memory for me.
I:8381;3014;old kid love it, too, also his little friends.
I:8381;3015;Because she loves it but her mom can only understand English.
I:8381;3016;I asked around to see what the best films and series were and, of course, Myiaskai's films were highly recommended.
I:8381;3017;It is my favorite film of any genre (not just children's).
I:8381;3018;Give it a watch, then start your own Myisaki collection!
I:8381;3019;My Daughter really likes this movie a lot!!!
I:8381;3020;She loves it college freshman that she is.
I:8381;3021;A heart warming tale about two girls who moved to the country with their father so that they can be closer to the hospital where their mother is being treated.
I:8381;3022;Miyazaki is a master at creating a world through simple, beautiful animation that even in the mundane context of living in the country in an old house, magical creatures and wonderful discoveries can happen .
I:8381;3023;The movie connects with kids of all ages.
I:8381;3024;Beautiful movie with great imagery and a sweet story line.
I:8381;3025;Appropriate for and should be seen by kids of all ages!
I:8381;3026;"All of Miyazaki's films are wonderful and unique, particularly if you are sick of the ""same old"" in all other animation where ""good fights bad, good wins, and everything is wrapped up neatly in the end."""
I:8381;3027;This is the original U. s. adaptation of a beautiful, charming film.
I:8381;3028;for the price i would recommend it.
I:8381;3029;also the movie is really great for kids, but i think adults would enjoy it too.
I:8381;3030;not too much action, and it is more whimsical than anything.
I:8381;3031;"Roger Ebert has it on his ""100 Great Movies"" list."
I:8381;3032;Akira Kurosawa considered it one of the best films ever made.
I:8381;3033;It is really, really that good.
I:8381;3034;"miyazaki's fantasy works on so many levels, it is almost impossible to classify ""My Neighbor Totoro."""
I:8381;3035;It is funny, touching, cute, dramatic and pretty much everything else.
I:8381;3036;"i recommend that you give ""My Neighbor Totoro"" a try, even if you don't think that you will like it."
I:8381;3037;"When I finally watched it, all I could say is ""Wow."""
I:8381;3038;My Neighbor Totoro is the most beautiful and wonderful animated movie I have ever seen in my life.
I:8381;3039;I have a soft spot for rich animated movies but these days it is rare for me to discover one.
I:8381;3040;No matter what animated movies will be released in the future, My Neighbor Totoro will be the one I come back to watch and treasure.
I:8381;3041;I was introduced into anime at a young age with Pokemon and Sailor Moon.
I:8381;3042;But when I do see or hear about an excellent anime film ~ I want to watch it.
I:8381;3043;I prefer Studio Ghibli films over Dreamworks and Disney.
I:8381;3044;The animation is beautiful and sways to the air instead of being blocky and the stories do not follow the generic plot structure.
I:8381;3045;Finally, her surgery took place and everything was successful.
I:8381;3046;Now, 8 years later, she is completely healthy and I am off to college and my sister is in middle school becoming an amazing girl's hockey player.
I:8381;3047;because of this, this movie has an extreme connection with me.
I:8381;3048;Her sister must find her with the help of Totoro and the Cat Bus, another adorable character.
I:8381;3049;And by the end of the movie I was in tears.
I:8381;3050;A movie that can affect your emotions this well is a powerful one.
I:8381;3051;They are not striving after a boy, while a neighbor does have a little crush on the older sister one, and they use their imagination to create a wonderful world in the beautiful country of Japan.
I:8381;3052;And I think that helps bring even more magic and wonderment to the movie.
I:8381;3053;The score and songs played in this film are absolutely adorable and should appeal to both children and older audiences.
I:8381;3054;when I have children, I will be showing them this animated film.
I:8381;3055;More movies directed to children should be created with this amount of intelligence, heart, and beauty.
I:8381;3056;My Neighbor Totoro will forever have a place in my heart.
I:8381;3057;I wanted to share my love of Miyazaki's animated features with my 5.
I:8381;3058;My Neighbor Totoro proved to be delightful and engaging, perfect for a young child.
I:8381;3059;the story is simple and sweet without being overly cloying.
I:8381;3060;Totoro is a sight to behold .
I:8381;3061;his large appearance and loud growls belie a gentle nature, one which is in harmony with Mother Nature.
I:8381;3062;a cat which is also a bus, which looks like it was inspired by Lewis Carroll's Cheshire cat!There are no villains in this charming and engaging story, and I found that quite refreshing (why should there be villains in children's stories, they'll learn the harsh realities of life soon enough!)
I:8381;3063;She loves the giant, endearing creature and would watch with rapt fascination each time Totoro appeared on screen.
I:8381;3064;i loved the gentle ecological message of being in harmony with nature .
I:8381;3065;Totoro bequests a gift of seeds to the sisters which they plant in their garden.
I:8381;3066;This is a sweet movie perfect for little ones and also older viewers .
I:8381;3067;a show that can be enjoyed by the entire family.
I:8381;3068;Regardless of where in the world you are from, if you have seen My Neighbor Totoro you will hold it near to your heart.
I:8381;3069;It's as iconic in Americas pop culture as it is in Japan.
I:8381;3070;ray version opens up this classic to a whole new generation.
