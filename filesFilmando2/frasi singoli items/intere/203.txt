I:16748;1;(3 1/2*'s) Spike Lee takes what could have been an above average TV crimeshow and elevates it into cool and campy art.
I:16748;2;Generously, he offers it's a trick question.)
I:16748;3;He has quite a crew and set up as he and his cohorts enter disguised as painters.
I:16748;4;After terrorizing the people, he takes their cell phones, has them disrobe and makes them dress in terrorist garb, like their own.
I:16748;5;It turns out the bank president (Christopher Plummer) and his close associate, Ms. White (played with steely cool by Jody Foster) have a stake in Dalton's game.
I:16748;6;The president has a sensitive secret which Dalton can exploit, so, while the hostage taker may not seem to be playing with a full deck, he is indeed working with a full hand.
I:16748;7;intriguing through much and entertaining throughout, 'Inside Man' often is played like an inside joke, one caper that we can easily follow along.
I:16748;8;Denzel Washington has some great, witty lines that are usually associated with James Bond or roles Bruce Willis plays.
I:16748;9;I really liked this movie, so when I saw it on blu.
I:16748;10;The price was pretty good too!
I:16748;11;Awesome movie at a great price from Amazon!
I:16748;12;They are super fast shippers and orders are always accurate!
I:16748;13;This one, for example, stars Denzel Washington and Jodiet Foster.
I:16748;14;The one note about Spike Lee films is that you're never sure what you're going to get.
I:16748;15;Inside Man retains all the elements of a solid bank robbery/caper film, whilst also giving us Spike Lee's trademark of gritty, street.
I:16748;16;long running time and you have a film that features some great performances by it's cast .
I:16748;17;An enigmatic master criminal (Owen) .
I:16748;18;the NYPD negotiator given the task of dealing with these crooks is an affable junior detective, Detective Keith Frazier (Washington) .
I:16748;19;Enter smarmy and elegant New York political insider Madeline White (Foster) who knows everybody and even has the ear of the Mayor.
I:16748;20;This is just one of the many techniques Lee uses to clutter the movie's structure and prevent the plot from unfolding as quickly as it should.
I:16748;21;In all fairness, Inside Man has some interesting things to say about race, money, power and the ethics of urban living, particularly in New York and the performances are wonderfully cynical and gritty.
I:16748;22;washington is sexy and strong, Foster is skillfully odious as the icy, sophisticated and amoral Madeline who cares for nothing but chasing big bucks, Owen is morbidly compelling as the determined heavy and Plummer is letter.
I:16748;23;"the plot is really simple: Dalton Russell, played brilliantly (as always) by Clive Owen, has devised ""the perfect bank robbery,"" which he is executing in a branch of the bank in the middle of New York City."
I:16748;24;other than Foster's character, we pretty much know exactly the kind of person we are dealing with when it comes to Russell, Frazier, and the other important roles.
I:16748;25;A film with this much build up, and when the build up is this well done, needs to absolutely blow the viewer away with the ending, or the whole film seems to be for naught.
I:16748;26;This is the best Spike Lee film that I have ever seen, but that really isn't saying that much.
I:16748;27;This movie is a WINNER!Totally entertaining, well acted and directed .
I:16748;28;and one you'll be talking about when it's over.
I:16748;29;what a good ol'fashion mystery!
I:16748;30;Definitely worth checking it out.
I:16748;31;Denzel and Clive are great in this movie.
I:16748;32;I highly recommend this film.
I:16748;33;One of the most literate scripts with fine actors and a great story which lends itself to a sequel.
I:16748;34;For viewers who like characters that match wits with each other, you will enjoy this movie.
I:16748;35;This elevates him to an elegant criminal, with a dash of violence.
I:16748;36;Nobody can pull a fast one on him.
I:16748;37;"winners
I:16748;38;I found the conclusion most satisfying.
I:16748;39;i really like this movie and it is pretty good on blu ray at a very price
I:16748;40;though interesting as only worthy failures can be, were so self.
I:16748;41;powered by a great true story and towering performance by Denzel Washington, Spike Lee did hit it out of the park once, with Malcolm X, since then it's been a pretty bleak season for the alleged vunderkind.
I:16748;42;an exciting, action picture with an interesting psychological twist.
I:16748;43;As with Malcolm X, the budget is lavish .
I:16748;44;this is a dressy film to watch.
I:16748;45;Marquee talent is everywhere, Clive Owen, Denzel Washington, Willem Dafoe, even Jodie Foster.
I:16748;46;But Lee is a very special idiot, and he manages.
I:16748;47;despite all the hoopla, this is a one.
I:16748;48;This one has an amazingly high rating.
I:16748;49;"this is an ""OK"" movie and I don't regret that I spent time watching it."
I:16748;50;when I see a crime thriller with good reviews and high ratings, I expect an exceptionally good plot.
I:16748;51;But this one was, well, an exception.
I:16748;52;Great movie and would watch it again.
I:16748;53;Interesting story line for sure.
I:16748;54;There's a lot of irrelevant mind games and moralizing going on in this movie but the main character after denzel does a great job of telling the story and the pay off is worth it.
I:16748;55;Was as good the tenth time as the first.
I:16748;56;I love the crazy New Yorkers.
I:16748;57;I am generally a loyal fan of heist films, and I like both Denzel Washington and Clive Owen.
I:16748;58;Thus, going into this film I had high hopes that it would be compelling and enjoyable.
I:16748;59;Denzel is one of my favorite actors but he is above this movie.
I:16748;60;This is the fourth movie Denzel has made with Spike Lee.
I:16748;61;Lets hope its his last.
I:16748;62;As one of the premier actors in Hollywood, he deserves better.
I:16748;63;personally I found the pacing a welcomed change.
I:16748;64;It was easier to follow and more engaging than some of Lee's more preachy endeavors, and while it lacks the depth and pristine command that Lee exhibited in `25th Hour' it manages to keep my interest throughout.
I:16748;65;at the films open we are introduced to Dalton Russell.
I:16748;66;Pay close attention for he chooses his words carefully.
I:16748;67;He is going to rob a bank.
I:16748;68;the performances are a delight here though.
I:16748;69;Clive Owen is a very effective actor who has consistently presented himself wonderfully on screen.
I:16748;70;He's able to engage the audience from the moment he opens his mouth (that voice) but he also has the ability to sustain our attention with the light in his eyes.
I:16748;71;Denzel Washington was a nice surprise here as well.
I:16748;72;He was able to keep his charm controlled as apposed to allowing it to run wild as he often does.
I:16748;73;This is probably one of his better performances, for he found the proper balance in his style of acting.
I:16748;74;Where was this amazing and commanding force back when she was winning Oscars for performances that were beneath her obviously?
I:16748;75;I mean what she does here is leagues ahead of a lot of her more acclaimed performances.
I:16748;76;In the end `Inside Man' is a very interesting and enjoyable heist film.
I:16748;77;The performances and the quick paced action will keep you glued even if the films preposterousness wages war on you later on.
I:16748;78;Just turn your mind off for a few hours and enjoy a good popcorn flick.
I:16748;79;I love the bank robber dramas, especially when that robber is smart and witty.
I:16748;80;Clive Owen does a good job acting as this intelligent bank robber.
I:16748;81;With such an outstanding cast, great story and entertaining premise why was Spike Lee selected to do this film?
I:16748;82;The policeman who first arrives at the bank and reports the bank status .
I:16748;83;it is a well done movie .
I:16748;84;hand discussion of the damage done by videogames that glamorize the gangsta lifestyle and, as always, a lot of Spike's signature camera work and camera shots.
I:16748;85;For big Spike Lee fans, this might not be as much Spike as they want, but the film is still definitely worth watching.
I:16748;86;The bank robbery that follows is mysterious and more clever than it at first appears to be and the entire affair takes on extra realism thanks to an extremely good cast, including a number of lower.
I:16748;87;tier character actors putting in solid work, and especially Christopher Plummer and a surprisingly disquieting Jodie Foster, playing against type.
I:16748;88;the final resolution doesn't have quite the emotional pop that may have been intended, but it's an intellectually satisfying one.
I:16748;89;Inside Man could have used more of Spike Lee's signature style to spice things up, but it's still a very solid little caper movie and well worth seeing for fans of such films or Spike Lee Joints.
I:16748;90;best movie I've seen in a wile
I:16748;91;Clive Owens is the reason this movie is brilliant.
I:16748;92;Of course Denzel and Foster are going to deliver, but Owens shines the most in this one.
I:16748;93;Spike hit the mark on this tense and complex thriller.
I:16748;94;The perfect bank heist, with the cops and bank officials all twirling in their tracks, except for one man, the one whose secrets are at risk.
I:16748;95;Good performances by Denzel, Jodie and cast and some nice surprises at the end.
I:16748;96;i'd highly recommend this picture to anyone who has not seen it .
I:16748;97;very smart and gratifying .
I:16748;98;I work for a bank, and my subject line was because I would love for Clive to come visit me at work!!!!!
I:16748;99;it is a movie you could watch several times,still enjoy each time.
I:16748;100;Great movie with a load of interesting and very amusings extras.
I:16748;101;If you are in to scammmy twisty heist movies this is among the best in my opinion.
I:16748;102;the casting was perfect and the story was fun and intense.
I:16748;103;Nice work on the score as well if you are also a film music buff.
I:16748;104;Dalton is delaying everything, too.
I:16748;105;Filming was exceptional with director Spike Lee incorporating the darkness inside the bank in contrast to the white masks of the hostage.
I:16748;106;The movie's pace was satisfactory, too.
I:16748;107;developed plot devices that were extraneous or outlandish (the cops would NEVER let a citizen .
I:16748;108;still, it was fun to watch.
I:16748;109;A great caper flick, with just a pinch of social commentary.
I:16748;110;A good plot, keeps you guessing.
I:16748;111;It was worth that much.
I:16748;112;To many great actors for this not to be good!
I:16748;113;One of his better movies.
I:16748;114;As far as Spike lee films go, it's one of his better ones, and.
I:16748;115;As far as Denzel Washington films go, it's about the same as any other.
I:16748;116;It's the role he's been in so many times before, that Training Day was actually a nice change.
I:16748;117;It's more the interaction between the good actors that keeps this film flowing.
I:16748;118;Watch Ocean's 11, or the Italian Job if you want to watch something actually worth watching.
I:16748;119;Denzel is always good, and without him, this movie would probably have gotten 1 or 2 stars.
I:16748;120;At times it wanted to be funny, at other times gritty and tough, at other times smart and interesting.
I:16748;121;The net result, just an OK movie.
I:16748;122;Worth the time to watch.
I:16748;123;This was such a success first time around, they are in the process of shooting another one.
I:16748;124;there's a lot more here than first meets the eye.
I:16748;125;"Inside Man takes the heist film to another level, leaving ""terrorist"" thrillers like ""Die Hard"" in the dust, with the most ingenious heist plot going, period ."
I:16748;126;a killer cast, a wonderful score, fabulous camera work (some mind.
I:16748;127;forward editing style that actually helps viewer understanding and is a hallmark of the film's unique, hip style, courtesy of director Spike Lee.
I:16748;128;In a puzzling and peculiar fashion he is to us both a hero and a thief.
I:16748;129;with a philanthrophic bank executive as it's central villain, I. m is perhaps more timely and topical now than when it was first released in 2005.
I:16748;130;I particularly enjoyed how Madeleine White gets under the mayor's (and Arthur Case's) skin .
I:16748;131;and the extremely smart bit where those characters, once out of the public eye, suddenly change their conversation in the blink of an eye from philanthropy to the lobbyist's language of coercion.
I:16748;132;aside from the highly motivated characters, this film has a tremendous sense of humor and irony, and most of it comes out in the fact that the hostages are humiliated and bullied by the robbers AND the police.
I:16748;133;as a footnote, the main and end title designs were very nicely done, and in a rarity, the end credits depict all the orchestral players by instrument.
I:16748;134;remarkably ingenious, refreshing, tight structure, consistently engaging, never drops a beat, brilliant!
I:16748;135;the evil villain is the one you thought it would be the exact second you saw him.
I:16748;136;The brilliant plot to bring him down is hatched by a deus.
I:16748;137;Yet she still walks away with a paycheck after abundantly flaunting her VIP status and hinting that she has secret talents we can only guess at (cat.
I:16748;138;The cast including Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, and Christopher Plummer is outstanding.
I:16748;139;In fact it is rare that the whole family can sit down and watch an adult movie these days that will be only slightly offensive to some.
I:16748;140;After all it is the perfect bank robbery.
I:16748;141;The story unfolds so that we now think an outside negotiator will settle the deal and that's the end of it.
I:16748;142;I recommend this to the whole family.
I:16748;143;This kind of movie prompts you to take wild guesses, but what is fun is the process and class of the movie.
I:16748;144;Technology is getting far too perfect for these kind of brilliant man versus the system type movie.
I:16748;145;So these movies will become more and more rare, so we should enjoy them while we can.
I:16748;146;"This film is so good that carries a pearl ""inside"" it: Miss Florina Petcu."
I:16748;147;She's so hot, so exhilarating that I'm amazed that since this movie no one hear about her on a more generous role in another movie (I think she'll be a great Wonder Woman).
I:16748;148;It seems that Spike has grown up and is finally just making smart movies.
I:16748;149;This heist movie is compelling and well played primarily because an interesting story is supported by interesting characters.
I:16748;150;Lee has always put together an interesting visual product and he's finally made a movie that's not pedantic.
I:16748;151;Learn as little as you can before watching to keep it fresh.
I:16748;152;Good movie from a few years ago.
I:16748;153;It draws out after a while but it is a movie you should watch again.
I:16748;154;Worth the 2.99 I paid in amazon to watch.
I:16748;155;It stars a bit slow but the ending is pretty good.
I:16748;156;It 's definitely worth watching.
I:16748;157;The first 45 minutes are gripping.
I:16748;158;Four people dressed as painters hold up the bank.
I:16748;159;Enter Detective Frazier, a tough streetwise cop on his first negotiating job.
I:16748;160;Frazier matches wits with the clever bank robber, Dalton Russell.
I:16748;161;While Frazier and Russell have the ultimate battle of wits, a twist occurs when Madeline White a sassy aid to the elite class of New York, enters wanting to talk with Dalton for her own purposes.
I:16748;162;This movie is truly a roller coaster ride with high.
I:16748;163;director Spike Lee rejoins Denzel Washington for the fourth pairing of the actor.
I:16748;164;A strong supporting cast makes this a solid group for the film.
I:16748;165;spike Lee does a good job of developing each of the main characters in the story and allows the audience to view things from each person's angle.
I:16748;166;Denzel Washington's character shares personal and professional experience, which shows what motivates him to do his job.
I:16748;167;the most thrilling part of the movie has to be the plot development.
I:16748;168;It is done in such a way as to keep watchers guessing throughout the whole movie.
I:16748;169;Each emergence of a new plot twist is unexpected and keeps the action going.
I:16748;170;Lee does a good job of keeping viewers on their toes but not allowing viewers to get lost in all that is happening in the scenes.
I:16748;171;inside Man is a thrilling ride that does not have the typical cops versus robber storyline.
I:16748;172;At the end of the movie, i was glad I saw it, but forgot about it the next day, until I decided to write this review.
I:16748;173;Definitely worth watching, maybe even full price if you can afford $20.00, or whatever the full price may be, as I'd actually give it 3.5 stars if I could.
I:16748;174;It kept you attention most of the time.
I:16748;175;"The attempted bank heist scenario is sort of like ""Dog Day Afternoon"" but these crooks are much calmer and better prepared than Al Pacino and company."
I:16748;176;The owner of box 392 is Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), chairman of the bank and a wealthy, respected Jewish man who got rich selling out his fellow Jews to the Nazis during World War II.
I:16748;177;And he does manage to do some things well.
I:16748;178;For example, Lee does an exceptional job of capturing the essence of New York City, in all its foul mouthed, ethnically diverse, hustle and bustle glory.
I:16748;179;Race is always a major theme in Lee's films and here he explores it through several characters representing some of America's lesser known ethnicities, a Sikh, an Albanian, etc.
I:16748;180;I have always appreciated that Lee is one of the leading black voices that speaks up against the media's glamorization of violence and crime in the African.
I:16748;181;But Lee's unique talent and personal style still manage to raise it at least slightly above the typical brainless Hollywood action flick.
I:16748;182;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:16748;183;The mind games being played are very clever, and the intelligence and complexity behind the heist isn't fully realized until the credits start to role.
I:16748;184;Washington was excellent as always, and Owen's acting intrigued so much that I started looking for movies simply because he was in them.
I:16748;185;This movie has such a good cast.
I:16748;186;I love it when I'm surprised at the end.
I:16748;187;Anything this man acts in is always a hit.
I:16748;188;Keeps your attention and makes you part of the adventure.
I:16748;189;"i don't like bank robbery movies, because I'm always thinking ""yeah, right."
I:16748;190;"denzel Washington (""Heart Condition"") is great as always."
I:16748;191;And the guy with the mask on his face that's the lead mask.
I:16748;192;face guy is really good (especially when the mask is off his face).
I:16748;193;Spike Lee's modern take on the bank heist movie is a more effective social commentary than action movie.
I:16748;194;As entertaining and as suspenseful as the movie is, because the market is so full of shocking endings and neat plot twists that you already know that the ending will be something clever, which in itself has become formulaic, at least with movies in recent years.
I:16748;195;What makes this movie fun and socially relevant is the way Lee, in both subtle and not so subtle ways, includes matters of race, redemption, and guilt amidst a story pitting a highly intelligent criminal (Clive Owen) and a detective who has an insatiable desire to uncover the truth (Denzel Washington).
I:16748;196;This really is the kind of movie to watch on a late evening when you want to sit back and be entertained.
I:16748;197;I love a good heist flick and this one didn't disappoint.
I:16748;198;Good acting all around .
I:16748;199;especially the dynamic between the Denzel Washington and Clive Owen characters.
I:16748;200;Lots of fun and a nice addition to my movie library.
I:16748;201;Spike Lee has officially graduated into the mainstream of movies.
I:16748;202;Denzel Washington seems to be one of his favorite to cast and he did an excellent job.
I:16748;203;I think it's worth a go see.
I:16748;204;plot involving Jodie Foster as a top.
I:16748;205;negotiator for the rich and famous, but surprisingly her character was rather minimal and underused.
I:16748;206;There was not much that I really liked about his character or found intriguing or endearing.
I:16748;207;I would not even go as far as saying that it is a film worth watching just to pass time.
I:16748;208;"Gifted director Spike Lee did a brilliant job in coordinating his impressive cast of actors with an intriguing and convoluted script written by novice Russell Gewirtz, in the crime thriller ""Inside Man""."
I:16748;209;the movie concludes with an unexpected interaction between Washington and Owen highlighting the mutual respect each man had for the other.
I:16748;210;This is a terriffic flick, keeps you guessing, and trying to figure out ( like the dective) who and what's going.
I:16748;211;aside, its an interesting two hours of entertainment, sort of a modern.
I:16748;212;day Dog Day Afternoon film.
I:16748;213;All of them are fascinating, thanks in large part to the fact they are all outstanding actors to begin with.
I:16748;214;the more I think about it, the actors here are just as fascinating as the story, if not more so.
I:16748;215;I have said it before, and it remains true: I enjoy every second when I see Denzel Washington on the screen.
I:16748;216;He is about as engaging an actor as there is.
I:16748;217;True, I enjoy some performances more than others and some of the films he is in I can't even work myself up to seeing.
I:16748;218;But when I do, he is always most engaging.
I:16748;219;After all, if Denzel is in it, well, it has to have some redeeming qualities.
I:16748;220;The actors are all very good and give more than fine performances.
I:16748;221;And I think Spike Lee has done a terrific job in putting this film together.
I:16748;222;i have already said that Denzel's performance as Det. Keith Frazier is terrific.
I:16748;223;Jodie Foster is another of my favorites, and she does very well with what she is given here.
I:16748;224;Her character, Madeline White, allows the paranoids in the audience to believe this is how the broader culture actually works and White allows certain points of exposition to happen rather than having any real payoff.
I:16748;225;anyway, a decent heist film while you watch it.
I:16748;226;Spike Lee is the last filmmaker you'd imagine making a slick heist film for a major studio and yet that is exactly what he's done with Inside Man, a cleverly staged and executed thriller.
I:16748;227;And, as if to reassure his fans, Lee has teamed up with Denzel Washington again .
I:16748;228;always a good sign as they work so well together (this being their fourth collaboration).
I:16748;229;He displays the ease and confidence of an actor in top form and is wonderful, as always, to watch.
I:16748;230;Clive Owen is also very good as the ruthless bank robber with a keen intellect.
I:16748;231;It's an interesting role for the actor as he spends a good chunk of the movie with his marquee good looks obscured by a mask.
I:16748;232;"one of the joys of watching Inside Man is seeing all of these A. listers interact with each other
I:16748;233;"The plotting is complex and brilliant as Gewirtz puts a new spin on the ""perfect crime"" while also paying homage to other heist movies like Dog Day Afternoon and Quick Change."
I:16748;234;Best of all, like The Usual Suspects, he ends the film with a delicious twist that is extremely hard to predict.
I:16748;235;Inside Man is a solid, thoroughly entertaining thriller with a brain .
I:16748;236;a rarity in Hollywood these days.
I:16748;237;There is also an amusing scene where Frazier and Mitchell discuss the meaning behind a Bob Marley song and also a collection of local news reports on the bank heist.
I:16748;238;The Making of Inside Man is a pleasant notch above the usual electronic press kit material.
I:16748;239;Also included are excerpts from a cast script read.
I:16748;240;through and rehearsals that sheds a little light on the creative process.
I:16748;241;"in what is quite possibly the most enjoyable extra on this disc, ""Number 4"" is a lively conversation between Lee and Washington about the four films they've done together."
I:16748;242;This is a fun, engaging extra.
I:16748;243;He speaks fondly of the cast without being to sycophantic about it.
I:16748;244;This isn't the chattiest track ever recorded but Lee talks enough to make it worth a listen if you're a fan of the man and his movies.
I:16748;245;frazier (Denzel Washington) is a hostage negotiator whose mission is to manage the situation.
I:16748;246;an engaging storyline and a wonderful soundtrack to boot, this makes for an engaging and entertaining way to spend your day.
I:16748;247;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:16748;248;Nice solid cast, though I think Clive Owen owns this film.
I:16748;249;Not the usual bank caper I was expecting, lots of subtle little twists and surprises to keep this a very interesting movie.
I:16748;250;Well worth watching with a big bowl of popcorn.
I:16748;251;One of my favorite movies with great acting, story and suspense.
I:16748;252;All the main characters are spot on.
I:16748;253;The inside man is modern but has what was great about the golden era of movies.
I:16748;254;Essentially a really clever bank robbery plot, it has a moral peice behind the motivation for the crime and a sense of justice to the whole thing.
I:16748;255;The cast is tremendous including Clive Owen, Denzeil Washington and Jodie Foster who all performed up to their reputations.
I:16748;256;This is a great entertainment experience, there is nothing trendy, nothing weird just a really clever story told by a great story teller in Spike Lee.
I:16748;257;this is a film well worth seeing
I:16748;258;"I have liked Spike Lee's films over the years and found ""Inside Man"" to be a refreshing addition to his long list of excellent films."
I:16748;259;Probably the last thing one would expect of Mr. Lee is that he would direct a thriller, but he has given us one of the best in recent memory.
I:16748;260;"this is a film that keeps you on the edge
I:16748;261;Both Washington and Owen are excellent in their roles and truly convince you that they are a detective and bank robber.
I:16748;262;Jody Foster is also excellent as Madeline White, a kind of corporate enforcer who is hired to look after the interests of wealthy banker Arthur Chase (Christopher Plummer), who has something in a safe deposit box that needs to stay put.
I:16748;263;Ms. Foster plays her roll coolly with the knowledge that she can convince anyone to do what she wants.
I:16748;264;Her character clearly has either good political connections or enough dirt on people to get what she wants when she wants it.
I:16748;265;She manages to twist the Mayor into letting her in to negotiate with Dalton Russell with him clearly being blackmailed into allowing it.
I:16748;266;One wonders how much of his part made it into the final cut.
I:16748;267;Christopher Plummer is also excellent in his characterization of Arthur Chase, who in old age is regretful of what he has done in his past but not about to repent.
I:16748;268;I liked Mr. Plummer's final scene in the film where he is paying Jody Foster for her successfully keeping his name clean.
I:16748;269;When she says more to his face than he likes it is interesting to see Plummer wanting to say something in return but keeping the words to himself.
I:16748;270;the screenplay is the first from Russell Gewirtz and is impressive in the way he always keeps us guessing what is coming next and not resolving the story until the last scene of the film.
I:16748;271;"Like ""The Usual Suspects"" (a far better movie, IMHO) ""Inside Man' relies on a chopped."
I:16748;272;Both the plot and concept of this movie was superb and the acting by all was fantastic the whole idea of this bank robery is conceivable correct.
I:16748;273;Danzel as usual did a great acting job.
I:16748;274;This is a movie that keeps you guessing right until the end.
I:16748;275;Great actors overall in the movie.
I:16748;276;They should have matched the clothes with the real people, and if any two of them climed the same item, one of them is certainly a criminal.
I:16748;277;And the real owner should been easy to spot.
I:16748;278;A surprising but excellent entree from Director Spike Lee.
I:16748;279;Headliners such as Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster and Clive Owens tear up the screen masterfully!
I:16748;280;The premise is farfetched but could carry an entertaining film if handled well.
I:16748;281;as to Jodie Foster, her character was well acted .
I:16748;282;Yes, the mayor was pulling the strings because Lee always has to include an establishment conspiracy.
I:16748;283;"last, there is Lee's penchant for using the ""F"" word as often as possible."
I:16748;284;"Critic Wesley Morris said that Lee instills the film ""with grit, comedy, and a ton of New York ethnic personality."""
I:16748;285;This film proven to be a hit at the box office for filmmaker Spike Lee.
I:16748;286;The cast, for starters, is excellent.
I:16748;287;Seemingly a heist film, this film is more than that and thank god, Lee steers away from his political preaching.
I:16748;288;I think this has to be the cleverest, most fascinating heist movie I've seen.
I:16748;289;It's definitely one I plan to watch again and again!
I:16748;290;It ultimately belnds together for a somewhat satisfying conclusion.
I:16748;291;WOW What a performance by denzel as he delivers in this intense story of a very thought out bank robbery!
I:16748;292;Denzel goes into the lives of the hostages to try and catch the bank robbers and does a great job!
I:16748;293;A must see for all those who like denzel as an actor!
I:16748;294;I loved the movie and Clive Own did great along with Denzel Washington and Gode Foster.
I:16748;295;I saw this movie 2 times and willing to watch it again.
I:16748;296;negotiation film, with Lee's four.
I:16748;297;time leading man, Denzel Washington, in the role of a police negotiator whose personal life is on the edge: at times he has the tactfulness of a falling anvil, and yet he is smart enough to match wits with the heist's mastermind, intensely played by Clive Owen.
I:16748;298;the mechanics and motivations of the heist itself are pretty compelling: this looks like a master plan that could work.
I:16748;299;cast makes the movie and great script, can't ask for much more.
I:16748;300;But everyone has their motives and the interlocking puzzle gets more complex.
I:16748;301;As the story unfolds, each turn becomesmore unpredictable.
I:16748;302;clive Owen is excellent witty robber who's outpacing everyone at every opportunity.
I:16748;303;Detecive Fraizer's urgency in taking Russell to task is well portrayed by Washington.
I:16748;304;Her character's brimming with calm confidence trying to secure a deal with the robber while enriching her own pockets.
I:16748;305;spike Lee's Inside Man is an exciting thrillers with non.
I:16748;306;It cleverly plays out and eventually leaves the audience dazzled and in awe.
I:16748;307;time favorite movies for several reasons.
I:16748;308;First, the cast: Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, and Clive Owen are perfect as the main triangle of personae in this film.
I:16748;309;"Next is the plot
I:16748;310;The even, fast pace of this film will keep your attention.
I:16748;311;It's a thought provoking thriller that will have you guessing until the last scene.
I:16748;312;Jodie Foster has a small role in the film as a broker who works closely with the bank.
I:16748;313;my husband really enjoyed this film but I personally felt let down.
I:16748;314;Jodie's performance is masterful, also, as abeautiful, savvy, facilitator who can help get everyone whatthey want.
I:16748;315;See this nail biter.you can get thisSpike Lee masterpiece at AMAZON.
I:16748;316;Love the action and the plot .
I:16748;317;with a great plot twist I can't hint at without a spoiler.
I:16748;318;The Director's Cut (Widescreen Edition), Denzel Washington ofThe Manchurian Candidate (Special Edition), and Jodie Foster ofFlightplan (Widescreen Edition)deliver the most powerful three characters I've ever seen in one movie.2.
I:16748;319;The movie has an enjoyable social context as it moves between the worlds of the cop, the criminal, and the civilian.
I:16748;320;"Here none of the parties are vilified but all victimized
I:16748;321;"The 2006 movie ""Inside Man"" would appear to have a lot going for it: a tense plot built around a hostage situation in a New York City bank, a handful of first rate actors, and an accomplished director with a real feel for his native city."
I:16748;322;"this movie is strongest in its presentation of ""how things get done"" in NYC, with overtones of racial prejudice, official corruption, and deal."
I:16748;323;The movie's moral punch line is muddied by all the deal.
I:16748;324;I think it was fantastic!I really enjoy the Spike Lee joint movies, especially ones that pair up my main man, Denzel with Spike.
I:16748;325;Shame on your for damaging an otherwise near perfect film!
I:16748;326;The Inside Man captured my attention from start to finish.
I:16748;327;The producer, Spike Lee, did an excellent job in creating this movie.
I:16748;328;Denzel Washington and the man who led the way in breaching the bank stand out as the two main characters highly responsible for the movie's success.
I:16748;329;Denzel Washington is effective as a savvy and courageous hostage negotiator who senses that this is no ordinary heist.
I:16748;330;It's good to see filmmaker Spike Lee come back to form with this highly entertaining popcorn movie that transcends the tense hostage crisis portrayed with a clever plot of psychological gamesmanship and duplicity.
I:16748;331;"At first, the film feels like it's going to be a new millennium update of Sidney Lumet's 1975 classic, ""Dog Day Afternoon"", complete with Terence Blanchard's jazzy, 1970's."
I:16748;332;Rather, the film is far more involved with the characters' motivations and what they are willing to do to move toward resolution.
I:16748;333;How all four characters dance around each other is the primary pleasure to be derived from the movie, as one keeps guessing what each will do to get to his or her objective.
I:16748;334;Moreover, Lee's trademark touches are everywhere from the unexpected sparks of comedy .
I:16748;335;casting is just about ideal here.
I:16748;336;Clive Owen has the most cryptic role as Russell, but he manages to exude supreme confidence and a conflicted conscience with minimal fuss.
I:16748;337;There is nice supporting work by Christopher Plummer expertly shifting between benign and treacherous as Case, Willem Dafoe surprisingly non.
I:16748;338;There is a nice twist at the end, but Gewirtz's script makes it satisfying within the context of the entire plot.
I:16748;339;This is a deft, character.
I:16748;340;driven thriller most welcome during the typical late winter/early spring movie.
I:16748;341;One of Denzel's finest movies, but anything he's in has to be good or better.
I:16748;342;And there's something to do with Nazis and tainted wealth.
I:16748;343;Inside man had a really engaging set.
I:16748;344;His chemistry with Denzel was non.
I:16748;345;Good acting on everyone's part.
I:16748;346;Nice twists and turns along the way with a great ending!
I:16748;347;Good cast, great story and well executed.
I:16748;348;"The really good thing about Spike Lee's ""Inside Man"" is the ensemble of brilliant actors."
I:16748;349;These and many other actors give spectacular performances.
I:16748;350;And speaking of the ending, the last fifteen minutes features two twist endings.
I:16748;351;Spike Lee is an intelligent director, and all of the actors give great performances that no doubt stick out in this movie.
I:16748;352;"I still prefer the film ""Dog Day Afternoon"" (bank heist) and the novel ""Cathedral"" (political corruption and hostage situation)."
I:16748;353;Well acted characters in the roles that they inhabit frequently and comfortably.
I:16748;354;Not breaking any new ground but skillfully executed.
I:16748;355;They refunded my money and everything was great.
I:16748;356;'Inside Man' is the story of a NYPD Detective named Keith Frazier (played by Denzel Washington), struggles to outsmart a clever bank robber (Clive Owen) who, along with a well.
I:16748;357;with an impressive cast that also includes Christopher Plummer and Willem Dafoe, 'Inside Man' is a pretty solid, entertaining and engaging film.
I:16748;358;The acting in 'Inside Man' is a surprise, as for its impressive cast of professional actors are, in a way, unprofessional.
I:16748;359;with an intelligent and new twist on the 'bank robbery' genre, 'Inside Man' does at times surprise and outsmart the viewer.
I:16748;360;Clive Owen's character pulls off a very cool and dangerously clever bank robbery that successfully fools the entire NYPD.
I:16748;361;Others here have told the plot line well.
I:16748;362;I will just add that the early sequences are nicely filmed and the story is immediately engaging.
I:16748;363;Nevertheless, one wonders what the sex.
I:16748;364;Jodi Foster plays a villain, and she does a great job of being truly unlikeable.
I:16748;365;all in all, there are nice plot twists and turns until the end, where it takes too many additional scenes to tie up the loose ends.
I:16748;366;This was another good movie.
I:16748;367;I recommend it to anyone who is a Washington fan.
I:16748;368;I seen this movie on TV and I just loved it you like a crime thriller movies this is the one,it kept me at the edge of my seat.
I:16748;369;I love Denzel Washington's movies.
I:16748;370;Clive Owen is a smart bank robber who has figured out how to out.
I:16748;371;This movie is a clever how is this going to work out?
I:16748;372;I had high hopes that this will be an intelligent movie and it was.
I:16748;373;Denzel Washington has his charm, Clive Owen is calm and cool bank robber, Jodie Foster could have been left out (not really necessary), William Dafoe is a believable NYPD captain (not arrogant).
I:16748;374;The characters acted like real people, there was no arguments between groups and it was refreshing.
I:16748;375;finally a real intelligent crime movie that I haven't seen since Heat (another movie about smart cops and robbers).
I:16748;376;Well, there's a certain truth in that statement.
I:16748;377;The movie depicted a small, but very well.
I:16748;378;Of course, the NYC police, with Denzel Washington in the lead role, responded quickly and moved a small army around the bank.
I:16748;379;The cinema and production values were excellent.
I:16748;380;I throughly enjoyed the action in this movie.
I:16748;381;I found this movie held me until the end with a plot line that left answers until the end.
I:16748;382;Very well executed and acted .
I:16748;383;Great cast of likable actors.
I:16748;384;We enjoyed this movie, especially the twists and some cleverelements in the plot.
I:16748;385;Denzel Washington is great as usual.
I:16748;386;we had actually seen this movie when it first came out,and we still enjoyed it several years later.
I:16748;387;A great cast, engaging story with multiple plot twists and an ending that will have you pulling for the unexpected.
I:16748;388;keeps you guessing how they will get out of the bank.
I:16748;389;Everything about INSIDE MAN makes the viewer want to love this film: Spike Lee as director, a stunning cast, a good musical score that sounds a bit like Bollywood music, a theme that invites social comment.
I:16748;390;for this viewer the terrific ingredients do not add up to a unique suspense thriller of a film.
I:16748;391;denzel Washington is his usual fine acting self, playing a cop with his own demons.
I:16748;392;Chiwetel Ejiofor is solid as his partner.
I:16748;393;Clive Owen spends the better part of the film behind a mask but continues his reputation for quiet and powerful characterizations as the bank robber.
I:16748;394;Christopher Plummer is convincing as the back president with secrets to hide, which Jodie Foster as a middle.
I:16748;395;Willem Defoe is fine as the cop in charge.
I:16748;396;They all perform well in roles they could do in their sleep.
I:16748;397;Love the director and the actors, pass on the film.
I:16748;398;"All this movie is really trying to state to the viewer is that highly successfull White Collar workers are the ""real criminals"" and their criminal actions are what got them their power."
I:16748;399;Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors.
I:16748;400;Jodi Foster also played a great part as she usually does.
I:16748;401;Inside Man features an incredible cast, a great .
I:16748;402;crime thriller script, amazing cinematography and a World Class director named Spike Lee.
I:16748;403;On paper it's a great film.
I:16748;404;that said, Inside Man is a pretty good film.
I:16748;405;Not the classic it should've been, but a solid film that appeals to both the cinephile set and the everyday popcorn movie goer.
I:16748;406;Where fellow auteur types of his generation such as Wes Anderson and Quentin Tarantino seem unable to make anything other than signature films, Lee has done much for his legacy by proving that he can skillfully .
I:16748;407;far most commercially successful film of Lee's career, bringing in almost $200 million at theaters worldwide.
I:16748;408;now, how about those above mentioned problems.
I:16748;409;"And last but not least we have that story telling device we mentioned above, which is best described as a ""In Medias Res"" style, with Owen's character teasing us from the first frame and interrogation scenes edited here and there."
I:16748;410;none), how nicely Lee injects style points here and there, and how downright memorable and well executed a handful of scenes are.
I:16748;411;It's about a detective's last case before retiring and it's about a brilliant criminal.
I:16748;412;It's about Spike Lee, who uses the film to remind us that he's one of the very best of his time.
I:16748;413;This film really shows Spike Lee's brilliance and silences the critics who say that he's too fixated on racial issues.
I:16748;414;It's one of the most intelligently written movies I've seen in a while.
I:16748;415;Beautifully lit settings are a pleasure to watch.
I:16748;416;as usual with these types of films, there are layers of complexity woven into the plot.
I:16748;417;"Let's face it, we're living in the post 9/11 era and Lee's sequence of the ""Arab's"" treatment by the police, in particular, underscores that plainly."
I:16748;418;the magnetic Denzel Washington is again superb (but, really, when does the guy ever suck?)
I:16748;419;He always brings to his role an aura of cool assuredness and a certain stylish bravura.
I:16748;420;His smile, as usual, when directed at potential perpetrators, contains a biting intensity.
I:16748;421;Clive Owen is equally very good as the self.
I:16748;422;His opening lines, as he breaks the fourth wall and speaks to the viewer, makes him an instantly intriguing figure.
I:16748;423;powered transactionist but she does do enough, acting.
I:16748;424;wise, to rouse the audience's curiousity.
I:16748;425;It's a contemplative feature film, a thinking man's thriller with very few action set pieces, though tension is maintained and remains palpable throughout.
I:16748;426;The movie's main selling point is the cast, who makes the most out of this twisty caper premise.
I:16748;427;This complement of actors has got to be Spike Lee's most star powered group yet.
I:16748;428;iNSIDE MAN proves the versatility of Spike Lee as a director as, this time out, he tackles a suspense film and does a more than adequate job.
I:16748;429;driven interplays, even giving his lesser actors time to briefly shine in the spotlight.
I:16748;430;There is one sequence .
I:16748;431;that I thought particularly effective.
I:16748;432;One of my favorite moments in the film is the scene wherein the police, after having solved a puzzle postured by the heist ringleader, continue to humorously argue about the details of the puzzle.
I:16748;433;The best movie Spike Lee ever made.
I:16748;434;the acting and writing are superb
I:16748;435;As someone who loves movies and wants to own them, I know you can do better!
I:16748;436;If not, well enjoy your piracy tax!
I:16748;437;* It's a great detective.
I:16748;438;action movie, a whodunit with good characters and articulate plot twists.
I:16748;439;It's a lot of fun, the cast is as good as they come, the twists and turns in the plot are neat, the dialogue crackles, the direction is crisp, and it's a heist movie, one of the greatest of all subgenres.
I:16748;440;That quibble aside, highly recommended.
I:16748;441;Spike Lee directs and Denzel Washington dazzles in this fast.
I:16748;442;The plot's unexpected twists elevate this above the typical bank heist story.
I:16748;443;This is a thriller that leaves you amazed at the depth of the plot.
I:16748;444;star cast that delivers, like the suspense novel that the reader can't wait to see what happens in the last chapter, with each twist and turn, the viewer will eagerly await the ending.
I:16748;445;i enjoyed the movie except for the f word being used so many times.
I:16748;446;Apart from that, and maybe because of that, it all looks very convincing, though we know very fast what it is all about.
I:16748;447;If you haven't seen it and like a good bank/hostage/mystery kind of movie then you should definitely check it out.
I:16748;448;This really was a great film with an excellent twist at the end.
I:16748;449;I guess it is to be expected of a Denzel movie since he always delivers a great performance.
I:16748;450;As Denzel and the criminal go head to head you will stay on the edge of your seat and be suprised by the twists that occur.
I:16748;451;this one definately gets my seal of approval for a solid enjoyable viewing.
I:16748;452;Inside Man uses magnificent acting and great plotting, with a little of Spike Lee's social commentary thrown in, to move film along at a nice pace.
I:16748;453;With as little action as it has, the movie wastes no time and manages to keep you entertained the whole way through, right up to the end when everything falls together.
I:16748;454;"And as far as the ending: it may not be your typical ""happy ending"" per se, but it'll leave you with a smile on your face."
I:16748;455;watch this one and recommend it to others.
I:16748;456;perhaps a bit like a real.
I:16748;457;Folding back upon itself via the use of flash forwards and dramatized hypotheticals, the film always returns to the present, sometimes, but not always enriched by its wanderings.
I:16748;458;Foster, Washington and the lead hostage taker (played with intelligence and canny reserve by Clive Owen) soon find themselves in a dance of wills and activity.
I:16748;459;spike Lee's cinematography is terrific.
I:16748;460;A long shot of the Brooklyn Bridge is just one of many ornaments to this well.
I:16748;461;The writing and the plot are believable .
I:16748;462;All the criticisms of the film made by others are quite valid.
I:16748;463;I still think the film holds up well on several fronts.1 .
I:16748;464;Jodie Foster's character, with her edgy qualities, is a real departure and a welcome change for this talented actress (even if the script leaves her a bit ineffective).3 .
I:16748;465;The hostage situation is so unusual it keeps the viewer guessing as to what could possibly be going on.
I:16748;466;It's a rare B movie that I would actually happily watch twice.
I:16748;467;The acting was very good.
I:16748;468;Clive's character kept calling this the perfect robbery.
I:16748;469;The characters talk about the relative intelligence of the other characters or how the other characters can't possibly know what is going on.
I:16748;470;For example, a big one is the title of the movie.
I:16748;471;`Inside Man' is a good film.
I:16748;472;Normally this would just annoy me, but the editor managed to do this without wasting a single one of those five second shots, and with great accompanying music it was actually one of my favorite opening sequences ever.
I:16748;473;"clive Owen is great as, a ""not your everyday bank robber,"" he's becoming one of my favorite actors."
I:16748;474;He gives us an incredibly performance in spite of the fact that he's playing a cop for what seams like the 11th time in his past 12 films.
I:16748;475;It's an interesting story with some decent twists and better than average dialogue.
I:16748;476;Chiwetel Ejiofor delivers one of the better performances, yet not his best from his other recent film.
I:16748;477;The dialogue in the movie is good.
I:16748;478;There's some humorous and great lines that come out of the character's mouths.
I:16748;479;The plot is good, and very intriguing.
I:16748;480;There are some things you have to figure out throughout the film, which makes it more interesting.
I:16748;481;aside from minor problems it's a safe bet if you want an enjoyable film and one of Spike Lee's finest.
I:16748;482;"Because ""Inside Man"" has joined their ranks as a film about surrounded criminals with no way out!"
I:16748;483;We must pay strict attention to the happenings inside the bank, especially involving Clive.
I:16748;484;But here's an answer: Spike Lee delivers!
I:16748;485;Inside Man, I am happy to say, kept my attention throughout its running time .
I:16748;486;all the performances are excellent, the direction .
I:16748;487;with one notable exception .
I:16748;488;is solid and the script relentlessly forward.
I:16748;489;Lee employs flashforwards and flashbacks and real time to tell the story.
I:16748;490;it is a taut and suspenseful storytelling .
I:16748;491;a very satisfying movie viewing experience.
I:16748;492;To Spike Lee's credit, like a magician, he keeps things moving so fast you don't latch on to the gaps while watching the movie.
I:16748;493;experience doesn't detract from the fact that this is an excellent piece of movie making.
I:16748;494;great story line, multiple twist and turns.
I:16748;495;Denzel washington, Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer, and Clive Owen did their normal great jobs.
I:16748;496;It's smartly made by director Spike Lee and you never really know where it will go.
I:16748;497;Plus the performances are just top notch.
I:16748;498;"Christopher Plummer's ""also really good"" character owns the bank and hires her to make sure he gets something back that's inside the bank."
I:16748;499;She knows it must be something either valuable or something he just wants knew one to find out about.
I:16748;500;So she's really good as women that people go to get things done and she's also always makes it clear that she's nobodys fool.
I:16748;501;Chiwetel Ejiofor (Four Brothers, Serenity) plays Washington's partner and the two work together well.
I:16748;502;He shows that here too by sharing the screen with Denzel with ease.
I:16748;503;With the cast so good it helps that the script is so clever, interesting and unpredictable.
I:16748;504;This film is really a must see!
I:16748;505;Very interesting and thought provoking story.
I:16748;506;I have viewed this motion picture more than once.
I:16748;507;i know the man has talent and wanted to show Americans that he could switch it up.
I:16748;508;This tightly crafted thriller directed by Spike Lee kept my husband and me enthralled from beginning to end.
I:16748;509;Denzel Washington is one of my favorites, and here he plays a slightly scruffy, smart, wisecracking detective.
I:16748;510;He gets off a few great one.
I:16748;511;"jodie Foster is marvelous as a shadowy ""fixer"" of problems."
I:16748;512;and a clever one it is.
I:16748;513;scripted and a fun ride.
I:16748;514;One of the best shows I have seen in a while.
I:16748;515;Denzil Wasington and Clive Owen are very good.
I:16748;516;Good acting by clive owen and denzel washington, jodi foster and the entire supporting cast.
I:16748;517;I was at first kind of skeptical about seeing this movie when it was released in theaters, but I was pleasantly surprised by how excellent this movie is!!!
I:16748;518;The acting was superb and best of all it kept you guessing the entire movie about what was going on!!!
I:16748;519;I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
I:16748;520;star reviews have it right for me.
I:16748;521;Short summary: fascinating bank heist with some unusual and very clever twists, Denzel is terrific, Jodie Foster's role is unnecessary, Christopher Plummer is oddly one.
I:16748;522;You either enjoyed it, liked the cast, the premise, didn't regret the time or money spent.
I:16748;523;I really liked the movie.
I:16748;524;it moved, it twisted, it sometimes contorted.
I:16748;525;A Must See, i definately Enjoyed this movie, some of Denzel's finer work, and Clive Owen was one of the better thiefs of the former year.
I:16748;526;but the setting is perfect in New York City with the NYPD.
I:16748;527;Will be a classic im sure of it.
I:16748;528;And that's a good thing, because this is a very smart film that throws constant plot twists while always staying true to what's going on.
I:16748;529;"Back in the 70's ""Dog Day Afternoon"" pretty much wrote the book on those kinds of movies and how they should be
I:16748;530;The ending is really smartly done and believable in the context of the film.
I:16748;531;This is entertaining, smart, and very good.
I:16748;532;This is another great Denzel Washington movie with a great supporting cast in Jodie Foster and Clive Owen (One of Clive Owen's bet roles).
I:16748;533;Otherwise, this is a great movie.
I:16748;534;An outstanding thriller that you won't want to miss.
I:16748;535;Spike Lee shows hius genius with this one.
I:16748;536;If you're looking for a fun, well.
I:16748;537;It retains all the elements of a solid caper film, basking in the smarts of the old police caper genre and leaves us with something greater than forced twists and clich?
I:16748;538;the movie starts out with full confidence in holding the audience's attention.
I:16748;539;Both men are smart, naturally.
I:16748;540;Suspense, as we've come to expect, evolves from watching and wondering who's outguessing who.
I:16748;541;at the core of Inside Man is a sharp caper/thriller that's well.
I:16748;542;"This thriller about the perfect bank robbery, wherein both the cops and the robbers are genuinely smart and motivated, yet not superhuman nor without humanity, gets as close to ""excellent"" as any similarly concerned Hollywood feature has come in the past decade or so."
I:16748;543;time Spike Lee favorite, fits right in as the streetwise cop, who doesn't necessarily play by the rules but gets the job done.
I:16748;544;He and Ejiofor have a nice, easy.
I:16748;545;nonsense guy you empathize with, who can look straight into the camera and tell it like it is.
I:16748;546;It looks like she had a lot of fun doing it, too, in her smart, three.
I:16748;547;piece suit and subtle smirks.
I:16748;548;inside Man, right up to its very title, is multi.
I:16748;549;layered on top of it's already many surfaced layers.
I:16748;550;The final scene where Washington stares down the past and his own future in his very hand is a brilliant summation on the lengths we can go to for personal happiness and success.
I:16748;551;but as long as you could watch it and don't have the urge to stand up and leave, it means that this is a very good movie, so good that could hold you tight on your seat.
I:16748;552;Inside Man presents us with the story of a brilliant criminal mastermind (Clive Owen) who has devised the perfect bank robbery and subsequent escape without being caught by the law.
I:16748;553;Inside Man was a wonderfully constructed cat.
I:16748;554;mouse thriller that was completely engrossing and a genuine surprise to me, and was by far the most mainstream Spike Lee movie to date.
I:16748;555;The story was well paced, full of twists.
I:16748;556;turns that you don't see coming, and the dialogue was so well.
I:16748;557;written and at times an absolute joy to listen to, especially the many exchanges between Denzel Washington and Clive Owen's characters.
I:16748;558;The acting was terrific from all actors involved, each actor was given so much to work with, which is often a rarity in an ensemble piece like this one, where there are so many A. list actors gathered in one film, generally one or two of them get shorted on development.
I:16748;559;A lot of the fun I had in watching this movie was trying to figure out the various motives every character had or which side they were truly on, so many of the characters had hidden agendas you really didn't know what to expect from any of them, which made the experience all the more enjoyable for me.
I:16748;560;Great movie, great acting, fantastic ending.
I:16748;561;Denzel Washington is a great actor.
I:16748;562;Denzel is great in this movie, as he is in them all.
I:16748;563;The plot is a little far fetched, but worth the watch.
I:16748;564;My husband caught part of this on TV and gushed to me how he had loved it in the theater years ago.
I:16748;565;He was surprised and happy.
I:16748;566;Great plot, great direction, great acting, and great cinematography.
I:16748;567;It was good, but was hoping for more from Spike Lee and Denzel.
I:16748;568;So many twist and turns kept me on the edge of my seat.
I:16748;569;I would recommend to everyone!
I:16748;570;His movies usually have very strong social commentaries, and nothing more than that.
I:16748;571;Those social commentaries though are usually the same thing, and it always has to deal with race.
I:16748;572;Inside Man is really his first movie that really focuses on the narrative and is intent on telling an entertaining story.
I:16748;573;The film is his most mainstream film to date, and in my opinion is his best.
I:16748;574;As the story progresses we learn more of what the true purpose of this bank heist is.
I:16748;575;The film is quick, superbly edited, and extremely entertaining.
I:16748;576;Race and politics become the underlaying theme for the film and it moves it in the right direction.
I:16748;577;All the reviews and ads talk about the twist ending and a plot full of surprises.
I:16748;578;There are some surprises that will make you grin with shame becaue you didn't see them coming, and those are always fun.
I:16748;579;It's a really well put together piece of filmmaking.
I:16748;580;Sharp dialogue, light tone, and great entertainment make Inside Man a joint worth passing to the next person.
I:16748;581;aCTING: This is the dream cast that any director would kill for.
I:16748;582;The cast is so experienced that they make it look easy to pull off roles like these.
I:16748;583;The characters feel natural and real, and are emotionally involving.
I:16748;584;bOTTOM LINE: Spike Lee proves himself to be a great storyteller.
I:16748;585;He focuses on the important things and highlights them with his personal touches.
I:16748;586;"He even has his trademark ""floaty camera"" technique, which he uses to show determination on Denzel Washington's character's part."
I:16748;587;Even the opening titles and credits are done with style.
I:16748;588;He uses a very catchy song for the opening and closing credits that sets the perfect tone for the film.
I:16748;589;Inside Man is a tightly woven piece of filmmaking, and is worth your time
I:16748;590;Great intrigue and hard to figure who is really part of the bad guys.
I:16748;591;actors who serve the plot very well.
I:16748;592;I was entertained by this movie.
I:16748;593;It had suspense, action and an enigma at the heart of the movie.
I:16748;594;What kept me riveted were the performances of the central actors .
I:16748;595;Jodie Foster, Denzel Washington, etc. as well as the various moral ambiguities and twists and turns.
I:16748;596;There is an interview with Spike Lee and Denzel Washinton, a kind of retrospective of the movies they've made together, the challenges, the experiences they went through.
I:16748;597;THat was fascinating to view.
I:16748;598;also, Spike Lee's commentary (if you choose that option) is also well worth hearing.
I:16748;599;He is a brilliant filmaker and his insights about how he composed various shots, how he envisioned this film, etc. offer much to budding scriptwriters, film students, actors or people who simply like to watch movies, even if they never want to be a part of a film crew.
I:16748;600;In a heartbeat but only for the pleasure of watching the actors and actresses in this one.
I:16748;601;The end of this movie isn't shocking but it's pretty darn good and it actually helps everyone get what they want.
I:16748;602;There's not much to say about Inside Man except amazing directing by Spike, amazing acting from everybody and a job well done on taking a mediocre script and turning it into something more.
I:16748;603;Another well written, well acted suspense story.
I:16748;604;Nothing all that new or intriguing but a good escape on a quiet evening.
I:16748;605;It was an overall good movie.
I:16748;606;It was very entertaining, and in my opinion a great heist thriller.
I:16748;607;I'm one who enjoyed THE 25th HOUR and SUMMER OF SAM and to me, INSIDE MAN didn't hold up to the high standard of the other movies.
I:16748;608;However it is still an extremely fun ride and two of the actors, Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster, deliver fantastic performances.
I:16748;609;In his home life he is living with an extraordinarily sexy colleague whose young brother's a crackhead and lives in a cot together with them in a too.
I:16748;610;I for one would enjoy seeing him and his partner solving another case, pitting against another super villain.
I:16748;611;It's excellent that Foster seems to be returning to films in a big way, what with this, FLIGHT PLAN, that French movie, and upcoming a new picture with Terrence Howard.
I:16748;612;She's playing a woman who likes men, a lot of men, a lot of dangerous men.
I:16748;613;If you enjoy twists and turns this is for you.
I:16748;614;The movie is fast paced and keeps you guessing.
I:16748;615;Denzel Washington and supporting characters are well done and interesting.
I:16748;616;star cast, direction with the artistry characteristic of a Spike Lee joint, and a plot with so many twists and turns it was hard to guess the ending, Inside Man is an above.
I:16748;617;star cast are the most stellar parts of this film and they are reason enough to give it a chance.
I:16748;618;It has a great cast and plot.
I:16748;619;Good cast, great actin, good performance.
I:16748;620;keeps you guessin`Is the kind of story I enjoy readin`more than watching the movie.
I:16748;621;This is one of the best suspense movies of the year.
I:16748;622;The plot is so clever that you never guess where it is going until the end.
I:16748;623;The acting is superb, by a fantastic cast, and the director did an outstanding job of bringing these bing names together.
I:16748;624;highly recommended for those seeking more than your average action thriller.
I:16748;625;time Oscar winner) as Madeline White, brilliantly lead the all.
I:16748;626;star cast that also features Christopher Plummer, Willem Dafoe (two.
I:16748;627;time Oscar nominee), and Chiwetel Ejiofor!
I:16748;628;One of the year's best!
I:16748;629;time Oscar nominee) directing is excellent (This is the fourth movie with Denzel), this is one of his best films to date!
I:16748;630;The story and screenplay by Russell Gewirtz is brilliant!
I:16748;631;The music by Terence Blanchard (the composer that Lee has worked with for nearly all of his films) is brilliant!
I:16748;632;"The cinematography by Matthew Libatique (who did the cinematography to Lee's ""She Hate Me"" (2004) is excellent!"
I:16748;633;The film editing by Barry Alexander Brown (the editor that Lee has worked for nearly all of his films) is excellent!
I:16748;634;"The casting by Kim Coleman (who did the casting to Lee's ""She Hate Me"" (2004) is excellent!"
I:16748;635;"The production design by Wynn Thomas (who has done the production design to 5 of Lee's movies, most recently ""The Original Kings of Comedy"" (2000) is excellent!"
I:16748;636;"The art direction by Chris Shriver (one of the art directors on Lee's ""Malcolm X"" (1992) is excellent!"
I:16748;637;The set decoration by George DeTitta Jr. is excellent!
I:16748;638;"The costume design by Donna Berwick (who did the costume design to Lee's ""She Hate Me"" (2004) is excellent!"
I:16748;639;This is one of the intelligent, brilliant crime thrillers in years!
I:16748;640;This is smart, imaginative, and well.
I:16748;641;Pay strict attention to what I say because I choose my words carefully and I never repeat myself.It is so great to go to a movie and have it fulfill high expectations for one.
I:16748;642;it takes Frazier a while to catch on that the guy in charge inside the bank is the smartest one in the game (or, at the very least, he has all of the angles figured out).
I:16748;643;face with the masked man in the bank she knows that this guy is so far ahead of her she is never going to catch up.
I:16748;644;But a key thing here is that these are smart people, capable of making mistakes but also able to make the necessary connections that lead to explaining what the hell is going on here.
I:16748;645;The whole point is to beat them at their best.
I:16748;646;Things really move in this one and you never get the sense of it being a drawn out hostage crisis.
I:16748;647;But this is just one of several insidious red herrings, some of which are brilliantly put in the commercials.
I:16748;648;Washington makes wearing a hat look good again and while the character Owen plays requires him to do the same sort of barely modulated monotone he always seems to be doing it is Foster who has the most fun playing a role without a scintilla of the vulnerability that are her trademark and reminding us there is a level beyond the b. word.
I:16748;649;She has the cold smile of a snake down pretty good.
I:16748;650;I thoguht this movie was really good with its casting.
I:16748;651;I also loved the street the bank was on was nice because it was empty and devoid of all color.
I:16748;652;Jodie Foster is smart and looks wonderful.
I:16748;653;it is still an entertaining movie but don't expect to be dazzled.
I:16748;654;Besides the great story, the acting, the cinematography then there is the music.
I:16748;655;A few scenes are particularly memorable, such as the scene in which Owen's character instructs the police to focus their cameras on the second floor window.
I:16748;656;Wow, that was shocking and eerie.
I:16748;657;Lee has not been one of my favorite directors, but I love this movie, especially his attention to detail.
I:16748;658;I really liked the camerawork in the beginning, with closeups of statues and signs.
I:16748;659;Interesting soundtrack too, beginning and ending with an exotic Indian song that alludes to the multiculturalism of the setting and cast.
I:16748;660;Denzel all was play in good movies this one was smart mine games going on tricks and all the above and it was a great movie too love it
I:16748;661;Great movie, very good acting.
I:16748;662;It was a little corny but intertaining lots of good actors.
I:16748;663;Lots of action and a nice twist at the end
I:16748;664;As expected, Denzel Washington is in excellent form.
I:16748;665;"Washington was eerily on point in ""Malcolm X"", smoothly sensual in ""Mo Better Blues"", and so intense in ""Training Day"" that he made me want to marry a thug!In this flick, he exhibits everything that makes Denzel a master at his craft."
I:16748;666;While I'm not a fan of director Spike Lee's choice of projects over the years, I find his crisp cinematography, inventive camera angles, intelligent editing, and moving jazzy soundtracks very impressive and a dominant thread in all of his films.
I:16748;667;"she just coasted through the film, with overtones of Clarice in ""Silence of the Lambs""."
I:16748;668;As for Clive Owen, this is the best that I have ever seen him, as charismatic and sympathetic as Hannibal Lechter.
I:16748;669;Chiwetel Ejiofor holds his own against the dominant Washington, giving the star the requisite amount of support and respect.
I:16748;670;She had one film role before this and IT SHOWS!
I:16748;671;She is a full THIRTY YEARS YOUNGER than Washington!
I:16748;672;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:16748;673;It kept you guessing just when you thought you had it figured out.
I:16748;674;The acting and directing were fantastic.
I:16748;675;Excellent and thought provoking thriller.
I:16748;676;this movie is well done and a must see!
I:16748;677;Breaking up a bank CEO's longtime connection to Nazi treasure?
I:16748;678;Thinly portrayed is Washington's love interest, and he just doesn't have a foil (not Jody Foster although I liked her character) to propel his actions and words.
I:16748;679;In fact, Washington's acting persona puts one in mind that the man is thinking about his dinner date or next holiday in Cannes.
I:16748;680;I was pretty doubtful upon seeing that this movie was directed by Spike Lee, I have seen some of his early films and found them to be unsatisfactory.
I:16748;681;Good Movie , I thought this movie was good with a good story behind it .
I:16748;682;The robbers are always one move ahead of the Police Department and keep control of the situation.
I:16748;683;It is a tense situation, and the robbers have the power.
I:16748;684;She has connections with the Mayor and asks him for access.
I:16748;685;overall the movie is an energetic, witty, enjoyable thriller that weaves throughout Spike Lee's familiar touching on race, power and class issues.
I:16748;686;This was a pretty good movie.
I:16748;687;I enjoyed the story line.
I:16748;688;Looked like Jodie Foster had a good time playing a character against type.
I:16748;689;Just a great movie with great acting !!!!
I:16748;690;this movie was under advertised but was recommended by a friend.
I:16748;691;Inside Man is original and has an unique plot that's believable.
I:16748;692;Inside Man is A Great Heist Movie!!!
I:16748;693;Do I love to be kept at the edge of my seat, and thou this was like the third time me watching this movie, did the same to me.
I:16748;694;Denzell Is one of my favorite actors this was suspenseful and just exciting to watch could have did this one any better
I:16748;695;Throw Jodie Foster into the mix as a mysterious problem solver of sorts, and you end up with a very entertaining movie.
I:16748;696;"It's much more refreshing than the so. called ""thrillers"" Hollywood has been cranking out recently, so that in itself is a relief."
I:16748;697;This is an entertaining film with a lot of great one.
I:16748;698;liners and an excellent cast.
I:16748;699;Dalton Russell tells views in the beginning that he's going to reveal everything once only, and that the viewer had better keep up.
I:16748;700;Frazier knows early on that this isn't a typical .
I:16748;701;The director has had a string of movies, choosing material that he wanted to work with.
I:16748;702;Denzel has been in MAN ON FIRE, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, OUT OF TIME, RICOCHET, JOHN Q, TRAINING DAY, THE BONE COLLECTOR, THE SIEGE, DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS, and CRIMSON TIDE, all of which might be of interest to viewers of this film.
I:16748;703;Clive Owen has begun a successful American film career after enjoying one in England for several years.
I:16748;704;The suspense mounts slowly, and the ending comes together in a manner that is almost anti.
I:16748;705;The mood and atmosphere play out nicely, with enough characters introduced to make the situation even more complicated.
I:16748;706;It's easy to watch and is entertaining in a what's.
I:16748;707;on way more than a thrill.
I:16748;708;up and gentle, uncompressed storytelling.
I:16748;709;once the movie is over, though, a thinking viewer will see a tremendous amount of plotholes as well as scenes that were actually distractions from the plot and red herrings to the mystery solvers.
I:16748;710;iNSIDE MAN is a good movie for an evening home with a buddy who loves movies, or with a spouse.
I:16748;711;Fans of Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, and Clive Own can see their stars in some of the best on.
I:16748;712;"spike Lee, director of the sublime ""Malcolm X"" directs this film, ""Inside Man,"" basically a bank heist film, and elevates it to, if not Art, then to a mostly exciting, well crafted thriller with terrific performances by the always reliable Denzel as NYC Hostage Negotiator, Keith Frazier and Clive Owen as Bank Robber, Dalton Russell."
I:16748;713;"directing from a good script by Russell Gewirtz, ""Inside Man"" is a fun, interesting, well."
I:16748;714;made popular entertainment that almost always keeps your mind and eyes interested.
I:16748;715;In the meantime the Bank's CEO (Christopher Plummer) is meeting with Jodie Foster.
I:16748;716;Also the movie has some interesting directing and story telling which seems to go back and forth between the hostage standoff and interviews with people that were in the bank after everything was resolved.
I:16748;717;washington and Owen both give brilliant performances and Willem DaFoe is excellent in a supporting role.
I:16748;718;It is a well conceived and brilliantly executed movie.
I:16748;719;There is something within the bank that holds value to Plummer which if it gets out could probably ruin Plummer.
I:16748;720;I dont wanna give away any more details just go see this great movie for yourselves.
I:16748;721;Denzel is back in top form.
I:16748;722;He hasnt made a movie since The Manchurian Candidate and he gives a blazing performance as usual.
I:16748;723;Hes a force to be reckoned here.
I:16748;724;One of the best movies so far to come out this year, well that's what I think
I:16748;725;This is one of the most successful boxoffice films for the formidable director Spike Lee.
I:16748;726;They are excellent in their roles in this unusual heist film which ultimately turns into a hostage situation for something more than money.
I:16748;727;lee's direction is crisp and on target.
I:16748;728;This is one of those movies where you pick up something new during every viewing.
I:16748;729;The cast is really great.
I:16748;730;and the script is smart.
I:16748;731;And all those movies are about walking around outside, while Inside Man is well walking around in a bank.
I:16748;732;Which I can say is the story here.
I:16748;733;A really engrossing heist movie where nothing is as it seems.
I:16748;734;if anything, Spike Lee is a good director.
I:16748;735;Good news, it's a great thriller that finally reunites him with Washington, and casts plenty of famous white actors/actresses (including Willem Dafoe, Foster, Owen, and Plummer) in memorable roles.
I:16748;736;Inside Man touches on plenty of topics, one of many is Lee's trademark .
I:16748;737;there are also plenty of twists.
I:16748;738;Washington once again pulls in another powerhouse performance playing Keith Frazier.
I:16748;739;He keeps dropping monologues, stays even.
I:16748;740;mouse games with Owen's bank robber, and shares some often humorous chemistry with Ejiofor (another great African.
I:16748;741;He shares equal chemistry shared with other stars, such as Foster (doing another impressive job as another female protagonist), Dafoe, and Plummer.
I:16748;742;back in the day Spike Lee was happening,but it's been so long since he has made a film that has truly held my full attention.
I:16748;743;One of those movies that stays with you and makes you think.
I:16748;744;Superb acting and plot twists.
I:16748;745;One of the best movies out there!
I:16748;746;and this movie proves it!
I:16748;747;The story has many turns and keeps you on the edge.
I:16748;748;Denzel Washington is really, really good in this film.
I:16748;749;It is one of his best performances in a long while.
I:16748;750;Clive Owen is good as usual and Jodie Foster makes the most out of her small role.
I:16748;751;Inside Man also boasts a clever story with realistic dialogue (you won't get any Tarantino lines here), some of which had the theater laughing in a good way.
I:16748;752;This is one of the few Spike Lee films that I enjoyed from beginning to end.
I:16748;753;"Spike Lee has created an imaginative and gripping thriller with ""Inside Man""."
I:16748;754;Collecting some of the biggest names on screen, Lee has put together a film that has both the thrills and twists to entertain, and the comments on society to give something more when the credits have rolled by.
I:16748;755;"plots of Arthur Case, who has a lot to lose in this robbery, and Madeleine White, a type of ""discrete"" agent with some less than legal influence, and you have a complex story line that gives you enough to think about to cope with a couple of viewings."
I:16748;756;the names filling the credits are impressive, making the movie all the more enjoyable.
I:16748;757;, Christopher Plummer, (Case, and Willem Dafoe all make this movie special in their own ways.
I:16748;758;They are all top grade actors with the skills to make the story live.
I:16748;759;the social commentary is present all through the film at varying levels.
I:16748;760;this is one of the best films I have seen recently and is a movie that has given me lots to think about and consider.
I:16748;761;It is powerful in its twists, well.
I:16748;762;acted and very well executed in all aspects.
I:16748;763;One of the most creative scripts in years.
I:16748;764;lots of action, the plot was good, actors and actresses, just an all around good movie and I would recommend it to anyone.
I:16748;765;With a cast of some of my favorite actors, Denzel, Clive, Jodie and Christopher Plummer.
I:16748;766;This thriller was worth every penny to see on the big screen!
I:16748;767;"the plot was so totally slick and the actors all fit their parts perfectly, from Clive the mastermind of an ingenius theft
I:16748;768;an absolutly slick and twisty ending.
I:16748;769;life example for closure, that always keeps me a little away from full acceptance, because Lee is otherwise so good at characterizing beyond the screen.
I:16748;770;many of his characters exist in a wonderful netherworld of being familiar and gritty while maintaining purpose in the movie.
I:16748;771;And I maintain that Lee will make something that is no less than one of the top 10 movies of ALL TIME if he is finally able to let go of cinematic closure and instead let the closure take place in the audience.
I:16748;772;this movie works pretty much on the typical Lee paradigm.
I:16748;773;the film is wonderfully off.
I:16748;774;kilter in how it presents criminals and villains and heroes.
I:16748;775;This film outdoes great depictions of criminal genius like _The Usual Suspects_ and others, for the nature and details of the crime are not all held to the very end.
I:16748;776;For 7/8 of the movie, you will most likely be kept guessing and even laughing in disbelief, for this is no ordinary crime drama, and Washington of course enlivens his character into a depth few actors can reach.
I:16748;777;It would seem that a situation as wonderfully complex and intricate as Lee builds for and hour and forty.
I:16748;778;THis is a good movie, it kept my interest throughout the entire movie.
I:16748;779;Its very interesting how these robbers try to pull off the perfect robbery.
I:16748;780;I highly recommend this movie.
I:16748;781;Clive Owen and Denzel Washington was excellent in this movie.
I:16748;782;"Denzel Washington is terrific as a rookie detective wise beyond his station
I:16748;783;The rest of the cast is just as good, and Spike Lee's directing keeps the tangled story clear with contextual cinematography.
I:16748;784;It's all handled with a light touch, too.
I:16748;785;Clive Owen, Denzel Washington, Jodi Foster and rest of cast, fantastic.
I:16748;786;my wife and son felt the same, all 3 of us couldn't wait for the movie to end, very strange considering we all loved it on the big screen.
I:16748;787;Denzel Washington is always one of my favorites.
I:16748;788;Great plot with a super twist!
I:16748;789;I was expecting something more brilliant than what was presented here.
I:16748;790;Foster was good, wouldn't mind having her job.
I:16748;791;I can rarely tell those characters apart.
I:16748;792;Russell outwits Frazier at every step and this creates a tension that is hugely entertaining to watch.
I:16748;793;Chiwetel Ejiofor, one of my favourite actors, moving a couple more steps up his destined career ladder, puts on a convincing American accent (though maybe not quite a New York one) as Washington's keen and respectful sidekick.
I:16748;794;and just to make things even more interesting, enter Jodie Foster as mysterious power broker Madeline White, looking as slinky and sexy as I've ever seen her and with an agenda that seems only clear to her.
I:16748;795;It's a great story with many twists and turns and an ending that no one could possibly foresee.
I:16748;796;Spike Lee does an excellent job directing this movie and though he has had a number of culturally iconic successes in the past, this is the first movie I've seen where he directs and directs only.
I:16748;797;I think this one could be his most commercially successful as a result.
I:16748;798;a stellar support cast, including Christopher Plummer, Willem Defoe, Carlos Andres Gomez and the incomparable Peter Gerety make this a very watchable movie.
I:16748;799;Even if it's only to finally be able to make complete sense of the storyline, this is a movie worth watching over and over.
I:16748;800;I've come to expect exciting movies from this guy.
I:16748;801;It is delivered here, but is some distance from his best.
I:16748;802;I found it kind of ironic that in Inside Man the characters speak of Dog Day Afternoon.
I:16748;803;Some guys hold up a bank and you have an all day stand.
I:16748;804;Extraordinary screenplay with more twists and turns than a Hitchcock classic.
I:16748;805;Haunting and unforgettable music score.
I:16748;806;Realistic, but biting NYC society culture from beat cop to billionaires with the right dash of political cynicism and historical context.
I:16748;807;Witty dialogue with numerous quotable lines.
I:16748;808;Complex but enjoyable and memorable characters played with a deft touch.
I:16748;809;All brought together by a most gifted director who despite critical acclaim for trendy art pieces shows the pros how its done in a classic genre.
I:16748;810;$184M worldwide grosses with less than 50% in the U. s. 4 actors and the director with prior Oscar nominations and two with wins.
I:16748;811;Zero Oscar nominations for Inside Man while Little Miss Sunshine garners Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress nominations.
I:16748;812;I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys action movies, explosions, and the excitement of a well done heist.
I:16748;813;I found the movie engrossing from start to finish.
I:16748;814;Clive Owen's performance and his interaction with Denzel Washington were highlights in a well crafted thriller.
I:16748;815;jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer were perfect in their parts and Spike Lee's direction resulted in a well paced tale.
I:16748;816;Because despite being directed by a patent race.
I:16748;817;baiter, Spike Lee, the movie is outstanding.
I:16748;818;When even the Wall Street Journal praises it, then it has to be good.
I:16748;819;The whole premise of the story, with its twists and turns, keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:16748;820;The movie is superbly crafted and flawlessly executed right down to the closing credits use of a catchy Indian pop song.
I:16748;821;The camera work does a great job of using New York's financial district architecture to set the back drop for the movie.
I:16748;822;As others have indicated, if you think you have it figured out, you will be totally surprised before the end.
I:16748;823;The acting is very well done.
I:16748;824;Its use is so over the top that it takes away from everything else.
I:16748;825;This film has a twist ending.
I:16748;826;The police show up in full force, led by Detectives Keith Frazier, played by Denzel Washington, and Bill Mitchell, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor.
I:16748;827;All the while, Owen's and Washington's characters begin to bond and chat somewhat amicably.
I:16748;828;As far as suspense films go, this is top.
I:16748;829;All of the cast are flawless and my only complaint is that this film isn't longer.
I:16748;830;But perhaps it's set at just the right amount of time.
I:16748;831;good cast, plot and execution.
I:16748;832;wlii watch and reccommend as a classic Denzel film.
I:16748;833;My husband saw this movie some time ago and had it hyped up quite a bit, but all in all it was good.
I:16748;834;This movie is incredibly well told and directed by Spike Lee.
I:16748;835;It also has as an amazing ensemble cast.
I:16748;836;Very entertaining, time and time again.
I:16748;837;I have seen almost all his movies and I think this was among his best.
I:16748;838;rich cliche, this would be tremendous, but it's excellent, and no other director could have made this movie as well as Spike Lee.
I:16748;839;Intelligent, entertaining film with plenty of twists.
I:16748;840;If you like action, shooting, explosions, fire, pain, torture and revenge, this is a movie you'll love.
I:16748;841;And, it stars one of the best actors in the world who is completely believeable in this role.
I:16748;842;A great storyline with intriguing twists plus situations and settings that are very close to reality.
I:16748;843;Awesome movie with a good twist!!
I:16748;844;You think you know what the ending might be, yet you'll be surprised.
I:16748;845;It definitely keeps you on your toes wondering who, when, where, what.
I:16748;846;While Denzel turns in a decent performance as always it is far short of his best work.
I:16748;847;Jodie Foster is a pleasure as an icy cool hard as nails *itch.
I:16748;848;A departure for her that Im sure she enjoyed.
I:16748;849;"Interesting story that moves briskly to keep one's interest
I:16748;850;Wonderful Plot and great acting!
I:16748;851;The movie plot was excellent and the actors were supurb.
I:16748;852;There definitely was some thought behind this unusual movie.
I:16748;853;This movie is brillient all the way through, great plot, great acting between Denzil Washington and Clive Owen, interesting twists, really proves that a movie can have a slightly smaller cast but have a more complex plot and have amazing relationships between characters and an ending that was perfect.
I:16748;854;It's amazing how much he fits into his role.
I:16748;855;sometimes I rate something 5/5 because I like it and don't have problems, and sometimes I rate it 5/5 because I love it and consider it masterful, this is the latter.
I:16748;856;The latest Spike Lee Joint, Inside Man, is the best bank heist movie since Pacino's Dog Day Afternoon.
I:16748;857;"It's a mystery
I:16748;858;It's about a bank robbery, but Denzel steals the film.
I:16748;859;Whenever he gets together with Spike, you tend to just let them work their magic.
I:16748;860;Lee really captures the raw grit and emotion of the streets of New York and its people, post 9/11.
I:16748;861;It's summer time here and it is hot in the afternoon.
I:16748;862;So we tend to go to the theatre a bit more during the summer, and use their air conditioning.
I:16748;863;it is a worthwhile action movie with enough twists to laugh and be puzzled about.
I:16748;864;I missed the main point despite it being pretty obvious (not jail but the hidding place), didn't see the diamond pass off coming but certainly laughed when it happened.
I:16748;865;Which is my general reaction to the movie, i laughed and enjoyed the plot and twists, got them mostly after the fact, rather then predicting them, which i appreciate.
I:16748;866;Making the goal elusive yet highly moral with Jodie Foster in the employ of a bad guy with a bad conscience really helps for the realistic believability of the plot.
I:16748;867;, something that often disturbs detective cop type movies in the final analysis.
I:16748;868;it's good, mind involving entertainment, with a few interesting questions brought up but not really followed(expiation of guilt), the plot twists and action being the main big point.
I:16748;869;And this really is a film that would be more enjoyable the less one knows about it.
I:16748;870;So let me cut to the chase if you haven't seen this but are tempted: it will be worth your time.
I:16748;871;The point here is to tell a great yarn and there is little question the film succeeds wonderfully.
I:16748;872;denzel Washington is, well, Denzel Washington.
I:16748;873;He is one of the finest actors of his generation and while this is not one of his best performances, it is one of his typical ones.
I:16748;874;Clive Owen is spectacular as the head of the group taking over the bank.
I:16748;875;He is an enormously gifted performer and ever since seeing him in THE CROUPIER I have been waiting to see his career explode.
I:16748;876;He has one of the great gazes in the movies, and one of those performers who seems to glide between being congenial to utterly threatening in a matter of seconds.
I:16748;877;Jodie Foster is a great actress, but though she is enormously competent in her part, it really isn't one designed to let her shine.
I:16748;878;This is a wonderfully constructed, deliciously complex script.
I:16748;879;This is not a film that will win any awards, but it a thoroughly entertaining film that I hope will be a prelude to better things to come out of Hollywood this year.
I:16748;880;I have seen most of Spike Lee's previous films, admiring some more than others.
I:16748;881;That said, I think his Inside Man is very, very good in most respects.
I:16748;882;Four compelling screen actors so thoroughly inhabit the characters entrusted to them that .
I:16748;883;I also admire Lee's juxtaposition of volatile plot developments with moments of quiet, almost lyrical reflection.
I:16748;884;dimensional plot featuring the robbery itself as well as high.
I:16748;885;level power brokering within and beyond the NYPD and even City Hall.
I:16748;886;Lee and Gewitz share the credit for this.
I:16748;887;I think it is unique, albeit comparable with L. a. Confidential, Heat, and Pulp Fiction in terms of its brilliant examination of cultural ambiguities.
I:16748;888;as for the last Star, whether or not those who see this film share Lee's perspectives on race relations, whether or not they share his social values, I suggest that he is wholly consistent with those perspectives and values while exploring in this film a multiple of interpersonal relationships which include but are not .
I:16748;889;By the end of this film, however, we realize that Lee's primary purpose is to tell an entertaining, at times compelling story rather than to exploit the on.
I:16748;890;Inside Man is a cleverly made and action packed movie.
I:16748;891;It was cool to see Denzel Washington play his role smoothly, yet powerfully.
I:16748;892;This begins with a chilling statement of intent by the leading man, and from then on it is a marvel of carefully planned and flawlessly executed bank robbery.
I:16748;893;This is a great movie and you will not regret purchasing it.
I:16748;894;edge film the maverick director has ever made.
I:16748;895;She brings a much needed note of high.
I:16748;896;Dog Day Afternoon this ain't.
I:16748;897;drama with a good cast.
I:16748;898;Limited graphic violence,language, so fine as wife or date night flick.
I:16748;899;Everyone I have loaned it to really liked it.
I:16748;900;This is a brilliant film.
I:16748;901;Denzel Washington and Christopher Plummer are superb.
I:16748;902;Even the sound track is gripping.
I:16748;903;Interesting plot and twists and I liked all of the players in the film.
I:16748;904;He strides down the street with the same confident air, right down to the way he shears the brim of his hat jauntily into place.
I:16748;905;But she tackles her assignment with characteristic intelligence and command.
I:16748;906;The pieces we have are colorful shards that form some interesting patterns as they twist and turn.
I:16748;907;They are both good pieces of music.
I:16748;908;Still, it's good to look at.
I:16748;909;the bank is stormed, and everybody comes out.
I:16748;910;great excitement, with nifty twists and turns.
I:16748;911;I might have to see it again, and pay closer attention.
I:16748;912;But that's okay, because it is a sponge.
I:16748;913;I would rate the plot five stars: it is clever, it is logical, and it has its twists and turns.
I:16748;914;The script is also excellent, with sharp dialogue and some wit.
I:16748;915;the same is true, though to a lessor extent, of the gloating of Detective Frazier.
I:16748;916;I enjoyed the suspense in wondering how they were going to leave the bank without getting caught.
I:16748;917;It's a very entertaining show.
I:16748;918;With Inside Man Spike Lee certainly managed to disguise a regular bankjob story as a flashy accelerating action movie.
I:16748;919;nevertheless the result he came up with is still worth watching.
I:16748;920;because the cast is great.
I:16748;921;even Jodie Foster is fun to watch for a change.
I:16748;922;Every once in a while you come across a movie that has you on the edge of your seat for parts of the movie.
I:16748;923;Almost a character despite never seen on screen is director Spike Lee turns the bank robbery into a bigger issue that also deals with race, class, and sex and is still able to feature his longtime collaborator, New York City itself even though most of the action takes place in the bank and a police trailer.
I:16748;924;And Spike had plenty to work with thanks to Russell Gewirtz, who throws in plenty of one.
I:16748;925;Quite unique and still thinking about it days after viewing.
I:16748;926;Very entertaining, fast paced and highly recommended.
I:16748;927;"He makes powerful films that are often smart (""Do the Right Thing""), occasionally not (""She Hate Me""), and sometimes brilliant (""Malcolm X,"" ""4 Little Girls""), but there is never any question that Spike's first goal is to make an emotionally powerful film."
I:16748;928;smart heist movie that adopts all the tricks of the genre.
I:16748;929;"While no ""heist movie"" is ever going to rise to the hallowed heights of ""The Sting"" in movie lore, Lee has made one heck of an enjoyable movie."
I:16748;930;In broad daylight, Russell leads a handful of thieves into the downtown Manhattan branch of a powerful bank, founded in 1948 by Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer).
I:16748;931;heist movies are more about style and wit than logic, and are at their best when one player is able to move among the others as if he or she has had an advance peek at the screenplay.
I:16748;932;this is an intelligent heist movie made by a talented, dedicated filmmaker.
I:16748;933;"Solid work by the entire cast makes ""Inside Man"" a pleasure to watch ."
I:16748;934;Mr. Lee and his team should be very proud, and it's not surprising that this movie has been Lee's biggest box office hit yet, and a sequel appears to be in the works.
I:16748;935;Director Spike Lee hits box.
I:16748;936;Inside Man also makes some telling social observations while delivering plenty of surprises.
I:16748;937;Lee provides a fine acting ensemble (Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer) with an inventive screenplay from Russell Gewirtz and excellent cinematography by Matthew Libatique.
I:16748;938;The result is a crackerjack entertainment and one of Lee's most accomplished films.
I:16748;939;Inside Man (Full Screen Edition) (2006)Great story line with action and an intiguring twist.
I:16748;940;See if you can figure it out.
I:16748;941;Spike Lee has made a Hollywood movie and it's one of the best movies this year and certainly the best in at least a decade for the heist genre.
I:16748;942;The performances are top notch, the direction is superb and the pacing is explosive.
I:16748;943;I am a big Spike Lee fan and this movie was well done.
I:16748;944;I love when Denzel and Spike Lee hook up because they make great movies.
I:16748;945;My favorite movie is He Got game with Denzel Washington and this time they make magic again.
I:16748;946;The story line is excellent and their are many plots and turns.
I:16748;947;I watch this movie every time I get a chance.
I:16748;948;also has several twists to it.
I:16748;949;I love Denzel Washington in just about anything, but this was a good movie with a lot of suspense.
I:16748;950;You won't be disappointed, I promise you.
I:16748;951;This is one of the best movies I have seen for the past months.
I:16748;952;Spike lee is a great director who has chosen a terrific cast to play that this genius story.
I:16748;953;This is a very good variation on the classic heist movie.
I:16748;954;this is more mainstream, than most Spike Lee films but he still stamps his own vision on the film.
I:16748;955;It goes without saying that the direction is good and the script equally so.
I:16748;956;i have only seen the film once, but can imagine that it will improve with a few more viewings.
I:16748;957;spike Lee clearly has the talent to put together a classy, well executed action movie, and he will hopefully devote more of his talent to these kinds of films, because Inside Man really works.
I:16748;958;This movie is a masterpiece.
I:16748;959;"every angle is covered, the characters are poignant and individual, etc.""when you discover plot holes big enough to drive a truck through"" Untrue!"
I:16748;960;Has you guessing til the every end.
I:16748;961;a movie that you can enjoy more than once
I:16748;962;Clive Owen plays a bank robber, and i think he is a brilliant one.
I:16748;963;I will give you a few examples.
I:16748;964;He's introduced to the movie in the first 10 minutes as a person who is always in trouble with the law and shares an apartment with Frasier and his girlfriend.
I:16748;965;spike Lee surprises audiences this time around with a suspenseful heist thriller, a territory that he hadn't experimented with up until Inside Man.
I:16748;966;What Frazier is about to uncover are deep secrets and a very unexpected surprise as the events unfold.
I:16748;967;despite some flaws and a few vague characters, I enjoyed Inside Man.
I:16748;968;Denzel Washington, as usual, delivers a fine performance, and Spike Lee's direction is right on target.
I:16748;969;this time with a seemless suspense film.
I:16748;970;denzel is great as always, and the supporting cast is marvelous.
I:16748;971;This is not even close to being one of Spike's best, it is a little too reminiscent of other classic noir thrillers, but it is done with a masterful touch .
I:16748;972;Screenwriter Russel Gewirtz is an original artist.
I:16748;973;He's right to leave such correlations to students of literature.
I:16748;974;to a very sharp detective.
I:16748;975;the Chaucerian tale has one overarching requirement.
I:16748;976;It must be told successfully from multiple perspectives.
I:16748;977;From a 2006 interview done by Angela Cranon, Gewirtz is simply driven by originality.
I:16748;978;"Inside Man is hyped as ""A heist thriller like you've never seen"" and as ""A cool, captivating cat."
I:16748;979;"It's an ""intensive and explosive crime thriller"", a ""perfect bank robbery"", and the Wall Street Journal."
I:16748;980;Role ownership seems to be one of Washington's favorite things.
I:16748;981;jodie Foster walked into a brilliantly written role for the power.
I:16748;982;I'm happy with her career's success.
I:16748;983;bravo, Russell Gewirtz, for the wicked good writing.
I:16748;984;Bravo to most of the players for taking it up to the next level.
I:16748;985;BTW, the reviewers who think this is a great bank heist film are full of beans.
I:16748;986;Skin colors and other color resolutions appear natural and warm in most scenes.
I:16748;987;the Audio transfer is to a lossless DTS MA 5.1 and it sounds perfectly clear with precisely balanced volumes for both dialogue and ambience.
I:16748;988;Your LFE channel, at this point, also wakes up for the duration of these scenes.
I:16748;989;all in all, a good clean transfer to Blu Ray.
I:16748;990;Good heist movies can be a lot of fun, and Inside Man is one of my favorites.
I:16748;991;I think it's because it's fascinating to see a robbery unfold, and the particular method used.
I:16748;992;Inside Man is one of the most inventive that I have seen.
I:16748;993;His use of a narrator was especially effective.
I:16748;994;Another favorite is Dog Day Afternoon, which is even mentioned in Inside Man.
I:16748;995;"The original version of The Italian Job (1969) focuses on the getaway
I:16748;996;This choice works well, and we gradually come to understand why Russell's gang made the hostages wear painter's outfits.
I:16748;997;He's also an intelligent man, and quickly realizes that Russell doesn't expect his demands to be met.
I:16748;998;Washington and Owen are both excellent choices for their respective roles, and each gives a memorable performance.
I:16748;999;the movie contains a few twists, and the ultimate resolution is pleasing.
I:16748;1000;I find myself returning to it often, and it always feels fresh.
I:16748;1001;If you are a fan of Washington or Owen, it's worth checking out.
I:16748;1002;This is one of those films where you can't discuss too much of the plot without giving away the whole store.
I:16748;1003;This film is filled with interesting plot twists, mystery, suspense, sure.
I:16748;1004;footed direction by Spike Lee, and well.
I:16748;1005;"I've always liked Lee's films, but this is his first truly ""mainstream"" film that all can enjoy."
I:16748;1006;"I can't help but feel that Lee is winking at his critics with this film, ""See I can do this kind of stuff."
I:16748;1007;That's IF I want to.
I:16748;1008;This perfectly casted film is a great diversion that I think most will enjoy.
I:16748;1009;This is a good movie and has a neat plot with more twists than I expected.
I:16748;1010;There is always one more just around the corner.
I:16748;1011;You almost know when Denzel Washington is going to be one of the main actors, you've got a class act movie.
I:16748;1012;I've seen the new James Bond in other movies, and I won't judge the new guy in the James Bond role, but I honestly think Clive Owen was the man for that one.
I:16748;1013;Jodie Foster was her usual great self as well.
I:16748;1014;Take my advice and see this one.
I:16748;1015;As always, Denzel Washington is fantastic, though maybe a little over.
I:16748;1016;The rest of the main cast, particularly Owen, Plummer and Foster, all put in great performances.
I:16748;1017;The greatest film in that category, Dog Day Afternoon is even referenced in this movie.
I:16748;1018;lest I be misunderstood, this is a very entertaining film.
I:16748;1019;The good acting and suspense save it from its lack of originality.
I:16748;1020;This film is very moving and intriguing.
I:16748;1021;We always give Denzel movies the benefit of the doubt, because he usually delivers on the promise of fabulous acting and a relavent plot.
I:16748;1022;This movie looked interesting, and it was .
I:16748;1023;I thought the acting was spot.
I:16748;1024;This really keeps you guessing.
I:16748;1025;inside Man's stock is raised by the presence of director Lee, who makes his most thrilling and enjoyable movie for some time.
I:16748;1026;It's entertaining on almost every level.
I:16748;1027;very good bank heist movie.
I:16748;1028;The acting was really good by the whole cast.
I:16748;1029;But it is a good story one that you can follow and identify with characters
I:16748;1030;there are some good even great things going on in Inside Man.
I:16748;1031;As a character and genre study, its amazing.
I:16748;1032;as a character study, it's also interesting.
I:16748;1033;Its nice after seeing her in two women in distress films, that Jodi Foster can bring the cold.
I:16748;1034;The characters are morally ambivalent and, while it can be considered a jaded view of society, but it was interesting seeing conflicted characters who might not be interested in what's right or wrong, but what's good for them.
I:16748;1035;It might be jaded, but it also is in some ways a good representation of how some things work.
I:16748;1036;Some of his critiques on society are spot on and humorous.
I:16748;1037;Very minor in the film and has nothing to do with it that I hate to bring it up.
I:16748;1038;"As an example, the Arab who's really a Sheik and the police saying something to the effect ""Oh my God he's Arab!"""
I:16748;1039;spike Lee also does a great job of introducing minor characters that really help to flesh out the story and provide a backdrop for what's happening.
I:16748;1040;For instance, the cop who comes on the scene in the beginning and his story of when he first had a gun shoved in his face is interesting.
I:16748;1041;Pacing issues aside, it is a good film that turns some heist conventions on its head while presenting jaded characters who each have a motive and who are very human and real.
I:16748;1042;intensity movie actually through me for a loop .
I:16748;1043;Inside Man is probably one of the best movies Spike Lee has ever made.
I:16748;1044;"I will admit, as many other reviewers have done, that this is probably Spike's best movie since ""Malcom X,"" and, ""Do The Right Thing."""
I:16748;1045;He is one determined, cool talking, take no chances man, who even claims to have the perfect bank robbery plan anyone has ever had.
I:16748;1046;Frazier must match wits, brains, and intelligence with Russel in order to save the lives of the people in the bank.
I:16748;1047;i thought the best scenes were with with Frazier and Russel talking to each other, they seemed to have a war of words and dealings throughout a good portion of the movie.
I:16748;1048;The ending of the movie is really superb, at least it was to me, and I definately recommend seeing this from start to finish to enjoy it even more.
I:16748;1049;Spike Lee and Denzel Washington discuss their collaborations of the movieMore than 25 minutes [that's a lot!]
I:16748;1050;Will see it many more times.
I:16748;1051;Inside Man is an excellent, enjoyable film.
I:16748;1052;Frazier has a dark spot on his record, so he is anxious for the opportunity to prove himself.
I:16748;1053;As soon as you realize that, you know a good example of the genre will be fun, light and breezy, keep you guessing and take you on a bit of a roller coaster ride.
I:16748;1054;Inside Man is a great example of the genre.
I:16748;1055;Film is an art form and the best films engage your imagination, feelings and emotion.
I:16748;1056;Great films also have a point of view, but Lee's films always seem to portray the ONLY message, according to the filmmaker.
I:16748;1057;If you disagree, screw you.
I:16748;1058;I am glad I did see it because it is an excellent film.
I:16748;1059;All four people are integral to the film's success, but the biggest surprise for me is Spike Lee.
I:16748;1060;any successful heist film is going to have to move, keep the viewer engaged and provide a form of suspense.
I:16748;1061;Another memorable exchange concerns a video game and there are many more instances like this throughout.
I:16748;1062;As the machinations of the heist are in progress, these moments help make the characters more real and the film even more enjoyable.
I:16748;1063;like the best Sidney Lumet, Martin Scorcese and Woody Allen films, Lee uses New York City as a character.
I:16748;1064;The city's melting pot of personalities and cultures also provides a rich backdrop for the film.
I:16748;1065;denzel Washington's Detective Frazier is one of the actor's most memorable characters.
I:16748;1066;Even with the blight on his record, he is confident, gung ho and ready for the challenge.
I:16748;1067;He proves very adept at this and equally good dealing with New York.
I:16748;1068;his character has good dialogue throughout, adding an air of levity.
I:16748;1069;"clive Owen (""Gosford Park"", the unfortunate ""Derailed"") is very good as Dalton Russell, the mastermind behind the robbery."
I:16748;1070;dalton is always clear and calculating.
I:16748;1071;"The film is also good about casting doubts on his character a few times
I:16748;1072;The great thing about Madeline is that even though she is a powerful woman and disliked by everyone she meets, she recognizes this and doesn't care.
I:16748;1073;"She knows that everyone she meets
I:16748;1074;Inside Man is the best film I have seen so far this year.
I:16748;1075;Love how Spike Lee is changing it up.
I:16748;1076;Love Clive Owen and the Denzel Washington cat and mouse play and great acting all around.
I:16748;1077;Secondly, I am a huge Denzel Washington fan and a huge Spike Lee fan.
I:16748;1078;I've always enjoyed Willem Defoe , Christopher Plummer , and Jody Foster.
I:16748;1079;All of these talents are immeasurable and can do wonders with good material.
I:16748;1080;Spike Lee is a visionary director with a focal point in all of his films.
I:16748;1081;"recognized the power of his gift and I look forward to seeing his upcoming HBO documentary, about the devastating issues in New Orleans, entitled , "" When the Levees Broke ""."
I:16748;1082;The interview between Denzel Washington and Spike Lee is revealing and provides glimses of their admiration for one another and their genuine friendship.
I:16748;1083;Yes , beware of any film that has alot of big named actors on the cover.
I:16748;1084;The music in this reminds me of the 80s .
I:16748;1085;If you don't mind a little bit of violence and a lot of vulgar language, then I highly recommend this movie, especially if you enjoy a good bank robbery movie (even though this isn't your average bank job).
I:16748;1086;my favorite part about this film is writing this review.
I:16748;1087;It's intense fun that never slows down or takes the easy way out, making it one of the coolest movies.
I:16748;1088;A most purely enjoyable movie.
I:16748;1089;This movie had great potential.
I:16748;1090;I think his movies sort of drag out and impose his political viewpoints other than just entertaining the audience.
I:16748;1091;In fact, I got to a certain point of the movie and turned it off.
I:16748;1092;I felt Spike Lee's message was becoming just like all his other movies.
I:16748;1093;I admit, when I saw Spike Lee's name on the movie, I knew right there it would be much of the same.
I:16748;1094;But, in all do fairness, I decided to give it a chance.
I:16748;1095;It needs to be edited to make it move a little more.
I:16748;1096;"Unless the Director believes that ""editing"" will stifle his creative vision."
I:16748;1097;the acting is fine all around, but there are no knockout performances that will be remembered at Oscar nomination time.
I:16748;1098;He enlists of the help of a mysterious power broker played by Jodie Foster, to protect his secret.
I:16748;1099;clive Owen seems cool, calm and in control as the lead bagd guy.
I:16748;1100;"Does it deliver as a smart ""conspiracy"" film?"
I:16748;1101;I enjoyed this movie very much.
I:16748;1102;Denzel, Owen and the rest were very, very good.
I:16748;1103;"I only say this
I:16748;1104;He knows how to do it, and he means it.
I:16748;1105;the film gradually reveals the true meaning of his words, showing how the four robbers led by Dalton hit the bank and take hostage.
I:16748;1106;But the film's story remains still entertaining all the same, not by just following the story, but by showing the complexity of the characters.
I:16748;1107;but the main attraction of `Inside Man' is its skillful storytelling greatly helped by the top.
I:16748;1108;Not that the plot is totally unpredictable for some of you will be able to anticipate the twists in the plot.
I:16748;1109;Still `Inside Man is a very entertaining film as long as you can ignore certain elements in its very convoluted story.
I:16748;1110;Inside Man is a great movie.
I:16748;1111;Fast action, great acting, fantastic plot.
I:16748;1112;I highly recommend this movie.
I:16748;1113;The movie then illustrates just how Russell was able to complete his master heist.
I:16748;1114;They shine lights at the cameras, lock the doors, reveal their weapons, and announce that a robbery is in progress.
I:16748;1115;iNSIDE MAN has a great cast with some fabulous acting.
I:16748;1116;Washington, Foster, and Plummer are magnificent as always, but stronger performances are given by some of the film's supporting actors, particularly Chiwetel Ejiofor as Frazier's assistant Bill Mitchell and Waris Ahluwalia as Vikram Walia, a Sikh hostage who when released from the bank is at first thought to be a terrorist.
I:16748;1117;Beside the commentary, these moments also provide greater depth to the characters we see on the screen.
I:16748;1118;overall, INSIDE MAN is an enjoyable heist picture.
I:16748;1119;It's a movie that a wide audience can relate to.
I:16748;1120;which takes talent on the part of the director.
I:16748;1121;"Older movies have such powerful dialogs that make you say ""Wow !"
I:16748;1122;I love heist type films.
I:16748;1123;The end was pretty cool.
I:16748;1124;The cast all did pretty nice jobs and for the most part seemed believable.
I:16748;1125;I went into this movie with high expectations.
I:16748;1126;The cast and director had done some outstanding work in the past.
I:16748;1127;The plot sounded interesting, with ample chance for rich story and character elements.
I:16748;1128;"A borrowed ""bank heist"" premise and a few gritty, stylized, or eccentric touches and small."
I:16748;1129;nature observations do not add up to a good movie.
I:16748;1130;This is true no matter how talented, intelligent, and otherwise successful the people involved.
I:16748;1131;Jodie Foster made an interesting ice.
I:16748;1132;Another smash hit for Denzel WashingtonI'm a fan of this great actor and the combination with Jodie Foster and Owen Wilson is fantastic
I:16748;1133;Though I'm not a big fan of the movies produced and directed by Spike Lee, I am a huge fan of Denzel Washington and many of his films.
I:16748;1134;All I can say is that I was really impressed by the whole shebang.
I:16748;1135;Jody Foster as the mysterious Madeline White was beautiful, sexy, and oh so sassy in a role that begs for a movie about this intriguing character.
I:16748;1136;But, there's something else going on here, and the glues are revealed one at a time, keeping the viewer guessing as to what's going to happen next.
I:16748;1137;It's wonderful watching these two excellent actors play off of each other.
I:16748;1138;In fact, it's almost mesmerizing to watch.
I:16748;1139;Also, I don't know what Jodie Foster has done recently to change her appearance, but she seems to be getting more beautiful with age.
I:16748;1140;driven movie than an action film, it certainly fulfilled both roles for me and demonstrated rather clearly that Spike Lee is capable of doing anything he puts his mind to in Hollywood.
I:16748;1141;This was an utterly suspenseful movie with a brilliant script from a first.
I:16748;1142;notch direction from Mr. Lee, and perfect performances from some of today's most talented actors.
I:16748;1143;Highly recommended for one's film library!
I:16748;1144;If you're looking for a movie that will keep you thinking until the last minute (and then some), this is the one!
I:16748;1145;Denzel Washington does a great job as NYPD detective.
I:16748;1146;great music soundtrack as well!Go on and order it!
I:16748;1147;keeps you thinking and second guessing the cops.
I:16748;1148;take the time it's intriguing.
I:16748;1149;This movie never quite fills you in on the whole picture until the end but once you see what is going on it is quite interesting and amazing.
I:16748;1150;I would recommend this movie to anybody looking for a good movie that will keep you waiting for the next piece of key information to clue you in on the real deal.
I:16748;1151;Because it kept me interested.
I:16748;1152;Fast paced, well thought out, the inevitable twist, and an excellent ending.
I:16748;1153;I hadn't seen this movie in theaters, but was pleasantly surprised by the story.
I:16748;1154;This is not a typical heist / bankrobber movie but adds a few interesting elements to the mix.
I:16748;1155;Strong performances of Jodie Foster, Clive Owen and Denzel Washington elevate the plot even further.
I:16748;1156;If you like thrillers with a smart story, you won't be disappointedTechnically speaking, this is a strong release: video is clean without spots or other debris, colours are accurate and there's a lot of detail visible, even in darker elements.
I:16748;1157;Audio is also engaging with clearly intelligible dialogue and some nice pans round out a strong audio track.
I:16748;1158;all in all, a strong recommendation for fans of thrillers / heist movies!
I:16748;1159;Well done movie with a twist on a bank robbery which was a little unique.
I:16748;1160;Very entertaining film with some spot on acting.
I:16748;1161;Denzel is always strong, and thoroughly enjoyed Jodie Foster's character.
I:16748;1162;The film plays a bit with some rashomonesque story telling and flashes, and it's intriguing to see the plot play out.
I:16748;1163;demand as well, which worked pretty well for me.
I:16748;1164;Maybe if I watch it a second time around it'll be better.
I:16748;1165;For now I'll give it 2 stars.
I:16748;1166;Inside Man grabs your interest right away and always keeps you guessing.
I:16748;1167;Just when you think you might have a handle on what is going on, it throws you another curveball to keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:16748;1168;As the mysteries continue to deepen, you'll become completely invested in just what the heck Dalton Russell is planning!This is also one of the best Denzel Washington performances ever put to film (and that is saying something).
I:16748;1169;here's what keeps this movie from becoming a true classic, though (mild spoilers ahead): It truly is all about the build.
I:16748;1170;Inside Man is squarely one of those films where the journey is far, far more fun than the actual destination.
I:16748;1171;And the ending was a bonus.
I:16748;1172;Hard to find a movie anymore with good acting and a good plot too.
