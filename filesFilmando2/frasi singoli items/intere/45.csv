id;spiegazione
1;R. lee Ermey does a spectacular job with this movie.
2;the directer stanley kubrik made this film so you know its a classic.
3;my 6th favorite movie ever and second favorite kubrik film.
4;They tell me this is real.
5;It damn sure feels real.
6;This part of the film was also excellent.
7;Like everything else that Kubrick did, this is a highly stylized vision.
8;He's making a movie about men watching a war .
9;check the extraordinary sequence mid.
10;some reviewers don't care for the Parris island/Vietnam segue. . . i think its brilliant.
11;With a filmmaker this calculating, you can be sure that there's a reason the sniper's a girl. . . finally, see this movie for the best City/ Into the Bush transition since Peter O'Tooole went from Officer's Club to the Desert in Lawrence of Arabia.
12;"Kubrick's opening slow zoom in Saigon is simply genius
13;[The language is raw, but sort of funny in an exaggerated way.]
14;They finish their training and graduate.
15;There is a dramatic scene in the head when Leonard disobeys orders.
16;They arrive in Vietnam and learn to communicate with the indigenous people and learn the culture.
17;One man in a helicopter shoots at the people on the ground.
18;There is enemy action and casualties.
19;The enemy shoots the point man to draw in those who want to rescue him.
20;The Marines are able to neutralize the sniper.
21;Oliver Stone's """"Platoon"""" is still the best movie on the war on Vietnam."""
22;The first part of the film shows the psychological conditioning of recruits.
23;In my opinion, this movie is the best production of a Vietnam war scene.
24;Though produced in the early eighties, this movie is a very vivid and real seeming movie, and deserves a place in every movie collection!
25;A movie you can watch over and over again.
26;The first part is my favorite.
27;The first half of this film is the most accurate portrayal of USMC boot camp I have ever seen, outside of actually being there.
28;But he did such a perfect job himself that Stanley Kubrick hired him for the job.
29;Overall, this is a serious and engaging movie that brilliantly describes military experiences on and off the battlefield.
30;While the film's stoic vision through the Vietnam carries it's own weight of originality, it is that gatling gun soliloquy of R. Lee Ermy's Sergeant Hartman that leaves the viewer as one of the most brilliant, memorable, and totally original sequences in all of film.
31;Full Metal Jacket is one of the very precious films to be classified as a Kubrick film.
32;There are few honors higher than that.
33;rayThis one looks clean, with clean and consistent grain if a bit soft.
34;The cinematography is simply and direct.
35;I can't say whether or not the life in the Corps is portrayed accurately but overall it's a good story.
36;This is one of the best film that has been made by Hollywood.
37;All cast actors really came across with very realistic presentations.
38;This film is a real keeper
39;I Loved this story so much and enjoyed every bit of time i spent watching it.
40;This is an all time favorite of mine.
41;This is my favorite military movie.
42;It seems to be a great depiction of what the vietnam war was like.
43;The only reason I enjoyed this film was based on the horrifying bootcamp led by R. Lee Ermey, or basically the first half.
44;I'm surprised that Lee Ermey has never been acknowledged for his acting ability, because he is a truly talent, and can portray other roles besides drill instructor.
45;The second half of this film is very tedious and boring, but I had to give this film four stars just because of Lee Ermey's memorable performance.
46;What makes this film unique is how the director used it to portray human nature.
47;His commands and ranting bring humor to the story, but the recruits suffer trough basic training.
48;This accounts for the first half of the movie, and the end of the first half is very shocking.
49;Overall, the film can be said to describe the transformation of ordinary men into pure killers.
50;i like this movie its funny but not at the same time war is not funny but they did a nice job to add funny bits to it.
51;It came in full screen format.
52;both of the other movies came in wide.
53;as for film itself, I have enjoyed it every time that I have seen it in past.
54;I look forward to picking up a wide.
55;screen version and would recommend the movie to anyone that likes war films.
56;This is a movie that I've viewed repeatedly over the years and still enjoy very much as it is strikingly genuine versus most Hollywood presentations of War.
57;The presentation of Boot Camp is so real in this movie and the Dufus that commits murder/suicide .
58;The portrayal of Boot Camp and it's push to remove individualism at all costs for the TEAM was very real and the discipline enforced by the group in it's partnering in said discipline with blanket parties is genuine.
59;the presentation of Vietnam experience matches pretty much exactly what everyone shared and also quite often a number of troops were killed due to simple mistakes .
60;So we won without having to fight .
61;It worked perfectly and I am glad to have this classic!
62;I did not have any issues with this movie at all, worked fine.
63;Love the movie also by the way
64;this film is very imotional.
65;it's like two films in one package, so some people might be a little confused, but if you think about it it all makes perfect sense.
66;Classic must see but graphic and for adultssome of the lines are so classic and easy to remembergreat at parties with friends
67;so when I watch the first half of this movie, it always makes me laugh 'til tears run down my face, and then.
68;it gets real serious .
69;This movie is perhaps a good enough wake up call to folks about what military llfe looks like, but I also believe it's pretty one sided and very jaded to a view that was anti.
70;But I'd watch it, the acting is first rate, and even though the characterizations are pretty lop sided and dang near stereotypical, it's still worth the time to see it.
71;Both have tremendous insight into the life of a Marine (or soldier).
72;This movie isn't just one of the top movies on Viet Nam but one of the best movies ever made!
73;If you like the first half like I did, you will laugh your way through right up to the last day in boot camp, where the movie changes dramatically.
74;Me, it was good the first 30 times.
75;I got it promptly and it is for sure what I expected.
76;I'm very happy with it.
77;Film after film, moment after moment, emotion after emotion, Kubrick is flawless and his films are as complete and as unique to him as they come.
78;No director has come close to delivering as consistently as Stanley Kubrick, and no director has a style as unique to himself as Kubrick (sure, many directors have their own style, but Kubrick's style is definitive and incomparable).
79;Sure, it may not be the best war movie out there, but it is one of the most unique.
80;The final scene, involving a sniper hit and the rushing conflicts of humanity, is really what makes this movie as harrowing and effective as it truly is.
81;the acting here is monumental and extremely powerful, especially in the opening section of the film.
82;"Ermey has received cult status, for his performance is brutal and outlandish and definitely memorable
83;His subtle emotional breakdown is flawlessly captured with just a shift in facial expressions.
84;His character is one of the most moving and definitely one of the most effective in the bunch.
85;Matthew Modine comes close to capturing the stripped humanity of the soul in his final scene, but D'Onofrio is unforgettable in his tragic turn as the odd man out.
86;I have always been more of a biopic, dramatic type of cinemaphile, but I have quite a few films in this genre on my agenda for the next few weeks.
87;`Full Metal Jacket' is one of those eye.
88;opening films, a movie that surpasses its genre thanks to some brilliant construction on the part of its director.
89;Kubrick takes this film and creates something universally grounded.
90;As the film draws to its conclusion we are faced with questions of a deeply rooted and personal nature that challenges us as human beings to decide just who we really and truly are.
91;Probably one of the best movies made about Vietnam.
92;Just the boot camp story of the first half of the movie makes this film a must see, but the rest of the movie is good too.
93;Up there with the best of the Vietnam War movies.
94;inspired finale, Kubrick continually surprises in this absorbing masterpiece.
95;Watch his other films, the man was a genius.
96;and this one is great.
97;Its more of a drama nor a killing machine movie but its great, it shows the reality of Vietnam
98;This is one of the better movies made by Kubrick, and it could be his best in my humble opinion.
99;This is the best vietnam movie out there.
100;The Bootcamp is the best ever done.
101;Ok People, I gotta say this.
102;My Dad is a Vietnam Vet and this movie and movies like this one are his favorite.
103;Kubrick's directorial style is perfect, as usual, and added to A Clockwork Orange, 2001, Barry Lyndon and Dr. Strangelove, this masterpiece firmly etsblishes him as one of the greatest directors that ever lived.
104;The film is unlikely to leave anyone with an upbeat, hopeful feeling, but it contains many components that ensure its place among the greatest works of art of the last few decades.
105;It is still entertaining, and would be to anyone that went through boot.
106;It wasn't fun experiencing it, but it is fun to watch other people suffering through it.
107;one on one Boot after another is a piece of work.
108;Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio are wonderful as tormetor and tormented.
109;One of my favorites, the Col. breaking Pvt. Joker's chops over his peace button using sports metaphors about getting on the team and going in for the big score .
110;The long line of executed villagers lieing in a ditch covered with lye, who had been gulled into reporting to and then murdered by the Cong is shown with an effectively quiet eloquence.
111;Cruelty and savagery abounded there.
112;The entire might of the U. s. forces, best trained and equipped in the world, can be devastated by an AK47 wielded by a determined teenager.
113;He shows the dilemma, and let's us decide the worth of this effort.
114;Young men in combat somewhere they never should have been sent?Kubrick's camera work and recreation of combat is as good in its way as Saving Pvt. Ryan's was in its way.
115;His sardonic humorous touches are numerous and welcome.
116;His choice and placement of music is, as was always true in his later movies, nothing less than brilliant.
117;When it starts, I have to watch it all the way through.
118;now, I think this is another masterpiece of economy and story telling.
119;This is an excellent transfer to blu.
120;ray, 100% better than the previous release.
121;Here, Kubrick attempts to be an insightful and original director.
122;at that time is one that's very anti.
123;i agree with Ed that the first half of the film during Corps bootcamp is very effective and also very brutal.
124;Kubrick succeeded in showing the brutality of their training, yet still keeps the audience at a distance.
125;The stand out performances by R. Lee Ermey as Gunny and a young Vincent D'Onofrio as Pvt. Pyle made the first half of Full Metal Jacket a classic in my book.
126;i may disagree with the second half's treatment of the book and of Kubrick's unsubtle antiwar message, but this film has to count as one of his best.
127;Was in excellent condition, and delivered fast.
128;Safe, honest, reliable seller that I would definitely do business again with!
129;The drill sergeant steals the movie.
130;the ending was surreal when all those guys are in search and destroy mode and they are singing the theme song to a show they grew up watching.
131;that's right full metal is about the war within.
132;this psychological struggle is in the shining, clockwork, 2001 and so on.
133;anyway, this film is classic and for good reason.
134;lee ermy shines like a diamond here.
135;the scene compsotion (thanks to kubricks still photography roots) is beautiful and often surreal, not too far from the shining.
136;macho world of Marines in combat, it is a stunning and unforgettable portrait of the futile, horrific, and insane nature of modern warfare.
137;matthew Modine is superbly cast as a thoughtful and intelligent young man trying to essay his way through the crashing surf of a treacherous and unpredictable tidal wave of blood.
138;The last half hour of the movie is absolutely gripping, and the scenes of combat are enough to make old grunts suffer flashbacks.
139;This movie, directed by Stanley Kubrick and based on a novel called The Short.
140;timers , is a full.
141;I recommend you steer youngsters away from this.
142;Otherwise, I recommend it to most grownups as a worthwhile way to get an authentic, if stylized, look at the nature of modern combat
143;quick delivery, flawless performance, excellent picture.
144;One of my Fave movies of all time.
145;I've seen it MANY times and always enjoy.
146;Probably the best rave boot camp scenes in a film.
147;Overall one of the finest military movies that's right up there with platoons.
148;I usually can't stand war movies, but for some reason this Kubrick film was very compelling and jolting, especially the first half showcasing the USMC boot camp.
149;This made seeing it replayed right before me very surreal, particularly because we had a guy in our unit who was also a big, uncoordinated, not.
150;What I discovered was a fine, fine film about the confusion and terror of not only Vietnam itself, but of the brutal training of the day.
151;I think I like the training part of the film better, the acting, the tension, everything is very fascinating.
152;The drill sergeant, who actually was a drill sergeant in Vietnam, is wonderful (Lee Ermy).
153;The humor is very adult.
154;When this movie gets to Hue city, the site of heavy, bloody fighting in Vietnam, it is very realistic (despite being filmed in England).
155;The film is gritty and unfiltered, like SPR.
156;I recommend it, but please, please see platoon.
157;all good characters in it especially vincent donofrio must be winning a award for it.
158;As pure entertainment, without trying to analyze any messages in the film, this movie delivers 100%.
159;This is one superb war movie.
160;the picture of this BD is pristine, and the audio PCM 5.1 is excellent.
161;As with all of Kubrick films this is meticulously crafted to create an effect an to show us the dehumanization of men at war.
162;The second half (vietnam combat) is also equally intense and memorable.
163;Matthew Modine adds a little comic relief to a very heavy film but also creates a fascinating character.
164;But this is Kubrick's achievement, his use of sets, cinematography and sound create a profoundly intense impact.
165;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film an 8!
166;this movie's power lies in the realistic portrayal of what it meant to be a Marine in Viet Nam.
167;All the horror, some of the dark humor produced, and the true human behavioral ambiguity of surviving a war zone.
168;These were some of the bravest men alive, also some of the scariest, some of the funniest, and some of the craziest.
169;The boot camp is entertaining and absorbing.
170;What is it with always the BOOM BOOM vietnamnese girls.
171;Like platoon it starts well and then it goes back to melodrama.
172;More special effects could of helped it along.
173;All girls in vietnamn are sexy and americans all lust after them.
174;All in one great movie.
175;Highly recommend this film to anyone wishing to see life like images of the horrors of war.
176;This is an all around great movie.
177;From the ritual debasement of training to combat itself, Kubrick's focus is always intensely personal.
178;His intensity and passion cannot be sustained by the Marines or the combat sequences that follow.
179;the combat scenes are graphic and intense, and aptly show how the war affects the soldiers in it.
180;all in all, this is a great movie, while it isn't Kubrick's best it is worth watching for R. Lee Emery alone.
181;I'm a big fan of Vincent D'onofrio from Law and Order Criminal Intent, and wanted to see him in other roles.
182;One of my favorite movie that accurtely depic's USMC boot camp.
183;As a Marine myself this movie will always have a place in my personal library.
184;`Full Metal Jacket', coauthored, produced, and directed by Stanley Kubrick may very well be the great director's second best film, after `2001, A Space Odyssey'.
185;the conventional wisdom at the time of the film's release in 1987 is that it was of a great film and of a good film.
186;When I pair this performance with that of Jack Nicholson in `The Shining', I see a common weakness arising from the two actors' giving away the game in their expressions several scenes before their climaxes.
187;And, the most salient aspect of that training is the message that `.
188;Herr's contribution of realism to two relatively surreal movies may be why these two films are well remembered to this day and Acadamy Award winner, `Platoon' has fallen to second string status, except for the cachet obtained by winning the Oscar for best picture.
189;would recommend to anyone that asked.
190;Product was on time as represented and and good value
191;lee Ermey obviously new his role well and played it to perfection and was another stand out, in my experience you honestly learn to respect your instructors, and after awhile, it really wasn't that bad.
192;But this is subjective so take it for what it's worth.
193;over all I felt the film drifted a little in the second half, but the performances are right on, and I don't care if it is a or isn't an anti.
194;True to life diepiction of service life in the 60's.
195;It captured the moral quagmire of our involvement in Vietnam.
196;one of the first and best of the gritty, realistic view of the US Military.
197;One of the greatest films about war.
198;Even though there are only three women in the cast and their on screen time is very limited, their roles are pivotal and their performances are outstanding as are all the males in the cast.
199;This is one of the most superb casting jobs ever.
200;boot Camp breaksdown into Introductions, Programming, Unity, Graduation, Realization.
201;His method to achieve this transformation is all.
202;The first half is funnier and possibly easier to relate to but it's the second half that has the real message(s).
203;If you haven't seen them be sure to see Paths of Glory, Dr. strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, A Clockwork Orange and the greatest movie ever made 2001:A Space Odyssey.
204;Reccommended by friends who are Marines.
205;This movie is worth owning for the first half of the film.
206;Lee Ermy is outstanding as GySgt Hartman, and the boot camp scenes are just like being there (I was).
207;Those of you that think this is an accurate portrayal of Vietnam are sadly mistaken.
208;turn up the sound and watch it.
209;Very good portaral of early Vietnam era in the US.
210;And no doubt about it, he was quite good at the time, but nothing can compare to R. Lee Ermey's Sgt. Hartman.
211;Indeed, most of the enjoyment I got the first few times I viewed Full Metal Jacket was listening to Ermey's browbeating his recruits.
212;How else could these characters cope?Yet the really amazing thing about Full Metal Jacket is how much it grows on me with each viewing.
213;Kubrick does himself a great service by not trying to make a film which sums up all of Viet Nam.
214;This film is really quite a classic among 20.45 males.
215;It's funny at times when it probably shouldn't be.
216;You kind of start laughing until you realize just exactly what is going on.
217;Must see for most heterosexual men.
218;Modine is quite brilliant as the smarmy, smart allecky Joker.
219;the performance of a lifetime.
220;r. Lee's ability to infuse his character with realism.
221;makes the first half of the film riveting in the utmost.
222;While the latter half of the film is certainly a dark gaze into the murk of the Viet Nam experience, the Boot Camp half is almost a commercial for the Marines and R. Lee carries it the whole way.
223;R. Lee is THAT compelling.
224;marine, retired after wounds received in the Service, won acclaim as one of Hollywood's most authentic soldier.
225;This movie captures your attention immediately and never lets you rest.
226;Im a big stanley kubrick fan and this film is pure genius.
227;One of the best scenes is when a squad of war correspondents are scene panning past a unit of Marines after an attack(with The Trashmen playing in the background), and each Marine gives his contribution to Sgt. Cowboy's Start the cameras, this is Vietnam.
228;This is what makes this movie great.
229;In the final scenes, when the true terror of Vietnam is revealed, the hardening the young men receives wins out.
230;This is the point that is made, but it is subtle and develops slowly, much to Kubrick's credit.
231;parts of this movie are out and out funny, especially the scenes with the Drill instructor.
232;Kubrick has a way of making you laugh at uncomfortable notions, as he did in Dr. Strangelove, and uses this sensibility to help the viewer understand that gallows humor is a part of what helps people get through stress in combat.
233;r. Lee Ermey (As Gunnery Sgt. Hartman) gives one of the greatest performances in a military role of any movie ever.
234;His brutal and profane, yet often hilarious, tirades make for a great first half of the movie, and really give life to the idea of """"breaking down"""" recruits."""
235;"Matthew Modine is also very good, as one of the more idealistic young men who is shaped by Sgt. Hartman into a Marine who is ""born to kill""."
236;this is a fantastic film.
237;home soldier, this movie covers the range of the Vietnam conflict, and the young men who were sent to fight in it, without over.
238;Really a great movie to watch again and again.
239;Full to the brim with classic and memorable lines and phrases, This film is truly amazing.
240;Every single character in the film portrays his role exceedingly well.
241;The best performances for me include :.
242;and I think the best actor in the film .
243;baldwin is outstanding in this film.
244;his character is intriguing and interesting.
245;he also has a courageness about him that everybody watching the film looks up to.
246;all round, this is a great film.
247;"This is the best ""war movie"" maybe even the best ""movie"" of all time!!"
248;"The opening scene
249;The first part is the best although the last half is pretty good as well
250;Amazing cinematography, good choice of cast.
251;As with most of his movies, Kubrick tells the tale his own way and doesn't worry too much about historical accuracy.
252;but they all agree that the movie is powerful and evocative.
253;If you are a fan of Kubrick's, you will find much to appreciate (though maybe not enjoy!)
254;One of the all time greatest war movies.
255;Great story, cinematography, and acting.
256;Along with an all star cast.
257;I absolutely love this movie.
258;Coming from an infantry unit, 5th marines to be specific, this movie is outstanding.
259;If not the best film about war in general, then """"Full Metal Jacket"""" is undoubtedly the most vivid and realistic (if not sometimes disturbing) portrait of the Vietnam War."""
260;Truly contradictory in itself, one of its strongest qualities.
261;Full metal jacket is a bright loud well made well acted brilliant look at the Vietnam war.
262;The story is realistic and accurate.
263;The boot camp part sets it apart and the Vietnam part is briliant.
264;I used to love this film when i was younger and my son really liked it.
265;This is really two movies in one.
266;Maybe Kubrick viewed it in standard format and decided he liked it better.
267;This is still a great movie and worth the viewing.
268;If you want to know if this movie is good than please go to IMDB.
269;I will keep the movie.
270;As large and diverse as this ensemble cast was, surely Warner Brothers could have found at least ONE of the actors to provide some much.
271;Tips could have done well as a 2 movie set and even a trilogy with the 3rd bring all about PTSD.
272;it was clean with no scratches and wrapped nicely.
273;this is one of the most realistic war movies I've ever seen.
274;The movie will often shock you, make you laugh, and depress you.
275;While most of the film has a decent clarity, there is also an undeniable amount of grain during parts of the film.
276;well, I suppose this title fits in perfectly with other Blu.
277;ray movies when it comes to visual clarity.
278;This movie has some violence in it but the rant of the Sargent is classic!
279;But what a great movie!!!
280;This movie is one of the best I have seen.
281;Great actors and the scenes stay with youth is is a classic and a keeper
282;This is a great film and I would highly recommend it.
283;Thank you for streaming this Amazon.
284;recommend everyone watching once for culture experience.
285;Great movie has been one of my favorite movies for a long time definitely will watch againHas a lot of bad language
286;Stanley Kubrick's film is spectacular and defies easy description.
287;In the first section we see how young men are turned into soldiers and in the second section we see how they perform under real war conditions.
288;The film is beautifully filmed.
289;Kubrick was the finest film maker for interior scenes and the barracks on Parris Island, with their red shiny floors, created a perfect stage for the drama to unfold between the drill sergeant and the new troops.
290;The bombed out buildings for the final scenes were fascinating, a labyrinth of death and danger.
291;The acting was absolutely superb with Private Lawrence giving one of the most frightening performances while the Drill Sergeant giving one of the most over.
292;The film is totally entertaining.
293;Not only is the squad action (when Joker and the rest go after the sniper) told in a compelling manner but is also shown with a clarity that belies the complexity of staging a scene like this.
294;I think it was meant portray that feeling of joy that one has lived to see another day.
295;emotions aside,This time in our lives, needed to be told.
296;Great writing, acting, directing and editing make this Vietnam epic IMHO, the curve setter of the genre, as well as one of the best war movies ever.
297;"The film overflows with memorable cinematic moments 
298;Best of all, director Stanley Kubrick tells his story without the usual Vietnam pontifications and guilt mongering.
299;This is one of Kubrick's best films.
300;This is very realistic about the Vietnam War.
301;His best films include The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, and this.
302;Full Metal Jacket is one of the all time American movie classics.
303;The picture is super crisp and without flaw but I had to run the volume up to 70 just to hear the dialog.
304;Seen this movie many times and it shows the horror of war and what it does to men.
305;I recommend this move to all who think war means glory and to those who have missed the military experience.
306;F. m. j is a movie that i will enjoy and have everyone in my family enjoy forever.
307;one if not the greatest film!!!!!
308;Primarily because Oliver Stone was a veteran,himself.
309;R. lee Ermey played the Drill Instructor to perfection,as he should have, having been the very same in real life.
310;Overall, because of R. Lee Ermey's performance and Vincent D'Onofrio I give it 4 stars.
311;marine boot camp section esp good.
312;If you are a fan of film, regardless of genre, you must watch this movie.
313;Stanley Krubrick creates one of the most resonating, visceral, and harrowing war movies of all time.
314;The first half of the movie is so affecting it may change the way you watch films.
315;This is one of the great movies, a must own, 5 stars easy.
316;1 star for the package.
317;I actually give this film 4 and a half stars.
318;and speaking of Private Pyle in the first scene, I am still in great awe.
319;Im pleased that so many have been touched by this film and feel the same way that I do about it.
320;It brings me hope for the human race.
321;From the opening boot camp story of Cowboy and Joker through the recapture of Hue city during the Tet Offensive of 1968, Stanley Kubrick takes us on a dark journey.
322;Few movies capture war as intensely and as head on as this one, it is an all.
323;A good story about a group of men slowly being torn apart by the horrors of war.
324;wrenching Drill Instructor which constantly beats the platoon into a pulp, is the most realistic training scence that I have ever viewed.
325;This film should be viwed by anyone with a serious passion for war films and Nam history, NOT a family film.
326;That indoctrination in turn has made the Marine community an extremely cohesive brotherhood that lasts well past our time in the Corps.
327;It's like the most hilarious comedy routine that you have ever seen with a dark twist"
328;all scenes were believable .
329;Thanks to those who do this.
330;Very good for a movie this old.
331;Very interesting and is definitely a keeper.
332;Stanley Kubrick had an uncompromising talent in telling stories.
333;After a while, he begins to go mad, which leads to the first section's unforgettable finale.
334;But even if you don't like Kubrick, the film is worth it alone for Mr. D'Onofrio's blistering portrayal of Pvt. Pyle.
335;Such a good movie and great pricing.
336;The sniper segment still gives me the Willies.
337;really bought this movie for my brother who says it is one of his favorite films.
338;It is an excellent film by an excellent director (Kubrick), with elements (such as wonderful cinematogpahy and acting) that make the experience of watching it all the more enjoyable.
339;anyone who loves Kubrick and movies with a message will undoubtedly enjoy Full Metal Jacket, a fantastic and fascinating film.
340;The beginning scene is my favorite as is most peoples'.
341;This is a great war movie.
342;I am a great fan of Stanley Kubrick, and this is one of his best.
343;Seen it several times and still worth watching
344;The guy is a thoroughly charming and easy.
345;going guy, a real good ole boy.
346;classic Kubrick!As for Leonard, well .
347;Pretty funny, if you weren't FORCED into it .
348;Great service and great movie!
349;R Lee Ermey is terrific.
350;good deal for the price.
351;It's okay is all I have to say.
352;I order quite a bit from amazon, and they have been great !!!!
353;This is my favorite war movie of all time.
354;The war scenes are so realistic you will be ducking to dodge the bullets.
355;This entire movie is interesting not a bad part in it.
356;A great insight into how the toughest soldiers in America think and react in their jobs.
357;As a result it was a nostalgic trip down memory lane!
358;realistic portrayal of our young men in training and on the battlefield.
359;The insanity of it all really touched me.
360;One of the best war movies ever,especially vietnamn.
361;great story and cool soundtrack.
362;one of my favorite movies kubrick and matthew modaine how better can it get.
363;"The sadistic drill sergeant has an amazing gift for obscenity as he trains these his ""ministers of death."""
364;Shows the real life and treatment of men who will become soldiers
365;The first half of the movie which takes place at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island S. c. is by far the best depiction of Marine boot camp in the 60's and 70's.
366;It will bring back a flood of memories for those who were there.
367;Part two which finds main character Joker in the 'Nam is gritty and meaningful.
368;This is a Vietnam America won.
369;Laughter is human, to share it is to be connected with other people.
370;As in all his films, Kubrick uses the identificatory techniques of conventional cinema (point.
371;The movie is actually a cropped version of the Full Screen version.
372;Whether one agrees with the methodology of the training or not, it was very real and in fact worked quite well.
373;i believe the actors were well chosen for their roles and the movie is a winner and a part of my film library.
374;i recommend this film to anyone interested in finding out what Marine Corps boot camp was really like back in the Old Corps .
375;And with all the veterans who leave the service every year, don't you think you would see people walking around with short hair and blank expressions on their faces and no personality whatsoever?Instead, veterans are an impressive bloc of Americans who help drive this country and its economy.
376;The opening scenes on Parris Island where the marines are whipped into fighting shape are brilliant.
377;This section succeeds in showing how it is the goal of the military to break down recruits emotionally and physically into a fighting unit.
378;Ermey and D'Onofrio are equally excellent in the their respective roles as polar opposites.
379;What is impressive about this section is the construction of bombed.
380;"Furst later won an Oscar for his work on ""Batman"" and later committed suicide."
381;The character who connects all of these segments is Pvt. Joker played by Matthew Modine whose deadpan delivery I don't believe is wholly effective.
382;What you have to bear in mind is that Kubrick made the definitive anti.
383;Because of the higher standards that we place on Kubrick and he placed on himself in the canon of his great career it rates 4 stars.
384;wide cement and brick squad.
385;The horror on the young mens' faces when they discover the sniper is a woman delivers what is perhaps the most gripping scene in the movie.
386;war protest, but I think it solidly appeals to people on both sides of the fence and certainly opens the door to some serious thinking.
387;What if this were me, my son, brother, uncle, etc. what if they experience this in days to come.
388;But it is a film worth seeing and evaluating.
389;I also recommend Platoon, Hamburger Hill, and We Were Soldiers.
390;My all time best military/war movie.
391;The Parris Island sequences are engrossing and masterfully done.
392;ordering, and waiting months and months, I finally received my Limited Edition yesterday.
393;"This movie is like Kubrick's other movies
394;The characters and script have provided almost universal punch lines like, Me love you long time or the less well known, They're paying for it, you eat it.
395;the characters would seem today a bit hackneyed but are nearly perfect characterizations"
396;And the beauty of the movie is, the drill sergeant is spot on.
397;kubrick made a beauty here.
398;I beleive this movie to be one of the best released on the Vietnam war.
399;layered film it just gets better to watch.
400;A very good but graphic movie yet amzing for action and blood and there is a little bit if comedey from the drill sargent pretty funny
401;I always love watching this movie.
402;Lee Ermey provides a stunning performance as a drill instructor (he served in the Marines at one time).
403;The Vietnam sequence is a generally accurate depiction of Hue with some impressive combat scenes.
404;Overall a deep insight into what young men must have dealt with during the Vietnam War.
405;This time around, I picked up more of the themes involved and definitely enjoyed the movie more.
406;You continuously see the effects that the war has on the people fighting as well as an ending that keeps you fully involved to say the least.
407;stanley Kubrick's Directoral habits (I use habit's in a good way.)
408;The acting is all around great.
409;The film has a deep impact that you will never forget.
410;Full Metal Jacket is an absolute spectacular display of film.
411;It is a Marine movie.
412;It shows basic training, and ends with dramatic fashion.
413;the costs of series just isnt worth it
414;That is, a really outstanding depiction of the dehumanizing of basic training recruits in a Marine boot camp.
415;This part of the movie is the best Hollywood representation of the boot camp experience ever made.
416;no one can critically say this is a good film.
417;They staged a protest or two, and amazingly enough a lot of people saw the wisdom of their position, and we were forced to declare a victory and pull out, this in the heyday of Tricky Dick.
418;I think they got it right.
419;"Along with ""Platoon"", ""Full Metal Jacket"" is one of the best anti."
420;ray is a big improvement over the first edition.
421;The image is sharp and there is very little grain at all.
422;"This belongs up there with Kubrick's own ""Paths of Glory"" as one of the great anti."
423;Now I can enjoy every moment of it with covering my ears.
424;Full Metal Jacket is one of the best films , Stanley Kubrick ever made.
425;The film has humor, gut wrenching war scenes and brilliant acting.
426;The thing I love about this movie is its originality.
427;and it is in Vietnam that he always complains he never sees enough action.
428;sided at times, the acting in this film is absolutely superb.
429;That's what makes FMJ a very powerful movie.
430;A nice touch was the eerie ending, and the classic Rolling Stones song at the end (the name escapes me).
431;I love this movie since the day I first watched it.
432;i would recommend this movie though
433;The movie illustrates a man's journey from initiation in the Marine Corp to combat in the Vietnam.
434;The movie takes an entertaining and sobering look at America's Vietnam experience.
435;The sudden jump to VietNam in the movie was perfect, I thought.
436;"The only two films I've ever seen that had truly great USMC advisors were this one and ""Coming Home""."
437;So many subtle nuances and Corps tidbits.
438;The first 45 minutes of 'Full Metal Jacket' is one of the greatest things ever put on film.
439;it has it moments, but I can't see what Kubrick is trying to say.
440;Nevertheless it has always been a topic of humorous conversation throughout the many years we've been together.
441;A great movie with a lot of stars.
442;It is definitely one you have to have if you are a collector.
443;I like boot camp the most, so many good lines :.)
444;If you like gritty war films, this one is for you!
445;It's the best Vietnam movie ever made.
446;Great to see in hi definition and the extras are very good.
447;full metal jacket is a classic vietnam war movie It is sort of unique in that it plays like two seperate short stories with crossover characters.
448;Stanley Kubrick is a genius.
449;This movie is so powerful it is hard to put into words.
450;And, I was young then and idealistic and it seemed important to me that year that I should share the same risks that other young men were being compelled to take.
451;Most of the kids with whom I served were bright, funny, anti.
452;Well, if you actually want to know, watch the smartass protagonist of this movie try to rise above the Marine Corps with his intellect and cleverness.
453;,I was in the ARMY in 1969 and did a tour of Viet Nam,so I just liked it !
454;This really is a great movie too, the standard tv size just doesn't do it justice at all.
455;Maybe someday this will be available in the far superior letterbox format.
456;The bootcamp scenes are so realistic and genuine, awesome images and sounds!
457;Whenever I want to remember my days in the corps, this is the movie I watch!
458;The academy for the phony tough, and the crazy brave!
459;After seeing so many war movies, this was a refreshing difference.
460;It starts off and covers the trials and tribulations of basic training and that is the most gripping part of the movie.
461;The rest of the movie is good too, just not as good.
462;Overall I would recommend this movie.
463;A great movie from Kubrick, one of his best.
464;R. Lee Ermey is the best.
465;A truly classic Vietnam War movie shot in true Stanley Kubrick form.
466;the first half of the film is a jarring, realistic look at basic training, and reveals Kubrick's obsession with perfection.
467;the second part of the film shows both Kubrick's wonderful camera work along side some of the lamest excuses for Vietnam.
468;up (whether it's the helicopter ride or listening and watching the gunner .
469;It is this scene that is done to perfection (honest, I think the kid was actually losing his cookies!)
470;there is much to really love in this often brilliant, sometimes shocking film, but alas, there is almost as much to hate.
471;"Between 1 and 10, ""Full Metal Jacket"" gets a 6."
472;The second part is not as good but the PI part is so good that it elevates the final count to 5 stars.
473;Worth a watch, not greatest war movie ever but well made and it keeps moving.
474;Unusual and brilliant writing style, and a quick and easy read, 154 pages.
475;This book is haunting me still!
476;Funny but then transitions to tragic This is a must see movie for a message about life and war.
477;I thought this movie was simply amazing.
478;I paid great attention to the Drill Instructor, because all of his lines, were ad.
479;This movie had some of the best acting I've ever seen!
480;Ermey was sensational as the D. i.!
481;The person who played Pyle, was also outstanding!
482;Definitely a classic worth owning!
483;overall, it's a true depiction of the depravities of war.
484;This is one of the best Stanley Kubric movies by far!
485;Boys become men and learn the terror of war and at the same time learn to love it.
486;i agree with the Boston Globe's assesment that this is the greatest war movie ever made.
487;It captures the essence of war: the mass psychological programming that makes it possible, and the concrete results of that programming when it comes in contact with reality.
488;Being in the Marines in the late 60s and early 70s it brings many memories, good ones and some did I really do and went throughthat.
489;Seen it at least 6.7 times.
490;Crazy man army movie,, to freakin great for me to comment on, i don't have what it takes to explain how great this movie is,, but you have to ask yourself, will you watch it again after the 10th time???
491;Best depiction of what the old Marine boot camp was really like.
492;For a fictional film, Kubrick does an excellent job in portraying the youth of the time .
493;What Kubrick did in order for us to never forget is he took the boot camp that Marines go through and put it right in our faces.
494;Matthew Modine is awesome in his role as a Marine who is a peace correspondent that is still toting a rifle around.
495;Overall a must see film that is part truth, part terror and part Kubrick.
496;This movie is definitely one of the best war.
497;R. Lee Ermey gives a fantastic (and highly realistic) performance as Senior Drill Instructor GySgt Hartman, whose job is to motivate the recruits to learn and progress, and to change their way of thinking, behavior, and emotional responses to those that would be expected of Marines.
498;The first part of the movie also depicts the effect this process has on the recruits.
499;As you watch their responses to the situations they find themselves in, as well as their general attitude toward the war, you can see that the second part of the film is a direct continuation of the first: these men are completely engrossed in their new mindset and the reality in which they are operating, and they are now far, far beyond the line that separates the real world from the hazy world of war.
500;the ending scene is stunning.
501;It sums up the film wondefully.
502;It signals that the former recruits have crossed the line for good.
503;Hopefully Warner Home Video will revisit this title again in the future and give it the remastering it should have received.
504;As for Full Metal Jacket, I was glad to see that all parts of the film are equally good.
505;The first part of the film deals with a very.
506;There's plenty of it, believe me.
507;One of the best war movies of all.
508;Lots of names and familiar faces in this, Vincent D'Onofrio gives an out standing performance as does Adam Baldwin and Lee Ermey.
509;This is a Stanley Kubrick classic and so unlike his other films.
510;Stanley Kubrick is by far one of the most influential directors of all time.
511;He has directed many timeless classics such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange.
512;This film is great because it gives us a sampling of what life was like in the later stages of the Vietnam War.
513;The acting, though done by unfamiliar actors, is spectacular.
514;I give this movie two thumbs up!
515;a very complicated film, Full Metal Jacket really pulls you into the thick of the 70's/Vietnam era and seats you into the marine life of the period.
516;If your a Kubrick fan you already know that he made the best movies.
517;Every one of his movies are among the best of their specific genre.
518;The great Vietnam movie is always said to be Platoon.
519;It won the Oscar, and it is a good movie.
520;We see them as kids, and then as full.
521;The story arch is quite incredible.
522;Solid acting, and a great script was all it took.
523;Oliver Stone, give your Oscar to Kubrick, he outdid you bigtime.
524;Two years ago, some of Stanley Kubrick's greatest films had been upgraded to 2.
525;It's not only one of Kubrick's most outstanding films, it's also one of the greatest war films ever made.
526;It's full of Kubrick's vintage camera work, Lee Ermey's excessive profanity, and some odd dark humor.
527;this masterpiece by Kubrick may not have the same effect that Paths of Glory and Dr. Strangelove have, but it's still a great one by the God.
528;And a NOTORIOUS genius, I would add.
529;so while we enjoy a good film, let's not allow left.
530;wing political sensibilities regarding the military to carry us away from the truth about the Marine Corps and those who serve in it.
531;This is one of my husbands favorite movies, so when I saw it on Amazon a month before Christmas, I decided it would be a perfect gift.
532;He was very excited to get it.
533;Received package before estimated delivery date which was great with Christmas coming up.
534;In the pantheon of great movie directors, Stanley Kubrick has always been one of my personal favorites.
535;blooded, and it is for those very reasons that it is a masterpiece.
536;But Ermey takes special pleasure in humiliating the overweight recruit Private Pyle, played by Vincent D'Onofrio.
537;six minutes in Vietnam, with the Parris Island sequence being the best.
538;"Kubrick cagily sets us up for his view of Vietnam in the Parris Island sequence with Ermey's big talk about how the free world ""will conquer Communism with the help of God and a few Marines"", and how men can become dehumanized into killing machines."
539;FULL METAL JACKET stands as one of the most powerful and devastating indictments against war, and can be rightly regarded as yet another great work from a great director.
540;It's nice to have classics like this available on prime.
541;Streamed perfectly, no issues at all.
542;Comparing all of the Vietnam war movies, I like this one the best.
543;Lee Emery is at his best as the drill instructor.
544;Stanley Kubric tells some interesting stories with serious messages embedded within.
545;overall the cinematography is fabulous.
546;In any case, it never really works consistently.
547;great powerfull movie this was,, i really enjoy how stan dosent have to add a score to make the drama more powerfull thats how good the directing is.
548;i also enjoy the story very much.
549;the only bad thing is it was full screen but still i love this film!!!
550;The 1st half is saved by the strong acting of Vincet Donofrio who is almost unrecognizable if you seen some of his other work.
551;the 2nd half has strong colors and is almost surreal.
552;It differes from Platoon, which is a realistic portrayal of life in the battlefield.
553;It may not be to everyone's liking but it is certainly imaginative.
554;I'm not a huge fan of war movies though, but this is an outstanding, anti.
555;belic view here, with hilarious scenes (the first part of the movie is pure escaping sarcasm) and then some serious segments, more focused on the situations that soldiers have during battles.
556;r. Lee Ermey acts incredibly awesome and realistic here, as an instructor who screechs at the trainees all the time, mocking them up and encouraging them to believe that guns are important, but humans are the grand killer with it.
557;based on the novel by Gustav Hasford, director Stanley Kubrick creates a fascinating movie from the equally fascinating screenplay by Michael Herr and Gustav Hasford.
558;The writers and the director accomplished a very difficult task with a difficult subject matter.
559;the cast treats us to memorable performances.
560;Notably, Matthew Modine, who is perfect and extracts sympathy as a private in the military.
561;Vincent D'Onofrio with his complex portrayal as Pvt. Pyle.
562;And of course, R. Lee Ermey in his unforgettable portrayal as the sergeant.
563;In this aspect, the film succeeds.
564;All in all, a fantastic movie with some very disturbing scenes.
565;timers it is a classic.
566;With few exceptions the movie captures the war and the 60's era as if you are there now.
567;I was there and this is a fine film that pulls no punches.
568;this is a classic, I love how it shows how they are transformed into Marines and doesn't focus so much the war itself till the last half of the movie.
569;Platoon is probably the best war movie ever but this one comes pretty close.
570;The boot camp sequence in the beginning with Lee Ermy as the sergeant is priceless.
571;When we are transported to Vietnam you sense relief for the soldiers that appear to be under less pressure here then at boot camp.
572;There's even comedy relief that Kubrick allows in this midst of chaos.
573;I love the way Kubrick uses the sniper in this movie.
574;If you haven't seen the movie I won't give up the identity of the sniper but it was a nice surprise.
575;The purpose of a movie and with all of Kubrick's work is to entertain the audience.
576;As with most of Kubrick's work this one was again overlooked at the acadmeny awards.
577;I rate it the best of the Vietnam Movies.
578;First part is fast paced with many memorable quotes, while the last part is much much slower .
579;I really enjoyed the movie.
580;Excellent story, action and stars.
581;Very wery wery wery wery good movie.
582;the music that accompanies is a survey of sixties and seventies rock.
583;Both a comment on the war and an expression of joy at still being alive having beaten the odds.
584;This is modern day classic that set the tone for style of war film.
585;I am a fan of pretty much every military movie out there and this one is definitely one of the top ones.
586;Great movie that everyone should see at least once.
587;This film is much deeper than most people see it at first.
588;I highly recommend watching it again after reading the review, plus the extras are great.
589;the second part was actually kind of embarrassing.
590;one of the greatest directors here gives a very good film.
591;one of the greatest directors to step on this Earth gives his view on the Vietnam war.
592;in the film we get great performances from the whole cast.
593;matthew Modine in probably the biggest role he is ever gotten does very good job.
594;i think the reason that he is a great actor is the discipline he has from when he was in the army.
595;he does everyhting great in the film.
596;but what he does in the film that is great,original and the best thing of the film is the whole boot camp scenes.
597;the realism of the training and the hardship that is with taken trough out it is marvelous thing to watch.
598;but that's the only thing to mind that is perfect in the film.
599;the later scenes in Vietnam are good to to a extent.
600;this is good war film.
601;but I do admire his work especially Dr. Strangelove and The Shinnig.
602;those are perfect films in my eyes.
603;this film is another nice view on how the Vietnam was,how the army training works and how wars change people.
604;The day I saw this movie was the day I saw my favorite movie of all time.
605;A Stanley Kubrik masterpiece by all aspects, It is a great movie, superbly shot, and presented in an extremely efficient plot.
606;the plot is one of the best among the myriad of Vietnam movies, because it emphasize on how the soldiers were first greeted treated in the boot camp.
607;It was in very good shape the case was very nice.
608;keep up the good work.
609;The transfer to Blu ray looks great, plus this is one of my favorite movies!
610;one of the greatest war movies ever.
611;Almost like two great movies in one.
612;Every time I see it I'm transported backin time to when I was an 18 year old recruit.
613;After viewing this film multiple times, watched It again.
614;R. Lee Ermey's first role, he steals the first half of the movie.
615;like most people, I do prefer the first half of the film, but considering the technical achievement of the second half (reproducing the Vietnam war in London), I have to give even marks all around.
616;mark this as a 'guy film' par excellence due to its phenomenal screenplay, battle scenes, and testosterone imbalance.
617;But it's still a keeper for all time, and good for as many repeat viewings as you like.
618;Since the late 90's, when I was in High School, I have been told that this movie is a must watch and that this is the movie they make fresh recruits watch before entering the Marines.
619;I loved the war scenes and had to follow this flick because it is gripping.
620;This movie is a man cave classic.
621;Add Godfather, Scarface, Goodfellas and a few others and you are good to go.
622;Can always pull this out of the library and watch it when nothing else is worth watching.
623;This is arguably the best film from Kubrick's late period (in which he only completed 3 films in a 24 year time span).
624;It is a deeply perplexing film, filled with unanswered questions, ambiguities, and the like, but then, it wouldn't be a Kubrick film if it wasn't.
625;Like many Kubrick films, it grows over time, and you see things you never saw before every time you see it.
626;Many friends of mine who served in the military have said that the first half of the film is the most accurate portrayal of basic training they've ever seen.
627;It is 40 minutes of the most intense filmmaking Kubrick has ever done.
628;It leaves the viewer disoriented, but I feel this helps the film immensely.
629;The film is filled with excellent moments.
630;The dialogue is superb, filled with memorable lines.
631;And the ending is very ironic indeed.
632;This is certainly one of the best war films ever made, and one that doesn't cue you how to feel, like some of them do (Platoon, for example).
633;"I never really dug Stone's film
634;This great movie STILL sets the standard for war films.
635;A stunning achievement, Full Metal Jacket is the best of the Vietnam movies and in the top five war movies ever filmed.
636;A deeply disturbing, yet mostly accurate, piece of cinema genius.
637;Bravo to the film execs who looked past any politically.
638;It's not even worth one viewing.
639;The best part of the movie is the first half, parts of which (I think) are viewable online"
640;life soldier in the army) is hilarious as Sergeant Hartmann.
641;This is a excellent film, but hard to watch at times.
642;It reminds those of us who did not serve, that the young men and women who served on the front lines (not in offices in the states) are the real heroes and the Vietnam Vets deserved better than what they received when they came home.
643;The only way your friends will understand it, is to see it, unless they were there.
644;All in all an excellent movie!
645;Everyong loves the infamous Boot Camp scene, that's why I got this.
646;The Vietnam story is still good, and gives you an idea on some of the tactics used back then and now.
647;Full Metal Jacket is the 2nd Kubrick movie that I've seen and I really enjoyed it.
648;I liked The Shining better though!
649;And it's the originality of this movie that makes it such a good movie!
650;It's so original because it's divided into 2 parts.
651;It focusses on a journalist also present in the 1st part that is in Vietnam.
652;This is an excellent movie that I preferred over Saving Private Ryan.
653;I recommend this movie to everyone wanting to watch an excellent war movie.
654;Th acting is brilliant, notably by the drill seargeant who is very convincing.
655;the first part, training camp, was good.
656;i enjoyed the movie up until it switches to vietnam.
657;This film is a real landmark in the story of the American Cinema .
658;the first part is the most powerful of the two .
659;the Second Part is sensitively much weaker and despite it is an original and powerful story , never matchs with the previous chapter .
660;in sum an extraordinary work though Kubrick never reached the anthological level who got in Paths of Glory .
661;Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the key to understanding `Full Metal Jacket' is to realise that this is a Kubrick film first and a war film second.
662;Kubrick makes excellent use of pans, long shots, close.
663;view, and some of the battle scenes in the second half are given realism by the use of hand.
664;"Kubrick also does a good job in set design
665;brainer, but amazingly a dilapidated London gasworks was very realistically transformed into the Vietnamese city of Hue.
666;The first half, dealing with Marine boot camp, is exceptional.
667;R Lee Emery's performance as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is terrifyingly realistic, and has to be seen to be believed.
668;His interactions with his """"maggots"""", especially his relentless abuse of Private Pyle, are at once hilarious and disturbing."""
669;psychopath Pyle is also outstanding.
670;He's really just a pair of eyes through which we see the war and its effects on men.
671;"In typical Kubrick fashion, he refuses to settle for easy answers
672;war posturing is a welcome relief.
673;minded war movie fans should find this a unique and challenging take on Vietnam.
674;I recommend it,two thumbs up.
675;A little bit of everything in this movie, humor, action, some drama, good effects.
676;Full Metal Jacket is one of my husband's favorite movies.
677;The message of Kubrick's Vietnam War drama is more poignant when seen in all its original splendor.
678;It was an accurate portrayal of Marine Corps Boot Camp in the 60's, and the Drill Instructor was perfect.
679;I've read that he actually was a D. i. and it really added a lot to the film.
680;A great movie for those of us who want more 'real stuff' on.
681;In real life combat, nice guys get hit and killed on a daily basis.
682;one you love like a brother fall).
683;This film mirrors, somewhat, my experiences both in training and combat.
684;A 'must see' movie for those who want insight into real life and war.
685;This is an excellent war movie that doesn't seem to pull any punches.
686;I particularly liked the first part, when Joker and his friends are being trained at Parris Island.
687;I loved the scene with Vietnamese Hooker.
688;You handsome man, I love you long time.
689;The exterior scenes set in Vietnam, seemed very realistic, considering this part of the movie was shot in Spain!!
690;When they release the widescreen version I'll give it 5 stars.
691;I am a Kubrick fan and I love this film especially in the beginning of the film I really enjoyed.
692;Then I have reseen it, and reseen it, and reseen it.
693;When most other Vietnam war films have dated this one still has freshness and strength.
694;Kunrick manages, as usual, to capture the dreamlike surreal character of the training of the recruits and the war itself, without ever losing the documentary feel of the film.
695;Only a true genius can do that.
696;another tribute is that everyone can watch it"
697;An interesting role reversal, and food for thought.
698;But they are all timeless, dealing with the nature of war and of humanity, and therefore the film does not age.
699;it's gory, realistic, charcters are great.
700;This is a great Classic Army movie.
701;I really enjoy watching it with my hubby.
702;"And this introduces two of the best chraracters in cinema history
703;This drill insrtuctor is intense, fast.
704;The other character is comically nicknamed Gomer Pyle"
705;Vincent, being a great underrated actor, is a wonderful character actor (look for him in The Cell, Men In Black and The Player).
706;The climax of this first half is awe.
707;inspiring, and shows the horrors of war which don't even take place overseas.
708;He is a humorous character who uses his sarcasm as a cover and a way to point out wars contradictions and satires.
709;He's a strong character who doesn't need to have flashbacks of is best friend back at home.
710;There are so many characters in this movie, and they are so memorable, that it's hard to choose a favorite.
711;They all seem real, with real emotions and actions.
712;"One favorite is Animal Mother
713;In this last scene, invovling one enemy sniper, Stanley Kubrick inflicts emotions beautifully.
714;The music that starts up when they look for the sniper is so eerie and really gives you a sense of what Kubrick was all about(since we all knew him).
715;In conclusion, Full Metal Jacket is a great movie with scenes and images that will stick in your mind.
716;The first part of this film is brilliant in every way.
717;But once boot camp is over the story and the characters that work so well and that Kubrick spent so much time and did such a great job building are gone as he abandons a brilliant character study of being dehumanized and takes off to shoot """"his vietnam"""" The urban war is very original and the battle scenes are amazingly well done."""
718;The ending is very powerful but would have been more so without modine's already annoying voice over returning to help close it.
719;i think the violence in the second half of the movie is pure cinema and is brilliantly shot.
720;Loved it and very much entertained.
721;highly recommend to family and friends.
722;The last scene is poignant and revealing.
723;This is a great movie by one of the most original filmmakers of all time.
724;and one of the top 100 american movies made.
725;A must have for anybody who likes movies.
726;I love the filthy things that R. Lee Ermey says.
727;Its utterly entertaining and worth the price of this movie alone.
728;I list this movie in my top 20 movies of all time.
729;Watch those recruit's facial expressions carefully during the first part of the movie.
730;It's so genuine with the smirks that are given off when the DI yelps his mouth off with hilarious antics.
731;R. Lee Ermey of the History Channel's Mail Call shines as the evil drill instructor.
732;Mathew Modine is truly great as Private Joker Full Metal Jacket is movie that captures the war from boot camp to the 'Nam and feelings around it so perfectly that nothing can touch it.
733;This has brutal honesty and passive aggressiveness all in the same package.
734;And it is also the most quotable movie ever.
735;Great service, will be using them again in the near future!
736;Already knew it was a great movie.
737;Best deal I could find.
738;I searched locally and because of the age of the movie non to be found.
739;I first saw Kubrick's work with A Clockwork Orange.
740;The second half was excellent as well and, to my relief, less upseting than the first.
741;It had some of the most gripping battle scenes imagineable.
742;Overall, the movie was truly great, with great acting (something often lacking in movies), great cinematography, and a great plot.
743;The movie arrived just 2 days after ordering and came in perfect condition.
744;as for the movie itself, it was a gift for my Dad and he absolutely loved it.
745;One of the best war pics ever made.
746;Nothing more to say except, Me love you long time.
747;This is my favorite Kubrick film to watch because it is his most extreme .
748;Kubrick really seems to capture the essence of men in the Vietnam War.
749;It is certainly worth the extra effort, for it is what makes this film a classic.
750;FULL METAL JACKET is definitely worth keeping.
751;and i'm almost positive that the upcoming WINDTALKERS directed by the famous renound action super director Jon Whoo starring Nicholas Cage will be one of the best this decade.
752;all great soldiers come from SOMEWHERE, and fullt metal jacket shows you exactly where to find them, this movie is my all time favortie and would recommend it to ANYONE.
753;a solid 5 star rating!
754;There are two main parts for this movie.
755;This story explores the mentality of each soldier and it shows how war changes a person.
756;He is strict in discipline and he tried to train his troops for the Vietnam War.
757;This caused Pyle to change.
758;Joker said that he was `in a world of s***' but he was happy to be still alive and he isn't afraid of the war anymore.
759;In the training camp, we can see how the Vietnam War can change someone's perspective.
760;During the battles, we can also see the emotions that come out of each soldier.
761;at the end of the movie, Joker found the sniper and it was actually a female.
762;This movie overall was a great movie, it gave depth to how intense and what soldiers require to be in this war.
763;It shows the true inside of a person's mind and the Vietnam War was a huge influence.
764;since I think it's one of the most powerful war movies ever made.
765;I saw it in the theatre when I was 8, and the boot camp sequence stuck with me.
766;basic training is a classic piece of American movie making at its best.
767;Really great stuff there for sure.
768;One of the most loved movie for the USMC.
769;Ask any marine and they will tell you that this is how it is.
770;Stanley Kubrick's film is straight.
771;That is the beauty of this film.
772;Sure brought back many memories, good and not so good.
773;There is a surreal feeling at times.
774;I have read that Kubrick started working on this project well before Platoon , as a master craftsman he took years to get where he wanted before filming began.
775;This film, unlike the other films about Vietnam starts with recruits in Parris Island, being molded into the perfect Marines.
776;(See Paths of Glory an indictment of French leadership in the 1st World War)The transfer was excellent, the sound and picture as I remember seeing them on the big screen.
777;The first 30 minutes or so is the most memorable part of a movie that I remembered.
778;I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys military movies.
779;Simply one of the best war movies ever.
780;Saving Private Ryan is great, Platoon, Little Big Man, Hamburger Hill are great, yes and Go Tell the Spartans, Apocalypse Now and Soldier Blue are a slap in the face, but this is honest and brutal like no other war film.
781;The acting, production, direction and filming is all classic Kubrick and really great!
782;Director Stanley Kubrick has created a masterpiece about the war in Vietnam.
783;Ermey was the perfect choice for this role, having been an actual Marine sergeant in real life.
784;Most of the squad adjusts to Hartman fairly well, but Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) has great difficulty.
785;part two of the film deals with the actual fighting in Vietnam.
786;Stanley Kubrick's directing is excellent, and his coice of R. Lee Ermey as Sgt. Hartman was perfect.
787;I especially liked the way that the movie was divided into two sections.
788;This made the movie that much more exciting to watch.
789;Matthew Modine and the rest of the cast give fine performances, too.
790;The battle scenes are very realistic, and even the scenes with the Vietnamese prostitutes are authentic.
791;I give this movie my highest recommendation.
792;Watch this fine movie and experience the reality of war, from basic training to actual combat.
793;Have always loved this movie, thrilled I can watch it on my kindle to kill time whenever I want, love the prime movies
794;I found it on Amazon cheaper than in the stores and will be happy to surprise him with it at Christmas.
795;I actually bought this as a gift for my uncle, but he asked for it so I'm sure he will love it!
796;great movie a classic gives a little look into the war.
797;a must see i have seen it at least 20 times.
798;One of my favorite genres of movies is the Vietnam War movies.
799;fULL METAL JACKET is not my favorite Kubrick film, but it is still Kubrick nonetheless and the first part of the movie in Parris Island is one of the most memorable acts ever seen in a movie.
800;This part of the movie is also one of the most unforgettable and realistic exposes of Basic Military Training.
801;This is where a lot of people are turned off from the movie, but a lot goes on during this part and Kubrick is able to portray the war in his eyes.
802;Though probably incorrect, still very interesting.
803;fULL METAL JACKET is a true CONTEMPORARY CLASSIC and one of Stanley Kubrick's many masterpieces.
804;It stands out as one of the most unique war movies ever put on celluloid.
805;Great Job got my blu ray thank you very much.
806;My boyfriend is in love with this movie.
807;Clever and entertaining look from boot camp to battle, this authentic movie captures a grunts eye view of battle in Vietnam.
808;The opening 30 minutes are humorous, and show the essence of boot camp with a motivated drill instructor.
809;win situation it was, and this movie captures it perfectly!
810;But Stanley Kubrick's film about Marine basic training and the Vietnam war will always have a lasting effect on the public.
811;It's here and for the next 40 minutes we get the most realistic view of bootcamp and Kubrick's best work.
812;Ermey is so mesmerizing that he should have recieved an Oscar for his performance.
813;This is pretty much part two of the film.
814;Here we meet the last memorable character since the opening scene's.
815;What takes place after that I'll let you find out.
816;But most of all he has given us the best view of bootcamp then on to war, that any movie has attempted to do.
817;It is by far his best film.
818;(Oscar nomination went to it for Best Adapted Screenplay.)
819;Shows both the gritty Marine training that crosses the line in the first hour or so, then shows some emotional fighting to retake the city of Hue.
820;Awesome, to say the least.
821;Hard core, and Hard Corps.
822;But still a good move overall.
823;One of the best movies ever depicting the Vietnam war, fantastic in all respects, directing, acting and scene creation.
824;I can't say enough about one of my all time favorite movies, this with Apocalypse Now are the top 2 Vietnam movies for sure.
825;ray will win for sure.
826;Multible stories in a story.
827;He also helped to co. write the script and it is one of his best movies.
828;It is certainly one of the most dramatic movies I have ever watched and that starts at the boot camp scenes though the final battle scene.
829;The movie features a good script with excellent acting from multiple actors.
830;It even features some of the best depictions of the horror of war and the effect that it can have on people.
831;this movie is ranked among the top ten war movies ever made and it deserves that ranking in my opinion.
832;I strongly recommend it to you if you like war movies and seek realism in what our soldiers went through.
833;This is also one of Stanley Kubrick's best films that he ever made.
834;"i also really liked the performance by R. Lee Ermey(anyone who watches ""Mail Call"" On The History Channel knows who this is) as the tough Gunnery Sargent and I though that it was a very good performance."
835;all in all, I have to say that this is a good movie and I highly recommend it.
836;it is powerful and shocking.
837;Actual two movies in one.
838;Part one is the training, Part two is actual combat in Vietnam.
839;What Kubrick had in mind in this movie was: what does it take to turn a normal young man into a killer.
840;This movie is shocking, funny and unforgetable.
841;Probibly the best war movie ever made.
842;I love it how Kubrick uses the Mickey Mouse song at the end when the soldiers are marching through Hue city(which is burning to the ground).
843;He offers the most voilent scenes with the most light hearted music.
844;But there is a poetic point behind this that surpasses irony and it was mentioned half way through the move.
845;Creating and destroying all in one breath.
846;And it was represented time and time again throughout Kubrick's movies.
847;Great classic movie, bought for a gift and they enjoyed it.
848;Its a radical departure to be sure, but Kubrick in his usual cinematic mastery makes it very gripping.
849;The harrowing and haunting technique of the boot camp part of the movie fully complements the ambiguity of actions and motivations in the second part.
850;, but do expect a memorably made and darkly humorous film that nails down the feelings of the participants.
851;It is a must see movie.
852;this is one of my favorite movies.
853;The first story it tells is such a compelling and fresh take on familiar war.
854;"R. Lee Ermey, as the DI, completely dominates this half
855;The combat scenes have a grungy veracity, and when the troops finally enter the city and meet a sniper, there's a growing terror and suspense.
856;still, Full Metal Jacket has to be considered one of the best war movies.
857;Instead of merely focusing on the action, it examines the psychology of the battlefield mind.
858;The Marines are close to the edge, and their comaraderie borders on the psychotic.
859;it really shows the harsh reality of becoming a marine, by far my favorite and in my opinion best movie ever
860;Stanley Kubrick is without a doubt one of the greatest directors in the history of American cinema.
861;While it's debatable whether or not this film can truly be considered a masterpiece (although most males between the ages of 18 .
862;45 will tell you it is) it is however an unforgettable one.
863;It's one big adrenaline rush from the moment this film begins with the boys at bootcamp to it's shocking, disturbing ending.
864;And this, is mainly because of Kubrick's amazing directing.
865;It's a role in stark contrast to that of the mastermind police detective Robert Goren which he has become famous for.
866;it's also interesting to note, that before Lee Ermey became an actor he was an actual staff sergeant in the Marine Corps for over ten years.
867;skinned cat than I am that's for sure.
868;the film's music is excellent as well, with many songs composed by Abigail Mead, who is actually Vivian Kubrick, Stanley's daughter.
869;In closing, this movie is gritty, and real, and apolitical (which is kind of nice for a change), and with Kubrick behind the wheel, well you know that it's got to be pretty great.
870;a further aside: A good friend of mine, an old hunter/fisherman and Vietnam Vet Marine and I were having a couple of snorts of whiskey the other night and I asked him what he considered to be the most realistic film ever made about the Vietnam War.
871;This movie is a classic.
872;It makes me laugh so hard.
873;for instance, it surprises most people to know that one of our most important stylists considered himself to be an """"objective director."""""""
874;In fact, if you really study the man .
875;you will find that his entire career was really a quest for cinematic truth.
876;but Kubrick's philosophy on realism/formalism was always filled with contradictions).
877;step with popular interpretation of his work.
878;Kubrick had a lifelong fascination with the propagandistic nature of cinema as well as the theme of social brainwashing.
879;"A better word for brainwashing is ""conditioning"" as it's broader and encompasses what Kubrick felt was the most consistent theme running throughout the entirety of his work."
880;A soldier is like a full metal jacket .
881;"For those who are intimately familiar with the man's philosophies, the ""second half"" is a natural consequence of the first half, and succeeds brilliantly in emphasizing Kubrick's fascination with man's duality ."
882;If you liked Kubrick's other films, particularly, A Clockwork Orange and The Shining you will like this one.
883;"unlike ""the shining"" which i found boring(read my review),full metal jacket is half of a great movie,by which i mean that the first half at paris island and the training of marine recruts is in your face movie making at its best."
884;he is scary and in your face and you have to watch him.
885;"he really moves the movie onto another level and brings the words ""break them"" to a whole new level!"
886;funny at first you see how his gental nature begins to warp as he is beat down mind and body by ermey and the other recruts as they start to get punnished for his failers.
887;"matthew modine is the ""star"" here and he does a very nice job,but as said the first half is so good that the second half just really lets you down."
888;One of the best movies ever made.
889;great movie, family watch it togeagreat movie family watch it together!!
890;A gushing review for one of my favorite movies.
891;"That's a very brief synposis of a relatively uncomplicated story
892;roll credits), but through a wonderful combination of intense performances, realistic settings, brilliant dialogue, and breath.
893;taking direction and cinemtaography, it works on all levels.
894;I've seen a lot of Vietnam movies (for a 22 year old), but Full Metal Jacket is one for the ages, because it is more than JUST a period piece.
895;The movie is beautifully and dramatically written, thanks in part to journalist Michael Herr, who spent a lot of time in Vietnam during the war (see his excellent book, Dispatches, for further reading).
896;R. Lee Ermey's performance is as real and frightening as you've probably heard"
897;Private Gomer Pyle, played to full sympathetic effect by Vincent D'Onofrio, is a memorable and pitiable character.
898;"I think the effectiveness of the movie's soundtrack is sometimes overlooked
899;filled war flick (it certainly has its fair share of both thought.
900;The question of excessive force, in many forms, is prevalent throughout the film.
901;Also, this movie is certainly for mature audiences.
902;Even if I wasn't the admitted Kubrick apologist that I am, I would still adore this movie for the fine, deranged work of art that it is.
903;except for the broadly played Colonel that chews out Pvt. joker (Matthew Modine)as the Marines are entering Hue, the cast is very good and Lee Ermey as a former D. i. himself,is outstanding as Sgt. hartman.
904;this movie definitely deserves the R rating it has.
905;i enjoyed this picture a lot but some Marine buddies I know hate it!
906;harrowing, sometimes funny and violent Vietnam masterpiece from Stanley Kubrick is one of his best movies.
907;It tells about the dangers of war and who is the true killer weither it's the marine or the enemy as the movie is a pure work of art from true cinematic genius himself Kubrick.
908;towel punishment of Private Pyle and of course an outstanding music score that is mellowed with a nice 60's soundtrack.
909;The ending is just unbelivably surreal yet breathtaking and the performances are just nothing sort of outstanding, it's definitely a must see motion picture experience.
910;I enjoy the beginning part of this movie, during the training.
911;anyway, I usually watch the beginning part of the film, I enjoy it.
912;This movie gets better with age, and it is easier to see Kubrick's genius now then it was when the film was made.
913;The scene with the jelly donunt is my favorite.
914;The characters and the names or unforgettable: Cowboy, Rafterman, Joker, Eightball, Animal Mother.
915;in my opnion it is the best movie about war and the Marines ever made.
916;Like everyone else, I enjoy the first half of this movie over and over and over.
917;It is by the far the greatest 'boot camp' sequence ever filmed by Hollywood.
918;Ermy will have you howling with laughter at every profanity infested tyrade.
919;If the entire movie had been boot camp, this would be one of the most watched and entertaining movies of all time.5 stars for the first half2 stars for the second.
920;Full Metal Jacket is a captivating and thought.
921;the story in Full Metal Jacket is immersive"
922;The film also packs several war sequences during the second half that feel authentic and intense.
923;The ending of the film was powerful and thought.
924;"
925;The acting was amazing in this film, and so was the music.
926;The cinematography was also beautiful, despite the subject.
927;overall, Full Metal Jacket is an excellent war film, with amazing acting, authentic war sequences, and a stunning ending.
928;full Metal Jacket has strong violence and blood.
929;This is a movie that I have already seen.
930;funny ass movie, the beginning reminds me so much of my p. d. academy days.
931;One of the greatest Vietnam war films of all time.
932;5 stars and well worth the watch
933;I have always loved this movie!
934;Great depiction of how messed up the Vietnam war was.
935;One of the most powerful war movies that I've ever seen, starting with USMC bootcamp and moving right into Vietnam and the savagery of war.
936;Lee Ermey was at his best as the DI, and the lads fighting the war were courageous, united and fuctioned as team.
937;The first hour is harrowing and powerful, with volcanic performances from the actors playing Pvt. Gomer Pyle and the Drill Sergeant, and a quiet but nuanced one from Matthew Modine.
938;After one of the great death scenes in any movie, the action shifts to Viet Nam.
939;What makes this film worth watching is its first half.
940;This is the best boot camp sequence in film history and is the most realistic .
941;I recommend that everyone who loves war movies to see this.
942;popular subject of the Vietnam War but puts his own Kubrickian spin on it.
943;quoted dialogue that has become a part of the cultural vernacular.
944;The first seven minutes is arguably one of the greatest opening scenes in film history.
945;It's certainly one of the most iconic.
946;minded Private Pyle, eventually pairing him up with Joker in the hopes that it will improve Pyle's skill.
947;These scenes at Parris Island feature some of the most hilarious, depressing, and fascinating stuff that Kubrick ever shot and it's all over after a mere 45 minutes.
948;i'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the first 45 minutes of Full Metal Jacket is an undisputed masterpiece.
949;Even so, the climactic standoff with the sniper is one of the strongest scenes in the entire film.
950;england was used as a substitute for Vietnam and is beautiful at times, while at others Kubrick's Vietnam more closely resembles a post.
951;Kubrick's Vietnam film may not be the best Vietnam film, but it certainly has some of the most memorable imagery.
952;With Joker sporting the iconic words """"Born to Kill"""" on his helmet, while wearing a peace sign on his flak jacket and discussing the duality of man (""""the Jungian thing"""") with his Major, there's enough of the high."""
953;"full Metal Jacket features some stunning and unforgettable performances, particularly R. Lee Ermey (credited without the ""R."") and D'onofio."
954;"There's a lack of cohesion between the two parts of the film
955;masterpiece and an undeniable cultural landmark, a film that will stand the test of time among Kubrick's other work.
956;Stanley Kubrick should be applauded for .
957;accurately portraying the American conscience in Vietnam.
958;essentially, this is two films in one.
959;Mr. Kubrick delivers an incredibly accurate depiction of Vietnam warfare.
960;it is one of the best fifty movies made on Vietnam holocaust.
961;Aber, they persist and say """"how can you be A. number."""
962;This is an entertaining movie with some flaws.
963;Roger Ebert's review is right on target but I still liked it more than he did.
964;The widescreen version is now available, so do yourself and the film a favor and spurn this damaged version.
965;Phantom looked great and FMJ not so good.
966;as for the film itself, it is a masterpiece that stands up over time.
967;The combat scenes showing the confusion of urban fighting are extremely well executed.
968;com, price is great, delivery time from store to home is awesome.
969;Just a great, great movie.
970;And even if you don't care about any of those things.you should still watch it.
971;This is the best and most realistic Vietnam war movie ever made.
972;If you are looking for a true account of the war and not a glamorized version, you've found it.
973;otherwise the movie is good to watch.
974;From what I have read it is the most realistic interpretation of what it was like going to basic training and war in this era ever portrayed on film.
975;The film is of course excellent in acting, story, and particularly directing, the only reason I give it 4 stars is because it's not one that I like to watch often.
976;A sobering look at the grittiness that takes the glamour out of war unlike other films.
977;I watched this for my first time a couple days ago and it is a really good movie.
978;All this film accomplishes is creating frustration, and sadness for those who wish to see the complexities of war approached with dignity and true insight.
979;There is no doubt that Kubrick is one of the greatest directors in history.
980;He made thirteen films, some of them huge critical successes, few had commercial success, most were loved by some and disliked by others, but, arguably, all of them had some great attribute.
981;drill Instructor Hartman (played by R. Lee Ermey) is terrific as a hard.
982;I would imagine that this is the most realistic portrayl of boot camp ever.
983;"One of the more poignant moments in the film occurs when a Colonel questions Joker about having ""Born to Kill"" on his helmet and a peace sign on his vest."
984;And thats really Kubrick's motivation for making this film.
985;fans of Kubrick will want to see this film and will find some enjoyment in watching it.
986;It is a film that wants to give a realistic picture of what it was to be a young man entering the military at a time of war, and what kind of man you were in war.
987;Great movie about the struggles of a time in history.
988;Showing the hardships of war and how it affects the troops fighting for freedom.
989;to me this is one of the best Vietnam films of its time, with great boot camp scenes and gritty realistic war scenes.
990;The first half of the movie is definitely the best part as the second slows a bit and seems to get off track but it is still a great film to watch again.
991;One of my favorite movies of all time, love it!
992;Very real depiction of Vietnam War .
993;Pretty graphic but necessary to tell the story the way it was.
994;my husband really liked this movie i am not into these kind of movies but he really liked it ,most men like these kind of movies
995;One of the very best war movies ever.
996;Very realistic, great message, there is no glory in war.
997;You see how each individual is when they start their training, and you see how they change.
998;as one of the few that has also read the book by Gustav Hasford, the movie is quite a lot shorter but it captures the tough moments very well.
999;The main person, The Joker, has a lot of fun remarks, and the gunnery sergeant is even wittier.
1000;I really bought this movie only because of the academy and it's funny remarks and humour, but you get so much more.
1001;On the battlefield you have the truly fearsome scenes, and the truly funny and beautiful scenes.
1002;It sounds more like a comedy film.
1003;The next half of the next half is interesting.
1004;"This 1987 Film, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is about my favorite War Film of all time."
1005;This is one reason why I rate this film at the very top of all war film's ever made.
1006;"True, I prefer the shape of widescreen
1007;Great product and time delivery!
1008;It was a gift for my boyfriend.
1009;War movies are the best!
1010;Great movie overall and, one of my favorite war time movies to watch.
1011;Definitely one of those movies you have to have in your personal collection.
1012;This was one of my favorite movies to come out of the Hollywood Vietnam Movie Period (Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Hamburger Hill).
1013;In this film, R Lee Ermey gives the best performance in any movie ever made ever.
1014;wow wow classic it is a great movie and I have seen it so many times.
1015;Each time is a trip.
1016;There are few movies that every man should own.
1017;I like war movies and this is a pretty good one.
1018;I kind of takes you from being drafted through basic training and on to Viet Nam.
1019;A two part film,the first dealing with a marine bootcamp,and the second centering on Vietnam during the 1968 Tet Offensive.
1020;The first part, is the most riveting pieces of film I've ever seen.
1021;Making the viewer feeling a bit let down.
1022;The film shows a surreal view of combat.
1023;The film's climax is both suspenseful and very haunting.
1024;The last image of the marines walking through a burned out city is both bizzare and unforgettable.
1025;Superb direction,cinematography,acting, and great sound, ( the sounds of distant explosions gunfire) are just one example.
1026;This is Stanley Kubrick's best film.
1027;This is a awesome classic if you love war movies and what soldiers have to go through in basic training you will love the drill instructor and what he has to say to the troops .
1028;It is a classic Vietnam War movie.
1029;Classic film from the big three Vietnam era movies .
1030;Full metal jacket, Platoon and Hamburger Hill.
1031;Gritty and great line and performance by the Gunny
1032;A good movie that goes beyond blood and guts and gets to the heart of some of the men who gave so much for this country.
1033;Because this is a dear film!
1034;I like the character, Joker because he knows how to narrate the story of the film!
1035;His idea of a visually stunning movie was """"The Fast and the Furious,"""" mainly because of how many explosions and cut."""
1036;"Aside from those three images though, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is easily the most visually stunning Vietnam film I've ever seen."
1037;It is haunting to look at, and the tone of the film from the facial expressions, to the color, to the shadows create images that seem to drill right into your eyes, leaving them in your head for the rest of your life.
1038;"That said, while ""Full Metal Jacket"" will evoke emotions from you for it's powerful imagery, the movie is, sadly, a shallow shell."
1039;The problem, I believe, comes in the fact that the movie never really establishes an emotional connection with the audience, even when the visuals do establish something.
1040;It looks stunning, but I found I just didn't care much at the end of the day.
1041;Rather, the great first half carries the rest.
1042;An imperfect, but really fine film.
1043;Nearly everyone was impressed with the brilliant theater of the first half, starring a sadistic institutional drill sergeant.
1044;The visual and verbal images I will retain forever are mostly from the first half.
1045;Definitely one of my favorite, if not my favorite, movies of all time and by Stanley Kubrick.
1046;Dark, poetic, creepy, it's got everything you expect in a great Kubrick film
1047;The first part is a grueling depiction of Marine boot camp which is still vivid in my memory from first watching this over a decade ago.
1048;great film and a favorite with both active military and veterans alike
1049;This is an outstanding movie that captures the mood of the times.
1050;The film has a rather open and non.
1051;The images and camera work is top.
1052;notch as well as the tactical essense of the film.
1053;5 star movie, minus 3 stars for the format.
1054;If you were ever in the Marines or trained as a Naval Officer under the Marines prior to the mid 80's, you will greatly appreciate the first half of this movie.
1055;Do not expect much and compare its AV qualifty with the latest movie on blue ray disc, but this is a great war movie, like the Platoon, to add into your collection of Vietnam war.
1056;I have watched this movie many times and enjoy the action.
1057;Though vulgar, this is a funny and serious movie.
1058;It's a classic that all generations should see, once age appropriate.
1059;one of my all time favorites!
1060;loved it and love it more every time I watch it.
1061;One of the movies you must have in your life.
1062;Kubrick does a wonderful job by reaching into exactly how the armed forces operate and ripping it's proverbial skeleton out to expose the true horrors that exist in war.
1063;The method to turn human man into a killer, to strip away all humanity that he has is clearly outlined in this film, and exposes war for what it is.
1064;Joker, in this movie, is a peace loving man.
1065;As disquieting as this segment is, I've found it to be truthful, too.
1066;He wears a pin that has a peace sign, and then on his helmet is written Born To Kill.
1067;It is honest and brutal.
1068;arley Ermey breaks out with a great performance as the D. i. grim,but well acted overall with Matthew Modine turning in a great performance.
1069;If you do accept the challenge of this film I salute you.
1070;Best boot camp movie ever.
1071;was good to see it again.
1072;There is a lot of talk about this film and other war movies, but this is a character.
1073;driven masterpiece in smaller way, and it has perhaps the best anti.
1074;he is just a whole lot better.
1075;Although sanitized, Kubrick managed to well capture the type of training it takes to make men willing to attack and destroy an enemy.
1076;"Kubrick was not portraying technical perfection, he was trying to capture the real attitudes of men in war
1077;Kubrick was the master of black humor, and much of Vietnam was black humor.
1078;The movie is reasonably faithful to the book until the end.
1079;Hasford created a far more poignant ending in the novel, with an ironic twist that is unforgettable, but Kubrick chose to completely leave this out of the film.
1080;We enjoyed the movie and seeing it with such vivid colors and clarity.
1081;I would recommend this to anyone.
1082;Directed by Stanley Kubrick, this 1987 film packs a terrific wallop as it follows the dehumanization of marine recruits as they are first prepared for Vietnam and later sent there.
1083;As in other Kubrick films which deal with the dark side of human nature, there's a voice.
1084;His creativity in insults and curses is amazing as he prods the weak spots of the men under his command, especially the chubby misfit he labels """"Private Gomer Pyle"""", played brilliantly by Vincent D'Onofrio who won a Golden Globe award for his performance."""
1085;The resulting effect is chilling.
1086;the video moved fast, holding my attention in an iron grip.
1087;The film made a statement about inhumanity loud and strong.
1088;Clearly, it was one of the best war films I've ever seen.
1089;Highly recommended, but be prepared for discomfort.
1090;The rest of the movie is okay at best.
1091;If you want to get a look into Marine Corps boot camp this is the movie for you great movie!
1092;This movie really touches on what life must have been like in the Vietnam war time.
1093;Gunny does a great job.
1094;Seriously twisted at some points and very action packed.
1095;I highly enjoyed this movie.
1096;Would recommend it to anyone, unless you are easily offended.
1097;On the other hand, we had a generation looking to change the way we perceive the world, including how we look at enemies, and whether some people were really our enemies.
1098;The culture shock is difficult to convey, and yet the disorientation in the transition from the first part of the movie to the second part makes a good attempt at having the audience experience the feeling, even if it is in a relatively benign way.
1099;the second part of the movie explores what happens when people who have been exposed only to American culture are faced with the reality of combat.
1100;the movie uses the 1968 Tet Offensive as a backdrop for a series of intense combat scenes leading up to a confrontation between Private Joker's squad and an unseen enemy.
1101;The confrontation is incredible because of the complexity of the numerous feelings.
1102;it will be one of your top vietnam movies it is one of my top 5 war movies get it you won't be disappointed
1103;rays that I keep on hand from the same time.
1104;Full Metal Jacket is the best war movie ever.
1105;this is a psychological film, more human than The Thin Red Line, and more dramatic than Saving Private Ryan.
1106;The actors were excellent too, but it seemed like the film was incomplete.
1107;Kubrick is the master, a god!!!
1108;See this film at all costs!
1109;To keep it brief, this is quite possibly the best war film ever.
1110;I've watched this movie many times and it's really like two movies in one.
1111;Kubrick brings in a legendary Vietnam War film in his own special way.
1112;A stunning often underrated film.
1113;Apocalypse Now is Francis Ford Coppola's take on the war, and it's the most surreal and deliberately absurd.
1114;"Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" was, oddly, the most ""realistic"" of the four films, and in my opinion the least imaginative, though I still think it's a fine film."
1115;"But there is much more to him
1116;Many commentators have declared the film consists of two acts, but actually, it's a classic three.
1117;Act One is the boot camp sequence.
1118;i do agree with people who say the first act of this film is so impressive and overwhelming that the rest of the picture can seem anti.
1119;Much of the reason lies with R. Lee Ermey, whos portrayal of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is one of the most unforgettable performances in cinema history.
1120;And the irony is he's right"
1121;the result is a sequence that is both funny and horrible.
1122;Ermey, with the idea of playing the role of Hartman himself, performed part of the script to show Kubrick how he thought it should be done.
1123;leonard shoots Hartman, then himself.
1124;"His superior overrules him
1125;And it is there, in the movie's penultimate scene, that Joker must face a moral choice .
1126;This is a terrific film.
1127;Another intense film from Stanley Kubrick.
1128;The best part of the movie is the bathroom scene, in the beginning of the film.
1129;The rest of the film is good, even though it was over after the bathroom scene for me!
1130;Masterfully controlling the cinematography of Full Metal Jacket, he rendered every image is a work of art, searing them into the conscious and subconscious mind.
1131;And seeing it in high definition is a wonder.
1132;This version of Full Metal Jacket is crisp and clear"
1133;a series of vignettes held together by characters we first meet in bootcamp.
1134;It leaves a powerful, lasting impression of the horror, irrationality, and, ultimately, the pure humanity of war.
1135;We are killing machines and lovers, passionate friends and brutal thugs.
1136;And, in killing and fighting, we sometimes find ourselves most alive.
1137;It's definitely a great movie about the Vietnam war.
1138;It makes you take a deeper look at who was affected and how they were affected.
1139;another classic movie from a classic director.
1140;Grandson marine,shows realistic bootcamp training Moving exciting and shows are military in action.
1141;proud of all who serve.
1142;most realistic movie have seen concerning training they endure.
1143;It is the kind of movie, fascinating to watch and demoralizing to experience, that can make you depressed about the human condition.
1144;The movie was excellent, the acting superb, etc, etc.
1145;Full metal Jacket is really two movies in one.
1146;The first movie is a very realistic journey through the boot camp process for the marines.
1147;watch the film for the first half and shut it off when they get to Vietnam.
1148;To me, the boot camp is the very best part of the film.
1149;R. Lee Ermey is brilliant as Drill Seargant Hartman, giving a funny and terrifying performance.
1150;Still, it's an overall great film.
1151;I will say that the last part of the film gets pretty intense.
1152;the perfect movie great acting, great story line very true to life.
1153;a lot of movies depict the Vietnam war but this one hits home
1154;This is classic Stanley Kubrick.
1155;Full Metal Jacket is an outstanding film that grabbed my attention by the throat and never let go until the very last frame of the picture!
1156;"The acting mesmerized me
1157;The script was well written"
1158;"But please note: this film contains a lot of profanity and graphic, violent war scenes
1159;Things don't stay happy for long as Rafterman's camera is stolen and both Joker and Rafterman become involved covering the action.
1160;Of course, some survive and others don't"
1161;"full Metal Jacket is an excellent film with a message that war is horrific
1162;I highly recommend this film for people studying the Vietnam War"
1163;The film also explores the issues of duty, honor and sacrifice alongside a moral ambiguity many soldiers grappled with while they carried on the fight.
1164;This has to be Kubrick's finest film.
1165;R. Lee Ermey is the classic film Drill Instructor and his act will be had for others to follow.
1166;Amazing how Kubrick filmed the Parris Island and Vietnam scenes in London.
1167;this movie is one of the best i have ever seen, and trust me i've seen a lot of movies.
1168;the first half is boot camp, with an excellent performance by R. Lee Ermey as gunnery sargent Hartman.
1169;the second half is also good.
1170;my favorite character in the second half, that would be the scenes in Vietnam, is Animal Mother.
1171;anybody who has not seen this movie must make an effort to see it as soon as possible.
1172;the soundtrack is also great, my favorite song being Surfin' Bird by The Trashmen
1173;R. lee Ermey is excellent as the DI (he was a DI after all), and Private Pyle's character's experience was interesting (even with the unplausable ending).
1174;like many Kubrick movies, it gets wrapped up in the device and methods of filming versus story material.
1175;For that reason alone it is worth watching.
1176;Vietnam War has inspired many films, ranging from excellent to abominable.
1177;"in my opinion there are three outstanding: Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979), Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" (1986) and Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987)."
1178;kubrick has constructed his film in two huge parts: Boots Camp and Vietnam.
1179;the first part is by far the best.
1180;playacting has two outstanding performers: Lee Emery as Sgt. Hartman and Vincent D'Onofrio as Pvt. Pyle.
1181;The rest of the cast is good and convincing.
1182;the music score, original from Vivian Kubrick and non.
1183;original from various authors, is very good and enhance the scenes they underline.
1184;the final scene with the Marines singing the theme from Mickey Mouse Club is chilling.
1185;an interesting film for war films fans and anyone interested in the historical period depicted.
1186;There's a lot of movies about Vietnam, but this stand up for everyone.
1187;It is intelligent and deep.
1188;It is cleverly disgised strong critique for war and what it does to men.
1189;If you like movies about war, this is a must.
1190;There are many signs like this, which makes the movie really interesting to look at.
1191;But Kubrick's film goes so far beyond that.
1192;And it works more beautifully than i have ever seen it work before.
1193;film that comes close to acheiving the cinematic and intellectual prowess of this film is Apocalypse now, and Copola had Heart of Darkness to Draw his themes from.
1194;And here it is extremely well received.
1195;Undeniably, in my opinion, the best film of it's kind from one of the best directors of all time.
1196;now this is a movie that will stick with you especially the first half just beware.
1197;One of the great movies of all time.
1198;But the two stories work so well together it is all the more effective.
1199;the cinematography is beautiful and the acting and dialogue is superb.
1200;Will be waiting for a proper edition, remastered and widescreen.
1201;I've been in the army, and this movie is definitely worth watching it, it is very realistic and fun.
1202;, then you're in for a treat.
1203;This newly remastered version has a sharper picture and better color image and new commentaries to boot.
1204;This is a great classic war movie, it gave me flash backs of boot camp.
1205;Be prepared for some amazingly inventive, profuse, and offensive language, but be aware that it really HAS to be there.
1206;One of the classics, Spend the time and watch it.
1207;Full Metal Jacket is worth the time.
1208;The first half is alternately harrowing and hilarious and should dissuade any intelligent, sane human being from joining the Marines.
1209;Typical Stanley Kubrick movie,very well done in respect to detail and knowledge of that era.
1210;As a retired GI I remember all those things that made this movie great.
1211;An insightful adventure into the Viet Nam war.
1212;As a Viet Nam veteran I found this movie to be the most realistic of those that I have watched.
1213;the first part is extremely good, the 2nd part is just good.
1214;they did pretty good with this one.
1215;Great movie, had me cracking up and it is full of action and gore.
1216;I have been a movie fan since I was a kid and a Kubrick fan since I saw Spartacus ( and I know how he felt about it )!
1217;As with all Kubrick movies it just continues to get better with age and it's layers continue to reveal more with each viewing,like many of Hitchcock's pictures.
1218;"Despite those things that are not accurate this movie captures the very essence of all that it portrays with a sense that is almost unmatched in ""war"" pictures."
1219;It's R rating of course is well deserved, but these marines remind me of myself and a lot of young men I knew so many years ago.
1220;As the years have gone by, I have watched and re.
1221;"watched it
1222;It's a ridiculous moment, funny and sweet and visceral, culminating in a pile of hair on the ground, and a batch of brand new men ready to be molded.
1223;I suspect Ermey himself came up with a lot of it himself, having served 11 years in the Marine Corps in real life.
1224;A menacing leer finds its way to his face.
1225;Bravo, because it's a killer moment that defines what follows in its wake.
1226;Gone are the clean and pristine shots of the army barracks, and the perfect symmetry of the men lined up in front of their footlockers.
1227;ho nature of the marines, is palpable in every one of these moments.
1228;The story here comes across like a literate piece of stage drama.
1229;The dialogue spoken by the marines, taking their cue from Ermey's drill sergeant no doubt, is harsh, vibrant, and colourful.
1230;Much of it can't be reprinted here (what can is bleakly hilarious: """"I wanted to see exotic Vietnam, the jewel of Southeast Asia."""
1231;I wanted to meet interesting and stimulating people of an ancient culture.
1232;"and kill them,"" deadpans Joker when asked why he serves), but it became one of my greatest joys in discovering how original and profound and credible the screenplay for this movie was."
1233;Full Metal Jacket is one of Kubrick's more taut movies.
1234;Things move at a quick pace, are often tempered with the deepest black humour, and are never anything less than visceral.
1235;It's a stunning emotional achievement from a director whom I've always accused of being too detached.
1236;Definately a movie that never gets old, you can watch it over and over and always catch something new
1237;The best one of course being what the soldiers had to go through in boot camp.
1238;This part of the film features tons of realistic battle scenes, how each soldier reacts to the war itself, and the brotherhood that develops between the fellow soldiers.
1239;Full Metal Jacket is a beautiful combination of comedy, violence, and the horror of war.
1240;As great as this film is however, I could only give it a rating of 4 stars.
1241;But for the most part, watching the film is a rewarding experience.
1242;Lee Ermey's portrayal of Drill Instructor Sergeant Hartman is one of the best I have ever seen.
1243;The conclusion to boot camp between Gomer and Sgt. Hartman is one of the most shocking and dramatic scenes that I have ever witnessed.
1244;Matthew Modine, Adam Baldwin, Dorian Harewood, and Arliss Howard are all great in their roles as well, and really help to bring the story to life.
1245;although Full Metal Jacket can be quite slow at some points in the film, it is one of the greatest war films ever made.
1246;The boot camp session will have you laughing harder than you ever have before, the battle scenes are realistic, the music is wonderful, and the performanes are outstanding.
1247;classic movie of young men serving their country.
1248;on the way they experience many, many things that will change their lives forever.
1249;Clearly Kubrick was the master of exploring the darker aspects man's psyche.
1250;What perfect vehicle to explore that further than in the counter.
1251;This part of the film has a sense of unity and purpose.
1252;It just never looks convincing, although the final segment with the sniper is well done .
1253;Lee Ermey (Paris Island DI) will stand out in cinematic history as one of the most remarkable characterizations ever filmed.
1254;I personally believe that Kubrick only made this film because the opening segment was so compelling, which is why it shines.
1255;This is one of my favorite movies of all time and for that price its more than enough, fully recommended.
1256;full metal jacket is an incredible movie, it will take you to a really good time watching it.
1257;If you want a good laugh and side cracking movie then this is it.
1258;Very funny, I watched this movie atleast 20 times and laugh everytime.
1259;Marines generally love this movie.
1260;It is one of the most true to life depictions of what we go through in boot.
1261;In the movie we all see at least a few scenes of boot.
1262;camp life we ourselves experienced.
1263;Full Metal Jacket is a very effective movie about the training and war in Vietnam.
1264;Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann particularly illustrates this in his treatment of Private Pyle, (and, yes, Hartman has a lot of fun with Pyle's name).
1265;overall, the movie is a powerful look into the realities of war's effects on people.
1266;"It is a hard movie to really ""enjoy"", but it is a very good film all the same."
1267;I have seen it a few times, and it has stuck in my memory for the way it addresses a very complicated and broad topic.
1268;The beginning of this movie is great.
1269;The drill seargent gave a great performance and so did private pyle.
1270;I excpected a lot more from this movie.
1271;it is with reference to the above, though, that I would still probably recommend this film to students studying psychology, sociology and even criminal justice.
1272;The intense character study that we witness, involving the psychological breakdown of a young, non.
1273;I have a Masters degree in Psychology and one in Counseling as well so that might explain the angle I'm approaching all of this from.
1274;In fact, all one has to do is turn to the nightly news to find real life circumstances of a similar nature.
1275;The Drill Sergeant at Paris Island is one of the best characters in cinema history next to Wolverine, Greg Focker, anyone in Goodfellas and Tyler Durden.
1276;He is in their face, intense, fast.
1277;"Some say that the first half of the movie in the boot camp is the best part
1278;The second half that actually takes place in the Vietnam War is wonderful.
1279;Matthew Modine does a great job as the witty character who is easy to relate with but doesn't have flashbacks of his best friend back home every five minutes.
1280;The movie does a great way of showing his alteration without painting it on a billboard.
1281;My favorite part of the movie is that they all have cool nicknames.
1282;This movie makes the proccess of giving nicknames look really easy.
1283;It's funny, effective, displays emotions and above all, is realistic.
1284;But the best scene in the movie (in my opinion of course.
1285;The character Animal Mother's performance here is superb.
1286;Although it's a movie, it still seems heroic.
1287;The music that starts up when they look for the sniper is genious.
1288;It's so eerie and truly shows who Stanley Kubrick was (because we've all met him).
1289;And the very last scene (a big group of soldiers walking in the night singing the theme to the Mickey Mouse Club Show) is awe.
1290;To sum it all up, this is one the greatest movies ever made.
1291;Clearly captures the essence of """"its all good fun until some one gets hurt"""" then it becomes real."""
1292;This movie first of all was directed by Stanely Kubrick, who in my opinion is the best director of all time.
1293;"The drill sergeant, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is by far the most ""inspirational"" speaker I've ever seen."
1294;As you can see the language and themes used in this movie are so entertaining that you will probably fall out of your seat laughing.
1295;Soldiers that enjoyed it, soldiers who called it great times and such.
1296;I felt this movie deserved to be worshipped it was a masterpiece.
1297;It still holds up as one of the best movies out there.
1298;I love this movie, always have and will.
1299;This movie is great for Entertainment, it is funny and it has some good battles scenes
1300;I am enthralled by this masterpiece.
1301;This one and The Shining are by far the best Kubrick films.
1302;Seriously in love with every single line in this movie.
1303;Got it quick and in great condition.
1304;i've rated this 4 stars because it had such an impact on me, not necessarily because I really enjoyed it.
1305;But I do appreciate the incredible talent displayed by the likes of Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio.
1306;I'm hoping that by putting something down of the effect it has had on me, that I'll be able to put it to the back of my mind.
1307;Playback lagged a bit, but this movie is a pure classic.
1308;Everyone should see it, if only for the pop culture references you hear from it.
1309;I have enjoyed this film for many years.
1310;Full Metal Jacket, however, provides a convincing and thought.
1311;the film begins with a 50 minute boot camp sequence, arguably the most entertaining part of the film.
1312;He wants us to experience how demoralized the young men must feel.
1313;the high adrenaline first half of the film might make you think the second half is boring.
1314;"Whereas Joker sarcastically replys, ""I wanted to see exotic Vietnam, the jewel of Southeast Asia."
1315;I wanted to meet interesting and stimulating people of an ancient culture .
1316;This transfer is just fine, maybe even great.
1317;A brilliant and truely timeless film.
1318;Im still very happy with it.
1319;UPS is a great company and provides good service also I this movie is awesome
1320;Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is one of the greatest wars films ever made.
1321;The film stands with and apart from Kubrick's anti.
1322;Full Metal Jacket takes its subject seriously.
1323;Familiar elements are given new life under Kubrick's wonderful direction.
1324;An old movie that shows the Corps the way I remember it.
1325;Over all it's a great movie and I highly recommend it to anyone.
1326;"The first half of the story was very moving and interesting, then after the tragic event it gets kind of boring when he goes off into the ""field"" or active duty after bootcamp."
1327;This is one of the most quotable movies of all time.
1328;The first half of the movie is the best part.
1329;Its crisp and rich in depth, I'm never seen a better Kubrick disc version of the film (the soundtrack is the great multi.
1330;version tracks from 2007 as well so its perfect!
1331;Some day I'd love to have this in my collection.
1332;Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film is a two part view of the military as an institution more than about Vietnam specifically.
1333;The film is more of a system analysis than the symbolic social themes present in 'Platoon' and 'Apocalypse Now.
1334;This is definitely the best part of the film with the great performance of Lee Ermey as the zealous drill instructor.
1335;"I did like Kubrick's brilliant camera work in filming the combat scenes
1336;We all watch ,have a big fun.
1337;it is for that reason that I will hang onto my original non.
1338;i also appreciate that Kubrick did not turn this into an anti.
1339;Probably just about everything Kubrick did, like Coppola and Friedkin, was good.
1340;But now that I have seen it, feel i can say it is worth the view.
1341;I love this movie and I can see over and over again.
1342;If you like Jar Head or Mail Call, you'll love this movie.
1343;it's a raw, great commentary piece on the Vietnam War, seriously a must own!!!
1344;And it still looks so good, almost like it was made this decade.
1345;it was a very good movie I love it I will give it 5 stars I am going to see it again in the upcoming holiday
1346;My favorite genre of war films are the ones about the Vietnam era.
1347;This includes this film, Apocalypse Now, Hamburger Hill, and so on.
1348;Stanley Kubrick (God rest his soul) in my opinion delivered in telling his view on war from a humanistic standpoint.
1349;By this time, Joker has become a hippie in uniform, and if we look deep into it enough, we can envision a profound sense of disillusionment within his character.
1350;of course this is one best films I have seen about Vietnam.
1351;If one wishes to get further insight of the character of James """"Joker"""" Davis, I recommend you read The Short."""
1352;"This is the best example reviewers give of ""brilliant first part, disappointing second""."
1353;The story is known by most of us: part 1.
1354;Senior drill instructor, gunnery sergeant Hartman played by Lee Ermey is one of the best and funniest characters ever put on screen.
1355;Sure you can feel sorry by the dehumanizing way he treats the privates but it is so funny how he manages to do it with a profanity.
1356;creative dialogue that I just had to memorize.
1357;watch the whole thing, it's worth it.
1358;fMJ is a well made war film full of interesting characters (lots of them) and stunning set pieces .
1359;Even though you have seen it all before, it is still worth watching because the set pieces are just done well and the acting is quite good, most noticeably, D'Onofrio as Pyle, cracking under the pressure of drill training and eventually turning on his own squad.
1360;Kubrick captures Vietnam quite well and Full Metal Jacket is certainly an important film in any collection, as it will be watched time and time again for the high production values and strong acting.
1361;This movie is truly epic.
1362;This is one of the best movies about Vietnam made.
1363;I was in the military for 20 years and the boot camp was very real.
1364;It brought back a lot of memories.
1365;I cant decide which are the best of the three.
1366;The drill sargeant in this movie is amazing, his opening speech to his troops is one of the best scenes in movie history.
1367;I thought i equalled the first.
1368;Matthew Modines performance was smart in this section.
1369;I loved the dialouges in the 2nd half, when the general explains that within every gook is an American trying to get out is classic.
1370;This movie succeeds in both halfs contrary to what many reviews say.
1371;It is a truly underatted classic.
1372;the second half takes place in good ole 'Nam, where our friends are battling an unseen enemy.
1373;better luck next time, Stanley
1374;All in all, I very well done and powerful movie.
1375;Worth a look, especially the first half of the film.
1376;Full Metal Jacket is a fine component of the growing number of `anti.
1377;The dehumanizing characteristic of these soldiers gets extra emphasis under the eye of Kubrick, who makes this a regular theme in his movies.
1378;Easily the most powerful portion of this movie is the opening sequence of the Marines going through boot camp at Parris Island.
1379;The portrayal of how these young men (high school grads, rich kids, farm boys.)
1380;get turned into inhuman killing machines is done with frightening realism.
1381;Full Metal Jacket is a character study of the world these men have to endure and survive.
1382;tiered story arc shows effective representations of this during the sequence in Vietnam.
1383;While just standard movie far for war films, it still provides and accurate portrayal of that world.
1384;"Where ""Full Metal Jacket"" truly shines is during the Boot Camp scenes."
1385;The true standout performance is by Vincent D'Onofrio as a Private Pyle.
1386;am happy with this movie.
1387;honest this is a first class movie.
1388;I think Full Metal Jacket was very funny and had good action sequences.
1389;I liked the training part which was hilarious.
1390;I liked the way the general the general cursed and made jokes.
1391;It was a great movie.
1392;vietnam movies fascinate me, maybe something to do with not actually being born to witness the whole circus.
1393;Anyway, Kubrick did a masterly job on this one.
1394;Kubrick does not rush things, the pace is steady and well.
1395;i think Kubrick did a stunning job with what he had: a few troops, a derelict gasworks and a little pyrotechnics.
1396;Wow, that really was a fine way to finish things off.
1397;Oh, and the music's pretty good too, especially the end credit track (Rolling Stones, I think).
1398;in short a carefully thoughtout and crafted masterpiece, on of the better pieces of cinema to emerge from the 80's.
1399;One of my all time favorites.
1400;This film is very close to the nerve centers of practically all Marines because it so very realistically depicts their experiences in either boot camp and/or Vietnam.
1401;The anamorphic treatment that allows it to fit 16X9 TVs is excellent.
1402;Makes it seem even more realistic.
1403;I love vietnam movies because america just can't get over with godzilla and Bruce Lee combat scenes when you hear screaming monkeys in the background.
1404;for one thing, the film looks great all the way through.
1405;"Douglas Milsome does an excellent cinematography work in ""Full Metal Jacket"" which was only his second job in that capacity."
1406;The soundtrack is minimalistic but it works quite well, never outstaying its presence.
1407;vincent D'Onofrio and Lee Ermey are absolutely spot on during the first part of the movie.
1408;Full Metal Jacket is excellent for those first 40 minutes which contain one of the best scenes ever shot.
1409;"The rest is a good, albeit regular Vietnam movie, which doesn't really bring anything new with it and certainly doesn't do it better than other films like ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""The Deer Hunter"" before it."
1410;I'd watch it again in a heartbeat.
1411;This movie remains one of a kind ( much like that little war in Viet Nam ) and is an excellent work by Kubrick.
1412;Serious movie buffs should boycott the film however until the studio wakes up and presents this film in it's original aspect ratio.
1413;Looks like a brand new film .
1414;This movie is just grand, comedic yet an action flick for those who enjoy any war movie, be it anti.
1415;Full Metal Jacket has to be one of the best war movies that I have ever watched.
1416;Stanley Kubrick is one of the few directors who's actually mastered just about every popular genres.
1417;He is(in my opinion) the master of many genres and the greatest director of all time.
1418;Full Metal Jacket proves that he was a master of cinema and that it deserves the acclaim it gets.
1419;it is still an excelent achievment to hi name and stands with his other famous and brilliant films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove, The Shining, Spartacus, and Barry Lyndon, just to name a few.
1420;Kubrick's infamous Full Metal Jacket still has an impact on the viewer, like it did at it's time of release.
1421;"full Metal Jacket is based on the novel titled ""The Short."
1422;The first half of the film is set in the training camps in America, where we get a full experience of how hard the training, the discipline, and the overall experience of the whole deal was about.
1423;The writing is very well exacuted, with snappy dialogue and scathing dark humour, joker's character is well written, with his lines that are ironic and very enjoyable.
1424;The acting is also great.
1425;The music is what you can expect from a nam' picture, with some original music(the actual motion picture score) that puts us into the intensity of the action and the fears of the characters.
1426;overall, the film is a great companion to Kubrick's films and other classic war films.
1427;This is certainly a film you can watch more than once and is a definate reccomendation to anyone who is wanting to watch a truly brillliant, entertaining and gut wrenching film.
1428;A trailer, and scene selection.
1429;The opening scene is absolutely hilarious.
1430;He finally reunites with Cowboy, who work together in Vietnam.
1431;Will they find the sniper?This is a classic movie, my favorite war movie.
1432;I recommend it pretty much to everyone, unless you are offended by strong language.
1433;It's a great movie, ignore the people saying it should have stopped after the bootcamp finished.
1434;I am not a member of the military or ever will be but when I think of what it was like to be in the marines in that era I see this movie as being pretty close to the truth.
1435;Just a little glorified but still the training sequence is probably the funniest and most dramatic sequence of a film I have ever seen combined.
1436;the film is stunningly photographed, well.
1437;acted, and if not totally successful, is certainly memorable.
1438;Best movie I ever saw on what Marine boot camp is all about, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
1439;I've watched this movie probably five times or more, it's always so good that I watch to the end.
1440;well written, produced, filmed and acted.
1441;saving Private Ryan is a better movie if you like war, and prefer it a little less bizarre.
1442;ray of full metal jacket.
1443;This is a fantastic movie, but please read other reviews regarding the acting, camera work, plot, storyline, etc.
1444;box series, this Full Metal Jacket is pretty much a VHS dub of the movie .
1445;I have watch this show so many times I cant count.
1446;This is a classic movie and I will be watching it many more times in the future.
1447;This movie is a magnificent portrayal of basic training as it really is.
1448;It is a realistic look at military life.
1449;even Vincent D'Onofrio's part as a tormented trainee is very realistic.
1450;ray version is MUCH better.
1451;ray versions, this one was definitely worth the upgrade.
1452;While I don't have any significant complaints about it, I will say that it is a pretty bare item.
1453;Love the movie,love the extras and love the wide screen.
1454;And Lee Ermey is, literally, the real thing.
1455;The best movie about war that I've seen since Kubrick's earlier Paths of Glory.
1456;These are few of the many memorable scenes that fill the unique Full Metal Jacket, further delivered by the one of a kind directing from Stanley Kubrick.
1457;hearted movie by any stretch (though I'm not surprised if this gets criticism for being racist), as there is humanity and goodness within the movie.
1458;Quite frankly, it works that way.
1459;Not every situation in life is like a story, and Full Metal Jacket is refreshing because of that.
1460;All of this is presented with more flair and creativity than your usual war movie, and the movie is surprisingly funny at times.
1461;The dialogue is incredibly quotable and funny.
1462;I know Ermey's dialogue is supposed to be cruel, but good lord, these quotes are just hilarious.
1463;A Day Without Blood is Like a Day Without Sunshine has to be the coolest line ever spoken in a war movie.
1464;another great thing about this movie is the characters, who are much more fun and memorable than your average war movie.
1465;As another reviewer put it, the young men portrayed here are fun, cool, somewhat dangerous, and motivated in some way or another.
1466;Everybody knows about R. Lee Ermey's performance (cool fact: Ermey plays Sarge from Toy Story), Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as Private Pyle, Adam Baldwin as the nihilistic machine gunner who goes off into crazy fits of shooting, and Matthew Modine as the protagonist.
1467;They are all funny, somewhat crazy, have personality, and are entertaining to watch.
1468;stanley Kubrick's directing makes Full Metal Jacket unique as well.
1469;Kubrick is known for making sure every shot was perfect in his eyes, and I think it shows here.
1470;He was a master at the camera.
1471;It's not the slow motion that's unique, it's just the whole way it's constructed.
1472;I also like the soundtrack, both Vivian Kubrick's score and the soundtrack featuring rock and pop artists.
1473;Some of the scenes are enhanced further by music, but for the most part, the minimal amount works well.
1474;The pop songs conjures up moods rather well, in the way rock and pop songs proved effective in movies like Dazed and Confused, Pulp Fiction, and Trainspotting.
1475;The first half, in my opinion, is fairly easy to understand, about how war is not for the weak or dependent.
1476;Private Pyle's breakdown and eventual suicide is an interesting theme for me, being one who has seen plenty of bullying thanks to exposure of some lame Vocational class I took (though that class was filled with plenty of socially adapt people, so we weren't all lonely misfits.
1477;Even better, aside from the lame scenes regarding Vietnamese woman, all of scenes are watchable and interesting.
1478;That's why this movie truly deserves to crack top spots in polls for great war films.
1479;I recommend the video, particularly if you ever served in the Marine Corps.
1480;The first hour of this movie is truly remarkable.
1481;Thanks primarily to R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D Onofrio who turn in unforgettable performances.
1482;Both of these actors were amazing.
1483;His performance as a tough and heartless drill instructor is one of the most realistic and powerful performances ever put on film.
1484;The realism of life in a tough training facility for future marines is about as true to life as any film has ever been able to get.
1485;Still the result pretty dramatic and very well done.
1486;But its the first hour of this film that you will remember more than the rest of it.
1487;But all in all this film is a solid movie that is hard to forget.
1488;Full Metal Jacket is really two movies in one.
1489;Unlike, FMJ, it's got a good plot and the acting is solid.
1490;Full Metal Jacket is one of the best, and most powerful war films of all time.
1491;"if you've read the book, you'll understand the way the movie seems to ""jump"" from one setting to the next, mentioned in other reviews here."
1492;The movie reproduces this narative, enhanced by the imagery that is trademark Kubrick.
1493;You will be immersed in this film.
1494;this is a terrific film, and it stands on its own merits.
1495;read the book, you'll better understand the imagery of the film, the transformation of the central character, and why the film ends the way that it does.
1496;I always enjoy a good old school movie to get together with my war buds and enjoy the afternoon chilling.
1497;Kubrick and R Lee Ermey made me a believer.
1498;very nice well worth the wait.
1499;this is the best conversion i have seen.
1500;Most of the marines I know say that this is the most realistic movie for them.
1501;Probably three stars at the time.
1502;ray, I liked it much better.
1503;I considered giving it four stars, because it's probably not the action.
1504;packed story most people are expecting.
1505;Consider it more of a documentary, with a light philosophical touch.
1506;Full Metal Jacket is a classic movie, a must see by anyone.
1507;I love this movie and I think others will to.
1508;"The movie remains fascinating to watch throughout despite the fact that the plot appears curiously ""inconsequential"" at times."
1509;Exhilarating, though, and it makes you laugh at times at the histrionics and the superb command of the Drill Sergeant (who, I believe was a REAL sergeant chosen to act in the film), and almost makes you forget the damage possibly inflicted on a number of fragile young men.
1510;"It all appears, again, almost breezy and ""inconsequential"", yet there is a clear and unmistakeable crescendo that creeps up on you as the movie slowly draws to a close."
1511;and it triumphs, again, in the subtlety of the chosen action before your eyes.
1512;key but resonates quite profoundly.
1513;this ending is the more remarkable for humanizing, to an extent, the enemy.
1514;Stanley Kubrick has a track record that stands alone amongst film makers.
1515;always doing things his own way and in his own style.
1516;the film is beautifully shot and the attention to detail is almost perfect and as always,Kubrick never left England but did manage to make you think that you ARE in Vietnam.
1517;certainly one of the most vivid and intense portrayals in film history.
1518;realistic edge to this amazing film.
1519;to say that this film is one of the most thought provoking and intense films ever made and directed by one of the most courageous and taleted men ever in this medium is really just not strong enough.
1520;Wonderful piece of film making.
1521;My grandson told me about this movie and so I decided to watch it and see.
1522;there is a lot of comeraderie and this movie did a good job of showing that with the men.
1523;That they are, but one has to realize that it's another world over there in the war zone, and how you cope and are able to get through it sometimes would be deemed bad or wrong.
1524;Full Metal Jacket embodies many things that were common in the Vietnam war.
1525;I bought it at the recommendation of my son, a newly.
1526;"He calls FMJ the ""Marine Movie."""
1527;Even so, the film gets it right on both counts.
1528;The experience of Marines in combat, especially in Vietnam, is as the film demonstrates.
1529;i'm blind in my right eye and right.
1530;The Marines are indeed the best we have, the inspiration for Army Rangers and Delta Force and Navy SEALS.
1531;The dual nature of man, wherein he is able to embrace both war and peace simultaneously, is addressed by director Stanley Kubrick in the decidedly anti.
1532;It's hard stuff to swallow at times, but engrossing, and Kubrick manages to gradually build the emotional intensity that gives such impact to the climax of this first part, which is without question the strength of the entire film.
1533;"The pace of the film is very deliberate and much of the dialogue has a ""staged"" sense about it that, rather than underscore the issues being addressed, has more of an alienating effect which serves to neutralize the emotional aspects of what is being presented."
1534;"There are two memorable performances here, one by Vincent D'Onofrio, who did an exemplary job of creating the hapless Leonard
1535;Also worthy of note is the work of Arliss Howard, who brought """"Cowboy"""" so credibly to life."""
1536;"With ""Full Metal Jacket,"" Stanley Kubrick raises issues that are important, and makes some valid points about the causes and complexities of war, and the moral and ethical challenges of those presented with it."
1537;"Obviously, this was a passionate endeavor
1538;I was discharged honorably and even extended an extra year because I liked the experience and was treated with high regard.
1539;then, I got to the Vietnam scenes.
1540;its aim is to make an accurate portrayal of an intelligent soldier's life from boot camp to the jungles of Vietnam.
1541;Without thinking about whether or not war is good or bad, without thinking about metaphors or symbolism, stripped of anything but the raw images on the screen, this movie in its entirety finally struck me for what it is, and it is a masterpiece.
1542;and in this sense, this bewilderment, if purposefully done, is indeed what makes this movie a masterpiece in my mind as well in its portrayal of war.
1543;add to that Kubrick's hidden images (there is an excellent, albeit radioactively liberal analysis of symbolism in FMJ on youtube called """"the Hidden Hand""""), and you get something that deserves multiple replays."""
1544;A couple more times, and especially if you served, you'll get the rest as well.
1545;But with the action events in all it gets a passing grade from me.
1546;If this movie stopped before everyone went to Vietnam, I would still give it 5 stars.
1547;R. Lee Ermey's performance as the drill seargent was spot on and definately reminded me of my time in boot camp and long time ago.
1548;He should be at least received a nomination for best supporting actor.
1549;this movie is absolutely unbelievable.
1550;everything about it is good.
1551;my uncle was in the marine corps and he said this movie is a vivid picture of what he went through before going to vietnam.
1552;was he a real sergeant, because it sure looked like it.
1553;it is a depiction in what the boot camps are like in this time.
1554;i give it a high five!
1555;This is a great movie.
1556;Definitely NOT a family movie.
1557;Acting and casting are awesome.
1558;See how many lines from the movie you memorize!
1559;The next setting is the actual battle ground.
1560;always good to watch Viet Nam movies, especially if you're a Marine.
1561;Very classy woman and she makes the movie.
1562;added this movie to my collection
1563;Everyone knows about this one.
1564;and Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) is the best of the first part.
1565;but you gotta watch the whole movie,because it's ALL good.
1566;The first half of the movie set in Paris Island Marine recruit training base is great and has an awesome performance by R. Lee Ermey as Gny.
1567;Matthew Modine, joker is very good throughout.
1568;I have always enjoyed this great movie and now that I am starting to use my Blue Ray player more often, I am glad to see a classic like this one on Blue Ray.
1569;There are lots of movies on the Vietnam War out there and this is certainly a good one.
1570;Can you imagine how convincing that was?There's something deeply (and sadistically) humorous at how much power his character holds over the recruits.
1571;again, I must be honest.
1572;pyle (played wonderfully by Vincent D'Onofrio) is a perfect sad.
1573;As good as the film is and as wonderful a director as Kubrick was, this film was lost in a flurry of Vietnam movies.
1574;That very fact consigns it to also.
1575;Boot Camp and served with 2/5.
1576;One day later, Big Problem.
1577;The reviews I have seen so far say that the first part of the movie is the best.
1578;The first part of the movie is known primarily for being funny, and having some interesting quotes (overall, I'd say this is about the most quotable film ever).
1579;I liked the story line and the way it progressed.
1580;What i don't like is you have to write X amount of words to do a review.
1581;One of the best moments is Modine trying to explain his peace pin and the duality.
1582;vincent D'Onofrio is amazing as Pvt. Lawrence.
1583;You can't help but empathize with Lawrence.
1584;He defies authority with the instincts of a ferocious animal but, at the same time, reveals a sincere and endearing concern for the welfare of his comrades.
1585;And perhaps at least a few will share my own initial reaction: Full Metal Jacket consists of two separate but inseparable films which share the same title.
1586;Together, they have enduring dramatic impact.
1587;It's perhaps one of Stanley Kubrick's best work.
1588;Leo DonOfrio and Matthew Modine were outstanding in their respective roles.
1589;The basic training sequence is very accurate as to the actual training to our marines.
1590;The combat scenes are very graphic and the interaction between the men is also very realistic.
1591;This movie about Marine Basic Training and The U. s. Marines in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive is very educational and entertaining.
1592;First, Gunnery Sargent Hartman is the most loved and hated man among the recruits.
1593;This book is right on as far as the boot camp and the war scenes.
1594;More people should be sensitive to those times!
1595;this movie makes a point about the American empire with volunteer soldiers killing because they love it.
1596;And this movie is a favorite among Marines no matter where they are.
1597;if you've got any friends, relatives or acquaintances that are in the Corps, this is always a winner of a gift.
1598;"Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" seems like an uncomplete film, but to me that's poetic to one of America's uncompleter wars."
1599;Kubrick is the true master of atmosphere in film.
1600;He makes you feel like your there.
1601;I think this movie is genius on many levels, as well as it has so many relevant issues even today.
1602;"This movie show more than most movies a true representation of how life in Bootcamp as well as day to day life in the mi
1603;This movie is an absolute classic and I suggest everyone watch it, since it shows plenty realities that confront our troops often.
1604;Definitly a must see, imo.
1605;This is one of the greatest movies ever made.
1606;I bought it for a very reasonable price.
1607;It arrived at my home in a timely and military manner.
1608;This is by far my favorite Vietnam movie.
1609;The language is pretty rough but true to life I suspect.
1610;If you're okay with that, enjoy!
1611;Love this movie, one of the best veitnam movies just under the deer hunter.
1612;R. Lee Ermy is the best drill instructor ever
1613;very good movie very good action comedyI recommend it to anybody I'll watch it over and over the hill is a very good
1614;I still feel Platoon is a very good movie, but when I watched Full Metal Jacket, everything else started coming off as fluff.
1615;The acting in this movie is jaw.
1616;Vincent D'Onofrio is the standout, with a performance that should easily have garnered an Oscar.
1617;is haunting and works perfectly with the movie.
1618;Roger Ebert once criticized this movie, but unkowingly gave it its greatest compliment being the schmuck that he is.
1619;The movie never drags or slows down and Kubrick does an incredible job with the background sounds(as with all of his movies!!)
1620;Pretty brutal and yet realistic look at the war.
1621;He was obviously drafted into a world that over.
1622;So, killing his tormentor before killing himself was just poetic justice and a story with a reasonable happy ending.
1623;This is a classic film that brings in great actors and one that wasn't even an actor that earned a great part.
1624;He was an advisor from the military to treat the actors as if they were in boot camp and he was so good, they gave him the part.
1625;I suggest you watch this and know there will be violence and a great story.
1626;the first half is classic.
1627;even the second half is good.
1628;great cast, dialogue, and editing.
1629;And R Lee Armey was just fantastic.
1630;This movie is not for the faint of heart, but I highly recommend it.
1631;It's one of those movies you have to see to keep up with your buddies quoting it, and the various references to it in pop culture.
1632;He said it was the most realistic movie of the Vietnam war.
1633;Lee Ermy adds a lot of realism to the bootcamp scene.
1634;Probably could use some more battle action, but is highly recommended for viewing.
1635;I have always been a huge fan of this movie.
1636;ray makes it even better.
1637;If you like this movie, you will love it on blu.
1638;either way I got it cheap and I love the movie.
1639;ray transfer seems very vivid and the sound is great.
1640;Good all around movie,the first hour is memorable.
1641;ray better than thought possible.
1642;The training and his die hard efforts to mould us into men and brothers kept many of us alive and brought us home.
1643;So I thank this film for showing that side of Marine life.
1644;full Metal Jacket brought back the memories of the making of a brotherhood and the """"earning"""" of the title."""
1645;the moments others remember as laughs in classrooms, I remember as terror in the jungle.
1646;Thank you for telling our story.
1647;time classic is as close to boot camp you'll want to be.
1648;True to Kubrick's nature, it is a powerful and thought provoking movie and one in which everyone can find some meaning and significance.
1649;For many reasons then, I highly recommend people see this movie at least once.
1650;Full Metal Jacket, Stanley Kubrick's take on the Vietnam war, is essentially two films packaged as one.
1651;The first half is an amazing piece of cinematic work, while the second half is not quite up to snuff.
1652;the first half, as I said, is amazing.
1653;having said that, I still find myself being forced to rate the film at 4 stars, that's how great the first half of this film is.
1654;Its a great classic that needs to be seen to appreciate the many sides of war.
1655;I love the little Commie bastards, man, I really do.
1656;These are great days we're living, bros!
1657;are the finest human beings we will ever know.
1658;this film's a masterpiece and the memorable characters being the 'lovable' Drill Instructor Hartman .
1659;You will give your rifle a girl's name!
1660;One of the best war films of all time.
1661;the acting,the action,the story is all amazing.
1662;if you love war movies,than I highly recommend this one.
1663;One of the classic war stories.
1664;I liked the movie especially since I am a veteran.
1665;This stands the test of time well.
1666;this is all wonderfully filmed by Kubrick, with the training camp scenes and the shattered Vietnam like town near the end being memorable highlights.
1667;R Lee Ermey steals the acting honours without actually acting!
1668;As Gny Sgt Hartman he is perfectly cast for one very good reason.
1669;Add in the commentary track as a bonus and its easily worth 5 stars.
1670;This may be the best tring sequence ever done.
1671;This movie is a classic.
1672;First half is the best basic training piece since Officer and a Gentleman IMO.
1673;Second half is well paced and gritty and Kubrick all the way.
1674;I have watched this movie many times and it still is one of the most realistic Vietnam stories every told.
1675;Stanley Kubrick has always had a fascination of the military (i. e., Dr. Strangelove, Paths of Glory).
1676;And in this movie he shows us what life is like in the US Marine Corps Boot Camp.
1677;Real life drill instructor turned actor, R. Lee Ermey gives a tour de force performance and turns the first 45 minutes of this movie into a Nuclear Hurricane!!
1678;Brilliant stuff and a Must Have for anyones war collection.
1679;Their final confrontation is powerful material for the ages to be sure, but I would have been interested in seeing this tubby misfit turned killer set loose on the VC.
1680;I'm glad to be alive every day .
1681;Adam Baldwin's Animal Mother is hilarious and scary at the same time, the scene in the helicopter with the nutzo door gunner bragging about 52 confirmed dead water buffallo is so over the top it is perfect, and one really does get the impression that anyone who has survived sustained combat emerges a changed person, no matter how rational they were beforehand.
1682;so since it was Kubrick's own decision to chop and reformat the image, one has to kind of live with it I guess.
1683;i mean it was original and had a good.
1684;special guy to say the least, alright I'll say it.
1685;the 2 greatest charactars of the film.
1686;dispite that it was a good movie.
1687;Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
1688;I'll be the first to get this one.
1689;I have read a lot of people's reviews of this film and they talk about the director being a sham and the acting phony and so on.
1690;but I will say as a vet, that every step of this movie is real.
1691;It is so real that it is hard for me to watch.
1692;Although this film has a bit of independent movie flavor, it still ranks as one of the best.
1693;Showing both the humorous and distasteful side of the Vietnam conflict I highly recommend it for those who enjoy dramatic and suspenseful themes.
1694;It is an altogether dark film, with flashes of hope here and there, and ends with the message that the soldier can be many things yet at the end of the day just wants to be alive.
1695;This is not a movie for young people, as it contains scenes of very graphic violence, but this is the realism of war that makes it great.
1696;It well captures the individual personalities that represent the men who fought in this conflict.
1697;Fantastic Movie with great actors.
1698;this one's for fighting, this ones for fun!
1699;"The first half of the movie is pretty good, until 'joker' actually gets to 'nam
1700;one of the best war movies out there, if you like the real feeling of life in the service get this
1701;If you were in the military, the first half of the movie on boot camp is right on.
1702;I obviously like military movies and this is one of the best movies about the Marine Corps and the Tet offensive.
1703;This movie gives a good idea what boot camp is all about.
1704;Being a child of the 60's the sound tract is awesome as well.
1705;Great movie, great service, great pizza, great times with friends, great escape, great wall of China, great Chicago fire, great depression
1706;This is a true masterpiece, a work of art, and the best war movie I have ever seen.
1707;It's not a """"Hollywood"""" war film with a happy ending."""
1708;And they did that so well, in part of the excellent acting by Vincent D'Onofrio, and in part of the script in general.
1709;cut with moments of sheer emotional detachment.
1710;Full Metal Jacket scores points for devoting a substantial amount of time to the basic training program that the soldiers go through.
1711;Oftentimes this aspect of war films is just covered in passing so that more time can be spent on the more riveting battle sequences.
1712;Kubrick, like Alfred Hitchcock before him, is a master film.
1713;The end result in this case is a superbly crafted film that just feels flat from start to finish.
1714;Having experienced the Viet Nam war first hand this movie, like Platoon and others, rang very true and brought back many memories both good and bad, but very real.
1715;It shows the many types of characters and personalities you encounter when thrust into that kind of environment.
1716;I thought this movie was excelent and I recommend it to the more mature audience.
1717;It was very well done.
1718;Absolutely love this movie I have watched this movie many many time and I am gonna watch it many more times it's one of the most realistic military movies I have ever seen
1719;Lee Emery's depiction of Gunnery Sgt. Hartman was genuinely scary.
1720;This was a casting coup for Kubrick, but that's where the genius ended.
1721;Finally a heroic, and merciful act, but even that can be up for debate.
1722;This is told with two plots: that of winning the war and the second of the declining morality of the marines.
1723;the movie is a great testament to the anti.
1724;The first half of the movie makes a tight dramatic point that training marines to be killer has some inhumane consequences and proves it with Pyle's suicide.
1725;in the first half of the movie, Pyle's suicide is juxtaposed with the success of class of marines all graduating.
1726;First time I watch this movie was with my husband.
1727;Another great war movie, they even let us watch this in Marine bootcamp for Christmas.
1728;Good Nam War movie a must have if you're a fan of military conflict action style movies.
1729;I just loved this movie.
1730;Streaming makes the Amazon Prime account a great value.
1731;Great American classic war movie about Vietnam.
1732;So many great quotes from the drill instructor that will last through the ages.
1733;This movie is timeless, I use to watch it when i was a very little girl.
1734;I just ordered it again to watch and get a understanding of it.
1735;It was awesome and very funny at points and serious and eye opening.
1736;Excellent Vietnam period piece, one of Kubrick's best.
1737;The rest of the movie was fine.
1738;"For those unfortunate souls whose first exposure to Kubrick's films was Eyes Wide Shut, definitely see this movie
1739;This movie is one of the best vietnam films ever made.
1740;This is one of the greatest movies of all time.
1741;Very good, it was intriguing to sorta see what went on in Viet Nam.
1742;Being a Vinnie fan, I had to see this.
1743;it actually got here quicker than I thought it would.
1744;Kubrick's """"Full Metal Jacket"""" is a classic film of the war genre and what can be said about Lee Ermey?"""
1745;His part as the DI is done well.
1746;true to form, especially since he served as a Marine DI way back in the day.
1747;This is definitely Kubrick's darkest film.
1748;The performances given by Vincent D'Onofrio, Matthew Modine, and R. Lee Ermy stand out and give this beautiful film it's surreal, depressing mood.
1749;This film would best be described as a mix of Apocalypse Now and Taxi Driver, in terms of atmosphere and lighting, as well as some elements of plot.
1750;"He was an unparalleled master of technique and form, releasing unequaled classics like ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""2001,"" and ""The Shining."""
1751;But even great directors have at least one subpar movie in their resume, and this puppy is it.
1752;Full Metal Jacket is really two films blended into one.
1753;The first half is easily the more effective of the two.
1754;Here, we get an unflinching look at the day.
1755;It's simultaneously unsettling and hilarious.
1756;But there are definitely Kubrick touches that help make the film interesting.
1757;"A lot of the photography recalls the clean and sterile images of ""A Clockwork Orange."""
1758;It is grittily realistic, has great acting and direction, and is quite well.
1759;Everyone in it is great .
1760;The second half is actually in Vietnam.
1761;While some parts of the second half are underwhelming compared to the first half, it really is just as good.
1762;It has many themes in it, and is very realistic.
1763;Full Metal Jacket is awesome.
1764;Gallows humor and war violence erupts on the big screen.
1765;"This is ""Full Metal Jacket,"" raw, hard, and one of the best war movies made in the last quarter century."
1766;"A stunning amount of dedication and energy is present in ""Jacket,"" making for an unconventional and humorous take on one of the world's weirdest wars."
1767;the first half of the film, dealing with the training of these raw soldiers, is hilarious and frightening.
1768;Ermey's crazed Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is one of the funniest characters ever put on film, and all of his lines are hysterical and impressively effective.
1769;"Dark humor triumphs in the first half like war movies very rarely achieve, and this is part of what makes ""Jacket"" such a unique and wonderful movie."
1770;The second half calms down a bit, which is ironic because this is the half of the film where the combat takes place: This is the half with the Tet Offensive, and it's a disturbing, sobering and breathtaking piece of cinema.
1771;Truly excellent acting comes into play here, as do important political messages and a round of unique character development that takes it a step further from what the first half left us with.
1772;Though not as funny or entertaining as the first half of the movie, it is still a glorious piece of cinema, and it looks tremendous even by today's standards.
1773;"this is one of Kubrick's most entertaining efforts, and not quite as polarizing as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or ""A Clockwork Orange."""
1774;"All the characters have a grounded ""real world"" feel to them, due to both the material and the versatility of the actors."
1775;R. Lee Emery is viciously delightful as the manic Sergeant Hartman, while managing to add occasional touches of humanity and a `this is for your own good' attitude through subtle gestures.
1776;Matthew Modine is the amiable lead, Private Joker, and as such balances the hard and soft edges admirably (if not spectacularly).
1777;There's a wonderful innocence about him in the beginning, which transforms into a frightening hardening of his soul later on.
1778;hope look he gives later on remains as the most frightening looks ever seen depicted onscreen.
1779;"A haunting, humorous, and often horrendously difficult film
1780;It is the most engaging look at the Vietnam war, in a simplistic Kubrick kind of way.
1781;What i enjoyed about Full Metal Jacket was the sheer minimalistic way it was filmed.
1782;A total enthralling movie, and absolutely great cinematography.
1783;Great move but the transfer to blu.
1784;The best kubrick to date, bring back private piles
1785;Full Metal Jacket is the movie I want to remember Stanley Kubrick by.
1786;The boot camp scenes are the best and the actor who portrays the drill sargeant is great .
1787;I think that this movie is one of the best I've ever seen dealing with Basic Training and war.
1788;It's odd for a female to be writing a review for a war movie, but I really enjoyed it, being the Army.
1789;I can relate to the events in their Basic Training.
1790;Watch it, it's a real eye opener.
1791;I really like the drill instructor (R. Lee Ermey) and his ability to bring realism to the roll.
1792;Let me just add for the record that it's pretty clear Kubrick never intended to make a realistic film about what """"actually"""" happened in Vietnam."""
1793;"But as the last film made from beginning to end under Kubrick's exacting specifications (""Eyes Wide Shut"" was completed after his death), ""Full Metal Jacket"" is definitely worth watching."
1794;a film this important deserves an archival.
1795;"but the film is presented in ""full screen"" pan."
1796;screen TVs and the like.
1797;Shows the psychology and psychy at play in Marines Boot Camp as well as a great view into the Vietnam War.
1798;A great story about Vietnam and boot camp.
1799;Loved the actors included in this film such as Vinnie and Lee.
1800;The first time I saw this film in the theater I completely enjoyed it and would have given it 4 or 5 stars easily.
1801;I ordered it for a friend of mine.
1802;The vendor was great on the return and refund of the money for it.
1803;It was one of those timeless movies of Parris Island basic training boot camp.
1804;Parris Island was hard and the movie got the gest of it.
1805;so if any of you brave souls wish to become a Marine then this will give you insight on training.
1806;Full metal jacket is a two part masterpiece by director stanley kubrick.
1807;The film features great cinematography and gets away from the jungle seen in most vietnam flics by taking the recruits throught the city of hue during the tet offensive.
1808;This leads to a gripping and distubing ending.
1809;Intriguing characters and storyline make this a cinematic hit.
1810;I've watched this Movie close to 30 times and it keeps getting better.
1811;I streamed this movie over amazon.
1812;If you haven't seen FMJ and have ever been entertained by anything military, watch it.
1813;This was my third time watching it, so I can also say it is totally worth another watch or two if you've only seen it once.
1814;Full Metal Jacket was among the last of the movies based on this theme to reach the audience in the 80's.
1815;The effect was that, both in terms of format and contents, it felt quite realistic and altogether encompassing.
1816;I ALWAYS liked the first part .
1817;I also like that the fighting is in a developed area (Hue), because a lot of the fighting wasn't in the jungles, and often that's forgotten.
1818;Just a great movie from beginning to end, but the first 45 are the most iconic.
1819;One of the best movies made and they destroyed it by putting it in Mono sound and no wide screen.
1820;My Son was telling me that he liked this movie, and wasn't able to find it.
1821;He was very happy with it.
1822;This movie tends to inspire a lot of deep philosophizing, since the director, Stanley Kubrick, is considered the second best American director and the subject, Vietnam, is one of angst and introspection.
1823;There are a lot of deep things you can take from this.
1824;overall however this was an entertaining movie with plenty of drama and action.
1825;I have to give it credit for originality, however.
1826;I remember back in my Senior year of high school (only two years back), I've read and heard about how great this movie is.
1827;One of my friends in particular loved this movie.
1828;So, naturally, I figured it'd be high time to finally view the movie for myself.
1829;I caught it on tv one night and Leonard Maltin came on and praised the movie for all it's worth.
1830;aside from these minor qualms, the action is still brilliant.
1831;He faced quite a conflict, but he managed to pull through.
1832;And R. Lee Ermey steals the movie even from its main character (Joker).
1833;It is a great movie to watch late at night.
1834;"So you thought you have seen the best War movies with ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Black Hawk Down"", ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Three Kings"" and ""Courage Under Fire"" and the others ?"
1835;This is a realistic depiction.
1836;From the opening scene itself you see the actors and their fate in their eyes.
1837;"The first 40 minutes is sheer brilliant delight
1838;this is for fighting this is for fun"""" sang the boys holding their rifle and crotch in each hand during their training run."""
1839;the last half belongs to James Joker and Animal Mother (actor Adam Baldwin).
1840;The last 40 minutes is equally as engaging and spellbinding as the first.You would think that this accuracy would mean it was shot on location in some South East Asian country.
1841;"Modine is brilliant explaining why he wears a peace button on his uniform while his helmet has ""Born to Kill"" written on it. """
1842;The quintessential Marine Corps movie!
1843;Kubrick created a masterpiece for those who want to ride along with a group of marines from boot camp thru Vietnam.
1844;Matthew Modine is an excellent cast as a young, idealistic, joking, pseudo.
1845;Kubrick is able to show the brotherhood that exist among marines and show the senselessness of what we were fighting for, yet display the loyalty and devotion to duty that makes the Corps the best fighting force ever!
1846;As a former US Marine, this is as close as it gets to the real Corps!
1847;This is the story of how one Marine finds courage and freedom in the middle of chaos.
1848;Not a John Wayne kind of military movie, but rather is a story of how a thoughtful, sensitive guy in the Marines is able to mature in the midst of the irrational, the grotesque and the seemingly immoral world in which he has placed himself.
1849;This is all about how this Marine copes and eventually triumphs.
1850;Love this movie would give it 10 stars a lot of action and has some funny parts as well !
1851;Full Metal Jacket is the most realistic and accurate depiction of military life ever released as a major motion picture.
1852;barred look at warfare and the toll it takes on the men who carry it out.
1853;The outstanding performance of R. Lee Ermey, playing Gunnery Sgt. Hartman, gives insight into the hell young recruits and draftees must go through to graduate boot camp.
1854;Young men barely out of high school, and full of youthful humor and ambition, are steadily molded into well.
1855;disciplined killing machines and the world's greatest fighters.
1856;struggles with the strict regiment and Marine life in general, until his fellow recruits force him back in line.
1857;The acting and directing in this film is both high.
1858;The sheer impact of Full Metal Jacket is gut.
1859;wrenching and overwhelming.You should definitely check this film out.
1860;I read the main reviewer's assesment of this film, and I couldn'tdisagree more.
1861;This film was not difficult to follow, it had anexcellent cast, highly quotable, and very entertaining.
1862;MatthewModine is excellent, as well as an overweight Vincent D'nofrio,of 'The Cell' fame.
1863;The Drill Sergeant was brilliant and Iapologize, but his name escapes me.
1864;This is a must see movie that's essentially broken in 2 parts.
1865;One of the marine trainees snaps, and it's just a great scene.
1866;This is right up there with Apocalypse Now.
1867;Full metal jacket was the best Marine film and They were soldiers was the best Army Movie distributed not forgetting Hamburger Hill.
1868;Gysgt Hartman is a great actor, and knows his part, I guess after all, he was a actuall Marine Drill Instructor!!!
1869;It is a great classic movie.
1870;One of the greatest movies of all time matched with one of the greatest playback formats available.
1871;Kubrick's one of the few film directors that has managed to incorporate elements of both satire and irony seamlessly into his work.
1872;While FMJ isn't Kubrick's best film, it has moments as brilliant as his best.
1873;Very few extras, but a very good film with a number of powerful moments.
1874;This movie is one of the greatest movies ever made.
1875;The first part is my favorite, and Drill Instructer Hartman is super funny.
1876;All in all this movie is worth owning because you will want to watch it again and again.
1877;One private, Leonard Lawrence, is harrased by Hartman before he decides to take matters into his own hands.
1878;The end of the film may surprise you.
1879;all in all, both parts of this film are excellent.
1880;And the film is amazing, entertaining and halirous.
1881;The first half of the movie, set in marine basic training on Parris Island, is so riveting and powerful that it could have been a movie on its own .
1882;psycho Pvt. Leonard Pyle are by far the two strongest characters in the movie.
1883;The first half of the movie was great and I'd rate it the full 5.
1884;as one who actually went through Marine Corps boot camp in 1966, I found the performance of R. Lee Ermey real enough to set the hair up on the back of my neck.
1885;Full Metal Jacket is an outstanding portait of soldiers before and during the VietNam War.
1886;The first half of the film is so great that it seems to overshadow the rest of the film.
1887;But I feel the second half is just as compelling.
1888;Kubrick's direction reflects early films such as Paths of Glory and 2001: A Space Odyssey.
1889;Like all of Kubrick's films, there are images that you will see that seem to linger in your mind long after the film is over.
1890;While Full Metal Jacket was a good escapist movie it was a over the top portrayal of the Marine Corps in the mid.1960s.
1891;Real intense drama when a sniper is hidden and taking out soldiers one by one.
1892;The sniper is a surprise too.
1893;Good prices on AMAZON too.
1894;Most people indicate that the first half is the true movie and the 2nd part falters.
1895;I own this movie now and watch it over again without tiring.
1896;excellent acting by thedrill sargeant and mathew modine, vincent donofrio
1897;If you like war movies with good boot camp scenes, this is it.
1898;Lee Ermey portrays the tuff drill sgt. Hartman, he plays the part so well, you'll be ready to enlist as soon as the movie is over.
1899;Also Dorian Harewood keeps it real!
1900;If so, then this film will give you a good impression of the miseries a recruit faces.
