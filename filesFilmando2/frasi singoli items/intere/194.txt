I:581;1;Otherwise, this movie deserves NO stars, and I reccomend it to NOBODY.
I:581;2;"In a world of true justice and jurisdiction, this film would be put in the back room of every Blobkbuster so nobody would have to even look at the cover when they passed the ""A"" section."
I:581;3;This movie takes the cake.
I:581;4;This film has it all: inventive cinematography, glamour, thrilling action scenes, and a heartbreaking story.
I:581;5;the focus is on two aspects that greatly affected the brilliant Howard Hughes' life: his love of airplanes, and his struggles with the (then.
I:581;6;Ditto for those amazing airplane scenes.
I:581;7;cate Blanchett did a wonderful job channelling Kate Hepburn.
I:581;8;"But it is DiCaprio who stuns in the role that won him the Golden Globe for Best Actor
I:581;9;add to this a great period music score and the deft, imaginative direction of the brilliant Martin Scorsese, and you have a picture that deserved every award it won, and more!
I:581;10;This film is another masterpiece by Scorsese .
I:581;11;the film does a wonderful job of bringing us back to the times.
I:581;12;whose character is quite sinister and intense .
I:581;13;everything lends to a complex, interesting, and entertaining story.
I:581;14;But his performance in this movie is undeniably powerful.
I:581;15;"draining and quite sad to watch DiCaprio, who ""becomes"" Hughes in this picture
I:581;16;a genius in every right .
I:581;17;What a life Hughes led.
I:581;18;but still, I have to admire Scorsese for not compromising on his vision (he was urged to cut the film down, but refused).
I:581;19;in short, a damn good picture, well worthy of the 11 Oscar nominations it received.
I:581;20;[Was it a great success?]
I:581;21;Hughes builds an airplane for speed, and test flies it for a new record of 352 MPH.
I:581;22;Hughes wonders if he can be losing him mind.
I:581;23;The new Lockheed Constellation can fly cross.
I:581;24;[This is how its done.]
I:581;25;But Hughes survives the crash.
I:581;26;Hughes meets Brewster to talk over business.
I:581;27;Hughes explains how business works.
I:581;28;Hughes questions Senator Brewster about his actions.
I:581;29;Hughes will develop jet airplanes next.
I:581;30;The scenes in the last hour provide redeeming social values to this film, although some of the scenes run on too long.
I:581;31;The movie does present a feeling for events of long ago.
I:581;32;What I received from Aviator was my imagination at full throttle.
I:581;33;"What an incredible honor to be a part of the ""revival"" movement of the classics going on now."
I:581;34;It is an intimate portrait of Howard Hughes and his ever growing madness.
I:581;35;It is so easy to think so.
I:581;36;well not so much now, thanks to the hungry media.
I:581;37;Best of the year in my opinion.
I:581;38;"Most people fall back on ""Whats eating Gilbert Grape"" as his best performance."
I:581;39;Well, yes, that was great, but not the best.
I:581;40;The day someone gives a better performance, atleast personality wise, I will be a shocked individual.
I:581;41;She was very candid in speaking her mind and letting people know what she thought.
I:581;42;aviator is a great movie, tragic and epic.
I:581;43;One day this film will be recognized, maybe the same way as Raging Bull, Wizard of Oz, or It's a Wonderful Life, as a great film that will grow over time.
I:581;44;The Aviator starring Leonardo DiCaprio is an exciting film about the life and loves of Howard Hughes, the film also focuses on his plane crash, his obsession with cleanliness, and his financial struggles.
I:581;45;DiCaprio should've won the oscar for lead actor instead of that over.
I:581;46;This could easily be Leo's best performance to date.
I:581;47;And don't forget about the luminous Cate Blanchett, she won the best supporting oscar for her dead.
I:581;48;on portrayal of screen legend, Katherine Hepburn.
I:581;49;Kate Beckinsale also does a fine job doing her best Eva Gardner.
I:581;50;This is a great biopic nonetheless so save yourself a weekend and watch this film!
I:581;51;"DiCaprio is never convincing as Hughes""""I now see why ""Million Dollar Baby"" won Best Picture., ."
I:581;52;Movies like this are the reason intelligent Americans emigrate abroad.
I:581;53;This film is pure American onanistic navel gazing.
I:581;54;"The glitz and glamour circa 1920's.40's is very well represented
I:581;55;I found this film, as a whole, weird.
I:581;56;"hour movie about the wart on Franklin Delano Roosevelt's face to be fascinating, then ""The Aviator,"" is definitely the movie for you."
I:581;57;"Who knows, maybe Martin and Leonardo will team up to film an FDR wart epic."""
I:581;58;Film after film he displays his love for cinema.
I:581;59;The Aviator is a grand, ambitious, broad masterpiece that in lesser hands migt have failed miserably.
I:581;60;The film looks at hugh chunks of aviator/producer/director/ and oh did I mention billionaire Howard Hughes' life and does so with a virtuoso brilliance full of style and engery.
I:581;61;The Aviator in its first half, sets it self up as an old.
I:581;62;fashion Hollywood tale of success and fame.
I:581;63;And this is what impressed me most.
I:581;64;I love these type of movies.
I:581;65;I admire the nostalgic feeling you get as you watch it and the acute sense of attention paid to the smallest detail.
I:581;66;Mix that all up with Scorsese and you've got something there.
I:581;67;"the movie open with Hughes (DiCaprio) making ""Hell's Angles""."
I:581;68;Scorsese has made better films, all I can say to those people is, stop complaining.
I:581;69;The film is full of passion, wonderful performances (as much as I hate to admit it DiCaprio is effective), and style and engery.
I:581;70;Scorsese managed to create a Hollywood of old.
I:581;71;At times a wonderful look back at what Hollywood was, and an interesting look at an equally interesting man.
I:581;72;The best things about the movie were the sets and costumes.
I:581;73;Most of the actors did a good job.
I:581;74;Although a little too long for some, the film plays an excellent portrayal of Hughes' life and career.
I:581;75;DiCaprio's performance is nothing short of stellar, a very talented actor.
I:581;76;If you love Leo and find the life and accomplishments of Howard Hughes interesting, you'll get some mild entertainment out of this film.
I:581;77;DiCaprio held it all together walking through a surreal world where only rich kids and movie stars get to live the American dream of success.
I:581;78;After she makes her stage left exit the film vastly improves, still not much positive reaction from the audience.
I:581;79;This slant would have played much better and held our interest more.
I:581;80;Here we cheer for Hughes as the uderdog.
I:581;81;the sets are pure Scorsese, the script could have used a good polish and better character development for a few of the key players could have made this a great film.
I:581;82;What the heck, DiCaprio's still young, right?
I:581;83;This is an outstanding, expansive, detailed portrait of the enigmatic and eccentric billionaire playboy and aviation enthusiast/Hollywood producer (Hell's Angels) Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the years (the 1920s through the 1940s) leading up to his bouts of insanity and decline from the spotlight.
I:581;84;It's ambitious and never disappoints.
I:581;85;It is bound to become a classic.
I:581;86;The Aviator is a riveting film with a thoughtful, provocative script that delves into the many aspects of Hughes personality: the explorer (he bought TWA and flew planes and constantly planned on building bigger and better airplanes), the playboy (he dated and love Katharine Hepburn (a commendable performance by Cate Blanchett who embodies all Hepburn's traits and her accent) and Ava Gardiner (Beckinsale) and squired many other starlets around town), the germ.
I:581;87;o. phobe (he constantly washed his hands and became obsessed with touching and cleanliness), the consummate businessman (he fought Congress and Pan Am for the right for TWA to fly abroad) and the perfectionist who analyzed everything he did.
I:581;88;DiCaprio is amazing as always as he sheds light on this strange, wonderful and wealthy man.
I:581;89;He brings so many layers to the character.
I:581;90;While they have some reason to feel that way personally I feel that the film is so well put together that it more than makes the running time worth while.
I:581;91;Leonardo DiCaprio is at his best here and delivers an award worthy performance as the legend Howard Hughes.
I:581;92;Martin Scorsese delivers as well, directing powerhouse performances with great effects and amazing storytelling capacity.
I:581;93;the film gracefully covers most of Hughes adult life, exposing his love life and his business escapades not to mention his quarks and obsessions.
I:581;94;Along the way we are introduced to some of Hollywood's most elite, from Katherine Hepburn, played magnificently by Oscar winner Cate Blanchett, to Jean Harlow and Ava Gardner.
I:581;95;His relationships with these women is dissected, mostly when it comes to Hepburn, and the chemistry between both DiCaprio and Blanchett is so effortless that it makes the whole experience comfortable and believable to the viewer.
I:581;96;I've always known that there was a great actor underneath those pretty boy looks and thankfully Leonardo took advantage of that when he took this role on full speed ahead.
I:581;97;The way that he delves deep into the madness that overtook Hughes was pure genius, and the way he was able to keep his head, making it believable as apposed to over the top, his commendable and noteworthy.
I:581;98;the supporting cast including John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Gwen Stefani, Kate Beckinsale and Jude Law is very impressive, and everyone is on key, but none so much as Alan Alda who plays Senator Brewster, the enemy as you could label him.
I:581;99;The court hearings towards the end of this film where Brewster and Hughes square off are exciting and real and they really show the brilliance of these two actors.
I:581;100;Watching them debate back and forth is so effortless it transcends acting.
I:581;101;It's actually, don't take this wrong, beautiful to watch.
I:581;102;scorsese really outdoes himself here, combining a great true life story with a powerful script that does it's best to flesh out a man who had a lot to uncover, not to mention the fantastic acting and fluid chemistry, making `The Aviator' one of the must see movies of the given year.
I:581;103;Sure, it's not perfect, but it's one of the best films of the year and surely one of the best showcases for pure acting genius.
I:581;104;Scorsese and company is truly to be commended for delivering one great work of art.
I:581;105;Definitely one of Leonardo Dicaprio's best movies.
I:581;106;Leonardio Decaprio was fabulous in this role.
I:581;107;THE AVIATOR is a superior biopic directed by Martin Scorcese.
I:581;108;It garnered 11 Academy Award nominations, winning for Best Supporting Actress (Cate Blanchett), also Art Direction, Cinematography, Costumes and Film Editing.
I:581;109;Beckinsale is a stunning Ava Gardner, Law can't carry off an Errol Flynn impression.
I:581;110;"The ""Hell's Angels"" flying sequences are absolutely spectacular."
I:581;111;marvelous recreations of old Hollywood, fine unobtrusive CGI special effects and a top.
I:581;112;rate cast make this the sort of movie that's worth repeated viewings.
I:581;113;I have to say that this is a work of art for movies.
I:581;114;The production values are definitely some of the best I have seen recently, but the movie did miss something.
I:581;115;Scorsese does well with actors, but again I think what he had to work with prevented it from becoming as good as some of his previous work.
I:581;116;A great director needs a great screenplay to bring out top.
I:581;117;I think this is one of the year's best pictures, but it wasn't as emotionally satisfying to me as Finding Neverland or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
I:581;118;Despite being disappointed, I still recommend it.
I:581;119;The Aviator carries more similarities with earlier Martin Scorsese's masterpiece .
I:581;120;But the most striking similarity between the two films lies in the way Scorsese masterfully injected them with understated compassion with the characters .
I:581;121;Interestingly, even the names of the two Scorsese's favorite actors are similarly Italian.
I:581;122;so irresistibly watchable this is.
I:581;123;Also due to the stellar cast headed by di Caprio.
I:581;124;Martin Scorsese's stylish take on Howard Hughes' early life, is a stunningly visual treat in art direction made even more compelling by Scorsese's sure handed directorial flourishes.
I:581;125;Scorsese is, by now, a master of the medium, always finding the interesting shot, the fitting camera angle, the flowing tracking shot, the camera movement that breathes energy into his story.
I:581;126;It is beautifully filmed and acted, most especially by Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes.
I:581;127;it is a long movie, and it will be interesting to see whether a modern audience, many doubtless unfamiliar with the Hughes legend, will find it as intriguing as we who remember the Hughes of Las Vegas etc.
I:581;128;Take the clue from the title, this is a film about the young Hughes who was a genius and a creative dynamo, and an almost overlooked pioneer of aviation.
I:581;129;This was a young man full of ambition, dreams, energy and contradictions.
I:581;130;The film not only presages the pitiable creature Hughes will become, a slave to his obsessive compulsive illness, but it does so with sympathy and sensitivity.
I:581;131;a first rate biopic done with flair and style.
I:581;132;Another worthwhile look at an American life.
I:581;133;The Aviator was an interesting and engaging movie .
I:581;134;Leonardo De Caprio was indeed a talented actor and not just a pretty face.
I:581;135;h was quite realistic and remarkable.
I:581;136;The costumes and the setting were excellent.
I:581;137;Cate Blanchette played an excellent portrayal of Katherine Hepburn.
I:581;138;(now,if you want a great time at the movies,and a great movie overall,see 'sin city.')
I:581;139;The music, the history, the scenery, the clothes, the long shots into the Lounge, one of the best, most realistic, harrowing airplane crashes ever shot.
I:581;140;I haven't even touched on DiCaprio's acting chops .
I:581;141;divine, in my opinion probably his best work.
I:581;142;Beckinsale and Blanchett, particularly the latter are also wonderful.
I:581;143;I held my breath through a good portion of the movie.
I:581;144;"The story of Howard Hughes is complex and nerve wracking
I:581;145;ho business man with creative dreams that he has the money to pursue.
I:581;146;It is mesmerizing to watch it all unravel in such a personal and intimate way.
I:581;147;It is a wonderful, beautiful movie that I have and will watch many times.
I:581;148;A top 5, I'd say in my all.
I:581;149;time favorite movies in the world.
I:581;150;I personally think the movie should have won best picture of the year.
I:581;151;Leonardo, much to my surprise, depicted the real Howard Hughes beautifully.
I:581;152;Cate Blanchard, who played Kathryn Hepburn, was amazingly believable, as was the person who played Ava Gardner.
I:581;153;The special effects, especially when he crashed the plane were very dramatic and realistic.
I:581;154;I am an aviation buff, and love movies about flying.
I:581;155;Aviator had enough aviation to be satisfying, and an amazing inside look at the mind of this incredible man.
I:581;156;I could watch it two or three more times and still see something new.
I:581;157;I love old Hollywood, and I wholeheartedly embrace films that come along tackling that golden time.
I:581;158;It just makes it better that this film is about one of the most interesting Americans of the last several decades, made by one of the best, and frustratingly Oscar.
I:581;159;Leonardo DiCaprio, in a deservingly Oscar nominated role, brings to life the enigma that is Houston oil tycoon, Howard Hughes.
I:581;160;Tycoon, Film producer, Aviation pioneer, legendary Hollywood playboy, Hughes lived many lives in his one.
I:581;161;DiCaprio was fantastic in the role.
I:581;162;While her accent came and went a little here and there, she was nevertheless incredible.
I:581;163;Alda was equally fantastic as the slimey Senator Brewster.
I:581;164;Alda has the reputation of being the cleanest, nicest guy, and that is what made the casting all the more brilliant.
I:581;165;He is a really nice guy, but he's also a really good actor, and he is fantastic.
I:581;166;The score is beautiful, and the recreations of the times the timespan covers is impecable.
I:581;167;Scorsese is one of the greatest directors, and he has delivered a Hollywood masterpiece that deserved the attention it got.
I:581;168;inspiring story about a larger.
I:581;169;Well, it's a Howard Hughes story!
I:581;170;DiCaprio is one of the most talented actors as far as I'm concerned.
I:581;171;Blanchett and Beckinsale, and Stefani all deliver as aspected.
I:581;172;good script and good camera work.
I:581;173;another nitpick, I know that the goal of the movie is to make you like Howard Hughes.
I:581;174;to make it more convincing.
I:581;175;Howard Hughes is a charming man with great great great accomplishments but my impression of him is that he has many many many flaws too [not just his mental illness].
I:581;176;In this movie, they put emphasis on his mental state and his single.
I:581;177;They imply that everything else about Hughes is great.
I:581;178;show more of his dark side but in the end still manage to make people admire who Hughes is/was.
I:581;179;Martin Scorsese's biopic of Howard Hughes, featuring the pilot.
I:581;180;tycoon in his golden years while only hinting at his eventual decline into complete madness, is a well.
I:581;181;looking and entertaining film, and it features a career.
I:581;182;Cate Blanchett's take on Katharine Hepburn is startlingly good, as well.
I:581;183;It's an ambitious epic of a movie, and it succeeds.
I:581;184;I'm not surprised that Cate Blanchett won an Oscar for her supporting role, playing Katherine Hepburn, but I'm shocked that Leonardo DiCaprio did not win for his brilliant portrayal of Howard Hughes.
I:581;185;"It was awesome seeing the genius of Director Martin Scorsese ""pulling"" the best from his actors and from each scene."
I:581;186;Everyone pulled together to create a phenomenal movie that deservedly won five Oscars.
I:581;187;Very sad in places, but uplifting in others.
I:581;188;"i admire what Scorsese said about Hughes
I:581;189;That is so sad, but so true, as this film adequately depicts.
I:581;190;Over the years, I've developed the impression of Howard Hughes as a crazy man, who, in his younger years, accomplished an incredible amount of things.
I:581;191;martin Scorcese's THE AVIATOR is a great movie that totally changed my impression about Howard Hughes.
I:581;192;Hughes was an amazing man, a tragic figure who succeeded in spite of the mental disorder he surely had and it is a shame it was never treated properly.
I:581;193;the film covers Hughes' life from childhood until 1947.
I:581;194;At over two and half hours, the movie manages to squeeze in all of the important events.
I:581;195;We see his obsession over making the movie HELL'S ANGELS, and the power he holds over young Hollywood starlets.
I:581;196;We see the beginning of the end with his personality and paranoia beginning to take form.
I:581;197;this movie is ultimately about triumph, as Hughes is able to overcome his self imposed isolation to testify in congress in front of hundreds of people and to come out on top.
I:581;198;The movie is beautiful and there's never a dull moment.
I:581;199;the cast is, of course, great.
I:581;200;It made me want to learn more about Hughes and his incredible will to succeed in spite of the constant inner demons he lived with.
I:581;201;Perhaps the placement of a story during Hollywood's golden era helped.
I:581;202;notch, intelligent actor and not a sneering boy, Martin Scorsese just being an honest tradesman.
I:581;203;Bravo!See it on as big a screen as possible.
I:581;204;You will meet, best as he can be recreated for you, a complex and driven creator named Howard Hughes who attempted to do more with his life than simply rest on the $$$ he was born with.
I:581;205;Warts and all but funny too.
I:581;206;the recreation of Ava Garner was particularly smashing and unexpected.
I:581;207;I can count on one hand films that were actually an advanced learning experience, and I have seen dumpsters full of them in 55 years.
I:581;208;I really really really really (emphasis on the really) wanted to like this movie!
I:581;209;the best scenes of this movie by far are the ones in which Cate Blanchett (playing Katharine Hepburn) appears and the phenomenal crash towards the end of the movie.
I:581;210;"i have no problem complimenting the film on its visual aspects
I:581;211;Bottom line: Great actors such as DeNiro are so far between these days, you could count them on one hand.
I:581;212;Only then, will you be able to truthfully distinguish Scorsese's best with this piece of Hollywood rubbish.
I:581;213;This movie is bound to be a timeless classic.
I:581;214;The directing and acting were superb.
I:581;215;The story probably reflects the most interesting time of Howard Hughes life and Leonardo DiCaprio did a great job portraying Mr Hughes.
I:581;216;In fact I feel it is his best performance so far.
I:581;217;hughes is one of the most interesting characters of the 20th century and in this movie you will find out why.
I:581;218;He was an amazing man who made decisions quickly and decisively.
I:581;219;One of my favorite lines from the movie is when Howard tells his engineer to stop thinking like an insect!I own this one and have watched it numerous times sometimes by just fast forwarding it to my favoite parts.
I:581;220;I was truly inspired by it and especially at the end when you see him as a young boy saying he was going to make the biggest movies and fly the fastest planes and become the richest man in the world.
I:581;221;It just goes to show how a boy with some dreams can become a man with great realities.
I:581;222;"There is still something inspirational about the story of Hughes, as presented in this picture
I:581;223;I watched this movie because I saw how many awards it won from the Academy and the Golden Globes.
I:581;224;Some of my favorite movies are the historical epics such as the Lord of the Rings, Braveheart, etc.
I:581;225;The best part of the movie was the acting.
I:581;226;DiCaprio did a fine job, and I think they picked the right people for Katherine Hepburn (Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Beckinsale, who isn't hard on the eyes, might I add).
I:581;227;leonardo DiCaprio is a FANTASTIC actor.You really believe your watching Howard Hughes.
I:581;228;And indeed, he is an important historical figure.
I:581;229;Leo is an outstanding actor, and so are the others.
I:581;230;His portrayal of Hughes is just fine, and I doubt that anyone could have done any better.
I:581;231;after viewing any film, one has to ask themselves.
I:581;232;Some people are more than content seeing a movie only once, and then moving on to the next film.
I:581;233;what I find to make the difference between good and great movies, are the ones that leave the audience wanting more: whether in the form of a sequel or in the form of a repeat viewing.
I:581;234;Her performance of Katherine Hepburn was short and exhilarating .
I:581;235;"The crash scene in ""The Aviator"" does stands out as a very livid and intense sequence though."
I:581;236;It's a very well done segment.
I:581;237;"By the time the end rolls around, ""The Aviator"" can only be summed up as just an ""O. k."" movie."
I:581;238;One of the best actors, as well as best directors, a must.
I:581;239;I don't like to give away what the movie is about, but this movie is a classic.
I:581;240;life degeneration overshadows his brilliant and pioneering efforts in aviation and cinema in his youth and middle age.
I:581;241;The Aviator focuses on Hughes' accomplishments, and sympathetically handles his obsessive.
I:581;242;DeCaprio does an excellent job of portraying Hughes, re.
I:581;243;confirming the fact that he can really act.
I:581;244;The story is interesting and seems to conform to the facts pretty well, unusual in a Hollywood biopic.
I:581;245;And Alan Alda once again shows that he is one of Hollywood's great older actors, putting in a great understated performance as Hughes' nemesis Senator Brownback.
I:581;246;Blanchett is often great, but definitely not here.
I:581;247;the performances were all excellent.
I:581;248;Leonardo Dicaprio gave a so far career best performance.
I:581;249;When he is in the car covering his mouth as he said the same thing over and over, It was very impressive.
I:581;250;blanchett gives the Hepburn in the movie life, energy, humor, depth, one of the best performances of 04.
I:581;251;When she tears down the tape in the house, she serves the movie the way Blanchett does, though without as much depth, but still is excellent.
I:581;252;He is a good villain, but also one who is thinking about playing the Washington game.
I:581;253;The whole chairman scene with Baldwin was a good entry for his character.
I:581;254;the Aviator is one of the best movies of 04, even if it drags with the hearings, it provides for the set up for one of the more triumphant scenes with the flying of the Spruce Goose.
I:581;255;Nominated for 6 Golden Globes and 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, The Aviator wows audiences with its breadth of scenery and vivid realism.
I:581;256;by no doubt turns out his best work since Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) sought to become a made man.
I:581;257;The Aviator springs to life with nostalgic settings and a lavish tapestry of color and form, evoking all the enthusiasm indicative of Howard Hughes' unique lust for life.
I:581;258;John Logan, known for such films as The Last Samurai (2003) and Gladiator (2000), presents a screenplay that provides some insight into the enigmatic Hughes and captures the mannerisms of those who shared that life with him.
I:581;259;In short, the film is a masterpiece of visual imagery and first.
I:581;260;rate cinematography few movie lovers can afford to miss.
I:581;261;And along the way, he captured the imagination of those around him with an attitude that embraced risk and life itself.
I:581;262;Inheriting a majority interest in the Hughes Tool Company (founded by his father), Hughes embarks on a career in Hollywood where he produces a number of notable films including Hell's Angels, The Front Page, and Scarface.
I:581;263;But along the way, he deals with a cast of characters colorful in their own right.
I:581;264;hand man, sacrifices much in his own life to enable Hughes to live out his latest visions and inspirations.
I:581;265;When Hughes makes the bold move of constructing the Spruce Goose .
I:581;266;Hughes takes on the Senator full.
I:581;267;force and with all the zest that marked his previous ventures.
I:581;268;And the film is certainly deserving of that high honor.
I:581;269;Few films better illustrate the beauty of America, or more importantly, the mountains that can be moved when a single individual lives his life with ambition, drive, inspiration, and a naked enthusiasm for all that life has to offer.
I:581;270;Overall, The Aviator is among the best films of the past several years, and movie aficionados would be well.
I:581;271;advised to watch every last minute with same enthusiasm of a young Howard Hughes.
I:581;272;Howard Hughes was an eccentric businessman and adventure seeker who was always striving to create things and achieve things that were larger than life.
I:581;273;"This movie, ""The Aviator"" brings his life to the big screen and it's a movie that scores many hits for its cinematography and for the performances by its fine cast."
I:581;274;director Martin Scorsese is the man behind the camera in this film and, like with most of Scorsese's films, this movie can be counted on for plenty of symbolism, foreshadowing, etc. as the frames advance.
I:581;275;Hughes love of flying is first in importance in this movie, but there are other components of his personality that are highlighted as well.
I:581;276;"This came from his childhood and Scorsese makes this point obvious when he starts out the film
I:581;277;This phobia to germs haunts Hughes throughout his life and the disorder (and the way Hughes handles it) is one of the main focal points of this film.
I:581;278;Cate Blanchett is very good as Kathyrn Hepburn.
I:581;279;Kate Beckinsale is also very good as the sultry and confident Eva Gardner.
I:581;280;smart and serious as opposed to the boyish appearance he has for most of the film.
I:581;281;the Aviator walked away with five Oscars and it ranks as one of 2004's better films.
I:581;282;the honor went to Million Dollar Baby), but it is still a very good film to watch.
I:581;283;But what you get to discover about Hughes is portrayed with a good degree (although not 100 percent) of accuracy, making it an educational and entertaining motion picture.
I:581;284;"Martin Scorsese's grand, 2004 epic ""The Aviator"" is a beautifully."
I:581;285;detailed account of billionaire playboy Howard Hughes' earlier life, specifically, the era of his greatest triumphs (circa 1922 .
I:581;286;shouldered suits popular at the time for men.
I:581;287;Also quite convincing are the recreated scenes of a 1920s.1940s era Hollywood and California in general.
I:581;288;While each of the recognizable stars plays his or her role more or less with acceptable skill, seeing so many modern celebrities portraying celebrities who are long.
I:581;289;"dead consistently reminds the viewer that this is a film and ""wrecks the magic."""
I:581;290;Hughes' torrid relationship with Katherine Hepburn.
I:581;291;Hughes' determination to make movies outside of the highly exclusive Hollywood studio system.
I:581;292;Hughes' genius as a progressive engineer in aerdynamics and aircraft design.
I:581;293;Hughes' marriage to his childhood sweetheart that lasted from 1925.1929.
I:581;294;The Aviator may not be the complete story of Howard Hughes, but it succeeds in making the average viewer want to know more about this fascinating aviation pioneer's life.
I:581;295;"the first part of the film is actually my favorite, in part because Hughes is young and relatively free from the mental illness that plagues him later in the film, and also in part because it is just plain fun watching young Howard spend three years making ""Hell's Angels""."
I:581;296;i. want swagger down just right, mixed with the perfect amount of flirtatious charm and lost boy vulnerability.
I:581;297;Hughes' hubris is balanced by his right.
I:581;298;This part of the movie has some of its most stylish sets and is the most visually appealing part of the film, in my opinion.
I:581;299;the second part of the film, which focuses on Hughes' relationship with Katherine Hepburn, is good mainly because Cate Blanchett really steals the show as Hepburn.
I:581;300;My favorite part of this section of the film is when the new.
I:581;301;"Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother."
I:581;302;This part of the film starts with Hughes' near.
I:581;303;"overall ""The Aviator"" is a visually stunning film with great performances by both DiCaprio and Blanchett."
I:581;304;I was really pleasantly surprised by DiCaprio's performance, though.
I:581;305;I saw this film in theatrical release and definitely agree with most of the reviewers on here who thought it was beautifully shot.
I:581;306;"I enjoyed all of the flight sequences, and the ""life."
I:581;307;Dicaprio and Blanchett both gave great performances (Blanchett definitely deserves her Academy Award), and I was very pleasantly surprised to see John C. Reilly show up in the cast as he was never credited in any of the trailers I had seen.
I:581;308;however, the court case and the ending scene were both very satisfying, and I left the theater with a smile.
I:581;309;A very aggressive, true story of the rise and fall of a famous billionaire aviator, movie producer, playboy, and businessman.
I:581;310;Howard Hughes had a dream, and fought throughout his lifetime to fulfill his dream, after continuously being discouraged by society.
I:581;311;his childhood dream was to fly the fastest planes ever built, make the biggest movies ever, and to be the richest man in the world.
I:581;312;phobia, for which we found interesting.
I:581;313;the movie is not filled with very much action and excitement, as it is more on the conservative side, therefore may not be of interests to all viewers, but is however very interesting from beginning to end.
I:581;314;interesting film in aspect of the early development of North American single.
I:581;315;the movie does run 170 minutes, and keeps your interest throughout.
I:581;316;we enjoyed the movie, and rate it a 6/10.
I:581;317;We hope you enjoy it!!!
I:581;318;One of Scorsese's biggest and best!
I:581;319;The Aviator is an amazing ride and a haunting journey into the mind of a deeply disturbed genius.
I:581;320;the cinematography and flight sequences alone are worth the price of admission, epically the scene when he crashes his new spy plane into Beverly Hills.
I:581;321;But special effects aside, the historical and educational value of the film is also worth the 170 minutes.
I:581;322;never the less, The Aviator is a powerful experience and an epic worth watching.
I:581;323;I watch many movies over and over.
I:581;324;A one time view is all this will receive from me.
I:581;325;I can't really understand why the Hollywood academy found this to be a good film other than much of the film is about film.
I:581;326;making, and thus of special interest to them.
I:581;327;It is Leonard DiCaprio who offers the weakest performance in the film.
I:581;328;As the character of Howard Hughes ages in the film, DiCaprio remains adolescent in looks and manner.
I:581;329;It is Cate Blanchett's performance as Katherine Hepburn that saves the film.
I:581;330;The scene where she takes Howard home to her eccentric New England family is superb and even DiCaprio performs well in this scene.
I:581;331;This movie projects an illusion of class.
I:581;332;Jonathan Demme's overlooked gem, Melvin and Howard, managed to say a whole lot more about Howard Hughes in five minutes than this overstuffed turkey manages in numerous hours.
I:581;333;This portrayal of Howard Hughes as a rich, paranoid fruitcake obsessed with his belief that he was correct (perfect?)
I:581;334;The movie was a well done and interesting history of Howard Hughes.
I:581;335;Never have I seen such a stunning and extravagant use of color in a film.
I:581;336;This is a glamorous movie that has been elegantly shot and superbly cast.
I:581;337;cate Blanchett was very good.
I:581;338;nice looking film falling short on drama.
I:581;339;"This is the first film feature version that I have found the ""Features"" disk to be worthwhile."
I:581;340;Every aspect of the special features (found listed elsewhere) were extremely interesting, accurate as to aviation aspects and even the discussion of medical aspects (maybe more so to other physicians).
I:581;341;Every aspect such as the set designs, costumes and special effects to enhance the visual impressions held my interest.
I:581;342;Documentaries from other media added greatly to the completeness of the Howard Hughes bibliography.
I:581;343;I found it a completely captivating feature film in its own right.
I:581;344;It is a remarkable story of a driven man, whose self.
I:581;345;destructive demons were nonetheless the source of much of his achievement.
I:581;346;As the movie concludes, Hughes himself seems to accept that these warring aspects of his personality are interwoven to the point that he cannot have one without the other, and whatever may be in store for him in the future, it will be worth the price paid.
I:581;347;excellent moviehad seen it beforeall about Howard Hughes and aviationchfancier
I:581;348;The Avaitor is a well acted, well directed epic.
I:581;349;Even though it's 3 hours long, it's still easy to watch and captivates the audience.
I:581;350;But once again, one of the greatest film makers of all time was slated in a year in which he did do the best job directing and he did have the best film of the five nominated.
I:581;351;the movie is about Howard Hughes (DiCaprio) and his climb to be a successful movie maker, business owner and how he revolutionized the aviation industry.
I:581;352;The story is really good and in.
I:581;353;depth into Hughes' life and is a very entertaining story at that.
I:581;354;as mentioned earlier, Scorsese should have won the Best Director Oscar hands down.
I:581;355;Only two or three film makers in the world could have pulled off making this film and he did a stellar job at it.
I:581;356;He got great performances out of DiCaprio and Blanchet (who won the Best Supporting Actress award for this role).
I:581;357;This film is shot beautifully and for a film that almost clocked in at three hours long, it sure didn't feel like it.
I:581;358;It was clearly the best of the five.
I:581;359;With a great story, great acting and one of the greatest directors of all time behind the lense, this film is definately worth the three hours.
I:581;360;Hats off all around on a fantastic film that truly captures the many faces of the young enigma that was Howard Hughes.
I:581;361;Leonardo DiCaprio gave an awesome performance as the recluse Howard Hughes.
I:581;362;Ever since I got this movie, it has sparked my curiosity into researching further, Howard Hughes.
I:581;363;Great movie if you like history, awesome visiual effects, time periods and great acting.
I:581;364;The Aviator is a great biopic of offcentered aviation pioneer Howard Hughs.
I:581;365;From his compulsive behavior and ecentrities, to his falladering with women, to his imagination of what he wants to do next, this movie gives you all of this historic figure.
I:581;366;Leonardo Dicaprio gives his best performance yet, and the cast including Cate Blanchet as Kathrine Hepburn and Kate Beckensale as Eva Gardner do a fabulous job.
I:581;367;The period of the 1930's and 1940's are remarkably created.
I:581;368;This is one of the best films of 2004.
I:581;369;"Wow, the first word that come to mind when I think of this movie is ""Overrated""."
I:581;370;"There are a few good bits in the movie, like the acting, the acting was over the top top notch, especially from Cate Blanchette who won an Oscar for her great performance of Katharine Hepburn, Leonardo DiCaprio, done OK though, it wasnt really a Jamie Foxx ""Ray"" type of performance but still it was quite good."
I:581;371;It does indeed get boring, the cinematography brings it to life though, it is great.
I:581;372;overall Its boring, overrated, great acting and cinematography and the directing was good.
I:581;373;Great fictionalized account of an American personality.
I:581;374;1) I'm a huge fan of Howard Hughes, an absolute buff on the guy.
I:581;375;I've read two biographies of him and have to say he's one of the most interesting historical figures of the past century: His brilliance, his wealth, his flaws, his successes, his peculiarities and the periods in which he lived all combine to create a fascinating figure.2) I'm a tremendous fan of Martin Scorsese.
I:581;376;He's made some of my favorite movies and I think he's probably one of the top five greatest directors working today.
I:581;377;"There's just something about the way he photographs images and people that makes even his worst movies worthwhile.3) I also think Leonardo DiCaprio is a really good actor, a fact that has been publicly obscurred (but not hampered) by the ""Titanic"" hype and by some poor choices (or lack of choices, in recent years).4) And I think ""The Aviator"" was probably the best produced movie of 2004."
I:581;378;The cast is excellent, the sets and costumes and designs are fabulous, the cinematography is exquisite.
I:581;379;It's an impressive achievement but I seem to appreciate the parts more than the whole.
I:581;380;And as good as DiCaprio is, I think he may have been miscast.
I:581;381;There are long stretches of space but every so often, there's a brilliant explosion.
I:581;382;a movie about a man called Howard Hughes (Leonardo Di Caprio) who cared very much about aviation, who thought himself as a self divine power, who made is dream come true.
I:581;383;Martin Scorse is quite successfull in bringing the life of Hughes on the wide screen.
I:581;384;Leonardo DiCaprio painfully utters this line as he pulled himself out of a rather spectacular crash of one of his planes he helped developed.
I:581;385;The film centers on the middle of his life, probably his most successful and also his most troubled.
I:581;386;it's a fine line between ambitious and crazy.
I:581;387;Howard Hughes wanted a lot of things to happen and got rather upset if things didn't go his way, and he liked really complicated and wild things.
I:581;388;next he gets involved with Katherine Hepburn and heavily involved in aviation.
I:581;389;Cate Blanchett got the Oscar for her portrayal of Katherine Hepburn but Leonardo completely owns this film.
I:581;390;When he's commanding and ambitious he pulls it off but even in his off period he's still compelling.
I:581;391;Like someone's life was too fascinating for just a 3 hour film but the condensed 20 years in 3 hours we do see is very entertaining, including that unbelievable crash of his spy plane in Beverly Hills.
I:581;392;One of the best recent movies I've seen.
I:581;393;If you are a fan of Howard Hughes, or this era, this is a must have movie.
I:581;394;One of my fave movies, great story, great performances, and cinematography.
I:581;395;Leo does an interesting howard hughes and gives him life in a realistic way.
I:581;396;"Martin Scorsese once again proves to have the magical touch, especially with historic pieces in his ambitious biography of the early part of the life of Howard Hughes in ""The Aviator""."
I:581;397;due to reclusive nature of Hughes the movie is a revelation into the life of this brilliant but quirky individual.
I:581;398;Despite his shortcomings, Hughes, at a young age, stood at the cutting edge of both aviation technology and movie making.
I:581;399;He was able to parlay these talents into a vast financial empire.
I:581;400;He was romantically involved with some of the most beautiful and influential actresses in Hollywood.
I:581;401;leonardo di Caprio did a wonderful job in his portrayal of the eccentric billionaire.
I:581;402;Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn again proves to be among the most talented actresses on the silver screen today.
I:581;403;Kate Beckinsale aptly cast as the beautiful Ava Gardner produced some of her best work to date.
I:581;404;Kudos to Scorsese who as he usually does, deserves serious consideration for an Oscar.
I:581;405;I've never thought Raging Bull was Scorsese's best work.
I:581;406;but it can be argued as a great film, and it's a cut above this film whose first half has potential, albeit flawed, but whose second half reeks.
I:581;407;He has absolutely zero range, and is unwilling to let go of himself to the role.
I:581;408;Better actors, like Brad Pitt in Kalifornia or A River Runs Through It, do so.
I:581;409;Worth watching if there's nothing better available!
I:581;410;Clearly Martin Scorsese is able to bring out the best in his actors.
I:581;411;But in this film, the performances are fantastic top.
I:581;412;Leonardo does a great job personifying Howard Hughes, even though he doesn't really look like him.
I:581;413;It is at that moment that you know that Scorsese has done it again and we're in for a fun and exciting ride.
I:581;414;bits for oil rigs, and arrives in Hollywood to make a WWI epic.
I:581;415;Hughes knows the potential for aviation and sets out making prototypes for military planes, test flying them himself.
I:581;416;In the film's most spectacular sequence, his double.
I:581;417;"this is the most harrowing representation of a plane crash since ""Alive."""
I:581;418;which is admirably performed by DiCaprio.
I:581;419;In the film's two most enjoyable sequences, Alda and DiCaprio spar first over dinner at the Senator's apartment (the Senator getting the upper hand) and then again at the hearings (this time with Hughes scoring a K. o. on the corrupt senator).
I:581;420;It's ironic that the footage for Hell's Angels (the WWI pic) is animated when Hughes himself was going for realism in the film.
I:581;421;As he often does, Scorsese errs on the side of big .
I:581;422;Hughes is bigger than life, but sometimes this films seems to go a little over.
I:581;423;There are a couple documentaries (one produced by the History Channel) on the life of Hughes the Aviator.
I:581;424;There is also a discussion/interview with an expert on obsessive.
I:581;425;are good, although much of the information is repeated in the audio commentary.
I:581;426;so, telling this story is interesting.
I:581;427;I like flying and found all of that fascinating.
I:581;428;i think this film succeeds on multiple levels.
I:581;429;It tells the story of Howard Hughes as a man possessed with genius for all things technical.
I:581;430;the film, and especially DiCaprio, succeeds in bringing Hughes to life and shows us how his early quirks and eccentricities grew into a full blown and toxic madness after the plane crash that nearly took his life (although the film does not show us his use and abuse of narcotics after this time).
I:581;431;Hughes is portrayed sympathetically, but honestly and that is a very complex achievement.
I:581;432;The scenes in the Coconut Grove are just wonderful.
I:581;433;The musical portrayals of the Wainwright clan are terrific not only musically, but in the style and energy of the music in those decades.
I:581;434;He is the perennial Hollywood outsider.
I:581;435;In recent years, the veteran filmmaker seems to become aware of this slight and, like one of his contemporaries, Steven Spielberg, has tried to make more Academy friendly films with Gangs of New York and more recently, The Aviator.
I:581;436;Despite the presence of Michael Mann as producer and Leonardo DiCaprio as his leading man, the Oscar has alluded Scorsese yet again.
I:581;437;with recent strong performances in Catch Me If You Can and Gangs of New York, Leonardo DiCaprio has finally managed to distance himself from the Titanic phenomenon.
I:581;438;He captures the tycoon's intensity with a piercing stare and a tough, no compromising attitude.
I:581;439;not since New York, New York has Scorsese crafted such a lavish homage to classic Hollywood cinema.
I:581;440;scorsese paints a fascinating portrait of this complex individual, his triumphs and his flaws with a vivid brush.
I:581;441;It may seem that the director has moved away from intimate, personal movies but this is because the larger.
I:581;442;life subject is reflected in the film's grandiose style.
I:581;443;The Aviator is a finely crafted, entertaining biopic that is ambitious but wisely doesn't try to cram Hughes' entire life into one movie, instead focusing on a specific period of time.
I:581;444;DiCaprio and Scorsese present an unsentimental portrait which probably didn't endear it with the Academy but this makes for a much more interesting film.
I:581;445;Scorsese dominates the track with the occasional comments by Schoonmaker and Mann.
I:581;446;This is an engrossing, informative track that fleshes out Hughes' backstory.
I:581;447;It is an oddly poignant moment of regret that further humanizes Hughes.
I:581;448;The Role of Howard Hughes in Aviation History features Hughes biographers talking about how the man developed a love of aviation from an early age.
I:581;449;Hughes was always willing to risk his vast fortune to realize his dreams.
I:581;450;These biographers also talk about the man's numerous innovations and records that he set.
I:581;451;up to this extra is a 43.
I:581;452;This is an excellent look at his life, complete with archival footage and photos.
I:581;453;DiCaprio talks about how he got interested in Hughes' life and about the evolution of the project, from the early stages with Michael Mann to finally making the movie with Scorsese.
I:581;454;This is an entertaining, engaging extra.
I:581;455;Some insight is given into how two of the film's impressive action set pieces.
I:581;456;Legendary production designer, Dante Ferretti talks about how he indulged his love of classic Hollywood by recreating its most glamourous period for this movie.
I:581;457;Both aspects helped recreate the beautiful actresses that Hughes encountered during the early part of his career.
I:581;458;Great lengths were taken to recreate the look of the period with many old photos and films studied to get just the right look.
I:581;459;Scoring The Aviator: The Work of Howard Shore briefly examines how this veteran composer set about scoring this movie.
I:581;460;Dicaprio is wonderful as Hughes, as is Blanchett as Hepburn and the great supporting cast.
I:581;461;The flight scenes are fantastic.
I:581;462;Hughes would be very pleased.
I:581;463;The movie is beautifully edited.
I:581;464;Shame it didn't do well at box office and casting was darned good.
I:581;465;The Aviator has been called the film in which Martin Scorsese went Hollywood, and surely its large, A. list cast makes it seem that way, but at its heart The Aviator has much more in common with both the big budget epics of the old studio days, and with Scorsese's classics such as Raging Bull and the more recent Gangs of New York.
I:581;466;The Aviator is and will stand through time as an immense motion picture.
I:581;467;Everything about it, from its subject matter to its scenes of flight and airliners resting in various stages of assembly in huge hangers displays an immensity of scale seldom seen in the movies or in life.
I:581;468;"telling the story of the glory years of Howard Hughes from the 1920's to the 1940's, The Aviator displays once again that its star is much more than just another industry ""it boy""."
I:581;469;Leonardo DiCaprio is a talented actor, and here he joins the select few (Val Kilmer in The Doors, Gary Busey in The Buddy Holly Story) who almost seem to become possessed by the figure they are portraying.
I:581;470;DiCaprio nails the accent, appearance, and the idiosyncratic mannerisms of the tormented billionaire Hughes, and really should have taken home the Oscar last year, as did his co. star Cate Blanchett, whose respectful but never worshipful turn as Katharine Hepburn all but upstaged even DiCaprio.
I:581;471;the Aviator reaches great heights and mixes in feel good moments with episodes of darkest despair.
I:581;472;The most rousing scenes are of course the most dramatic, and the twin plane crashes should have anyone on the edge of his seat, just as Hughes' famous victory over Pan.
I:581;473;worthy climax to the film's nearly three.
I:581;474;the Aviator shows a director working well with his star(s) and it demonstrates exactly how good American cinema can still be.
I:581;475;It was fun to watch and makes a worthy addition to any collector's movie library.
I:581;476;This film is a great biopic standing tall with films like 'A Beautiful Mind' or 'The Insider'.
I:581;477;Leo does an amazing job portraying Hughes or so I've heard.
I:581;478;It's hard to judge the acting on this film form my perspective because I am too young to know how these people really were like, but I hear it's spot on, I mean with the oscar nods and Blanchett's win as Miss Hepburn you know the acting is up there.
I:581;479;I personally enjoy watching John C. Reilly act.
I:581;480;His portrayal of Noah Dietrich was great.
I:581;481;He just has a great presence.
I:581;482;The cameos by Stefani who played Jean Harlow and Jude Law who played Errol Flynn were great and the ever beautiful Kate Beckinsale in her performance as Ava Gardner was amazing.
I:581;483;Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda play the perfect villians and Alda (Senator Brewster) deserved that oscar.
I:581;484;I felt that Scorsese did wonders with this movie, making everything feel like you were right there.
I:581;485;The sets were beautiful the colors were vibrant and the script was very well done.
I:581;486;This is a great movie and I'd recomend it to anyone with an interest in history, aviation, the art of movie making or someone who just wants to be entertained.
I:581;487;Leonardo pulled off his best performance with a convincing portrayal of Howard Hughes.
I:581;488;This era film of the 20's captured the essence of the time and causes the viewer to believe he or she is back in time with Mr. Hughes.
I:581;489;Martin Scorsese deserves the title of best director for this film.
I:581;490;Don't get me wrong, the movie is formal in tone and lush with period detail.
I:581;491;The pivotal crash scene was particularly fantastic.
I:581;492;This was a pretty good movie if you can overlook the in completely innaccurate timeline.
I:581;493;Excellent special features as well.
I:581;494;The Aviator works not only as epic film.
I:581;495;This film captures the complexities that were Howard Hughes, a man so larger.
I:581;496;The film conveys the inner workings of Hughes, the drive, ambition and, yes, the madness that threatened to overwhelm his dreams.
I:581;497;"Not since Robert DeNiro assayed Jake LaMotta in ""Raging Bull"" has there been an actor who immersed himself so thoroughly into a character."
I:581;498;Sorry Jamie Foxx, but DiCaprio gave the best performance by an actor last year.
I:581;499;Cate Blanchett, deserving of her Oscar, gives a multi.
I:581;500;hued sympathetic turn as Katharine Hepburn.
I:581;501;He is abetted by his always engaging film editor Thelma Schoonmaker on the commentary track.
I:581;502;"Scorsese has such an impressive resume of films that it is difficult at this time to see how ""The Aviator"" ranks."
I:581;503;meaning, chopped off at the sides.
I:581;504;"produced movies with great sets, decent acting, and a sense of history, you'll enjoy ""The Aviator.'"
I:581;505;HH was a grand visionary and an aviation great.
I:581;506;This movie trivialized his aviation genius and impersonalized the man.
I:581;507;Leanardo did the best he could do.
I:581;508;The movie emphasized Howard's phobias and minimized his great achievements.
I:581;509;This portrait of Hughes shows him both as a forward looking genius who took tremendous chances that ended in great success and as a reclusive eccentric with mental problems.
I:581;510;The movie held my interest from start to finish, so for that I give it 4 stars.
I:581;511;Hughes was such an interesting man, a true documentary biography might have been actually more far more enjoyable than this fictionalized account.
I:581;512;I really like this film as it really has its act together.
I:581;513;This film shows his various efforts in Film making, the start of the Aerospace industry and his descent into madness.
I:581;514;Well done to all hands involved!
I:581;515;Hughes was a genius who received less than his due for the advancements he inspired.
I:581;516;"While appreciative of the controversy surrounding this portrayal of the behavior of the formidable film and aeronautics magnate, I will note that Martin Scorsese's 2004 offering, based on the biography "" Howard Hughes: The Secret Life"" by Charles Higham, jibes pretty well with the many eerie details of Howard Hughes' life that I first learned from an Elementary school teacher the year after his death."
I:581;517;very sobering!But this film concentrates on the aviator's life, ignoring details of his philanthropy, and focusing on his phobias, namely 9.
I:581;518;skipping ahead to 1927,Hughes (now played by a much.
I:581;519;but the film is a triumph and the young and divorced millionaire squires actress Jean Harlow(Gwen Stefani)to the premiere, after which he has the film re.
I:581;520;The film accurately depicts the well.
I:581;521;aside from a life of pleasure, business continues.
I:581;522;hepburn and Hughes have a tempestuous break.
I:581;523;suddenly that full, boyish, classic featured face of DiCaprio becomes a stage on which a thousand dramas may be played.
I:581;524;we will witness a great man's deterioration as he locks himself in his screening room, and despite pleas from Katherine Hepburn, who expresses gratitude at Howard's having prevented one Roland Sweet( Willem Dafoe) from releasing incriminating pictures of her and Spencer Tracy, refusing to come out.
I:581;525;It is an eerily brilliant scene that proves that naked people can have influence in this world.
I:581;526;"ultimately, in a style reminiscent of ""A Beautiful Mind"", we will see the Aviator rise, and we will see him triumph, even in the midst of his suffering."
I:581;527;a performance of Leonardo DiCaprio's that was quite justly answered with a Golden Globe.
I:581;528;I got my video my video in a good time, paid a great price, good condition and I look forward to seeing my new movie!
I:581;529;lewis was superb in it).
I:581;530;If you loved the era of the 30's and 40's (I'm sure Scorsese does too), you'll love the details in this off.
I:581;531;Cate Blanchette is superb also in her Oscar winning role as Katherine Hepburn.
I:581;532;Also take note of how Scorsese changes the color transfer from old 2.
I:581;533;Very understandable this won so many awards.
I:581;534;Will watch again as this is so full with information, History, and enjoyable as well.
I:581;535;Will also give as gifts.
I:581;536;May YOU enjoy as much as all those who watched with me and count me too Please.
I:581;537;In is latest film, he stars as Howard Hughes, a man who probably one of the most eccentric and misunderstood figures of the 20th century.
I:581;538;"the Aviator is directed by Martin Scorsese, who, in the opinion of this ""critic"", is one of the greatest American directors of the last 30 years."
I:581;539;His films are dark, intense, uncompromising, and are unlike most other Hollywood movies.
I:581;540;This film is more light.
I:581;541;the movie is told in chronological order, starting in the 1920s, with Howard Hughes' project in the making his movie called Hell's Angels.
I:581;542;Immediately we see his obsession with perfection.
I:581;543;The obsession with perfection is what ultimately will lead to his downfall.
I:581;544;this behavior seems harmless and humorous at first, but soon we realize it is serious business.
I:581;545;scorsese shows Howard Hughes as both a combination of artist and architect.
I:581;546;He was also able to defend himself in front of a Congressional hearing about aeronautical controversies that happened during World War 2.
I:581;547;All in all, what is most impressive about this film is Leonardo DiCaprio's performance of a complicated man.
I:581;548;He is developing into a real actor and is starting to produce some of the best work of his career.
I:581;549;DiCaprio plays this role with convincing passion, and most movie lovers will forget that it is actually DiCaprio up there on the screen.
I:581;550;the Aviator is nominated for a whopping eleven Academy Awards, including Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and most importantly, Best Picture.
I:581;551;The movie will win some of these awards for sure, because the film community has been raving about it since it was released.
I:581;552;Those who stick will find that is it a rewarding movie experience.
I:581;553;DiCaprio masterfully portrays Hughes as a genius, eccentric visionary and psychotic.
I:581;554;"His ""battle"" with Alda was superb."
I:581;555;His successful test flights are captivating.
I:581;556;Blanchett gives a strong performance.
I:581;557;"time favorite movies
I:581;558;"life and dicaprio, as always, plays an excellent role
I:581;559;This past year, 2004, was easily one of the weakest years for films in a long while.
I:581;560;All the main characters are either insanely eccentric or diabolically rich.
I:581;561;His best performance remains his other Oscar.
I:581;562;Cate Blanchett steals every scene she is in as a young version of the late Katherine Hepburn.
I:581;563;"But this performance will only be extraordinary for those who have seen a few Katherine Hepburn movies
I:581;564;My favorite performance here, bar none, comes from Alan Alda who's character is so slimy and subversive as to be the type of person you love to hate.
I:581;565;This movie has an incredible cast .
I:581;566;Leo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Ian Holm, Cate Blanchett, Jude Law, etc. etc., and some very fine acting from Mr. DiCaprio, but wow.
I:581;567;The first hour was great .
I:581;568;I am not a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but I found myself captivated by this film, and even forgetting that I was watching Mr. DiCaprio, but watching Howard Hughes.
I:581;569;a testament I begrudgingly must give to Mr. DiCaprio and his abilities as an actor.
I:581;570;"He captured the man that was Howard Hughes
I:581;571;This movie runs an amazing 170 minutes long, and one finds himself wishing it lasted even longer.
I:581;572;An added bonus.you get the second disc which has the History Channel's bio on Hughes.
I:581;573;what a wonderful surprise addition to this set!
I:581;574;But at least they knew how to tell a story and make it interesting.
I:581;575;weight subject with a light.
I:581;576;Surely Hughes deserves better, I know the audience does.
I:581;577;Director, Martin ScorseseBRILLANT EXECUTION OF A FILM THAT'S TOO LARGE FOR LIFE:Scorsese's undertaking, a sympathetic portrait of the rise and fall of a great.
I:581;578;"enigmatic American, needed a special formula which Scorsese executed, making ""The Aviator"" all the more compelling in the process."
I:581;579;"unlike films like ""Giant"" with James Dean which featured a strong beginning which then needed a rushed second reel to meet time constraints, ""The Aviator"" fleshed out that first reel without constraint and effectively touched on all the salient issues that made Howard Hughes great while clearly and fairly illustrating the tragic darkness which progressively sowed the seeds for his eventual fall."
I:581;580;appropriate ending using the device provided by his illness .
I:581;581;It was a very clever device to thematically end the movie while, at the same time, including everything the film needs in what essentially could be considered the first reel.
I:581;582;In this manner, Scorsese was able avoid compromise in the content, scope, and length of the film while keeping the studio and easily.
I:581;583;without having to see the next 25+ years of the amazing aviator's life, we had enough good lifestyle material and retrograde hints to see where Hughes' life would eventually take him.
I:581;584;Having already seen the major and most interesting highlights of Hughes' life, we had enough to fill in the conclusion without actually seeing it.
I:581;585;worthy turn at directing for Scorsese.
I:581;586;"BIG NAMES OR EFFORTHere is an incomplete list of the superb cast of ""The Aviator"":Leonardo DiCaprio ."
I:581;587;"LudlowThere was a lot of sensational acting here, but Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes truly makes the movie and becomes ""The Aviator""!"
I:581;588;Scorsese makes it clear by the consistent manner of his presentation that this did happen.
I:581;589;Hughes demands that Dietrich go to J. c. Penney's and get him some clothes.
I:581;590;puts a fine point on the growing paranoia that has always been present in Hughes' mind and represents just one of the many methods Scorsese utilizes to get the most mileage out of his script.
I:581;591;OVERALLThis is one of the best films I have ever seen.
I:581;592;The Aviator is a superbly appropriate treatment of the life of a great man who most definitely can be defined by his rise and fall and the components that influenced both.
I:581;593;Scorsese clever portrayal of balance in Hughes character by illustrating the fluctuating emotional states that influenced many of the important events of Hughes' life, is what really puts this film ahead of other epic biopics.
I:581;594;surface look at the life and times of one of America's most notorious recluses delivers plenty of dirt, if not much real introspection.
I:581;595;The mysterious Howard Hughes is certainly a tricky subject to nail down, with much of his daring decision.
I:581;596;Scorsese does a good job of displaying Hughes' paranoia and DiCapprio does an admirable job of expressing Scorsese's vision.
I:581;597;It is a fairly long film but does keep the pace up enough to keep you into it.
I:581;598;Despite the lack of forestory information, this movie is entertaining.
I:581;599;It is very accurate about the life of Howard Hughes.
I:581;600;Mr. Hughes strong attraction to have countless movie starlets was never viewed compared to what is documented from reality.
I:581;601;This picture touches on his fancination of movie production and aviation which covers the broadest and most interesting facets of Howard Hughes life.
I:581;602;The only part I really enjoyed, was the plane crash, asfor the rest of the movie, some of it was good.
I:581;603;It just jumps into the story.
I:581;604;Allen Alda is great too.
I:581;605;the impression was so good it seemed to me comedic at times (Hey, she did have a funny voice.)
I:581;606;"but to me the film has the feel of an ""incomplete"" epoc masterpiece, the way it jumps in and out of the story."
I:581;607;then having all the genius and money in the world makes those dreams come true.
I:581;608;(Hughes, not Scorcese, though Scorcese is obviously a genius as well.)
I:581;609;this is a nice film, one of Scorsese's better films in the last decade.
I:581;610;"There is a strong cast anchored by DiCaprio (best performance since ""The Basketball Diaries""), Cate Blanchett, and Kate Beckinsale, and the script and cinematography are very competent."
I:581;611;In staying true to the spirit of multimillionaire magnate Howard Hughes between the late 1920's and the late 40's, Scorsese and screenwriter John Logan are stuck with the facts as they happened, and consequently, the film feels episodic with a great, sometimes dazzling story in the first 2/3 of its epic 166.
I:581;612;minute running time and a pedantic, only occasionally involving last hour.You need to have some familiarity with Hughes' life to understand his halcyon years proving himself as a Hollywood tycoon worthy of respect, and his legendary excess during the three.year production of the now.
I:581;613;"forgotten ""Hell's Angels"" is captured perfectly here with truly thrilling aviation sequences."
I:581;614;Scorsese then focuses on Hughes' romance with Katharine Hepburn and captures the oddball chemistry of burgeoning eccentrics amid the frenzied environment of studio.
I:581;615;There's a magnificently filmed sequence of Hughes crashing his XF.11 plane in the middle of Beverly Hills.
I:581;616;leonardo DiCaprio's chief asset as an actor is his intensity of purpose, and as Hughes, he has plenty of opportunities to display this attribute with his character's obsessions with aviation, moviemaking, glamorous movie stars and ultimately germs.
I:581;617;She displays the familiar brusque manner without caution and even affects the recognizable voice but with an inaccurate throatiness that belies the legendary actress' high, fluttery pitch at the time.
I:581;618;On the other hand, Alec Baldwin is becoming a stronger character actor with every new film, and he plays Trippe with disquieting authority.
I:581;619;All the externals are impressive .
I:581;620;just the story), Robert Richardson's cinematography, Dante Ferretti's production design, Sandy Powell's costumes.
I:581;621;This is a film to respect and not to love.
I:581;622;the first disc has an excellent commentary track by Scorsese, Schoonover and producer Michael Mann .
I:581;623;HH was a fascinating man and Scorsese has made molehill out of a mountain.
I:581;624;I say good movie to own because it is so long and is full of many interesting minor characters (for example the incredible scene where Jude Law shows up as Errol Flynn).
I:581;625;With the amazing sets and performances the movie holds up to repeated viewings.
I:581;626;During that time period you witness the passion, genius, humor and oncoming sickness of Howard Hughes.
I:581;627;You don't get the full story but you do come away with the sense of the man and that makes the film successful.
I:581;628;It was good to see him in a great role such as this.
I:581;629;awaited biography of the infamously eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes is an ambitious, visually dazzling, atmospheric period piece that is, in the end, disappointingly flat.
I:581;630;The actors were magnificent and the sets, music, costumes, and cinematography brought me back to the 20's, 30's, and 40's.
I:581;631;I was in love with the ambiance of the picture as well as DiCaprio's Oscar.
I:581;632;worthy performance as Hughes and Cate Blanchett's startling flawless portrayal of the great Katharine Hepburn.
I:581;633;In addition to DiCaprio and Blanchett, the film boasts a conga line of famous faces that is sure to delight even the most flippant movie.
I:581;634;In a film that runs nearly three hours long, I need some incentive to keep watching and hold my attention.
I:581;635;Like a lot of people, I grew up hearing about Howard Hughes in his later life .
I:581;636;I enjoyed finding out what he accomplished in his youth.
I:581;637;I thought the actors were great .
I:581;638;I think Di Caprio is one of the finest actors working today.
I:581;639;he invented missiles that track their targets, and many of his contracts for the defense industry are still classified documents.
I:581;640;He was an amazing man.
I:581;641;This great film just skimmed the surface.
I:581;642;Martin Scorsese's The Aviator is a fascinating film about a fascinating man.
I:581;643;Beautifully filmed and acted, and feels much shorter than its 2.5 hours.
I:581;644;cate Blanchett especially is amazing as Kate Hepburn.
I:581;645;I have much renewed respect for her.
I:581;646;The Beach* did nothing to enamore him to me, but he really is good.
I:581;647;the visuals is a story onto themselves, just gorgeous.
I:581;648;"Just like van Gogh, who in the popular mind is ""the painter who cut off his ear"", Hughes is mistreated by the small attention span of the popular mind."
I:581;649;He was not just fabulously rich and extremely neurotic.
I:581;650;He accomplished a fantastic amount of stuff, and the film industry as well as aviation was changed forever because of him.
I:581;651;The Aviator allows DiCaprio to shine, for the viewer to forget s/he is watching Leonardo DiCaprio superstar.
I:581;652;The film brings this earlier incarnation of Hughes to light, illustrating well the very fine line between innovative ingenuity and the kind of perfectionism that pushes one over the edge toward madness.
I:581;653;Apart from Martin Scorsese's exquisite direction, the actors in the entire cast excel (with the exception of Kate Beckinsale, who strikes me as talentless and uppity).
I:581;654;The Aviator is a throroughly enjoyable movie about the early years of that eccentric millionaire,Howard Hughes.
I:581;655;He was larger than life even then, and the film is very well made.
I:581;656;The sets, the costumes, the performances, the script.
I:581;657;"Martin Scorsese's epic ""biopic"" (the new buzzword in Hollywood these days for ""Biographical Picture""), ""The Aviator"" is thrilling, disturbing, and touching all at once."
I:581;658;The Aviator captures all of it, the glory and the horror.
I:581;659;With a brilliant cast lead, most surprisingly, by Leonardo DiCaprio, this film is one of the best.
I:581;660;acted pictures I've seen in a long time.
I:581;661;"the rest of the cast is also exceptional
I:581;662;is phenomenal as Senator Brewster, who attempted to prosecute Hughes for conning the US government.
I:581;663;there are a plethora of exceptional actors with smaller, cameo.
I:581;664;But as thrilling and incredible as these events are, there are equally depressing scenes, including some of Hughes' uncontrollable obsessive/compulsiveness, and his horrendous crash in Beverly Hills during testing of the FX.11 spy plane.
I:581;665;"uplifting and positive in places, and dark and moody in others, ""The Aviator"" is dramatic, enjoyable, and powerful all around."
I:581;666;For once, the Academy is actually right.
I:581;667;This was a great choice.
I:581;668;I recommend it as very good.
I:581;669;Martin Scorsese's The Aviator is a long way from Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Taxi Driver, the films that Scorsese is best known for.
I:581;670;The Aviator tells the story of Howard Hughes .
I:581;671;billionaire, aviation fanatic, movie producer, womanizer, obsessive.
I:581;672;hughes is played by Leonardo DiCaprio in an unusual bit of casting.
I:581;673;DiCaprio also starred in Scorsese's Gangs of New York.
I:581;674;He truly shows his potential as an actor with this movie.
I:581;675;He has become an actor of true range and depth.
I:581;676;His performance as Howard Hughes is a wonder.
I:581;677;He truly deserved his Best Actor Oscar nomination.
I:581;678;Of course, Cate Blanchett got a well.
I:581;679;deserved Oscar for her memorable portrayal of Katharine Hepburn.
I:581;680;Kate Beckinsale is also very good as Ava Gardner.
I:581;681;There are numerous other great actors who are eminently watchable in this film: Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, John C. Reilly, Ian Holm, Danny Huston, Jude Law (briefly as Errol Flynn).
I:581;682;also deserving mention is the great Dante Ferretti whose production design won a well.
I:581;683;Ferretti truly brings the 1930s and '40s to life in remarkable detail.
I:581;684;I know that he must have loved depicting 1930s Hollywood on film.
I:581;685;I'm sure he loved using '30s and '40s jazz throughout the movie as well.
I:581;686;Scorsese crams a lot of detail into the movie, particularly the scenes dealing with Hollywood.
I:581;687;If you've seen Scorsese movies before you know that he has an incredible flair for visual storytelling and The Aviator is chock.
I:581;688;full of his visual genius.
I:581;689;The flying sequences are particularly well done, featuring the most computer generated effects that Scorsese has ever used.
I:581;690;The movie is about Howard Hughes, his successes and his failures.
I:581;691;His battle with obsessive compulsive disorder nearly gets the better of him, but he emerges victorious thanks partly to his determination and partly to his intelligence.
I:581;692;i recommend The Aviator if only for the wondrous direction, cinematography, and production design and for the great performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett.
I:581;693;There is a personal story here that will connect with some people and won't connect with others, yet there is much to enjoy and admire about this fabulous period drama.
I:581;694;I shall start with this chap DiCaprio.
I:581;695;I think this point is important because his Adonis.
I:581;696;Additionally, DiCaprio's portrayal of Howard presents him as brash, gauche and impolite, spouting profanity .
I:581;697;one of her relatives was a general in the Civil War, I believe, and she had geneological connections to George Washington etc.
I:581;698;As a result, Howard grew up with the reserve and refinement possessed by men of his class.
I:581;699;This is one of the first things about him mentioned by those who knew him.
I:581;700;Howard was in awe of beautiful women and would always seek out a proper introduction from a third party before approaching a lady he coveted.
I:581;701;Because of this and also because of his greater wisdom, discernment, savoir faire and high IQ, everyone looked to him for leadership and guidance, not the other way around.
I:581;702;This was remarkable and did a tremendous lot to advance the idea that commercial aviation was a plausible idea.
I:581;703;He was very proud of this accomplishment.
I:581;704;but this man was exceptional: exceptionally intelligent, exceptionally kind and generous (despite publicity to the contrary), exceptionally handsome, exceptionally capable, exceptionally strong and brave, exceptionally savvy and discerning, exceptionally obstinate and sedulous, exceptionally wealthy.
I:581;705;I feel it is more important and moreover it is what we owe him as custodians of his legacy to publicize his genius and unique gifts which advanced civilization with regards to aeronautics, commercial aviation, filmaking, technology and research.
I:581;706;Howard was at once gentle and kind, sensitive and generous .
I:581;707;The Aviator is undoubtebly one of the best films of the year 2004, thanks to its spectacular cast, splendid story, and immensely detailed sets and wonderful special effects.
I:581;708;Director Martin Scorsese brings the glamorous world of the early to mid 20th century to life with a slew of vibrant colors and galant costumes that reflect the era very closely.
I:581;709;Leonardo DiCaprio gives a magnificent performance as the tormented airplane mogul Howard Hughes, with Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale are marvelous in their supporting roles as world.
I:581;710;winning film is an essential piece of fine movie.
I:581;711;making that deserves a place on any film lover's collection.
I:581;712;A nice approach to a very complex person and subject.
I:581;713;Something interesting to say, for example, about the relationship between Howard's internal life and his psychological problems.
I:581;714;"technically superb, with terrific performances by Leo DeCaprio as Hughes and Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn
I:581;715;But it did create the right mixtures for Hughes to be one of the nation's most memorable millionaires in history.
I:581;716;the acting in the film is decent.
I:581;717;DiCaprio gives a strong performance, given the limitation of the character he was playing and Cate Blanchett steals the scenes with her memorable interpretation of a very complicated Katherine Hepburn.
I:581;718;An entertaining story of a man whose image and memories will never die.
I:581;719;Wonderfully acted and beautifully shot and designed, this movie captures the aura of Hollywood's past and also the boldness and the terrors of Howard Hughes.
I:581;720;Scorsese is a brilliant and risk.
I:581;721;taking director, and this is the film for which he should have received his Oscar.
I:581;722;The Aviator will be appreciated much more a few years from now.
I:581;723;"The Aviator focuses on the brilliant and tragic life of the fascinating madman and genius, Howard Hughes, 1905.1976, (to be precise, 20 years of it, from 1927 when 22 years old Hughes was producing the film ""Hell's Angels"" until 1947 when his most famous aircraft, the Hercules was completed)."
I:581;724;"The film is as amazing and dark as the man who called himself with pride, ""Howard Hughes, the Aviator""."
I:581;725;Martin Scorsese made a spectacular and dynamic picture and Leonardo DiCaprio earns my respect and admiration for his acting .
I:581;726;he is one of the most talented young actors now and I will be waiting for his following films impatiently.
I:581;727;I trusted him in every scene and he made me feel strongly for and sympathize with Howard Hughes's affliction.
I:581;728;alan Alda and Alec Baldwin both gave great performances as the corrupted and disgusting Senator Brewster (Alda) and truly memorable Pan.
I:581;729;american Airways CEO Juan Trippe, Hughes' enemy and competitor (Baldwin played a delightful villain).
I:581;730;"i feel that ""The Aviator"" took off the ground like a huge steel bird and took me with it to the marvelous journey."
I:581;731;"I also believe that ""The Aviator"" is much better and more interesting film than that year's Oscar winner ."
I:581;732;The Aviator is a good example that is showing us that Hollywood is still putting out great films.
I:581;733;The story is inspiring and sad at the same time.
I:581;734;It is inspiring because he became everything he said he would as a child, but it was also part of his destruction.
I:581;735;All of the co. stars, while not really looking very much like who they are supposed to be, do a great job as well.
I:581;736;the production of the film was really well done.
I:581;737;The look and the feel puts us back during Howard's time.
I:581;738;The scenery is very beautiful and so are the costumes that the actors and actresses are wearing.
I:581;739;It all looks very authentic.
I:581;740;great actors, sets and costumes.
I:581;741;Highly recommed this film, it is everything good anyone has ever said of this film.
I:581;742;This is one of the best films of the year.
I:581;743;runner of the Academy Awards, I believe this film delivers something that most movies being made nowadays lack.
I:581;744;Cate Blanchete is the most stunning Kate Hepburn and delivers an Oscar worthy performance.
I:581;745;The cinematography and Scorsese's shots captured beautiful scenes.
I:581;746;This film depicts a young Hughes and DiCaprio really brings out that character with passion, almost as if he actually knew him.
I:581;747;This is Scorsese's best film since Casino and I suggest that you RUN and watch this film, which will become an instant classic in due time.
I:581;748;A good piece of story telling.
I:581;749;the usage of color is of particular interest .
I:581;750;some scenes are real good .
I:581;751;We can almost hear Mr. Hughes's inner soul and character during the design processes and especially in the hearing.
I:581;752;only I feel the film has dwelt a but much on Hughes's extravaganza .
I:581;753;Was a very well done movie.
I:581;754;mr Hughes was way ahead of his times.
I:581;755;from a very young age Mr Hughes knew what he wanted out of life and went after it.
I:581;756;I really looked forward to seeing this film, my expectations were to learn about the life and times of Howard Hughes.
I:581;757;Leonardo Dicaprio was perfect for this role.
I:581;758;All of the other cast members were well chosen, and the story line was excellent.
I:581;759;A movie where everything fits perfectly.
I:581;760;This movie is worth seeing becuase of superb acting of Leonardo Di Caprio.
I:581;761;For a past 2 year he's been establishing himself as one of the important actors around.
I:581;762;"His performance in ""Catch me if you can"" was brilliant, but in ""Aviator"" he surpasses himself."
I:581;763;in general the second part of the movie is much better.
I:581;764;Second part is interesting and acting wise and directing wise it is even more thrilling.
I:581;765;I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie.
I:581;766;The blending of the portrayal of a genius and someone crippled by mental illness is done very well in this film and is acted quite well.
I:581;767;I will watch it again simply because I was in awe of a man that I knew very little about, just that he was a rich man.
I:581;768;DeCaprio was very very good and I would recommend that everyone see this movie.
I:581;769;Leonardo Dicaprio is handsome and I liked him in Titanic, but he isn't great here.
I:581;770;For one of the first times since 'Gilbert Grape' Leonardo DiCaprio shows that he is indeed mastering his craft and once he gets past the eternal youth of his appearance, he probably will become an even more potent force on film.
I:581;771;Couple that with the character of Howard Hughes who to this day continues to surprise us with all of the wild magician inventions for which he is credited and the format is fully justified.
I:581;772;the title of the film emphasizes the focus of Hughes' visions .
I:581;773;making the fastest, most innovative, largest airplanes in history .
I:581;774;But as Scorsese tells this story, Hughes is able to step out of seclusion long enough to give a brilliant rebuttal in a congressional hearing led by Senator Brewster (Alan Alda) and open the world's eyes to a lot of governmental dark shenanigans.
I:581;775;The supporting cast is excellent, but much of the credit for the success of this strange tale lies in the total commitment by Leonardo DiCaprio.
I:581;776;This is a big film!
I:581;777;Martin Scorsese's wonderfully filmed biopic of Hughes' early years is a wonderfully stylish film which captures the eccentric billionaire as he begins to develop his strangely bizarre behavior.
I:581;778;i think Leonardo DiCaprio did a great job of acting in this film and truly captured the essence of Hughes.
I:581;779;he definitely did his homework!
I:581;780;Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Kate Hepburn was brilliant!
I:581;781;It's amazing how Cate captured Hepburn's voice and mannerisms.
I:581;782;she surely deserved her Oscar win!
I:581;783;I have read several biographies on Hughes and Scorsese stays pretty close to the truth.
I:581;784;the crash of Hughes' experimental plane in the film is amazing!
I:581;785;One wonders how the film makers were able to put this together so realistically!It's been quite a while since Hollywood has dished out the bucks for such a wonderful looking film and they succeeded on all fronts in my opinion.
I:581;786;watch some of the old films from that period and compare it to this film and you can see that detail was very important to Scorcese!
I:581;787;I think Kate Beckinsale's performance as Ava Gardner lacked a certain credibility but it was honest and forthright.
I:581;788;although the film didn't win many awards it won the critic's praise.
I:581;789;I found his review to be pretty much on target.
I:581;790;If you enjoy biopics this a sure winner!
I:581;791;The Aviator traces the life of legendary billionaire, playboy, independent filmmaker, and aviation pioneer Howard Hughes from 1927 to 1947.
I:581;792;the story begins during production of Hughes' air battle epic Hell's Angels, delayed due to his fixation with insignificant details.
I:581;793;When the end of filming coincided with the advent of talkies, Hughes reshot the entire picture with sound .
I:581;794;He later bought TWA, set an air speed record, created a spy plane (and suffered extreme injuries and burns in a spectacular crash during its test flight), and also built and flew the infamous troop ship dubbed the Spruce Goose.
I:581;795;Completely assuming the role, it is the best performance of his career.
I:581;796;"Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Katherine Hepburn, with whom Hughes had a lengthy and torrid relationship, is astounding
I:581;797;under the capable hands of director Martin Scorsese, the film is stylish and riveting.
I:581;798;overall, The Aviator is a magnificent depiction of a decadent time and those who lived it.
I:581;799;Could have/should have won best picture award.
I:581;800;It is Howard Hughes in his prime.
I:581;801;Hughes is presented in a balanced light in this longer.
I:581;802;Howard Hughes is both a genius and a little mad.
I:581;803;Therefore, he is a great character study and DiCaprio pulls it off so that when you are watching the movie you think you are watching Howard Hughes and not DiCaprio.
I:581;804;Scorsese, the director, is brilliant and risk.
I:581;805;He should have received the Academy Award for Best Director.
I:581;806;The Aviator is a great film and will have lasting power and will be appreciated by many in the years to come.
I:581;807;The film reminds us that his psychological troubles were very real and that he became enslaved to them.
I:581;808;The Hollywood and military history here is fascinating, the cast is excellent, and while some aviation scenes are heavily pronounced as digitally remastered (Intentional?
I:581;809;, it possesses a cinematic love of aerial camera work.
I:581;810;so its nice to know that there are still going to be great movies out there to fill it's oscar shoes!
I:581;811;runner for the crown (best picture!)
I:581;812;Leonardo Di Caprio gives more to this film than one can expect/imagine.
I:581;813;There's a certain spark in the eyes of the great actor that underlines his dream and wilfulness.
I:581;814;i'm not sure on what I derived out of this film but at the same time I must add I enjoyed this film more than I thought I would have.
I:581;815;i recommend this film to anyone who has heard it's name.
I:581;816;The customs were great in this picture.
I:581;817;The camera work was also well thought out.
I:581;818;The acting was also quite good.
I:581;819;The first half of the movie was interesting and well.
I:581;820;An interesting flicker, excellent detail.
I:581;821;Touched frequently on flashes of life while I was growing up and old, This presentation filled in a lot of blanks in my knowledge of Mr. Hughes.
I:581;822;The bits of real video meshed with excellent computer video made for good entertainment.
I:581;823;I loved this movie because it didn't show the disease comically.
I:581;824;this is a captivating movie and the special features are great.
I:581;825;The plot keeps moving and it never gets boring.
I:581;826;It is one of Leonardo DiCaprio's best works.
I:581;827;I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.
I:581;828;BRILLANT EXECUTION OF A FILM THAT'S TOO LARGE FOR LIFE:Scorsese's undertaking, a sympathetic portrait of the rise and fall of a great.
I:581;829;"enigmatic American, needed a special formula which Scorsese executed, making ""The Aviator"" all the more compelling in the process."
I:581;830;"unlike films like ""Giant"" with James Dean which featured a strong beginning which then needed a rushed second reel to meet time constraints, ""The Aviator"" fleshed out that first reel without constraint and effectively touched on all the salient issues that made Howard Hughes great while clearly and fairly illustrating the tragic darkness which progressively sowed the seeds for his eventual fall."
I:581;831;appropriate ending using the device provided by his illness .
I:581;832;It was a very clever device to thematically end the movie while, at the same time, including everything the film needs in what essentially could be considered the first reel.
I:581;833;In this manner, Scorsese was able avoid compromise in the content, scope, and length of the film while keeping the studio and easily.
I:581;834;IT WAS ALL OVERWithout having to see the next 25+ years of the amazing aviator's life, we had enough good lifestyle material and retrograde hints to see where Hughes' life would eventually take him.
I:581;835;Having already seen the major and most interesting highlights of Hughes' life, we had enough to fill in the conclusion without actually seeing it.
I:581;836;worthy turn at directing for Scorsese.
I:581;837;WHAT A CASTING STATEMENT!To name a few, here is the terrific cast of the Aviator:Leonardo DiCaprio .
I:581;838;"LudlowThere was a lot of sensational acting here, but Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes truly makes the movie and becomes ""The Aviator""!"
I:581;839;WORTH MENTIONING:Scorsese effectively uses a neat device in fictionalizing where the beginning and usually the end of a dramatized occurrence or theme of a scene is framed by events we can see are clearly biographical facts.
I:581;840;Scorsese makes it clear by the consistent manner of his presentation that this did happen.
I:581;841;Hughes demands that Dietrich go to J. c. Penney's and get him some clothes.
I:581;842;puts a fine point on the growing paranoia that has always been present in Hughes' mind and represents just one of the many methods Scorsese utilizes to get the most mileage out of his script.
I:581;843;bOTTOM LINE:This is one of the best films I have ever seen.
I:581;844;The Aviator is a superbly appropriate treatment of the life of a great man who most definitely can be defined by his rise and fall and the components that influenced both.
I:581;845;19 Executive Producers with Mr. DiCaprio on top and also the lone star shown above the title.
I:581;846;On the other hand Kate Beckinsdale does a terrific job as Ava Gardner both in portrayal and beauty.
I:581;847;Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin turn in very notable performances that try to spark up the fimn.
I:581;848;3 actors, great Special Effects and Cinematography.
I:581;849;there is no doubt that mr. Scorcese is a brilliant director.
I:581;850;Howard Hughes: the spirit of the courage, the unexhausted impresario, the prolific mind in search of new dreams, the dare film producer, the creative freedom, the innovation as the vehicle of perpetual inspiration, the real hunter in the urban jungle, the man against the rules incarnated as any one else the essential legend of the American ideal.
I:581;851;Somehow that world demanded an opened mind in constant no satisfaction state: There are many Howard Hughes in Howard Hughes, reminds us Blanchet.
I:581;852;installed in his mind as a perpetuum mobile and collected its tribute.
I:581;853;leonardo Di Caprio has made his most impressive achievement of his career.
I:581;854;He caught the right mood of this outstanding and risky visionary and, despite his own voice didn't help at all in fundamental sequences of the film as the audience against Senator Brewster, the camera works out to perfection levels to show the internal character through his facial inflexions and expressions.
I:581;855;scorsese made an admirable film and even this is his second biography after Ragging bull, he could not convince the Academy to make of this picture, the second best film of 2004 after The Sea inside to my mind in my personal opinion.
I:581;856;There are many virtues in this artwork and I really would emphasize in just three: the first is the progressive illuminating process, the light in the Golf field for instance when Blanchet makes her appearance is perfect, recreating with absolute fidelity the ambiance of the early thirties.
I:581;857;The second issue is the artistic direction: the camera shows with discrete sumptuousness, the essential atmosphere of those years: the warm homage when Hughes goes to Hell's Angels premiere and the Dance Room in which he is inquired by Baldwin and he decides to retire is told with eloquent touch.
I:581;858;blanchet as always was splendid and Beckingsale is radiant in her brief appearances: Reilly is superb with his character and Alan Alda was top notch too.
I:581;859;the way of future, the way of future, the way.
I:581;860;that said, Hughes was a fascinating, over.
I:581;861;top person who did more before he descended into madness than most can accomplish in a lifetime of relative sanity.
I:581;862;scorcese wisely focuses on the most productive years between the time when Hughes burst onto the national scene as a brash, over.
I:581;863;top young man with more money than sense and the descent into his final madness.
I:581;864;He had a great impact on the world of aviation even though he seldom produced a significant number of production model aircraft.
I:581;865;diCaprio's performance was riveting and seemed to me to get across the essence of the man very well.
I:581;866;she seems very wise about men and is helpful to Hughes but too smart to become entwined in his life.
I:581;867;scorcece has made a very good film that is visually stunning at times and drags only in the long insanity scenes toward the end.
I:581;868;The film should provide contenders for some Oscars but the competition is pretty fierce.
I:581;869;for those who worry about ratings, the PG label is pretty realistic .
I:581;870;sexual scenes are pretty much more hinted about than shown in gory detail.
I:581;871;if you review the events in the movie with this in mind, everything will suddenly make sense.
I:581;872;i give the film a ZERO star for historical accuracy, and 5 stars for special effects!
I:581;873;enjoy the movie for it's entertainment value of the special effects.
I:581;874;The fact that an idiot like Scorcese is viewed as one of Hollywood's finest director producers pretty much proves that.
I:581;875;ray transfer of this instant classic is superb, probably one of the best looking transfers to high definition of this MUST own Martin Scorcese epic.
I:581;876;Dicaprio delivers a great performance as the eccentric but brilliant aviator turned filmmaker, Howard Hughes.
I:581;877;This is really a character study but Scorsese also makes this a film about filmmaking which for the casual viewer might not be that interesting, but anyone interested in the history of film and one of the mediums pioneers will really enjoy this.
I:581;878;I believe the greatest achievement of this movie is for almost three hours not boring me.
I:581;879;It always kept my attention.
I:581;880;I sat riveted looking at the screen delighted with the beauty of the film, the presence of the actors, all of Scorsese's tricks.
I:581;881;More so when Cate Blanchett was first seen, she is beautiful.
I:581;882;Leonardo DiCaprio turns in his best performance in the picture.
I:581;883;This one is one for the ages.
I:581;884;Scorsese's most accesible movie, one of his best.
I:581;885;"piece or maybe I just don't know a stinker when I see it, but I say that ""The Aviator"" was a superb film that I will watch again and again."
I:581;886;"periods have a ""vintage"" cinematic look to them), the music fabulous and the acting spot."
I:581;887;face works here and lends even more to the realism that DiCaprio gives to his portrayal of HH.
I:581;888;"thriller"" watch it again and make note of the fabulous sets, the wonderful cinematography, the music and the dead."
I:581;889;And for heaven's sake if for nothing else watch it for the slick flying and aviation engineering history lesson.
I:581;890;this film is definitely a winner in my book!
I:581;891;Very good movie about Howard Hughes directed in a big Hollywood style way.
I:581;892;Impressive biopic about the eccentric genius Howard Hughes.
I:581;893;There's something about passionate men that inspires others to dream bigger dreams and achieve bigger goals.
I:581;894;And Hughes was passionate if anything.
I:581;895;But he can be terribly witty and to the point as well.
I:581;896;one at the table listens to one.
I:581;897;"When the mother finally states offhand ""we don't care about money"" Hughes strikes back with ""that's because you have and always had money, you were born with it."
I:581;898;And walks calmly from the room.
I:581;899;another fine example of his wit comes to light during the senate hearing, as he strikes back at the corrupt senator who has set it up to favour Pan.
I:581;900;seeing all those great aeroplanes from bygone eras pass the screen is a feast to the eyes by itself.
I:581;901;The entire movie is filmed beautifully and luscious, the in.
I:581;902;it's a `big' film .
I:581;903;as Hughes would have liked no doubt .
I:581;904;yet it's intimate enough to completely relate to the man.
I:581;905;It's essential to portray the man's life and battles effectively of course, but it was a bit poignant at times.
I:581;906;He may have been difficult at times, for himself as well as others, but he was most of all a good man, a great man, a visionary and a huge individualist.
I:581;907;His role as Howard Hughes is utterly convincing.
I:581;908;Cate Blanchett's Hepburn is pleasant to watch, and so is Kate Beckinsale's Ava Gardner.
I:581;909;all in all, a compelling film from start to end, about a great historical figure.
I:581;910;excellent portrayal of the Genius of H. h .
I:581;911;The Aviator is Martin Scorsese's best picture since my all time favorite Cape Fear.
I:581;912;He takes us on a tour.
I:581;913;force through the life of one of the most eccentric American pioneers, Howard Hues.
I:581;914;Scorsese's signature is all over this film from the soundtrack to the camera angles.
I:581;915;He's definitely a work of art in and of himself and he never ceases to amaze me!The mastery definitely does not end with Scorsese but rather starts with him.
I:581;916;Leonardo DiCaprio was absolutely phenomenal portraying Howard Hues with all his intensely complicated personality: innovator, philanderer, hypochondriac and outright crazy!
I:581;917;He will win the Oscars for this role, no doubt about it.
I:581;918;my favorite portrayal, though, was that of Katharine Hepburn, played by the amazing Cate Blanchett.
I:581;919;She definitely got the accent, timbre, mannerism, and the most inconspicuous subtleties down to the tee!
I:581;920;Needless to say, The Aviator is a colossal visual treat.
I:581;921;The set designers and cinematographers did an exquisite job in bringing the charm and glamour of the 30's, 40's and 50's to our very eyes with ease and extreme perfection.
I:581;922;go see this film on the big screen and allow yourself to be awed!
I:581;923;He truly owned the role of Howard Hughes in this picture.
I:581;924;To see such a brilliant, driven man gradually lose control of his life and mind is heart wrenching to say the least.
I:581;925;The casting for this movie was perfection.
I:581;926;I think he's a very underappreciated actor and he's excellent here as always.
I:581;927;His back and forth with DiCaprio at a senate hearing was the high point of the movie for me.
I:581;928;howard Hughes was a larger than life figure in his time and this movie was an excellent representation of his ambitions, romances, and accomplishments, as well as his setbacks and implied eventual disintegration.
I:581;929;I like the fact that Scorsese chooses to end the picture where he does, just after the successful flight of the Hercules.
I:581;930;The film leaves us with the legacy of Hughes as The Aviator, a man who contributed a great deal to the industry of avionics in this country and foreshadows his fall into seclusion and madness without forcing us to watch the tragic end of this great man's life.
I:581;931;But most importantly De Caprio, who seems along with Martin Scorsese to be replaying the iconic Americana number these days, is just a pretty face.
I:581;932;Didn't he say in an interview with Charlie Rose recently that Cinema was the great art form of this age?
I:581;933;Both the acting and the interview statements are a kind of consumer confidence ploy (perhaps for each other).
I:581;934;Movies like this are the reason intelligent Americans emigrate abroad.
I:581;935;This film is pure American onanistic navel gazing.
I:581;936;Actually I guess this is a really good review!!
I:581;937;Go and see this film!
I:581;938;If you love aviation, you will love this.
I:581;939;Also, if you are interested in the history and times of Howard Hughes you will love this.
I:581;940;"AND, the ""golden age"" of Hollywood stuff is a treat as well."
I:581;941;I thought the corrupt government material was incredible!
I:581;942;Can you believe that they had the balls to introduce a pro.
I:581;943;This movie does a great job of showing what an incredible man he was.
I:581;944;At the very least, and I mean LEAST, you have to love him for kicking Hollywood's ass as an outsider!
I:581;945;(and admitedly, the film does a good job of showing what is going to happen to Mr. Hughes).
I:581;946;Leonardo is masterful in this film, brilliant.
I:581;947;when the film gets to the scene with Alec Baldwin and the Katharine Hepburn estate scenes, you will notice the film is now a more normal color.
I:581;948;"diCaprio made you believe that he was ""Howard Hughes"" and the scenes of madness shows you how talented this actor is."
I:581;949;The Aviator soars as it captures the most glorious slice of the life of Howard Hughes, the filmmaker, aviation innovator, and mentally unstable billionaire.
I:581;950;The movie has an easier time with its subject matter, because Hughes lived a flamboyant life.
I:581;951;He was a brilliant technical innovator and a business visionary.
I:581;952;proposed monopoly on international flight, Hughes did everything in a huge way.
I:581;953;Leonardo DiCaprio, as Hughes, captures the dashing and erratic Hughes with the same boldness as Hughes lived the first part of his life.
I:581;954;And when he publicly confronts a corrupt senator, all you see is Howard Hughes spitting fire.
I:581;955;"Director Martin Scorsese's biopic ""The Aviator"" is a huge, exuberant Hollywood production which covers approximately three decades in the life of a real Hollywood production kinda guy, Howard Hughes."
I:581;956;The Aviator lavishly depicts Hollywood's Golden Age in all its glory.
I:581;957;There are gorgeous women .
I:581;958;"Big Stars, starlets, and wannabees, all wearing fabulous period clothing
I:581;959;"pop and jazz
I:581;960;He is portrayed as a tragic figure, and with all his money, brilliance and success, he was just that.
I:581;961;one, Howard Jr. inherited the company and the wealth, and this is how the original capital was acquired to make movies.
I:581;962;As a teenager, Hughes declared that his goals in life were to become the world's best golfer, the world's best pilot, and the world's best movie producer.
I:581;963;million dollar venture (unheard of back then), which takes well over two years to make.
I:581;964;The movie is a spectacular success, despite dire predictions.
I:581;965;Hughes is viewed as a loser, a twenty.
I:581;966;He makes back his exorbitant initial investment and more .
I:581;967;He is clearly a man with a vision, from an early age, and ruthlessly pursues it in spite of a crippling mental illness.
I:581;968;Ms. Blanchett's outstanding performance as the extraordinary actress illuminates the screen.
I:581;969;She admits to seeing some in herself.
I:581;970;Their troubled relationship is at the heart of the movie, making it appear that Ms. Hepburn was the love of his life.
I:581;971;I have to give him credit, however.
I:581;972;His performance as Howard Hughes is very credible, mature, sensitive and, at times, exhilarating.
I:581;973;He does capture the essence of Mr. Hughes and that is laudable indeed.
I:581;974;Trippe uses his power and influence to insure that Pan Am maintains a monopoly on international air travel.
I:581;975;wWII, rigged Senate hearing scenes in DC, accusing Hughes of wrongdoing, are wonderful.
I:581;976;The gruesome accident is portrayed very vividly on screen.
I:581;977;Hughes was a man of great strengths who contributed much to society.
I:581;978;On an up note, this is very much a film about a man who had extraordinary dreams and made them come true.
I:581;979;When I first learned of their intentions towards this film, I anticipated an intricate character study with Scorsese's eye for detail.
I:581;980;after watching this film again recently, I was reminded why there is nearly no doubt that, in my opinion, Scorsese is the greatest American director of all time and DiCaprio is the best actor of his generation.
I:581;981;Each of Scorsese's shots and directorial choices are perfect.
I:581;982;Every movement, tic, and cough from DiCaprio is compelling.
I:581;983;As ambitious as Hughes himself, the production design is fitting for such an incredible movie.
I:581;984;A brilliant choice of editing.
I:581;985;this dazzling biopic of Hughes' rise to fame and fortune pairs perfectly with Scorsese because he manages to do what most others think can't be done: He created a 3.
I:581;986;While it is not Scorsese's best, it is still very impressive and quite epic.
I:581;987;Scorsese has done an amazing job of showing one adaptation of Hughes' life from his ambitious beginnings as a filmmaker to his later contributions to the world of aviation.
I:581;988;Due to another impressive performance from DiCaprio, Hughes' obsessive.
I:581;989;But the most impressive acting in the film is Cate Blanchett's role as Katherine Hepburn, one of the most famous (and yet still mysterious) actresses in movie history.
I:581;990;Blanchett is very convincing as Hepburn, almost as if she had found some way to become possessed by Kate Hepburn's spirit as she frolicked through each of her scenes with biting wit and attractive charm that is shared by both Hepburn and Blanchett, winning her the Oscar she deserved for this role.
I:581;991;All together a great film with some stunning visuals, outstanding performances, and a time capsule glimpse into movie history, a film you may want to watch again and again.

I:581;998;This is well documented and even proven by the autopsy.
I:581;999;The Aviator inspired me to order the biography of Howard Hughes on Amazon (The Amazing Howard Hughes).
I:581;1000;Hats off to DiCaprio who gave an authentic performance to the real Howard.
I:581;1001;An extraordinary man of romantic and engineering proportions, he revolutionized modern aeronautics by day, and romanced Hollywood starlets by night.
I:581;1002;The movie syncronizes to the stories in the biography, so you'll get the real story.
I:581;1003;for those looking for lots of aeronautical action and Hollywood glitz, this movie delivers on all fronts.
I:581;1004;Buckle up and enjoy your flight!!
I:581;1005;This film is entertaining, and much more effective than any one biography of Howard Hughes.
I:581;1006;The pace of the movie, coupled with the fantastic acting by Leonardo DiCaprio as the livid Howard Hughes, gives an aura of 3hrs much in the way of inspiration.
I:581;1007;It is so wonderful to think that movies such as these aren't being overlooked by the latest craze.
I:581;1008;When will Scorsese win a *(**( academy award for best director!
I:581;1009;This done to please the audience.
I:581;1010;As with most movies you want to understand the development of a character.
I:581;1011;It is with the glamour and glitz of this film that viewers will understand the glamour and glitz that the main character lived in.
I:581;1012;"The Aviator is not one of Scorsese's greatest but it is very good overall, somewhere in between ""Color of Money"" and ""Last Temptation of Christ,"" and as full."
I:581;1013;I saw the film twice in theatres, and the second time proved just as good and enveloping.
I:581;1014;The commentary is insightful (as one would hope from Scorsese, Schoonmaker and Michael Mann).
I:581;1015;The film will keep you on the edge of your seat and the bloody plane crash is one of the most horrific in detail ever put on film.
I:581;1016;Di Caprio has established himself as a truly terrific actor.
I:581;1017;If you can overlook the terrible miscasting of Leonardo Dicapprio as Howard Hughes then you'll probably enjoy this sumptuous rendering of old Hollywood.
I:581;1018;The role demanded a lean, intense black.
I:581;1019;haired man, who had his own eccentric way of moving and talking.
I:581;1020;Anyway, this movie is worth seeing at least once.
I:581;1021;"In an acting/producer/director relationship bar none, ""The Aviator"" impressed me as one of the most entertaining films of the modern era."
I:581;1022;The film's electric pace is reminiscent of some of Frank Capra's best work 60.70 years ago.
I:581;1023;"In DiCaprio, one sees flashes of Errol Flynn, dashes of James Dean, crashes of John Wayne, crashes of Jim Morrison, the reclusiveness of a male Greta Garbo,the political genius of Huey Long, and the aeronautical genius of a true ""Boy Wonder""."
I:581;1024;just imagine the energy required to meld these themes together effectively.
I:581;1025;This 2004 Howard Hughes biopic stands out amongst the best biographical pictures of the last 10 years.
I:581;1026;"Although not as gritty and intense as Scorsese's greatest film ""Raging Bull"" (1980), this picture is well."
I:581;1027;The life and times of the enigmatic Howard Hughes make for compelling subject matter and Socorsese's effort does not disappoint.
I:581;1028;"Given these considerations, ""The Aviator"" still manages to showcase quite a few original Scorsese sequences recalling his raw and intensely personal early films."
I:581;1029;We witness the continuous nervous energy and persistent drive of Hughes to achieve his daring goals, all the while breaking new ground in aviation, film and big business.
I:581;1030;This film closely tracks Hughes' personal life as well, his well.
I:581;1031;publicized affairs with famous starlets of the day such as Katherine Hepburn (played well by Cate Blanchett) are illustrated in.
I:581;1032;depth with notable performances throughout.
I:581;1033;leonardo DiCaprio continues to grow and develop under Scorsese's direction, and the development is phenomenal to witness.
I:581;1034;"Beginning with ""Gangs Of New York"" (2002) and continuing beyond this movie (2006's masterful ""The Departed""), DiCaprio's acting chops are sharpening with each performance, eclipsing his previous work and establishing his talent amongst Hollywood's A. list actors."
I:581;1035;A fascinating example of this balancing act occurs when Hughes is confronted with a ruthless public relations attack, designed to coerce him into selling his airline TWA to his commercial competitor, Pan Am (whose chief, Juan Trippe is played by Alec Baldwin).
I:581;1036;Hughes collects his faculties and battles back with impressive vigor, this after nearly dying in a spectacular crash of his XF.11 spy plane prototype.
I:581;1037;All of these events unfold beautifully and the rhythm of this film holds our attention despite the nearly 3 hour running time.
I:581;1038;The Aviator holds up well on repeat viewings despite the long running time, it covers the entire first half of Hughe's remarkable life and career, and a second feature could easily be written detailing Hughes' subsequent years in Las Vegas and his premature death.
I:581;1039;All in all, DiCaprio's growth as an actor cannot be understated, this is a must.
I:581;1040;I had to make myself finish watching this movie.
I:581;1041;I will say that I thought Leonardo DiCaprio did a good job as always, but he was about all that I enjoyed.
I:581;1042;Regardless, I enjoyed the movie and the special effects were great.
I:581;1043;"With classic films like ""Raging Bull"" and ""Goodfellas"" Scorsese was still able to exceed expectations and a lesser work such as ""Bringing Out the Dead"" was far better than expected."
I:581;1044;There is always the potential for greatness with Scorsese, and I always hope for the best but expect something less.
I:581;1045;The Aviator is a biopic focusing on part of the life of Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio), a wealthy filmmaker and aviator, a true American genius with all the success and tragedy that this entails.
I:581;1046;"The movie is good, and the performances better, but ""The Aviator"" is less than the sum of its parts not greater."
I:581;1047;"He is directing a movie called ""Hell's Angels"", an incredibly ambitious film about World War I. Personally financed by Hughes, the film ran way over any expected budget and took three years to complete (compare this to the 18 months of Stanley Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"" which was said to be extremely long and demanding)."
I:581;1048;The Aviator shows the rise of Howard Hughes.
I:581;1049;"His movie is a success, he spends his time with famous movie stars including a star of ""Hell's Angels"" Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani), Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), and the rise of Howard Hughes continues as he becomes more and more successful in aviation."
I:581;1050;The Aviator is a very big, broad movie.
I:581;1051;"what helps ""The Aviator"" to rise above other movies is the performances."
I:581;1052;Every actor in this movie is quite excellent.
I:581;1053;Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of the strongest performances in his career and for the first time he was believable as an older man.
I:581;1054;I bought him as an adult, and this was one of my biggest concerns.
I:581;1055;John C Reilly is perpetually solid as Hughes' business man Noah Dietrich.
I:581;1056;The real heart of the movie, however, is Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn.
I:581;1057;She seems to give both the movie and Howard Hughes a sense of morality and direction.
I:581;1058;She is the power driving the film, and perhaps his life.
I:581;1059;"this film is an instance of every part being so good, especially the acting, but these parts somehow do not quite come together to make the masterpiece ""The Aviator"" almost was."
I:581;1060;"Inexplicable, perhaps, and this movie will likely wind up on ""Best of"" lists and may very well earn an Oscar Nomination, but it doesn't live up to what it almost was."
I:581;1061;The acting is worth the price of admission, but the film itself is only a Grade: B. joe Sherry
I:581;1062;The Aviator, an epic biopic of Howard Hughes' career, won 5 of 11 Oscar nominations, 4 of 14 BAFTA, 3 of 6 Golden Globe, and 1 of 11 Satellite.
I:581;1063;It was well deserving of all these industry accolades, and more not listed here.
I:581;1064;His second film with Leonardo DiCaprio in the leading role has a lengthy all.
I:581;1065;star cast, (2) great attention to detail for accurate period costumes, props and sets spanning several decades, (3) numerous special effects created with large scale models (instead of using CGI), (4) special methods used on the film during processing to recreate the look of Hughes 2.
I:581;1066;The Aviator is an epic in more than length and subject scope, it's epic in a half.
I:581;1067;Even if the subject matter, Hughes' life, were not of interest, seeing the film just to observe the technical work that went into making it is worth while.
I:581;1068;ray transfer is excellent with great color and much detail which would be expected with a 2004 film.
I:581;1069;channel audio is impressive, particularly the directional aspect of ambient environmental sounds from ongoing background activities (e. g. aircraft engine sounds) to include tracking of moving sound sources.
I:581;1070;the best years of Howard Hughes' life are covered.
I:581;1071;"It is easy to see, as he futzes with his first movie, ""Hell's Angels"", in the late 20's, that the man is crazy."
I:581;1072;He is also driven, a great pilot and charismatic genius careening towards insanity.
I:581;1073;Hughes was an aviation pioneer first and foremost and usually ahead of the competition, innovation.
I:581;1074;his notoriety catches up with him at the time when he is battling his obsessive.
I:581;1075;DiCaprio, as Hughes gives a tour de force performance destroying the Senator, in the best moments of the movie.
I:581;1076;movies like this are increasingly rare.
I:581;1077;There is star power, a great character driven script, a brillant director and lets not forget plenty of financing all coming together.
I:581;1078;Masterfully directed, intelligently written, beautifully acted, and always engaging, The Aviator is a true Hollywood movie.
I:581;1079;It soars, it entertains, it makes you swoon and cringe, and when all is said and done, you leave the theater feeling like you haven't wasted three hours of your life.
I:581;1080;the life of Howard Hughes was extremely complicated, so Logan and Scorsese wisely concentrate on his early days in Hollywood, his fascination with breaking the air speed record, and finally his desire to take on TWA as the king of the skies.
I:581;1081;hughes had plenty of demons in his life, and one great compatriot in actress Katherine Hepburn, radiantly played by Cate Blanchett.
I:581;1082;A woman of wealth and breeding, Hepburn was also something of a tomboy, and enjoyed the spirited Hughes, even if also meant dealing with his evil spirits.
I:581;1083;I'm not sure how accurate The Aviator depicts their romance, but on screen, played by these actors, there's a real sense of love and friendship.
I:581;1084;the Aviator must have been a dream come true for Scorsese, a movie preservationist whose love of old Hollywood is unabashed.
I:581;1085;Scorsese's love affair carries over onto the screen.
I:581;1086;How marvelous to recreate the classic landmarks, looks, stars, and even tone of the era.
I:581;1087;The Aviator is a real Hollywood movie, larger.
I:581;1088;life in scale, yet grounded by dynamic performances and meaningful dialogue.
I:581;1089;the filmmakers manage to pack quite a punch into three hours, beginning with Hughes' first foray into Hollywood, the expensive, epic Hells Angels, and ending with the only flight of his expensive floating boat eventually nicknamed The Spruce Goose.
I:581;1090;Every conversation, event, specifically chosen and penned by Logan to personify Hughes.
I:581;1091;which makes this DiCaprio's bravest performance.
I:581;1092;He exposes the vulnerable boy hiding inside the body of a man.
I:581;1093;i've never seen New York, New York), and he certainly hit a homer with this one.
I:581;1094;The performances are great, but at first Cate Blanchette seems almost to be satirizing Hepburn in her portrayal of the great actress's mannerisms.
I:581;1095;compulsiveness with an intensity that is never caricatured.
I:581;1096;this movie is a treat, definitely worth watching.
I:581;1097;Men with wealth and power could retire to obscurity with it, or, like Howard Hughes, they could pursue lofty goals in a very public way.
I:581;1098;later in his life, Hughes wanted and got seclusion.
I:581;1099;he loved flying, and flying was a public preoccupation of his.
I:581;1100;He also loved women, and that also was a public preoccupation.
I:581;1101;scorcese made better movies than this one, but my hat's off to him anyway.
I:581;1102;so, it was glamorous and inventive and spontaneous.
I:581;1103;You cannot help but think that this could have been the very best movie of the year if Scorcese had done the same.
I:581;1104;"One of Marty's stronger efforts
I:581;1105;A fascinating story exceptionally well.
I:581;1106;ray is loaded with extras, and the transfer is quite clean, probably in the top 20.
I:581;1107;"this is a film i will come back to in a few years (and thankfully its a return to form for scorsese from the abysmal ""gangs of new york""), but for now, it doesnt work in my eyes."
I:581;1108;The Avatior is about Howard Hughes, a sucessful Avatior, Movie producer, and pilot.
I:581;1109;Also He dates Katherine Hepburn, a great actress at the time, and he gets so much into his work that she leaves him.
I:581;1110;He also creates one of the biggest planes in the world, but the government questions him on the money he owned for the creation of some planes that he owned to The said Government.
I:581;1111;martin Scorsase has created yet another masterwork but he is outdone by Leonardo Decaprio's stunning performance, but Martin still deserves a award for his wonderful art direction.
I:581;1112;Cate Blanchett does a good job protraying Katherine Hepburn good, but I felt she over did it a little bit.
I:581;1113;Leo Decaprio, like I said, did a wonderful performance as Howard Hughes, He became Howard.
I:581;1114;The aviation scenes are brillant, and compelling and stunning.
I:581;1115;Also, He gets the very best out of his actors and crew and he has made one of best movies of the past year.
I:581;1116;I thought that this was a great movie, but you can't compare it to his earlier work, but if you put it side to side, it holds its own.
I:581;1117;Cate Blanchett once again gave a wonderful performance!
I:581;1118;may regard as the quintessential American: one who's an enormously successful business entrepreneur, a daring technical innovator, the playboy companion of Hollywood starlets, and crazy as a loon.
I:581;1119;But here, as millionaire aviator Howard Hughes, he excels.
I:581;1120;The film gives a new meaning to hand washing and the recycling of milk bottles.
I:581;1121;I predict an Oscar for her mantelpiece.
I:581;1122;scorsese's use of special FX and sets is impressive, principally the duplication of the interior of Hollywood's famous Coconut Grove nightclub, the flight deck re.
I:581;1123;The ONLY good thing about it are the costumes and set design.
I:581;1124;In The Aviator, Leonardo DiCaprio portrays the young Howard Hughes, one of America's first billionaires.
I:581;1125;in the movie, DiCaprio portrays Hughes perfectly since he is able to play the cocky, Hollywood playboy that Hughes was, and at the same time, he conveys to the audience that Hughes is not stable and falling deeper into insanity.
I:581;1126;Another aspect that I enjoyed was the History Channel documentary on Hughes that adds some new historical information to the film.
I:581;1127;all together, I think this is one of the better movies that have come out in a long time, and despite the length of the movie (170 Minutes), I found the plot intriguing enough that time seemed to fly away.
I:581;1128;Film is great I reccomend Aviator to anyone.
I:581;1129;Grand, expansive, remarkable performances by Leonardo Di Caprio (who knew he could capture the essence of Howard Huges) and Kate Blanchard.
I:581;1130;the first depiction was believable.
I:581;1131;Without that kick start it is interesting to speculate what would have become of HH.
I:581;1132;I love every single aspect of this movie, from Leo's performance and even Blanchett's performance, to the editing and the script.
I:581;1133;I feel it's important for Americans to understand what helped to get us to where we are today as a country.
I:581;1134;Many of the elements that I loved about Seabiscuit (and made Seabiscuit a great movie (5 Stars in my book)are present in this movie.
I:581;1135;This movie was very good.
I:581;1136;It described the pilots life very well, great movie, I would watch it again!
I:581;1137;Portraying the life of a man larger than life is indeed a daunting task, but in this movie Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio succeed admirably.
I:581;1138;Many people today are unaware of the details of Howard Hughes' life and this movie brings a new generation up to speed on the highs and lows of this brilliant man.
I:581;1139;He seemed fascinated with Hollywood movie stars and the depiction of his relationship with Katherine Hepburn (played with uncanny accuracy by Cate Blanchett)is a high point in the film.
I:581;1140;This is a fascinating and well.
I:581;1141;It has a great story line and actors too.
I:581;1142;", right,"" makes a great Hepburn too."
I:581;1143;The first part of the film chronicles Hughes' production of Hell's Angels, the film that took three years and 4 million dollars to produce.
I:581;1144;Leonardo DiCaprio delivers the Oscar worthy performance as Hughes.
I:581;1145;Nothing is good enough for the man who wants perfection.
I:581;1146;He waited 8 months just to have the perfect clouds for the air scene, so that on film the audience could get a feeling of the planes' speed with comparison to the clouds as the background.
I:581;1147;This was the film industry and in many ways it still is.
I:581;1148;The film then turns to Hughes' work with TWA, the air company.
I:581;1149;This man's story has been turned into a major epic study behind his thoughts and dreams.
I:581;1150;aCTING/DIRECTING: Leonardo DiCaprio does a fine job, a mighty fine job indeed.
I:581;1151;The performance is haunting an poweful as the mind of a genius slowly expands to a point where it explodes from so much going on in his life.
I:581;1152;Cate Blanchett is amazing as Katherine Hepburn and John C. Reilly (one of my favorite actors) is perfect as Hughes' business manager.
I:581;1153;Scorsese does an excellent job of creating a world of the past for the viewers.
I:581;1154;His vision of the man is amazing, and very well executed.
I:581;1155;"Scorsese handles these single character studies quite well, especially the types of ""rise and fall""."
I:581;1156;Ray Liotta in Goodfellas, Robert De Niro in Casino and Raging Bull, Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs of New York.
I:581;1157;"All of these are ""rise and fall"" stories, but these are the stories that are so amazing because it is fascinating to see a genius in his field of business reach everything he's ever wanted only to lose it due to his mistakes."
I:581;1158;Howard Hughs is a total inspiration.
I:581;1159;This movie is an absolutely terrible viewing experience.
I:581;1160;This was a good movie.
I:581;1161;it is the life story of an interesting eccentric person.
I:581;1162;There's a lot of rich and tasty stuff in this movie, but like a donut, it has a considerable hole in the middle .
I:581;1163;I suspect that when it came to casting the picture, Mr. DiCaprio's reported interest in Howard Hughes took a back seat to his desire to star in it.
I:581;1164;as well as Scorsese's love for old movies and old Hollywood.
I:581;1165;is what THE AVIATOR, his most recent picture, is all about.
I:581;1166;certainly the first hour of THE AVIATOR (which runs close to 3 hours) shows Scorsese at his most energetic: the period recreations are lovingly detailed and magnificently shot (by Robert Richardson), and the restaging of the aerial dogfight sequence of HELL'S ANGELS is exhilarating.
I:581;1167;And all throughout, you get a sense that Scorsese sees something of himself in Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio), at least in the near.
I:581;1168;fanatical energy and zeal he brings not only to making his films, but in making his airplanes.
I:581;1169;There is a sense throughout parts of THE AVIATOR of personal involvement here that I thought was missing in GANGS OF NEW YORK (2002), and it's that sense that energizes this film, especially in its first hour.
I:581;1170;Which brings me to my one major reservation about this film: as an exploration of Howard Hughes.
I:581;1171;it rarely penetrates below the surface of the alternately charming and megalomaniacal Hughes.
I:581;1172;"We see him accomplish amazing things (and the first flight of his Spruce Goose is an amazing sight in this movie indeed), and we see terrible things happen to him
I:581;1173;And I did enjoy some of the performances, particularly Cate Blanchett's Oscar.
I:581;1174;winning turn as one of Hughes' many loves, Katharine Hepburn.
I:581;1175;"Blanchett doesn't really look like Hepburn, and at times she sounds more like a caricature of the distinctive Hepburn voice than the Real McCoy
I:581;1176;"But DiCaprio does convincingly convey his passion and megalomania
I:581;1177;In spite of its hollow center, THE AVIATOR is a stylish and entertaining epic about director Martin Scorsese's love of Hollywood's golden years.
I:581;1178;Sheer energy level and visual beauty will carry you along its 170.
I:581;1179;Needless to say, this movie is just what I want.
I:581;1180;Leonardo rocks all the way in this movie, as well as Cate.
I:581;1181;No matter how disturbed Howard Hughes was, he was a brilliant man, a genius, with the ability to change the world when it came to aviation.
I:581;1182;I've seen the Spruce Goose, and was completely in awe of that accomplishment or dream of his.
I:581;1183;I love movies based on true stories, especially those of inspiration and achievement beyond the norm.
I:581;1184;Thank Heaven for Hollywood to enlighten the world that dreams can become reality!!
I:581;1185;Disk in great shape, fast delivery.
I:581;1186;this is a very good biography.
I:581;1187;"the movie is called the ""The Aviator"" and it focuses on Hughes growth in the aviation industry."
I:581;1188;the style of the movie is very much like Citizen Kane (voted the best movie of all time).
I:581;1189;Both handle the life of a troubled, but brilliant billioniare.
I:581;1190;this movie is historically inaccurate, and the timelines are off.
I:581;1191;The events were moved around for dramatic effect.
I:581;1192;There are very good extras.
I:581;1193;"There is are two biographies, a ""making of"" feature, and discusssions on Hughes's obsessive compulsion disorder."
I:581;1194;This is one that is worth owning.
I:581;1195;THE AVIATOR is Martin Scorsese's and Leonardo DiCaprio's absolutely gorgeous period piece highlighting the peak of eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes' life through the late 1920s into the late 1940s.
I:581;1196;Still, having purged themselves of the excesses of THE GANGS OF NEW YORK, Scorsese and DiCaprio do a masterful job of capturing the ambience and decadence of Hollywood's golden era.
I:581;1197;hewn Hughes at all (despite the addition of shoe.
I:581;1198;thin moustache), nor is he powerful enough as an actor to carry the role well, but he does touch the essence of the man.
I:581;1199;His World War One flying epic HELL'S ANGELS was the longest, most complex, most expensive film shot circa 1930 (and was totally redone in the middle when Hughes decided to make it a talkie).
I:581;1200;He loved some of Hollywood's most amazing women (among them Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner).
I:581;1201;impressive supporting performances are given by Cate Blanchett (as a surprisingly pompous Katharine Hepburn), Kate Beckinsale (who gained twenty pounds to play the voluptuous Ava Gardner), Alec Baldwin (as Pan Am founder Juan Trippe, Hughes' chief business rival, with whom he maintained a cordial hatred), and Alan Alda (as Senator Owen Brewster).
I:581;1202;day political trends, Alda's Brewster is a pure special.
I:581;1203;A fine film but not a great film.
I:581;1204;THE AVIATOR definitely keeps you involved.
I:581;1205;Here's another Oscar nominee that includes a lot of big stars acting out two.
I:581;1206;the exquisite sets, lighting and production values are what make this film a keeper and entertaining.
I:581;1207;i was very disappointed that director Martin Scorses allowed these fine, wonderful actors .
I:581;1208;the very best part of this flick is a wonderful plane crash over a swanky Los Angeles neighborhood that occurs about two.
I:581;1209;thirds of the way through the film.
I:581;1210;This is a modern work of art and one of the most successful special effect driven events since Tom Hanks flight came apart when he went to that island and lived there alone.
I:581;1211;"that had none of ""The Aviator""'s ambition but had two wonderful performances of people much closer to real life than the cardboard characters projected here."
I:581;1212;It probably would have also worked if Martin Scorsese had put that at the start of the credits (and I think it might have worked), but even at the end it is a nice touch, especially when you think about what point in Hughes' life when Leadbelly would have been singing it.
I:581;1213;That is because this is one of the more restrained depictions of madness we have seen in recent films.
I:581;1214;You can make an argument based on Scorsese's film that at best, this guy's life was a wash.
I:581;1215;although Scorsese once again does a stellar job of catching a by.
I:581;1216;He carries every big scene in the film.
I:581;1217;While Alda is pulling out every mannerism in the book, Baldwin is remarkably understated and equally effective.
I:581;1218;The directing by Scorsese was superb the acting by Dicaprio, Blanchett and Beckinsale was fantastic.
I:581;1219;It sparked an interest in the life of Howard Hughes who was before my time.
I:581;1220;A must see for plane devotees
I:581;1221;Fascinating and entertaining biography of Howard Hughes.
I:581;1222;Its a long movie, but the time goes so fast as it is so interesting.
I:581;1223;Leonardo DiCaprio should win a AA one day as he is a wonderful actor.
I:581;1224;This is a wonderful part for him and you believe he is Howard.
I:581;1225;After all, it won a lot of academy awards.
I:581;1226;It was directed by Martin Scorcese and had lots of star power.
I:581;1227;The trappings for a great film were all there.
I:581;1228;This is the most overrated film of the year.
I:581;1229;And, in spite of it's reputation, I can't really recommend it.
I:581;1230;The story is about Howard Hughes, an aviation genius and pioneer who also suffered from a debilitating mental illness.
I:581;1231;A humorous episode of the Simpsons spoofed Hughes.
I:581;1232;"Mr. Burns, with wild hair and long nails, points a gun at Smithers and orders him to get into a tiny model plane Burns has dubbed the ""Spruce Caboose."""
I:581;1233;"This is a take on Hughes' famous ""Spruce Goose,"" which is featured in the film."
I:581;1234;howard Hughes was born in Texas in 1905.
I:581;1235;hughes loved airplanes and movies.
I:581;1236;Hughes also was a playboy, dating a string of beautiful actresses.
I:581;1237;Katherine Hepburn's (Cate Blanchett) relationship with Hughes is strongly profiled.
I:581;1238;A scene of her family at the dinner table when Hughes meets them is hilarious.
I:581;1239;His performance is so laudable in every way.
I:581;1240;The story of Howard Hughes is a lot more exciting than I expected it to be.
I:581;1241;The film begins with the making of the lavish spectacular 'Hell's Angels' in 1930, and continues through to Hughes's battle to preserve his TWA airline after WW2.
I:581;1242;i took a great dislike to Leonardo di Caprio in 'Titanic' which I absolutely loathed.
I:581;1243;There are excellent supporting performances too, I particularly enjoyed Alan Alda as obnoxious Senator Brewster, and Jude Law is suitably gorgeous and raffish in a cameo performance as Errol Flynn.
I:581;1244;it is diCaprio's film though, and a very good film it is.
I:581;1245;just got done watch the Aviator, and that is one word I can absolutely describe the movie.
I:581;1246;Leo playing Howard, and here I thought he did an amazing job (which he did) in Blood Diamonds, but WOW!!
I:581;1247;The unwilling to give up on his Goal!
I:581;1248;It was a great bargain!!
I:581;1249;I would give this movie 10 stars, 20 stars, no amount of stars would justify how great this movie was overall.
I:581;1250;"I am impressed with the man that is called ""Mr. Howard."""
I:581;1251;The rest of the cast was just as good.
I:581;1252;but Leo, wow, I felt like it was a one man show and it was him trying to let me to get to know who Mr. Howard was.
I:581;1253;Great Job, Leo, might of not won an Oscar, but you definitely deserve an ovation of a great performance!
I:581;1254;The stars just keep popping up in this superbly directed, beautifully shot and extremely well acted bio.
I:581;1255;Leonardo DiCaprio provides an eerily realistic visual similarity to Howard Hughes no doubt enhanced by his stellar portrayal of the lead character.
I:581;1256;The list of actors and actresses just keeps growing as the movie progresses and each one of them steps up to the plate and hit more home.
I:581;1257;"This movie is a ""Must See"" and without a doubt is a welcome ""Blu."
I:581;1258;Get it, watch it, you'll love it !
I:581;1259;pic on one of the most eccentric Americans of the 20th century proves to be quite entertaining and well done.
I:581;1260;Cate Blanchett does a wonderful job as Katharine Hepburn even although the movie does exaggerated their relationship.
I:581;1261;Kate Beckinsale played Ava Gardner who also does a pretty good job.
I:581;1262;Leonardo DiCaprio may not looked like Howard Hughes but he does managed to capture Hughes' aviation spirit and his insane genius.
I:581;1263;but overall, this proves to be a well acted, well directed and well written movie.
I:581;1264;Much of this credit goes to the director, Martin Scorsese who have proven once more that he haven't lost all his touches yet.
I:581;1265;DiCaprio proves to be quite good and he was well supported by his fellow cast members.
I:581;1266;Recieved on time and brand new
I:581;1267;Martin Scorcese's another successful movie, this one is the story of the legendary director and aviator Howard Hughes' career, from the late 1920's to the mid.1940's.
I:581;1268;My husband and I liked this movie .
I:581;1269;"that ""some woman"" was Cate Blanchett who is one of today's finest actors and who received an Academy Award for her fantastic portrayal of Katherine Hepburn ."
I:581;1270;This movie was beautifully directed.
I:581;1271;I thought this snapshot of his life was fascinating.
I:581;1272;I am not a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio but thought his performance was marvelous.
I:581;1273;Hughes was a visionary, a perfectionist, certainly eccentric .
I:581;1274;and did have an extraordinary impact on the aviation industry.
I:581;1275;Great movie and I barely noticed the 3 hours as it passed.
I:581;1276;The price was awesome for what I got.
I:581;1277;We added this movie to our family collection.
I:581;1278;we enjoyed this film on the Big screen and now we can enjoy it at home.
I:581;1279;up between Hughes and Kate that held my interest.
I:581;1280;"very well acted, and packed with great talent, the movie touches it all: his titanic contributions to aviation and moviemaking
I:581;1281;The actor took it upon himself to dig deep into the life of the character, and brought to the screen a fantastically close depiction of his traits, fears and overall personality.
I:581;1282;Anyone that is a fan watch this movie.
I:581;1283;I ordered this movie because it had Allan Alda in it , I had very little idea as to what the full story was about , and I found myself surprised.
I:581;1284;overall good experience in every way!
I:581;1285;Probably the best parts of the movie are the portrayals of historical figures.
I:581;1286;Kate Blanchett is a great Kate Hepburn.
I:581;1287;Director Martin Scorcese presents the life of Texan billionaire Howard Hughes, played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
I:581;1288;in between these two events, Hughes courted some of the most beautiful women in Hollywood (at times, seemingly, all of the most beautiful women in Hollywood), flirts with fianncial ruin, battles the insurmountable combination of big corporate rivals and government, and, most intriguingly, fights a losing battle with an increasingly severe case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.
I:581;1289;scorcese uses plenty of gimmicks and conventional techniques to bring his vision to the screen, including having each section of the film appear as if it had been shot in the year that it portrays.
I:581;1290;scorcese and DiCaprio work overtime in this film, and they succeed in brining a multi.
I:581;1291;dimensional portrait of this complicated and tortured individual to life.
I:581;1292;The great contradiction of this character is that his wealth gives him power beyond imagining, power which allows him to indulge the most expensive and trifling of whims.
I:581;1293;He rules a magnificent financial empire, but crumbles when confronted with a rare steak, or an over.
I:581;1294;Tellingly, he is most able to push his demons aside when put in a crisis situation, and he rises to the occasion when forced to appear before a congressional committee.
I:581;1295;This is a good, solid movie, but it stands out only because the bar is set so low.
I:581;1296;The Aviator is a brilliant film with great acting!
I:581;1297;The other actors shine, too.
I:581;1298;"The special effects like what we see in the airplane crash are outstanding
I:581;1299;"The cinematography reflects a great deal of forethought
I:581;1300;this got the film an Oscar for Best Cinematography!
I:581;1301;"Indeed, there's little lacking in this movie
I:581;1302;forwards to 1927 as Hughes struggles to create what he hopes will be an incredibly fantastic motion picture, Hell's Angels.
I:581;1303;Howard hires his right hand man Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly) to manage his funds and operate his business on a day.
I:581;1304;but not before Hughes makes the film as realistic as possible by hiring scores of extras some of whom pilot made.
I:581;1305;"I really liked the History Channel documentary on Howard Hughes
I:581;1306;The Aviator is a marvelous and amazing movie.
I:581;1307;It's long at nearly three hours but is so well crafted that the time zips by.
I:581;1308;It's both a biography and a fantasy because much of its subject matter revolves around Hollywood in the 1930s and because its protagonist, Howard Hughes, was even larger than the larger than life stars he mingled with.
I:581;1309;leonardo DiCaprio plays Hughes, the incredibly rich heir to a Texas fortune.
I:581;1310;Brash, young and emotionally unstable, he headed to Hollywood determined to make movies.
I:581;1311;the fascinating thing about Hughes was that, while he was an intelligent and handsome man, he was bedeviled by madness.
I:581;1312;He rivals Johnny Depp as a physical actor.
I:581;1313;Kate Blanchett both is and isn't Hepburn, perhaps the most unique star of all time, but her portrayal is superb.
I:581;1314;The Aviator captures a period of American history in an extraordinary way.
I:581;1315;I DO NOT know how accurate this movie is,but it was really interesting at best.
I:581;1316;Growing up in Los Angeles during the later era of Howard Hughes life I have always found him a fascinating persona.
I:581;1317;DiCaprio's portraial of this man as he begins to slip into insanity was very good.
I:581;1318;It represents only a small part of Hughes life, so I was kept waiting for other things I knew happened to show up.
I:581;1319;The movie was very slow in the beginning and tried to put too much of a broad life into a short story, but overall it was a good watch.
I:581;1320;"Martin Scorsese delivers his best film since ""Casino"" (my personal favorite of his many great films next to King Of Comedy and Goodfellas)with this tremendously entertaining and dramatically effective biopic about ""aviator"", filmmaker, businessman Howard Hughes."
I:581;1321;If there is one problem with this film (and this is the sort of problem most films should have) is that I wish it could have been even longer and gone even further ahead into Hughes' fascinating life.
I:581;1322;The film in many ways shows us all how one man can be a visionary and at the same time completely vulnerable and fallible all at the same time.
I:581;1323;In many ways the message of this film is weakness can exist among geniuses.
I:581;1324;Leonardo Dicaprio gives the best performance I have seen to date from him in this film and Robert Richardson's breathtaking cinematography soars to new heights.
I:581;1325;I also admired many of the supporting performances from the rest of the uniformly excellent cast (i. e. Ian Holm, John C. Reilly, Cate Blanchette, Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda).
I:581;1326;There are also sequences in this film among the best I have ever seen (i. e. Beverly Hills plane crash, door knob, projection room).
I:581;1327;I was one of the few people who loved Gangs Of New York and it is nice to see Scorsese back at the top of his game again.
I:581;1328;Steven Spielberg/Woody Allen you need pay attention and take note.
I:581;1329;I think that movie is really good.
I:581;1330;Leonardo DiCaprio is giving a brilliant performance.
I:581;1331;I hope Leo, Cate and the movie will win at the Oscar.
I:581;1332;"Martin Scorsese has wisely telescoped the sprawling life of Howard Hughes into approximately 20 years in his handsomely mounted, ""The Aviator,"" probably because of a couple of things: one, it was the most creative period in Hughes' life and two, it was the twenty years in which Hughes descended little by little into madness."
I:581;1333;"Why this is I am not sure, for if you look at the body of his work, including ""Titanic"" in which he was at the very least a charming performer, he has done some excellent work: ""Gilbert Grape,"" ""A Boy's Life"" and ""Basketball Diaries"" to name several."
I:581;1334;but it will be Howard Hughes that will become Di Caprio's signature role in this, what you might call, the middle period of his career.
I:581;1335;His performance as Hughes is driven, attractive, charismatic: so much of what Di Caprio does with this character he does with his expressive face and eyes.
I:581;1336;Note the look in his besotted eyes when he first sees Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett, spot.
I:581;1337;on perfect) and the body language when she dumps him.
I:581;1338;di Caprio knows when to hold back, he knows how to listen, and he knows how to use his face in close.
I:581;1339;and when the periods of insanity overtake him, it looks and feels scary and genuine because it comes from deep inside him.
I:581;1340;This is by no means a surface performance: Di Caprio has put his heart and his soul into understanding Hughes.
I:581;1341;"the physical production of ""The Aviator"" is gorgeous and Scorsese has decided to film most of the film in saturated 40's style Technicolor."
I:581;1342;There's a star studded array of cast here and their all perfect even if some of them dont get that much screen time.
I:581;1343;It's a long movie, yes but I really liked this movie a lot and it gives DiCaprio one of his best performances so far.
I:581;1344;The crash scene where Hughes gets injured crashing into the buildings just shows how good DiCaprio is.
I:581;1345;It's a big, epic, sumptuously filmed spectacle that maintained my interest.
I:581;1346;Scorcese smartly focuses on a definite time period in Hughes' life, and although the movie's ending seems empty and unfulfilled, the nearly three hour film is still packed with enough pathos and style to earn its critical kudos and its five Oscars.
I:581;1347;"cate Blanchett who won a supporting actress Oscar wisely chooses not to ""imitate"" the legendary Katherine Hepburn, but using mannerisms and voice inflections, she brings us a startingly realistic portrait of this venerated star."
I:581;1348;Leo does incredibly well overall, but there were times when I found him to be posturing rather than acting, and while impressed with his performance, a stronger actor may have made Howard a little more empathic.
I:581;1349;"The rest of the cast is excellent: Alan Alda in his Oscar nominated role as Senator Bennett is brilliant
I:581;1350;Beckinsale certainly has the physical voluptuousness of Gardne, but her performance was merely eye candy with little depth.
I:581;1351;making including its soaring score by Oscar winner Howard Shore, the cinematography, sets, and costumes.
I:581;1352;THE AVIATOR is a good representation of both Scorcese's prowess and epic Hollywood film making.
I:581;1353;Having said all that, there's some good stuff in this film.
I:581;1354;grown as a genius engineer and film.
I:581;1355;The flying sequences are interesting and the crash.
I:581;1356;diCaprio isn't one of my favorite actors but he did a superb job portraying Howard Hughs.
I:581;1357;One of aviation's unsung heroes, most people think Howard Hughs as the long haired semi.
I:581;1358;Yet Hughs is one of the top aviation pioneers of the beginning time.
I:581;1359;Yet Howard Hughs the man was very very real and very very human.
I:581;1360;"Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator"" is a look at about two decades in the life of millionaire Howard Hughes (DiCaprio)."
I:581;1361;The Aviator is an unflinching look at Howard Hughes' life.
I:581;1362;The highs and the lows are portrayed equally, showing him to be an intelligent and driven man with a debilitating sickness.
I:581;1363;Cate Blanchett is excellent as Hepburn, and supporting roles by Reilly, Baldwin, and Alda hold the film together.
I:581;1364;The Aviator, once again starring heart.
I:581;1365;throb Leonardo DiCaprio, may at last be the picture that scores Scorsese that ever elusive award statuette with critics abound applauding it and audiences flocking consistently w weekend in and weekend out to see it.
I:581;1366;Moving to the state of California, Hughes set up shop as a hot.
I:581;1367;Also during this time, Hughes, a dashing young billionaire and the toast of tinsel town, romanced many of the most dazzling starlets of the era including Katherine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, Jean Harlow, and Faith Domergue.
I:581;1368;In spite of its lavish three.
I:581;1369;howard Hughes, whether he be the man, the legend, or quite possibly a combination of the two, truly is the focus of this picture and Leonardo DiCaprio, having been snubbed in years past for his roles in both Titanic and Gangs of New York, captures brilliantly the eccentric aviator's maverick personality and from the very first scenes instantly grapples the attention of his audience in much the same way as Hughes would have wanted it done.
I:581;1370;hit Titanic, has built up quite an impressive resume none.
I:581;1371;Cate Blanchett, an especially gifted actress who has rounded up in recent years particularly well.
I:581;1372;deserved acclaim from critics for her roles in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Veronica Guerin, reflects perfectly the extraordinary, if not often curious, nature of the late.
I:581;1373;balance personality to the divergent Howard Hughes.
I:581;1374;this year, gives a decent portrayal of Errol Flynn but one wonders why he is even in the film seeing as how he does little in the direct effect of Hughes' life or legend.
I:581;1375;This changes dramatically when later in the film she returns to see Howard in his retched condition alone in his office and cleans him up for his appearance in front of Brewster's public committee hearing, giving the sense as though she were mothering him a bit.
I:581;1376;True to form, the life of Howard Hughes' was never the same again from that moment on.
I:581;1377;picture no one wanted to release, wooed the finest women in Hollywood, and built and flew the largest plane in the world when no one believed it would even get a foot off the ground.
I:581;1378;That, ladies and gentlemen, is truly the disheartening conclusion to the eccentric, yet majestic, life of Mr. Howard Hughes.
I:581;1379;Scorsese, a man always willing to be daring and take a risk when it comes to the exact look and feel of a particular film, brilliantly .
I:581;1380;captures in each year that is represented the accurate visual style of the color film of that time period, whether it was the old.
I:581;1381;"Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator"" is a big film in both conception and achievement."
I:581;1382;It's easy to understand why Scorsese, a director naturally drawn to outsize, outwardly impractical projects, was drawn to the story of Howard Hughes, a man who went for broke in everything he did.
I:581;1383;Scorsese obviously senses a kindred spirit in the obsessive, visionary Hughes, and he responds with a cinematic extravaganza that Hughes surely would appreciate, even if the warts.
I:581;1384;with the help of his regular collaborators, cinematographer Robert Richardson and film editor Thelma Schoonmaker.
I:581;1385;creates an amazing tribute to Hughes, including some of the most amazing aviation scenes ever put on film.
I:581;1386;(A plane crash sequence may be the most harrowing of its kind in cinematic history.
I:581;1387;As always, Scorsese gets amazing performances from his cast, beginning with the great (yes, the GREAT) Leonardo DiCaprio as Hughes.
I:581;1388;DiCaprio expertly captures the contradictory, often downright weird behavior patterns of Hughes, giving us the portrait of a whole man who is far more admirable and sympathetic than not.

I:581;1392;dimensional performance rather than a mere impersonation.
I:581;1393;There's also a fine supporting performance by Alan Alda as an oily senator who shills for Hughes's enemies in the aviation business.
I:581;1394;But as a tribute to one great American dreamer by another, it is a consistently impressive and entertaining film.
I:581;1395;pure technique, However Beckinsale as Ava and the kid as Domerque are worth watching .

I:581;1398;millionaire industrialist Howard Hughes, whose innovation and willingness to spend his considerable fortune on his passions changed the film and aviation industries in the United States.
I:581;1399;The Aviator captured 4 Academy Awards in 2005 and was nominated for about 100 awards by critical, professional, and other organizations in the US and the UK.
I:581;1400;Director Martin Scorsese has translated the most productive years in Hughes' life into a visual and dramatic tour de force, beginning as Hughes takes Hollywood by storm in 1927 and ending shortly after his victory over Senator Ralph Owen Brewster in securing international flight rights for TWA in 1947.
I:581;1401;"Hughes went on to make a couple of other notable films and to head RKO Studios, but ""The Aviator"" focuses on Hughes' aeronautical achievements more than his Hollywood career."

I:581;1409;It's an entertaining epic of a larger.
I:581;1410;"A true masterpiece of our time and an instant classic for Scorsese fans as well as lovers of all great cinema, The Aviator delivers on every level
I:581;1411;This is a modern day Citizen Kane, with top notch acting from both leading actors, Cate Blanchett, with her inspired portrayal of Katharine Hepburn, as well as the incredibly talented and compelling DiCaprio who, with this role, graduates from mere movie star to bona.
I:581;1412;i had to see this film since Howard Hughes is one of the Most compelling people to ever grace the planet.
I:581;1413;And after experiencing a plane crash so disturbingly jarring, a self.
I:581;1414;The AVIATOR for me was a load of fun.
I:581;1415;As someone born in the 50s this movie shows how much fun it must have been to live in the first half of the 20th century and have money.
I:581;1416;DiCaprio does a fine job portraying Howard HUGHES, a true visionary who was afflicted with mental illnesses that, at the time, were never publicly discussed.
I:581;1417;cate Blanchett does a fine job in her portrayal of Katherine HEPBURN who had a love affair with HUGHES'S before she met Spencer TRACY.
I:581;1418;The movie is nothing to speak of as a great thought provoking experience.
I:581;1419;a very entertaining look at Mr. HUGHES life (with some very fine flying sequences thrown in).
I:581;1420;"Representing a quantum leap in the cinematic relationship between director Martn Scorcese and Leonardo Dicaprio, ""The Aviator"" flies on an astounding central performance and Scorcese's visual prowess."
I:581;1421;But his portrayal of the ambitious but deeply troubled Howard Hughes is a revelation, as Dicaprio finally grows up into mature actor.
I:581;1422;Scorcese masterfully pulls great work not only from Dicaprio, but from his stellar ensemble cast.
I:581;1423;Cate Blanchett rocks the screen as an uncanny Katherine Hepburn and Alec Balwin and Alan Alda are a couple of excellent sleazeballs, a airline mogul and senator repectively.
I:581;1424;The filming of the movie provides us with a hint of what Scorcese has done with the films' flying scenes which are incredible, aided by the bracing cinematography of Robert Richardson (Kill Bill, Platoon) and the sure handed editing of Thelma Schoonmaker (Raging Bull, Gangs of New York).
I:581;1425;Hughes is shown here as the ambitious and driven golden boy he was, throwing Hollywood one hit after another while building an airline empire with TWA and bedding some of the most beautiful women of the time.
I:581;1426;Many aspects of this film maybe grandiose, but Scorcese proves that he still knows how to explore the dark side of humanity via all too vulnerable male leads.
I:581;1427;But if you give the film a chance, it will stick with you.
I:581;1428;Scorcese still has it, and now, so does Dicaprio.
I:581;1429;But most of all, it is about him as the high.
I:581;1430;breaking, inventive, and feisty genius of aviation.
I:581;1431;however, you will see a lovely representation of the Hollywood of the decades above.
I:581;1432;Cate Blanchett, as Katherine Hepburn, one of Hughes many mistresses, is brilliant.
I:581;1433;range, though, is Leo di Caprio's very good performance of Howard Hughes.
I:581;1434;neglect at some point) and the way Hughes pulls himself together for the above mentioned hearings when it comes to his biggest passion, the aviation.
I:581;1435;it will be interesting to see if this one will earn him an Academy Award (I actually forgave him to put himself a little bit too much into the limelight as one of the producers of the movie).
I:581;1436;Go and see for yourselves.
I:581;1437;I thought I would like it.
I:581;1438;The topic seems interesting enough.
I:581;1439;com review and it will explain this to you and why Scorsese did the color this way.
I:581;1440;But after seeing this film I really feel I know the guy.
I:581;1441;All the supporting actors are great as well, with Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn really standing out by copying her voice and body movements perfectly.
I:581;1442;The Aviator is worth owning and it stands proud beside my copies of Raging Bull and Goodfellas.
I:581;1443;All of the reviews are very good on here, but I have to be honest, this is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all.
I:581;1444;I will be reviewing the 2.
I:581;1445;the movie itself is wonderful in showing us a GOOD version of the howard hughes story.
I:581;1446;They go over many historical events and seem to hit many of the good ones.
I:581;1447;But leonardo's portrayal is magnificent.
I:581;1448;Not only is he perfect for the young free spending howard, but also for the older role.
I:581;1449;There is a wonderful part in the movie that is showing you just how crazy this guy is.
I:581;1450;I thought it was a great part, but the commentary gives you great insight of how he was supposed to be seeing himself years from now all dirty and stuff.
I:581;1451;It doesn't make the movie any better, but it is always good to have an understanding.
I:581;1452;So it would take to long to go over this long ass movie, but it is awesome and I have to say that the court scene is definitely one of my favorite scenes in cinema history.
I:581;1453;and all of the interviews and documentaries are well worth watching.
I:581;1454;There is also a lot of stuff on the miniatures and how they got the action scenes to screen.
I:581;1455;I guess the movie would be more interesting with more familiarity with the enigmatic Hughes and his life.
I:581;1456;Di Caprio put on a stellar performance in what must have been a singularly demanding and difficult role.
I:581;1457;This has been the best I have seen from Di Caprio, and he deserves all accolades for it.
I:581;1458;secondly, the visual presentation and photography were excellent.
I:581;1459;The attention to detail was excellent, which helped carry the viewer into the story and the time.
I:581;1460;It has to be emphasised that some of the aircraft scenes were the best in the movie, so this comment is really a quibble of mine.
I:581;1461;Both put in great performances and were brilliant in their supporting roles.
I:581;1462;For any Di Caprio fans, Di Caprio's acting makes enduring the movie almost worth it.
I:581;1463;I bought this movie before I saw it, and when I saw it I was so glad that I owned it.
I:581;1464;I really think Leonardo DiCaprio did a great job as Howard Hughes.
I:581;1465;But I thought DiCaprio's portrayal of him was wonderful.
I:581;1466;Cate Blanchett did a great job as well.
I:581;1467;this film has history of the aviation industry, a look at an amazing hollywood era and an insight into a disease of the mind and how it affects people.
I:581;1468;Howard Hughes was an amazing man whose ambition, energy and courage managed to rise above his illness to achieve many things in his life.
I:581;1469;although it is a fairly long film and there was times when I wondered would it ever end, I still enjoyed it.
I:581;1470;I do recomend this film.
I:581;1471;It is an entertaining, enlightening film with very good acting.
I:581;1472;i found this film, as a whole, weird.
I:581;1473;This movie is well made and directed well it should be it sure cost a lot to make but it is rather dull.
I:581;1474;Thankfully the Oscars came to there senses and this movie did not win best picture or director, just becasue scoresse is a great director that has not won before that does not mean he deserves it for this movie which is probably one of his worst.
I:581;1475;And by the way Millon Dollar baby deserved to win best picture it is very moveing and well acted and made and stays with you long after you seen it i cant say that to this movie.
I:581;1476;Leonardo Di Caprio is spellbinding as Howard Hughes.
I:581;1477;Enjoyed it thoroughly one of my all time favorite movies.
I:581;1478;cate Blanchett does a turn as his lover Katherine Hepburn that is fascinating in its quirkiness and the always lovely Kate Bekinsale plays the spitfire Ava Gardner
I:581;1479;martin Scorcese is an interesting filmmaker.
I:581;1480;I would love to rave at his brilliance, but I have always found his movies since the late 80's to be stilted, stylized and extremely violent.Yet, I loved Gangs of New York .
I:581;1481;The Age of Innocence is simply a lovely and very good movie.
I:581;1482;my other peeve with this movie is the subtle portrayal and foreshadowing of Hughes upcoming mental breakdown .
I:581;1483;paralyzed by madness one moment, and Hyde in another moment fighting for his business interests or whatever else without any hint of real madness.
I:581;1484;in short, this movie is worth seeing on several levels.
I:581;1485;For a real descent into weirdness, may I recommend this movie and Howard and Me?
I:581;1486;I still laugh at the weirdness possible .
I:581;1487;How about an open bottle of milk?Frankly, the movie made me curious about the real Hughes.
I:581;1488;Martin Scorsese's sweeping and epic portrait of Howard Hughes gives the legendary aviator and movie mogul the class and respect he deserves, beginning with the surprisingly perfect casting of Leonardo DiCaprio.
I:581;1489;Those who believed DiCaprio was miscast in Scorsese's previous Gangs of New York will be marvelled as he gives the best performance of his career here.
I:581;1490;Focusing on the most prolific period of Hughes' life, we see Hughes as the glamorous playboy and rich movie producer, but he is shown first and foremost as a brilliant aviator whose aeronautical advances bring both praise and ridicule.
I:581;1491;John Logan's script is respectful, focusing on this period of Hughes' life and ending before his life took a final downward spiral, and the casting for the most part is superb.
I:581;1492;Cate Blanchett shines in her Oscar winning role as Katherine Hepburn, while Kate Beckinsale is miscast as Ava Gardner.
I:581;1493;The rest of the cast, including Oscar nominee Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, and Di Caprio's fellow Gangs of New York alumni John C. Reilly, do teriffic work.
I:581;1494;As a whole, the Aviator is a big budget Scorsese masterpiece that ranks up there with the director's other modern day classics, and like Hughes himself, DiCaprio and co. soar high.
I:581;1495;The film has its moments though.
I:581;1496;particularly EVERY SCENE with Cate Blanchett as the Academy's favorite actress Katherine Hepburn.
I:581;1497;She is simply great and marvelous in her role, well deserving of her Oscar win.
I:581;1498;The other scenes I liked were the flying sequences and the Senate hearings when Howard Hughes manages to overcome his eccentric phobias to defend his name and turn the tables on a very corrupt Senator, played impressively by Alan Alda.
I:581;1499;That's about it, as far as what I liked in this movie.
I:581;1500;on one positive, yet unintentionally ironic note.
I:581;1501;i thought it was interesting that Leonardo DiCaprio played Howard Hughes, who helped TWA become a major competing airline to Pan Am.
I:581;1502;all you'll get is a lot of turbulence with only a few scenes that are truly worth seeing.
I:581;1503;She makes this film worth seeing.
I:581;1504;I hope she'll play the role again if Hollywood decides to make a bio.
I:581;1505;Leonardo DiCaprio did a great job playing Howard Hughes.
I:581;1506;she was OUTSTANDING as Katherine Hepburn, Howard's favorite love interest.
I:581;1507;She truly deserved the Oscar she won last year for Best Supporting Actress.
I:581;1508;Other than that it was a movie that is definitely worth seeing.
I:581;1509;While I wouldn't call The Aviator one of my favorite movies, I did enjoy it.
I:581;1510;Of course, the stand out of the cast was Leonardo DiCaprio, who did a wonderful job portraying legendary millionaire, filmmaker, and aviator Howard Hughes.
I:581;1511;The film focuses on Hughes' early life, when he filmed Hell's Angels and The Outlaw.
I:581;1512;The film also pays some lip service to Hughes' work in the field of aviation, his endless quest for bigger, better planes, and congressional committee hearings that kept Pan Am from being named America's only international air carrier.
I:581;1513;i am a huge fan of Katherine Hepburn, and Cate Blanchette, while she certainly doesn't look the part, did seem to capture her personality and way of speaking.
I:581;1514;The relationship between Hughes and Hepburn was a central one in the film, and Blanchette and DiCaprio played it with warmth and tenderness.
I:581;1515;For their performances alone, this film is worth watching.
I:581;1516;overall, I think this is a period piece, and Scorcese and his team did a deft job of capturing the period with costumes, sets, props, and styling.
I:581;1517;Though a pretty long movie, fun casting surprises (Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow, Jude Law as Errol Flynn, and Alec Baldwin as Juan Tripp, Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner) keep it interesting.
I:581;1518;Dicaprio and Scorsese's last pairing Gangs of New York was a disaster so this one seems excellent by comparison.
I:581;1519;This is the first Scorses film I've actually enjoyed.
I:581;1520;Anyway, Leo shows he still has great acting chops (Basketball Diaries, Gilbert Grape) and let's not forget the wonderful Cate Blanchet.
I:581;1521;But it is a big story, great vision, and it was well executed.
I:581;1522;Scorsese's best film was LAST TEMPTATION, and nearly everything else that doesn't have Robert DeNiro in it stinks.
I:581;1523;how good could it ever hope to be?
I:581;1524;Oh yeah, then some scenes about him inventing some pretty important airplane ideas.
I:581;1525;Really, Mr. Scorsese, a nice little title on the screen of what year it is will suffice.
I:581;1526;It is generally entertaining fared much better at the box office than expected.
I:581;1527;there are a number of flying scenes and two are very good, the night landing on a golf course and the take.
I:581;1528;the film has one great performance, Cate Blanchette channels the vocal patterns and mannerisms of Katherine Hepburn, her scenes are the highlights of the film and fortunately she has a lot of scenes.
I:581;1529;It took a lot of courage for Scorsese to not just structure the film around someone as familiar as Hepburn but to have her character played in a manner where she was recognizable to her fans.
I:581;1530;alan Alda does great as a slimy senator.
I:581;1531;Adam Baldwin is slick as the strangely likable Pan Am President.
I:581;1532;Josie Moran, Kelli Garner and the other Kate (Beckinsale) are dazzling decoration, and Ian Holm provides comic relief.
I:581;1533;DiCaprio is right at home in this era.
I:581;1534;"He shines most as the sick Hughes in scenes on par with Russell Crowe in ""A Beautiful Mind."""
I:581;1535;With the exception of Cate Blanchett (as Katherine Hepburn)and some of the spectacular flying scenes, I found this film over.
I:581;1536;(ok, it won 5 oscars but the only one that really mattered was the best supporting actress one).
I:581;1537;If you like watching paint dry, you will love this movie.
I:581;1538;A wonderful movie of a genius that lost his mine over time sadly.
I:581;1539;I love this movie and I was looking forward to owning it.
I:581;1540;Sure, Gangs looked stunning and housed a handful of excellent performances, but let's be honest: there's no way it's bound to be remembered as one of the filmmaker's finest efforts.
I:581;1541;which is why I believe that Scorsese's follow.
I:581;1542;"Yes, it's an extremely good film
I:581;1543;"But it's just not excellent, and when you're talking about one of the planet's finest living filmmakers, ""excellent"" is what you've come to expect."
I:581;1544;Were this film directed by the Martin Scorsese of twenty years ago, an astute and hard.
I:581;1545;"nosed producer would have taken Marty aside and said, ""Wow, there's a great movie in this 170 minutes."
I:581;1546;And that's the last time I'll mention it, because literally everything else about The Aviator is bathed in high.
I:581;1547;"He'd work alongside the U. s. government when a new style of spy plane was needed
I:581;1548;Clearly this is a man who was a slave to his passions, and it's a good thing for Mr. Hughes that he was born into a family with such a hefty bankroll.
I:581;1549;all of it makes for perfect movie material, and Scorsese brings the Golden Age of Hollywood to life like few other filmmakers have ever done.
I:581;1550;Further, I'd happily go on record as saying that The Aviator boasts some of the most exciting aerial footage ever filmed.
I:581;1551;As Hughes, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers one of his very best performances to date.
I:581;1552;And this is a guy who did some truly superlative work in films like What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Catch Me If You Can .
I:581;1553;Cate Blanchett took home a well.
I:581;1554;"deserved Oscar for her addictively entertaining portrayal of Katherine Hepburn, while the background of The Aviator is absolutely swollen with stellar supporting performances
I:581;1555;Solid actors working at the very top of their game, and again, this is the kind of thing that happens when Martin Scorsese is involved.
I:581;1556;(Even the generally miscast Kate Beckinsale proves herself worthy of inclusion in this cast.
I:581;1557;She's astonishingly easy on the eyes, and she can actually act!
I:581;1558;What is presented in The Aviator is more than entertaining and engrossing enough to keep you interested .
I:581;1559;But hey, with this sort of beautiful production design, compelling dialogue, and pitch.
I:581;1560;perfect acting performances on display, one can forgive the movie for overstaying its welcome by a half hour or so.
I:581;1561;And it's most definitely a big step up from Gangs of New York, which means that Mr. Scorsese's next film should be staggeringly, outrageously, and stunningly great.
I:581;1562;Whether you're looking at huge, swooping airplanes, lush and luxurious penthouses, or the deep shocking blue of Kate Beckinsale's eyes, well, the flick looks just beautiful.
I:581;1563;audio: Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, and you'll notice it most during the first.
I:581;1564;And I dare you to crank it up when Hughes crash.
I:581;1565;Also included is a French 2.0 track, as well as optional subtitles in English, French and Spanish.
I:581;1566;extrasDisc 1 offers an audio commentary with director Martin Scorsese, editor Thelma Schoonmaker, and producer Michael Mann.
I:581;1567;smart uncle who knows everything about movies, and his commentaries are just a delight for a movie geek like me.
I:581;1568;The editor and the producer share some insightful comments as well, combining for a nearly three.
I:581;1569;track that's as enlightening as it is informative.
I:581;1570;disc 2 is where you'll find the rest of the goodies, and the platter is fairly stocked with supplemental splendor.
I:581;1571;This is a clever little scene that got cut for no good reason that I can ascertain.
I:581;1572;Director Martin Scorsese, screenwriter John Logan, producer Graham King, and actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, Gwen Stefani, John C. Reilly and Alan Alda all get their chance to throw some love and sunshine towards the film and its (justifiably) lauded director.

I:581;1575;life perspective on Howard Hughes.
I:581;1576;If you've ever seen any episodes from the History Channel's Modern Marvels series, you know you're in for a presentation as educational as it is entertaining.
I:581;1577;And such is clearly the case here.
I:581;1578;Either way, it's a fantastic inclusion to this 2.
I:581;1579;ized story via the main feature, and a whole lot more of the factual nitty.
I:581;1580;The audio is a bit tinny here (and there are no English subtitles for this featurette), but it's still compelling enough to warrant a look.
I:581;1581;David Schwartz (no relation to the doctor) moderates an entertaining Q session with Leo and Hawkeye.
I:581;1582;screening Q at a film festival will find this featurette enjoyably familiar.
I:581;1583;Visual Effects Supervisor / Second Unit Director Robert Legato gives us the scoop on the film's rather impressive special effects.
I:581;1584;Particularly fantastic is the segment on how the Hell's Angels footage was reproduced.
I:581;1585;Producer Graham King and production designer (extraordinaire) Dante Ferretti discuss the massive task of bringing Golden Age Hollywood to cinematic life.
I:581;1586;And what a lot of work it was!
I:581;1587;Chief makeup artist Morag Ross and head hair stylist Kathryn Blondell share their experiences on (and affection for) this particular project.
I:581;1588;Slight, but still pretty cool.
I:581;1589;final ThoughtsThe Aviator is like a huge, delicious pizza that's just way too big for its own good.
I:581;1590;You can stick the extra pizza slices in to the fridge for later consumption, but a movie should be enjoyed all in one sitting.
I:581;1591;But here, I'm happy to say that it was justified.
I:581;1592;This is a superb movie, beautiful in so many levels.
I:581;1593;She creates horror stories about diseases and plagues surrounding the world today and immediately, we get a sense of where this movie is heading.
I:581;1594;That sets the tone for the whole movie and we then see the life of Howard Hughes unfold, and guess what.
I:581;1595;it's a thrilling ride full of awe and excitement.
I:581;1596;What happens when his Obsessive Compulsive Disorder kicks in, and how it affects his life.
I:581;1597;what keeps the movie afloat is the story of Howard Hughes himself, and the fantastic performances from everyone in this movie.
I:581;1598;Howard Hughes' life was every guy's dream.
I:581;1599;The rise to power, the ability to achieve greatness.
I:581;1600;The underdog that defies all odds.
I:581;1601;In the more than capable hands of Martin Scorsese, the story comes alive.
I:581;1602;The era of the late 20's to the 40's is represented very well.
I:581;1603;There is so much life and color to this movie, it amazes me everytime I watch it.
I:581;1604;Strengthening the movie are also breath.
I:581;1605;taking special effects and Howard Shore's sweeping score.
I:581;1606;the stellar cast of The Aviator is led by Leonardo DiCaprio.
I:581;1607;there remains one undeniable fact, he delivers a magnificent performance in this movie.
I:581;1608;Although I hated him in Titanic, DiCaprio has really impressed me lately, giving really good performances in 2 of my all time favorite movies, Catch Me If You Can and Gangs Of New York.
I:581;1609;Something I've always respected about him is that, while actors his age are doing romantic comedies, no.
I:581;1610;He's lucky to have worked with amazing people like Spielberg and Scorsese and he shows no signs of slowing down.
I:581;1611;Playing Howard Hughes, his acting would eventually make or break this movie, but fortunately everything comes together brilliantly.
I:581;1612;I believe this to be his best performance yet.
I:581;1613;They say that there's a fine line separating genius from insanity, and Howard Hughes is the perfect example.
I:581;1614;Watch the movie, and you'll understand.
I:581;1615;each of them delivers memorable performances.
I:581;1616;ultimately, to me, everything in this movie comes together in perfect unity, thus the 5.
I:581;1617;Kudos to everyone involved in The Aviator.
I:581;1618;Saw it in the theater and loved it.
I:581;1619;leonardo di Caprio makes a good fist of the title role assisted by a strong support cast and director Martin Scorsese pulls out every trick in the cinematic book (lighting, sound, editing, special effects) to tell this amazing story.
I:581;1620;suffers a few lulls in the latter half when exploring Hughes's mental illness but builds to a powerful conclusion.Yet another exceptional film from the master Martin Scorsese.
I:581;1621;This is a terrific movie.
I:581;1622;The cast is perfect for the story.
I:581;1623;I certainly hope that director, cast and crew will finish the job with a sequel taking Hughes' life to the end.
I:581;1624;I found the acting, the sets and the costumes visually stunning and the length of this film (near 2 1/2 hours) flew by.
I:581;1625;If you know everything about Howard Hughes, you'll enjoy seeing him come back to life thanks to the amazing performance by Leonardo DiCaprio.
I:581;1626;Good performance of Dicaprio and the other actors.
I:581;1627;In terms of the movie, Martin Scorcese's love for Americana and of the golden Hollywood era was well.
I:581;1628;It was simply beautiful to look at and the scenes simply glowed with radiance of yesteryears.
I:581;1629;Overall, the movie simply fit in together nicely and seamlessly.
I:581;1630;notch actors and actresses here, just to display the clout that Martin had in Hollywood and the respect that he would garner from it.
I:581;1631;"Only because of good acting, and some visual ""events"" of the production I give it 2 stars."
I:581;1632;Watching it with some friends that thought it was ok, well, I had to finnish it.
I:581;1633;also, everyone's acting was just great.
I:581;1634;Kate Blanchett was of course wonderful.
I:581;1635;I'm so glad that Scorsese has decided Leonardo DiCaprio is his new favorite actor.
I:581;1636;They make such a good team .
I:581;1637;Dicaprio was great in this.
I:581;1638;The casting is absolutely haywire.
I:581;1639;The only saving grace was few Computer enhanced visuals.
I:581;1640;I watched this last night and loved it, the movie pulls you in and takes you along for the ride.
I:581;1641;You would think this would be a really long movie by looking at the running time (169 min) but it's not at all, it fits perfectly in place and you never go through a boring moment.
I:581;1642;Every genius has a price to be paid.
I:581;1643;In order to accomplish the tremendous things he did with his life, the gods dictated that he had to be afflicted with out of control paranoia and obsessive.
I:581;1644;"Scorsese wisely chronicles the `glory' years of Hughes in ""The Aviator"" from the 20's to the 40's."
I:581;1645;How Hughes was able to accomplish all that he did despite his mental handicap only underscores his genius.
I:581;1646;The pace of the movie is further quickened by period music and Howard Shore's incredible score.
I:581;1647;Hughes genius is evident throughout the movie, but he also had an amazing amount of clairvoyance in the way he predicted and invested in the emerging trends of the future.
I:581;1648;America still continues to be the global leader in movie production and is still a leader in new aviation technology.
I:581;1649;For an industrialist/engineer like Hughes it is interesting that Hollywood has given him, on the whole, a positive portrayal.
I:581;1650;Another aspect of the movie is the new DiCaprio.
I:581;1651;it looks like a good movie cant wait to watch it, i know it took a while to make but im sure it is going to be worth the waiteagerly awaiting very excited :)
I:581;1652;DiCaprio is awesome in this movie.
I:581;1653;I have never been a big fan, but DiCaprio's acting in this film is great.
I:581;1654;From what I remember reading about Hughes as a kid, the movie portrays Hughes in a similar light.
I:581;1655;Some transitions in time are fairly quick, so some adjustments have to be made, but the personality of Hughes really shines through.
I:581;1656;I was excited to see this movie, and then found myself getting very restless in the crowd.
I:581;1657;leo did a great job playing a tormented man.
I:581;1658;A movie about rich people in movie's.
I:581;1659;I saw it coming with Gangs of New York, but somebody keep Leonardo DiCaprio away from this guy.
I:581;1660;They are awful together and The Aviator is one big expensive, good.

I:581;1663;I think *The Aviator* was the best movie of 2004 and should have won many more academy awards than it did.
I:581;1664;"I think this is a far more entertaining movie than ""Million Dollar Baby"" which won best picture."
I:581;1665;Beyond that it's a great movie, great character development and captures the character of Howard Hughes before be became a crazy, zillionaire drug addict.
I:581;1666;This film does represent a serious investment of your time.
I:581;1667;That said, the acting is great and at least some of the storyline is quite inspiring.
I:581;1668;The cast is large and everyone contributes high.
I:581;1669;DiCaprio and Blanchett in particular really get into their roles.
I:581;1670;While the movie is long, some of what are considered the most interesting and exciting parts of Mr. Hughes life are told in what seems to me to be a clear and accurate telling.
I:581;1671;diCaprio and the others performed well, and it's an enjoyable movie.
I:581;1672;all in all, a very interesting telling of an important part of American History.
I:581;1673;Well directed/acted and easy to enjoy.
I:581;1674;I am extremely pleased with this movie .
I:581;1675;I am happy it seems to be historically correct as well.
I:581;1676;"Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator"" does neither

I:581;1678;staged airplane crashes, a truly amusing dinner at the Hepburn table, the Congressional hearings that Hughes attended, Hughes delusions and fits of genius, and the gargantuan hangars where Hughes' planes were crafted.
I:581;1679;even the decor of the respective homes is a feast for the eyes, as one can't help but be captivated by the room appointments.
I:581;1680;The visuals are equally matched with the enthrallingly witty dialogue between the principals.
I:581;1681;"if the Oscar gods are kind, the director will be carrying home the coveted ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Director"" Academy Award this coming Sunday."
I:581;1682;the musical score, which is comprised of both Howard Shore's compositions, along with familiar classical and jazz/pop selections, ranks among one of the best heard on screen in years.
I:581;1683;the film also gets major kudos for its casting.
I:581;1684;it seems as though Ian Holm has a talent for seeking out blockbusters.
I:581;1685;finally, star Leonard DiCaprio is mesmerizing as the title character.
I:581;1686;He , like the planes that Hughes obsessed over, is quite riveting.

I:581;1690;This man is a courageous actor .

I:581;1698;She was a strange one but somewhat revealed in this movie.
I:581;1699;she was, of course, quite attractive.
I:581;1700;That means she was banging everybody and anybody she felt like.
I:581;1701;the scene where she comes to Howard's apartment and gets him ready to confront the Congressional investigation was something unique.
I:581;1702;She cleans him up and he devastates the politicians with his fearless honesty.
I:581;1703;"I loved her line, ""Love what you've done to the place."
I:581;1704;i've read about Howard Hughes, the crackpot and kook but not so much about his genius and daring.
I:581;1705;everything about this movie was impressive to me.
I:581;1706;leonard DiCaprio gave a stunning portrait and gripping insights into this man, his greatness and his problems.
I:581;1707;i found this movie totally fascinating.
I:581;1708;I'm sure I will be watching it again and again.
I:581;1709;One of the greatest compliments to any film, IMHO, is when it can be called a great work of art.
I:581;1710;And this one is just that, a great work of art.
I:581;1711;Leonardo DiCaprio was great, as usual, in this film.
I:581;1712;I've read, in some places, that the film took a few liberties with facts about Hughes, but it's still a great film.
I:581;1713;But the art and craftwork that went into creating the period are just fantastic.
I:581;1714;Howard Hughes was a facinating and complex American icon.
I:581;1715;I was astounded by the depth of portrayal displayed by both Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett in breathing life into these legendary, larger than life personalities.
I:581;1716;The film, a bit longish at 170 minutes focused on the 20 year slice of Hughes' life between 1927 and 1947 and sometimes bogged down unnecessarily, but on the whole was a typically excellent piece of filmmaking by director Martin Scorsese.
I:581;1717;First off, you get an idea of the genius that Hughes possessed as well as the problems that he faced on a daily basis.
I:581;1718;Overall, the movie makes you empathize with his hardships and rejoice in his triumphs.
I:581;1719;Great writing, acting, and directing!
I:581;1720;I can't say I'm a huge Leonardo DeCapprio fan but he really does a fine job in this portrayal of the young Howard Hughes.
I:581;1721;He gets a lot of support from a great cast and the screenplay is very witty and engaging.
I:581;1722;hops from topic to topic hoping that special effects will keep us interested and mere vignettes are sufficient.
I:581;1723;This is an excellent movie that shows the brilliance and illness of a legend.
I:581;1724;Everyone does their job well.
I:581;1725;If you don't, it will be 10 bucks well spent.
I:581;1726;Good job of props, casting and acting however this movie tends to trivialize the life of a great man.
I:581;1727;Being a pilot, I can understand better the aviation perspective of that great movie.
I:581;1728;"There's such a common area as ""flush rivets"" philosophy when it comes to have a ""clean"" surface that can results in faster speed."
I:581;1729;Having seen many HH documentaries, this movie provide a nice deep feel of HH dreams, behavior and personal sides of his life.
I:581;1730;one of the best sequence in the movie is the night flight with K Hepburn with that beautiful soundtrack.
I:581;1731;i went to see the movie three times (yes 3 times) and I'm planning to see it once more.
I:581;1732;A 3 hour movie deserves this attention.
I:581;1733;And each time I go, I discover new details.
I:581;1734;"kate Blanchet is exquisite to portray K Hepburn
I:581;1735;i recommend to view this great movie and encourage every aviation enthousiasts to read more about HH, aviation, germs and life in the 30's.
I:581;1736;The third group likes the movie.
I:581;1737;It is by no means the greatest epic ever made, but for me it hearkens back to the glory days of the early Cinemascope, Technicolor Hollywood epic, but with better special effects.
I:581;1738;The sets and costumes are completely luscious.
I:581;1739;"The acting, while very good all around, teeters close to going ""over."
I:581;1740;"top,"" which is just what this sort of film needs."
I:581;1741;It is trying to tell the epic story of an epic American who achieved epic things and endured epic personal battles.
I:581;1742;for example, everyone loved Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn(heck she won the Oscar).
I:581;1743;Was Hepburn, even in quiet moments, really so full of PERSONALITY?
I:581;1744;In real life, he seems like a terrific, open, intelligent and easily amused person.
I:581;1745;how perfect that casting is!!
I:581;1746;how could he take on a master.
I:581;1747;At first, Hughes hits Hollywood with his wealth and boyish enthusiasm and starts making huge films.
I:581;1748;He's full of nervous energy and driven to succeed.
I:581;1749;That actually suits DiCaprio's natural look pretty well.
I:581;1750;so early on, we can see the boyish DiCaprio as the boyish Hughes.
I:581;1751;and DiCaprio and Scorcese beautifully stage these scenes.
I:581;1752;One great moment has Hughes in a public restroom, having just obsessively washed his hands.
I:581;1753;Another patron askes Hughes to hand him a towel.
I:581;1754;This is pretty good stuff.
I:581;1755;He's a kid in a candy shop.
I:581;1756;This scene is brilliantly staged, with great sound and editing, and we really feel we're in that crash with him.
I:581;1757;And finally, the flight of the Spruce Goose is an emotionally climactic moment.
I:581;1758;But what Scorcese and DiCaprio have captured with THE AVIATOR is the spirit of a time in our history when great things could be done by great individuals with great ambition and drive.
I:581;1759;Spielberg's MINORITY REPORT ain't E. t. or JAWS, but each is a masterpiece on its own terms.
I:581;1760;Frankly, Jake LaMotta in RAGING BULL is so unlikeable, the film has always kept me at a bit of an emotional distance (great though it may be).
I:581;1761;baiting activities after TITANIC, is truly one of our most gifted actors.
I:581;1762;personally, I recommend this film VERY highly.
I:581;1763;It's the finest mix of old.
I:581;1764;i finally saw this wondrous film last night in a $1.50 all seats theatre.
I:581;1765;it was packed to the rafters, and oh so deservingly so!
I:581;1766;this is scorcese at his film making best.
I:581;1767;the film is spectacular in every detail, and from start to shocking finish!
I:581;1768;and oh the acting how superb everyone was!
I:581;1769;in spite if it's running length, the film moved as if it were 90 minutes long.
I:581;1770;the great screenplay, the awesome cinematography, the musical score, all blended together to make seeing 'the aviator' an unforgettable film experince!
I:581;1771;it's such a brilliant and haunting film, it will be easy to view over and over!
I:581;1772;i am sure all of you will feel the same!
I:581;1773;bravos to scorcese and kudos to some of the best acting ever.
I:581;1774;I am an aviation buff but it was still great just as a classic movie lover.
I:581;1775;With the time period it portrayed it felt like a classic movie.
I:581;1776;Leonardo's portrayal of Howard Hughes was great, Cate Blanchett was great, I fell in love with Kate Beckinsale and a nod to Christina Aguilera for being classic sexy in her scenes.
I:581;1777;"Roger Ebert gives it 4 of 4 stars and ""This is one of the year's best films."""
I:581;1778;Scorsese is a genius and DiCaprio's performance is outstanding.
I:581;1779;This is an absolutely amazing film set.
I:581;1780;First, the film is an absorbing and completely believable historical reconstruction of a remarkable and complex life.
I:581;1781;I have never seen such a successful biopic about an innovator .
I:581;1782;he was a film maker, an industrialist, and flyer, all of them the best at one time.
I:581;1783;the acting is first rate.
I:581;1784;rated actors by the critics .
I:581;1785;brought not only mood to the film, but meticulous research about the man, his genius, and his mental illness, which he put together in a performance that may be his best.
I:581;1786;He is at turns charming, a megalomaniac, and a pathetically sick man, all while setting some of the most important precedents in world history.
I:581;1787;Cate Blanchette is also perfect as the real Katherine Hepburn, with her rarified Connecticut accent and delightful iconoclasm.
I:581;1788;It is doubly remarkable how she brings a real person out of one of the greatest chameleons in film history.
I:581;1789;All I remembered were his last sad years, which played out during my adolescence to the appalled fascination of the press.
I:581;1790;facetted portrait that will leave you hungry for more.
I:581;1791;Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.
I:581;1792;Scorsese has proven once again that he is the best.
I:581;1793;the aremuch better movies out.
I:581;1794;Avoid this movie unless you want a lengthy biography of Howard Huges, but I personally enjoyed the actual biography more
I:581;1795;Even though the movie is a bit long, it will still grab your attention.
I:581;1796;It ain't always easy being a visionary and an innovative genius .
I:581;1797;just ask Howard Hughes, the renowned millionaire, who had three main ambitions in life: to build the fastest airplanes, to make the biggest movies, and to become the richest man in the world.
I:581;1798;That he achieved those lofty goals at a very great personal cost to himself is what makes his story the stuff of legend.
I:581;1799;Martin Scorsese captures all facets of this larger.
I:581;1800;"life figure in ""The Aviator,"" a high."
I:581;1801;flying epic that does justice to a man who became a national icon and the embodiment of the American dream despite his internal weaknesses .
I:581;1802;and whose legend lives on today.
I:581;1803;studio work that allowed Hughes to combine his twin loves of moviemaking and aviation.
I:581;1804;If nothing else, Hughes thought BIG, and his capriciousness and profligacy, as reflected in the mounting budget of the film he was making, also spilled over into the realm of aviation, as he began looking for ways to create ever more aerodynamic airplanes at greater and greater cost.
I:581;1805;His obsession with size culminated in the creation of the ill.
I:581;1806;His relationship with Hepburn is a particularly telling one because they seem to understand one another so well .
I:581;1807;so well, in fact, that they are unable to make a permanent go of things and wind up going their separate ways.
I:581;1808;as director, Scorcese brings his usual flair and visual inventiveness to the film, soaring highest .
I:581;1809;as is appropriate, perhaps .
I:581;1810;The first hour, in particular, moves at a breathless clip, as he weaves the various strands of his epic .
I:581;1811;story into a cohesive whole.
I:581;1812;the movie becomes a sad but fascinating study of a man in the throes of a nervous breakdown.
I:581;1813;as Hughes, Leonardo Di Caprio carries the weight of the film on his frail shoulders, and he does a superb job, hitting new dramatic heights in the scenes in which he both falls to pieces psychologically and rises confidently to the challenge of clearing his good name in a senate hearing.
I:581;1814;The film captures the era beautifully through the art deco architecture, the dazzling sets and costumes, and a nostalgia.
I:581;1815;evoking soundtrack overflowing with familiar period standards.
I:581;1816;"In honor of that spirit, ""The Aviator"" doesn't unravel the enigma of Howard Hughes
I:581;1817;And that is as it should be.
I:581;1818;I would like to announce to the world that the true genius of Martin Scorsese is back.
I:581;1819;For in this wonderful movie I caught a glimpse of American History in the form of the tormented genius that was Howard Hughs.
I:581;1820;i also learned so much about Howard Hughes: about his obsessive/compulsive disorder, about his courage and vision, about his passion for the sky and for the movies and its stars.
I:581;1821;I even learned that though he was a man of power and madness, there was also a sense of compassion in him.
I:581;1822;All of the other supporting actors were of course excellent and well casted.
I:581;1823;Yet the tapestry of Scorsese's film is riveting and full of those subtle scorsese touches that make for profound cinema.
I:581;1824;He played a man with a price very well, and one could see the corruption that is so prevalent in today's politics.
I:581;1825;all in all, a wonderful movie from begining to end.
I:581;1826;Hey I really liked this movie.
I:581;1827;Anyway, Leo is cute and did a good job in this film.
I:581;1828;I loved the part where he goes crazy.
I:581;1829;Each one has been a masterpiece.
I:581;1830;disc Special Edition)are masterpieces and I feel THe Aviator ranks right up there with these.
I:581;1831;Spectacular and grand in its scope.
I:581;1832;The cast is brilliant and their acting is perfect.
I:581;1833;Cate Blanchett steals the show as Katharine Hepburn, definitely and Oscar worthy performance.
I:581;1834;the film itself covers Howard Hughes life for 20 or so years.
I:581;1835;, this muvie is a very good movie.
I:581;1836;It's one of the best of the year.
I:581;1837;Mostly, it is an interesting remake of history, portraying a genius of a man and his love of flying.
I:581;1838;The best scene: the crash.
I:581;1839;If for no other reason, this scene is the most spectacular scene.
I:581;1840;Leonardo DeCaprio did an excellent acting job in this film.
I:581;1841;It should have won multiple awards.
I:581;1842;Sentiment, intelligence, spectacle, bravura, tragedy .
I:581;1843;The Aviator is terrific entertainment and then some, a picture immersed in the filmmaking passion of Martin Scorsese and the acute talent of Leonardo DiCaprio, who was once primed to just about disappear from Hollywood.
I:581;1844;Scorsese will never likely make something so lush again .
I:581;1845;but sometimes $100 million can be harnessed into a picture worthy of the figure.
I:581;1846;Million Dollar Baby and its artificial myths may have won the biggest awards of the year, but this is the picture that goes in the vault and is unearthed fifty years from now, a glorious, golden.
I:581;1847;using as many special effects as he's probably ever used in any of films combined, Scorsese sheds light on Hughes' three passions: movies, airplanes and women.
I:581;1848;blanchett deservedly won the Academy Award for her work as Hollywood's most decorated actress: Like Hepburn, Blanchett is pretty impressed with her abilities and given to a kind of good.

I:581;1850;Hughes, nearly killed in a XF.11 test plane crash over Beverly Hills, secludes himself in his personal movie theater, on the brink of permanent insanity, before emerging to face Trippe and Brewster in a Senate hearing.
I:581;1851;"This is a signature performance, his ""Michael Corleone,"" a logical evolution of his work in ""Catch Me If You Can,"" that ensures he'll have leads in prestige pictures for years to come."
I:581;1852;considering his facial gestures and body movement near the end of lunch with Sen. Brewster and you understand the lovely difference between strict method and this performance.
I:581;1853;"Scorsese hints at that in the extended theater scene

I:581;1858;That way you will know the whole story.
I:581;1859;And I learned that this man was truly an inspiration.
I:581;1860;i strongly recommend this movie!Purple_Garden
I:581;1861;This really is the sort of film that inspires you to find out about the man behind the legendary film.
I:581;1862;This film is well crafted, well acted, well styled, beautifully shot and just plain well done.
I:581;1863;"Scorsese freely admits to playing around with time lines, but to getting things ""Emotionally"" right, which I think is correct."
I:581;1864;You will love this emotional tour de force, and enjoy exploring the passions of the screenwriters version of Hughes, and I hope it does spur you on to read more about the man himself who helped shape Film, Cinema and Aviation as we know it today
I:581;1865;Very well shot, fairly good acting but way too long for the short period of Hughes' life that it covers.
I:581;1866;I went with a very diverse group of moviegoers and we all thought it was too long and too slow for what it covered.
I:581;1867;'The Aviator' is a sweeping epic of a movie chronicling the earlier years of multi.
I:581;1868;millionaire and aviation genius Howard Hughes.

I:581;1870;worthy of mention is the absolutely spectacular performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes.

I:581;1872;'The Aviator' is an interesting and beautiful journey through the triumphant and troubled life of one of America's most romantic figures.
I:581;1873;So it's perhaps fitting that Scorcese examine one of America's most infamously twisted spirits, Howard Hughes .
I:581;1874;he is truly one of the giants of the 20th century.
I:581;1875;A bold businessman, Hughes helped usher in an era of aviation innovation that improved the lives of millions . . . and he did so in grand style.
I:581;1876;The Aviator gets the highest marks as a technical exercise.

I:581;1878;side is one of the best ensemble casts ever put together.
I:581;1879;Leonardo DiCaprio disappears into the role of Hughes, capturing his joys as a man of the skies as well as his descent into madness.
I:581;1880;It's a bit unfair that DiCaprio's most famous role is the pretty.
I:581;1881;"boy Jack from ""Titanic,"" 'cause he is the genuine article when it comes to the acting game."
I:581;1882;Cate Blanchett won an Oscar for her portrayal of Hughes' love and Hollywood goddess Kate Hepburn.
I:581;1883;There are dozens of minor supporting performances (too many to mention) that are also spot.
I:581;1884;"but ultimately, ""The Aviator"" keeps the viewer somewhat at arm's length."
I:581;1885;We're also kept at arm's length by Hughes' love life.
I:581;1886;sympathetic treatment of his protagonist.
I:581;1887;that lets the audience soar with Hughes.
I:581;1888;"The great biopics bring you ""into the family,"" while the merely."
I:581;1889;"lovely"" being a recent example) show us an interesting life, but don't let get too close."
I:581;1890;"still, ""The Aviator"" deserves to be seen, and Hughes, for all his faults and flaws, is a man worthy of a great film."
I:581;1891;"In many ways, ""The Aviator"" may be the perfect film to tell his story."
I:581;1892;Scorsese is of course a great director and he gets the most out of Leonardo, this is a demanding character and Di Caprio nails it.
I:581;1893;The period clothes are great, this was a great time for fashion.
I:581;1894;I don't know who the cinemaphotographer was, but he does a great job, the images are so crisp and well filmed.
I:581;1895;Hughes was a fascinating subject and being from Houston, I was familiar with his story, but this indepth take is so interesting, whether you are interested in Hughes or not.
I:581;1896;Although longer than most, it keeps you attention and interest throughout.
I:581;1897;It looks and feels like a fascinating personal adventure.
I:581;1898;You'll remember it for its thrilling flying scenes.

I:581;1900;A taut script chugs things along at a rapid clip.
I:581;1901;helped by confident cameos from everyone, especially Cate Blanchett after one comes to terms with that farcical Hepburn accent.
I:581;1902;Alan Ada sports phenomenal presence in the little bit of screen time he is accorded.
I:581;1903;no, the film is truly well made.
I:581;1904;I'd recommend it in a blink.
I:581;1905;Went to see this film on the spur of the moment and spent the next two hours rivetted, absolutely spellbound.
I:581;1906;Martin Scorsese makes his finest film since Goodfellas.
I:581;1907;Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance of his young career as the ecentric moviemaker/aviation genious.
I:581;1908;social Anxiety, Depression and he was a Racist (See the beginning of the film.)
I:581;1909;It was a well deserved Oscar winning performance.
I:581;1910;Alan Alda also gives a great performance as does Alec Baldwin.
I:581;1911;This film is breathtaking to watch.
I:581;1912;This was a great film.
I:581;1913;It's Christmas time, so you know it's time to see Leo DiCaprio playing a extraordinary hero in another good film.
I:581;1914;Usually one of the few worth seeing all year.
I:581;1915;I have never truly loved his films.
I:581;1916;howard Hughes is the subject of the film.
I:581;1917;He was the film and aviation entrepreneur that was able to keep his madness in check enough to rise to the occassion and still become and stay successful for a long time.
I:581;1918;cate Blanchett, did a good job playing an actress many remember.
I:581;1919;this film reminds me of A Beautiful Mind a lot with its plot of brilliant professor who also struggles with madness.
I:581;1920;i fancy mad genius films.
I:581;1921;It is possible that Dicaprio could have sparked some ideas for making the movie.
I:581;1922;Marty definitely fuels the engines of his movies.
I:581;1923;There is so much to comprehend about this mans life.
I:581;1924;which made me respect it even more.
I:581;1925;It has actually been about a week since a saw this film and it is just as fresh in my mind now as when I first saw it.
I:581;1926;"That is a sign of a good film in my opinion
I:581;1927;Viewers are given the opportunity to get inside the head of one of the greatest geniuses and most eccentric men of our time.
I:581;1928;I do want to say that I thought the acting was absolutely amazing in this.
I:581;1929;"I'm one of those strange women who don't go for the pretty boys
I:581;1930;He does an absolutely phenomenal acting job.
I:581;1931;He just completely embraces this role to the point where I question if he was really sane while filming this.
I:581;1932;I actually wept at the end of this film simply because the acting was so darn good, not because of the plot and the tragic story of Hughes sickness.
I:581;1933;this is a must see film.
I:581;1934;Aviator is a captivating movie that highlights Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Howard Hughes.
I:581;1935;The film captures Howard Hughes rise in wealth and fame during his lifetime through his work in aviation and the Hollywood film industry.
I:581;1936;There is also the image of Leonardo DiCaprio walking through a beach wearing a suit.
I:581;1937;modern Marvel Feature: A History channel documentary on Howard Hughes.
I:581;1938;loudon, Rufus, and Martha, The Aviator Soundtrack Spot and Still Gallery featuring Leonardo DiCaprio and many of the other celebrities in Aviator.
I:581;1939;The Aviator is a good film that tries to be a whole lot better.
I:581;1940;with this film, Leonardo DiCaprio is finally showing that he can act for a change.
I:581;1941;"He's still not on par with actors like Tom Hanks or Morgan Freeman, and his performance here is not as good as his last performance in Scorcese's ""Gangs of New York,"" but he does a good job nonetheless."
I:581;1942;cate Blanchett is the real star of this picture.
I:581;1943;She plays the icon of film with grace, and eccentricity.
I:581;1944;She deserved the oscar she won.
I:581;1945;kate Beckinsale does a good job as Ava Gardener, and Gwen Stefani was surprisingly good as Jean Harlow in her brief scenes.
I:581;1946;"the aerial sequences (including the filming of ""Hell's Angels,"" the crash of the XF.11 plane that nearly killed Hughes, and the first flight of the Spruce Goose) are outstanding, and the visual effects and cinematography are dazzling."
I:581;1947;An element of the story that at first is heart.
I:581;1948;"despite these faults, ""The Aviator"" is an enjoyable epic that takes a fascinating look at the life of a man whose vision changed the course of aviation forever."
I:581;1949;The movie could have been fascinating as the plot is stunning.
I:581;1950;My adult son Bam recommended this movie.
I:581;1951;It is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:581;1952;Leonardo DiCaprio is spectacular, many of his scenes almost 'haunting'.
I:581;1953;I've enjoyed his performance in other films, but he is better in this movie than any movie I have ever seen him in.
I:581;1954;An incredible film that I have found very re.
I:581;1955;A brilliant cast, who I am sure, received brilliant direction from Martin Scorcese.
I:581;1956;Leonardo Dicaprio did an outstanding job in his portrayal of Howard Hughes.
I:581;1957;This is a thorougly engrossing film that comes highly recommended.
I:581;1958;Kate Blanchet looks more like the fish in 'Shark Tale' than Katherine Hepburn, but she does a fantastic job sounding and acting like the old girl.You won't learn much from this movie, but it does make you curious about the life and times of one of our more eccentric citizens.
I:581;1959;The performances and the direction are superb.
I:581;1960;while the latest Scorsese entry is a beautifully produced motion picture, the story all but drops off the horizon once the Hughes/Hepburn courtship ends.
I:581;1961;Obviously, the couple breaks up and moves on to other romantic partners, but the interplay between Dicaprio and Blanchette is what kept my eyes glued to the screen for the first hour and a quarter of the picture.
I:581;1962;with the remainder of the film though, it was interesting to see Hughes' descent into mania as time went on.
I:581;1963;Aviator was well directed, well acted, and well, interesting up to a point.
I:581;1964;You honestly should see this movie just for Cate Blanchette .
I:581;1965;she truly deserved her Oscar for her stunning portrayal of Catherine Hepburn.
I:581;1966;"Dicaprio was once again a solid dramatic lead, as he has shown with ""Gangs of New York"" (another Scorsese picture that was heartily robbed of an Oscar for Daniel Day Lewis' deeply immersed depiction of Bill the Butcher) and ""Catch Me If You Can."""
I:581;1967;Some people prefer the widescreen but I'll take full.
I:581;1968;the film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as the legendary aviator, business tycoon, rebel Howard Hughes from the 1920 to 1940s with a first rate cast and director.
I:581;1969;hand man from the beginning to the end.
I:581;1970;This film was directed by his friend and legend, Martin Scorsese.
I:581;1971;The story of Howard Hughes is worth telling even if you can't do it all in one movie.
I:581;1972;Howard Hughes was a deeply complicated genius but haunted by his demons.
I:581;1973;I was impressed with the use of History's Modern Marvel's episode featuring Howard Hughes included upon the second disk.
I:581;1974;The second disc is worth using to help explain aviation history and Howard Hughes' role in it.
I:581;1975;i'll never forget when I was in Las Vegas and our tour guide stated that three men helped develop the gambling mecca and Howard Hughes was one of them.
I:581;1976;box thinking and entrepreneurial spirit?
I:581;1977;The ending is abrupt, but it's worth seeing.
I:581;1978;At almost 3 hours, you may not want to watch it again, but it's worth a single go at least.
I:581;1979;Excellent performances by Dicaprio (to remind people, before TITANIC he was considered one of the most gifted and dedicated young professionals around) and Cate Blanchet, who is always the jewel in the crown of any picture.
I:581;1980;Blanchet is so good, it is an entirely forgotten she is playing Kate Hepburn rather than being her.
I:581;1981;face discovery as a teenager.
I:581;1982;just as well he is a bought man here.
I:581;1983;I'm a great fan of Leonardo DiCaprio's work, but this was an amazing depiction of the life of Howard Hughes.
I:581;1984;I highly recommend it, even though it's a bit lengthy (almost three hours).

I:581;2004;The Howard Hughes story is huge .
I:581;2005;Along the way his personal eccentricities and dalliances with Hollywood stars were the stuff of legend .
I:581;2006;a glimpse of a playboy with vision.
I:581;2007;`The Aviator' opens with Hughes in the middle of filming his World War I epic `Hells Angels'.
I:581;2008;It becomes a huge hit and cements Hughes place in Hollywood.
I:581;2009;The film's best performance, by Daniel Day Lewis, so overwhelmed the rest of the film, that it became a chore to sit through the long, overblown, confusing story.
I:581;2010;`The Aviator' is a lot better, so much better that it restores my faith in Scorcese, a faith that waned a bit.
I:581;2011;the look of `The Aviator' is fantastic.
I:581;2012;Much of the film is made to look like a film shot in early two.
I:581;2013;It has a distinctive look.
I:581;2014;In `The Aviator' it immediately adds a level to the film and helps it recreate Hollywood in the 30s.
I:581;2015;the performances, overall, are fine.
I:581;2016;What he isn't great at is getting to the heart of Hughes' character.
I:581;2017;Yes, he is a man with a lot of lovers, but we don't really learn why.
I:581;2018;One shot of a man peeing into a milk bottle would pretty much do that for me.
I:581;2019;cate Blanchett is fantastic as Kate Hepburn.
I:581;2020;It is a fine line to walk but Cate Blanchette walks it beautifully.
I:581;2021;Yes, she's pretty, but she can't act her way out a paper bag.
I:581;2022;He is also in Trippe's pocket.
I:581;2023;Together, the two of them prove to be worthy foes of Hughes.
I:581;2024;scorcese has created a long, well crafted, interesting film about a man few know little about.
I:581;2025;On one level, this is an interesting and convincing period piece about the times in which Hughes lived and his remarkable accomplishments.
I:581;2026;"I greatly enjoyed the film the first time I saw it but it wasn't until that second viewing that I realized the power and grittiness of the story they were trying to tell and, for me, the ""classic"" status it should/will receive."
I:581;2027;The source music really helps set the period and the score by Howard Shore is truly exceptional.
I:581;2028;My respect for DiCaprio grew tremendously as well .
I:581;2029;both for his actual performance and after learning more about his passion for wanting to put this story onscreen and all the work he went to and interest he took in the project.
I:581;2030;"I don't like using the word ""epic"" and often avoid so. called stories that are, but 'The Aviator' is a grand one that has a tone all of its own due to the focus on Hughes' determination and achievements in face of mounting external struggles and even more overwhelming internal ones."
I:581;2031;The Scorsese film does a great job of bringing this remarkable character to vivid life, in all his brilliance and all his eccentricity.
I:581;2032;DiCaprio's portrayal is outstanding, and Cate Blanchett as Kathryn Hepburn is all that.
I:581;2033;"Scorsese does a good job of putting you inside Hughes' head in moments of paranoia, allowing the audience to see a ""menacing"" employee or a ""threatening"" piece of food as Hughes does."
I:581;2034;And overall, I think the film avoids the temptation to dwell on the eccentricities, instead striking a good balance between showing his moments of greatness and moments of deterioration, and presenting a complex character in all his complexity.
I:581;2035;So the film stops in just the right place after all.
I:581;2036;"Ever since 1990's ""Goodfellas,"" Martin Scorsese has been a brilliant filmmaker in search of a truly worthy project."
I:581;2037;"he's found it in ""The Aviator"" the story of Howard Hughes, billionaire financier, moviemaker, squirer of movie stars, genius in the world of aviation, and paranoid germaphobic."
I:581;2038;"scorsese exhibits his usual brilliance in recreating the era (his staging of Hughes ""Blue Angels"" for example is breathtaking) and his trademark use of popular music (in this case Artie Shaw, Glenn Miller, Bing Crosby, Louis Armstrong et al) is truly unmatched
I:581;2039;di Caprio catches every nuance and gesture of Hughes' larger than life persona.
I:581;2040;he is abetted by a supporting cast that is uniformly superb, the great Kate Winslett as Katie Hepburn, John C Reilly as Noah Dietrich, an amazing performance by Alan Alda as a coruprt U. s. Senator, and the incredibly beautiful Kate Beckensale as Ava Gardner (Miss Beckensale's beauty literally matches, if not suprpasses that of Miss Gardner.
I:581;2041;The Aviator is genuine proof of what Hollywood can do when it decides to make a great movie that lifts the spirit and doesn't insult the intelligence of its of its audience.
I:581;2042;I love this movie and can watch it over and over again.
I:581;2043;ray technology is capable of.
I:581;2044;The movie begins as a young Hughes directs one of Scorsese's favorite films, Hell's Angels.
I:581;2045;Hughes was so obsessed with perfection in the aerial sequences that he waits forever for perfect conditions, right down to cloud formations.
I:581;2046;This is an astonishingly beautiful and moving movie.
I:581;2047;DiCaprio is amazing and Cate Blanchett is incredible as Katherine Hepburn.
I:581;2048;It is the major relationship and the true heart of the movie, one that fuels his eccentric genius and yet constantly threatens to rip his life apart.
I:581;2049;The Aviator is a real surprise.
I:581;2050;Instead it turned out to be one of the very best films of the past year, managing to mix and match the epic public aspirations and the private hell of Hughes remarkably successfully.
I:581;2051;DeCaprio's performance was superb, catching the public face of Hughes so convincingly that he sold the film's interpretation of his private one and serving as a reminder of why he used to be regarded as a great actor before [i]Titanic[/i] turned him into a much reviled icon for the resentful boyfriends of smitten teenage girls.
I:581;2052;excellent supporting performances too, especially Alan Alda, John C. Reilley and, most surprisingly, Kate Beckinsale, who overcomes being physically far too slight for Ava Gardner by capturing her strength surprisingly well.
I:581;2053;Fabulous cinematography from Robert Richardson, capturing the evolution of color processes from the relevant eras with real skill and subtlety.
I:581;2054;not to mention that astonishing, almost apocalyptic crash sequence .
I:581;2055;Hughes' life was enormous than life itself.
I:581;2056;Howard Hughes was a true innovator.
I:581;2057;This movie is sooo long but worth seeing.
I:581;2058;amazing how someone can even play a role so well and not have this disorder.
I:581;2059;what a very smart man Howard Hughes was.
I:581;2060;but still the role was played well.
I:581;2061;As many other reviewers have rightly said, DiCaprio shows surprisingly mature acting, and other actors are as wonderful as he is.
I:581;2062;for Hughes, everything must be done with extraordinary scale, and this bio.
I:581;2063;From his costly shooting of 'Hell's Angels' to his fights with the authorities, the life of Howard Hughes is always exciting.
I:581;2064;For it's the job of the good actors.
I:581;2065;leonard DiCaprio is excellent as Howard Hugh though I think he may look a bit too young at times (when with beard in particular).
I:581;2066;Martin Scorsese is clearly seeking for something new, leaving his favorite city of New York far behind, and teaming up with DiCaprio, as if forgetting his long.
I:581;2067;'The Aviator' is hailed as another masterpiece from the maestro.
I:581;2068;tHE AVIATOR has all the elements of a great movie.
I:581;2069;Martin Scorsese and crew perfectly captured the glitz, glamour, and glare that was Hollywood in the 1930s and early 1940s.
I:581;2070;Few historical or biopic films have ever captured the essence of a place and time as well as THE AVIATOR does.
I:581;2071;the acting in the film is superb.
I:581;2072;He does a brilliant job of capturing all the minute and not.
I:581;2073;Just as impressive is Cate Blanchett's performance of Katharine Hepburn.
I:581;2074;This is Blanchett's finest role (in my opinion even surpassing her performance in ELIZABETH) and she should garner an Oscar nomination.
I:581;2075;The supporting cast is just as fine: everyone from Jude Law playing Errol Flynn to Kate Beckinsale as Eva Gardner to the wonderful John C. Reilly as Noah Dietrich, Hughes' money man.
I:581;2076;I also liked the fact that the movie didn't end in typical Hollywood fashion with Hughes victorious flight of the Spruce Goose.
I:581;2077;But Scorsese delivers this time and continues the action and gives a much more realistic end to the film.
I:581;2078;with everything it has going for it one would think that THE AVIATOR is a great movie.
I:581;2079;It should be a great movie.
I:581;2080;The costumes and people are pretty to look at and all the men watch the film wishing they could fly planes as cool looking as the ones Hughes did.
I:581;2081;Cate Blanchette is worth watching, but since Hepburn's relationship with Hughes was so short, the energy she brings to the screen quickly departs.
I:581;2082;This is an astounding and unforgettable motion picture .
I:581;2083;"I've always liked DeCaprio in the Aviator, and think it runs a fine line through the life of Howard Hughes, even though I'm not sure how his life turned out after the ending scene in 1947, but more than 2 hours of the movie captures the affects of his accomplishments in a brilliant way, with people telling Hughes stuff like, ""Don't put any more money into this movie!"""
I:581;2084;But Hughes never gave up, and the movie is a must.
I:581;2085;see performance to those who need to be encouraged to keep their own dreams as well.

I:581;2087;"From legendary oscar ""NOMINATED"" director Martin Scorcesse and starring Leonardo Dicaprio in his most triumphfant and stupendous performance."
I:581;2088;He portrays the man who built the future.
I:581;2089;it's an interesting, thrilling gripping life story that truly tells you what you haven't heard.
I:581;2090;Howard Hughes had a huge impact on Hollywood,women and avation and this is his story.
I:581;2091;If you like Hollywood figure biographies this is the best bio I've seen,but Chaplin comes pretty close.
I:581;2092;See the romance,the fame and the greatness of the Avatior.
I:581;2093;The acting in this is top notch.
I:581;2094;Everyone did such a fantastic job, especially Leonardo and Cate.
I:581;2095;The film itself was maybe a tad overlong, but it did a great job in conveying the emotions of the character role and what he went through.
I:581;2096;Howard Hughes seemed like a complicated character and I thought Scorsese did a fantastic job of portraying him.
I:581;2097;The imagery in the film is also quite stunning.
I:581;2098;If you like character driven films, this is a great choice.
I:581;2099;What a great movie .
I:581;2100;it has love, suspense, airplanes, movies, business deals, obsessive compulsive disorder.
I:581;2101;a very satisfying and captivating movie.
I:581;2102;I recommend it to anyone who likes true stories about fascinating people.
I:581;2103;It is much ado about something, something quite grand.
I:581;2104;This is great fun most of the time, and it contains one of the most exciting plane crashes ever filmed.
I:581;2105;that crash sequence, brilliantly editied by Thelma Schoonmaker (she won an Oscar, one of five the picture earned) is one of several painstaking set pieces that reveal Scorcese's love of movie craftsmanship.
I:581;2106;"the casting is impeccable save for Leonardo DiCaprio
I:581;2107;John C. Reily is solid as his steadfast accolyte.
I:581;2108;There is also fine work from Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda and Willem DaFoe in a brief unbilled appearance.
I:581;2109;Even though he was morally bankrupt, Howard Hughes was an interesting and important figure in aviation history.
I:581;2110;Martin Scorsese is an equally interesting and important figure to modern filmmaking, and, based upon his films, equally depraved.

I:581;2114;Scorsese's camera eye is as deft as ever, although there are some rather poor cuts in the film.
I:581;2115;The special effects and recreations of the planes are also exceptional.
I:581;2116;Most everything shown is real, with very little CGI work.
I:581;2117;And the period music is nicely balanced.
I:581;2118;DiCaprio as Howard Hughes is adequate, but not memorable, as such a legendary .
I:581;2119;Hughes lived a larger life than most men, and that should have come across in the film, but it doesn't.
I:581;2120;In addition, almost every department of the production team has its own feature.
I:581;2121;He flew high on wings of wax.
I:581;2122;The Aviator is much more than a movie about a man with anxiety and mental illness.
I:581;2123;"Of course we don't see the end of the battle we just experience Hughes in his prime
I:581;2124;"A stylishly directed film, Scorsese pulls out all the stops to make ""The Aviator"" visually ravishing whether it be his imitation of the Technicolor look for each decade covered or the dazzling juxtaposition ironic images, Scorsese is at the top of his game here."
I:581;2125;Editor Thelma Schoonmaker provides Scorsese with ample support with her brilliant editing.
I:581;2126;While there's outstanding performances from the entire cast, DiCaprio's performance anchors and dominates the film as it should.
I:581;2127;"He brings Hughes to life in the film and his rewarding collaboration with Scorsese continues to be fruitful more so here than in the deeply flawed ""Gangs of New York""."
I:581;2128;a beautiful, sharp, vivid transfer receives as much bit space as possible with only the alternate commentary track by director Martin Scorsese with occasional contributions from producer/director Michael Mann and editor Thelma Schooner taking up additional space on the first disc.
I:581;2129;The sound is quite good using the 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround format in a number of subtle but important ways throughout.
I:581;2130;this flawed masterpiece is equaled by a great set of extras on disc two.

I:581;2133;Little of the time in the documentary focuses on Hughes movie making.

I:581;2141;"although it might not be a masterpiece in the same mold as ""Raging Bull"", ""The Aviator"" is one of the best films that Scorsese has made in the latter part of his career."
I:581;2142;"I hate comparing movies but far and away ""The Aviator"" is a much deeper, richer, ambitious and intelligent film than Clint Eastwood's topical but overrated ""Million Dollar Baby""."
I:581;2143;"Both films have their merit but the fact that the Academy overlooked this film (as they did Annette Benning for ""Being Julia) is a crime and continues to demonstrate how the Academy makes the easy choice when it comes to complex and intelligent filmmaking."
I:581;2144;Leonardo is a great actor.
I:581;2145;"Loved the music
I:581;2146;"The film he is making is ""Wild Angels,"" and his obsession with perfectly crafting the planes and flight scenes clearly foreshadows his impending fascination with aviation."
I:581;2147;"The Aviator is fantastic in all technical aspects
I:581;2148;The film deservedly won Oscars for cinematography, art direction, costume design .
I:581;2149;"despite this flaw, ""The Aviator"" is still a decent flick."
I:581;2150;The acting is generally quite good.
I:581;2151;"DeCaprio does an admirable job in depicting Hughes' gradual descent
I:581;2152;For a long film, it moves at a nice clip and features many well constructed and interesting scenes, with Hughes' testimony at a Congressional Hearing on aviation a true highlight.
I:581;2153;It is not entertaining enough to keep everyone's interest.
I:581;2154;leonardo DiCarprio is very impressive as Howard Hughes, the famous director/producer/the aviator/womanizer.
I:581;2155;"I loved his work in What's Eating Gilbert Grape(Johnny Depp), but ever since Titanic, he's kind of ""lost it""."
I:581;2156;OK, I did like Marvin's Room and The Basketball Diary.
I:581;2157;He's got some chemistry with Cate Blanchett(Katherine Hepburn), but she easily stole most of the scenes with her meticulous mannerism and accent.
I:581;2158;although Cate Blanchett only looks 80% alike to Kate Hepburn, she made it up with her performance that was at times delightful and funny.
I:581;2159;I am not a fan of No Doubt's Gwen Stefani, but I was very eager to see her play the Jene Harlow, the bombshell that came before Marilyn.
I:581;2160;She looked amazing, and she was at least the eye candy in this film for less than 3 minutes with two or three lines.
I:581;2161;the special effects and visuals were pretty good, especially the airplanes and the sequence of remaking Hell's Angels.
I:581;2162;"i love most any movie about Howard Hughes because he is such an interseting ""bigger than life"" person."
I:581;2163;"And yes I enjoyed this movie
I:581;2164;His movies are never absolutely perfect.
I:581;2165;the Aviator is an incredible movie.
I:581;2166;The acting was amazing (Leo will make you think he really is Howard), there were many funny and sad parts, and the special features were spectacular.
I:581;2167;they made me feel like I was actually in the movie.
I:581;2168;The Aviator is a spectacular whirlwind of a picture, a technical tour de force of cinematography and editing.
I:581;2169;It is Martin Scorsese's best, most confident work in years.
I:581;2170;It is a relief for those who worried that his visual flair and technical skill had become more important to his films than character and story.
I:581;2171;"Most importantly, ""The Aviator"" is a movingly sympathetic, marvelously entertaining portrait of an archetypal American figure."
I:581;2172;"the film can be considered Scorsese's ""Citizen Kane,"" a hugely ambitious biography of creative genius and business mogul Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio)."
I:581;2173;Hughes, a towering celebrity for most of the 20th century, was brought down by his obsessions and eccentricities and eventually driven into seclusion by his mental illness.
I:581;2174;The first hour of the film, which chronicles Hughes' rise to fame and power, is a pure pleasure to watch.
I:581;2175;diCaprio inhabits Hughes effortlessly, depicting his illness sensitively and realistically.
I:581;2176;The extraordinary performance proves that he has matured into one of the most talented actors in Hollywood.
I:581;2177;Her performance is so charismatic that when she leaves Hughes for Spencer Tracy, there is a void in the film that slows down its second hour.
I:581;2178;In one wrenching scene, Hughes .
I:581;2179;The Aviator is certainly an unsettling and challenging piece of filmmaking that does not shy away from difficulty .
I:581;2180;but its ultimate effect is to celebrate Hughes' achievements, the power of human creativity and the promise of the future.
I:581;2181;Its message is mostly optimistic, which stands in stark a contrast to the existential grittiness and relentless pessimism of Scorsese's earlier work.
I:581;2182;nevertheless, it is a terrific achievement.
I:581;2183;The film is arguably the most accessible of Scorsese's career, and it takes a significantly more positive and inspiring view of human nature than most of his work.
I:581;2184;But if the director wins the Academy Award for this film, which he very well may, it will be because he truly deserves it.
I:581;2185;hE was also brave because he would never cry of big pain, it seems like he is the best Aviator in the world because how good of an pilot he was.
I:581;2186;also when he was working on the movie Hell's Angels he would be very strict to be a good director
I:581;2187;This is by far one of the best movies that Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese have done.
I:581;2188;He really transformed himself in recent years, even though most people say he's just another pretty boy.
