id;spiegazione
1;This movie is heart wrenching, funny, and a real tear jerker all at once.
2;The characters in it are outrageous and they keep your attention throughout the storyline.
3;dumbo is a elephant who is born with very big ears.
4;i think the kids will like it .
5;sensitive child but most kids are able to deal with it.
6;This is perhaps the finest Disney film ever released.
7;dumbo is a simple but unforgettable story that evokes strong emotions of joy and sadness (the scene in which Dumbo is briefly reunited with his imprisoned mother is absolutely beautiful and still has the power to bring adult viewers to tears).
8;Following the precept that a picture tells a thousand words, the film utilizes an economy of songs and dialogue
9;the animated characters are more life.
10;like than most actors, the dialogue, short but effective, the songs and song sequences (Baby Mine, Pink Elephants on Parade, etc.,), poetic and haunting.
11;If anything, the film is chillingly realistic in its portrayal of human cruelty and feelings of isolation and sadness.
12;The movie's happy ending is incredibly uplifting and inspiring.
13;snow White and Fantasia may have been the two movies that made the AFI's list, but for my money, Dumbo is the best Disney film ever made.
14;It is flawless and absolutely brilliant.
15;but I am sure she loved it.
16;It's true that Dumbo isn't a long story and dosen't take alot to process, yet it is loved by everyone who sees it!
17;It's the timeless tale of the baby elephant withe the large ears.
18;They wake up the next morning in a tree and come to the conclusion that Dumbo flew up there.
19;The special features include two animated shorts, A brand new documentary, Concept art, trailers, Baby Mine music video performed by Michael Crawford, a Comentary, and a new 5.1 soundtrack.
20;It takes a while to assemble, but it turns out very cute!
21;The first place that I could find it was on amazon, so I got it for her and she loved it so much that I've watched about 15 times already.
22;Dumbo is a Disney classic that kids still love to watch today.
23;dumbo is one of the classics so you sort of have to show it to your children, but i've never been a huge fan.
24;Ever since I was little, I've enjoyed this movie and now I play it for my kids as well.
25;ray is phenomenal, particularly if you have a high def television.
26;and as always, dumbos big ears.
27;My family loves this movie.
28;If you into Disney movies this is a good addition to the collection.
29;Such a great movie, I love that it came to Blu.
30;ray, so happy with it, great for the whole family!
31;in any case, the movie, as short as it is, is still a classic and is worth owning if you are into Disney films and have kids.
32;Even though it lacks the adult humor and sophistication of today's modern animation and certainly isn't as polished the modern computer aided visuals are, the writing, especially in the movies songs, is well done and allows the movie to stand as solid entertainment.
33;the sequence Pink Elephants on Parade is perhaps one of animations greatest ever, and its dated art, while placing it the period it was done, is still outstanding and worth the price of admission by itself.
34;The crows singing about never seeing an elephant fly is another great musical sequence.
35;For an example of Disney hacking up the classics, see the new edited version of Fantasia.
36;Dumbo is one of the greatest Disney classics in Disney history!
37;The ridicule continues until one day Timothy J. Mouse offers Dumbo a peanut and a grand friendship is formed.
38;Timothy J. Mouse and Dumbo learn that there are struggles in life but if one works hard enough, one can overcome any obstacle and achieve greatness.
39;Dumbo, with his friend and the help of a few crows learns to soar to new heights and become the world's greatest flying elephant.
40;This was a Chirstmas gift for my daughter.
41;She is 21 years old and loves it.
42;I watched these movies wit my children over nd over again and nothing comes as close to entertainment and imagination as these early Disney classics.
43;It even included animal cards in perfect condition and original packing.
44;I was delighted with this product.
45;I forgot exactly how sad it was but it is still a great movie.
46;My kids and I sat and watched it together the day after Christmas.
47;They loved it and I loved sharing it with them.
48;I loved this movie as a kid and now my toddler loves it too.
49;We call our son Peanut and elephants eat peanuts and well, Dumbo is an elephant!
50;It's always been a childhood favorite of mine and now is his too!
51;eared, baby elephant, cherished by his mother, mistreated by nearly everyone else and eventually victorious, addressed themes of maternal love, perseverance, and self.
52;Overall, this Big Top edition gives Dumbo the well.
53;deserved treatment its hero received at the end of the film.
54;It's indispensable for Disney fans, an essential diamond among children's films.
55;Another Movie that the whole family can enjoy great story Elaphant born with huge ears and his story in it a must see
56;Made a classic movie look new.
57;The absolute best of the Disney animated feature films.
58;The special features including the making of this classic are wonderful
59;It was sorrow and beautiful.
60;The story of Dumbo told the children that mother's love is pure and deep, and it will last forever.
61;The story told us that we should learn how to love people around us.
62;And it told mothers that children need mother's love no matter they are young or grew up.
63;I enjoyed this cartoon it is so cute I think that Dumbo was so cute especially when his ears would flop open he is so adorable I really did like Dumbo he is a cute and sweet elephant and helps out whenever he is needed .
64;Dumbo was very shy but he was so cute !!!!!
65;I remember really feeling for this movie as a child and it striking some sad notes in me.
66;It had the potential to be a great film that tugs at your heartstrings and has a little historical background.
67;It's in good conditioner and came on time.
68;This movie might be old but it's the best old movie I've ever seen.
69;It's sad when Dumbo has his mother taken away from him and it's heart.
70;The mouse who becomes Dumbo's friend is funny.
71;That part is so cute.
72;You're truly a Disney fan if you like this movie!
73;This movie brought back childhood memories.
74;I liked watching this movie very much.
75;It's one of Disney's shortest films, being only a little more than an hour, but it packs so much heart into it.
76;The 60th anniversary of dumbo is better in the sense it still captures the warmth, moving and funny that makes the original standout.
77;He starts to shead tears, and the audience uproars with laughter.
78;inner strength, friendship, and love conquers all.
79;The Pink Elephants and Baby Mine scenes are still classics.
80;The most touching scene in movie history, of course, is when Jumbo Jr. sees his mother in jail, and the song, Baby Mine , is played.
81;No matter how many times you watch this film, who has a dry eye when Mrs. Jumbo sings Baby Mine to Dumbo and gently rocks him in her trunk through the bars of her prison?
82;What's even more amazing is that the star of this feature never utters a word or makes a sound.
83;Dumbo (60th Anniversary Edition) is one Disney's true classic animated movies.
84;The scene Baby Mine is one that brings a tear to ones eye and yes I admit I cried during that scene.
85;The animation is amazing and the storyline is just as good as other classics such as Pinocchio, Cinderella and Snow white and the seven dwarfs.
86;This movie will be enjoyed by generations of children for come as the message is ever green.
87;I remember watching this as a VERY little girl!
88;It always seemed so safe and innocent even though Dumbo was separated from his mom.
89;And I definitely agree that adults, esp.
90;it's kind of like a semi.
91;can find something poignant and/or endearing in the movie Dumbo !
92;the colors burst with a newfound brilliance and the linework is beautiful and defined.
93;The Pink Elephants scene looks even more amazing in high definition.
94;Great classic movie that can be shared with the entire family.
95;Animation and color is wonderful as you would expect from this Disney vintage movie.
96;restored as Snow White was for the digital realm, the movie looks and sounds better than ever.
97;Being a 60th anniversary edition, Disney also jam.
98;packed the disc with extra features, including a disturbing look at the upcoming Dumbo II.
99;Dumbo is wonderful, and HIGHLY recommended!
100;The simple, straightforward story of Dumbo (or more accurately, Jumbo Jr.) still has the power to move audiences even after 60 years.
101;This film works on all levels from art direction, color, mood, animation, character design score and song to the bizzare set piece Pink Elephants on Parade that dazzilingly displays the artists talents (in my opinion, one of the greatest segments ever animated).
102;Truly a Disney treasure and one that everyone from 3 to 103 can enjoy over and over again.
103;The film has been lovingly restored and looks more bright and colorful than ever!
104;If you want a more detailed and comprehensive look at it's creation check out the commentary which gives you plenty of new information and insight.
105;Also the conceptual drawings are fun to scroll through.
106;The film has been beautifully restored and there are many worthwhile extras all packed onto one disc.
107;Dumbo, the fourth movie of the Disney Canon, is one of the Disney classics that everyone should watch and own.
108;A baby elephant with unusually large ears is born in a circus.
109;it is thru his dream that he finds out he can use his ears to fly!
110;He returns to the circus determined to use his newfound ability to show everyone that he can be a valuable member of the elephant herd.
111;And, of course, he succeeds.
112;this movie takes you back to the days when circuses really did travel mostly by rail from town to town and created huge sensations when they arrived.
113;The tenderness between Dumbo and his mother are priceless.
114;The scenes of Mrs. Jumbo rioting in the circus when her baby seems threatened are fairly true to life.
115;He gets all of his emotions across with a look or a gesture.
116;this tale teaches courage in the face of failure, loyalty in the face of adversity, and a triumph of a handicap over the troubles of life.
117;the animation is simplistic, but fun.
118;release!The colors are very vibrant and eye.
119;It looks a lot more like a cartoon, but with the famous Disney eye for detail.
120;The Pink Elephant sequence will have you wondering what the Disney animators were thinking of .
121;it is probably the most memorable animated sequence of all time, and also serves as a great anti.
122;Watch this sequence carefully .
123;It also includes a sneak peek at the upcoming Dumbo II.
124;Great for grandkids and the whole family.
125;I received the product in a timely manner.
126;I had to take a chance and order another one, because my son is so fond of the movie, which I finally received.
127;I always loved this film, but I always assumed it was taken for granted by most people and, like it's title character, considered the runt of the illustrious library of Disney classic feature cartoons.
128;Dumbo is elegant in its simplicity, honesty, humor, and positive message of hope.
129;It may just become something very personal for you as it did for me.
130;I bought this video for my grandson, and he loves it.
131;He is 2 years old and he understands the closeness of Dumbo and his mother.
132;It is a must for the little ones.
133;Dumbo really is an animated film for adults.
134;It contains many adult themes surrounding the innocent story line of baby elephant learns to believe in himself and takes to the air.
135;Dumbo is ostracized from his elephant community purely because of the size of his ears.
136;there is a touching part of the film.
137;She reaches out with her trunk and cradles her baby elephant for a few short moments.
138;It is a bittersweet moment, one that is sure to bring tears to those of us who have babies.
139;Perhaps it is an interesting film for its historical representation of how the world used to be in the unenlightened times only a few decades ago.
140;I was very pleased that I received the video so quickly.
141;wrapped and in perfect condition.
142;Dumbo is the story of a baby elephant born with enormous ears.
143;this movie has much to recommend it.
144;Its message of treating those with differences or handicaps fairly and kindly is important for everyone to hear.
145;best of all, it has some wonderful musical numbers.
146;Baby Mine still brings tears to my eyes all these years later, and When I See an Elephant Fly is hysterically funny to those old enough to understand the word play.
147;But Pink Elephants has got to be one of the most inventive and clever numbers ever devised.
148;The constantly morphing elephants of this sequence were all hand.
149;Adults will know better and will be able to enjoy the clever word play in the song.
150;another caution is that the stork delivers the circus animal babies.
151;thank you for sending it so quickly.
152;This was my favorite as I grew up, now it is a favorite of all my kids , family friends, and multiple family members
153;It arrived in good time in a well.
154;Wanting to make sure it would be perfect, since it wasn't brand.
155;, I opened it and watched it.
156;No scratches on the disc and it played wonderfully!
157;My two year old likes this move.
158;He love it when Dumbo finds out he can fly.
159;He tells me he looks so free.
160;Disney has always made great movies and i have always watched disney movies and still do and dumbo is one of those movies that are worth having and watching .
161;This classic movie is one of my daugher's favorites.
162;She has watched it so much that we have had to replace thedisc once so far, and she is only 2 1/2!!!!
163;Great movie from Walt Disney that I wanted to have in Blu.
164;One must, of course, 1st address the jive.
165;And they're damn witty to boot.
166;flying takes up, at the very most, the last 10 minutes of the story.
167;inviting despair and humiliation, with the nightmarish and brilliant Pink Elephants on Parade the only respite.
168;Disney's effort to cut costs after the financial failures of PINOCCHIO and FANTASIA results in a clean, lean yet stylized look.
169;I bought this classic movie to add to my 3 year old son's growing Disney movie collection.
170;He loves it and so do his mom and dad!
171;Now though that I have kids I love that I can re.
172;live the Disney Classics with them, as well as the new movies that come out!
173;The colors are so vibrant and you would not think it is a 70.
174;with great animation, characters, and songs, Dumbo is a classic not to miss.
175;With my boys being 3 and 4, having the 70th Anniversary Edition came at a great time!
176;most classic Disney movies operate on several levels of understanding.
177;probably you saw and liked the movie when you were a kid, and you will see the greater wisdom intertwined in the story later as an adult.
178;in a dramatic yet softened by hope and new opportunities, way, this movie is about losses that happen to everyone.
179;it demonstrates that you can survive the losses, and you can go on with your life and get fun back if you make the effort to move on.
180;watch this by yourself, with adults or with your kids.
181;Like many Disney animated films, this one has a moral.
182;But of course, in the end, Timothy's faith, Dumbo's courage, and Mrs. Jumbo's love prevail, and they roll off into the sunset to the happy strains of the crows' song.
183;A classic that all families should own, whether there are kids around or not.
184;As a classic, I got this for my daughter.
185;She loved the songs and the animation.
186;Still a classic in my book!
187;This is a great movie for the whole family.
188;My kids enjoy all the DIsney movies and I really like the older classic ones alot.
189;It's such a Disney classic.
190;My youngest is 12 and still enjoys watching this movie.
191;My four year old daughter giggled her way through this movie!
192;Loved it and kept her occupied for a portion of a long road trip.
193;My toddlers love this movie.
194;It arrived when promised and in perfect condition.
195;A must for any disney fan.
196;I'm not entirely sure why, but they've always held a special place in my heart.
197;I'm a massive Looney Tunes fan and tend to love any sort of cartoon that was released in the 40s or 50s.
198;One of the reasons I wanted to explore Dumbo on Blu.
199;For being 70 years old, Dumbo looks really fantastic.
200;The music seems to capture the essence of the 40s so well, which is probably mostly due to its harmony and barber shop.
201;good, which I found kind of interesting.
202;Dumbo does pretty much the exact opposite of making you feel good nearly its entire 63.
203;Dumbo gets separated from his mother, he gets made fun of, he messes up, he gets made fun of again, he gets drunk, he gets made fun of some more.
204;Even the other clowns make fun of him without even trying to.
205;It's also intriguing that Dumbo is the only male elephant in the picture.
206;But it also made it that much easier to sympathize with the little guy.
207;dream sequences are another thing that have always piqued my interest.
208;Bending reality in any way, shape, or form is just a fascinating concept.
209;It walks this fine line of being both goofy and terrifying.
210;They're enjoyable characters that deliver one of the best songs in the film.
211;I have this thing about admiring cartoon birds and Jim Crow is right up there with Daffy Duck and Donald Duck as far as I'm concerned.
212;Its animation is still crisp, colorful, and impressive to this day and its music is spectacular.
213;Despite being the shortest Disney major motion picture, Dumbo is still one of the best.
214;ray is loaded with special features.
215;It's a pretty fantastic sequence and would've been a welcome addition to the film to at least make its duration slightly longer.
216;There's a nearly thirty minute documentary.
217;type feature called Taking Flight: The Making of Dumbo that is fairly informative of what things were like behind the scenes.
218;Sound Design Excerpt from The Reluctant Dragon is really cool.
219;Two games round out the special features.
220;Both are a race against the clock and can be played by one person or the entire family.
221;dumbo is rated G and is suitable for all ages.
222;It's such a cute movie.
223;I love the crows .
224;they're just so ornery in the beginning and I love how the main crow talks!
225;And that song, When I See An Elephant Fly, is just great.
226;all in all, it's a great film and a true classic to add to your collection.
227;This is without doubt one of the finest films to come out of Disney ever.
228;Short(only 64 minutes long), but very to the point, and always pulling those heart strings.
229;This is one of those rare films that makes me cry every time I watch it, and if you don't get all misty during the visit at the train car scene with Mrs. Jumbo, you need to seek professional help.
230;Being a tall person, I always stand out in a crowd, and that's not always been pleasant.
231;I have tremendous love and respect for my mother, and it would hurt me terribly to have her removed from me, so I'm deeply moved by the whole film, even thought I know it's all just fantasy.
232;Fantasy?This is just a short, sweet film with a whole lot of heart that proves that all is needed is a story, and believable charactors to fall in love with, and care for, and cheer for.
233;I love Dumbo and in this Blu.
234;ray disc version it really does look remastered!
235;This movie is one of my favorites!
236;Love this movie and always will!
237;I have various Disney movies and this is the best one for toddlers as it does not contain the thematic and real violence of a Peter Pan, nor sibling bickering like in Cinderella nor a too.
238;Instead it is innocent and very positive in its message of overcoming your weaknesses and of self.
239;Aside from this, this movie is a masterpiece for people of all ages.
240;The next best ones for toddlers are maybe Cinderella and The Jungle Book and when they are a little older Little Mermaid and Alice in Wonderland.
241;My daughter loves this movie, and would watch it all day everyday if we let her (she is 2), she cant go to sleep unless she watches elephants .
242;this is an awesome movie and i highly reccomend it to all children to watch, as well as all adults, it also has an underlying message, dont judge somebody on how they look
243;When my grandson gets older, he will most likely enjoy this movie.
244;If nothing he looks at the colors right now and is hearing the sounds.
245;I love how, even in this beautiful cartoon, there is family drama and plenty of conflict .
246;yet the main character conquers.
247;Teaching young children strong characteristics like this via mediums like this is part of a colorful childhood.
248;Disney classic, a must have for families.
249;For some reason, I never saw most of the Disney classic movies when I was growing up .
250;but I'm certainly having a good time watching them all these years later.
251;Dumbo, of course, may be the most beloved Disney film of them all .
252;The film's popularity is due in large part to the story itself, as there is a little bit of Dumbo in all of us.
253;everyone knows the story already.
254;Dumbo is also a story about love, particularly the love between a mother and child, and the importance of friendship.
255;classic Disney films such as this are both wonderful and remarkable .
256;I imagine that children, while they will certainly understand the themes of this story, don't connect to the film on the same emotional level as I do as an adult.
257;I really got emotional watching this .
258;This classic animated film is everything you would expect from Walt Disney .
259;its a film ahead of its time with great music and a great story that is feel good and heartwarming and sometimes a little sad .
260;Was able to track the package right to my home.
261;, The Dark Knight, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers etc.), this is my all time favorite movie.
262;This is Walt Disney at his best.
263;The characters are entertaining, especially Timothy Mouse for helping our young, speechless hero.
264;Dumbo is one of the cutest animated characters and struggles throughout the movie because of his deformity.
265;The animation is outstanding, especially the Pink Elephants sequence and the sequence when the elephants stand on the ball and then the circus is destroyed.
266;The songs fit well into the plot of the film and aren't shoehorned in.
267;The most tearful/touching scenes are when Dumbo is with his mother, the Baby Mine sequence imparticular.
268;Its unfortunate that this and Song of the South are labled as racist films along with the great Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry cartoons.
269;My favorite Movie (except Fantasia) of Disney's.
270;Dumbo is one of disney's most beloved and classic films of all time.
271;this movie is great for everyone.
272;Well all in all this movie is great.
273;the art is breathtaking, soft, and for the most part, simple.
274;Beautifully drawn, and yet, very Daliesque and scary.
275;besides, I look at it this way.
276;Social outcasts embracing a social outcast.
277;dumbo is a triumph over adversity, not a racist statement.
278;Great kids classic a must have for any Disney fan, I bought for my wife and grandkid and they loved watching it many times
279;The anniversary edition is awesome, with remastered artwork, many scenes are much more visible than previous versions, but BEWARE.
280;old loves to watch the storks, Casey the Train and watch Dumbo fly but he asks me to fast.
281;the big ears in this movie is so cute and yes I'm a grown adult but I love my Disney movies
282;At some points it gets a tad slow, but overall it's a good message.
283;It was 1941 and with Disney having its first successful animated film with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs back in 1938, unfortunately its next two films Pinocchio and Fantasia would not be the big box office hits that Disney had wanted.
284;in fact, the two films hurt Disney financially and now with the studio hurting, their fourth feature Dumbo was created with the idea of keep things economical with a tight budget and because of that, they had to focus on simplicity.
285;since its release, Dumbo has been considered a timeless Disney classic and will now be released in a 70th Anniversary Edition via Blu.
286;vIDEO:With the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio and Fantasia on Blu.
287;Dumbo was created simplistic and with a lower budget than the previous three films but the overall character designs are crisp and the background still look beautiful and well.
288;up restoration in which Disney restored each cel and are giving us the best presentation of the film yet!
289;Dumbo looks absolutely fantastic on Blu.
290;ray and yes, even the drunken Dumbo scene looks vibrant than ever before.
291;but the 7.1 lossless soundtrack is fantastic.
292;Also, features a brief interview with Coleman.
293;(14:53) Featuring a featurette with Deja, Roy E. Disney, Don Hahn, Rudy Behlmer and film critic Leonard Maltin talking about Dumbo.
294;(3:08) Witness the excitement and magic of Disneyland`s most popular ride through the eyes of a child.
295;(5:56) A classic featurette on the sound design for The Reluctant Dragon.
296;Featuring a trivia challenge which you can play via using your remote.
297;Especially now that we have a son, it's a film that we can share with our child and now enjoy especially with this beautiful restoration that Disney had given to this film.
298;beautiful and vibrant, when I first watched this film on Blu.
299;ray releases and also giving fans the best looking and sounding versions of these Disney animated classics yet.
300;Dumbo is a touching story and I can remember as a child wondering if the fate of Dumbo's mother would be similar to Bambi's situation.
301;But having watched this film for countless times during my near 30+ years, this animated film is timeless.
302;but still, this is the definitive version of Dumbo to own at this time.
303;ray compared to what is included in Dumbo, the other three definitely offered much more bonus content.
304;with that being said, Dumbo: 70th Anniversary is a fantastic, timeless Disney animated classic and because Disney really went all out in terms of look and sound, this Blu.
305;ray release deserves to be watched and owned by fans of the film!Highly recommended!
306;Dumbo is, quite simply, one of the greatest films of all time
307;The movie is a masterpiece of animated, economical and, above all, emotional storytelling.
308;Lacking confidence, Dumbo is told that a magic feather held in his trunk will make him fly.
309;Back at the circus, the feather is dropped and Timothy reveals it was just a psychological device.
310;Timothy tells him he could fly all the time, if he will just open up his ears and BELIEVE in himself.
311;Dumbo's triumph is especially sweet, because the audience has suffered along with Dumbo.
312;Our tears are honestly shed, and our smiles at his victory are joyous.
313;Dumbo is Disney's most unpretentious classic
314;Dumbo is a perfectly emotionally balanced film
315;The music is another great aspect of the film.
316;Casey Jr. establishes the perfect circus mood.
317;Pink Elephants On Parade is a wild, surreal sequence.
318;Best of all is a 28 Minute Making Of Dumbo documentary, detailing how Walt Disney found Dumbo at a time of great financial crisis.
319;Lacking the high art pretentiousness of Fantasia, Dumbo is, converesly emotional art, and the public took Dumbo, released just before Pearl Harbor and America's involvement in World War II, to heart immediately.
320;Dumbo is always in my heart.
321;Our grandchildren love this movie, I remember this from when I was young.
322;Great clear picture and voices.
323;This is a classic that I think every family should have.
324;I love this movie and it always makes me cry.
325;I would recommend this movie to anybody with children of all ages!
326;For me, the most interesting thing about Dumbo is it's history.
327;What's trueley remarkable about Dumbo is that the main character never talks, but is able to express so much emotion.
328;The scene where Mrs. Jumbo is cradeling Dumbo with her trunk from inside her jail cell is one of the most touching moments in Disney history.
329;The picture and sound is restored and the special features are pretty good.
330;This is probably my favorite of all my 3.
331;It is great for a mom and child to watch together (lots of mommy.
332;The music is outstanding, even the in.
333;I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed it when it first came out.
334;Have always loved the Disney movies, now with a Grand Daughter, I can indulge her and me at the same time.
335;Starting a Disney collection for her to enjoy as much as I did.
336;Gotta love the old Disney movies.
337;Very good color and sound.
338;But they do have Disney view which adds cool borders that change through out the movie.
339;Dumbo was Walt's fourth film but is also one of the most remembered, well.
340;known and loved movies that has come from the studio.
341;It's simple short story about a little elephant with big ears that overcome all the obstacles to become a success is still as poignat, cheerful and delightful as it was 70 years ago.
342;The film is Disney's shortest and yet is more powerful than many other films that run more time than this one.
343;The relationship between Dumbo and his mother is both happy and heartbreaking and you can't help but being deeply moved in the Baby Mine sequence even if you've seen it several times.
344;Also, this movie showcases one of the best surreal sequences ever put into film: Pink Elephants on Parade is wacky, beautiful and nonsensical in a wonderful way.
345;Values like friendship, love, courage and more are all over the film and makes it even stronger and better.
346;dumbo is simply a classic.
347;video and AudioDumbo arrives on BD looking absolutely spectacular.
348;The restoration given to this film is up there with other Disney films like Fantasia, Snow White and Bambi
349;Colors are well reproduced and pop out the screen, clarity and detail is sharp and contrast is strong.
350;Clarity again is striking and directionality is well reproduced.
351;bonus Features:There is plenty of bonus features bothe new and old that you will enjoy:First you have Cinema.
352;The PIP presentation is very well done, engaging and should not be missed.
353;In here, the trio discusses the production of Dumbo, its style, release and success.
354;then you have a making of documentary Taking Flight: The Making of Dumbo which is essentially an extension of the PIP comentary but it's also very interesting to watch.
355;closing ThoughtsDumbo is one of Disney's most beloved classics and its impact hadn't diminished in its 70 years of existence.
356;It is a beautiful film.
357;It's like watching a full length feature of moving portraits.
358;I know the graphical Disney movies today are much brighter and colorful , but something about those old water painted cells is more appealing to me.
359;anyway, Dumbo is a wonderful tale of dealing with the grief of being ostracized.
360;People keep complaining about the Pink Elephant scene and the Crowes.
361;These days the Disney animators just try to amaze viewers with what is pleasing to the eyes, and forget about the story.
362;They did this movie by hand!
363;Any one without a heart will grow one with that movie.
364;It has all the depth, artistry and wit of Fantasia.
365;It was one of the first, if not the first, of the great Disney musicals.
366;Disney's 4th Animated film gets a really nice treatment for its 70th Anniversary Blu Ray and it's the first release that enabled me to sell the previous edition.
367;Dumbo has a simple story, but it's also one of Disney's more unique animated films.
368;It's filled with eye poping animation, the circus scenes are loud and proud, scenes of Dumbo and his mother are handled touchingly and thank you Disney for not deeming it necessary to edit this film.
369;If you must own Dumbo, the 70th Anniversary edition Blu Ray is by far and away the best release.
370;This movie is the greatest!
371;I am 13 and still love this movie.
372;Even though it's short, it is still a great movie.
373;It's a great movie to watch if your kid has short attatand(sp) span.
374;I remember it well from my youth, from my children's youth, and I even like it now.
375;What's amazing about Disney's 4th feature, Dumbo , is that it is probably one of the most simple looking animated features of all time, yet it is one of the best.
376;Dumbo instead relys on a good story, that I'm sure you are fimiliar with.
377;A simple, but rich 64 minutes telling the story of a baby elephant with big ears, that is an outcast.
378;It claims to have a remastered picture, but there is so much grain, and dirt throughout the feature.
379;The extras are great: the commentary is very informative, the concept arts are interesting, and Celebrating Dumbo is a good enough featurette.
380;Inferior by existing Disney video sequel reputation, Dumbo II is on it's way.
381;So it is one of the important stepping blocks of Disney's history and one of the most enjoyable animated features of all time.
382;This movie has a lot of heart and the artistry of the animation is first.
383;There's something more human or fluid to hand generated animation.
384;this is a great film for kids and the kid in all of us.
385;Never saw the movie and loved it.
386;It brought to life some great childhood memories.
387;Disney does make great movies.
388;The item was on time and looks great!
389;I remember watching it when I was 5 years old and to this day I absolutely LOVE it!!
390;And the cruelty to animals and the big ears.
391;The bigger picture is so much more!!
392;I LOVE DUMBO (^.^)
393;This is a moral movie and can help a little one on their way to a good value system.
394;and this moviehas sparked some great little conversations between us.
395;If you've read some of the reviews bellow, you'll notice a lot of defending of this film going on.
396;discuss how Dumbo perseveres despite the opinions of others.
397;extremely pure and simple story.
398;Elephants on Parade is a real Trip.
399;It is more remarkable when you consider the lack of computer technology at the time.
400;coated as you would ever want, which is why people love this film.
401;black and White Sound stage clip from The Reluctant Dragon is pretty cool.
402;i certainly would not ban my kids from seeing an imaginative art piece like Dumbo.
403;So I bought him this movie.
404;I was happy when I put this movie in my VCR and it worked.
405;I was excited to have a working video of a movie classic.
406;I really enjoyed seeing this movie again and remembering some of the scenes I had forgotten.
407;My five year old granddaughter along with her older siblings thoroughly enjoyed Dumbo and I thank Disney for reissuing it for new generations to enjoy.
408;A simple journey through insanity, foster care, experimentation with drugs, and the journey of celebrity.
409;in truth, an excellent children's film.
410;One of my favorite disney movies and the part with Jumbo always makes me cry.
411;I knew his mom tried to protect him and got taken away, he learned to fly with a feather, he made friends with a mouse, and I remembered the creep pink elephants he sees.
412;Good Disney movie and was in great condition.
413;Kids will find this to be a favorite and will enjoy watchying it over and over.
414;The 60th anniversary edition pretty much covered the gamut of bonus features and improved animation.
415;the story of a baby elephant named Dumbo with big ears who is treated as if he was freak by the other elephants remains timeless as ever.
416;With the help of his mouse friend Timothy, Dumbo comes to terms with his unique physical appearance and eventually comes to appreciate his rather large ears.
417;After all these years, I still enjoy Dumbo as much as I did the first time I saw it in elementary school.
418;Baby Mine still gets to me after all these years.
419;this version of Dumbo is definitely geared more towards the younger generation with the games and activities, music, and bonus shorts.
420;Dumbo is an excellent movie.
421;It is my favorite Disney movie ever.
422;I felt so sad when Dumbo cried, and it really shows how much kids/animals love their mothers.
423;This is an excellent movie for kids and adults.
424;the kids love this movie.
425;I believe I truly drove my family mad with the constant replaying.
426;It has however been many years since I watched it.
427;It is packed with a delightful range of characters from cheeky birds to loving and mean elephants.
428;Before you know it they will be singing along with all the songs.
429;So sit back and enjoy!!
430;A great movie for the kids, though I wish there was more music throughout.
431;the animations and storyline are both great.
432;My kids enjoy the movie and love to watch it again, and again.
433;The transaction was completed with ease and I received the blue ray promptly.
434;This is such an incredibly adorable Disney classic.
435;ho very happy to have found it.
436;fun to watch with kids lovely nice story I highly recommend it I give you more than five stars !!!!!
437;When it comes to family movies and fun, its hard to beat Disney.
438;Great picture and great sound
439;Even though it was a gift for a grandson, I opened it and checked it out.
440;I had not seen it for sixty years, but it is as touching as ever.
441;The Circus Museum at the Ringling Museum of Art has a miniature circus and lots of posters and costumes.
442;His artist father will appreciate the graphics though.
443;now my son is enjoying it too.
444;ray resolution but with original old.
445;As charming, thoughtful and endearing as ever, ageless.
446;Maybe even more pertinenet in today's world than when first issued, with it's themes of acceptances, bullying and believing in oneself.
447;Love this film when I was 7, love it even more for my grandchildren and me too at 70.
448;The best part of Dumbo is seeing the delight on my 3 year old's face as he watches it.
449;He gets especially tickled during the bubbles scene.
450;As for me, I am moved during the Baby Mine scene.
451;Overall, Dumbo is a wonderful story about maternal love, innocence and friendship.
452;I have been able to enjoy this with my two year old granddaughter on numerous occassionsDumbo (Big Top Edition)
453;Dumbo really looks magnificent in this 70th Anniversary restored version, especially with Blu.
454;ray, but what really delights me is the presence of an excellent new audio commentary.
455;The commentators is historian Paula Sigman, master animator Andreas Deja and Pixar director Pete Docter.
456;ray, but there are a few extra games, galleries and cartoons exclusively on the Blu.
457;The biggest addition is the entertaining Disney View system which adds visuals on your computer while the film runs in real time).
458;The color and animation are dazzling.
459;Hard to beleive the work Disney undertook to create the stunning display of color in 1940!
460;The restoration has made this even enjoyable for my four year old to enjoy some 68 years later.
461;And, the high definition transfer is so good that it could make you believe the movie came out a couple of years ago.
462;Beautifully remastered and a children's classic!
463;Got it for myself and enjoyed the movie so much!
464;just got it for the kids because it's Disney.
465;nonetheless, I will be replacing the Dumbo movie with the Aristocats and I will never, ever give a child a classic Disney movie without viewing it first again.
466;This item work very good.
467;This company has great and fast customer service.
468;They definitely take care of their customers.
469;that would be enough, but there is more to recommend this edition.
470;The featurette also discusses the motiff of the animation and the pastel colors that are utilized and the pastoral look.>
471;Elmer Elephant suffers and is transformed through a similar plight as Dumbo, and it is a nice cartoon to see.
472;The mouse takes over Dumbo's mother's role, and supports, guides and protects the persecuted young pachyderm while the Crows instruct him in the art of flying with the help of the 'magic feather'.
473;THERE'S UNIQUENESS IN US ALL!Dumbo is a wonderfully uplifting film that does have its sad and disturbing moments.
474;The songs are wonderful, heart.
475;rending and move the story forward, which really books.
476;I like being able to find classic movies for a good price.
477;All it once you will laugh, cry, be delighted and scared, and cheer alongside the exploits of little Dumbo and his pal Timothy.
478;warming (and at times heart.
479;A magnificent movie and a thoroughly entertaining classic, you must see Dumbo.
480;Bring peanuts and a box of tissues.
481;I can't find a date for when an English packaged Dumbo will be released, so as long as this will play in English, I will still give it as a gift for my husband.
482;In fact, the disc label itself is in English.
483;it is in English with the options of Spanish, and Portuguese.
484;my oldest daughters favorite movie and my vhs wore out.
485;I bought for her at christmas and she was tickled to get her childhood favorite movie.
486;It as family fun movie and even as an adult you don't get tired of watching a cartoon classis.
487;thank you to the seller for a grand overall experience in all areas.
488;73 years old and still a winner!
489;My 2 year old granddaughter loved it and wanted to watch it over and over.
490;A true Disney Classic to be shared for generations.
491;A family movie to hand down.
492;A heartwarming story for one and all
493;My favorite scene is when Dumbo and the mouse fall into the well and his wine in it.
494;I love the little extras on the Blue Ray.
495;I surely recommend this item.
496;up however I love Disney Animation) and one for my niece.
497;She loves Dumbo, watching the video many times, especially the cartoons included.
498;Mostly due to the memories and emotions tied with it.
499;Dizney's 'Dumbo' is super kool.
500;the best part was when he trumped those good for nuthin clowns.
501;clowns more than most like to make fun of people and can have a callous sense of humour.
502;something all the Dumbo's of the world should do.
503;maybe one day all that meaness will come back to you.
504;This is a classic, a must have for anyone!
505;All Disney classics like this are must haves!!
506;I love this movie so much.
507;i loved this movie as a child and recently rediscovered it while visiting with my two year.
508;oh, and my niece, she squealed with delight for Dumbo's triumphs each time and paid serious attention to the sad parts where mother and child are separated.
509;overall, though the touching story of an outcast only a mother could love and his triumph over his tormentors is timeless.
510;Dumbo has it all heart,emotion,humor,great animation and so much more!!!
511;The Pink Elephants On Parade sequence is quite colorful groovy,and to think this was before the groovy colorful sixties,Austin Powers probably dug this movie!!!
512;Disney animation at it's very finest!!!
513;A treat for everyone,young and old everyone in between!!!
514;By the way this is Leonard Maltin's favorte Disney film,and it's mine too!!!
515;Even at that age I loved the movie and I still find myself humming the song 'See an elephant fly'.
516;A superb movie of which I don't remember much except that it moved me so much.
517;As a Disney classic, I still love it, and my 3 year old daughter couldn't take her eyes off the movie.
518;I recommend this for anyone who loves Disney, or who have kids that love cartoons.
519;I bought it for my granddaughter who loves elephants.
520;It was in perfect condition when it arrived and I received it very quickly.
521;The best moment was the crows.
522;There is nothing I can add to all of the heartfelt and insightful reviews I've seen on this site.
523;But I've yet to see a sample of its international reknown.
524;Check it out!At the 1947 Cannes Film Festival DUMBO won the Palm D'Or.
525;I think that it was a very good movie.
526;I watched it with my 5 year old nephew and he enjoyed it also.
527;My child was so happy to open it on Christmas morning!
528;Thanks for a great job.
529;My daughter loves this movie!
530;She is 2 years old and fascinated with elephants.
531;The move arrived promptly and is a great show.
532;It is a gift for my sister in law
533;Dumbo is another timeless classic that can't be beat.
534;It's sad for a while, but happy endings always prevail!
535;We just love this big.
536;great show for kids and adults.
537;jim this should be shown at theatres reviving my youth dumbo is a great movie from disney
538;(The title is my favorite line in the movie, spoken by Timothy Mouse to Dumbo.)
539;This animated movie about a sweet.
540;eyed baby elephant got a strong emotional reaction from me.
541;The songs were memorable, especially Baby Mine.
542;That aspect of the movie is what got to me.
543;The artists clearly convey the love that Dumbo and his mother have for each other, as well as the sadness they feel over the events that transpire.
544;Dumbo is a wonderful movie, and there are many topics to be discussed after watching it, important topics that should be discussed in families.
545;I just want to be sure that she has the emotional maturity to express what she's feeling and discuss it with me.
546;honestly, Dumbo is a Disney film worth owning.
547;feature (running just over one hour) remains a powerful, poignant family film, offering kids a clear and useful lesson on the virtues of tolerance.
548;The empathy we feel for this misfit elephant only makes his ultimate triumph more satisfying.
549;A defining classic in Disney's film legacy.
550;Maybe it's just me, but seeing full cell animation beats the heck out of CGI.
551;Both formats have their charm, but what could be more charming then full animation painted by humans.
552;They are funny and entertaining, so leave them alone.
553;Every home should add this heartwarming movie to their collection.
554;worth of merchandise to get free shipping!
555;***This review may contain spoilers**The best creations of book, cinema, play, in my opinion, realistically and painstakingly portray the indomitablity and ultimate triumph of hope.
556;Disney's emotional classic Dumbo certainly qualifies.
557;It follows the progress of the ultimate underdog, an abandoned, ostracized baby elephant, as he gradually finds his lofty place in the world.
558;His last sliver of hope vanishes.
559;But the movie reassures us that even outcasts can take hope and comfort, usually from other outcasts.
560;The act is successful, but Dumbo is naturally despondent, for he knows he has hit bottom.
561;It takes Tim's arrangement of a visit to his chained mother, and one of the most poignant songs on Earth, Baby Mine, to restore Dumbo's spirits a little.
562;Some spilled champagne from the celebrating clowns sends Dumbo's spirits really high and crush his inhibitions, so the next day he finds himself up a tree with some cackling crows.
563;americans still felt during the '40s.
564;Even so, they make fun of Dumbo as he topples from the tree.
565;The crows offer a solution with a magic feather.
566;Dumbo listens, and soars for real, and gets some relatively gentle but satisfying payback at his tormentors.
567;The circus has a new star, Tim hits the big time, and mother and son are reunited.
568;Dumbo is a fantasy that nevertheless grittingly earns its happy ending, and reassures that, whoever we are, and whatever our circumstances, with courage and hope, we can go up, too!P.
569;As I said, a very minor error in this wonderful film.
570;You can't go wrong with Disney, all the movies are loved by everyone!
571;This one had been loved by one of my own daughters, and is now loved by my grandkids.
572;One of the five best Disney movies, Dumbo is a magificent, heartfelt film that proves one does not require a great budget to make a great movie.
573;Every moment of this movie .
574;are wonderfully crafted, absolutely beautiful, and frequently tear.
575;It's great for long trips since a good movie will keep her occupied.
576;At the time I ordered it Disney didn't release it until recently.
577;So, if you have youngsters, and you need them to be distracted, this is a great tool.
578;This is such a nice Disney movie.
579;The tenderness between mother and child is so sweet and the song Baby Of Mine is charming.
580;One of the best films to come out in the 1940's.
581;Great animation,great storyline,great songs,unforgettable characters and a great moral.
582;There are some racial stereotypes in which I will not name but it is still a great movie to watch.
583;The actual disk should work in English, so I will keep it.
584;Not my favorite of the early Disney anamated videos but worth watching.
585;This is a true classic that our grand daughter asked for at Christmas time.
586;Surprised she had never seen it as she is a high schooler now.
587;But it is a keeper!
588;beautifully remastered classic Dumbo just as my whole family remembers it, and now for a new generation to enjoy.
589;I found this film to be very comforting, as Dumbo does do the things he CAN do and TRIUNPHS.
590;I'm a bigger fan of other Disney characters.
591;But I love the price of this through amazon vs the store.
592;Hurrah!The extras are fitting and informative .
593;I also like the art gallery which is extensive.
594;the sneak peak at Dumbo II is more a sneak peak BEHIND THE SCENES of Dumbo II (no actual animated footage).
595;A lot of it (nice too!)
596;allegory in a Disney film.
597;Just adding to my video collection for my entire family to enjoy.
598;she will tear the house down if she cant watch it.
599;she has her favorite scenes and her worst.
600;I found this in the back of a closet and decided to watch it again.
601;The songs were as classic as the ones in Cinderella and Peter Pan.
602;Anyone of any age will be touched by the scenes in this movie.
603;I was, and I'm thirteen.You will surely love this movie as I do.
604;There story line itself was a great story, overcoming fear on your own and the you can fly without the Feather ideal.
605;Although it doesn't match to the brilliance of Mary Poppins or the technical wizardry of Pinnochio, Dumbo is still a charming animated feature with some of the best visuals put on the screen.
606;The story of the elephant who can fly, imortalized in the Disneyland attraction is a great film.
607;although it does have some truly heartbreaking moments, this is a great family film that teaches children that we should all accept each other for our differences unlike the way some characters in the film behave.
608;this is a great film in my book!
609;I guess it was made in the 1950's and it's got some politically incorrect moments, but I will always love it, and little kids/toddlers love it too.
610;Beautiful art, story, and songs.
611;We all watched it on Sunday and it was just as great as it was when my children saw it years ago!
612;It was an entertaining movie of interest especially to children.
613;Dumbo and Bambi were the 2 Disney movies I remember seeing in the 1940's.
614;I received my video and it was like new in perfect condition.
615;giving this movie as a gift to a little girl who has never seen Dumbo Can't wait to watch her reactions
616;this was a great Movie, I Love all disney movies dumbo happens to be one of my favorites and was glad that I bought this for myself and my family and we can watch it over and over again
617;Got this for My Grandson , I KNOW He will love it .
618;bUT I know he will love it
619;When I See An Elephant Fly is just one of a number of classic songs performed in the short and sweet Walt Disney classic, Dumbo.
620;This wonderfully touching film about a young elephant who doesn't fit in speaks volumes to viewers both young and old.
621;To be honest, these characters are some of the most endearing in my opinion.
622;Their song, When Elephants Fly, is one of my personal Disney favorites.
623;i highly recommend this tale to anyone who's a fan of Disney, anybody with children, and fans of animation as well.
624;Also, I remember being really scared during the dream sequence with the dancing clowns.
625;I first saw it when I was three years old, and I loved it (besides the pink elephant part).
626;I just liked the elephants, the voices, and the music.
627;hold your kid's hand and let them watch this movie.
628;It'll be good for them.
629;Thank you to the seller for helping to make this an easy process!
630;present for a man that loves elephants.
631;I know that he will be very excited!
632;Good movie for small kids of less than 5 year age.
633;It has engaged my son well and he loves it.
634;Some funny type of acid trip.
635;I'll just keep the movie for show.
636;in like new shape
637;Dumbo is very much a classic of animated movies which brings family together in a heartwarming movie great for all ages and a gem to keep
638;Dumbo is my all time favorite Disney movie, and I'm thrilled that it has become one of my 2 year old's favorites too .
639;Its a lovely song, andoverall the movie has the opposite message, of being tolerant to differences in features/characteristics because everyone is special.
640;i love this movie and always watch with my son, and in the fire scene I explain that they are clowns and pretending, though Dumbo doesn't want to be a clown.
641;A mother's love for her darling child forms the heart of this classic animated feature.
642;who is adorable, but has very big ears.
643;As she reaches her trunk through the window bars to console and rock her sobbing infant, and sings a heartwrenching lullaby, you'll undersand why Disney was such a great movie maker (bring your hankie!)
644;Little Dumbo overcomes all odds and shows he can actually fly!
645;This is a funny, sentimental, and whimsical movie
646;see for all Disney fans.
647;my nephews love it too!
648;One of Disney's best known and loved films, DUMBO is about a baby elephant born in the harsh world of the circus who is ridiculed and shut out because of his large ears.
649;A great film that deals with discrimination, self esteem, the importance of family and friendship.
650;Frank Churchill and Oliver Wallace's beautiful score flies from cheery heights to touching melodies.
651;The movie also features a great score, which it won an Oscar for and a nomination for song, the beautiful Baby Mine.
652;The pink elephants scene is a fantastic, priceless slice of animation that I will never forget.
653;Wonderfully done, arguably Disney's best.
654;I had forgotten what a wonderful movie Dumbo is.
655;And it is funny to remember when going to the circus was such a big deal.
656;This is a must for Disney collector's and even if you aren't, this movie is excellent for children.
657;My 6 year old neice loved it.
658;old loves the music
659;Disney is usually a great choice for children.
660;This is an amazing animation story, told in a tender and loving way.
661;It's a touching Disney classic.
662;I've seen it many times and though it's not my favorite, it has some really good scenes.
663;I was very happy with the fast turn around and the great contition.
664;Great movie and one of the best Disney movies ever.
665;This was exactly what I wanted and it came in great condition.
666;I love watching this movie.
667;Despite all its merits, the fine plot, cute characters and beautiful animation, Dumbo has always been regarded as the quintessential baby movie .
668;The way you can come back to it after so many years and realize, hey, this is good stuff.
669;It's a nice secure movie, with none of the scary undertones that colored its predecessors Pinnochio and Snow White.
670;It is eloquent, innocent,and truly a masterpice.
671;It is classic, untarnished Disney.
672;For the first generation of Disney animated films the most emotional moment has been and will always be when Bambi's mother is shot.
673;Consequently, this 1941 film has a couple of compelling universal themes.
674;Then you throw in some solid songs (including Disney does Dali with Pink Elephants on Parade) and a colorful animated train to along with the cute title character and you have a real winner.
675;So this might be the shortest of the Disney animated features, but in its own way it remains one of the most important.
676;You can make the argument that Dumbo is the triumph of the underdog, which does for little boys what the story of the Ugly Duckling does for little girls (we are talking culturally, going back centuries and not about contemporary gender issues).
677;Cinderella just has to become a princess to live happily ever after, but Dumbo has to win the respect of the other elephants by doing something and the important lesson is that he does not change his appearance.
678;The fact that Dumbo does not have to change makes it a valuable lesson for all youngsters.
679;This movie from the 1940's is a true classic, as he is fixated on the music and images.
680;This product came fast and in great condition.
681;The kids love the movie, so no complaints here.
682;My Granddaughter, who is 2 yr old, loves it.
683;She would watch it 2 times a day if we let her.
684;So glad to be able to watch this with her again.
685;Dumbo is as charming as I remember.
686;It is nice to know that you can still get the original movies in a new format, especially all the extras.
687;My kids do not want to watch it ever and it is kind of trippy.
688;She loves this movie and it arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition.
689;I really enjoyed the extras on it.
690;The making and background info is very interesting.
691;The special features on this edition are marvelous, with so many people expressing their sentiments about the movie and what it was meant to be and how much Walt loved it and what an important movie it was for the studio.
692;The movie is an extraordinarily simple story about the imbecilic reasons snobby people invent to hate someone or disregard someone or look down on someone.
693;But I guess the movie is a message of hope that maybe we can hope to change some of the unfair things about the way society works, so that innocent people like Dumbo and his mother can have freedom.
694;He is the ultimate underdog in all of us.
695;What is amazing to me is that here is a character, the main character, who delivers such emotion and reality into his head and heart and he never speaks a word.
696;the Disney animators were brilliant in storyboarding and animating all these characters in the setting of a traveling circus.
697;thanks to one friend, a small mouse, with the spirit and attitude of a major general, Dumbo learns his value, his importance to his mother and what it means to have a true friend.
698;This movie was very special.
699;It has heart and feeling and the most emotive Disney animated character ever that actually never says a word.
700;a. longs for the kids and even two very cute shorts that were originally produced before Dumbo.
701;That Dumbo was and remains a masterpiece in the 21st Century is a bit of an oddity.
702;In a word, it was fun.
703;For the first time in years, the feature animators were able to go back to the sensibilities of cartooning.
704;It is sentimental and wacky at the same time.
705;Keeping costs and complexity down, Dumbo did not rely on breathtaking special effects, but finds its strength in solid character animation and a truly lovable story.
706;Dumbo's friend Timothy the mouse, is a street smart tough guy with a heart of gold.
707;An innocent drunk scene (the water trough is accidentally spiked with booze) told through vivid neon hallucinations and such creative wackiness (as opposed to silliness) that the puns and imagery still play well today.
708;Remember, this is a film of caricatures as opposed to realism.
709;It is fun, sweet and sassy all at once.
710;There is nothing riveting or frightening.
711;just an hour+ of animated joy.
712;through tasteful digital remastering, the films colors and rich nuances literally leap from your video screen.
713;This digital release looks and sounds so good that Uncle Walt himself would be dumbstruck!If you have kids, love animation, or just want an evening of sheer delight, you owe it to yourself to spend an evening with this adorable film.
714;the disc worked, I am happy.
715;coated, and then show them a great movie like this.
716;Disney movies are such a huge part of my life, I don't know what I'd be like if I was banned from watching them.
717;I got this for my grandkids and they love it.
718;I loved it as a child and now as a grandma.
719;I always just thought it was a cool.
720;dumbo has some wonderful lessons in it.
721;Children viewing it will learn to treat animals kindly because it shows them with feelings and emotions.
722;The scenes of Dumbo's mother being whipped and locked up are heart.
723;wrenching, but I think children need to be exposed to things like that.
724;Just thinking about it makes me misty.
725;dumbo is a great movie for children, it is loaded with morals and important life lessons and I can't imagine why anyone would not want to let their child view it.
726;At shortly over an hour of runtime, Dumbo will always leave you wanting to watch it again and again.
727;Yet the combination of it all, with some classic music tracks and unforgettable lines, make out of Dumbo a movie for the ages, one that has survived time, and that will continue to appeal to everyone no matter how old, no matter when.
728;In particular, since I first saw it in Spanish when I was a kid, I loved being able to play the Spanish language track, and relive the dialogues the way I remembered them.
729;This is one of Disney's true enduring classics.
730;A baby elephant is delivered to the delighted Mrs. Jumbo, but he has big ears.
731;i have always loved this movie.
732;The story is simple, but moves quickly and from heart felt emotion to laughter easily.
733;Watching this movie again recently, I was surprised again at how much of the early story to told in song.
734;Baby Mine is one of my favorite Disney songs because of its heartfelt emotion and I love all the puns in When I See an Elephant Fly.
735;This is a truly remarkable movie.
736;Pop some corn, sit back, and joy this classic tale.
737;It arrived within two weeks and in great condition.
738;This is a Christmas gift and it will go wtih her Disney collection.
739;I know she will enjoy the combo set.
740;My 4 year old loves this movie.
741;It's much more colorful, especially in the darker scenes at the beginning when they are setting up the tent in the rain.
742;It's nice to have this movie on high def.
743;Thank you for processing my order so quickly and I also received it quickly.
744;You get to see the WHOLE movie in full and the colors are brighter and you have ALL the great bonus features!
745;Shipment and delivery were great.
746;the movie is short and sweet.
747;My three year old LOVES LOVES LOVES this movie!
748;It amazes me to no end that this movie was made in the early 1900's and is still an amazing hit with small children.
749;Its a timeless classic, you actually think I am going to review it and say something bad?
750;Dumbo is the best Disney Movie besides Sleeping Beauty.
751;Before CGI and constant tip offs to political correctness and the multiculturalist crap Disney has become in the last 20 years there was this, a real and compelling little movie with excellent animation, a beautiful and touching storyline and a short running time that is probably just enough to keep toddlers interested.
752;Everything about this movie is a winner and I easily think this is about as good as the remastered Sleeping Beauty.
753;This is a cute movie, just know that IRL, animals were usually treated worse in a circus, the circus life Dumbo leads here is rather charmed, and I've never heard of a elephant being born in captivity at a circus in real life.
754;It's not a movie I would show young children for several reasons (among them Dumbo getting drunk) but for older kids or adults, this movie can be enjoyable.
755;Great Disney classic from my childhood.
756;I was excited to share it with my very young siblings this past weekend!
757;Pros: Original
758;Brings me back to my childhood!
759;I bought this for a Christmas gift for my children and I can't wait to see their little faces as they watch the movie come to life!
760;I had the pleasure of seeing DUMBO again (after more years than I can remember!)
761;with my nephew, and it was a wonderful experience.
762;It's a beautifully animated film, with a message that speaks to us all.
763;dumbo makes one friend, Timothy the Mouse, who helps Dumbo realize that he can make a contribution.
764;He is reunited with his mother, and is the star of the show.
765;one worth showing to your kids, and it's a great film to watch with your children.
766;It made my sisters day to receive this as a gift.
767;My 2 year old daughters not to crazy about it but for me its a nice reminder of my childhood
768;I loved this movie as a child, and bought it for my 3 year old for Christmas.
769;The pink elephant sequence haunts my memories to this day as one of the best Disney moments in its history.
770;Great movie, then and now!
771;We went for this and are extremely satisfied!
772;This was a gift for my Grandson.
773;Thank you for your attention in this matter.
774;Dumbo has never looked this good before.
775;This is the way a blu should look, fully restored if possible.
776;Disney did a great job with this one.
777;the movie itself is a true classic of course.
778;It can still bring wonderment to audiences because it's a timeless film.
779;This blu ray takes it to another level and as with all disney blu rays , the whole thing is classy and well done.
780;daughter had never seen movie, loved it , watches as one of her favorite movies, she talked about it for days
781;Dumbo basically the movie tells the story of a baby elephant born with birth defect, big ears.
782;He is seen as an outcast from his fellow elephants
783;In the end Dumbo has the last laugh on the people who hurt him.
784;dumbo won the Academy Award in 1942 for Original Music Score.
785;Dumbo is one of Disney's finest movies ever made and gets an AAAAA+++++.
786;Cinderella II: Dreams Come TrueD.
787;This is a classic film.
788;There is a sweet innocence to this film, despite the fact that it was release during one of the darkest periods in world history.
789;Dumbo has historical and artistic significance and will always hold a special place among Disney films.
790;it is amazing that this film was made 65 years ago.
791;This bright, crisp, colorful film with it's excellent soundtrack and music is just captivating.
792;pC, and that is the one place where the film shows it's age.
793;but that just adds to the film now.
794;one sequence that is still freaking me out is the Pink Elephants on parade sequence.
795;Dumbo came in a very timely fashion still in its original packaging.
796;This show is a classic and gives kids a glimpse at bullying taken to a real extreme.
797;This just is something you need if you enjoy Disney movies.
798;Dumbo is the story of the World's cutest baby elephant, with the World's biggest pair of ears!
799;With the help of Timothy, and a local flock of crows, Dumbo develops self respect and self confidence, and learns that the very things that held him down, are going to carry him up, and up, and up!
800;Dumbo becomes the world's first and only Flying Elephant!Dumbo is a true Disney classic!
801;A wonderfully simply and charming tale, told with great music and expert animation!
802;My son loves this movie.
803;The classic Dumbo is a short movie about a cute little elephant who has self.
804;It's a good lesson for kids everywhere .
805;take what other people see as something bad about you and turn it into something positive.
806;there's lots of animals in the animated movie, and we are introduced to most of them at the beginning of the movie.
807;Storks are seen delivering babies everywhere .
808;Animals are more like people then animals.
809;commedy is written in a way that is funny for the adults as well as the children.
810;They have a wild vision.
811;is a pretty sad release for such an enduring classic!
812;It is the fouth full lenth animated feature from the studio and should be treated with the respect it deserves!
813;As a kid I loved Dumbo
814;My adult eyes now see aspects of the flick that both awe and disappoint.
815;The supreme joy for these captives is the appearance of their babies.
816;The new life brings smiles and warmth to an otherwise cold, confined existence.
817;Blacks are otherwise absent from audiences, townsfolk, and performers.
818;One of my favorite Disney films!
819;I love this classic Disney movie.
820;My girls had never seen it and suddenly I thought Disney might put this in the vault, and I won't be able to see this wonderful story with them.
821;Another Disney classic on Blu.
822;This was a gift for my Daughter.
823;She loved it as an addition.
824;Now I have a few more words to make this review finished.
825;Sorry for the extra verbage!
826;The movie arrived within 3 days, and it was in perfect condition.
827;Our grandchildren range in age from 6 to 2 and each one of them love the movie!
828;It has great characters, great voices, and is completely unpretentious.
829;This is something that is very important for younger children to learn, since they are forming their own self.
830;They are from another time, but are handled with humor and restraint.
831;the lowest form of circus life, in their estimation.
832;this is another important message for children to learn: that true love doesn't care if you aren't perfect.
833;Some of these wonderful people are still around, and some are actually still working.
834;my niece was a newborn at the time and it seemed like she really enjoyed.
835;she wouldnt look away from the screen and would smile and laugh at some moments.
836;One can never be too old to enjoy and shed a tear or two with this delightful film.
837;A must see for any generation.
838;This is a must have for any child!
839;I grew up watching this movie and wanted my child to be able to experience the same.
840;I watched it again for the first time in years and love it!
841;I gave this to my wife as a gift, due to having a new baby.
842;Its a great gift and great for kids.
843;My daughter absolutely LOVES this movie.
844;My niece's favorite movie and she absolutely loves it!
845;Soooo glad I could find it in such great condition for such a great price.
846;Should've seen my 2 year old niece's face light up when she opened it on Christmas!
847;There were some scenes that really shocked me.
848;The clown firemen making fun about putting out a fire and saving a baby.
849;Dumbo is the delightful tale of a floppy.
850;Filled with Uncle Walt's masterful gifts of storytelling and memorable music, this is a genuine treasure that, no matter your age, will leave you tune.
851;Oh, for those new to the film, for the scene in which Dumbo's mother is imprisoned.
852;Coupled with the song, 'Baby Mine', it's truly heart.
853;A rich and vibrant animated picture that completely captures the spirit and vitality of the subject.
854;Colors are solid and vibrant.
855;The audio has been remastered and remixed and is very nicely spread out over all your speakers.
856;bOTTOM LINE: Dumbo is a family classic.
857;It's a great classic movie.
858;My nephews loved it and it was great to have on the iPad so they could watch while resting.
859;A great movie to entertain the children when they can't be outside.
860;A very good story and one that has been watched by our children for many years
861;We really enjoyed the movie and will recommend it to anyone.
862;She loves watching it, and it's neat to see some of the bonus features.
863;The color is fresh and it's so well preserved, I forget how old this movie really is!
864;It's nice to have her watch something other than princesses and faeries.
865;this movie helps reinforce that.
866;Dumbo is such a great movie, I loved this movie since when I was a little kid, and I still love the movie Dumbo.
867;dumbo is a great movie!!!
868;According to the description it should work.
869;It is hard to believe that this movie was made 70 years ago, yet I still find it enjoyable to watch.
870;It comes with some really cool features as well.
871;This was his fathers favorite movie when he was a small boy
872;My niece and nephew loved it.
873;Even though this movie is a bit dated, I still enjoy watching it.
874;I got ma return four days later.
875;Our family loves the movie and it looks great in Blu.
876;What more can I say, it is a classic Disney Movie.
877;Sure, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs will be remembered as Disney's first feature, but this feature is his finest, and the Big Top Edition is the one to have as the film has been digitally restored.
878;because the package artwork is present.
879;This sweet animated film (only 64 minutes long) is truly a Disney treasure.
880;Dumbo entertains us, as well as teaches us a timeless lesson about love and tolerance in a world that is often times unkind and cruel.
881;The animation is rather simple as compared to the detail found in Snow White or Pinocchio, but it somehow works because of the film's other strengths.
882;In Dumbo your emotions run the full spectrum from laughter to tears.
883;The musical numbers are memorable, especially Baby Mine .
884;The crows add great comic relief toward the end of the film.
885;My wife and I saw Dumbo in the cinema as children, and it was one of our favorites.
886;This is the first movie I remember seeing as a boy in the '50s.
887;I bought this so I can share Dumbo with my grandson.
888;My grandkids love to watch this movie (and I love to watch it with them).
889;it has great animation, and funny as well as tender scenes.
890;A great song from a great movie.
891;A true classic for the kids and myself to watch.
892;bought it as a gift on a trip
893;I am a HUGE Disney fan and believe this movie is a classic that every person should see.
894;This is, however, a movie that the entire family can enjoy together in an atmosphere where discussion of what happens in the movie flows freely.
895;It was very touching to watch my 4 year old daughter cry at the same movie I did as a child!
896;Other than the tears this movie is wonderful for small kids.
897;YOU MUST see DUMBO on BLU RAY and ensure this movie gets into the hands of all kids in all generations!DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMBOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
898;My kids and I enjoy this movie.
899;It's a touching story, full of clowns, action, tender moments, music and adventure.
900;the musical numbers are off the hook, the animation is soooo creative and wonderful.
901;i love this, and i don't even have kids.
902;An outstanding animated film by the late Walt Disney and his people.
903;It most definitely focuses on our total humanity.
904;In other words it has laughter, happiness, and joy, mixed with crying, sadness and emptiness.
905;It is also optimistic which may be the most important aspect of the film and certainly a trademark of the times it was made.
906;Was loved by the receiver of this gift.
907;Great childhood memories watching this.
908;What I don't understand is the recent increase in price.
909;That is a huge difference.
910;The big eared elephant is a wonderful addition to anyone's Disney collection.
911;on a side note, I enjoy how Disney has been labelling its special features on Blu.
912;Bonus cartoons, The Flying Mouse and Elmer Elephant.
913;a short featurette exploring the theme park ride.
914;picture audio commentary features Pete Docter, Paula Sigman, and Andreas Deja.
915;gives the viewer the option of replacing the black space on each side of the screen with colorful designs.
916;explore, as I said, is the same feature found on Alice in Wonderland and Bambi that creates a new more interactive form of audio commentary.
917;Oh well, at least this September I'll finally be able to own Dumbo on Blu after it being delayed months and months.
918;Now lets hope Disney speeds up their releases, so far I've only heard of Lion King and Lady and the Tramp being planned for release in the near future.
919;This is how all Disney films should be released, new informative special features, beautiful transfer.
920;My son used to watch this over and over as a little boy so I thought it would be cute to get it for his son.
921;I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter.
922;She wanted to watch it every time she came to our house.
923;fast delivery good condition now my kids could watch my childhood cartoons
924;This is a real oldie .
925;in the truest sense of the word!No 3.
926;Everybody loves Dumbo for all the right reasons .
927;great story with humor and pathos, wonderful music, and delightful animation.
928;Dumbo's mom, and the other female elephants she lives and works with, are all Indian elephants (small ears).
929;It's full of classic pieces that of course include a white dominated societal commentary on what was perceived as appropriate black cultural roots at that time.
930;My kids loved this film when they were very young.
931;This is a great Disney classic from the days when there was a full bodied, earthy smell to what they did.
932;It's release in this format provides a historical window on American culture from the 1950s that is true and clear.
933;A great child's film that every adult needs to understand!
934;DUMBO is such a nice story.
935;it's a total classic from DISNEY, and everyone in the world should take a look at this piece of art!
936;A great Disney movie at a great price.
937;This is a joyful experience from start to finish with some impressive animation and wonderful music and songs.
938;This was released over 65 years ago and still captures the attention of today's youngsters and adults alike.
939;I like the cute elephant.
940;He is my favorite character in the movie.
941;this was exactly what i was looking for and it was in perfect condition.
942;it came out to be the perfect christmas gift.
943;These old Disney movies are wonderful.
944;I received it in record time.
945;Our kids, grandkids, and greatgrandaughter all love it !
946;Next to Toby Tyler, this is Disney's most beloved circus movie.
947;It's also one his most tearful animated tearjerkers.
948;It sounds like a lullabye, while giving joy to the small loved one in your grasp.
949;this is Dumbo's time to shine, and find the talents he knows not that he has.
950;With the help of his little mouse friend who becomes his circus coach and manager, they pull Dumbo out of obscurity and into the big top limelight.
951;Dumbo finds the wonderous elephant he can be, and always was.
952;Thereby, giving his family profile a much better name!
953;So he is very happy.
954;He is only 3 years old with autism, and loves his Dumbo movie.
955;My great grandaughter, age 2, will be seeing it for the first time and i am so excited.
956;I absolutely love this movie.
957;Thanks for listening and hope youll see it soon and feel as i do.
958;This traditional old Disney movie so touching and loving and sad all rolled up into one.
959;It was joyful to share this endearing classic with our grandchildren.
960;Enjoyable for the whole family, all generations will love the tale of a baby elephant that has ears a few sizes to big, and that when you accept yourself others will too.
961;Growing up in a Circus town I love watching the behind the scenes of the circus and how things come together.
962;Now being a mother and how protective you are of your children makes you completely understand how Dumbo's mother feels about her son.
963;well, Walt Disney sure is over confident that they are worth half a damn!
964;Dumbo is one of the more endearing classics that Disney has made.
965;It is very sweet and a nice movie that the 8 and under crowd will cherish.
966;The movie really appeals to anyone who loves Disney.
967;It teaches important values and it has a few tearjerker moments.
968;It is a definate classic in the lineup of Disney films.
969;Be sure to see it if you are a fan of Walt Disney Animation.
970;I love them all and hope to own them someday to share with my children.
971;so it stays in their mind and they understand the consequences of irresponsibility.
972;still talk like that, and this state is by far primarily White .
973;The crows are some of the nicest most friendly charachters in the film.
974;In many ways, the crows are Dumbo's saving grace, giving him the magic feather and thus the confidence to fly, and he doesn't forget them in the end.
975;They were full of soul and really uplifting.
976;because they brought the charachters to life and could make people sing and smile.
977;there's some nice white voices for you.
978;I got this one as a gift for my wife, and we were both blown away by how it looks and sounds in the new format.
979;The video mastering is phenomenal, and Dumbo looks better than ever.
980;The audio (at least through a 7.1 surround system) is fantastic and lively.
981;later he and Timothy inadvertently get drunk and Pink Elephants on Parade begins which is one of the best animated sequences in any of the Disney classics.
982;The Crows are another one of the many high points of this remarkable feature.
983;This sweet and sugary tale of a baby elephant with awfully big ears who could fly was a sensational hit.
984;It was also the very first animated feature to have the background painted in watercolor.
985;So, sweet this movie is, it drifts off into a childish whimsy the young can truly enjoy.
986;A very tender moment in Disney history that has been and will be appreciated in years to come.
987;It is Disney,so it entertains kids well.
988;this is definately not disney's best.
989;the music is memorable and my son enjoys them all except for pink elephants on parade.
990;Dumbo has always been one of my very favorite Disney films.
991;This tale of the little elephant with the big ears carries a valuable lesson .
992;The musical numbers, from the humorous When I See An Elephant Fly to the sweet lullaby Baby Mine, are representative of Disney composers' best.
993;The animation is outstanding, with each character's personality clearly demonstrated in his or her appearance before any dialogue is added.
994;on a personal note, I was watching this movie with my nephew several years ago, and the importance of the movie's message was demonstrated for me in a very moving fashion.
995;She hasn't been given it yet but we've seen it B.4 and just love it.
996;The classic movie is now a favorite to a new generation.
997;It's a darling story of how a little elephant with unusally big ears finds that no matter how unique you are you're always have a purpose in life.
998;It's the emotion and facial expressions that speak louder than words.
999;The innocence and sentiment surpasses it peers to a priceless treasure.
1000;mind every time I hear it.
1001;time greatest Disney classics would be: 1.
1002;And it doesn't have the excitement and peril of many other Disney films (Rescuers, etc.)But it is a touching story that's well.
1003;Throw in the great songs, and you get a movie that just doesn't grow old.
1004;The stork gives a baby elephant to Mrs Jumbo.
1005;It is up tohis only friend, a mouse, to assist Dumbo to achievehis full potential and help him do what he dreams of doing.
1006;My daughter enjoyed this movie.
1007;I recommend it for any family or any individual who enjoyed this movie at a young age.
1008;A wonderful time capsule of imagination and fantasy for young and older viewers alike.
1009;Pink elephants on parade and the crows with Dumbo and the magic feather are priceless.
1010;This movie is a Disney CLASSIC!
1011;He loves it and occasionally asks to see it again!
1012;`Dumbo' is one of those Disney films I grew up on and I still have fond memories of putting this on on VHS and enjoying every minute of the story.
1013;Thankfully the scenery is still beautiful and many small touches that make this film remain.
1014;This film has great music that brought many memories flooding back and the now famous psychedelic pink elephant scene is just as impressive as ever.
1015;This has a nice mix of cute, funny and sad scenes and the sad ones made me choke up as a kid and still had the power to put a lump in my throat as an adult.
1016;Overall this is a fine example of classic Disney animation and although I feel the re.
1017;This is heart warming film making at it's best.
1018;This is Walt Disneys personal favorite.
1019;The film transfer is fantastic considering this movie is 60 years old.
1020;The digital remastering was very well done and is up to par with Snow White and Fantasia.
1021;The 5.1 Dolby track really shines and the audio has a spacious feel and is very clean.
1022;woofer and rears are used a few times as well.
1023;The additional content is nice and is above the Gold Edition standard.
1024;The audio commentary was very interesting and follows the film.
1025;I loved this movie when I was younger.
1026;anyway, the movie is sad and yet an uplifting message about overcoming diversity and being all that you could be.
1027;The very definition of the term 'Disney Classic', Dumbo is a magical fable of a movie as perfect for a 23 year.
1028;and the legendary turn of events that puts Dumbo's persecutors firmly in their place .
1029;is one of the greatest Disneys, with superb classic animation and great, offbeat music.
1030;The scenes of Dumbo's gentle mother trying to soothe her befuddled offspring and shelter him from the world's mocking, ostracizing ways are a wonderfully moving touch, and the ending is glorious.
1031;ages' movie, there are very few that match Dumbo.
1032;Dumbo is a very rare Disney animated movie that didn't have a villian, and plus this movie runs about 63 minutes.
1033;Animated movies takes 2 to 3 years to make, and yet this animated movie was made in 1 year.
1034;My 18 month old is obsessed!
1035;We watch it every day!
1036;very watchable quotable and lovable
1037;I shared this movie with my grand daughter and she loved it.
1038;I think it was great.
1039;I get a lot of movies from Disney for her and we both watch them.
1040;Walt Disney's fourth animated feature, Dumbo, is one of his best movies.
1041;It has some of the best songs a Disney movie has ever had.
1042;One song in particular, Baby Mine, just brings tears to my eyes.
1043;This movie is another one of Uncle Walt's great classics.
1044;He gives a great amount of information about the voice actors and animators.
1045;I'm sure this one was a winner!!!
1046;We can make a difference and DUMBO has made that task easier for me.
1047;This animated film is fun
1048;We bought this because our grandson loves trains and animals.
1049;This is the perfect combination of gorgeous color and a fun story.
1050;And Casey Jones and Dumbo are the icing on the cake.
1051;Our grandkids watch it every time they come to visit.
1052;Thanks for the fast delivery
1053;One of the interesting things about having children (among the many wonderful and interesting things) is getting the chance to re.
1054;experience childhood and to see movies I enjoyed as a child.
1055;The movie is another great story that comes from my childhood from the time that disney was making for the whole family to watch.
1056;Saw it for the first time.
1057;long Disney movie lovers
1058;The rest of the movie is wonderful.
1059;the characters, songs, moral and story.
1060;the theme and story unquestionably transcends time.
1061;this film came out in 1941 and remains an animated classic.
1062;dumbo set the tone for successful disney features.
1063;the story of Dumbo is awesome and inspiring.
1064;the film teaches a valuable lesson about life in a creative way.
1065;the lesson is charming and valuable.
1066;This particular baby has huge and unusually shaped ears.
1067;at first, this baby is completely misunderstood because of his unique features.
1068;luckily, Dumbo befriends a positive circus mouse that helps him form a newfound perspective.
1069;with help from his friend and a cast of unique characters, Dumbo is able to turn his setbacks intotalents.
1070;He discovers that his huge ears enable him to fly and he becomes the great flying elephant.
1071;this is a nice old fashion family movie for everyone.
1072;its holds up and will make you feel good.
1073;the entertainment and moral value is strong.
1074;the very things that held ya down are gonna carry ya up, and up, and up!
1075;The shortest of the Disney animated classics at a mere 64 minutes, Dumbo has a simple story, told well.
1076;The stork pays a visit to the circus, blessing most of the animals with new arrivals, including the elephant Mrs. Jumbo.
1077;When the new baby sneezes, his ears unfold and they are enormous.
1078;This turns him into the star attraction, and he and Mrs. Jumbo are rewarded with their own private car on the circus train.
1079;the art work in Dumbo ranks with that of Pinocchio and Bambi and contains wonderful touches, highlighted by the Pink Elephants musical number, a hallucinatory dream sequence set to march tempo that occurs when Dumbo unknowingly drinks whiskey.
1080;The music also includes the Oscar.
1081;In Dumbo, Disney returned to a traditional story line, and his artists were able to exercise their imagination, sense of fun, and ingenuity to create a tale with heart.
1082;This restored print marks the first time Dumbo has been released in high definition.
1083;I loved Dumbo as a child.
1084;I've now watched it for my own education and still think the message is worth it.
1085;minded enough to share this story with their children when they are older and can understand why they held back on this one (all the black men pounding in the stakes and the white men and women being stars, for example), as I feel the message of over.
1086;coming difficulties is an important one.
1087;Amazing that the politically correct Disney Studios, which refuses to re.
1088;release Song of the South because of Uncle Remus (who is portrayed as a happy black slave), released Dumbo with the black soulful crows.
1089;unknown, but, regardless, the mother of each turned out to be a bitch
1090;One is Dumbo because he's a cute baby elephant, Timothy q. Mouse because he is a mouse AND a caring character, always there for Dumbo.
1091;And fourth is the Pink Elephant scene.
1092;Loves the bright colors, the music, the characters.
1093;I loved this movie as a child and now I'm happy that my kids can enjoy it as well :)
1094;This is not the best Disney film, I think but it's very cute, and the Dumbo is an endearing character.
1095;Dumbo is one of the great old Disney animation classics about a woeful little circus elephant born with abnormally big ears, who initially becomes the butt of many cruel jokes and treatment by the other circus animals.
1096;Great animation, simple story, minimum of dialogue to bring the plot forward, and some really well crafted sequences with songs like: Elephants On Parade (a very surreal seq. for a Disney film), and When I See's An Elephant Fly (wonderful song and seq. where wisecracking crows become father figures for the fatherless little elephant, and push Dumbo to finally discover that his big ears are actually a prime asset, allowing him to fly like a bird).
1097;long) a memorable cinema treasure for children and adults alike.
1098;What can I say, it's a Disney classic that replaces an old VHS tape that broke.
1099;My wife is very happy and therefore, so am I.
1100;my granddaughter loved it (and watched it over and over and over).
1101;era of Disney animation began with THE LITTLE MERMAID, the best animated Disney movies were the more original ones that they basically came up with themselves, e. g. BAMBI or THE FOX AND THE HOUND.
1102;the story is quite simple.
1103;The stork comes a little late, but delivers her bundle of joy.
1104;there's quite a bit that's appealing about DUMBO.
1105;The animation is quite spectacular, especially considering that the film was released in 1941.
1106;The music and songs are top notch, with everything from catchy tunes to tear.
1107;The movie has a great message and it appeals to both children and adults.
1108;It truly is a Disney classic (and I don't use that term lightly).
1109;There are a couple of games, some sing.
1110;songs, a music video, and a featurette.
1111;Both go along with the theme of DUMBO and compliment the film nicely (and the Mouse short includes an appearance by the Blue Fairy from Pinocchio).
1112;It is the shortest film, and cheapest made, by Disney
1113;She assults one of the children.
1114;She is placed in a cage, seperated from Dumbo.
1115;This is unknown to Dumbo and Timothy when they drink from the bucket.
1116;Some crows nearby take an interest in these two, and break out into song, singing a delightful tune When I see an elephant fly .
1117;Timothy also gives Dumbo a magic feather, which he says will allow him to fly as long as he holds on to it.
1118;Dumbo perseveres, and he shows us we can too.
1119;This was my favorite movie as a child.
1120;Just watched it again and it still makes me feel like a kid.
1121;Sometimes it is hard to find the family classics .
1122;Dumbo arrived at the earliest date and in great condition .
1123;Dumbo is adorable and he doesnt even say a word.
1124;right, you are getting the 1991 VHS.
1125;The Restoration on this was fantastic, especially for the time period it was done.
1126;The Cover artwork looks amazing as well.
1127;And i think Dumbo is a wonderful film i'd suggest anybody to check out.
1128;She's actually watching it right now.
1129;Well worth owning and re.
1130;Dumbo is a cinematic milestone and masterpiece of family entertainment.
1131;The 'drunken scene' is funny, brief and discrete (all you see is the shadows of characters through canvas).
1132;Dumbo really is one of Walt Disneys best.
1133;It is a wonderful movie.
1134;Appears to bo in good condition.
1135;This movie is a wonderful addition to my daughters collection.
1136;She loves watching Dumbo fly.
1137;The disk and the other printed materials and game pieces were perfect condition.
1138;Arrival time and delivery was fast.
1139;My grandson is so happy to see the Dumbo story and will enjoy for many years to come.
1140;I have Dumbo Big Top edition which is wonderful.
1141;I got this edition because of the extra features.
1142;TIMELESS and CLASSIC and GREAT ITEM!
1143;My kids love these timeless classics just as much as I did.
1144;I would love to see this on the big screen with my son and have him eat popcorn with other kids oohing and aahhing just like he is doing.
1145;It is one of my favorite Disney movies.
1146;But Dumbo is a throw back to the old days, and a very good example of the art of cartoons at its best.
1147;And, it shows the values of the past, stokes delivering babies, and the ideal mother protecting their children.
1148;Fun for the whole family.
1149;I believe Dumbo to be one of the finest classics to come out of Disney during the 1940's.
1150;The majority of the picture and sound are crisp and clean and very brilliant in color, however there are moments when it's not.
1151;If you have kids, the bonus features are specifically geared towards them.
1152;These days, the world is a hard enough, children cannot be sheltered from all the bad news that permeates our world, and when we take a break for a movie, I prefer an uplifting storyline.
1153;Dumbo, the classic story with a Rudolph the Red .
1154;One of the best Disney pictures ever made.
1155;it touches your heart and your funny bone.
1156;The racist crows, though shocking to our 21st century eyes, are a realistic view of the times the film was made.
1157;Dumbo is absolutely the most watchable cartoon ever made!
1158;My six year old watches it over and over and loves the animals, the clowns and the visuals.
1159;The music and look of the film facinates her and captures her attention.
1160;this story is full of genuine emotion from beginning to end.
1161;The sadness of Mrs. Jumbo as she sees other animals enjoying their new children.
1162;The joy of Mrs. Jumbo as she finally has a child of her own.
1163;Her fierce protective instincts kicking in as her child is jeered.
1164;The crows trying to make up for their jeering of Dumbo and the really satisfying climax.
1165;The story is tight and every scene fits perfectly.
1166;Dumbo is a spectacular film with a message about considering the feelings of others.
1167;It is at the same time a classic, funny and very emotional film with a great story that can be watched over and over.
1168;It can be enjoyed immensely on an adult level as well as by childen on their level.
1169;I consider it one of my top ten favorites of all time.
1170;this is a real Keeper!
1171;This is far from the best Disney movie for this and other reasons, but I enjoy seeing the evolution of culture and entertainment.
1172;ray also comes with the restored original mono mix, so I can watch the film on my Blu.
1173;I also enjoyed the DisneyView presentation of Dumbo, because of the beautiful artwork replacing the black bars.
1174;I'd strongly recommend this Blu.
1175;ray to everyone, especially those who aspire to become an animator.
1176;but I got to open up and say I LOVE this movie!
1177;I am 17 and I have loved this movie for as long as I can remember
1178;animal cruelty flick seen from the animals' point of view and pointing out the ignorance of the humans, and a realistic depiction of how cruel and unjust the world can be, and what can be done to overcome despite it all.
1179;i love the cleverness and depth of this movie.
1180;Pretty outstanding for 1941 when there was still so much bigotry in the US.
1181;anyway, the parts of the movie that will delight people of all ages are the quaint and adorable animation of the animals and the classic catchy songs.
1182;My faves are the cute Look Out For Mr. Stork, the clever pun.
1183;filled soul song When I See An Elephant Fly, the hypnotic Elephants On Parade, the catchy tunes Casey Junior and Roustabouts.
1184;The few good characters are lovable.
1185;benevolent Jumbo, cute little Dumbo/Jumbo Jr., the witty and hilarious (and cute may I add.
1186;i love cartoon birds) crows, the charismatic Timothy, and good ol' Mr. Stork.
1187;I detest the rest of the characters.
1188;As a little kid I thought it was entertaining on the eyes, now it makes me laugh, but I still can't help but wonder why that didn't frighten me as a small child.
1189;This movie literally is a classic.
