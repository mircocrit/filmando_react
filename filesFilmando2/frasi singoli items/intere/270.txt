I:14225;1;I was able to watch the rest of it (after he escapes) just fine.
I:14225;2;as much as I was turned off in the beginning of the movie, i am still giving it a good rating, because the director did his job and got across what he wanted us to see and experience.
I:14225;3;But I ended up really enjoying it.
I:14225;4;I would recommend watching it.
I:14225;5;In the jungle, with jaguars and stuff.
I:14225;6;There are two features you can now expect from a Mel Gibson film: It will be big, and and it will be bloody.
I:14225;7;This time we have the historical fiction presented with a happy Mayan village.
I:14225;8;Complete with warriors and hunters we are given some colorful characters.
I:14225;9;the presentation is certainly remarkable enough as the village hero, Jaguar's Paw, escapes on a harrowing journey that reminds one of the most urgent rendering of 'Lord of the Flies' that's yet to be presented.
I:14225;10;The startling savagery comes to the fore with fearless detail.
I:14225;11;The cinematography is masterful and their predicament is framed in every scene.
I:14225;12;Some of the moon shots and New Age wind instrumentation is reminiscent of 'The Passion of Christ,' but 'Apocalypto' is a group project with a whole tribe in view.
I:14225;13;Anguish and a sweeping chase are skillfully presented in yet another Mel masterpiece.
I:14225;14;I have watched and love the movie.
I:14225;15;It is a great movie.
I:14225;16;dont like Mel Gibson but he did make a class movie.
I:14225;17;I wanted to get this movie as a gift and was so happy to find the amazon had it!
I:14225;18;The seller did an excellent job of sending my product on time and it was in great condition.
I:14225;19;Gibson has distinguished himself as a director/writer who is willing to show the unpleasant side of life.
I:14225;20;I was really surprised how this film pulled me in.
I:14225;21;If nothing else, I think it does an excellent job of showing how life was in the Mayan culture.
I:14225;22;The first half of the film is outstanding.
I:14225;23;A few even brought tears to my eyes.
I:14225;24;"The ending was very ""Lord of the Flies,"" and I wonder if Touchstone is paying royalties."
I:14225;25;If you liked Passion and think you'll like this, pick it up.
I:14225;26;Regardless of it's historical correctness, this film is entertaining and fun to watch and gives a glimpse of what life might have been like for the people of that time and place.
I:14225;27;as filmmaking goes, this is quite a feat.
I:14225;28;The sets, costumes and makeup alone are worthy of an award.
I:14225;29;Totally inconsistant with the rest of the movie.
I:14225;30;He is captured and separated from his friends, family, his pregnant wife, and first born son.
I:14225;31;The rest of the story deals with his journey as he attempts to return to his wife and child.
I:14225;32;the film is full of beautiful views of the rain forest (in Mexico?
I:14225;33;"To beat all that, every costume in the film is hand made, which gives the film that extra punch of ""realism."
I:14225;34;I loved this film, and could watch it again and again.
I:14225;35;What follows is a breathtaking action thriller that transports you into 15th century Mexico and a world of untold savagery.
I:14225;36;All the dialogue is authentic Yacatec Mayan and the cast are predominantly indigenous to the Mesoamerica's giving the sensation of an authentic glimpse into the past.
I:14225;37;the story line was great.
I:14225;38;You really want to help the hero make it.
I:14225;39;It takes some sting out of it, as Gibson and Safinia set the stage and talk about the actors and technical details and how much they enjoyed making the film.
I:14225;40;I have watched this movie over 20 times and still love it.
I:14225;41;I'd seen it before and bought it because I wanted to watch it again.
I:14225;42;It was a very good movie if you into world history and learning about the Mayans.
I:14225;43;I would proudly recommend this movie to other people.
I:14225;44;it is, rather, a historical film about the Mayan civilization.
I:14225;45;There are historical inaccuracies, sure, but a lot of historical movie epics are historically inaccurate.
I:14225;46;Titanic, the Patriot, and just about every historical Disney animation, for example.
I:14225;47;a great action film, which happens to take place within a Mayan context.
I:14225;48;"I loved this movie, and I am NOT a ""bloodthirsty fool"" as many of the one."
I:14225;49;"star reviews believe to be the only people who will enjoy this movie
I:14225;50;Rather, the movie explores the extremes to which human beings will go to explain and appease their sources of hardship and/or suffering, and how deep one's will is to save one's own life and that of his or her family.
I:14225;51;I think that the film successfully gets this point across.
I:14225;52;If you can look past the blood and gore (which I believe enhances the context of the film), then this is certainly an evident feature of the film.
I:14225;53;I know it is especially hard to look past the historical inaccuracies, but I really thought that the film was brilliantly filmed and written.
I:14225;54;Many reviewers spoke of the movie itself, which was incredibly well done and held your interest from start to finish.
I:14225;55;Visually, it was brilliant, sharp, clear, with breath.
I:14225;56;Audio was equally impressive, and I was using a mere 5.1 channel surround sound system.
I:14225;57;Overall, a wonderfully done movie, but as violent as violent can get.
I:14225;58;If someone more politically correct did this film they would have been nominated for best director and best picture.
I:14225;59;This film is simply haunting and breath taking.
I:14225;60;It's gory too, but the sacrificial scene to me was the most captivating of all, because near the end of Tikal this is how sacrifices played out, and to see it brought life on screen was jaw dropping.
I:14225;61;the characters and cinematography is great, the rest is fed to you a la Mel Gibson.
I:14225;62;He has a point to make, a visual experience to feed you, and that is about it.
I:14225;63;I was very impressed by the producers' attention to detail to provide authenticity to this motion picture.
I:14225;64;NopeCostume design Oscar winner for that year ?
I:14225;65;Oscar guaranteed it seems .
I:14225;66;makeup Oscar winner for that year ?
I:14225;67;This kind of work should be rewarded, the moviemakers celebrated and honored by their peers .
I:14225;68;They were all snubbed because Hollywood has a beef with Mel GibsonThis is why I quit paying any attention to the Oscars years ago (well decades to be more exact) , The Oscars are a glitzy corporate circus , politicized and unworthy of their original mission which was to award extraordinary talent in the industry .
I:14225;69;a young man, Jaguar Paw, with a pregnant wife and a young son, goes hunting Tapir for food in the forest, when they come across a horde of people passing through.
I:14225;70;"along the way, a diseased young girl tells of a prophecy, in which a man of the Jaguar will bring about the doom of those slavers who listen to her, and all sorts of other omens such as ""He who runs with the Jaguar""."
I:14225;71;Along with the beautifully realistic jungle setting and cinematography, this is simply put, a masterpiece.
I:14225;72;After all, it's a personal story of one man's struggle to save his family.
I:14225;73;This movie has been heavily criticized by many (at least, where I live) but this is actually a great adventure film.
I:14225;74;The second half of the movie, as the hero is chased through the jungle by a group of Mayas, is terrific and breathtaking film.
I:14225;75;making, the best thing that Gibson has ever made.
I:14225;76;come on Mel, tell the truth!
I:14225;77;Best told story of Mayans.
I:14225;78;Mel Gibson is truly an excellent director.
I:14225;79;He captured everything emotional and intense in the Mayan people.
I:14225;80;This movie makes you excited, sad, emotional, and very suspenseful.
I:14225;81;I was on the edge of my seat!
I:14225;82;This is a very good movie.
I:14225;83;The execution scenes in the Mayan capital are very gruesome and probably historically inaccurate but they enhance the movie and bring home just how savage human nature can be beneath the surface, in any culture and at any time.
I:14225;84;"that was also the core message of Conrad's Heart of Darkness and I wondered when I watched this film if Gibson's choice of title ""Apocalypto"" and Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"", based on The Heart of Darkness, was coincidental."
I:14225;85;There are a 1000 reviews here and they are extremely positive.
I:14225;86;please turn to the HISTORY CHANNEL!
I:14225;87;Otherwise, this is an adventure set 600 years towards the end of the Mayan civilization.
I:14225;88;He is a fierce hunter, loving husband and father whose world is destroyed when his village is attacked by Mayans.
I:14225;89;Before his capture, he hides his wife and son in a well.
I:14225;90;A great movie!NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: One word: WOW!
I:14225;91;Lush green jungles, roaring fires, and solar eclipses!
I:14225;92;This is a visual joy!
I:14225;93;The audio is outstanding as well.
I:14225;94;Movie is nearly nonstop action.
I:14225;95;making craft to do the rest.
I:14225;96;And he has succeeded in spades.
I:14225;97;a wild and intense chase film, done with astonishing skill and cleverness, amid the background of a thorougly imagined time and culture, it grabbed and held my interest throughout.
I:14225;98;This is why I still go to the movies.
I:14225;99;what I found was a completely engaging film of imagined history, remarkable in its production values, and directed with energy and passion.
I:14225;100;That you can draw inferences from the depiction of simple and gentle and all too human life in the village versus the excesses and corruption and degeneracy, albeit just as human, in the Mayan city, is only icing.
I:14225;101;This film stands on its own terms, and it is a fine and daring piece of work.
I:14225;102;Entertaining and with an added something else.
I:14225;103;Great exotic locale (even language).
I:14225;104;It's a movie that portrays love of freedom, of life and family in face of evil aggression.
I:14225;105;is a good movie that covers mayan civilization towards its decline.
I:14225;106;This is a great story, funny at times, but full of drama too.
I:14225;107;The first time I saw it, I did all of the reading.
I:14225;108;It's one I'll watch over and over.
I:14225;109;Work of an artistGood acting good directing very interesting story very engulfing chain of eventVery realisticFascinating from beginning to end
I:14225;110;"It's certainly as unapologetic about its violence as ""The Passion of the Christ""."
I:14225;111;"This makes ""Apocalypto"" a lot easier to watch."
I:14225;112;Second, it is very artistically made.
I:14225;113;"This is what I liked about ""The Passion of the Christ""."
I:14225;114;"now that I've thought about it, I have this to say:""Apocalypto"" tries very hard to be powerful, deep, and thought."
I:14225;115;And the sad part is that the only thing that kept it from getting them, and that prevented this from being a fantastic movie, is a good, thorough editing.
I:14225;116;All in all, I imagine that a good twenty minutes of material could have been removed.
I:14225;117;indulgant in other ways, as well.
I:14225;118;For example, it opens with a quote, like so many great novels.
I:14225;119;That's actually a very good way to describe it.
I:14225;120;The camerawork, the locations, the sets, the costumes.
I:14225;121;basically everything about its look is wonderful.
I:14225;122;The actors did a fantastic job with what they were given.
I:14225;123;i'd love to recommend this movie to you, but I just can't.
I:14225;124;"I've been a fan of Mel Gibson as an actor since ""Gallipoli"", and thought ""Braveheart"" was quite good and well directed."
I:14225;125;"The poster for ""Apocalypto"" featuring what looked like a Mayan warrior with the pyramids in the background got me interested."
I:14225;126;"The only other movies I can remember that dealt with the Aztecs or Mayans were ""Captain From Castile"" in the 40's and ""Kings of the Sun"" in the 60's, neither I felt did justice to such impressive civilizations."
I:14225;127;"After the main character escapes, the movie reminded me of ""The Naked Prey"" or ""Predator"", and the chase is exciting on that level, but why place it during that time and place and ultimately negate the opening quote of Will Durant about a civilization being destroyed from within, when like in ""Captain From Castile"" it looks like the Spanish got 'em."
I:14225;128;The movie was done so well .
I:14225;129;This is one of the most exciting Action/Adventure movies up to date!
I:14225;130;The movie in some parts can be somewhat unrealistic, but Mel Gibson still did an excellent job recapturing the Mayan culture.
I:14225;131;This is a must see for any fan of the Action/Adventure genre!
I:14225;132;Beautiful shot, brilliant acting and cast.
I:14225;133;Everything from hit to toe is AMAZING!
I:14225;134;Beware of ,Is very graphic bloody and violent movie, just made for a guys and I loved it .
I:14225;135;Customs and colors were gorgeous to look at.
I:14225;136;Beside that, Great EPIC movie and Must see!
I:14225;137;Apocalypto has an amazing story as well as great action and suspense.
I:14225;138;It's something fresh and new.
I:14225;139;To top it all off, it is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen.
I:14225;140;The jungle and landscape shots are breathtaking.
I:14225;141;The detail on the Mayan people's faces are incredible.
I:14225;142;ray to show off your TV, as well as a really fun movie to watch, look no further!
I:14225;143;Mel Gibson may be an antisemitic mofo, but he can still make a great movie.
I:14225;144;The acting is good so the words just play to that really.
I:14225;145;plagued days such as these and many of these scenes are unforgettable.
I:14225;146;cheered for his survival with dramatic intensity.
I:14225;147;This is due to our ability to relate to him at a level far deeper than that of race, sex, and class.
I:14225;148;The movie itself is fantastic.
I:14225;149;The movie has NO story.
I:14225;150;The Maya were such an interesting culture to do a movie about.
I:14225;151;kings, with great pyramids, temples, irrigation works, and an exotic religion.
I:14225;152;I saw this movie in the theatres and I must say I enjoyed the action.
I:14225;153;The movie has a very epic, sweeping feel.
I:14225;154;He was probably my favorite character in the movie.
I:14225;155;The last half of the movie with the young hero racing home to save his pregnant wife and son is the most 'action packed' part of the movie and reminds me of Rambo, the first one anyway with the hero setting clever traps that takes out his pursuer's.
I:14225;156;If you can handle that then you will find the viewing experience of this movie quite enlightening.
I:14225;157;I reccomend this movie to anyone who likes good movies.
I:14225;158;and is mature enough to stomach seeing people get decapitated and impaled.
I:14225;159;This movie is a masterpiece.
I:14225;160;I cant wait to see this!
I:14225;161;the movie was fantastic in the theater and just as wonderful at home .
I:14225;162;I share it with my students every year.
I:14225;163;BRAVEHEART was wonderfully brutal, which Gibson produced, directed and starred in.
I:14225;164;Now fully behind the camera in his latest two feature films, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST and now APOCALYPTO, Gibson proves he's got both vision and talent (now if he could only keep his personal life out of the tabloids!)
I:14225;165;it is noteworthy here to say that Mel, regardless of subject matter, can pull viewers into a story.
I:14225;166;jewish components, it was sumptuously filmed and very well executed.
I:14225;167;If we're here to talk about films and not the man behind the film, then it's fair to say that Apocalypto is a rousing success.
I:14225;168;the sets, the dress, the make.
I:14225;169;up, the incredible story, and the action, all make this film a glue.yourself.
I:14225;170;Not once did I pull my eyes from the movie, fearing that I might miss this beautiful shot or that amazing character.
I:14225;171;"He has an ideal life, a loving wife, a tough son, and another kid ""in the oven."""
I:14225;172;He and his fellow townsfolk hunt the local forest for food and live in harmony with their environment.
I:14225;173;And thus starts an adrenaline pumping chase through the thick jungle, over massive waterfalls, and deep into Jaguar Paw's country.
I:14225;174;Much praise MUST (reluctantly or not) go toward Mr. Gibson for his amazing job directing this genre.
I:14225;175;historical piece, but it also has heavy elements of romance, drama, comedy, and action/adventure.
I:14225;176;It completely lures you in, including the Mayan language which is spoken throughout the entire production (with English subtitles).
I:14225;177;tattoo each of the 700 main and extra characters daily, a monumental task.
I:14225;178;And costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo (BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY) is to be commended for her outstanding head.
I:14225;179;It is one fantastic piece of cinema.
I:14225;180;Outstanding action adventure that is totally gripping whether you read the subtitles or not.
I:14225;181;Excellent special feature documentary and amusing fact.
I:14225;182;He draws attention to the well he hid his pregnant wife and child in by not moving the dead mayans body away from the well and mayan who has it in for him cuts the rope when he finds it.
I:14225;183;He (Jaguar) is sinking inside as he's lead away and watches the cut rope dissapear into the well.
I:14225;184;This one is also a must see.
I:14225;185;The cinematography is top notch and the actors well cast.
I:14225;186;Except for the fact that it is acted in ancient surroundings (and the human sacrifices) it's got a very modern feeling to it.
I:14225;187;in a word, it's one evenings worth of solid entertainment.
I:14225;188;the story is easy to follow.
I:14225;189;this is a movie I can watch over and over.
I:14225;190;While it's fascinationg to see the silver screen decorated by almost naked, exotically beautiful people living the simple jungle life when not taking part in over the top ancient ceremonies.
I:14225;191;He also manages to hunt down the greenest, lushest, most cinematic worthy natural forest for the over simplified drama to drag out in.
I:14225;192;The lead, played by Native American Rudy Youngblood (as the super.
I:14225;193;humanly invincible warrior Jaguar Paw) is as elegantly movie.
I:14225;194;star handsome a 'savage' as any casting agent can find and paired with his exotically stunning wife and adorable baby son, makes for a mezmerising family (who are lit and filmed most glamorously even while under attack).
I:14225;195;In the end,the romantic art direction and high speed action sequences wins over the weak story.
I:14225;196;Great Action, great story but the movie had NO ending.
I:14225;197;I thought the acting was extremely good and it was very suspenseful.
I:14225;198;It tells the tale of a young man, who is captured by the Mayans and almost sacrificed.
I:14225;199;but definitely watch the movie, and once you see it, think about it a little.
I:14225;200;Although it is the type of movie that you wouldn't want to watch over and over again, it still manages to be a classic.
I:14225;201;shot movie that moves along at a fast clip.
I:14225;202;just with a Yucutan flourish.
I:14225;203;I always thought it was the Aztecs that were the real bloodthirsty ones.
I:14225;204;Note: Native American with English subtitles.
I:14225;205;the '06 epic film 'Apocalypto' is a stunning cinematic achievement that is so graphic in its depiction of violence the viewer could easily become overwhelmed by its visceral assault on the senses and miss the more subtle nuances of this well constructed storyline.
I:14225;206;"There are numerous avenues of thought one could pursue in examining this movie such as
I:14225;207;mel Gibson's Apocalypto is such a film.
I:14225;208;For all the faults of its director Apocalypto is a fairly good straight foreward adventure story.
I:14225;209;Gibson's premise is that the great civilization was destroyed due to rot from the inside and this point is adequately made in the ultra violent sacrifice scenes in this section of the film.
I:14225;210;the third part of the film deals with Jaguar Paw's escape from the Holcane and his return to rescue his wife and young son.
I:14225;211;The third part of the film is pure action adventure.
I:14225;212;This is pure adrenalin driven action and if you view it as such you won't be disappointed.
I:14225;213;see this film for the action and not for great social commentary and it's a pretty fair if often brutal adventure.
I:14225;214;I found myself liking the film far more than I thought I would.
I:14225;215;the disc includes a making of featurette, Becoming Mayan and a enjoyable commentary by Gibson and cowriter/producer Farhad Safinia.
I:14225;216;MEL GIBSON'S APOCALYPTO is a decent period piece.
I:14225;217;The costumes and sets, and scenery are great.
I:14225;218;The actors are very likable.
I:14225;219;Although it is not as intense as I expected, it does have some nice family values displayed, among the main character and his family, which is an unexpected plus.
I:14225;220;It does manage to look and feel very exotic, which is entertaining and mysterious, though not too exciting.
I:14225;221;writer, which is especially good in explaining the events and scenes in the big city and the rituals and activities of the ancient people.
I:14225;222;overall, this film is pretty good entertainment, and it gets more enjoyable for me after going through the bonus features.
I:14225;223;I enjoyed the historical aspect of this film but felt it portrayed only the gruesome side of the civilization.
I:14225;224;I should say, it seems very realistic, because I have no knowledge of Mayan culture other than this movie.
I:14225;225;But the costumes and sets and cinematography are as good as I have ever seen.
I:14225;226;When they are on top of the temple about to be.
I:14225;227;I appreciate what he does and I hope he makes many more movies.
I:14225;228;This is certainly one of the best Mel Gibson has directed.
I:14225;229;In all a very solid film.
I:14225;230;incredible moving story and plotline.
I:14225;231;check out this pure adrenaline movie.you'll be wide.
I:14225;232;eyed and propted up on your seat for the whole show.
I:14225;233;If this is what mel gibson is going to do with movies.
I:14225;234;he may be the next best film maker in hollywood.
I:14225;235;Mel Gibson is not may favorite actor, but as director I'm very pleased to recognize him as one of the best ones.
I:14225;236;Apocalypto deserved to be an Oscar winner, it did not received any but at least was nominated for 3.
I:14225;237;Also, received another 3 wins and 9 nominations.
I:14225;238;I won't tell more, but the movie is so good that you just don't want it to end.
I:14225;239;It may be very gore at moments, but is well presented.
I:14225;240;The movie ends when the Mayas find the Spanish Galleons arriving to the costs, and It would be very nice to see the point of view of Mr. Gibson, if he continues the saga, so we can appreciate what happen to the Mayas when the Spanish colonist got to discover them.
I:14225;241;The best filmmakers are the ones who aren't afraid to coat their projects with their own life blood.
I:14225;242;There are films that you see that you just KNOW it's a window into the soul of the writer or director, and you are grateful they had the guts to do it.
I:14225;243;Mel Gibson has always taken his fervor, vivacity, creativity and devotion to his work seriously.
I:14225;244;He has produced and directed such films as: Man without a Face, Forever Young, Braveheart, Passion of the Christ, and Apocalypto.
I:14225;245;I grew up with an alcoholic, so I know the ups and downs and the inner turmoil they feel, we are lucky as an audience to witness Mel's way of hashing out his inner demons.
I:14225;246;onto the reviewApocalypto is an astonishing, breathtaking tale of one man and his devotion to both his family, and his way of life.
I:14225;247;who among us could imagine his way of life and the hard work it takes to provide for a village and family, and who among us wouldn't trade all we have to experience that sense of accomplishment and utter bliss.
I:14225;248;"That is the truth
I:14225;249;Jaguar Paw sleeps in a hut, but has a beautiful family and he is content.
I:14225;250;He saves his family, only to leave them in a precarious position and he knows that he has to get back to them somehow.
I:14225;251;In the end he succeeds in saving his family, and witnesses the coming of a new enemy with the Spaniards landing on their beach.
I:14225;252;Melody Gibson directed it and yeah that is neat because normally she just does movies that kind of pic on jews which of course the terrorists would actually condone, but that is for the sequal called Jaguar Path of Doom.
I:14225;253;"Whether or not one believes the "" historical"" facts, and that is up for debate, this film is one of the best things Mel Gibson has ever produced."
I:14225;254;The beginning and middle is about a young Mexican or Central American native's capture and escape from Mayans who attack his people and take survivors for human sacrifice.
I:14225;255;The escape of the young native and the chase after him by the Mayan soldiers is one of the most thrilling parts of any movie I have ever seen.
I:14225;256;Mel Gibson did an excellent job.
I:14225;257;It starts you off slow and builds up to one of the best movies I have seen.
I:14225;258;As with any subject of history, it tells better if it mixed with fiction.
I:14225;259;"this a fiction with a lot of ""real"" history behind it."
I:14225;260;This movie seems to be very accurate with its story line.
I:14225;261;I love the animation and details of the way the movie was made.
I:14225;262;Subtitles are big enough to read .
I:14225;263;go Mel!The story line is good and the actors and acting are quite convincing.
I:14225;264;nice disc to have around.
I:14225;265;These underlying themes of change made this one of the most unique experiences I've had at the movies.
I:14225;266;"Many things are appropriately revealed is this film, most notably the fact that the basic human instincts of survival, love, fear, and hatred are universal
I:14225;267;Luckily, he manages to save his wife and child by lowering them into a cave, one with many nooks and crannies for hiding.
I:14225;268;While the audience has no way of knowing how the situation will unfold, they still get the feeling that he knows he'll return for them.
I:14225;269;We certainly hope that that will be the case, especially when the opposing city is finally revealed.
I:14225;270;still, she adds a nice touch of mystery to the story, and her warnings serve as perfect counterpoints to the inevitable chase sequence between Jaguar Paw and members of the rival tribe.
I:14225;271;At that point, the film becomes a full.
I:14225;272;blown action picture, full of heart pounding stunts and dangerous encounters (namely with a mother jaguar attempting to protect her cub).
I:14225;273;It's actually quite exciting to watch, considering Seven and Turtles Run are still waiting at the bottom of a cave.
I:14225;274;In order to reach his family, Jaguar Paw has to be quick, cunning, and merciless, pretty much to the point of becoming the enemy.
I:14225;275;At its core, it's a Daring Escape fable.
I:14225;276;But it's surrounded by a wealth of more complex ideas, specifically humanistic ones.
I:14225;277;"This was a wise move on Mel Gibson's part
I:14225;278;This is an extraordinary tale that churns with love, fear and the fight to survive.
I:14225;279;Gibson and Farhad Safinia are an excellent team and have made a very powerful film!Chrissy K. McVay .
I:14225;280;Mel Gibson is a good actor as well as a researcher.
I:14225;281;He is a veteran of the arts, and is good at what he does.
I:14225;282;But this one I understand is a fact.
I:14225;283;History Professor suggested the movie and I must say it was pretty good!
I:14225;284;I recommend it if you haven't seen it.
I:14225;285;IT CAME in a timely manner.
I:14225;286;This is a great movie!
I:14225;287;One of my all time favorites!
I:14225;288;While not given the large attention that the Passion of the Christ got, this is at least an enjoyable film that won't really change your life or do anything significant, but you'll have fun anyway.
I:14225;289;One day, a savage group attacks their camp and those that aren't killed are enslaved and traveled a great distance to a Mayan city where some are sold off and others are sacrificed.
I:14225;290;He manages to escape and he sets off back home while being chased by a group of warriors looking to have his head.
I:14225;291;"Some enjoy both halves together while the majority will just look at the chase and go ""cool dude!"
I:14225;292;While it won't go into the collective conscious that Passion of the Christ did, it's at least an enjoyable movie for those who like some emotion with their action.
I:14225;293;The lone fighter against all odds is a recurring theme in Mel Gibson's work.
I:14225;294;Entering through a small village and the life of its gentle families, we meet the Mayans.
I:14225;295;They love their children and wives, battle their mothers.
I:14225;296;law, and enjoy playing practical jokes on gullible friends.
I:14225;297;dwelling environment is shattered, they begin a journey to another world that (and we) have never seen.
I:14225;298;Thus begins a tale, an epic journey, and masterful work of film making.
I:14225;299;The result is a high.
I:14225;300;speed, fast paced adventure that is as thrilling (and more exciting) than any cars.
I:14225;301;Gibson, the storyteller, is at his best two as we build to the big reveal in downtown Mayan.
I:14225;302;not since Gladiator have we learned so much, and been immersed so completely in the ancient world.
I:14225;303;It is breathtaking, exciting, uncomfortable, brutal, and there are deeply moving moments of human tenderness and bravery.
I:14225;304;The acting is very good, storyline is classic and universal, and the action is very exciting.
I:14225;305;At first I found it a little gruesome (and it is), but if that doesn't bother you you will love this movie.
I:14225;306;This movie has plenty of quick and violent scenes, and the camera work and shots are excellent, but there is a ton of running, the character development is fair but flimsy, and overall this turns into a 2 hour film of a man running through the jungle.
I:14225;307;Very simple premise, simple to watch, worth viewing once.
I:14225;308;Great flick with alot of action, violence and historical implications.
I:14225;309;I recommend it with popcorn and beer.
I:14225;310;I was surprised that I ended up enjoying this movie more than I had expected I would.
I:14225;311;still, the level of savagery is quite high.
I:14225;312;"Maybe another reason for the ""R"" rating is that the dress of the Maya is pretty much as you see it on the murals without any attempt to cover things to our comparatively modest standards."
I:14225;313;For them this was the good life.
I:14225;314;We have gotten to know most of the central people in this village so this event is quite powerful.
I:14225;315;He is taken captive and marched to the city.
I:14225;316;I will leave you to watch the movie to find out what happens.
I:14225;317;There is really not much dialogue so it is quite easy to follow and what little reading there is comes quite naturally after a few minutes.
I:14225;318;while certainly not for everyone, and not even young teens, it is a decent film.
I:14225;319;Not everything is historically accurate, but I certainly found it interesting to see the people in the Mayan murals come to life in their dress, hairstyles, weapons, forest habitat, cruelty, and ignorance.
I:14225;320;"I watched this movie not knowing what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised, the movie moves at a fast pace and regardless of how ""Historically Accurate"" the story is, it's a very good story."
I:14225;321;ray picture and Mayan PCM are phenomenal.
I:14225;322;I was very happy with my movie.
I:14225;323;it was in great condition, and delivery was prompt.
I:14225;324;I'm truly enjoying it .
I:14225;325;This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
I:14225;326;Mel Gibson did a great job directing this movie.
I:14225;327;It has the greatest chase scene that has ever been in a movie.
I:14225;328;But the real purpose of this movie isn't action or gore.
I:14225;329;"It starts with this quote""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."
I:14225;330;I mean it really is a mesoamerican version of America.You also have a very politically incorrect view of the Mayan Indians.
I:14225;331;Many of the politically correct have howled about Apocalytpo.
I:14225;332;This guy makes great movies.
I:14225;333;He also knows the deal about the new world order and what is going on now, and who is responsible for it.
I:14225;334;A powerful commentary on the strength and weakness of society and religion.
I:14225;335;without giving too much of the plot away, one sees a stark contrast between the beauty, parity and unity of a humble tribal village and the prejudice, oppression and fear that rules the grandiose Mayan empire.
I:14225;336;as has come to be Mel style, there are layers of meaning and powerful parallel relationships that have didactic purpose (kind of like the Father and Son theme that ran throughout Braveheart).
I:14225;337;he manages to make concentric layers of meaning from the individual to the family the tribe and the nation and their indivisibility.
I:14225;338;the ending will stun you, awaken you and make you question the status quo as well as Gibson's intentions when one considers his own religious background.
I:14225;339;It made me respect Gibson as a man who can see the the broader picture of what really matters in life and faith.
I:14225;340;the imagery is stunning and, without knowing the historical accuracy, one is brought to a time and place without the Hollywood fanfare.
I:14225;341;This was among the greatest films released in this decade.
I:14225;342;I loved its setting amid lush and savage jungles.
I:14225;343;Its vivid and violent depictions of life among the great Maya were as nothing done in Hollywood in a generation.
I:14225;344;The exciting story this motion picture told kept its rapt audience on the edge of its seat through a lengthy running time.
I:14225;345;Right up to the very end I was in love with Mel Gibson's latest cinematic accomplishment: and then in the last five minutes I was confronted with an anachronism so overpowering it shattered the suspension of disbelief that had me feeling I was witnessing the actual Mayan civilization somehow delivered onscreen.
I:14225;346;That left me genuinely saddened and very definitely puzzled.
I:14225;347;I recommend Apocalypto to anyone with an interest in ancient America, but I would like to hit Mel Gibson upside the head with a history book.
I:14225;348;I love this movie all of the cast, and crew did a wonderful job making this movie!
I:14225;349;while in labor really hits home.
I:14225;350;it's simply a movie about the power of Love.
I:14225;351;"dream ""Apocalypto"" is truly what you call heart."
I:14225;352;"caked stone steps of the cinematic ziggurat of zaniness that is Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"", it's necessary to step back a bit, take a deep breath, put down that enemy warrior's heart, drop the statue of Camazotz, and listen up: you gotta get down with Mad Mal first!What do I mean by that?"
I:14225;353;Each of us is a work in progress (except for liberals, who are spat forth pristine and perfect from their mama's hairpouch), but the fun thing about Mel Gibson is how we can relate the Man to his Movies.
I:14225;354;Happily Mel metamorphosed into something interesting, whereas Glover is know to whine about not being able to get a cab ride in Manhattan.
I:14225;355;director Mel: look, man, it's cool to be a Star: you've got, well I dunno, swimming pools.
I:14225;356;caked period piece chock full of hungry jaguars, nekkid chicks, nekkid ziggurats, nekkid high priests with old man bajoobalies, a wife in a well, a rugrat in a well, extra.
I:14225;357;and so we follow Jaguar Paw and his captured tribe to the great Mayan temple city, where the Mayans are living with each other, and the Earth Mother, in harmony, save for the occasional heart ripping sacrifice.
I:14225;358;"Anyway, just like ""Passion"", ""Apocalypto"" is spare, brooding, beautiful, and complete in itself."
I:14225;359;Director Mel has some magic in his fingers and in his camera lens.
I:14225;360;That being said, after seeing the trailer for this film at the theater, I knew I had to see it.
I:14225;361;a member of a close knit village of family and friends.
I:14225;362;gibson managed to make a fast past movie that gives us a glimpse into the mysteries of the Mayan civiliztion.
I:14225;363;The story moves along quickly and the action is well paced.
I:14225;364;The lead, Rudy Youngblood, does an excellent job as the man who's life is forever changed but is determined to save his wife and child.
I:14225;365;The visually stunning scenes of the Mayan city were incredible.Yes, this film has some violence.
I:14225;366;But try to get past it and just enjoy the film.
I:14225;367;It's an incredible story and is beautifully filmed.
I:14225;368;the soundtrack is haunting and beautiful.
I:14225;369;The young actors do great work, even though you may never hear of them again.
I:14225;370;This is another classic from Mel Gibson .
I:14225;371;the cast are all unknown and the film is all done in the Yakutan Mayan ancient language.
I:14225;372;the main theme of the film is the capture of a Mayan tribe by rivals.
I:14225;373;He is pursued by about ten men who are going to try and kill him.
I:14225;374;He must try and return to his wife and child and evade capture.
I:14225;375;the film contains some beautiful cinematographery and some of the scenery is breathtaking .
I:14225;376;especially the ancient Mayan costumes, the waterfall, the jungle and the animals.
I:14225;377;at the back of it all, this film is a good,old.
I:14225;378;It's a chase movie without the fast cars.
I:14225;379;i thought it added to the tension
I:14225;380;I loved your wonderful film on Scotland.
I:14225;381;I know you can do it.
I:14225;382;That said, this film, although colorful and well.
I:14225;383;There is one chase after the other, lots of blood and guts, and then the happy ending.
I:14225;384;It's the worst kind of trivial Hollywood entertainment, pure Saturday afternoon cartoon dreck, but it stands out from the crowd because of the expectation created by Gibson's previous work that it might be historically interesting and perhaps even inspiring.
I:14225;385;I saw this when it was in theaters and now, as then, it is a very good interpretation on what happened in Central America when the Spaniards first arrived in the 1500's.
I:14225;386;Note that there quite well may be some spoilers in this review.
I:14225;387;I find it riveting for some reason.
I:14225;388;The story here at first glance is quite simple.
I:14225;389;"There is much drama and action in all three of these tales
I:14225;390;now potential viewers should take note.
I:14225;391;The violence is brutal, heartless and above all, graphic and there is a lot of it.
I:14225;392;The graphic violence and action is almost nonstop throughout this film.
I:14225;393;On the other hand, I have a lot of general information.
I:14225;394;This is an action/adventure film.
I:14225;395;(Hey, I think Shawn Penn is an absolute twerp but have to admit the little guy can act and makes good movies.)
I:14225;396;I was fascinated with the photography in this film.
I:14225;397;it is some of the best I have seen for this particular genre.
I:14225;398;but most action adventure movies do this when you really thing about it).
I:14225;399;I liked the fact that the entire movie's dialog was done is subtitles .
I:14225;400;"I truly loved his movie ""Braveheart"" based on the true events of William Wallace in Scotland."
I:14225;401;I love movies that are based on Fact or true events.
I:14225;402;"For instance ""The Passion of Christ"" a truly wonderful movie, however you missed so much of the movie and the partayal of actual events due to the fact that you had to read each word that was spoken."
I:14225;403;"The same goes for ""Apocalypto"" the Movie was a great movie based on an ancient civilization the Mayans."
I:14225;404;I understand the desire to make the movie as original as possible, and even the clothing was as original and hand made just for this film, a lot of work and research went into this movie, not excluding the budget.
I:14225;405;Mel you are a great Actor and Director, but maybe you need to rethink the way you want your movies to be viewed.
I:14225;406;"I also believe that because you are such a great actor, you should continue to act in your films, such as ""Braveheart""."
I:14225;407;The movie was quite interesting, although not what I expected.
I:14225;408;Although I don't watch a lot of R rated movies, this one was worth it due to its historical depiction of the Mayan culture.
I:14225;409;Yes it is bloody but it is true to life for the time it is portraying.
I:14225;410;I can imagine Mel directing this spot.
I:14225;411;It is well worth watching and owning.
I:14225;412;And of course we've all heard of his meltdown in Malibu but don't let that deter you from enjoying this excellent film.
I:14225;413;The visuals and the sound are particularly impressive in Blu.
I:14225;414;ray and it fully captures what I experienced in the theatre when I first saw it.
I:14225;415;I love this movie and the blu.
I:14225;416;ray version really brings out all the details.
I:14225;417;The costuming and set design are fabulous, as are the make up, tattoo and copies of injection type patterning of the skin.
I:14225;418;It is good to hear the Mayan dialect.
I:14225;419;This culture is a good example of a religious order trying to maintain order thru fear and force.
I:14225;420;I just got a blu.
I:14225;421;ray player, so I am relatively new to this whole experience.
I:14225;422;The audience first sees him with his fellow hunters and shares in the easy fellowship that exists in the village.
I:14225;423;We admire the loving relationship that identifies him as a father and husband, but most of all it is that Rousseau.
I:14225;424;forest innocence that we covet.
I:14225;425;gibson films with amazing authenticity .
I:14225;426;wrenching moments of the sort he is famous for in Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ.
I:14225;427;We not only feel the pain, we live through the exhilaration generated when Gibson utilizes the universal power of myth where the hero travels within a mythical woods fraught with peril leading to an emotionally and physically transcendental initiation that allows him to not only combat the forces of evil, but return to his loved ones fully transformed.
I:14225;428;is Gibson merely reenacting the mythical hero's journey or is he simply employing a powerful story to underline a contemporary message?
I:14225;429;Their morality and goodness stands firm and in terms of development they remain the same from start to finish.
I:14225;430;Mel Gibson's Apocalypto may provide a colorful and raucous panoramic view of a long gone civilization, but it also exemplifies the epic tale of Jungian archetypes where trial by fire transforms and drives the representative hero to extraordinary action.
I:14225;431;Bloody in parts, it typifies that which Mel has become famous: providing a sacrificial lamb that elevates hope and common good for the masses.
I:14225;432;mel gibson is a gifted director and made this movie bloody for a reason.
I:14225;433;This is the first film in the last year that made me really fix on the screen.
I:14225;434;It has a great story, a terrific adventure and one of the most complete and hair.
I:14225;435;Mr Gibson is a great master of suspence and also a virtuoso of story.
I:14225;436;"Some scenes from this film (like that of the captives led across a river, leaving their kids behind) reminded me of the ""Passion"" and were really heart wrenching."
I:14225;437;I wish Mr Gibson will give us many more fine films like this one.
I:14225;438;This movie was very well adapted telling of the fall of the Mayans.
I:14225;439;I recomment this movie to anyone of latin decent and african americans.
I:14225;440;It's moderately impressive visually, but Mel Gibson doesn't seem to understand that a lot of pretty pictures do not a movie make.
I:14225;441;My son, a history buff, kept reminding me it went along with historical facts.
I:14225;442;Good in the midst of all that evil.
I:14225;443;The visual effects are outstanding, as is the glorious cinematography, and having a cast of unknowns portray a long.
I:14225;444;The entire film is in subtitles, as the characters relate to one another in an ancient tongue, which is yet another effective dynamic for transporting the viewer to another time.
I:14225;445;"That was true until I experienced ""Pan's Labyrinth"", which is amazing!"
I:14225;446;For a large portion of the movie, at least an hour in total, there is a fantastic chase that will leave everyone breathless.
I:14225;447;I thoroughly enjoyed this film, both as entertainment and as an artistic endeavor from all concerned.
I:14225;448;This movie is full of action and keeps you on the edge of your seat because of the action, intensity and great acting by Rudy Youngblood.
I:14225;449;The scenery is great and the characters very interesting.
I:14225;450;Despite the professional reviews on this movie, and Mel Gibson's behavior in the last few years, this is a terrific movie.
I:14225;451;I never thought I would enjoy a movie with subtitles.
I:14225;452;I was curious so I bought it and enjoyed it tremendously.
I:14225;453;I got right into the movie.
I:14225;454;I would highly recommend everyone seeing it.
I:14225;455;"The controversial ""Apocalypto"" is a film like no other, telling a compeling story of survival amidst extinction, using suspense and thrills that sends chills down the spine while being on the edge of your seat."
I:14225;456;This was not the film I was expecting to see, but came away from it with a sense of power and strength, and the emotions of the will to survive.
I:14225;457;the first 20 minutes basically sets the Mayan village setting for us, with moments of humor (good humor at that), bonding, and family.
I:14225;458;The dialouge is actually subtitled in English, which really is fitting for this movie.
I:14225;459;Some of the cinematography gives you the feel of being in a Mayan jungle, and their language adds to the realism.
I:14225;460;Powerful scenes of violence and cruelty continue constently, again adding to the realism and sickness of such an event .
I:14225;461;"The main charcatcer ""Jaguar Paw"" played by an impressive Rudy Youngblood, is captured (along with most of the rest of the villagers) by the Aztecs and leaves behind his pregnant wife and young son, though keeping them secretly in a safe location."
I:14225;462;There is a good deal of insight into what life might have been like, and the sets and imagery used for the Aztec culture is shocking to an extent.
I:14225;463;Though its a shame to see what it represents, the great Aztec city is truly a spectacular sight, and Mel did just a fantastic job mkaing it come alive on film.
I:14225;464;The camera work is very impressive with these chases, with little to no shaking occuring.
I:14225;465;the charcaters are all convincing in this film.
I:14225;466;Two very convincing and downright dirty villains are created, both of whom send a good dose of fear to the viewer.
I:14225;467;if you can deal with some disturbing scenes and lots of gore, this is a movie that everyone should see.
I:14225;468;A great look into what might have very well been for these cultures.
I:14225;469;It is very powerful and moving, and this movie is one you will never forget after watching.
I:14225;470;This is such as well made, original movie and I hope Gibson can come up with more stuff like this that's too good for the Hollywood mold.
I:14225;471;Just an all around great film by and equally great film maker and actor in his own right.
I:14225;472;I love the tribal musical beats, fantastic characters and lavish jungle scenery!!
I:14225;473;It is a must for gay and lesbian adults who love great movies!!
I:14225;474;I think its one of the best movies ever made, pretty accurate to how it was in that era.
I:14225;475;And I'd like to think I'm capable of enjoying an artist's work despite their personal meltdowns (which is why I can enjoy a Roman Polanski film).
I:14225;476;Apocalypto starts out promising, by introducing the viewer to a likable Mayan village.
I:14225;477;And since the characters are never really developed enough for you to really relate to them, the result is that it all just becomes .
I:14225;478;One of the best films ever.
I:14225;479;Sorry I waited so long to see it.
I:14225;480;My only complaint is this movie should be a lot cheaper.
I:14225;481;Mel Gibson has done an excellent job presenting a very disturbing subject.
I:14225;482;The narrated directors cut is a must.
I:14225;483;this film may be wonderful.
I:14225;484;And I most likely have bought, used and seen all sorts of work by people who were/are racists.
I:14225;485;is a rather considerable undertaking.
I:14225;486;While it is somewhat overlong, in its attempt to encompass its central themes in more detail than might have been necessary, it is an interesting effort, with many implications.
I:14225;487;There are four foci: the happy village, capture by the slavers, ceremonial murder in the City, and the chase.
I:14225;488;Save your money for a good movie instead!
I:14225;489;This is an outstanding, beautiful epic movie.
I:14225;490;I am grateful Mel Gibson has the ability and resources to recreate an amazing view of an historical situation and depict a strong, innocent, good hero.
I:14225;491;The story telling in Apocalypto is excellent.
I:14225;492;I know you here about all these movies, how good they are, and you think that its all hype.
I:14225;493;The movie was a really good adventure in which one man tries beyond human endurance to save his family.
I:14225;494;The struggle this one man endures to accomplish this is thrilling and invigorating.
I:14225;495;The scenery was great, and the dialogue was even better, so in the end you have a really good movie which is a pleasant story.
I:14225;496;I enjoy this movie, I think Mel Gibson did a great job on this and i enjoy sitting down and watching this story unfold.
I:14225;497;It is a must see for all ages because it allows the viewer to experience all the emotions life has to offer.
I:14225;498;I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but was very surprised at how powerful it was.
I:14225;499;The acting was fantastic, and even though the movie was subtitled, you grew to have great affection for some of the characters.
I:14225;500;It is brutally violent in some scenes, but it is a story about survival and love.
I:14225;501;I highly recommend this movie!
I:14225;502;It was excellent story and organized movie.
I:14225;503;to me it appeared factual and loved the entire movie
I:14225;504;One of the brothers is teased about his manhood and the others prod him to eat the testicles of the animal.
I:14225;505;the second part of the movie takes a breathtaking view of the rainforest in central America, as our hero is chased by his would be assailants, as an act of retribution for the killing of the Mayan Chief's son.
I:14225;506;tHE MAKING OF APOCALYPTOThe documentary was well done and gave a lot of insight into the research and efforts made into the costume, dances and special effects.
I:14225;507;I also enjoyed how the movie producers went into the challenges of shooting in the rainforest.
I:14225;508;The movie soundtrack is well done.
I:14225;509;The costumes are greatly detailed .
I:14225;510;ray version, you can see some of the women with their teeth in.
I:14225;511;The movie is entirely in subtitles and I recommend watching the movie first while reading the subtitles.
I:14225;512;Then I recommend watching it for the sheer beauty and details that these artists have created.
I:14225;513;cAUTIONThe brutality of the movie is intense.
I:14225;514;The fights and pursuit scenes are exciting.
I:14225;515;i highly recommend this movie.
I:14225;516;This is a masterfully created film.
I:14225;517;The images are exquisite the acting is fantastic and the storyline is powerful.
I:14225;518;The set pieces created for this film are exceptional.
I:14225;519;This is a masterpiece of a movie.
I:14225;520;this film made me feel like i had traveled thru time, what an accomplishment, the scenes at the maya empire are amazing, brutal at times but done tastfully, i am totaly impressed with mel gibson, this should have gotten a best foreign film nomination or something, hollywood is just jelous of mel gibson, cuz he can do what they wish they could do, make a great movie.
I:14225;521;the sets, makeup, and costumes, however, are great!
I:14225;522;But as a great movie to watch aswell.
I:14225;523;back to the beauty of this film.
I:14225;524;It's got lush greens, rivers, colorful makeup design, and spectacular detail in the face close.
I:14225;525;It looks better than real, it's so sharp.
I:14225;526;The detail of the blueray gets a 5, and so does the movie.
I:14225;527;For it's riveting tale of revenge.
I:14225;528;Saw it twice in the movies.
I:14225;529;It was fast paced, funny at times, and exciting.
I:14225;530;Highly recommended and in my opinion the best film of 2006.
I:14225;531;Enough of the details are accurate enough to make this a most wonderful excursion into the mists of the Pre Columbian past.
I:14225;532;Add to that superb photography and acting, a tour de force of production.
I:14225;533;This movie is very visual and the fact that it is the native language,makes it all the more believeable.
I:14225;534;A lot of blood, but the first movie that showed Mayan culture in a realistic way.
I:14225;535;But it was a fantastic thrill ride that I really enjoyed watching.
I:14225;536;Horriffic at times, poignant at others.
I:14225;537;Very original and visually stunning.
I:14225;538;This movie is so refreshing, original and realistic.
I:14225;539;For the first time we have a chance to see how the natives of the Americas lived before the Spaniards came.
I:14225;540;Realistic on every aspect, what a photography, the beautiful natural sceneries and all the details: the wall drawings, the clothes, the use of Jade, the Mayan City.
I:14225;541;And the set was built just for the movie, it's impressive that Gibson chose not to use computer generated FX!
I:14225;542;By the way, this was a nice way to raise environmental awareness without words.
I:14225;543;Plan a nice vacation to Guatemala and flight to Flores, in the Department of El Pet n.
I:14225;544;Anyone that knows anything about pre.
I:14225;545;A visual masterpiece, stunning, gripping, I'm out of complimentary adjectives.
I:14225;546;I felt as if I could reach out and touch the foliage and greenery of the forest.
I:14225;547;Great camera angles and chase scene.
I:14225;548;His reaction in scenes is priceless), storyline is 5 stars, plot is 5 stars, cinematography is 7 stars, end of movie is totally unpredicted and perfect .
I:14225;549;This movie should be elevated to the all.
I:14225;550;You know it is a fantastic movie when you can watch it again and again and again and again.
I:14225;551;This has to be the top film in any category, technical production, historical accuracy, acting, whatever, that I have ever seen.
I:14225;552;All Gibson does is take what was perhaps a little bit rare and portray it in the movie.
I:14225;553;Contrast that with the spaniards vividly portrayed in de las Casas and Broken Spears who not only were equally barbarous as the Mayans, but also gleefully enjoyed their cruelty in the pursuit of gold and riches more often than not!All in all i think this movie is the best one in years, gibson's imagery and messages are subtle but unmistakable, and as one reviewer stated, the movie does need some afterthought particularly with focus on facial expressions of the characters.
I:14225;554;acting is impeccableSimply put, well done Gibson, well done!
I:14225;555;"The Road Warrior is arguably Mel Gibson's best movie and the last 35 minutes of Apocalypto are in line with the greatest chase scene of all time which takes place at the end of ""The Road Warrior""."
I:14225;556;This has to be one of Mel Gibson's finest films (as director).
I:14225;557;The Mayan characters are well.
I:14225;558;portrayed (there's a very good balance between good and evil, and that's something that's not regularly seen in other films).
I:14225;559;The art direction and cinematography are excellent (it's unfortunate that they didn't win during the Oscars).
I:14225;560;The music is hauntingly beautiful, and the main chase sequence in the second half of the movie revs up the tension oh so high.
I:14225;561;Huh?Martin Scorsese is a fine film maker, but come on, he should hand over his statue to Mel Gibson, because in 2006, he directed the best film.
I:14225;562;each new chapter of humanity starts with a clean slate, to be better, to beget life, to provide liberty and to pursue happiness.
I:14225;563;Mel Gibson has done it again.
I:14225;564;This movie rocks and I am planning on getting it so I can watch it many times over.
I:14225;565;Good shall win over evil.
I:14225;566;I thought it was amazing and can't wait to see the entire movie.
I:14225;567;you ve got my respect
I:14225;568;This movie is action packed from beginning to end!
I:14225;569;Plus it's a wonderful love story that has endurance as well.
I:14225;570;It's set in the time of the Mayan civilization and is very interesting and intriguing to think about their way of life back then.
I:14225;571;And my husband and I LOVE it!!
I:14225;572;It arrived very quickly and we are very happy Amazon!
I:14225;573;I would recommend this movie to all action/love/history story lovers!!!
I:14225;574;This is a most see Movie for all to enjoy.
I:14225;575;It it is great for the whole family!
I:14225;576;It's okay for Jesus to bleed but not Mayans?This was a great film from start to finish.
I:14225;577;Lots of action, great storyline, thrilling, edge of your seat scenes.
I:14225;578;"Fundamentally, it turns into a revenge film which keeps me from giving it 5 stars and Gibson is certainly a sadist who has a god/martyr complex but he deserves great credit for bring this ""history"" to the screen."
I:14225;579;And the fact it's in a native language is key .
I:14225;580;I highly recommend Rapa Nui if you liked this film .
I:14225;581;"it's actually a much better story but with ""english speaking characters."
I:14225;582;It would be THE perfect cautionary tail.
I:14225;583;This is, at all technical and crafts levels, an astounding, state.
I:14225;584;disc presentation hits all the marks technically.
I:14225;585;dwellers, has taken heat for one of its historically inaccurate elements.
I:14225;586;Historical accuracy aside, this is a great film!
I:14225;587;This is one unique action, adventure flick!
I:14225;588;It simply tells a story.
I:14225;589;what Gibson is able to achieve in many parts of this film is a fast.
I:14225;590;paced, yet mysterious and eerie atmosphere.
I:14225;591;There are moments, like at the film's beginning, when the quiet tranquility of the tribe's home is juxtaposed by the intrusion and ruthlessness of the other clan.
I:14225;592;There are many chase scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat, and you feel yourself rooting for Jaguar Paw to make it back to his wife and kid as the rain starts pouring.
I:14225;593;if you can forgive Gibson for his shady reputation and just take in this film, I think you will find his film quite original, and scenery impressive for the film's mood.
I:14225;594;"If you have seen all these movies, you'll understand what I'm talking about when you see ""Apocalypto""
I:14225;595;consciously though of these great 80 flicks while making this Mayan film.
I:14225;596;i recommend this movie for a mature .
I:14225;597;the movie was very well done!it keeps your intrest,you can almost feel what they are going through,another great movie by mel gibson!!!!
I:14225;598;this movie is great in that it attempts to bring to life a vanished culture but I think it missed the mark regarding cultural accuracy.
I:14225;599;Lots of action and costumes, great sets and cinematography, fabulous story.
I:14225;600;But you see, one most understand the movie one's looking at.
I:14225;601;"Back to the movie ""Apocalypto"" It is a masterpiece and a unique movie that keep you glued to the screen for the entire duration of the movie."
I:14225;602;Isn't this what we are looking for in a movie anyway?Kudos to Mel Gibson and please, please keep making movies like this, please!
I:14225;603;"century before Columbus, and 500 years after the ""classic"" period of Mayan culture had ended)."
I:14225;604;"The two have often been compared in terms of violence, but the connection goes quite a bit deeper this
I:14225;605;The ending is a bit of a quandary, certainly more open to interpretation than that of THE PASSION.
I:14225;606;but striking the same tone and tying all the subtextual imagery directly to the Roman Catholic Church.
I:14225;607;the truly great thing about APOCALYPTO is the technical brilliance and artistic eye that Gibson and his team bring to the project.
I:14225;608;It's visually dazzling, and Gibson and cinematographer Dean Semler have knack for selecting one knock.
I:14225;609;Everything from cast to costumes is truly amazing, and the film moves with tremendous speed.
I:14225;610;One has to wonder at the motives here, particularly when the producer.
I:14225;611;Three stars for technical brilliance.
I:14225;612;Feel like living in the Maya world, though fictional, story is touching and real, great on blu.
I:14225;613;Mel Gibson creates one of the most stunning visual movies ever.
I:14225;614;Most great movies have one great villain.
I:14225;615;This movie gives us TWO great counterparts to Rudy Youngblood's hero.
I:14225;616;This is one of those movies where the more you watch it the more enjoy the camera angles and incredible moments.
I:14225;617;The jungle scenes are stunning in their movement and suspense.
I:14225;618;The casting in this film is top.
I:14225;619;I have no doubt that decades from now this film will be highly regarded as one of the best of this era.
I:14225;620;What A Ripoff this business is!
I:14225;621;"When I first watched ""Apocalypto"" in 2006 I thought is was a masterpiece."
I:14225;622;Watching it again confirms my initial reaction to the movie, it is an excellent piece of filmmaking that will be watched, and talked about for decades to come.
I:14225;623;The script, performances, cinematography and direction are flawless, but what sets it apart as an action adventure film is its primeval truth of the human condition.
I:14225;624;the second half of the film is a metaphor, presented as a thrilling chase, of humanity's genius and luck in surviving and ultimately thriving against all the odds.
I:14225;625;"Jaguar Paw and family are the victors of those conflicts, and survivors of an apocalypse
I:14225;626;The uncomfortable violence, and cruelty depicted in the film, is the truth of that journey.
I:14225;627;The scenery is beautiful and I really like the music.
I:14225;628;A welcome change of pace for us who feel Hollywood keeps making the same picture over and over again.
I:14225;629;"when Braveheart came out over 10 years ago I remmember a friend telling me: ""who would have thought Mel Gibson was a real director"", 2 films later he keeps surprising me with his directing skills."
I:14225;630;Mixture of Horror, action, community spirit, family, slavery,The very first time I saw this movie was on cable channel, thought I get a copy for myself, got the blu.
I:14225;631;ray and enjoyed it even more.
I:14225;632;If you like road warrior, youre going to enjoy this one.
I:14225;633;i'm sorry, but Mel Gibson is capable of so much more.
I:14225;634;He's a VERY talented actor and director.
I:14225;635;what really shines in this movie is the revival of Mayan speech and dialect.
I:14225;636;It is astoundingly convincing and I think Gibson could have leveraged this more, given the amount of work involved by the actors.
I:14225;637;Also, the costumes are amazing.
I:14225;638;mayes Rubeo did a fabulous job.
I:14225;639;The Mayans achieved some amazing feats of invention, despite their bloodthirsty rituals.
I:14225;640;Surely he knows the terrain very well.
I:14225;641;great idea, but he prepared only three thorns?
I:14225;642;I'd move on and watch something else.
I:14225;643;Lovely realization of costumes and sets.
I:14225;644;For adults with a strong stomach.
I:14225;645;Not much of this grand pageantry anymore.
I:14225;646;the extra scenes about the making of the film were excellent.
I:14225;647;"It was that realistic, so that even the ""wild"" fashions of the era seemed natural on the people."
I:14225;648;it was great to get a better idea of Mayan .
I:14225;649;Entertaining, well, not really in a fun sense.
I:14225;650;It was a gripping, tension.
I:14225;651;As a good film ought to, it pulled me into the experience of the characters.
I:14225;652;I see many viewers felt entertained in a good way .
I:14225;653;it is possible to draw parallels between Mayan behavior and corporate culture.
I:14225;654;I see deep discussion material.
I:14225;655;day Ezra Pound: creative genius who got kneecapped over some foolish behavior, and then rescued from the cage where he was being held on display by some transcendent piece of work!
I:14225;656;the movie was hobbled right from the beginning with the language.
I:14225;657;Gibson somehow succeeded in making and distributing a film that does much more than just entertain.
I:14225;658;From the opening scene, the moviegoer is transported to an alien world that most have next to no knowledge of.
I:14225;659;The Maya civilization is brought to life, complete with believable characters, incredible costumes and magnificent architecture.
I:14225;660;"It is also well known that the Maya were more advanced in astronomy than any European civilization of the day
I:14225;661;It is well written, with fully fleshed characters.
I:14225;662;The fact that this film holds the viewer's interest is all the more amazing when one considers the fact that there is not a single word of English in the entire film.
I:14225;663;Like many good movies with subtitles, the story is so enthralling that after a time one forgets about the writing at the bottom of the screen.
I:14225;664;"in the end, ""Apocalypto"" is really about devotion to family, and survival against the odds."
I:14225;665;The exotic backdrop of the Maya civilization only adds to what is already a great story.
I:14225;666;columbian history along with some terrific entertainment.
I:14225;667;Viewing APOCALYPTO is a visual and visceral experience: some of the most beautiful cinematic depictions of skies, jungles, raging rivers and extraordinary recreations of Mayan temples and peoples fill the screen for a very long two and a half hours.
I:14225;668;But the effect presented is richly colorful and imaginative.
I:14225;669;the cast responds well to the direction of Mel Gibson.
I:14225;670;Visually the movie is stunning though in a graphically gross sort of way.
I:14225;671;A sad depiction of a great nation.
I:14225;672;While they are being taken as prisoners, our hero manages to save his pregnant wife and small child by putting them in a pit.
I:14225;673;She tells them of a great darkness that will befall the Mayan civilization resulting from a solar eclipse and of a man who will run with the jaguars.
I:14225;674;Mel Gibson the actor (Funny, cool, and a nice guy) but Mel (the director) he is serious, likes history, but he also likes a lot of gore and brutality to help express his story telling.
I:14225;675;garde cities, the towering pyramids, their mathematics, and even their astronomy.
I:14225;676;He understands (through his research, right!)
I:14225;677;Because, he uses themes from his previous films that he has directed and acted in.
I:14225;678;One example that comes to mind is the fighting sequences used toward the end of our film.
I:14225;679;But what really got my attention is that he had to take themes from Predator and some reminders of Home Alone.
I:14225;680;please, if you are going to see this movie with the intent of understanding the Mayan Culture and their advancements.
I:14225;681;Mel Gibson continues his blossomed directorial deftness with this film.
I:14225;682;Gibson's understanding of the proper use of violence within the storyline is akin to Spielberg's of special effects.
I:14225;683;a film that, while beautiful to watch, lacked the central intensity and edgy.
I:14225;684;Apocalypto succeeds on all accounts.
I:14225;685;Rudy Youngblood, the main character in Apocalypto, deserves at least an Oscar nomination, if not winning it, for his superb performance in this film.
I:14225;686;He is quite charismatic and magnetic on screen, lending to beautiful photography and awe.
I:14225;687;Every scene has a purpose for being there.
I:14225;688;The movie discusses the inner quest for freedom and survival.
I:14225;689;not just entertaining us in the process but making us experience this epic journey, about the confrontation of our fears, as if it were our own.
I:14225;690;He definitely knows how to tell a story but in Apocalypto he truly shows talent, vision and truth in a way you cannot find in many movies nowadays.
I:14225;691;I initially didn't want to see this, but a friend of mine whose opinion I trust told me it's a great film.
I:14225;692;"He said ""yeah, Gibson's crazy, but he's a great filmmaker""."
I:14225;693;this is a great film, a really stunning piece of work that's remarkable in many ways.
I:14225;694;It's a very good film, filled with truly awe inspiring scenes, especially in the middle of the film when the action reaches the Mayan city.
I:14225;695;The Mayan city sequences alone make the film worth watching, as they are astounding and the best of Gibson's career as a director.
I:14225;696;The Mayan city was all a set, one of the biggest ever built, and kudos to the production designer for this magnificence.
I:14225;697;After the action leaves the city, the film is still mesmerizing with a great chase sequence ending the film.
I:14225;698;professional actors is nothing short of amazing.
I:14225;699;They're so natural, realistic, and authentic.
I:14225;700;The costume design, makeup, and set design are all excellent, and Gibson deserves full credit for making one of the most unique films in cinema history.
I:14225;701;If you don't like Gibson as a person, you should try and put it aside and see this excellent film.
I:14225;702;first they cut out the heart.
I:14225;703;This they interpret as the Sun God being satiated.
I:14225;704;And they take the prisoners to the gauntlet to run for their life.
I:14225;705;well worth watching ,but it is very bloody.
I:14225;706;good movie, somewhat gruesome, and the whole movie is in subtitle.
I:14225;707;But I really enjoyed the movie, not good for kids.
I:14225;708;Humorous and a bit gory at times, but still appropriate given the theme.
I:14225;709;On my top ten list!
I:14225;710;A film is a team work, result of hundreds of artists contributing to every second of it.
I:14225;711;i am awarding the best movie of the year to this film.
I:14225;712;the scenes are simply breath taking, actors are well chosen and acted.
I:14225;713;ray I received is showing the film in adjusted cine.
I:14225;714;One of the few things that stand out in this film is how good the acting is.
I:14225;715;i loved the two major villains of the film.
I:14225;716;What I absolutely loved about the film is the taunt of one of the villains (Clue .
I:14225;717;This does figure among the top ten movies I saw in 2006 and believe me, I've seen my fair share.
I:14225;718;A huge cheer of respect for Mel Gibson.
I:14225;719;We just got done seeing this movie at the theater.
I:14225;720;The good guy escapes, gets revenge, and saves his family.
I:14225;721;It's not a great film, but it's well done for what it is.
I:14225;722;in terms of the way the Mayans were represented in the film, I thought it was a bit over the top.
I:14225;723;that in itself is a huge achievement.
I:14225;724;Especially by Hollywood!Keep up the good work, Mel.
I:14225;725;Hide the children and the faint.
I:14225;726;APOCALYPTO is an epic movie which narrates the savage adventures of a young hunter, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), in the waning age of the Mayan civilization .
I:14225;727;The glory and savagery of the Mayan culture are in full depiction here as we are treated to majestic temples and pyramids rising up in cinematic grandeur, followed by intense, gory scenes of unhinged violence and vicious sacrifices (decapitations, eviscerations, bodies being pierced, and, in one brutal moment, a face being bit off by a jaguar .
I:14225;728;tinged with prophecy and doom and resplendent with truly spectacular cinematography, APOCALYPTO is also well served by the acting performances of the unknown cast.
I:14225;729;A standout, of course, is pow.
I:14225;730;wow singer and artist Rudy Youngblood, who makes his acting debut here and boldly carries the film.
I:14225;731;Dalia Hernandez (Seven, Jaguar Paw's pregnant wife) also acts for the first time and acquits herself well.
I:14225;732;Mel Gibson dips his hand once again in riveting myth.
I:14225;733;The first half of the film is punctuated by awesome world.
I:14225;734;That Jaguar Paw can sure take a licking.
I:14225;735;Think what you will of Mel Gibson, he is a great filmmaker who will not stint on his cinematic visions.
I:14225;736;And, in that purview, I do respect him.
I:14225;737;like at times, and truly majestic.
I:14225;738;It's a beautifully rendered film with jaw.
I:14225;739;dropping scenery, moving imagery, and phenomenal characters.
I:14225;740;"In essence , while the film does a great job of ""hinting"" the demise of the Mayan empire, it does an even better job of detailing the interactions between the Mayan ""kidnappers"" and their captives."
I:14225;741;The conflict between these two groups reveals some of the most charismatic moments in the film.
I:14225;742;Gibson has a remarkable way of finding actors with no training and directing Oscar.
I:14225;743;"Like ""The Passion"", he again succeeds in not only bringing a subtitled film successfully to a mainstream audience, but he introduces to some of the most memorable moments on film delivered by actors unknown to the entertainment world."

I:14225;746;then this is a great movie for you.

I:14225;752;Throughout human history life had little to no meaning to nearly every culture until Christianity arrived and the hearts of those in the culture were changed.
I:14225;753;this movie was very good.
I:14225;754;this is a great story and a fascinating psuedo.
I:14225;755;I enjoyed it for what it was .
I:14225;756;a very entertaining adventure film.
I:14225;757;Folks, the comfortable world we live in today is unique and sorry if the world was not always like that.
I:14225;758;ray has to be the best thing that has happened to me.
I:14225;759;I bought the movie in blu.
I:14225;760;ray and it was fabulous viewing.
I:14225;761;To start with, i love the movie and more so, the landscape, scenes are so real and so fabulous, it is like watching through my window.
I:14225;762;A must see movie and a must see in Blu.
I:14225;763;Mel Gibson is the ultimate visionary in movie making.
I:14225;764;He has easily eclipsed his peers.
I:14225;765;On APOCALYPTO, his third milestone masterpiece, Gibson creates a most stunning, provocative portrait of what his instincts and genius gift of vision bring to reality in present tense what most likely is an accurate picture of the lost Mayan civilization in the jungles hundreds of years past.
I:14225;766;His films inspire and speak volumes for themselves upon viewing.
I:14225;767;We are so enraptured in his art that we can't help but follow with fascination.
I:14225;768;He could easily create another incredible epic of universal acclaim if he decides to produce the Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Civilization in one of his future cinematic endeavors.
I:14225;769;Mel Gibson was only warming up, observing, learning and absorbing during his era of role playing in front of the camera through the first phase of his film career.
I:14225;770;He will continue to amaze us with his wondrous epics of sights and sounds for the remainder of his illustrious and spectacular career, whether in front, or behind the camera.
I:14225;771;It was a very big surprise of the ending.
I:14225;772;This movie was something great to see.
I:14225;773;The location of this movie was interesting.
I:14225;774;Oh and I don't look for faults in movies just watch and enjoy.
I:14225;775;Truly a very original and creative movie that moves at a relentless, breakneck pace.
I:14225;776;Great direction, photography and surprisingly good acting by unknown actors.
I:14225;777;I saw this movie at the recommendation of one of my fellow co. workers whom is a big movie buff.
I:14225;778;the opening sequence is intense, and within just a few minutes you realize that you are in for alot of gore and alot of action.
I:14225;779;either way, the most interesting part of the movie, in my opinion, is the backdrop of the time.
I:14225;780;I personally would have enjoyed more of this part of the story.
I:14225;781;For example, how did these people react to the men invading their land, bringing with them new customs, new religion, and devastating diseases.
I:14225;782;Having said that, the movie does a superb job in portraying the despair that the Mayans felt when they reailzed that their way of life and even entire villages were rapidly dissapearing, if at the hands of their own.
I:14225;783;Mel Gibson ( who is the best Hollywood has to offer) scores an impressive hit in this first class thriller!A great deal has been written about the historical accuracy of the film.
I:14225;784;"it is true that the Mayans built such ""temples"", and it is true that human sacrifice was practiced."
I:14225;785;Other elements of the film are extrapolations, educated guesses, and ways to carry the story line along.
I:14225;786;kudos, Mel , on a great film!
I:14225;787;Apocalypto was a surprisingly decent film, and this blu.
I:14225;788;Video and audio are great, some of the best I've seen on blu.
I:14225;789;Definitely pick this one up if you like this movie at all.
I:14225;790;And this is one of many theories today among historians concerning the Mayans.
I:14225;791;This is a film focusing on the heroes journey, much like Greek myths of old.
I:14225;792;Maybe he shoots it like that because that is how he wants it!
I:14225;793;Maybe that is his style, and when I think of any Mel Gibson film I always love how they do not hold back or be PC about situations.
I:14225;794;Because to me, 5 star would be Braveheart, and though this is certainly not that film, I still think its entertaining, beautiful in photography, sets, costumes and makeup, with a good well paced story to it.
I:14225;795;Pictures that move and tell a story on their own.
I:14225;796;Gibson gets my highest respect for that one.
I:14225;797;I watched it twice with in the first 3 days of purchasing it I enjoyed it so much.
I:14225;798;The landscape is amazing and the movie in general is just well done, you feel like you are along for the ride the whole way.
I:14225;799;As beautiful and adventurous as this film is, there is very little emotional resonance, exactly the kind of thing I expected to get.
I:14225;800;All these events and things happening to the one character at one time is really far.
I:14225;801;Hats off to Mel and his crew for making a great film with no spoken english, yet very easy to follow and even easier to get wrapped up in.
I:14225;802;I look forward to Mel Gibson making more real historical films, which I personal wish Mel Gibson would make a real film about the social psychology of 'African American Slavery in the United States of America' if we must consider the value of moral values in contrast to democracy, which non existent in 2014.
I:14225;803;First of all, i will like to thank director mel gibson, for bringing a piece of hispanic culture to the big screen and to the whole world.
I:14225;804;well finally we get to show some talent, self.
I:14225;805;respect, and culture with apocalypto.
I:14225;806;even thou its not that loyal to the real thing, but it represents for sure.
I:14225;807;I really enjoyed the film.
I:14225;808;But there's a deeper message here in that the human spirit, especially when motivated by love, is perennially strong, as is the tendency for humans to slaughter.
I:14225;809;It is the extreme between the two that Apocalypto encapsulates in a brutally honest way.
I:14225;810;Of course many Mesoamerican cultures were brilliant and attained great engineering capacities.
I:14225;811;but showing the holistic nature of the human experience was Gibson's goal.
I:14225;812;Violence and peace, savagery and civility, are more intimate partners than we'd like to admit.
I:14225;813;Such is our brilliance and our downfall.
I:14225;814;I was really transported into another place and time.
I:14225;815;as for the protagonist, this was one of the most engaging cat and mouse chases i had witnessed on film, especially when the jaguar popped out.
I:14225;816;this movie was good enough to make me actually want to go back and research the history of the Mayans, so it gets an extra star just for making me want to learn something.
I:14225;817;Put your hate aside to enjoy a great film.
I:14225;818;This film grabs hold of you and doesn't let go until the credits, it is unbelievably detailed, well.
I:14225;819;made and just all around great.
I:14225;820;This is the story of a Mayan who escapes captivity to return to the pregnant wife and son he has hidden in a well.
I:14225;821;Usually it is the kind of story that I love but this movie seemed more interested in showing needless violence than in telling the story.
I:14225;822;"up of Mel Gibson's incredible movie ""The Passion""."
I:14225;823;but in the heart of Mel's other movies (like Braveheart), the cinematography is amazing.
I:14225;824;Even the story is fantastic but the end resolution left me a little bit in disbelief.
I:14225;825;Apocalypto is at times an energetic and kinetic chase film set in the jungles of Central America.
I:14225;826;Worth a watch, and enjoyable for the most part, it does feature several drawbacks that hamper one's enjoyment of the film.

I:14225;828;The water should A. let his wife and child live longer, as it will allow them to drink and B. allow them to reach the surface when the pit fills all the way.
I:14225;829;Graphic, horrific, and yet deeply beautiful, Apocalypto is a fast paced rollercoaster ride that grabs you and doesn't let go.
I:14225;830;could have done without the strong sexual innuendos, but the film was gripping.
I:14225;831;It is an action adventure thriller like no other.
I:14225;832;mel Gibson usually makes great movies, but he really outdid himself with this one.
I:14225;833;But if you don't watch this one, for any reason, you're really missing one of the most affecting and exhilarating films of all time.
I:14225;834;This movie is fantastic .
I:14225;835;but, I hope you don't mind reading subtitles!
I:14225;836;The movie is a bit graphic, so for you viewers that have a sensitive stomach .
I:14225;837;I love that it's done in the authentic language, it tells a powerful story, it is quite the thriller, and it has a great ending!
I:14225;838;I would recommend this movie to anyone!
I:14225;839;Apocalypto is a great MOVIE.
I:14225;840;Very original,probly the most original film I've seen.
I:14225;841;i was very surprised at how great this movie is,very good filmaking.
I:14225;842;That's one way we can truly appreciate life and being alive.
I:14225;843;That's how much the lesson is worth.
I:14225;844;Their human sacrifices are well.
I:14225;845;documented, and some of their victims unwilling.
I:14225;846;ultimately, if one goes beyond the gore, the personal bias and the outstanding cinematography, 'Apocalypto' is a very simple, human tale that transcends its setting and cultural trappings.
I:14225;847;it is a story of loss and the awakening to a harsh reality and the desire to defend one's family, land and way of life.
I:14225;848;It is a story of the power of the human will to live.
I:14225;849;The action and storyline is tremendous and thought provoking and graphic.
I:14225;850;Very exciting and beautifully shot.
I:14225;851;Instead, this movie is very real, and in Mel Gibson's way, has a powerful message to tell.
I:14225;852;"This movie is shocking, but behind all the violence and gore, there is a message that anyone can see, and despite the ""R"" rating of this movie, this movie is definately worth watching."
I:14225;853;I thought it was extremely well done.
I:14225;854;Mel Gibson is a real artist.
I:14225;855;This movie is a work of art.
I:14225;856;from A to Z, actors to zoology, is pure art.
I:14225;857;As a Native American (Spirit Lake Dakota Nation), I feel that it is the best movie yet that depicts the beauty, power.
I:14225;858;and compassion of Native people of the Americas.
I:14225;859;Apocalypto is a stunning adventure film.
I:14225;860;Therefore, the more you can live in its reality moment to moment, vs. anticipating scenes described in a review or watched in a preview, the greater will be your enjoyment.
I:14225;861;THEN enjoy these Amazon reviews and their richness of observation and updates on where Mayan scholarship takes us today.
I:14225;862;"my husband has many books about the Maya, including Bernal Diaz's amazing ""The Discovery and Conquest of Mexico: 1517.1521."""
I:14225;863;It's quite stunning to see the faces and profiles of the actors, as well as their clothes and makeup, look so much like suddenly living visions of the glyphs carved on rock in numerous Maya sites.
I:14225;864;He still acknowledged it to be a heck of an action picture!
I:14225;865;Apocolipto is the newest film by actor/director Mel Gibson.
I:14225;866;First off the film is accurate with most things.
I:14225;867;He also uses the native Mayan tongue throughout the entire film.
I:14225;868;to me Mel did a wonderful job in keeping this story and look of the film as real as possible.
I:14225;869;I think the film is an honest look at these people that we know little about and how their culture is beautiful yet barbaric, much like our own.
I:14225;870;First and foremost he is a suburb director and knows how to tell a compelling story with just images.
I:14225;871;Take out all the subtitles and this film still is entertaining not to mention you would be about to grasp most, if not all, of the major plot points.
I:14225;872;This film is compelling and moving, anytime you can connect with people that have been gone for 500 plus years you are doing your job as a director.
I:14225;873;The best type of ending to a movie is when it leaves you guessing, wondering but yet satisfied that you've come to a concussion of this story.
I:14225;874;I wish more films were done with such care, precision, passion and admiration for the subject matter.
I:14225;875;This film was ambitious and the end product is a masterful piece of hardcore action/adventure entertainment.
I:14225;876;If you want to see a truly brutal film, wait until they make an accurate depiction of what the Spanish/European conquerors and explores did to the indigenous people of this region and North America as a whole.
I:14225;877;"Yet, he's unafraid to pull techniques from the ""everyman's director book."""
I:14225;878;Somehow, in between horror freaks and hungry arthouse schoolers, you have this film fit into.
I:14225;879;I wonder how well this film will do.
I:14225;880;I saw this film on the first Saturday it opened, during the afternoon.
I:14225;881;Pretty good, considering how informed audiences tend to be.
I:14225;882;It certainly brings the action for the jocks, and the after movie gossip fuel.
I:14225;883;As a movie, it deserves a shot.
I:14225;884;"I mean it in a ""Passion"" way."
I:14225;885;a captured warrior in a rescue to his family.
I:14225;886;Horrific as it may be, it's a love story at the end of the day along with a lot of action.
I:14225;887;And yes, there's a beating heart lifted from a sacrificed man's chest by a blood.
I:14225;888;The glimpses Gibson provides of Mayan civilization are jaw.
I:14225;889;You won't ever see a more convincing cinematic evocation of another time and place in such scope and meticulous detail.
I:14225;890;As an historical observation, the film is brilliant, depicting the violence in most of the movie.
I:14225;891;Finally, as a work of art, this film is unparalleled.
I:14225;892;I found it to be one of the most beautiful films I needed to see even though it took me some time to view it but I'm happy that I did.
I:14225;893;Its dialogue is entirely in Mayan language with English subtitles, a remarkably bold decision by Gibson, and one that pays dividends.
I:14225;894;On one level it unites an international cast, sparing us any clashing accents, and gives the film a greater sense of authenticity.
I:14225;895;this is truly the best movie I've ever seen.
I:14225;896;Perfectly made with a great story, great characterization, great customs, great music, great camera work, and a realness not found in any other film.
I:14225;897;this movie crosses the boundaries of film as a spectator entertainment and makes it a deep emotional struggle to the end.
I:14225;898;This is a beautifully made movie with a great story.
I:14225;899;If you can get past these you can enjoy an original and timeless movie.
I:14225;900;This movie is one of the best I have seen because I really enjoy movies that are full of action and especialy when it pertains to perserverance and courage.
I:14225;901;I have a collection of these types of movies and I enjoy watching them especialy when I think I need a little pick me up to keep me going.
I:14225;902;This movie is more than just entertainment.
I:14225;903;It comes with a very thought.
I:14225;904;Fabulously breathtaking and totally awesome (and I mean the literal awe.
I:14225;905;Mel Gibson has offered a candid look at one of the most eccentric cultures in the western hemisphere.
I:14225;906;soaked adventure takes you for a ride and doesn't let you off until the very end.
I:14225;907;the protagonist, Jaguar Paw is captured, along with the survivors of his village, and taken to the ancient Mayan city, where he is to be offered up as a blood sacrifice in one of the infamous Mayan rituals.
I:14225;908;Jaguar Paw then makes one of the most exciting attempts to escape certain death that I have seen on film in a few years.
I:14225;909;It also piques the curiosity about ancient Mayan civilization.
I:14225;910;It has a good story line, and the battles were realistic.
I:14225;911;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
I:14225;912;up personal life, the guy is a creative genius.
I:14225;913;There they come upon a culture they never knew existed, vastly superior to their own, and built on a caste system that depends heavily on slave labor.
I:14225;914;And in a thrilling plot twist, once he manages to get back to familiar territory, the tables are turned when Jaguar Paw has the home.
I:14225;915;And the haunting sound track helps to make us feel we're deep in the middle of 15th century meso.
I:14225;916;taken as a whole, Apocalypto is a knockout film experience.
I:14225;917;adventure film that will keep you mesmerized from beginning to end.
I:14225;918;Apocalypto is an R. rated, action.
I:14225;919;There are lots of lovely women who share their assets with the camera, however, this film makes such an effort at realism that it doesn't seem like gratuitous exploitation eye candy just for the sake of the rating.
I:14225;920;The reality is that civilization triumph as depicted in this movie.
I:14225;921;This movie looks fantastic, has great characters, and has many cool parts that you will enjoy watching over and over again.
I:14225;922;As a stunningly visual action film depicting the depths of man's potential inhumanity towards their fellow man, Gibson has a winner.
I:14225;923;The cast and crew do a fine job of bringing the Mayan world to life.
I:14225;924;The second half of the film is a little long and drawn out but the final hour of the movie is truly exciting.
I:14225;925;Leading up to the ending will leave everyone breathless.
I:14225;926;"Fans of Gibson's previous epic films will enjoy ""Apocalypto."""
I:14225;927;Mel Gibson, totally love him, terrific actor and those BLUE eye!!
I:14225;928;He created an amazing film!!
I:14225;929;Amazing actor, one for sure if they were unknown before the film I'm sure they are getting jobs now.
I:14225;930;It is a good movie and enjoyed it, But not as suspenseful as I would have suspected, But all in all a good movie to see
I:14225;931;Cut out a man's heart and watch him squirm as you raise it up to the gods.
I:14225;932;At least the Indiana Jones movie was fun.
I:14225;933;Writers with talent are non existent these days, it's all special effects, forget about an original story.
I:14225;934;It was a whole lot of jungle with some special effects of Mayan buildings, and Mayan costumes, nothing great.
I:14225;935;there is plenty of action in the movie and it is fast paced.
I:14225;936;If you don't care about a good story and just want to see plenty of action and special effects then you will probably enjoy this movie.
I:14225;937;ray version much more vivid in color.
I:14225;938;I would highly recommend watching this movie if you want to escape your every day routines.
I:14225;939;it shows a for most viwers a very unknown civilization, illustrates personal and societal struggle and also awakens basic human instincts in the viewer.
I:14225;940;I think that the movie definitely deserves even more attention than it already enjoys.
I:14225;941;It really catches the viewer!!!
I:14225;942;But, watch it and you might be surprised by how much you enjoy it.
I:14225;943;"Brilliant cast, good story
I:14225;944;Chased by a horde of angry Aztecs, he eradicates them in grizzly and ingenious fashion.
I:14225;945;the story builds the baddies as the meanest nastiest guys in South America, so PLENTY of entertainment value (and cheering) when they get it.
I:14225;946;This is an interesting film.
I:14225;947;It is an adventure story set in Meso.
I:14225;948;the story is of a fairly rural village that is happy enough and getting by.
I:14225;949;For the men, it is much less pleasant.
I:14225;950;the remaining men are taken out to play a game where they are promised their freedom is they successfully run a bloodthirsty gauntlet.
I:14225;951;"i was also surprised to read that many people interpret the brief appearance of the Spanish as a way of saying, ""These people found Jesus and got saved."""
I:14225;952;apocalypto has a lot of beautiful imagery, even if some of that beauty is sickening.
I:14225;953;The color, costumes, and makeup of the Mayans are captivating.
I:14225;954;The darker aspects of our nature are very seductive and alluring, and Apocalypto does a good job of making the viewer appreciate just how easy it is for us to love the worst aspects of our nature.
I:14225;955;I was very surprised to see such an insightful commentary in a Gibson movie.
I:14225;956;I would recommend Apocalypto to a discerning viewer.
I:14225;957;also, kudos to the one reviewer who caught the strong similarities to Rambo.
I:14225;958;Despite the photography, the exotic civilization, and the engaging actors, you never fully engage with this work.

I:14225;960;Reunion of him with his wife and children is an effective and moving moment.
I:14225;961;Photography has many beautiful shots.
I:14225;962;Acting and direction are both good.

I:14225;976;I have a lot of respect for Mel Gibson's historical story.
I:14225;977;The depth and detail seems to increase with each film.
I:14225;978;With Apocalypto, again Mel Gibson seems to surpass himself in the creation of this story and the use of incredible detail.

I:14225;985;The action is excellent and if you enjoy movies from the far past then you will enjoy this movie.
I:14225;986;though it depicts rather graphically the time of the American conquest, it is a very well done movie, helps understand the perils of the time and the life of both cultures.
I:14225;987;Mel Gibson once again proves his prowess as a filmmaker, this time immersing us into the world of the Maya in the midst of their decline as an empire.
I:14225;988;Through the eyes of one character, Gibson allows us to peek into a world many of us have only read about, or briefly studied in a history class.
I:14225;989;An epic in length and in sheer scope, Apocalypto is a dazzling spectacle that is nearly impossible to look away from, showcasing the immensity of a once.
I:14225;990;great civilization, and the violence and corruption with which it destroyed itself from within.
I:14225;991;Apocalypto is an amazing epic that will have you both astonished and on the edge of your seat.
I:14225;992;apocalypto is unlike any movie I have ever seen.
I:14225;993;It's like being on a rollercoaster in a sense that you are feeling pure adrenaline!
I:14225;994;Mel Gibson did a an amazing job.
I:14225;995;The actors, the makeup, wardrobe, the camera work, the directing, the location etc. was all brilliant.
I:14225;996;This movie makes you feel like you are right there with them.
I:14225;997;the action is what tells the story.
I:14225;998;It tells a lot about how it came to be and how everyone was transformed into character.
I:14225;999;this movie is pure genuis, entertaining and a must see!!!!
I:14225;1000;I've read alot of books about the Maya, nice to see some of it on my TV.
I:14225;1001;The ending isnt right, with the Spanish coming over at that time, but.
I:14225;1002;its still a good movie.
I:14225;1003;Go visit the Yucatan and see the ruins, its amazing to stand there.
I:14225;1004;I saw this movie in Lisbon, Portugal and I'm speechless with this master piece witch shows perfectly the decline of one civizilitation.
I:14225;1005;The story, the realization, the strength of all the characters, the rhythm, the power of this film makes it one of the best movies of the year.
I:14225;1006;Very focused on the main character, but amazing attention to detail on all the movie's periphery.
I:14225;1007;seat action movie, a quintessential `guy movie' with a lot of emotion to boot!
I:14225;1008;And all the spectacle and lavish detail that we used to associate with the legendary Cecil B. DeMille!
I:14225;1009;Very impressive, Mel!As you probably know, the story is set among the Maya Indians of Mexico and central America, just at the time of the arrival of the Spanish following in Columbus's wake.
I:14225;1010;wrenching aspects of the film).
I:14225;1011;But Jaguar Paw manages to elude them, taking to the jungle as he hurries home to find his wife and son.
I:14225;1012;for a little over two hours, the movie immerses us in an exotic world.
I:14225;1013;like the Aztecs, the Maya made a spectacle of cutting the hearts out of their victims and holding them aloft, to the great delight of the people.
I:14225;1014;While much of the scenery is beautiful.
I:14225;1015;the lush jungle, waterfalls, the city.
I:14225;1016;And yet, with all the bloodshed and action, this is a movie with heart.
I:14225;1017;Also, the movie gives a Politically Incorrect (but historically accurate) view of native Americans, who are assuredly NOT living in peace and harmony together, and who sold each other as slaves and practiced a religion of human sacrifice.
I:14225;1018;(The fact that the Europeans ended the human sacrifices is, let us admit, a good thing.)
I:14225;1019;The actors in the cast are all unknowns (to Americans, anyway), which is good, since we almost feel we are watching a documentary.
I:14225;1020;Gibson used lots of Mexican locals as extras, and they are refreshingly real in front of the camera.
I:14225;1021;It is one of the creepiest scenes in the film, one of many which bring home the reality of the human tool taken by these raiding expeditions.
I:14225;1022;We remember an earlier scene where she appeared to be a thorn in his side and are rather touched as she touches his shoulder as he is being led to death.
I:14225;1023;Gibson proved again what a great director he is.
I:14225;1024;He should make more epic films of this nature.
I:14225;1025;This one is a very interesting film.
I:14225;1026;The images are great, and the life in a Mayan society cannot be better expressed.
I:14225;1027;But the concept of the film is striking: the reasons why a culture created the roots of its self.
I:14225;1028;The fact that the film is spoken in Yucatan's Mayan dialect is very important, because it provides a sense of reality.
I:14225;1029;"The end of the film is striking, and resembles me the final beach scene of the ""Planet of the Apes"" with Charlton Heston, but with a more promising message, much in common with Mel Gibson's clear religious position."
I:14225;1030;I liked the end very much, and probably it is one of the most important assests of the film.
I:14225;1031;For me, being partly Mexican, it is an important point.
I:14225;1032;this is a very good movie.
I:14225;1033;even the fighting scenes, chasing sequences and the outcomes were almost the same.
I:14225;1034;this is a well directed movie.
I:14225;1035;just take it easy and watch it as an action packed, well developed, well directed, edited and most of all, well performed thriller.
I:14225;1036;What makes this movie great is that it has poetic elegance.
I:14225;1037;Also, several scenarios carry universal human appeal.
I:14225;1038;But history is always full of lucky coincidences.
I:14225;1039;Good show, brings you closer to your animal self.
I:14225;1040;packed but also soft and emotional.
I:14225;1041;Great movie, though not for young kids as the violence is gory.
I:14225;1042;There's always an element of fiction and historical inaccuracy in Hollywood, so sit down and enjoy the film and then afterwards read some good history books to get the real picture.
I:14225;1043;This is an intense action.
I:14225;1044;adventure giving us a glimpse into the end of days of the Mayan civilization.
I:14225;1045;The film is beautifully photographed, acted, directed, and scripted (in subtitles).
I:14225;1046;Mel Gibson is a brilliant director, with this being a beautiful piece of work.
I:14225;1047;I would highly recommend this movie.
I:14225;1048;Everything was great, except I order this movie in english and received it in the mayan language.
I:14225;1049;After watching this film I have come to the conclusion that Mel Gibson is the greatest director of our time, if not of all movie history.
I:14225;1050;His last three films Braveheart, Passion of the Christ, and Apocalypto are stunningly original, daring, and all have a specific and unique vision which is excellently carried out.
I:14225;1051;The story is intriguingly original and the fast pace makes the time spent watching the film fly by.
I:14225;1052;Another reason I love this movie is the positive way it portrays the mothers, self.
I:14225;1053;Even the use of this(to most of us) unfamiliar language is handled well,and never does its unfamiliarity distance us from the story.
I:14225;1054;The use of the language is very believable, and it is very easy to suspend one's disbelief that these are not in fact native speakers.
I:14225;1055;I really enjoyed this film.
I:14225;1056;Ok, well the acting is amazing and Mel Gibson did a good job on filming the Mayan empire almost exactly as I would imagine it to be.
I:14225;1057;I have enjoyed the movies that Gibson has directed and been in but this movie went too far.
I:14225;1058;It will make you want to throw up.
I:14225;1059;After watching this movie 4 times in last week (and for the first time), I absolutely, positively have put it at the top of my greatest movies ever list (just above The Godfather, Gladiator, The Usual Suspects and To Kill a Mockingbird).
I:14225;1060;You will be hooked on it immediatley due to character development and the dialogue.
I:14225;1061;You are then taken on an amazing trhrill ride with an incredible plot (I won't disclose anything for those who have not seen it).
I:14225;1062;The scenery and filmography are amazing, and its meanings are timeless.
I:14225;1063;"Then our brave boys have a little fun with ""organ meat"" before returning to their wives and families in their peaceful, relatively primitive village."
I:14225;1064;(You gotta make a few sacrifices when you live in the big city, you know.)
I:14225;1065;"are subjected to a game of ""you run to freedom, whilst we throw sharp instruments at you."""
I:14225;1066;there's a lot of pretty scenery.
I:14225;1067;(this kid, a native who only speaks Mayan, is great in this role BTW).
I:14225;1068;Mel Gibson is obviously a controversial filmmaker.
I:14225;1069;None of that really matters to most viewers though and I'm here to tell you that most viewers will find that this movie is about as intense and compelling as you can get.
I:14225;1070;genres mended together in an amazing setting that most viewers will find authentic.
I:14225;1071;The civilization in this movie is the ancient Mayan civilization and there is a genuine attempt at convincing the audience we are watching from a time machine.
I:14225;1072;I can tell you one thing, it hooked me in a lot more than English would have and helped me delve a little deeper and go back in time a little more efficiently than most historical depictions by a long shot.
I:14225;1073;His name is Jaguar Paw and he is a Mayan man with a young son and a pregnant wife.
I:14225;1074;He and his friends get a good look at how the Mayan civilization is in decline from greed, disease, self.
I:14225;1075;That alone praises the film's passion.
I:14225;1076;I bought into this movie entirely while watching it and it even prompted me to learn more and study the points of contention many people have with Gibson's depiction.
I:14225;1077;I'm just reviewing this for anyone looking to see a good film.
I:14225;1078;Mel Gibson is no doubt good at what he does and Apocolypto is very well done also.
I:14225;1079;"There will be mixed feelings towards this movie I'm sure as there were towards 'The Passion of the Christ"" but this is a good movie."
I:14225;1080;Apocalypto shows a young mans amazing and heart pounding experience during the decline of the Mayan Civilization.
I:14225;1081;As the viewer you can barely see what has caught the men off guard because it is hiding so well in the jungle.
I:14225;1082;I don't want to give away anything but lets say that Jaguar Paw makes one of the most courageous and exciting stands ever.
I:14225;1083;i saw Apocalypto and as I was watching all the things most movie previews promise came true in this film.
I:14225;1084;"All the ""Heart Pounding"", ""Jaw Dropping"", ""Nonstop Action"", and ""You'll be on the Edge of Your Seat"" promises came true."
I:14225;1085;This movie has such a realistic feel to it as well as these actors.
I:14225;1086;You can feel it all from the fear to the determination and courage of Jaguar Paw.
I:14225;1087;The acting is so good that you forget that they're actors and believe that they're really the characters they're portraying.
I:14225;1088;mel Gibson did an amazing job in making these settings and people look so real.
I:14225;1089;Because the elements of Jaguar Paw being very outnumbered it makes a high demand of physical and mental endurance to survive in a jungle and this movie becomes more interesting.
I:14225;1090;Apocalypto is an amazing movie that I would recommend to many but be ready to sit on the edge of your seat cause you'll be there for most of the film.
I:14225;1091;It was well put together and the family has watched it enough times.
I:14225;1092;Being a new time in history to document and present to the public as informative entertainment leaves many avenues of presentation to investigate.
I:14225;1093;Mr. gibson's views on possible historical interpretation is fabulously inventive, dramatically overwhelming and probably true.
I:14225;1094;I might be strange, but I liked this movie a lot.
I:14225;1095;I enjoyed it so much that I forgot that it used subtitles, and that is not an easy thing to do.
I:14225;1096;The cast as well as the hundreds of extras are absolutely convincing as Mayans.
I:14225;1097;Great directing keeps everything flowing smoothly (though I could have done without the pig.
I:14225;1098;testicle eating scene in the opening), and despite a traditional story, makes the film quite a unique experience, imparting a sense of discovery as the story unfolds.
I:14225;1099;"I will make this short and sweet as there are so many reviews of this movie: ""Apocalypto"" is a modern work of art and is, perhaps, one of the finest films ever made."
I:14225;1100;Visually stunning, the movie is an emotional and intellectual feast.
I:14225;1101;mel Gibson has a fine acting career, but this film proves he could well be (with the exception of Peter Jackson) the most gifted director we have today.
I:14225;1102;Thanks to all who worked so hard to make this work of art .
I:14225;1103;"With ""The Passion of the Christ,"" Gibson proved that a film can be great even if the audience has to rely on subtitles to get them through the film."
I:14225;1104;The story is told through the eyes, actions, and emotions of each character.
I:14225;1105;Warriors from another, more powerful tribe, attack the village, take prisoners, and abandoned the children.
I:14225;1106;encrusted culture that base their lives around it.
I:14225;1107;On one hand you have a tale of a family whose love for one another keeps them going.
I:14225;1108;On the other hand you have a great chase tale that will hold you in your seat for the entire running time of the film.
I:14225;1109;gibson has done a masterful job with this film.
I:14225;1110;He's taken core characters with minimal dialogue and created great heroes and villains with them.
I:14225;1111;The actors and actresses in this film perfectly exude their respective intentions flawlessly.
I:14225;1112;You immediately pick up on who's the strong.
I:14225;1113;well done flick that deserves repeat viewings.
I:14225;1114;but after all he is our hero!Its adrenaline .
I:14225;1115;an exciting chase movie, shot in Mexico, which is set in ancient Maya with dialogue spoken in Yucatec Maya.
I:14225;1116;the subject matter, subtitles, and lack of star power made it a bold choice for a major studio release.
I:14225;1117;"And while I wouldn't go to either of those extremes, ""Apocalypto"" is certainly an accomplished adventure picture."
I:14225;1118;Youngblood's wife and son are stranded in an underground well, many others are murdered, and Youngblood is among a dozen or so who are rounded up and marched out in bondage.
I:14225;1119;The action is practically nonstop, it's inventive, and it is beautifully staged.
I:14225;1120;"Much of ""Apocalypto,"" therefore, is absolutely riveting and wildly entertaining."
I:14225;1121;Apocalypto, at heart, is an effective action picture that makes interesting use of its Mayan setting.
I:14225;1122;"I suppose what makes ""Apocalypto"" more vivid is that the violence is in a believable context."
I:14225;1123;Beautifully filmed, the technical merits of the film are beyond reproach.
I:14225;1124;The cinematography, score, and editing all enhance this exciting tale.
I:14225;1125;I imagine these elements really shone bright for those who saw this on the big screen.
I:14225;1126;A great action picture that is for adults.
I:14225;1127;The visuals of this film were stunning .
I:14225;1128;I found the characters very believable and well acted.
I:14225;1129;I also found the village people to be very relatable .
I:14225;1130;I especially enjoyed when the spoiled royal son annoyed his mom at the ceremony and she snapped at him.
I:14225;1131;With just a few exceptions, all the gory.
I:14225;1132;or a great many other films out today.
I:14225;1133;this is a wonderful film not worth missing.
I:14225;1134;Not everyone will love it as much as others, but there is SO much to SEE in it.
I:14225;1135;One of the guides stated this movie depicted what life could have been like in those times very well.
I:14225;1136;The story line was good and we thoroughly enjoyed the movie although it was gory at times.
I:14225;1137;I saw it for the first time and am very impressed with what a great job Mel Gibson did on it.
I:14225;1138;I usually prefer comedies and chic flicks and there are some spots I had to look away due to the gore, but the plot and the suspense were good.
I:14225;1139;He and his family and friends live peacefully in the depths of a great forest until the tranquility of their sheltered existence is pitilessly wiped out by a band of brutal marauders led by the bestial Zero Wolf.
I:14225;1140;It is, like Joseph Conrad's immortal novella, a quest into the very heart of darkness, and Jaguar Paw and his world will never be the same again.
I:14225;1141;taut, engrossing, and incredibly thrilling, APOCALYPTO delivers on many levels.
I:14225;1142;As an action movie alone it is a success, but that ignores the thoughtfulness and care that has gone into the script and direction.
I:14225;1143;This is one of those stories that can perhaps be interpreted in many equally valid terms, and the parallels between the Babylonesque Mayan culture and our own are indeed frightening.
I:14225;1144;Rudy Youngblood is exceptional and empathetic as the benighted Jaguar Paw, and Dalia Hernandez is just as good as his young wife, whose own subplot of self.
I:14225;1145;discovery, courage and faith is a vital element of the broader story.
I:14225;1146;Raoul Trujillo's Zero Wolf is one of the great villains of movie history, and to put it mildly you have to love to hate him.
I:14225;1147;The supporting players are well.
I:14225;1148;rounded and handle their various roles believably and uniformly well.
I:14225;1149;the cast as a whole may be unknown, but unknown or not, they're very good.
I:14225;1150;all these things and more, APOCALYPTO is a tribute to the power of story and its power to capture the essence of reality.
I:14225;1151;Even so, APOCALYPTO is a grand achievement, and impossible not to recommend to discerning adults.
I:14225;1152;With the success of theThe Passion of the Christ, Mel can pretty much do anything he wants now.
I:14225;1153;Speaking of sacrifice, you will see a ton of that in this movie.
I:14225;1154;He is a part of a small village of hunters.
I:14225;1155;The movie starts of with a very humorous sequence that shows Jaguar and a few others playing a joke on another tribesman.
I:14225;1156;This truly established that these were fun loving, normal people.
I:14225;1157;This sets up a huge chase scene with a ton of great moments.
I:14225;1158;The ending to the movie is a surprise and if you know your history is very interesting.
I:14225;1159;member cast looked perfect, but added in people ripping out organs that took me out of the film.
I:14225;1160;Also, I'm really happy that they gave us subtitles for the alternate commentary.
I:14225;1161;"Mel Gibson's (known for directing ""The Passion Of The Christ"" (2004) and ""Braveheart"" (1995), for which he won an Best Director Oscar) directing is excellent!"
I:14225;1162;This is one of the best films of the year.
I:14225;1163;The story and screenplay by Gibson and Farhad Safinia is excellent.
I:14225;1164;The performances by two unknowns, Rudy Youngblood and Dalia Hernandez, are excellent.
I:14225;1165;"The music by James Horner (won the Oscar for his work for Best Original Score for ""Titanic"" (1997) is excellent."
I:14225;1166;"The cinematography by Dean Semler (who also did the cinematography to ""We Were Soldiers"" (2002), a movie Gibson starred in and also won the Oscar for his work on Kevin Costner's ""Dances With Wolves"" (1990) is excellent."
I:14225;1167;The casting by Carla Hool is excellent.
I:14225;1168;"The production design by Thomas E. Sanders (who also did ""Braveheart"", ""We Were Soldiers"" and ""Maverick"" (1994), another film that Gibson starred in) is excellent."
I:14225;1169;The art direction by Roberto Bonelli is excellent.
I:14225;1170;The costume design by Mayes C. Rubeo is excellent.
I:14225;1171;This is another bloody epic from the vision and the mind of Mel Gibson, but it is another excellent epic from the vision and the mind of Mel Gibson, who doesn't stop to amaze the audience.
I:14225;1172;This is a visually sweeping epic that doesn't know when to quit.
I:14225;1173;Apocalyto was definately the best movie i have seen in a while.
I:14225;1174;Im even more impressed with Mel Gibson.
I:14225;1175;Everything about the movie was so real to me, and the acting was the best ive seen in a while (Rudy Youngblood was mesmerizing, and totally hot).
I:14225;1176;I recommend it to anyone.
I:14225;1177;"Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" is the tale of a protagonist (Jaguar Paw) caught up in the epic and often tragic tale of civilization."
I:14225;1178;It is a story of courage, love, cruelty, and honor.
I:14225;1179;What fallows is a journey to a still grand but declining Mayan city and a lone journey to save his family.
I:14225;1180;The Mayan civilization seems so foreign and yet so familiar to the modern world.
I:14225;1181;although shot in an ancient language, the subtitles and story are easy to follow.
I:14225;1182;The film has many memorable and haunting scenes including the attack on the village, the diseased girl predicting the fall of the Mayas, and the protagonist stumbling into a field of bodies reminisent of a Khmer Rouge killing field.
I:14225;1183;overall, a beautifully filmed and at times disturbing image of the individual and civilization as a whole.
I:14225;1184;Good story of life .
I:14225;1185;Family is everything and they give you the strength to face adversity and go on.
I:14225;1186;This was a very exciting movie.
I:14225;1187;With amazon prime I ordered it one day and rec'd it the next.
I:14225;1188;Anyone who has read National Geographic knows the Mayans were among the best astronomers, and their calendars were so precise they do not repeat for thousands of years (our Gregorian calendar repeats in six, if I'm not mistaken).
I:14225;1189;otherwise, the film is OK.
I:14225;1190;very good acting and directing.
I:14225;1191;really keeps you on the edge of your seat
I:14225;1192;Good deal for the price.
I:14225;1193;law problems, love and cherish their children, and so on.
I:14225;1194;That's a good object lesson for us even today.
I:14225;1195;"But the ""soul"" revealed in Mayan art is truly horrifying."
I:14225;1196;mel Gibson gave this art a background for me that finally helped me to make sense of it.
I:14225;1197;When you take those things in the context of what has happened to the U. s. since 9.11, and you compare it to the society depicted in this movie, there are unnerving parallels.
I:14225;1198;it was beautifully photographed, with fantastic sets and I have to say that the violence was not gratuitous: that's just how things were then and to have made the movie otherwise would have been cheating.
I:14225;1199;"well worth watching
I:14225;1200;semitic elements, this was potentially a major nail in the coffin for Gibson.
I:14225;1201;This is too bad, because the film is a visual delight.
I:14225;1202;More important than the Durant quote is the story told that night by the village elder of how human beings always want more, despite having the best gifts from each of the animals of the forest.
I:14225;1203;"Death Proof was suppose to be a big time chase movie, but I have to tell you ""Apocalypto"" is a whole lot better in that regard."
I:14225;1204;"The movie I was reminded most of us ended up being ""The Last of the Mohicans,"" not just because most of the action takes place in a lush green forest, but also because most of the memorable moments in both films have to do with people look at each other."
I:14225;1205;I want to add that my favorite performance in the film was by Morris Birdyellowhead: in his final scene as Flint Sky, I was no longer aware that he was acting, so thoroughly had he become his character for me.
I:14225;1206;Apocalypto was nominated for Oscars for Makeup, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing, and certainly the makeup and costumes we see in the Maya city are absolutely spectacular.
I:14225;1207;This movie was recommended to me by my sister.
I:14225;1208;I can honestly say it is one of the very best movies I've ever seen.
I:14225;1209;I like a story with some closure at the end, and this movie has that.
I:14225;1210;The behind the scenes options on the menu portion are fascinating and worth watching.
I:14225;1211;up and costumes are amazing and authentic according to the research done for the movie.
I:14225;1212;It was a great movie, with only Native actors whose performance I give an A+.
I:14225;1213;I hope Mel Gibson does some more movies with American Indian actors.
I:14225;1214;Yes, Mel is controversial, but so is Woody Allen and critics still herald him as a genius.
I:14225;1215;It's still haunting, exciting, mystical, scary, depressing, fascinating, and beautiful.
I:14225;1216;I was totally blown away by this film's lush setting, tragic characters, and vividly bloody scenes.
I:14225;1217;my favorite character was the man assumed to be infertile.
I:14225;1218;I felt sorry for him as the others made fun of him, as his mother.
I:14225;1219;I found it intriguing that their society blamed the man for infertility .
I:14225;1220;"The obese, ""upper class"" young boy who giggled and pulled at his mother's dress in impatience perfectly depicted how torture is entertainment for the entitled (although the masses obviously enjoyed it as well)."
I:14225;1221;The violence here was so shocking, so striking, and the images stay with you for awhile.
I:14225;1222;And what is the ultimate peace?
I:14225;1223;Indeed, he went far enough, and made a good point.
I:14225;1224;If you see this movie, you'll be pleasantly (or rather unpleasantly) surprised by how strongly it takes hold of you.
I:14225;1225;The film sheds light on the exotic Mayan civilization as it brings to the screen the tale of a young man captured during a raid, who tries to escape from his captors in order to get home where he has left his wife and child helpless and vulnerable.
I:14225;1226;the movie follows a pragmatic and realistic account of life in the Americas in the 15th Century.
I:14225;1227;The film brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, Jaguar Paw, and his quest of returning home to save his family, and on the other (and to a lesser extent), the deteriorating conditions (civil war, decadence, disease, drought, corruption) which led to the decline of the Mayan civilization and its eventual demise at the hands of the Spanish Conquistadors.
I:14225;1228;the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.
I:14225;1229;All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!The setting (!)
I:14225;1230;, the music, and the costumes are all wonderful!Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought.
I:14225;1231;provoking movie that will definitely provide for an evening's entertainment.
I:14225;1232;I love this movie and recommend it to everyone Iknow when favorite movies comes up in conversastion.
I:14225;1233;It is one of those movies you think the subtitles would be a distraction in but they are not and even tho' the's no english, you get involved with these guys,& the surprise ending is great.
I:14225;1234;I love Mel Gibson movies.
I:14225;1235;I'd recommend to anybody looking for an action packed adventure.
I:14225;1236;great film from long ago.
I:14225;1237;It is a must see movie.
I:14225;1238;The actors they choose for the movie did a great job.
I:14225;1239;If you are delighted by films like Saw and Hostel, you will love Apocalypto.
I:14225;1240;Later, a human sacrifice has his heart ripped out and held aloft, still beating.
I:14225;1241;If you can make it through, the last quarter is a great action movie and the viewer can finally cheer.
I:14225;1242;But the overall spirit of the movie revolves around the love of the Jaguar Paw for his family and heritage.
I:14225;1243;It is beautifully filmed and the acting is excellent.
I:14225;1244;there are several memorable characters: Jaguar Paw of course, Flint Sky, father of Jaguar Paw has numerous great scenes including a humorous one.
I:14225;1245;You can feel how solid and strong he is.
I:14225;1246;Middle Eye is the wonderfully crazy and well acted.
I:14225;1247;if you don't mind the violence, or can get past it, this is a superb movie.
I:14225;1248;I almost missed the mesmerizing experience of viewing this captivating movie by Mel Gibson.
I:14225;1249;What a dramatic and emotionally packed film this is.
I:14225;1250;"For instance when the tribe is invaded, Gibson sets up ""emotional killings."""
I:14225;1251;I loved this movie and had been waiting the majority of the year to see it.
I:14225;1252;My heritage is Mexican and it was a big deal for me to finally see a respectable attempt to portray some of my ancestors on the big screen.
I:14225;1253;It was classic Mel Gibson and having loved his other movies, I should've expected I would love this one as well.
I:14225;1254;"My only beef is that I keep reading reviews and moviegoers refer to the ""mean Mayans"" or the fantastic ""Mayan city""."
I:14225;1255;Something else I loved about the movie were the political nuances portrayed in the eclipse scene.
I:14225;1256;The elite of these societies were great astronomers and knew exactly what was happening during the eclipse.
I:14225;1257;I loved that Gibson shows that manipulation by the High Priest/royalty of the populace by making them believe that it was the sacrifices that had brought back the sun.
I:14225;1258;I love that Gibson includes this, but I wonder whether the audience picks up that it's meant that way.
I:14225;1259;If you like to learn anything about our history as a paople then you will love this movie.
I:14225;1260;bigger and better!Whether you love him or hate him, obviously the vast majority rule that Mel Gibson can not only act, but direct movies with the best of them.
I:14225;1261;This is without a doubt one of the best films ever made.
I:14225;1262;filled with such raw beauty and savage violence, Gibson is smart enough to balance it with showing the love and caring his characters evoke.
I:14225;1263;this movie shines beautifully on my 65.
I:14225;1264;Apocalypto is an epic of two Mayan tribes at war.
I:14225;1265;It created a interest in the history of the Myan people.
I:14225;1266;I knew then, I wanted to watch this movie again.
I:14225;1267;He puts us face to face with mortality, the spurting, pulsing reality of our flesh and blood.
I:14225;1268;The fact that it isn't pretty.
I:14225;1269;Like all of us, he's got a bit of the bigot in him.
I:14225;1270;this is a fine film, a true meditation on the human condition, and a welcome respite from all those folks who see the world in black and white .
I:14225;1271;Through a twist of fate and spurred by the power of his love for his woman and his family he will make a desperate break to return home and to ultimately save his way of life.
I:14225;1272;the story is simple .
I:14225;1273;Well at least he manages to save himself and his family.
I:14225;1274;Mel Gibson clearly has problems with race, religion and the universal belief system.
I:14225;1275;It demonstrates and captures native people without bias.
I:14225;1276;Put simply, you will see how a society lived without a central government, militia, commerce, business, schools, hospitals, electricity or technology.
I:14225;1277;This movie brings to life at close range a peak into what it was like in the everyday life of native people of the americas in an unpolluted environment.
I:14225;1278;Conclusion, you will honestly appreciate this movie.
I:14225;1279;"my husband and I watched it ""on demand"" last night and were absolutely riveted to the screen."
I:14225;1280;Say what you want about Mel Gibson .
I:14225;1281;I liked the movie from beginning to end.
I:14225;1282;The thing I forgot from previous viewing is the subtitles.
I:14225;1283;They're recreating the Mayans so this is understandable.
I:14225;1284;Overall good movie to have in your collection : )
I:14225;1285;A very intense and violent film.
I:14225;1286;Interesting in the adventure gender.
I:14225;1287;Another great foreign film by Mel.
I:14225;1288;It's an entertainment picture, not a documentary.
I:14225;1289;The picture and sound is incredible.
I:14225;1290;There is no doubting that the technology is a huge leap forward.
I:14225;1291;the film itself it very good.
I:14225;1292;I recommend this film to everybody who can recognise great sights and sounds.3 .
I:14225;1293;ray disks based on my experience with this one.
I:14225;1294;The actor who played Jaguar Paw was a beautiful young man.
I:14225;1295;With his lovely wife Seven and their young son they formed a very attractive proto.
I:14225;1296;The urban Mayan temple episode was fascinating and horrifying.
I:14225;1297;Private pleas to gods and ancestors.
I:14225;1298;Pretty much like religion today.
I:14225;1299;the sweet strongman with reproductive issues .
I:14225;1300;(I really liked the Blunted character.)
I:14225;1301;"Happily there was a bit of the formula ""good guy opens up a can of whoopass on the baddies"" to make a regular Joe like me happy."
I:14225;1302;The definition and graphics allowed me to enjoy the movie even more.
I:14225;1303;That Movie gives you a New Experience in watching a Movie.
I:14225;1304;Soon this Move brings you to a never seen before World.
I:14225;1305;Everything seems to be real as you watching the Movie.
I:14225;1306;body experience, also on a stage in front of a cheering mob.
I:14225;1307;Think about it: hunt, cook meat, eat, hang around the hut, do over again the next day.
I:14225;1308;What else is there?Well, okay: the body paint.
I:14225;1309;But you can get a nice set of those at Miss Fantasia's Boutique.
I:14225;1310;I'm not a fan of Mel Gibson, the person, but as far as this film goes, I'm most certainly a fan of his work.
I:14225;1311;I'm more than happy I did after seeing this revolutionary work.
I:14225;1312;all in all, a decent film, beautifully filmed with interesting characters and a view of a society that we rarely (if ever) get to see a glimpse of.
I:14225;1313;This is a superior movie.
I:14225;1314;beauticul actors who really deliver nicely.
I:14225;1315;It will hold your attention throughout.
I:14225;1316;The plot was great and so were the actors.
I:14225;1317;This one of my favorite movies.
I:14225;1318;Just having some good manly fun.
I:14225;1319;apocalypto was definitely a surprise.
I:14225;1320;But honestly it's just a story based around the Mayan timeframe.
I:14225;1321;While some of the beginning is a little slow to some, I found it fun and interesting.
I:14225;1322;It was nice to see them just joking around and having a good time with one another.
I:14225;1323;The action scenes were done really well also.
I:14225;1324;It's got a lot of good action scenes in it, and it has a great story.
I:14225;1325;I don't care what you think of Mel Gibson and his personal issues but Apocolypto must be seen because this is an example of excellent film making.
I:14225;1326;This movie is thrilling from beginning to end.
I:14225;1327;The action is incredible and after about 10 minutes you forget that there are subtitles.
I:14225;1328;The story grabs your attention from the first scene.
I:14225;1329;This movie was was true to historical events at the time, was immaculately filmed, had a great story,was gripping as well as acceptably gory, was extremely well acted and kept us on the edge of our seats to the very end.
I:14225;1330;tis a bit gory in spots, but very interesting to watch.
I:14225;1331;Mel Gibson does a great job on this film.
I:14225;1332;Mel Gibson does an awesome job showing how the Mayan's livedback in the past.
I:14225;1333;This movie has a unique plot and setting.
I:14225;1334;The production is very realistic and you won't be bored!
I:14225;1335;This is a great adventure story.
I:14225;1336;It is amazing how Mel Gibson directs movies.
I:14225;1337;he is extremely amazing as a director!Its hard to swallow when watching some of the very graphicscenes.
I:14225;1338;It is, so to speak, a protrait of that famous Mayan civilization.
I:14225;1339;His story shows the tribulation of his captured groups members, until one day when he manages to escape.
I:14225;1340;What now happens is an incredible man.
I:14225;1341;I don't want to reveal too much of the rest of the story, suffice it to say, that it is really realistic, and especially the way that the movie was filmed was simply amazing.
I:14225;1342;by the way, to keep the reallistic atmosphere of the movie in tact, the whole film is done with subtitles, leaving the actors to speak in their native language.
I:14225;1343;This, I think, was absolutely necessary to keep the authenticity of the film.
I:14225;1344;apocalypto gives us a full.
I:14225;1345;There's excellent use made of the production, the sights, the sounds, to give you the most vivid, lively, and emotional experience as you can imagine.
I:14225;1346;great movie only regret that wacth this only once you have to be open minded to appreciate this kind of work
I:14225;1347;Because you have a good and brave heart Metamorpho, is all he said.
I:14225;1348;Because we're going to paint you blue, is all he said.
I:14225;1349;I knew that I was capable of that, after all, we all are considering modern day life.
I:14225;1350;Here we are able to glimpse the astounding glory of this civilization.
I:14225;1351;The temple pyramid is enormous and we are able to see the vastness of the city stretched out around it.
I:14225;1352;The square, the marketplace, and other pyramids.
I:14225;1353;Jaguar Paw and all of us were then painted blue and led to the top of the pyramid.
I:14225;1354;Anyway, we somehow survived and Jaguar Paw somehow managed to escape.
I:14225;1355;This is when your adrenalin starts to kick in as you see event after event unfold that make the chase even more suspenseful.
I:14225;1356;there are all sorts of elements in this movie that relate to the overall picture.
I:14225;1357;in the final analysis, this is a guy's flick.
I:14225;1358;And, just when you think he's through, he gives you more, and then more.
I:14225;1359;The movie is adventurous, harrowing, horrifying and yet you are somehow fascinated and lulled into this world.
I:14225;1360;the bonus features here really give you an excellent view of how this movie was created.
I:14225;1361;up that is unique to the many characters in the film.
I:14225;1362;After seeing this movie, it is clear to me that Mel has become a considerable and very talented director and producer.
I:14225;1363;Your heart will palpitate for sure.
I:14225;1364;": ""Blood is the way to go."
I:14225;1365;Mel Gibson's personal imperfections aside, this film is simply a cinematic masterpiece.
I:14225;1366;Visually arresting and thoroughly compelling from start to finish.
I:14225;1367;Received this item in excellent condition, NEW, and at a speedy pace!
I:14225;1368;affirming tale that values human dignity over what humanity often degrades into.
I:14225;1369;A brilliant cast and crew drives home a message of hope too often missed today.
I:14225;1370;This movie looks so real that you forget it is just a movie, I though it was like a documentary about real people the makeup was so well made and the story.
I:14225;1371;"hence the mystery that has surrounded them for centuries) yet at times profoundly touching and personal, Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" is, after all is said and done, after all is shown on the screen, a story about one man, Jaguar Paw (a terrific Rudy Youngblood) and his family (wife Seven played by Dalia Hernandez, his son and his father)."
I:14225;1372;"As ""Braveheart"" was basically about William Wallace, so Director Gibson smartly uses one character as a repository of all his thematic material thereby focusing not diffusing our attention on something upon which we cannot relate (though, to be truthful and based on Gibson's recent public outburst, you can't help wondering what the subtext here is."
I:14225;1373;jaguar Paw, as one of the many captured by the ruling tribe, is the center of our attention thereby making his plight personal.
I:14225;1374;to me all that is important about Gibson as a director is that he makes good movies.
I:14225;1375;"And ""Apocalypto,"" though not up to the level of his ""Passion of The Christ"" is a very good movie."
I:14225;1376;It's furiously paced, it's beautiful to watch, the acting is first rate and it is infused with the sounds and vistas of an almost mystical and very much mysterious time and place: a place and a time that Gibson brings alive by way of his special and profound magic.
I:14225;1377;the movie is a good action tale and the use of subtitles is no problem.
I:14225;1378;It's the best told naked people in the jungle movie I have ever seen.
I:14225;1379;bonus points for the seductive natives.
I:14225;1380;My father saw Apocalypto, bought the movie, and demanded I watch it.
I:14225;1381;So on Christmas Eve, my brother, my father, and I gathered around to watch a heartwarming family movie about human sacrifice.
I:14225;1382;i knew a lot more about Aztec and Mayan culture than my relatives, so much of what happened (or was about to happen) took on special significance for me.
I:14225;1383;apocalypto encompasses everything you ever wanted to know about Aztecs.
I:14225;1384;It's all here: black panthers, Aztec martial prowess, steaming jungles, ziggurats, and a twist ending that ties it all neatly in a historical bow.
I:14225;1385;Much more exciting are the thrilling chase and combat sequences, some of the best on foot.
I:14225;1386;given that this is a film about a time before modern convention, it's amazing how Gibson fits in movie conventions usually associated with car chases.
I:14225;1387;There are twists in Jaguar Paw's escape and his hunt by the Aztecs that are worthy of any action movie.
I:14225;1388;The movie's so enthralling that you stop noticing it a few seconds in.
I:14225;1389;I eventually got this as a gift.
I:14225;1390;I can watch this movie over and over.
I:14225;1391;The subtitles are perfectly done.
I:14225;1392;It is an amazing video with a great script, dialogue, music and video.
I:14225;1393;This is the most innovative movie I have seen in 20 years .
I:14225;1394;How often have you seen narrative without the noble native fable.
I:14225;1395;fresh off of his Passion of the Christ work, in which he laughed at traditional movie distribution all the way to the bank .
I:14225;1396;the movie, for the most part, is historically accurate, with some liberties taken to enhance the awe of the spectacle.
I:14225;1397;"Instead, he returns to his wife and seeks a ""new beginning"" deeper into the forest, away from the Spanish."
I:14225;1398;Particularly interesting is the making of the city and costumes.
I:14225;1399;the film itself is phenomenally entertaining and anyone caught up in the 2012 meme .
I:14225;1400;"You'll be seeing a lot of reviews that will tear the film apart for it's inaccuracies, some people are ""into that""."
I:14225;1401;The film takes a lot of Creative License, but, aside from that, it's a great story.
I:14225;1402;He manages to escape and is chased by Mayan fighters through the jungle.
I:14225;1403;"If ever there was a great movie of courage, strength and the belief of a higher power
I:14225;1404;Pretty graphic, but what an awesome movie!
I:14225;1405;This movie has a plot, exciting, dangerous and I think very good and real.
I:14225;1406;I wonder how times were back then and this movie brings that out.
I:14225;1407;Yet today, true to the natural order of a modern great pagan.
I:14225;1408;An absolutely stunning film that uses the technology to the full.
I:14225;1409;Gibson knows exactly what he is doing and the viewer actually cares about what they are watching.
I:14225;1410;ripping out a beating heart is never going to be pretty .
I:14225;1411;As an archaeologist, I was also drawn into the debate about authenticity but such thoughts were quickly banished by the pulsating intensity and sheer brilliance of the film.
I:14225;1412;"Whatever you may think of Gibson as a man, he shows himself in ""Apocalypto"" to be an extraordinarily daring, extraordinarily gifted writer."
I:14225;1413;Apocalypto is as grand, expansive and panoramic as anything Cecil B. DeMille ever attempted, meticulously recreating the Mayan culture and civilization of the 16th century at the exact moment before the Spaniards arrived.
I:14225;1414;It deserves to be ranked among the classic cinematic epics.
I:14225;1415;Apocalypto presents a fresh variation on the staple action movie storyline of an Everyman who goes to extraordinary lengths to save his family from peril.
I:14225;1416;Director and co. writer Mel Gibson has made a career of heroic men who emerge from mundane circumstances to combat threats to loved ones, first as an actor, now as a director.
I:14225;1417;day Los Angeles, Gibson places his classic hero on a new canvas: Mayan civilization circa 1500.
I:14225;1418;hand combat prove as compelling as explosions and machine guns.
I:14225;1419;Young men hunt and make jokes, elders dole out advice and stories, and families enjoy one another's company.
I:14225;1420;But Jaguar Paw is determined to return to his forest and his family, who need his help to get out of the pit.
I:14225;1421;"What most impressed me about ""Apocalypto"" is the meticulously recreated Mayan aesthetic."
I:14225;1422;The piercings, tattoos, and scarifications can be off.
I:14225;1423;inlaid teeth and huge headdresses.
I:14225;1424;After a while, I caught on to this concept of beauty, and it became glamorous and alluring.
I:14225;1425;Elements from Mayan classic and post.
I:14225;1426;classic periods are combined for aesthetic reasons, and fictions such as the human target game and, I assume, the tapir trap are added to enhance the action and showcase Mayan weaponry.
I:14225;1427;Although Jaguar Paw is imbued with modern, middle.
I:14225;1428;"class values, and the film's thematic framing device, ""a great civilization in not conquered from without, until it has destroyed itself from within"", necessitates muddling of dates, this seems to me a good introduction to Mayan civilization ."
I:14225;1429;Other members of the creative team talk about recreating the Mayans through costumes and make.
I:14225;1430;Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, English, Spanish, and French.
I:14225;1431;It's top notch in every detail.
I:14225;1432;Mel Gibson does a Really Good Job at directing and Bringing this Story.
I:14225;1433;very strong and very Raw.
I:14225;1434;Rudy YoungBlood does a Great Job in this Movie.
I:14225;1435;the Intensity of the film kept you on the edge of your seat.
I:14225;1436;a must see and very intense film.
I:14225;1437;This movie is one of my favorites, an action adventure underdog overcomes all story.
I:14225;1438;The mayan cultural references intrigues me as well.
I:14225;1439;ray for anyone on the edge.
I:14225;1440;The story is brilliant, and the characters are portrayed with excellence.
I:14225;1441;Your heart is with the main characters all the way through.
I:14225;1442;"i've found a new favorite movie in ""Apocalypto."""
I:14225;1443;A well scripted, well acted and excellent interpretation of the culture and use of superstition.
I:14225;1444;This is just an interesting film to watch.
I:14225;1445;up, and acting are all so good you will often feel like you are watching actual history on film, rather than just another hollywood epic.
I:14225;1446;Mel Gibson has crafted a movie that should be around come Oscar time, especially in the technical categories.4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
I:14225;1447;Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is the most amazing, disturbing, incredibly moving movie I have ever seen.
I:14225;1448;I highly recommend this movie.
I:14225;1449;with the now trademark extended.
I:14225;1450;pan and scan, the whole world.
I:14225;1451;Poignant look at Mayan life in the jungle.
I:14225;1452;I'm sure the subtitles will turn a lot of people off, but for those that do get turned off (and in fact turn it off) are missing out on a fantastic, visually stunning and masterfully directed epic.
I:14225;1453;Great characters and wonderfully acted, extreme bloody action and certainly not for the squeamish.
I:14225;1454;Apocalypto is an intensely exciting film, full of surprises and dashing.
I:14225;1455;but they also had a religion which demanded human sacrifice.
I:14225;1456;It's all in here, and packaged in a genuinely heartrate.
I:14225;1457;Whether or not you think this movie succeeds, rather depends on what you think Mel Gibson set out to do.
I:14225;1458;If I am right, then he succeeded well, and warrants my 4 stars.
I:14225;1459;it's all cannily put together as a whole, and also in its memorable if gory individual scenes.
I:14225;1460;The director's eye for a breathtaking shot is undeniable .
I:14225;1461;I was reminded of the beauty of `The Mission' during the waterfall scene .
I:14225;1462;The success of the movie is largely due to its script (ironically, given the subtitles) which really draws us in to the characters lives and makes us care at least a bit.
I:14225;1463;And for action, the final chase scene makes our hero something like Schwarzenegger in Predator as he uses the jungle against the city folk to great effect.
I:14225;1464;The final few shots in particular are effective in tying up the movie in a slightly unexpected way.
I:14225;1465;A decent adventure film, by no means as bloody as Mayan history would lead one to expect.
I:14225;1466;most of the movie is a chase film.
I:14225;1467;"A great movie, one that you can tell was not ""hollywood"" manufactured with a great ending."
I:14225;1468;This could be a excellent movie if it was in english and not just english subtitles.
I:14225;1469;It brings a Meso American civilization to life into understanding that way of living and it's cultural beliefs!
I:14225;1470;It was a moving experience,
I:14225;1471;because this film is so amazing!
I:14225;1472;Just got around to viewing it last night and how I wish I'd seen it on the Big Screen!
I:14225;1473;THIS FILM is a work of art and a labor of love, shared by so many from Mel to cinematographers to costumers to weapons designers to actors to editors!
I:14225;1474;It IS mesmerizing from beginning to end.
I:14225;1475;there's a big difference between aggressive power (which consumes the souls of the aggressors as well) and defense of one's family and way of life.
I:14225;1476;but the realism that they must go on and face yet another possible wave of destroyers.
I:14225;1477;enrich your mind and your spirit (and choose which side you will take), and see this film!
I:14225;1478;braveheart, patriot, passion of the christ .
I:14225;1479;the stories of these movies were well integrated with the period they represented .
I:14225;1480;often linked with actual historical events .
I:14225;1481;apart from this the movie is highly entertaining.
I:14225;1482;What helps make Apocalypto so surprisingly good is the sense of dread that Gibson manages to create, as well as the surprising amount of action set pieces as well.
I:14225;1483;Regardless of what you may think of Mel Gibson, you've got to admit that he knows how to hold your interest, and that is one of the many things that Apocalypto manages to do, whether you want that or not.
I:14225;1484;All in all, Apocalypto definitely isn't for the faint of heart, but it's definitely one of the better films to come from a big name like Gibson in a while.
I:14225;1485;but a great one!keeps you glued to the tv.
I:14225;1486;and interesting to boot when you view the end.
I:14225;1487;_Apocalypto_ (2006) is an excellent film directed by Mel Gibson that details the decline of Mayan civilization through the life of a young Indian who strives to protect his family.
I:14225;1488;The movie treats the traditional Indian cultures with great respect and reverence, particularly that of the tribe of Jaguar Paw (the central character in this movie played by the Native American actor Rudy Youngblood).
I:14225;1489;"Such is the traditional way of life for the world's ""primitive"" nature."
I:14225;1490;That night, one of the village elders tells a foreboding fable of human beings never fulfilling their wants and desires.
I:14225;1491;mel Gibson has directed an excellent film in _Apocalypto_.
I:14225;1492;The movie includes humor but also much seriousness and bloodshed.
I:14225;1493;(Unfortunately this film is not to be recommended to the overly squeamish who may find certain scenes too upsetting, but to those few brave souls who can bear some of the more gruesome scenes the film has a positive message for all.)
I:14225;1494;The atmosphere is well done and the scenery and environment is accurate.
I:14225;1495;The movie is also historically interesting and Gibson has certainly done his homework on this ancient culture.
I:14225;1496;"If there is one good thing to be said about Mel Gibson
I:14225;1497;"The ""native"" characters are played entirely by actors and actresses of Native American descent."
I:14225;1498;"And they speak the correct native language for that time and place
I:14225;1499;"Set right before the arrival of the Spaniards, the movie also shows the complex world of Central American societies at that time, such as the religious beliefs, social organization, and accomplished skills in construction and architecture
I:14225;1500;personal violence, most of it quite realistic and bloody.
I:14225;1501;Underlying this visual spectacle are story themes rehashed from hundreds of other movies.
I:14225;1502;This latter chase scene is quite reminiscent of many Rambo movies.
I:14225;1503;"Of course he does this to save his pregnant wife and son
I:14225;1504;"Overall, this movie is quite good
I:14225;1505;The special effects are top notch, as are the action scenes.
I:14225;1506;line however, is something to be improved upon.
I:14225;1507;i hope there is a sequel for what I think is a brilliant movie, a movie that deserves far more recognition than what it has received, simply stunning!
I:14225;1508;This movie is absolutely wonderful well illustrated detail and vividMel Gibson has a lot of movies a varietywith an array of kinds
I:14225;1509;This is a gruesome movie about a man and his fight to survive and save his family.
I:14225;1510;It is extremely brutal, but is also powerful and stirring.
I:14225;1511;One the best movies I've seen.
I:14225;1512;It's definately high octane and loaded with suspense.
I:14225;1513;The visuals are great, wonderful directiion.
I:14225;1514;Whatever you might think of Gibson, one thing is clear: he's a wonderful filmmaker.
I:14225;1515;This is a great movie and was totally boycotted by racist Hollywood media moguls.
I:14225;1516;It should have won an oscar.
I:14225;1517;"Like ""The Passion"", Gibson immerses the viewer in an epic tale and an exotic culture, complete with original languages and subtitles."
I:14225;1518;The visual beauty of the production is undeniable, and the human drama of the story is played out with stark, often gut.
I:14225;1519;counterbalancing these strengths is, in my opinion, a shallowness to the story and the main characters.
I:14225;1520;The indomitable spirit of Jaguar Paw is the key feature, coupled closely with his love for his wife and son.
I:14225;1521;overall I would rate this movie as definitely worth watching, both for the excellence of the production and the tragic drama it portrays.
I:14225;1522;I have no idea how much of the story is true to the history of Mayan civilization, but Gibson certainly paints a believable picture.
I:14225;1523;It was a good movie and seemed well researched.
I:14225;1524;A quite original film by Mel Gibson and perhaps one of the only films portraying the lives of the Maya.
I:14225;1525;The cinematography is excellent and the anthropological representations fairly accurate.
I:14225;1526;The focus of the Mayan civilization's moral decline seems to be a computer recreation of the great city of Tikal which was very well done.
I:14225;1527;american rituals and world views.
I:14225;1528;The film carries the suspense pretty well all the way through.
I:14225;1529;Overall, the screenplay was decent, the cinematography excellent, as well as the direction and editing.
I:14225;1530;this was a great film and another accomplishment by Mel Gibson.
I:14225;1531;great movie adds to the fun
I:14225;1532;A good movie to see more then once, very nice lights and scenery off the world of mayan indians.
I:14225;1533;Over the years, I have enjoyed Mel Gibson's acting.
I:14225;1534;His direction in this movie was excellent.
I:14225;1535;Gibson's ability to make you feel a part of the film, like you were actually there during the beginning of the fall of the Mayan Empire was amazing.
I:14225;1536;The music, story line, dancing, even the beheadings (OMG) were very well done.
I:14225;1537;Better yet, take away Mel Gibson's name and how many people would go to see this movie?
I:14225;1538;I'm hoping, one day, he'll make a movie that normal people can enjoy.
I:14225;1539;brighter, sharper, crystal clear video.
I:14225;1540;if you want to see a great movie.
I:14225;1541;very grafic but story is good and about survival and the will to survive.
I:14225;1542;I like the story told, and the film itself is very color rich.
I:14225;1543;If you like the typical Mel Gibson movie, you will enjoy this one even though it is not in English.
I:14225;1544;While I wouldn't call this a great movie, it is highly original and definitely has some memorable moments, including the sacrificial temple scene.
I:14225;1545;Mel does a very good job of capturing the savagery of the times, and his actors are all quite believable in their roles.
I:14225;1546;Both are highly creative and original movies.
I:14225;1547;I realize that Mel Gibson is quite the flake, but how can anybody deny that this is an amazing film that should have been nominated for at least a few Oscars.
I:14225;1548;up, the art direction, the cinemaphotography, and the director all did quite an amzing job with this film.
I:14225;1549;The Acting is also verry impressive.
I:14225;1550;and anything amazing deserves such recognition.
I:14225;1551;Certainly better than many of the movies that got nominated at the Academy Awards.
I:14225;1552;made movie with a very interesting plot and plenty of twists and turns.
I:14225;1553;It really keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:14225;1554;It's another great film by Mel Gibson and ranks up there with The Passion and Braveheart.
I:14225;1555;I can't help but wonder if Mel Gibson realized he was recreating Rambo: First Blood.
I:14225;1556;no, really, I loved the movie, but it's Rambo.
I:14225;1557;Mel Gibson continues to be one of the finest directors in the business.
I:14225;1558;This was a great spectacle and non stop action.
I:14225;1559;Great movie, I highly recommend it to anyone.
I:14225;1560;the film has much going for it .
I:14225;1561;excellent acting, makeup, costumes, production design, visual effects .
I:14225;1562;which really makes you feel like you are there .
I:14225;1563;Most of it is very intense and suspenseful, but it is a movie you should see only if you are ok with some very graphic scenes.
I:14225;1564;i thought the acting, what little there was, was good.
I:14225;1565;The story was believable (enough), but the writers took some creative shortcuts which were clearly for convenience.
I:14225;1566;It was these scenes which made Apocalypto a gory thrill ride.
I:14225;1567;i watched this movie in the middle of the day with a friend.
I:14225;1568;It made for a fun movie.
I:14225;1569;watching experience and probably facilitated my enjoyment of Apocalypto.
I:14225;1570;That's what makes it art), I was free to judge Apocalypto on its own merits.
I:14225;1571;APOCALYPTO should be required viewing.
I:14225;1572;time customer, I was more than satisfied with the sale and service.
I:14225;1573;I was very happy to be wrong.
I:14225;1574;I really enjoyed the experience.
I:14225;1575;The actors were all believable and I found their anonymity to be a plus.
I:14225;1576;There were no leading roles for women in this film (also a Gibson trait), but the birth scene was wonderful.
I:14225;1577;He likes blood and there was plenty of it in this effort.
I:14225;1578;He went to great lengths to create new ways to butcher people.
I:14225;1579;titles but kept me on the edge of my seat.
I:14225;1580;"As already mentioned, Apocalypto's story is one that has been told countless times
I:14225;1581;The Mayan world that Mel Gibson depicts is a scary one indeed.
I:14225;1582;The costume and set design was phenomenal, the action was practically non.
I:14225;1583;All in all, this is a solid film that brings to life a rarely covered period of history.
I:14225;1584;Mel Gibson proved to me a few years ago that I can enjoy a movie that's not in my native language and not having that reservation this time, I was clearly able to focus on the film and this is a remarkable film.
I:14225;1585;against unbelievable odds, the main character, believably, takes us back to his family to keep his promise.
I:14225;1586;Truely an awesome movie, if you want to see a Mayan Rambo then check this movie out.
I:14225;1587;This truely is a masterpiece when it comes to engaging a predominantly english speaking audience into a non english speaking movie.
I:14225;1588;This is a work of art to be seen and appreciated depending on what you bring to the show.
I:14225;1589;You may be moved the art and choose to take off from that painting to study the Spanish Civil War.
I:14225;1590;toting, Vietnam and Desert Storm Christian veteran for Kerry, I rejoice to see Mr. Gibson going through a major change in his life, as reflected in his new masterpiece.
I:14225;1591;The last shot of the film shows the Jag Paw family disappearing into the jungle, while the camera stops after the last line about a 'new beginning'.
I:14225;1592;"The hero has survived the hunt
I:14225;1593;Has Mel Gibson 'heard' of a new Way of life?
I:14225;1594;It will take all the tools at our artists' disposal.
I:14225;1595;It will be another timeless tale for all people.
I:14225;1596;The characters, especially Jaguar Paw and his family, are so compelling that I was brought to tears more than once.
I:14225;1597;Really superb acting, and a nice mix of dramatic, tragedy and humor.
I:14225;1598;Overall, I think that this is one of the best movies to come out all year.
I:14225;1599;As his village is being attacked, he manages to hide his very pregnant wife and young son.
I:14225;1600;classic period of Maya civilization, around the time when they were being influenced by other groups (ie.
I:14225;1601;There is a small part at the end of the movie that will date the movie more precisely.
I:14225;1602;the attention to detail is superb from the costumes, the cinematography, the make up, etc.
I:14225;1603;You will actually feel that you are back in time.
I:14225;1604;I know that what we see on the screen is a composite of several time periods of Mayan civilization and I think that Gibson did blur a bit of the Maya culture with that of the Aztec but other than that and a few quibbles about astronomy, the film is brilliant.
I:14225;1605;It will keep you on the edge of your seat :).
I:14225;1606;the show is good as to the depiction of the Maya at that time.
I:14225;1607;When you do courages things it fills up the amount of confidence you have to do other things which may bring feels of fear into your life.
I:14225;1608;Susan Jeffers also wrote an excellent little book,Feel the Fear . . . and Do It Anyway (r)Now back to Apocalypto.
I:14225;1609;This movie is set in the jungle's of Mesoamerica and right from the beginning it's very much an adrenalin rush with the capture of a wild boar.
I:14225;1610;He says to these tribal people moving through their forest, something like this: I am Flint Stone!
I:14225;1611;There is elements of the film that is not historically accurate but this has nothing to do with how powerful a message it conveys regarding how to overcome fear with courage.
I:14225;1612;Through some tough determination Jaguar Paw outmanoeuvres the hunters who had captures him and manages to escape into the forest.
I:14225;1613;and here is where he's courage is brought to the fore.
I:14225;1614;His confidences increases as he gets deeper into the forest.
I:14225;1615;The most exhilarating scene in the movie could be when he jumps over a waterfall.
I:14225;1616;When you consider how some of the hunters following him hesitate and end up being killed because of bad jumps over the same waterfall you realise how superior Jaguar Paw's confidence has become.
I:14225;1617;With speed and agility he overcomes great obstacles in the chase.
I:14225;1618;Overall though you can start to see how living in the moment, the now, brings you closer to your true self.
I:14225;1619;It brings you closer to nature and your instincts can take over.
I:14225;1620;Now in a modern, westernised, technologically advances society we live in there is absolutely nothing that pushes us in the same way to develop our confidence, our courage and our instincts.
I:14225;1621;The mere fact that it was brought to film is amazing.
I:14225;1622;While the film concentrates on a period of time between the flourishment of the Mayans and the infiltration of the Spanish, we know that that period spanned decades, and the film gives us a glimpse of the not.
I:14225;1623;Their regular blood sacrifices of human beings to their gods displays a kind of inner moral bankruptcy .
I:14225;1624;By mere chance, coincidence or providence, our protagonist is able to escape immediate extinction.
I:14225;1625;These qualities, along with some very good luck allow him to gain an advantage over his relentless (and scary) adversaries.
I:14225;1626;This film is unlike any other that I've seen.
I:14225;1627;It's very, very powerful movie making.
I:14225;1628;directed film by Mel Gibson, and I can only hope that the Hollywood circuit allows him to go forward and explore new, unseen dimensions of the human experience.
I:14225;1629;now onto the movie which is the real purpose of this review.
I:14225;1630;visually and aurally, this movie is an impressive feat.
I:14225;1631;The image was clear, crisp, and vibrant, and the music was gripping and at times haunting.
I:14225;1632;It set the tone very well.
I:14225;1633;In fact, I at times had difficulty focusing on the screen due to the incredible detail of the images.
I:14225;1634;ray movies, but this movie was so full of color and detail that I had to look away every so often.
I:14225;1635;the story is gripping and leaves one wondering what's going to happen next.
I:14225;1636;that the movie uses the Mayan language and gives us English subtitles is a plus in my book.
I:14225;1637;Hearing them speak that language, coupled with the imagery and sound, I was transported to another world.
I:14225;1638;"correct aficionados need not apply
I:14225;1639;Like all cultures, they had their good qualities and their bad, and I feel the movie did an admirable job in balancing that.
I:14225;1640;all considered, this is an excellent movie that experiences few hiccups.
I:14225;1641;"needless to say, I highly recommend seeing this film
I:14225;1642;There are many other sources out there and I certainly recommend making oneself more informed.
I:14225;1643;Knowledge is power and all that.
I:14225;1644;Well, I disagree with many of the critics of this spectacular film.
I:14225;1645;the film begins with a bloody, but good.
I:14225;1646;Along the way, he observes the incredible brutality of the Mayan religion.
I:14225;1647;If you're stomach can't hold on, keep a bucket by the couch because the effort is well worthwhile.
I:14225;1648;This true freedom gets destroyed by the dominating city state, whose servants go to the jungle to collect jungle dwellers to sacrifice to the gods and for slavery.
I:14225;1649;A deep, ever relevant conflict between the two worlds and ways of life.
I:14225;1650;And this movie's deeply caring desire to tackle this most important topic of all would almost be enough to call it one of the best ever.
I:14225;1651;But it's also very well presented, thrilling and visually stunning, with an intense yet comfortable attention to detail.
I:14225;1652;Mel Gibson has done it again.
I:14225;1653;ray it looks amazing definitely worth the money.
I:14225;1654;One of my favorite movies of all time.
I:14225;1655;Although it does focus on the eclipse ritual, that occurs only twice per year, be prepared for an exciting journey into the pre.
I:14225;1656;Although, it would be interesting to see another version that focuses on the conquistadors or the Spanish exploration of the Philippines during the spice trade.
I:14225;1657;I bought this movie in blu.
I:14225;1658;"and I still battle with having to ""read"" the entire movie."
I:14225;1659;"this movie is one of my husband's favorite movies
I:14225;1660;style pyramid complex and village.
I:14225;1661;town, are quite well realised though (sigh) marginally on the small side.
I:14225;1662;There's a good tapir hunt at the start, with a sudden.
I:14225;1663;The village life was well done .
I:14225;1664;happy kids, cheerful healthy people, comfort, some communal things, fires, thatch, dancing .
I:14225;1665;the forest is his, and fearlessness is right.
I:14225;1666;It's surprising how easily a film can cause an emotional reaction: one of the overseers taking a group of captives, roped to a long stick, for their long march to town, was a sadistic type.
I:14225;1667;It's well done, with interesting human types.
I:14225;1668;There are some impressive headpieces for the priests and (I think) the king.
I:14225;1669;We have a pit with bodies, an open area, spears and arrows and stones, a corn field with genuine maize, a lot of running through jungle, and a waterfall.
I:14225;1670;a green screen job, surely .
I:14225;1671;a subplot is the hero's wife, and young son, who has a gash stitched with severed any heads, hidden in the well .
I:14225;1672;She also gives birth underwater.
I:14225;1673;I must say Apocalypto is a great film indeed and a class on its own.
I:14225;1674;wing message that a man should protect his family.
I:14225;1675;winger will enjoy this film.
I:14225;1676;Mel Gibson, as a filmmaker, is quite brilliant.
I:14225;1677;Apocalypto had me from the first frame, and I thought it was another fine film from a fine director.
I:14225;1678;Vengeance and escape are the centers of this film about a man who simply wants to go back to his family.
I:14225;1679;I believe Mel Gibson is an impassioned director, making film of unusual interest, and totally in command of his material.
I:14225;1680;This arrived really quick and it is just a great movie in general.
I:14225;1681;Apocalypto is a great movie on many levels.
I:14225;1682;As an experience, it immerses you in an intriguing alien culture to illustrate familiar, universal human values (I bet you never knew you had so much in common with Indians who lived in the jungles of Central America, did you?)
I:14225;1683;As an entertainment, it delivers colorful spectacle, nuanced characters, and the full spectrum of emotions from humor and tenderness to thrills and terror .
I:14225;1684;shot analysis of the third act to see how a master choreographs the action and select shots to create an exciting chase sequence.)
I:14225;1685;This one is well worth the price of admission.
I:14225;1686;Apocalypto is a great film that grans you by the throat right from the off and doesn't let go until the end.
I:14225;1687;I found the film absolutely flew by as I was gripped by the tension and some of the horrific violence.
I:14225;1688;And considering the fact that I own over 6,000 movies doesn't at all make me an expert but hopefully you will find my views about this film and my take on Mel Gibson as a Director to honest ones.
I:14225;1689;Still, I enjoy many of Mel Gibson's films and have enjoyed his newer works as a director, including this film.
I:14225;1690;"Everything in this film is brilliant
I:14225;1691;It has been so long since so much human emotion has been conveyed with such realism as in this work of art.
I:14225;1692;And after you do, get a life.
I:14225;1693;mel Gibson has out done himself here.
I:14225;1694;Add another gem to his filmography.
I:14225;1695;the color, the scenery, the visual images are stunning and simply overwhelming.
I:14225;1696;the historical accuracy and desire to be faithful to the culture and times is evident and i appreciate such expense and desire.
I:14225;1697;the plot is both emotional stimulating and successfully accomplished.
I:14225;1698;persuasively pulling me into the film and the world that it creates on screen.
I:14225;1699;the movie is loaded with adrenalin, it nevers slows down but builds up tension and energy the whole time.
I:14225;1700;Convincingly done you identify with the main character, his love for wife and family and his overwhelming desire to save them from death and destruction.
I:14225;1701;You cheer at all the right parts and boo the appearance of the bad guys and desire nothing more than their just rewards.
I:14225;1702;movie making and story telling at it's best.
I:14225;1703;a must see and probably a reviewable movie you ought to own, rich and complex enough to warrant a rewatching.
I:14225;1704;thanks to M. gibson for an excellent use of all the money he made with Passion of the Christ.
I:14225;1705;i hope he uses the justifiable profit from this money to offer us more such well done fare.
I:14225;1706;As a result, the film is very effective.
I:14225;1707;The cinematography is gorgeous, unsurprising as Gibson once again pairs with Dean Semler (Dead Calm, The Road Warrior, Razorback), one of those fantastic cinematographers they grow down in Australia.
I:14225;1708;up jobs are gorgeous, and the action sequences are choreographed in such a way that you'd never think they were choreographed.
I:14225;1709;"Gibson turns in another winner
I:14225;1710;i thought the film was exciting, unpredictable and extremely violent.
I:14225;1711;Otherwise, I really enjoyed watching the film.
I:14225;1712;from the moment the film starts to the moment it ends you feel you are transported into the ancient Mayan civilization, seeing full body tattoos, body art, multiple piercing and jewelry.
I:14225;1713;It is a very exciting motion picture to look at, so strange to watch.
I:14225;1714;It has the esthetic that began to appeal and it fills you with wonder.
I:14225;1715;a fortuitous switch provides Jaguar Paw with an unexpected opportunity to escape and get back to his family in peril.
I:14225;1716;Apocalypto transports the viewers to a strange and unreachable world, to a civilization in decline, to an infernal vision of a city and its inhabitants, to shocking images of human barbarism which has always existed throughout the ages.
I:14225;1717;I had a very personal reason for wanting to see the film .
I:14225;1718;I will say, on that level, the movie succeeds.
I:14225;1719;The cinematography is gorgeous, the performances are good, and you do get somewhat of a sense of what it might be like to live in the ancient Mayan culture.
I:14225;1720;The plot is very basic, and there is a fair amount of excitement along the way.
I:14225;1721;It's really too bad, because this really could have been a terrific movie .
I:14225;1722;I enjoyed the movie very much.
I:14225;1723;This movie definitely stands out among the other films released right now as something unique to see at least once.
I:14225;1724;And it is pretty good overall.
I:14225;1725;the cast is as strong as they could be and the scenes are a thing of beauty for the most part.
I:14225;1726;although the movie has its strong points that make it a success.
I:14225;1727;so really it's good to watch once to me, but not good enough to watch again.3.5/5
I:14225;1728;art is to enthrall, inspire, deviate from routine life, even if it's done responsibly, historically accurate.
I:14225;1729;such a sumptuous, magically colorful production.
I:14225;1730;he's an amazing director, all his movies are well produced, acted.
I:14225;1731;The thing I like best about this movie was its depiction of the Mayan city.
I:14225;1732;Gibson's people made a successful effort at demonstrating a civilization totally alien from our own.
I:14225;1733;I loved the strange women, almost aliens from outer space.
I:14225;1734;I also like the slave raid.
I:14225;1735;i liked the relationship between the slave captain and his son when he tells him after the successful slave capture.
I:14225;1736;Wonderful, really, and all so very human.
I:14225;1737;The final scene was great.
I:14225;1738;"Skull Rack and ""Hummingbird God""."
I:14225;1739;"It was good in ""Mohicans"" but once is enough."
I:14225;1740;another movie we love like this one is 'Quest for Fire'.
I:14225;1741;One of the best movies we have ever seen.
I:14225;1742;There is alot of spirituality in the movie.
I:14225;1743;If nothing else, watch this movie for its gorgeous cinematography, sets, and costumes.
I:14225;1744;The Mayan city/temple sacrifice scenes are superb.
I:14225;1745;Maybe there's a chronological mismatch between the Mayan empire and the Spaniards' arrival, but it's intriguing to think of such a cruel people about to get their comeuppance, and how the mighty keep falling.
I:14225;1746;In real life the Spaniards had such huge success against the Aztecs precisely because of the latter's rampant savagery and tyranny against other indigenous peoples.
I:14225;1747;but the spectacular filming and effects of this movie set it apart from the usual Hollywood ho.
I:14225;1748;The movie was gruesome but also exciting and alluring in its natural and historical beauty.
I:14225;1749;Mel Gibson's Powerful and energetically charged historical drama Apocalypto is amazing in it's depth of it's main charachters jaugure Paw(Rudy Youngblood)transformation into the decline of his civilization into a more brutally savage and advanced culture is what makes Mel Gibson a master at doing these type of films.
I:14225;1750;but even take the voilence out of the situation of this film and you still have a very fine film about a family man who is dedicated to his wife and child and the members of his myan tribe.
I:14225;1751;who suddenly sees his entire way of life eradicated and enslaved the members of his tribe killed and his wife and child enslved as animals.
I:14225;1752;a commentary while Mel isnt the best at giving them but it's interesting to know his take on this film and it also has a documentary of how this film was made.
I:14225;1753;all in all this is very good film and aside from it's graphic violence it deserves to be praised as a good job done for Mel Gibson.
I:14225;1754;His magic seems to be to inspire and urge on the best from every performer, costumer, production person.
I:14225;1755;More original than I've seen in decades, more human intensity that I could imagine from an all.
I:14225;1756;gibson is brave to use only subtitled dialogue, and it works.
I:14225;1757;gibson is brave to jump back stories and complex motives.
I:14225;1758;"other movies from awhile ago touched on this kind of concept/action, two are Rapa Nui and The Naked Prey
I:14225;1759;But this film is the best of its sort that I've ever seen.
I:14225;1760;I hope everyone can see it and it wins all the awards it really deserves.
I:14225;1761;I'm sure I'll see it see it again and again over coming years.
I:14225;1762;One definition is that elegance equals uniqueness andsimplicity.
I:14225;1763;Sure works for this fine motion picture.
I:14225;1764;This is a excilent depiction of Early Indian life in South America.
I:14225;1765;The story line is very informative and believable.
I:14225;1766;What an absolutely incredible film.
I:14225;1767;Beautifully shot, seamless storyline, reality at its finest.
I:14225;1768;This film offers yet another look at a civilization that otherwise would have been forgotten by most!
I:14225;1769;The historical look of the film could only be done by a master of cinema.
I:14225;1770;I never thought that I would ever be able to see a movie that brought Mayan history to life.
I:14225;1771;apocalyptico is an in your face depiction of the exteremely advance, intelligent and perverted bloodthirsty societies that both the Aztecs and the Mayans really were in their day.
I:14225;1772;This is a novel with the most fabulously and for the most part historically correct depiction of the Aztecs, and of course to the same extent the Maya and their bloothirsty rituals.
I:14225;1773;I like this movie very interesting, how big fish eats litter fish
I:14225;1774;This is not the best movie I have seen this year, but probably the best movie I have seen in the last decade!
I:14225;1775;This is a movie I'll be watching over and over again.
I:14225;1776;I enjoy movies that are historical, true stories, challenge my mind, entertain me, offer me stunning imagery, are provocative, and os (daring).
I:14225;1777;This movie offered me all of this with stunning cinematography.
I:14225;1778;This is an intense (very intense) non.
I:14225;1779;The story revolves around a young hunter, Jaguar Paw, and his pregnant wife and young son, who live in a small village within the Mayan empire.
I:14225;1780;"If you have read the books by Jared Diamond (Collapse
I:14225;1781;I highly recommend you read both books.
I:14225;1782;To complicate things further, the wife goes into labor while immersed in water up to her neck, with her young son on her shoulders.
I:14225;1783;She eventually gives birth, and the newborn baby suddenly emerges from the water.
I:14225;1784;The expression on the young boy's face upon seeing his baby brother is beyond words.
I:14225;1785;This is the most memorable scene in the movie and one that will stay with you for a long time.
I:14225;1786;It is rare to have Hollywood portray scenes with such strong emotions.
I:14225;1787;Watch the movie and you'll see what I mean.
I:14225;1788;This movie was great because it keeps you on your toes the entire time.
I:14225;1789;mel Gibson did a great job and kept you on the edge of your seat.
I:14225;1790;Later on the same evening, the hero's wife sees a full moon in the sky.
I:14225;1791;Solar eclipses occur at new moon when the moon is not visible in the evening sky.
I:14225;1792;An equally compelling scene could have been created with correct astronomical details.
I:14225;1793;Describe your astronomical details and I will critique them.
I:14225;1794;despite all of the above, I liked the movie.
I:14225;1795;It was quite an ingenious bit of history.
I:14225;1796;Although the violence and cruelty in the film were horrific, I liked how the movie ended.
I:14225;1797;the subject matter, subtitles, and lack of star power made it a bold choice for a major studio release.
I:14225;1798;I recomend this movie to everyone who enjoys a great movie.
I:14225;1799;Thanks Mel Gibson for this moving movie made from the heart.
I:14225;1800;Apocalypto is one of those films that deserves thought over it.
I:14225;1801;Oddly enough, it is also one of the few films with depth that can also evoke immediate responses.
I:14225;1802;As testament to that, you can see the many visceral reactions that came out at the time of the films release.
I:14225;1803;i can but urge you to see this film.
I:14225;1804;This is a very entertaining and somewhat historically accurate movie about the ancient (terminal Classic) Maya.
I:14225;1805;As a mesoamerican enthusiast and anthropologist, this is absolutely one of my favorite movies.
I:14225;1806;In addition, the portrayal of the Mayan culture is inaccurate.
I:14225;1807;"Apocalypto is an accomplishment of cinematography and a visual feast for the eyes, and yes there is unflinching, ""I dare you to look away"" violence."
I:14225;1808;Though the acting from some of these novices was a little less than stellar, Mel does a great job of encouraging the viewer to care about these characters so that when they are threatened by impending danger and doom the audience finds itself holding its collective breath and hoping for the safety, rescue and triumph of these people.
I:14225;1809;the close attention to detail further supports this movie .
I:14225;1810;i give this movie a solid A .
I:14225;1811;Great plot and good depiction of the demise of the Mayan culture.
I:14225;1812;This should have atleast been an Oscar contender for best picture of the year.
I:14225;1813;The cinematography is stunning, sumptuous!!
I:14225;1814;With all the action and scenery, you have to read fast then try to take in the fantastic cinematography.
I:14225;1815;Plus Gibson chose actors who actually had interesting FACES!
I:14225;1816;the story was mesmerizing and once it took off you're not moving from your chair until this roller.
I:14225;1817;It's a great old cliff.
I:14225;1818;jaguar Paw proved that brains and cleverness would win out over the sheer thugery of his pursuers.
I:14225;1819;But a very unexpected ending.
I:14225;1820;A very original and entertaining script.
I:14225;1821;From the story line, to the wonderful actors, to the beautiful costumes, and imagery .
I:14225;1822;the city is truly a cinematograph wonder.
I:14225;1823;But the Mayans still intend to make sport of him and his fellow villagers.
I:14225;1824;There are a couple of 'dig the heart out of the chest' scenes, plus one Tarantino.
I:14225;1825;the photography is stunning, and the actors, while unknowns, are remarkable.
I:14225;1826;This is a visually beautiful movie with plenty of plot and action, though the plot is an old one the presentation is new.
I:14225;1827;& I knew when I watched the pre.
I:14225;1828;"movie trailers when you're about to see a kid movie
I:14225;1829;"comedy trailers when you're about to see a romantic comedy
I:14225;1830;"this movie certainly puts to rest once and for all the MYTH of the ""noble savage"" (i. e. the peaceful, wise and morally superior native) that is so popular amongst the media, academia and new."
I:14225;1831;I enjoyed this unuaual movie.
I:14225;1832;it was well acted and had enough drama to be interesting.
I:14225;1833;title movies, I'll make an exception here in view of the subject matter.
I:14225;1834;This was a great movie.
I:14225;1835;Apocalypto is an easier movie to admire than it is to love.
I:14225;1836;Mel Gibson utilizes all the tricks of his trade to make an intelligent, thoughtful movie and yet what sticks with you is the over.
I:14225;1837;"set in the 16th century, ""Apocalypto"" focuses on the ancient Mayan civilization, one of the most fascinating yet ignored cultures in the Western hemisphere."
I:14225;1838;hour of the film focuses on the daily life of Jaguar Paw's tribe, including a realistic tapir hunt and some hilarious scenes from the tribe's daily life.
I:14225;1839;"One of the most refreshing aspects of ""Apocalypto"" is the movie's willingness to humanize the members of this largely."
I:14225;1840;god with human sacrifices . . . which is the destiny of Jaguar Paw and his friends.
I:14225;1841;Gibson and his team linger on the morbid scene that is this sacrifice .
I:14225;1842;a solar eclipse temporarily saves Jaguar Paw's life and provides him the opportunity to escape back to save his family.
I:14225;1843;Again, these scenes are beautiful and powerful in their way, but again the unrelenting violence becomes a bit much as the body count continues to rise in various gruesome ways.
I:14225;1844;"the climax of ""Apocalypto"" is complex and unsettling."
I:14225;1845;The title of the movie is appropriate, after all.
I:14225;1846;"gibson has made an admirable movie with ""Apocalypto"" that will satisfy both action fans and history buffs."
I:14225;1847;Apocalypto is a story about a Mayan man's, Jaguar Paw, epic journey.
I:14225;1848;His peaceful, content village is attacked by a superior tribe and his people are slaughtered and enslaved.
I:14225;1849;i work for a production company that made a film with Mr. Gibson in the past and decided to write him to share how I felt about his work.
I:14225;1850;I first saw it one month ago and have seen it four more times since.
I:14225;1851;I believe it is one of the best films ever made.
I:14225;1852;the story was magnificently crafted with characters and emotions I found I could easily relate to.
I:14225;1853;I laughed hard with the characters.
I:14225;1854;And I felt their fear, pain, hatred, love and desire.
I:14225;1855;the epic chase was powerful and cerebral.
I:14225;1856;It is the greatest chase ever .
I:14225;1857;the cinematography was bold and vibrant.
I:14225;1858;When combined with the powerful sound and fantastic casting, the story took hold of me from the opening scene right through to the credits.
I:14225;1859;Apocalypto not only entertains, it evokes strong emotion and inspires soulful contemplation.
I:14225;1860;Apocalypto is a true masterpiece.
I:14225;1861;You are a master storyteller.
I:14225;1862;This movie is awesome and great
I:14225;1863;This was a technically accomplished film.
I:14225;1864;Mel Gibson used a great cinematographer and he knows how to pace a story.
I:14225;1865;The film and the effects felt real.
I:14225;1866;maya civilization was well known and they traded with others.
I:14225;1867;this is about as historically accurate as someone 500 years in the future making a film about baseball and the 2006 wold series.
I:14225;1868;Then the director to sell the movie goes out and tells the potential audience that he had a baseball expert consult on the film therefore his film is a true representation of the game.
I:14225;1869;"It might be a good story, but history?If you want a graphically violent, visually sunning and exciting chase film set in an exotic setting then Apocalapto is a good choice
I:14225;1870;As this movie begins to unfold you are aware you are watching a very unique film, first it's the fact it's told in ancient Mayan, second it's that it's shot on location in the jungles of central america.
I:14225;1871;The story is simple, but engrossing and you really find yourself rooting for the protagonist as he races against the clock.
I:14225;1872;The acting is actually quite good and the direction and cinemaphotograpy first rate.
I:14225;1873;I highly recommend it, its a very good piece of filmmaking, but it is hella violent.
I:14225;1874;To be honest, I thought Apocalypto had all the makings of a new Heaven's Gate.
I:14225;1875;If you've ever seen the old Cornel Wilde flick, Naked Prey, you essentially have a good chunk of Apocalypto, as the hero, Jaguar Paw, races through the jungle, pursued by Mayans, while at home, his wife and child are in great, and growing, danger.
I:14225;1876;It's edge of your seat suspense that never lets up.
I:14225;1877;But on another level, Gibson has something to say about civilizations and how they kill themselves.
I:14225;1878;If a civilization can become demonic, certainly this one, as portrayed by Gibson, was.
I:14225;1879;Say what you will about Gibson's rants and controversial statements .
I:14225;1880;the man is uncanny as a director.
I:14225;1881;This movie will captivate you from the opening scenes to the nail.
I:14225;1882;"Although the ""R"" rating is much needed due to the graphic nature of this film, it is a nice directorial effort by Mel Gibson."
I:14225;1883;This actor turned actor/director has made a fine film here.
I:14225;1884;He has had such a successful acting career that this is obviously an outlet for his phenomenal creative talents to flourish.
I:14225;1885;And Take Your Time Making The Best Films!
I:14225;1886;the acting, scenery, and story all make for an edge.
I:14225;1887;seat thrill ride all the way.
I:14225;1888;While visually satisfying the appetite and creative in that sense, I kept waiting for a point to be made.
I:14225;1889;I gave it one star for some beautiful scenery.
I:14225;1890;The cinematography is beautiful and the hunter vs hunted plot engaging.
I:14225;1891;Calling on primal triggers and survivalistic instinct is at the core of the success of this film.
I:14225;1892;It is the power of tapping into collective memory and how we have formed our view of ancient heritage that is so astounding.
I:14225;1893;I was intensely curious about the language that was spoken and intend to do some more reading around that.
I:14225;1894;Do expect an action movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:14225;1895;apocolypto is thoroughly entertaining from start to finish, and not a word of English is spoken throughout.
I:14225;1896;apocolypto tells the story of the approximate 48 hour period of when one Maya tribe clashes with another, and focuses on the effects of the clash on tribe.
I:14225;1897;member Jaguar Paw and his family.
I:14225;1898;day period out of Maya civilization and makes an awesome movie out of it.
I:14225;1899;And that is what you get.
I:14225;1900;"If you dropped support of Gibson because of his recent public controversy, I can certainly respect that
I:14225;1901;Gibson is the most original film maker in the business.
I:14225;1902;today's great art medium.You are there.
I:14225;1903;Overall a good movie that keeps your attention pretty much for the duration.
I:14225;1904;The jungle scenes and chases are great and well filmed.
I:14225;1905;On that basis alone I would rate it as 4 stars.
I:14225;1906;their knowledge of mathematics, calendar, astronomy .
I:14225;1907;i'm very happy with it.
I:14225;1908;I like movies that interest me in a new topic, and so now I am reading about the history of the Mayan civilization.
I:14225;1909;All the detail makes it extremely believable and transports the viewer back to the time.
I:14225;1910;"I am a fan of ""The Naked Prey"", so the final scenes were really enjoyable."
I:14225;1911;Gibson has done a remarkable job with this film.
I:14225;1912;"i researched and found that ""The Departed"" won the best picture that year."
I:14225;1913;This is one of those rare films that is both a stunning artistic achievement and a fantastically entertaining story.
I:14225;1914;This film really lives in its world, which is both very realistic AND very mythological.
I:14225;1915;i can't speak too highly of the fantastic actors and of the sheer beauty of the settings and the tight structure of the story, and I thought the ending was both surprising and very well brought.
I:14225;1916;There are touching scenes of family life that are quickly shattered by extreme and brutal violence and some of these scenes are quite graphic in places.
I:14225;1917;The various actors play their roles superbly and Gibson's direction is as flawless as ever.
I:14225;1918;Say what you will about the man, he has artistic vision if nothing else.
I:14225;1919;The colours really immerse you in this film, rich ochre's and earth tones, vivid blues of the sacrificial paint and muted jade all combine to create a palate of beauty that add a great deal to the overall feel.
I:14225;1920;Despite the negative press around Gibson that inevitably coloured the hype around this film, this is a solidly directed and acted film and is well worth a look.
I:14225;1921;Everything about this film please me from the sets, the acting and the storyline.
I:14225;1922;it's a great film, not for the faint of heart though.
I:14225;1923;Scene three: well while historically inaccurate it's great to see an Aztec (yes Aztec) city re.
I:14225;1924;Would have been a great movie under the direction of someone else.
I:14225;1925;Apocolypto was quite good .
I:14225;1926;full of action, suspense, brilliant on.
I:14225;1927;the only reason it is good is because it hides behind action.
I:14225;1928;this is a technique that is excellent in horror films but if we are expecting a drama or even an intelligent suspense film we want a little more.
I:14225;1929;but enough of my quibbles, mel gibson deserves a great deal of credit for using the original language and for using the people of mexico and for the authentic costumes and all of that jazz.
I:14225;1930;Nevertheless, like most of gibson's films it is essentially adrenaline.
I:14225;1931;and you can't look away (this is the type of thing that endangers truly great movie.
I:14225;1932;I have always enjoyed history .
I:14225;1933;The Mayan culture still fascinates me as do the Aztec and North American tribes.
I:14225;1934;The location was beautiful and felt very real!
I:14225;1935;Bottom line is regardless your feelings for Gibson, this is a great one to see.
I:14225;1936;"It is rated ""R"" in US and the equivalence in most countries."
I:14225;1937;there are several shocking scenes in the movie, which were crafted with unique scriptwriting and surprisingly good acting.
I:14225;1938;Many will particularly feel sensational and emotional to see the human sacrifices, the near.
I:14225;1939;the movie also has excellent cinematography and directing.
I:14225;1940;"Similar to ""Passion of Christ"", Mel Gibson proves once again that a movie can be great without understanding the spoken language (in this case, the Maya language), but just by reading the subtitles, or by the sheer images and sound."
I:14225;1941;"for a short review of the film, I will say that it is action packed and nicely done, though I found the story slightly sparse
I:14225;1942;It just looks darn good!
I:14225;1943;What you have is more grain in some areas due to the use of certain film stocks, while in others you have crisp clarity.
I:14225;1944;as far as audio is concerned, I commend Mel Gibson for his use of authentic languages on his films.
I:14225;1945;The channels have good separation when needed and it works really well in the Mayan language.
I:14225;1946;over all I am happy with this release.
I:14225;1947;"The movie itself was good, but not ""great"" for me, while the technical aspects make the Blu."
I:14225;1948;i'm disgusted that Apocalypto is selling so well.
I:14225;1949;The entire thing gets you going.
I:14225;1950;The illusion is consistent and constant.
I:14225;1951;It is actually a dual line love story, one of a man for his wife and child, and one of a warrior's love for his son.
I:14225;1952;"stirring ""The Passion of the Christ""), Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" is a well."
I:14225;1953;The cast and crew do a fine job of bringing the world of the Mayan to life.
I:14225;1954;While the second act of the film gets long after a while, the final hour of the movie is rousing and exciting.
I:14225;1955;And the unexpected ending will leave everyone wide.
I:14225;1956;"Fans of Gibson's previous work will enjoy ""Apocalypto."
I:14225;1957;great direction (yes, mel g.).
I:14225;1958;rudy youngblood does a stellar job in his role.
I:14225;1959;Mel Gibson tells a good story in a great way.
I:14225;1960;Who knows what will happen tomorrow!
I:14225;1961;This is a great movie and to get it for that price and condition was great.
I:14225;1962;It came quick, was in good condition and I liked the movie!
I:14225;1963;It is incredible and enlightening.
I:14225;1964;It's nice that we can finally own this film and watch it whenever we want.
I:14225;1965;Best movie with an actual story that I have enjoyed in many years.
I:14225;1966;stop action, great acting, and amazing special effects.
I:14225;1967;It makes for a really interesting movie.
I:14225;1968;I was really impressed that the actors were able to convey so much while saying so little.
I:14225;1969;It is such a great movie.
I:14225;1970;I sat down to watch this movie with absolutely NO expectations.
I:14225;1971;I found myself intruiged by his portrayal of their culture from the perspective of tatoos, dress, etc.
I:14225;1972;The director takes his sweet time shooting endless.
I:14225;1973;beautiful shots of vegetation and, like the movies of those two auteurs, Apocalypto's plot is small, but everything surrounding it is on a massive, grandiose scale.
I:14225;1974;"With Gibson's recent blatant Christian motives, Apocalypto's Christ allegories are thankfully kept to a minimum
I:14225;1975;hasn't looked this beautiful since Lawrence Of Arabia, while Youngblood, for an unknown, carries the film firmly on his shoulders.
I:14225;1976;This movie is insanely good and definitely makes it into my top five of all time.
I:14225;1977;I was expecting a rugged tribal movie with a lot of violence and gore, but the story line is very emotional and you really care for Jaguar Paw's family and fate.
I:14225;1978;And while it is a little gory, it is realistic and not overdone.
I:14225;1979;perfect movie, video and sound.
I:14225;1980;"the film is preceded by recalling the opening quote to the film(""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within""),written about the Roman Empire."
I:14225;1981;the ending is inspired and more hopeful than it seems.
I:14225;1982;Jaguar Paw has to overcome his fear through an adrenaline.
I:14225;1983;racing dash through the jungle.
I:14225;1984;gibson's real message comesfrom the mouth of the shamanic storyteller about man ravaging the earth.
I:14225;1985;the secret of the Apocalypto's visual appeal is a relentless motion of the story and the hero,camera tracking him and his pursuers in every scene.
I:14225;1986;Mr. Gibson's direction is clear and crisp and he knows how to involve an audience, taking them on a breathtaking roller coaster ride chock full of spills and thrills.
I:14225;1987;i was hugely entertained and could not remember enjoying a film as much in recent years.
I:14225;1988;Mr. Gibson is a mesmerizing story teller.
I:14225;1989;Mel Gibson manages to recreate the world of the Ancient Mayans to such a degree of believability that it makes me anxious to see what he comes up with next.
I:14225;1990;The movie is very simple in its story (it's basically a capture, escape and pursuit chase film) but is so intense that it just keeps you glued to the screen, watching and waiting to see how the next display of human brutality will top the next.
I:14225;1991;The violence in this film gives an immediacy to the film and makes the threat more real.
I:14225;1992;Make no bones about it, this movie is a rough ride but somehow manages to be uplifting at the same time.
I:14225;1993;It's okay to watch but I think a nice two hour documentary (at least two!)
I:14225;1994;There is also a commentary by Gibson and the co. screenwriter of the film which is informative and rife with Gibson's kooky humor.
I:14225;1995;this is a great film which is very simple but still a stunning visual treat and human drama that I really enjoyed.
I:14225;1996;I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who can't stand the sight of blood in a film but I'd recommend it to anyone else who thinks they can handle it.
I:14225;1997;You probably won't recognize any actors, but quite frankly it doesn't matter, Mel Gibson directs another outstanding film.
I:14225;1998;Apolcalypto was a film that pretty much delivered what I expected it to deliver.
I:14225;1999;is this a historically accurate film?
I:14225;2000;Apocalypto is a great film in terms of cinematography.
I:14225;2001;There was, generally, a lot to think about during the film's 138 minutes.
I:14225;2002;"Overall, I thought it was a very good film, but not a great film on the order of ""A Man for All Seasons"", or ""Lawrence of Arabia""."
I:14225;2003;A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within.
I:14225;2004;And it starts with our children.
I:14225;2005;"At best we see ""them"" being made fun of, as if ""they"" aren't really people with experiences, families, and feelings and desires, but are only present to make us laugh at how stupid or crazy or hypocritical they are."
I:14225;2006;"jesus said ""You have heard that it was said to those of old, `You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.'"
I:14225;2007;only love makes us strong.
I:14225;2008;Keep the good, get rid of the evil.
I:14225;2009;give it a spiritual bath, so to speak.
I:14225;2010;The point is that Jesus inverted the whole concept behind human sacrifice: human sacrifice is offensive to God, and so Jesus took all the evil and suffering and death of the world upon Himself on the Cross to take it away, and allow us the grace to be good, to be strong against suffering, and to be resurrected to eternal life, as He was.
I:14225;2011;God made us all and loves us all, so only when we are strong, loving God and neighbor, can we receive God's gift to us.
I:14225;2012;that is a worthwhile person with something to contribute to society.
I:14225;2013;do those who become great people have more of a right to life than those who don't?
I:14225;2014;but I can pray, and spread the word, and encourage right actions and discourage wrong actions.
I:14225;2015;the point is, none of us are strong enough to manage love on our own, but Christ gives us that strength, even when we may not realize it (because He doesn't need us to believe in Him to act in our lives).
I:14225;2016;I really liked this movie, i was looking for it long time ago.
I:14225;2017;which is to say it is for you.
I:14225;2018;that this is one of the best movies that has come out in a very long time.
I:14225;2019;i really enjoyed it and anyone who sees it is bound to react strongly to it.
I:14225;2020;"Mel Gibson directs this powerful film that made many critics claim that it was ""the best movie of the year"" as well as ""brutally violent"" and ""shockingly disturbing."""
I:14225;2021;He and his tribe are very comfortable, living in their part of their forest.
I:14225;2022;what also is a good original idea for the film is showing the entire film in English subtitles but also with the actually Mayan subtitles being shown as well.
I:14225;2023;Another thing I liked about this movie is the beautiful scenery.
I:14225;2024;This is one movie you should see if you want to see a great film about love, passion, and survival.
I:14225;2025;This movie is definatley recommended.
I:14225;2026;it is beautifully shot and has such a great message.
I:14225;2027;The movie stays with you and, while it is about the Mayans, can also be interpreted as a warning to us in the modern world.
I:14225;2028;based on the merits of this film (and not Mel Gibson's personal life and/or drunken ravings) I feel that Apocalypto was robbed of at least one Oscar win as well as the Best Director nomination.
I:14225;2029;while Apocalypto is best suited for thoughtful movie goers, thoughtless thrill seekers should also be satisfied.
I:14225;2030;adventure set against the turbulent end times of the once great Mayan civilization.
I:14225;2031;"Through a twist of fate and spurred by the power of his love for his woman and his family he will make a desparate break to return home and to ultimately save his way of life."""
I:14225;2032;Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is perhaps one of the best movies I have ever seen!
I:14225;2033;At the same time, Apocalypto is a fast paced action movie that is brilliantly filmed and well.
I:14225;2034;"In the end, Gibson reaffirms his view that good will triumph over evil, with an ending that further confirms the theological roots of the movie's plot: the prophecies are spoken and fulfilled, the symbolic Eden of the Central American jungle is given renewed life as Adam and Eve are allowed to return to their Garden and ""start a new beginning"", while those infested with the satanic rot of a pagan civilization face destruction by an incoming Christian invasion."
I:14225;2035;Mel Gibson is a lunatic, but his directing and storytelling are superb.
I:14225;2036;The action is intense and non.
I:14225;2037;titles were necessary to keep the movie more authentic and realistic.
I:14225;2038;Stunning cinematography and beautiful locations and sets make this an outstanding cinema experience.
I:14225;2039;This amplified interpretation is borne out in the movie's vision .
I:14225;2040;building and costuming, and seamless, skillful camerawork and directing, the movie is a bizarre, macabre masterpiece.
I:14225;2041;There is little in the Special Features that explores the whole topic of Mayan civilization, except for the skill with which the production company reproduced it for making the film.
I:14225;2042;Who is Rudy Youngblood, besides being an amazing young actor?
I:14225;2043;There is a partial view from one English.
I:14225;2044;speaking actor in a key role about these kinds of questions, and the commentary, although very short, was very instructive and enjoyable.
I:14225;2045;disk set offered, we can hope there would be more material about the actors themselves.4.
I:14225;2046;"But, in keeping with the ""symphony"" concept I envision, a certain amount of ""poetic license"" is deserved by the movie's makers."
I:14225;2047;"The first parts of ""Fire and Blood: A History of Mexico"", by T. R. Fehrenbach would make excellent source material."
I:14225;2048;This gruesome custom is well documented in the Aztec civilization, which was intact when the Spanish arrived, but the film maintains both that the Mayans participated in similar bloodletting and that their culture survived intact into the modern era.
I:14225;2049;The chase, which is a terrific, almost wordless, adventure, goes on literally for days.
I:14225;2050;I just saw Apocalypto based on the recommendations of some friends at work and I found it highly entertaining.
I:14225;2051;Without giving out any spoilers, I felt the movie was well acted(especially Youngblood), well imagined visually and action packed.
I:14225;2052;The scenes in the village were excellent and I wanted to see more of them, likewise I wished the ending was more balanced out.
I:14225;2053;Apocalypto is one of the most amazing films ever made.
I:14225;2054;"It is violent, but not more so than Michael Mann's brilliant ""Last of the Mohicans"" (1992) and other Academy Award winning films."
I:14225;2055;In the final analysis, Mel Gibson may be laughing all the way to the bank, and rightly so.
I:14225;2056;"A Jewish friend of mine from New York City probably expressed it best:""I have always said that the liberals in Hollywood are the biggest racists in America."
I:14225;2057;"hats off to those native ""stars"" who turned in brilliant performances and made the film come alive."
I:14225;2058;So does the cinematographer, Academy Award winner Dean Semler.
I:14225;2059;Last but by no means least, this may be Mel Gibson's finest film.
I:14225;2060;"Granted it does not have the humor and epic proportions of ""Braveheart,"" but today's directors and those who aspire to the role may be in awe of what Gibson accomplished with this film."
I:14225;2061;One of the best looking and sounding Blu.
I:14225;2062;It's also a fantastic movie in it's own right.
I:14225;2063;This is a fantastic movie and has one of the best pictures that blu.
I:14225;2064;Love this movie,it is one of my favorites.
I:14225;2065;Very timely and great condition .
I:14225;2066;The originality and detail of set and wardrobe were fantastic.
I:14225;2067;The value of this film and its appeal is in the story, told visually with strange language and English subtitles.
I:14225;2068;It held some lasting images and lessons for me.
I:14225;2069;What a fantastic film if you can stomach through the violence.
I:14225;2070;The movie seems to tie together a chain of human events that will forever link on into all our lives.
I:14225;2071;Brilliantly directed, visually gorgeous, great acting, incredibly bizarre, breathless pacing.
I:14225;2072;Gibson's third film as director is easily his best and continues his theme of a heroic man who suffers for the sake of others, as seen in both BraveHeart and the Passion.
I:14225;2073;The father is motivated to overcome the greatest odds because of his love for his wife and child.
I:14225;2074;"I also mean ""heart"" in the sense of courage (a word based on the French word for heart)for the young man must face terrifying enemies and predicaments."
I:14225;2075;truly one of the best adventure films I have ever seen.
I:14225;2076;I showed it to friends who dislike Mel Gibson and they were instantly converted to the view that, no matter what you think of Gibson, after you experience this film, you will admit that he is a masterful filmmaker.
I:14225;2077;It will take you to another world in another time.
I:14225;2078;I only see 3 or 4 films a year that are as good as this.
I:14225;2079;Action packed and attention grabbing endeavor from an actor I find better on the directorial side of the camera.
I:14225;2080;Captivates with the activities and lifestyles of the Central American societies prior to the white man's arrival.
I:14225;2081;No matter what you may think of Mel Gibson as a person, his film Apocalypto (2006) is truly an example of superb storytelling, and the realization of a vision to bring to the screen a period piece involving the Mayan culture, that is epic in scale, and brutally realistic, as a marauding band of warriors raids the jungle and gathers slaves.
I:14225;2082;set somewhere in the jungles of Central America, the movie's cast speak an archaic language, wear authentic attire, and use ancient tools and weapons.
I:14225;2083;Tattoos, scarification, piercing, and the insertion of objects into parts of the body, particularly the nose and ear lobe, were part of the Mayan culture, and a large crew of makeup artists, was employed to give the huge cast an authentic look.
I:14225;2084;Unfolding in stages, the story immediately draws you in, and is largely a learning experience, for those unfamiliar with the Mayan culture.
I:14225;2085;The acting performances are amazingly natural, and there are few instances where you don't feel that what you are seeing isn't real.
I:14225;2086;The pacing is brisk, and the story is told in a manner that feels like events are happening almost in real time.
I:14225;2087;Eventually they reach a great city, where the women are sold as slaves, and the men are forced to climb to the top of a massive ziggurat, where a sacrificial ceremony is taking place.
I:14225;2088;in regard to sets, costumes, language, and culture, Apocalypto goes to great lengths, attempting to be realistic.
I:14225;2089;Combined with some remarkably convincing acting performances, and often brutal action scenes, and you may find yourself drawn quite deeply into this unfamiliar, and often violent world, which is very close to nature.
I:14225;2090;Apocalypto is a compelling and often shocking saga, that makes a sincere attempt to explore and pay respect to an ancient culture, while telling a poignant, tragic, and thrilling story.
I:14225;2091;There are some very rough moments, but if you persevere, you may discover a new appreciation for the simple things in life, that you might have taken for granted.
I:14225;2092;A Mayan forest village lives happily and harmoniously, except the mean teasing of Blunted's inability to sire.
I:14225;2093;The chief's proud son Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and toddler son, but in an unsafe place.
I:14225;2094;The men are destined for bloody sacrifice to the gods in the raider kingdom's pestilence.
I:14225;2095;Jaguar Paw survives, killing the captain's son, and may now incarnate an apocalyptic prophecy or still perish without saving his family, while another danger looms unseen.
I:14225;2096;This movie features scene after scene that hits the perfect note, which is always a high.
I:14225;2097;Apocalypto is the perfect action movie, punctuating its frenzy of activity with beautiful and surprising images.
I:14225;2098;I'm overwhelmed by the experience.
I:14225;2099;Such a great action packed movie will have you on the edge of your seat the whole movie.
I:14225;2100;The story is surprisingly slight .
I:14225;2101;day buddies on a fishing trip.
I:14225;2102;Indeed, while he may eschew the Scope format he even shoots the Mayan city in the classic Anthony Mann style, discarding the big establishing shot but choosing instead to gradually reveal it as the characters are drawn into it, saving the big money shots for the end of the sequence.
I:14225;2103;As a result, it's a much more convincing and layered depiction of its world and its many social levels than you'd expect for something other directors might have thrown away as a simple background walk.
I:14225;2104;climax, it's this section that keeps the film from being more than just pretty good.
I:14225;2105;He's also blessed with a couple of striking villains in the Wes Studi.
I:14225;2106;while it's certainly the best.
I:14225;2107;with digital's persistent problems with catching high.
I:14225;2108;mainly makeup, wardrobe and camera test footage .
I:14225;2109;Still I had to close my eyes during certian parts.
I:14225;2110;nevertheless, Mel puts another great movie out with a great chase scenes, action, and a story of love and a fallen society only seeking power, pleasure, and gods.
I:14225;2111;It gives you much during the movie and something to think about after the movie.
I:14225;2112;It is honestly the most intense and original action film I have seen in a long time.
I:14225;2113;I loved the movie *in spite of* Tom Hanks starring in it!
I:14225;2114;It was a fine story.
I:14225;2115;Yes, Tom Hanks is a fine actor.
I:14225;2116;but there are a lot of other fine actors out there, too.
I:14225;2117;"The screenplay of ""Apocalyto"" is very original as well."
I:14225;2118;and he basically made Jesus and Mary into perfect little Roman Catholics.)
I:14225;2119;That said, though, I admire Gibson's creativity.
I:14225;2120;He is a genuine artist.
I:14225;2121;great movie: I only gave it 4 stars though because it's not quite inthe same league as the creme of cinematic fare.
I:14225;2122;directed and truly is a good movie.
I:14225;2123;core in this one, much more than his other movies.
I:14225;2124;It's understandable, because it's the story of survival that happens back in savage time.
I:14225;2125;It's a crude, barbaric action that comes in a fine piece of cinema.
I:14225;2126;Mel Gibson continues to explore bravery and cruelty of humans.
I:14225;2127;"You can describe the story of ""Apocalypto"" in this way, but the fact is his latest work as director is a very engrossing adventure tale in the tradition of ""The Last of the Mohicans."""
I:14225;2128;"The difference is this adventure tale is set against the background of the last days of Mayan civilization
I:14225;2129;"winning ""Braveheart,"" ""Apocalypto"" comes with lots of violence."
I:14225;2130;the story itself is rather conventional, but the way it is presented is unique.
I:14225;2131;All the dialogues are spoken in the Mayan language, and most of the cast are non.
I:14225;2132;professionals without previous experience as actor.
I:14225;2133;But I am sure this is an exciting, well.
I:14225;2134;told adventure story that will keep you absorbed in the world unknown.
I:14225;2135;up that really makes this movie) all working together to produce a couple of hours to dazzle the anthropologist.
I:14225;2136;What a pleasure it is to see so much creativity at work on the details.
I:14225;2137;as for the story, it's just pure plot, Hollywood.
I:14225;2138;It's just paste, paste, and paste the right elements to get to the finish and then the Europeans are thrown in at the last moment simply to pretend this story has some greater significance than just an adrenalin thriller.
I:14225;2139;It was fun to watch most of the time and the behind the scenes feature shows how much thought the detailers put into their work.
I:14225;2140;"It also uses actual dialects and makes a genuine attempt at telling an unbiased story that doesn't resort to the Hollywood cliches which ""Apocalypto"" is, unfortunately, chock full of."
I:14225;2141;The box office rules Maya.
I:14225;2142;This is realistic and historically accurate.
I:14225;2143;great twists, great turns and not bad drama without the plot being over done.
I:14225;2144;a few nice extras on the blu.
I:14225;2145;Set against the backdrop of a lush and lively jungle landscape, APOCALYPTO is a film about the death of an empire, the fall of a civilization, the salvation of a family, and one man's struggle against fear.
I:14225;2146;Through a strange turn of events, Jaguar Paw's life is spared and he is able to escape.
I:14225;2147;aPOCALYPTO is one of the best films I have seen this year.
I:14225;2148;The people, animals, and vegetation seem almost three.
I:14225;2149;The scenery in the film is more vivid than any nature documentary that I have ever seen.
I:14225;2150;The actors' performances are quite remarkable, especially considering the film's location and the challenge of speaking in an almost dead language.
I:14225;2151;The central characters are rich and deep.
I:14225;2152;Whatever one may think about his past public indiscretions, Mel Gibson is a gifted and talented filmmaker that should not be ignored.
I:14225;2153;the story is not only engaging, but it is a powerful parable, too.
I:14225;2154;aPOCALYPTO is a grand film.
I:14225;2155;Containing magnificent acting, brilliant direction, and amazing cinematography, as well as a plot that serves as a powerful parable for our time, it is one of the best movies of 2006.
I:14225;2156;Very good action movie takes place is a amazing place and time.
I:14225;2157;Simplestory garnish by good production, good cinematography, good direction andstory.
I:14225;2158;telling and breathless action and chasing scenes.
I:14225;2159;hollywoodmovie, and add its genuine sincerity .
I:14225;2160;One of Mel Gibsons best films, and one your sure to remember a classic for sure excellent acting and story leaves one thinking how close it came to the truth.
I:14225;2161;For my purposes, I shall allow all of the other reviewers to give you a synopsis of the action that unfolds in the story.
I:14225;2162;Look at our desecration of the environment and also of human life.
I:14225;2163;Perhaps we also share and delight in their primal lusts.
I:14225;2164;It is cinematography at its very best .
I:14225;2165;The painted and tattoed bodies of the Maya, as they stare up in rapture for human blood to heal their land, are harshly beautiful.
I:14225;2166;A roar of excitement resounds across the city walls .
I:14225;2167;It is here, among the pyramids, decay, and spilled blood, that the viewer gets a glimpse into how great this film could have been.
I:14225;2168;It is perhaps one of the most visually ravishing films thus far in the 21st century, and it is because of this, that I wish Gibson would have transformed his entire film with similar cinematography.
I:14225;2169;esque cinematic experience, one equivalent and analagous to the Satyricon.
I:14225;2170;It looked real, it sounded real and I felt immersed in Mayan history.
I:14225;2171;there's one in every crowd.)
I:14225;2172;I like escape/survival situations especially when they are realistic and Apocalypto certainly delivered.
I:14225;2173;This is a good action movie.
I:14225;2174;all I can say is thanks Mel for saving us for all the flaying, eye.
I:14225;2175;gouging, roasting, disembowelment, piercing, emasculation and impallement that the mayas were so fond of, and just giving us a couple of beating hearts and cut heads!Besides, I think in Iraq and Afganistan worst things are happening .
I:14225;2176;the laugh of the bloodied priest tells all!
I:14225;2177;Makes it beleivable and surreal!
I:14225;2178;This film is PURE GENIUS and haunting in every sense of the word.
I:14225;2179;everyone should see and own this movie.
I:14225;2180;This movie had promise at the start.
I:14225;2181;Beautiful setting, incredible costumes, exotic characters.
I:14225;2182;But as it opens, it kind of wanders here and there, and never really finds a believable or understandable plot.
I:14225;2183;The opening scenes focus on a certain young man, and you believe he's going to wind up being the main character.
I:14225;2184;Pretty much everyone gets sliced, diced, gored, eaten, stabbed, shot, impaled, beheaded.
I:14225;2185;yeah, stuff like that, all through the movie.
I:14225;2186;"Gave it three stars for the beautiful settings, amazing costumes, great acting (despite a ""yeah, right"" story), and really feeling as if you were genuinely dropped into an ancient Mayan culture."
I:14225;2187;i like this movie because is sometime of the history of America before good movie thanks mel gibson's
I:14225;2188;"The film takes viewers from uproariously hilarious opening scenes to the darkest, saddest and most terrifying scenes and back around to a ""new beginning"" with a cleverly ironic twist at the end, all in the course of a couple of hours, and without benefit of other than subtitles to carry the story and dialogue."
I:14225;2189;Every single one of them even the children were fantastic.
I:14225;2190;Notice the live lizards on string, the mean little baby Jaguar, the jewelery, the tattoos, the birthing, the Jaguar chase, the fight scenes etc.
I:14225;2191;kudos on a job well done, Kudos to the actors and thanks!!
I:14225;2192;An action adventure movie, basically, shot in the lush rainforests of central America.
I:14225;2193;Stunning set, costume, and makeup design.
I:14225;2194;You root for the main character, his family, and the others in his simple village, especially when they are attacked by the more powerful Mayans who live in the city.
I:14225;2195;"The plot is very simple
I:14225;2196;So mostly it's a chase movie.
I:14225;2197;In the midst of the chase we're treated to some incredible cinematography and genuine thrills.
I:14225;2198;but despite the phony panther, Apocalypto is a fine film, and you'll leave the home theater feeling as if you've experienced something monumental and vaguely important.
I:14225;2199;the subtitles worked, its curious how you get used to that but is was fine.
I:14225;2200;storyline kept me dialled in, scenery excellent and a movie one would remember for a long time.
I:14225;2201;It is probably the most horrifically suspenseful chase film ever made.
I:14225;2202;In both films, the hero is saved for a special hunt in which he is the prey.
I:14225;2203;but that's exactly what happens, and it makes for two very exciting films.
I:14225;2204;It is brutally real, disturbingly graphic and relentlessly intense .
I:14225;2205;But it is a very good story with an exceptional chase scene in the second half.
I:14225;2206;Once they've decapitated their victims, they roll their heads down the ziggurat steps as the worshippers cheer and a new batch of blue people are led to the top.
I:14225;2207;it is quite interesting to see a primitive and ancient civilization depicted in this way.
I:14225;2208;And yet, they were created in God's image.
I:14225;2209;He remembers his pregnant wife and young son, and how they are depending on him.
I:14225;2210;He knows he must live to help them.
I:14225;2211;That is the real story.
I:14225;2212;Because of the subtitles, dialog is kept to a minimum in this Mel Gibson .
I:14225;2213;Production values are high throughout, with art direction taking center stage.
I:14225;2214;My favorite scenes occur on a raging river.
I:14225;2215;There is also a very good scene featuring a beautiful jaguar.
I:14225;2216;Nothing is romanticized in this film, nothing is idealized.
I:14225;2217;For a movie mostly without dialog and (I suspect) inexperienced actors, it keeps you on the edge throughout.
I:14225;2218;I was pleasantly surprised to see how well it was shot and directed.
I:14225;2219;You are definitely in the middle of a lot of action.
I:14225;2220;It's a visually stunning adventure epic that even has a message at its core (although Gibson doesn't beat us over the head with it).
I:14225;2221;"the second half of the film reminded me quite a bit of both Cornell Wilde's ""The Naked Prey"" and ""The Most Dangerous Game"" with its cat and mouse chase through the rain forest as Janguar Paw is pursued after he escapes."
I:14225;2222;"the film provides an interesting parallel for our modern world
I:14225;2223;the sharp direction, performances, cinematography and music allows the viewer to overlook some of the minor flaws of the film such as the simple story.
I:14225;2224;He also clearly has an innate sense for the power of cinema.
I:14225;2225;the image and he lets the image carry the story knowing, in a sense, that it makes up for the weaknesses of the story itself.
I:14225;2226;Surprisingly, that conclusion works very well indeed).
I:14225;2227;"While the film isn't 100% historical accurate, Gibson uses the trappings well and incorporates as much as he can into the film to give it a feeling of ""reality""."
I:14225;2228;This is a well made, visually stunning film that deserved a far better outcome at the box office.
I:14225;2229;sure, this film is a variation on the noble savage theme again but Gibson does such a marvelous job with the material that I'm willing to overlook the cliches of the story itself.
I:14225;2230;A very well made movie!
I:14225;2231;Mel Gibson did a great job making this film.
I:14225;2232;Well worth your time and money!
I:14225;2233;Whatever kind of movie this might be, I said, it will be an honest effort by a gifted director, and I hadn't heard anyone say outright that it was a bad film.
I:14225;2234;other reviewers have already expressed two of my key points, so here's the bottom line: this is a gripping, brutally honest movie about the human condition.
I:14225;2235;And cruelty for its own sake remains the favorite human hobby even today.
I:14225;2236;the action in this movie is top.
I:14225;2237;all that is true, and it's worth watching for that alone.
I:14225;2238;Mel's vision is a dark one, and it's scary because it's accurate.
I:14225;2239;"In this life, a ""new beginning"" is the best any of us can hope for."
I:14225;2240;The movie has good picture and excellent special effects as well as action but all these good traits are constantly overshadow by an exaggerated display of gore.
I:14225;2241;I could have enjoyed this movie a lot more if the sound effects were shut out.
I:14225;2242;An interesting and original topic which was filmed quite brilliantly but oh the sound track.
I:14225;2243;Just a point of clarity here .
I:14225;2244;OK has some effects now and again but dialogue and good camera work is enough .
I:14225;2245;It's so engrossing you'll wonder why it ended so quickly.
I:14225;2246;There is no doubt that this film is absolutly gorgeous and detailed.
I:14225;2247;so much so that I fear for the faint of heart.
I:14225;2248;I was actually excited about this movie from the previews.
I:14225;2249;I thought it was going to show the chain of events that led to the downfall of the Mayan civilization.
I:14225;2250;Oh yeah, on another note, lots of men without pants on.
I:14225;2251;in all honestly, the most entertaining part of the film was the credits when I saw one of the people's real name is Birdyellowhead.
I:14225;2252;The theme is not original, however it's locale is, and the cinematography is superb.
I:14225;2253;And I really like a nice ending.
I:14225;2254;Great movie, the speaking of the mayan dialect doesnt detract from this movie at all.
I:14225;2255;But man can he make a movie.
I:14225;2256;"* The film's ""title quote"" is to the effect that a great civilization cannot be conquered from without unless it has destroyed itself from within."
I:14225;2257;** One gets this sense from the Mayan priest's speech.
I:14225;2258;After days of abuse and having being shot twice, he still jumps of a huge waterfall and manages to kill his opponents one by one.
I:14225;2259;the length this man goes to to save his pregnant wife and child is an inspiration to man's capacity to love.
I:14225;2260;"It also has elements of ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Last of the Mohicans."""
I:14225;2261;"With the exception of ""The Naked Prey,"" ""Apocalypto"" isn't quite as good as any of these films, but it's still a very good jungle adventure."
I:14225;2262;"Just as ""Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan"" brought to life the infamous Mongol conqueror and his people, so ""Apocalypto"" effectively brings to life the Mayans."
I:14225;2263;On a more individualist level, it's about recognizing one's true identity, denying fear and the bold spirit of survival.
I:14225;2264;the movie is great in the sense that it is something new.
I:14225;2265;The characters are fun and intriguing to watch.
I:14225;2266;One of the most realistic movies I have seen.
I:14225;2267;Great characters existed in everyone's mind.
I:14225;2268;consuming, and so many other people have done it already.
I:14225;2269;Mel Gibson proved his super directing skill and his co. writer/co.
I:14225;2270;producer did fantastic job too.
I:14225;2271;On the other hand, I was totally transformed to become a Maya culture lover.
I:14225;2272;This movie is sad, epic, heroic, shocking, terrifying, uplifting, funny.
I:14225;2273;The villians in this movie will etch themselves into your mind.
I:14225;2274;Besides the amazing setting and culture, the film pulls you in and you feel like you're a part of it.
I:14225;2275;"I'm a huge physics buff and this film has a lot of synchronicity and quantum mechanics in its understructure
I:14225;2276;Most viewers are not even aware of it but this is what makes the storyline so great.
I:14225;2277;Not the best from Mel Gibson but still a worthy effort.
I:14225;2278;The cinematography is grade A and should've won an oscar.
I:14225;2279;The sound and picture of the blu ray is pristine and this film is great eye candy.
I:14225;2280;If you like action and heart, this movie delivers on both aspects!!!
I:14225;2281;Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is incredible!
I:14225;2282;"The cinematography is impressive the entire &#127909
I:14225;2283;I loved catching a glimpse of a life of survival through the lens of Aztec.
I:14225;2284;"Jaguar Paw (lead character) was a most dynamic character but it was his wife 9 months pregnant, giving birth under water, which took the cake
I:14225;2285;Prior to this event Jaguar Paw's wife fended off a wild animal, striking it 3 times, before it finally died.
I:14225;2286;apocalypto illustrates the true nature of a warrior opposed to a soldier.
I:14225;2287;This is the true warrior nature in all of humanity.
I:14225;2288;It's much better than the passion of Christ.
I:14225;2289;the sheer novelty of a movie about the Mayan civilization, in Mayan, with subtitles, is a draw for some people.
I:14225;2290;And the trailer is beautiful.
I:14225;2291;The movie itself has many beautiful moments, but it never really rises above being a chase movie / supernatural thriller.
I:14225;2292;But it DOES have all those things, so it's actually pretty enjoyable to watch.
I:14225;2293;It also makes the entire situation more heightened when you see what's truly at stake and the real ferocious nature of the Mayans.
I:14225;2294;I say he made a pretty cool movie that is worth a one.
I:14225;2295;Aside from that I love this film, It takes you on this incredible journey, you just dissapear in the frightening world of aztec warriors and their disturbing life of survival, supremacy and machismo.
