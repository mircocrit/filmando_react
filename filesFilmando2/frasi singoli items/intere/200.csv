1;what ensues is one of the best action movies that was ever made.
2;A strong script surrounded by a great cast and even a couple of cool cameos (look for Billy Bob Thorton and Charlton Heston).
3;Far and away his greatest performance as he steals this movie right out from under the feet of the other performers.
4;The script took a lot of liberties with actual events in the name of Hollywood.
5;A very interesting movie which portrays every character well.
6;Excellent, if you like westerns and love stories.
7;Wyatt was loyal to family and friends.
8;He also had a friend, Doc who was loyal to him in return.
9;I found Doc to be funny, educated, daring and a man seeming to have no fear.
10;My reference to this being a love story also is because of the relationship developing between Josephine and Wyatt and how in the end he found her and made her his own for the rest of their lives.
11;Hard to beat if you are a true western fan.
12;But this movie is by far the best western I have viewed in the past five decades.
13;Hats off to Val Kilmer, Doc was great.
14;For a nice Saturday afternoon of video watching include this one.
15;Russel is good, but boy do I love that Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday!
16;It was also great to see my man Sam Elliot albeit in a small supporting role.
17;This movie is definately worth owning.
18;Mr. Kilmer CAN act and act very well.
19;He just needs the right script/character.
20;The lines were great, the talent was exquisite.
21;It combines, humor, great acting and outrageous gunfighting scenes.
22;A must to any type of movie collector.
23;I am a very big fan of the old west and a very big fan of Wyatt Earp.
24;I have read every book by Wyatt earp and this movie goes right along with the worlds of the person who was really there.
25;I have every movie about the O. k. Corral gunfight and this is the best one.
26;If you like westerns then you'll love this movie.
27;I consider this the best rendition of the O. k. Corral gunfight.
28;It's highly visually accurate, western buffs will spot a lot of attention to detail.
29;The movie manages to capture the extraordinary circumstances of Wyatt Earp while not mythologizing him.
30;I enjoy watching westerns and Tombstone was the best one I have ever viewed.
31;I realy enjoyed this movie.
32;Kurt Russel has always been one of my favorites, however I think Val Kilmar stole the movie.
33;Found it on Amazon, ordered it and I am very satisfied with this product.
34;I watch this movie all the time.
35;It is packed with action based on the true story of Wyatt Earp, yet it does have many added fictional details, nothing is deleted from the real story.
36;This is a movie you will watch over and over again, and each time it makes you wish you were born one hundred and twenty years ago so you could have rode with Doc, Virgil, and Wyatt and the other great lawmen of the west.
37;I watch this movie at least once or twice a month.
38;The visual images are great.
39;The story, while punctuated with artistic liberties, is well told.
40;All of the actors did a fabulous job.
41;It's easy to see why.
42;The man absolutely steals the show, but in a realistic way.
43;This is absolutely one of my favorite shows and the best western ever!
44;Kurt Russell may get top billing, and in fairness his performance is solid.
45;In fact, most of the cast offer above average performances, with few if any exceptions.
46;the film itself offers a re.
47;telling of the classic gunfight at the OK Corral, and the events preceding and following it.
48;Naturally, the film's portrayal is very sympathetic to the Earp partisans.
49;the gunfight sequences are well done, the film is paced well, and while the plot offers no big surprises, it uses the classic Western movie template with skill, even working in a romance sub.
50;kilmer's portrayal of Holliday is worth the price of admission alone, but the fact is that a talented cast and a good picture stand behind him as well.
51;Destined to be one of the great modern Western movies.
52;The images are well done, and the characters are quite captivating.
53;It is interesting how he compares himself to the 4 horsemen in Revelation.
54;The story is well constructed and convincing.
55;Kilmer stole the whole show but Tombstone had a great cast and great action.
56;It is an unforgettable western.
57;Quite simply the best western I've ever seen!!
58;Kurt Russell is outstanding as Wyatt Earp, but Val Kilmer steals the show as Doc Holliday.
59;This is a great movie if you would like to know the real story of Wyatt Earp.
60;And the movie is seventy.
61;He declines and gives a superb performance.
62;The last thirty minutes are great.
63;Kilmer does a tremendous job as the dying Doc Holiday.
64;The best part of the film is the friendship with Earp and Holiday.
65;Thank God we have now have a good display of how friendships are between two men.
66;Once again, the director is terrific for capturing this on film.
67;It will be worth it.
68;This is a great story about Wyatt Earp (Russell) and his 2 brothers who settle in Tombstone to enjoy peace and quiet and on the search for gold.
69;Very good, a movie that can be watched over and over.
70;This is the best movie I have seen, the action is great.
71;The actors in the movie did a great job,is such a great movie that you must see.
72;This is the first review I have done for a movie.
73;This was possibly the greatest western movie I have ever seen.
74;tV in LA saying One of this years top 10 movies !
75;To me it was the best movie that year by far.
76;Best performance I have seen Kurt Russell do.
77;As good as he was, Val Kilmer acted cirles around him.
78;This may not be the most accurate movie on Wyatt Earp and friends, but it is the most interesting and entertaining!!
79;Val Kilmer, Kurt Russell, Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton are just incredible!
80;and again we laughed a lot and replayed favorite scenes.
81;you will watch it many times!
82;this is an engrossing movie with more in it than just the OK Corral (that is just a highlight!)
83;The movie is action packed and moves quickly.
84;The characters are well developed and so you feel pain when they feel pain and you get excited at the end when Wyatt seeks the reckoning!
85;The supporting cast is superb.
86;in short, excellent, spectacular, well filmed, well acted, well scripted movie!
87;This was one of the best western movies I have ever seen.
88;This movie had above all outstanding actors.
89;sam Elliott, and Powers Boothe were very good in theor roles.
90;the showdown between Johnny Ringo and Doc Holliday is exceptional.
91;This is without question an outstanding movie.
92;See it, you will not be dissapointed.
93;Like it has already been said,a cult classic.
94;Though I am no fan of Kurt Russell or Val Kilmer, their performances, along with very strong supporting performances by Sam Elliot, Dana Delaney and others, make this film a real pleasure.
95;It is much more satisfying than other modern Westerns, particularly those of Clint Eastwood, whose brooding and gloomy vision may be historically accurate but is awfully depressing.
96;Along with Silverado it is a modern classic,and a great deal of fun with with strong acting and an excellent script.
97;As far as performances go, everyone fit their part.
98;Val Kilmer's interpretation of Doc Holliday was the best I've seen and the other actors fared well, if not just as well in their roles.
99;I think this is the part of the film that kind of plays around with the facts, but it is also one of the more entertaining segments.
100;If you are doing a school report on Wyatt Earp, I would still recommend this movie, just read a few books that tell what really happened.
101;Tombstone movie is beyond words, a truly must see movie.
102;as a former resident and city councilwoman of Tombstone, I can tell you this movie created the greatest excitement in a long time.
103;while not historicaal factual in all things, it is the most entertaining of all the Earpiana movies.
104;a must see for western fans
105;I'm not usually a big fan of westerns but this film is incredible!
106;Val Kilmer shines on this one but the cast is great.
107;It has action, thrills, love and all the other elements of a great movie.
108;This is one of the few westerns that I can actually sit through and watch with enjoyment.
109;Tombstone has a killer cast, Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Bill Paxton, Sam Elliott, Dana Delaney, Billy Zane, Charlton Heston, Jason Priestly, Michael Biehn, Thomas Haden Church and Billy Bob Thornton.
110;Its a great story, its very well done and its easily one of the best movies I have seen.
111;Wow, 246 Amazon reviewers, and they all think Val Kilmer is good in this movie.
112;Watch that movie and you'll see this for the souped.
113;up high school production it is.
114;The saving grace to this movie comes from Doc Holiday, played masterfully by Val Kilmer.
115;Moreoever, he persistently delivers great one liners and witty threats to the enemies that he gives almost an outside the box look at what is going on right in front of him, as it happens.
116;This gives some of the movie's themes .
117;He's obviously going for laughs here.
118;So after being all choked up about it, he stands up, suddenly smiles, and glibly says Thanks for always being there, Doc.
119;A blockbuster of a western which has Kurt Russell portraying legendary gunslinger Wyatt Earp.
120;a sprawling,well filmed,good to look at cowboy picture and although enjoyable I felt the storyline lacked originality because we have seen a number of versions,over the years,of the basic story.
121;As somewhat of a film buff, I know the films I like, and the films I don't.
122;Kurt Russell plays a brilliant Wyatt, but Val steals the show with his portrayal of Doc Holliday, a man dying of TB, but with dignity.
123;Even though he was dying he still stayed loyal to his friend to the end.
124;once you get over the initial shock of nearly every man with a moustache you start to enjoy the actual film.
125;This isn't really a western, this is a movie about friendship, courage, and about starting over.
126;Johnny Ringo is their faster gunslinger and he knows it.
127;the twirling cup sequence is brilliant and legendary.
128;He must face Johnny Ringo, his eventual end as a gunfighter.
129;but he wants to start a new life with sexy, GORGEOUS Dana Delaney, herself a person with a past .
130;For a Hollywood style western this one does a pretty good job getting most of the facts right.
131;Yes it portrays the Earps as being heroic and the Clantons and all their goons as being rotten.
132;That's probably true, but by god this movie keeps your attention.
133;It's a great action movie and for the old west buff it's full of great looking costumes and firearms.
134;Kilmer is great, but so are all the other leads.
135;All the actors did a great job, but, I think Doc/Kilmer is the one who really put the fire in this movie.
136;He was so cool I loved it.
137;Nobody could beat him in anything he did, he was the best at everything and even his sickness didn't dampen his spirit.
138;Both actors brought the characters to life, both their good and bad sides.
139;His protrayal of Holliday is well done and mesmorizing.
140;Although the story is engrossing, and action driven, it also is a little light on historical fact.
141;But also certain scenes are very well grounded in history.
142;The gunfight at the OK Corral in this movie is well scripted to what is considered the true version.
143;Also Wyatt's reign of terror after his brothers are shot, and he starts to take his revenge is close to the actual events, although still to heavy on him as the good guy .
144;as Westerns go though, Tombstone is fun and a watchable romp.
145;how great can that get.
146;with great shootouts and some fantastic direction.
147;this one makes a bullseye.
148;Kilmer as the drunken Holiday is great and he perfectly imbodies him.
149;and Russell and his gang trapping Powers Boothe(Frailty, U. turn) and gunning him down was also great as well.
150;shoot um up good time.
151;Tombstone has a remarkably impressive ensemble cast
152;Kilmer gives an powerhouse performance as the tuberculoic gunfighter who helps Russell's Wyatt Earp clean up the frontier town of Tombstone.
153;Russell makes a decent centerpiece for the film, but Kilmer steals the show.
154;With his haunted eyes and sickly mannerisms, he is amazingly watchable.
155;Its a reminder of how good Kilmer can be when he wants to be.
156;Some historical inaccuracies, but Val Kilmer is the best Doc Holliday on film yet.
157;Tombstone is an interesting film in that it came out at the same time as the superior (I feel) Wyatt Earp.
158;Russell is solid as the stone.
159;showing the life of the famous lawman), Tombstone centers only around the time he and his brothers moved to that Arizona town.
160;Between 1 and 10, I give Tombstone a solid 6.
161;I had heard from many that saw this movie that it was a really great historical view of the Earps in Tombstone.
162;After viewing it myself I can only say one thing.
163;from the begining this movie is Hollywood at its best.
164;Kurt Russell and Sam Elliot do a cedible job portraying the Earp brothers.
165;Why the writers injected a syrupy extra marital love interest into this script for Wyatt is beyond me.
166;I found the acting to be hammy when I could find it believable at all.
167;It has real actors: Henry Fonda, Victor Mature, Ward Bond, Walter Brennan and is truly a great western.
168;As for Powers Booth's performance as Curly Bill Brocius, all I can say is, over the top.
169;He comes across as somehow both likable and menacing.
170;This movie is my favorite of all time.
171;Val Kilmer will steal the movie in the viewer's eye when he flips the coin across his knuckle to his last line, This is funny.
172;I have watched this movie at least 20 times and I will be watching it again soon.
173;Do yourself a favor and watch it too!
174;Tombstome is a great movie.
175;If you enjoy watching Kurt Russell,You will really enjoy this as He is one of the main stars.
176;It explains more and you get a greater depth to the story.
177;This is such a great western and the directors cut is something that I didn't know if I would need or not.
178;It is worth the extra that I paid for it and will stay with me for a long time.
179;I can really understand the words better.
180;this is a must have in every home if you like a good action packed movie that has serious moments, good laughs and great lines about how to think about life and living in it.
181;A second disc loaded with extras, including about 30 minutes worth of behind the scenes interviews and the like, also adds to the overall value.
182;There are a couple of good scenes added, both of which explain further the demise of the relationship between Wyatt and his wife as well as Doc and Kate the Prostitute.
183;Great movie at a great price.
184;A fabulous addition to our collection!
185;Terrific western done in modern technology.
186;Val Kilmer adds new spice to Doc Holliday, and does a fantastic job in this film.
187;This is a good movie/story.
188;There is lots of western action and courage in the face of overwhelming odds.
189;Val Kilmer`s performance in this movie, in my opinion,is one of his best that I`ve ever seen.
190;Bill Paxton,Sam Elliott, Powers Booth, too many others to mention give a good performance in their rolls to complement the main characters.
191;This may not be the best western ever made,but it`s one of my favorites and I give it two thumbs up!Definitely a cult classic.
192;This is one of my stepdad's favorites.
193;A must for any movie collector.
194;The transfer is beautiful (intense color), DTS sound is awesome, and all the missing bits we've seen in cable documentaries restored, as well as some expanded conversations here and there that really improve the character relations.
195;Very nice extras, including Wyatt's diagram of the OK Corral gunfight.
196;This movie ranks in my top ten of favorites.
197;This is a movie I have watched a few times and will continue to watch from time to time.
198;it was clearly the best performance to date of his carreer.
199;Kilmer steals the show from Kurt Russell,as Wyatt Earp.
200;a definite must see western that I would rate in the top five for all.
201;This was a good movie about a town that made history.
202;The silver mines, the cowboys and the Earps all contributed to making the town immortal.
203;It's a great little city if you've never been.
204;I thought the cast was darn near perfect, I just love Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer!I'm glad I bought this, will watch it over and over again!
205;Kurt Russel and Val Kilmer were amazing!
206;This movie has to be one of the best westerns that was ever produced.
207;Val Kilmer was superb as Doc Holliday and Kurt Russell played the part of Wyatt Earp very well, much better in my opinion than did Kevin Costner did in the other notable movie produced at about the same time.
208;This movie is full of terrific lines and characters.
209;It is actually a very accurate portrayal of the events that unfolded.
210;This movie still holds as the best western in recent years.
211;The costumes and sets looked great!
212;The cinematography combined with modern editing techniques and musical score combined to create a modern Western/Fantasy of great scope.
213;The dialog was created with each character in mind to produce a movie consisting of simple and witty one liners.
214;Doc himself (Kilmer) reaping most of those rewards!
215;The supporting cast was well defined, each their own person.
216;Unlike so many Westerns I've suffered, Tombstone's characters were very human and rightly entertaining.
217;Like I said, a modern Western.
218;Big look, big sound, big Western.
219;Not a totally accurate depiction of the OK Corral, but very well done with outstanding performances all around.
220;Both are classic westerns with excellent cast performances and good action.
221;But he's always your brother and that's the central theme of Tombstone.
222;The fact is that this is a wonderful film with a wonderful story line and wonderful acting.
223;historically accurate portrait of Holliday but the sacrifices he makes for the Earp brothers are touching and admirable.
224;In my mind, the gambler/dentist is the perfect embodiment of loyalty and honor.
225;These are very politically incorrect virtues so we must be thankful that some element of pop culture decided to enshrine them somewhere.
226;it's superb and fantastic cinema.
227;I enjoyed the movie very much.
228;Definitely one of my favorite movies when it comes to sentimental value I think.
229;Suffice it to say it moves along well and the characters are pretty well cast.
230;The O. k. corral shootout is very good.
231;I love this movie so I had to have this special collection!
232;This is a movie I love watching over and over again, it doesn't get old!
233;This is one of the most entertaining westerns ever made and as such, ranks right up there with Shane, Open Range, Ride the Man Down and Eastwood's The Unforgiven.
234;Kurt Russell gives his best performance as Wyatt Earp, coming to Tombstone with his brothers to settle down and put his lawman days behind him.
235;Tombstone is a wild town still and a group known as The Cowboys and a young gunslinger named Johnny Ringo begin to make this impossible.
236;this is a multilayered story more faithful to the truth than most versions.
237;What makes this film superior to other westerns is the depth of the story and the realistic performances of the cast.
238;The finest of the aforementioned is Val Kilmer's extraordinary turn as Doc Holliday.
239;this film more realistically portrays the relationship of Holliday and Wyatt than any other film.
240;Kilmer's Holliday is dangerous and intelligent, and above all, loyal to perhaps his only real friend in life, Wyatt Earp.
241;His performance is something that will always be remembered by anyone who watches this film.
242;wyatt is a real man in this film with raw courage but no self delusions.
243;What follows is one of the most tense and accurately portrayed gunfights in film history.
244;the rich tapestry of events that formed the legend of the dangerous Doc Holliday and Marshal Wyatt Earp are given the best and most accurate screen treatment ever filmed.
245;This is a must see western.
246;You will never forget it and you will never see a better and more colorful true to life performance than Val Kilmer's turn as Doc Holliday.
247;the point I wish to make is get the one with the special features.
248;there is a wealth of information on the history of that period of time that is awesome.
249;When you compare the two it doesn't take long to see the similarities between these classic films and realize what sets them apart from the rest of the pack.1) Both films boast superior casts and many unforgetable performances.2) The momentum starts to build from the very begining and never faulters on its journey to the closing credits.3) The dialogue is amazing.
250;probably the most important similarity of all is they both exude an aura of nobility about the characters involved, perfectly capturing what you might like to call the noble savage.
251;If you want to know what constitutes a classic western study these two films.
252;wonderful performances abound
253;'Tombstone' receives my highest rating: 5 Stars!
254;If you think you liked the released version of Tombstone, you'll absolutely love The Director's cut.
255;Anyone who has seen this wonderful classic Western would be happy to have a copy of it, especially in Blu.
256;I enjoy seeing this movie at least once a year and now I can see it whenever I want.
257;it would make a super gift to anyone who wants to own a classic movie!
258;The movie came right away, and it is great to have this movie with the director's comments.
259;Tombstone is a true classic, the very best.
260;This has always been a favorite movie if mine.
261;Sam Elliot, Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer are great in this movie together.
262;In my opinion the best Tombstone movie, ever!
263;Kurt Russell is great and Val Kilmer should of won an Oscar for his performance of Doc Holiday
264;Tombstone is by far one of my favorite movies.
265;I bought this copy for my FIL (who also loves this movie) after I was telling him he should see it.
266;To me, the director's version fills in some of the tiny unanswered questions I had in the story line.
267;If you love this movie half as much as I do, I highly recommend watching this version.
268;This is a great version of Tombstone and Kurt Russell does a great job in it.
269;The picture and sound got the work it deserved, and it shows.
270;It was a good price.
271;It came fast and I really appreciate it to be just what it was supposed to be.
272;for those of us who love Westerns, we have to take what we can get nowadays.
273;So this is a refreshing re.
274;packaging of an already great movie.
275;The sound is first rate and the photography excellent.
276;Historical facts are brought out and detailed, behind the scenes looks, and a folded map are even included in this very well packaged set.
277;kurt Russell looks very much like the real Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer's star turn as Doc Holliday is great fun to watch.
278;Sam Elliot as Virgil Earp and Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp, deliver servicable performances.
279;Powers Boothe as Curly Bill Brosius is great as an Earp nemesis.
280;Of all the portrayals over the years that Hollywood has done of the man who was Wyatt Earp, Kurt Russell has really captured the essence of The Man .
281;The performance was in my opinion, one of the finest that Kurt Russell has ever done.
282;Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday was outstanding.
283;Sam Elliot and Bill Paxton were also outstanding in their roles and overall this film, though not 100% historically accurate, did a fine job.
284;It is one of my top five favorite films.
285;This movie, everyone should know, is a great western.
286;This cut has additional scenes which makes it better.
287;And the second disc has entertaining special features.
288;Ah, the rare five star.
289;Infinitely better than the film Wyatt Earp, Tombstone is one I've seen twice and enjoyed more the second time.
290;the story is has both depth and action.
291;it seems reasonably historically accurate from what I've read.
292;As good as Hopkins was playing Lecter
293;It's one of the best jobs of ANYONE's acting career.
294;Kurt Russel keeps this moving from first to last.
295;Dana Delany is outstanding in her role as Josephine: I usually cannot tolerate the women who heartlessly cheat with married men but from the very first time they lay eyes on each other YOU feel as if it was meant to be.
296;He's great in every role he plays.
297;Fantastic cast, outstanding acting
298;From the very beginning you are involved in all the moves so get your snacks BEFORE you start the movie: It will keep you entranced as soon as it begins and hold you until it ends.
299;He loves this movie and I find myself watching it with him every time he puts it on.
300;Very exciting and action packed!
301;Anyway, this is a great movie (my favorite)and is filled with likable charactors, #1 ofcourse is the almost un.
302;One of the best movies of all time in my opinion.
303;From the sets, to the dialogue, to the casting and the story, it is flawless.
304;val Kilmer turns in a masterful performance as Doc Holiday.
305;He is funny, forceful and tragic.
306;kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp is terrific.
307;this version, though older and in black and white, is excellentGunfight at the O. k. Corralbut Tombstone is an updated version, utilizing all the modern cinematic and production equipment, producing a version that takes a back seat to none.
308;the sweeping vistas, haunting score, and scintillating one.
309;liners delivered by Val Kilmer add up to a modern classic that is a must have for any serious movie collection.
310;This version of the Earps and Holiday versus the Cowboys is an exciting and colorful tale with an outstanding cast ( meant a 5 star rating).
311;The dress and town scenes appear highly authentic and add to the reality feel of the film.
312;The cast is extraordinary with Val Kilmer standing out in the cast that features Sam Elliott (Virgil) who has excellent scenes as the forceful older brother, Bill Paxton (Morgan), Powers Booth (Curley Bill), Michael Biehn (Ringo), Stephen Lang (Ike Clanton), Thomas Haden Church (Billy Clanton), Charlton Heston (rancher Henry Hooker) in a modest role and Billy Bob Thornton as a relatively obscure but well played ignorant Faro dealer.
313;Kurt Russell does very well playing the lead.
314;Aside from the overbearing opening with the Cowboys in a gratuitous violent scene, the film is true to the real story.
315;The walk of the Earps with Holiday is a classic movie poster that captures the authentic costume and steely eyed look of the four some and a copy is well worth hanging on the wall.
316;Also notable in the film, is a brief appearance of Dana Delaney having a very sensual photograph taken that is suddenly interrupted.
317;A real life photo of the same type of picture exists of Josephine Marcus although there is significant controversy whether it really is her or not but is certainly is a sexy picture for the time.
318;Some other issues, Dana Delaney is a very attractive Josephine Marcus and is captivating but her Josephine has less of a past than her real counterpart.
319;Ringo's death is also a mystery today but some speculate that Earp and Holiday has something to do with it.
320;I give the edge to this movie over Costner's due to this faster moving script, great cast and Kilmer versus Biehn action
321;Excellentr movie, it is just as good the second time I watched as the first time I watched it.
322;Kurt Russell is at this best in this well thought out version of what most people know as the great shoot.
323;Acting is excellent, great shooting of the shootouts!
324;And, great charactor building makes you feel like you are part of the Earp family!
325;One of my all time favorite movies.
326;Tombstone is a wild ride through the violent western frontier.
327;star cast it has!Val Kilmer, who is an underrated actor, steals the show with his excellent portrayal of the TB.
328;It also stars Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn and a brief role from Charlton Heston.
329;If Wyatt Earp with Kevin Costner had the action and pizzazz of Tombstone , what a great movie it could have been!
330;Tombstone is a must see!

334;A real nice touch bringing in these old salty dogs from the glory days of westerns.
335;this film is full of familiar faces, down to the smallest of bit roles.
336;This movie has become a family favorite over the years.
337;the kind where an amusing quote occasionally come up in conversation and everyone knows where it's from.
338;The story has been done many times, but this version is still unique.
339;Tombstone is an excellent western that spares no expense in terms of its starring cast.
340;wyatt, played by Kurt Russell
341;Kilmer may have a reputation of being difficult to work with, but he nails the Holliday character and was deserving of an Oscar nomination (which he didn't receive).
342;His smugness, wrapped in a Georgia accent, is truly a joy to behold.
343;He has so many wonderful lines and scenes that they are too numerous to list here.
344;while the film may not be as historically accurate as some accounts, it certainly is enjoyable.
345;Kurt Russell is at his best in this version of the shoot out at the OK coral.
346;Movie looks and sounds great .
347;one of my favorites, happy to have it in Blu.
348;I have always loved this one best of the Wyatt Earp movies.
349;Val Kilmer makes quite the great Doc.
350;He did a superb job.
351;I would recommend this movie.

353;star cast as Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Charlton Heston, Jason Priestly, Dana Delany, Thomas Haden Church, Billy Bob Thornton, Michael Rooker, Terry O'Quinn and many more.
354;For the most part, the good news is that Tombstone looks very good on Blu.
355;The cinematography by William A. Fraker is absolutely beautiful during some of the scenic shots overlooking the fields, the skyline, dusk and dawn.
356;While many parts of the film showcases many colors and for the most part, detail of the town, the saloon, the skin pores, etc. look great on Blu.
357;but despite the dark look of some scenes, Tombstone definitely looks sharper and more contrast is seen on the Blu.
358;ray release and blacks are nice and deep.
359;But one of the things that you will notice is the use of the surrounds in terms of capturing the ambiance of the outdoor scenes.
360;I thought that was pretty cool.
361;Overall, Tombstone sounds very good via lossless.
362;(4:00) A special feature showcasing the original storyboards of Director George P. Cosmatos.
363;Featuring two theatrical trailers (:60 and :120) and the Friends TV spot (:30).
364;jUDGMENT CALL:Tombstone is an enjoyable film and for those who enjoy Westerns and for those who like the stories of lawmen vs. the outlaws, the film is quite entertaining and a storyline in which both Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer actually do a remarkable job.
365;And Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday at his most charming and also his most vulnerable and how Kilmer plays off the sickly version of Holliday is really well.
366;ray, the film definitely looks and sounds better than its predecessor.
367;It's important to note that the Blu.
368;But you can't help but be pleased with this Blu.
369;overall, Tombstone was an enjoyable Western that I have seen a good number of times.
370;Does it rank high compared to the best Western's out there?
371;Definitely not but in my opinion, it's the best Wyatt Earp film that I have seen yet and it's a film that I just found enjoyable from beginning to end.
372;top.5 Westerns of All time, is GREAT!
373;all in all, Tombstone, in my opinion, is one of the best movies ever made.
374;I thoroughly enjoyed it and although the budget was much lower than the 4 hour Costner movie, Wyatt Earp, which was released around the same time, Tombstone blew it's competition out of the water!
375;Hands down!It is a definite 'must see' not only for western lovers, but for those who enjoy good action movies.
376;One of my all time favorites!
377;Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer are great together in the movie.
378;disc inside were in perfect condition!
379;It can be said of Tombstone that it is a perfect model of the Western genre.
380;once again telling the well.
381;Tombstone vividly recreates the Old West in a manner that pays homage to the Westerns decades before, from the single street lined by houses, hotels, and saloons, to the dry, arid feel of living in these territories.
382;the introduction of its many characters provides a new entrance by another actor in an all.
383;star ensemble cast, with Russell and Val Kilmer leading the way.
384;Russell gives perhaps the best performance of his still.
385;Kilmer plays the eccentric Doc Holliday with a terrific panache and humorous wit
386;it's material like this that director George P. Cosmatos excels at.
387;His character development is well.
388;off sequence at O. k. Corral, Tombstone proves its worth as a modern envisioning of a legendary figure.
389;Some will quibble about its historical accuracy, while others will embrace it wholeheartedly.
390;To be honest, I enjoyed the movie's wonderful energy and realistic depiction of the Old West, which was almost more than enough to make me overlook the shortcomings that befall its beginning.
391;This is a satisfying shoot 'em up, a throwback to the finest Westerns of the genre, pitting good against evil.
392;tOMBSTONE delivers, viewing after viewing.

395;or infamy) appears in one of the film's most amusing scenes.
396;look beyond the historical inaccuracies: TOMBSTONE is escapist entertainment at its best.
397;In my opinion the best western ever made.
398;Val Kilmer gave the best performance of his career so far.
399;The man acted so well, he didn't appear to be acting at all.
400;The entire cast worked well together and the original dialoge was amusing and entertaining.
401;Go ahead and draw that smoke wagon!
402;Russell gave a commanding performance as Earp, one of his best.
403;I always thought 'High Noon' was #1 and 'Shane' #2.
404;Some fiction involved, but also a lot of true facts.
405;It is not only the best western movie, but one of the best movies I've every seen period.
406;For whatever reason, Tombstone is my husband's favorite movie.
407;I've seen Tombstone a few times as well, and liked what the additional scenes added to the story line.
408;Doc Holiday was the true star in this movie.
409;It made the movie entertaining and exciting.
410;It was all around great western.
411;Tombstone is, so far, the best and most accurate depiction of the Tombstone and later life of Wyatt Earp and the life and times of the era.
412;The earthtone colors are simply amazing to view
413;Well the Director's Cut provides a answer but beware the answer will shock you!
414;Better get your own Director's Cut . 
415;Good guys shoot up the bad guys real good while delivering incredibly satisfying lines.
416;Kilmer's never given a better performance and never will.
417;His Southern drawl a thing a beauty.
418;It's an outstanding performance, and how it missed an Academy Award is an utter mystery.
419;You get to see Kurt Russell finally puts his steely blue eyes to good use.
420;And adding Dana Delaney as a love interest is really only a half.
421;But there are so few films made like this anymore that all that seems fresh.
422;It's so old it's new.
423;A good friend of mine and I can't have a conversation about any of life's challenges without quoting one or more lines from this movie.
424;there, now we can be friends again.
425;and I'm looking for the history Channel's riveting story about the REAL WYATT EARP.
426;Great movie a classic watch over and over Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer give masterful performances should have done a follow up
427;In my opinion this movie if not the best, but one of the best modern day westerns I have ever seen.
428;I have seen several versions of the Wyatt Earp story, but this by far is my favorite!
429;Val Kilmer is the best Doc Holiday and Kurt Russell is a great Wyatt Earp.
430;The best western released in my lifetime!
431;The special cuts are really insightful into the making of the movie.
432;is a marked improvement from the original threatrical version.
433;Several key scenes are extended from the original release, and many new scenes are added that give the characters a bit more emotional depth.
434;I enjoyed watching Tombstone, and truly enjoyed the actors as they are some of my favorites.
435;Plenty of action and many scenes are comical.
436;all I can say is great movie.
437;THE FILMTombstone is certainly one of the best westerns ever made.
438;out scenes are terrific, exciting and very well.
439;The set design, costumes, sets, and everything else truly takes you back to the old days of the Wild West.
440;Kurt Russell gives the greatest performance of his entire career as the legendary Wyatt Earp
441;He is both very human and a wouldn't.
442;a. fly kind of guy, but also the baddest dude this side of the Rio Grande!
443;But Val Kilmer absolutely steals the show as the gamblin' gun.
444;He has the best lines (except for the one above, which is given to Kurt Russell), and presents them in a way that is bound to make you laugh/cry/do whatever it is that you're meant to do.
445;Everyone else does great, too.
446;Love backstories in westerns aren't usually all that great, but the one in here is very well.
447;What is added in is very good.
448;Every scene adds more character development or drama to the story, as well as make more sense to the plot/story.
449;of documentary is very entertaining, but unfortuanately it isn't very long (a little less than half an hour).
450;It does have great interviews with the cast and crew, and it's very informative.
451;It makes you realize how much went into making this magnificent western, and you come off respecting the film even more.
452;Also, the cast members offer little insights on their characters, and those are very interesting!
453;rom card game that is featured.
454;The film is presented in a format that is perfect!
455;But what the Vista Series is focused on is the actual film, and in that case, it succeeded beautifully.
456;TOMBSTONE must rank as one of the best westerns in the post.
457;This is due to many of the traditional elements that made the western genre a uniquely American genre, not to mention the disillusionment that the characters in Peckinpah's and Leone's films felt.
458;much has been made of Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday, and he certainly does a lot with the role.
459;gosh,i watched this movie over and over,all the great stars and thier acting was simply amazing,and this movie makes you feel like your actually in the old west.
460;One of the most unforgettable portraits of the cool gunslinger, Doc Holiday.
461;Dennis Quaid came close in his performance of Doc Holiday in the movie Wyatt Earp, but Val Kilmer's Doc Holiday is just tops and is the best reason to see this movie.
462;Val Kilmer (Doc), in my opinion, is the star and gives an oscar winning performance!
463;Kurt Russell improves with age.
464;Gunfight between Kilmer and Biehn was the best part of the movie.
465;'Tombstone' is one of my favorite movies for a variety of reasons.
466;second, it's a great action.
467;Russell was magnificent as Mr. Earp.
468;fourth, Val Kilmer played a fantastic role as Doc Holliday (who may have been my illegitimate great.
469;What a wonderful interpretation of Doc he gave.
470;fifth, Powers Booth was a great Curly Bill.
471;He was wonderful in the part.
472;sixth, the setting and the location shots seemed to be right on target.
473;Nice to see that authenticity.
474;Texas Jack Vermillion and Turkey Creek Jack Johnson were real people, and friends of Wyatt.
475;It's possible they came back to finish Ringo, who most certainly had a hand in murdering Morgan.
476;There is so much debate about his death.
477;I watch it over and over again, and will continue to do so.
478;Even if you're not into the history of the period, you'll enjoy a great action movie, excellent music, and some terrific acting.
479;toting crack shot was masterful and perfect.
480;memorable performances as Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow but also to the Academy nominated Dustin Hoffman for his portrayal of a crippled petty thief named Ratzo Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy(1969).
481;above the acting jobs of that year.
482;heartedly adore, admire and recommend this film to others.
483;All the actors were good.
484;This is my favorite western movie and the best Wyatt Earp movie out there.
485;I have watched it many times and I think it is Val Kilmer's best performance.
486;I was very impressed with Tombstone.
487;Being careful not wash the dirt off the story by Hollywood splendor, the film delivers a very gritty and accurate account of the events leading up to and after the now famous gunfight at the OK Corral.
488;The film also reminds us that the heros in the story weren't powerful, heroic or perfect men, they were just men.
489;It is also worth noting that Val Kilmer gave one of the most incredible performances of his career as Doc Holiday, a shady southern gambler inflicted with tuberculosis.
490;I fully recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great modern western.
491;I had no intention of writing a review of this movie, as so many others have done a superb job of that already.
492;As this fair town has suffered enough from such sensitive/enviromentalnut/socialist/hippy types I thought it necessary to balance the record.
493;this film is simply magnificent.
494;The acting, the sets, clothing, pace of action, the soundtrack, etc., etc., are all done to perfection.
495;It combines the best elements of a historical film and a solid action movie.
496;Perhaps the strongest feature is the character development.
497;few films have the power to inspire, entertain and enlighten at the same time.
498;this is an outstanding movie.
499;kurt Russell and Kilmer have great chemistry working together as Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday.
500;michael Biehn is focused and intense as their nemeis with a heart of pure eil.
501;this movie will keep you watching from first fram to last.
502;the scripting ,cinematography , pacing and excellent performances from an ensemble cast will make you want to watch this more than once.
503;Tombstone moves along at a great pace and every scene offers attention grabbing excitement.
504;The intensity of the direction in unmatched by any western prior to or since!
505;The wife and I just love to watch this movie and on Blu Ray there is a new dimension added to ones viewing pleasure.
506;Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday in their finest hours!
507;A must for any western fan, US history buff or just good old fashioned good uy shoot.
508;Without question, this is the definitive western of the last 45 years of movie making.
509;For western fan and non.
510;fan alike, this is the best of the genre.
511;Val Kilmer positively steals the show with his exquisite performance as Doc Holliday.
512;His wit and warmth toward Wyatt, his self.
513;confessed only friend, add a charm to the film that transcends the story and will make you want to watch it over and over.
514;His electrifying delivery of his line why, Johnny Ringo!
515;Sam Elliot delivers his usual excellent effort as Virgil Earp and Bill Paxton's Morgan Earp deftly handles the not.
516;subtle awe in which he holds his older brother, Wyatt.
517;And, see if you can spot Jason Priestley in one of his early film roles.
518;This one is a must have for anyone who wants the best movies, regardless of genre.
519;It is not just the best western ever
520;I think this is one of my all time favorites!
521;All the stars are amazing and the storyline is entertaining and engrossing.
522;Ladies will LOVE Kurt, Val, Sam and Bill in all of their western glory.
523;The twist in the showdown between Wyatt and Johnny Ringo is great.
524;One of the best western's of all time.
525;Val Kilmer should have won the Academy Award!
526;Drama, action, humor and romance!
527;This is one of the best westerns of all time.
528;recommended for fans of the old west and for fans of Sam Elliott, like me.
529;russell puts on a strong show as well.
530;I can watch it over and over, and truly, there were times I have.
531;TOMBSTONE is not as contemplative as MY DARLING CLEMENTINE or HOUR OF THE GUN or GUNFIGHT AT THE O. k. CORRAL, but its sheer bravado and energy kept my eyeballs glued to the screen.
532;TOMBSTONE breathes thunder and swagger into an old western legend.
533;draw killer Johnny Ringo and numbering the Clantons in its roster.
534;And then Wyatt Earp came to Tombstone, retired from his days as a Kansas peace officer and intent only on a fresh start as an entrepreneur with his brothers.
535;All I know is that I'm always hugely entertained when I see this movie.
536;I just like to see bullets fly with impunity.
537;Familiar faces dot this landscape, quite a bit of these actors being of the manly persuasion: Sam Elliot, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Charlton Heston, Michael Rooker, Billy Bob Thornton, and even Robert Mitchum drops by to do some narrative voice.
538;Russell is bedrock solid as the centerpiece, playing Wyatt Earp with unrelenting intensity and boring holes with his icy stare.
539;The faro dealer is properly cowed, and keep in mind that this is Billy Bob Thornton playing the faro dealer.
540;it's Kilmer, though, in his best role ever, who walks away with the universal plaudits.
541;Val Kilmer is magnificent and magnificently sly in a performance that manages to simultaneously convey terminal sickliness and a detached, reckless flair.
542;ridden, cuts a tragic figure, and yet he delivers the most memorable lines, cool customer that he is.
543;A marvelous bit of cinema surfaces when Doc Holliday and Johnny Ringo (a mad dog Michael Biehn) bait each other in Latin and then there's that inspired contest of braggadocio immediately following.
544;driven revenge movie like this.
545;It's an important part in american history and I think they capture the strength and gumption in these people.
546;I'm sure that's cool too!
547;the admirable action sequences, the formidable edition and the presence of Val Kilmer playing his best performance 's lifetime until this date as Doc Holiday, will make of this film the last superior Western made until now.
548;Cosmatos made undoubtedly his masterpiece, although the occupied place by My Darling Clementine still remains unmatchable.
549;And that title line is one of Val Doc Holliday Kilmer's signature quotes from this incredible 1993 film.
550;The packaging is absolutely gorgeous and the extras are absolutely worth it.
551;these and many other questions are answered when you see the original cut of the film, and finally see the deleted scenes.
552;the incredible amount of care and planning that went into the detail of set and costume design and decoration.
553;Watch the film at least once with Cosmatos' running commentary and you'll learn a lot more about one of the best, most authentic Westerns ever made.
554;the incredible ensamble cast works perfectly together.
555;while I like Kostner's film too, Tombstone is the superior of the two.
556;I have a lot of favorites.
557;the epic Cinerama How The West Was Won.
558;And quite a few others including The Treasure of The Sierra Madre.
559;Kurt Russell plays a convincing Wyatt Earp.
560;Tombstone is a fantastic western with great characters, action, dialogue, cinematography and direction.
561;Kurt Russel also gives a very solid performance as Wyatt Earp.
562;This is one of my favorite westerns of all time but certainly it is the best to come out in the past 20 years.
563;Opening on Christmas Day in 1993, Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer's Tombstone film enjoyed more than a half.year's head start on rival Kevin Costner's similar (and far more expensive) pet project, Wyatt Earp.
564;Largely through word of mouth, they easily won the battle of the box office.
565;In terms of pure entertainment, the romanticized Tombstone deserved to win, at least at that time because it carefully treaded the line between an adult Western melodrama (hence, the R rating) and often cartoony but vintage Hollywood clich s, making it appealing to a very wide range of audiences.
566;Its ominous poster tagline, Justice is Coming, spells out perfectly the old.
567;Using his expertise, there are several thematic choices that are simplistically brilliant here.
568;The four that most come to mind are: 1.
569;Obviously, no real Old West desperado would have sought that kind of unwanted legal attention, but it works really well for Hollywood's frontier mobsters in this movie who just don't care about anonymity.
570;the third important choice is focusing the film equally on Wyatt and Doc Holliday.
571;star ensemble cast, including old hand Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Dana Wheeler.
572;lawmen putting the silver badge on again.
573;lastly, the fourth factor is correctly presenting names and accepted historical events in the right order while heavily embellishing other facts about the great Earp and Holliday.
574;Tombstone also benefits from a majestic, well.
575;balanced musical score from Bruce Broughton, and the fact that the filmmakers strove to make their Arizona location shooting (in Tucson) as colorful as possible, even with a close recreation of Tombstone itself.
576;As I stated in my review of Wyatt Earp, I honestly believe that, had these rival productions actually worked together by pooling all their mighty resources, a better and more profitable film would have resulted.
577;If they are compared side by side, I would consider the two films as roughly even with an edge to Costner's film for technical merits).
578;The performance of Val Kilmer as the role of Doc Holiday should have been awarded with the best supporting actor in a major role.
579;In my honest opinion, this is the greatest western movie ever produced.
580;The movie was great, brand new, just as it was advertised.
581;I'm very pleased, ValKilmar is a great actor, he plays doc holiday.
582;On the positive side this is the best it has looked and sounded so far.
583;For those who want to get to the gist, I will say that I think Wyatt Earp is probably more accurate historically, but I found Tombstone much more entertaining.
584;The Gunfight is more exciting.2.
585;Kurt Russell's Wyatt is more likeable and identifiable with than Kevin Costner's.3.
586;The friendship between Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday is better developed here.5.
587;The ending does not drag, and is more satisfying.
588;nicholson's, and Linden Ashby is a more vibrant Morgan Earp.
589;But if you want an enjoyable and entertaining adventure, get this one!!!
590;this was an outstanding film
591;The best western I've ever seen.
592;There have been many filmings of the Wyatt Earp saga, most done well.
593;John Ford with his excellent My Darling Clementine, two John Sturges films, Gunfight at OK Corral, and Hour of the Gun.
594;Both excellent and hold up well.
595;And along comes Tombstone, not as heralded as versions that came before, but what a brilliant piece of movie.
596;Tomestone injects new life into this time.
597;Kurt Russell is a tower of strength as Wyatt Earp.
598;His brothers are well played by Sam Elliot as brother Virgil and Bill Paxton as brother Morgan.
599;The rest of the cast are finely cast and good in their roles.
600;But the role that really galvanizes this movie to real greatness is Doc Holliday played by Val Kilmer.
601;The photography by co. producer William Fraker is superb, with thunderstorms, swirling dust and wide distant Arizona vistas.
602;Kudos to the the costume and set designers for a original, realistic look to the production.
603;And one last kudo to Kevin Jarre for his wonderful, funny, screenplay.
604;Tombstone evokes the time, the flawed people of the wild west, shows great attention to details and is a positively kinetic piece of movie making that makes the heart beat faster, entertains, and leaves us with the sadness of a west long gone, even if it is a west of legend, violent and confusing.
605;That Tombstone won no awards is incredible.
606;This movie was clearly one of the best if not the best movie of the year.
607;Tombstone is one of the best westerns of all time.
608;Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer in particular played their parts exceptionally well.
609;It is certainly one of my favorite western movies.
610;His virtuoso performance as Doc Holliday is infinitely more worthy of an Academy Award than most of those that have got the Oscar.
611;With so many good actors, you gotta have a great script, and Tombstone is one of the best written (although serious liberties were taken with the facts), directed, edited and filmed movies ever made.
612;Even through the digressions, the story moves along at a nice clip and will keep your attention.
613;The cinematography is really excellent and at times brilliant
614;Tombstone is a favorite movie of many of my family members ranging from my 9 year old daughter to my husband to my father and brother!!
615;Val Kilmer absolutely makes the movie with his wonderful rendition of Doc Holliday.
616;I think this movie is excellent.
617;the actors all play thier roles well and make it believable.
618;This is a must see!
619;Wyatt Earp has one of the most remarkable stories in the history of the American West.
620;Russell and Kilmer are phenominal in their best performances and the entire ensemble cast is perfect.
621;You feel like they had the best time of their lives making this wonderful movie.
622;One of my favorite movies ever.
623;Just a great movie with a great story.
624;Tombstone is one of the most entertaining pieces of cinema to hit the silver screen in the past 15 years.
625;Kurt Russell does a fantastic job portraying former Sheriff Wyatt Earp.
626;Russell's Earp is at a crossroads in his life and sure, really, of only two things: he wants to make a lot of money and he wants to live near his two brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton).
627;Wyatt's sidekick is perhaps the best thing about Tombstone.
628;Val Kilmer turns in an unforgettable performance as Doc Holiday.
629;Holiday is by far the most intriguing character in the film and endears himself to the viewer almost instantly.
630;Kilmer simply steals every scene he is in, which makes for one of the most memorable (and lovable) movie characters of all.
631;The pacing is fantastic and almost all of the movie is action packed.
632;Overall, Tombstone is easily in my top five favorite films of all.
633;But this movie gets more involved with the relationship between Doc and Wyatt.
634;With the extra features, you get a better account of the actual people involved.
635;Tombstone represents one of those rare occasions where a much.
636;hyped all star cast actually puts out a spectacular film.
637;george P. Cosmotos' vision comes across as very honest and passionate reproduction of the old west.
638;The camera work is expert, utilizing extreme close ups and dramatic angles.
639;the real treat here is the acting.
640;This is undoubtedly a prime moment for both actors.
641;Russel's Wyatt Earp is a brave, tough and unflinching former law man.
642;Kilmer's Doc Holliday is a famous con man who's heart is in the right place.
643;Kilmer plays Holliday as a smart.
644;Supporting players Powers Booth, Bill Paxton, and particularly Sam Elliot are right on their games as well.
645;More people need exposure to great films like Tombstone.
646;Great Price, fast shipping and entertainment that keeps on giving.
647;Great western, Doc Holiday steals the show in this movie.
648;I loved it it was just as perfect as always, if you already love it get it in blue ray.
649;Val Kilmer was terrific as Doc Holliday, as was Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp!
650;Great action and intense acting!
651;A man of his word to himself and the people he protected.
652;hollywood pictures and Andrew G. Vajna present an epic, 130.
653;The epic saga of Wyatt Earp is as deep as the cast is vivid.
654;starring the acclaimed cast of Kurt Russell (Backdraft) as Wyatt Earp, Val Kilmer (The Doors) as the eccentric yet distinguished Doc Holliday, and Sam Elliot, Bill Paxton, Dana Delany, Jason Priestley, Michael Bien, and Charlton Heston round out the extraordinary cast that appears not to be acting at all.
655;the suspense builds as the Earp's set forth to grab the brass ring of fortune.
656;This film is packed with adventure, thrills, romance and intrigue.
657;Take a step back in time with Wyatt Earp and fire the gun of peace and justice.
658;and although Henry Fonda has been claimed the best Wyatt Earp on screen, Russell gives us a great performance as the great sheriff.
659;Other notable performances in this movie are Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Robert Burke, Sam Elliot, Stephan Lang, Bill Paxton, Billy Zane, Terry O' Quinn, and a small but notable performance from screen icon Charleton Heston.
660;This works for a while until an event sparks his fury which I won't mention so that it won't ruin it for the viewers who haven't seen it yet.
661;Add Val Kilmer, Sam Neil, and Bill Paxton into the mix and what you get doesn't exactly scream A list but what you do have is an ensemble cast that gels particularly well
662;The bond of brotherhood and friendship between the Earp's and Doc Holiday feels genuine and Kilmer clearly relishes the scene stealing part of sickly gentleman adrenaline junkie Holiday.
663;Powers Booth and Michael Biehn also make charismatic villains, the scenes between Biehn and Kilmer being particularly sharp and the Peckinpahesque shoot outs extremely well staged.
664;In fact the shoot out at the OK corral is one of the best versions yet filmed.
665;It is an excellent movie in all respects.
666;i have read many and thoroughly enjoyed them.
667;One could make a lifetime study ,and rather than resolving the controversaries
668;without a doubt, the events and characters are now classics and will continue to be.
669;I enjoyed this movie immensely,as I have others 
670;i found this little bit of information on the net that is interesting.
671;i visited the Town of Tombstone and found it was a wonderful and worthwhile trip.
672;The conversations going on among them seemed authentic to the Old West period.
673;The town is about the same size as what is portrayed in the movies,and you can even visit Boot Hill and the graves of those who died there at the time.
674;many of the buildings are open and you feel welcomed.
675;Overall a great, interesting and captivating telling of the Wyatt Earp story and in my opinion, far better than the Kevin Costner version that came out about the same time.
676;This movie is crazy good .
677;a movie one can watch over and over and over again.
678;definitely a keeper in anyone's western collection!
679;This is truly a perfect flawless western!
680;it was mastered perfect in blu.
681;This is a stunning western masterpiece!
682;A friend recommended that we watch this movie and she was absolutely correct.
683;the plot and the cast were excellent, especially Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer.
684;Killmer was especially good as Doc Holliday.
685;All time favorite movie, must see for everyone!
686;This movie is very close to the actual circumstances of the OK Corral.
687;Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliot (who is so perfect in westerns it makes you wonder if he was time shifted from 1880!!)
688;, and Bill Paxton are great!
689;Then you see some of the actors from classic western movies and TV back as older men.
690;This is a GREAT movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it!
691;I would recommend it to anyone who likes Western movies!
692;The story of Wyatt Earp is fairly well known.
693;All these elements and more are present.
694;What I do care about is that this was a fun movie.
695;i like seeing the bad guys get their comeuppance as well as the next guy but what makes this movie work is a combination of the story and the characterizations and the acting and the cinematography.
696;The good guys are good but they do have their human problems as well.
697;The purpose of this one is to see the good guys beat the bad guys and feel good about it.
698;That alone is worth the price of admission.
699;put your mind on hold and just sit back to enjoy it.
700;This is a good western, I like how family stood together no matter what.
701;I would recommend it to my father in law he love's western.
702;There are few westerns that can compare to this film.
703;It is vastly underrated and Val Kilmer gives a bravo performance as Doc Holliday.
704;Russell always gives a believable performance and it's time he is recognized.
705;this movie has it all: real, engaging human drama, intelligent dialogue, good character development, characters that cause the viewer to connect with them, humor, lots of action, but not just endless, mindless action, excellent time.
706;piece sets and costumes, good authenticity (that is, no obvious anachronisms with the guns, etc.)
707;this movie gets good right from the beginning with the voice of Robert Mitchum narrating some background information.
708;The scripting and acting is simply flawless in places.
709;when the bad guys are introduced to the audience as really, really bad, there is a reference to a passage in Revelations that is gripping and ominous.
710;Also, in this early scene there is a telling look on the face of one of the Cowboys that will become meaningful in the fullness of the story telling.
711;WOW, this is just brilliant and edifying story telling with film.
712;There were some smart and talented people writing this stuff.
713;load it in your player, get comfy, and just enjoy.
714;Seeing Life as it WAS.
715;the image above may not represent the correct edition)First off, the picture and color in this widescreen presentation is beautiful!
716;Director George P. Cosmatos provides a detailed commentary (in which he makes repeated assertions that this movie's depiction of the gunfight at the O. k. Corral is the most accurate one yet filmed) and you can feel his love for this movie and the actors in it.
717;this is certainly a fun and exciting movie, but reign in your expectations about the volume of bonus goodies.
718;But if you have a DTS sound system and a good sized TV for the widescreen presentation, you will enjoy it nonetheless.
719;Personally, I found her captivating, and .
720;the most attractive I have ever seen her.
721;kurt Russell turns in another excellent performance, proving once again that he has grown considerably as an actor over the years.
722;are carefully crafted and played to perfection.
723;Chalk this up as another excellent performance (e. g. Thunderheart) by the oft.
724;do yourselves a favor and view this movie as a stand.
725;Just enjoy it as it is .
726;told tale, a violent love story (think True Romance set in the 19th century if you will), full of outstanding performances.
727;my guess is that in time this movie will establish itself as an audience favorite regardless of expert opinion.
728;And the cast members have every reason to be proud of a truly fine ensemble performance.
729;But I believe the best actor in this movie was Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday.
730;He plays the character so well and gets in the swing of things so quickly.
731;Whomever casted this movie did an excellent job and the movie shows it!
732;Val Kilmer puts in the best performance of the movie in his portrayal of the self.
733;Kurt Russell is also good as Wyatt Earp.
734;There is lots of beautiful scenery and the gorgeous shots of sunrises and sunsets is juxtaposed with the raw violence of the gun battles.
735;This is a great movie for Western fans.
736;Came super fast and as always was happy with product.
737;One of my favorite movies of all time!
738;It is so great on blu.
739;It will become a family favorite
740;see movie for me every year.
741;Great for people who aren't into westerns as well.
742;This movie is Val Kilmer's best role HANDS DOWN.
743;One of the best western's ever.
744;Product arrived in great condition.
745;this is my second favorite movie and I wanted it on Blu.
746;My first favorite is The Godfather I and II.
747;Val Kilmer is fantastic as is Kurt Russell.
748;Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo dominates every scene he's in and the bar scene with him and Val Kilmer is a great moment where Doc uses his droll humor to diffuse an otherwise deadly situation.
749;This movie is definitely my Huckleberry!
750;I always enjoy watching Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday.
751;This is one of my favorite movies .
752;much better than the one with Kevin Costner in my opinion.
753;This is one of the great westerns.
754;Val Kilmer, Kurt Russel, Sam Elliot and even Jason Priestly give the best performances of their careers.
755;actually Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday is one of my favorite characters in any movie and Kurt Russel is perfect as Wyatt Earp.
756;Now that's a Tombstone I'd love to see.
757;I bought this movie as a gift for my uncle who ended up leaving my aunt before Christmas so he never received the movie I however enjoy this movie.
758;There are a lot of good western films, but I think this one blows them all out of the water.
759;The story of Wyatt Earp, his brothers, and Doc Holliday, and their battle with the Cowboy's organized crime gang is legendary.
760;Kurt Russel, Sam Elliot, Bill Paxton, Stephan Lang, Charlton Heston, Michael Biehn, Billy Zane, and Val Kilmer make this movie shine.
761;This film is a must see for anyone who likes a good western, drama, or action movie.
762;watch it learn it love it.
763;and you, music lover, you're next.
764;This was a gift for my husband who loves this movie.
765;This is one of my favorite movies.
766;This is a very good movie
767;This is a top notch western!
768;The best gunfights I have seen since Pale Rider.
769;Definately two thumbs way up.
770;and imho no one till Val really got it right till this 90's Movie i play mine every five months.
771;I enjoyed this movie and the actors that played in it.
772;val kilmer is a good actor and kurt russell too.
773;Tombstone has been one of my favorite contemporary westerns.
774;I found the film to have the same qualities of the movie classics such as High Noon and Magnificent Seven yet updated with more realistic acting and dialogue.
775;Tombstone portrayed their characters with a natural acting style which, I feel, is more believable than older films.
776;i loved Kurt Russell's strength, with lines like, I'm coming and hell's coming with me!
777;I feel that Tombstone has been his defining role in film, and one of the best charachter roles in film, period.
778;for such a memorable performance.
779;love the director's cut of this movie.
780;one of my favorite movies of all time.
781;Like many westerns, it's a story of honor, loyalty, and an inescapable journey wrestling with one's character.
782;in many ways, it bears striking similarity with Alan Ladd's portrayal of Shane many, many years ago.
783;Both men imagine they can escape that past and live a life of peace and normalcy.
784;powerful roles are fulfilled by Sam Elliott as brother Virgil, but perhaps the most telling observation is made by the youngish Bill Paxton playing the role of brother Morgan, who tells Wyatt when he won't go along with him and Virgil to again strap on the six.
785;shooters, you gotta' back your brother's play.
786;If I found pleasure in the movie it was superlative qualities of all of the actors, and the grittiness of the scenery.
787;And a lot of blood.
788;Having said that, Tombstone carries the day with brilliant acting on all levels, especially Sam Elliot and Val Kilmer, who carry the supporting roles they are assigned as the ailing Doc Holliday and Virgil with a high level of skill.
789;oNE of the best we have bought in a while.
790;We love this movie and being able to get it on blu.
791;ray made it even better.
792;Was a great price and came in the mail quickly.
793;My husband loves these type of movies.
794;Val Kilmer graces the screen in this stylish, sophisticated, and highly entertaining Western.
795;I've been told he studied this role (as he does all his roles)for an extensive period of time, and the results are truly incredible.
796;Billy Bob Thornton's 10 minute portrayal of Johnny Tyler is spectacular and Michael Biehn's Johnny Ringo is superb.
797;What a romantic, sinister period of our history, and Tombstone truly and masterfully represents it!
798;A very good Western, Tombstone, brings to the screen the story of the well known Wyatt Earp as he and his brothers arrive in Tombstone Arizona in search of a better future for themselves.
799;, Bill Paxton, Thomas Haden Church, Terry O'Quinn (from Lost), Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Zane, Charlton Heston and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!
800;All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!
801;Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the costumes, the gunfights, and the music are all wonderful!In short, Tombstone is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!For wonderful Westerns I would strongly recommend The Outlaw Josey Wales, Major Dundee and The Undefeated.
802;One of my favorite movies ever!
803;I've watched it about 10 times already and will watch it again.
804;the best of the modern western movies.
805;Kurt Russell was amazing and it's is THE BEST roleVal Kilmer has ever done.
806;The actors did a fabulous job in this movie.
807;How can you possibly beat Sam Elliott, Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Bill Paxton, Powers Boothe, Billy Zane, Michael Biehn, Dana Delany, and Joanna Pacula.
808;Those are just to name some of the faces you will recognize.
809;It draws you in and keeps your undivided attention from the beginning until the awesome ending.
810;Love this move and even better in blue ray.
811;This is what Hollywood films are all about: big casts, large conflict, and compelling characters.
812;Doc Holliday also lives there, winning card games like Mark Maguire makes home runs.
813;But the outlaw gang the Cowboys are menacing the town and stirring up trouble.
814;This is an extremely remarkable film with great acting, a thick plot, and some suspense.
815;see for any movie buff.
816;One of the best westerns also made.
817;The product was excellent and even had a map of tombstone plus many other features which I didn't expect .
818;I was more than happy with this product.
819;ALL my favourite actors in one place .
820;I think it's a true reflection of what life was like in the  old days .
821;The story line was brilliant as was the acting.
822;This movie got slammed by Kevin Costner who was making his own version of Wyatt Earp to be released at the same time as this one.
823;the performances of everyone in the cast are terrific.
824;I always want it to go on longer than it does.
825;My husband and I and our friends have watched it many times and it never gets old.
826;and that's a big plus.
827;It has a great sense of place.
828;I think this is Val Kilmer's best performance .
829;quite probably Kurt Russell's best work too.
830;It is a super good western, with all the elements that make westerns a great genre.
831;I prefer this film of Tomstone better than any other.
832;This is a fun movie.
833;Bill Paxton is good as Wyatt's brother Morgan.
834;Not so much a true narrative as a series of vignettes featuring the above characters (with the centerpiece Shootout at the OK Corral) the film is nonetheless a very entertaining look at these characters.
835;kilmer's Doc Holliday, in particular, is a load of fun.
836;The other man scoffs I've got LOTS of friends .
837;What you've got to do is grab each person you know by the lapels and shake them back and forth while screaming in their face that they absolutely must see this film.
838;easily the most inspired character in all of fiction.
839;ray is a great western about a true event that happened in history.
840;Great acting leads to great action.
841;adventure which will keep you nailed to your seat to see what happens next.
842;Tombstone is probably the best of them other than John Ford's classic My Darling Clementine, which remains in a class of its own.
843;Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday is the finest I have ever seen on screen.
844;His performance will never erase memories of Henry Fonda, but it is solid.
845;Russell captures some of the moral ambiguity of the real Wyatt Earp.
846;the supporting cast is very good, led by a magnificent performance by Sam Elliott as Virgil Earp.
847;Also noteworthy are Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn as the Earp's foes, Curly Bill and Johnny Ringo, and Dana Delany as Josie Marcus, Wyatt's love interest.
848;Western buffs will also want to watch for veteran Dobie Carey in a small role.
849;tombstone is also a visually beautiful movie.
850;some of the cinematography is spectacular.
851;But overall, Tombstone is a very fine Western.
852;Beautiful cinematography of gorgeous Arizona locations!
853;Big sky for miles and miles!
854;I think a very underrated performance is Michael Biehn's as the haunted Johnny Ringo.
855;I also really enjoyed Stephen Lang as Ike Clanton, you can almost smell him!There's also a ton of memorable dialouge and quoteable one.
856;It's a treat for any lover of the Western genre.
857;really good movie i recommend highly
858;I love western films and this one did not disappoint.
859;Wonderful film with great characters and awesome acting!
860;If you like westerns this is a must see film.
861;This movie is great, one of my favorites of all time.
862;Watch it on a big screen with surround sound.
863;My husband and I love good westerns, and this is one of our favorites.
864;There are even a few added scenes in this director's cut that make the movie more complete than the original, which left you guessing as to what happened to a few of the characters.
865;The whole cast is excellent, and Val Kilmer as Doc is superb and unforgettable.
866;There are 'guy' movies and there are 'girl' movies, also known as 'date movies' or 'chick flicks.'
867;Anything with Hugh Grant qualifies as a date movie, while Fried Green Tomatoes is a chick flick.
868;Beaches is a chick flick.
869;Steel Magnolias is most definetly a chick flick.
870;well, if you like spicy hot buffallo wings dripping with bleu cheese, cold beer, and football, this movie is for you.
871;ultimate guy film: GUILTY PLEASURE.
872;laden morality plays and Oscar.
873;And thank goodness for that!
874;hand man, the homicidal gunslinger Johnny Ringo.
875;And this is just his first day in town!
876;gambler pal Doc Holliday, who gets even better dialogue than Wyatt, and gets to say it in a marvelous Tidewater.
877;frills facial massage, saying, All right you cur!
878;It's just entertainment, and the actors, most especially Val Kilmer, have a blast living out their childhood fantasies of playing Once Upon a Time in the West.
879;Like Wyatt, I'll take my oath on it.
880;George Cosmatos' Tombstone is pure and simply a masterpiece, nothing more, nothing less.
881;The narrative serves its purpose in setting up the viewer for the rest of the film.
882;what is great about this film?
883;The cast of this film had fun disappearing into their roles.
884;kurt Russell gives an excellent performance Wyatt Earp.
885;Stephen Lang (a brilliant character actor on the level of John Turturro) is invisible behind the persona of Ike Clanton.
886;Dana Delany is Josephine Marcus the true love of Wyatt's life.
887;to add to this colorful cast, we have some interesting cameos.
888;but I come to the really outstanding performance belongs to Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday.
889;He steals every scene with a fine, nuanced performance.
890;He's got the best lines in the script.
891;You'll want to watch this film more than once.
892;Few fans of Tombstone may realize how close to reality this modern classic is.
893;Much of the success belongs to the original screenwriter and director Kevin Jarre.
894;all that said this is a great piece of entertainment realized by a wonderful cast lead by Russell, Kilmer and an all.
895;Enjoy it once, twice or many times as you'll always find something new to make it an exciting experience.
896;Tombstone has got to be one of my top 5 favorite movies.
897;I've watched it countless times, and the initial interest and pleasure at it's viewing hasn't worn off.
898;Val Kilmer is a joy to watch, and the rest of the fairly large cast are excellent.
899;watch this movie as soon as possible.
900;One of the best and most AUTHENTIC western movies can now be seen the way the director meant it to be seen.
901;I loved the DTS soundtrack.
902;It really gives the action scenes a lot of punch.
903;Also, the special features are very good.
904;He wants peace, quiet, and above all else : prosperity.
905;The shoot out scenes and overall non stop action is amazing in this film.
906;Tombstone also gives an extremely acurate portrayal of events as well.
907;Kurt Russell gave the best performance possible as Wyatt Earp.
908;He nailed the fierce determination and sense of justice.
909;Val Kilmer gave the best performance in the film as Doc Holliday.
910;Bill Paxton and Sam Elliot make nice additions as the Earp brothers.
911;Unbelieveable chemistry between her and Kurt Russell!!
912;Billy Bob Thorton makes a hilarious cameo in the film as well.
913;I have seen many Westerns since Tombstone , but it is still the greatest Western ever made in my opinion.
914;Visually stimulating and fun to watch.
915;He plays doc holiday, and he makes the movie worth watching, and kurt russell is also worthy.
916;I also enjoyed Dana Delany becvause she is beautiful and a great actress.
917;The main reason why this movie was so good was the great lines.
918;It's all good and fun.
919;of the 2 movies that came out about wyatt earp that year tombstone is the better made better shot and better acted of the pair.
920;I am only just really a kid and all I have to say is that I love this movie!
921;Val Kilmer is now a major crush on my list an has proven to be one of the best unrated actors in the job.
922;His acting as Doc should have won him a Oscar.
923;All the actors did a great job making their cahracters come alive.
924;The story was very good and the director's cut is great, showing parts that should have been the first one.
925;Over all one of the best Western movies ever made, even better than Dances with Wolves!
926;Along with the picture comes a digital track that brings to your home the wild west.
927;Disc 2 has a varity of goodies like Making An Authentic Western, and The Gunfight At The O. k. Corral.
928;Great acting, beautifully shot and edited, never a dull moment.
929;This movie is fun to watch.
930;Its the characters that make this movie a one of a kind.
931;Val Kilmer is incredible in this movie, with his acting prowess and one liners it cant be beat.
932;A good old fashion gunslinging movie!
933;This is a wonderful story of love on many levels.
934;Throw in honor and loyalty and this movie speaks to us all.
935;This is definitly one of the best westerns made.
936;Kurt Russell and company proves they can go back into time and become their characters.
937;val Kilmer should have received an Oscar for Supporting Actor that year.
938;they played their characters to perfection.
939;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
940;I love Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer and Sam Elliot.
941;This 1993 western may have received mixed reviews from critics when it was released, but it has since become a cult classic film that is still great movie that even people who don't like westerns can enjoy.
942;The film is carried at a rather nice pace, and the sublime casting of Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday makes Tombstone work.
943;Kilmer turns in his best performance, while Kurt Russell turns in a near equally great performance as Wyatt Earp.
944;The huge ensemble cast includes Sam Elliot, Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn, Powers Boothe, Dana Delany, Jason Priestly, Billy Zane, Billy Bob Thornton, Michael Rooker, John Corbett, Thomas Haden Church, Stephen Lang, Robert John Burke, Charlton Heston, and the voice of Robert Mitchum in major and supporting roles, along with some great gunfights and brilliant set design all help Tombstone be a feast of the senses.
945;MY HUSBAND and I love this movie.
946;One of my favorites of all time.
947;On a widescreen, such as a laptop or tablet, the video is so tiny!
948;The story, the music, photography, and above all Kurt Russel.
949;I have loved this movie since it came out.
950;Probably the most accurate account ever produced on film.
951;Val Kilmer is an absoloute superb Doc Holiday who should have won awards for his performance and Kurt Russell is a great Wyatt Earp.
952;This is a must see film, western fan or not, it's a must see.
953;Something for everyone in this film.
954;This is arguably the greatest Western movie ever produced.
955;My sincere thanks to those who produced this work of art and history and hope that someday it may be included in the archives of outstanding historical works.
956;I love Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday and the rest of the crew of fantastic actors in this flick.
957;The story line is good and Michael Biehn as the bad guy is awesome.
958;Tombstone is a classic movie with great actors.you will laugh, cry, be scared and want for more when it is over.
959;This is a great action movie that we all love but not very close to the truth of what will happen but a great movie!!
960;This movie is sure to be a classic.
961;adventure with an outstanding cast.
962;It depicts Wyatt Earp and his family and friends.
963;Its a great story of love, friendship and loyalty.
964;In my opinion one of the greatest western films.
965;This is one of those movies you just have to have in your library.
966;Great western, with plenty of action and a GREAT cast!!!
967;I love this epic western.
968;Great western and very historically accurate!!
969;I recommend everyone watch this movie especially if you love the story of Wyatt Earp!
970;Of all the westerns ive seen in my days id have to say this is the most moving ive ever seen.
971;An entertaining movie that sends us a message about brotherly love and friendship.
972;It's a classic!I just love the scene where Doc Holiday shows thatoutlaw what he's working with!
973;One of the greatest westerns ever made.
974;This is one of the best westerns that I have seen in a long time.
975;Pair this one with Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven and you have the two superlative movies of the last decade.
976;This remake far surpasses the original Gunfight at the O. k. Corral, with its perfect casting of Kurt Russell, Powers Boothe, Sam Eliott, Bill Paxton, and Jason Priestly who shows that he can exist outside of the 90210 zip code.
977;but it is Val Kilmer, one of Tinseltown's most gifted chameleons who immerses himself as the legendary Doc Holliday.
978;Everyone in my circle of friends lauded his performance as one of the finest that has ever graced the silver screen.
979;First and foremost, the director's cut of the movie is so good it makes you wonder why it wasn't released to theaters like this.
980;The theatrical release was like a middle age Young Guns, but this edition of the film is a real character study.
981;Now, they movie does play fast and loose with the facts, but hey, we are here to enjoy ourselves, and this movie does that.
982;1993 found a memorable cast working together to make a great film.
983;Val Kilmer plays a witty and charasmatic Doc Holliday .
984;the best I've ever seen .
985;probably one of Kilmer's finest Hollywood roles.
986;A chunky Billy Bob Thornton has a memorable role as Johnny Tyler .
987;The first half of the movie sets up the characters nicely.
988;The town with it's buildings and surroundings were believeable.
989;This special (2002) director's cut 2.
990;A classic western and a personal favorite (5 stars).
991;Tombstone is a classic western but it is better than than.
992;Probably his best role ever (although I have not seen many of his other movies .
993;Without a doubt my favorite movie, and not just in westerns, but all genres.
994;the latter (The Director's Cut) adds deleted scenes back into the movie, and gives the movie a whole new feel, which is definitely not a better feel, to say the least.
995;Director George Cosmatos worked with a large cast and all of the performances are first.
996;William Fraker's cinematography and Bruce Broughton's musical score are carefully integrated within the narrative and serve it well.
997;The involvement of the Earps coincide with a growing local desire among residents to establish law and order.
998;His is a masterful performance, maintaining an exquisite balance between playful humor and force of will.
999;That said, I think that Cosmatos, his cast, and crew have created 135 minutes of generally entertaining, sometimes hilarious, and often thought.
1000;In any event, I enjoyed it.
1001;One of my all time favorite westerns.
1002;George P. Cosmatos directed what is the best and most historically accurate version of the legendary story of theEarpps and the fight at the O. k. corall.
1003;other versions havebeen to clean to peaceful to at often times see the brutalways of the wild west and this historic gunfight but withan all star cast with brillant perfomances by Kurt Russell,Val Kilmer( wich this by far is still his best perfomanceof his career),Sam Elliot,and Bill Paxton makes this thebest film version by far of legendary Tombstone.
1004;Tombstone is an important credit for not only moviemaking but also for the western genre.
1005;The film evolves around the story of the Earp brothers, facing their enemies .
1006;the Clanton's, the cowboys, and Wyatt Earp's(Kurt Russell] friendship with the once upon a time Dentist, Doc Holliday, played out brilliantly by Val Kilmer.
1007;This movie is partly truth and part fiction and is also true to realistic, portraying a symbol of the old west like no other, revealing what it takes to survive in the hard times of the wild frontier, and what it takes to gain one's respect with a muzzle of a bad .44.
1008;There are several new scenes added into the film that makes the movie as a whole more interesting and in.
1009;the plot is perfectly constructed and is next to flawless.
1010;the performances are magnificent!Kurt Russell Makes the perfect Wyatt Earp and is totally believable in the role of the famous western lawman.
1011;west sheriff and is very good at playing Wyatt Earp's brother.
1012;bill Paxton in an interesting change of role is cast as another of Wyatt's brothers and is most interesting in the role and pulls it off extremely well.
1013;His accent is so believable it's amazing to think that it's put on!
1014;when viewing one of his other performances, say, his Bruce Wayne character in 'Batman Forever', released the same year as Tombstone, it's amazing to think that this is the same Val Kilmer that played Doc Holliday in Tombstone.
1015;He surely deserves to be a more well known presence on the screen.
1016;All in all this is a powerful tale of friendship and justice that should be treasured among the best westerns, in fact, Tombstone is The Best Western ever to grace the screen!
1017;This directors cut made a great movie even better.
1018;This film is played everywhere there.
1019;One of our favorite movies of all time.
1020;this movie is excellent, if it doesn't make you want to be a cowboy nothing will, excellent story line as well as gun play.
1021;So both of these films appealed greatly to me.
1022;tombstone is in many ways the classic western, bright(read Technicolor), loaded with plenty of humor, plenty of action, and several big name stars.
1023;all of the acting is very good here with the performers obviously having fun Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday is by far the most memorable performance.
1024;While many will hail Quaids as much more realistic ( and I believe this is probably true), Kilmers certainly had an edge of realism but at the same time was very entertaining.
1025;this brings us to the most argued point, Wyatt Earp himself.
1026;i say saddle this one up and enjoy.
1027;Doc is played by Val Kilmer and is wonderful.
1028;My wish was that this movie had come out before the passing of my Daddy for he loved a good western.
1029;Sharon is my name and I am a grown woman with the love of a little girl still deep inside of my heart for my hero who was my Daddy.
1030;This is the hubby's favorite western!
1031;I bought it for him as a gift.
1032;I can watch it many times, it's that good!
1033;This film should stand the test of time and become a true western classic .
1034;Kurt Russell also turns in a great performance in the lead role as Wyatt Earp.
1035;Russell did not garner as much praise for his part as Kilmer did, but we should keep in mind that Kilmer's character was given a lot of clever and witty lines to deliver, while Russell's was more serious.
1036;Together with a great supporting cast including Sam Elliot as Virgil Earp and Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp, you really feel as though you got to know the characters.
1037;wyatt earp is one of my favorite historical figures.
1038;having read the biography and seen the pictures of the real life people, i love this movie.
1039;the love story, the cowboy fights and shootouts, the action and the scenery.
1040;kurt russell and val kilmer give their best performances
1041;and as for the movie itself, superb picture and sound bring to life the best western movie produced in the last 20 years, and maybe ever made.
1042;Its a timeless tale that once you've seen, you want to see again.
1043;Its a truly entertaining and moving story at the same time.
1044;That being said, this is definitely one of those movies that I was happy to see finally released on Blu.
1045;I also feel the need to say that of the two movies that were released Coincidentally within the same time.
1046;ray standpoint I enjoyed the crisp detail and in contrast to another review felt that the Audio sounded great.
1047;tHE MOVIE and CASTING:As far as the movie and the story, this well so well cast that I was surprised that it didn't win just a ton of awards.
1048;This along with a cameo appearance of Charlton Heston and the remaining cast of Sam Elliot, Dana Delany, and Bill Paxton just to name a few recreated a legend that will forever mark what the Western Frontier and the rewards and sacrifices that came along with it was all about
1049;Besides several historical inacuuracies TOMBSTONE delivers.
1050;Memorable quotes abound in the movie.
1051;This is one of, if not the best western I have ever seen.
1052;Amazon lists it along with its pricing .
1053;Still a great movie in whatever format , its one of the last great westerns of the 20th century .
1054;Awesome cast good Director , cant beat that !
1055;Its very accurate to the stories I've read on Wyatt Earp an his brothers and Doc Holliday in their adventure in the boom town of Tombstone.
1056;Amazing cast ,acting ,portrayal of events and it gives that escape from reality to the old western days.
1057;up between Val Kilmer's Doc Holiday and Dennis Quaid's, both actors gave extraordinary performances.
1058;In spite of my critical observations, I love both movies and have watched each of them several times.
1059;I have long felt that this was one of the greatest westerns ever made, an incredibly delivered story with amazing acting by all involved.
1060;Yes, Kilmer's Doc Holiday almost steals the movie but, never the less, a wonderful film.
1061;i consider this one of the finest films ever made.
1062;Tombstone is one of the greatest stories ever told on film.
1063;the Blu Ray version has been polished beyond belief making it one of the better conversions I have seen.
1064;Along with spectacular visuals comes a polished audio track that couldn't sound better.
1065;Tombstone is, without a doubt, the best western flick ever made!
1066;Director George P. Cosmatos stages epic gunfight scenes and gives the well.
1067;known story a dark edge.
1068;But the film is mostly memorable for it's grand cast who put their hearts and souls into their performances: Kurt Russell (Stargate), Val Kilmer (Batman Forever), Michael Biehn (Megiddo: The Omega Code 2), Sam Elliott (Gettysburg, We Were Soldiers), Bill Paxton (Apollo 13, Twister, Titanic), Stephen Lang (Gettysburg, The Amazing Panda Adventure, and the upcoming Gods and Generals), Billy Zane (Titanic, The Phantom), and a short turn.
1069;Okay, for one, this is my favorite movie.
1070;For two the director's cut gives you the coolest deleted scenes and angles.
1071;I can not tell you everything but it is fantastic.
1072;Very well done and it will always be at the top of my collection.
1073;I had seen this movie at the theater and watch it every time it came on TV that I could .
1074;it is an awesome account of Wyatt Earp his brothers and Val Kilmer is the best Doc Holiday I have ever seen !
1075;He read his statement, in a calm and controlled manner, which detailed the troubles between the two groups, how they only wanted to disarm the men and that they had to fire in self.
1076;wyatt Earp had been friends with notable Wild West figures such as Wild Bill Hickcock and Bat Masterson.
1077;As well as western movie stars such as Tom Mix, William S Hart and even a young John Wayne.
1078;Biehn portrays Johnny Ringo, an educated man who Holliday calls the deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, and a wonderful foil for Kilmer to play off.Yet by picking out those I don't want you to think that the others aren't as good, the entire cast is amazing, without exception this film should have been award winning .
1079;this is a well made, well acted, and exceptionally underrated film .
1080;it is what a true western should be.
1081;You made it so easy to look for it , find it , and order it on time to get here!
1082;Keep up the good work!
1083;As the back of package says, this is one of the 5 greatest Westerns ever made.
1084;Probably most of those who love this movie say the same.
1085;The interaction between Doc and Johnny Ringo is worth watching besides Wyatt Earp's reputation.
1086;This movie is great for everybody: from casual watchers to hard.
1087;Like watching a new movie.
1088;Highly recommended for any Tombstone fan.
1089;I will say that 'TOMBSTONE', could be one of the best Westerns ever made.
1090;The ending is great, when Doc, and Dana Delaney, state that they will now rely on room service
1091;For the reviewer who stated that there are chick movies and guy movies and this is a *guy* movie, may I say, I'm a chick and Tombstone is one of my favorite movies.
1092;the excellent casting makes this film, and Val Kilmer stands out as the strongest attraction with his depth of range in his handling of the role of the complicated Doc Holiday.
1093;His work with the Doc role somewhat reminds me of the great work Marlon Brando did as the regulator in The Missouri Breaks ( another favorite).
1094;The story of the Earp's, the Clanton's and Tombstone is a legend of the old west.
1095;It is the performances in this movie that make it shine.
1096;An instant classic that all future westerns will be judged against.
1097;a star studded cast was brought together for this movie including Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Powers Booth, Dana Delany, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn, Jason Priestley, Billy Zane and Charlton Heston.
1098;The camera angles, the cinematography and the dialogue are exceptional.
1099;Sit back and enjoy the legend of the Earp's and Doc Holliday.
1100;In my humble opinion, Tombstone is one of the best westerns made.
1101;I was looking for movie entertainment at it's hyperbolic best.
1102;I loved the portrayal of Curly Bill in Tombstone, just capital.
1103;This is western mythology and story telling at its best.
1104;A factual history lesson, no
1105;This is not the deepest movie I have ever seen, which is the reason it is the best western I have ever seen.
1106;There are chick flicks, and there are guy flicks, and this one is both.
1107;My wife thought the guys were hot, and I thought the action was great.
1108;don't get me wrong, Clint Eastwod westerns are good, John Wayne is good, but this movie was one we both thoroughly enjoyed.
1109;One reason that I really enjoy Blu.
1110;ray releases is that they're generally aimed at a film aficionado who wants the best video and audio presentation possible .
1111;ray theatrical cut because of the high marks it got (and that makes the Mouse happy!)
1112;and/or keep the extended version of the film.
1113;After loving this movie for so long (probably Val Kilmers best role) I was very excited to see it re.
1114;Some of the features are better than others.
1115;The Epitaph while not an exciting piece is also interesting to read the real newspaper account from way back when it actually happened.
1116;And to see the ads in the paper was cool too.
1117;There is a ROM game, which is a lot of fun, and re.
1118;playable which is always a plus in my humble opinion.
1119;There are a ton of trailers and while they don't interest me too much it is interesting to see how many ways a movie can be spun.
1120;kudos and thumbs up on the new version and the cool bonus.
1121;Many people consider this to be one of the greatest westerns of all time.
1122;Val Kilmer was fun to watch, as was Michael Biehn.
1123;They don't get any better than this if you love westerns, adventures, period movies, well you name it.
1124;The Cowboy gang holds a stranglehold on the town that cannot be broken.
1125;An impressive cast, excellent action, and even some humor makes this western fully enjoyable.
1126;while Kurt Russell is excellent as Marshal Wyatt Earp, Val Kilmer steals the show as dying gunman Doc Holliday.
1127;His performance is truly great and should have earned him an Academy Award for his performance.
1128;The relationship between the two men is fully believable and one of the better points of the movie.
1129;Michael Biehn and Powers Boothe are also excellent as Johnny Ringo and Curley Bill, the leaders of the Cowboy gang.
1130;The best may be the deleted scenes that are included.
1131;At times during the movie, it seems a bit choppy with editing, but the movie is still very good.
1132;For fans of westerns check out this action.
1133;A powerful cast is essential for a great Western, and you couldn't find a better group of actors as the Earp brothers.
1134;This is a thrill ride for anyone who loves westerns.
1135;TOMBSTONE is a truly a superior movie.
1136;the director's cut is so much better.
1137;i mean it is really amazing the difference from the original release.
1138;IMO Val Kilmer's best movie.
1139;Having read three biographies of Wyatt Earp and having seen four Earp movies, I can honestly attest that Tombstone is without a doubt the best.
1140;The point is Tombstone is one rockin' western, and it is without a doubt the best of any of the Earp movies.
1141;And what a story it is.
1142;kurt Russell reaches his acting apex with this role.
1143;He commands the screen and stands tall.
1144;Kilmer's Doc Holliday is Oscar worthy, and how he was over.
1145;Sam Elliot as Virgil Earp and Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp complete the Earp family and hand in fine performances, as well.
1146;Powers Boothe hands in a positively and hatefully fine performance as Curley Bill, Stephen Lang as a cohort, and Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo round out the bad guys with the red sashes.
1147;Easily the best of the Earp movies.
1148;Tombstone was probably one of the best westerns I have ever seen.
1149;Every one played their parts to the tee.
1150;This has to be Val Kilmer's best performance to date.
1151;he brought Doc Holiday back to life!
1152;The storyline was practically flawless as were the acting, scenery and direction.
1153;Probably happened 20 times during the movie.
1154;This somewhat cult classic has attained its status for a few reasons.
1155;Firstly, Val Kilmer is excellent as Doc Holliday.
1156;His performance is extremely entertaining and will no doubt stick with the viewer for years.
1157;Kilmer's Holliday delivers countless classic lines and a few memorable moments such as his cup swinging antics in response to one of the film's bad guys.
1158;kurt Russell and the rest of the cast also deliver good performances in this film which centers around Wyatt Earp and the town of Tombstone.
1159;While this movie may not be histroically accurate, it is one of the best action films of the 90's and very much worth a viewing.
1160;I bought both Tombstone and Wyatt Earp , they both have something to add to to this epic story base on real people and historic events of American history in the time of the old west.
1161;This kind of movie gives me insight and great respect for those who were brave enough to face the adversities and misfortune of an untamed frontier riddled with lawlessness.
1162;Through all that life could deal out Wyatt Earp managed to find himself with respect and honor and being truly blessed in the end, wins the hearts of many.
1163;I highly respect and would have been honored to know the man.
1164;This story was long over due to be made with modern film techniques that really bring the story to life while still making one wonder.
1165;and so, the erstwhile lovers of home theater and this film in particular, which should be reference material right next to Saving Private Ryan, Jurassic Park and other 90s pheoms, waited and waited, and waited some more.
1166;The Director's Cut (Vista Series), a very nice transfer, a DTS 5.1 mix, a lot of nice goodies and all was well with the world.
1167;tHE GOODThis is the best video transfer yet of this film.
1168;It's a gorgeous 2.35:1 AVC transfer.
1169;It retains the grain of the original but otherwise this print is pristine.
1170;The colors snap and are vibrant, it's devoid of any artifacts and despite closing in on 20 years this film holds up well and is visually spectacular.
1171;mA soundtrack sounds great, not jaw dropping but great.
1172;mA It sounds good though and you won't be disappointed.
1173;One reason usually: to sell the deluxe edition Blu.
1174;It's easily one of the best westerns ever made and I'm talking right up there with John Ford and the rest.
1175;This is a superb flim with an all.
1176;It's also got more one.
1177;Kilmer as Doc Holiday is one of my favorite characters in movies.
1178;so why the four stars and ominous heading.
1179;I mean, it has commentary and extra scenes. . . I could die and be happy.
1180;well, I'm alive. . . very much alive.
1181;Aside from this being an excellent western adventure film it's a true story, which many people forget.
1182;The main actors are fantastic as is the supporting cast.
1183;Being an old west history buff, I can say the costuming is some of the best replication of 1880's style that I've seen in films.
1184;For someone who has studied these events before this movie was ever produced, it was quite refreshing to see the accuracy.
1185;This is an exceptional film about the life of an exceptional man, Wyatt Earp.
1186;There is a lot to like.
1187;It is lovingly crafted, superbly cast and acted, gorgeously photographed, and meticulously costumed .
1188;Nobody knows who killed John Ringo .
1189;One reviewer commented that Doc staring at his feet in the This is funny sequence had to do with seeing a light before you died.
1190;And he laughs at the irony of it, and says This is funny.7.
1191;to hip up the imagery and maybe help box office sales.
1192;historical inaccuracies aside, this movie is wondrous.
1193;Powers Booth is wonderful as Bill Brocious, Michael Biehn is superb as Ringo (the In Vino Veritas scene is a riot).
1194;Sam Elliott is just wonderful old Sam Elliott.
1195;Kurt Russell LOOKS like Wyatt Earp (more than any other actor ever to essay the role) and Kilmer is just The Cat's Meow as Holliday (Dennis Quaid doesa great version in the Costner flick, as well.
1196;The movie just flows and you hate to see it end.
1197;It is a real jewel.
1198;This is the best depiction of the events leading up to and following the most brazen gunfight in the Old West .
