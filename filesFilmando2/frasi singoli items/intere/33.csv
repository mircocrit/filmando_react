1;The pianist is a wonderfully made movie!
2;It is a movie that has touched my heart very closely that speaks about the humanity in people and also shows the world what the results of hatred are.
3;The Pianist is a good film, but not great.
4;I don't understand why this was such a big winner at the Oscars!
5;Plus, Marshall choreographed all the numbers!
6;Plus the editing was smooth and well done.
7;Charlie Kauffman had the Oscar stolen from him for best screenplay: adapted material.
8;Every scene and line in Adaptation shines with creative characters and brilliant words.
9;Actually, the movie's main showcase is the writting, because it is SO GOOD!
10;that being said, I thought that The Pianist was definetly one of the better films over the past year.
11;This movie will resonate with you weeks after it is finished.
12;Great acting and what a marvelous story.
13;The Pianist is a great film and it is even cooler to know that it was directed by someone who is a survivor of world war II who lost almost his whole family.
14;Adrien Brody played the part so well throughout the whole movie, The struggles he went through just in order to survive even though his entire family might be dead, he stayed alive because of the love of music.
15;The Pianist portrays WWII really well, the only movie in my opinion that comes close to this film is shindlers list, also a great film.
16;If you have heard good things about this film than it is because it is a spectacular film, an instant classic in my library.
17;I have actually never seen this movie, I bought it for my sister so that she could give it to her husband for christmas, but it is one of his favorite movies, so according to him its really good.
18;This true story is based on a man who was there.
19;It's a fantastic movie, not only for message, but for cinematography, acting, wardrobe, directing and, of course, Poland's greatest composer, Chopin.
20;"Chopin's music, again, and again, has kept the spirit of the Polish people going and going, through ""all"" of Poland's war's."
21;"Chopin piano pieces
I:205;22;He is finally caught by a German Captain, Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann), but instead of killing him, the Captain gives him food and helps him stay alive until the Russians are able to free the city.
I:205;23;my Comments:The movie really is pretty remarkable.
I:205;24;I don't know that you can critique a movie like this without, in a sense, criticizing what happened, but I'll do my best.
I:205;25;There are three things that, in my opinion, make this movie great.
I:205;26;First, the cinematography and sets are stunning.
I:205;27;a buzzing with everything else blocked out"
28;Third, Adrien Brody was pretty good.
29;Considering how well these two stories have done over the years, combining them is bound to be an exceptional story.
30;overall, the movie is very powerful.
31;"He was pretty good
I:205;32;He finds a refuge with friends.
I:205;33;Wladek finds a new refuge.
I:205;34;'Spielman' is a good name for a pianist."""""""
35;It is educational as any true story can be.
36;After the Caesars came to power they also disarmed the Romans, and you can find other examples in history.
37;It is heartbreaking to see a people enduring genocide.
38;That is a good name, for a pianist.
39;The movie is certainly long enough to bear few minutes more, especially when these are concerned with one of Chopin's finest works and such poignant and haunting images like the ruined Warsaw.
40;At least the Polonaise Brilliante in the end is quite complete and it makes by far the greatest end credits I can imagine.
41;The Pianist is the true story of a Polish Jewish pianist named Szpielman, who had a bright future ahead of him .
42;the story is beyond inspirational, there is truly something to be learned from it.
43;It is the triumph of a man in the face of great adversity.
44;The movie itself provides a distinct, unique viewpoint of the environment and events in Warsaw during the war, with great pictoral effect as well as accuracy.
45;The acting is also superb, particularly with Adrien Brody as Szpielman.
46;truly a great film and an amazing story.
47;there are some very good aspects of the movie.
48;"The movie The Pianist"" is a moving and beautiful piece that truly deserves better treatment than this unfortunate 'cash grab' by TVA Films."
49;Well I think my title summed it up!
50;I am a very big history buff, and love anything to do with World War 2.
51;as long as it is a true story!
52;I was totally impressed with Adrien Brody!!!
53;It takes you on a very emotional journey of life hope love and faith!
54;"The saying goes that ""A picture is worth a thousand words""."
55;if that is the case, than this film is worth millions of them.
56;brody is exquisite as Szpilman, taking on the burden forced on the musician by the oppressing Nazi invaders.
57;The acting, the story, the directing, all excellent.
58;I actually bought the movie so I can watch it any time on my laptop.
59;This true story is a must see.
60;"mighty power of France was occupied, and many of them acted as the Poles and gave away their Jews with pleasure
I:205;61;brody's acting is perfectly suited for the role, and there could not have been any better director than Roman Polanski telling this story.
I:205;62;All the other details of the film are exquisite, and the screenplay, as an adaption of the book (which I haven't read), is masterful and treated with the realism that only a skilled writer could evoke by research and contact with those who were there.
I:205;63;Naturally Roman Polanski's own Holocaust survival plays an important contribution to the story, and the little details he adds.
I:205;64;the film is a huge undertaking and is unbelievably sobering.
I:205;65;It is important to understand the enemy, to not appease with relative morality and pontification.
I:205;66;The message of art and hope and peace and good people on all sides, even German, is not lost on me.
I:205;67;But the distinction that should be made clear on this subject is that the atrocity and inhumanity of the period is the core of the event and the film's message of hope and individual survival is the heart of this story.
I:205;68;a beautiful story at that.
I:205;69;Not everyone was strong enough or lucky enough to survive, so the story of hope is important, but understanding the bigger picture is paramount.
I:205;70;This is Roman Polanksi's masterpiece and it is so much more than a film because it is based on real life.
I:205;71;It is absolutely unforgettable"
72;I was glued to my seat.
73;It was written just after the event, so the memories depicted are fresh.
74;the bonus menu is also strong.
75;A welcomed addition to my History films.
76;I also recommend: Schedulers' List and Enemy at the Gate.
77;"Early on in this film, I thought to myself: ""Just another holocaust film."
78;the key to this movie is the utter helplessness and claustrophobia of its protagonist.
79;I am always moved by holocaust stories, but some are better told than others.
80;This is a very well performed script based on a true story.
81;It is VERY well done.
82;`The Pianist' is one of those films that stays with you long over you've watched it.
83;In fact, I haven't seen the film for roughly eight years or so and yet I still remember it remarkably well.
84;The triumph of the human spirit and the will to survive is rarely portrayed with such earnestness and raw honesty.
85;it's heavy, that's for sure.
86;This singular tale is really a universal story of triumph in the face of adversity and shows that dwelling in each and every one of us is the power and strength of overcome and prevail regardless of the perils in front of us.
87;beautifully acted and directed, both Brody and Polanski earned those Oscars.
88;Brody is phenomenal as the tortured Szpilman.
89;He ages remarkably with the time, allowing the true nature of his situation to impact his every being as the film progresses.
90;It has heart and soul but it maintains a grit that allows it to speak volumes with an honest interpretation of one of the most heartless times in human history.
91;A blend of art and reality which makes this movies one of its kind.
92;It made a real impact on the kids.
93;this is a great movie, and well done.
94;I love Chopin whose music is featured.
95;So many poignant scenes, and have watched many times.
96;We love these stories based on truth.
97;This was so interesting to see the struggle of this man during WWII That is why we so enjoyed Enemy at the Gate as well as Definace.
98;Defionace probably our very favorite story as it was based on a true story of Jews in Germany during WWII.
99;These are survival stories and we love them.
100;"He got separated from his family
I:205;101;however,I truly enjoyed this movie even though I don't usually watch movies that lasts more than two hours because almost every scene in this movie was quite riveting !!!!!
I:205;102;I agree with much of what was said by other reviewers.
I:205;103;The movie was moving and quite good.
I:205;104;His performance was fine but far from extraordinary.
I:205;105;His character is passive throughout most of the movie and registers few emotions .
I:205;106;It is unfortunate that the excellent performance of the Pianist is shown along with the end titles.
I:205;107;I recommend Life is beautiful more than this.
I:205;108;A sensitive dealing with the WWII is combined with the development of the protagonist, our pianist friend.
I:205;109;And it even has a message for us here in comfy cozy USA, of 2008.
I:205;110;Man you should see it!
I:205;111;This film should have won the best picture Oscar for its year.
I:205;112;This is one of the most absorbing films I have seen .
I:205;113;Polanski is at his finest and Adrien Brody is first.
I:205;114;I honestly can think of no other film that held me for its entire length without letting go.
I:205;115;A triumph for everyone involved and a wonderful film for us to watch.
I:205;116;When I finished watching this movie I was pretty much speechless.
I:205;117;This is a movie that, I think, everyone should see.
I:205;118;I found myself comparing The Pianist to Schindler's List quite a bit.
I:205;119;In the end though, I prefer The Pianist because it seemed more real.
I:205;120;This is truly a movie that must be seen.
I:205;121;This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
I:205;122;This has to be one of the very best Holocaust films ever made not just because of Polanski's talents but his sensibility as a Holocaust survivor.
I:205;123;The film based on Wadyslaw Szpilman's life tells a story of the survival of the human spirit in extreme adversity and his encounter with a German Officer Wilhelm Hosenfeld who helped him in his hiding.
I:205;124;Polanski sums it all up in his interview saying """"."""
125;charming, intelligent and delightful people and really nice people and that was a shock to me.
126;and I come to the realisation that anyone is capable of anything, at a given time in history.
127;the audience will walk away with the lasting emotion.
128;and identify with the victims of that period and I hope that this film may somehow contribute to the efforts of those who don't want this type of scenario re.
129;"This is a brilliant and extraordinary film which earns the well deserved Oscars for Polanski (Best Director)
I:205;130;A movie that makes you feel like you are realy living in 1940's poland because everything seems and feels authentic.
I:205;131;If you are a history buff, or one that questions what actually happened during WWII, perhaps this film will help you get a clearer picture of what actually happened (yes I know this is just a movie, but it is based on a person's real life experiences).
I:205;132;I recommend that everyone see this movie.
I:205;133;One of the most magical aspects of movie making can be found in the rare occasion when such a dramatization of a best.
I:205;134;selling book results in an equally spellbinding film.
I:205;135;Given Mr. Polanski's personal experience as a Holocaust survivor, he has an exceptionally well.
I:205;136;In so doing he has created a modern masterpiece along the lines of such similar treatments of the period as Stephen Spielberg's """"Schindler's List""""."""
137;Against such a backdrop of the momentous events transpiring from the German army's invasion of Poland in September of 1939 through the end of the war is the pianist's story so marvelously told.
138;The cinematography is remarkable, with a superb depiction of the massive destruction that modern war brings in its wake.
139;This is a film that belongs in any serious film fan's library, and one I can heartily recommend for all but the youngest viewers.
140;Great historical movie everyone should watch, awesome for family viewing, Schinder's List deserved every award it received.
141;one of the best movies ever made about World War ll
142;i highly recommend this movie.
143;Great movie.2nd viewing but still rivetingReminded me of the feeling when I was reading, A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich .
144;director succeeded in bringing life to each character.
145;key masterpiece, an unusually accurate historical film and deeply stirring human drama that reaches masterful heights without drawing attention to itself.
146;Set in World War II Poland, it focuses on a unique Holocaust aspect and is essential for anyone interested in the terrible era or who simply wants a supremely emotional film.
147;Closely based on his memoirs, The Pianist is one of the most realistic films of its kind, as the documentary segment comparing era footage with the film makes clear.
148;is thoroughly harrowing, a powerfully affecting experience that moves us physically through tears and otherwise.
149;Yet, despite it all, it is a story of hope and optimism.
150;Szpilman is above all a survivor, and the film vividly chronicles his determination to stay alive in spite of the grimmest odds.
151;Thus, though often almost unwatchably bleak, The Pianist is ultimately inspirational, a tribute to the human spirit's power and endurance and an ode to hope amid hopelessness.
152;His determination to tell the story as accurately and simply as possible is key.
153;It is as epic and multi.
154;a lofty goal that many movies strive for but very few achieve.
155;the film is so fundamentally modest in that it takes an effort to recognize its many and substantial accomplishments.
156;The presentation is so stunningly realistic that we nearly forget we are watching a film .
157;the highest praise a historical work or biopic can have.
158;important velvet touch also extends to the acting, especially Adrien Brody's deservedly praised role.
159;His performance is remarkable in that he is onscreen nearly the entire time, often alone, and manages to keep us spellbound without being flashy.
160;, and he succeeds with aplomb.
161;all told, The Pianist is one of the greatest recent films, a brilliant depiction of humanity at both its worst and most enduring.
162;to learn, to remember, to revile, and to admire.
163;Powerfully touching us deep within and leaving us thoroughly moved, it is one of the few truly unforgettable films.
164;this movie was a very touching to watch .
165;it was one of the best i have seen in a while, the 10 year old nephew had many questions about the events, he showed so much interest in this story and he learned things from it.
166;i was pleased to watch it with a kid who showed so much interest.
167;and we also have watched it again loved this movie
168;Wow, what a remarkable piece of film.
169;This movie was gripping from the start.
170;I thought Adrien Brody was amazing.
171;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen and I have seen alot!
172;I seen it for a real good deal (.)
173;This is how the film starts!
174;Well this movie is one that I am happy I just bought because just writing this review makes me want to watch it right now!!!
175;This is a beautiful film and I think Roman Polanski did everything right towards the making and story line of the film.
176;It just has such a heavy atmospheric and emotional feeling when this film is watched and you won't move out of your seat, I guarantee it!
177;A film that could be watched together with Schindler's List, or Annie Frank so that we could have a full picture of the darkest holocust so real and so vivid.
178;there is a lot of justification for Polanski to win an Oscar as the best director and likewise, for the film to win the Gold Palm Award.
179;however, an average viewer should be able to find the the music appealing enough and should be able to finish the whole film in one breath rather impressed, or even stunned.
180;This movie was one of the best that I have ever seen.
181;I would recommend it to anybody, and everybody
182;Mass murder will always evoke tears, and when it's incorporated through a poignant story about WWII brought to life by a classic director, the film is an immediate Oscar candidate.
183;luckily, Adrien Brody's silent, touching performance saves the film .
184;this film recreates the survival of a brilliant concert pianist who is subjected to the terrors of Nazi occupation.
185;That survival depended on his own wits, a great deal of luck, the kindness of many benefactors, and even the compassion of an enemy officer.
186;It also made us count our blessings!
187;i would recommend it to anyone interested in the phenomenon of survivorship or who just wants to see a positive, thoughtful, and decent movie.
188;It was a great movie overall and i'd suggest it to anyone that wants to see a good WWII holocaust movie.
189;If anything, Polanski demonstrates that true vision knows no bounds.
190;Quickly I became endeared to the character and found myself pulling for his survival as if it was really taking place.
191;For a movie to pull this off requires an amazing vision and a successful unfurling of that vision and all its detail.
192;what is so profound about this film is the degree to which the viewer becomes transmogrified through the course of following the central character in his determination to survive.
193;this movie captures the fundamental human feelings that ultimately pull us all together.
194;"more than another ""war movie,"" this film transcends genres and moves into the realm of greatness."
195;Whatever you think of Polanski the man, this film is brilliant.
196;The Pianist is a true story about a Jewish pianist in Poland during World War II who manages to survive the horrors of the Nazis.
197;Nazis take delight in bullying the Jews.
198;He manages to stay behind, but his tortures don't end there.
199;I will, say, however, that the story is brilliant.
200;"The actors do a wonderful job of making the movie seem extremely real
I:205;201;I found each and every part of this movie horrifying, but at the same time, very moving and interesting.
I:205;202;This movie is definitely one of the best I've seen.
I:205;203;Winner of three Academy Awards, and nominated for four others including Best Picture, The Pianist is one of the best films of the decade.
I:205;204;Set against the backdrop of an amazingly beautiful soundtrack featuring such classical composers as Chopin and Beethoven, The Pianist ingeniously illustrates the struggle of one man to maintain his dignity and his connection with civilization in the face of a personal hell on earth and some of greatest crimes in human history.
I:205;205;actor Adrien Brody turns in a brilliant performance as Wladyslaw Szpilman, a piano player of immense genius in 1930s Poland.
I:205;206;Szpilman and his family enjoy a life of relative wealth and comfort as part of the cultured and educated European social elite.
I:205;207;szpilman must live his life the best he can while Warsaw is fenced in with brick walls, and its Jewish citizens are singled out and driven through checkpoints like cattle.
I:205;208;based on the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, one the most accomplished piano players in all of Europe prior to the advance of the Nazi regime, The Pianist is a masterpiece on the big screen.
I:205;209;The wondrous music and its compelling beauty stand in stark contrast to the horrors of war.
I:205;210;Brody is more than deserving of his Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Ronald Harwood's screenplay is simply masterful.
I:205;211;The precision with which this film tells its story, coupled with its intimate portrayal of the human condition, makes The Pianist one of the greatest films of all time and a definite must.
I:205;212;see for anyone who harbors a love of artistry and cinema.
I:205;213;Musician, classical music lover, lover of well.
I:205;214;fiction books and recordings and those who seek a true understanding of WW II's toll on humanity: for these people, this is a must.
I:205;215;Helped in the end by a compassionate German officer who discovered him and heard him play, the pianist survived and lived to play on the stage again.
I:205;216;Looking forward to watching it again as I enjoyed the movie when it came out.
I:205;217;A great addition to any movie watchers collection.
I:205;218;This wonderful film is a true story and I say that even though it is about 8 years old, I say it rates in the top 5 war movies of all time.
I:205;219;This is the most moving film I have ever seen.
I:205;220;It is comparative to Schindler's List in scale and scope, but where Steven Spielberg focuses on a German, a man that finds his morality during the holocaust, Roman Polanski centers on a victim.
I:205;221;adrien Brody protrays Szpielman, pianist and composer, with brilliance and subtlety.
I:205;222;The movie hits a climax with one scene, one heartrending scene, that those who've witnessed it will recognize and those who haven't must see.
I:205;223;A spectacular look at the cruelty of the Jewish holocaust of WW2 and how the power of art can transcend war and politics.
I:205;224;An uncle was a professional artist.
I:205;225;so I can say, from experence, that The Pianist is fantastic!!
I:205;226;Anyone who loves music of any.
I:205;227;This movie is really an exquisite piece.
I:205;228;For those of you out there interested in recent history and who appreciate it being told to you in the most vivid and understanding way, will love """"The Pianist""""."""
229;i do recommend everyone to sit down and watch this movie as it is both entertaing and enlightening to the fact that something like this should never be repeated.
230;roman Polanski, who took aspects of his life as well as documentary footage to make a film that encapulates Warsaw in the 1940's.
231;I enjoyed the movie much better when Szpilman was one his own.
232;the movie works better when Szpilman is on his own.
233;Adrien Brody does an amazing job of changing the once confident pianist to a quivering, fearful bum.
234;It is a tragedy what happens to such a talent and you see his passion for the piano in the soulful face of Brody, who captures his essense so well.
235;Adrien Brody is definitely at his best in this movie.
236;I love Brody, and after this movie, I declare that I have now found my lifetime obsession.
237;He became one with the character by ridding himself of earthly possessions and disconnecting himself with family and friends.
238;He got in touch with the true feelings of loneliness and despair.
239;Many scenes were of himself, by himself, where the actor is put to the greatest test.
240;He pulls his audience in with expressions, his body language, and he intrigues the audience with his talents.
241;This is an incredible challenge because there are no distractions to muddle up these scenes where he is by himself.
242;Brody expresses a musician's passion, an artist's love for music, as he fantasizes about playing piano when he should not.
243;It is evident in his performance that it is the passion for music that saved Szpilman's life.
244;It kept him moving through the harshest moments in his life, and ultimately draws out the beauty in the beast of a German Nazi soldier.
245;the movie is incredibly done with a symmetry of the beginning and ending.
246;The noncommercialization of this extraordinary film and Brody's win of the academy award proves that this movie is one of the best movies ever made.
247;I had to see this movie at a bizarre time of day and it was well worth the effort.
248;This is just a beautiful piece of work.
249;Adrien Brody's performance is wonderful.
250;He conveys such depths of emotion with a simple glance.
251;I usually do not like Holocaust movies but I really enjoyed this one.
252;Award winning film that is even more enjoyable for anyone with a basic knowledge of World War II, Polish, or holocaust history.
253;I loved this movie so much on TV when I saw it that I had to order it and tell friends about it.
254;This mans fortitude and desire to survive are amazing and the fact that he did can only be attributed to God.
255;The Pianist is based on a true story about the survival of a Jewish classical pianist trying to survive the Nazi holocaust during WWII.
256;It is a heartwrenching tale of a man who lost his family and his love of music, but managed to survive with the help of others.
257;the Pianist is one of those rare films to come out that really examines the many human emotions that we come through each day, and what better way to have an emotionally.
258;The dates and the portrayal of the experiences that happened at those times were right on the money.
259;It was also surprising to see that this film was brutally violent.
260;director Roman Polanski who (if I'm not mistaken) experienced the War, did an Amazing job in his direction.
261;Adrien Brody is Great, with his Oscar win truly deserving and the Adaptation of the Screenplay, by Ronald Harwood, was prestine, given that the memoir written by Wladyslaw Szpilman was written more like a journal, therefore having to write in the dialogue with what was going on in Szpilman's experience though the War.
262;based on a true story, The Pianist, is truely a film to be experienced.
263;This is a great movie based on real life events in a muscian's life and how he became a survivor.
264;We, as a family, loved it since we are musicians and know how music within can pull a person through life's challenges.
265;The historical value is so important as well.
266;The movie pulls you in and takes you for a ride.
267;It is an emotional roller coaster, taking you from one end of the spectrum to the other.
268;The heroism and pettiness of the characters is truly moving.
269;I was astounded by the historical detail of this film.
270;This is a great movie that I would not miss.
271;"film follows [the pianist's] journey of survival with the unlikely help of a sympathetic German officer""."
272;"The images are highly disturbing almost right from the very start, and that was the intention of Roman Polanski, who won the Academy Award for Best Director, for whom this movie was said to be ""his most personal"" on account of his own memories of war."
273;English actors Frank Finlay, Emilia Fox and Maureen Lipman co. star with Brody and give sterling performances.
274;It was the way it was performed that was utterly believable.
275;This inhuman capacity that some Human beings have is shown brilliantly in this movie.
276;It is the human dimension that makes this movie special.
277;a very nice and very believable scene is placed at the end when Szpilman was saved by a German officer who eventually dies in a Soviet concentration camp.
278;A beautiful documentAtion of the human spirit amongst the degenErative conditions of the Versailles treaty which creates and created poverty and fascism in WWII (AdrIan Brody, a forced assault KIsser, does well herE.
279;It sHows the beauty and the courage of both the GerMan and JewisH oneS.
280;Here, Roman Polanski directs a story that takes place throughout World War II through the eyes of a Polish man and his love for the piano.
281;in today's era of overblown movies without substance like Legally Blonde or really expensive but good films like Matrix Reloaded, it's about time a film came out of Hollywood with a gripping story and human characters, rather than a big green Shrek reject.
282;He makes a daring escape when the Russians invade.
283;this story is true, and completey acurate, so acurate it's scary.
284;This film was totally compelling and memorable, impressive in its scope of emotion and story.
285;His incredible talent as a musician was a theme carried throughout the film as was the support of the Polish people who knew of his gift and made great effort to find sanctuary for him as the story progressed.
286;The quick shipping, the excellent protective packaging, the price and the movie itself!
287;This film is an extremely moving depiction by Adrien Brody of the true story of accomplished pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman and his powerful,inspiring determination to survive the horrors of the Nazi occupation of Poland during World War II.
288;Anyway, good movie worth watching but it is a war movie afterall.
289;I see dozens of movies each year.
290;day living of it than through this film.
291;His experience informs each moment of this film and takes the viewer right into the streets and the alleys of late 1930's, early1940's Poland.
292;That's the beauty of this movie: surreal horror is incorporated into everyday lives.
293;the film then traces the descent of Brody and his family from their beautiful aparment in the city, into a smaller one in the ghetto, into the waiting area for a concentration camp.
294;i would highly recommend this movie to individuals who appreciate serious, intelligent moviemaking on profound themes.
295;This movie achieves a soul searing impact not through hand.
296;wringing dramatic scenes but through subtle and at times silent small moments.
297;Of course this is a wonderful movie.
298;Very intense and more so because it is based on a true story.
299;The music is beautiful in the movie too.
300;I will admit that up front, so when I heard they were making a movie about the Warsaw Ghetto during WW2 I nearly jumped out of my seat.
301;After the war ends, he continues playing the piano on a grand scale, and lives all the way until his death a few years ago in 2000.
302;What makes this story so great is that it is true, it really happened.
303;It is a very sobering experience to watch this movie.
304;If anyone has seen Schindler's List, you will understand.
305;I strongly recommend this movie to people who want to appreciate the efforts of people involved in WW2.
306;This is an outstanding film from top to bottom.
307;From Roman Polanski's direction the Ron Harwood's brilliant adaptation of Szpilman's book, to an incredible cast .
308;breakingly brilliant performance of Adrien Brody, this is arguably one of the best films ever made about World War II and/or the Holocaust.
309;and the 2003 Best Actor Oscar that he deservedly won for it .
310;His performance is absolutely INCREDIBLE!
311;Hollywood had better take notice.
312;Winner of the Golden Palm, should have taken home the Oscar, `The Pianist' is, in my humble opinion, the best film of 2002.
313;It's one of those films that truly speaks to me on so many levels and resonates with me long after I'm done watching it.
314;Adrien Brody's masterful performance was rightly rewarded during that years Oscar ceremony, as was Roman Polanski's brilliant directing and Ronald Harwood's excellent screenplay.
315;The heart of this film, of course, is found in Adrien's performance, a tour'de'force as they call it.
316;`The Pianist' chronicles Wladyslaw's perilous journey and sheds light on those who helped him along the way, those who put him up, provided for him and even those who left him to die.
317;I disagree for it's a wonderful testament to the will to survive, that will in each and every one of us.
318;An example of this is found when a group of Jews are stopped while they are marching to work.
319;as a side note I wanted to mention that, while he's only in a few minutes of the film, Thomas Kretschmann pulls out such a moving performance towards the end of this epic film.
320;There's one scene in particular when both Brody's and Kretschmann's eyes alone speak volumes.
321;That scene alone carries the emotional crutch of this film, for in Wladyslaw we see this fear and pain as he begins that slowly transforms to this remarkable release and in Hosenfeld we see this admiration and concern that comes over him.
322;shelters, drills,civil defense, and stories of the glories of great war.
323;The reality of the set, and the recent events of september 11, still somehow an illigitimate descendant of the great world war.
324;the same as the last shared meal the family has together while awaiting their yet unknown fate.
325;"we hear plenty of what it was to survive in the camps
I:205;326;and that is the very sensibility that Polanksi injects into this movie throught his characters.
I:205;327;Each one has their own statement about the survival of this particular end of the world.
I:205;328;And by the end, i began to also comprehend that one singular trait mentioned over and over, in survival stories.
I:205;329;there is, the feeling of celebration, more than once, in this movie, of striving to keep alive.
I:205;330;for its genre, it deserves its acclaim.
I:205;331;it very patiently seduces the viewer into this world, and unfolds its secrets with delicacy, and efficacy of details and minutes and hours of the times.
I:205;332;this was a movie best viewed at home, when i could take breaks, from feelings of despair, anger, and hopelessness that set in while viewing it.
I:205;333;The very ability to extract such powerful emotions from within myself, intuited that very sensibility and and wonderful portrayal of this man's life during these years we are given privy to.
I:205;334;Look at this film and it will make you appriciate every breath you take.
I:205;335;I was able to put aside the initial hate disgust and see this masterpiece of filmaking through the eyes of one man's family.
I:205;336;Directed by Roman Polanski, this film recounts the true life story of the Polish Jew and classical pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, and how through sheer luck and gritty determination he survived the Holocaust.
I:205;337;The sticker reads, """"THE PIANIST is a testimony to the power of music , the will to live, and the courage to stand against evil."""""""
338;He has yet to express any remorse for his behavior, and yet he claims the right to call the actions of the Nazis evil and immoral.
339;featuring the most exceptionally gifted actors of their time.
340;The Pianist is among this worthy group, not simply because of its extraordinary impact as a story, but because of its production and value and of those being portrayed.
341;The most amazing thing about this survival story is that it is a true story.
342;Great acting by Brody, and they did an incredible job of recreating a war.
343;I am an admirer of Polanski, and have watched everthing he's made.
344;On the other hand, Polanski is a master filmmaker at the height of his craft, and if he had a story to tell about the Nazi occupation of Poland, I wanted to hear it.
345;"with that in mind, ""The Pianist"" is the story of a young Jewish man's struggle to survive as the Nazi darkness falls across Poland."
346;made Stars of David on the right arm of their clothing.
347;Adrien Brody here is truly masterful: I completely forgot that I was watching an actor on a screen play a role, and became completely absorbed in the character.
348;but there is a catch to his survival, and in it I think Polanski provides an antidote to an otherwise mesmerizing but nihilistic film that seems to whisper about the silence of God in a blindly uncaring, insane universe.
349;And even more remarkably, despite my initial loathing for the character.
350;polanski makes a bold decision in attaching the camera solely to Szpilman, and it is a gambit that pays off handsomely.
351;Particularly surprising is the excellent work by Thomas Kretschmann (an elegant German actor with fine poise who appeared, amazingly, as the Vampire overlord Damaskinos in Blade II), who portrays a German officer who.
352;In a sense, Kretschmann's character serves as the mirror image of the pianist, and puts a fine coda to the film.
353;"And while the film features the most haunting piano works of Beethoven and Chopin, composer Wojciech Kilar (who produced the astounding soundtrack to Polanski's ""The Ninth Gate"") returns with a haunting, moving score that serves the movie well."
354;stay with it: you'll be richly rewarded.
355;It is a bold film, a masterful movie, and a film which I contend again is not strictly a Holocaust piece: it is about survival, and centers on the question of how much of himself a man is willing to surrender in order to survive.
356;I have just witnessed a cinematic masterpiece, a film that is about characters and events, that's lyrical and beautiful and all I can think of after it is how much of a tool Tom Hanks is.
357;It's a really an eerie feeling, but go with me for a little while.
358;Maybe my ranting will begin to make sense.
359;tHE PIANIST is the powerful and lyrical life story of Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrian Brody, Summer of Sam), a Jew living in Poland during World War II.
360;The other takes a more lyrical approach, where a man returns to what he does best.
361;The Pianist takes the lyrical approach and in the end is more successful a story.
362;When he picks it up off the floor he holds onto it for dear life.
363;It's a small moment that is really powerful.
364;He has a friend, he talks to a volleyball.
365;The most dramatic moment in this film is when he losses the Volleyball.
366;This moment is so huge it spoils what should be a moment of discovery for the character.
367;the final moments in THE PIANIST are also small but have strong impact.
368;It's a small intimate moment.
369;cASTAWAY puts the hero right in the middle of a literal crossroads.
370;It kind of diminishes his battle.
371;That's what is great about Brody's performance, he is in every scene of this movie, and fills the screen with a character of depth and strength.
372;it's amazing that I could compare two completely opposite films and explain how one fails and the other one works.
373;One is powerful, the other dull and yet they have two characters that can be very similar.
374;The Pianist is one of the top 10 best films of 2002.
375;It was rightfully nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture, going on to win three: Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay.
376;Its true story of world.
377;famous pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, who struggles for his life during the Holocaust is very powerful, yet brilliant.
378;Such intensity, which is never lost for a second, guarantees an emotional reaction.
379;The immense research of these events is present.
380;The writer's own heart and soul was written in every word.
381;This project was wonderfully led by Roman Polanski's brilliant vision.
382;His directing talents answer why he deserves his legendary status.
383;the set scenery is as accurate to the actual buildings and living conditions of Europe in 1939.1945.
384;The hard work through the construction paid off, adding extra living intensity.
385;The clothing worn in the movie adds the necessary emotional value that keeps audiences watching.
386;All other physical details in this film are also flawless, namely the make.
387;The musical score was composed beautifully, blending perfectly with every scenes' particular mood.
388;the performances from all the actors are beyond words.
389;Adrien Brody beautifully portrays Szpilman in his career.
390;His every drop of heart and soul are obviously presented through his character.
391;This is one of the best Holocaust movie roles in cinema history.
392;His talents prove that he'll be around for many more years.
393;The Pianist is a great movie for entertainment and education.
394;This future classic is sure to please many audiences.
395;"Those looking for more perspectives on the Holocaust should also watch ""Schindler's List"", which offers a more graphic look."
396;this is a great movie about another place in time, concerning a government that was not run by officials who were elected regularly by the people of the country.
397;Very good acting and story, NEVER FORGET.You will enjoy this movie, I have added it ot my collection and will watch more than once.
398;Above all, The Pianist is an excellent film.
399;I waited until after the Oscars to see it.
400;I saw it because I heard so many good things about it and because it won several awards.
401;if you are looking for an expertly crafted film about the survival of a real man in an unimaginable situation, The Pianist fits the bill.
402;I recommend it to anyone who would appreciate an excellent historical drama and a story that captures both the best and worst qualities of mankind.
403;director Roman Polanski tells the familiar horror tale, this time with a concentration on the Jews of Warsaw and in particular on the famed pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman.
404;It is interesting to compare The Pianist with Vittoria De Sica's The Garden of the Finzi.
405;"Better to die fighting than to die like cattle."""
406;"He concludes, ""They are exterminating us."
407;It is here that the film becomes magical and a testament to the best that is in humans.
408;And note that it is his ethereal talent as a great musician that saves him.
409;The best that is in humans can rise above the brute that is in humans.
410;His performance will haunt you.
411;like, almost Spielbergian direction, tells the story a bit too brightly at times, and a bit too simplistically at others, but he has planned well so that in the end we see that he has told it brilliantly.
412;For those who have never actually had the details of the Holocaust acted out for them, this will be quite an eye.
413;And see it because we need to be reminded of what can happen when we give way to hate and prejudice.
414;The storyline is familiar, yet this is a quite interesting version of the Holocaust.
415;"Winner of several Cesars and Oscars for Best Director and Best Actor (Adrian Brody), Polanski's dispassionate tone is just right for this film, never falling into sentimentality the way Spielberg did in ""Schindler's List"" (the only flaw in that Oscar winner) and Brody himself is consumatively excellent in the title role (he stated that he lost weight, his apartment and his girlfriend but kissed Halle Berry!!)"
416;Recommended for all lovers of great cinema!!
417;Beautifully done, cast, crew, locations, story.
418;The director, Roman Polanski though his own personal experiance,really captured Wladyslaw Szpilmans'story of survival and the hope his music gave him to keep going.
419;a truely inspritional film for all humanity.
420;The special features of Polanski talking about his own family experiance though WWII is also an inspiration.
421;This is a movie made out of tears, love and will to survive.
422;what happens to the main character is a perfect example of what can happen to a person who is on the sidelines of a war, someone who is not involved in the fighting but becomes very much involved in the horrors of what war can bring.
423;The acting of Adrien Brody was superb.
424;To pull off the part of going from a clean cut pianist in a higher class society to a sickly scavenger searching for food and water shows the skills and determination of being an excellent actor.
425;the cinematography was also outstanding.
426;The realism of the Jewish holocaust is captured in a truthful yet disturbing way.
427;That's what an excellent movie is all about.
428;This film was truly beautiful.
429;but there was a beautiful WW2 story inside, and it was EPIC.
430;Schindler's List has NOTHING on the Pianist.
431;The film is based on a true story and is set in World War II.
432;It centers around a world class pianist by the name of Wladyslaw Szpilman who survives the Holocaust with the help of Polish revolutionaries attempting to overthrow the Nazi occupation and with the courageous help from non.
433;yet this movie places you in the seat .
434;"The major difference between this and Spielberg's gem is that ""Schindler's List"" is more objective, and ""The Pianist"" is subjective."
435;The direction is astounding, and I pity anyone who did not see this on the big screen.
436;This may leave some people feeling cold, but the technical filmaking in this movie is superb.
437;Roman Polanski richly deserved the Oscar for Best Director.
438;This is a moving film with many unnerving scenes that linger long after the lights have come up.
439;Such a deeply moving film, I can barely find words to capture the intensity.
440;The tortureous plot of human and art are so majestically entertwined and elevated to beyond heavenly by films end.
441;This tour de force is one of the most intimate in my experience.
442;roman Polanski, who won the Oscar for Best Director, took Ron Harwood's adaptation of the late Wladyslaw Spzilman's book of the same name and delivered stunning visual testimony to a black period in human history, throwing in some of what he saw as a boy in the Krakow ghetto.
443;Bottom line: Polanski and star Adrien Brody deserved their Oscars (and the movie should have received the Oscar for Best Picture).
444;read the book, watch the movie, and you'll learn to appreciate things a little more than before.
445;He certainly deserved the Oscar for his acting performance in The Pianist.
446;This historical film will go down as one of the greatest films in history.
447;This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact.
448;based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :.)
449;"It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes
I:205;450;winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest """"safe house"""" has a piano."""
451;"shoulders shot, shoulders moving
I:205;452;and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head.
I:205;453;Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I've seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making.
I:205;454;Besides, the rest of the 2002 Best Actor nominees already won Oscars .
I:205;455;It remains one of the top films that I have seen, and is certainly one of the best Holocaust films of all times for a variety of reasons.
I:205;456;second, the storyline is compelling.
I:205;457;I found my attention totally riveted on the screen for the entire two and a half hours.
I:205;458;the Holocaust remains a fascinating subject for the simple reason that it happened.
I:205;459;Then again, it makes perfect sense.
I:205;460;the fact that Szpilman survives the Holocaust makes The Pianist riveting as a story, but the idea that he had to do it in such complete and total isolation (the latter portion of the film plays almost like the movie Cast Away) is what makes it doubly powerful.
I:205;461;Regardless of people's opinion of Polanski (and it can range from admiration to disgust, sometimes from the same person), The Pianist stands alone as an important work of art.
I:205;462;And, the fact that Hollywood actually gave Polanski an Oscar in absentia for the movie speaks more to its undeniable power than it does any kind of perceived liberal favoritism (though there's plenty of that to go around in the film industry).
I:205;463;Polanski clearly saw a parallel between his childhood memories and the story of Szpilman, and it shows all over the movie.
I:205;464;polanski also saw something in Brody that must have reminded him of himself.
I:205;465;Brody, who had gone relatively unnoticed despite his wealth of talent, here gives a performance so complete it's hard to imagine that he is in real life just a kid from Brooklyn.
I:205;466;It is easily the best film of last year, and perhaps the best dramatized Holocaust film ever made.
I:205;467;The Pianist (Roman Polaski, 2002, 148')Having read and heard from my usual sources about it, this is the first time I have actually seen The Pianist.
I:205;468;Perfect craftsmanship at all levels, of the highest level.
I:205;469;the film hasn't lost its edge and captures a truly horrific time in history very realisticly, but it also counters that with the triumph of the human spirit.
I:205;470;i've always been fascinated with this time period and have seen many films on the subject.
I:205;471;The Pianist is very unique in terms of the way it is handled.
I:205;472;even at two and half hours long this film captivates the viewer from start to finish.
I:205;473;Roman Polanski deserves much of the credit drawing from his own life's experiences for the events portrayed in this film.
I:205;474;The sets, locations and camera work are also outstanding.
I:205;475;It's an amazing film on every level.
I:205;476;There are so many ways to review a film.
I:205;477;in all respects a brilliant film.
I:205;478;hosenfeld, a busy leader organizing retreat who can take the time to listen to Szpilman play, and to say ironically, with a smile.
I:205;479;good name for a Pianist.
I:205;480;I recommend it most highly, for its tragic and ecstatic moments, one of the most dramatic being Szpilman's ultimately failed search for Hosenfeld.
I:205;481;Films like The Pianist are important to watch for those of us born after WWII.
I:205;482;At first I thought LIB was the better film because it is more """"entertaining,"""" meaning there is a greater range of emotion ."""
483;this movie is probably closer to the truth of human experience than LIB.
484;Wladyslaw (the protagonist) is more lucky than brave or smart.
485;In short, he is an Everyman with one great talent .
486;so, is The Pianist a good movie?
487;This can be the first step towards whatever action your conscience leads you to take.
488;If you like documentaries from WWII, this is one of the greatest films ever made!
489;Brody gives an outstanding performance and the overall feel of the movie puts you right in the middle of it.
490;% stars, two thumbs up!
491;hosenfeld befriended numerous Poles and even made an effort to learn their language.
492;Now I watch it over and over, with tears in my eyes at the concert ending.
493;I love this movie, and the fact that it is a true story is compelling.
494;The music is, as expected, brilliant.
495;The sets and cinematography are magnificient.
496;Adrien Brody, as usual, puts in an excellent performance.
497;he has probably the most expressive eyes in cinema.
498;The script is also solid, few dead spots anywhere.
499;This video is one of the best things to ever be produced.
500;To be color blind and religiously blind to other human beings is the best way to live and this video is the best tool to teach this lesson and others along with it.
501;I told my wife and youngest daughter that they were going to love this movie as I had seen it once before.
502;"line to continue the ""research"" into this powerful story."
503;The entire movie is first rate.
504;one of the best ever made!
505;His performance carries you through his adversity on his shoulders, while never losing his love of Music.
506;Astonishing is putting it lightly.
507;Subsistence of life is what makes this great work so amazing.
508;This is a classic masterpiece of one man's struggle against the inhumanity of the Nazis of world war II Germany.
509;Adrien Brody's portrayal of Polish pianist Wladislaw Szpilman is both beautiful and nuanced.
510;Although I wouldn't rank this as high as Schindler's List (as some have done), it's definitely one of the finest of the Holocaust movies ever made.
511;Wow, initially, a friend recommended me to watch this movie after he received it for christmas.
512;After constant nagging by him, I decided to give it a try and I feel in love with it.
513;This movie is incredible and almost, almost brought me to tears.
514;i guarantee you will absolutely LOVE this movie.
515;Yet it does so in a beautiful way.
516;the cinematography, the direction, and the casting is perfection.
517;A true story about pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman and his life working in Polish labor camps during WWII, and how he escaped deportation and capture by living in Warsaw's ruins.
518;It is a truly mesmerizing story.
519;His performace was absorbing, as was the movie.
520;Even if you're not a fan of Holocaust movies, this one is highly recommended.
521;This movie was amazing, and the fact that it was a true story is absolutely incredible.
522;this film also brings to light the struggles of non.
523;It's an excellent movie for history buffs.
524;uPDATE: Just saw Schindler's List .
525;i thought that this was a great movie.
526;i hope you enjoy the movie like i did
527;Secondly, my wife and I have always liked classical music and to be able to see his hands move on the piano keyboard was really a treat.
528;Thirdly, the fact that the nation of Israel is still standing is a miracle and God in the Bible told Abraham, I will bless them that bless you and curse them that curse you and in you all the nations of the earth shall be blessed , of course referring the Lord Jesus Christ, who in His humanity was born of the tribe of Judah.
529;As we would defend our eyes from anything coming towards it so God will defend His people.
530;If that could be improved that would be great, otherwise the filming was excellent.
531;I was so deeply moved by this film.
532;The whole cast, especially Brody,was excellent!
533;Adrien Brody, as Wladyslaw Szpilman, is actually portraying the character of an everyday person .
534;in many previous films the crowd has come to expect tales of bravery, boldness and selfishness that give rise to sublimity of the spirit and a far.
535;reaching emotions of human bond.
536;The real heroes are the people who take tremendous risks and help him to survive the incomprehensible and inconceivable ordeal of The Holocaust.
537;"Starting with the Jewish Capos, continuing with a few Polish friends and ending with a high rank SS officer
I:205;538;the importance of this film is the return to the notion that even among the most ferocious wickedness .
I:205;539;Passivity is the main theme here.
I:205;540;This has been one of my favorite movies since it came out.
I:205;541;and I do cry each time I see it.
I:205;542;True story of both the pianist and the German captain who saved him at the end.
I:205;543;A very powerful movie, superbly acted.
I:205;544;Recommended for mature audiences .
I:205;545;Adrien Brody gives an intense, very realistic performance.
I:205;546;the ingredients that went into making this movie are all superb and beyond negative criticisms: the script is masterful and Roman Polanski directs with precision and meticulous concern for detail and nuance.
I:205;547;Adrian Brody's performance reflecting his physical decay over time, and his increasing anguish, is certainly a tour de force of extraordinary acting.
I:205;548;The film's theme of hope and of survival cannot be faulted.
I:205;549;This film consciously attempts to resemble the newsreels of the day"
550;A masterpiece of a movie.
551;It is a beautiful movie, bittersweet.
552;The acting of Adrien Brody was impeccable as was, in fact, that of all the cast including all the old favourites like Maureen Lipman and Frank Finlay.
553;I personally believe The Pianist is the greatest movie ever produced about the Holocaust, along with Spielberg's Schindler's List.
554;It is also one of the most graphic and, therefore, definitely one of the most realistic movies out there.
555;the story itself is very interesting and pretty amazing.
556;the shooting was especially fantastic and so were the scenes in the movie.
557;The characters were all very believable, and, basically, it does seem like it was all very well thought out.
558;the Pianist is simply a masterpiece.
559;"of featurette, ""A Story of Survival"" transcends that reliably lightweight genre on the power of Polanski's words and vivid recollections."
560;of includes recent footage of the real.
561;"The book's detail of the Nazi occupation was ""vividly true to me, a child of the same period,"" Polanski says."
562;The Pianist looks fine, up to major studio standards.
563;A wonderful story of compassion and caring by a German Captain.
564;Szpilman performs a wonderful tune on the piano.
565;The Captain responds with compassion, giving Szpilman food and even the coat off his back.
566;Polish filmaker Polanski shows the truth in his movie.
567;A moving, understated, almost documentary.
568;Polanski's direction is beautifully restrained, there is no spelunking in violene nor melodrama, but a simple, unrelenting story of both a people's suffering and especially one man's suffering and survival in a world temporarily gone mad.
569;This is an infinitely sad, infinitely moving but also infinitely human testament to the art of music, the art of life and the art of film.
570;THE PIANIST is a powerful film by famed Jewish director Roman Polanski, who won a Best director Oscar, as well as star Adrien Brody, who won Best Actor playing Wlady Szphilman, a real.
571;renown pianistThe movie is set in World War II Nazi.
572;"tHE PIANIST is an absolutely great piece of work
I:205;573;Brody also did a magnificent job potraying Szpilman, and I think he richly deserved that Oscar.
I:205;574;one of the greatest Holocaust films ever made!
I:205;575;Wonderful direction, tight script, and inspired acting (if occasional spurts going over the top by Brody.)
I:205;576;By far, the best presentation of the film is the Canadian 3 Disc Limited Edition.
I:205;577;Instead I saw one of the most amazing movies in a long time.
I:205;578;But for those of you that have nice strong stomach and haven't seen this movie.
I:205;579;Superbly acted and a very compelling movie.
I:205;580;this and Schindler's list are classics!
I:205;581;The Pianist is the true story of the struggle to survive the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto of Polish Jewish musician Wladyslaw Szpilman.
I:205;582;The Pianist is from a true story, directed by Roman Polanski.
I:205;583;This movie is about A jew that survives the whole bloody war.
I:205;584;He also goes on on play the Piano after all the $hit he has been through.
I:205;585;Excellent acting by Adrien Brody.
I:205;586;I came from Jewish ancestry and I have studied the holocaust since I was 15.
I:205;587;This movie is the best.
I:205;588;I will kip all my new movies:p this people are the best!!
I:205;589;Obviously we crave more grief in atonement for the atrocities of the foulest century of our history, since we eat up films and novels that depict it.
I:205;590;Perhaps that's the best any of us can claim, to be survivors.
I:205;591;She went off to bed to read a new """"Parker"""" novel for relief."""
592;Hosenfeld orders Szpilman to play the piano, and director Polanski gives us quite a long concert view of the Pianist's hands on the keyboard.
593;That's a powerful statement of grief and guilt, coming from me, a person who lives for music.
594;The courage of the Pianist was something extraordenary.
595;I recommend the film to be seen by every one.
596;It gives a true picture of the whole era.
597;"This is the most moving work I've ever seen
I:205;598;Congratulations to Mr. Polanksi and Adrien Brody on a job well done.
I:205;599;The desire to survive will outway the need for anything.
I:205;600;and others will see it by the good work we do in our lives.
I:205;601;This is A Great movie ,very well done and everyone should see at least once.
I:205;602;An excellent film made even more dramatic in that elements of Polanskis actual life are included in the film.
I:205;603;The German officer at the end is quite rightly a symbol of hope that there is still good in the world.
I:205;604;This is a finely spun tale of the courage and dignity of a human soul pitted against one of the cruelist moments in history: the Nazi Final Solution for the Jews in WWII.
I:205;605;For this viewer the larger screen version, though impressive, seemed to attract the vastness of the problem, the litter of corpses, the unrelenting bombings, spontaneous killings, etc.
I:205;606;This is one of the best movies out there.
I:205;607;Completely deserving of the 3 Academy Awards it won (Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Screenplay).
I:205;608;if you like old war movies, with high drama, and a great story, this is a good movie for you.
I:205;609;It is a long movie, but worth the watch.
I:205;610;Not since """"Shindler's List (1993) has such a poignant tale of Holocaust survival been brought to the screen."""
611;The team of Roman Polanski (Director) and Ronald Howard (screenplay) have faithfully adapted Wladyslaw Szpilman's touching memoir to produce one of the most realistic human dramas in recent years.
612;Polanski's own recollections of his childhood spent in the Cracow ghetto are added to Howard's screenplay.
613;The result is a brilliant and artistic testimony to the human spirit's will to survive.
614;Adrien Brody plays Szpilman, an accomplished pianist from a well.
615;"Forcefully moved into the Warsaw Ghetto, Szpilman is spared the fate of his family who are loaded into cattle cars and ""relocated"" to the concentration camp at Treblinka."
616;The ability to keep one's humanity and moral integrity under such conditions was the true test for Szpilman.
617;With the exception of one neighbor who tries unsuccessfully to turn Szpilman into the Nazis, all the other Polish gentiles depicted in the film are sympathetic to the Warsaw Jews.
618;On the whole, The Pianist is a wonderful film.
619;The set design and wardrobe are authentic down to the finest detail.
620;Every scene is a gem.
621;The acting job by Brody and supporting cast are superb and the soundtrack hauntingly beautiful.
622;Five stars and highly recommended.
623;this movie is certainly very close to the reality and as a matter of fact, it's really well done.
624;if you want to compare with the Shindler's list, I will say the Spielberg's work was more telling about the period, the fate of most of the jews.
625;adrien Brody is simply excellent and it's an actor I'd like to see more often.
626;This is simply the best.
627;The Pianist is an excellent movie.
628;Adrien really shows his storming performance as spilzman.
629;Overall, i recommend this to everyone.
630;One of the best movies I've ever watched.
631;A true story with much sadness but a beautiful ending.
632;the aspect of this film that I liked.
633;The Polish piano player's will to live was impressive.
634;His ability to play beautiful music at a time of great struggle, fear of losing his life, and having already lost his entire family was moving beyond words.
635;Another good movie, however, much darker.
636;the film was a great impact just as other before it.
637;when considering this film, know that the artistry, history, and story are worth you time and investment.
638;I was so moved I had to watch it twice.
639;The story of Wladyslaw Szpilman is so moving and touching that it has gotten me both times.
640;If you haven't seen it, go see it.
641;The composition for this movie is fantastic and I have since started listening to the great Chopin.
642;Not to mention, if you love Adrien Brody, this is absolutely a must.
643;He is amazing in this film and about as gorgeous as ever.
644;His performance as Szpilman will forever haunt me because it is so lifelike and will stay with you.
645;Watching this movie made me realize how easy of life is.
646;One of the most powerful movies I have ever seen.
647;But the sadness is worth the message and unbelievable performances.
648;I so loved this movie!!!!
649;its emotional, sad but very touching!
650;you felt for them and got a good lookof what it would be like to be a jew at that time.
651;This movie stands out due to the excellent acting of the lead character and how well it manages to reflect on the lives of Jews(especially) and others caused harm by the war.
652;the storyline and screenplay are quite solid.
653;This movie shows the incredible inhumanity that human beings have visited on other human beings for reasons that defy logic.
654;The acting was superior and the scenes made you feel like you were in the Polish Ghettos.
655;Whether it was Germany or Rwanda, the incredible inhumanity that people visit on others based on ethnic or religious differences is stunning and chilling.
656;This film may be well the sublime masterpiece of this gifted director .
657;This encounter will open an invisible gate for those men who will share far beyond his beliefs and points of view a warm and effective reason to forget though for brief moments the crude surrounding reality that involves them .
658;as you see both films are close related but the Pianist differs from that one in its inner epic aspect .
659;the heart of the craft will never be under the war miseries , seems the prevailing statement of this excellent movie a real Cannes winner and much more received in Europe than America even it suffers of certain steadiness along its development .
660;towering acting for Brody who won the Academy Award as best actor.
661;It was in pristine condition .
662;Hard to imagine this was real life.
663;This shows you that music (and a serious hiebe of luck) can overcome the greatest evil in the world.
664;I loved this movie, and I do understand why it won three Academy Awards.
665;It is very well made, and it kept me 'glued to the screen' from beginning to end.
666;Yes, I give it 5 stars.
667;hand and anguishingly accurate depiction of an immensely inhuman historical atrocity.
668;The film is brilliant in its dense darkness because Polanski does not concentrate his tale so much on the community but on one particular Jew and his family he will be the only survivor of (it is a true story).
669;jews, some honest resistant fighters who put themselves in danger because of their political action, some (at least one) making a personal profit out of their help, the pianist also sees the meaningful and significant upheaval of the Jews when the ghetto is nearly empty.
670;A real salvation and epiphany for us all.
671;That is exactly where pathos is discarded and love comes into the picture.
672;An incredible and moving account of what Wladyslaw Szpilman and the Jewish people had to endure with the horrific attrocities of the nazis, while at the same time the movie shows that not all Germans believed in Hitlers evil ways.
673;Adrian Brody did a remarkable job portraying Szpilman, and was well deserving of the Oscar award.
674;This movie is well worth purchasing.
675;I admire Polanski for taking a broader look at the Holocaust, showing the divisions within the Jewish community in Warsaw and the help some got through the Polish underground.
676;Of course, it helps to have such a compelling figure as Szpilman to wrap this complex story around.
677;one gets a very strong impression of the devolution of Jewish life in Warsaw, as Szpilman's family is forced to reduce itself to increasingly more appalling conditions.
678;The Warsaw Uprising is touched upon.
679;Adrien Brody turns in a fine performance.
680;i bought the 2 Disc version because the extra features seemed to be more extensive than the American disc.
681;The American release simply has one two.
682;There is an additional trailer or two on the Canadian release, that's it.
683;It's informative and intelligently made.
684;I took captures on my computer and compared them frame for frame.
685;"Director Roman Polanski had much personal history to draw on, when he directed ""The Pianist."""
686;Polanski makes this his most personal and powerful film to date, and deservingly won the Academy Award Oscar for Best Director.
687;History has documented well what happened in Warsaw over the following two years .
688;the story is told from a uniquely unsentimental point of view.
689;These film takes add emotion to the film, compensate for, and contrast well with Szpilman's emotional isolation.
690;the film is a remarkable in its sensitivity, and portrayal of one man's struggle to survive.
691;It shows that music is his life and love .
692;I liked this film for its wonderful soundtrack and the way it flows .
693;Cudos to Polanski for this beautiful film.
694;The cinematography is incredible, and the musical score is beautiful.
695;The Pianist is one of those films you are proud to have in your collection.
696;The Pianist fulfills this for me in as comfortable a way as it can, considering the subject and the music, of course, is excellent.
697;This movie certainly gave us a very vivid idea of what the Jewish people had to go through during the time that the Nazis tried to eliminate them.
698;It's hard to believe that one human being would treat another human being the way they did.
699;very sad and beautiful holocaust survivor story.
700;This movie is moving, inspiring, educational and truly amazing!!
701;I have recommended it to all my friends and family!
702;This is a great movie.
703;That show the struggles of the time and tell the story of a man that made his way through to the other side.
704;One of the best war movies I have ever seen.
705;Solid acting, convincing effects and a graphic depiction of life as a Jew in Warsaw in 1944.
706;This was a wonderful movie and so sincere, I liked the actors, the action, and the music that The Pianist played.
707;I would highly recommend this movie to those that are interested in seeing a good movie that has a reason for being made.
708;Szpilman is a classical pianist whose middle.
709;The Pianist is quite true to its namesake book.
710;These are powerful images that convince because of their relative insignificance.
711;while Adrian Brody well deserved the best.
712;"actor Oscar for this film, ""The Pianist"" is an extraordinary ensemble movie."
713;Szpilman's family is very real .
714;Thomas Kretschmann, who plays German Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, is extraordinary in his depiction of a man torn between duty and humanity.
715;The Pianist brings to the screen the memories of a man who survived two of the most extraordinary events of the war .
716;It's a testament to the thousands and millions who played their small parts in a gigantic drama that shaped the last century.
717;One of the top movies ever made!
718;So realistic and well acted.
719;Recommend it to everyone .
720;Even though I'm simply echoing stuff that a lot of other negative reviewers have said, I feel I must help counter all the mysteriously great reviews this film got!
721;"better movies like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Life is Beautiful."""
722;Haven't watched it yet, but think it's along the line of Schindlers List or Life is Beautiful.
723;This Holocaust account of Jewish life outside concentration camps was the perfect addition to my English I curriculum.
724;this movie is just great.
725;If you don't see this movie, you will regreat it.
726;There have been many films on the Holocaust, but Roman Polanski's film about Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jewish pianist who survived against incredible odds, is probably the most perfect film on the subject I've seen.
727;szpilman is a real person, a talented pianist who played regularly on Warsaw Radio.
728;He is befriended along the way, and finally by a most unlikely person.
729;polanski shows himself to be one of the most masterful of directors, never lowering himself to shock or sentimentality.
730;"The sets, filmed in Germany's ""Hollywood"" Babelsberg, are phenomenally realistic."
731;the actors (including the well.
732;this film is about as perfect as films can be.
733;I recommend this to anyone who loves film and history.
734;This is a stunning portrait of how one Polish Jew survived the Nazi Holocaust.
735;He returns home to learn that the Nazis require that all Jews in Warsaw must relocate to a ghetto.
736;this is a movie about the survival of one man during one of the most important and terrible times of the twentieth century.
737;This is a singular story and it is beautiful and haunting.
738;There are moments of absolute beauty and wonder, and there are moments that are excruciating to watch.
739;The Pianist is a masterpiece by Roman Polanski and it rightfully deserved all of the accolades that it received.
740;I was deeply moved by this true story of one man's endurance against the Nazi oppression in wartime Poland.
741;Roman Polanski, himself a victim of the holocaust, directs the actors in a superb manner.
742;The special feature interview of Polanski is especially moving.
743;This should be required viewing by all High School kids to give them a lasting view of how far evil can extend and what good people can do to overcome it.
744;I liked it better than Schindler's List.
745;Even though this is a old movie I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.
746;I would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone who likes watching a movie based on true events that happened in the past.
747;The Pianist is a powerful and difficult experience.
748;The struggle of Wadysaw Szpilman, his family, and his peers hits hard and consistently.
749;Adrien Brody is magnificent, his character's transformation throughout the film is stunning to watch.
750;The cinematography is superb, as well.
751;overall, The Pianist is a powerful and captivating film, with amazing performances, beautiful music, and great cinematography.
752;It's a difficult film to watch, but an experience worth having.
753;the Pianist has strong violence and blood.
754;The way the director presents you the material makes you feel like you are experiencing what the actors are.
755;This is a truimph of a story.
756;This movie kept me riveted.
757;Perhaps the best movie from Roman Polanski, about Jewish.
758;Adrien Brody is perfect as Szpilman and does a excellent performence here.
759;This movie is based on a true story and it tells you about how his life drastically changed from being great to being a hell.
760;This movie shows you everything about it, it's realistic and very well made.
761;A remarkable movie that deserved the prices it good.
762;Seeing the name Roman Polanski has become quite common nowadays, but that attention is focused more on his private life than the films he has directed over the years.
763;The Pianist is one of his most celebrated films, winning 3 Academy Awards including one for Polanski as Best Director.
764;It also won the Palme d'or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002.
765;The Pianist is a Holocaust film, based on the autobiography of pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman.
766;"Roman Polanski survived the Holocaust and this was obviously a personal project for him
I:205;767;Wladyslaw """"Wladek"""" Szpilman, a highly lauded pianist and his Jewish family see their happy existence crumble around them, as Germany's invasion of Poland is well under way."""
768;Unlike many Holocaust movies, The Pianist gives a very in.
769;depth look at the day.
770;What makes this so impactful is the way Polanski lets the story unfold.
771;there's a deeply human, intriguing story that draws you in and can be quite suspenseful.
772;the film itself is incredibly well.
773;made and I applaud Polanski for re.
774;There are scenes that are shockingly horrifying and they are filmed with an unflinching honesty.
775;adrian Brody won the Best Actor Academy Award for his performance as Wladek and he really did deserve it.
776;He gives a believable, low.
777;Its perfection and power come from how human it is and his ability to never seem like he's acting.
778;breaking, suspenseful film with one of the decade's greatest performances and one of the world's greatest directors.
779;there's a scene towards the end that is one of the most profound and powerful in the entire film.
780;It's a perfect example of how thoroughly Brody portrays Wladek, but also a testament to what an amazing director Polanski is.
781;The Pianist is one of the greatest films ever made about the Holocaust, but it's also one of the greatest films ever made.
782;It's an absolute triumph that shouldn't be missed.
783;It delivers what it promises .
784;Polanski (director), Adrian Brody (male lead) and Ronald Harwood (screenplay) richly deserved the Oscars that they won for this film.
785;This is a great movie about a pianist in the Jewish and german war, what a movie, nice family movie, loved it
786;polanski has the gift to see how a great film should look and feel.
787;THE PIANIST is one of the best films that I've seen in a long time.
788;The music, acting, cinematography and the superb direction of Roman Pulanski have all combined to make an extraordinary film.
789;It's the true story of a Jewish pianist and takes place in Poland during World War II.
790;Adrien Brody's performance in the part of Wladyslaw Szpilman was sensitive and believable.
791;The portrayal of the home life of the Szpilman family was intriguing.
792;Wladyslaw is a radio star and has some influence.
793;He survived with the help of Christian friends and by his sheer tenacity.
794;This is truly a wonderful, realistic, and true account of one man's struggle and survival during the most horrific time in history.
795;My students who viewed this in my Holocaust class always have a better understanding of this period in history and have generated many questions.
796;This movie is beautifully done.
797;Well casted, well written, just a true ringer.
798;The movie pulls you in from the beginning and never lets you go.
799;The life this man has to endure is painful to witness but entertaining nonetheless.
800;The movie is a glimpse into history, thought provoking, and the PERFECT pick for a rainy day on the couch with a big warm blanket.
801;This film is so realistic!
802;this is a true story of a sensible artist who suffers in the world of Chaos and war.
803;one of the finest actor)but i can understand truely the situation and his standpoint.
804;and without any hesitation i can say this is possibly the best movie ever made in the backdrop of World War II.
805;this is a movie you must watch.
806;one of the best movies ever made.
807;This movie does a great job of showing how difficult life was for the people during this difficult time.
808;A kind German soldier helps him survive until the Russians take over Poland, and at last we see some redemption in the closing scenes.
809;This is a powerful movie which is not always easy to watch but which tells a story which needs to be told again and again so that it will not be forgotten.
810;This is a very worthy Academy Award nominee.
811;"Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is a brilliantly produced tale based on the true story of a Polish Jew whose strong will to survive carried him through the darkest days of Nazi occupation of Poland."
812;The acting is superlative in all the roles, from Adrian Brody's lead to lesser roles, like the well.
813;A notable acting performance is also given in the role of the German captain who, as the Russians approach Poland, gives his overcoat to the pianist, partly out of kindness and partly to try to enlist his aid as the Germans are defeated and captured.
814;the photography is superb, the attention to detail is excellent.
815;This is Polanski's master work.
816;although the movie is bleak throughout, with much suffering and no light relief or moments of humor, it is also suffused with hope, with endurance, with the will to survive.
817;One of the most moving scenes is when the pianist lifts the lid of a piano in the apartment where he hides.
818;"although the theme is bleak, ""The Pianist"" will lift your heart."
819;Thumbs up and the highest recommendation!
820;this is a very good movie, that i think everyone one in the world should watch, i am so in love with the movie!
821;winning movie was based on the life of Polish.
822;very telling, that stage direction.
823;Polanski now lives in France and is a French citizen.
824;this film is superb and is wholly deserving of the awards and accolades it received.
825;It won the the Palme d'Or at Cannes, Oscars for Best Director, Best Actor (Adrien Brody), and Best Adapted Screenplay.
826;It also won seven French Cesars, including Best Actor for Brody, who became the only American actor to win a Cesar.
827;even though the movie concerns the absolutely horrific events Szpilman and his family lived and died through, it is uplifting at the end, in that Szpilman survives due to help from a German officer.
828;if you do not see any other Polanski movie or any other movie about the Holocaust, you must see this one.
829;The incredible scenery, the destruction, the realistic costume design, everything about this movie is riveting without depressing the heck out of you.
830;This is as riveting a story as that of Anne Frank.
831;The Pianis:t brings you into another world.
832;I liked it so much that I bought my own copy.
833;One of the best (although heart.
834;wrenching) movies I've ever seen.
835;It should be a must for everyone to see.
836;This is an excellent portrayal of the horrors of WWII, seen from the perspective of one victim.
837;The tragedy and triumph of one man is masterfully acted by Brody, who deservedly won the oscar for his performance.
838;Fantastic, gripping, heartwrenching movie that is entirely worthwhile in our time of frequently mindless entertainment.
839;Highly recommended for adults and mature teens.
840;This is one of the best WWII films I've seen, along with Schindler's List it really has a great story and plot development.
841;He captured the spirit of Wladyslaw Szpilman and I admire the lengths he was willing to go to in order to experience what Szpilman experienced in terms of isolation and starvation.
842;There were moments when I completely forgot that this was a true story and that Szpilman survived.
843;roman Polanski has created his masterpiece.
844;Afterall, survival was Szpilman's ultimate masterpiece.
845;i would also recommend checking out the book the movie is based on.
846;This is a rare instance where I found the movie to be better, but it is a worthy read.
847;Plus, the reader gets an interesting insight into Wilm Hosenfeld .
848;Szpilman's influence was so great that he was spared when his family was sent off to the gas chambers.
849;Great music can only be created with great suffering.
850;You will both laugh and cry as you watch this wonderful moving story!
851;Bought this movie for a friend as a Christmas gift.
852;It has everything in it.you will cry, you will smile and you will sit in silence and just think.
853;sounds like a great dramatic plot right?
854;the real beauty of this movie is the vivid recreation of Warsaw during WWII.
855;That makes this movie a journey worth taking.
856;roman Polanski, the director, talks about how this character represents an affirmation and celebration of life.
857;It shows why he had such passion for making the movie.
858;and this is exactly why the film is a must.
859;i applaud Roman Polanski for his impeccable direction.
860;I watched tis movie last night, and I was really moved by it.
861;This one seemed very personal,and very lonely.
862;director Roman Polanski,did a great job of letting me feel the human condition of an oppressed people.
863;i thought Adrien Brody was most beautifully expressive.
864;this movie is a must see.
865;This is an excellent movie!
866;Of all the War films depicting the cruelty of German enforced rule, this is certainly one of the best.
867;The movie opens up with haunting melodies of Chopin's nocturnesplayed by the actor himself as he had to practice to play piano in order to make the movie more remarkable.
868;it's true that this is another movie on Jew's sufferings of world war 2 but this is the best of all put together.
869;It is a movie based on a life of a true artist Wladyslav Sh.
870;and it was directed by an excellent director Roman Polanski.
871;the images throughout the movies are so real.
872;Tears streamed down my face so many times as I watched this movie and I swear to God up to now I watched it nearly ten times so far and each time I feel more sympathetic to what this remarkable man went through.
873;The Pianist is incredibly moving.
874;This movie is historically accurate, and the plot is easy to follow.
875;All of the actors are amazing, especially Adrien Brody.
876;A phenomenal soundtrack is the icing on the cake.
877;The Pianist is a a true masterpiece.
878;This extraordinary film serves skillfully as a poetic reminder of humanities startling capacity for insufferable cruelty towards one another and amazing capacity for kindness to one another in particularly difficult situations!
879;"it is of little wonder that this film that is based on a true story won three Academy awards
I:205;880;Adrien Brody's unforgettable performance is nothing short of stunning as he plays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish pianist caught up in the Nazi's war against the Jewish in Poland during World War II.
I:205;881;From the beginning to the end this film is a highly gripping one and I'm sure the credit for that goes just as much to Roman Polanski's direction as it does the script and the actors performances.
I:205;882;I highly recommend this film to any and all!
I:205;883;a Story of Survival: Insight into the making of the film and its authenticity.
I:205;884;roman Polanski's own story of survival during WWII.
I:205;885;behind the scenes interviews with Oscar winners Roman Polanski, Adrien Brody and Ronald Harwood.
I:205;886;very inspiring, with an equally amazing musical score by Fredric Chopin to accompany the dramatic story line.
I:205;887;it exemplifies the awesome power of this mans survival!
I:205;888;#1 best movie in years!
I:205;889;The pianist shows the weakness of humans as well as the humaneness!
I:205;890;This is one of the best movies and Adrien Brody is phenomenal in it!!
I:205;891;Keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time!!
I:205;892;i had heard some good reviews and was very interested to see what Polanski had been up to lately.
I:205;893;i was astonished, moved, and speechless.
I:205;894;the movie embodies everything that I love about film.
I:205;895;a true story being told with love and great care for the past, and in a way that makes you feel the pain that the characters experience.
I:205;896;His performance was genuine and brilliant.
I:205;897;He has been my favorite actor for a few years and out did all of his previous work with his role as Wladyslaw Szpilman.
I:205;898;the Pianist is an unforgettable film about a simple man who hangs on when all hope and life is lost from the world he knows.
I:205;899;One cant help when watching this film if Roman Planski wasnt doing some hidden statement of his own, the brilliant pianist forced to etch out a living apart from the place he knows and loves.
I:205;900;the gritty often graphic film, stirs our emotions as Schindlers did, and once again causes us to hate the inhumanity of that time period, but how many films do we have to see on it to do that.
I:205;901;This is an amazing film on its own merit and not everyone will appreciate that.
I:205;902;There is little in my existence that presents a more shattering, emotional and involving real life story than this astounding film.
I:205;903;the film tells the real life story of a Polish pianist, a national treasure, that was hidden during the war.
I:205;904;The first hour of the film is told through his family's travails"
905;His story is told in remarkable vignettes of battles in the streets of Poland with some of the best war footage ever created for the screen.
906;"Here is a once in a decade film and surely the best World War II story since ""The English Patient"" and better than that flick!"
907;Adrien Brody at least won the Oscar for best actor.
908;Maybe he deserved that but this film surely deserved best movie.
909;It is probably the best film of the new century.
910;Grace comes in the form of a second chance .
911;at music, at freedom, at life.
912;my comments: Everyone knows by now that Mr. Brody won an Oscar for his starring role.
913;The fact that this was based on a TRUE story makes it even more amazing.
914;the few scenes between those two were the most surprisingly beautiful, and emotional parts of the whole movie.
915;tHE SOUNDTRACK WAS LOVELY: the piano playing was amazingly splendid.
916;overall, excellent film about history, music, love, loss, and the will to live.
917;This is true for me and actually came when I was editing out commercials of the television mini.
918;The Pianist is an atypical story of a European Jew during this period because the title character, Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody is his Oscar winning performance), survives the Holocaust.
919;There is a memorable shot of Szpilman walking down the street of the Warsaw ghetto after the deportation of the Jews and the streets are littered with their possessions.
920;The explanation, such director Roman Polanski provides in this film, is that Szpilman has value as a classical pianist, a cultural icon of sorts to the people of Warsaw, whether they are Jewish or not.
921;In Steven Spielberg's film the story is heroic because of the effort to fight the system and the odds (Oskar Schindler ended a lot high on the list of AFI's Heroes this week than Moses).
922;He is a mute witness as well, as much by temperament as by his vocation, although there is only one piano piece in the entire film where we sense that he is articulating his feelings rather than playing what he has been told to play.
923;Remarkable true story of courage and resistance during the terrible days of Nazi reign of terror.
924;I show it in my U. s. history class when we study the Holocaust.
925;It is a great way to help educate students about what happened and how one can survive even the worst of times.
926;Roman Polanski is up there with Spielberg with their great contribution to film and history.
927;Very moving and thought provoking movie for anyone.
928;A great way to learn about history and what it takes to survive the worst of times.
929;I came back after a little while and it worked just fine.
930;The movie does feel a little slow at times, but overall the story is engaging and you keep wondering what will happen next.
931;rate acting, and utterly compelling direction breathe life into this moving, intensely personal, exciting, and important film.
932;Beginning filmmakers should study this film long and hard to see how to create artful storytelling and overall subtlety.
933;Brody is superb, but the entire production is magical.
934;I loved this film and thought it was outstanding, however, I cried buckets of tears from beginning to end.
935;Brilliantly directed and authentic and nominated for several Oscars.
936;Adrien Brody deservingly won for Best Actor.
937;Overall, this movie expresses so much feeling that it will forever be in my mind and will forever effect me.
938;My husband and I are big history buffs and he is a military vet.
939;We both enjoyed this sad but inspiring story built around the Holocaust.
940;I do not recommend it for children.
941;This is by far my favorite film of the new millennium, and I have seen it many times.
942;Great for its performances, sets, script and costuming.
943;but it's the carefully nuanced details that elevate this production.
944;witness Wladek paying the piano in a restaurant and flirting so delightfully with a lady patron, Wladek strolling with a charming young cellist, who so sweetly and innocently says.
945;'Oh Mr Szpilman, you really are quite wonderful.'
946;brody's performance is amazing, but so is that of Kretschmann as the German officer who helps him.
947;a mix of superior charm, cynicism, and benign indifference.
948;the final scenes of the devastation of Warsaw are incredible and powerfully moving, as is the Chopin Polonaise that Szpilman is required to play after a long and devastating period of isolation.
949;A beautiful film and the fulfillment of the incredible promise that Polanski first showed in my favorite film, Chinatown.
950;This excellent movie was riveting.
951;I highly recommend this movie to anyone wanting to learn more of the history of Jewish life (and extermination) under Nazi rule.
952;One of the best movies I'm ever watched.
953;The film is brilliant, Polanski's direction is absolutely perfect, but for me, this is Adrien Brody's masterpiece.
954;Mr. Brody OWNS this film, and never has an Academy Award been so well.
955;disc collector's edition is released sometime and I hope they include Adrien Brody's Oscar acceptance speech, which is also stunning!
956;Was just in Poland and it brought this movie to mind and had to see it again.
957;It's a good movie to see the realities of war and it's tragedies.
958;My son was learning about the Holocaust in school and the movie answered a lot of his questions.
959;Got the movie in new / perfect condition.
960;Adrien Brody does a terrific acting job too.
961;If you are a person of faith, you will love this story as I do.
962;Unfortunately, there is also brutality, but this man's story is inspirational.
963;This movie left me sitting in my seat at the end, and I watched all the credits, for the first time ever because I was so riveted by the movie.
964;adrien Brody was captivating in this film.
965;He is brilliant, one of my favorite scenes is when he plays the piano without touching the keys.
966;Here you will learn about how the film's locations were chosen and the meticulous detail used throughout the film.
967;His performance conveys even more with the use of his body than the words he speaks.
968;And those words are at times poetic.
969;this film is an inspiration to those living now and for generations to come.
970;It was haunting and unforgettable, yet uplifting.
971;A good movie about WWII Poland and a view inside the Warsaw ghetto, the movie is an interesting journey of a man who spent most of the war locked in rooms evading the Germans.
972;Great movie could not stop watching it for a minute.
973;The true beauty of the film is the artistic, psychological, and moral apex achieved in the film itself, and in the lives of two great artists, Szpilman and Polanski himself.
974;"Polanski's words are so poignant
I:205;975;The lives of Szpilman and Polanski are deeply intertwined.
I:205;976;How gratifying to watch his cinematic triumph, at age 70, in this deeply personal tale of courage and, not far beneath the surface, of moral redemption, a moral lesson and an inspiration for all.
I:205;977;This is undoubtedly one movie that will stay with me for a long time.
I:205;978;Adrien Brody's performance as Wladyslaw Szpilman was definately oscar worthy.
I:205;979;The story is a touching reminder of what humans are capable of acheiving when fighting for survival.
I:205;980;The fact that the film is directed by Roman Polanski who lived in the nazi 'era' made the story all the more real to the viewers.
I:205;981;I also liked the way the story was told in that there were good and bad Jews, Poles and Germans.
I:205;982;The Pianist was the winner of Academy Awards for Best Actor (Adrien Brody), Best Director (Roman Polanski) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Ronald Harwood), as well as the Golden Palm at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, among other awards and honors.
I:205;983;all the awards are well.
I:205;984;it should be noted that there are several interesting minor characters in the film as well.
I:205;985;Director Roman Polanski tells the story of one of these men, focusing on how the various atrocities of the Holocaust affected him.
I:205;986;including a handful of sympathetic Gentiles who jeopardize their own lives to hide and feed him.
I:205;987;scene after scene tears the viewer apart in this harrowing film, as Szpilman, brilliantly played by Brody, faces one degradation after another by those who refuse to recognize the common humanity among people.
I:205;988;Showing through the eyes of one man, a pianist, the most heart.
I:205;989;It's got a great cast, fantastic acting, and the world they create for the movie is perfect.
I:205;990;I did enjoy the main characters will and spirit through the film.
I:205;991;THe movie came quickly and was in great condition.
I:205;992;THE PIANIST [Adrian Brody / Directed by Roman Polanski / 150 minutes / Rated R for violence and brief strong language]""""The Pianist"""", Roman Polanski's remarkable drama about the horrors of the Jewish Holocaust in Warsaw, Poland in the early 1940s, is the best depiction of the subject since Steven Spielberg's """"Schindler's List"""""
993;mr. Brody won Best Actor and Mr. Polanski Best Director at this year's Oscars.
994;At the time it seemed a surprise upset to many people.
995;In retrospect, the awards were richly deserved.
996;But it is also very rewarding and a great example of the art of movies.
997;A picture is better than a thousand words.
998;This saying is especially true for The Pianist, a film based on the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman who escaped the fate of being put into concentration camp and survived in Warsaw by a fluke.
999;Director Roman Polanski commented, 'Until The Pianist, I have never read a piece so moving that I felt I had to bring it to the screen.
1000;A German officer who heard him play the same Chopin nocturne on a piano found among the rubble saved his life.
1001;In the sense the film is powerful in what it doesn't do.
1002;Andrien Brody's performance is superb as if he himself went through the fugitive life.
1003;The fact that Roman Polanski himself is a Holocaust survivor makes the film a valuable piece of the Holocaust history and its studies.
1004;roman Polanski has created an emotive and deep film.
1005;szpilman was an artist dedicated to playing and composing music when war came to disrupt his life and that of millions more.
1006;Every scene rings true and touches the raw nerve of the spectator.
1007;adrien Brody fleshes his character with sensibility and accuracy: an outstanding performance.
1008;polanski is at the height of his best productions and won 2003 Best Director's Oscar.
1009;I do not remember the last time that a movie moved me to such tears, compassion and awe as The Pianist has.
1010;I give it five stars not only for it's incredible portrayal of the Holocaust, and the Holocaust OUTSIDE of Germany, but this moving story that happened within the Holocaust.
1011;I hope to watch this movie many more times, but I know that no matter how many times I do, I will still cry and smile, feel my heart break and rejoice at the ending all over again.
1012;Yes, Adrien Brody delivers a good performance in the film, and the cinematography adequately captures the violent environment that was Poland in the early 1940's.
1013;week Holocaust format almost to a T: happy Jewish family enjoys life, happy Jewish family hears about the war, happy Jewish family begins to suffer discrimination, happy Jewish family gets pushed out, happy Jewish family gets sent to camp, one gets left behind, rest of movie follows him.
1014;The Holocaust DID happen and has been etched in time, but movies have done a fantastic job of rendering historical events in a fashion that brings new light to them.
1015;Schindler's List was so groundbreaking because it was spare, raw, and mainly from a Nazi's perspective.
1016;The Pianist may be well.
1017;There is a touchy ground that is broached when it comes to critiquing a film about such an important time in world history .
1018;The Pianist is one of those movies you can watch over and over again with the same feelings each time.
1019;The movie has a great pace to it.
1020;to receive 4 stars from critics a movie has to be either the best picture of the year or extremely good.
1021;Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, and The Two Towers both received 3 stars.
1022;For example, Spielberg's Schindler's List resorts to rather sophomoric narrative devices in its depiction of hope in the face of adversity.
1023;The mood of Schindler's List overall was certainly sad and the scenes realistic , but I felt that Spielberg oversimplified and overdramatized the emotions and some events in order to emphasize hope.
1024;It is somewhat documentary in style, without very much dialogue, special effects, or forced dramatization.
1025;This holocaust movie reveals the goodness in human nature in the face of the most terrible atrocities realistically and without compromise.
1026;The special features are interesting and revealing.
1027;The video and sound transfers are excellent.
1028;Krestschmann is an actor to watch.
1029;he is brilliant in this small but unforgettable role.
1030;the music is awesome, and the movie's dramatic thrust is heightened by its inclusion.
1031;not an easy movie to watch, but deeply moving and memorable.
1032;Brody's Oscar is surely deserved.
1033;Yet, the determination of this young pianist to survive shows the inner strength of the human spirit to overcome.
1034;Hopefully none of us will ever be pushed to such limits but this movie makes us aware of the inner strength that lies within us.
1035;This is the story of one man in his efforts to live and those who along the way assisted him including one kind German.
1036;an inspiring story of struggle to survive against the odds.
1037;Now, I obviously see a lot of comparisons of The Pianist to The Schindler's List.
1038;That really is reflected in his movies.
1039;He is a great documentarian so to speak of the story he tells us about.
1040;I love Polanski and I love a lot of his movies (and hate a lot of them as well) but he has a certain way of telling the story.
1041;"From this perspective, ""The Pianist"" is great."
1042;And obviously I loved the fact that unlike so many American movies, this is a movie about a regular person, not a hero, not a bad guy but someone just like you or me (yes, a great pianist of course!)
1043;a decent person trying to survive the madness and horror of history .
1044;In this way he is an everyman.
1045;I did enjoy the portrayal of Warsaw (the city I was born and raised in and which was leveled be the Nazis .
1046;SL, which I give 5 stars as well and make it a must see movie as well, is much more of an American picture.
1047;"There has to be a ""human spirit prevails"" and happy ending and some long unrealistic speaches etc ect."
1048;They look for closure and something uplifting.
1049;, some breathtaking and powerful moments and most of all great character development.
1050;Ralph Finnes role is a masterpiece of its own.
1051;He is so incredibly believeble and horrifying.
1052;The change happening in Schindler.
1053;SL pays more attention to detail, makes better use of terrain and supporting characters.
1054;All this makes for a great movie.
1055;Yet, a movie very much in a hollywood style.
1056;Definitely the best movie of the year (which means nothing considering the competition).
1057;Go see it and judge it for yourself.
1058;"Let me begin by saying that ""The Pianist"" is a well."
1059;acted and superbly directed film.
1060;One can immediately sense that Polanski put his heart and soul into the project (for obvious reasons, given his own life story), and this effort brought the best out of everyone involved with the film.
1061;however, here is where I have an issue with this project: I am not sure that this story is worthy of such an effort.
1062;themed cinema, some of which rises to the level of masterpiece.
1063;"Films like ""Sunshine"", ""Europa, Europa"", and the incomparable ""Schindler's List"" are not only visually stunning, but convey powerful life."
1064;Instead, he is aided by a few sympathetic Poles, and a rather out.
1065;Is it worth all of Polanski's artistic efforts to glorify?
1066;If you like war movies, you will like this one.
1067;do Schindler's List which WAS my absolute favorite movie about the Holocaust.
1068;"After seeing Schindler's List, I had the opportunity to visit a ""labor camp"" in Germany and it made the movie even more profound to me."
1069;I thought that there would never be a movie made that moved me as much as that one had.
1070;I don't know if it is that I'm also a pianist, but this movie moved me in a way that I have never been moved before.
1071;I had never heard of Adrian Brody before this movie, but I can definitely see why he won the Oscar.
1072;He did an amazingly believeable portrayal of Szpielman, his struggles, his agony, and his torment.
1073;Stories of the holocaust need to be interesting.
1074;After all, who wants to spend their recreational time reliving one of the worst atrocities in history?The Pianist puts a very personal face on the Nazi occupation of Warsaw, and walks the viewer through the struggle for survival of one man and his family.
1075;i distracted myself with the movie's excellent cinematography, editing, and music.
1076;Aside from the fact that I thought it was a well.
1077;He almost gets caught a couple of times as well.
1078;His friend then says she is sure that the example of the Jew's courage of resistance will inspire others in Poland to resist the Nazis.
1079;The whole movie itself is based on a true story.
1080;Overall, The Pianist is a great flick.
1081;This film made me feel quite emotional.
1082;the only thing that gives me hope is the absolutely incredible strength, courage, tenacity, ingenuity and resilience demonstrated by mankind when faced with adversity.
1083;Adversity at times it seems, brings out the best in most people ( not all) in terms of caring and sharing.
1084;Jewish pianist Wladyshaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is considered to be the most gifted pianist in pre.
1085;The Pianist is the story of Wladyshaw Szpilman's struggle to survive the desperate circumstances that Polish Jews faced under Nazi occupation, based on Szpilman's autobiography.
1086;The Pianist is a long movie, and it contains a lot of material that would not be essential to tell Szpilman's story.
1087;That's fine because the added length gives us a chance to see more characters, some very fine cinematography, and more of Adrien Brody's excellent performance.
1088;The Pianist is engrossing enough that its length doesn't produce boredom.
1089;There are a lot of minor characters, and all of the film's performances are impressive.
1090;"I highly recommend ""The Pianist"" for its incredible story of perseverance, great performances, beautiful cinematography, and inspiring tribute to the power of music."
1091;Adrien Brody was a Great selection for this very Gripping film about the Holocaust&everything going on.
1092;i Finally got to see it in all the way through&was very moved.
1093;roman Polanski did a Great Job.
1094;I love the cinema of Roman Polanksi,ever since I watched a lonely, paranoid and frustrated Catherine Deneuve's descent into madness in his masterpiece Repulsion.
1095;In fact Polanski's films were one of the first I ever watched and thanks to them that I came to appreciate cinema as much more than mere entertainment, but an art form of the most sophisticated kind.
1096;he is truly one of the last directors/auteurs in cinema today,whose life,background and personal vision often collide with his fiction,to give us a unique blend and classic films.
1097;the Pianist is certainly his best film since since Chinatown,an EXTREMELY well directed movie,and of course it is his most personal.
1098;all the events that unfold during and up to the end of the war revolves around his perception and condition.
1099;this is really what the Pianist is about, and this is what makes it a fine film.
1100;there are many haunting images and unforgettable scenes in the Pianist, but the one I most vividly remember is when Szpilman plays a beautiful Chopin ballad for the first time in years for the German officer,hesitant and confused at first but then totally immersed in the music as if transported into another universe, an energy suddenly bursting that does not fail to impress the officer who saves his life.
1101;this was an extremely powerful scene!Throughout his career Polanski has chosen his actors well, so naturally it was an inspired choice to cast the wonderful Adrien Brody for the lead role,earning him a well deserved Oscar.
1102;i applaud Roman Polanski for his outstanding directorship (he definitely earned his Oscar).
1103;"The movie was very realistic and allows the viewer to ""see"" what happened a mere 60 year ago."
1104;I believe this is partially due to his own life experiences.
1105;"He had fantastic control over what appeared to be a high number of ""unnamed"" extras."
1106;The realism of the costumes and behaviors were also excellent.
1107;But how can I forget Mr. Brody, an Oscar winner himself.
1108;His character made his experiences a lasting impression on me.
1109;The movie is riveting from start to finish and the music so delicate, yet haunting.
1110;Roman Polanski has set the bar to another height.
1111;He is always directed great movies in the past century.
1112;The Pianist is a great movie and will be an enduring one.
1113;This was an excellently well done, and riveting film about the Holocaust, one's story of pure survival based on a true story.
1114;A must see movie to remember and reflect on our humanity.
1115;The Pianist achieves a kind of intimacy with its subject that other similar films cannot boast.
1116;but it's this kind of emotional intensity that make it all the more worthwhile.
1117;Admitedly these parts can get a little slow, but they're worthwhile for the conclusion, which couldn't have come about without these parts and it's certainly brave of Polanski (and typical) for him not to flinch at any part of Szpilman's memoirs.
1118;the final moments though, are just sublime.
1119;Starving in an abandoned house Szpilman is finally discovered by a sympathetic German officer, and these scenes really burn a deep impression into your memory.
1120;Put simpy, this deserved every award it won, and then some.
1121;The Pianist is a film that should be viewed by all.
1122;This film is an absolute classic.
1123;I keep hoping for the best.
1124;It was an outstanding film.
1125;You can tell that a large amount of love was devoted from all who were involved providing the audience with one of the few perfect films.
1126;Adrien Brody has brought a new level of talent to the film industry.
1127;He has set a standard that those in the business need to study.
1128;Every year I watch a number of so called Academy films.
1129;Great movies are to have a special aspect setting them apart from all the rest.
1130;The Pianist achieved all this and more.
1131;If you have the time look up the number of awards won by The Pianist.
1132;The story of his survival is amazing, one could say almost miraculous.
1133;loving rednecks who claim Brody's character is a coward.
1134;people's head of saying what I believe a movie is about.
1135;I have a soft heart.
1136;this is a bit of a tear jerker and it is sobering and might make you feel uncomfortable at times.
1137;Open up those peepers, people.
1138;He is both lucky and unlucky in how how he ultimately survives while watching his entire family be exterminated.
1139;He must watch as his family is herded into railroad cars .
1140;the beautiful finale of the Pianist pounding out a gentle, turbulent, furious, hopeful selection of music (on the piano, of course) conveys what he went through in a profound way.
1141;But his talent and passion overcomes the physical and he plays his sorrow and desperation for a very unique audience.
1142;the movie does illustrate that quite well.
1143;Instead of participating in the Warsaw Uprising, the brave piano player hides.
1144;Schindler's List is a far better movie of personal triumph and real heroism in the face of the Holocaust.
1145;I thoroughly enjoyed it and it was very eye opening.
1146;surely the most deserving Oscar award in years was bestowed on Adrien Brody who captures his character completely and carries the film with his amazingly real performance.
1147;His role is the focal point throughout most of the action.
1148;so perfect in his characterization that he makes the story an unforgettable and deeply moving experience.
1149;his confrontation with a Nazi officer who discovers his hiding place and then asks him to prove that he is a pianist by playing the piano, is just one of the memorable highlights.
1150;roman Polanski's direction is masterful throughout, never allowing the story to bog down in sentimentality but keeping the focus on survival and some of the horrific things that happen along the way.
1151;provoking piece of filmmaking that is stunning to watch because it is so real and moving.
1152;highly recommended for mature audiences.
1153;I loved this movie, an epic saga of human endurance and sacrifice.
1154;The main actors ineptitude and lethargy at times was frustrating, but it is a true story, and remarkable none the less.
1155;my wife, 13 year old son and 10 year old daughter enjoyed it also, I highly recommend it.
1156;There were far better movies (directors and actors) during 2002.
1157;disc special edition, Canada), only French subtitles.
1158;B O R I N G!
1159;Think of the true American heroes on that flight who decided that it was better to die than to allow terrorists to kill other innocent people.
1160;surveyed 'darkest hour''s) has delivered a curiously affected, slovenly piece.
1161;All the sketched outlines of an outstanding film are present and accounted for: galvanising (if overly familiar) backdrop, a strong central perspective and experiential trajectory (in the form of Szpilman's tenacious, determined character), excellent production values.
1162;the main problem with this film, most puzzlingly (read: alarmingly), is Oscar winner Adrien Brody.
1163;Hopefully Hollywood will now shift its attention to some other worthy historical texts.
1164;01.23.14 Beside being a Classical Music collector and a movie fan, I thought this film was one of tyhe best movies I have EVER seen.
1165;i have at least a couple of arguements why this is such a good work.
1166;A good arguement is the Look of the film.
1167;Out of doors location shots are authentic aND DETailed.
1168;Thomas Kretschmann's character, the Capt. Hosenfeld, really did exist and helped as many jews as he could.
1169;It took Israel a long time, but they finally honored him a one of the Righteous of the World an honor given to non.
1170;I believe he may, very well, be in Heaven, perhaps as a martyr.
1171;perhaps the best reason this is such a fine drama is this.
1172;His world is a bit of a fantasy place, yes, but it provides him a foine living.
1173;Nonetheless, it is a place of beauty, innocence, delicacy and truth.
1174;Creativity trumps destruction always and love, in every form, is all around.
1175;People in the arts generally are polite, kind , passionate, honest hard working and charitable.
1176;I shudder to think what I might do to survive another day, or hour or minute.
1177;This is a thought provoking and serious movie and I see it about once a year or more, evey 18 months, maybe, it's that hard to watch, but it is excellent!!!
1178;I highly recommend it with 5 stars.
1179;As their lifestyle is increasingly restricted by a rapid succession of actions by the Nazi state that encroach on their freedoms, the family manages to adjust to each upheaval one by one, until they must squarely face the inevitable threat the state poses to their existence.
1180;throughout this horrifying ordeal, Szpilman's gift of music brings beauty and tranquility to his surroundings, whether he is able to express it before an appreciative audience or within his own soul.
1181;once the two forces are face to face in the climactic life and death scenario, the futility and irony of the Nazi obsession with controlling and owning the best of everything, while simultaneously exterminating the finest European artists, comes to the forefront.
1182;adrien Brody's performance is mesmerizing and will leave you begging for an encore.
1183;I liked the film in general.
1184;It was an unbelievable story and Brody was terrific in the part.
1185;As a film, it has undeniable strong points technically.
1186;This tale put Brody on the map and is still his finest performance.
1187;You will cry but also of happiness at the end.
1188;He was given a chance to survive, and took it.
1189;This film accurately portrays what it took to survive in the midst of an Anti.
1190;I find it heroic that this man had the willpower to survive on the meager rations that he did.
1191;brody did truly an amazing job at bring Szpilman to life.
1192;His face is perfect for it, and he was brilliant in making us feel the weakness we feel when your world is collapsing before your eyes.
1193;I was nearly moved to tears when that German officer allowed him to live.
1194;That act and others, such as Schindler, brought redemption to the German people.
1195;Adrien Brody's perfomance was spectacular!!
1196;He deserved 110% the oscar he won.
1197;The directing oscar was very well deserved too.
1198;Few films have touched me in such a deep way, so i hope you all see it.
1199;It is one of the best movies ever made!!
1200;"The Bottom Line:The Pianist is both a harrowing drama about the Holocaust and its effect on men and a gripping story about survival
I:205;1201;The Pianist is an amazing film on all counts and could well be the best film from Polanski and his most personal work to date.
I:205;1202;The best way to describe The Pianist is by sticking Robinson Crusoe in the middle of a Nazi Holocaust.
I:205;1203;The premise is a simple one.
I:205;1204;basically the film starts with Wladyslaw Szpilman (An amazing Adrian Brody!)
I:205;1205;learning with his family that the Nazis are making decrees against the Jews.
I:205;1206;The buildup is powerful and horrifying.
I:205;1207;Seeing the world through the eyes of Wladyslaw is what this film is all about and Brody gives his best performances when he is alone with nobody to talk too or anything to say.
I:205;1208;sure the encounter with the Nazi commander at the end is a little hard to believe and it does border on the fantastic as if to create a musical plot twist for our pivotal character but then again it is based on a true story and these things did happen so it is believable in an unlikely sort of way.
I:205;1209;at its core, The Pianist is a survival movie about one man trying to last among the rubbles and ruins.
I:205;1210;At times it is surreal and at others it is devastatingly emotionally potent.
I:205;1211;This is one of the best films of the 21st century and you should certainly not miss out on seeing this drama.
I:205;1212;The set designs, plot, script, costumes, acting and action sequences are all on top form.
I:205;1213;For realism it is simply unparalleled by any film of its kind.
I:205;1214;Adrien Brody did an amazing Job!
I:205;1215;this really was a great movie, A must see!
I:205;1216;Excellent movie about the holocaust.
I:205;1217;Good film good actors great story
I:205;1218;I have watched this more than once and enjoyed it every time.
I:205;1219;It is mesmerizing and shameful how the Jews were treated.
I:205;1220;The acting is superb, and it is a movie to be watched and enjoyed and gives one food for thought.
I:205;1221;while beautifully filmed and really engrossing at times, the main character just isn't a character you can believe in or want to triumph.
I:205;1222;For this reason I give this movie 2 stars.
I:205;1223;series, or Escape from Sobibor) is a 'significantly' better movie than this.
I:205;1224;Just a series of happenings strung together in a semi.
I:205;1225;cohesive manner, centered around a very ego.
I:205;1226;it's simply the story of a European Jewish guy who just wants to be a pianist.
I:205;1227;this film is a bit of a sleeper .
I:205;1228;certainly not to the level it deserves.
I:205;1229;conceived, punctuated with terrific acting and brilliant cinematography.
I:205;1230;screen television, this will manifest an even greater bonus for you given the great film footage.
I:205;1231;i was so impressed with this film and the score that I also bought the soundtrack:The Pianist: Music from the Motion PictureHighly recommended!
I:205;1232;I'm not into heavy dramas, but this film is so genuinely affecting and powerful, I found it simply impossible not to be moved.
I:205;1233;Even with the myriad of Holocaust movies made, this one stands in solitude as one of the most powerful and unforgettable.
I:205;1234;Maybe its Adrien Brody's subtley brilliant performance, or the perfectionist direction that somehow elevates the whole thing to world.
I:205;1235;Myabe its the fact that this film focuses solely on this one man's experience, as opposed to a mass film.
I:205;1236;Perhaps its this, that so directly tranports you into the heart and soul of this man and this film, and makes you feel and experience these indescribably harrowing events that took place during the holocaust.
I:205;1237;or maybe its the fact that the film takes its time to build up to its wrenchingly potent conclusion.
I:205;1238;all I can say, is that you absolutelt must, must, must see it.
I:205;1239;THE PIANIST is a very fine movie about the survival experiences of a Polish pianist during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw in World War II.
I:205;1240;The film contains many memorable scenes reflecting both the worst and best of humanity under extremely trying conditions.
I:205;1241;The German officer seems mesmerized by the music and grateful to be able to experience such a pleasant interlude in the midst of the horrors of war.
I:205;1242;Oscars were won by Adrien Brody for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Roman Polanski for Best Director.
I:205;1243;Ronald Harwood won an Academy Award as well for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published.
I:205;1244;In addition, Polanski won a Golden Palm for this motion picture at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.
I:205;1245;the actors are wonderfully played and cast but Adrian Brody gives what I believe is his best performance ever.
I:205;1246;Many times, conveying his thoughts and emotions without a single word.
I:205;1247;He gives life and passion to his character.
I:205;1248;This is also Roman Polanski's finest hour as the sets, scenery, and overall look of the film are exquisite.
I:205;1249;He gives the viewer the eyes of the characters, as it becomes you that's looking to see if the coast is clear while peeking through windows and cracks between buildings.
I:205;1250;Every scene is set perfectly as the early part of the film is bright, colorful and clean.
I:205;1251;Everything looks authentic and period like.
I:205;1252;The peoples clothes, cars and furniture, the soldiers uniforms, vehiles and weapons are all spot on.
I:205;1253;An excellent production all around.
I:205;1254;The standard disc is good but this one is clearly better overall.
I:205;1255;While I'm generally happy with the performance, it seemed a little too front loaded.
I:205;1256;The loud and soft moments are perfectly balanced to where you won't have to adjust the volume at all.
I:205;1257;The piano pieces are beautiful and sound wonderful too.
I:205;1258;this is a wonderful film.
I:205;1259;There's maybe a handful at most through the entire film.
I:205;1260;For me, that's important and makes it much easier to watch.
I:205;1261;If your interested in true stories and WWII period films, it's an easy recommend.
I:205;1262;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
I:205;1263;I like movies that are based on real life stories.
I:205;1264;This movie is one of the best of its kind, as far as I'm concerned.
I:205;1265;Five stars all the way, perfectly made.
I:205;1266;I was born in 1935 and grew up in L. a., CA during WW2 so have a keen interest in that critical period and have read about it and am collecting film commentary on it.
I:205;1267;This movie is a sterling addition.
I:205;1268;A true story, very well told.
I:205;1269;but I will only say that like the films about Anne Frank it has found a place in my heart.
I:205;1270;As all viewers would have known, this is a great movie.
I:205;1271;It is a personal movie for Roman Polanski as much as """"Schindler's List"""" to Steven Spielberg."""
1272;There were many poignant moments.
1273;Out of those hard time, we were also shown the generosity and compassion that came from people from all walks of life and race (including a high up German officer) to assist Brody's character despite the danger that they might brought to themselves.
1274;The movie never rushed and it gradually revealed itself like a great story book.
1275;It's about triumph of human spirits.
1276;This movie is just the right reminder for us all.
1277;"A beautiful movie that's ""enjoyable"" to watch."
1278;Szpilman plays a gorgeous piece and Hosenfeld is moved to spare Szpilman's life.
1279;He brings him food and when the Germans are retreating from the Russians, Hosenfeld gives Szpilman his coat to keep warm.
1280;It is the exchange between Hosenfeld and Szpilman that is the heart of the film and shows that despite the horror of war and the atrocities of the Nazis, that the true spirit of humanity can still shine through.
1281;Mr. Brody is incredible in his part.
1282;Never once does go over the top, it a truly genuine performance.
1283;Mr. Polanski also does a brilliant job of directing.
1284;Both Mr. Brody and Mr. Polanski scored unexpected, but richly deserved Oscars for Best Actor and Best Director respectively and Ronald Harwood won the film's third Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.
1285;in my opinion the movie is a masterpiece.
1286;He has tried to show the Szpilman's story (and, somehow, his own) as accurately and exactly as possible, without any fireworks.
1287;And that is why its power and impact is even bigger.
1288;To find humanity amidst the nightmare of insanity, and, the willingness to sacrifice so this single talented man could carry the truthout to the world with his music is truely amazing.
1289;But, this film touched me deeply.
1290;I simply loved this film.
1291;It's beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted and engrossing.
1292;There is a balance between beauty and ugliness in this film that is reminiscent of Shindler's List.
1293;I really feel that this film is Brody's finest work to date.
1294;This is a personal story and it feels that way, its triumphant and I enjoy triumph occuring in the eyes of a storm, it leaves us with hope.
1295;I really loved this movie.
1296;The suspenseful encounter between hated Jew and tyrannical German Officer leads viewer to think that the end has come for the resolute pianist, and yet, among man inhumanity to man, a feared killer brings hope and sustenance to the enemy and helps to insure his survival.
1297;It's a very very good movie.
1298;What a brilliant acting and a true story too!
1299;After seeing this dark movie I came to conclusion that humanity is still there.
1300;The Pianist is a heart.
1301;wrenching and intimate story of Wladyslaw Szpilman's intense struggle to survive the Nazi invasion of Poland at the outset of WWII.
1302;He studied Piano as a young boy and in 1931, continued his development at the Academy of Music in Berlin.
1303;He composed several pieces for piano and orchestra, and quickly began to be considered a promising composer and virtuoso, becoming very popular in his homeland as a result of his work.
1304;the camera begins to roll and we see the employees of the radio station acting out their daily routines with an aura of unsuspecting calm.
1305;Should he by chance encounter any type of pleasure at all, the moment is relished with extreme passion.
1306;"You hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away
I:205;1307;then there are scenes that are so callous they take you by surprise.
I:205;1308;the film's best scene, in my opinion, is a scene that occurs when Szpilman encounters a Nazi officer in an abandoned house.
I:205;1309;Devoid of sentimentality, beautifully directed, it is simply a mosaic of shots of Szpilman playing Chopin on the piano and the officer watching.
I:205;1310;szpilman's character is brilliantly played by Adrian Brody, who won the Oscar for Best Actor for this film.
I:205;1311;It helps that Brody has utterly mastered the art of acting with his eyes.
I:205;1312;roman Polanski produced and directed the film, and like Brody, also won an Oscar for this film for Best Director.
I:205;1313;The Pianist is an extraordinary milestone for Polanski, who himself survived the Nazi Holocaust.
I:205;1314;I suspect it is because of this fact that Polanski's film, for me, has an edge over several other holocaust films.
I:205;1315;The directing in this film is fearless, honest and it does not settle for easy answers"
1316;It simply unfolds and it is in this simplicity that lies its impact.
1317;What a relief it was to realize that great movies are still being made!
1318;"This movie is the best Holocaust movie I've ever seen and it will certainly invite comparisons to ""Schindler's List""."
1319;Both movies are epic in scope and bring the reality of the Holocaust to life in human terms.
1320;"However, ""Schindler's List"" was made, I felt, as a tribute to the risks that an ordinary man took and the difference that it made in the lives of many people."
1321;It gave us an uplifting message in a sea of depravity.
1322;It did it well and it stands on its' own merits.
1323;So many aspects of so many things are brought in subtle and in boldly stated scenes.
1324;It is amazing how much is said in this 2 1/2 hour movie.
1325;the acting is superb throughout the movie.
1326;Everything comes together in such an excellent manner.
1327;Roman Polanski certainly deserved his Oscar and I will leave it at that.
1328;There is much in this movie that earned its' R rating.
1329;It's becoming a near impossibility to find a movie that my son and I can watch together.
1330;a final note about the movie has to do with its' ending.
1331;"This is true in ""The Pianist"" as well."
1332;There is an interesting twist that, in any other movie, would lead to a positive statement.
1333;It is a statement consistent with Polanski excellent portrayal of the Holocaust.
1334;I would like to give a 4 1/2 Star it keep my attention the whole movie!
1335;I am a World War II History buff and this story is amazingly gripping.
1336;Acting is well done, visuals are extremely accurate.
1337;This is, in my opinion one of the best holocaust films ever made.
1338;It's right up there with Schindler's List and The Boy in Striped Pajamas.
1339;"Well to me Roman Polanski managed to do just that with his unparalleled account of the Poland occupation by the Nazis in this magnificent movie, ""The Pianist""."
1340;After watching this incredibly moving and shocking and sad and at the same time uplifting story onscreen, you would say that the most appealing part of it is that it is based in actual real events, endured by a polish musician (the real Wladislaw Spilzman) during the occupation of Poland, and written down in a book by himself after the end of the war.
1341;In the case of Wladislaw Spilzman, the love for music.
1342;A love that was also a way to redemption for the German officer Wilm Hosenfeld.
1343;Adrien Brody's performance was one of the most powerful and genuine renditions I have ever seen onscreen.
1344;This is simply put one of the greatest account of the events surrounding the occupation of Poland, ever.
1345;I watch this movie at the recommendation of my 15.
1346;I'm a little surprised that they would show something so violent at school, but I'm glad my daughter viewed it and thought enough of it to recommend to me.
1347;The movie shows the extremes of human cruelty as well as human courage wrapped in a beautiful true story.
1348;There is much about life and art to be learned from this film.
1349;And any movie that stimulates a meaningful conversations with my daughter, like this one did, is a movie worth viewing.
1350;"Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" finally brings some attention to what it was like in Poland during WWII."
1351;The Pianist is the sad, yet inspiring, story of one man's survival in Warsaw Poland.
1352;As Wladyslaw Szpilman's family is broken apart, it is one suspenseful and gripping tragedy after another.
1353;The movie is just filled with scene after memorable scene.
1354;this film is a story of survival .
1355;History is brought to life in this movie, although it is of a time we may wish not to confront, the fact this did happen gives the whole film a very strange feeling.
1356;The Pianist is one of those movies which holds your attention every minute.
1357;I ordered an extra copy of the film to lend to my family and friends so that they could experience some of the horrors which had taken place when Hitler began his goal to take over the world.
1358;The depiction of the brutality of the Nazis toward the Jewish population of Poland is heartbreaking and unforgettable.
1359;This film captures the range of emotions that a family experience as they subjected to the gradual increase in persecution that ultimately leads to Treblinka.
1360;adrien Brody is a marvelous actor and is perfectly cast as Spilmann the famous pianist who is the only member of his family to survive.
1361;based on Spillman's memoirs , the film is very accurate relative to the book.
1362;The cinematography is astounding, particularly the transformation of Warsaw to a spectoral ruin where Spillman struggles to survive.
1363;The movie is well acted, well written and shocking in it's realism.
1364;The movie is bracketed with the first and last scenes the same.
1365;something more must emerge from the Holocaust, something more heroic, something more struggling to do good in the midst of great evil.
1366;but it is a good movie, not to be missed.
1367;The Pianist is a Masterpiece!
1368;A beautiful and disturbing movie that shines a light on how heartless,and dirty people can be.
1369;The Pianist is one movie that will move you,and maby inspire you,that when you see injustice done to another in this world you will stand up and fight for whats right!!!
1370;he avoids fighting, relies on his elite contacts, and ventures out only when he can't avoid it.
1371;This film reveals how most of us would have gone about trying to survive: it required pluck and courage, but also luck and avoidance of danger.
1372;The acting is also perfect.
1373;also, the extra of Polanski speaking aobut his childhood .
1374;identical situation, is incredibly moving and fascinating.
1375;This film is perhaps his most important, for himself.
1376;rate talent was not diminished.
1377;This is one of the first films I will show to my children when they are ready to learn about the holocaust.
1378;When Adrien Brody received the Academy Award for best actor in a leading role earlier this year, I was at first surprised.
1379;Directed by Roman Polanski who also won an Academy Award .
1380;All I know about him is based entirely on Brody's portrayal in the film.
1381;This detachment from the world around him is evident again later, as when Szpilman, in hiding, silently moves his fingers across a piano keyboard, lost in the creation of music only he can hear in that situation but which the film's soundtrack effectively provides.
1382;polanksi's film obviously celebrates human survival during one of history's worst periods.
1383;Perhaps, just perhaps Szpilman's own emotions can only be expressed through the creation of great art.
1384;'The Pianist' is definitively an inspiring epic that celebrates the tenacity and fortitude of the human spirit.
1385;It is a remarkable tale of human survival sensitively brought to life by Polanski.
1386;adrien Brody gives an absolutely moving performance (based on descriptive facial expressions) as the Polish composer and pianist who stays alive as a Jew, and remains true to his ideals.
1387;Brody captures the character's desperation, his anger and grief, his willpower and perseverance, his passion and love of music.
1388;nominated for seven Academy Awards, this captivating drama went on to win three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay.
1389;Once Brody took the stage to accept his Oscar, he was so overwhelmed with happiness, that he swept the gorgeous Academy Award.
1390;winning Halle Berry off her feet with a long, steamy kiss.
1391;Adrien Brody did a great job of playing the Pianist in this movie.
1392;The music and filming was great!
1393;If ever a director was born to make a specific film, it's Roman Polanski and THE PIANIST.
1394;Winner of numerous international awards including Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director, The Pianist follows the true story of Polish pianist and composer Wladyslaw Szpilman's miraculous escape from the Warsaw Ghetto.
1395;A significant extra is the documentary A Story of Survival in which Polanski reflects on his own horrific childhood in the Warsaw Ghetto.
1396;This is a great film of horror and hope.
1397;This is a wonderfully made movie.
1398;It is very well done.
1399;the male star was wonderful.
1400;Every one should watch this movie, particular young kids.
1401;i highly recommend this movie.
1402;"I gave it a 5 stars because the acting was wonderful
I:205;1403;***1/2 """"The Pianist"""" is a bit like """"Schindler's List"""" as seen from the inside out."""
1404;who managed, through strength, determination and the assistance of a number of brave and caring individuals, to survive the horrors of that darkest and most inexplicable chapter in 20th Century history.
1405;For while this latest work from Roman Polanski is a fascinating tale of survival in its own right, the film lacks the moral and psychological resonance that made Spielberg's work such a universally acclaimed masterpiece.
1406;"First of all, Polanski and his screenwriter, Ronald Hardwood, both of whom won Oscars for their work here, capture the brutality and sadism of the Nazi regime with frightening candor and almost ""reportorial"" objectivity."
1407;"As in ""Schindler's List,"" people in this film die in very believable, very graphic ways."
1408;The Pianist brilliantly recreates this shameful era in recent human history and does so without becoming sentimental and pretentious in the process.
1409;adrian Brody won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance here, and he is very good indeed, especially given the fact that the role calls for him to be more of a reactor to the events around him than a catalyst.
1410;Polanski and Hardwood have provided this fine young actor with a veritable tour de force assignment that he executes with a great deal of skill and aplomb.
1411;winning Best Foreign Language film of 1965.
1412;As a concert pianist, Szpilman enjoyed the friendship of non.
1413;Once the war began, he managed to hold onto enough of them to successfully escape the ghetto and elude the Nazis or Nazi.
1414;The final half of the flick has Szpilman moving from one safe.
1415;The production values are incredible, and some of the sequences are just fantastic (especially the scene which touched off the ghetto uprising).
1416;Though Brody gives a good performance, he's hamstrung by the emptiness of his role .
1417;(She was a kid, and everybody knows that her story was NOT one of survival.)
1418;The difference between the two is that, Anne Frank's story redeems humanity in an inhumane time .
1419;the interaction between Anne and her fellow refugees framing a debate about whether all people are good, and that finally being captured by the Nazis ironically liberates her from a dehumanizing experience surviving in ceaseless terror.
1420;depriving Szpilman of much interaction to reveal his feelings (his Polish saviors are sympathetic strangers .
1421;The film surprisingly redeems itself near its end when Szpilman receives help from an ironic direction.
1422;This movie was very powerful, very sad at times, sometimes uplifting, and a seemingly accurate account.
1423;Very powerful, actors/director did a great job.
1424;Something I appreciate: it was based on the accounts of a man who lived during the time.
1425;This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen.
1426;It is a story well told and well depicted.
1427;That was a heartwarming incident in the movies, the prescence of one kind german during those times surrounded by thousands who were subhuman in their cruelty.
1428;This one man had the courage to make up his own mind and follow his instinct to save a human being.
1429;"Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" tracks the incredible struggle for survival of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jewish pianist in 1930s Warsaw."
1430;Towards the end of the war, a single act of kindness by a Nazi commander proves that there is still decency in humanity, and finally Wladyslaw is once more able to give the world his musical gift over Polish radio.
1431;This is powerful filmmaking, based in part on some of Polanski's own remembrances.
1432;I liked this movie since I am interested in the history of ww2.
1433;The movie was a well done look at a tremendously talented Jewish pianist and the trials that he suffered under the Nazi's.
1434;Tremendously lucky as well as totally talented, He survived the war to play in some of the finest concert halls.
1435;The Pianist WAS the best film of 2002, no doubt about it.
1436;A great movie is supposed to make you feel all sorts of emotions, make you experience things you'd never thought you'd experience.
1437;But Brody embodies his character so well .
1438;that he more than deserved the acolades he received for this role.
1439;Director Roman Polanski brings you back to a time of death and sadness and makes you feel all of these emotions as if you were there in person.
1440;the Pianist is a film that will go down in history.
1441;It is truly one of the best, and most affecting, films about the holocaust.
1442;This is a master work, if only because the director Roman Polanski makes us see through the eyes and fate of a single victim the horror of the Nazi murder of the Jews of Poland.
1443;And the picture given of loneliness among the ruins and devastation is desolation complete.
1444;ironically , the survival of the protagonist and his returning to play once again the classical music he loves in post.
1445;I recommend this movie for a number of reasons.
1446;First the story is very intriguing.
1447;The presentation Jewish life in Warsaw was quite heart wrenching, this was quite a good angle for featuring a story, very unique.
1448;I thoroughly enjoyed the realistic aspect of this movie (beyond that it was based on a true story) that was incorporated by the director, Roman Polanski's, personal experience in WWII.
1449;Secondly, the scenery and cinematography is well done and makes up for the relatively slow pace of this narrative.
1450;on one hand I must agree with the other nay.
1451;It amazed me the amount of work and detail that went into this film.
1452;this movie is well worth a watch for those who are interested in the human cost of war or those who enjoy epics of this time period.
1453;The blueprint of this film is the well known true story of a polish.
1454;One feels the anxiety, pain and hope of his family returning or survivng their fate.
1455;brodie is excellent and silently portrays this mans degridation, he seems to do this with great emotional resonance and a sadly beautiful, wasting physicality.
1456;the support cast are amazing, Fox as the central source of aid is emotive and couragoues.
1457;Brilliant and a MUST see.
1458;It was emotional yet funny at times, yet still really sad.
1459;The story was just incredible and made me want to see it again.
1460;The movie is based on Wladyslaw Szpilman's real life experience in the midst of torment of World War II.
1461;this is one of those movies which makes one speechless after watching it.
1462;He survives for the sake of his music.
1463;What an incredibly brave thing!
1464;After he has finished playing, the Nazi decides to leave him alone in hiding, for the music is so beautiful.
1465;This movie captures the very essence of what the Jewish people went through during the Nazi occupation.
1466;I am a big history buff and this film was very accurate.
1467;It was a very well done film, and I would advise anyone to see it, whether or not they know anything about the Holocaust or WWII.
1468;Adrian Brody, who plays the pianist, certainly deserved the Best Actor Oscar for his performace.
1469;It was simply stunning, as was the rest of this film.
1470;This movie caused me tons of sorrow and I also felt compelled to read part of the real diary from the man himself, Mr. Szpilman.
1471;What it means to live in the direst of condition for the rest of your days.
1472;Stop watching Marvel movies, stop watching movies to entertain yourself, and watch this movie to learn something.
1473;Wladyslaw Szpilman was having a happy enough life in Warsaw in 1939, making a living by playing the piano on the radio.
1474;that is the story of this movie and it's a true story taken from the memoir Szpilman wrote soon after the war.
1475;It also owes a good deal to the memory of its director as Polanski, a Polish Jew, himself survived the Holocaust as a child.
1476;It's a wilfully unflashy piece of cinema where everything is extremely understated.
1477;The performances are quietly excellent.
1478;Brody's in particular is superb but creeps up on one only very slowly.
1479;It is as if Polanski wants to present these events as plainly and straightforwardly as possible and have us respond to them as directly as possible.
1480;For the most part this strategy pays off and the film is an extraordinary and moving experience.
1481;And in fact these scenes are the triumphant reverse of boring as is the whole movie.
1482;This film is always sold as a story of how Szpilman is saved by his love of music and it's hope.
1483;"in any case, this is an extraordinary film, certainly Polanski's best movie since ""Chinatown"" and a spectacular return to form after the altogether unremarkable ""Ninth Gate""."
1484;the music was just amazing, the acting, superb, and, I found myself so caught up in the story line that the violence hardly bothered me.
1485;The Pianist is a unique and beautiful film in that it tells the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman without marring the truth with pretense or bravado.
1486;The film, as a whole, presents a vision of world war 2 Poland that was painstakingly crafted as to give the viewer an idea of the chaos, cruelty, and reality that was the backdrop for the life of the protagonist.
1487;the cinematography is an achievement in itself and the film is historically accurate, in one scene even showing a Nazi cameraman filming the proceedings as the Nazis truly kept thorough records.
1488;It is through this journey that we become aquainted with the other characters in the film.
1489;These characters form the incredible depth of the film.
1490;they are more accurately sculpted as human beings with weaknesses and strengths, and their own dark sides.
1491;Wladyslaw Szpilman's family represents a side of Poland that was intellegent and artistic, with strong and cohesive families, the embodiment of what so many of us strive for.
1492;The scene of their meeting is particularily striking and beautiful.
1493;This movie was the very best, and is a must see for everyone.
1494;A true story that one will never forget.
1495;There are plenty of subtle, powerful moments in this film, but the best one is near the end when the pianist literally plays for his life.
1496;he has to play piano beautifully in front of a Nazi officer.
1497;that's quite a feat when you make a movie for a 21st century audience.
1498;Somehow, Adrien Brody and Roman Polanski make it work.
1499;You get so immersed in the world of The Pianist, you find it easy to put yourself in the shoes of the Jews and the Nazis.
1500;Instead of a history lesson, you get a portrait of people who lived it.
1501;the rest of the film builds up to the piano.
1502;playing moment, adding one small detail after another.
1503;the costumes and sets are so perfect, the film has a documentary feel.
1504;this is the kind of movie you'll want to watch twice even though you didn't really *enjoy* it.
1505;It's a testament to Polanski and Adrien Brody's skill that they've created something so special .
1506;a horrifying tale, beautifully told.
1507;Roman Polanski's epic film The Pianist is a wonderful retelling of the life of Wladyslaw Spilman, a Polish Jew and magnificient piano player whose career was cut short when the Germans invaded Poland.
1508;adrien Brody played the role of Wladyslaw Szpilman with great sensitivity, showing Szpilman to be a man of deep feeling who is witnessing the horrors of the war all around him, but doing what he must to survive.
1509;Adrien Brody was able to make the character of Szpilman so believable and human that I found myself near tears several times during the course of the movie.
1510;Thomas Kretschmann was also very good as Capt. Hosenfeld, the young German officer who provides aid and comfort to Szpilman after hearing him play the piano.
1511;While I was watching this particular scene I could actually see Hosenfeld being torn between his duty to his Motherland and doing what he knew to be right as a human being, and Kretschmann played it just right.
1512;in the end, The Pianist was a wonderful movie, and one of Polanski's greatest achievements.
1513;I highly recommend that anyone who hasn't seen it do so at the first available opportunity.
1514;This is an excellent story of a young pianist living with family in the Second World War.
1515;The scene where he is rescued by a Nazi officer is excellent.
1516;The officer lets him play the piano and the music is full of passion and pain and hope.
1517;It is a bitter sweet scene.
1518;this movie is a classic.
1519;The Pianist is Holocaust survivor Roman Polanski's deeply personal cinematic work.
1520;It is a film shaped by a director who has a special insight on the subject of his creation.
1521;It is a chronicle of a traumatic and horrifying era in which the human race illustrated both the limitless cruelty and kindness that it was capable of.
1522;"it is natural to compare ""The Pianist"" to the other two high profile Holocaust films of the last ten years ."
1523;"Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" (1993) and Roberto Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful"" (1997)."
1524;he just wants to stay alive.
1525;This minimalist approach to the story gives the film a rawer, you.
1526;The Pianist is about the Holocaust experience in its most inescapeable, starkest, and purest sense.
1527;adrien Brody provides an amazing performance that haunts the soul.
1528;His portrayal of a man who starts out as a proud and accomplished individual but is later reduced to a shell of a man who finds joy in an unopened can of food is stunning.
1529;Thomas Kretschmann's performance as German Captain Wilm Hosenfeld also is memorable.
1530;His befriending of Szpilman near the end provides the film with a powerful emotional lift.
1531;No doubt the Academy Award awarded to Roman Polanski will forever hold special significance to him considering it was for this particular film.
1532;It may not be remembered as his best work but it certainly is the best work he has put out in quite some time.
1533;But his portrayal was so poignant and his suffering seemed so real, I made an exception.
1534;The background music is sublime.
1535;If this has won so many Oscars its because it deserves all those Oscars.
1536;If you can tolerate being sad with the ultimate goal of feeling victorious and happy, it is a movie for you!
1537;I am a teacher and my high schoolers even loved it.
1538;One you should see and certainly one you will never forget!
1539;We have enjoyed it each time we watch it.
1540;We seem to get at least one main stream or indy flick a year dedicated to this.
1541;i'm giving this film 3 stars for three reasons (1) Brody, he wears that haunting look exceedingly well (2)Cinematography and (3) Polanski gets a point for DARING by following a passive character whose sole purpose in the film is self.
1542;I suppose he was destined to make this film due to his own personal history, but an Oscar nomination?
1543;It's interesting that he decided against one that was autobiographical.
1544;This movie is beyond inspirational.
1545;Adrien Brody was amazing and won his much deserved Oscar.
1546;Roman Pollanski created a masterpiece and also won a much deserved Oscar!
1547;this movie is a must see!
1548;It is the best movie I have ever seen in my life!
1549;Still, this word seldom qualifies to express the depth, in meaning of a movie as such.
1550;tHE PIANIST is one of his great films told at the pace of one of his bad films.
1551;Incredible is what I can describe this man's life story.
1552;What surprised me is the Nazi Officer's compassion towards him(probably thinking that it was too late in the game to shoot him or send him off),even to the point of giving him his coat(which almost got him shot when the Russians came to Warsaw),but still a great film just the same.
1553;I cannot compare it with Schindler's List, since I haven't seen it in its entirety, but I feel that it is worth every five and more of its stars.
1554;Here's a worthwhile video based on World War 2 Polish Ghetto .
1555;This video is well produced and enjoyable to watch!!
1556;The reviews hinted at what I thought would be an intimate and poignant survival story of one soul through World War II.
1557;his every movement, every gesture, tone of voice, his whole demeanor held my attention without pause.
1558;It has the historical scope and authenticity of Another Country and Reds .
1559;The widescreen version enhances even on our small television screen.
1560;This is an important film both historically and in our continued need to self.
1561;what makes the film so oddly compelling is Adrien Brody's silent performance.
1562;also interesting to me as a music lover was the subtext of music transcending race and nationality, even between a Nazi and a Jew.
1563;A commendable piece of filmmaking, although ultimately not quite as powerful as Schindler's List.
1564;Q: What was the specific appeal here?In this case I wanted to feel that I was being honest with myself.
1565;But what's important is that I move me, the journey would be less interesting for me if I didn't.
1566;It was a huge honour for me, and I felt a great deal of pressure but at the same time he treated me with a great respect and regard to my work.
1567;As opposed to acting as if I was playing the piano, I started to not only know the notes but control the levels of emotion and the subtlety within the music which gave me a greater understanding of the story within the music.
1568;I wanted to know the desperation that comes with hunger, and also it was very important to Roman that there was a very clear difference in my physical appearance.
1569;It felt terrible, but it looked good.
1570;And in doing that it became very real.
1571;With each take I had to eat a tremendous amount of this sausage, and I was literally sick because my body couldn't metabolise it.
1572;I'd like some romance at some point, if it was well written.
1573;I don't like to suffer but somehow I find some kind of greater connection to the work when I do.
1574;It's man's triumph over evil,man's willingness to survive with help from a few friends.
1575;this is an excellent movie.
1576;Even though it is long, the storyline moves along well and keeps you interested.
1577;But it did and the violence such as you see here continues to go on in various places around the world .
1578;The Pianist (2002) was directed by Roman Polanski and earned several Academy Awards including Best Actor (Adrien Brody), Best Screenplay, and Best Director.
1579;It was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, and Best Costume Design.
1580;In the summer of 1942, most of the ghetto inhabitants including the Szpilmans are loaded onto trains headed for the Treblinka extermination camp, however Wladyslaw is saved by a sympathetic Jewish policeman.
1581;"The Red Army ""liberates"" Warsaw in January 1945 and survivor Szpilman is once again able to perform for audiences."
1582;this is a superb film.
1583;The true story of Szpilman's survival in the midst of the world coming down around him is gut wrenching and compelling.
1584;Brody's performance is a tour de force.
1585;Beautiful Emily Fox gives an extremely sweet performance as Dorota.
1586;polanski, a Holocaust survivor himself, reveals in the bonus special feature, A Story of Survival, that several of his own personal memories of the Holocaust are included in the film.
1587;The score, which includes several songs by Chopin, is marvelous.
1588;The Pianist is a Polish.
1589;Yes, this popular book is the kind of anti.
1590;This is a poignant tale of one Jewish man's horrific, yet ironically privileged journey through the holocaust.
1591;The protagnist is a gifted pianist from a well.
1592;Naturally, he has good connections, and so avoids the train to a death camp.
1593;Throughout this production we are treated to gentle, somber, yet hopeful piano music that touches any heart that has ears to hear.
1594;as well as to the succeeding generations.
1595;continues to be so powerful.
1596;bottom line: The Pianist is a solid and good film.
1597;It presents a powerful individual story, well.
1598;So, well worth seeing, but falls into the second.
1599;"A very powerful drama!If you like the movie, ""Schindler's List,"" you will like this movie as well."
1600;"it's about World War II and the holocaust
I:205;1601;Students in 8th grade can easily appreciate the struggles.
I:205;1602;Beautiful score, superb acting, and a plot that leaves viewers worried, hopeful, yet guessing in some aspects even in the end.
I:205;1603;The constant twists and turns in this movie will have you riveted to the screen!
I:205;1604;Incredible movie first off Adrian Brody plays yet another amazing role.
I:205;1605;The Holocaust is truly one of history's most tragic events.
I:205;1606;Adrien Brody plays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish pianist that is respected and well.
I:205;1607;He manages to survive the whole conflict, going from living as a recluse in an apartment full of Jewish.
I:205;1608;a true story of this brilliant and brave musician, who fought against all odds and managed to survive the war years.
I:205;1609;Director Roman Polanski is also a Holocaust survivor as well.
I:205;1610;His experiences helped make the movie more accurate.
I:205;1611;He poured his heart and soul into this movie.
I:205;1612;Although the movie is executed very well.
I:205;1613;Yeah, it depicts the Holocaust thoroughly and accurately, but to be brutally honest.
I:205;1614;He expresses emotion, but most of the time, he's quiet and helpless.
I:205;1615;And """"Schindler's List"""" focused more on the Holocaust."""
1616;Yeah, criticize me again, but that's just how I see it.
1617;"despite my lil' rants, ""The Pianist"" is truly a good film, but not great."
1618;But it is told as it was written in the book, and accurately portrayed by Polanski.
1619;There comes a point in the movie .
1620;i can't actually remember his name so you see how much impact this movie had on me.
1621;was actually worth making a movie about in the first place!
1622;There are so many hints that they are going to fight back, but the vast majority end in apathy!
1623;If you want to be entertained, then go and watch the Star Wars collection!
1624;Very focused, intimate, personal view.
1625;"A must see movie
I:205;1626;The movie shows a survival of one Jew pianist.
I:205;1627;Everybody should see this movie.
I:205;1628;Words can't really give it justice.
I:205;1629;onto the film then =)I'll admit I put off seeing this film because I wasn't ready for what I thought would be a very sad and heavy movie and while it is that, it is also uplifting, hopeful and beautiful.
I:205;1630;Roman Polanski shoots this film in a way that is very honest.
I:205;1631;This makes the movie much more poignant and haunting because your reactions are completely your own instead of the actor's and actress's.
I:205;1632;The final piece played in the movie is by Chopin and it was a wonderful choice because it is sad and hopeful at the same time, exactly like this film.
I:205;1633;i recommend this movie for all teenagers and adults.
I:205;1634;'The Pianist' is a brilliant adaptation of the book by Wladyslaw Szpilman.
I:205;1635;The book was written immediately after the war, and it has a lot of detail that is unique.
I:205;1636;It is one man's perspective, and his lack of bitterness is remarkable.
I:205;1637;Roman Polanski has retained the honesty and the detached observation of Szpilman while making the movie.
I:205;1638;For me, the movie made a deep emotional impact, and the book is very inspiring.
I:205;1639;I liked 'The Pianist' even more than Schindler's list.
I:205;1640;It goes straight to the heart, possibly because of the truth and the directness in it.
I:205;1641;is brilliant, and fully deserving of his Oscar.
I:205;1642;He is in nearly every scene, and he expresses so much without any words!
I:205;1643;Polanski and screenplay writer Ron Harwood have stayed very close to the book, at times including an entire scene, with dialogues and details from the book.
I:205;1644;It shows what went into the making of this great film.
I:205;1645;the music he played before and after the bombing of the radio station.
I:205;1646;This is a fine movie, hard to watch in some respects, but it seems to be a fine representation of actual historical events.
I:205;1647;this quite simply is the best film ever about the holocaust and Roman Polanski's finest film ever .
I:205;1648;I rate it higher than Schindler's List which is of course a masterpiece in its own right.
I:205;1649;I learned a lot about how the Jewish people suffered, and my heart goes out to them all.
I:205;1650;great movie to learn from"
1651;I'm sure she's going to love it.
1652;Very important story based on an autobiography book by Wladyslaw Szpilman, Polish Jewish great pianist who survived the Nazi rape of Poland in WW.
1653;Great and very talented director Roman Polanski who for the second time in his career went in the undermined world to make a point, to tell the real story which have been told before.
1654;But I have to admit director's talent.
1655;The ones who didn't care about their little lives but cared about real freedom.
1656;"i would of give this fine film A. grade, but I watched not well known ""The Truce"" few month before ""The Pianist"" came out."
1657;What a tremendous impact this film contains!
1658;Not only are we witness to the horrors of pure hatred taken to the extreme but we are faced to contrast obscurity with the beauty of music.
1659;this true story of Polish pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, will make you appreciate life and question your own character faced with having to survive such brutal circumstances.
1660;Well Mr. Szpilman did and this film is a tribute to a true war hero.
1661;polanski does an excellent job as director on this film by capturing subtle nuances alongside of the absolute horror to create a deep emotion within his viewers.
1662;Polanski also manages to convey the humiliation suffered by the Jewish people and not just how their lives were destroyed but also their dignity.
1663;Simply that he is stunning!
1664;His entire being changes throughout this film, at first classy and dignified he transforms into a fragile beaten man who manages to feel a simple spark of recognition for life that keeps him moving.
1665;My heart ached with every step this tortured man took and cheered beside his undying ability to survive.
1666;It will stay with you for days and hopefully for an entire lifetime.
1667;The truth is told in this movie and it must be respected and learned from because stemming from the bowels of hate the most beautiful music can arise if we strive to find it.
1668;is a good film !!
1669;Because it deals more with intelligence/dignity and the intangible human presence caught up in a world of madness .
1670;but that sobering activity is simply among the presence .
1671;the thoughts, the existence of innocent, literary, sane humanity within this flic !!
1672;Indeed a refreshing change to address the era.
1673;wonderful, reflective and very well done .
1674;I will say that I've always considered Chinatown to be Mr. Polanski's best film, but I now have to change that and put The Pianist at the top of the list.
1675;This film is literally his masterpiece.
1676;Whatever the reason, The Pianist is definitely an Oscar.
1677;caliber motion picture, while Chicago is only a decent musical.
1678;lock on the beautiful Halle Berry when he won for Best Actor.
1679;mr. Polanski was able to bring to life the cold harshness of war.
1680;dropping moment of pure movie magic.
1681;That grabbed you in the gut and made you feel a deep sorrow for what was allowed to happen.
1682;Needless to say, The Pianist is an extremely powerful movie with an amazing performance by Adrien Brody, who's in almost every single scene.
1683;This man certainly deserved his Academy Award, not to mention that delicious kiss with Halle Berry.
1684;I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed Schindler's List, or simply loves an excellent movie with great performances.
1685;I enjoyed this movie very much, and would recommend it.
1686;also watch the review and the director done a good job directing the movie the way it was.
1687;documented (and rightfully so)topic of the Holocaust.
1688;adrien Brody gives a decent, tortuous performance that has its moments.
1689;He is expressive in his silent observations of the world crumbling around him, and it's impossible not to care about his fate.
1690;the best scene in which the unlikely sympathy of a German officer saves Brody's pianist's life is truly touching, but the much.
1691;What makes this one man good, and the rest of them evil?
1692;good movie, and I certainly wouldn't recommmend it to everyone.
1693;I've read about the Nazis' incredibly harsh rule in the conquered territories of eastern Europe, but seeing it on screen is still daunting, and Roman Polanski's camera is there to capture the physical and mental devastation that World War II brought to Poland.
1694;Those Jews smart enough to realize their impending fate and brave enough to fight back are killed just like the rest.
1695;That's why the famous late.
1696;"in the end, ""The Pianist"" is worth watching, even if, like me, you may decide afterwards that you have no urge to see it again."
1697;There must be a lot of politics behind all the awards this film got.
1698;The Pianist , on the other hand was detailed, richly engaging and incredibly sad.
1699;adrien Brodie was the perfect choice as a Holocaust survivor in this true story of the horrific nature of WW2.
1700;This is a well done, inspirational movie.
1701;Very good for the whole family.
1702;the Pianist is excellent in its super.
1703;realistic portrayalof survival told from a first person perspective.
1704;especially after he understood that his whole family wasexterminated in Treblinka it was that vision of inner beautyof music that carried Szpilman through.
1705;that and help from few courageous people.
1706;during the first viewing of the movie, I thought that some of the more graphic/violent scenes were a bit gratuitous.
1707;They went with simple, and it worked.
1708;This is a must watch!
1709;A classic in it's own right and I definitely recommend this film to all.
1710;My boyfriend recommend me to watch this movie.
1711;It inspires me a lot.
1712;So be strong and work hard now!
1713;In one of its most poignant scenes, the main character plays Debussy's 'Claire de Lune' in the middle of the ruins of Warsaw under a blue moonlight.
1714;It is a beautiful cinematic moment and for that reason alone I want to highly recommend this film.
1715;the Pianist is a film by Roman Polanski , the revered auteur of Chinatown and Rosemary's baby.
1716;Tragedy ensued even as an adult.
1717;At the onset of the movie, we see him as his sophisticated self.
1718;established artist, coming from a wealthy family, who is loved and admired by his own community.
1719;Also it was more sentimental, with its sweeping score and climactic developments.
1720;Everything that transpires in the movie is seen through the eyes of Szpilman (played hauntingly by Adrien Brody) and therefore the audience is given a deeply personal experience.
1721;events in our real life have the power to move us in a way no fiction can.
1722;Watching Szpilman's humanity being whittled down to its bare essence is moving because we recognize the reality embedded in it.
1723;Human nature can be fascinating.
1724;When faced with the bleakest of situations, one still finds a way to express one's hope.
1725;"I've watched ""The Pianist"" twice since it's 2002 release, and felt compelled to write a review after watching it tonight."
1726;"directed Holocaust movie by Roman Polanski, and the stellar acting by Adrien Brody [who deservedly won an Oscar for his role] makes ""The Pianist"" a truly memorable viewing experience."
1727;the story is based on the real.
1728;the brutality of the Nazis is very effectively portrayed .
1729;scenes of Nazi violence against the Jews are usually portrayed in brief but potent scenes, leaving an indelible mark in the viewer's memory.
1730;One particular scene still haunts me .
1731;There are many poignant scenes that are heartrending in their portrayal of human suffering .
1732;His indomitable spirit shines through in many scenes, especially the scene where he is asked by a German officer to play the piano .
1733;even in the midst of great hunger, and with fingers gnarled by sickness and starvation, Szpilman is able to play an achingly haunting piece that would have done a concert pianist proud.
1734;The Pianist is definitely a memorable Holocaust film .
1735;Though the movie evokes the horrors of the time it also captures the resilience of the human spirit under the most harrowing circumstances.
