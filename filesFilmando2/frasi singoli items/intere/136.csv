1;'After Hours' has to be one of the great classics in film.
2;paul (relatively unknown Griffin Dunne) is an anonymous everyman working at a New York office with cubicles and computers.
3;Connecting with an interest in the novel he's reading, she seems vibrant if not suspiciously dysfunctional, but her zestful overture creates for him the spark of adventure.
4;'After Hours' may not be Scorsese's best, but it certainly is my favorite of all of his works.
5;This is an excellent metaphor/portrayal of the hyptnotic mind control hidden behind corporate power.
6;"When ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" fell through, Marty needed a project to lift his spirits, make him laugh, bring back his respect for filmmaking, and put his dream project behind him for now ."
7;This is a small, probably unseen gem which demonstrates quite a bit of talent, some humorous moments, but mainly soul, rhythm, and excitement.
8;"After Hours was a surprise, because I think I had heard a joke about Scorsese and comedy, but he pulled this one through, providing classic cinematography, that darkened edge that was enjoyed in ""Bringing out the Dead"", and a solid character to lead us through the night."
9;After Hours gave Marty the inspiration he needed to continue to make films, and it is a little gem he should never be afraid of.
10;style waitresses, Cheech and Chong, Mohawks, and finally an aging woman at a bar who also loves, you guessed it, papier.
11;While it seems like the night comes full circle, the events that occur during the 97.
12;minutes are pure entertainment as well as pure Scorsese.
13;Dunne is reminiscent of a young Gene Wilder in this role with his passionate rants and witty retorts.
14;"Dunne is also easy to follow through this journey, as he is the quintessential ""joe."
15;As he gets wet, hit, excited, and nervous, the audience can relate to him.
16;He is perfect for this role, and his mannerisms fit with his character.
17;"Those surrounding Dunne also create their own ""oddities"" of the city."
18;Rosanna Arquette is mesmerizing as a woman with potential burns and non.
19;outside of the quirky characters that Scorsese has ideally placed throughout this film, the cinematography also is an element to enjoy with this film.
20;The scene with the keys was impressive (as well as added to the overall oddities of Dunne) as well as the scene near the end where Scorsese takes us around Dunne's office in a swooping visual treat.
21;Scorsese proves in this film that he can handle singular shots as well as full.
22;"His talent behind the camera isn't wasted or misused
I:10248;23;The fact that this entire evening happens with the dropping of a set of keys, the opening of a large gate, like a boy heading into manhood or to his first adventure is enjoyable.
I:10248;24;man the right amount due to him driving too quickly and his $20 flying out the window), and finally back into death (the swooping final scene) is highly symbolical of the circle of life.
I:10248;25;After Hours is a perfect pairing with """"Bringing out the Dead"""" with its focuses on life versus death."""
26;A side note, but well worth mentioning.
27;overall, this was a welcomed surprise.
28;"This feature has just as much heart, soul, and energy as any ""Mean Streats"", ""Goodfellas"", or ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", and honestly should be credited with giving Mr. Scorsese the inspiration to keep working."
29;If you are looking for a comedy, a late night snack, or a great project for your final film class, this is the perfect film to use.
30;It is often overlooked, but should be catapulted into cult classic status.
31;, amazing scenes, and characters that kept you glued to the screen.
32;I promise a great night out exploring the lonely streets of New York .
33;It is one of my favorite movies ever.
34;The story is so crazy and amazing.
35;Scorse it is a great director.
36;Very good story and well made.
37;"Griffin Dunne is quite good as the horny bachelor who does one tacky thing and spends the rest of a comically threatening night paying for it
I:10248;38;While this movie will always be little and not to be confused with SOME LIKE IT HOT, it is well worth seeking out.
I:10248;39;Its a real roller coaster of a movie, you wont stop laughing and afterwards you may never say what a bad day I had after seeing this movie.
I:10248;40;This is an excellent film and one my all time favs.
I:10248;41;If you like offbeat dark comedies a la Coen brothers, you will love this movie.
I:10248;42;Griffin Dunne is one my favourite actors, although he can overact at times.
I:10248;43;He is plays the frantic all around """"nice guy"""" really well in this film."""
44;which brings me to the commentary.
45;They shot the film very quickly and it comes through because there is definitely a sense of urgency that permeates it.
46;the end product is one of Scorcese's greatest and it is actually multi layered, with many allusions to the Wizard of Oz (trying to get home) and flames/fire (being trapped in Hell).
47;The way all the plot elements tie together is quite clever, something you don't see in todays films, it's all paint by numbers.
48;"anyway, if you liked this film, check out ""Search and Destroy"" also with Dunne being even more manic and over the top."
49;It is a good break from a typical route that many pictures are often taking.
50;man show, Griffin Dunne carries this picture from start to finish with a fine supporting cast with uniformly excellent performances.
51;After Hours is purely a Scorsese picture.
52;Style, evidently Scorsese's, dominates the picture by taking advantage of the script while allowing the concept to be circular.
53;After Hours is circular, campy, unique, and interesting.
54;This movie is one the best movies I have ever seen with Griffin Dunne.
55;one night in a coffee shop, he meets a young but odd attractive girl who gives him her phone number.
56;Once he gets home he gives her a call and is invited to her place downtown.
57;The ending is very funny along with a scene where he hides up on a fire escape to outrun the mob he's being chased by.
58;You'll love this film right to the very finish.
59;This is one of Scorsese's lesser known 80's projects.
60;It is an unusual film, to be sure, but as with all of the man's movies you will definitely be entertained.
61;The movie has many hilariously funny scenes along with some sad and even somewhat grim moments as Dunne wanders through a surreal late.
62;night urban environment, meeting various eccentric characters.
63;The film is worth watching just to see the hordes of well.
64;A pretty strange movie, but still a good one.
65;I'm going to write this review before I watch the movie again.
66;another MAD mind warper !
67;Boring but Rosanna was good to look at.
68;She is very underrated as an actress.
69;the story is quite simple :a single subject : a man is trying to go back home.
70;It is what the best artists do.
71;and this film is the opposite of Last Temptation: small, indie tinged and wickedly funny.
72;beyond the great editing and production values and humor which could only be Martin, here is the great part.
73;Over the top, sure, but something we can all connect with.
74;It makes the film funnier, and the events more immediate.
75;and I'll tell you, after some of the days I have had, I beleive every frame is entirely plausable.
76;AFTER HOURS is one of those wonderfully weird movies that I can watch again and again.
77;I have loved Martin Scorsese ever since BOXCAR BERTHA, and consider him to be a bloody genius.
78;Martin Scorsese was honored with by the Cannes Film Festival as best Director in 1986 for his brilliant dark comedy After Hours.
79;It is an amazing and immensely funny film which features an absolutely amazing performance by Griffin Dunne and great supporting performances by many up.
80;Bronson Pinchot gives a memorable cameo as an ambitious word processor in the beginning of the film.
81;You will love this film, especially the shocking finale.
82;Tops on my list of 10 favorite films.
83;See if you can find a younger Martin Scorsese as he plays a brief Hitchcock.
84;see for any fan of The Big Apple.
85;I must say this is one of my top 10 favorite films.
86;Every time I have a bad day, I watch After Hours, and somehow feel better.
87;I've looked everywhere, and dont believe it exists.
88;Call me crazy, but I love the movie as well as the music.
89;Any help is gretly appreciated!
90;I just wish this and The King of Comedy got more attention.
91;i watched this movie twice, and found it to be one of those films that is very interesting the first time around, but not so cool on the second look when the thin story becomes more evident.
92;Some movies are like that, mainly the ones which are wacky and the viewer is shocked at what he's seeing.
93;One of Scorsese's best movies, and that's saying a lot.
94;Griffin Dunne is brilliant in this.
95;So rich in detail and the cinematography is excellent.
96;And I LOVE the look on his face when he meets Horst.
97;As I said, this is a perfect movie from start to finish.
98;I loved this movie so much when I first saw it, that my first fake ID in high school carried the name Paul Hackett.
99;He is SO out of his element the entire movie.
100;This is one of the most frenetic, hilariously funny, sick movies I've ever seen.
101;I loved the so, so young performances by John Heard, Rosanna Arquette, Cheech Marin and especially Teri Garr.
102;There's even a cameo of a young Scorsese!
103;"I have no idea what Scorsese was trying to say with ""After Hours"" but it sure was fun to watch."
104;This is a great, dark, film noir, with Griffin Dunne and Rosanna Arquette.
105;After tackling heavy topics in his previous films, Scorsese made a departure from form and directed a comedy.
106;But even for Scorsese, a comedy entails a word processor's date with a nice girl turning into an infinitely Kafka.
107;"I recall seeing ""After Hours"" at the time and considered it to be unlike any film I'd ever seen."
108;Griffin Dunne is great as the harried lead and he is complemented with a great supporting cast.
109;After Hours remains one of the best dark comedies ever made.
110;the story weaves an amazing cloth of small, seemingly random events that increase in significance throughout the movie.
111;every time you watch After Hours you'll catch new connections.
112;this is a hypnotic, frantic, weird, fun, surprising experience!
113;I loved this film the first time I saw it.
114;"The humor in it is a concoction of ""everyman"" experiences and fantasies."
115;The setting seems ethereal and the main character's trial reminds me of Dante's Inferno.
116;dimensional roles (which really makes this movie what it is IMO.)
117;A film that all talented actors wanted to participate in.
118;paced movie very well highlighted by the music .
119;It is hilarious in a very dark way and makes you realize how easy things can get out of your control.
120;If you like quirky films, please give this one a try.
121;This movie is a classic and definitely one of my all time faves.
122;The dark, twisted plot is outrageous and wildly ingenious.
123;Dunne is perfect as the poor Regular Joe whose life is turned upside down in the course of one wild night.
124;It's one of those movies that continues to spiral every which way until the final hysterical shot.
125;Arquette, O'Hara, and Garr are all perfect in this as well.
126;There are so many unforgtable scenes in this film.
127;Even a quick appearance by Scorsese himself.
128;One of Scorsese's best and most underrated films.
129;This film is a true timecapsule of the 80's.
130;AFTER HOURS is one of those rare comic gems that actually gets funnier as it grows older.
131;loud hysterical, it may not be to everyone's liking, but it's definitely worth one viewing if for no other reason than to explore sheer filmed lunacy.
132;After Hours is a dark comedy directed by Martin Scorsese.
133;It is not only a departure in theme but style for this director, winning him Best Director honors at Cannes.
134;A must see film for a variety of reasons.
135;Fun with a group of people.
136;which you'll understand when you see the movie.
137;and the director talks more about the last temptation of christ and making that movie than he does about this one!
138;"The short film included that is sort of like a ""making of"" film is a real treat and well makes up for there not being a real commentary track."
139;A nice, well produced mini feature about the film.
140;Someone must have saw one of them and thought it was funny enough to include in this movie.
141;It is one of my favorite movies of all time.
142;One of the funniest most twisted films ever made.
143;this film is truley remarkable for it's intertwinings of absolutly everyone who comes onto the screen.
144;i think this is Scorsese's masterpiece.
145;"and ""Taxi Driver"", the horrifying descend to the real Inferno."
146;"amy Robinson, the film producer calls After Hours ""dark, funny, paranoid New York summer movie"" ."
147;I have to mention writing which is absolutely brilliant, considering that it was the first work by Joseph Minion.
148;I also want to mention the camera work by Michael Ballhaus, the German cinematographer who has made fabulous in their beauty films with Rainer Werner Fassbinder.
149;In both films, the nice guys take a trip that would turn brutal, bizarre, dangerous yet irresistibly funny.
150;After Hours does not get mentioned among Scorsese's most remarkable and memorable films but it is.
151;It is a great work of the master who has been always passionate about cinema.
152;The members of the jury in Cannes Festival were certainly mesmerized with Scorsese's inspiring directing.
153;They awarded him with the Best Director Prize in 1986.
154;It was quirky, otherworldly, and funny.
155;It's a good film worth watching and owning.
156;I really liked this film.
157;many other reviewers on this site say it's one of their favorite films, which I do not quite understand.
158;Yes, it was very unique, funny, and at times brilliant.
159;beat comedy, this one is certainly heads and shoulders above the usual fare.
160;As unlikely, bizarre and downright WEIRD as the sequence of events in this film is, I find it completely inspirational.
161;teri Garr is fantastic .
162;And New York itself is irrestistible .
163;I want to watch this film at least once a year, for the rest of my life.

170;Griffin Dunne is absolutely perfect as the hapless everyguy, and I love the supporting cast, esp.

174;in After Hours he found a project that he felt he could channel his depression into, and could possibly serve to help restore his former joy of filmmaking.
175;scorsese isn't known as a director of comedy, but here he proves that he has a special flourish for it.
176;As most of his films will attest to, Scorsese feels most at home when in his native New York.
177;Just watching the manic energy of the film you can tell that Scorsese was reinvigorated by the opportunity to make a film that steps away from his usual film type.
178;Included in the cast are Christopher Guest regular Catherine O'Hara as well as Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong.
179;While this is a comedy, the comedy is treated with a wry wit.
180;Employing some method acting to improve his reactions, Dunne gives a brilliant performance.
181;He draws the viewer into his performance, making you feel for him while you also simultaneously laugh at his expense.
182;At one point to capture the right reaction walking into an empty club, he walked a couple blocks to a bar, ordered a drink for everyone at the bar, and ran out when the bartender asked for the money.
183;He ran the entire two blocks to the set and Scorsese started the cameras the moment he stepped on the set.
184;In the end, After Hours was critically acclaimed, Scorsese won the Best Director award at Cannes, it doubled its budget in box office revenue, and in 1988 he was finally able to make and release The Last Temptation of Christ.
185;This is one of Scorsese's lesser known films, achieving more of a cult status, but that doesn't mean it's one of his worst films.
186;I highly recommend that you give this a try if you haven't seen it already.
187;It's a fun romp through the city, with a touch of danger and suspense that easily ranks up with the best of Scorsese's canon.4.5/5Be sure to check out:Armadillo and Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work!
188;After hours is by far one of the best neglected films of the last 20 years.
189;This movie is so energetic and hip you would have guessed Scorsese was 19 when he made this, perhaps he was in a mid.

268;Every once in a great while someone will make a film that is so original, so bizarre, yet we can strangely relate to that we tag them One of a Kind films.
269;After Hours is one of the very small handful of films that I would tag a One of a kind film.
270;This is a very, very funny film and I would have been laughing except that I was identifying so well with Griffin Dunne's character that it didnt seem funny.
271;This is a great film that is virtually unknown and that baffles me.
272;It is a work of genius.
273;I have to add here at the end that I am not a Scorcese fan, but he created a masterpiece here.
274;well filmed and acted and a wild ride throughout the night.
275;i can also recommend Wild Target for those who like After Hours .
276;There were perhaps 10.12 people in the audience.

278;there is such great use of irony in this film.
279;I went back a few days later to see it again, and took a friend who also would appreciate this movie .
280;We laughed until we were oxygen.
281;It is a very dark comedy, but a comedy nonetheless.
282;Sometimes the dialogue is so low, you really have to concentrate, but that makes a lot of it that much more out there and funny.
283;This is one of those movies you will be turning friends onto again and again and recruiting new 'fans' every time you show it to someone who appreciates this genre and has not seen it.
284;Uptown east side guy finds himself in an entirely new world, even though it's on the same island of Manhattan.

286;the result is a hilarious black comedy with great performances, including a cameo by Cheech and Chong.
287;Scorsese' pacing is breathtaking and right on the money.
288;One of my favorite moments is when a large group of would.

290;this is one of Martin Scorsese's best movies.
291;It is hilarious, well paced, perfectly acted and directed, and beautiful.
292;all in all, a hilarious release from Martin Scorseses that doesn't get the due it deserves.
293;It is definitely highly recomended.
294;highly recommended**Although highly recommended for all watchers, this is a definite must have for Scorsese dans, and those of dark comedies.
295;Before Scorsese made bloated mainstream Hollywood epics, he made quirky, inventive films that defied simple categorization like this one.
296;"Sure its a comedy, but it's not so much ""hilarious"" as it is fascinating."
297;It's very enjoyable to sit comfortably at home and be glad as hell our night isn't going like Griffin Dunne's is.
298;Can't believe this is from the mind of the Director that brought us GoodFellas.
299;Frankly, I can go to a funeral and find something that will make me laugh.
300;Like Woody Allen and Spike Lee, a lot of his films are about New York.
301;"Mean Streets, ""Taxi Driver,"" ""The Age of Innocence,"" and ""Gangs of New York,"" are all about the city, at least in a way, and so is ""After Hours,"" which is set in SoHo, just a couple of miles from Wall Street, but a world away."

308;At the right price this is worth getting.
309;a cult film groupie delight.
310;This film by Martin Scorcese is quite simply the most underrated and underappreciated film in existence today.
311;It is the story of human existence on Earth, exemplified in the life one one man and his travails on a fateful night.
312;Throughout the film, Paul keeps saying that he wants to go home.
313;This movie works so well on both levels, plot and thematic, that the latter is nearly forgotten or unnoticed by the average viewer.
314;Perhaps someday this film will be recognized for being, while not perfect, one of the most meaningul comedies ever made.

I:10248;320;type coincidence, this film is for you.
I:10248;321;This movie is a very clever gem.
I:10248;322;If you like to explore the city very late at night this movie is most definitely made for you.
I:10248;323;this day in the life comedy has everything youd want in a comedy.
I:10248;324;this,3 oclock high,vampires kiss,wierd science,the incident,and spinal tap are among my favorite under appreciated comedies.
I:10248;325;After Hours is probably my favourite movie of all time.
I:10248;326;It's one of the most original movies I've ever seen.
I:10248;327;All of the performances are incredible, Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Catherine O'Hara, Teri Garr, you're all brilliant in this film!!!!!
I:10248;328;I think the reason this movie is so good is because we the viewer in some way connect with Griffin's character.
I:10248;329;Martin Scorcese brilliantly directs this work of art, taking us into the underbelly of nightlife and all it's starkness and mystery.
I:10248;330;Martin Scorsese has, over time, given us so much.
I:10248;331;Not that all his films were/are great, as were/are those of any other film directors of his era or any other.
I:10248;332;Because hidden within this broad comedy are simply tons of individual scene oddities and unforgettable moments.
I:10248;333;In short, this is King of Comedy gone Twilight Zone, but that's all a part of its charm and overall success.
I:10248;334;While nothing seen approaches unreasonable """"yeah, right"""" suspensions of disbelief, through Griffin Dunne's portrayal of """"Paul,"""" a NYC word processor circa 80's green screen computer monitors, and pretty much a normal guy, the audience is from the first moments on, easily able to identify with him."""
335;And that's the secret of this film's brilliance.
336;It is a chance and strange meeting, but romance.
337;"hungry Paul eventually jumps at the chance to meet up with Marcie later in the ""after hours"" and soon finds his decision the beginning of a true comic."
338;Trouble is, for Paul, his strange journey extends throughout almost the entire length of the film, which makes this a true existential and metaphysical classic.
339;"Full of memorable scenes and superb directorial touches, and lots of laughs, even if some may be just too close to home and reality to lay within the fully comfortable, ""After Hours"" is a movie that if you get into it within the first 20.30 minutes, you will stick with it till the end because the whole premise is just so edge."
340;It is also unique in the history of all great films in that nearly every shot and scene is just about perfect.
341;scorsese throws in the kitchen sink here and proves his directorial genius at every twist and turn, utilizing various creative insider moments throughout.
342;Throughout, there is also a wonderful feeling of being stuck in some temporal hell, where some moments drag on and some are over in an instant.
343;Paul (Griffin Dunne) is the center of the film, and the viewer's center as well, as we see the comic, nightmarish, series of improbable but very believable in a way happenings, through his perspective.
344;One of many highlight moments of simply a great film.
345;Darkly, nervously, right on and laugh out loud funny.
346;"by all means, one of Scorsese's best, like his ""King Of Comedy"", not to be missed by any true black/nightmare comedy film fan from one of the greatest filmmakers of all time."
347;"If you like/love this, you'll love ""King of Comedy"" and vica versa."
348;cheech and Chong's last major film as a team.
349;A dark comic gem from beginning to end.
350;well written and well executed.
351;MUCH fun and I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.
352;"A ""time check"" is slipped into the story occasionally, and alas, dawn finally nears."
353;After Hours is an anomaly among the works of Martin Scorsese.
354;She gives him her phone number, and that night at 11:30 Hackett gives her a ring.
355;After Hours is a great concept, turned into a stellar script by Joseph Minion.
356;But it's the massive talent of director Scorsese and a delightful cast that turn that stellar script into a stellar movie.
357;known projects (by which I mean one which doesn't rank among the annals of the greatest films ever made), a comedy, no less, features some of his best work.
358;"Scorsese directs the picture with the flowing skill of Alfred Hitchcock
I:10248;359;Scorsese is obviously very amused by what's going on here.
I:10248;360;He transforms the amusing into the hilarious by making the many absurd turns of the film as plausible as possible.
I:10248;361;paul is an impressively fascinating character as rendered by Griffin Dunne.
I:10248;362;There's just the slightest air of eccentricity about Dunne's performance"
363;At the end of it all, we hope he does.
364;the supporting cast is very strong.
365;Their characterizations are simply wonderful.
366;Even when he finds a friend in sweet bartender Tom (John Heard), fate intervenes.
367;More Hitchcockian moments, courtesy of Mr. Scorsese.
368;After Hours has stalwart photography by Michael Ballhaus.
369;A number of shots are pretty as a picture.
370;The way it's filmed, with Scorsese's pitch.
371;like material, Scorsese's hand is deep in the project.
372;Likely he identified with his protagonist.
373;"(Scorsese finally made ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" three years later.)"
374;"After Hours doesn't deserve a spot among pictures like ""Raging Bull,"" ""Goodfellas,"" or ""Taxi Driver,"" but it deserves a lot more appreciation than it gets."
375;Black, black, black is the colour of this comedy from Scorsese, (one from his post.
376;Griffin Dunne is the poor schnook at the centre of things but with Roseanna Arquette, Cheech Marin and the brilliant Terri Garr involved there's plenty more to look at.
377;it's a testament to Scorsese's versatility that he still managed to make this work, even if he does have to enlist the help of Bronson 'Balki' Pinchot and ex.
378;Early Martin Scorsese movie featuring Teri Garr, special kind of movie with stars and producers early in their careers, enjoy watching these artists.
379;whoever casted this movie did a great job.
380;You will not be able to tell where this movie goes from one minute to the next, and Griffin Dunne is one of the funniest leads in a comedic film EVER.
381;Scorsese confidently let his story get infused with a continual line of characters and situations that feel so fresh I suspect there was a deal of improv done.
382;In some respects its similiar to Pulp Fiction, and just about as good.
383;scorsese shows us how in this great movie.
384;But also it's funny if you've ever been in a similar situation.
385;And it steadily gets creepier.
386;"recognized by film buffs as a cult classic ""late night"" comedy, After Hours features excellent direction by Martin Scorsese, and a great performance from the underrated Griffin Dunne (who you'll recognize from ""An American Werewolf in London"", ""My Girl"", and most recently ""Stuck on You"")."
387;comedy was never scorsese's strong suit.
