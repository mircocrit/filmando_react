I:8794;1;Bought this to share with my 28.
I:8794;2;It's a classic movie .
I:8794;3;The actors are much more comfortable in their roles as the movie progresses.
I:8794;4;But, having said that, it's really a fantastic movie, especially if you like a bit of history mixed in with your drama.
I:8794;5;She looks incredible and gives Lara some personality.
I:8794;6;the movie draws you in and like a glorified soap.
I:8794;7;opera with great scenery and sets, is very watchable.
I:8794;8;It is very watchable, though, and can make great Sunday afternoon entertainment.
I:8794;9;the direction,cinematography,acting,script and the glorious music all combine magically to produce one of the grandest epics in cinema.
I:8794;10;Top ten best movies of all time.
I:8794;11;very good acting of actors in movie.
I:8794;12;beautiful landscape and best Cinematography .
I:8794;13;i love the director and his works are the master director.
I:8794;14;This is a truely great movie.
I:8794;15;Doctor Zhivago is a gorgeous and complicated war and love story.
I:8794;16;Omar Sharif and Julie Christie are heaven together, they have intense and natural chemistry.
I:8794;17;David Lean directed this epic, he sure likes to make long movies.
I:8794;18;This film has lovely cinematography and an Oscar.
I:8794;19;Check out this classic sometime, enjoy!
I:8794;20;I greatly enjoyed this movie.
I:8794;21;Even though it is quite old, it was in very good conditon.
I:8794;22;Doctor Zhivago has to be one of the most visually stunning and daunting films to watch ever placed on screen and for all it grandoise and passion the viewer comes off as the ultimate winner.
I:8794;23;The story of two soul mourning lovers that spans from the revoultion up.
I:8794;24;rising in Russia to the most haughtingly beautiful dacha ride to an crystal frozen house that time has weathered as a symbol of Omar Sharif's, Zhivago and Julie Christie's, Lara ever enduring love are just heart stopping!
I:8794;25;Lean gives the viwer snow capped mountains, close ups of lover's passing glances and Omar Shariff and Julie Christie in one of the most sensual field scenes ever committed to film!
I:8794;26;But the main selling point is the path Lean took with the book, Lean recreates all the majestic steps and tones properly and not only makes the hours fly by but the pain and beauty of one of the last great romantic and intelligent films to last for decades to come.
I:8794;27;i love to see the eyes of Julie Christie in her color not in black and white!i hope to see picture of Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia in color in the yet to come blu ray book!
I:8794;28;Genius film director, Sir David Lean, created the masterpiece that is one of my favorite movies.
I:8794;29;and for 'zhivago' being my e. mail, you know it's got to be good!But, to end off, a spledidly delightful film for all time!
I:8794;30;omar sharif may be the best actor on the silver screen so far.
I:8794;31;the story is a wending mesh of joy and great suffering playedout in that ever.
I:8794;32;between this movie and lawrence of arabia i cannot decide which is the greatermasterpiece, but this movie certainly ranks as one of the best of all time.
I:8794;33;This is absolutely THE BEST movie of all time!
I:8794;34;The storyline is exceptionally well written with meaningful dialogue as well as being historically realistic.
I:8794;35;The cinematography of the Russian landscape during winter is astoundingly beautiful.
I:8794;36;Omar Sherif turns in a stunning performance as Yuri Zhivago struggling with forbidden love amidst the turmoil of the Russian Revolution.
I:8794;37;Sir Alec Guiness gives a solid performance as his communist brother also.
I:8794;38;I watch this film every year and it always leaves me with a lump in my throat.
I:8794;39;dr. Zhivago itself is a great story, with great actors, and that hasn't changed since it was first released in 1965.
I:8794;40;It is still the same melancholic, romantic movie that should make you share at least one tear in the end.
I:8794;41;If you loved it before, you will have enhanced music, much better and clear sound effects.
I:8794;42;I think the extras are really valuable content, if you loved this movie, you would like to know a little bit mor about it, so here you have it.
I:8794;43;The Two Disc special with extra footage/info about the story was great!
I:8794;44;Doctor Zhivago is one of David Lean's most popular films.
I:8794;45;It is a masterpice, and not only one of his best works, but, one of the greatest of all.
I:8794;46;"But there's something about that statement that makes ""Doctor Zhivago"" an oddity."
I:8794;47;"Many people refer to this as one of David Lean's ""lesser"" efforts."
I:8794;48;"To watch it, is to watch one of the greatest epic romances ever on par with ""Gone With The Wind"" (which I think is the greatest)."
I:8794;49;Yuri Zhivago played Omar Sharif is married to Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin) but is really in love with Lara (Julie Christie) and finds himself constantly thinking of her.
I:8794;50;I think Guiness was a brilliant actor.
I:8794;51;One of the best character actors we had.
I:8794;52;That is a mark of a classic film.
I:8794;53;"Doctor Zhivago when released was nominated for ten Oscars including ""best picture"" and ""best director""."
I:8794;54;"It walked away with five ""best cinematography"", ""best screenplay"" and ""best score"" to name a few."
I:8794;55;line: Not only one of David Lean's best but one of the greatest romantic epics of all.
I:8794;56;Great performances from Omar Sharif and Julie Christie.
I:8794;57;Its amazing that this wonderful adaptation of Pasternak's novel actually lost to the Sound of Music for the Academy Award.
I:8794;58;This is one of the most romantic films ever made.
I:8794;59;And it graphically portrays how the left.
I:8794;60;If you like old movies, you will enjoy Doctor Zhivago,amazing production and great performances,I would recommend this to all of you!
I:8794;61;Along comes a wonderful movie like this.
I:8794;62;The story is compelling, the acting is terrific, and the musical score and backdrops fantastic.
I:8794;63;The turbulence of a revolution, the idealism of a man of science who is also a humanist grabs heart and mind.
I:8794;64;Omar Sharif is terrificin this role.
I:8794;65;Doctor Zhivago is a grand historical epic, movies like this are not made anymore.
I:8794;66;This movie at least partly a romantic film.
I:8794;67;I highly recommend this film to the fans of older movies.
I:8794;68;It is well worth the price, for the fine acting, and the historical landscape, that makes it such a fine movie.
I:8794;69;"I first saw this great movie back in the 60's, yes way back then ""in the day""."
I:8794;70;Great epic film, great acting, nothing negative to say about this film.
I:8794;71;The movie was well put together and very entertaining.
I:8794;72;It is still one of my favorites of all time.
I:8794;73;David Lean is a master director who has brought Boris Pasternak's novel to life.
I:8794;74;He shows us that love has strong bonds that cannot be weakened even by the upheaval created by both revolution and war.
I:8794;75;Pop this movie in on a snowy day and revel in the grandeur of this wonderfully envisioned film.
I:8794;76;It is a wonderful Romantic Movie full of Action with great Actors and Drama.
I:8794;77;I saw this movie in the year 1979 and even now in 2013 it is worth watching Great Movie Directed by David Lean
I:8794;78;One of the best historical and love stories movies ever.
I:8794;79;and the restoration is amazing.
I:8794;80;As good today as it was in 1966.
I:8794;81;Doctor Zhivago is a film I really had to question even though it has stood the test of time and is undeniably a classic.
I:8794;82;the cinematography is breathtaking and is accompanied by brilliant musical scores.
I:8794;83;I see it as one of the most stylish films of the 20th century.
I:8794;84;His absence affects others more than himself.
I:8794;85;that's just the way I see it.
I:8794;86;Any character that stirs up a viewer's emotions whether it's love or hate is a job well done.
I:8794;87;If a viewer has strong emotions for a character it is the mark of a great film.
I:8794;88;Mixed viewer emotions for a character is brilliance.
I:8794;89;It is the sign of true portrayal of a human being.
I:8794;90;There are things to love and hate about all of us.
I:8794;91;That's why it is such a brilliant film.
I:8794;92;This movie is gorgeous, particularly the snow.
I:8794;93;And though I love Pasternak, reading his novel made it obvious he was first and foremost a talented poet, not a writer of prose.
I:8794;94;, but the end that does come about is at least significantly better and more conclusive than the dead.
I:8794;95;end offered in the novel.
I:8794;96;This movie is hauntingly beautiful.
I:8794;97;It has such a powerful storyline and it is set in a true historical context.
I:8794;98;The musical scores are unforgettable.
I:8794;99;watch this movie time and time again, without out ever tiring of it.
I:8794;100;The book packaging of the blu ray is amazing.
I:8794;101;It is very worth the price!
I:8794;102;Sharif is also sexy, and surely more powerful than this flaccid lead would suggest.
I:8794;103;I compared the prices to a few other stores and I found that this one was the cheapest.
I:8794;104;I would recommend it to anyone!
I:8794;105;This movie portrays with chilling accuracy the brutality of Soviet Stalinism.
I:8794;106;Even today, I am struck by the beautiful cinematography and the faithful adherence to Pasternak's book.
I:8794;107;What all can you say about a timeless classic.
I:8794;108;A superb cast's unforgettable performances, John Box's evocative production design, Robert Bolt's letter.
I:8794;109;perfect screenplay, David Lean's gripping macro and microscopic contrasts of the personal and the political, Phyllis Dalton's meticulous costuming, and Maurice Jarre's haunting score powerfully combine to touch us in our tenderest parts, and to leave us as thoughtful, and as hopeful, in 2002 as audiences were at film's 1965 debut.
I:8794;110;Despite this precondition Lean crafted, in the face of contemporary reviews that were either lukewarm or condescending, that most curious, engaging creature of film immortality: an enduring cinematic triumph that audiences loved then and go on loving now.
I:8794;111;though other movies, in purely technical terms of film medium, can be judged superior, Doctor Zhivago remains my favorite because, through brilliant interplay of the film's vast scope and intensive personal focus, it captures perfectly our human experience.
I:8794;112;For that solitary, compelling reason Doctor Zhivago binds us, and those who come after us, in its thrall.
I:8794;113;"The movie is fine, but this is not a ""2."
I:8794;114;Again, the movie is great, but watching the entire length can be a pain.
I:8794;115;Somewhere my love, there will be songs to singAlthough the snow covers the hope of springSomewhere a hill blossoms in green and goldAnd there are dreams, all that your heart can holdSomeday well meet again, my loveSomeday whenever the spring breaks throughYou'll come to me out of the long.
I:8794;116;"agoWarm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snowTill then, my sweet, think of me now and thenGodspeed, my love, till you are mine againTo this reader/viewer Maurice Jarre hit the perfect note when he composed ""Lara's Theme"" for David Lean's version of Pasternak's ""Doctor Zhivago."""
I:8794;117;in the novel Pasternak gives us this picture of Lara.
I:8794;118;She had a good mind and was easy to get along with.
I:8794;119;She was very good looking.
I:8794;120;"They leave the party and Komarosky chides her: ""Good heavens, Lara, what an idea!"
I:8794;121;"Her mother says: ""Lara you have to go!"
I:8794;122;And please be nice to him.
I:8794;123;"They dance, he kisses her, she doesn't resist and she says ""All right I'll do it!"
I:8794;124;Very well, he answers taking her into the billiard room and undoing her dress.
I:8794;125;Afterwards at home she studies her reflection in the mirror and smiles, clearly savoring the memory of Komarovsky's passion for her, and her own pleasure in what had happened.
I:8794;126;"subsequently Pasternak reveals Lara's afterthoughts: ""What an inescapable spell it was!"
I:8794;127;it is she who has a hold on him.
I:8794;128;And she merely wondered: `Does one always humiliate those one loves?'
I:8794;129;Both of them were pleased that it had all ended so well.
I:8794;130;In both David Lean's and Masterpiece Theatre's versions of Doctor Zhivago he is a young man, a medical student helping with the mother's recovery, and he is captivated by Lara.
I:8794;131;Lara is always at the center of the action either actually or by implication, and it is with this central theme that Pasternak uses his novel as a vehicle for his artistic, philosophical, religious, and political beliefs offered with endless details of the times and a huge cast of secondary characters.
I:8794;132;She arrives at the Sventitskys' Christmas party with a pistol and the story unfolds from there.
I:8794;133;After pouring over the novel, viewing Lean's magnificent film many times, and thoroughly absorbing the Masterpiece Theatre version, I find myself utterly enchanted with all three productions each offering uniquely delightful variations and dimensions for this marvelous tale.
I:8794;134;loved Lara is herself Mother Russia.
I:8794;135;Very glad to be able to stream this one on Amazon.
I:8794;136;Once of my favorite movies.
I:8794;137;He just got better with age.
I:8794;138;This is one of the greatest movies of all times.
I:8794;139;Julie Christie won an academy award for her part, too!
I:8794;140;Dr Zhivago is a fascinating love story set in the Russia of the Revolution.
I:8794;141;the book is riveting and I was doubtful that the poetry of the book would reach the film.
I:8794;142;She has had an affair with an older man in Moscow but Sasha forgives her and they move away from Moscow.
I:8794;143;He meets Lara in a field hospital.
I:8794;144;Yuri enters the town one day and they meet again.
I:8794;145;This second meeting is more than they can resist and they begin their love affair but Yuri is kidnapped by the Red Army to supply medical aid.
I:8794;146;the combination of love and loss set in this turbulent time is engrossing.
I:8794;147;You will love this picture if you love a good story.
I:8794;148;Like many other reviewers writing here, this is one of my most favorite motion pictures.
I:8794;149;This motion picture was very gripping when it was released.
I:8794;150;Pasternak is a very good writer and Doctor Zhivago was one of his best works.
I:8794;151;In the context of the Cold War, his novel and the movie it spawned brought a sense of much better understanding of the Soviet Union and the Russian revolution.
I:8794;152;The actors and the acting were both top notch and the cinematography is still some of the best around.
I:8794;153;The film music is well written and well performed.
I:8794;154;Following release of the film, the film music was immensely popular for several years.
I:8794;155;This film also sports excellent sets and costumes which contribute to the pervasive mood of the film.
I:8794;156;the film has many appealing characters.
I:8794;157;As in classical tragedy, many of these characters are capable and even earnest people attempting to do good.
I:8794;158;The wealth of well developed characters in this film reflects the traditions of the Russian novel.
I:8794;159;And, the film makers give us adequate opportunity to meet them.
I:8794;160;finally, the film and the novel behind it is a love story.
I:8794;161;always love watching this movie.
I:8794;162;The acting is great, perfectly cast characters, cinematography is the best.
I:8794;163;Captures so much human emotion.
I:8794;164;He really has enjoyed this movie.
I:8794;165;Indeed, absolutely no one was a more masterful film maker than David Lean, the British director of such classics as Lawrence of Arabia , Bridge Over the River Kwai , Ryan's Daughter and, of course, Doctor Zhivago (see my reviews of all these films).
I:8794;166;Lean's cinematography is always spectacular and breathtaking, for he had a special appreciation for how the nature of one's natural surroundings set the stage and influenced the dramatic proceedings.
I:8794;167;Thus, Lean characteristically focused his films on the ways in which individuals and their personal characteristics clash and meld with the larger social, cultural, and historical surround in which they are located, and so each film is a uniquely captivating study of the specific dynamics of each particular individual situation.
I:8794;168;Each of these films is also a well.
I:8794;169;choreographed and photographed excursion into the topography, climate, and landscape of the geographic location in which the drama unfolds.
I:8794;170;The eyes and ears are always delighted by what Lean displays.
I:8794;171;Omar Sharif turns on a wonderful performance as young Yuri Zhivago, by turns an orphan, poet, and medical doctor sponsored by the family he will soon marry into.
I:8794;172;All Zhivago wants is to immerse himself wholehearted in the life he has made for himself and his family, yet again and again he is forced by circumstance to serve for forces beyond his doorstep.
I:8794;173;In all this, he collides fatefully with the beautiful Lara, who is played by the very young and beautiful Julie Christie.
I:8794;174;In their love affair Zhivago finds the emotional inspiration and solace he has sought through all this but has denied himself for the sake of his wife and family.
I:8794;175;Against this backdrop of the personal odyssey of Zhivago, the events of the Russian revolution and its aftermath are brilliantly depicted.
I:8794;176;As in all of the Lean movies, the ways in which each character's nature, individual characteristics, and personal foibles project themselves into the larger social circumstances provides the focus of the unfolding story.
I:8794;177;the cinematography here is absolutely breath.
I:8794;178;taking, and the many spectacular action sequences and memorable musical score by Maurice Jarre (for which he received an Oscar) all contribute to make this one of the most popular and memorable films of all time.
I:8794;179;The cast is wonderful, with terrific performances by Sharif, Christie, Geraldine Chaplin, Rod Steiger, Tom Courteney, Rita Tushingham (as Zhivago's bastard daughter with Lara), and a number of notable others, including a small part by Sir Alec Guinness as Zhivago's half.
I:8794;180;By the way, the film has aged very well, and as a piece of history and as a piece of popular entertainment it is easily one of the top ten of all time.
I:8794;181;I'd forgotten what excellent movie making looks like.
I:8794;182;This is truly a classic.
I:8794;183;The music score is the best.
I:8794;184;It came is excellent condition and will be enjoyed many times over the years to come.
I:8794;185;This is a wonderful movie.
I:8794;186;I also enjoyed the 2nd disc which showed the making of this epic movie.
I:8794;187;So enjoyable to be able to watch it without commercial interuptions.
I:8794;188;Loved it in 1965, and still love it now!
I:8794;189;Poetry and his medical practice help keep him resourceful and sane.
I:8794;190;It touches the soul on many levels!
I:8794;191;It is still a feast for the eyes and heart!
I:8794;192;Director David Lean's Doctor Zhivago , released in 1965, was a remarkable drama which should have won an Oscar for Best Picture.
I:8794;193;It's certainly worthy of the Oscar title.
I:8794;194;it's true to the novel and is visually beautiful and tragic to behold.
I:8794;195;It is a film that honors love even in the dark times of the Communist take.
I:8794;196;The music is by Maurice Jarre, a French composer of remarkable talent.
I:8794;197;His Lara's Theme , the love theme of the movie, is poignant and lilting.
I:8794;198;The use of the Russian instrument, balalaika and other instrumental music is very dramatic as well as moving.
I:8794;199;Commentary, behind the scenes and subtitles are the bonus features.
I:8794;200;Here he meets up with Lara again as she is serving as a nurse.
I:8794;201;the daffodils and wintry castle look innocent and Impressionist.
I:8794;202;This film is a must have for fans of great drama.
I:8794;203;Amazing sets and costumes will only carry you so far.
I:8794;204;I first watched this movie decades ago, but it still haunts me.
I:8794;205;as most people say, this is an epic.
I:8794;206;Yes, but it brings us into the very heart of events that turned the wheel of history: the rise and the blind force of the masses in the form of Communism, which was rather inhumane and devastating.
I:8794;207;Beautiful settings, yes, with literally thousands soldiers fighting in the snowy battlefields plus poetic scenes of calm and serene countryside in Russia etc.
I:8794;208;There are also round and forceful characters representing various aspects of human nature interweaving these epic changes giving the story a lot of drama and substances.
I:8794;209;and the whole story was wrought up beautifully by great cinematography for one thing, and Dr Zhivago's poetry for another, and above all, by Lara's Theme played by a balailika which their daughter learned to play by instinct: it sounds so sad and irking.
I:8794;210;One of the best films I have seen, just saw it recently.
I:8794;211;Amazing story telling and a great film production.
I:8794;212;kinski's acting was very convincing.
I:8794;213;Omar Sharif delivered excellent acting.
I:8794;214;Already knew I would as I had seen it years ago and loved it then.
I:8794;215;It is definitely a much cleaner copy than my original.
I:8794;216;This was a very emotional love story.
I:8794;217;"I had planned it to be the perfect gift for a golf ""thank you""."
I:8794;218;Finding it on Amazon was great!
I:8794;219;The seller, my music, did a great job getting to me exactly what I thought I had ordered and shipping it promptly.
I:8794;220;The package arrived in perfect condition and I sent it on to my friend.
I:8794;221;This is one of my all time favorite movies, the scenery in my opinion is quite awesome and the storyline is spectacular.
I:8794;222;It was boxed beautifully, very well done.
I:8794;223;This movie is truly a masterpiece as was Gone With The Wind.
I:8794;224;Fantastic movie however it moves slowly at times (much like the book!)
I:8794;225;It is very good classical music but it doesnt seem to fit the soap opera style of film.
I:8794;226;Lara is the person in Yuri's life who inspires poetry.
I:8794;227;the cinematography is extremlly well done.
I:8794;228;It captures the tone of the movie in a way the actors couldn't.
I:8794;229;Every scene is highlighted by the great cinematography and brings the whole movie up.
I:8794;230;The best scene is the protest scene.
I:8794;231;It is almost worth it to see the wonderful cinematography.
I:8794;232;David Lean has directed one of the greatest love stories in movie history, which is found in the background of a much greater story: the Russian Revolution.
I:8794;233;ray presentation made the wait well worth my waiting.
I:8794;234;One can only say spectacular.
I:8794;235;This is my all time favorite movie.
I:8794;236;I love watching it over and over.
I:8794;237;the scenery is breathtaking and the clothing is elegant.
I:8794;238;I was extremely pleased with the fast and efficient delivery of this film.
I:8794;239;Thank you for the great service!
I:8794;240;I will certainly be ordering items from you in the future.
I:8794;241;I first saw 'Doctor Zhivago' at the theater in '65 and was immediately captivated by Maurice Jarre's marvelous soundtrack and the grandiose cinematography featuring the harsh but breathtakingly magnificent Russian landscape.
I:8794;242;For many years it ranked high on my all.
I:8794;243;time favorite movie list and I always looked forward to seeing it whenever it made a rare television appearance.
I:8794;244;finally viewing this long time classic again I have to be honest and admit that in my opinion it hasn't weathered the test of time quite as well as I had expected it would.
I:8794;245;The music is as enchanting as ever and the cinematograpy is certainly wonderful, especially during the winter sequences, but I now find it somewhat ponderous and slow in many spots.
I:8794;246;brother Yevgraf and Tom Courtenay as the intense revolutionary, Pasha.
I:8794;247;don't get me wrong, it's still a classic, just not as classic as I once thought.
I:8794;248;It's considered by the NY Times to be one of the 1000 best films of all time, and probably any movie buff would agree.
I:8794;249;"minute opening ""Overture,"" featuring bits and pieces of the various music themes played throughout the film
I:8794;250;Dr. Zhivago is a style of movie from days gone by, to be sure.
I:8794;251;In the ways listed immediately above, it's a good thing that the artisans of modern film have learned to tighten things up.
I:8794;252;This is the third time I have viewed this movie.
I:8794;253;I like it for its history and the love affair.
I:8794;254;The philosophy Beautiful things may kill you is sort of true.
I:8794;255;A movie that all should see!
I:8794;256;What people who love one another go through in the time off a country's upheavel.
I:8794;257;Truly a film that keeps you involved with the plot.
I:8794;258;I recommend it for everyone to view .
I:8794;259;What a love story, Omar Sharif is fabulous in the movie.
I:8794;260;So much history, such good scenery.
I:8794;261;The condition of the movie is excellent and we have enjoyed watching this classic movie.
I:8794;262;This sweeping epic of a film, Dr. Zhivago, does an excellent job of integrating a romantic love story within the world changing Russian Revolution.
I:8794;263;Like Tolstoy's great War and Peace and Naipaul's The Bend in the River, the film shows how the lives of ordinary families and persons are swept up in the forces of war, politics, and history.
I:8794;264;There is a pivotal excellent scene in the film, where Zhivago has come from visiting his mistress Laura and is returning to his pregnant wife when paralyzed between his loving wife and son and his duty to family and his deep passion for his mistress Laura, Zhivago's horse slows to a crawl.
I:8794;265;the character of Zhivago, played very well by Omar Sharif, is that of a sensitive intellectual, artist, romantic, who was born in a world of privilege and is now cast into a world changing world of revolution.
I:8794;266;Is it due to his love of poetry?
I:8794;267;Thus this romantic dreamer makes a very hard objective decision to live in isolation from the two women he loves and that love him for an abstract love of the motherland.
I:8794;268;zhivago is an interesting character for we are shown in this film that Zhivago undergoes one loss after another and in each case he recovers, adjusts, and continues to remain in contact with the mystical beautiful forces of the natural world.
I:8794;269;the films of David Lean are sweeping in their visual approach to storytelling and this film is a masterpiece of capturing the Russian motherland in the grasp of a civil war.
I:8794;270;"I recommend the film highly for the romance, the history, the artistic telling of a great tale
I:8794;271;For anyone who loves the epic and loves the love story, this is THE film to see.
I:8794;272;The sweep of this film is incomparable, far better and more emotional than ANY epic film in the last 30 years.
I:8794;273;This film (along with BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA) demonstrates the power of the medium.
I:8794;274;The cast is top notch, particularly Rod Steiger as Komorovsky.
I:8794;275;Maurice Jarre's score is seductive, captivating and above all unforgettable.
I:8794;276;John Box's production design is rich and opulent without being gaudy.
I:8794;277;And there is an excellent cameo by cinema's enfant terrible .
I:8794;278;It is a very good movie but you must be in the mood for a sweeping epic to fully enjoy it.
I:8794;279;pROs:Excellent direction, performances, and cinematography (beautiful scenery throughout the whole film)Obi.
I:8794;280;Love everything about this movie: story, music, photography, acting.
I:8794;281;would certainly recommend it to family and friends or anyone who appreciates a good romantic drama with historic background,
I:8794;282;A powerful, sweeping movie that makes a character out of the Russian landscape, Doctor Zhivago is about a man broken by the times he inhabits.
I:8794;283;"Zhivago, the good doctor
I:8794;284;the interplay between the main characters and the large supporting cast is fantastic.
I:8794;285;The use of Russian plains and mountains as a backdrop for the drama is a tribute to the cinematography.
I:8794;286;The music score is woven into the fabric, never overpowering the action, but amplifying emotions onscreen.
I:8794;287;Pasternak's complex story is transformed into an epic film on the level of Lawrence of Arabia.
I:8794;288;This is a sweeping, magnificent epic, and I can't think of a single thing wrong with it: great actors, terrific cinematography, beautiful score, interesting and intriguing story.
I:8794;289;Russophiles such as myself will adore it!
I:8794;290;My father was a history teacher who loved Russian History.
I:8794;291;I remember watching the movie with him when I was quite young.
I:8794;292;Certain images intertwined with the amazing music remained locked in my brain for decades.
I:8794;293;I finally decided to see if what I remembered was as wonderful as the reality of the work.
I:8794;294;I am delighted to report that all of it is still just as wonderful as I remembered.
I:8794;295;The movie, the story, the music.
I:8794;296;All of it is perfection.
I:8794;297;As I listened, as I watched the movie, I was flooded with wonderful memories.
I:8794;298;This is a wonderful movie!!
I:8794;299;I love the cast and the story!!
I:8794;300;The scenery is beautiful and it is a great way to travel without going anywhere!!
I:8794;301;I also LOVE the theme song, Somewhere My Love !!
I:8794;302;Some of the scenery is beautiful.
I:8794;303;And, Julie Christy is young and fabulous looking.
I:8794;304;I bought it to show my kids one of my fav films.
I:8794;305;the good points: the cinematography was fabulous.
I:8794;306;it is a gorgeous film to look at and I wish I could see it on the big screen.
I:8794;307;The music is also lush and perfect.
I:8794;308;The supporting actors, on the whole, were the best part of the film.
I:8794;309;the conclusion: fun to watch with a group of friends (with breaks!)
I:8794;310;Love the movie and now I have it in my collection.
I:8794;311;i like the value and the savings on this product.
I:8794;312;This is a masterpiece of cinema.
I:8794;313;He played the role of Zhivago so beautifully.
I:8794;314;I loved him and Alec Guinness in Lawrence of Arabia, and though they don't share much screen time together, they are truly amazing to watch.
I:8794;315;The resulting tale is one of love and loss.
I:8794;316;The story is so profound and we follow Zhivago and share in his love as well as his loss and heartbreak.
I:8794;317;truly a film of epic proportions, and one that has fine acting, masterful directing, and beautiful and haunting music.
I:8794;318;convert Robert Pasternak's sweeping novel Doctor Zhivago to the big screen.
I:8794;319;In achieving just that he produced the most astonishing film of his career and underlined his status as a truly masterful and unique director.
I:8794;320;this Russian epic excels in just about every department.
I:8794;321;The cinematography in any Lean film is impressive, but is more striking here because of the sheer spectrum of colours utilised, and the contrasting effects required.
I:8794;322;pasternak's novel stretches through all four seasons and certainly every imaginable climate so the challenge for directors of photography Nicholas Roeg and Freddie Young was great, but the results of their work are sumptuous.
I:8794;323;The opening funeral sequence with the falling leaves is unforgettable, the shots of sweeping landscapes give a real sense of the story's epic scale and the harsh impact of the Russian winter is beautifully yet brutally displayed in the snow covered locations.
I:8794;324;the acting is also impeccable.
I:8794;325;Refusing to mix with the actors after filming, Lean was always totally focused on the characters he wanted them to portray, and drew out of his cast their finest performances.
I:8794;326;despite the political backdrop of the Russian revolution, Dr Zhivago is essentially a love story, and it works beautifully as such.
I:8794;327;Lean's achievement is similar to that of the book in that he manages to create empathy for Zhivago's character.
I:8794;328;robert Bolt's screenplay deservedly won an Oscar for this film, but if there was ever an example of a film owing its success to the entire cast and crew then this is it.
I:8794;329;They created a masterpiece of epic cinema.
I:8794;330;the documentary is far more interesting than Columbia's one for Lawrence of Arabia, and when you consider that there are ten additional short films and an audio commentary featuring Lean's wife also included, the package becomes irresistible.
I:8794;331;Always worth the long play.
I:8794;332;Wonderful music, scenery and acting.
I:8794;333;It is also a good history lesson about the ever turbulent history of Russia.
I:8794;334;The storyline is mature but it captures the complexities that are closer to reality.
I:8794;335;a discussion might be a good idea if it conflicts with your values.
I:8794;336;Makes you feel like you are there.
I:8794;337;It is both heartwarming and exciting.
I:8794;338;and the scenery is fabulous and beautiful and splendid!
I:8794;339;In this masterpiece of Boris Pasternak you will find one of the most movies ever made.
I:8794;340;It has an impressive photography, leading you to wonderful views and helping you to get inside the soul of the characters.
I:8794;341;The magnificent direction of David Lean leads you to through a history full of love and pain.
I:8794;342;doctor Zhivago was a sumptuous, sprawling, epic about the life of a Russian doctor.
I:8794;343;And that is whats marvelous: you are not just an mere expectator.
I:8794;344;Probably one of the best in the history of cinema.
I:8794;345;Lara's Theme is one of the most remarkable tracks of all times.
I:8794;346;Where did they film that at?A true education in how a great movie was made by all involved.
I:8794;347;This is a great movie.
I:8794;348;I have enjoyed it since I was a kid.
I:8794;349;This is a spectacular movie, both in plot and the scenery in it.
I:8794;350;I remember loving this movie when it first came out and my excitement for it has not changed.
I:8794;351;I recommend it to everyone
I:8794;352;One of my favorite movies ever!!
I:8794;353;A good story, lots of history, beautiful clothes and home and a story will will wring tears out of a stone!
I:8794;354;After enjoying this movie almost 50 years ago at a theater, I had to add it to my collection.
I:8794;355;The acting issuperb with beautiful scenery and a heart rendering sad story of the Russian Revolution.
I:8794;356;Great story and gorgeous scenery.
I:8794;357;The epic length is worth it.
I:8794;358;The movie's physical aspects are spectacular where scenes of the Revolution come alive.
I:8794;359;one of the masterpiece to have for the collector of good movies.
I:8794;360;I wonder if that also refers to Picture meaning Movie.
I:8794;361;I knew nothing about it except that it was some Russian thing with an amazing train scene of some kind and some famous theme music called Lara's Theme.
I:8794;362;But knowing that it is a revered classic, I decided finally to check it out, because I am an avid viewer of good cinema.
I:8794;363;i think that the characters are well cast.
I:8794;364;Omar Sharif is convincing as Zhivago .
I:8794;365;He does have a funny way of twitching his eyes back and forth though.
I:8794;366;Julie Christie is good as Lara as well, even though her tall sixties hair is rather out of place.
I:8794;367;The cousin or whoever the girl was that Zhivago married (her name escapes me) reminded me of a girl I know and I liked her quite a bit as well even with the beehive hairdo.
I:8794;368;the story itself is very good too, but I won't go into that because the purpose of watching the movie is to discover the story.
I:8794;369;Another good moment was the weeping sunflowers on the army hospital table.
I:8794;370;But the suspense of the blackness is marvellous.
I:8794;371;Forget that I mentioned it so you will find it fresh and interesting when you see this for the first time.
I:8794;372;Oh, and at the beginning of the movie is another good sequence.
I:8794;373;Zhivago as a child watching his mother be buried and spending his first night with his new family.
I:8794;374;the costumes were brilliant too.
I:8794;375;I really love Russian outfits.
I:8794;376;The dark blue coat Zhivago wears near the beginning with the two rows of buttons is amazing, and the rest of his outfits are pretty nifty as well.
I:8794;377;I vaguely remember a beautiful red coat of Lara's with black fur trim.
I:8794;378;you could really feel her strong dislike of the outfit.
I:8794;379;It's very beautiful, but even the most beautiful things can drive one crazy when they chase and tumble about in your head incessantly.
I:8794;380;the Communists brought a great change to Russian life.
I:8794;381;And the children afterwards were taught to make fun of the former Tsar.
I:8794;382;well, I think I've about said a thousand words.
I:8794;383;Last time I checked it was 969, and after I've edited this, it'll be more!
I:8794;384;So watch this movie and have a lot of fun!
I:8794;385;Exelant movie, moving story with tenderness along with reality of life in times of Love and War.
I:8794;386;It's nice to be able to have access to movies that touches people from all walks of life.
I:8794;387;My experance with Amazon has been above the norm for shopping selection and service.
I:8794;388;this movie is, one of the five greatest movies ever made, in human history.
I:8794;389;but life went on nontheless, and this long and twisting story is redemptive and moving and completely worthwhile for its humanity and portrayal of bravery.
I:8794;390;boris Pasternak, the story's author, was born in Moscow before the revolution and tells of the tragedy masterfully.
I:8794;391;Omar Shariff performance conveys this human dignity flawlessly, with his burning eyes.
I:8794;392;lara, Zhivago's second love played by Julie Christie is equalled by Tonya, played by Geraldine Chaplin for their beauty and brave kindness in the face of their descent into sadness and sorrow.
I:8794;393;and the film is radiant, with stunning colors, facinating period costumes, and a good deal of symbolic and cinemtographic experimentation that makes the film much more than a shmaltzy epic.
I:8794;394;His best and greatest is Lawrence of Arabia.
I:8794;395;As an avid fan of movies, I sincerely believe Dr. Zhivago to be one of the best movies ever produced by Hollywood.
I:8794;396;This movie will truly touch your soul.
I:8794;397;It is a story about an ordinary man who overcomes extraordinary circumstances, and about the people he meets during his voyage through a revolutionary Russia.
I:8794;398;Overall, Dr. Zhivago is more than a classic it is a major work that is appreciated each time the viewer allows every frame to unfold more than he or she has seen before.
I:8794;399;"I've seen ""Zhivago"" many times and consider it easily among the 100 best English."
I:8794;400;It was my mother's favorite, she of Ukranian/Russian roots.
I:8794;401;review review of my great film.
I:8794;402;And, I've seen the movie numerous times since.
I:8794;403;ray version brought me back to the first time I saw it.
I:8794;404;This with such a compelling story make Doctor Zhivago as fresh today and it was 45 years ago.
I:8794;405;I, for one, am pleased that audiences flocked to it in all.
I:8794;406;It deserves to be one of the most popular films ever made.
I:8794;407;The grand scale of the production, combined with the meticulous attention to detail in every shot is utterly awe.
I:8794;408;With the development of home theater technology and the glorious new Blu Ray edition which recently became available, it can be viewed with dazzling clarity on giant screens.
I:8794;409;When seen this way by discerning viewers, it will seem to move a lot faster.
I:8794;410;The reason for this is simple.
I:8794;411;I have found numerous comments online by those who find this Blu Ray remastering to be, in one way or another, disappointing.
I:8794;412;The new version is marvelous!
I:8794;413;I've seen dozens of epic scale movies, boasting casts of thousands, but never a single one that demonstrated such meticulous and tasteful devotion to perfecting every detail.
I:8794;414;For just one example, watch carefully the treatment of the funeral of Yuri's mother.
I:8794;415;ago period in time, amounts to such a gift to lovers of great motion pictures as can never be repaid.
I:8794;416;David Lean has to be regarded as one of the greatest director's of all.
I:8794;417;"His skill as a director compensates for the sappier elements of ""Doctor Zhivago""."
I:8794;418;There is such richness of detail in this film.
I:8794;419;The art direction, cinematography, the classic score by Maurice Jarre are all first.
I:8794;420;What detracts from the film are the nominal stars of this film and the central love story.
I:8794;421;"Now this style may have served her well in ""Darling"", the film she won the Oscar for, but we are supposed to be empathetic to her character."
I:8794;422;That said, I recommend this film for the richness of the production values.
I:8794;423;as I mentioned above, the production values are excellent and director David Lean certainly knows how to frame a shot.
I:8794;424;If the film were shorter, these merits would elevate it to three stars in my eyes.
I:8794;425;It was during a very hot summer in Des Moines that Zhivago played at the best equipped cinema in town, the Ingersoll.
I:8794;426;Though my body thawed on the bus ride back home, my heart held fast to the film I had experienced.
I:8794;427;just watch it, without a snide side.
I:8794;428;Allow this wonderful film to fill you with it's sweep and emotions intact.
I:8794;429;Lean is a cinematic god.
I:8794;430;this is a beautiful and haunting film.
I:8794;431;it also shows one era of history that has been a fascinating one to me, the russian revolution.
I:8794;432;i think it will be a while yet before we realize just how influential that revolution was to the history of the world.
I:8794;433;plus this movie has some of the most beautiful music composed for the big screen.
I:8794;434;This movie will keep you up until it is finished, A wonderful story, a must have for your film library if you like Historical Romance movies.
I:8794;435;This classic movie is in a category of it's own.
I:8794;436;The scenery alone is worth watching it.
I:8794;437;It is a wonderful story.
I:8794;438;There are several little plots within the big story, each very well done.
I:8794;439;Julie Christie is absolutely breathtaking she is so beautiful.
I:8794;440;It is a good reminder about how much freedom we have here, how lucky we are.
I:8794;441;But, when I watched it on the computer,it seemed like it brought it to life right in front of me, and I was totally involved in it, and felt every tear, all the emotionsthe characters brought with their love, heard every shot, every step of their boots, every snowflake drop.
I:8794;442;What a movie, evenfor the 10th viewing.
I:8794;443;Omar Sharif incredible in his part.
I:8794;444;She was beautiful and charismatic.
I:8794;445;It is the most beautiful love story ever,and the scenery and music adds even more flair to it.
I:8794;446;Everyone should watch this epic, historical, love story.
I:8794;447;Doctor Zhivago is a romantic idealist whose chosen profession becomes a bane to his existence and true happiness and whose eyes well up with sensitivity at human suffering.
I:8794;448;"zhivago's only lapse in honor comes as a result of love and passion
I:8794;449;i love the score, which soars up and down emotionally.
I:8794;450;I am a great fan of David Lean's 'Lawrence of Arabia' so epic type movies appeal to me.
I:8794;451;What a glorious movie this is.
I:8794;452;The colour, the scenery, the grandeur, the action, the love story, the scope and the spectacle.
I:8794;453;This truly is an epic movie made and acted with passion.
I:8794;454;What an absolutely outstanding package which does credit to one of the all.
I:8794;455;What a wonderful, romantic, set your heart on fire, time piece of a movie.
I:8794;456;I have always loved this movie and this particular edition is spectacular.
I:8794;457;Really great extras along with the movie itself.
I:8794;458;David Lean knew how to tell stories, create images without computer graphics, and to bring actors together in a vision.
I:8794;459;A word on the lead actors: in addition to having good looks, they also have presence, charisma, and talent.
I:8794;460;Yes, watch this twice before you watchGladiator and similar products even once.
I:8794;461;David's attention to every aspect of the film media is still amazing to see.
I:8794;462;Omar was electric on the screen and the love between the principle characters moved off the film and into the heart.
I:8794;463;This is one of the top love stories of all time set against the backdrop of the turmoil that made Russia what it is today.
I:8794;464;Step back to a time of great luxury, surrounded by poverty, this film portrays the rise of the poor, a revolution, and the birth of Communism, intertwined with a passionate love story.
I:8794;465;This film captivates the viewer with incredible costumes and scenery.
I:8794;466;This film is a classic and I am very pleased to add this to my collection.
I:8794;467;Doctor Zhivago is a great movie, has beautiful scenery and music, and is a piece of history that it is never a waste to watch it.
I:8794;468;riding passions fueling the lives of the people involved, and the great love affair will always fill the heart and inspire greatness.
I:8794;469;This was the best of the best, I had seen the movie many years ago, but still love it.
I:8794;470;A classic movie with passion, poignancy, historical significance, amazing scenery, conflict of soul and heart.
I:8794;471;The picture is only subtly better than on the laserdisc, perhaps partly because it was viewed on a progressive.
I:8794;472;the foregoing points plus the exhaustive, high.
I:8794;473;They were much poorer for it as this story truly was a masterpiece.
I:8794;474;If anyone is left out there in movieland still exists who has never seen it, you are missing one of the greatest historical and love stories of all time.
I:8794;475;Two Thumbs and Two Big Toes UP!
I:8794;476;One of our favorite movies, that we like to watch over and over again every year or so.
I:8794;477;The scenery, music and acting are superb.
I:8794;478;One of the great movies of the ages.
I:8794;479;My wife who usually hates old movies, really liked this movie.
I:8794;480;Great acting, great story within the framework of some dramatic and world changing historic events.
I:8794;481;romantised.yes but overall a true classic which has withstood the test of time.
I:8794;482;The transcendent Julie Christie is the visual and emotional heart of the film, functioning as the love/sexual interest in 3 men's lives.
I:8794;483;Spain and Finland make excellent stand.
I:8794;484;ins for early 20th century Russia and the palpable beauty of Freddie Young's cinematography makes this Blu.
I:8794;485;ray an exquisite pleasure to watch in spite of the longuers of its 4 hour length.
I:8794;486;"The book/multiple disc format is especially appealing and makes this ""Zhivago"" a jewel of the high definition medium."
I:8794;487;All the good words about this movie have already been written or spoken and WELL DESERVEDThis movie is one of the best ever made.
I:8794;488;It has romance, drama, historical content, and some of the best camera work I have ever seen in a movie.
I:8794;489;Great sellers, very fast delivery.
I:8794;490;One of the best movies of all time and this digitally remastered version is even better with the color brilliance and such.
I:8794;491;I loved to watch it again.
I:8794;492;Tis is probably the best film directed by David Lean, bringing to life the great novel by Boris Pasternak.
I:8794;493;outstanding acting and superior story.
I:8794;494;It's very exciting to see it again.
I:8794;495;very good performance of Omar Sheriff.
I:8794;496;This movie was absolutely amazing.
I:8794;497;Everything from the soundtrack to the settings were perfectly done.
I:8794;498;The actors are all excellent and the director was really able to represent the horrors of the Revolution in a way that we can all understand.
I:8794;499;I would definitely recommend this movie.
I:8794;500;This is one of my favorite love stories of all time, even if it is set in a bad part of Russian history.
I:8794;501;omar Shariff and Julie Christie did a wonderful job in portraying the two characters.
I:8794;502;One of my favorite classics.
I:8794;503;At the end of the war, the Bolsheviks take over and Pasha becomes one of it's great leaders.
I:8794;504;The revolution will succeed in separating this new relationship, but their love will be immortalized in a poem.
I:8794;505;The film is visually stunning, the soundtrack and cinematography are poetic, and the motive is compelling.
I:8794;506;The story shows how a world ruled by corruption, represented by Komarovsky, and pure idealism, represented by Pasha, threaten to stifle the human spirit, which is represented by the true love between Zhivago and Lara.
I:8794;507;epic, profound, makes you feel like Russia is a real and warm country despite the brutal winters.
I:8794;508;Instead of watching this, it is recommended to watch movies about Russia by Russian directors.
I:8794;509;bourgeois intellectual disillusion with life in the world as it is.
I:8794;510;"Film adaptations of excellent novels on the Russian Revolution include ""Silent Don"" by Sholokhov"", ""Life of Klim Samgin"" by Gorky, and ""Chapaev"" by Furmanov."
I:8794;511;David Lean's Doctor Zhivago had a difficult task when it was released, following two of the greatest films ever made in Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia.
I:8794;512;That is stands up so well to those two titans is impressive indeed.
I:8794;513;Doctor Zhivago, based on the novel of the same name, is a tale of love, loss and life during the Russian Revolution.
I:8794;514;We linger in seemingly small moments of life.
I:8794;515;The pace, while deliberate, works.
I:8794;516;the sweep of the landscape and scope of the story is epic in proportions.
I:8794;517;"We see stunning vistas and gorgeous landscapes
I:8794;518;That is an accurate assessment.

I:8794;531;My wife loved it, a wonderful love story though sad at parts.
I:8794;532;ray is almost as good as seeing it the first time at the movie theater.
I:8794;533;Life magazine did a wonderful photo spread and article about it.
I:8794;534;So my first experience with Dr. Zhivago was a totally top notch experience.
I:8794;535;If you have not seen this movie but you enjoyed Lawrence of Arabia, Bridge on the River Kwai, Ryan's Daughter, or A Passage to India.
I:8794;536;all films by David Lean.you will enjoy Dr. Zhivago.
I:8794;537;If you love short artsy fartsy movies than this one will do it for you otherwise stick with the novel.
I:8794;538;Doctor Zhivago can only be appreciated enjoyed on the largest screen available.
I:8794;539;It's panoramic splendor captures Boris Pastenaks Epic Russian Novel beautifully under the Direction of David Lean (Oscar Winner .
I:8794;540;boris Pastenak was a Nobel Prize winner and Russian writer whose books were banned for years.
I:8794;541;His passionate writings which were romantic political were popular on the Russian black market.
I:8794;542;Almost instantaneouly became a classic, a world.
I:8794;543;Doctor Zhivago is a grand story about young passion romance from the Russian Revolution to WWII involving unforgetable timeless characters.
I:8794;544;maurice Jarres Oscar winning Musical score introduced us to Lara's Theme and the music of the balalaika's errie sound.
I:8794;545;extras are abundant nice for background information.
I:8794;546;He's watched it three times already, and he loves it.
I:8794;547;Thank you for the prompt mailing!
I:8794;548;It is in great condition.
I:8794;549;Historically significant, but the music and landscape create a magic neverland in your mind, with a poignant and haunted feeling that you can never go there again.
I:8794;550;"This film together with ""Bridge On the River Kwai"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" represent a hattrick of director David Lean's best ever work as well as among the best films ever made."
I:8794;551;"Although ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is clearly the best of the three, ""Doctor Zhivago is a close second."
I:8794;552;"This film has been described quite aptly as Russia's ""Gone With the Wind"" as the loves and lives of the people close to Doctor Zhivago gets told amid the backdrop of World War 1 and the Russian Revolution all the way to the Russia of the 60's."
I:8794;553;No one can quite tell an epic story as well as David Lean does and his films are so good that they transcend time and as true classics should they age very well and hold up very well to repeated viewing.
I:8794;554;The cast is excellent and so is the brilliant camerawork and the haunting score by Maurice Jarre.
I:8794;555;Even the digipak cardboard packaging is very well done and aesthetically appealing in design.
I:8794;556;ray Book version is incredible!
I:8794;557;ray as it's like watching a whole new film!
I:8794;558;Every David Lean film is magnificent on Blu.
I:8794;559;I enjoyed this film as much as the others.
I:8794;560;I saw each film first run in theatres and they hold up beautifully on my high.
I:8794;561;It gives great insight into the problems with socialism that have inflicted the country of Russia for a long long time.
I:8794;562;I find it interesting that the book and the movie were banned for many years in Russia.
I:8794;563;It is a very well done movie, but be prepared to be effected by the emotions of the story.
I:8794;564;It is easy to see why this is one of the movie classics of 20th century film based on the book by Boris Pasternak of the same name.
I:8794;565;the movie, which departs slightly from the book in various ways, takes us to the life and career of Yury and the turmoil of pre.
I:8794;566;the movie focuses on Dr Yuri Andreyevich Zhivago and several friends and associates of his including his loyal and strong wife Tonya, the beautiful and mystifying Laryssa Fyodorovna (Lara),her husband, the self.
I:8794;567;some very memorable scenes that will be familiar to those who have read the book including the scene where Zhivago meets Lara for the first time after Lara's mother has tried to commit suicide by swallowing iodine, Lara's attempt on Komarov's life and Lara and Yury's life in the cottage in Siberia.
I:8794;568;strikingly done and very life like, with beautiful musical background to accompany the entire range of emotions, including the well known Lara's theme by composer Maurice Jarre.
I:8794;569;famous epic is now available in a deluxe blu.
I:8794;570;ray package that will transport many a viewer who saw this film in initial release.
I:8794;571;up back in the day, and I can say this high.
I:8794;572;There are moments here as rich as any ever put on film, and Bolt's screenplay is one of the most underrated ever.
I:8794;573;I recommend that everyone take a look at this International epic once again, now that it's on blu.
I:8794;574;This is one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen.
I:8794;575;I loved the music, especially Lara's theme.
I:8794;576;In it's time it was wonderful.
I:8794;577;Still want it as part of my collection.
I:8794;578;Anxious to watch it again.
I:8794;579;The cinemetography is truly amazing and beautiful.
I:8794;580;If you are fan of this movie, you should own this version.
I:8794;581;This movie is one of my favorites.
I:8794;582;It is an excellent story and history lesson.
I:8794;583;Doctor Zhivago is the greatest film ever made.
I:8794;584;Its scope, while daunting, is tamed to a fare.
I:8794;585;well by David Lean, its director.
I:8794;586;the film spans fifty years, bridging a turn.
I:8794;587;What a difference a few million digits make!
I:8794;588;"David Lean's remarkable genius for defining and obtaining ""the shot"" is given its due once again."
I:8794;589;Not I. Having seen it 222 times and memorized its every line, I see it as a metaphor on hope and the creative spirit.
I:8794;590;"Even in the symbolism of the balalaika, we should be able to perceive a ""gift"", reborn ."
I:8794;591;How fitting that the sweeping pizzicattoes of balalaika music grace the film's every turn.
I:8794;592;The book presentation is excellent, and well worth the few extra dollars.
I:8794;593;This is a good adaptation of the Boris Pasternak novel.
I:8794;594;The enigmatic poet and doctor is at the center of the scenarist Robert Bolt's never ending poetic riddle, and the director David Lean surrounds him with an enormous historical reconstruction of the Russian Revolution.
I:8794;595;In a movie, so full of realism, there is great impressionism.
I:8794;596;What is behind all those remarkable performances, the ideas presented in the dialogue, even the majestic cinematography of those daffodils, which Zhivago seems to gaze at so often.
I:8794;597;Freddie Young beautifully photographed this film.
I:8794;598;The lyrical composer Maurice Jarre gives us a love theme that goes through many innovative and emotional renditions evoking many interpretations of the events on the screen.
I:8794;599;This film is a grand scale drama about a Russian poet/doctor who dearly loves his sensitive wife yet wants this other woman named Lara.
I:8794;600;Zhivago and his family are swept up in these fleeting events that put him in self.
I:8794;601;His final choices concerning her and his family forever alter his remaining years.
I:8794;602;prize winning novel, it won 5 Academy Awards in 1965.
I:8794;603;best Screenplay Adaptation, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, and Best Music Score, which introduced the hit tune Lara's Theme a. k. a. Somewhere My Love.
I:8794;604;It was also a Best Picture nominee.
I:8794;605;Omar Sharif won a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Zhivago.
I:8794;606;Christie won the Oscar that same year for Best Actress in the film Darling , which I also reviewed.
I:8794;607;This is one of my favorite films ever and is one of the films listed on AFI's Top 100 Films of All Time.
I:8794;608;The acting is great, costumes exquisitely detailed, gorgeous photography, lavish sets, and a famous score all add up to one of the greatest films of this century.
I:8794;609;I loved the plot, scenery, costumes and music.
I:8794;610;I watched it twice in one day.
I:8794;611;It is a movie that I have seen at least ten times and could see again.
I:8794;612;I love drama that draws you in and has you living it with the actors.
I:8794;613;this is my favorite movie
I:8794;614;Lean was one of the most famous, powerful men in Hollywood at the time, so he was given carte blanche for this film.
I:8794;615;It took a year to shoot, and it got a reputation of a trouble production from the merciless press.
I:8794;616;"He said to Lean ""it's a good picture, David."
I:8794;617;Lean just came off Lawrence of Arabia, considered one of the greatest films ever made, so critics were out for blood.
I:8794;618;as for the film, it's a passionate, epic journey.
I:8794;619;It's a really deeply felt, romantic film where the politics don't get in the way of the story too much.
I:8794;620;Lean is a master, a genius, and the fact that he followed Lawrence with a film that can stand right next to it is remarkable.
I:8794;621;Looks like new, I haven'ttried but I believe it will be perfect.
I:8794;622;"Sir David Lean's (""The Bridge On The River Kwai,"" ""Lawrence Of Arabia,"" ""A Passage To India"") gift for epic storytelling is at its best in ""Dr. Zhivago."""

I:8794;631;don't care for commies or tsarist and they can keep the deep freezer of a country for themselves.
I:8794;632;Dr. Zhivago is a classic that never changes through the years.
I:8794;633;Always a thrill to come back to it.
I:8794;634;Bring some hankies while you are at it.
I:8794;635;Timely delivery, in great condition.
I:8794;636;"David Lean's epic movie ""Doctor Zhivago"" is a classic cinematographic piece that is over 3 hours long."
I:8794;637;The screenplay is adapted from Pasternak's Nobel Prize winning novel of the same title.
I:8794;638;The lead characters in the story are Zhivago a Russian medical doctor played by Omar Sharif and his mistress Lara played by Julie Christie.
I:8794;639;The movie was in perfect condition and arrived quickly.
I:8794;640;It is a great movie.
I:8794;641;The primordial essence of the tragic love is the impossibility for its whole fullness.
I:8794;642;its an ambitious stage with all the mammoth spectacle required in those times.
I:8794;643;sharif worked out to perfection.
I:8794;644;Far from being a historic review of facts and episodes , the core focuses around these two lovers with the implacable presence of Tom Courtenay giving one of his two best roles of his life :(the other would be the dresser years later).
I:8794;645;maurice Jarre `s soundtrack is still haunting and one of the most famous melodies ever written : Lara's theme.
I:8794;646;absorbing accounts of an undeniable periods of the human story.
I:8794;647;another additional triumph in David Lean 's career!
I:8794;648;An old favorite which will always be special in my heart.
I:8794;649;Such a well done movie, that I highly recommend to all.
I:8794;650;Omar Sharif captured in his brown eyes every ounce of emotion and thoughts to his character.
I:8794;651;This movie is a classic that won five Academy Awards about the life of a poet and general practitioner, Yuri Zhivago, who had lived during the final years of the tsarist regime, through the Russian Revolution, leading to the rise of the Soviet Union.
I:8794;652;Omar Sharif was brilliant playing the title role that, actually, was through the eyes of the author, Boris Pasternak, who experienced a similar life as Zhivago.
I:8794;653;also brilliant were the portrayals of the various characters such as Zhivago's wife, Tonya played by Charlie Chaplin's daughter, Geraldine Chaplin.
I:8794;654;The movie is historic and dramatic as well as romantic during a time of unrest.
I:8794;655;David Lean is a genius.
I:8794;656;This is a beautiful movie to watch in front of the fireside on a cold winters night.
I:8794;657;"A true love story where this movie helps us understand the fragility of human nature and the beautiful innocence and courage of this so. called ""fallen"" woman Lara."
I:8794;658;I have watched it many times and it's still new to me.
I:8794;659;I love an old fashioned love story.
I:8794;660;All great actors and great parts.
I:8794;661;David Lean's beautiful movie, based on the classical novel by Pasternak, shows the personal tragedy of Dr. Zhivago, the invisible man.
I:8794;662;He finally faces himself in the mirror for all he is worth: a frozen, old, red.
I:8794;663;and his lack of peace is Pasternak and Lean's ultimate narrative triumph.
I:8794;664;For the same reason, the action takes place in a turbulent and dramatic Russia in the times of the communist revolution.
I:8794;665;the music is good as is the scenery.
I:8794;666;I thought the good doctor and his family got off pretty easy.
I:8794;667;The disc came in excellent condition, n time or earlier, and it has all inside the box, as advertised.
I:8794;668;I very much recommend this seller.
I:8794;669;I bought the deluxe edition of the 1965 film to keep in my library.
I:8794;670;The casting and acting are incomparable.
I:8794;671;It is a great story, beautifully filmed, a wonderful movie, in my opinion also a true compliment to the book.
I:8794;672;Romantic movie about passion and revolution.
I:8794;673;Loved the movie and fast delivery thank you
I:8794;674;A little bit of history, some sadness and a whole lot of romance makes this a classic.
I:8794;675;If so, then Russians had plenty of opportunities throughout their recent history and Russia's greatest writers had fortunately shared their experiences and thoughts for the betterment of the humanity.
I:8794;676;Dr. Zhivago is perhaps the best of them.
I:8794;677;i find it amazing that people regularly found the deepest and the most passionate of romantic love during the most desperate of times.
I:8794;678;But I do not believe anyone's life who is subject to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune can be perfectly structured.
I:8794;679;But that's what makes him and his story most compelling.
I:8794;680;And to be needed by the ones that matter to us is yet an another compelling reason for our existence.
I:8794;681;But if people love poetry, they love poets.
I:8794;682;And nobody loves poetry like a Russian.
I:8794;683;this movie was made with much love.
I:8794;684;The actors, writers, directors, and staff went the extra mile to make this movie great.
I:8794;685;And oh how great it is.
I:8794;686;The snow, trees and mountains looked pretty good.
I:8794;687;I love David Lean, and almost every one of his films.
I:8794;688;More than one of his films are at the very top of my all.
I:8794;689;This one is a true masterpiece, and is almost perfect.
I:8794;690;So I sincerely hope that what I say about this great movie will not ruin anyone else's enjoyment of it.
I:8794;691;my problem is with the casting of two principle actors, both of whom have been brilliant in other roles.
I:8794;692;Alec Guinness has given so many great performances over the years, and I love and honor him.
I:8794;693;David Lean obviously loved Alec Guinness, and he appears at his remarkable best in some of Lean's other wonderful films.
I:8794;694;Sharif is great looking, Julie Christie is beyond stunning, and I do not want their child to look like Rita Tushingham.
I:8794;695;most of this monumental film is full of incredible beauty, almost above everything else.
I:8794;696;Because the love of Zhivago for Lara was so great, there needs to be a continuation of Lara's love and beauty in their daughter.
I:8794;697;If ever a film could termed dramatic, this one is it.
I:8794;698;Maybe that would not sit well with most critics, but it would make me extremely happy to see it that way.
I:8794;699;highly recommended for lovers of film for all generations.
I:8794;700;Just a stunning movie, the scenery and music and acting are just all excellent,a movie you will watch over and over.
I:8794;701;A very exceptional movie with a dynamic cast of star performers.
I:8794;702;Proving craft can become art with both Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago, Director David Lean's epic's still hold together when viewed in the Blue.
I:8794;703;This is a terrific transfer and package that though a bit pricey retail, is still wonderful considering its classic status.
I:8794;704;Robert Bolt's wonderful script, Freddy Young's photography, and Omar Sharif's performance hold the film together.
I:8794;705;Rod Stiger's scene chewing is a delight throughout.
I:8794;706;A great cast all around.
I:8794;707;Pacing may be a bit tough for today's audiences, but for students of film it is a study that represents David Lean mastery of story telling.
I:8794;708;Lavish film about the Russian Revolution of 1917.
I:8794;709;We see the paradox of art and science.
I:8794;710;It is the formula for historical fiction, made up characters living their lives against sweeping events.
I:8794;711;There are some hauntingly beautiful scenes, snow and springtime flowers.
I:8794;712;This epic, sweeping romance, told in flashback, captures the lushness of Moscow before the war and the violent social upheaval that followed.
I:8794;713;winning novel by Boris Pasternak.
I:8794;714;"I find this an excellent movie to ""watch"" and can forgive its few flaws."
I:8794;715;time and never tire of the wonderful scenes and settings, great acting, writing and music, all tied together and perfectly presented by the wonderful Mr. Lean.
I:8794;716;I love this movie not only for it's brilliant acting and overall production, but also because it is a pretty accurate account of what happened before, during and after the Russian Revolution.
I:8794;717;stricken people have more rights, respect and opportunities.
I:8794;718;Teaching this lesson to people today is why this movie is so important.
I:8794;719;Doctor Zhivago remains one of the greatest examples of the epic cinematic tradition.
I:8794;720;I watched the film again recently and was pulled back into that poetic world and battered by the vicissitudes of fate which David Lean so expertly captures.
I:8794;721;lean began his career in film as an editor and his ability to juxtapose scenes to great dramatic effect is evident here as it is in all of his films (i. e. the moment in Lean's greatest work, Lawrence of Arabia, when Peter O' Toole blows out a match and Lean makes the brilliant cut to the sun sinking over the undulating desert.)
I:8794;722;a great and complicated story of love, war, riches.
I:8794;723;star Cast, unlike the no.
I:8794;724;Julie Christie is breathtakingly beautiful, Omar Sharif's eyes express more longing than any actor before or since.
I:8794;725;Alec Guinness is a master of nuance and understatement and Rod Steiger steals every scene he is in with his astonishing performance.
I:8794;726;Above all, David Lean shows his mastery of film and storytelling with yet another piece of classic, poetic cinema.
I:8794;727;It uses fascinating people to tell the story of revolution, so we all incidentally learn our history lessons.
I:8794;728;This is just a great movie about a difficult era in history and the changes being made.
I:8794;729;It was a true classic, such an amazing love story with a tragic, but predictable ending.
I:8794;730;One of a kind must see!
I:8794;731;It's perhaps the most visually stunning, panoramic, and at the same time seductive movie I've ever seen.
I:8794;732;Rod Steiger was delicious as a very complicated villian.
I:8794;733;The music was splendid and moving .
I:8794;734;the story stirring and tear.
I:8794;735;It'd make a great date movie alternative.
I:8794;736;I just saw this last night and was almost immediately extremely emotionally expressive throughout the whole film.
I:8794;737;The juxtaposition between the rich and the poor and then the fall of society into communism is absolutely heart wrenching.
I:8794;738;But Dr. Zhivago is driven by hope and tireless perseverance to build a better life for his family.
I:8794;739;Their love for one another keeps them strong and keeps them going.
I:8794;740;studded cast performs brilliantly and in a believably disturbing way that pulls the viewer in and holds him for the length of this epic film.
I:8794;741;this is such a powerful movie that I should think that everyone must be able to watch it before they go off into that goodnight of existence.
I:8794;742;In fact, I encourage it.
I:8794;743;This film will have such a powerful effect on the viewer for the rest of his life, it is so powerful.
I:8794;744;We've seen this over the years, always such a good story with such good scenes and good acting.
I:8794;745;I enjoy the historic accuracy.
I:8794;746;I loved this movie, and I'm not a chick.
I:8794;747;The scenes and songs were terrific too.
I:8794;748;It was just as described, a brand new product in the original package and it arrived in a timely fashion.
I:8794;749;it was as good as I've ever seen it.
I:8794;750;I have been wanting to see it again since then.
I:8794;751;A truly poignant story by a great Russian author.
I:8794;752;ray version is the best way to go to experience Doctor Zhivago.
I:8794;753;Wonderfully written, acted, directed and gorgeous cinematography.
I:8794;754;I have seen this movie I don't know how many times and I love it more each time I watch it.
I:8794;755;Doctor Zhivago is an excellent adaptation of Pasternak's novel under the same name.
I:8794;756;"beautifully photographed
I:8794;757;What a beautifully restored set!
I:8794;758;"it follows the book better than most movies do { I read the book in college}, and the story is filled with characters,twists and turns
I:8794;759;a film to watch many times,and see more each time you watch.
I:8794;760;Omar Shariff is magnificient in this move.
I:8794;761;Although a very long move, it's worth every minute of watching it.
I:8794;762;the struggle, the tragedy, the deep sadness, and yet the enduring strength and beauty.
I:8794;763;Read some basic Russian history, then turn off everything in the house and deeply immerse yourself in this magnificent film.
I:8794;764;the movie was received in excellent condition, and in a timely manner.
I:8794;765;I thoroughly enjoyed it, and will do so in the future.
I:8794;766;One of the good ones.
I:8794;767;"winning novel, David Lean's second masterpiece (after ""Lawrence of Arabia"") is a sumptuous, absorbing epic in the grand tradition of filmmaking."

I:8794;769;shattering moment in world history into high romantic drama.
I:8794;770;Brimming with unforgettable images of the Russian steppes captured by Oscar.
I:8794;771;"winning lensman Carlo Ponti, Lean's snowy, romantic spectacle is just what the ""Doctor"" ordered, with marvelous ensemble work by Rod Steiger, Alec Guinness, Tom Courtenay, and Klaus Kinski."
I:8794;772;I am a real lover of this movie and bought it for an Indian friend of mine.
I:8794;773;So as you can see everyone loves this movie.
I:8794;774;I have to hold this movie up to pretty high standards.
I:8794;775;i really wanted to love this movie but I couldn't.
I:8794;776;The score was wonderful, along with the sets.
I:8794;777;I still recommend this movie just not as much as I would have liked.
I:8794;778;I would recommend this movie to any one who likes love stories, great acting, great music and scenery.
I:8794;779;This is a great movie, with great music.
I:8794;780;also, it's NOT entirely fiction, but is based on the lives of real people.
I:8794;781;this is a classic major motion picture production which will surely stand the test of time, and I highly recommend it.
I:8794;782;One of the greatest movies of all time even though it is a long one.
I:8794;783;It is a remarkable piece of work with high.
I:8794;784;oriented production and a luminescent grandeur.
I:8794;785;an ideal epic figure, Dr. Zhivago, though not a combat warrior with specialized fighting skills as in many other epics, was a thoughtful and determined man whose demeanor was fixed.
I:8794;786;up to 1962's Lawrence of Arabia, David Lean's Doctor Zhivago in widescreen format is breathtaking and arguably might have won the Academy Award for Best Picture had it not been for the popularity of The Sound of Music, another great classic in its right.
I:8794;787;kudos to wonderful costumes and makeup, especially that used to make Egyptian actor Omar Sharif appear as a European.
I:8794;788;Bought this as a gift for my mom.
I:8794;789;Both Boris Pasternak's extraordinary novel and David Lean's magnificent film version are among my favorites of all.
I:8794;790;robert Bolt's screenplay balances the political upheaval with exquisite, heartwrenching romance.
I:8794;791;one of the few films to succeed at this level.
I:8794;792;Lean, who seemed to make a specialty of making films about illicit love (Brief Encounter, Summertime, etc.), also works a tightrope, giving the film the necessary grandeur and sweep required for an epic while never losing sight of the intimacy of the characters.
I:8794;793;He is aided considerably by a magnificent cast: Sharif, despite or perhaps because of his Egyptian background, provides the perfect perspective of an individual observing things around him, each time as if it were new.
I:8794;794;inspiring cinematography of Freddie Young, who deservedly won the Academy Award.
I:8794;795;I was lucky to see Zhivago at a theater, on the big screen proper, several years ago when it was re.
I:8794;796;doctor Zhivago is, like the book it's based on, a challenging film that will reward the viewer with one of their most extraordinary cinematic experiences.
I:8794;797;I have seen this movie a few times, and enjoy it every time.
I:8794;798;Great story, great acting and sad ending.
I:8794;799;The photography is outstanding and the acting is spot.
I:8794;800;This is one of those movies that you go back to every six months or so, just to taste with your eyes and your mind.
I:8794;801;My favorite movie of all time.
I:8794;802;Life was wonderful for the wealthy but diffult for the average Russian.
I:8794;803;I have ordered this movie as a gift for my Father, he loves this movie very much, is a classic movie !
I:8794;804;I may give it to Good Will
I:8794;805;Doctor Zhivago is one of my favorites.
I:8794;806;The warmth and strength of the characters makes you feel as though you are living the experiences with them.
I:8794;807;The scenery and beauty of the countryside is very appealing.
I:8794;808;It's a bittersweet love story with beautiful music, too.
I:8794;809;These guys are the best !!!!
I:8794;810;i highly recommend this seller.
I:8794;811;This is an excellent movie and I would highly reccommend it.
I:8794;812;He is a man of peace and loves his country (Russia).
I:8794;813;He and his family endures degradation by having to share their home with thirteen other families and going without fuel for their stove.
I:8794;814;doctor Zhivago is based on the novel written by Boris Pasternak and is a story about Pasternak's life.
I:8794;815;i recommend this movie to everyone.
I:8794;816;It will make you very proud and thankful to live in America.
I:8794;817;One of the best movies of all times.
I:8794;818;I watch the movie every winter.
I:8794;819;It puts me in the winter mood.
I:8794;820;This is a timeless movie and the scenery is awesome.
I:8794;821;The love triangle between Yuri, Lara and Tonya is so real and heartfelt that you can't help but to feel Yuri's dilemma.
I:8794;822;An entertaining story is told all while you learn about the Russian Revolution and what a disaster Big Government (Progressives) is.
I:8794;823;The other thing I learned from this movie is that very good people are capable of doing very bad things, so always be on your guard.
I:8794;824;disc special edition, and they're both out of sync.
I:8794;825;I am happy to see this movie rereleased.
I:8794;826;Top notch actors and actresses as well.
I:8794;827;i highly recommend it and will continue to view the epic tale yearly.
I:8794;828;There are three stars of Dr. Zhivago : Omar Sharif, Julie Christie, and the winter Russian landscape, so brilliantly captured by the breath.
I:8794;829;Boris Pasternak's sprawling novel is brought to vibrant life iin this classic movie.
I:8794;830;If you haven't yet seen in, you are in for a treat.
I:8794;831;If you have, it's worth seeing again to truly take in the multi.
I:8794;832;layered plot and the gorgeous scenes of St. Petersburg and of the country villa where Dr. Zhivago takes refuge with his mistress.You will be touched as the tale of love and inevitable loss unfolds, and your heart will be captured and your eyes enchanted by this visually beautiful movie.
I:8794;833;It's principally about the love between man and woman but also about the love of a boy towards his dead mother and the strange consolation of the wind in the tree.
I:8794;834;This is a magical film that cannot grasp the mystery of love but manages to touch it and show it to us.
I:8794;835;I have tried to read the book, in order to retrieve some of the magic that I found in the film, but I had to give up.
I:8794;836;It's my wife and my favorite movie.
I:8794;837;It's kind of that classic love story kind of movie.
I:8794;838;Scenery, story line,good acting !
I:8794;839;Just the scenery alone is worth watching.
I:8794;840;It has it all: drama, intrigue, romance, all put together with a sweeping musical score and exquisite cinematography.
I:8794;841;Drawing on, and even expanding on, Pasternak's dual role in Russia of novelist and poet, Lean succeeded in creating a film that rivals the novel from which it was drawn, an exceedingly rare accomplishment in my opinion.
I:8794;842;The film is faithful to the novel and to the reality of the turbulent transition from Tsarist Russia to the Bolshevik state.
I:8794;843;The Academy Award winning cinematography is lush and beautiful, the sound rich and full, and the acting by Sharif, Christie, Chaplin, Steiger, Guinniss, et al is the stuff of film lore.
I:8794;844;And here's the icing on the cake.
I:8794;845;This film is truly breathtaking .
I:8794;846;in size, scope, story .
I:8794;847;Set during the Russian Revolution and beautifully acted by Sharif, Christie, Guinness and Steiger, this movie is a must.
I:8794;848;"see for all romantics, film lovers, history buffs
I:8794;849;This movie is a favorite.
I:8794;850;ray disc of this movie.
I:8794;851;It gives an insight into the Russian way of life if not an exact portrayal of Russian life.
I:8794;852;david lean's film of doctor zhivago is not only a masterpiece of great film and cinematography, but a wonderfully wrote story by boris pasternak.
I:8794;853;a must see for all movie lovers!
I:8794;854;Timeless classic, well writen and produced.
I:8794;855;This is a movie classic of its day.
I:8794;856;being one What really happens to the real people.
I:8794;857;This is a great description of it.
I:8794;858;This works and is perfect for my Russian Lit unit in English!
I:8794;859;This wonderfully acted, beautifully photograghed masterpiece places you into the historical framework of an epic love story.
I:8794;860;one of the top five motion pictures I have seen in my lifetime.
I:8794;861;simply a best of the best experience.
I:8794;862;I have enjoyed this motion picture at least annually since I first experienced it in a first run local theatre some 39 years ago.
I:8794;863;beautiful people during a very hard time trying to find happiness.
I:8794;864;Omar Sharif stars as Zhivago, a young Russian doctor and poet, at the time of the Bolshevik revolution.
I:8794;865;The woman of his dreams is Lara, played by Julie Christie.
I:8794;866;She is passionate, sensual, and the mother of his child.
I:8794;867;There is a lot of action as we view the war through the lives of these people.
I:8794;868;If you're looking for an epic love story, this is it.
I:8794;869;beautiful stars, exquisite music, and a sentimental story line that is riveting.
I:8794;870;"See it with someone you love, and ""Lara's Theme"" will become ""your song."""
I:8794;871;Fortunately, Lean's tight direction keeps the film from ever going over that edge.
I:8794;872;a true epic from the era of epics, the sweep of DR. ZHIVAGO is as vast and complex as Russia and the Revolution itself.
I:8794;873;"Lean captures the street scenes of ""Bread and Land"" demonstrations perfectly (according to one who was there), and imbues his characterizations with a depth and sensitivity not often seen on film."
I:8794;874;turvy by first the Great War and then by the Revolution.
I:8794;875;zhivago himself (played by Omar Sharif) is a sensitive, dewy.
I:8794;876;"importance of the ""New"" Russians is indictment enough for an era."
I:8794;877;"An early reviewer criticized the ""jack."
I:8794;878;"
I:8794;879;"So has the score, highlighted by the dramatic and romantic ""Lara's Theme."
I:8794;880;but this is far from his best film.
I:8794;881;Out of all of the Academy's nominations in 1965 for Substantially Original Musical Score (which included Alex North's brilliant work Agony and the Ecstasy.
I:8794;882;inspiring Greatest Story Ever Told and what many consider to be the finest musical ever filmed: Michel Legrand and Jacques Demy's Umbrellas of Cherbourg) this was the least deserving of an Oscar.
I:8794;883;i looked into the history of the movie to discover why this is such a well.
I:8794;884;But the public loved it.
I:8794;885;dr Zhavago is more comparable to Titanic (which is superior musically and artistically) than it would be to a truly great epic such as The Best Years of Our Lives or The Bridge on the River Kwai.
I:8794;886;The reason this version of this wonderful film only merits two stars from me is due to the multiple jumps and freezes on the discs.
I:8794;887;This is perhaps the 4th or 5th time I have seen this movie and it is still wonderful.
I:8794;888;Bought this as a gift for my dad.
I:8794;889;Came as described and he seemed to enjoy it.
I:8794;890;If I remember correctly, I definitely got a good price on Amazon for it.
I:8794;891;The best movie ever made.
I:8794;892;Alec Guinness is remarkable, and Rod Stieger is pure evil its amazing.
I:8794;893;Julie Christy is extraordinary and her blue eyes are the most beautiful in flim history.
I:8794;894;If you are a fan of epic films you will love this movie.
I:8794;895;Another brilliantly directed film from David Lean.
I:8794;896;wonderful performance by Omar Sharif.
I:8794;897;A lot of people clearly loved this movie, but here is a minority report.
I:8794;898;Tom Courtenay's noble revolutionary, Lara's husband, is a one.
I:8794;899;Epic needs to keep the two elements, the personal and the historical, in balance.
I:8794;900;that frozen river brings us to the film's one great strength, which is where it earned most of its two stars: the cinematography, which is absolutely at its best when the cameras stop pointing at the actors and go off and film snow, rivers, trees, banks of yellow flowers, while Maurice Jarre's famous music plays.
I:8794;901;In those moments we are reminded that Lean is a great film.
I:8794;902;day, but still with an eye for the grand image.
I:8794;903;But when the camera cuts away and picks up on the actors again, those shortlived moments of energy and power leach away.
I:8794;904;A man in chains comes up and fills the screen, telling us he was an anarchist who fought for the revolution.
I:8794;905;"rattling performance is mesmerising
I:8794;906;Of the few images I take away from this film .
I:8794;907;In my opinion these extras don't add a great deal of value, perhaps partly because I feel that the most interesting and honest commentary might discuss how this film went so wrong.
I:8794;908;_A Passage to India_ is a return to form .
I:8794;909;But if you wanted to explore further with Lean's films, then his best films of all are the early non.
I:8794;910;epics, the comedy of _Blythe Spirit_ and the lively Dickens adaptations, _Oliver Twist_ and _Great Expectations_.
I:8794;911;If you do watch this film, I recommend generous use of Fast Forward.
I:8794;912;Such an excellent movie about love and power.
I:8794;913;i always loved this film and now with it in blue ray it was just amazing to watch the winter scenes were so realistic that you felt you could jump into the movitthis is worht the price i paid
I:8794;914;Even more than in Lean's other features, this is visual poetry for the screen, with montages of stunning imagery that set the tone and feeling of the story.
I:8794;915;most compelling are the closeups of the actors in the film's core: the love triangle between Zhivago (Omar Sharif), his wife Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin), and the beautiful Lara (Julie Christie).
I:8794;916;Lean draws compelling performances from the cast, leading to fine ensemble acting and believable moral tension.
I:8794;917;The sensual adulterous love affair between Zhivago and Lara contrasts with the violent background of the Russian Revolution against which it plays out.
I:8794;918;but it is the sweep of history that is the real subject of Pastenak's novel, and of the movie.
I:8794;919;refuses to believe she has any connection with the great poet and his celebrated lover.
I:8794;920;"adventure features
I:8794;921;But these defects are subsumed in the fine plotting and story development, supported by meticulous historical accuracy.
I:8794;922;As always in the Lean films, the steam trains are beautifully photographed.
I:8794;923;The train journey from Moscow to the Urals rates as one of the greatest railway odysseys in film history.
I:8794;924;sharp cinematography is well rendered (although nothing could equal the full Cinemascope lushness of the original theatrical release), enabling the viewer to appreciate the fine detail of the Moscow.
I:8794;925;winter set and the frozen beauty of the Varykino estate with its onion.
I:8794;926;The making of the film was an unusually complex operation with locations all over Europe and Canada, and the documentary is interesting to watch once or twice.
I:8794;927;, this is a moving and delightful film, and rates as a great entertainment value.
I:8794;928;This wonderful MGM masterpiece was made before I was born.
I:8794;929;My hope is that she will come to treasure Dr. Zhivago as much as I do.
I:8794;930;the story is of Zhivago, a poet and a surgeon caught in the turbulent times of the Russian Revolution.
I:8794;931;Of his love for his wife and for the tender and passionate Lara, and of his struggle to survive a harsh political climate.
I:8794;932;This one comes with my highest reccomendation.
I:8794;933;Dr. Zhivago is one of the seminal epics, a film of such vastness, beauty, and precision that you fear it might lose something vital when transferred to a new medium, but in Blu.
I:8794;934;ray the experience is, if anything, more overwhelming.
I:8794;935;Zhivago is a movie about one of those pivot points in history, but it is a subtle history teacher.
I:8794;936;Instead, it focuses on one good.
I:8794;937;"nearly a half century after its release ""Dr. Zhivago"" remains a powerful, beautiful, ugly, intimate and passionate film, and Blu."
I:8794;938;ray makes it shine brighter than ever.
I:8794;939;If you have a desire to see Omar Sharif, Julie Christie, Geraldine Chaplin, Rod Steiger and Alec Guinness at their finest, watch this, and be captivated.
I:8794;940;"There are certain movies that are great in a way that they appeal to men and women equally, movies such as ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Casablanca"", Titanic"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Doctor Zhivago"", ""It's a Wonderful Life"" ."
I:8794;941;All of these movies have in common many of the same themes that are part of our lives: love, hate, loyalty, fear, our fate.
I:8794;942;These themes are part of our lives, whether you are a man or a woman.
I:8794;943;A great movie will appeal to anyone who appreciates a great script, fine acting and beautiful photography.
I:8794;944;I look forward to seeing the Blu.
I:8794;945;I'm sure this is a great movie, but I'm not qualified to rate this actually as it was a gift for my sister who loves this movie.
I:8794;946;A classic and must watch film.
I:8794;947;This movie grips you from beginning to end!
I:8794;948;One of the better movies made during the late 60's.
I:8794;949;Remember my mother taking my friends and I to see it.
I:8794;950;beautiful scenery and costume design.
I:8794;951;This is one of the best movies ever made and Omar Shariff is easy on the eyes if you know what I mean!!!
I:8794;952;This 1965 film certainly is an epic.
I:8794;953;It is also a sweeping love story.
I:8794;954;He loves his wife, played by Geraldine Chaplin.
I:8794;955;It is masterfully done, especially one scene in which all the furnishings in an abandoned house are covered in snow.
I:8794;956;The film's impact must have been a good lesson in history for audiences too.
I:8794;957;I was swept up in the story and what would happen next.
I:8794;958;And the overlapping love stories introduced a very interesting element.
I:8794;959;Acting was excellent, so good in fact that they really lived and breathed their parts and I ceased thinking about their performances and just let the drama unfold.
I:8794;960;"Over and over, we played ""Doctor Zhivago"", until I knew it by heart."
I:8794;961;It's a really great score.
I:8794;962;When the movie first aired, it was a major event!
I:8794;963;It's one of director David Lean's most famous movies, and deservedly so.
I:8794;964;Real best thing in the movie is Rod Steiger, who takes command in every scene he enters.
I:8794;965;He's the ultimate survivor, always managing to read the times and change with them, whether it's to be a bourgeous or a bolshevik.
I:8794;966;watch it for Steiger and the scenery, and don't forget to listen to that wonderful score.
I:8794;967;Just a true love story classic.
I:8794;968;made before my time, but still fundamentally a great movie and performance by all.
I:8794;969;Over three hours in length, this epic story absolutely earned its #39 spot on the AFI top 100 with its beautiful landscapes, fantastic acting, great score, and a storyline which sucks you in and holds you to the end.
I:8794;970;Sharif is a sensitive poet who is raised by a wealthy family and becomes a doctor.
I:8794;971;He also is steered into marriage with Chaplin, the sweet girl he grew up with almost as a sister.
I:8794;972;But it's Christie who captures his passion, and soon he is spending time with both of them.
I:8794;973;the complexity of the characters is one thing that always fascinates me here.
I:8794;974;Christie's mother is the kept woman of a rich, powerful man, and Christie tries to resist him.
I:8794;975;She lies to her fiance about what is going on as well.
I:8794;976;And through it all, Sharif shines with an idealistic light, trying to hold fast to his ideals, but sometimes being quite blind to the realities of danger that are swirling around him.
I:8794;977;the landscapes also capture me.
I:8794;978;The gorgeous ice palace glistens in the sun, the onion domes crystalized.
I:8794;979;There's a strong sense of just how much things change over the years .
I:8794;980;The world is changing, and yet the wolves still roam the winter plains, hungry for a meal.
I:8794;981;i absolutely adore the movie.
I:8794;982;I'm sure that's part of why I love the movie, with its sounds, locations, and storyline.
I:8794;983;It is fascinating to me that there were no Russian / Ukrainian / etc. actors.
I:8794;984;Many superb actors hail from this part of the world.
I:8794;985;I'll say again that I love the actors they DID use.
I:8794;986;second, this movie is far better than most in providing a well rounded cast of men and women.
I:8794;987;Here we have a wealth of great female roles, from the obvious Chaplin and Christie to the many secondary roles like Christie's mom and Chaplin's mom.
I:8794;988;Chaplin's mom briefly talks with her about how handsome Sharif is.
I:8794;989;So the tiny few times a woman talks with another woman, it's to add details about a man.
I:8794;990;It is just so eye opening to look at fantastic movies that have superb female leads and then to see what dialogue they're given.
I:8794;991;again I want to say that I love the actresses here, and have the highest respect for them.
I:8794;992;that the men in the movie have all sort of opportunity to engage in great dialogue.
I:8794;993;The novel offers incredibly powerful female.
I:8794;994;You'll want to watch it as the years go by, and see just how much more you get out of it each time.
I:8794;995;This time it made more sense, especially in the light of what's happening in our country today.
I:8794;996;This is one of my all time classic movies, when they made three or four hour movies that were great.
I:8794;997;The scenery is also beatiful,great story.
I:8794;998;great movie for a good price.
I:8794;999;Everything about it is magnificent.
I:8794;1000;This is a must have for movie lovers.
I:8794;1001;It is a timeless love story and will warm your heart and soul.
I:8794;1002;A classic for all times.
I:8794;1003;The film is definitely an Epic .
I:8794;1004;:) ) Beautiful scenery and music!
I:8794;1005;Good historical view of the end of the Tsar, and take over by communism.
I:8794;1006;Yes one of the great stories of the 20th Century capturing in a very realistic way the Russian revolution of 1917 and it's history thruout the years and thru the characters.
I:8794;1007;Magnificent panorama and cinematography from the genious of David Lean and the last of the great film Epics of lone gone years.
I:8794;1008;Julie Christie is Lara, a woman who is more dream.
I:8794;1009;like than real person, and Geraldine Chaplin is the perfect wife and mother who never says a cross word.
I:8794;1010;A sweeping, beautifully photographed and staged epic with a most memorable cast.
I:8794;1011;I enjoyed seeing the look on my sweety's face when I gave him this movie.
I:8794;1012;it was the best gift he ever wanted and he was so excited getting it.
I:8794;1013;there's no denying Doctor Zhivago has some great technical aspects going for it.
I:8794;1014;The music is light, crisp and filled with beautiful melodies.
I:8794;1015;I absolutely loved the use of the hammer dulcimer and harpsichord in the main theme.
I:8794;1016;"The quiet, mysterious, ethereal opening credits music sounds quite a bit like the ""Lady of Shallot"" theme in the TV Anne of Green Gables and the background watercolor paintings were awesome."
I:8794;1017;And I'll agree it deserved it's Academy Awards for Cinematography, costumes and sets although it was a VERY tough call for production values that year.
I:8794;1018;take a look it's competition.
I:8794;1019;The movie is chock full of drop dead gorgeous shots like the ice palace, snow scenes, countryside house in the springtime and those ending pictures of the waterfall was absolutely unforgettable.
I:8794;1020;The editing is very sharp and crisp.
I:8794;1021;It needs a good script and good acting and that is what Dr. Zhivago lacks a lot of.
I:8794;1022;The best actors are Julie Christie and Rod Stieger as Lara and her lecherous landlord.
I:8794;1023;Geraldine Chaplin as Tonya doesn't have much to do but looks absolutely beautiful, especially in that pink fur in her first scene and the white ball dress and proves a lovely, heartwarming, endearing presence.
I:8794;1024;law and son when they moved to France.
I:8794;1025;Come on, wrap up the movie!
I:8794;1026;"And I figured Yuri was going to become a more likeable character
I:8794;1027;One of my favorites now at my fingertips.
I:8794;1028;This is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:8794;1029;The love story, the music, and the Russian Revolution make this an emotional movie.
I:8794;1030;i finially found it on your site and very reasonably priced as well !!!
I:8794;1031;I did enjoy it, I need to watch it again to appreciate the wider focus.
I:8794;1032;This is my favorite film of all time.
I:8794;1033;"The acting is superb
I:8794;1034;class one like Zhivago, is a great reach from someone not raised in that values.
I:8794;1035;A great actor could do it.
I:8794;1036;Much loved for it's scope, sweep, and flowers, The Good Doctor rattles on.
I:8794;1037;still, I love this film.
I:8794;1038;But he did not, so this flawed masterpiece came into being.
I:8794;1039;"One hint
I:8794;1040;David Lean's extraordinary, expansive telling of Boris Pasternak's love.
I:8794;1041;Omar Sharif is stunning as the title character (he's a doctor and a poet so how can he miss?)
I:8794;1042;It is at once an intimate epic, superbly acted and impeccably crafted in every department.
I:8794;1043;winning score is by Maurice Jarre.
I:8794;1044;Other Academy Awards included screenplay (Robert Bolt), cinematography (Freddie Young) and art direction (John Box).
I:8794;1045;Director Lean's particularly dynamic use of the wide Panavision screen means inevitably some loss of impact of television.
I:8794;1046;Starting with 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' and then the stunning 'Lawrence of Arabia', Lean used his exraordinary gift for artistic visualization to transform two stories about courageous men performing exraordinary deeds of daring into classic, eye.
I:8794;1047;It is written in the style of the classic Russian novelists, reminiscent of Tolstoy, creating a large cast of characters whose lives intertwine as they are swept along by historical events, in this case the First World War and the Russian Revolution.
I:8794;1048;made for the style of epic film.
I:8794;1049;making that Lean had developed in the two previous films.
I:8794;1050;willed men among the main characters, determined to outwit and subvert an enemy that oppresses them as in 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'.
I:8794;1051;class doctor and poet, a family man whose personal struggles with survival and his own conscience make up the main storyline of 'Doctor Zhivago'.
I:8794;1052;but the reality is that 'Doctor Zhivago' is one of the great films of the 1960s and one of the great screen epics of all time.
I:8794;1053;The love story humanizes the film and the characters leave a deeper impression than they do in 'Lawrence' and 'Bridge'.
I:8794;1054;Omar Shariff brings great sensitivity to the role of Yuri Zhivago, the poet who is more an observer than a man of action.
I:8794;1055;Zhivago's emotions flicker across Shariff's face and are beautifully reflected in his large and soulful brown eyes.
I:8794;1056;Geraldine Chaplin was a newcomer to movies when she played Yuri's wife, Tonia, a woman raised in luxury whose appearance and demeanor suggest a finely made porcelain figurine but whose strength and backbone are the main forces that help her family survive the privations and terrors of the Revolution.
I:8794;1057;Julie Christie is exquisite as Lara, a girl raised in poverty who crosses paths with Zhivago who falls hopelessly in love with her.
I:8794;1058;Christie's Lara is by turns innocent, vulnerable, fiery, strong and passionate, a complex characterization beautifully realized in a truly fine performance.
I:8794;1059;Lean once again teamed with cinematographer Freddie Young who so beautifully photographed the vast grandeur of the Sahara desert in 'Lawrence of Arabia' to make 'Zhivago' into yet another feast for the eyes.
I:8794;1060;And Maurice Jarre's moving score sets the whole story to beautiful soul.
I:8794;1061;stirring music making the film an aural delight as well.
I:8794;1062;The score features an entire section of balalaikas, an instrument that tugs at the heartstrings and gives great poignancy and depth to the music, particularly the popular 'Lara's Theme', a beautiful melodic piece that is the musical expression of Yuri's passionate love for Lara.
I:8794;1063;The original treatment of this theme in the film is ravishing.
I:8794;1064;filling movie with a story that will stir your soul and move you to tears, by all means, pick up 'Doctor Zhivago', settle in and prepare to be swept away.
I:8794;1065;You will want to own this movie to enjoy it again and again.
I:8794;1066;It is truly a timeless classic from one of the greatest directors of the last century.
I:8794;1067;The last of the Great Epics, definitely a product of it's times but essentially faithful to it's source and the likes of which we'll probably never see again.
I:8794;1068;I bought two of these, one for my son, the movie is my all time favorite!
I:8794;1069;I hadn't seen this movie in over 20 years and found it to be as good now as it was then.
I:8794;1070;One of the best top ten movies ever made.
I:8794;1071;The photography was excellent for a movie of the sixties and the love story ending with missing or misplaced people was very realistic of the Stalin era.
I:8794;1072;My twenty year old thought it was good and had studied some of the history before and could follow it easily.
I:8794;1073;One of my favorite movies of all time!
I:8794;1074;I am so happy to have found it available on Amazon.
I:8794;1075;This story comes to life in such a way you almost feel the emotions, the desires and the hope of the characters.
I:8794;1076;This is a story that is timeless.
I:8794;1077;Also has my favorite song in it.
I:8794;1078;DOCTOR ZHIVAGO is a classic film.
I:8794;1079;Having never seen it before, and having recently rediscovered the joys of David Lean's LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (wow, what a great film!)
I:8794;1080;, I watched ZHIVAGO with fresh eyes.
I:8794;1081;The anamorphic transfer is clean and crisp.
I:8794;1082;The overture and intermission music are included.
I:8794;1083;The documentary, featuring a mature (and still distinguished) Omar Sharif, is illuminating .
I:8794;1084;which is necessary, sometimes, to believe in what you're seeing on the screen.
I:8794;1085;He lived with his wife in the cottage.
I:8794;1086;Lara got to stay in the ice mansion.
I:8794;1087;i don't deny that DOCTOR ZHIVAGO features some amazing performances and some very fine directing and cinematography.
I:8794;1088;i'll take a David Lean film any day, though!
I:8794;1089;I'm glad I finally saw ZHIVAGO and appreciate its place in film history.
I:8794;1090;Doctor Zhivago (1965) is simply an outstanding film, directed by David Lean and based on a novel of the same written by Boris Pasternak.
I:8794;1091;"Suffice it to say that ""Dr. Zhivago"" is an incredibly good love story, set against the backdrop of the First World War and the Russian revolution."
I:8794;1092;Not all your questions will be answered, but you will enjoy a film that really deserves to be called a classic.
I:8794;1093;This movie is a classic.
I:8794;1094;Julie Christie, Geraldine Chapin, and Omar Sharif gave wonderful performances.
I:8794;1095;The movie won five academy awards and the lush music was one of the awards.
I:8794;1096;The landscape of Russia was beautiful and everyone should see it as one of the great movies!
I:8794;1097;and an absolutely great movie!
I:8794;1098;the love story, the yearning to be together, personal i prefer this over romeo and juliet
I:8794;1099;the condition of used was in real good condition.
I:8794;1100;The parts that I did see both the audio and picture seem to be great.
I:8794;1101;Great enjoyable movie at a teriffic value.
I:8794;1102;This being said, love the film as an enriching movie experience and love the novel because of its greatness as a literary masterpiece and for not being like the film.
I:8794;1103;narrative of movies, especially modern films.
I:8794;1104;I saw Dr. Shiva go when it first came out and enjoyed it even more the second time.
I:8794;1105;Besides some admittedly beautiful photography and the always luminous Julie Christie, this one's a dud with a capital D. dr. Z is filmed against the backdrop of a monumental event in world history .
I:8794;1106;Especially when I saw that wonderful films like The Great Escape didn't make the list, I saw red when an overrated piece of motion picture excess like Dr. Zhivago made it.
I:8794;1107;The adaptation from the book leaves a lot of story untold.
I:8794;1108;But what's in tact is the best in acting and cinematography.
I:8794;1109;This movie will live forever as one of the greatest love stories!!
I:8794;1110;This has always been my dad's favorite movie.
I:8794;1111;It's true that it is the little things that count.
I:8794;1112;Doctor Zhivago is romance and history and struggle all wrapped up in one tremendous piece of art!
I:8794;1113;A favorite movie of my mother, she saw this in the theater when it first came out.
I:8794;1114;This is well worth getting and excelent film, one of the best ever.
I:8794;1115;Great packaging and wonderful acting.
I:8794;1116;I really liked this movie.
I:8794;1117;it is a must see movie.
I:8794;1118;An absolutely beautiful film .
I:8794;1119;i think this is one of the great love story which tell you that, to love somebody in any climate and in any circumstances is worth living for even if it ends in tragic.
I:8794;1120;David Lean, creator of the also epically great Lawrence of Arabia, has taken Boris Pasternak's novel and created a very good film with it.
I:8794;1121;This movie is really almost a historical film in disguise, since it highlights the lives of many, but especially Yuri and Lara, the main characters, and their attempts to live during and after the early nineteen hundreds Russian revolution.
I:8794;1122;Like the movie To Live did for China, Dr. Zhivago helps one understand the daily sufferings before and after the revolution.
I:8794;1123;It will also touch the mind and remind themselves of other culture's and their historical changes.
I:8794;1124;I own every iteration of this movie but this BD release is truly magnificent.
I:8794;1125;Once again Warner had preserved another masterpiece.
I:8794;1126;A must see for anyone who wants to experience a classic Russian tale.
I:8794;1127;This was indeed a beautifully written, scripted, acted, and directed movie.
I:8794;1128;certainly worth your time and open.
I:8794;1129;and was humble enough to share his learning experiences through writt and poetry.
I:8794;1130;Again, this movie was amazing.
I:8794;1131;It is my Dads favorite movie of all time and I cannot wait to sit and watch it with him again and again and again.
I:8794;1132;Having just viewed this movie for the first time since I saw it in the theatre as a young teenager, it certainly is not the boring, snow.
I:8794;1133;this is a great film.
I:8794;1134;David Lean was truly the master of the epic genre.
I:8794;1135;"He managed to focus on the personal stories of 3 people while the ""epic"" serves as the backdrop ."
I:8794;1136;And, an epic it is .
I:8794;1137;will all the bells and whistles.
I:8794;1138;a very young Julie Christie steals this film.
I:8794;1139;Everyone else, including the good doctor himself, seems like a supporting player to her incredible Lara.
I:8794;1140;She chews them up and spits them out before we're a half hour into this 3.
I:8794;1141;overs and supporting bit parts these days.
I:8794;1142;The best movie ever made in my opinion.
I:8794;1143;An epic of the Russian civil War 1920.30 and its effect on ordinary people from mechanics to aristocrats.
I:8794;1144;Ahhh, love in Moscow, in the Urals and the steppes!!
I:8794;1145;Sir David Lean was true to his form in this reproduction of Pasternak's story, with a cast of great names .
I:8794;1146;"beautiful photography of beautiful scenery (albeit not really Russia, but Spain), and the same eye for editing his film that made ""Lawrence of Arabia"" so stunning."
I:8794;1147;The musical score by Maurice Jarre, whose orchestrations are always so colorful, is worth the price of the film all by itself.
I:8794;1148;The special features in the 40th Anniversary set, interviewing actors and filmmakers crucial to the movie, are interesting and provide more background to help one appreciate even more the retelling of Dr. Zhivago's story.
I:8794;1149;This is the original movie and a great revisit from the past.
I:8794;1150;If you like great films you must have this one.
I:8794;1151;It's one of the most beautiful movie I have already seen.
I:8794;1152;It tells the story of Russian Revolution in a very sensitive way.
I:8794;1153;The actors are the best ones of their times.
I:8794;1154;Everybody knows it's a classical, so I just want to add that I bought the blu.
I:8794;1155;This had to be one of the top 10 movies ever made.
I:8794;1156;I love the ice palace scenes.
I:8794;1157;I received the movie promptly and will watch it many times over, a true classic.
I:8794;1158;"Mine has a special feature printed as a ""new commemorative two."
I:8794;1159;The clarity of image varies from hazy to barely adequate.
I:8794;1160;Doctor Zhivago is the best David Lean film I've ever seen in my life.
I:8794;1161;It tops his film of Lawrence of Arabia in my opinion and is a lot more interesting.
I:8794;1162;Soon the Revolution has come along with the war, and Zhivago is put with Lara to help the injured.
I:8794;1163;Maurice Jarre's Academy Award Winning music also holds you to the film.
I:8794;1164;This film has to be in your movie collection if you love movies with beautiful photography, a great story line, and the right actors.
I:8794;1165;I am happy to have found it through amazon for more than $10 less than in stores, including shipping.
I:8794;1166;i thank the vendor as well as Amazon.
I:8794;1167;Doctor Zhivago is the epic tale of a poet who marries but cheats on his wife.
I:8794;1168;warner Home Video has given us a deluxe 2.
I:8794;1169;Colors are nicely balanced though and contrast levels are very well represented.
I:8794;1170;There's also the original making.
I:8794;1171;the novel, is more or less, a love story that takes place during the Russian Revolution, and the turmoil that this event inflicted on the human spirit.
I:8794;1172;it was wonderful to see Julie Christie and Tom Courtenay together again on.
I:8794;1173;"screen, as they had such a smashing success with John Schlesinger's delicious ""Billy Liar"" (1963)."
I:8794;1174;screen, I felt cheated out of a meaningful conclusion of that storyline.
I:8794;1175;I was so touched by the book's information about their affection for one another, and the way the book had Zhivago and Pasha meet and discuss the love of both their lives .
I:8794;1176;The 2003 Masterpiece Theatre TV remake starring Hans Matheson, Keira Knightley and Kris Marshall was much more faithful to the novel, and presented something closer to the full story.
I:8794;1177;julie Christie is always lovely and magnetic, and she obviously has an eye for great material.
I:8794;1178;Her electric blue eyes and sensitive, full lips often say more that the viewer has heard her say.
I:8794;1179;The late Sir Alec Guinness is an interesting narrator to have for the story, and he always worked well with Lean.
I:8794;1180;"She was excellent in Tony Richardson's ""A Taste Of Honey"", and you have to wonder why she didn't have more of a career."
I:8794;1181;Watch for the late Klaus Kinski in a brief but very effective portrayal of a man who becomes a prisoner of forced labor .
I:8794;1182;his scenes on the train are riveting.
I:8794;1183;Jack MacGowran has an interesting little part as well.
I:8794;1184;It is one of the best made films of all time, and it gives romantics a run for their money!
I:8794;1185;the performances by Shariff and Christie were amazing.
I:8794;1186;if you enjoy daytime soap operas, then you might enjoy this film.
I:8794;1187;historically signififcant, excellent history in some content, exciting story, lots of intensity, top notch actors, interesting details, outstanding filming,color remarkable, intense character depiction, and very pleasing.
I:8794;1188;The first part was great!
I:8794;1189;I love this movie, but I must say, Lawrence of Arabia is my favorite film of all time and what I consider Lean's masterpiece.
I:8794;1190;Zhivago is stunning visually, but acting wise, it's not great.
I:8794;1191;Omar Shariff is always great in supporting roles (watch his Ali in LOA!)
I:8794;1192;Amidst the Russian Revolution, here's a love story between a married doctor/poet and a beautiful woman who only Julie Christie could play.
I:8794;1193;The scenery in this movie is outstanding.
I:8794;1194;omar Sharif is perfectly cast as the whimsical doctor who sees beauty in everything around him, even as his world is seemingly falling apart.
I:8794;1195;this movie works on many levels.
I:8794;1196;The music is charming, the scenery cinematography outstanding and the acting superb.
I:8794;1197;I gave this as a gift, doing my part to educate the youth on the classics.
I:8794;1198;gives an great indication of what is wrongwith this movie.
I:8794;1199;As tothat, the blu ray is superb and does justice to Freddie Young's cinematography.
I:8794;1200;one relishes the loves of one'syouth.
I:8794;1201;Yet,just as we might meet one of our human loves many years later and beforced by experience and ravages of time to revise our opinions about his/her physical beauty, so it is here.
I:8794;1202;Yet, the physical beauty of this film is intact.
I:8794;1203;robert Bolt is always thought of as a great screenwriter, and so he may have been.
I:8794;1204;"She simply writes Yuri about Lara, ""I'm sure she (Lara)must be a wonderful person,"" or something to that effect."
I:8794;1205;"And whenever his infidelity threatens to become an issue, we canrest assured that ""Lara's Theme"" will swell up in full orchestra, Yuri/Omar will assumehis best dreamy, teary."
I:8794;1206;eyed, pensive look, and it all will be laid to rest.
I:8794;1207;worn adage that theartist is a superior being and not bound by the moral rules of lesser mortals.
I:8794;1208;omar Sharif, of course, was and probably still is a very handsome man.
I:8794;1209;a beautiful woman,by our western standards at least.
I:8794;1210;iremember Shaquille O'Neal especially being fascinated with her beauty.
I:8794;1211;Lean does British subjects very well, but alas, Brits can't do Russkies.
I:8794;1212;The movie is a classic and looks great in blu.
I:8794;1213;Best to watch on a hot day.
I:8794;1214;The photography is very good.
I:8794;1215;Saw it when I was a teen.
I:8794;1216;Had to have itA love story,that will pull at your heart strings.
I:8794;1217;Each time viewed I see more and understand the basis of the times and circumstances surrounding the story plot.
I:8794;1218;A must for the romantic and historic enthusiast.
I:8794;1219;As a side, this movie deserves more than 5 stars.
I:8794;1220;this movie is without a doubt one of the best movies directed by David Lean, at a tie with Lawrence of Arabia and The Bridge on the River Kwai, and is one of the best movies of all time.
I:8794;1221;Omar Sharif does a fantastic job as the quiet Dr. Zhivago.
I:8794;1222;Lara, played by Julie Christie, was such an interesting character, as well.
I:8794;1223;The two were so much in love, but yet so deeply pulled apart and kept away from each other, and the sense of longing pulled to you with the beautifully composed Lara's Theme.
I:8794;1224;The genius of Boris Pasternak is so vividly revealed through this classic retelling of this story that you'd think he had a hand in the film's direction and production.
I:8794;1225;Rod Steiger gives a magnificent performance as Komarovsky, as you develop a hatred for him in the beginning but a pity for him in the end, and a sense of the good he has done for Lara and Zhivago.
I:8794;1226;A story told through flashback, you get a magnificent picture of the pain he's suffered through life, and the unspeakable joy.
I:8794;1227;Truly a cinematic classic that will be remembered through the ages as a great work of art more so than a film.
I:8794;1228;The music and filming is absolutely superior.
I:8794;1229;A must see for everyone.
I:8794;1230;still watch it every winter.
I:8794;1231;Great movie in great shape at a great price.
I:8794;1232;general is just as believable as his casting as King Faisal in Lawrence of Arabia.)
I:8794;1233;In any event, I was well into the movie before I began to make any sense of it.
I:8794;1234;the movie itself offers much to the history.
I:8794;1235;Zhivago's (and family's) trip along the Trans.
I:8794;1236;"When Strelnikov exclaims that ""the personal life"" doesn't matter anymore, it is very telling."
I:8794;1237;"I particularly liked the argument among the Red Army concerning whether or not they should allow Zhivago to go home to his family after they had ""kidnapped"" his services."
I:8794;1238;in addition, Rod Stieger's character was very well.
I:8794;1239;general (Guiness) and Zhivago and Lara's daughter was especially effective, and provided a happy.
I:8794;1240;overall, a very good movie, but wrongly marketed as a love story.
I:8794;1241;Clearly with the seven minute overture that preludes a 200 minute epic.
I:8794;1242;I dearly love this film, a life .
I:8794;1243;boris Pasternak's book was epic in scope and I think director David Lean made the best choice when he decided to film the movie version as an epic rather than as an intimate love story between Yuri and Lara.
I:8794;1244;This is the story of a doomed, but beautiful, love and Lean captures its essence so well.
I:8794;1245;julie Christie was also the perfect Lara.
I:8794;1246;She was more beautiful in this film than in any other and it's easy to see why Zhivago, Kamarovsky and Antipov were all in love with her, each in his own way and why Tonya admired her, even after realizing her own adored husband loved Lara.
I:8794;1247;i loved Rod Steiger's portrayal of Kamarovksy.
I:8794;1248;He loved Lara, to be sure, but he didn't care what happened to Yuri Zhivago.
I:8794;1249;She played her part well and was quite believable.
I:8794;1250;the cinematography in this film is perhaps the most beautiful ever filmed.
I:8794;1251;the script was perfect, the timing was perfect and the score was the perfect accompaniment.
I:8794;1252;Doctor Zhivago is a movie I watch regularly and I always will.
I:8794;1253;The emotions it depicts are timeless, the doomed love between Yuri and Lara is perfectly captured by Sharif and Christie.
I:8794;1254;It is truly one of the most beautiful stories ever filmed.
I:8794;1255;Where does one begin with a film as astounding as this one?
I:8794;1256;Perhaps, to say that Omar Sharif was perfectly cast in the role of Doctor Zhivago is a good start.
I:8794;1257;this film is really a love story, (but not a boring one!)
I:8794;1258;, with the Russian Revolution of 1917 serving as the background.
I:8794;1259;Doctor Zhivago loves his wife.
I:8794;1260;but he loves his mistress too!
I:8794;1261;we see the beautiful Russian countryside, (sometimes burning, unfortunately), as well as much social turmoil transpiring in the urban Russian settings.
I:8794;1262;"The scenery and action that takes place during the ""train transport scene"" is just fantastic and the compelling cinematography is second to none."
I:8794;1263;and we get a great feel for the people of Russia during this traumatic period of social conflict.
I:8794;1264;I feel that the director pulled this one off with great finesse.
I:8794;1265;Something is better than nothing at all, is the view that I'm taking.
I:8794;1266;and on the topic of Pasternak, I would HIGHLY recommend that viewers read his magnificent book prior to watching the film.
I:8794;1267;It's a great tome of classic literature and you'll understand the details of the movie a lot better for having read the book first.
I:8794;1268;this film gets my highest recommendation!
I:8794;1269;This film holds up remarkably well.
I:8794;1270;Again, Lean has created a film that is like watching a moving paiting.
I:8794;1271;The images of Russia, the winter, the landscapes are just beautiful.
I:8794;1272;Then there is Julie Christie who is a treat to watch.
I:8794;1273;Her best performance and you can see why Zhivago falls in love with her.
I:8794;1274;Great product, especaily with he extra, How it was made scenes.
I:8794;1275;Zhivago is one of my favorite films, and one of the most visually beautiful films of all time.
I:8794;1276;David Lean's direction, Robert Bolt's intelligent screenplay, the passionate performers, Maurice Jarre's unforgettable score, John Box's production design and Freddie Young's breathtaking cinematography all combine for a singular movie experience.
I:8794;1277;ray disc provides the closest equivalent yet of what I experienced many years ago, even more so than the 2.
I:8794;1278;Visually, it's darned near flawless.
I:8794;1279;For younger audiences who never got to see it on the big screen, it's a wonderful introduction to an epic style of film making that has, regrettably, all but vanished.
I:8794;1280;Along with Lawrence of Arabia, Dr Zhivago is a classic by David Lean.
I:8794;1281;Two of the best movies and stories filmed.
I:8794;1282;A must movie for anyone's video library.
I:8794;1283;Exceptional cast of actors, exceptional cinematography, exceptional faithfulness to the author's writing.
I:8794;1284;Still excellent after all these years.
I:8794;1285;really enjoyed The making of the film Great job in making it in Blue ray
I:8794;1286;I love this movie and watch it over and over.
I:8794;1287;But oh boy, when it came out a bazillion years ago, with marvelous shots of its two photogenic stars, Julie Christie and Lara and Omar Sharif as the doctor, it was full.
I:8794;1288;Gorgeous scenery both rural and urban lend to the epic grandness of this effort of a forbidden love affair in the midst of horror, famine, COLD weather, and a nation suffering.
I:8794;1289;It won 5 Oscars, which gives an idea how popular the film was.
I:8794;1290;It's still a good one, and the theme song, Lara's Theme, will forever bring the movie to mind.
I:8794;1291;To put it simply, this is a five star movie and it is well worth your time to see.
I:8794;1292;Doctor Zhivago is David Lean 's measured and beautiful adaptation of Boris Pasternak 1958.
I:8794;1293;Made in 1965 and winner of five Academy Awards, starring Omar Sharif and Julie Christie, Doctor Zhivago is a cinematic masterpiece, a visually stunning and expressively powerful love story set in the foreground of life in Russia during the latter days of Czarist Russia and the turmoil of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.
I:8794;1294;the film features gorgeous landscape and romantic scenes set to Maurice Jarre's haunting music.
I:8794;1295;a romanticized version of an illicit relationship without moral dilemmas or conflicts.
I:8794;1296;I give it 5 stars.
I:8794;1297;David Lean likes to make big movies and Doctor Zhivago is yet another in a line of his famous epics.
I:8794;1298;The film is beautifully filmed from the picturesque winter Russian landscapes to the bloody battles in the streets of the Russian Revolution, Mr. Lean again provides stunning visuals.
I:8794;1299;But Mr. Lean compensates for that as mentioned before with the film's stunning visual look and Maurice Jarre's score is among the most memorable in film history.
I:8794;1300;The film is long and drags in places, but thanks to Mr. Lean's track record, worth a look.
I:8794;1301;Saw this movie many years ago in my teens and have always wanted to see it again as my memories of it are sketchy.
I:8794;1302;rAY, BOOK EDITION: I was very excited about this great movie being released on Blu.
I:8794;1303;ray and the advertised promise of the superb video and audio restorations it would offer.
I:8794;1304;"Admittedly, this is a dialogue intense movie and not much will be going on with the sub, but one would expect a great deal more ""punch"" when the ""drama emphasis"" of the music score kicks in and when watching the sound intense action scenes."
I:8794;1305;overall, this movie as a theatrical experience has improved with age and I continue to rate the movie itself as a 5 Star production, including the wonderful music score.
I:8794;1306;Great interviews with the actors, plus extra features about on.
I:8794;1307;The ordering and delivery was up to the usual high standards of Amazon and the product itself was gorgeous.
I:8794;1308;I have had a great time sharing it with those who had never had the experience of viewing it before.
I:8794;1309;Julie Christie plays an admirable role as his 'true love'.
I:8794;1310;The breathtaking scenery mixed with brutal reality, the tragic expressions and the lugubrious wetness in Sharif's eyes, the close.
I:8794;1311;ups that are somehow softened to give an ethereal feel to the whole thing, make this a must see in a person's lifetime.
I:8794;1312;It is a necessity in fact, if one wants to appreciate the visual arts at their best and least controversial.
I:8794;1313;It is a universal film and appeals to a selective audience as well as a more general one.
I:8794;1314;Oh yes, the music throughout is fantastic too and helps to give the film a memorable feel.
I:8794;1315;the colors popped the sound on my 7.1 was great and its nice to see classics come back to life
I:8794;1316;1965: Doctor Zhivago won numerous Oscars ands swept audiences with its lush cinematography, superb drama, graphic historic portrayal of Russia during the 1918 revolution and its sublime romanticism.
I:8794;1317;It was precisely for its frank depiction of the Russian Revolution, and rise of Communism, that Russian writer Boris Pasternak was censored by Russian critics.
I:8794;1318;By 1965, Pasternak's novel and poetry was published and Doctor Zhivago was made into a stunning film.
I:8794;1319;Doctor Zhivago is right up there with such romantic epics as Gone With The Wind and Titanic, most recently.
I:8794;1320;It is an engaging and poetic tale of raw human emotion.
I:8794;1321;Doctor Zhivago is a brilliant doctor by profession and practice, a romantic poet by heart.
I:8794;1322;He is married to Tonya, who gives birth to his first born son, Zasha.
I:8794;1323;Adultery and extramarital relationships have been romanticized by films and literature before.
I:8794;1324;In the case of Doctor Zhivago, Lara becomes a source of inspiration and a lasting love.
I:8794;1325;In fact, if you take a good look at the film (or perhaps read the novel in my perspective), you will discover that Zhivago loves two women equally.
I:8794;1326;He is in love with both his wife and his mistress.
I:8794;1327;The idea is that, if one is at the verge of death, loved ones come to mind.
I:8794;1328;the Impressionist style of cinematography helps to fuel the romanticism, especially striking are the landscapes of rural Russia in the winter and the spring.
I:8794;1329;The shot with Zhivago looking at the field of sunflowers is particularily memorable.
I:8794;1330;perhaps a top 25 of all time.
I:8794;1331;Omar sharif was just brilliant and was robbed of an Oscar nomination.
I:8794;1332;This film is a beautiful adaptation of the classic novel.
I:8794;1333;Doctor Zhivago is a tale of the power of love and the triumph of the human spirit.
I:8794;1334;I remember this movie from my youth.
I:8794;1335;It had impact as an art achievement.
I:8794;1336;I liked the spectacular cinematography and renewal of the film.
I:8794;1337;This is a timeless classic of both substance and scale in the same order of magnitude of Gone With the Wind.
I:8794;1338;It is a piece of history as Russia ends the era of Czars and begins it's revolutionary political struggle, eventually becoming completely Communist.
I:8794;1339;The acting is superb and the scenery breathtaking.
I:8794;1340;Omar Sharif and Julie Christie deliver performances that are unforgettable.
I:8794;1341;The music is captivating, soulful, romantic and powerful at times.
I:8794;1342;David Lean again demonstrates his talent in delivering an epic movie that earned five Academy Awards.
I:8794;1343;I will always love watching this movie time.
I:8794;1344;"A number of years after seeing ""Doctor Zhivago"" 4.5 times, I finally got around to reading the book."
I:8794;1345;His success in this has, to me, helped to make the movie as great as it is.
I:8794;1346;Dr. Zhivago won Boris Pasternak the Nobel Prize for Literature and it succeeded in winning Robert Bolt the Academy Award for Best Writing.
I:8794;1347;"Bolt is certainly a great one for screenplays (consider ""A Man for All Seasons"") but I can't help but feel he had a head start when taking on this project."
I:8794;1348;Doctor Zhivago is an epic movie and the word that comes to mind in describing it is MAGNITUDE.
I:8794;1349;This story is, first and foremost, a love story and a sad one at that.
I:8794;1350;We see the 1905 revolution, WWI, the Russian Revolution, the ensuing Civil War just to name the major points.
I:8794;1351;Throughout it all, we have just enough characters to give us an understanding of the class system that determined how these events would turn out.
I:8794;1352;One of the major roles, and, in my opinion, the best acted role, was that of Doctor Zhivago's step brother (played by Alec Guinness).
I:8794;1353;He serves the role of counter.
I:8794;1354;Another important role was Strenlikov, the Trotsky.
I:8794;1355;the scenery and the costumes and the battle scenes were all outstanding.
I:8794;1356;The Directing, however, is what I credit with making the movie as great as it is.
I:8794;1357;Thank goodness a project like this one was put in his capable hands.
I:8794;1358;Hopefully, the films buffs of today will take the time to see what a real epic movie is all about.
I:8794;1359;"The novel ""Doctor Zhivago"" was a timeless classic."
I:8794;1360;The movie is as well.
I:8794;1361;Dr, Zhivago is one of my absolute favorite movies.
I:8794;1362;My dear husband, before he WAS my husband, proved he loved me by sitting though 2 showings of this movie and sleeping through both of them!
I:8794;1363;Hope everyone loves this movie.
I:8794;1364;What a great epic movie depicting Russia's tumultuous Revolution interspersed with romance and suspense and intrigue.
I:8794;1365;The cast members are superb actors too!!!!!!
I:8794;1366;but Lean's direction is spot on, and the cast is amasing.
I:8794;1367;GeraldineChaplin, Rod Steiger, Julie Christie and Sharif are excellent.
I:8794;1368;it's a very pretty film.
I:8794;1369;The cast is attractive, the cinematography lush, the sets well done.
I:8794;1370;Omar Sharif and Julie Christie are magic together.
I:8794;1371;The snowy scenes and sweeping scenery display an unequaled knowledge of cinematography.
I:8794;1372;The popular music is instantly recognizable and winds its way through the movie, making the score all the more emotive.
I:8794;1373;every scene in this movie feels real.
I:8794;1374;Victor, an older gentleman, also has a passion for Lara.
I:8794;1375;She is pursued by three men, but only loved by one.
I:8794;1376;They seem drawn to each other by a magnetic force of passion.
I:8794;1377;this is story telling at it's finest.
I:8794;1378;It is definitely one of the most romantic movies ever made.
I:8794;1379;It will hold your attention for hours and at the end, you will wish it had been a longer movie.You will love this movie and do look for the Christmas Tree with real candles.
I:8794;1380;I also felt this movie truly brought history to life in a way no book could.
I:8794;1381;This is the most romantic movie of all time, besides Gone with the Wind.
I:8794;1382;great addition to any movie collection
I:8794;1383;"A CLASSIC in drama, and the haunting ""Lara's Theme"" is ever popular music."
I:8794;1384;Acting is superb, and movie should have won OSCAR for best film.
I:8794;1385;Within the heart and mind of the true poet resides a grasp and perception of life and the human condition unequaled in it's purity by any other art form.
I:8794;1386;The poet, of course, will choose the medium through which he will share his vision.
I:8794;1387;"For director David Lean, that medium is the cinema
I:8794;1388;"Indisputably, this is the true nature of David Lean
I:8794;1389;"to borrow a line from the more recent ""Moulin Rouge,"" this is a story bout ""love."""
I:8794;1390;A love story set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution.
I:8794;1391;"with ""Zhivago,"" David Lean has crafted and delivered a magnificent and monumental motion picture of epic proportions that at the same time is disarmingly intimate, rendered as a world within a world, with each a vital part of the other."
I:8794;1392;"Lean blends actors, cinematography, story and music with his own compassionate perspective to create a true work of art
I:8794;1393;In telling his story, he offers breathtaking visuals, like the awesome vistas of the snow.
I:8794;1394;and which significantly enhances the impact of it.
I:8794;1395;This is filmmaking at it's best, and an example of what makes Lean's films so memorable.
I:8794;1396;"put a talented actor into the hands of a gifted director, and results of more than some distinction can be expected
I:8794;1397;"In 1962, Sharif received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his work in Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" and in ""Zhivago,"" Lean's next film, Sharif gives a sensitive, affecting performance for which he should have received a Best Actor nomination, but inexplicably, did not (It was Lee Marvin's year for ""Cat Ballou"")."
I:8794;1398;Sharif successfully manages to convey his deepest, internalized emotions, expressing them through the genuine compassion with which he imbues his character.
I:8794;1399;Lean allows his star the time he needs to share with his audience his appreciation of the beauty he perceives in the world around him, and it's in those pensive moments that we, in turn, perceive the inner beauty and poetic nature of the man.
I:8794;1400;"It's a wonderful collaboration between actor and director that so vividly and poignantly brings this character to life.1965 was a career year for Julie Christie
I:8794;1401;"Lara's beauty is obvious, yet of a kind that goes much deeper than what you see on the surface
I:8794;1402;guinness, Richardson and Courtenay are exceptional in their respective roles.
I:8794;1403;One of Lean's greatest films.
I:8794;1404;The violence is not nice to see but otherwise it's an amazing movie.
I:8794;1405;Definitely one of the best movies ever made.
I:8794;1406;It was a gift for my mother.
I:8794;1407;law and she loved it.
I:8794;1408;Beautiful music, sets and photography make this film worth watching.
I:8794;1409;the acting, screenplay, casting try to pull the story above what it is.
I:8794;1410;A simple love story during hard times.
I:8794;1411;I got it as a Christmas gift for my mother.
I:8794;1412;She told us the story of her and my no deceased father.
I:8794;1413;This is the greatest love story ever told.
I:8794;1414;Keep in mind that the film is a fair length, seeing as how there is so much story to tell.
I:8794;1415;Much like Lawrence Of Arabia, this film features some great imagery and my favorite was how everything looked in the winter.
I:8794;1416;Gives some good history about Russia, which I know nothing about.
I:8794;1417;ray disc from Amazon brings new exhilarating pleasure.
I:8794;1418;Much of the movie will seem new if it is more than a few years since it has been viewed.
I:8794;1419;what remains to be said however is to be reminded of how smoothly the film portrays the complex relationships.
I:8794;1420;between lovers, men,families, and politically opposed forces.
I:8794;1421;She starred in 'Darling' also made in 1965, and also received the Academy Award for Best Actress.
I:8794;1422;"If you want to see a better David Lean film, watch ""Ryan's Daughter""."
I:8794;1423;release of a real Epic film.
I:8794;1424;The music, the costumes, the story, the brilliant acting, the set design, the editing is all perfect.
I:8794;1425;This is Hollywood at it's best.
I:8794;1426;The music in the film is breathtaking as it comes through my sound system.
I:8794;1427;I've watched all the extra features as well and found them very informative.
I:8794;1428;Ca hyou locate it and and provide a source for me to view it.
I:8794;1429;it has been digitally enhanced and is well worth the extra money.
I:8794;1430;Great Movie should have been enough.
I:8794;1431;I had not seen this film in 30 years but remembered it vividly.
I:8794;1432;Seeing it now, it truly met the test of excellence for me: the love story, the grand sweep of history, the soul of a poet.
I:8794;1433;It all rang true for me, indeed was unbearably beautiful, perhaps because it brought back the emotions I felt as a child seeing this and then as an adolescent in crisis.
I:8794;1434;I think this is a film you can watch at each stage of life and see new things, a true mark of great art.
I:8794;1435;Shariff is wonderful, with so much going on below the surface that his performance is extremely subtle.
I:8794;1436;Christie, an unconventional beauty, is wonderful as the chaotic Lara, reflecting a tumult of emotion and personal trouble.
I:8794;1437;The cameo by Kinski was also memorable.
I:8794;1438;Dr. Zhivago still thrills me after all these years.
I:8794;1439;The story and photography are magnificent.
I:8794;1440;A must see in widescreen!
I:8794;1441;If you think that is ludicrous (I certainly do), consider the fact that thirteen years earlier, High Noon, Moulin Rouge, and The Quiet Man lost out to The Greatest Show on Earth for the Academy Award as best film in 1952.
I:8794;1442;By then, Yevgraf is a high.
I:8794;1443;brother is a great poet whose heart is pure.
I:8794;1444;Lean makes brilliant use of the omniscient voice.
I:8794;1445;over to begin and end the film, of course, but also to advance the plot with style and grace.
I:8794;1446;"For example, spectacular rural landscapes juxtaposed with moments of exquisite tenderness
I:8794;1447;"Yes, this is among the greatest of epic films but many of its memorable moments involve intensely human, indeed intimate interaction as when Zhivago and Lara are alone in the ""ice house."
I:8794;1448;I also envision the vast Russian countryside, magnificent in each of the four seasons, impervious to centuries of man's inhumanity to man.
I:8794;1449;If for only 197 minutes, this film enables us to experience (albeit vicariously) much of a great and good man's life long ago in a distant land.
I:8794;1450;While doing so, our own lives are nourished and enriched.
I:8794;1451;A work of art can do that in unique ways, as indeed this great film does.
I:8794;1452;Doctor Zhivago tells a simple love story in a turbulent setting and, for the most part, avoids easy resolutions to disordered emotional relationships.
I:8794;1453;He's a promising, successful medical student and poet, engaged to his childhood sweetheart Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin).
I:8794;1454;Lara's fianc Pasha (Tom Courtenay) is an idealistic revolutionary who is part of that change.
I:8794;1455;The combination of the personal and the political has rarely been so striking as it is in that effective sequence.
I:8794;1456;lean gives the film an impression of stark, beautiful expanse.
I:8794;1457;"Like all love stories, ""Doctor Zhivago"" depends on viewers' involvement with the characters, and these work very well."
I:8794;1458;While Lara is the effective expression of the pain and chaos of those cataclysmic times, Yury can see no happiness in his existence without the love of this beautiful woman, which to him is immortal.
I:8794;1459;And while something was broken in Lara's whole life, she continues to be for Yuri an expression of life, and from the distressing emotion of losing her a new and unexpected life of poetry arises.
I:8794;1460;"The film remains one of the most ambitious and watchable of the ""big"" Sixties films, and one of the best depictions of revolutionary and post."
I:8794;1461;This is the great one.
I:8794;1462;A movie of great importance for a democratic sociality.
I:8794;1463;Puts in perspective what is happening right now in the U. s. a.
I:8794;1464;This movie is a classic in every way.
I:8794;1465;This new digital transfer from restored elements looks and sounds great.
I:8794;1466;There's not a lot of meaning in this melodrama, but the marriage of dazzling images and bittersweet emotions are about as good as film can deliver.
I:8794;1467;It's cinematography is some of the best and its soundtrack is so memorable with Lara's Theme winding ever about in settings which by pace and volume certainly set the stage for what's coming or happening.
I:8794;1468;Sharif and Christie are phenomenal!Have to see it once or twice a year.
I:8794;1469;He is swept into the Red Army, fights against the Czarist White Army, all the time in love with the beautiful Lara, who is incomparably played by Julie Christie.
I:8794;1470;story of Lara's own troubled life that is also very well done.
I:8794;1471;the musical score of this film is one of the truly greats.
I:8794;1472;but the real star of this classic film is Russia.
I:8794;1473;The superb cinematography of this film somehow captures the struggles of the people against the backdrop of Russia's endless steppes and vast landscape.
I:8794;1474;This film will always be the classic story of the Bolshevik revolution.
I:8794;1475;Excellent movie and an insight into what was happening in that part of the world at the turn of the century
I:8794;1476;I always loved that movie, all the actors are excellent and I would never have change the cast or visionned anybody else in it.
I:8794;1477;It's one of David Lean's best movie if not the best.
I:8794;1478;It is by far one of the finest movies ever made.
I:8794;1479;I am sure you will return and watch it again and again.
I:8794;1480;Based on Pasternak's excellent novel, this is one of the truly great movies.
I:8794;1481;It is strong in all areas.
I:8794;1482;The story is powerful, the actors excellent, the editing appropriate, the sound track wonderful and the cinematography breathtaking.
I:8794;1483;We are actually permitted into the coffin of the beautiful young woman as her orphaned child watches ice crystals forming on his window.
I:8794;1484;idealistic and moral, he tries to control himself and tells the tearful Lara that they must never meet again.
I:8794;1485;His son, Alex, was born in Harbin but, following the Japanese invasion, came to the U. s.
I:8794;1486;"The ""long ago"" sometimes touches the present."
I:8794;1487;Dr. Zhivago is still a great film after more than 40 years since its original release.
I:8794;1488;We are drawn to it with its profound beauty and we cannot escape its pull.
I:8794;1489;When a good romance, tragic or happy, is played out on the screen, and when its score has beautiful music, and when there is much to see and discuss about the film's look and historic detail, that's when you know it's a classic.
I:8794;1490;Doctor Zhivago ( the sexy Omar Shariff) is a well.
I:8794;1491;This is the most romanticized adultery ever made.
I:8794;1492;But the Doctor Zhivago/Lara romance is interesting because, although no one really knows it and perhaps it is merely my own interpretation, Zhivago loves Lara and his wife equally.
I:8794;1493;He writes romantic poetry and letters to a mysterious someone, and we always conclude that it is Lara.
I:8794;1494;Perhaps its neither and he is writing to Love, universal, eternal, divine.
I:8794;1495;The music is sweeping, lush and carries out the action and romance very effectively.
I:8794;1496;The imagery is also very appealing, especially the scenes in which a contemplative Zhivago looks over a thick forest off the train and is intoxicated with a sort of Impressionist reverie, and the same applies to Zhivago looking at the field of yellow daffodils, which any Impressionist artist would have loved to depict in their art.
I:8794;1497;The score by Maurice Jarre is impressive, brilliantly orchestrated and elegant, especially striking is the Russian and Romantic Era Tchaikovsky.
I:8794;1498;esque flavor of Lara's Theme.
I:8794;1499;The balalaika, a stringed Russian guitar, is heard often enough and becomes the gift that Zhivago's daughter by Lara takes with her at the end of the novel, and symbolically, the gift of love, sacrifice (which Zhivago does himself for BOTH his women) and creativity and romance that must be passed to every person now and forever.
I:8794;1500;Doctor Zhivago is without a doubt an amazing accomplishment.
I:8794;1501;It successfully, for the most part, takes the microcosm of several relationships and places it in the macrocosm of the Russian Revolution.
I:8794;1502;The moments of snowy peace and love, protected from the turbulance of the outside world, create many striking images.
I:8794;1503;These characters, small and insignificant as they are amidst the social turmoil, keep having amazing coincidences.
I:8794;1504;Thank goodness for that toilet break.
I:8794;1505;Doctor Zhivago is the sensitive poet, we know, because he's always staring at things while sensitive music plays.
I:8794;1506;He and Lara love each other deeply, we're supposed to believe, because, well, they're darn attractive people.
I:8794;1507;Komarovsky is wicked, because wicked music plays and he keeps doing unnecessarily wicked things.
I:8794;1508;Give the guy a break!Still, those days and nights in a snow.
I:8794;1509;The author of the screenplay has done a very decent job as well of interpreting the book for the screen.
I:8794;1510;This image is the primary image of the poem A Candle Burned.
I:8794;1511;There are many more such examples, but this poem is one of Pasternak's most famous.
I:8794;1512;It was a nice choice to accent the imagery of the film.
I:8794;1513;the cast of this classic is impeccable: a young and vigorous Alec Guiness provides snappy menace as Yevgraf, the successful half.
I:8794;1514;Long movie, keeps you entertained.
I:8794;1515;We all enjoy this story and the acting is excellent.
I:8794;1516;an excellent and entertaining movie.
I:8794;1517;I secretly love this movie.
I:8794;1518;if you haven't seen it yet, it's a sprawling epic about one man's life in Russia during and after the revolution.
I:8794;1519;history lesson, but mainly a great love story set in a beautiful backdrop.
I:8794;1520;This is a great romance that I first saw some 35 years ago.
I:8794;1521;Some of the scenery is spectacular.
I:8794;1522;It has always been one of my favorite movies.
I:8794;1523;I love it for the historic theme and of.
I:8794;1524;course the love story that surrounds it.
I:8794;1525;I love this movie and have watched it a few times.
I:8794;1526;It's a classic and very popular with my friends too.
I:8794;1527;Fast shipping and a good price.
I:8794;1528;This has always been one of my favorite movies?
I:8794;1529;It has the stars, the history, the story to make it an epic.
I:8794;1530;I first saw this movie while in college, over 15 years ago, and have seen it once more since then.
I:8794;1531;Most enthralling love story, with lovely music ( Lara's theme still gives me goosebumps whenever I hear it).
I:8794;1532;no words can describe the beauty pathos in the movie.
I:8794;1533;Again, the music score is very well used, and greatly enhances the movie.
I:8794;1534;A good lesson in history too.
I:8794;1535;a must see, right there with (my other must see's) Casablanca Rebecca.
I:8794;1536;An epic movie of grandest proportions that slowly draws you in and keeps you riveted.
I:8794;1537;Plus the stars are easy on the eyes too!
I:8794;1538;the gorgeous visuals, the attractive cast, the exotic design and cinematography, and the sweeping musical score.
I:8794;1539;He himself is a noble man of character, but in terms of the narrative he just isn't interesting enough to carry such a big picture.
I:8794;1540;Lukewarm recommendation for fans of the great 60's epics or for those with an abundance of patience.
I:8794;1541;The acting is great and it has a really good story plot.
I:8794;1542;Yes, it may have aged,might be considered by others as pure romantic dribble,but be assured this is movie making at its best.
I:8794;1543;Hollywood was already jealous of Lean at this stage,they knew that this was another masterpiece after Lawrence and they proved it by giving that years best picture oscar to the Sound of Music instead.
I:8794;1544;Rod Steiger and Tom Courtney were excellent (the latter should have won the supporting oscar)Julie Christie was tremendous in her role.
I:8794;1545;This movie will always remain a classic
I:8794;1546;The movie is based on one of the most touching stories in world literature.
I:8794;1547;The movie captured the spirit of the story amazingly well, the cinematography is stunning and the actors (Omar Sharif, Julie Christie, Geraldine Chaplin, Rod Steiger) perform superbly.
I:8794;1548;"A good test might be to see ""Dances with Wolves"" first."
I:8794;1549;If you love classic westerners, this is the story for you.
I:8794;1550;When a young cowboy falls for a Russian, the hijinks really begin!
I:8794;1551;Beautiful shots of the old west and plenty of mid.
I:8794;1552;western values make this a must see.
I:8794;1553;I bought this beautiful movie as a gift for a friend.
I:8794;1554;We both love the story and I wanted her to have it.
I:8794;1555;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8794;1556;Incredible story and wonderfully acted.
I:8794;1557;It's a great movie in any perspective.
I:8794;1558;the story is great!The performance of Omar Sheriff needless to say, he done a great job!!
I:8794;1559;Although not really made clear in the movie, this great epic takes place from the pre.
I:8794;1560;The best scenes, and most of the film, actually take place during the Russian Civil War of the early 1920's, a period most Westerners, mainly Americans, may not be familiar with.
I:8794;1561;The love stories all the way through, and Zhivago's exile are true, based on the autobiographical novel, and the winter scenes are fabulous and mesmorizing.
I:8794;1562;Even though it gets a little dragged down in the soap opera aspect, this is without doubt a great historical epic, the specialty of David Lean, among the great British directors.
I:8794;1563;it was a favorite years ago and still is.
I:8794;1564;This is a classic movie and I got it for a neighbor who loves this movie.
I:8794;1565;She enjoyed with me so much andglad I bought it for her.
I:8794;1566;one of the best movies ever made.
I:8794;1567;The cinematography is breathtaking, especially considering when it was done.
I:8794;1568;"David Lean's masterpiece ""Doctor Zhivago"", is a cinematic journey into the yesteryear world of movie making on a scale of lavishness and grandeur largely unheard of nowadays."
I:8794;1569;With no expense spared on transferring this unforgettable love story to the screen, even now almost 40 years on this film still amazes me with it's sheer artistry and outstanding qualities in every department.
I:8794;1570;I see it as one of the greatest classics to come out of the 1960's combining as it does a perfect marriage of romance, tragedy, human emotion and passion, all set against the terrifying upheavels of one of the most significant periods in modern history, in this case the Russian Revolution.
I:8794;1571;We see Yuri train to become a successful doctor and eventually marry the Gromenko's lovely daughter Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin in her adult debut).
I:8794;1572;Working in a military hospital at the front Yuri encounters Lara again who is working as a field nurse and finds himself instantly drawn to her beauty and quiet strength of character.
I:8794;1573;Peace is declared and the two part company determined to get on with their lives.
I:8794;1574;Moving to the country to escape possible persecution Yuri by chance encounters Lara now living on her own in the local town.
I:8794;1575;Doctor Zhivago, is certainly an ambitious effort and one of the high water marks in film making in any decade.
I:8794;1576;"It boasts impeccable credits such as a fine literary source in the classic novel by Boris Pasternack, able direction with obvious reverence for the source material by the gifted David Lean, the hauntingly majestic ""Lara's theme"" by composer Maurice Jarre, and outstanding cinematography by Freddie Young."
I:8794;1577;The superb cast is centred around Omar Sharif ideally cast in the best role of his career.
I:8794;1578;Equally outstanding are Julie Christie in the role she is still best remembered for as the enigmatic Lara, Sir Ralph Richardson,brilliant as the long suffering head of the Gromenko family, Geraldine Chaplin as Tonya the ever loving wife of Yuri, and Tom Courtney as the ruthless revolutionary Strelnikov.
I:8794;1579;The beautiful visuals used in this film also help enhance this unforgettable story with the wonderful location photography in Spain standing in for Russian landscapes.
I:8794;1580;"The whole spectrum of violence, terror and beauty are captured in this one story make a viewing of ""Doctor Zhivago"", an awe inspiring journey."
I:8794;1581;daid Lean displayed a genius in transferring a complex literary work onto the screen and a better screen version of the sprawling novel could not be achieved in my opinion.
I:8794;1582;"For all lovers of romance ""Doctor Zhivago"", is unsurpassed entertainment of the first order and always manages to stir up all kinds of emotions which each screening."
I:8794;1583;David Lean's 1965 epic has aged well.
I:8794;1584;It is still considered one of the classic achievements of British film nearly 40 years after it's production.
I:8794;1585;the fascination with this film lies in all that it is based on.
I:8794;1586;Boris Pasternak's novel on which Zhivago is based presented a specific view of the Russian Revolution .
I:8794;1587;that of the plight of a bourgeoise Doctor, a man of practical accomplishment but also a sensitive poet.
I:8794;1588;Politics runs through the movie like a leitmotief, certainly Zhivago is popular with British politicians who voted it the greatest ever British film production.
I:8794;1589;the love, war and politics in Zhivago are on an epic scale, and the cinematography supports the vast scope of this movie with superb scenes of the bitter winters in Siberia, the eternal train journeys with escapees of the Revolution piled in to freezing carriages like cattle and the brutal suppressions of protestors by the Russian authorities in the pre.
I:8794;1590;For example the romance between Yuri and Lara reaches catatonic proportions before the fires have been properly stoked.
I:8794;1591;He has wanted this movie for years because he went to the premier in the 60's on the east coast.
I:8794;1592;He was home when it arrived on a Saturday and he ended up feeling more special because of all of the fuss and the hand delivery by FedEx.
I:8794;1593;The film is stunning, as ever.
I:8794;1594;I was highly satisfied with the whole process and the product.
I:8794;1595;I completely recommend using the ticker on items that tells you how soon you can get them anywhere in the country .
I:8794;1596;David Lean gives the Bolshevik Revolution the grand touch with his pannoramic cinematography and imagery.
I:8794;1597;Omar Sharif Julie Christie gave good performances.
I:8794;1598;But it was Rod Steiger who steals the show with his great portrayal.
I:8794;1599;The only format worthy of such a magnificent film.
I:8794;1600;this is an old time sweeping saga.
I:8794;1601;lots of snow and revolution with a great love story.
I:8794;1602;beautiful scenery, music and acting.
I:8794;1603;Great movie to begin with and this 2 disc set was especially nice.
I:8794;1604;I enjoyed watching the old interviews with Omar Sharif and Julie Christie which were conducted back at the time of the original theatrical release.
I:8794;1605;This is a classic movie.
I:8794;1606;For me it also brings back the memories from my youth in a communist country.
I:8794;1607;It was one of the greatest movies of all time as far as I'm concerned.
I:8794;1608;century Moscow, we mainly see a Russia that's more delectable than what history has revealed.
I:8794;1609;The sheer beauty of the sets (especially the snow.
I:8794;1610;There was one scene that was absolutely joyous and that was when Zhivago (Omar Shariff and his fiancee (Geraldine Chaplin) were driving home through snow.
I:8794;1611;Zhivago also writes a beautiful poem about it .
I:8794;1612;candle, candle, burning bright .
I:8794;1613;One day Zhivago sees Lara at the home of her mother.
I:8794;1614;and after that (I'm sure) she works with him as a nurse at the front during WWI.
I:8794;1615;The train also becomes another character and a very important one.
I:8794;1616;The best performances are by Steiger and Tom Courtney who as Lara's commissar husband becomes violent, cold, distant and only devoted to the Communist cause.
I:8794;1617;Julie Christie is also very good as Lara, and her scenes with Steiger are the best.
I:8794;1618;Still, the film is like a beautiful painting with all the music and color one could hope for.
I:8794;1619;The recent PBS version is one you've got see though.
I:8794;1620;It's much better than Lean's version sans sweeping vistas.
I:8794;1621;First off, this is an epic masterpiece of classic proportions.1.
I:8794;1622;Saying I'm a romantic is another understatement.
I:8794;1623;It's a personal account of how Dr. Zhivago has made an impression in my life and what it means to me.
I:8794;1624;I received this as a Christmas gift this year.
I:8794;1625;Having seen the film originally when it was released in theaters, I am reminded that that this is one of the most beautiful films that I have ever seen (or heard).
I:8794;1626;The videography and editing are breathtaking, the soundtrack sublime, and fitting to the subject.
I:8794;1627;Julie's beautiful eyes steal many scenes.
I:8794;1628;I am truly sorry that she has made so few films in the intervening years.
I:8794;1629;if you have never seen Zhivago, I recommend it highly.
I:8794;1630;I remember seeing this probably more than 4 times now .
I:8794;1631;I also remember that I was actually amazed when I first watched the movie in the cinema as a young boy .
I:8794;1632;A must see all time classic.
I:8794;1633;time epic movies, full of history and scenery and period costumes and authentic sets.
I:8794;1634;all wrapped up in a heart.
I:8794;1635;tugging love story surrounded by one of history's most momentous events.
I:8794;1636;One of Hollywood's last great triple.
I:8794;1637;decker movies, those long, action.
I:8794;1638;packed epics guaranteed to keep you entertained for hours on end and emotionally upset when it finally ends.
I:8794;1639;tearing you away from its fictional world and characters, this movie is full of great acting, incredibly beautiful cinematography, and a beautiful story based on Boris Pasternak's international best.
I:8794;1640;it's THAT good, a movie masterpiece!
I:8794;1641;It has everything: Great history, romance, adventure, and realities for war.
I:8794;1642;Very few movie images stay with you for a few hours, let alone years or even decades.
I:8794;1643;dOCTOR ZHIVAGO is one of those unforgettable films, both for its spectacular visuals as well as the compelling story.
I:8794;1644;With strong performances by one of the greatest casts of all time .
I:8794;1645;and the most breathtaking images ever filmed, the movie takes into a world as familiar and alien as Russia ever was.
I:8794;1646;despite (or perhaps because) of its length, one is taken into a place and time so real that .
I:8794;1647;even watching it in summertime, you will swear that it is the depth of winter.
I:8794;1648;The restoration is pristine and the additional features are great.
I:8794;1649;Dr. Zhivago (Omar Sharif) returns to Moscow, where he had a thriving medical practice, a high place in the community, and a luxury apartment.
I:8794;1650;He returns to his pad, only to discover that it is teeming with proletariat peasants.
I:8794;1651;"the production design of ""Doctor Zhivago"" is tremendous and Omar Sharif turns in a magnificent performance as the soulful doctor."
I:8794;1652;Lean has been responsible for some terrific films in his career, but this outing is certainly not one of his finer efforts.
I:8794;1653;A sweeping portayal of love and betrayal in the chaos of the Russian revolution.
I:8794;1654;One of the great epics.
I:8794;1655;One of the best movies I ever saw.
I:8794;1656;Excellent story plot, historic in nature, excellent photography, well acted.
I:8794;1657;The essence of Pasternak's complex novel is captured in this huge epic film that spans across the decades of the Bolshevik rebellion.
I:8794;1658;It takes the viewer into the Russia of at time with great sweeps of the landscape enhanced with Lara's theme.
I:8794;1659;Omar Sharif and Julie Christie's performances were brilliant and subtle.
I:8794;1660;Sharif is mesmerizing, Julie Christie luminous.
I:8794;1661;The cinematography is impeccable with dazzling photography and rousing music.
I:8794;1662;"A funeral procession winding through a desolate landscape
I:8794;1663;ray has the great film in full, all 200 minutes of it, as well as documentaries on each half of the film, totaling 40 minutes.
I:8794;1664;The film is, of course, a sweeping fantasy made on a grand scale and no expense spared, with each scene meaningful and well.
I:8794;1665;As such, it's the perfect platform for the great acting of masters like Omar Sharif, Julie Christie, and Rod Steiger.
I:8794;1666;Geraldine Chaplin is also charming as Zhivago's teen love and wife, Tonya, and in her eyes we see the face of her father Charlie Chaplin, wrapped up in a pixyish teenage form.
I:8794;1667;The film goes on and on and on, and each scene is gripping.
I:8794;1668;By the end, Zhivago is burned out, and so are we after nearly 3.5 hours, but it's a great feeling.
I:8794;1669;One of the fellows, Mikael Salomon, recalls working as a projectionist in a theatre that was showing the film, and the grandiosity of screening the epic.
I:8794;1670;"They take apart scenes, including the riot scene (and how it's played out on Zhivago's face) that includes the splash of blood on white snow that symbolizes both the sacrifices of the revolution as well as Lara's deflowering

I:8794;1680;Focuses on incidents around the Nobel Prize Pasternak won in 1958, Pasternak's life, the film project coming together, the 10.
I:8794;1681;Christie's surprised when her words from an earlier interview are read out to her .

I:8794;1683;Lots of background noise here.
I:8794;1684;Ascribes his success to luck.
I:8794;1685;But everyone agrees that Geraldine Chaplin has an effect on people, in spite of herself.
I:8794;1686;Watching it again reminded me that during civil unrest and political upheaval love still continues to triumph!
I:8794;1687;I have loved this movie since I was a teenager myself.
I:8794;1688;I recently watched it with my fifteen year old granddaughter and she was equally captivated by it.
I:8794;1689;It is definitely a classic worth owning.
I:8794;1690;This movie is an epic.
I:8794;1691;The story is gripping and action.
I:8794;1692;The music is hauntingly alluring and the depiction of historical fact is overwhelming.
I:8794;1693;This movie will leave you feeling emotionally drained.
I:8794;1694;If you like love stories set amid turbulent times, this movie is for you!
I:8794;1695;I really enjoyed this movie, and it gets better every time I see it.
I:8794;1696;Although it is nothing compared to the book, this movie is a sweeping tale of love and loss.
I:8794;1697;Great script, Great acting, and lots of cool behind the scenes videos and info.
I:8794;1698;Get it and enjoy watching it!
I:8794;1699;I was happy to find out that so many people take the film story so much to heart.
I:8794;1700;Thats really moving because the story and the real history behind it are not at all easy to grasp and appreciate.
I:8794;1701;the movie itself looks funny .
I:8794;1702;I have to watch this every few years and it is still one of the best movies I every have watched.
I:8794;1703;Such a moving and emotional movie based on the novel.
I:8794;1704;A man torn between two loves and set during the Bolshevick revolution in Russia.
I:8794;1705;He was driven through life by his compassion and love for his fellow man.
I:8794;1706;His love of Laura gave him the strength to continue.
I:8794;1707;Such a lovely movie and a great novel too.
I:8794;1708;It has to be one of the greatest movies of all time.
I:8794;1709;We really enjoyed watching it again, and our family now wants to borrow it.
I:8794;1710;"I can't say that ""Dr. Zhivago"" is David Lean's best film (""Lawrence of Arabia"" would hold that title), but it's still a luscious, well."
I:8794;1711;produced epic that concerns a love story during the Russian Revolution.
I:8794;1712;"And, like ""Titanic,"" ""Dr. Zhivago"" is visually stunning, even more so on this 2."
I:8794;1713;The picture is crisp and vibrant, and the sound (5.1 surround) holds up so well for a 36 year old picture.
I:8794;1714;And the features contain both original featurettes as well as a retrospective documentary on the motion picture.
I:8794;1715;ray was done really well, you wouldn't know this movie was made in 1965.
I:8794;1716;When I saw it the first time, it was a lovely portrayal of a family in the upheavals of Russia.
I:8794;1717;I read the original book and was captivated by the theme.
I:8794;1718;The book is more detailed about the communism and its impact on the people.
I:8794;1719;the movie is well photographed and put together.
I:8794;1720;Some of the actors like Julie Christie and Rod Steiger do a lovely job.
I:8794;1721;The part with Zhivago and his wife was lovely and will tear you apart.
I:8794;1722;While the movie does not do justice to the book, it is still impressive.
I:8794;1723;The 2 disc version is a lovely version.
I:8794;1724;This is one of the great movies of David Lean.
I:8794;1725;Though it does not have the touch in Bridge on the River Kwai, it is very good.
I:8794;1726;I still love it today because of Julie Christie and Omar Sharif.
I:8794;1727;And the scenery is beautiful.
I:8794;1728;the love song from the movie.
I:8794;1729;DR. ZHIVAGO was one of the last great epic films produced by Hollywood.
I:8794;1730;In the 1950's and 60's, a string of films were produced that resembled closely resembled grand opera without music: the casts were large, the stories intricate, and the settings spectacular.
I:8794;1731;Others are notable disasters, with CLEOPATRA perhaps being the best known example.
I:8794;1732;DR. ZHIVAGO may be the most enduring of these epic films.
I:8794;1733;The film boasts of an all star cast.
I:8794;1734;It has one of the most beloved musical scores.
I:8794;1735;Few American films in the early 1960's dealt with a man who loved two women with love scenes to boot!
I:8794;1736;He follows in the footsteps of the man who raised him and becomes a doctor, but at heart he's a poet and writes beautiful verse.
I:8794;1737;The film is more than just a story of a love triangle.
I:8794;1738;The fact that Yuri is both a doctor who cares for the sick and a poet who cares for the heart is meant to show the triumph of the human spirit in the midst of tragedy.
I:8794;1739;Perhaps this is why the story still has power today.
I:8794;1740;It's a great addition to any film collection, especially since this is a film that can be seen more than once and always be appreciated.
I:8794;1741;come on it wasnt that great
I:8794;1742;I received the package ahead of schedule.
I:8794;1743;It shows what happens in a communist nation, and it's scary to think about.
I:8794;1744;This classic looks great in the new format, happy to have it back in our library
I:8794;1745;I think James Cameron got the idea for Titanic from this movie: a major historical event, wrapped around a love story.
I:8794;1746;The main character Yuri Zhivago is caught up in the Russian revolution, and it affects his life in several ways.
I:8794;1747;He has two loves in this movie and both are challenged by the revolution.
I:8794;1748;Zhivago just wants to live his life in peace with his family, use his Doctoring to help people, and stay out of politics.
I:8794;1749;I bought it for my mom.
I:8794;1750;Ever since I was a kid my mom has raved what a beautiful story the movie shows.
I:8794;1751;This story is a classic in my opinion.
I:8794;1752;A few scenes were a bit overacted, but still very enjoyable for me.
I:8794;1753;This book is a classic!
I:8794;1754;I remember seeing this at the theatre on the first wide screen have loved it.
I:8794;1755;Dr. Zhivago is a timeless literary wonder!
I:8794;1756;Beautifully written and one incredible movie!
I:8794;1757;Any one who loves romance and all that good stuff.
I:8794;1758;What can I say,the best in film is hard to improve on.
I:8794;1759;All the photography is excellent and the acting is by far the best ever done.
I:8794;1760;Get this film and see it often is what I think.
I:8794;1761;It may help you in your own life.
I:8794;1762;The photography and editing are occasionally stunning, but they deserve a better story and a better cast of actors.
I:8794;1763;Sharif and Christie look wonderful, but can barely deliver their lines.
I:8794;1764;They are a feature of most of Lean's films, and never are such sequences more welcome than when they crop up in Dr. Zhivago.
I:8794;1765;But they're worth the effort.
I:8794;1766;She deserved better than this movie.
I:8794;1767;The depth of this master piece is timeless for all generations to come.
I:8794;1768;Every so often one realizes that when events in history happen, it changes the lives of people to the extent that can only be read about or viewed to believe.
I:8794;1769;The loneliness, and then joy, Fear,uncertainty, and ultimately sorrow.
I:8794;1770;Yeah, but men who appreciate history will find much of interest as well.
I:8794;1771;It's a piece of cinema history folks, and deserves to be seen.
