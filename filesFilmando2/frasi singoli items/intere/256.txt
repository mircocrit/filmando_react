I:383;1;The effects, I'll admit right up front, were great.
I:383;2;True sucking is like that.
I:383;3;This is another very funny Tim Allen Movie.
I:383;4;Great for the whole family to see
I:383;5;Any movie with a Bearded Collie is a wonderful movie.
I:383;6;This one has lots of Beardie action.
I:383;7;It is very funny and another great picture from Tim Allen.
I:383;8;I did, and I am very happy that I did.
I:383;9;Anything Tim Allen is in is good!
I:383;10;This is a great family movie, my kids loved it!
I:383;11;it is cute and funny!
I:383;12;I liked the movie better than the original and Tim Allen did a marvelous job of playing an overworked dad and a lovable family dog.
I:383;13;"The movie also stars his wife (Kristen Davis
I:383;14;This is a great family movie and it will keep you laughing every couple of minutes.
I:383;15;The actors played their parts so well and realistically that it was hard to tell that they were just acting.
I:383;16;i definitely recommend this movie for all ages.
I:383;17;is suddenly right and had been right all along.
I:383;18;the shaggy dog is an awesome movie i love tim allen's performance in this updated remake of the original movie.
I:383;19;this is a good movie.
I:383;20;i recommend it for everyone
I:383;21;I have been watching this film on STARZ over the last two days and just thought it was wonderful!
I:383;22;The movie is a very modern take on important issues like genetic engineering and cruetly to animals during scientific research projects.
I:383;23;It emphasized family values very nicely.
I:383;24;Growing up in the 50s and 60s I enjoyed the good guys winning without resorting to violence.
I:383;25;Tim Allen does a really great job impersonating a dog.
I:383;26;Overall this is a feel good movie.
I:383;27;very funny, Tim Allen at his best.
I:383;28;We saw this movie at the theater and absolutely loved it!
I:383;29;Tim Allen is so funny in this movie!
I:383;30;There are some great special effects, action scenes that your kids will split up in laughter with!
I:383;31;The character fits Tim Allen very well, he's kind of a scatter brained all business/attorney dad that trys to do the right thing, maybe spreading himself too thin, ultimately overlooking the ever changing needs of his growing children.
I:383;32;There are some comical scenes of Tim slobbering, scratching, doing really funny dog things, sometimes infront of his court proceedings and clients, yikes!
I:383;33;Likewise, the dog is able to understand and communicate non.
I:383;34;I really liked this movie.
I:383;35;I think Tim Allen really does a good job at acting like a dog.
I:383;36;It was a lot of fun to watch this with my family.
I:383;37;Definitely will be added to my video library in the near future :.)
I:383;38;I ordered this on demand for my niece and I didn't expect to like it and I did.
I:383;39;Although I admit Tim Allen deserves better.
I:383;40;I thought he'd go on to more good movies since Galaxy Quest.
I:383;41;Although I admit I thought Big Trouble was decent.
I:383;42;Still it's mildly funny and entertaining and not a bad movie for the whole family.
I:383;43;rated actor that always adds some fun to no matter what movie he is in.
I:383;44;I disagree with Ebert and Roeper who basically said he was the best thing about the movie though.
I:383;45;Very cute movie, my six year old watches again and again.
I:383;46;Not so much for me, but a really good remake and Tim Allen does a wonderful job with the kid humor.
I:383;47;My four year old and I laughed our tummies off.
I:383;48;Tim Allen is really funny in this as the dog/man.
I:383;49;The Shaggy Dog is worth a couple of views if not more.
I:383;50;"command (a very funny Robert Downey, Jr.) is determined to get the teacher put away so that he can continue his ""ethical"" experiments."
I:383;51;all of the chaos is pulled off with solid comedic effort.
I:383;52;There's no strong language that I recall, only brief peril, the action is humorous and the cast looks as if they had fun making the film.
I:383;53;The special effects are decent, and Tim Allen's transformations are swiftly executed without revealing much to the crowd.
I:383;54;There's also a light anti.
I:383;55;the supporting cast is solid for a light film such as this.
I:383;56;Danny Glover, Jane Curtin, Philip Baker Hall and Annabelle Gurwitch all give solid and funny performances.
I:383;57;It won't win any awards but it will entertain the entire family.
I:383;58;Tim Allen has become a staple of family entertainment, and this flick only solidifies that.
I:383;59;I give this film a strong family recommendation.
I:383;60;We love all of his movies.
I:383;61;tim is hillarious, as always, and the dog is great.
I:383;62;this is a great remake.
I:383;63;this was a great family movie.
I:383;64;he's a tough guy but he enjoyed this movie too.
I:383;65;and frees the dog, taking it home with them.
I:383;66;His quirky demeanor is extremely funny, and he seems to have modeled it somewhat off of his performance in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang.
I:383;67;The only really worthwhile is 1999's underrated Galaxy Quest.
I:383;68;My advice is to follow in the footsteps of such comedic talents as Jim Carrey and Robin Williams and take a stab at a serious film now and then.
I:383;69;certainly not an Academy Award winner but entertaining!
I:383;70;This movie will be part of a movie theme basket gift!
I:383;71;It will go with popcorn and other snacks and possibly a 6.
I:383;72;There were some funny parts and Tim Allen played a very good role.
I:383;73;A subplot involving the fountain of youth is added on for padding, but it's really Allen's comic finesse and a hammy supporting performance by Robert Downey Jr. that makes this film so much fun.
I:383;74;This is a good movie for the family and provides good entertainment to those of all ages.
I:383;75;It is a fun kid movie and I like Tim Allen.
I:383;76;The original shaggy dog is good also.
I:383;77;This is one of the best version of the Shaggy Dog I've seen.
I:383;78;Tim Allen and all the other performers do an outstanding job in bringing their characters to life.
I:383;79;There's plenty of action and definately a lot of humor.
I:383;80;I expected it to be geared more towards the younger audiences but it's great for adults too.
I:383;81;"If you're ""down and out"" and need ""a pick me up"" this is definately one of the best DVSs to watch."
I:383;82;I HAD to see the rest.
I:383;83;This is an original movie and is funny!
I:383;84;This is an awesome remake!
I:383;85;In my opinion, it's funnier and better than the original.
I:383;86;Tim Allen does an awesome job at being a dog.
I:383;87;If you love comedy, Tim Allen, and dogs, you'll love THE SHAGGY DOG!!!
I:383;88;This was a gift for our Granddaughter and we looked at every store we could think of and couldn't find it.
I:383;89;Thanks for such great service and products.
I:383;90;Like pretty much the leads in this movies, I have seen thier movies and liked htem better in, but this one, they might as well.
I:383;91;This is a fun movie and Tim Allen is at the top of his comedic form.
I:383;92;I remember seeing the original Shaggy Dog as a girl so I wondered if I would enjoy a remake but I liked it.
I:383;93;A fun movie for the family to enjoy.
I:383;94;"Earlier collaborations between comedian Tim Allen and Disney, including ""The Santa Clause"" and ""Jungle 2 Jungle"" were always hilarious."
I:383;95;"true storyline, the oft remade ""The Shaggy Dog"" was a safe bet on Disney's part."
I:383;96;"This isn't Tim Allen's funniest movie and this isn't the most vibrant remake of ""The Shaggy Dog"", but it does manage to be at least mildly amusing all the way through, and at times it's even hilarious."
I:383;97;there are two levels of humor in this movie.
I:383;98;Young children will love Tim Allen's goofy physical humor.
I:383;99;Older audiences should appreciate the more subtle tricks Tim Allen uses to make his human character seem increasingly dog.
I:383;100;There are also some nifty computer generated effects, including a series of intriguing mutant animals.
I:383;101;A real cute movie the whole family could enjoy and we laughed out loud.
I:383;102;it's been a long time Tim is sooo funny
I:383;103;And I had to sit my sister again that night, so I wanted something with animals in it.
I:383;104;So I was in kind of a quandary.
I:383;105;was it good as a kid's movie?
I:383;106;If you time it right, this can be a really enjoyable experience.
I:383;107;It helps if one of your friends can do a pretty good Scooby Doo impersonation and say funny stuff whenever the Shaggy Dog is on screen.
I:383;108;The plot was well put together and solid.
I:383;109;I have watched it a couple of times now and enjoy it more each time I see it.
I:383;110;I really am enjoying the fun of this film.
I:383;111;I'd suggest to folks to just relax and watch a terrific and humorous film.
I:383;112;It is made to be light with family values of what counts in life.
I:383;113;Tim did an outstanding job as he always does.
I:383;114;It is one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time.
I:383;115;I'm thrilled to see Disney making such terrific and wonderful films.
I:383;116;The caged scenes were carefully done.
I:383;117;No bad language just a wonderful film that can be enjoyed as another eventual classic among the Disney films.
I:383;118;It is a wonderful film with a great storyline!!
I:383;119;The Shaggy Dog is a suprisingly very entertaining and very funny movie.
I:383;120;A good family movie that can be seen by the entire family with out worrying about if the next seen or next word is going to be unsuitable for children.
I:383;121;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:383;122;Tim Allen is one of my favorite comedians.
I:383;123;It's one of those movies that you want to watch over and over again, and you'll laugh as hard as the first time.
I:383;124;great for a family movie.
I:383;125;"Tim Allen is Dave Douglas, a deputy DA who is turned into ""a shaggy dog""."
I:383;126;to his credit Tim Allen does his best, making us laugh with his amusing comic performances of the man.
I:383;127;oriented pictures, we often write `Kids will love it' or something like that.
I:383;128;incredible thing is, the first plot is given a far.
I:383;129;perhaps, as more than one reviewer on the net point out, Robert Downey Jr. who is really good with his perfect goofiness as the clueless villain, should have played the protagonist instead of Tim Allen.
I:383;130;It was funny to me.
I:383;131;Tim Allen is very good where he gets to use his silly style of humor so of course he's best in kid's movies.
I:383;132;I liked him and the special effects.
I:383;133;He liked anyone associated with him to have a squeaky clean image.
I:383;134;This is a Disney film for children!As a kids' movie, it's a lot of fun with plenty of slapstick and lots of laughs.
