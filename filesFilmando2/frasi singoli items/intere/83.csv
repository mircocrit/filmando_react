1;Along with the other two, this movie is a must.
2;I always prefer full screen edition movies and Batman Begins is a great movie!
3;Im a pretty huge batman fan!
4;But all in all Good service over all and nice lil gift product for the price
5;Batman Has always been one of my favorite comic heroes.
6;It explores how Bruce Wayne evolves into Batman from his Ninja like training to his cool gear.
7;his mentor becomes his nemesis in a great finale.
8;This is a really cool movie.
9;I have to admit, I liked the first Batman film that starred Michael Keaton, Kim Bassinger, and Jack Nicholson (an unforgettable Joker!)
10;This film was much more gripping: the story was compelling and the cast (including Christian Bale, Michael Cain, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson) is magnificent.
11;Prior to this, I thought that the Marvel franchise was putting out the best comic movies.
12;definition TV, navigating the disk is intuitive, and the extras are entertaining enough.
13;Some of the most impressive scenes are actually near the beginning of the film, when Bruce Wayne is being trained in the ninja arts in the Himalayas.
14;For me, it's all about enjoying the movie experience at home, and Batman Begins definitely delivers.
15;This movie is great iam not gonna ruin anything but the movie is definitly worth your time its abit long but entertaning and the ending is the best setting up for the original with you know who the joker go see this movie its is so good i hope Bale does more batman movies is the future and with the same team and without a doubt the best sequel
16;The movie is great, but the service (and prices) amazon provides for this film is great.
17;cool to see where it all began.
18;Batman Begins is by far one of my favorite movies and an amazing retelling of the Batman legend.
19;Amazon definitely had the best price for the combo you get in the deal.
20;It's Batman and it's awesomeCons:.
21;NoneOverall great movie and great price.
22;Batman Begins was for me quite an enjoyment to behold.
23;It was well made and actually had some depth.
24;And I can't help but reflect on how much more I connected with the original version than this one.
25;I truly feel that soo many people are just jumping the gun and calling this the best Batman and placing it over the original which to me is utterly insane.
26;I have tremendous respect for Bale as an actor.
27;And I knew all along he would be a good Bruce Wayne and Batman.
28;His face fit so perfectly behind that mask that he seemed born for it.
29;I always found him to be an admirable actor and especially after witnessing his version of Patrick Bateman I knew this guy was heading places.
30;It seems that the one thing I really can give Nolan credit for is breathing some new life back into the series after being destroyed by you know who.
31;Batman Begins did have its powerful somewhat magical moments.
32;And to me it makes sense why many hold this one higher than Burton's, mainly because a lot of people look down on fantasy.
33;Surprisingly the mythical aspect of the hero works out in both Nolan's realism and Burton's fantasy which is quite interesting.
34;action Batman movie to actually explain his origin.
35;A huge theme of the movie is how screwed up the criminal justice system is.
36;the fighting was pretty good.
37;hes quite a bit more brutal than the tim burton batmen,which is really cool.
38;the best thing about it by far is the tank like batmobile!now that fn rocked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
39;A Batman movie that the real fans have been waiting for!
40;I always thought the Warner Bros. animated series would always be the best telling of the Batman story, but this movie even gives that a run for it's money.
41;Christian Bale gives a moving performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman, the best I've seen on the big screen anyway.
42;"I kept expecting her to say something like,""Wait!"
43;overall the movie is great.
44;Finally, a realistic Batman who isnt made to look like a dork!
45;Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman was incredible.
46;The rest of the cast was excellent except in my opinion Katie Holmes.
47;In addition to what has already been said, I wanted to mention a few of the elements of the movie that really make the film shine.
48;I absolutely loved how most of the times he would take down the bad guys was when he would repel down from above to envelop the enemy and zip up back up high via his grappling gun.
49;batman begins and returns as he was intended to be.
50;Not an invulnerable superhuman terminator, but a flesh and blood man armed with passion for justice, fighting skills and good equipment.
51;The movie was excellent in portraying what Batman was to begin with .
52;a very well done movie worth your time and money.
53;Wow, I love the look of the first five minutes.
54;Triple the price, perfectly legal, royalties to the authors and such.
55;Wow, I love the look of the first five minutes.
56;I bet you, my readers, have already seen this film.
57;But if not, well, find a way to see it right now.
58;You'll love it the way I do.
59;He trains with a group known as the League of Shadows (with the excellent Liam Neeson) and even learns how to get along with them.
60;however, that is the most (or least) Batman, played by the excellent Christian Bale, will allow.
61;He will preserve the art and skill of a fighting technique, but otherwise trusts entirely to gadgets, and of course, Wayne Enterprises and his luxurious outfit.
62;Batman has trained himself for this moment and has an antidote, and it's here where the fighter's skills show up.
63;His ultimate insight: Save the girl, win the movie, be a good hero, makes others into heroes as well.
64;at the end of the movie, you're treated to a nice look at the beginning of the original Batman.
65;A nice end to a climactic, and very spiritual, script.
66;Batman Begins easily makes itself more important and more of an event than any other Batman film in history.
67;here is where we finally see everything that turned the orphan boy into the Caped Crusader and Dark Knight, with excellent supporting acts by Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon, and even the superb Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth.
68;the film is fresh and original and ends with the possibility of a sequel so perhaps this is only a new beginning than a final coda for this legendary crimefighter.
69;But believe me when I say,BATMAN BEGINS is the start of a new and exciting chapter in the life of Bob Kane's creation.
70;Even the batmobile scene through the city isnt exciting.
71;Watch the preview of the dark knight on the disc and you will instantly see the difference.
72;Having just seen The Dark Knight a few days ago, i can say that it easily a 4 star movie.
73;It starts right up and it entertaining throughout.
74;came in quickly in perfect condition
75;Batman Begins is the best Batman movie by far.
76;I liked the characters and cast.
77;The story was somewhat dark, but there was also humor in it.
78;Such a fresh new beginning for such a great series
79;This is a pretty handy film.
80;With none of the showmanship of the 1989 Batman, this film is almost workmanlike in the way it builds its story, and yet the overall effect is perhaps the best Batman ever.
81;christian Bale is quietly effective as Bruce Wayne, a likeable and soulful hero, and a truly impressive cast of very famous faces from both America and England give him more than enough support.
82;This Batman tale has real depth and only rarely stretches credibility to the point where you are reminded that the film is based on a comic book.
83;The script is deft at every turn, making the unfolding plot seem effortless and natural.
84;best of all, it relies on great acting, writing, direction and plot, seemlessly interwoven, rather than special effects to hold your attention.
85;"without a hint of Hollywood's usual, typical ""look at me"" ostentatiousness, Batman Begins may be the most totally watchable and satisfying comic book hero movie I've ever seen."
86;mention simply must be made of Michael Cain's Alfred.
87;the man is classy, and genuinely funny, which stands out in a serious and compelling tale like this one.
88;batman Begins is a film I highly recommend.
89;Oh good lord, it's about time a good Batman movie came out.
90;starting and revitalizing a franchise that really needs it.
91;"book movies are enormously successful these days (unless you consider ""Elektra"") and fans have been screaming for years for a new film to be made."
92;One that makes us all appreciate Batman again, and doesn't make us feel ashamed to be fans.
93;"director Christopher Nolan (""Insomnia,"" ""Memento"") steps up to the plate, leading an outstanding cast which includes Christian Bale as the big."
94;earred superhero in question, and recent tabloid queen Katie Holmes as his childhood friend/love interest.
95;versed in action flicks, but his dark vision is perfect for Batman.
96;Needless to say, he succeeds in making this the best Batman movie to date.
97;"I love those films to death (heck, even ""Batman Forever"" was pretty decent), they are an important part of my childhood, but Nolan's Batman goes places Burton never bothered."
98;Here, we are treated to the true origins of Bruce Wayne, the man, and how he came to be Batman.
99;Half the movie is spent building up this enormous, complex character.
100;Michael Caine definitely delivers as Alfred, as does Morgan Freeman as Lucuis Fox (but they're always great).
101;Everything about this movie is just incredible.
102;"I thought we were treated when ""Star Wars"" went out with a fight last month, and now Batman finally gets his respect with ""Batman Begins."""
103;It is very well made and very respectful to the source material.
104;It's actually worth the time you invest in it.
105;There's a moment in this film where Bruce Wayne and Alfred go over the design to the batsuit's mask.
106;After two abysmal Joel Schumacher films with the Batman film series, the better part of the movie.
107;The batmobile in the original had such a unique style, and it was believable.
108;I found myself, for the first time in a movie theater, closing my ears because I couldn't take it.
109;batman himself is now something of an allegorical hero.
110;Batman is a character who appeals to the outsider, the loner, the freak who gets shunned by society.
111;Batman, by his nature, is a corrupted human.
112;Batman is a kind of Zeus, or Apollo, such as Spiderman and Superman are.
113;The original Tim Burton 'Batman' was a success because it had a style, it had a particular energy in the script, and the performances were not overdone.
114;interesting in its best moments.
115;it's great story telling by Nolan and I hope there is a boxed.
116;Christopher Nolan has done his homework, stayed true to dark, graphic stories that follow this hero, and set in place a cast that equally carry the weight of this film on their shoulders.
117;I remember saying to a friend that the reason this film worked was because of the cast.
118;acting of some, the celebrity status of others, and some that were just plain goofy, but now Nolan has given us a cast that carries this film into a whole new ballgame.
119;With names like this you know that you are walking into greatness.
120;I was worried at first about Caine as Alfred, but with the greatest of ease he turned what could have been the comic character of the film into this powerful voice of Wayne's conscious.
121;His ability to frame each shot like a moment in the books, create these breathing characters that you can actually believe exist, as well as tell a story that has been corrupted by the Hollywood recycling machine takes talent and Nolan did it.
122;I have been a huge fan of everything that Nolan has touched.
123;I get excited to see his work because it changes with each picture.
124;I saw it in his earlier films and it shined brightly in Batman Begins.
125;She was underdefined and basically eye.
126;candy for the younger Dawson's Creek audience members.
127;These were minor insecurities that I had with this overall brilliant film.
128;I could see this film again and again.
129;Nolan created the perfect tone and story for our disturbed hero.
130;He took the goofy elements from Burton, erased Kilmer/Clooney, and brought us back to our roots.
131;This film was perfection on a stick.
132;I got this product for my father and he was very content.
133;well, except a Triumph TT of course.
134;This movie will most likely be good.
135;The movie does have two really good villians though, Ras Ah Gauhl played by Ken Wantanbe and The Scarecrow played by Cillian Murphy.
136;THe story is about Bruce Wayne played by Christian Bale becoming Batman.
137;The new Batman movies are awesome.
138;I love Batman, I hope they come out with a third movie soon.
139;It's the first batman that really could be a true story.
140;As a young child, i remember seeing batman returns in theaters.
141;When i herd that batman would be alot more realistic, i thought, wow what a great idea.
142;as for the story, pure genus.
143;It takes its cues from the best of the batman graphic novels, and yet combines them together to form a well thoughout and told story that shines new light on batman and his motives for what and why he does what he does.
144;this movie is the best movie to date.
145;This movie felt right from the first sequence to the ending.
146;The feel and look of the characters perfect.
147;any batman fan will love this movie.
148;Great A. list cast and acting, wonderful effects, and for once true to the Batman roots.
149;This is by far the best Batman series I have seen.
150;It is closer to the dark comics I read as a child and I am looking forward to the second movie The Dark Knight.
151;It's an all around solid film, something that couldn't be said of Burton's pictures while they were immensely entertaining on the outside layer.
152;I loved this trilogy but this one is my least favorite.
153;Other than that, it was a great origin story for the Batman lore
154;this time i got the comic that went along with it and o my GOSH i ABSOLUTELY love that it has a comic with it wish comic could be packaged with other movies .
155;I believe that this is the best Batman saga put out to date.
156;ray just makes it that much better!
157;This is so good and blast cool a movie!
158;foes, but more than that, Christian Bale is the second best Batman next to Micheal Keaton!
159;The scariness was at a perfect level, all the fight scenes were made like a rich cake, there were so many good and memorable lines, and I just gotta say it!
160;Batman Begins rules the world of DC comics!
161;This is a must watch movie.
162;there are no features but a great movie.
163;This is a very good movie in a series of three that ranks in my top ten for series.
164;I highly recommend any of these Batman movies if you haven't seen them, if you have, you already know they are worth the prices you can pick them up for on Amazon.
165;This group has a truly utilitarian view of justice seeing that it doesn't matter who gets hurt as long as in the end more happiness and peace can be seen in the world.
166;overall this movie is a good watch although there are some philosophical reservations that should be taken into account.
167;"It is an interesting fact that the ""bad guys"" where a group with a utilitarian philosophy and the ""good guy"" had a self imposed ethical code which is a very postmodern way of thought."
168;This is interesting because postmodernism is the trendy thing or the worldview that is in at the moment.
169;batman is yet another in a series of dark heroes who push the line as far as most can accept it.
170;It is rare that a casting for something like this is done right.
171;this is by far the best comic book movie to ever grace the screen (a close one with Superman the movie).
172;Well for one clever writing.
173;Two great director and three the acting.
174;This was a top notch cast.
175;The young child who played Bruce deserves a mention here because he did a great job.
176;From a person who grew up reading about Batman comics this was a treat.
177;dTS, watching it in mere DTS was a thrill.
178;great action movie with great cast.
179;"prologue to the ""The Dark Knight"" is definitely an added bonus featureto view it first in High."
180;the film it self has many components that make a great film : action, protagonist, antagonist, etc.
181;I had to force myself to sit and watch it after the first hour and half lolBut it is a good movie!
182;Christian Bale is perfect casting call for Batman.
183;I'm just filling in the required amount of words here.
184;All that can be said has been.
185;This is an excellent film!
186;Returns were easy and efficient.
187;She refused to screen it.
188;A few weeks later, I received a text from my mom, Batman Begins is AWESOME.
189;Great Movie and love that I can have it stream directly through my TIVO at home OR can watch it on the road.
190;I have to say it looks pretty good!
191;Man, it's Batman for pete's sake!
192;All I have to say is wow, the movie does not only look great.
193;Nice edition to a good movie.
194;Such an amazingly awesome film!
195;What a masterpiece of a movie.
196;Seldom do you come across a script as flawless as this.
197;The fact that he still believes that the world in general and Gotham City in particular is what helps him hold onto his sanity.
198;the movie is dark, visually and thematically as it should be.
199;At last, there is a film worthy of DC Comics' second great superhero.
200;When Tim Burton's 1989 film came out, I was very impressed, and enjoyed the film immensely (even if I never was completely sold on Michael Keaton as Batman).
201;It's interesting how the passage of the years, and the appearance of numerous other superhero pictures, has affected my perception of both films.
202;Even if the special effects are a little dated, Richard Donner's Superman film remains a powerful, thrilling, entertaining movie, and is still the definitive movie treatment of the character.
203;fortunately for Batman fans, Christopher Nolan does it much, much better.
204;And like the 1978 Superman movie, the story of the character's journey is told so well you don't mind waiting that long.
205;Moreover, when the hero does appear, the wait is well worth it.
206;He stays in the shadows, taking out criminals without ever giving them a good look at him.
207;He portrays the real Bruce Wayne in his scenes with Alfred and Rachel, and the Bertie Wooster playboy Wayne becomes for the public, making him far more true to the comic book character, and also giving him far more depth than Keaton's maladjusted geek, or Val Kilmer's angst.
208;The supporting characters are much more interesting than in Burton's film, as well.
209;I was leery of a cockney Alfred, but Michael Caine does an outstanding job, and you can really see how Bruce Wayne would see him as a father figure, not just as the hired help.
210;Gary Oldman is superb as Commissioner.
211;And Morgan Freeman is great as Lucius Fox.
212;I really hope they can follow this movie up with sequels that are worthy of it.
213;Fortunately, Christopher Nolan rescued a great and enduring character from the hands of those who almost destroyed him.
214;It's about time they got a DC comic right.
215;"After the recent series of big screen Batman films one wonders how a film titled ""Batman Begins"" could add anything to the story, but this one does."
216;This film fills in the gaps and fits nicely with the films that have gone on before.
217;This is one of the better Batman films.
218;Shipped fast and was in perfect condition when it arrived.
219;The guy grows up wanting revenge.
220;Batman a villain, as you put it?
221;Batman Begins brings a whole new real.
222;world feel to the legend, and should mark the beginning of a whole new, much grander franchise.
223;As a long time fan of Batman I have longed to see a big screen Batman that displayed the depth and power of the character I had come to enjoy while reading: Batman: Year One, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Batman: The Long Halloween, Batman: The Killing Joke.
224;A movie that had more in common with the campy Adam West series of the 60's then the character I had come to enjoy in the comic books.
225;I could almost see flashes of Frank Miller in the script with I'm sure fans of Batman: Year One will recognize and enjoy.
226;batman Begins is filled with great performance from Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Nieson, and Gary Oldman.
227;star supporting cast can steal the light from Christian Bale.
228;As Batman he delievers the sharp obessiveness that I had come to look for in Batman.
229;Let me say first up, I love this film.
230;It's delightful to finally see such accomplished filmmakers pay tribute to one of Batman's greatest enemies.
231;The docos don't quite reach the heights of the Lord of the Rings Extended Editions, but they still make for interesting and informative viewing.
232;"I don't want to be critical of Tim Burtons ""Batman"" with Michael Keaton as the first caped crusader, which was fresh, dark and engaging when it first hit the screen, but this is better."
233;christian Bale brings vehemence to the role not seen before in my opinion, and although the story suffers (like all first installments) of a good deal of story explanation the end result is arguably the best Batman flick to date.
234;With the help of his butler Alfred (played very ably by Michael Caine) and Morgan Freeman as a scientist working for Wayne Industries, he creates Batman, and then the story really begins to unfurl.
235;this is a very good movie, and considering the talent on display is not (I'm happy to say) a CGI festival or cartoon revenge story.
236;Gary Oldman, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe as well as those already mentioned are well cast in their respective roles, and there is a real polished feel to the whole picture.
237;other than that, just about everything is here, villains a plenty, the necessary love interest, and the whole story told anew, with a fresh approach that seems to stay faithful to the DC comics creation.
238;I actually forgot about the other Batman movies while watching which is testament to the production here.
239;you'll have to see for yourself.
240;This was the best reboot of any comic character franchise.
241;Many of the scenarios in the movie seemed very plausible for the real world and as a comic fan, that combination has made it one of my all time favorite comic to movies ever.
242;Excellent movie and an excellent story as well.
243;The Good Things*Some good action scenes, especially at the end.
244;Special effects are very unique.
245;*Excellent filming style and cinematography.
246;It's a little choppy and weird, but also very detailed and vivid.
247;Also very dark, moody, and realistic.
248;*Storyline is great, and makes perfect sense as long as you pay attention.
249;There is a logical explanation for everything he has and where it all came from.
250;inspiring crime fighter is very convincing and deep.
251;*In conjunction with the characterizations, this movie also has very strong themes about fear, destiny, and human preserverance.
252;cut that they are hard to really see (but it is a more intense style).
253;"It is also closer to what Batman should really be like, and above all, has some very deep meaning in the character that I would have never caught onto before (Bruce using his own fear to instill fear into others
254;It is surprisingly complex, but the dialogue and acting makes it all very understandable.
255;And of course, the plot is great and ties everything together into one complete circle.
256;Combined with a strong visual style, this is definately one of the best superhero movies made to date.
257;if they keep this up, I seriously hope that they will turn the """"Knightfall"""" comics into a movie too."""
258;disc version has a trailer.
259;disc has a bunch of featurettes and a funny MTV movie awards skit.
260;First off, let me state that I am a fan of the first, and even the second, Batman movies with Michael Keaton.
261;Christian Bale's portrayal is so unbelievably good!!!
262;"He managed to make me sympathetic to Bruce Wayne and brought real depth to the millionare playboy
263;Gary Oldman was so good and convincing as Gordon that I didn't even realise he was the same man who played Sirius Black!
264;The acting in this film was the best of all the movies and I look forward to a sequel and Nolan's interpretation of The Joker!!!
265;ray] This movie and The Dark Knight are my two favorite batman movies so far.
266;Great Story and effects and Christian Bale gives his all and doesn't take the role as child's play and that really sells it.
267;The Batman movies, Spiderman movies and the original Superman movie with Christopher Reeves is how superhero movies should be done.
268;Watch these before making a superhero movie directors.
269;First, it begins with a young Bruce Wayne in a Chinese prison camp, fighting off about a dozen attackers.
270;He does so easily, because he is a mighty white man, of course.
271;Bruce soon fights the Asian """"master"""" of the school, and wins."""
272;"Later, Bruce finds out that Asian ""master"" was a dupe, and the real ninja master was that debonaire white man."
273;One of the biggest surprises in cinema that said year, `Batman Begins' proves to be everything one could ask for in a superhero movie.
274;It's got some breathtaking action scenes, some great fight scenes and some amazing special effects.
275;What takes this film over the edge though, making it far removed from the previous efforts is that the script is tight, the acting is superb and the characters are so well fleshed out that they become three dimensional.
276;Christian Bale does such a brilliant job with his character that I'm tempted to say he was snubbed come awards season.
277;He took a character that has been played before with no real depth and transformed him into someone we could relate to and cheer for.
278;It's a general retelling of The Dark Knights origin so it's bound to be a lot of story telling versus an over abundance of action.
279;I actually enjoyed watching Wayne's story slowly unfold.
280;It's very interesting to see where he got his start since the concept has not been pursued in any of the Batman films before this one.
281;like I mentioned, Bale does a fantastic job with tackling both Bruce Wayne and Batman, two separate characters who both need delicate attention.
282;Another standout performance comes from rising star Cillian Murphy who devours his role as Jonathan Crane or better known as `The Scarecrow'.
283;Michael Caine is perfectly cast (and I was skeptical) as Alfred, the family butler and Liam Neeson is always good, and as Wayne's mentor Henri Ducard he's especially effective.
284;Katie Holmes is decent, but her role is somewhat thankless, as is Morgan Freeman's but he still delivers.
285;so, with all this talk of actors pulling out the stops I need to mention the brilliance that was and is Christopher Nolan who was, I'm sure, very close to Oscar consideration for his direction here.
286;He effortlessly staged this entire film and delivers wonderfully, from his script to his finished product.
287;The set pieces are fantastic, the action scenes are well choreographed and the pace of the film, the editing is all fantastic and close to perfect.
288;"The props, everything from gadgets to the new and totally improved Batmobile, are brilliantly modernized and dare I say ""oh so cool""."
289;The film deserves our attention and will garner repeat viewings.
290;With a cast this huge, and equally impressive, and a director this in tune with his subject, `Batman Begins' never falters and remains one of the best films of 2005.
291;Great take on the batman franchise.
292;And the great actors of Caine and Morgan are left on the sidelines.
293;one to explain emotion and one to explain gadgets.
294;Christopher Nolan does a great job reintroducing the Batman character.
295;I have seen the movie before, and it was still enjoyable to watch again.
296;Batman is intelligent, he figures out mysteries he makes good descisions.
297;I'm tired of Hollywood giving us the same crappy predictable movies and everyone is happy with it.
298;Alot of people liked this movie, I didn't.
299;I think it was a good descision of Nolan's to start from the beginning.
300;it's intriguing, this film, with plenty of good acting and casting.
301;christian Bale is also very good.
302;He is a very good actor.
303;something that appealed to me, opposing popular superhero films, is the fact the Bruce Wayne doesn't actually have super powers.
304;"Not only does this saves us from a corny ""scientific"" explanation (cosmic radiation, more than likely) for why he can do this or that, but it also helped me connect with the character more."
305;it's a good start for what should be one heck of a series.
306;"favorite line: ""He's driving a black."
307;This is the first one of a new serie!
308;As a matter of fact, it's a good thing pretending that these movies never happened because all of them are very untrue to the comics, so forget about them!Batman Begins is the first movie that adapted Batman's comics the right way.
309;even better: this movie can also work as a prelude to Mask of the Phantasm (the 90's masterpiece animated movie).
310;So far, both of those heroes have gotten (for the most part) great film adaptions.
311;man movies have been amazing, while the Batman films under the directorship of Tim Burton have been great.
312;this movie has effectively restarted Warner Bros.'s Batman franchise.
313;Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), the son of Gotham City's greatest benefactors, has been spending time in prison in order to beat on the criminals housed within.
314;I think that the Scarecrow can be pretty cool if done right, and this movie definitely did him justice (unlike Two.
315;This is actually the first Batman movie where Batman was the star of the film!
316;"In all of the previous ones, the villains were the ones who got more attention
317;it was pretty cool to actually see Wayne discover and prepare the batcave for use, along with being trained, both of which were passed over in the original Batman movie.
318;for a comic book movie, the acting was exceptionally good.
319;Caine, Freeman, Murphy, and Neeson did the best in my opinion, in their respective roles.
320;Bale did a great Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Gary Oldman was great as a good guy (no, I am not lying"
321;Holmes was fair, but her good looks made up it.
322;this is a film that everyone can enjoy, whether you are a Batman fanboy or a casual film viewer.
323;Batman Begins is so good.
324;It peels away all the colorful villians and over the top stunts and put together a very well written story that's a very believable human story.
325;There's so much going on in the movie and its all actually very relate able.
326;I enjoyed how they introduced the villain of the show the Scarecrow was well done.
327;Spectacular is the only word that comes to mind.
328;Inside, you will also get a nice comic book that is an interesting read for avid Batman fans and newcomers.
329;The included special features disc is another unique view in Christopher Nolan's Batman universe and complements the feature film well.You won't be disappointed in purchasing this set as long as you keep an open mind and see what Christopher Nolan's Batman interpretation is all about: dark, gritty, realism, and intelligent.
330;an epic beginning for the caped crusader.
331;I have seen all the Batman movies and they just keep getting better and better.
332;This is the best work i've seen all my life.
333;It's script is really good too and the actors in it are wonderful.
334;The story embraces you with all the affects and it just makes you feel like this is really something.
335;My Grandson and I loved the movie.
336;Thanks for the great bargain.
337;In my opinion, this is the best Batman movie as it shows how he unveils his alter.
338;He is strong and vulnerable, human and fictitious, dark and yet real.
339;The BATMAN FRANCHISE picks itself up with vengeance!
340;The movie is awesome and the best BATMAN ever put on film!
341;You will learn the origins of Batman better than ever before.
342;A great job by all and Christian Bale was the perfect choice!
343;rAY THOUGHTS: Absolutely worth upgrading.
344;The picture is more vibrant and the blacks look great.
345;The sounds is excellent and all the extras are here.
346;And this was the best Joker ever.
347;Has violence and is a bit dark but compared to many movies with this much action it's great for teens.
348;I just got done seeing it for a fourth time and I've got to say the more and more I see it, the more and more I love it.
349;In my opinion it's by far the best Batman.
350;If you haven't seen this movie, go see it.
351;BATMAN BEGINS, while not containing the brutal anarchy of THE DARK KNIGHT, nor the emotion and drama of THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, is perhaps the most entertaining and satisfying of Nolan's excellent trilogy, not to mention the most faithful to the comics.
352;Suave, charming, and attractive as the billionaire playboy, and menacing, terrifying, and brutal as the Batman, Bale (one of the most versatile and talented actors working today) carries the film with his weighty and brilliant performance.
353;Bale conquers the physical aspect of Batman, and master the tortured psyche and persona of Bruce Wayne.
354;michael Caineis brilliant in his understated role as Alfred, Batman's loyal and often very wise butler.
355;gary Oldmanis absolutely amazing as Lieutenant James Gordon, the one straight cop in the dodgy Gotham underworld.
356;liam Neesonmakes a very effective and charismatic R'as Al Ghul.
357;If Christopher Nolan has one talent, it is putting together excellent casts.
358;The Gotham of the comics is HELL on earth.
359;Christopher Nolan REALLY brought that point across effectively and brilliantly.
360;Fear is both the reason that Batman exists and his greatest weapon.
361;Fear created Batman, it transformed Bruce Wayne.
362;Fear is one of the major themes of Nolan's first Batman film.
363;Neeson's swordfight with Bale early on in the film is excellently shot and acted.
364;Batman's early fights perfectly capture his traditional fighting style: shadows, confusion, fear.
365;Characters literally battle fear later on in the film, and the stakes are high, the fights are gritty and realistic, and the action is engaging.
366;let us see what else helped make Batman awesome again: Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's epic, bloodpumping score (dun DUN dun DUUUUUN!)
367;, the excellent production values, gritty costumes, realistic sets, and cinematography (I tell you that moment where Bruce Wayne sets out to find his destiny in the mountains is _stunning_ imagery).
368;The lack of excessive CGI grounds Batman in reality, but there is humour here, and it is funny.
369;Bruce Wayne and James Gordon and Alfred become real, sympathetic characters in our eyes.
370;With an excellent cast, amazing cinematography, action, and drama, Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale craft what is perhaps the most enjoyable Batman film ever made.
371;Begins gets almost everything right, and this is a movie that deserves to be seen multiple times.
372;p. s. Check out the sequelThe Dark Knight, arguably the finest superhero film ever made.
373;This is a brilliant film that leaps for the throat and does not let go.
374;A memorable villain and excellent pacing make this the best of the bunch.
375;and the threequelThe Dark Knight Rises, a long, epic, weighty, emotionally powerful film that trades Batman onscreen for drama and characters.
376;"shocked by the stunningly bad treatment of this classic character, critically acclaimed director Christopher Nolan and comic book fan David Goyer (who wrote the ""Blade"" films) joined forces to write ""Batman Begins""."
377;Unlike the films of the previous series (event the Tim Burton films, which were excellent and are still my favorites), this one was to be faithful to the source material and show the true origins of the Dark Knight.
378;Batman Begins take you back .
379;There Bruce learns how to concquer his fears through strength and discipline.
380;With the help of Alfred and outcast Wayne Enterprises ally Lucious Fox (Morgan Freeman, again perfectly cast), he adopts a new persona, a vengeful vigilante who uses his fear of bats to strike fear into the hearts of others.
381;And that's where the fun begins.
382;He becomes allies with Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman, once again perfectly cast), one of Gotham's only good cops).
383;There's nonstop action mixed in with an incredibly well written plot that amounts to the best Batman movie in nearly 15 years.
384;all in all, this film is excellent.
385;The cast is perfect for the most part.
386;Christian Bale makes for a great Batman and Bruce Wayne.
387;He does just as good as Michael Keaton, but he also adds an edge to the role not scene before.
388;Michael Caine brings the role of Alfred to life, as does Gary Oldman with Jim Gordon.
389;I didn't mind, but it's nice to see them finally get the respect they deserve.
390;Neeson is excellent as Ducard, who wasn't actually a villian in the comics.
391;Freeman is excellent as Fox.
392;In the comics, Fox was a pretty minor character, but Freeman makes the character very accesssible and thus the character is put to good use.
393;Cillian Murphy was fantastic as The Scarecrow.
394;the extras on the second disc are great, but the menu takes a while to navigate.
395;I liked the comic book, too.
396;Definitely a must see movie.
397;Otherwise this is an excellent film for any comic book or batman fan.
398;This batman was the best Batman ever.
399;Batman and Batman Returns were easily the best two of the first four films.
400;For a long time after the release of the third (Batman Forever) and fourth (Batman and Robin) I feared for the future of what had been a great movie franchise.
401;ridden atmosphere made great in the first two films.
402;A great movie sure to promise greater sequals (I HOPE).
403;A must have for true fans.
404;Excellent origin story for Batman and Nolan did a great job directing.
405;Bale played the best Batman of any film.
406;The person who received it just loved it.
407;Great detail due to the blue ray.
408;A must see for Batman fans.
409;Vowing vengeance, Bruce travels the world, learning all that he can to become a one.
410;Sure, the trailers looked cool, dark, and edgy, but studios always put the best bits in the trailers anyway.
411;All we had were hopes and good.
412;It was about the very real contrast between revenge and justice, and making right what once went so terribly wrong.
413;it's a story about redemption, love, and fighting to protect strangers in a city where crime, filth and evil are the everyday norm.
414;katie Holmes as Bruce's childhood friend/love interest, Rachel Dawes, was a good thing.
415;Though their was romantic interest here, it was rooted in friendship, which was a nice change.
416;He did a great job as Bruce's mentor.
417;He looked the part, acted the part, and I fully sympathized with him being pretty much the only good cop in a bad town.
418;batman Begins is the quintessential bat.
419;This movie got Batman exactly right for the first time.
420;He always seems to never get any credit for his performances, and in this movie he shines.
421;The movie had a few flaws, but I still enjoyed the movie.
422;First off, the acting was excellent, the action was great, and the movie didnt have a cheese factor like the other four movies do.
423;Bale is perfect for the duality of this role, and get this, he actually looks like he could kick the crap out of you.
424;Noland and Goyer bring Miller's vision of Gotham to life wonderfully (no greasy perms or latex nipples).
425;Add it all up and suddenly Batman is cool again.
426;but I have to say, personally, while it's a visually stunning film, it does what it can for such a dark and flat film.
427;Finally, a stylish and intelligent Batman movie that I found engrossing from beginning to end.
428;Played straight by a superb cast, Christopher Nolan's smart take on the Dark Knight was beautifully rendered by all concerned.
429;A wonderful noir look to the film that did not rely on full.
430;I found every aspect of the film smart, well.
431;The dialogue worked for me, and the characters, played by this dream cast, had some depth and complexity.
432;And finally, the action was terrific.
433;This is high class, highly intelligent movie making, done with style and panache and enough substance to satisfy most of us.
434;And it is great good fun.
435;I have seen all the earlier Batman movies and I must say this is by far the greatest.
436;The older ones were ok, but lacked that realistic feel.
437;In Batman Begins I felt moved by it, it was realistic, it was dramatic, and it felt real.
438;This one has a sandish like feel.
439;The case is sturdy (unlike some video game steelbooks), the ink is done absolutely perfectly.
440;The movie and special features are great.
441;Christian Bale's performance adds great depth to the characters of Batman and Bruce Wayne.
442;Cillian Murphy has incredible presence onscreen.
443;The movie is very well directed by the talented Mr. Nolan.
444;Definitely the best Batman movie so far.
445;I am a comic book movie fan and thought they did a fantastic job depicting Batman and his darker complexities with this film.
446;Christian Bale was an excellent choice.
447;Bought it just for the film.
448;The first film had some admirable art direction and some memorable moments, but it's no more a definitive portrayal of Batman than the `60s TV series was.
449;Michael Keaton is a wonderful actor, but Batman.
450;well kids, that's where Batman Begins gets it just right.
451;"key, realistic take on the mythology is a lesson on how to reinvent a franchise
452;Finally, stick with what's important .
453;In fact Batman Begins benefits greatly from being able to craft a new take on the events leading up to Bruce putting on the cowl for the first time.
454;I've read my share of Batman comics"
455;Managing to be both familiar and utterly original at the same time.
456;"as the film progresses, something even more interesting happens
457;The film keeps deconstructing Batman"
458;This is both clever and interesting.
459;Batman Begins also benefits greatly from a wonderful cast: Liam Neesen, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Gary Oldman, and the great Michael Caine.
460;"And nobody here is just collecting a paycheck either
461;One of my favorite scenes is between little Bruce and Oldman as Jim Gordon.
462;That look, folks, is worth the price of admission alone, and it perfectly exemplifies the level of acting and drama in this film.
463;This is, bar none, the best lead performance in a comic book based film, ever (sorry Chris Reeve)!
464;Bale is smart, brooding, and deep.
465;That's right, really scary the way Batman is supposed to be.
466;And that's the way the action is handled too: things happen mostly in shadow with lightening speed.
467;This is both true to the comics and dramatically potent.
468;Batman is a night creature who uses stealth and misdirection and this film is the first to capture that on screen.
469;But these are minor qualms and every weakness is countered by consistent brilliance.
470;Kudos to Nolan, David Goyer and the cast and crew.
471;Batman Begins is the best (live action) superhero movie ever made.
472;What I got from Batman Begins was nothins short of fantastic.
473;, and the movie balances action with actual substance.
474;It opens with our hero, Bruce Wayne aka Batman, in a prison.
475;Bruce heads back to Gotham City, sure that he can be of help to the people.
476;And undoubtedly, he will be exactly the force that the city needs.
477;It's great to finally have backstory.
478;If they continue with making Batmans, which I'm sure they will, I hope they take notes while watching this one to create something equally spectacular.
479;With a new cast, a new director and a new Batman movie, things could only go up for this, at the time, crumbling franchise.
480;They all deliver great performances, and made me wonder, what has Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone done lately?What made this movie so satisfying to me was how much time Batman/Bruce Wayne's background was explained.
481;overall, this movie was very well done, and I applaud the filmmakers for daunting a hard task"
482;The strength of the movie is how it reaches into the details, and how the story is told.
483;fans of Batman in the comics, and followers of the movie series know the origin story.
484;Because all we have ever have been given was an outline .
485;All of these questions and more are answered in a satisfying way, and hopefully will inspire deeper super hero movies.
486;The difference between Batman and Superman has always been the humanity of Wayne.
487;"Ignore a few of those scenes, and you'll enjoy ""Batman Begins."
488;The acting is wonderfully perfect.
489;The special effects are seamless.
490;The scipt is pretty darn good.
491;It goes from there to a wonderful semi cliff.
492;Seeing the marvelous Bale in the Batman suit is truly a thrill.
493;This first movie of the trilogy is great.
494;Great effort was made to really explore the Batman psyche.
495;As a Dark Knight fan I loved this movie.
496;Pretty please, one hour shorter is greatly helpful.
497;"liners (e. g. ""nice coat"") blurted out by several characters of Batman Begins just for the fun of it."
498;"All in all, Rex Reed said it best, ""Batman Begins is for morons."""
499;"The movie seemed dark at first
500;Katie Holmes is particularly good in this.
501;Finally a Batman movie made with a realistic approach and the main focus is on the iconic cape crusader and not the villains.
502;I suppose there isn't much to be said about this movie that hasn't already been said, Christian Bale is a fine Bruce Wayne and Christopher Nolan directed a movie that made me care about comic book movies again.
503;Tim Burton fostered in a new era of superhero films with his impressively dark, original Batman films BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS.
504;thankfully, Christopher Nolan's 2005 rendering BATMAN BEGINS is a fine return to form for the popular dark superhero.
505;upon his return to Gotham after years of exile, Wayne resumes his place as the head of Wayne Manor, which was taken care of in his absence by family major domo Alfred (fine performance by the esteemed Michael Caine) and Wayne Industries, run by Mr. Earle (wonderfully played by veteran screen bad guy Rutger Hauer).
506;Wayne also meets Lucius Fox (reliably played by the great Morgan Freeman), the head of the Development section of Wayne Industries, and enlists his help in obtaining high.
507;tech equipment so that he can begin leading his double life as both Wayne and Batman.
508;acquaints himself with his childhood friend and now assistant DA Rachel Dawes (played surprisingly well by Katie Holmes).
509;Batman also meets Police Sgt. Jim Gordon (superb work by Gary Oldman), who initially skeptical, ends up being the conduit between Batman and the police force.
510;I've not seen all his work, but I've got to believe this is perhaps one of the best (if not the best!)
511;Additionally, Nolan does a good job of CGI.
512;ing effects to make a real city an authentic stand.
513;it held very close to the theme of the books and kept true to the dark nature, i believe was best intended for this character.
514;i cant wait for the next one with heath ledger as the joker, this is going to be exceptional!
515;This movie made me a Christian Bale fan.
516;He is a fantastic actor and will someday be recognized as great.
517;The special effects are super and the story shows how a person of wealth can be socially valuable.
518;That is a nice twist or departure from demonizing those who were born into wealth.
519;I won off a radio station tickets to see the premire of this movie, The movie was awesome in general, I also saw the I. max version which was the 1st I. max movie I have ever seen that was not about dolphins.
520;Coming 8 long years after the debacle that was 1997's """"Batman And Robin"""", the franchise with the man in the bat costume gets a new shot at life, and what a rebirth it is."""
521;The project brings back the integrity, dignity, and all around excitement that the first film, under the director of genius Tim Burton, brought back in 1989.
522;"Director Christopher Nolan, with a script from David Goyer(known mostly as the man behind the ""Blade"" movies), brings the dark moodniess back to the dark knight, and makes it darker than anyone has seen on film yet."
523;I liked Michael Gough, but Michael Caine just takes the role of Alfred as his own and he is the best Alfred anyone has seen.
524;He is funny and warm, and the relationship with him and Bruce is fantastic.
525;The movie also boasts one great actor after another popping up.
526;Cillian Murphy as Dr. crane/Scarecrow is just fine, but there seemed to be less screen time for him to really have a solid impression.
527;It can also be said his Scarecrow part can be pretty frightening for young kids.
528;As with most Batman films, it's pretty dark.
529;While the movie is much more serious and darker, it does have a nice dose of humor to lighten things up a bit.
530;The movie does a great job of explaining the origins of the character and just how he got to be who he is today.
531;The movie may have the images and cool fights and all that, but this one is much more a character piece than any that has come before.
532;The look of the film is magnificent.
533;It does have a distinct look to it tho.
534;The movie runs a longer than any other Bat film, and drags in some spots, but the end result is incredibly satisfying and entertaining.
535;The way they structured it is perfect.
536;"man"", although I loved both films."
537;Batman Begins is a brilliant, dazzling, and influential film, and will no doubt raise the bar for future superhero movies.
538;It's the best movie I have seen in a while.
539;"Let's hope next summer's ""Superman Returns"" will be just as worthy as this one."
540;"When Batman first attempts one of his stunts in the truly remarkable Batman Begins, the thought flashed across my mind ""He's going to hurt himself."""
541;That's the level of immersion into the world of Bruce Wayne that this film is capable of.
542;sometimes titles really do indicate the subject matter of works, and this is one of those occasions.
543;This is the story of how Bruce Wayne forges himself into Batman and it is a powerful story, even for people far beyond the normal gravitional pull of the world of comics.
544;And, a great number of such questions may occur to us after the end of this film, but I suggest that very few indeed will occur while we watch it.
545;i must also note that this is a scary movie.
546;I don't want to give more than that away, but it is a scary movie, in part because of the effective special effects and in part because it is so good at making its characters real, so that we truly feel their pain.
547;note about casting: The film is also exceptionally well cast, not only in the main roles, but in such minor parts as Bruce Wayne's father.
548;a note about the direction: Sure, it's a far more conventional story than Memento and some Nolan fans may be bitterly disappointed for that reason, but if this is the conventional, it is the perfect execution of the conventional and that is really good enough.
549;I hope you watch this movie, it really is good.
550;At last, a movie worth watching, worth discussing and worth writing about.
551;The beauty of this one is that the focus is on Batman and not what the Riddler is doing or what prank the Joker is playing or what surprise the Penguin has in store.
552;this movie is Batman all the way.
553;The carefully selected Christian Bale is a wonderful choice for the Lead role the best Batman since Michael Keaton, he does justice to the role.
554;the entire movie was good actually it was great except for a few minor things.
555;on IMAX it is very evident .
556;"as for the cast
557;Caine is remarkable as Alfred, Neeson was outstanding in another one of his """"mentor"""" roles ."""
558;Freeman is breathtaking as Fox, he doesn't have to say much, yet he owns the screen.
559;"Gary Oldman created a whole new him
560;She's got her life sorted out, she makes good movies and is dating Tom Cruise.
561;I do wish her the best though, she deserves it.
562;A great movie for fans or moviegoers alike.
563;Bale is great as Batman and is very convincing.
564;Great movie, well made, well filmed and I am sure it'll be well liked as well.
565;Nolan's Batman series is exactly what the series needed.
566;I liked the more creative look at batman as Burton portrayed.
567;This movie had some good action scenes, but if Burton had today's special effects, who knows what he could have created.
568;Nolan did a good job re.
569;He stayed closer to the plot of the comic book.
570;he did a good job though!
571;Jack Nicholson will be pretty hard to top considering he's one of the greatest actors of all time.
572;Michael Caine was great as alfred and Morgan Freeman was good too.
573;This movie was good but not excellent.
574;Danny Elfman and Hanz Zimmer are both great composers though.
575;as much as I liked Michael Keaton's take on Batman, THIS is the definitive version.
576;But the brilliance in this movie is that it not only convinces you that this scenario is possible, but that if you were in Bruce Wayne's shoes and you had access to all of his resources, you would not only want to do it but HAVE to do it.)
577;It's beautifully written and acted by all.
578;This one should be the best yet!
579;The first hour is arguably the best part of the film, which chronicles Bruce Wayne's journey to becoming Batman, and his tutelage under Liam Neeson's Ra's Al Ghul.
580;Wonder what they will do with the series now that the trilogy is done.
581;the dark night looks better but this still looks amazing
582;As far as I'm concerned those original 2 and this version are the only ones worth watching.
583;Bale is the best Batman, with all due respect to Keaton.
584;I really enjoy the new Dark Knight style batman, it seems like he is more of a real person than the superman like other superheroes, this is one of my favorite movies so I had to have it for my kindle
585;batman Begins is the best reboot of a comic book franchise turned movie to date.
586;This Film is not only one of the best examples of a comic book character coming to the big screen, but it also is an amazing example of what blu ray can do.
587;ray discs I have seen.
588;A great film with great acting and the most beautiful transfer I have ever seen from the big screen.
589;I do believe that out of all of the Batman movies this is my favorite.
590;It definitely sets a good foundation for the numerous sequels.
591;Christian Bale gave an outstanding performance as Batman.
592;I highly recommend Batman Begins for all Batman lovers!
593;Definitely spend the extra bucks for the 2 disc set This set comes with a really cool bonus disc and a great digest sized comic compiled with some of the great comic book stories that inspired the writers on the film.
594;The bonus features are great, but I'd have liked some of them to be a bit longer.
595;such as the history of Batman featurette.
596;Great documentary on the pre.
597;production and stunts as well as the fight choreography.
598;Personally I'd have loved a commentary with the cast and writers.
599;as for the film: this is most certainly a film about Batman.
600;Who he is, how he came to be, and why he believes what he believes.
601;I loved how the relationship between Gordon and Batman grows over the course of the film and the explanation given for their friendship/partnership is pitch perfect.
602;A very important character to the comic book universe is introduced (Lucius Fox) and Alfred is given new life and a more sardonic sense of humor by actor Michael Caine.
603;And hopefully that sequel will be made with the same talented cast and crew.
604;I'd love to see a true Batman onscreen trilogy.
605;It would be wonderful to see Batman start out at one place and have him end in another over the course of 3 films with the same actors in key roles.
606;I think the Batman character deserves to be handled with respect and a truly definitive cinematic saga shouldn't be too much for fanboys to hope for.
607;If such a saga is to come, then this film is the perfect place for it to begin.
608;And whoever I bought this from did a good job, super quick shipping.
609;It is exciting and intense and boasts terrific characterization and themes.
610;Arguably the best thing about the movie is simply the style with which it is approached.
611;The movie examines the character of Batman and sort of asks the question: What would it take to be Batman?
612;The film is visually impressive as well, including some very nice scenery and interesting contrast.
613;The action is also exciting, but it emphasizes adrenaline and movement over what actually happens (my dad complained heavily about that).
614;despite this shortcoming, the movie is extremely entertaining and is easily the best Batman movie yet.
615;I hope for more in the style of this one.
616;After viewing Bale's shockingly realistic performance in the machinist, I was certain that he would be an inspired choice to play the dark knight.
617;They perform an excellent job of enhancing the character of Batman, rather than outshine him like the previous films.
618;but what struck me most was when Bale puts on the costume, he fits in seamlessly, both figuratively and literally.
619;There is a bright future for the Batman franchise if all sequels can be done in this manner.
620;Stay true to the comic book, keep Christopher Nolan as director, and keep Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman.
621;Michael Caine as Alfred is a nice touch too.
622;Thanks for a terrific gift idea.
623;It looked pretty cool but I will have to wait and see if it is really good.
624;Some people did not like the last 2 movies in the series but I have enjoyed them all myself.
625;But for Now the 5 stars are for the first 4 movies.
626;It's rare you find such a treat in the theatres these days.
627;Heath Ledger, rest his soul, was truly at the top of his game and all the choices were excellent actors.
628;in any case, the movie is worth owning just for Ledger's performance!
629;This movie showed some great things.
630;Christian Bale is most likely the best batman to date (Keaton a close second).
631;It is one of the best action movies of all time in my opinion.
632;I would really incourage you to see this great movie.
633;But it does have pretty good story and I love the way the guy with the mask is such a non.
634;Batman Begins is one of the best super.
635;I just want to see a good movie.
636;Batman Begins was a summer blockbuster in 2005 and it actually tried to do something none of the other summer blockbusters ever do.
637;The first part of the movie works in part because of the great cast.
638;Christian Bale as Wayne is incredible.
639;equally enjoying is the transformation of Wayne into Batman.
640;It is portrayed as realistic as it can considering it is a superhero movie.
641;There, he finds all the tools he'll need as Batman, including an incredible Bat.
642;If so, you must watch this movie.
643;The acting is great, the story is crisp, the action and characters are gritty and real.
644;Jack Nicholson was brilliant as the Joker, but I'm one of those people who thought Michael Keaton was woefully miscast.
645;now, this is Batman as it should be.
646;I'm not completely certain that Christian Bale is the ultimate Caped Crusader, but he is a terrific actor.
647;And he certainly got the most to work with: the best dramatic story, and the most complex characterization of Batman/Bruce Wayne.
648;One of my absolute favorite actors in the world, Morgan Freeman.
649;And the brilliant Michael Caine, who gives amazing depth to the role of Alfred.
650;The way they interpreted Scarecrow is particularly interesting and actually frightening.
651;It's hard to make this type of material so intense, but they did it.
652;This is a pretty good movie.
653;Nice formative story to explain the history of Batman in this version of the universe.
654;action film to take on the comic book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth.
655;Concieved in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's orginal comic book owes itspower and pleasures to Christopher Nolan, a director who takes his material seriously, and to Christian Bale, a star who shoulders that seriousness with ease.
656;What Nolan understands better than any other previous director that without Bruce Wayne, Batman is just a rich wacko with illusions of grandeur and a terrific pair of support hose.
657;It's amazing what an excellent cast, a solid screenplay, and a regard for the source material can do for a comic book movie.
658;watching several times, it is my favorite of the three.
659;After the success of Tim Burton's """"Batman"""" (1989), """"Batman Returns"""", and the box."""
660;stop action, and AMAZING special effects highlight this spectacular epic flick!Without a doubt, this is THE best 'Batman' movie of all time and its predecessors do not stand a chance!
661;(With the exception of the first two movies) I'm very glad to see a more appropriate and faithful adaptation to the original Bob Kane comic[s] because this is the way it was all meant to be from the beginning!
662;Finally, this is the #1 blockbuster smash hit of the summer and it's great to see a revival to everyone's favorite DC comic[s] superhero!
663;I HIGHLY recommend this flick to any and all Batman fans and even those who are new to it!
664;I'm not a Batman fan but I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I ever would.
665;The movie has a good story and it fleshed out the main character better than I anticipated.
666;I also like how they didn't use popular villains and still had an excellent story.
667;This moody and thrilling film is something that I'd recommend to both fans of the comics and newcomers alike.
668;disc Widescreen Edition)as the two best movies I've seen in five years.
669;One of the best batman's ever!
670;It was fun and suspenseful.
671;the anniversary edition was offered at one point on a $15 special through Amazon The extras are nice, but the movie is great, the PQ/AQ I thought was better than what the AVS blu.
672;ray tier forum had rated it.
673;One extra: footage of the beginning of the Dark Knight was a nice addition.
674;if you grew up with the Batman comic books, you're in for a double.
675;And even if you've never read a DC comic book, you're still in for a very pleasant movie experience.
676;But he's just about as perfect a Batman I've ever seen.
677;But what Mr. Bale DOES have is a really great persona that accompanies the dark.
678;"style films he chooses (please see ""Reign of Fire"" if you haven't already)."
679;In this film, we get to see a bit of both of these sides.
680;also notable is the all.
681;star cast that graces the silver screen.
682;Liam Neeson gives a fine performance as both Batman's mentor and nearly his demise into darkness.
683;director Christopher Nolan (Momento) pulls off the best Batman movie EVER.
684;And the amazing thing is that it's not JUST for Batman and comic book fans.
685;Several of my friends and co. workers who've never touched a DC comic have seen the film and are singing its praises.
686;go see it on the big screen.
687;(Also, make sure you watch for and enjoy the earliest version of the Batmobile.)
688;As a fan of Frank Miller's Batman: Year One, this film has been the most rewarding installment that's truest to the source material.
689;I liked Tim Burton's films, disliked Schumacher's light hearted direction, but loved that Nolan did what was missing from all the previous films that made this film so special, and that was Batman's origin story.
690;I recommend this to anyone looking for a good story that's entertaining enough to leave you wanting more whether your a bat fan or not.
691;I look forward to future Batman films with Nolan as director and Bale as the caped crusader for they have proven that they take the character seriously.
692;sTAR films from the 1989 original, to the 2008's Dark Knight film.
693;He is the greatest, biggest, strongest, coolest, bravest, most electrifying superhero in the whole wide world!
694;I proudly rate all of his films 5.
695;Christian Bale is the perfect actor for Batman, and Multi.
696;Christian Bale is the Greatest, Biggest, and collest!!!!!
697;"dark, stylish, well acted and directed, ""Batman Begins"" should prove pleasing to both the die hard Batman fans, as well as just the regular movie."
698;"During this process he decides that in order to save the city, he must do so undiscovered
699;Batman Begins is edgy and well polished, with some nice fleshed out character development and some great acting.
700;bale does a great (if not the best) job as """"The Dark Knight"""" and Caine proves himself to be a most worthy and caring Alfred."""
701;The actions scenes are pretty awesome as well, as is the look of Gotham city.
702;The film leaves us with the possibility of a sequel as well, including the mention of one of Batman's most notorious villains.
703;Just a great superhero film all the way around.
704;The excitement throughout is incredible as you know what this is building up to, but the ride beforehand is fabulous.
705;From the comic book historical reference though, it fit quite well.
706;If you favor the Batman comics and the stories that accompany them, this is your film!
707;One of the best comic.
708;Christian Bale has received major accolades for making Batman and Bruce three dimensional, but I was only partly behind his portrayal the entire way .
709;In the modern series, this certainly is the most intellectually rich Batman, but the whole story of the Batman has been retold in variations and adventures for years and years, on and on.
710;well finally Christian Bale, working with an excellent script brings us the darkside of Batman and what makes him tick.
711;the special effects are grade A. the story is awesome.
712;batman Begins offers you all the great stuff you crave in superhero movies.You know how you look at the heroes' weapons in movies and you would like to see more.
713;well Batman Begins gives you plenty of information and looks at his weapons and the Bat suit itself.
714;batmans enemies are great , he has alot of enemies one including his co. owner of Wayne Enterprises.
715;this Batman movie is the best ever.
716;to be honest it's the best movie I seen in 2005.
717;i seen this movie twice already and it was good for the second time too.
718;go to the theaters and see this movie.
719;pick Batman Begins over Star Wars and Mr. Mrs. Smith , I promise you , you won't be disappointed.
720;only smart ones that make good stories like Chis Nolan the director.
721;he should win some kind of award for putting Batman back on the map and capturing the true like and story of the Dark Knight .
722;Sit back with your favorite drink and popcorn.
723;This film has a great build up and a great explanation of things.
724;still all in all, this is a great picture .
725;A great conclusion to a great series.
726;If you enjoyed the first two films in the series, this a must.
727;This is the best comic book hero origin story ever created.
728;It is true to Batman's roots in film noir.
729;It actually had a very interesting plot, some mystery, and a neat twist.
730;Being Batman, it also had awesome fight scenes.
731;this movie really captures the essence of the Dark Knight.
732;The movie is dark and paints a vivid picture of the real Gotham City.
733;The movie really explores his inner demons and his moral dillemas.
734;this is a must see, even if you are not a fan of the series.
735;It was ten times better than Spiderman 2, which I had thought of as the best hero movie prior to this.
736;It has superb acting and the plot is just great.
737;Christian Bale is perfect as Batman and Michael Cane is great as Alfred.
738;He is obsessed with batman.
739;It's was great price and the movie shipped quickly.
740;This is the beginning of a beautiful franchise.
741;Christian Bale is the first truly scary Batman.
742;All of the actors are excellent, the story was exciting, the villians didn't overtake the movie.
743;probably the best summer movie this year.
744;Better than redbox or video store.
745;Ladies and gentlemen, it's a good time to be a comic book nerd.
746;with the recent renaissance in good comic book films (starting with Blade in 1998 and really kicking into high gear with X. men in 2000), fans of characters like Wolverine, Peter Parker, and now the Dark Knight, have finally been able to enjoy movies that treat their source material with almost unerring respect, and yet still manage to stand alone as solid entertainment.
747;Batman Begins, directed by Memento and Insomnia's Christopher Nolan and written by comic book veteran David S. Goyer, is the best thing to happen to the character since Bruce W. Timm's animated re.
748;imagining of Batman more than a decade ago.
749;Economic depression has created street thugs of honest men and women, and the crime syndicates flourish while the powerful are too scared or too bribed to do anything.
750;The story is a very well.
751;drawn tale that touches on Batman's complex but idealistic morality (something Burton's films forgot when it was time for Batman to break out the chainguns and bat.
752;bombs), as well as creating credible villains.
753;"The same can be said for the music
754;however, perhaps the most impressive accolade the movie can claim is the cast.
755;Christian Bale completely inhabits the dual role of Bruce Wayne/Batman with a feral strength and darkly ironic sensibility that never quite made it to the character in the previous live.
756;However, even more enjoyable is the supporting cast"
757;Micheal Caine's Alfred is fraternal and likable enough for two roles, and Cillian Murphy's turn as Dr. Cane/The Scarecrow is so enjoyable that it's almost depressing that he is now unable to play the Joker in any future films.
758;the film is a pure delight for comic book fans, and does a fantastic job of obtaining its own identity as a very good hi.
759;It works the first time we see the Dark Knight in action, as we see from the criminal point of view, and it's mean to be disorientating and frightening.
760;"however, these are small complaints in an otherwise astonishingly good and refreshingly serious take on the genre
761;disk deluxe edition) is a fine investment, not only containing the film with an excellent video and audio transfer, but an entire second disk of bonus features on everything from the secrets of the special effects (you'll be surprised what was real and what was computer generated) to the genesis of the redesigned Batmobile (and some cute comic book easter eggs to boot).
762;but it has the origin.
763;It is Batman Begins after all.
764;I would recommend the entire trilogy for Batman fans.
765;I'm a big Batman fan and the Dark Knight Trilogy.
766;I really appreciate how Christopher Nolan works in so many of the important elements of who Bruce Wayne, Batman, and related characters are and how they came to be.
767;Me: 1, Rest of the World: 0I am a huge fan of the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy.
768;I enjoyed all three films immensely, but this was my favorite.
769;There are certainly things that I liked better aboutThe Dark Knight (Two.
770;Both of The Dark Knight films had more interesting villains.
771;That is extremely rare for me.
772;the movie, of course, charts the rise of Batman.
773;It has been said many times already, by many other people, but I think it is an important point so I will say it again, what separates this movie from most super hero movies, as well as all the Batman movies made before Nolan's trilogy, is that Christopher Nolan has attempted to create a realistic world, as opposed to a cartoonish world, and he has succeeded brilliantly.
774;It is amazing to me that so few super hero movies are able to achieve this degree of realism (most do not even try).
775;It is always necessary in any super hero movie (or any other movie actually) to suspend disbelief to some degree, but this movie gets about as close as possible to a genuinely realistic super hero movie.
776;the acting is superb throughout, and there is a whole host of supporting characters that each add their particular flavor to the whole movie.
777;This is one of Christopher Nolan's genuine talents it seems to me.
778;All of these Batman movies are filled with genuinely interesting, well drawn, and superbly acted, supporting characters.
779;I said that the two Dark Knight movies had better villains, but the villains in this movie are actually very well played, and interesting.
780;I also think Katie Holmes did a very good job as Rachel Dawes.
781;All of the pieces of the jigsaw really came together on this one.
782;it is easy to look down on super hero movies.
783;human desires for perfect justice, or our desire to feel empowered in the face of things that we feel powerless about, but this movie has some substance.
784;This is a genuine insight into the way the world works.
785;the movie also has somewhat of a social conscience in the form of Rachel Dawes and Bruce Wayne's father, as well as Bruce Wayne himself.
786;Batman represents a more subtle, and more complex, moral standpoint since he believes in reforming conditions as opposed to simply getting the """"bad guys""""."""
787;those are just a few of the reasons this is one of my all time favorite movies.
788;The '05 Warner Bros. release 'Batman Begins' is an excellent addition to the previous four Batman flims and not only extends the Batman mythos into the 21st century but also provides us with an in.
789;depth look into the early years of Bruce Wayne's physical and psychological formation.
790;Now we can finally comprehend the life altering experiences and intense training required to become the fearless Caped Crusader.
791;christian Bale stars as a deeply driven, complusive.
792;I'm not a fan of comic books or comic book movies and was surprised how much I enjoyed this fantasy adventure
793;This was my favorite movie of 2005.
794;This movie brought the series back to earth a little.
795;Aside from being a great comic book movie, it's just a great movie.
796;It's also nice that the relationship between the two is downplayed.
797;There is still something between them but it is a more realistic complex connection.
798;The don't ask, don't tell nature of Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox's relationship is refreshing in a genre of movies that usually rquire the hero's identity remain a secret from everyone around him.
799;It's interesting to see where the Batmobile comes from rather than it is just there.
800;the best trick Chris Nolan pulled off was keeping it interesting even when Batman wasn't on screen.
801;I thought the balance was well done and the story was about Bruce Wayne as well as Batman.
802;Part of the credit goes to the actors.
803;And Michael Caine as Alfred is a fresh take on the thin old bald butler of the past.
804;everything about Batman Begins was fresh and original to this type of movie.
805;It was closer to the comics.
806;write everything like any other movie.
807;Like The X. men and Spiderman this movie really gets into the heros legend and makes good use of the history to tell an interesting story.
808;I think it's the best comic book movie to date.
809;Batman Begins is a superb movie on so many levels.
810;It is a realistic action movie, one with a compelling and realistic storyline, that incorporates the comic book movie into a full fledged movie for everyone, leaving out the cheesy unrealistic characters.
811;The acting as well was very believable, with the characters not being overdone or getting into emotions and interactions that are out of place.
812;Not so in this movie as it enhanced the theatrical effects much more, making the movie that much more enthralling.
813;A must see for everyone, even if you aren't typically entertained by comic book movies.
814;An action movie with a compelling storyline that draws you in, that is what you will get.
815;cue cards, add a dash of Morgan Freeman, a cup of Katie Holmes, an exceptionally English Michael Caine, Liam Neeson as an uncommonly convincing villain, and Christian Bale as the most believable Batman ever and you have the perfect recipe for the redemption of what Batman always should have been!What makes any movie great and worth watching is story .
816;I loved this movie so much.
817;It balanced the action and the drama perfectly and was a very mature film.
818;The acting all round was excellent.
819;Christian Bale was great as Batman.
820;But I was most surprised with Katie Holmes.
821;She really held her own standing among these great male actors.
822;Overall BATMAN BEGINS is the best of the five Batman films.
823;Batman Begins portrays and fleshes out the story of Gotham City's Dark Knight in the meticulous manner this character has always deserved.
824;Christopher Nolan, as well as everybody else who gave of their time and dedication, deserves a well.
825;This is as fantastically serious and emotionally gripping of a Batman film as you are ever likely to find.
826;It's a role he was clearly born to play.
827;"This film also boasts the impressive talents of Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Rutger Hauer, AND Cillian Murphy
828;this captured everything, the entire all.
829;important essence of what watching these types of movies is all about.
830;I've been watching these movies from the day I was eighteen years old and I can testify, with all clarity, that I have never been so totally wowed by any one vehicle in my entire life!
831;The movie is amazing and worth the price.
832;This is one of the best movies of 2005.
833;Disc 1 is the movie, the 2005 MTV movie awards intro spoof and a trailer.
834;Batman Begins is the best film yet about Bob Kane's Caped Crusader.
835;This movie does a excellent job of explaining how Batman came to be.
836;Not as good as the Dark Knight but is very good.
837;This Could Be The Best Batman Movie Next to the original.
838;best Batman Directors from best to worst:1.
839;joel SchmacherThis is one of the best so go see it.
840;This is THE definitive comic book movie of all time.
841;It stays true to the source material, and as true to reality as possible.
842;Michael Keaton looked cool enough.
843;THis is not only the greatest comic book film of all time, but it deserves a place within the top 100 films of all time for it's cinematography, script, direction, and performances.
844;and still a damn enjoyable movie for people that would say, """"Bat."""
845;I am a senior citizen and remember the first days of Batman, as well as many of the other super heroes.
846;The stories have always entertained me greatly.
847;It's not how the original went, but it was certainly fascinating.
848;I enjoyed the drama and showmanship put into this production.
849;i mean really this batman(which is the best)is how he really is.
850;Finally, another Batman movie that DOESN'T suck!
851;"The last good one was ""Batman Returns""."
852;But this one is very good.
853;hopefully it'll be another good one and not something lame.
854;Loved this movie since the first time I saw it in the theater.
855;Very glad it's finally on Blu.
856;Crisp, clean picture and explosive sound, and some great extras, too!
857;Fair acting, fair special effects, not too great over all.
858;streaming it over Amazon Prime Video was great.
859;My wife had never seen it and we all enjoyed it but not as good as the last one.
860;The original release of Batman Begins had absolutely no special features, but this Special Edition has a ton of interesting and entertaining documentaries.
861;It almost doubles the amount of time you can spend enjoying Christopher Nolan's masterpiece.
862;8 Years after the abortion of Batman and Robin, Christopher Nolan decided that he must bring back the dignity of Batman.
863;He did all that, and more with the help of some of one of the best movie actors today.
864;Ducard approaches Bruce with an offer to teach him how to fight and to overcome his fears.
865;the Characters:Bruce Wayne: Played by Christian Bale, I think most Bale fans will agree that this is one of his best roles.
866;He not only plays the tortured soul of Bruce Wayne brilliantly, but he also plays the Batman incredibly well.
867;At 53 years of age the man is in great shape and if he didn't use a stuntman for most of the fight scenes, then I applaud him.
868;The character is the one that creates Batman and it actually becomes quite ironic as Ducard turns on Wayne at the start.
869;Nolan set out to give us a Batman re.
870;I, simply loved the entire thing.
871;The film kept its pace throughout, it told the story of Bruce Wayne in detail and made us understand the torment the man was going through.
872;It was truly a triumph for Nolan and was something that has now lead up to the record breaking The Dark Knight.
873;I saw this movie 3 times in the theater this past summer and loved every second of it!
874;Christopher Nolan did an awesome job at creating an actual story for the Dark Knight!
875;It's a great movie, and if you're a big fan of Batman you will love this movie!!!!
876;I have seen them all and I like this new way of looking at how Batman could have started out.
877;The support cast which includes Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Rutger Hauer, and Gary Oldman is excellent.
878;They fill there parts very well.
879;His journey to distant lands as a young man looking for answers to his doubts about himself is a nice touch.
880;The training in marshal arts fits in with his journey to the East.
881;Good acting, camera work, scenery, special effects, and music make this well worth your time.
882;it's a more realistic film with plenty of action and adventure.
883;the characters are stronger here than in the earlier films.
884;great film if you like Batman.
885;the bonus features on the second disk were informative and enjoyable with several mini.
886;documentaries about set and costume design, action sequences, and a very nice segment about the comic writers and artists that were the most inspirational for this film.
887;the bonus comic is also a nice addition to the package.
888;After watching this, I was seriously impressed, I absolutely loved the dark knight and this movie was the one that started it all, though like a good sequel the dark knight is better in my opinion but if your a batman, DC comic fan or just like great movies in general I definately reccommend viewing this movie!!!
889;As if Tim Burton invented Batman and his version is the one to respect.
890;It is the beginning of a whole new telling of the story.
891;This is the best batman movie.
892;I saw this the day it came out and I was amazed on how good it was.
893;I was very impressed by this movie.
894;It is a true action movie.
895;This makes him so much more respectable and honorable.
896;Christian Bale was perfectly cast for this part.
897;I thought he did a great job and I think this helps to put those other Batman movies out of memory.
898;This is arguably the best Batman movie and Christian Bale gets my vote for being the best actor to play the titular character.
899;the question for any filmmaker is always there, how can you make a comic book hero believable on screen?
900;It makes one wonder how previous film incarnations did it all wrong.
901;But the real triumph of this film, like Revenge of the Sith recently, is that Batman's pieces finally fit together and the puzzle of the Dark Knight is completed.
902;"He ""finds himself"" with that purpose and goes through a series of motions that leads him to become Batman."
903;Yes, all these questions are answered, including the most important one.
904;factly, but this film chooses not only to make it believable, but carry actual depth.
905;one of my greatest admirations with this film is how everything is designed.
906;Howard is best known for his scores for M. Night Shyamalan's films.
907;He is quickly becoming one of the top thespians in my book.
908;Liam Neeson once again brandishes a sword and is powerful as Henri Ducard.
909;There is always something odd in his demeanor in the film.
910;And when he shows himself as Scarecrow, he is effectively scary.
911;Batman Begins is the film that should have started it all.
912;we see here a Bruce Wayne with fear .
913;"with an important cast that delivered exceptional performances
914;It's a great beginning to a franchise.
915;The first in this trilogy is one of the best so far in the Batman films.
916;I was pleased with the way everything was handled.
917;This movie goes into great detail on the origin on one the greatest superheroes of all time.
918;, and How did Batman become skillful in the Martial Arts and Combat.
919;Batman Begins will tell anyone the adventure that started it all.
920;This is a great beginning to a fabulous series.
921;I would highly recommend you watch it.
922;Def liked the way they kept it pretty close to the comics yet added modern twists to it.
923;lolBest Batman film next to The Dark Knight.
924;I give this one 9/10 and looks great in high.
925;I enjoyed every moment of this movie.
926;The man behind the Bat was an excellent choice and having Chicago as Gotham City was a plus.
927;ray movie on the night before Dark Knight opened.
928;While I enjoy the Batman films (and prefer the Michael Keaton ones to the sequels), Christian Bale and this version is refreshing in its focus on the man.
929;The last few scenes make this film an appropriate prequel.
930;It's getting difficult to find good films nowadays and I can say that Batman Begins is an unpolished gem.
931;It's all right to keep Tim Burton's films for good artistic expression and value, but if you want to look at a more character driven piece, then this is it.
932;Recieving the """"Superman"""" treatment, this film has a delightful cast (Holmes being the only exception) that gives rousing performances all around."""
933;The blend of action and humor is there.
934;In addition, the story is well rounded and interesting, leaving everyone to wonder about the upcoming sequel.
935;A comic fan boy, a Batman fan boy.
936;The movie is, simply put, perfect.
937;Well, the heart of every film is its story/plot, so I'll start there.
938;But still, what impressed me the most about the Begins script months ago, once again impressed me on the screen.
939;In both scope and depth of plot.
940;I never go into a lot of plot detail in my reviews, but suffice it to say there are plenty of twists, turns, emotional impacts that will keep your eyes locked to the screen.
941;Including an end scene which may not just be one of the most iconic scenes ever, but also drops a big hint of the great things to come in Batman's adventures and, hopefully, in Begins' sequel.
942;the thing that impressed me the most about the film was the acting.
943;Probably the best cast and performance since the Lord of the Rings.
944;And not only is everyone excellent, they each give breath life into their character, and give it a. personality all its own.
945;Liam Neeson as Ducard plays the perfect mentor role, just as he has done repeatedly during his career.
946;"Michael Caine proves himself to be the best Alfred ever
947;Morgan Freeman is almost endearing as the film's """"Q"""" character"
948;Gary Oldman simply is Jim Gordon, quickly become an almost impromptu sidekick of Batman's, and does so in a way that's both fun (sometimes even funny) and smart.
949;He's marvelously creepy, and simply devours his dialog and spits it back out with a fervor and passion you don't often see.
950;I'll definitely be paying close attention to Murphy's burgeoning career, as he may indeed turn out to be something quite special in the acting world in years to come.
951;These are professionals, and they display their expertise in every scene.
952;caliber acting, there is Christian Bale.
953;He gives, without a doubt in my mind, the best portrayal of a superhero ever.
954;Even surpassing the late, great Christopher Reeve.
955;Bale's Wayne is really a four dimensional character, which each one done to perfection.
956;A person you truly feel sympathy for.
957;"of course, the ""real"" Bruce, he must create an outward, playboy persona to deter any."
958;suspicions, and, unsurprisingly, Bale does this perfectly as well.
959;The performance is almost funny, without ever being campy or overly silly.
960;as for Katie Holmes, an actress I have little love for, she actually does quite well herself.
961;Her performance is definitely the weakest of any of the main characters, but it's by no means bad.
962;"esque shots of Gotham City, there is one consistent
963;Nolan's cinematographer certainly adapted his styled perfectly to fit the world of """"Batman Begins,"""" making the film seem both epic and claustrophobic, when needed."""
964;There's nothing I love more than a beautifully shot film, and Batman definitely pleased me in this area.
965;"While ""Begins"" isn't quite the best shot film I've ever seen (that mantle goes to LOTR), it's definitely one of the best, and anyone like me who takes enjoyment out of that area of film should be quite pleased."
966;A completely score was needed, and composers did an wonderful job of reinventing Batman's themes.
967;And for just the right reasons.
968;"created environment, Nolan went back to basics, and had nearly all of the effects done the old fashioned way
969;that brings me to my next points"
970;As for the Batmobile chase, it is as high.
971;caliber as everything else in the film.
972;noticeably brilliant as some of his other films, but it is still very strong, and still better than most directors in Hollywood.
973;The film is edited quite well, and judging from the acting performances of the film, his direction to his actors must have been suburb as well.
974;He's definitely turned out, at least, his second best film in Batman Begins.
975;"Every film's got at least one, and Begins has its own
976;Let's point out numerous flaws/stupid stuff in the movie:1.
977;Batman is a pansy in this movie.
978;All shake and tremble to FIRE EYES!
979;The movie is also """"realistic"""" because Nolan can't but IMAGINATION and FANTASY into a FANTASY character."""
980;But then again, this is genius film making!
981;Best Screenplay/Director/Picture award coming this way!
982;John Crane is a teacher!
983;If anything, Burton's version is closer, even Bob Kane has admitted that's how he always invisioned Batman.9.
984;the good things about the film:.
985;It contains a lot of action.
986;I heard from others that it was, so I saw it once and became hooked.
987;I have to say that I believe this film is far superior to the previous films including the Tim Burton films.
988;The production design was breathtaking.
989;I loved how Gotham is a huge metropolis( kind of a mix between New York and Chicago.
990;Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard did a fantastic job potraying the emotion of the film.
991;i enjoyed the fact that the filmmakers decided to make everything in Batman's arsenal plausibe, and everything serves a purpose.
992;I suspect we will definetely see Michael Caine and Gary Oldman again.
993;the actors all hit their marks right on the money.
994;I really enjoyed this movie.
995;I recently acquired the other two Batman movies so I was able to watch all three in succession.
996;It is an instant classic with up to date special effects.
997;This trailer has a very shrpness and excellent visual side.
998;It can be argued the Tim Burton's artistic direction of Batman and Batman Returns could never be duplicated.
999;But the good news is director Christopher Nolan does not try to remake any past incarnation of the Batman character, he creates anew.
1000;Being the director of films imbued with dark characters (Following, Momento, Insomnia) Nolan is the perfect choice to take on the Dark Knight.
1001;And for those who didn't know the name Christian Bale before his turn here as the young Bruce Wayne/Batman, will certainly be taking notice now.
1002;Batman Begins is truly a new start for the Batman franchise.
1003;This is a GREAT one.
1004;As far as I'm concerned, Christian Bale is the best batman of all the actors that have played him.
1005;And when I finally got to see the film, I remember sitting back in my seat, enjoying the moment.
1006;the moment when I finally got to see my favorite comic.
1007;so after several viewings, I talked about how much I enjoyed it and thought it was great.
1008;"While I did enjoy the ""moment"", I didn't necessarily enjoy the film."
1009;This time, the filmakers wanted to make a good movie, not just a blockbuster event.
1010;Director Chris Nolan and co. screenwriter David Goyer wanted to make a Batman film with a real story.
1011;conquering it and, when necessary, dispensing it.
1012;"These two characters and their ""League of Shadows"" organization direct Bruce Wayne in his quest, inspiring him to be ""more than just a man""."
1013;in the comics, Ra's al Ghul has been one of Batman's most powerful villains since the early 70's.
1014;I don't recall him having anything to do with Batman's origin, but it makes perfect sense in the context of the film.
1015;a credit to BATMAN BEGINS' excellent screenplay.
1016;"the screenplay also features wonderful dialogue that previous Batman scribes Sam Hamm and Akiva Goldsman could never hope to write, such as the moment when Bruce Wayne realizes that his mentors against ""evil"" have a disturbing agenda:Ra's al Ghul: ""Gotham's time has come."
1017;This is the most important function of the League of Shadows.
1018;It is one we have performed for centuries.
1019;anyway, it's at that point that Bruce Wayne comes back to Gotham City and, with help from his butler/moral compass Alfred (played with warmth and humor by the great Michael Caine), discovers the best way to strike against the criminals of Gotham is to make them good and scared.
1020;Along the way we meet several characters, good.
1021;He's an actual character from the comics, but tweaked just enough to be involved in the action.
1022;She serves the purpose of grounding Bruce back into reality.
1023;There have been some negative comments about Holmes' performance, but I think she was quite good.
1024;Gary Oldman is wonderfully weary as the one good cop left in Gotham City.
1025;BATMAN BEGINS really captures the spirit of the comics and the unlikely friendship between Batman and Gordon is one of the many reasons why.
1026;There are some genuinely chilling moments involving the Scarecrow, maybe too scary for young children.
1027;Christian Bale is ideal as both Bruce Wayne and Batman.
1028;BATMAN BEGINS is not just the best Batman movie ever, it's the best film of the summer and one of the best films of the year.
1029;This movie is intense, humorous, dark and exciting.
1030;The first time I read a Batman comic I was hooked.
1031;By far Christopher Nolan is the only one to successfully capture the true essence of Batman.
1032;in Batman Begins we see the most creative retelling of the legend of the origins of one of America's most enduring characters.
1033;This is a man in turmoil who finally finds his way, his true north so to speak.
1034;ken Wantanabe plays a very convincing Ra's A Ghul, who mentors Bruce Wayne and helps him gain the skills he will need.
1035;christian Bale's is by far the best portrayal of the caped crusader.
1036;This is the only actor who was able to give us a glimpse into the very heart and soul of Batman.
1037;We see from this portrayal that Bruce Wayne is actually the mask, and Batman is who Bruce really is.
1038;He cannot live a normal life, he has an obsession that draws him into its web, well meaning as it may be.
1039;the entire cast does a spectacular job with their roles.
1040;Cillian Murphy brings the Scarecrow to life as a diabolical yet somewhat comical villain.
1041;the visuals are well done.
1042;The action is breath taking and at the end of each action sequence you may find your heart racing and yourself struggling to catch your breath.
1043;But the movie does not depend on action alone, The plot is nicely done and weaves into a gripping tale.
1044;True Batman fans will notice some elements of the graphic novels in this story.
1045;if you are a true Batman fan, by that I mean you have followed his character over the years, you have to see this movie.
1046;Upon its return, we finally get a faithful and interesting adaptation of the Dark Knight courtesy of Christopher Nolan.
1047;unlike his predecessors, Christopher Nolan pays significant attention to the comic book source material, drawing from Frank Miller's Batman: Year One and other sources.
1048;It is not an adaptation of any one story, but the film captures the spirit of the Caped Crusader.
1049;This is the film version that fans have waited to see.
1050;the film is aided by an all.
1051;star cast that brings a great deal of depth to the people around Bruce Wayne.
1052;Christian Bale plays Bruce Wayne himself, and succeeds in showing a clear divide between who he is when he's pretending to be a billionaire playboy and who he is when he puts on the cape and cowl.
1053;Bruce Wayne is the true mask.
1054;The supporting cast also includes Michael Caine as Bruce's butler and confidante Alfred.
1055;Morgan Freeman pitches in as Lucius Fox, and Gary Oldman provides an excellent rendition of Jim Gordon.
1056;It is an excellent film that will make Batman fans smile and will even entertain those who know nothing about the Dark Knight of Gotham City.
1057;Batman Begins is a moody, gritty, wonderfully flavorful, yet muddled origin story of the Dark Knight, Batman.
1058;The fledgling relationship between Batman and Jim Gordon is effective, the loyalty between Bruce and Alfred is touching.
1059;Of particular curiosity is that Batman wants to be both a symbol of hope, but also a symbol that strikes fear into the hearts of criminals.
1060;Multiple flashback sequences present the guy as a saint, a perfect, magnanimous caring, giving, charitable billionaire.
1061;She has perhaps a single line, which has no lasting meaning.
1062;While Rachel Dawes serves as an important grounding force for Bruce Wayne, she also serves as damsel in distress, with one of the more noteworthy action set.
1063;So, four stars, in spite of myself.
1064;Love the film and the back story given for Nolan's Batman.
1065;Special features are good too.
1066;Once there the movie goes along well and is exciting.
1067;I have been seeing a lot of positive reviews for Batman Begins from critics, fans, the genral public, and people on amazon.
1068;They are all correct with their positive reviews.
1069;Batman Begins is not only the best batman film, it is also one of the best movies i have seen all year, and one of the best comic book movies ever.
1070;All of them were perfect.
1071;See, fantastic cant even compare to Batman Begins, so that shows you that these negative reviewers dont have a clue as to what their talking about.
1072;Batman Begins was so much better, and it is right up there with spiderman 2, and x. men
1073;I love the story very close to the comic book.
1074;because your father intrusted me with something that is very important for him in our world.
1075;being that the other rival comic book company is scoring well these days with its load of titles frolicking about in the movie industry since their campy tv equivalents back in the late 70's.
1076;from a secret society zealous with its concept of Justice, which reflect a lot more on what the Tarot cards' sentiments implies .
1077;san from that 80's movie classic .
1078;for one thing, casting the presense of Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson is a splendid thing and the actors played their characters well, and also there's Gary Oldman and somehow, Rutger Heuer's presence have gone to me unnoticed.
1079;It's time that I give them a fair share of my own fear.
1080;It has everything in English so it's fine and actually just funny to own.
1081;A great beginning to this series.
1082;These films are dark and very intense.
1083;Oh yeah, these films are directed by Tim Burton who seems like the person that Batman movies were meant to directed by.
1084;"These movies are the example that ""Batman Begins"" followed."
1085;In this movie Batman/Bruce Wayne returns to his dark roots.
1086;Its kind of a side show.
1087;As mentioned earlier, he has made Batman a dark super hero once again.
1088;One of the great things that he created an image of was the fear that bad guys had of Batman.
1089;Christian Bale did a great job as Batman/Bruce Wayne.
1090;He played the most intense and darkest Batman to date.
1091;This movie is so far the movie to see this summer.
1092;Definitely check this film out.
1093;i highly recommend this steelbook, it's one of my favorites!
1094;It has emotion and heart.
1095;bATMAN BEGINS takes the time to show you the man behind the mask.
1096;It's exciting watching all the things unfold.
1097;but that is what I love about it.
1098;The movie was much more interesting once Bruce Wayne began to dawn the mask and fight crime.
1099;Very good acting and well paced, this movie is the polar opposite of Batman and Robyn.
1100;virtual skeleton frame of The Machinist, puts on the most believable Batman rendition since Michael Keaton .
1101;Unlike Clooney and Kilmer, he is just as credible as both Bruce Wayne and Batman .
1102;"i won't go into the whole movie beyond the fact that I was completely impressed with the cast of characters (because of the ""star."
1103;I recommend to you, the moviegoer, to forget the Fantastic Four, screw the Spiderman, and dump the Daredevil.
1104;top screenplay from characters with quirks and powers.
1105;Go see Batman Begins, and be satisfied.
1106;That is the best version of Batman Begins.
1107;5 cards and a lenticular one, a comic version and a storyboard version of the dark night first scene, all in this box.
1108;It may not be the best batman movie, but is the movie that goes perfectly with the other 2 movies.
1109;a graphic novel on screen, quite literally.
1110;This is the perfect vision of what The Batman is designed to be: DARK.
1111;the rich playboy on the outside, and a benevolent monster on the inside, something those closest to him would ever see.
1112;very gritty, very dangerous, and made to look very real.
1113;The plot line is brilliant in that it covers several neccessary points such as how he is inspired by the bat, how he gets some of his training as well as his evading the police.
1114;Even with the Burton films, you see a well.
1115;The environment you see them working with isn't just an obvious set, it looks completely real.
1116;All in all, if you want to see a serious film on Batman, this is the one.
1117;This one is much darker and more for an adult to be able to comprehend and relate to.
1118;Finally, the Batman franchise grows up and is something to be taken seriously now.
1119;Thinking about this movie, all that I could do was backtrack to the earlier, more fun Batman installments that we have seen, starting with Batman (1989).
1120;Thinking back, I can remember how fun that film actually was to watch, so I thought that this one would offer up some of the same action packed material that the other ones did.
1121;This story does deliver what the title says, Batman Begins.
1122;which shows us exactly how the Batman character came to life.
1123;If they have a true interest in the Batman character, and I mean a true interest, then yes, this one they will appreciate.
1124;the movie is promising in its first half as Bruce Wayne trains to become the Batman.
1125;It has a gritty feel that makes one hopeful this Batman movie won't deteriorate into another flashy, empty spectacle.
1126;"The big wigs at Warner must have no confidence audiences will accept the Batman character in his original incarnation
1127;say what you will about the Sixties show, but that costume was amazing.
1128;Batman has really never been a great superhero movie franchise, but he's always been a great superhero because he has to do his stuff without superpowers, and is willed by choice more than anything else.
1129;Batman Begins is one of the best movies ever at exploring how a superhero becomse a superhero.
1130;christain Bale is the best Batman and Bruce Wayne ever on screen.
1131;Cillian Murphy is wicked as the devious Scarcrow, and Michael Kane and Liam Neason perform their respective roles of influence well.
1132;The actions scenes are terrific, and the new Batmobile is the coolest yet.
1133;the best superhero movies for me are still Superman 1 and 2 and Spiderman 2.
1134;Batman Begins is the best Batman by default that none of the others were really that good.
1135;What one has to respect about this movie is it's so widely accessable.
1136;You can know absolutely nothing about Batman, and still understand and enjoy this.
1137;It's great entertainment despite some of its weaknesses.
1138;Batman Begins is by far the best Bat.
1139;For this film to be as great as it was,was absolutely necessary.
1140;with those films,we never got a real sense of who Batman was or really why he chose to do this.
1141;And they also had a very surreal world theme to them.
1142;Batman Begins answers all the questions,has a real world feeling and fantastic performances.
1143;this is the Batman movie I have been waiting for!
1144;I enjoyed this more than I did Spiderman 2(A Great Movie!)
1145;Batman Begins finally got it right!!
1146;This is definitely not an exuberant action movie.
1147;It is a crime story, with enormous disasters affecting huge numbers of people, and I think it is significantly darker than even the first two Spider.
1148;I still remember portions of it quite vividly from that one viewing.
1149;What you watch DOES affect you.
1150;This is no doubt the best Batman flick ever!
1151;Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman does an excellent job in my opinion!
1152;Michael Cain is the best Alfred ever as well.
1153;thats why this movie is my definitive Batman movie.
1154;its a REALLY great movie!
1155;Even though there aren't any iconic villains in this movie, Scarecrow and Ras Al Ghul are fantastic to watch as the evil in Gotham City!
1156;It takes awhile for him to eventuate, but once Batman hits the screen its a gripping, near.
1157;First of all: I LOVED the movie Batman Begins.
1158;It was an amazing rebirth of the series and so much better than the last, despite the fact that I like George Clooney.
1159;So I loved the film.
1160;As my wife says, """"This is the perfect movie""""."""
1161;The plot is incredibly well thought out and complex with everything tying together perfectly!
1162;this movie was beautifully written and directed.
1163;Christian Bale makes a wonderful Batman and Bruce Wayne.
1164;Morgan Freeman also makes an apperance in this movie as Batman's source for all of his gadgets and suit.
1165;It goes without saying that Freeman was very convincing in his role as well.
1166;This was a great movie I was plesantly suprised.
1167;This is the kind of movie that I can watch over and over again.
1168;The film looks and sounds great.
1169;It's still early in the summer movie season, but so far two beloved.
1170;"there have been four previous ""Batman"" movies in the past two decades: Tim Burton's ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" were wry, stylish epics but they got hijacked by colorful villains who stole the show from the hero."
1171;"but ""serious"" is definitely the operative word for this fifth, latest and best entry."
1172;"origins are always the best parts of superhero movies (think of young Clark Kent racing trains in ""Superman,"" or Spiderman coming into his own as a webslinger) and this ""Batman"" begins with as tall as tale as a comic book fan could want:After a mugger's bullets leave billionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) an orphan, he dedicates his life to fighting crime."
1173;"nolan's gritty, realistic vibe usually works, though, and it's aided by assured turns from some of the best actors around: Bale (definitely the most anguished of the Batmen), Caine, Freeman, Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy and Gary Oldman, who can now add ""Commissioner Gordon"" to an acting resume that includes Beethoven, Sid Vicious and Lee Harvey Oswald."
1174;and though the movie's deadly serious tone prevents it from winking (which is good) it also robs it of a lot of the giddy fun of most comic book films .
1175;at least the Rambo suite was honest entertainment.
1176;This is a great movie!
1177;Also, the disc and packaging itself were in Very good condition!
1178;Christian Bale is an absolutely perfect and believable Bruce Wayne, Nolan is an amazing director, and Michael Kane owns you and your entire family.
1179;"Best superhero movie to date
1180;I'm pretty sure that will take the title of best superhero movie, but """"Batman Begins"""" will remain a close second."""
1181;This is the newest version in Steelbook and it is beautiful.
1182;You will be happy with Steelbook.
1183;One thing that's quite interesting when it comes down to the comic book heroes of old are that regardless of what's in the comic which should be the final be.
1184;Before we had 4 Batman films, 2 of which from Tim Burton, big on atmosphere and tone but not masterpieces by any means, just really well done Batman films.
1185;imagining by Christopher Nolan, director of Memento and we're better for it.
1186;So Bruce adopts his famous alter.
1187;Second, not exactly the greatest range and she's got buggy eyes and that crooked smile thing bugs me.
1188;Batman is the only hero without superpowers and the movie does a good job of showing how an average joe billionaire can become the batman.
1189;Batman Begins is a film that finally does Batman justice.
1190;If you are worried that this film is another Batman and Robin or Batman Forever don't, it's fantastic.
1191;Christian Bale makes an excellent Batman and the rest of the cast is great.
1192;This is a serious action film with an arthouse touch.
1193;The last instalment (Batman and Robin) with George Clooney as the Batman almost brought Warner Bro's million.
1194;"christopher Nolan as director and co. screenwriter, known otherwise for his ""thinking"" films (Memento) has brought his cerebral sensibilities to the project, resurrecting Batman and presenting the character in the true light he deserves."
1195;nolan approached the subject matter with the seriousness that is appropriate to Batman.
1196;what makes Batman unique compared to other superheroes is the fact he does not have super powers but trains himself to do amazing feats, Wayne's incredible will to extend himself towards excellence, in the creation of an ideal, is truly inspiring.
1197;"the film has a league of excellent actors from Morgan Freeman to Gary Oldman playing a young ""Commissioner Gordon""
1198;chris Bale as Batman soars above previous performances in the long series, making the character memorable and inspiring.
1199;one cannot write about this film without mentioning the """"Bat mobile"""""
1200;What one would give to have that car?I had high expectations for this film before walking into the theatre and found that it exceeded those expectations .
1201;It's the best Batman to date (and I mean that in a dinner.
1202;not the least of his achievements is the cast, which boasts Bale at his best, Michael Caine as a kind and dignified Alfred, Gary Oldman as pre.
1203;commissioner Gordon, and the always welcome Morgan Freeman doing a new twist on Lucius Fox.
1204;"Well, I just saw it and, whereas it is certainly the best Batman movie yet, anybody who thinks BATMAN BEGINS is even close to being the best movie of the year"" should have his/her head examined.Yes, the first half is pretty good."
1205;but, once he puts on the Batman suit.
1206;Batman Begins is such a good, involving film, it almost renders all past film incarnations obsolete!
1207;The only one worth mentioning in a positive light from now on is Tim Burton's 1989 original.
1208;but I still liked this better.
1209;I remember being pleased with the news of his casting, but his performance exceeded my expectations.
1210;He nails both the intensity and the wry humor the character should always have, and he actually looks the part of both Bruce (handsome playboy) and Batty (physically intimidating, athletic).
1211;The supporting cast here is quite impressive (They actually support without taking away from the central character.
1212;Michael Caine is actually better than the previous Alfred, which is saying a lot!
1213;Morgan Freeman is reliable as ever, as is Gary Oldman.
1214;It's dark and serious when necessary, always edgy, and adds just the right amount of quirky winking humor at just the right times.
1215;This is probably due to Christopher Nolan's more.
1216;He is a real talent and has yet to have a misstep in his short but impressive career.
1217;book sounding a la Danny Elfman, but still evokes a since of legend and excitement.
1218;overall, Batman Begins is a real summer treat!
1219;An entertaining film that rings true on just about every level.
1220;As long as they keep the essential elements of this film intact, it should be a very enjoyable ride!
1221;An intriguing setup for the next chapter, The Dark Knight, this is where you should start.
1222;Loaded with special effects as one might guess and shot very darkly to exude an intense forbodding.
1223;This brings Batman out of the craziness of Tim Burton and into as real a world as possible.
1224;A great start to a great trilogy.
1225;If you are a fan of any of the batman movies, shows or comics, it is a must own.
1226;Forget completely batmans of the past and enjoy this new beginning.
1227;Scarecrow is one of my favorite villians.
1228;This movie was well done.
1229;The violence and psychological warfare are extreme and should be considered before allowing children to view.
1230;I saw this film on Sunday, and I left the theater feeling mostly pleased with what I had witnessed.
1231;the acting was good, and the cast was perfect, I mean it has the cream of the crop of actors so that couldn't have been better.
1232;I felt robbed of what was promised to be an unparalled, unique and enriching experience of the real Batman.
1233;I'm positive that there will be an uncut, unrated director's cut with extras up the wazoo, but quite frankly I find this trend inexusable, since the theater version should be the ultimate and final version of the film, because first impressions count the most, and it's the version that the majority of viewers will be familiar with from the start.
1234;Nonetheless, it is worth seeing, and I'm glad to say that it is way better than the last two Batman incarnations, but not any greater than Tim Burton's first two films.
1235;final grade is 4/5 stars, since it is above average but nothing memorable or classic.
1236;Hollywood, good try but you can do better.
1237;It was a gift for my nephew for Christmas.
1238;It came in great shape and even included a comic book!
1239;invention, and, in the right hands, miracles do happen.yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.
1240;well, two of them, and their names are Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer, the director and writer, respectively, of Batman Begins (2005).
1241;Also appearing is Michael Caine (Miss Congeniality, Austin Powers in Goldmember), Liam Neeson (Schindler's List, Star Wars: Episode I .
1242;as the film begins we see Bale, who we later learn is Bruce Wayne, in an Asian prison camp, and he's not getting along with some of the local boys (Wayne's got the moves).
1243;bruce, determined to make a difference, creates a persona, one which will strike fear into the hearts of those who prey on the weak, and so is born.
1244;Thankfully Nolan and Goyer recognized the state of disrepair the franchise was in and smartly avoided tying themselves to that which came before.
1245;man, here we see a real understanding of the importance of aligning the film to that from which it came, the comic book (graphic novel, if you prefer), and focusing on adapting to the screen the essence of the characters, rather than trying to `fix what ain't broken'.
1246;The first half of the movie focuses on the background of Bruce Wayne, and how he finally came to donning the suit.
1247;This may seem like a good deal of time, but it worked for me in terms of fleshing out the characters, and detailing the motivations extremely well.
1248;it is true Bale doesn't don the suit until about an hour in, and a great deal of the action is in the back end, but there's enough up front to keep things moving along at a strong pace.
1249;One aspect I found particularly interesting was the involvement of the character of Alfred in the story, played by Caine.
1250;I thought Bale did really well in his role, backed up by a very strong cast.
1251;Also, I thought Oldman also did very well, bringing to life the character of Jim Gordon, the one, truly honest cop in a force besieged with corruption.
1252;i thought most everything on this film was done really well, from the sets, location shots, the overall feel, the strength of the characters, the writing, the pacing, the action, the stunt work, the gritty atmosphere, progression of the storyline, casting, effects.
1253;i really dug on that Bat Tank, especially during the exciting chase sequence with the police.you will believe a Bat Tank can fly.
1254;and we finally get to see where Batman gets those wonderful toys from.
1255;all in all I have to say Nolan and Goyer did an excellent job in bring the characters to life, and I hope the next film continues on the same track.
1256;disc deluxe edition (which is the one I got), as the Amazon website does a great job of that, but I will say there's enough here to choke a stable of horses.
1257;I enjoyed it and wish they would make one or two more with the same crew, but I understand why the staff wanted to move on.
1258;If you liked the other two you will enjoy this one.
1259;One of the best movies ever!
1260;Rest in peace Broke Back Mountain dude!
1261;Batman Begins comes as a nice surprise.
1262;the film draws a lot of visual inspiration from the actual comics and looks all the more impressive for it.
1263;The storytelling is done at a decent pace, giving each stage just enough time to have an impact before moving on.
1264;On the acting front Liam Nesson is excellent as always, Michael Cane as Alfred is brilliant as well serving as the comic relief.
1265;Christian Bale does an excellent job of re.
1266;"Just goes to show, with this and Sin City looks like Hollywood is turning a to a ""real"" look for comic book films."
1267;This is the best Batman movie since Batman Returns I can not wait for the sequel for this movie is going to be great.
1268;the main enemy (Scare Crow) isn't all to powerful,but is innovative with many tricks up his sleeve making him a much trickier opponent the nin previous Batman films.
1269;many May enjoy the fact that this shows a long indepth view of Batmans life and past in order for hi mto become such a powerhouse.
1270;the movie also has a point carried through the entire film,it's all about fear and to face it.
1271;scenes in the movie are presented in widescreen very clear and crisp.
1272;the plot is very original and this movie can apeal to a large array of people.
1273;Rumour has it that due to some rights issues with the comic book included in the set, the whole she.
1274;A great begining story to what turned out to be a great series.
1275;Christian Bale is, bar none, the best actor to ever portray Batman onscreen, and only Guy Pearce, I believe, could have come as close to being as good.
1276;Batman Begins, by director Christopher Nolan, who made the classic Memento (starring Pearce) and the good American version of Insomnia, shows that he understands what has made Batman the most popular superhero in comic book history.
1277;That said, as good a comic book film as Batman Begins is, that's all it is.
1278;This movie is really good.
1279;But then there came a hope from an unexpected source.
1280;Christopher Nolan (director ofFollowingandMemento) wanted to reinvent the character in a more realistic and epic way.
1281;He teamed up with screenwriter David S. Goyer (The Blade TrilogyandDark City) and together they wrote an exceptionally smart screenplay.
1282;This is an intellectual superhero film.
1283;Mentally and physically exhausted, he is accepted into their ranks providing that he display his devotion to justice by executing a criminal.
1284;Bruce refuses to knowingly take a life and a great battle ensues.
1285;"arguably the best ""comic book movie"" ever made, Batman Begins resurrects the Dark Knight with style and sophistication."
1286;Rarely do these kinds of films touch upon philosophical beliefs, psychological disorders or social corruption and yet this film does so with ease.
1287;Batman Begins breathes new life into the legend and is the first chapter in a thrilling new Batman saga, which will be continued in 2008's The Dark Knight.
1288;Batman Begins was a long, explosive portrayal of good vs. evil.
1289;"i appreciated the fact that ""Batman Begins"" modeled good choices."
1290;if there is to be a sequel (and the movie undoubtedly sets us up for one), I hope there are more scenes involving interactions between Batman and his butler.
1291;"The butler was the personification of wisdom and devotion
1292;In fact, on the second viewing I enjoyed this even more.
1293;christian Bale did a fine job as the latest Batman.
1294;With the success of """"The Dark Knight,"""" let's hope Bale continues with this role, so we have some continuity in this film series."""
1295;"it was nice to see Michael Caine in the role of ""Alfred."""
1296;He was excellent and the stabilizing force of the story.
1297;after having seen all the Batman films several times, I now think is the best of them all.
1298;I love the Dark Knight.
1299;The voice thing that he does as Batman it alittle odd but all in all I find it to be a very good job.
1300;The best superhero movie of all time.
1301;Being a longtime fan of the Batman comics, I have definite ideas about what a Batman movie should be.
1302;I am pleased to report that Batman Begins is pretty close to my definition of a good Batman movie .
1303;it's certainly the first incarnation of a live.
1304;This gives it a richness and depth that is vital to its believability (if such a thing is even possible for a superhero film!)
1305;I was especially pleased to see the big.
1306;There is a perfectly good D. a. in the Batman mythos (Harvey Dent), why invent a new one?
1307;Fans of the comic know that Ra's is immortal .
1308;The detective work, if well done, would be a welcome and necessary aspect of maintaining interest in the franchise.
1309;this Special Edition set is most interesting due to the inclusion of the comic book.
1310;And Christian Bale did a good job with what he'd been given, however, I've never seen a Bruce Wayne who was as clueless and stupid as the one this movie delivered.
1311;screen flame, a character played by Katie Holmes, seemed to have more common sense).
1312;don't get me wrong: it is nice to see a Batman who isn't surrounded by ice.
1313;batman Begins is a welcome return to the grim and gritty version of the Dark Knight, owing a great debt to the graphic novels that preceded it.
1314;"man 2 (though the Batmobile is cool), and retelling the origin means it starts slowly, like most ""first"" superhero movies."
1315;But it's certainly the best Bat.
1316;film since Burton's original, and one of the best superhero movies of its time.
1317;Bale cuts a good figure as Batman, intense and dangerous but with some of the lightheartedness Michael Keaton brought to the character.
1318;Michael Caine provides much of the film's humor as the family butler, Alfred, and as the love interest, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) is surprisingly believable in her first adult role.
1319;Batman Begins is sure refreshing and is entertainment at it's best.
1320;"Christopher Nolans ""Batman Begins"" is without a doubt the best Batman film ever made(so."
1321;imagined masterpiece on a level of its own.
1322;This is Batman with real substance and I for one loved every minute of it.
1323;This is the story of Batman's uprising and the criminals he encounters along the way.
1324;this is the beginning of the best version of Batman to hit the silver screen, boys and girls.
1325;This film has a lot of strengths that start with the storyline.
1326;The screenplay is also incredibly well.
1327;written as the dialogue feels natural and everything takes place in realistic fashion.
1328;"The acting is very impressive as the main cast is filled with excellent actors
1329;He makes the most of his screen time as nearly every one of his scenes is memorable in some way or another.
1330;The Henri Ducard character is a fascinating one whose enigmatic personality unravels more and more as the film progresses.
1331;Gary Oldman, who is perhaps one of the greatest actors to never win an Oscar, is just as fantastic as ever.
1332;How rare is it that the supporting cast is just as strong as the lead actors in any film?
1333;That's something Christopher Nolan is always able to accomplish.
1334;the impressive cinematography is also something to take note of.
1335;The film mostly takes full advantage of the darkness as Batman is always utilizing the shadows to fight crime, but it only makes the sudden shifts to color that much more sharp and vibrant.
1336;in the rain is so memorable thanks to how it's filmed as is every time Jonathan Crane puts on his mask and uses his fear toxin.
1337;if there is one Batman film anyone should see, this is it.
1338;It's a superhero film with a dark tone that's very well.
1339;written with nothing but incredible actors involved.
1340;This is a good enough film to stand on its own regardless of how the viewer feels about Batman going into it.
1341;It fit nicely into my collection.
1342;Hands down, this has got to be the best Batman film yet.
1343;It is pretty neat seeing how they sketch out Bruce's beginnings as Batman, how he was trained, etc.
1344;Her character adds absolutely nothing to the film and is very easily forgetable.
1345;Batman is all about secrecy and he not only has the police officer use the car, but he also very easily tells Holmes' character who he is in real life.
1346;Just don't think that was in keeping with the Batman legend.
1347;Other than that, this is just a superb movie and I highly recommend it!
1348;Even though the X. men films are solid and Sin City was spot.
1349;This movie not only honors the comic book, it also succeeds as a movie independent of the comic.
1350;Even my wife, who did NOT want to watch this movie, absolutely loved it.
1351;He absolutely nails the character.
1352;Christopher Nolan, or whoever was in charge, made sure every single person involved in the project was on the same page, and the effect is superb.
1353;I didn't learn any life lessons, but it had been a long time since I'd seen a big Hollywood movie this finely layered and nuanced.
1354;There's a palpable feeling as one watches it that all the players on the project really wanted to kick some ass, and they succeeded masterfully.
1355;Batman Begins is a great movie that shows how he became Batman.
1356;Because it has great acting, great action sequences, A great villian, And I think all the credit goes to Director Christopher Nolan who has made a Batman movie that I actually enjoy watching over and over again.
1357;instead watch this great movie.
1358;Batman Begins is a reinventing of Bob Kane's original comic book hero, and it is generally a successful transition into the 21st century with some nice wrinkles and updates.
1359;The comic book hero from D. c. Comics has captured the imagination of the public in print, television, and film.
1360;Director Christopher Nolan's vision cleverly takes threads of the original story and merges them with unique twists and turns.
1361;the wealthy Wayne family of Gotham City is well lauded, and young son, Bruce, lives an idyllic, pampered life with childhood friend Rachel.
1362;As Wayne masters his physical and mental prowess, his sense of humanity ultimately collides with the shadow group's ruthless sense of justice.
1363;As Batman commences his crime fighting, Scarecrow and ultimately a figure from Wayne's past will threaten Gotham with ultimate doom.
1364;He has a great knack for incorporating his nightmarish imagery and integrated flashbacks into a brooding, dark exploration of human paranoia, memories and fear.
1365;Nolan cleverly traumatizes young Wayne with bats which ironically will be his salvation.
1366;Comic book aficionados will revel in a faithful rendering that stays true to the original's roots and at the same time pays homage to recent updates like the critically acclaimed, Frank Miller's The Dark Knight.
1367;It is refreshing that the hero and villains are not really superhuman like Superman but rather ordinary people who are driven by a psychological bent.
1368;A fight aboard an elevated train (and earlier fight scenes) is at best standard fare.
1369;He is surrounded by an exceptional supporting cast.
1370;It is amusing in one scene to see both veteran pros like he and Freeman counsel Bale.
1371;Oldman is cast against type and quite effectively as a good cop.
1372;the luscious musical score by committee is appropriately strong and heroic without leaning on a catchy title theme as previous Batman scores have popularized e. g. Nelson Riddle on TV and Danny Elfman in film.
1373;The art direction and set design are impressive in their own interpretation of Gotham City compared to the earlier Tim Burton films which set a new standard.
1374;Although successes like X Men and Spiderman are good examples of mainstream, pop hero entertainment, the makers of Batman Begins for the most part have raised the super hero film to an art film, and that's not a bad thing.
1375;By all accounts, their effort, fittingly entitled Batman Begins, was a resounding success.
1376;The critics loved it and audiences flocked to the theatres to see it.
1377;So, what did they do right?The casting.
1378;Christian Bale, who has proven that he's got considerable acting chops with an impressive resume, perfectly captures the essence of the tortured billionaire.
1379;They bring sincerity and just the right amount of believability to their roles.
1380;Nolan brings an art house sensibility to a big budget superhero film which gives it more substance.
1381;He treats the source material with the respect that it deserves.
1382;this is the best Batman film to date.
1383;Nolan does not make this same mistake and he has created an excellent comic book adaptation that deserves to be ranked with other superior examples of the genre.
1384;He wanted to depict his world realistically and talks about working with co. screenwriter Goyer who in turn talks about what he wanted to do with the character.
1385;Gotham City Rises takes a look at the creation of Gotham City and the Batcave.
1386;Path to Discovery explores Bruce Wayne before he became Batman.
1387;Shaping Mind and Body takes a look at Bale's preparation for the role.
1388;work for a more, visceral style.
1389;We also see it being tested and built.
1390;Saving Gotham City takes a look at the exciting monorail chase scene that takes place during the climatic part of the movie.
1391;comic book that includes three stories that inspired Goyer and Nolan's screenplay.
1392;This is a darker, more realistic Batman movie.
1393;For comic book fans who have read the earliest stories, this movie series should be heaven.
1394;christopher Nolan is taking audiences back to how Batman was intended to be: a dark master detective who is HUMAN.
1395;And Nolan (mistakenly) creates a love interest for Batman/Bruce Wayne in Rachel (played poorly by Katie Holmes).
1396;the story and the action are truly inspired.
1397;, and true to the original.
1398;What more could fans ask for?Highly recommend.
1399;This is the best movie I've seen in some time.
1400;Christian Bale is superb as are the other actors.
1401;It will renew your faith that great movies are still being made.
1402;Batman Begins was really exciting because from the first trailer I saw I knew that this was going to be the one to turn it around.
1403;begins totally revamps the Batman formula, giving it a much harder and more realistic edge.
1404;The costume of batman is incredible, a lot more thought was put into it this time.
1405;Acting is well done, with top.
1406;notch performances from everyone, including Christian Bale who I think did a wonderful job bringing back some dignity to the character of Bruce Wayne who had gotten a 2.
1407;Lets face it girls would you just love to see George Clooney in those scrubs playing the ever so sexy and slighty turlmoulus Doug Ross on ER.
1408;I know that sounds strange, but it means a lot if you are a Batman fan.
1409;Aside from that, this origin story is believable with the present day setting and almost to the point of """"wow, this could actually happen."""""""
1410;The best part of this film is the minimal use of CGI.
1411;Of course the bats, parts of the train, and some of Gotham was CGI integrated, but still very believable looking.
1412;mobile or Tumbler tank was a real treat to see.
1413;"the amazing notion is that it actually exists and you couldn't help yourself with saying ""I want one!"
1414;Another plus is there is an awesome amount of A. list actors and actresses in this film.
1415;All are wonderful performance with making a Batman story come to life scene after scene.
1416;But Katy Holmes performance was good so I immediately didn't mind her being in it.
1417;Anyway, Batman Begins is worth a Blu.
1418;Great gift for any time.
1419;Batman begins is a great movie, there is no doubt about that as I'm sure you all know.
1420;its the only thing great about this set.
1421;In the end I can only recommend this movie the the truly HARD CORE hard core fans of the new batman movie's.
1422;It held it's own as the best batman movie to date.
1423;The storyline is great, the plot is worthy of the title and this movie hopfully will catapult with an amazing series of SERIOUS and DARK movies that do the batman justice, the way he was always meant to be portrayed.
1424;This movie was good, and the second one was even better.
1425;This is a film that shows the development of real masculinity .
1426;I always love the feel that Christopher Nolan adds to his movies, but this movie did a wonderful job at capturing Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman.
1427;I also especially loved the hallucinogenic scenes.
1428;Its very satisfying to see the character done right.
1429;Maybe the new generation of kids will enjoy this.
1430;But as a new twist on Batman, 2 stars.
1431;Great product for any Batman fan.
1432;style justice, explains how he not only hones his skills, but also how he confronts his fear.
1433;But the Legion is more a crusader for justice in an extreme way.
1434;where the previous Batman films featured a Dark Knight already at the peak of his powers, this shows Batman in the making.
1435;In his belief in universal justice as opposed to parochial revenge, his role as champion and hero puts him higher than the aforementioned vigilantes.
1436;Veteran actor Michael Caine scores points as the ever faithful butler Alfred.
1437;And yes, the ending more than hints at a sequel.
1438;Batman Begins certainly isn't perfect, but it more than does the job of instilling new life into the Batman cinematic universe.
1439;It should never have come to that, as Batman is by far the most compelling and human superhero ever envisioned.
1440;story right, but it does hit on Bruce Wayne's primary motivation .
1441;and that works great and really helps tie this movie together.
1442;"It's great to see a dark and gritty side to the character
1443;nolan certainly succeeds when it comes to making his movie as realistic as possible, especially in terms of the big chase scene.
1444;Realism bows to unbelievable theatrics all too soon, especially in terms of the big plan to purge Gotham City of its sins and social degeneration, but even this fits well inside the Batman milieu .
1445;and it makes for some pretty exciting action on the screen.
1446;the link between Gordon and Wayne, which extends all the way back to Wayne's childhood, is subtly done.
1447;Michael Caine is surprisingly good as the venerable Alfred.
1448;Morgan Freeman (the best actor in Hollywood, for my money) lends great presence to an otherwise minor character.
1449;I also liked the dichotomy established between Bruce Wayne and Batman .
1450;I see what Nolan did with the character, and I suppose she does help define Wayne as well as Batman, but this film could have easily done away with her character and never skipped a beat.
1451;Ra's Al Ghul, after all, feels himself to be a noble force for justice in a world of degenerate behavior.
1452;there's really no doubt about the fact that Batman Begins is the best Batman movie to date.
1453;Christian Bale grows into the role (both figuratively and literally .
1454;gaining back all the weight he lost for The Machinist) quite well as the story progresses, the supporting cast is loaded with big stars who live up to their names, and the special effects (even all of those CGI bats) are awe.
1455;inspiring and fun to watch.
1456;Most importantly, though, Christopher Nolan succeeds in putting the dark back into the Dark Knight.
1457;Christopher Nolan did an incredible job with this movie!
1458;Out of all of the Batman movies i've seen, this ones my favorite.
1459;It is and always will be the best Batman movie ever by Warner Brothers has ever done!
1460;It is the best movie ever about batman yet.
1461;Christian bale, Liam Neeson and other great actors are in this well played out motion picture.
1462;The story is almost perfect, but what is missing is Danny Elfman music and I missed the tone of Batman Return which is one of the top 2 batman movie ever filmed.
1463;they're both amaziong and well.
1464;batman Begins is one of the best movies of 2005.
1465;The supporting cast is great, except for Katy Holmes.
1466;She's okay, but everyone else does such a great job that they make her look very mediocre.
1467;Michael Caine brings heart and a """"fatherly"""" presence to Alfred that has not been seen in the previous Batman films."""
1468;"Morgan Freeman is wonderful as Lucius Fox, a James Bond ""Q"" type character who creates all of Bruce/Batman's weapons."
1469;Liam Neeson does a great job as Bruce's mentor Ducard.
1470;Gary Oldman is wonderful as a young Commissioner Gordon (although he's just a sergeant and lieutenant in Batman Begins).
1471;Cillian Murphy does a great job as the sinister Dr. Crane/Scarecrow.
1472;As I said before, the acting is just wonderful.
1473;Nolan's direction is awesome as well.
1474;The film is as real as possible and uses the least amount of CGI possible for an action film in the 21st Century.
1475;Nolan makes this film a character development story, a heart.
1476;pounding action film, and at times a pretty scary horror movie (Batman actually is a predator and the audience gets to see how street thugs feel when he's hunting them).
1477;Thank goodness someone finally actually considered the COMICS for a reference when making a Batman film.
1478;Batman Begins is without a doubt the best Batman film ever made and it is certainly one of the best films of the year.
1479;The acting, script, and direction are all superb.
1480;This part of the plot is wonderfully done by Christopher Nolan.
1481;is halted with a train derailment.
1482;"if you treasure a true ""Dark Knight"" stay away."
1483;Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins explores the origin of the Dark Knight.
1484;Bruce finds someone who is strong, fearful, and has a cool car: Batman.
1485;starting from how and why Bruce Wayne fears bats to Bruce becoming what he fears, Batman Begins is, in my opinion, the best superhero movie ever.
1486;Christian Bale played the perfect Batman, showing leadership and fear like the character should be.
1487;"When I saw Christian Bale in the batsuit, I thought ""Now that is Batman""."
1488;If you're not a Batman fan, this movie will turn you into one.
1489;8 years after killing the Batman franchise thanks to director Joel Schumacher and Warner Brothers for giving the green light to do so, Batman is reborn in this exquisite effort by Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale.
1490;Giving the upmost respect to the DC comic book character, Nolan has created a world that fans have only dreamed of seeing on the big screen in the past, and he succeeds to the utmost degree.
1491;If you are a fan of comic books and/or Batman you will be truly enjoying what a comic book film is supposed to be.
1492;It's so refreshing how much time and respect have gone into comic book films the last couple of years and you will be exhuberant as you take in this film.
1493;Christopher Nolan has resurrected a franchise that was dead and buried and improved upon the solid effort that Tim Burton put forth in the 1989 film BATMAN.
1494;Every acting effort here is solid, as Michael Cain, Morgan Freeman, and Katie Holmes all are great in their roles and they take all these roles seriously.
1495;One of (if not) the best comic book adaptations of all time, and a solid, solid effort.
1496;Batman Begins is one of the classier comic book adaptions of recent years.
1497;Be aware of this before you order.
1498;the film traces Bruce Wayne's journey from an embittered and self.
1499;destructive young man into his metamorphosis into a mysterious and powerful urban vigillante.
1500;Christian Bale throws himself into the dual roles of Bruce Wayne and Batman, giving us the best Batman since Michael Keaton.
1501;He's also given ample support from a Who's Who of Hollywood blockbusters .
1502;Along the way, there are strong echoes of the Tim Burton films, through the character designs, music, and general mood.
1503;There are also some top.
1504;notch action sequences, including one of the strangest car chases you're likely to see.
1505;top enough)to command our attention the way Jack Nicholson did as the Joker many years ago.
1506;still, this is a great start to what will hopefully be a long.
1507;This is a movie well worth watching again.
1508;This is a great start to a fantastic story line!
1509;This gives great detail to the development of the character who becomes the Dark Knight!!
1510;A must see film and must see series!
1511;"Instead of creating a world that was fantastical and ""comic booky"", Christopher Nolan decided to take the franchise in another direction and introduce a Batman that existed in the real world."
1512;"Christian Bale is great as the caped crusader, and it has everything you would expect from a Nolan film
1513;action wise (the animated films having always retained a mature nature since 1992), this is the best take on Batman since Burton's two.
1514;Batman's origin's are explored and some of his training is delved into.
1515;Michael Caine is the best Alfred, Michael Gough from the previous four hardly being in them until Batman and Robin, and that was only because he was dying.
1516;The plot is very good, with plenty of twists and turns to keep a new viewer on their toes.
1517;Lastly, James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer's score is quite good but their heroic theme is quite forgettable when compared to Danny Elfman's, but definitely a step up from that atrocious Elliot Goldenthal.
1518;and those are my 2 favorite movies of all time.
1519;and the animated series was amazing as well.
1520;this movie will be great if A. its gritty.
1521;lets go in the cinema with our fingers crossed
1522;Batman Begins is a great example of what happens when good guys (Chris Nolan, Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman) go bad.
1523;It goes on and on, and just when you think it's about to exhaust itself and die.
1524;edited, and so tightly shot that you can't see who's BAMFING and BAPPING and THWAPPING who.
1525;when I think Dark, Brooding, Vigilante Justice, I think the original, sleek, armored.

1527;"p. s.: If you enjoyed ""Batman Begins"", check out ""Catwoman"" and ""Doom""."
1528;Wanted to catch up prior to seeing the latest at the theaters.
1529;I have seen all the Batman films and I like most of them but this out is the best one yet the movie is dark and has that comic book feel to it and it made Batman cool agin.
1530;And this is for the one disc set.
1531;This movie contains a great extra, namely the first scene of The Dark Knight.
1532;As a movie, you either love it or not.
1533;On its own, this is a fine movie.
1534;It tends to get a bit comic booky in the third act, but overall it's a great film.
1535;The Special Features disc is loaded with cool features that really enhance your movie viewing experience.
1536;"tastic"", but ""pretty damn awesome"" will have to do."
1537;done, and the movie remains engrossing thanks to psychological drama.
1538;pulling way that blunts their visceral impact.
1539;In this moment the transformation to Batman is fully realized in a powerful, entertaining way.
1540;The writing is excellent overall and there are precious few eye.
1541;And sure, Katie Holm's voice has that slightly annoying helium to it, but she plays the part just fine (and is fun to look at.)
1542;But it's smart, psychological and full of memorable moments.
1543;If they keep the same director and tighten things up a bit, the series will be one to treasure.
1544;it bothers to create characters the audience cares about, and it gives those characters good lines to deliver.
1545;This movie was a pleasant surprise for my family (most of us anyhow).
1546;The rest of us loved it.
1547;This show gave me an origin to the entire concept of the show from the beginning by carefully and compellingly laying a foundation for how and why Batman uses the image he does and how he overcomes evil.
1548;It appeals to your internal sense of justice in a refined way that rejects some of the eastern tendencies that bother some of us.
1549;So it's a four star.
1550;but the rest of the movie is really good.
1551;kids can watch it and enjoy it because the bad language and sexual connotations that many movies contain were absent by and large.
1552;honestly the other Batman stuff I've seen in the last few years never made me happy.
1553;As an old 60's Batman and Robin guy this was the first movie on Batman that I've seen that I thought was worth watching.
1554;See it if you haven't.
1555;at least most of you will.
1556;Christian Bale makes an excellent Bruce Wayne, a figure who is truly haunted and searching for a meaning to life, taking the road less traveled into becoming what he hates until found by the mysterious Ducard.
1557;Mr. Bale is excellent in the exploring the depths of Bruce Wayne as he goes from being a vengeful college student, to being a petty criminal, searching to find himself as Ducard's pupil and finally determined to rid Gotham of crime rejecting the violence of the League of Shadows.
1558;the film is beautifully cast, down to the smaller roles.
1559;Michael Caine does a wonderful job as Alfred, providing a great deal of the film's humor and the necessary reassuring figure for Bruce Wayne.
1560;Katie Holmes does well as Wayne's love interest in a part that has little of the sexuality of the prior films but stands as a disapproving figure to Bruce Wayne's playboy image.
1561;Gary Oldman was an inspired choice as Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman is wonderful as the Wayne Enterprises head of Applied Science and Liam Neeson makes a tough minded mentor and later an effective adversary.
1562;"I also liked seeing Rutgar Hauer (Blade Runner) in a mainstream movie
1563;Most important, Batman Begins brings back the feel of the comic books, telling a great story.
1564;For those too young to remember Tim Burton, the director of """"Batman"""" and """"Batman Returns"""", was a young visionary filmmaker and his offerings in the series reflected his comic."""
1565;"Joel Schumacher, the director of ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman and Robin"", took a campier approach to the character."
1566;For instance, Jack Nicholson, who played the Joker in the first installment(and was quite good), received top billing over Michael Keaton as Batman.
1567;Though Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, or Alfred Molina would be considered household names they were the right actors for the roles and that contributed to the success of Raimi's films.
1568;Christian Bale is the perfect choice for the conflicted Bruce Wayne/Batman.
1569;Bale, aside from his impressive physique, expertly displays the torment of a man who loathes injustice but has to skirt the fine line between crusader and vigilante.
1570;An example at how well cast a film this is Cillian Murphy, who is excellent as the Scarecrow, isn't the most interesting secondary character.
1571;this movie was pretty good.
1572;christian bale did pretty good as batman.
1573;but all in all the movie was good.
1574;the real strength of this film is its emphasis on atmosphere and character, so much so that I didn't mind that Batman didn't appear until roughly an hour into the film.
1575;When he does finally show up, it's great.
1576;If your thinking about double dipping maybe this can help.
1577;I kind of thought this might happen considering the movie has a pretty dark layout throughout.
1578;In the original Rachel's face has a hint of some colors that shouldnt be there a slight greenish blue.
1579;Although I do notice a difference I dont recommend double dipping this film because its not such a drastic improvement as you see in other films.
1580;This is Batman as it should be.
1581;There is no happy ending .
1582;That is what makes this movie so perfect.
1583;This is much better than The Dark Night or the Dark Night Rises.
1584;Bales role in Batman Begins was outstanding.
1585;It really shows the dark side of Batman and makes it believable.
1586;"Readers beware!Anyhow, ""Batman Begins"" certainly contains some spectacular moments (e. g. the ""Tibet"" sequence, actually filmed in Iceland) and the plot contains enough twists to keep you guessing ."
1587;aspect TV the image shows up with bars on the top and bottom, as well as on both sides.
1588;Instead of filling the whole screen, it floats in the center, a shrunken version of what it should be.
1589;"I was able to enlarge it by going to ""panorama"" mode, but this creates distortion at the edges."
1590;above average, but hardly the masterpiece some have proclaimed it to be.
1591;This is a real good film.
1592;Actually, the first half of this production is an excellent movie and the second half is still pretty darned.
1593;"as the title implies ""Batman Begins"" is an origin story."
1594;This is usually my favorite part of Superhero epics .
1595;known, though strong actor .
1596;Bale fits the role and the costume well.
1597;He's brooding, strong, vulnerable, yet decisive .
1598;another surprise is director Christopher Nolan of the highly acclaimed Memento.
1599;"straining feature
1600;What an exciting risk to employ.
1601;This is a film that cares a great deal for what is going on inside the Bat.
1602;man's head"
1603;building a solid motif around fear, this strong screenplay unfolds masterfully until the two.
1604;That said, the film's other foes are well.
1605;Needless to say, this movie is a fantastic origin story of one of the most widely known icons in American popular culture.
1606;ray owners as it is full of the obligatory behind the scenes features.
1607;It is an absolute must have for Batman fans as well as movie.
1608;I thought the movie was fantastic.
1609;I really love Christopher Nolan's work, and think the cast is amazing.
1610;but what seems to be important , more than the darkness, is the journey.
1611;a story of a journey, and quite effective.
1612;The supporting cast is brilliant.
1613;ok, I had never seen Katie Holmes in anything, and she wasn't so great in my opinion, but I am sure in the right vehicle(and I don't mean on the back of Tom's Motorcyle) she is great.
1614;He is, in my opinion, on a level with Johnny Depp for risky work.
1615;He is so fun to watch.
1616;You never know where he is going, he keeps you on guard, but ultimately he pulls out a rich, nuanced performance.
1617;finally, lets applaud a piece that is nuanced itself.
1618;Funny at times, couched in relationship and history rather than just bloodshed, filled with action.
1619;Christopher Nolan finally nails the director's part.
1620;"A perfect blend of ""Glade freshness"", talent and skill, and interpretation."
1621;They got a virtual unknown that adds flare to the part of the Dark Knight.
1622;Bale is both strong, mysterious, and talented.
1623;picture deal to continue the Batman legacy.
1624;the story is great, as well as the story, cast, writing/directing, and morals.
1625;"The best Batman since ""Batman Forever"", this one's definately worth your time, and money."
1626;Clear your mind and see this film fresh.
1627;Everyone (except Katie Holmes)excels in this movie and it is very fun.
1628;I recommend this to see in the theater.
1629;"Christopher Nolan has definitely done his homework, and has taken the persona of Batman back to the dark, brooding, mysterious, tormented realm the character BELONGS in
1630;But even if we disregard Schumacher for a moment, Batman Begins by itself is a triumph.
1631;from the locations and sets to the cinematography to the music.
1632;Even the Wayne mansion that we see young Bruce in is gothic and foreboding.
1633;what made this movie one of my favorites of all time is its psychology: Nolan decided to give the audience a glimpse into Bruce's tormented mind and soul, which hasn't happened before in a Batman movie.
1634;And Christian Bale is to be hailed for pulling all of this off while making it look easy.
1635;is actually the best part"
1636;tech gadgets take a back seat to this important development, for both Bruce and the movie.
1637;So it's ironic that Holmes has one of the most important lines in the movie, at the end when Rachel rejects Bruce.
1638;"This cuts his last remaining bridge to the ""light"" world, and he is left entirely in the ""shadow"" world, the world of Batman."
1639;"Bruce is left with the realization that now, thanks to fate and the choices he made, there is no going back
1640;I am happy to add this to my collection and look forward to watching this over and over!
1641;Since his first appearence in Detective Comics #27 in May 1939, the Batman has appeared in countless comics, live action and animated T. v shows, feature films, toys, and video games.
1642;The film begins with Bruce Wayne (played by Christian Bale) locked away in a prison in South Asia.
1643;wayne uses the resources of his family company, Wayne Enterprises, to secure his suit, gadgets, and Batmobile that he is known for.
1644;The film strives to be as realistic as possible with the development of the Batman's tools.
1645;It's nearly an hour into the film before we even get to see Wayne as Batman, but the journey to that point is so interesting that it feels extremely rewarding when we get to it.
1646;There is a slew of characters, all protrayed excellently by a great cast.
1647;Other than Bale and Neeson, Wayne's Butler and childhood guardian Alfred is played perfectly by Michael Caine.
1648;Gary Oldman is superb as Sgt. James Gordon, seemingly the only honest cop in a truely corrupt city.
1649;Actress Katie Holmes is Wayne's childhood friend/love interest and Gotham City assistant district attorney.
1650;ray are excellent given that this release is several years old now.
1651;The menus look outdated, but there is a good quantity of special features on this disc.
1652;overall, Batman Begins is a insightful look at the motivations of one of comic book's most interesting characters.
1653;At the time of the release of this film, I felt it was the best movie based on a comic book that I had seen.
1654;A flash of a dark omious figure, and then he's there, in front of you, behind you, above you, and your life of crime is now over.
1655;This is the Batman, I, my Father, my Mother, My Fiancee, my Brother, and everyone I know has been waiting for.
1656;As a fan of the Comics, and of Paul Dini's masterpiece, Batman the Animated Series, I had high expectations of this film.
1657;Burton was always more interested in why the villians were the villians, and most of the screen time in both of his films are dedicated to showing us the Villians' origins.
1658;this is BATMAN:YEAR ONE done right.
1659;He has help in the the form of Michael Caine as Alfred, spot on and ego free.
1660;katie Holmes is a womderful Rachel.
1661;A grounded Love interest for Bruce, that keeps him centered on the past that was, and that which was happy.
1662;He proves that Youth and Speed do not trounce Age and Experience.
1663;and Gary Oldman is just fantastic as Lt. Gordon.
1664;Not quite the confident ally of Batman yet, he is new to the scene, and is feling things out.
1665;This is the Batman of the comic.
1666;A great return to form.
1667;Tim Burton's version is a classic yet this version borrows the darkness of the original and adds the grittiness of real life.
1668;As much as I like the Dark Knight, in terms of replay value I think Batman Begins has it all: a great story, perfect acting, and a slick polish.
1669;nolan proves that he can more than manage the action scenes needed to bring Batman into the new millennium, and his set and lighting choices are inspired.
1670;although the story is fantastic, what really sets this film apart is the acting collective on display: Michael Caine, Christian Bale,Rutger Hauer, and Morgan Freeman are all fantastic.
1671;batman Begins is marked out by its attention to detail and the fact it has been well planned and brilliantly executed.
1672;Sorry I love the Tim Burton movies, but this is the best Batman film.
1673;The story, actors, music, all make this a really good movie.
1674;Michael Caine is great as Alfred he brings a warmth to the role.
1675;Gary Oldman is phenominal as Jim Gordon, I was happy at the way he played the character.
1676;Really good movie and from the end of it, I'm waiting for a sequel.
1677;I agree with almost all the good reviews.
1678;one of the things I always loved about the character was that he's a """"self."""
1679;A HUGE part of that is his intellect, a feature that really sets him apart from a lot of super power superheroes.
1680;I got the feeling Bale's Batman had done his physical homework.
1681;but that he may have been cutting class to do it.
1682;that having been said, I can't really say that ANY of the live action Batman movies have ever done a good job of this (the best may have been the Adam West Batman.
1683;Christian Bale is the best choice to play Batman so far.
1684;This is a much more believable Caped Crusader and less cartoonish take on a well known character that has been around some sixty odd years.
1685;Today's Batman is a hero for all ages and this first installment will set the standard for quite some time.
1686;Having seen the Dark Knight and finding it equally as good if not better I can only hope that Bale will stay on board in the title role for at least a few more.
1687;If the cape fits, wear it!
1688;Batman has been my favorite superhero for over fifty years.
1689;"When I saw ""Batman Begins"" on opening day in the theaters in 2006, I was pleasantly surprised."
1690;Christopher Nolan had given me the perfect Batman portayed by Christian Bale.
1691;The supporting cast was outstanding.
1692;Michael Caine as Alfred, Gary Oldman as Gordon, Katie Holmes as his childhood love, Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman to round out the cast and all gave superlative performances.
1693;The story was fitting for a superhero, and the Batmobile was an added bonus.
1694;Even the background music track was excellent.
1695;This movie surpassed all my expectations.
1696;And not just a great Batman movie but a great film!
1697;I was in awe at how fantastic this movie was that I saw it twice in IMAX!
1698;"the film is an ""action film"" but also very thought."
1699;"The world of ""Batman Begins"" is so real and believable, yet fantastical enough to sweep you away."
1700;Lots of twists and turns with plenty of characters for all kinds of sub.
1701;I'm amazed they packed it with so much and still kept it moving right along.
1702;"I'm curious to see an ""extended cut"" should one ever become available."
1703;So, if you haven't seen it yet, see it!
1704;Anyway, 95% of the reviews all over the world about this film are very positive so that should speak volumes.
1705;INCREDIBLE!Kudos to the cast and crew of BATMAN BEGINS!
1706;christopher Nolan's take on the Caped Crusader takes a refreshing and more serious direction than the previous two installments of the Batman franchise.
1707;If you have seen his portrayal of Patrick Bateman in American Psycho you begin to recognise a true acting talent.
1708;His transformation from murderous, souless Wall St yuppie into one of the world's most recognisable superheroes is very similar to Michael Keaton's transformation from his funny OTT performance as the green haired, bug.
1709;michael Caine is great as Alfred.
1710;gotham City has also been given a fresh takeover.
1711;This supplements the film's more sober approach to the Batman legacy.
1712;i found this film brilliant in its fresh retake on the story.
1713;This, arguably, is the best superhero film to be made in years.
1714;It has revitalised the legacy for new Batman fans as well as offering something new for old die.
1715;Loved the scene where the Batman winched up the crooked cop and screamed in his face, that was perfect, that was what sealed the movie for me as the best Batman movie of all time, in fact the best super hero portrayal movie of all time.
1716;the Batman and Liu Kang are the most fluid characters there.]
1717;"Michael Caine didn't fit my visual image of Alfred, but wow, what a performance in a supporting role
1718;I bought this movie on Blu.
1719;ray with high expectations, and they were all met.
1720;I love this movie and it is only made better on blu.
1721;This movie looks and sounds awesome!
1722;I thought it was way sweet that they included the opening sceen from the Dark.
1723;Fast paced and fun movie.
1724;Love the special effects and all the gadgets.
1725;A good story line for fictional stuff.
1726;Amazing movie, great transfer .
1727;The bonus IMAX preview of the Dark knight was pure eye candy.
1728;I've always loved the batman movies, although Batman and Robin was definitely the low point in the movie series.
1729;You can rest assured that Batman Begins is truly a new beginning for the franchise.
1730;I love the movie, but it kept freezing constantly so I couldn't really be happy with it.
1731;I got more frustrated watching it than just enjoying the movie.
1732;All in all, an enjoyable action movie to show how the Batman legend begins.
1733;and it is an admirable one.
1734;is to account for in a realistic way how the fictional character Bruce Wayne became Batman the superhero.
1735;But it was director Christopher Nolan who made it work.
1736;Memento is a stunningly brilliant film that skyrocketed Nolan to fame.
1737;He cares about comics and comic book heroes and he knows enough about film to write a script that might work.
1738;He and Nolan share credit for the script.
1739;the later part of the movie shows Bruce Wayne discovering a cave under the Wayne Mansion, interacting with the loyal family butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and getting help with his crime.
1740;there are an number of nice touches and the visuals are really arresting.
1741;regardless, this is without question the best superhero movie I've ever seen.
1742;It is not only a commercial triumph for Nolan and everybody connected with the picture but, given the genre, an artistic and creative one as well.
1743;see this for Christopher Nolan who is quickly becoming one of Hollywood's most successful directors.
1744;My ONLY pet peeve (you gotta have one.)
1745;Great movie and i look forward to the next one with the Joker!
1746;There's certainly some fun to campy versions of comic books .
1747;such as the previous batman movies .
1748;this movie has resonance and relevance.
1749;It has heart, soul, and action.
1750;It has an interesting, engaging plotline filled with multi.
1751;adventure because it gives it real stakes.
1752;like Spiderman I and II, Batman Returns heralds a new age of comic book and action films.
1753;Films that are intelligent, written as well as any highbrow drama.
1754;similar to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, these films all have the chance of resurrecting the power of myth in our movies.
1755;And as we become used to them, there is the very real chance of creating new myths for our new millennium.
1756;truly, Batman has begun again in BATMAN BEGINS, and I truly appreciate the skillful and soulful work of Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer.
1757;man Origin story, and it looks and sounds amazing on blu.
1758;Amazingly done and great bonus features.
1759;This new Batman film is a fresh start to a new series, giving a new storyline and being more accurate to the comic books.
1760;Soon, Bruce returns to Gotham and becomes BATMAN!OPINION: Wow!
1761;This is by far the best Batman movie!
1762;Great action, beautiful story, a dark and gloomy atmosphere, and staying true to the comic books make this one a hit!!!
1763;Michael Caine is incredible, Christian Bale is.
1764;On the whole, the director does a great job creating a more realistic setup for the Batman character .
1765;a huge task, but a satisfying attempt.
1766;This movie is visually astounding, and loaded with action that will have you on the edge of your seat!
1767;In my opinion, a unstopable beast on wheels!
1768;You gotta see the movie to believe me.
1769;This Batman Begins is truely the beginning of a great run of Batman movies!
1770;I was also completely astounded how they turned the series from a dark and beautiful series with """"Batman"""" and """"Batman Returns"""" and made it into a cartoon show with the fourth one."""
1771;"Even the first two ""Batman"" movies as great as they were, sometimes had problems with occasional cartoonish character and too much flamboyance that diluted the foreboding nature of the comic."
1772;Batman Begins is the beginning of a whole new era in the saga and completely does away with any of the styles of old.
1773;out of all of them, Christian Bale's rendition of Batman is by far the best out of all of them!
1774;I never thought I'd say but Bales performance outdoes even Michael Keaton's version of Bruce Wayne/Batman and the expressions are far more frightening yet more respectable than ever before!
1775;The expressions are highly realistic.
1776;His character is without a doubt one of the greatest villainous roles that I've ever seen and it proves how Neeson is incredible at playing sophisticated villains.
1777;Batman Begins is a brand new beginning of a new era in Batman's history!
1778;Batman Begins brings the series back to its roots.
1779;Christian Bale does a wonderful job of taking the audience through Wayne's transformation from an angry child into the avenger of Gotham.
1780;While learning more about his own nature and the nature of criminals he still struggles with his anger and uses his new lifestyle as a means of acting out that aggression, but without any real purpose.
1781;the introduction of Ducard into this dismal world provides Bruce with a source of focus and a redirection for that anger.
1782;He becomes a man, a man with a purpose and the ability to fulfill that purpose.
1783;He learns to rely on those who have proven their loyalty and trust in himself.
1784;christian Bale's portrayal brings Batman's dark, conflicted nature back to the screen, but this time the audience has a greater understanding of those conflicts.
1785;Beautiful transfer with dynamic color range and three dimensional shadows.
1786;Asides from the technical superiority of this disc, the movie itself shifts the paradigm of its genre into something more, something better, and you are left with a truly great film.
1787;Personally I think this is the best Batman movie ever made.
1788;Yeah the car isn't what we all know it to be, but the action and the storyline is quite good.
1789;The antagonist is kind of unlike any other movie which is bizarre but at the same time interesting.
1790;This is because you actually see Batman with unpredictable struggles rather than not being able to kill his enemy the first time they fight.
1791;It's an incredible movie and is worthy of all the praise it can get.
1792;The acting and directing is top notch.
1793;Also the story is great.
1794;Someone actually told me that BATMAN BEGINS was a decent action hero flick.
1795;a deep, broad, introspective spectacle of existential proportions.
1796;even a vehicle that reminded me of a high.
1797;Writer David Goyer and director Christopher Nolan collaborated on the screenplay.
1798;an allegedly brilliant manuscript destined to redefine the action hero genre.
1799;And Batman (played by a wild.
1800;eyed Christian Bale), once he puts on his pointy.
1801;Two stars for the special features deluxe edition, as the information presented on the second disc is much more entertaining than the film itself.
1802;I love that it beyond a comic story.
1803;Its well written with lots of action.
1804;Batman Returns is a wonderful exercise in symbolism.
1805;It's also a fun ride.
1806;Batman Returns works on so many levels, and, as a boost, is loads of fun to watch(while scarfing down endless gummie bears of course).
1807;I absolutely loved the 1989 Batman movie with Micahel Keaton and Jack Nicholson, so when I learned they were going to discard that and start from a clean slate, I was a bit bothered.
1808;But after a few viewings of this Christopher Nolan masterpiece, I had began to make the transformation over to the new series, as it really is one of the finest comic book films ever created .
1809;Unlike some comic book movies, this one takes itself very seriously (yet still holds a certain amount of humor too).
1810;Its a very intriguing story, and the characters are fantastic, adding to the depth.
1811;An incredible mixed cast of Liam Neeson, Micahel Caine, Morgan Freeman and Katie Holmes are a few of the actors that shine in this film.
1812;the action is pretty tough in this film too.
1813;i could go on and on about the great things about this film, but it is honestly worth seeing.
1814;If you are skeptical about remakes, like me, this one will probably win you over once you realize how good it is.
1815;this is the Batman movie we've all always waited for.
1816;Now, don't get me wrong: Burton's Batman was a lot of fun, and Schumacher's slightly less so, but still enjoyable in a way.
1817;This film shows us this.
1818;it sets Batman up against two of his famous nemeses.
1819;"this movie is a treat, exciting from start to finish, and is maybe the best comics ""origin"" film that we have thus far."
1820;If you're a fan of the animated series, before Robin/Nightwing and Batgirl of course, this is for you.
1821;I hear he's also interested in sequels, so keep it coming!
1822;Saw The Dark Knight Rises and wanted to see how it all began and loved it.
1823;Yes, Batman Begins is as good as all the other reviews have stated.
1824;And that's not saying that there aren't action sequences, but it actually has an exciting story that causes its great appeal too.
1825;The cast is absolutely fantastic.
1826;Bale plays a wonderful Batman who is able to change his attitude in the split of a second as his personality goes from Batman to Bruce and vice versa.
1827;Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Ken Watanube, and Tom Wilkonson are great as always.
1828;The storyline is very creative and provides an interesting twist (compared to the normal Batman tales) as does most of Nolan's work.
1829;This movie has excellent casting with some of my favorites actors, including Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, and Liam Neeson.
1830;The storyline is pretty interesting.
1831;They are dark, funny, sexy, and work great as comic book adaptations.
1832;A new reboot was necessary but I don't think anyone was prepared to see how Batman's return to the big screen was going to be that spellbinding in the hands of the gifted director Christopher Nolan.
1833;batman Begins takes the hero to its origins in a most realistic, dark way.
1834;Also, Bale is surrounded by an extraordinary supporting cast composed by Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy and Katie Holmes.
1835;This is a much human and realistic portrait of an amazing character that slowly builds the foundation of future Batman films.
1836;Still it offers balanced colors and there are not compression artifacts to see.
1837;bonus Features:BB comes with some special features that include a PIP commentary, many featurettes which delves with the creation of Gotham, the cast, the action sequences, the special effects and more and the Imax Prologue of TDK.
1838;There is a great assortment of bonus material that will keep you engaged and entertained.
1839;closing Thoughts:Batman Begins is the best origin movie for a superhero and the second best Batman movie (behind its sequel), its has a great story, a compelling hero and amazing supporting characters that make this film to stand above the usual hero films.
1840;Batman Begins is a great action movie for adults, teens and older pre.
1841;Batman Begins is a lot more aggressive and harsh.
1842;A few curse words including H*ll, D**n, and A**.
1843;I assure you it is.
1844;It has lot of compelling fight scenes that have you at the tip of your seat wondering what will happen next.
1845;The plot is good and is the classic good vs. evil though detailed and not boring.
1846;All together Batman Begins is a great movie full of conflict, action, adventure and a entertaining plot.
1847;I highly recommend it for adults, teens, and mature pre.
1848;This is a good movie and was hard to find where I lived and was able to get it on here at a good price.
1849;christian Bale was, of course, very good.
1850;Anyone familiar w/the comics KNOWS that Ghul comes in later in his career.3.
1851;the fight scenes were very cool, the special effects outstanding.
1852;Of all of Christian Bale's films, this one I like best.
1853;It is the most philosophical of all the films.
1854;Because of the philosophy this film has kept my interest and I have watched this films perhaps 100 times.
1855;This film sets a firm bases for the two other Batman films.
1856;Before you watch the other films, watch Batman Begins.
1857;christopher Nolan's Memento is one of my favorite movies.
1858;I think it's that good.
1859;It is clever, original, and well written.
1860;True, it promises a character study of what drives a man to dress up like a bat and fight crime, and it does do a decent job of delivering on that promise.
1861;That aspect of the movie was interesting and reasonably wall done.
1862;My point is that Nolan has gone from making a truly original film to dressing up tired action movie cliches.
1863;man II shows how good a big.
1864;thought it was better than the Dark Knight 1.
1865;I highly recommend this movie.
1866;I also love the fact that an on demand Amazon online version came with the movie.
1867;The best movie adaptation of batman ever made.
1868;i found the film realistic, believable and human.
1869;I would say it is the best action movie of the year.
1870;Better than the other Batman flicks, with a more realistic, masculine and sexy Batman.
1871;The butler Arthur is superb in his role as are all the other supporting actors.
1872;if you analyze the plot for more than ten seconds you may be running a logic deficit and realize it's a whole bunch of hogwash, but it is a comic book after all, and one must suspend a portion of the thinking mind.
1873;First of all, great movie.
1874;"On my third try I bought it used in ""very good"" condition."
1875;other than that stupid issue, this is a great movie with a great origin story, great acting, music, action.
1876;Batman Begins will be released Oct. 10th.
1877;Great beginning to an awesome trilogy.
1878;Was my husband's first time seeing it and he really enjoyed it.
1879;Easily the finest establishing picture a comic book character has ever enjoyed.
1880;The entire first act is a masterpiece, telling the crucial parts of Bruce Wayne's fabled origin while flashing forward to key moments in his early adulthood and laying the groundwork with an almost supernatural long.
1881;It's effortlessly cool and enveloping, a perfect hook that grounds the character in reality while also pre.
1882;explained resolution to blame, but it does such a good job of maintaining its momentum that those tripwires are easy to brush off.
1883;sized bucketful of wonderful performances from the cast doesn't hurt.
1884;name talent and nobody's mailing it in.
1885;Christian Bale is fantastic as the multi.
1886;layered lead character(s), but Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Liam Neeson are right there beside him in a wealth of glowing supporting roles.
1887;It's a dream come true for fans of the character, and a great reintroduction for casuals who'd been led astray the last iteration.
1888;Great Batman movie that is well produced and acted.
1889;Story line is moving and action packed .
1890;I really like the direction Christian Bale is taking the series.
1891;This was a good movie but what made the series better was when Director Christopher Nolan's career better and well established was The Dark Knight.
1892;That is his magic, so to speak.
1893;There's a constant debate, especially when it comes to superhero movies, if a certain screen adaptation of a character is the best depiction possible.
1894;Director Chris Nolan and his screenwriter David Goyer bring a gravitas to the franchise that never even existed in the darker Burton films.
1895;This is a film full of fleshed.
1896;out characters and an honest.
1897;god complex story, and the performers and technical crews have approached this material as if they were expecting major awards.
1898;rich Bruce Wayne ends his tour o' crime around the world in an Asian prison.
1899;With the help of his family's butler, Alfred (Michael Caine), and the mis.
1900;Later, Batman battles corporate greed in the form of the new head of Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle (the always wonderful.
1901;the story of Batman Begins is packed to the brim with themes of fear, vengeance, corruption, and family and each is given a satisfying length to develop.
1902;Suffice to say, this is one rich comic book movie that will reward further viewings.
1903;Nolan portrays this in great effect as many of the scenes are scarier than any horror film you'll see this year.
1904;"in the end, you have to ask yourself what makes the best superhero movie of all time ""the best."""
1905;Is it honesty with it's characters?
1906;An honoring of a long and rich legacy?
1907;An ambition to be something more than what is the norm of the genre?
1908;If so, Batman Begins fits all these bills and starts some bill of its own.
1909;This is the sixth Batman movie (counting Mask of the Phantasm and not the Adam West cornfest), and they've just now got it completely right with Begins.
1910;An outstanding cast brings to life a solid, action.
1911;filled, but intriguingly introspective script, aided by a whole new family of gadgets and some excellent special effects.
1912;bruce Wayne returns to Gotham City, to create his crime.
1913;Bruce Wayne's cover life as a rich and idle playboy brings him back into contact with life.
1914;The movie's climactic action sequence is a breathless and original thrill ride.
1915;the movie succeeds in part because the maturing Bruce Wayne gets as much if not more screen time than his caped alter ego.
1916;The family of gadgets includes an all.
1917;terrain batmobile, the usual Batman tool belt, and a thrilling way to fly.
1918;Bruce Wayne's relationship with Rachel Dawes is handled with an admirable restraint that recognizes the reality of his competing responsibilities.
1919;Batman Begins is very highly recommended as an outstanding and nuanced reimagining of the Batman story, told with crisp dialogue and plenty of thrilling action.
1920;I believe he has the best representation coupled with the great directing of Christopher Nolan
1921;The Batman movies with Christian Bale are the best ones in my opinion.
1922;Also, the action sequences and special effects are great as well.
1923;The first thing director Christopher Nolan does is say the hell with the neon colors, the over the top comic book sensibility, the freakshow circuses, let's take Batman back to his roots.
1924;Everyone knows the answers to these questions but we never saw these questions answered vividly before our very eyes on the cinematic screen before Batman Begins.
1925;Hey, even adults liked this movie, two birds with one stone.
1926;christian Bale is the best actor to inhabit this character, ever.
1927;Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne/Batman is a marked difference from previous actors, he is involving and fascinating as a character.
1928;From the tragedy of his past to the glory of his future, the whole path of this character makes perfect dramatic sense.
1929;Michael Caine does his job as Alfred, Liam Neeson is an intelligent villian, Cillian Murphy gets a bit on my nerves, but anyhow, the only person who lets the cast down is Katie Holmes.
1930;She's just there to be a pretty face and she's not that pretty!
1931;Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson and even Rutger Hauer are terrific supporting characters.
1932;That's a lot of name actors!The script and pacing are terrific, however Batman Begins does have it's faults.
1933;"piece to take your breath away and go, ""Wow, that's amazing!"""
1934;to be honest, but it's design makes sense in light of Nolan's more realistic take on the whole Batman mythology.
1935;( The Batmobile still looks very derivative, admit it! )
1936;overall, this film was a joy to watch.
1937;I saw it on the huge IMAX screen and was very happy to finally be witness to the Batman film we all rightfully deserved.
1938;office victory and the critical triumph, this film should not have been called Batman Begins, but instead Batman Redeemed!
1939;Great fun for the whole family.
1940;and yet none of them outpace the magic and beauty of Christopher Nolan's direction.
1941;who also helped write the screenplay.
1942;the musical score by Hans Zimmer is also nothing short of breathtaking.
1943;further intensifying the character development, action, plot and dialogue: the sign of a master movie composer at the top of his game.
1944;I really expected this to be the best Batman movie yet.
1945;The best parts of this movie, were shown on the commercials.
1946;We are in a golden age of comic book movies right now .
1947;Batman Begins explores the formation of the Dark Knight of Gotham, following Bruce Wayne as he begins a personal journey leading him to Batmanhood.
1948;Instead Christopher Nolan creates a movie as dark, tightly.
1949;wound and intense as Batman himself.
1950;but since this is a comic.
1951;book movie, Nolan peppers the story with kinetic action, high.
1952;the most striking part of this movie is Nolan's delving into morality, and the darker side of human nature.
1953;We see that Gotham has a rottennness in its heart, but Bruce won't harm people even if they are corrupt and evil .
1954;christian Bale is simply brilliant as Bruce Wayne/Batman .
1955;sure, his growly voice can get a bit silly at times, but he perfectly conveys the strength, pain and determination of a man who will sacrifice everything to save others.
1956;And he's ringed with a bunch of other great performances, particularly by the always.
1957;awesome Michael Caine as the faithful Wayne butler Alfred, and Morgan Freedman as the supplier of weird Wayne tech.
1958;there are also some wonderful villain performances.
1959;Batman Begins is a powerful, gritty reboot of the whole Batman mythos .
1960;and except for the horrendous female lead, it's an absolute masterpiece.
1961;Definitely see this, even if you aren't into superheroes.
1962;In Batman Begins, we see Wayne struggle with selflessness and selfishness.
1963;Warner Bros. has decided to redo the whole series dedicated and devoted to the comic books.
1964;the characters are great, the acting is great, and the plot is on the money, and there may be a sequel in the works.
1965;good movie, good image, sound and photography.
1966;I have always loved watching Batman Begins.
1967;ray makes the experience even more worthwhile.
1968;i highly recommend Batman Begins be viewed by all moviegoers in Blu.
1969;Batman Begins is exactly what Batman should be.
1970;Realistic, gritty, and the story of how a man decides to dedicate his entire being to stop from happening to others what once happened to him.
1971;Ra's is Batman's greatest foe, and was done great justice in this film.
1972;Batman is a comic book character, after all, and Gotham city is a fictional city, filled with fantastic villains as well as the normal real life problems that plague everyone else.
1973;In Batman Begins, the city of Gotham feels like it could be a real city, but it also gives you a view of twisted places like The Narrows that remind you of the fantastical portion of the story.
1974;both Nolan Batman movies are exactly what Batman should be, but I just feel that this one got it MORE right the first time.
1975;what sets this film apart is the fact that it has a well.
1976;written and believable psychological AND philosophical backstory, rather than being just another special effects and computer.
1977;At the same time, Nolan imbues a true focused sense of dramatic purpose and atmosphere to his treatment that easily eclipses the subsequent Joel Schumacher movies.
1978;fortunately, Christian Bale is ideally cast in the title role primarily because he is an actor who emits a searing presence by not divulging too much about his interior life.
1979;Under his cowl, he takes on Clint Eastwood's raspy vocal inflections to add to his mystique, and he brings a sinewy intelligence and quiet reserve to the conflicted millionaire Bruce Wayne.
1980;face and with genuine goodwill, plays put.
1981;In his usual impeccable form, Morgan Freeman portrays Lucius Fox, the brilliant staff scientist at Wayne Enterprises who invents Batman's wardrobe and gadgetry.
1982;As Wayne's manservant Alfred, Michael Caine seems to be enjoying the humorous asides and unyielding British sense of duty in his relatively constrained role.
1983;Cillian Murphy turns in the film's most chilling performance as the creepy psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane, evoking the perfect portions of fear and loathing in a character that makes my skin crawl.
1984;new vision of Gotham City is compelling thanks to Nathan Crowley's impressive set designs.
1985;Also thrilling are the scary visual effects conjured up for the hallucinogens.
1986;ups and quick edits, especially in the numerous fight scenes sometimes impinging on the clarity of the action presented.
1987;One of my favorite movies of all time, the best Batman yet.
1988;Fell in love and enjoyed it even more when I bought the blu ray.
1989;Finally on Blu Ray and my oh, my is it gorgeous.
1990;The gifts are ok, but what really makes it worth it is the 6 minute sneak peak for The Dark Knight.
1991;Thanks, I have so much fun and always traveled with, the price was fenomal and excellent service.
1992;I recommend Amazon to my friends to shop at this place
1993;Having watched all of the batman videos, this one is my favorite.
1994;The two disc contains the movie and a hilarious 'tankman' spoof on one disc, special features on the other.
1995;The special features weren't that spectacular unless you are really interested in all the behind the scenes shooting, a lot of it is the director talking about his plans/ideas for the movie and how they came to be.
1996;The movie is great, that's why i bought the movie, but i also wanted to see all the special features, that's the reason i bought it a blue.
1997;It happens with the following special features: Batman.
1998;the Journey Begins, Shaping Mind and Body, Gotham City Rises, Cape and Cowl, Batman.
1999;Other features such as The Dark Knight IMAX Prologue, Digital Batman work fine.
2000;A good movie, but I liked the 2nd one better.
2001;We'll see what the 3rd one has to offer.
2002;I was very pleased with the product, the speed of service, and the price.
2003;Dark and exciting, but still fun.
2004;This package is definetly worth it.
2005;It has a deep plot and great special affects.
2006;On the second disc, their are many interviews with Christopher Nolan and crew about the Making of the move, including the sets, and the batmobile, gotham city, genesis of the bat, and alot more.
2007;(the best Batman movie ever).
2008;It is definetly worth the money.
2009;This is the Batman movie I've been waiting for!
2010;The storyline, the action, the sets, acting, this movie surpassed all of the previous batman movies, especially the most recent Joel Schumacher ones which were horrible.
2011;It has that mood you must have for a Batman flick, without a type of pseudo.
2012;Great movie lots of great action.
2013;Keep doing what you are doing, it's nice work.
2014;I knew I just had to have it after I saw it.
2015;the action is great, a bit cheesy at times but I think that those moments are necessary.
2016;Those two characters are important to each other.
2017;His performance was perfect, to me at least.
2018;* shrug * Frankly Christopher Nolan makes great films, hands down.
2019;Not only that, but it's a great movie even without being in the comic book genre.
2020;It's a starting Batman movie the way it was meant to be done.
2021;The acting was completely and utterly spot.
2022;Hopefully, more people will show love for Gary Oldman after him aptly portraying a pre.
2023;Katie Holmes and Morgan Freeman did very well reinventing their characters and I just love how they both interacted with Bruce Wayne.
2024;Acting is all well and good, but what is it that makes this movie so special?
2025;The careful attention poured onto every shot.
2026;When you can't tell what's cg and what's real, you know you have a winner.
2027;It all seemed pretty intricate, and I liked how key lines (especially those relating to big themes) came back.
2028;David Goyer really outdid himself and so did Christopher Nolan.
2029;For the latter to top em>Memento/em> is no small feat, and yet he managed to do it right here.
2030;I loved the subtle explanations of things and the batmobile may not look as sleek as before but it's definitely more useful.
2031;The special features are accessed via a comic book, which is kind of neat, but I'd rather just have it all straightforward rather than hunt for them (though if you navigate to the last page of it you can do this also).
2032;If you enjoyed the movie I feel that this set is pretty worthwhile.
2033;Even if they were to release a super duper edition, this is really all you need to thoroughly enjoy the film.
2034;Great movie to complete my collection on Blu Ray.
2035;Seriously, with a cast like Drew Barrymore, Jim Carrey, Tommy Lee Jones, Nicole Kidman, Val Kilmer, and Kevin Grevioux (Raze of Underworld fame), how could Schumacher screw that up?
2036;i grieved the death of what could have been a terriffic franchise, and I moved on.
2037;I will give him the benefit of the doubt because he has also written some great screenplays and stories.
2038;christopher Nolan directs and kicks in his two cents' worth in the screenplay department.
2039;I liked Insomnia, but let's face it: Nothing I'd seen so far said to me that Batman Begins would even be watchable, much less entertaining.
2040;Two character actors were cast against type, but it seems to have been a brilliant choice!The effects were dynamic, and the sets and backgrounds were more than realistic.
2041;The stunts seemed to be more wire work than CGI (thankfully), lending a more believable and realistic feel to this endeavor.
2042;The thing which most impressed me about this film was the story.
2043;If the new franchise follows this first installment, it will literally BE the Dark Knight vein of the comic book series!
2044;"the nemeses in this one are Ra's Al Ghul and the Scarecrow, with a promise of meeting the Dark Knight's ""Joker"" in the next installment!This movie exhibits perfect direction from start to finish, never loses itself, never loses the audience, and with great relish fights its way through to a superb and satisfying ending."
2045;If you've read my other reviews of the other installments in this series you'll understand why.
2046;The television series entertained, as the early movies pacified my anticipation of bringing my favorite comic book hero to life.
2047;"By far, the Best ""Dark Knight"" Batman."
2048;"and with a superb supporting cast
2049;An essential element, to """"The Batman's"""" creditability."""
2050;The Dark Knight~Batman will survive.
2051;this time it tells a real,noir story.
2052;it is dark and edgy.
2053;the script is a masterpiece.
2054;the directing is as great as the sceneriowriting and the music.
2055;C. bale is the best batman ever,his voice,his standing,a perfect fit.
2056;with the great team work of the actor and the director,they not only tell the ongoing story,but also focus into the character's own soul as well.
2057;"i'm telling you,this is with no doubt the best batman movie,and there is more
2058;Just when you think that the Batman franchise was dead, in comes a new film to give the franchise a breathe of fresh air.
2059;Batman Begins takes the story of the superhero Batman right to the beginning.
2060;The first 45 minutes of the film goes into great detail to how Bruce Wayne acquired the skills that he knows as Batman through his rigorous training with Liam Neeson's character Henri Ducard.
2061;Christian Bale was an excellent choice to play Batman.
2062;His quiet intensity gave Bruce Wayne/Batman proved to be the most convincing since Michael Keaton.
2063;I found the romantic storyline a distraction in the film.
2064;Michael Keaton was excellent as the butler Alfred, and gotta love Cillian Crane/Scarecrow.
2065;I think it's obvious by now that the majority of Batman fans are declaring """"Batman Begins"""" as the best film in the franchise."""
2066;I knew very little about Christian Bale prior to seeing this movie, but I thought he did a fantastic job as Batman, while playing the superhero as well as playing Bruce Wayne.
2067;All of the supporting cast were impressive as well although Morgan Freeman was rather underused.
2068;This is a Batman film after all.
2069;memorable villain is of course The Scarecrow, and his character is definitely cool.
2070;The special effects used in his fright scenes were magnificent.
2071;I also found his character highly under.
2072;But I have high hopes for the sequel, now that we know that The Joker will be making his appearance.
2073;"but I will reiterate that ""Batman Begins"" is an all."
2074;"The PG.13 rating is very appropriate
2075;Then again, that's one of the thrills of seeing it on the big screen.
2076;All in all, a great film.
2077;this is a good movie of how Batman got started and in this day an age of technology and how he learned how to fight and fight an group of people that think the city needs to die.
2078;time Batman fan, and waited all my life for someone to make a `serious' Batman film.
2079;She comes off more as a barista.
2080;She is with the fricken DA's office!
2081;Christopher Nolan had all the money in the world to make this movie, and had plenty of time and creative control as well.
2082;Although they have inferior special effects, judged as cinema and as pieces of heroic adventure, both the 1966 `Batman, the Movie' and the 1989 `Batman' are far superior to this film.
2083;Its a good film but not perfect.
2084;The Batman film series since it began in 1989 has been on a rollercoaster ride.
2085;eight years later, and thanks to Christopher Nolan, the rollercoaster is back on the tracks and once again going full speed ahead.
2086;It's always interesting to see why a superhero becomes a superhero.
2087;That alone can place """"Batman Begins"""" amongst """"Spiderman"""" as one of the greatest comic book/superhero movies of all time."""
2088;that aside, what really gets this coaster rolling again is Nolan's vision of how a Batman movie should be.
2089;Basing the film in reality, placing Batman in a realistic Gotham City, is ingenious.
2090;"Overall, ""Batman Begins"" has made the film series more mature, aiming at an older audience with a much more serious film."
2091;Batman Begins has truly marked a revolution for the franchise.
2092;Christian Bale was perfect for this role, and Liam Neilson was terrific as always.
2093;The exotic background of bruce wayne and the story which is more character driven than it's predecessors fully emerse you in this movie.
2094;The cinematography is good and it's well directed and edited.
2095;, you can use the box to hold both the two.
2096;The latter is more of a special feature.
2097;Director Christopher Nolan is an appropriate choice for directing this franchise in that his work has, so far, been enigmatic and dark.
2098;All of this is fine except that it takes a bit too long.
2099;"It's the classic Gotham City crossed with the futuristic Los Angeles of ""Blade Runner."""
2100;It's a city with slums, skyscrapers, and elevated trains, like Chicago or New York.
2101;Of the ones that Nolan got right, Morgan Freeman does well what he knows how to do, and Rutger Hauer is laudable as a condescending corporate man with ambitions.
2102;Michael Caine is flawless as Wayne's father figure and right.
2103;The biggest surprise, however, is perennial villain Gary Oldman as Sgt. Gordon, the one honest cop in a city of crooked ones.
2104;"Wilkinson is an excellent actor (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""In the Bedroom"" both come readily to mind), but here he lays it on pretty thick."
2105;the action is good though, and there is plenty of it.
2106;It's got those dazzling moments you'll remember long after you leave the theater.
2107;"more in a way that makes you go ""hmmmm."
2108;"Overall, Batman Begins"" is a pleasure to watch, and Christian Bale inhabits his character ably and credibly."
2109;I was amazed and entertained more than I have been before from this type of genre and I have only seen a few films which are as close to perfect as this one.
2110;From the design to the acting this film is great for anyone, even if you aren't interested in comic book films.
2111;I got a great movie for a great price.
2112;All three are well worth my time.
2113;Like other reviewers have said, this Batman movie was the best ever!
2114;The main thing that I loved about the movie was the villain.
2115;I have always been a big batman fan since I was a kid.
2116;I liked the movie really much, but still.
2117;Still, there was a lot of Burtonesque cartoonish flavor about it but it was the best of the first 4 movies (of course, before this one).
2118;i was very happy to see that superhero movies could have some substance and depth to them when the Spidey series came out (Two thumbs up still for Spidey 2, which for me, was the best superhero adaptation from Hollywood, until this one came out).
2119;First of all, the great story behind Bruce Wayne and all of his motivations which led him to become his alter ego.
2120;"He's a really good actor with a very promising career and a promising franchise
2121;Not to mention the more known actors such as Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman (love his roles as the """"badguy"""", and was stunningly surprised to see him as Comm."""
2122;Gordon, but did a very good job with it).
2123;I even think that Katie Holmes did a nice job.
2124;I was a little afraid at first when I read a lot of complaint from some reviewers about the second disc menu, but I found it to be fun.
2125;"If you click on it, you finally see the whole menu in a ""regular"" or ""decent"" layout, as other reviewers may put it asking for something more ""standard""."
2126;good old standard menu for all of you.
2127;Christian Bale's version of Batman is very intimidating!
2128;The villians (Scarecrow/Ra's Al Guhl) were smartly handled well.
2129;She actually has spunk and guts.
2130;overall, all the characters in this film are very believable.
2131;For everyone else, get ready for great ride!
2132;This was everything that I wanted in a Batman movie.
2133;Great acting, action, characters and plot.
2134;Best Batman movie yet in my opinion.
2135;i saw this movie first in Galway and thought it was really good, but when I saw it a second time in Paris I found it much better than the first time.
2136;Emotional score, dramatic acting and dark to the core.
2137;And his love interest, who has the face of a 12 yr.
2138;Compare this to Maguire and Dunst in Spiderman, who rule together.
2139;When they set up a sequel in the final minutes, i could have laughed, who cares!
2140;Batman Begins is the latest in a long line of comic book movie adaptations in the last three years.
2141;"inducing toxin
2142;one of the things this movie has going for it is a strong supporting cast.
2143;Neeson is excellent as always, as Ducard, who trains Bruce during his exile.
2144;ironically, the beginning of """"Batman Begins"""" is the most interesting part."""
2145;There is real drama here, and I was prepared for more than just the average superhero movie.
2146;"Sith was sobering and touching, while ""Batman"" just makes you cringe."
2147;I am also aware that the Batman comics have always been very dark, but then, I never said I liked the Batman comics, did I?If you are a fan of the Batman franchise, this film will certainly please, with the origins of all the iconic Batman things: The mask, the Batmobile, the spotlight, and the utility belt with its amazing storage capabilities.
2148;The small touches such as the summoning of the bats using the frequency emitter was a fantastic touch.
2149;Simply because you realize that to the public, this cannot be a mortal man, but you as the viewer, having been exposed to his secrets, realize he is all to human.
2150;This is by far, the best Batman movie to date.
2151;A Batman movie should be rated 'R'.
2152;Don't misunderstand me, I liked this movie.
2153;batman Begins is a fantastic film in most ways, it's entertaining, action packed, has a good mix of chemisty with the talent, decent plot with some twists and most importantly it has ninjas.
2154;this film is dark like the original Burton films but has a better cast, plot and overall style to it.
2155;gary Oldman and Liam Neeson also add to the overall effectiveness of the plot with both actors making their roles in this film their own and adding a distinct class and style to the movie.
2156;Amazing movie, Christopher Nolan is a genius, the best Batman movie ever, i recommend thie for every Batman fan !!!
2157;What they've come up with is a brilliant comic book movie.
2158;Batman Begins is so good in fact that it even blows aways last year's excellent Spider.
2159;fetched for a superhero movie to be up for Best Picture consideration, but if ever a superhero movie had a chance, Batman Begins is certainly it.
2160;With a brilliant director like Christopher Nolan at the helm, you can't.
2161;the film explores the origins of the character and, for the first time in a Batman movie, actually gives us a plausible reason for a grown man to put on a costume and mask and fight crime.
2162;For the first time, we get a true portrait of Bruce Wayne: a haunted, bitter man who is angry at the world around him yet wants to make it better at the same time.
2163;batman Begins should certainly solidify Christopher Nolan's status as one of the finest young directors in the business today.
2164;He made a seldom seen yet impressive debut (1998's Following), followed by a crime.
2165;thriller masterpiece (2001's Memento), then a superb psychological thriller (2002's Insomnia), now he presents a stunning comic book movie to re.
2166;batman Begins was not only probably the best movie of this past summer, it is one of the best movies of the year.
2167;in my mind,Batman Begins is easily one of the best superhero movies ever made.
2168;director Christopher Nolan shows great skill as a director,pacing the film very well.
2169;there are also some touches of humour throughout and we get to see a more human side to Bruce Wayne.
2170;the movie is also more thoughtful than many movies depicting superheros.
2171;all in all a brilliant depiction of the origin of the caped crusader.
2172;liam neeson is amazing!would definately recommend!
2173;This was perhaps one of the best movies to add to our Blu ray collection.
2174;but Christopher Nolan finally got the feeling of a Batman movie right.
2175;And Christian Bale was very good as Bruce Wayne.
2176;I love all of the batman movies.
2177;batman Begins, quite literally, spends its time showing the audience just how Bruce Wayne developed his alter.
2178;He searches for something to help him and he finds it in the idea, in the concept, in the teachings of Ra's al Ghul.
2179;What follows is a heart.
2180;packed thrill ride that speaks to any fan of the Batman tradition.
2181;known villain, but he definitely was part and parcel of the comics and deserves his place in the spotlight.
2182;It is the process of overcoming the psychosis of fear that makes this film so fascinating.
2183;It, like the comic books, is something we can relate to and allows us to empathize with the characters.
2184;Through this the true story of finding one's identity and fighting fear arises.
2185;a great film for the layman and for the comic book connoisseur alike.
2186;Excellent cast, excellent SFX, excellent acting.
2187;I've been an avid Batman comic fan for years and this movie does the dark knight the most justice.
2188;Love the ending of the film.
2189;telling his dark event that made him, delving deeper into the history of wayne enterprises, giving the butler more of a character, and shows you how batman got all his cool gadjets, and taking you through the first adventures of the batman.
2190;This movie is a perfect collection to a great movie collection.
2191;Christopher nolan, director of MEMENTO, really outdoes himself in this one.
2192;The story line is captivating and the characters are awesome.
2193;I would recommend to all audience's.
2194;'the definitive Batman film', and a masterpiece, and without any second thoughts .
2195;It's story can touch anyone, since it's an origin film, and people don't need to know a thing about Batman, and still discover him in this movie.2 .
2196;"yeah, there are loads of special features, which I watched all in two to three days
2197;I thought BATMAN BEGINS was a really good movie.
2198;i thought Christian Bale did an outstanding job as Bruce Wayne and Batman.
2199;I thought he played one of the best Doc Holiday in TOMBSTONE.
2200;It kind of leads into the other Batman movie with Michael Keaton.
2201;This is just a summer blockbuster.
2202;It should at least have a little fun.
2203;batman until the end of the season.
2204;office unless you have story, character and both evolved into an interesting implication massaged by effects.
2205;old myth motif of hero """"journey,"""" meeting along the way a """"mentor"""" and learning about himself, his powers and what he must do."""
2206;This, children, is myth: it is the hero.
2207;Back they go, they have gone and they will go, to the well of mythology.
2208;Because the stories are timelessly pleasing and renewing .
2209;mill, comic book summer movie.
2210;"and the truth of what ""BB"" really is.)"
2211;The saving graces are a) the serious actors, and b) the old hero.
2212;"Michael Caine is excellent as Alfred, the paternal surrogate for Bruce Wayne's murdered father
2213;But really what makes this movie a """"need to see"""" is Christian Bale's humanizing of Bruce Wayne: that is what makes this better than a mere summer blockbuster."""
2214;Bale manages to convey a very complex individual, one easily believed as struggling amidst a sea of conflicting emotions.
2215;But that is what the best of myth .
2216;Bale makes this movie, even as a blockbuster.
2217;This was THE best movie in 2005, hands down.
2218;Christian Bale does an incredible job as Bruce Wayne and the Dark Knight, his supporters like Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine really shine, and the storyline is true to the original series.
2219;Anyone who likes good movies should watch it, even if you're not a 'comic book nut' or action fan.
2220;Batman Begins is an amazing movie and the two.
2221;disc deluxe edition is an amazing combination.
2222;Tons of great special features that give you a unique insight into Christopher Nolan and David Goyer's thoughts about Batman's story.
2223;awesome movie, if the gift set costs more than the two.
2224;I've never been a great fan of the Batman movies.
2225;although I did enjoy Jack Nicholsons' Joker.
2226;This is by far and away the best Batman movie yet.
2227;packed with so many great performances that it's a treat to watch over and over again.
2228;There is Christian Bale's pensive Bruce Wayne.
2229;Michael Caine as the intelligent save.
2230;With all this star power, the actors could have easily overpowered the movie.
2231;They finally got all their ducks in order and made a Batman movie worth watching.
2232;This motivation comes through so poignantly, which separates this film from previous others, such as Batman and Robin.
2233;star and remarkable in its own right.
2234;Katie Holmes plays Rachael, childhood friend of Wayne, and the woman who he eventually falls for.
2235;Michael Caine is exquisitely cast as the butler, Alfred, and Morgan Freeman is great as man behind the technology who works for Wayne.
2236;perhaps most refreshing is the vision and effort of the producers to take a comic.
2237;book hero and make him complex.
2238;Chris Nolan is able to take the theme of good versus evil and personify it within the characters.
2239;batman Begins is the step in the right direction for this series, and this one is on the same playing field as the original Batman.
2240;Now, I say without any hesitation that Christian Bales is by far the best Batman/Bruce Wayne so far adapted to film!
2241;"answer from ""Batman Begins:"" HE'S NOT!The origins are truly amazing and more believable in this 2nd attempt at a truly great story."
2242;I was glad to see some good actors in this movie too.
2243;i've seen almost every major movie to come out this year, and I must say that this one is the best one so far!
2244;(See my Episode 3 Review!)
2245;The production is flawless, the portrayals keep you in disbelieve all thruoghout the movie.
2246;One of the best Batman movie of all time.
2247;The story line is great, the fight are amazing and Batman B. is more realistic than the others that were made before.
2248;I am a Dark Knight freak, and this is one of the best.
2249;Thanks to the director and actors for a well done product.
2250;Christian Bale in my Opinion is the best Batman ever.
2251;this is one of the best of the batman movie series.
2252;"it is always nice to watch one of the ""beginning"" movies to get the full story of a character."
2253;the special effects are very good in this movie and i quite enjoyed them.
2254;everyone has a dark side even him that balances them as a real person, not just a one sided figure.
2255;Well made, written and acted.
2256;Best movie of 2005, best Batman film, best superhero film, best comic book adaptation.
2257;Great movie recommend everyone to see it.
2258;ray and Amazon is the place to do it.
2259;The Batman franchise is a series that can be watched over and over so this is worth the upgrade.
2260;There is hardly any flaws and the script is intriguing.
2261;eveybody by now knows the plot.
2262;Then he returns to Gotham City and finds it more corrupt than he left it.
2263;He starts to create fear among the criminal world and show them that crime does not pay.
2264;The film is filled with high caliber actors with Christian Bale as the best Batman ever and forever!!
2265;I have seen Christopher Nolan's Memento and loved that entire story as well.
2266;He is a superb writer and director who knows how to mess with our minds.
2267;this Batman movie is the best Batman movie (ranks up there with the original Superman) in terms of better writing, actors, effects, and score.
2268;if you hate it, give us a good reason why and we'll accept it.
2269;Just hating it because of the last two Batman is impulsive.
2270;First off, i love the movie itself so that made it all worth it.
2271;there is the usual town corrupted to the core, where all people are desperate or desperately evil but where a group of righteous souls still works for the greater good (taking an airplane to some more reasonable resort?)
2272;christian Bale is as intense as grated parmesan and so is Katie Holmes.
2273;The others are fairly good, each up to the not much required trying to give sense to the senseless lines they are given.
2274;Great special effects, great plot, fast moving.
2275;Great movie for the action movie lover.
2276;I would recommend it to anyone pre.
2277;I hoped that they would create a whole new transfer for the larger capacity blu.
2278;"rays, such as ""The Dark Knight""."
2279;Try to look intelligent by complaining about the film now, all of you whiners!
2280;i give it 3.5 stars.
2281;"The League of Shadows is dedicated to restoring ""balance"" to a world in which ""criminals thrive on the indulgence of society's understanding."""
2282;mobile and will meet his friends and allies for the first time that include his trusted butler who has been always more than butler but a family member, Alfred (Michael Cane), the head of the science department in his corporation, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman plays a combination of God and Q) who can or have already invented anything, and honest police officer, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman is very believable in his rare good.
2283;He also has the best quote in the movie.
2284;"Directed by a very talented master of dark and atmospheric films with deep and interesting characters, Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins"" is gripping and emotional adventure which is equally interesting for the viewers of all ages and backgrounds."
2285;This movie is truly amazing and is never dull.
2286;I have seen this film many times and it is just as fresh and just as exciting as it was when I watched it for the first time.
2287;Cillian Murphey was also the perfect choice for Scarecrow.
2288;Every single person owes it to themselves to see this movie.
2289;One of the best movies of last year.
2290;Christian Bale is a very good actor.
2291;love it in wide screen blu.
2292;If you can get this and Dark Knight both, do it.
2293;It will make for one fantastic movie watching experience.
2294;I loved him because he was an ordinary human.
2295;this is a great movie.
2296;i would recommend this movie to any who enjoys a good movie.
2297;great movie just watching or testing your surround sound
2298;Having a great foundation stemming from the awesome film that embodies the core of this limited edition set, there is just so much to enjoy.
2299;I have ordered this exact option from Amazon twice and both times it was incorrect.
2300;Come on I ordered it twice.
2301;It successfully tells how Batman was created and of Bruce Wayne's internal struggle with his alter ego.
2302;And, the story moves along quite nicely while keeping the movie within the realm of reality.
2303;If you are looking for a Batman movie that will entertain you from beginning to end, you've found it!
2304;Catch it again, and you'll be reminded of its excellence!
2305;Forget all of the other Batman movies because this is the definitive one.
2306;and a great story and a better director.
2307;it's a little long towards the end,but still very good.
2308;Chris and Chris make a great pair!
2309;Christopher Nolan, director, does a great job in this film.
2310;Christian Bale, actor, complements him perfectly.
2311;He was the right pick for the role.
2312;This movie definitely makes my Top 100!
2313;October is a magnificent month, and in celebration of its annual visit, I've decided to review a few great flicks for the Halloween season.
2314;not the classics that generally spring to mind, but fun movies with elements of the supernatural.
2315;Just good, lighthearted stuff here.
2316;Batman Begins is an exceptional movie, no matter how you want to judge it.
2317;What I particularly loved about it was how it gave a credible origin to the legend of Batman.
2318;Wayne's training in a remote sanctuary of ninjas, as he slowly acquires his remarkable skills, is fascinating and engaging.
2319;ray, and it is a treat for the eyes to witness this legendary character's origins.
2320;"and let's not forget, ""Batman Begins"" works perfectly as an ""alternative"" Halloween movie, as this crisp October weather rolls in."
2321;"the story of ""Batman Begins"" will draw you in from the first moments, and hold your attention until the final, climactic battle."
2322;"I have seen every Batman movie, from the Adam West ""BAM"" romps of the 60s to George Clooney's impersonation of the American Detective, and feel that Christian Bale's Batman is the best."
2323;Bale is quite an underrated actor.
2324;From the Empire of the Sun, American Psycho, Reign of Fire, Equilibrium, to Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Bale has done a superb job in each film.
2325;one of the more memorable scenes in Batman Begins include the Tumbler chase scene.
2326;"The Tumbler is a welcome change from the more traditional representations of the ""Batmobile"" and looks more like a candidate for the next military tactical vehicle than a superhero's car."
2327;i look forward to viewing The Dark Knight as many of the trailers show a similar amount of professional acting and a solid plot.
2328;A friend of mine, that is a psychiatrist, suggested that I watch this film.
2329;At first I thought it an odd suggestion, for, we had previously discussed films, but he was adamant that I watch this one in particular.
2330;"this movie not only filled in the background story with the Batman series
2331;there are parts of this film that really and truly reach in and pull at your guts.
2332;There were a few times that I was actually brought to tears watching this film.
2333;I however thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to everyone.
2334;The movie review is important, yes.
2335;For anyone who wants to know more about the weapons, new batsuit, or the Tumbler (the wicked new spin on the Bat Mobile) will deffinately get a kick out of these features.
2336;The subtle gem of the special features is the """"Tankman Begins"""" skit performed by Jimmy Fallon as a prequisite to the MTV movie awards."""
2337;It is pretty hilarious and reminds me of the famous Oscar Skit Billy Crystal put together back in the day.
2338;the movie itself is great.
2339;Fear is actually the main villain.
2340;I personnaly feel that this movie captures the essence of Batman while its predessecors were to bright or cheerful.
2341;I am highly interested to see if Robin will be brought into the picture as well as Batgirl.
2342;he is now the face of Batman and he is the perfect fit.
2343;the sound is great with surround sound.
2344;The movie alone delivers the goods.
2345;I wouldn't call myself a hardcore follower of Batman, but I'd still say I was a pretty big fan.
2346;Batman was the first superhero I can remember hearing about.
2347;In the world of comics, particularly DC comics with all its retcons and reimaginings, could there really be anything that could be honestly considered true to Batman's origins?
2348;Plus, I heard that it was pretty serious, with humourous moments few and far between.
2349;Eventually though, curiousity got the better of me, and I faced these fears and watched the film.
2350;I'm glad it did, Batman Begins is pretty good.
2351;With his wealth, his access to high tech equipment, and a little bit of help from old Alfred, Bruce becomes Batman, and just in time too.
2352;Batman's look is a little rougher that we've seen in the Burton films, but that's understandable, as Bruce Wayne's just starting out.
2353;He also looks more like an animal in the suit than anyone before, I think, which is interesting.
2354;Batman's scariness is emphasized quite a lot, actually, especially when he works with villains.
2355;Michael Keaton's still my favorite on screen Batman, but Bale is now my favorite Bruce Wayne.
2356;He plays unmasked Bruce as two distinct personaes, the decadent gadabout in public, and the brooding but driven soul in private.
2357;This Batman leads a triple life, which I thought was a fascinating concept.
2358;Gary Oldman was a great Jim Gordon.
2359;i think director Christopher Nolan is onto something with this rethink/reboot, and the sequels could be really something special.
2360;Just have to wait and see how it goes.
2361;I do hope we get to see the Joker next!The special features disc is rather unique.
2362;It's menus are set up like a comic strip, depicting a scene of the movie featuring Batman and Scarecrow.
2363;Pressing enter on these comic elements will take you to a special feature, be it a behind the scenes featurette or a data file on a weapon, hero or villain.
2364;Locations, models, sets, actors, writers.
2365;definitely worth a look for fans of Batman, whatever the era, whatever the medium.
2366;Not my favorite, but its fairly high up there.
2367;The movie provides not only action and a hero with humanity and human failings but it gives one food for thought.
2368;My wife and I really enjoyed this movie.
2369;There are countless other female actresses that could have played that role better.
2370;Try as we did to suspend disbelief and give her a chance to play her character in the dramatic scenes.
2371;On a more positive note.
2372;All the other characters and actors were superb.
2373;I think this is the best Batman ever!!!
2374;even better than the Dark Knight.
2375;fast shipment thank you Amazon!!!
2376;A real super hero movie, real man with no super powers!!!
2377;Great beginning to an amazing trilogy!!
2378;If you like movies based on comics, well this movie is for you!
2379;Batman is a thread in the fabric of everyday life in the U. s.
2380;He has no super human powers.
2381;with a iron steel will and fortitude that is quite oftem more strong and resourceful than any of those displayed by the super humans elsewhere written about in comics.
2382;batman Begins takes us on a journey as described in the Dark Knight comic series.
2383;"Even the ""super villain"" of the film is one that is truly grounded in reality: he's not super at all ."
2384;the Scarecrow has always been one of my favorite villains, because he is so truly believable.
2385;batman Begins is a drama at its heart.
2386;It is an action film in its soul.
2387;And it is a super hero film in name only.
2388;Batman Begins could be a Jackie Chan film, Clint Eastwood, or film of some similar genre.
2389;It falls not too far afield of reality and in doing so builds believability and stregnth.
2390;Bale is known to many for his thoughtful and intense portrayals in lesser known Hollywood and independent films.
2391;"alfred, the dutiful butler is played by Michael Caine (not overacting or lazy as he can often be)
2392;Detective Gordon (who later becomes Commissioner Gordon) is underplayed wonderfully by the incredible Gary Oldman.
2393;Rounding out this impressive cast are Katie Holmes (who is quite good and who's character is actually allowed to exist beyond mere window dressing) as Batman's childhood girlfriend"
2394;"Borrowing heavily from the superb ""Batman: Year One"", we finally understand how a scarred child like Bruce Wayne can become this seemingly unstoppable superhuman legend such as Batman, The Dark Knight."
2395;Nolan spends about 50% of the movie taking us on that journey, and it is a journey well worth taking.
2396;those of you looking for constant action in the cape will be somewhat disappointed, but this origin story is extremely well told.
2397;Once again, it is proven that even in a superhero movie, a good story well told is worth more than a billion in special effects.
2398;It has everything: great actors, story, cinematography.
2399;And the fantastic score by Hans Zimmer is the linchpin that ties it all together.
2400;The perfect movie, which then ties into the Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises, which are both equally great!
2401;Can't recommend these movies enough.
2402;Kids and I really enjoyed this movie!
2403;Batman is a great movie.
2404;It fit perfect into our collection.
2405;It was a good movie.
2406;ACTION PACKED and loved seeing all of the seasoned actors.
2407;These same characteristics are brilliantly reflected in Christian Bale's portrayal of Bruce Wayne.
2408;katie Holmes was brilliant as Bruce Wayne's long time yet not quite fulfilled love interest.
2409;Both share a passion for fighting injustice, but is there time to lay aside duty for a moment to be with each other?Overall, a very good film with a very real human element.
2410;The best Batman version to date.
2411;with body armor,and supplies Wayne's foundation developed.
2412;not a perfect movie,but close enough and is worth the ride.
2413;If you can still see Batman Begins at an IMAX.
2414;It makes the movie at least ten times better, if that is even possible.
2415;Watching this movie with the rumble in the seats, over 10,000 watts of glorious sound, and a screen 4,500 times larger than the average TV is mind.
2416;Its worth the extra eight dollars for the experience.
2417;Batman is the best superhero of all time and now has the greatest superhero movie to forever guarantee that verity.
2418;It makes Kilmer's/Clooney's versions look good and Keaton's looks like masterpieces!
2419;It tells the gripping story of Bruce Wayne in a unuiqe and emotional way.3.
2420;Great actors, great props, great music, great special effects.4 The plot line is scary though, espeacially Dr. Crane's mask.5.
2421;Initiation:This is a movie with some seriously gritty action.
2422;It begins with Bruce Wayne as a child and his first up close encounter with bats.
2423;the Missing Link:This movie provides the missing link, the element that transforms a scared young boy into a fearless force for justice.
2424;conclusion:Excellent movie, lots of action.
2425;This is a very impressive and well.
2426;structured cinematic rework of Batman's origins.
2427;The cast is first rate.
2428;Christian Bale's performance is impressive adding a dimension of emotion to the stoic side of the character.
2429;Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score for BATMAN BEGINS is mesmerizing and quite moving.
2430;There is a lot of pent up emotion, energy and haunting beauty just waiting to explode.
2431;It examines a meaningful nature of the character and his motivations augmenting Christian Bale's dedicated performance perfectly.
2432;The plot is also very solid.
2433;When I think of how the origin of Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) was interwoven into the film, I was impressed.
2434;This Batman film succeeds on every level.
2435;Great lines, actors, and action.
2436;Christian Bale playing Batman is one of the best Batmans ever.
2437;Great acting and great effects too.
2438;With a corrupt city it's up to Bruce to find a symbol.
2439;Great movie overall and great action.
2440;It's one of my favorite movies and if your a batman fan or not, you won't be dissapointed.
2441;batman Begins is filled with action and great acting.
2442;we get perfect performences by the actors.
2443;christian Bale is the best Batman I've seen yet.
2444;this is the best Batman movie out there so if you liked Batman the movie you will love Batman Begins.
2445;And in no time at all that bag of unjustified prejudices began to fill with applause for a truly fine film that carries style, wit, character, and enough dazzle to please everyone.
2446;This is a surprising good movie!It takes courage to move a larger than life fantasy hero into the realm of humans who through reasons of their own feel the need to become superheroes to the down and outers of the world.
2447;Watching the early life of Batman as produced and trained and stimulated by believable characters makes the non.
2448;The costumes and cinematography are exciting and the direction by Christopher Nolan is pitch perfect.
2449;Maybe there will be more action hero movies that take themselves seriously as an art form!
2450;"Bale is somewhat underrated, he's appeared in some good movies and some stinkers but this movie interviews he did for ""Batman Begins"" on Access Hollywood, I knew he could do He was sincere and serious about making a good impression and he did on them some."
2451;He underwent some serious training to get into the role and it definitely shows on screen.
2452;bale did an excellent job!!!
2453;enter Katie Holmes who plays Rachel Dawes , Waynes love interest and Batman's love interest, a good girl being caught in some bad company.
2454;"director Christopher Nolan not only deserves a pat on the back for his excellent adaptation of the comic book character but a hug from every comic book fan whose been wanting a respectable version of the ""Dark Knight"" for quite some time."
2455;this movie had heart, it was gritty, it was dramatic, and Batman wasn't a stupid a cartoon cutout like George Clooney's stupid portrayal but he was a man, a real man with real problems and issues, and above you liked it, you really him We sympathized with Bale's portrayal as Wayne, and we cheer as he goes through his whole training until he becomes the Dark Knight and imprints his legacy as the defender of justice and truth.
2456;go see it now and enjoy!!!!
2457;It took a long 8 years but it was worth the wait.
2458;It's awesome to see Bruce evolve into the Batman right before our eyes and finally establish himself as the saviour of gotham.
2459;I have been a fan of Batman for years.
2460;I really enjoyed the Dark Knight resurrection of the 80s, which has been the focus of the entire Batman franchise.
2461;On the whole, I have enjoyed most of the films.
2462;He is also cool and calculating, taking time to study the criminal element, even to the point of getting arrested to learn more.
2463;what is good about the film:* Very good back story that adds a lot of depth to Bruce Wayne's character* Nice effects kept realistic.
2464;While there are some fantasy eleemnts, the story is kept in the realm of believable.
2465;* Realistic presentation of a human superhero.
2466;the plane scene comes to mind* Katie Holmes .
2467;shoes, but I found Jim Gordon far more realistic.
2468;I recommend this good Batman film.
2469;This movie is so awesome!I am a huge Batman fan and this film really makes up forall of the bad Batman films before this one.
2470;to start off the directing was brilliant it was filmed excellently.
2471;christopher Nolan deserves at least an Oscar Nomination for his job.
2472;and the way he filmed the fight scenes was exciting and kept you on the edge of your seat the whole fight.
2473;it had enough twists and turns to keep you on your seat on all times.
2474;and I loved its focus on story and character development.
2475;i also loved the way that they didn't have one major villian,they had two or three minor villians which worked excellently.
2476;and the acting was top notch.
2477;christian Bale is the definitive Batman.
2478;and Michael Caine,Gary Oldman,Liam Neeson,Katie Holmes,Morgan Freeman,and Cillian Murphy all delivered some of their best performances I have seen.
2479;the production of it was also real top notch.
2480;the set and prop design was fantastic,it made you feel as if you were watching the comic.
2481;and the new batsuit and batmobile were really cool!And to top it off this score was fantastic.
2482;right from the start it established the mood and atmosphere of the film.
2483;all in all this movie was superb.
2484;it definitely gets my vote as one of the best movies of all time!!!!!!
2485;I'll start off by saying that I love the orignal Batman and Batman Forever but Batman Begins is better.
2486;This movie is really the first real attempt to make batman work in the real world.
2487;"This movie definitely makes up for the atrocity that is ""Batman and Robin."""
2488;"Although ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" were excellent movies, this movie is excellent in a completely contrasting way."
2489;Instead of jumping right into the bad guy of the moment, this movie makes the effort to set up the back story of Bruce Wayne, which is well worth it.
2490;interesting and dark, and not at all cheesy.
2491;Normally I'd try to write something literal and cohesive to describe the assets of movie I appreciated seeing.
2492;It's been years since an action movie elicited this kind of excitment from me and it feels great.
2493;Go see it right now.
2494;As a lifelong Batman fan, at 36 I can say that Batman has finally been captured on film.
2495;There's one Batman, and his name is Christian Bale.
2496;"There's one Batman movie, and it's called ""Batman Begins."""
2497;Bought as a gift, great movie.
2498;The start of a fantastic series of films.
2499;If you are a batman fan this is the movie to see.
2500;"the script was approved by DC comics and therefore holds more truth to the original story than the ""Batman"" movies before it."
2501;Christian Bale was a really great casting choice as he has the duality to play both the suave Bruce Wayne and the haunted Batman.
2502;Micheal Caine, Liam Neeson, and Morgan Freeman played their characters with the great skill that we've come to expect from these legendary actors.
2503;Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Dr. Jonathan Crane was amazing and complex.
2504;I look forward to the next movie in this remarkable new series.
2505;heck, even the Scarecrow is really scary in the film.
2506;Trust me, this one is great.
2507;"Christopher Nolan (""Memento"") takes the helm for the latest entry in the successful (""Fading,"" my a., though I haven't seen ""Batman Returns"" or ""Batman Forever"") franchise, steering it away from the first 4 movies, thus re."
2508;inventing the Dark Knight for a new generation.
2509;The acting was excellent on all levels (Oscar.

2511;"time ""Batman"" staple Albert, the butler, providing the comic relief when neccessary)."
2512;"known as the love interest in ""Dawson's Creek"") does a great job as Bruce Wayne's love interest, aside from being another pretty face."
2513;"Christian Bale (the little boy in Steven Spielberg's ""Empire Of The Sun"" and the ""Boy"" in Kenneth Branagh's ""Henry V"" [see my review on it]) has come a long way since then, turning in a ferocious, yet completely believable, performance as Bruce Wayne."

2515;degree turn, bring up the supporting cast.
2516;"fore uncharted reasons that drove Bruce to becoming ""The Dark Knight."""
2517;They finally got Batman right.
2518;The story is very well told and kept me engaged throughout.
2519;this isn't just a good comic book movie, this is a good movie period.
2520;There's a plot to keep you riveted and plenty of action too.
2521;it's the best Batman movie because it's a story with a comic book hero in it and not a comic book story on the screen.
2522;Read the comics and graphic novels.
2523;Quite frankly, I was blown away and thought it was easily the best of the Batman movies.
2524;All of the major players are in top form.
2525;Bale and Caine are very natural together, and Oldman was a great choice to play a your Gordon.
2526;Under Christopher Nolan's deft direction, I am certain the movie will be great.
2527;I always thought that Spiderman II was far superior to Spiderman.
2528;If the sequel to Batman Begins tops this one, we are in for an exceptional treat.
2529;This was an excellent movie.
2530;What makes a hero movie is faithfulness.
2531;How does he become Batman?With a deep root in Long Halloween, a nod to Frank's Year One, and zealous direction that chooses realism over cartoon.
2532;For longtime fans of the character of Batman, this is the film that most gets it.
2533;it was a worthy effort, Nolan gets the character right.
2534;in short, a great comic movie for any fan
2535;Bale buries himself in the role, and is the best Caped Crusader to ever play the role.
2536;with Bale, Holmes, and an incredible allstar supporting cast (Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldham) who combine for 3 Oscars and another 8 nominations, this is easily the Best Batman film to date, and possibly the best comic book film ever.
2537;From movie serials in the 40's, to a classic campy TV show in the 60's, to a solid animated series in the 90's, fans have thrilled to the super heroics of this unique character.
2538;top villains of past films.
2539;Nolan also bases the film in a strong semblance of reality that allows the audience to not only accept the possibility of the winged vigilante, but embrace it as well.
2540;from the top on down, this film is blessed with a solid cast that adds wonderfully to Nolan's vision.
2541;This is a Batman that you not only fear, but can relate to as well.
2542;In fact, he turns in the definitive performance.
2543;Michael Caine adds warmth and humor as Wayne's trusty butler, Alfred.
2544;Liam Neeson does a great variation of his usual mentor roles as Ducard, a man with his own surprising secret.
2545;As an assistant DA and Wayne's childhood friend, Katie Holmes does a nice job with what is basically a thankless role.
2546;Cillian Murphy makes for a perfectly creepy Scarecrow, while Morgan Freeman is solid as usual as the man who provides Batman's wondrous car and gadgets.
2547;Gary Oldman is wonderfully cast against type as Jim Gordon, one of Gotham's few honest cops.
2548;like Batmobile is a sheer delight.
2549;the screenplay by Nolan and David Goyer (who wrote the BLADE films) is awash with characterization and motivation.
2550;in the end, Nolan and his superb cast and crew succeed in achieving what was once thought impossible: the resurrection of a film franchise that, if not dead, was at least on life support.
2551;As a result, Batman is once again flying high and BATMAN BEGINS is a film that I wholeheartedly recommend.
2552;"Batman Begins is an interesting movie not only because of its storyline, which adopts a more ""real and crude"", free of villains in disguise approach than the so. called anthology (Batman: The Motion Picture Anthology 1989.1997 (Batman / Batman Returns / Batman Forever / Batman and Robin) (Two."
2553;"by following a logical reasoning, one can easily tell that ""Batman Begins"" should be the first movie of the series and it's sad that it came so late."
2554;Looking on the bright side, it was good that this movie was produced last, taking advantage of greater and better special effects available today.
2555;"People who are now being introduced to the ""Batworld"" can make a choice and watch the ""Fourlogy"" starting with this one."
2556;This is pretty much the greatest comic book adaption ever made!Batman Begins is an epic!The story is so great!The acting is top.
2557;notch!This is as close to the comic book as you can get.
2558;christopher Nolan did a excellent job at actually capturing the myth and personality of Batman on film.
2559;all the actors play their parts extremely well,as if they were born for the roles!Batman Begins is an instant classic film,that no doubt will be talked about and remembered for years to come.
2560;if you havent bought this movie already,I advise that you add it to your collection!It is truly a must have!
2561;Great movie love the batman series all of the movies have there own special feel to them no matter who plays batman the movies are still fun to watch.
2562;The beginning of the great Dark Knight trilogy.
2563;This movie is amazing especially Ra's Al Ghul as Liam Neeson his acting was spectacular and Christian Bale is the BATMAN.
2564;Christian Bale is perfectly cast as the Dark Knight and is easily the best Batman there has been.
2565;"Liam Neeson (Ducard) is excellent as the sensei/villian, and Katie Holmes (Rachel Dawes) brings her ""girl next door"" charm as the love interest."
2566;So, I'm a huge superhero fan, and Batman is right up my alley.
2567;His story is a little bit darker than most, but Christian Bale makes an excellent performance of the Bruce Wayne/Batman character.
2568;But the story is excellent.
2569;Good movie at a fair price and obviously a must have on your list, if you enjoy Si.
2570;Only the best action movie I've EVER seen .
2571;and significantly raises the bar for the fantasy genre.
2572;Of the three latest Batman flicks, this one is probably the most visually interesting.
2573;booky feeling (good examples are Superman and The Crow) that I prefer in movies of this genre.
2574;Overall, it was entertaining, but I won't be watching it a second time.
2575;The special features are awesome and the little comic and script from The Dark Knight, simply wonderful.
2576;The hologram on the cover is freaking great.
2577;Batman Begins tells the story of how Bruce Wayne ended up becoming the Dark Knight.
2578;We see his training, and learn what inspires him to fight for justice.
2579;Christian Bale is perfect casting, and is the best Batman to ever grace the screen.
2580;Michael Caine is a brilliant Alfred with a great sense of humor, Morgan Freeman is brilliant in his supporting role, Katie Holmes is great as Bruce's love interest, and Cillian Murphy is effectively creepy as the Scarecrow.
2581;This Batman brings everything you wanted to see to the screen, and I will be first in line for the sequel.
2582;After leaving the theather, I was one happy guy.
2583;The next two were absolutely horrid and now this one is absolutely fantastic.
2584;The acting is superb with an exceptional performance by Christian Bale as Batman.
2585;He IS the best batman.
2586;Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Liam Neeson are superb as usual while Katie Holmes does a nice job.
2587;Cilian Murphy is perfect as Scarecrow and the mask he uses is great.
2588;The movie is good because it first introduces Batman and his training with Liam Neeson.
2589;The lines pronounced by Liam Neeson are fantastic and it shows Batman's great fear of bats.
2590;I loved the new Hummer like Batmobile and when Bale was Batman, it was perfect.
2591;If you don't like Batman, you should still watch it as it is one of the year's best films.
2592;If you are a true Batman fan, it will be by far one of your favorite movies.
2593;This is the Batamn that I've been waiting for and it isn't just good, it's one of the best movies that I've seen.
2594;Christian Bale is excellent as the pre.
2595;Michael Caine as the butler is sharp and plays a greater role in guiding the younger Bruce Wayne.
2596;He reveals himself only to a childhood girl friend, played sweetly by Katie Holmes.
2597;Bale glides confidently through the special effects, lending realism to the impossible.
2598;Christopher Nolan (Memento) was able to round off the mythic seeds according an original perspective about this famous fiction character.
2599;The nocturnal environment, recreating the Baroque Post.
2600;A dark and gritty fairy tale that is wholly grounded in the real world, this extreemly well written, well acted, and expertly directed tale of a true human icon shines above all in it's field and most in it's medium.
2601;BALE is uncompromising as a tough and realistic Dark Knight.
2602;The character tics he gives BRUCE WAYNE and his alter ego are great.
2603;Every character in this epic is expertly fleshed out and superbly acted by a stellar dream cast.
2604;The second hero in this story is director CHRISTOPHER NOLAN, who brought this masterpiece in early and underbudget.
2605;I was glad to be wrong, this baby is packed with the kind of kinetic action that leaves you panting with an adrenalin enduced high.
2606;The TUMBLER is, simply put, kick ass.
2607;The sequence is down right supercool.
2608;I love watching this movie and having the trilogy.
2609;I would recommend this movie to family and friends.
2610;Quite a bit darker than the others but enjoy it.
2611;Batman Begins definitely creates a new story line and creative resurrection of the D. c. Comic character.
2612;The movie starts out with quite a bit of action.
2613;The fight scenes are laid out very well and will keep the viewer's attention for definitely the first 30 minutes of the movie.
2614;Despite all of this I still think that if you enjoy Batman as a comic book character or from the previous movies or shows this movie is positively satisfying.
2615;the service was very good.
2616;fast delivery and product was new as promised.
2617;This is the best superhero movie ever made, and I have seen them all.
2618;this and Batman (1989) are the only movies of batman worth seeing.
2619;"The Joel Schumacher renditions are utter CRAP!As Christian Bale said when getting an award for his role in Batman Begins ""It is great that Chris [Nolan] has finally brounght back some DIGNITY to the greatest superhero of all time."""
2620;"this movies is totally amazing, I can't wait to see ""The dark Knight"", whcih began filming this month (March), and will be out next year."
2621;i have no doubt it will be amazing, just as this film is.
2622;Doubtless, Nolan has reinvigorated the Batman franchise.
2623;Warner Brothers gambled on this production and was hugely successful.
2624;Who knows if Nolan will continue to direct but doubtless Caine, Freeman, and Bale will continue to play their roles.
2625;They've been given very good scripts, very good characters, and guaranteed box office.
2626;nolan has shown us how a such a movie can be successful.
2627;What will be interesting to see is if Hollywood can tear itself away from the setting of the comic book world and begin to explore new concepts in speculative settings that don't have agendas, scripts, and characters ready.
2628;wHO SHOULD SEEThe box office take for this movie was wildly successful.
2629;Fans of Burton's first Batman film who felt rather lost and abandoned in the subsequent three films will find the return to roots and adult plotting refreshing.
2630;Movie audiences that relish psychological conflict as much as they relish physical conflict will find a great deal within this movie that will excite their craving for suspense.
2631;A suspension of some disbelief is required despite Nolan's efforts at creating realistic spectacle.
2632;This is precisely true because the characters are symbolic and the themes are familiar archetypes.
2633;It is a comic book movie done exceptionally well but still a comic book movie.
2634;(The excellent animated series did deal with the subject to a small extent.)
2635;Of course Caine did a great job with the role .
2636;Christian Bale did as good as anybody as Bruce Wayne, though Michael Keaton was my favorite Bruce Wayne.
2637;the one interesting thing was that it showed Jim Gordon in his pre.
2638;in short, the acting was great .
2639;in addition to Caine there are great performances by Liam Neeson (who I didn't recognize), Rutger Hauer, and Morgan Freeman.
2640;The special effects were more spectacular than in the previous movies.
2641;packed, well acted and very entertaining.
2642;The process by which Batman created himself with special effects and psychology is intriguing.
2643;Great movie to start Nolan's trilogy.
2644;It's definitely the best Batman film released hands down.
2645;Remember Batman and Robin, the self.
2646;Bale's portrayal of Batman is my favorite so far with Keaton's close second.
2647;Katie Holmes is good but does account for much of the cheese in the film.
2648;All in all, performances are solid and you do feel for the characters, which is very important to me.
2649;the movie covers so many story lines from the childhood times to the rebellion times to the rising times of Batman with great fluidity.
2650;The plot is very plausible and the special effects are outstanding.
2651;Excellent movie one of the best.
2652;I'm a huge fan of the first Tim Burton Batman movie of the 90s.
2653;anyway, Batman Begins completely takes away the cheese of the other batman sequels and starts anew with an amazing cast, director, and story.
2654;Christian Bale has always been one of my favorite actors, ever since seeing him in the criminally underated Equilibrium (see it!)
2655;His performance as both batman and Bruce Wayne is spot on.
2656;the villains in this movie were great as well.
2657;i hold high expectations for this summer's sequel The Dark Knight, which by the way, is a great graphic novel (but not what the movie is based on, unfortunately).
2658;One of my favorite movies, ever!
2659;I already have the trilogy, and its worth it!
2660;A must for a home collection!
2661;Incredible performances all around and a fantastic trilogy.
2662;When I saw Batman Forever and Batman and Robin,I wanted to throw myself out the window knowing that Jerry Bruckheimer killed the Batman legacy in the movies (espicially with Batman being my favorite superhero and idol).
2663;and finally with there being upcoming sequels to Batman Begins and a great visionary director, high talented crew, and a cast more than fit for Batman.
2664;A role he will never be able to escape, in my opinion.
2665;He was predominately a comedic actor.
2666;But he made it work.
2667;He understood the balance and the difference between Bruce Wayne and Batman.
2668;I give this film a 4 star rating it is good but not great.
2669;When they finally show Wayne becoming Batman and starting to battle is when this movie gets good.
2670;if you are a batman fan you will love this movie becuase we finally get to see the backstory of batman.
2671;I got some serious heat when I reviewed that movie.
2672;Batman Returns was, in my opinion, the closest that the Warner Bros.
2673;Batman series came to making a great Batman movie.
2674;Batman and Robin was admittedly a fiasco, but I actually enjoy watching that movie.
2675;Batman Begins was at the time the best Batman movie by far, and is still one of the best superhero comic book movies I have ever seen in my life.
2676;It erased those movies from my mind and showed me what Batman really looks like on the big screen.
2677;This movie abandons the continuity of the previous series, and starts a whole new story line from scratch.
2678;This was definitely a wise choice.
2679;It was probably a wise choice not to put Batman's origin and the Joker in the same movie, mainly because the Joker is more interesting than Batman.
2680;No matter how you play the Joker, he is always going to steal the show away from Batman in any film.
2681;Except it was okay in this instance, because this movie is centered on Batman.
2682;The movie starts with Bruce Wayne in a Chinese prison, a man who has pretty much lost his way.
2683;Bruce returns to Gotham to implement his training.
2684;This is one of the defining attributes of Batman.
2685;let me get into the casting.
2686;After seeing him on Angel, I think he was born for the role.
2687;I know some people prefer Keaton, and I kind of understand why.
2688;Christian Bale is the first guy who could successfully play both Batman and Bruce Wayne.
2689;My argument is, it scares the crud out of the bad guys, and that's kind of his main purpose in being Batman, striking fear into the hearts of criminals.
2690;Bale also is great at beating up the bad guys.
2691;Very advanced martial arts like that is pretty hard to see, even in real life.
2692;Of all the Batman movies, I thought this one did the best as far as choreographing the action scenes.
2693;just about all of the other cast members were perfect in their roles.
2694;After Batman and Robin, I'm surprised they got so many big names in the movie.
2695;Morgan Freeman is brilliant as always, in his performance of Lucious Fox, Bruce Wayne's business manager.
2696;Michael Caine was perfect for the role of Alfred, Bruce's butler/father figure.
2697;Cillian Murphy was great as the Scarecrow.
2698;They hit on his obsession with the mind and it's power over the body, and his obsession with fear.
2699;In my opinion, Gary Oldman is the best actor in this movie.
2700;He completely disappeared into his role.
2701;He even made himself look like the drawing of Gordon in Year One.
2702;righteous, and she got on my nerves.
2703;She wasn't horrible, but she is definitely the weakest link in a long line of excellent performances.
2704;overall, this is not just a great superhero movie, it is a great movie period.
2705;I think this is far better than the four previous Batman movies combined.
2706;This was possibly the best comic book movie of all time for a while, until it was topped by the Dark Knight three years later.
2707;Director Nolan and his team have adopted a swift.
2708;flashes from one thought to another, often as if in a dream.
2709;which is highly appropriate to the tone of the film they made.
2710;It's a joy to watch.
2711;the movie has tons of things to recommend it (and it's got a superb turn from the always.
2712;together creates an environment of freshness and unpredictability: a tough feat when you consider how well.
2713;It's a wonder anybody could take a hot, high.
2714;stakes property like this, and manage to make it new.
2715;never really thought even the Tim Burton original mined the richness of the material properly.)
2716;Check out that amazing editing.
2717;This is a good movie to see if you want to understand the whole trilogy, but I wouldn't see it's mandatory.
2718;Dark Knight is the best of the three in my (and most people's) opinion.
2719;If you have time to watch the whole series, I do recommend you watch this but I will say it is the least action packed of the three.
2720;Batman Begins succeeds on many levels.
2721;It provides a wide range of fully realized settings.
2722;It guves us a satisfying drama, fleshing out the origins of Bruce Wayne until he became Batman.
2723;It is filled many good acting performances, large and small.
2724;And overall, Christopher Nolan made a lot of smart choices in theme and tone, making this version of Batman much more resonant than any other version.
2725;in the final analysis, Batman Begins will be remembered for the performances of Christian Bale, Cillian Murphy, and the fine ensemble supporting cast.
2726;And it should also be remembered for its emphaisis on primal fear as the compelling theme for the story.
2727;Batman also uses fear as a main weapon.
2728;Christian Bale delivers a wonderful performance because he demonstrates three distinct personas.
2729;The first is Bruce Wayne, from scared little boy, to angry young man, to seeker of justice and revenge.
2730;And the third is Batman.
2731;Bale's is a performance inside a performance, and I think that is pretty cool.
2732;It would have served the action better to cut out the car chase and improved the hand.
2733;And instead of showing how Batman learned to fly, show us a little bit more of Batman as detective.
2734;That would have been more apealing: a Batman who is both smart and able to beat up criminals.
2735;all in all, this was a good movie, regardless of whether you have now, or have enjoyed comic books, or their movie adaptations.
2736;beat (in a good way), if not completely perfect.
2737;After a certain number of films about and with Batman and his adventures, the saga felt the need to have an origin, a beginning, and a prequel came out of the box.
2738;This prequel really has all the necessary qualities to make it interesting, plus a few extra kicks.
2739;As for that the film is superb and the special effects are so special they nearly look natural though abnormal.
2740;And a few other goodies, if you read between the lines and behind the punctuation.
2741;The first Batman movie was great and then Returns was pretty good but then Forever and Batman and Robin sucked.
2742;The movie was great the acting was good the directing was good almost everything about this movie was good.
2743;I liked Micheal Cane and Morgan Freeman alot to great actors and they where relyl good in this.
2744;This is the most satisfying of the Batman movies.
2745;This Batman has a great script, plenty of action and terrific acting.
2746;Even though many of the parts seemed minor, each actor makes their presence felt.
2747;They make this the most realistic of the Batman movies.
2748;high marks for the director, Tim Nolan who got these wonderful performances from these excellent actors.
2749;"In a good ""period"" piece, the director develops his characters slowly
2750;Nolan manages to create this struggle in his characters and at the same time keep the action level high.
2751;the plot is far more intricate than other Batman movies too"
2752;Gotham is dark and forboding and the Batman is tough and sober about his mission.
2753;side note: the chase scene is probably the best I have ever seen.
2754;Great product (bought as a gift for my daughter) and wonderful customer service.
2755;Batman Begins takes the franchise out of the realm of cartoons and puts it back where it began and belongs, in the world of dark comics.
2756;Batman Begins has much to say on the theme of good versus evil and justice versus vengeance.
2757;And it make its points without a moment of preachiness to mar the story.
2758;While these movies have gone on to becoming blockbusters, comic book fans (like myself) have often complained about the story.
2759;batman Begins is one of the few exceptions as the story not only grips you to your seat hanging on every word, but blowing your mind by the visual effects.
2760;Every scene is crisp and makes you feel like a participant of the movie.
2761;winged hero better than the others.
2762;His acting is amazing and does a fantastic job of showing how Batman became Batman and how he overcame his biggest enemy: his fears.
2763;But if the caliber of movie making matches this movie, I'll catch it even if they cast Ben Stein into the part.
2764;see for any comic book or action movie fan.
2765;Batman Begins was such a relief for Batman fans.
2766;Finally we have a movie that is worth braggin about and has taken the franchise in a great new direction.
2767;This one is definitely the 2nd best Batman movie to date.
2768;and I say that because The Dark Knight was just so damn good.
2769;"Even if you're not a ""superhero"" movie fan, you'll like this one."
2770;"This takes away the ""supernatural/superhero"" aspects of other comic movies, and turns it more realistic."
2771;Christian Bale not only cuts a fine figure but gives the role the gravity it deserves, providing the much needed raison d'etre for the Dark Knight.
2772;Christopher Nolan put together an excellent supporting cast with Michael Caine giving Alfred a nice comic touch and Gary Oldman as a young Detective Gordon.
2773;I also thought Cillian Murphy did a great job as Dr. Jonathon Crane, the genesis for the Joker.
2774;It will be interesting to see where they take Batman from here.
2775;I really enjoyed watching all of the Batman movies except for this one.
2776;special Features are only available on your personal computer's ROM.
2777;story, romance, action and very good special effects.
2778;a wonderful director CHRISTOPHER NOLAN should get high praise for his vision and version.
2779;people who love movies should take note and follow his career.
2780;, finally is the wonderful actor CHRISTIAN BALE.
2781;he has many movies to his credit but this will make him a star.
2782;this will be one of the years best movies.
2783;this, as the title implies, is the story about how batman begins, well, being batman.
2784;Very well worth watching, and you gotta see it before seeing The Dark Knight!
2785;ray disc with which to start a new Blu.
2786;Jameson L. Thottam Review of Batman beginsI, Jameson L. Thottam, found that Batman Begins is a return to glory for a franchise that was once thought to be sunk by Mr. Ocean and Joel S. Gone are the flashy colors that prevailed in the last 2 installments, and gone are the tongue in.
2787;What had been a disgrace to comic book fans in previous films, Batman is given a new style, a new outlook, and a new car.
2788;Hoping to find a solution to these fears he basically gives up on what once was a bright future, and turned instead towards discovering why criminals do the things that they do.
2789;This has led him on a journey that places him somewhere between lunatic and savior.
2790;This leads him right to the door.
2791;christian Bale dons the cape and cowl in Batman Begins, and I, Jameson L. Thottam, felt did a great job in the role.
2792;Bale stands on his own, and really makes the character of Batman his own, by not falling prey to all of the stereotypes that the former actors had fallen under.
2793;This wasn't a lesson in showing off just how good looking Bale could be, and Bale does a great job of being part of the story, rather than being the story.
2794;Don't get me wrong, Bale has his scenes where he is able to show off everything he has learned, but at the meat of the movie we are able to cling to something more than just a few spectacular fight scenes.
2795;surrounding Bale in this film, are many other great actors who lend their acting talents in great fashion.
2796;top supporting characters who are designed more for star appeal than what they really offer the film, and they are replaced with accomplished actors who know just how to turn a phrase or create drama within a scene.
2797;They are all given parts that play to their talents, and it is very enjoyable to see any one of them on the screen at any given time.
2798;In addition, we have smaller roles played by Ken Watanabe and Rutger Hauer who are also fun to watch.
2799;playing the female lead is Katie Holmes in a role that very well could push her over into starring roles in film.
2800;Being a supporting character has been her bread and butter since Dawson's Creek, and this film might be the one she needed.
2801;She is pretty good in her role, and does end up being the Mary Jane to Bale's Peter Parker.
2802;Crane was very good in this role, and seeing the film will provide the explanation as to why I don't over.
2803;All in all, the cast of Batman Begins was a great one, and I, Jameson L. Thottam, was really glad with all of the choices made for the film.
2804;Instead, what we have here is a homage to the comic book, and a true story that goes back to the roots of Batman.
2805;What we have here is a really dark film, which explains the transformation of a boy into a man, and everything that he hoped to accomplish.
2806;I, Jameson L. Thottam, found myself almost applauding at the end of the film, and when there were emotional scenes involving the young Bruce Wayne I, Jameson L. Thottam, could really feel those emotions.
2807;telling, and the perfect cast helped to make this one of the best movies of 2005 so far.
2808;I liked it when batman had people thinking that he was a monster in the dark, i loved all the effects in the movie !!!!
2809;Batman Begins is a cinematic triumph because it doesn't allow the power of Hollywood glitz, to get in the way of a compelling story that is character based and powerful.
2810;Bale is at the heart of that story .
2811;giving a portrayal of Batman that is at once .
2812;tortured and dark as well as warm and sensitive.
2813;The Batman franchise is back and in Bale, they have a powerful leading man.
2814;bale's Batman has a lot of imperfections, keeping with director Nolan's vision of Bruce Wayne struggling to learn how to be a crimefighter for the first time.
2815;Batman struggles to hold on when leaping buildings for the first time.
2816;nolan's portrayal of Gotham City also gives it a dimension that many of us can identify with.
2817;this Batman gives the franchise a soul and a superhero with human frailties both physical and emotional.
2818;Nolan and Goyer, along with Bale have succeeded beyond expectations in bringing respect to the franchise again.
2819;This is the Batman that we have all come to see.
2820;I really enjoy the comic book movies.
2821;Some of have been done very well like, the Spiderman movies, and the X. men movies, but then some have not exactly hit the mark like, The Fantastic 4, and Daredevil.
2822;Batman Begins absolutly deserves to be in the class of super hero movies that have been done well.
2823;I really enjoyed the original Batman movie with Michael Keaton, and I thought the second movie (michael keaton as well) was quirkey but enjoyable.
2824;The last two Batmans, took the comic book animated look to a new level, and it just didn't work.
2825;recently with the X. men movies we saw a new style of comic book movies being made in a more believable, less comic book style format, and that format for the most part has created a better movie.
2826;With the creation of the Spiderman movies I believed the format hit perfection.
2827;the cast in the movie is great.
2828;But my favorite actor in the movie was Michael Caine, who does a superb job as Alfred.
2829;and the most surprising role in the movie was Gary Oldman.
2830;Until this movie I had never seen Oldman in anything but the villain, but he plays a great supporting character to Batman.
2831;this is a great movie!
2832;Christopher Nolan did a great job with these movies.
2833;The disc is fine, except that a few of circular plastic teeth that hold the disc within the cover broke upon opening the cover for the first time.
2834;I'll make this short and sweet.
2835;"The batman franchise will live long and continue for years to come and it is by ""Batman Begins"" that it will all be possible."
2836;This is the best version of Batman to ever hit the screen.
2837;It is dark, stylish, and true enough to the comics to make die hards happy without alienating moviegoers who are not up to speed on the comics.
2838;the cast is absolutely superb.
2839;Christian Bale brings just the right amount of tormented soul to Bruce Wayne, Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred, and Katie Holmes is as pretty as always.
2840;Add in the usual fantastic performances by Morgan Freeman and Liam Neesom, and you have the best comic book based film ever.
2841;please suppot this film so we can get bigger and better movies featuring comic book characters.
2842;I would recommend it for the older crowd.
2843;It's a pretty dark and serious movie but very well done.
2844;A very good movie to watched with your family and just have all day movie night.
2845;The story involves two underknown Batman villains, retells the origin of Bruce Wayne becoming Batman and knows how to balance seriousness and fun (something the second film FORGOT to do.)
2846;the acting in this film is top.
2847;notch with Christian Bale making a terrific Bruce Wayne (and a fun over.
2848;the special effects are great and includes some exciting action sequences (most memorably involving the tummbler through the streets of Gotham).
2849;Yeah, this movie is almost perfect, it's the best Batman movie to date, a must see for anybody.
2850;This is a must have movie.
2851;When the brilliant writer Bob Kane first created the Dark Knight of Gothom City in the 1930s, I'm sure one of his after thoughts was to picture his Dark Avenger in a live action movie.
2852;After viewing it, my first impression is, WOW!
2853;The film is a great combination of humanistic philosophy, explosive action, menacing criminals, and an excellent script with talented actors.
2854;Crafted in the mind of originator Bob Kane, his Capped Crusader rises from the panels of DC Comics and explodes onto the big screen with all the force of a true classic.
2855;As Par for the course, director Christopher Nolan has conscripted the superb performing talents of Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, and Michael Caine as Alfred.
2856;All in all, I encourage all viewers to prepare themselves for a action crammed film of legendary characters,explosive scenes and cinematic history
2857;8 (1/10)This was, in my opinion, the best of all of the Batman series.
2858;The action was far more believable and the fighting scenes were much more true to life .
2859;The scenes and/or locations had a good range from dank and droopy city shots to bright and gorgeous mountain range footage.
2860;I rate this movie a solid 8, which to me means I am glad I bought it, but yes there is better.
2861;I adored the 1st Batman, that's a 4.5 star movie, easy, Michael Keaton and of course Jack Nicholson made that movie so much fun.
2862;By far, BATMAN BEGINS is the best of the Batman movies to date.
2863;Leaving the flashiness and flamboyence of the previous movies behind, this Batman is packed with action, a great storyline and superior acting.
2864;Good action, good spacial effects, a bit dark in terms of color but it is good.
2865;over all it is good
2866;He has amazing screen presence and makes you believe that he is the Dark Knight.
2867;I was impressed how naturally he jumped into the role and made it his own.
2868;the story is tight and easy to follow.
2869;The cinematography is beautiful, especially the parts filmed in Iceland.
2870;The video transfer is almost perfect and there are plenty of extras for the rabid Batman fan.
2871;The compilation comic book is a very nice addition.
2872;I would recommend this set to anybody.
2873;LOL!Great special effects and story line.
2874;Batman begins may have taken what was missing frrom the old movies but he forgot to give us the colors, the fun dialoge and the joy of Batman here we have a scary, dark drama.
2875;i was a huge fan of the first two Tim Burton movies but the time as finally come to relegate them to the third and forth spot as greatest batman movies with Batman Begins edging out the superb Mask Of the Phantasm in to second place.
2876;as a fan of Batman and movies in general if another comic adaptation reaches these heights again I will be very impressed.
2877;Batman Begins is a very good action movie, with a decent plot.
2878;In this movie we finally learn how that all came about and it's adapted well from the comic origin written years ago.
2879;i gave it four stars because it's a very entertaining movie, that manages to take an exhausted franchise and bring it back to life in a big way for yet another generation.
2880;"Staying inside the comic movie genre
2881;Just about everything was right .
2882;Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon of the Gotham PD was also spot on .
2883;making Gordon a believable and sympathetic figure as opposed to the buffoonish one we might have expected.
2884;Batman Begins gives us a new take on the genesis of the Caped Crusader .
2885;with special effects always in the service of the story.
2886;I would recommend to anyone.
2887;perhaps on a superficial level you will be charmed by the attractive cast, the gritty sets/ scenes, and the new batman suit and mobile.
2888;And to a degree the story is anchored on the question of Vengeance and Justice, which provides a measure of depth.
2889;Moreover, does it make a good action movie?It could have.
2890;Batman Begins' idea of action is to stick the camera as close to the action as possible, than shake it very fast left and right to simulate intensity.
2891;I read somewhere that the director of this movie has Memento and Imsomnia on his resume.
2892;and it shows in Batman Begins.
2893;What can I say it's Batman!
2894;Batman Begins is a gritty superhero film, and a fantastic reboot of a languishing franchise.
2895;I loved this movie in the theater, and saw it twice on the big screen.
2896;I could hardly believe how detailed and rich the images were, and how colorful the movie actually is, despite the overall dark theme.
2897;The fine detail of the ninja outfits during the Tibet scenes.
2898;Good movie all around: story, actors, and action.
2899;x. men really started a new craze in Hollywood by being a super hero movie that was actually enjoyable.
2900;Yes, there are still failures in the super hero movie world, The Hulk, Punisher, etc.
2901;But, this latest venture into comic book reality is amazing.
2902;Batman Begins is Premium Super Hero Movie Making!Not since Tim Burton had the helm in the first Batman has a Batman movie been this good.
2903;Better yet, this movie might actually be better than Burton's vision.
2904;Christian Bale might never be better than Keaton as Batman, but for the time being Bale is the best we have.
2905;there are small instances of comic humor in this movie, but for once, reality prevails in a comic book movie.
2906;This movie looks and feels great.
2907;gadgets are actually believable and have a hint of science behind them, and the action isn't totally ridiculous (i. e. the Mighty Morphin """"Batman and Robin"""")This movie deserves five stars for reinvigorating a dying movie franchise."""
2908;It is a great time and will please many a movie goer.
2909;i am very happy and will definitely be back for more!
2910;The origins of Batman are explored in this fine fifth installment of the Batman series.
2911;"Known as the ""scarecrow"", he has developed a gas that can poison people as well as Gotham's water supply."
2912;bruce decides that he must do something to help the people of Gotham.
2913;He developed all kinds of cool gear, such as a kevlar suit and a high.
2914;With Lucius' help, Bruce uses these items to give birth to Batman.
2915;tech gear, will Batman be able to stop Carmine Falcone and the scarecrow before they destroy Gotham?I enjoyed this movie a great deal.
2916;The special effects are very good, and I enjoyed seeing how Bruce became Batman.
2917;The acting, especially by Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman, is superb.
2918;I recommend this movie very highly.
2919;In time, I believe that Christian Bale will replace Michael Keaton as the general consensus favorite in the role of the Guardian of Gotham, as he truly puts the Dark in Dark Knight.
2920;Christian Bale captures perfectly the brood of Batman, as well as the careless, playboy persona of Bruce Wayne.
2921;"Katie Holmes does a good job in shedding her ""Dawson's Creek"" image, and handles the character of Rachael Dawes well."
2922;Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, and the rest of the support cast turn in worthy performances in their respective roles.
2923;Each special effect has a meaning, and if this movie's intent was to wipe the slate clean, and offer an apology for the previous four Batman movies, then mission accomplished.
2924;This is a comic book movie that does not present itself as a comic book movie.
2925;Each character and story element is believable, and I sincerely hope that the key elements from this project will be back for a sequel in a few years.
2926;If you're a fan of the comic, you will thoroughly enjoy this effort.
2927;Finally, Warner Brothers takes their cash cow seriously and appoints a smart and respectful director, writer and actor to create the newest version of the Dark Knight.
2928;christopher Nolan, well known for directing intelligent, serious movies [.]
2929;He gets locked up to keep the other prisoners from being hurt.
2930;It's a painstaking process, and extremely believable.
2931;eye science executive Lucius Fox (well played by Morgan Freeman) and the faithful butler Alfred (the always welcome Michael Caine) to help.
2932;With his childhood sweetheart (Katie Holmes) trying to figure him out, a madman Psychologist (Cillian Murphy) sending criminals to Arkham Asylum for seemingly no reason, the new vigilante finds himself bonding with James Gordon (underplayed brilliantly by Gary Oldman), one good cop surrounded by many corrupt ones, and getting more out of the relationship than he ever thought he would.
2933;as you can see, the casting of this movie is brilliant.
2934;Front and center is semi new comer Christian Bale playing the part of Bruce Wayne and Batman so well.
2935;"The genius of this movie stands in the discovery
2936;The realism that goes into the creation of this dark obsessed person focusing his energy on becoming an outrageous character that preys on the criminal element is sublime and spot on.
2937;This is the second best super.
2938;hero movie of all time (#1 goes to Dark Knight) and it definitely is more interesting in the realistic take on a fantasy genre, which is plausibly in the real gritty world.
2939;I especially liked them addressing what is IMO a plausible critique of Bruce Wayne: that he by way of his pornographic wealth creates the crime that he fights.
2940;I have viewed a number of blu.
2941;I did like this Batman movie a lot!
2942;But overall, a good film to add to your Batman collection.
2943;from the very start, there is a nice chemistry between Alfred, the butler (superbly played by Michael Caine) and Bruce Wayne (excellent job by Christian Bale).
2944;The humor is of the gentle kind, almost subtle in its implications, and it sets the stage for the more realistic flow of events to follow.
2945;There's a pulsating background score by Hans Zimmer and John Newton Howard that races along with the film, punctuating it in just the right places, at just the right moments, to give a vigorous punch to the action scenes.
2946;but the quieter moments are all extremely well played and given depth by real characterizations.
2947;looming over the landscape is Liam Neeson, a distinguished actor who excels in his carefully concealed villainy.
2948;He is a force to be reckoned with and displays all of his versatility here.
2949;the story is forcefully presented with magnificent visuals and eye.
2950;popping sets that all have a realistic gleam and are yet stylized enough to give credence to the fact that this is all based on a comic strip character.
2951;He has all the strength and wily intelligence behind his serious good looks and makes the perfect embodiment of the action hero he is portraying.
2952;Firm of jaw, direct of gaze, he makes an excellent hero.
2953;The thrills come one after another, set pieces that are astounding to watch.
2954;Christopher Nolan has done an excellent job of handling his subject matter with great skill and flourish.
2955;I love the movies from Nolan including this one!!!
2956;The story line and actors and actress, everything is perfect!!!
2957;Christian Bale is the best Bateman ever!!!
2958;As other reviewers have already mentioned, this is a great movie.
2959;Nolan makes not just a great superhero movie, but a great movie in general.
2960;High tech extras that have more interaction with the disc.
2961;The cast, acting, direction, cinematography, and writing are all excellent as are the visual effects.
2962;the best feature of this film is the fact that running in 1080i resolution there are no blue.
2963;While I have read some of the comics and seen the earlier movies the overall storyline never snagged an interest in me UNTIL BATMAN BEGINS!This film is so impressive that I am simply dumbstruck.
2964;The director deserves a medal for one of the most telling storylines of the entire saga, comic book or other media, ever.
2965;it is the nature of that possession and its power which enables and emboldens the character and which is so well defined within this movie.
2966;A great way to begin the trilogy.
2967;I think Bale plays the comic hero the best.
2968;I enjoyed the story better then previous versions/adaptations.
2969;It was well directed with a good plot.
2970;I thought Christopher Nolan gave us an excellent movie.
2971;I thought the line up of actors was superb.
2972;Though I thought some of it dragged a little at times over all I thought it was a good action moving movie.
2973;I know everyone has their own preference for what type of movie they like and I really wondered if I would even like this one.
2974;Well done and as far as I'm concerned i feel the filming was superb.
2975;This is the best Batman of the series.
2976;Christopher Nolan has done the best job of any Batman director.
2977;Christian Bale is the best Batman ever hands down.
2978;This is the best comic movie to come out.
2979;This movie is actually true to the Dark Knight comic it's not supposed to be very funny just dark.
2980;So don't tell me not to think when i see it i was thinking the whole time and i really loved this movie.
2981;The sound and video was excellent.
2982;Batman has always been a cool character.
2983;(Followed by an occasional dance here and there.)
2984;Nevertheless, it was still pretty cool if not entertaining.
2985;The way we heard it in our minds as we read through Miller's masterpiece.
2986;Should the Batman series be so realistic?
2987;well, we've all seen that guy dressed as Batman at the comic conventions or during Halloween.
2988;I feel that Batman works best in comics and animation and if you're doing a take on him for live action, it should have those elements noticeably involved.
2989;gOOD: Oldman's take on Gordon is one piece of realism that grounds the movie.
2990;His acting is surprisingly subtle.
2991;gOOD: Michael Cain's Alfred is well played and written.
2992;bAD: The relationship between Christian and Katie.
2993;Nolan's film is primarily viewed through Batman's eyes and focuses on his origins.
2994;surprisingly, I really enjoyed 'Batman: The Animated Series' and it's subsequent full length releases the most.
2995;Dark and full of retro 40's charm.
2996;A nice mix of the 'brooding Batman' from Miller's 'Dark Night' and a respectful dose of the ,detective Batman' from creator Bob Kane .
2997;And lets face it, Kane is the only man who truly knows who Batman really is.
2998;Batman became a huge success, and was one of the first """"summer megahype movies"""" to benefit from the new Hollywood press machine."""
2999;While the movie may have emphasized style over substance, seeing Michael Keaton's Batman (using an arsenal of high.
3000;"Batman fever reigned high at the time, but Burton's sequel, ""Batman Returns"", couldn't match the freshness of its predecessor, despite being a quite solid effort."
3001;the storyline hews closer to the various Batman comic books as well.
3002;Barely escaping with his life, Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham with an idea in his head.
3003;Back in Gotham, he finds his father's company is in danger of losing its way, and is about to go public, thanks to the machinations of Earle, who was trusted with the company.
3004;The cast is a treasure trove of outstanding actors, including Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Tom Wilkinson, Cillian Murphy, and Linus Roache, to mention a few.
3005;While some may object to the slower pacing of the movie, it works well, and creates tension.
3006;The movie is saturated with browns, yellows and oranges, creating a warm glow to contrast with the sinister atmosphere brought by the story, while the minimalist soundtrack is appropriately gothic when needed.
3007;But in the end, this is a superhero movie of the highest order, which tries to balance the fantastic with the realistic, and usually succeeds.
3008;The movie viewer has been pretty fortunate with comic book movies as of late, with Superman Returns, the X. men movies, and the Spiderman movies.
3009;Whichever version you get, the movie is outstanding.
3010;I've followed this film's production for a good while now.
3011;This movie will reboot the Batman franchise.
3012;The story will be a treat for Batfans non.
3013;judging from his interviews, Christian Bale is taking this role very seriously, even dedicated it to his father who passed away the end of last.
3014;This man will become the new embodiment of Batman/Bruce Wayne.
3015;I bought this as a gift for my sons, who are Batman fans, and they totally enjoyed it!
3016;Everything that is included in it is well worth the price I paid for it.
3017;A great movie, the best of the Batman series.
3018;Wonderful to watch and a great addition to ones library.
3019;Christopher Nolan is an incredible director!
3020;And Christian Bale is an amazing actor so it is a recipe for success.
3021;I believe this version of batman is the truest depiction of Batman.
3022;Then they followed it up with some of the best performances ever!
3023;And they got the atmosphere right, and added some emotional depth to Batman's backstory.
3024;This movie was really good where it stayed small, a scale which the writers could handle.
3025;It's funny how Warner Brother's didn't want Tim Burton back for the 3rd movie since he made the movies too dark.
3026;This is the best since Tim Burton's films and what a Batman film should be like.
3027;Christopher Nolan gives the film a human touch and makes it more about Bruce Wayne and his feelings than about the villains.
3028;He takes everything about it seriously.
3029;I found it a little silly how deep and monster like his voice sounds.
3030;The gas in the original just made people die with goofy smiles on their faces.
3031;Cillain Murphy from 28 Days Later does a fine job playing him too.
3032;christian Bale makes a great Batman and the best since Michael Keaton.
3033;He has a lot of inner.
3034;He decides to dress like a bat since bats were always his fear.
3035;it's nice to the see the actual tranformation he makes to Batman in this one.
3036;I always doubted he made all of them on his own.
3037;So the Lucius Fox character is a nice touch.
3038;Plus with Ducard we also know that Batman didn't just train himself to fight.
3039;There's just so many characters to mention in this film.
3040;Nolan actually fits in a nice ammount of screen time for them too.
3041;He is the type of actor who can make a small part seem like a bigger one.
3042;That's how good of an actor he is.
3043;Gary Oldman also shines as Lt. Gordon who is the only cop who trusts and befriends batman.
3044;Batman is much better without them.
3045;Batman is also much better without.
3046;It just likes other Batman movies.
3047;A very good action movie.
3048;I'd like to recommend it to my friends.
3049;ray player you'll love this movie!
3050;I loved the storytelling of the movie which chronacles Batman's early days which includes his training and his travels.
3051;I also liked the action that was featured in the movie(especially the train scene near the end of the movie).
3052;This person cites Batman And Robin as the best Batman film.
3053;The movie more than holds up, by the way.
3054;"ray owners finally got their wish, ""Batman Begins"" comes to the format."
3055;Watching and listening to the 'Tumbler' in action is amazing.
3056;"ray gets ""The Dark Knight"" Prologue, the first 6 minutes of possibly the best movie of all time."
3057;I was really surprised after the attempts to make these movies with the comic feel that they went back to the dark script and sets.
3058;It was a great balance.
3059;It was create to know the story and watch as they set them selves us for what we all know is coming.
3060;i really suggest that if you loved Batman and Batman Returns than you will LOVE this one too.
3061;I would make sure that you see it in the theatre before it's off the big screen.
3062;By Far the Best Batman to come out since the original with Michael Keaton, Christian Bale plays the role of Bruce Wayne perfectly.
3063;I have always felt that this is the better of the Batman movies, simply because it does more to explain how Bruce Wayne became the bat man.
3064;tim Burton did an excellent job on Batman and Batman Returns (the Danny DeVito portrayal of the Penguin still makes my skin crawl.)
3065;All star cast, all star performances (even Katie Holmes), great movie.
3066;high class action thorughout and great story telling, read Batman: Year One for more detailed info.
3067;Christian Bale was superb and Michael Caine as Alfred was a wise choice!
3068;all in all a fine film, no matter what some patriotic, lovingcountryflagwavingnationlist people think!
3069;while the movie turned out to be nicely done, it seemed to lack in a few areas.
3070;i found myself laughing at the movie during serious seens.
3071;I enjoyed watching this movie.
3072;The Nolan Reboot of Batman and The Dark Night is Awesome!
3073;This is a great movie.
3074;It looked great once I finally got it playing (which took 3 or 4 attempts for some reason .
3075;I really wanted to watch the Dark Knight movie preview right away so that bummed me out.
3076;i watched them all) and im really proud to say i like Batman most.
3077;I mean,Bruce Wayne is rich,intelligent,charming and all stark.
3078;i'm so much a big Christian Bale fan.
3079;I mean,this guy is all so cool.
3080;He cries,fights,trains and battles with his emotions all so well,he is no doubt the best Batty ever.
3081;here,Bale shows he is indeed such a good actor of great calibre,he puts the rest of the cast,be it his loyal butler Alfred,love interest Rachel (a very redundant Katie Holmes) or Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson).
3082;His painful moments and past,you're sure to feel the agony too as Bale,an ever brilliant actor,plays it right on the cards.
3083;with the right cast (minus ineffectual Holmes),right script and director,dark moments and a wonderful male lead,i give this film two thumbs up.
3084;the best part about any of the first movies to me is the fact that Jack Nicholson played the Joker.
3085;Christian Bale does an great job of portraying this character.
3086;This movie actually shows us Bruce's transformation and hardcore training he goes through in order to become the superhero we all know and love.
3087;i got to see it on IMAX too.
3088;It is rumoured that this film may get nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars, and it very well deserves it.
3089;iwas the type of kid who enjoyed the two Burton films more than Schumacher's films in which back in those days kids enjoyed the last two more than the first two.
3090;There were rumours in the coming years of a Batman Superman film and a Batman Beyond film, but both ideas flunked.
3091;so here I am almost eight years later watching a complete restart of the franchise and it is finally done absolutely right.
3092;Bale is by far the greatest portrayl of the character I have ever seen, EVER!
3093;This film goes along with Spider.
3094;I didn't think the kid could pull off the newest version of the Dark Knight, but he does at least as good a job as Michael Keaton and actually comes off more dark .
3095;once again, we see Liam Neeson portraying the mentor type(See also Star Wars Episode One, Gangs of New York, and Kingdom of Heaven), as he teaches a young Bruce Wayne all about the ways of fighting technique and skill.
3096;It is notable that young Bruce already possesses some knowledge of the martial arts.
3097;hans Zimmer provides a typical Hans Zimmer score, which is, as usual, captivating.
3098;this is right there with the original in terms of depth and acting.
3099;The storyline is a bit more believable but folks, this is based on a comic book.
3100;The film's message is through metaphors.
3101;The Christopher Nolan trilogy is one of my favorites.
3102;I had to watch this one again after I watched The Dark Knight Rises.
3103;The best super hero movie of all time.
3104;better than all of the superhero movies combined.
3105;watch this and conquer your fears.
3106;i only saw this movie for Katie, who I enjoyed since I enjoy herother films.
3107;I'm sure to see these movies oneday.
3108;Like watching Ronny Howard transform before our eyes on `The Andy Griffith Show' and `Happy Days', I enjoy watching young actors grow up, and see where they go.
3109;He is sometimes called `The Man Without Fear'.
3110;i enjoy the other Batman films.
3111;They don't take themselves tooseriously, and are funny.
3112;"Instead `Batman Begins' adds credit to `Batman' with a Joker card and Batman's line ""I'll look into it""."
3113;Neither does Michael Caine but he suits the part of Alfred.
3114;The whole cast is impressive.
3115;I also was impressed with Christopher Nolan's direction.
3116;I was glad he was director because I had seen his previous film, `Insomnia', with Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank and loved it.
3117;I love the image of Katie Holmes lyinglimp in Batman's arms.
3118;It really is quite beautiful to me.
3119;I know Batman is a hero for many young children so all the more power to you all.
3120;So no matter what you do when you're young keep it fun!
3121;Suspense, drama, action and a good story line.
3122;Better than that, watching it on Amazon saved us from having to find copy somewhere.
3123;"Batman Begins is a splendid renewal of the ""Batman"" film franchise, offering us not only the quintessential ""Batman"" in young Welsh actor Christian Bale, but also finally showing how young Bruce Wayne became ""Batman""."
3124;And unlike either of Burton's films, the emotional core of this film is the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman himself.
3125;Christian Bale's portrayal of Batman is as an avenging angel seeking justice, with his Bruce Wayne a sly, more thoughtful playboy billionaire than Michael Keaton's version.
3126;Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon is a role truly far removed from his more typical work, offering us the decent, honest cop who will eventually become Gotham's police commissioner.
3127;Batman Begins may be the best screen adaptation of a classic comic I have seen lately.
3128;I look forward to yet another collaboration from Nolan and Bale in the Batman series.
3129;I'm no movie critic nor am i a comic aficionado but in my opinion this is a fantastic movie.
3130;Batman Begins is all about a man who battles his enemies and inner demons.
3131;He's human, physically and emotionally.
3132;bruce Wayne is a fascist at heart .
3133;And that's something that the film latches on to .
3134;"and what makes it not only the best of the ""Batman"" movies, but also a great film by any standard."
3135;christopher Nolan, the British filmmaker who bent all the rules in 2000 with the nonlinear and mind.
3136;"boggling masterpiece ""Memento"", directed ""Batman Begins."""
3137;What Nolan has actually done is take a severely over.
3138;Begins opens somewhere in Asia.
3139;she is subsequently put on a hit list and Batman, who learns the truth, races against time to save her.
3140;"(Oh, yeah, she was Bruce's childhood friend, too
3141;I admire the technical skill of this production.
3142;I usually hate this, but it works well in """"Batman Begins,"""" because we're meant to fear the unknown."""
3143;Sounds are used to great effect.
3144;"Apart from a few action sequences and swarms of bats, most of ""Batman Begins"" is real, and that really impressed me."
3145;it moved quickly, awkwardly, with scenes interrupting other scenes out of the blue.
3146;Batman Begins is formed on a similar scale.
3147;"Complemented by the fast editing and Nolan's impressive direction, ""Batman Begins"" walks the fine line between pretentiousness and sloppiness ."
3148;it is artsy and careful, clocking in at 2 hours and 20 minutes, but the edits and fight sequences are clearly inspired.
3149;"bale is perfect as Batman, and the best yet, because he fits every aspect of the character
3150;And in the suit, he looks confident without being comfortable .
3151;the rest of the cast range from above average to very good: Michael Caine is fun as Alfred"
3152;It actually takes its time.
3153;And best of all, there are no bat.
3154;Deep, Dark, and Edgy .
3155;you can use these words to describe Batman, and you can use these words to describe this movie as well.
3156;The more recent Batman cartoons have been rather good, and that only added to the mystery as to why an even decent Hollywood film couldn't tell the story half as well despite their many attempts with big budgets and great actors.
3157;It amazes me that a cartoon artist thought up even the basic elements of this story.
3158;this is the Batman movie you were always hoping they would make.
3159;is the star here, and its excellently told without getting overshadowed by big name movie stars.
3160;My favorite of the three Christopher Nolan movies.
3161;Takes you into the beginnings of Batman and how he becames such a badass.
3162;Also, Liam Neeson is fantastiic as well as great performances from Morgan Freeman Gary Oldman and Michael Caine.
3163;The movie itself is one that will want to be owned by many.
3164;This is easily the best super hero film ever made, and possibly one of the Top 10 movies of all time.
3165;the most refreshing aspects of the movie is its realism.
3166;riddled discotheque draws us drawn into the action like we haven't been before.
3167;Complimenting this direction perfectly were the understated performances of the actors.
3168;It was nice to see villains that could exist in real life.
3169;I glad to say they work perfectly together, and it's not overwhelming in the slightest.
3170;I was also relieved they put the romance on the back burner, and Katie Holmes primary role in this movie is to be on the posters and in the trailers, where she looks fantastic.
3171;Cillian Murphy gives Nicholson a run for best villian ever .
3172;I'm not exaggerating, he's incredible, even in the few minutes of screen time.
3173;Morgan Freeman is fantastic as a scientist who has been run through the corporate grinder and ended in the basement of Wayne Industries.
3174;Liam Neison plays the most interesting character in the movie, and probably put this movie over the top for me, and cemented it as one I will never forget.
3175;in a brilliant subtext of the movie they use Wayne Manor and as euphemism for the Batman franchise.
3176;This was very entertaining, and rare to see in an action/adventure movie.
3177;for what a movie is supposed to accomplish, Batman Begins may hit the mark sharper than any movie ever made.
3178;It is one of the most engrossing, entertaining, creative, and smartly written movies of it's genre .
3179;it was just nice to leave the theater after watching a Batman movie without having to convince myself that I liked it.
3180;But some of the movie's best original bits center around the effects that The Scarecrow and his weapons have on his victims.
3181;the Batmobile is pretty cool.
3182;He is a very fine actor and does a splendid job here.
3183;the music is good without being intrusive.
3184;"It keeps your attention on the film instead of on the ""whole entertainment package""."
3185;The second and third act are far superior technically and artistically, though they still make us suffer through the occasional genre movie cliche.
3186;But the actor is cute, and this IS Hollywood after all, so.
3187;Instead, it is a very solid Triple.
3188;Christian Bale does a terrific job acting as a confused, violent sociopath defending his city from other violent sociopaths who would gleefully destroy the social and economic framework of Gotham.
3189;The origin of Batman is presented in an almost believable fashion and his phobia and later fascination with bats is presented with a clear and unapologetic vision.
3190;In fact, unlike any of the previous films, this one centers on Bruce Wayne and his evolution into Batman.
3191;batman Begins is dark, intense, and completely faithful to the source material.
3192;Christian Bale nails the parts of Batman and Bruce Wayne perfectly.
3193;There is even a perfect segue into a possible sequel in the movie's final scene.
3194;this movie comes with my highest possible recommendation.
3195;in the movie that's called The Dark Knight, Batman actually takes a back seat to the villains, who steal the show.
3196;first of all, it's inevitable that the new Christopher Nolan movies will always be compared to the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher movies, so that's one thing I myself will do.
3197;out campy and bright Schumacher films.
3198;I feel that Batman Begins is TOO real.
3199;To me, Batman movies should have an element of fun to them.
3200;Sometimes he went a little too far, like dancing, etc., but he showed he was funny as well as dark and evil.
3201;It was a good balance.
3202;i thought the acting was pretty good.
3203;The best acting came from Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard.
3204;Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox was also pretty good.
3205;I thought Katie Holmes was pretty good as Rachel Dawes.
3206;I like her portrayal of Rachel Dawes a little better than Maggie Gyllenhaal's in The Dark Knight.
3207;i think this movie is better than The Dark Knight.
3208;The movies feel like these cop dramas, especially the second and third movies.
3209;Everyone has their own opinions.
3210;it has saved the Batman franchise, after the last two prior movies.
3211;this movie is who and what Batman is.
3212;and it's gonna be one of the best films of the century.
3213;"i've seen both the teaser and theatrical trailer in theaters and it looks absolutely amazing
3214;The was a gift for my brother.
3215;is a damn good line, no denying it.
3216;all in all I'd have to say this was a pretty good movie, I'd say the second best Batman film made, next to the first one with Keaton and Nickleson.
3217;I especially enjoyed the first 45 min, dealing with Bruce Wayne's tutelage under Liam Neisen, who is brilliant in the film.
3218;The whole Batman character has been made much more realistic than in past films (although less comic.
3219;booky), and psychologically this movie is far superior to its predecesors.
3220;The idea of Batman as an object of fear is well explored, and I find it refreshing in the face of too.
3221;friendly superheroes like Spiderman and the like.
3222;Katie Holmes is passable (at best) as young Bruce's romantic interest, although the romance really takes a major backseat to the crime fighting an all.
3223;Cillian Murphy is great as the Scarecrow, one of the more interesting Batman villians (and just not as fruity as Riddler).
3224;so mostly good, but some areas to watch out for:.
3225;so yeh, a few less than grand areas, but an entertaining film nonetheless.
3226;Which I loved, since Batman was becoming very one dimensional in the other movies.
3227;Christian Bale is extremely beautiful, and very sincere as Bruce Wayne.
3228;this is the best Batman movie I have ever saw!
3229;Nevertheless, Batman Begins is an excellent action movie with an outstanding, star.
3230;In addition, the great Michael Caine lends a strong, supporting role as the debonair butler, Alfred, and the talented Morgan Freeman plays a powerful, pivotal role as scientist, Lucius Fox.
3231;human or mutant abilities"
3232;On the other side of the coin, it is perhaps the portrayal of the non.
3233;"ego, the man known as Bruce Wayne, is a person who has internal conflicts as most of us do from time to time
3234;class hero in the purest sense, Wayne is, in the highest regard, a champion for the common people"
3235;quite remarkable is that Mr. Wayne, with the positive influence of his butler, Alfred, grew up to acquire and maintain wise stewardship of his inheritance and would come to use his assets for the betterment of others.
3236;One might even draw parallels to the heroic biographies of notable American figures such as our early twentieth.
3237;all in all, this is a movie that can be seen from a myriad of perspectives.
3238;And that is, in my book, a very important lesson that we must all internalize.
3239;Well, now Batman now has his own movie.
3240;christopher Nolan has created a masterpiece.
3241;Instead of putting Batman in the backseat like previous directors had, He has created basically a tribute to Batman, focusing on his life and emergence.
3242;He also adds his own style and darkness to the film, making it a lot better than the animated style of Burton.
3243;He makes Batman more realistic and helps us see how exactly Batman formed.
3244;The effects were supurb, and I had a fun time watching this fantastic film.
3245;This was his moment to shine, and by god, he has been given the proper film for it!
3246;"Director Christopher Nolan takes the story seriously and he avoids the ""weirdness"" from the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher Batman movies."
3247;Wayne beats up criminals and also ends up becoming one himself.
3248;Wayne returns to Gotham City and is reunited with his butler Alfred(Michael Caine) and his love interest Rachel(Katie Holmes).
3249;Michael Caine sure adds a sense of cool to his version of Alfred Pennyworth.
3250;morgan Freeman is quite good as Lucius Fox.
3251;"The music score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is subtle and never ""in your face""!"
3252;Cillian Murphy(28 Days Later) is quite good as The Scarecrow.
3253;This film does a good job satirizing the post 9/11 era.
3254;Batman Begins saved the Batman film franchise and The Dark Knight came out in 2008.
3255;i got this for like 10 buckskinda forgot i had itbut the picture is sharp and truesounds good i wasnt a huge fan of theprevious batmans but these are awesome
3256;this is the best looking blu.
3257;ray movie i have ever seen, the picture is amazing.
3258;the special features are cool too, alot of behind the scenes stuff.
3259;as far as the movie, great 5 star movie.
3260;the writing is great, very believable.
3261;and gets access to all his gadgets, and the Tumbler.
3262;This sure was a good movie, but Michael Keaton still makes a better Batman.
3263;I own all three now and it is amazing to watch them in order.
3264;There are very few movies I would suggest are perfect, but this one is and I'll tell you why.
3265;Sure, by now you know the story line, the way cool Batmobile and a great telling of what has become a classic legend, all grown up from comic books, and evolved into a sort of Greek hero figure like Hercules or Achilles.
3266;What makes the movie great is that it makes the story great.
3267;Then something wonderful happens to that transitional imagination.
3268;You WANT it to be true.
3269;That's why this is a perfect movie.
3270;Because the vision of this movie is that there really, really COULD be a Batman.
3271;All of the gizmos and costumes are necessary, even required.
3272;If you have ever gotten weary of doing all the work to suspend your disbelief to believe in a movie or a story, then you are in for a big, big treat.
3273;"I'll just bet you'll smile a little over your coffee and say ""Sure."
3274;batman reborn love every second god bless Nolan for bringing back the true dark knight to light loved the tone of the series dark amazing.
3275;aside from Katie Holmes (a poor choice for the character of Rachel Dawes), this movie is enjoyable from start to finish!This movie is dark, gripping, and action.
3276;esq type character), this movie's filled with style and substance and will have you keeping your eyes glued to the screen.
3277;morgan Freeman, thankfully, is tolerable in this movie and fits nicely into his role.
3278;This woman gives us a C. grade performance and somewhat de.
3279;It has some good dialogue and some pretty sharp/ace lines.
3280;This film's a lot darker than its predecessors and it's more intense.
3281;christian Bale made for a decent Batman.
3282;it was well worth paying $5 to see this movie in the theatre.
3283;Awesome villain in this one!
3284;This a great movie that really helps start the new better batman legacy!
3285;I would recommend this movie before seeing any of the other titles in the series.
3286;top and utterly fixated on 'Peabody and Sherman'.
3287;By keeping their source material close to heart, they give us Batman in his very best, most functional form: the Dark Knight, relentless, obsessed, unstoppable in a one.
3288;book/Batman diehard what it means to 'raise the Finger' and you'll get a tale in itself).
3289;It's what won Paul Dini, Bruce Timm and their WB Animation team an Emmy here and there for their version of Batman.
3290;"And it's what makes ""Batman Begins"" the best Batman movie ever and one of the best superhero movies ever."
3291;sealing the deal is what is arguably the best cast of any Batman movie, starting with its star.
3292;Christian Bale more than earns his wings as both Batman and Bruce Wayne, portraying the latter with appropriate ebullience and charisma, and the former with resplendent darkness and pure fright.
3293;"played with sufficient chills by Cillian Murphy in the first genuinely creepy Batvillain role since ""Batman Returns"" ."
3294;the Dark Knight is aided, as always, by faithful Wayne family butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine, brilliant as ever), who dutifully aids his charge in combatting the corrupt influences in Gotham City but bears increasing concerns for the welfare of both Bruce and the people he's fighting for.
3295;His relationship with Bruce forms much of the emotional bedrock of the film.
3296;"Also assisting our hero is ousted Wayne Foundation board member Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman turning in a typically excellent performance), head of the Applied Sciences department that's been long forgotten by CEO William Earle (Rutger Hauer, acting with such oily benevolence you can practically see the dollar signs dancing in his head), thus making it the perfect place from which Bruce can appropriate his needed 'toys'
3297;Holmes's character represents the one readily.
3298;Still, Holmes turns in a sufficient performance given what's required of the role, so I'm willing to let that slide.
3299;The cool military functionality of its design and its impressive speed and maneuverability might have been greatly diminished had this Batmovie been filmed primarily on soundstages like those before it.
3300;But that is where the beauty of the film's cinematography pays off in the second hour: the location shoots in Chicago afford us the opportunity to not only see the most wicked Batmobile chase sequence ever, but to see it at work in parking ranges, on freeways, and, yes, even on top of buildings.
3301;action plates rather than build Gotham from the keel up in a movie studio may be one of the single greatest artistic decisions in the franchise's history"
3302;Batman Begins represents what happens when a capable cast and crew commits themselves to making a believable work of entertainment while staying as true as possible to a rather fantastic source.
3303;It tells you something when some of the best comic.
3304;"And if you want proof, then ""Batman Begins"" is as good a place as any for you to sit down for two hours and see the evidence for yourself."
3305;In the music industry, super.
3306;With movies, you rarely see two filmmakers put their heads together and create something really good.
3307;"With ""Batman Begins"" that's what you get.You have the writer/director of ""Memento"" and the writer of the 3 movies in the ""Blade"" trilogy."
3308;That's a smart pairing up and it didn't go to waste.
3309;Batman Begins is a wonderful film, in many ways.
3310;As a comic book adaptation, as pure entertainment, the art direction and cinematography are great and the cast is unbeatable.
3311;The first two Batman movies (Batman and Batman Returns) were directed by Tim Burton and had Michael Keaton as the masked man.
3312;Don't get me wrong, I love both of those films though.
3313;Both are great actors and again, I enjoyed both films.
3314;This film is more of an action film/drama that has a serious tone to it.
3315;He's a reserved, reclusive billionaire instead of a womanizing, charming, billionaire.
3316;It's a perfect cover too, because everyone in Gotham is under the impression that Bruce is dead.
3317;"love interest named Rachel (Katie Holmes), and Detective Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman)
3318;Anyway, the cinematography and art direction are absolutely wonderful.
3319;This is the best looking Gotham City we've seen on the screen yet.
3320;And the movie is done in a serious way.
3321;Everyone plays their roles to perfection"
3322;It really does justice to Batman.
3323;I think it was the best comic.
3324;fantastic Four was a comedy.
3325;"It's a nice break
3326;Good price on Amazon and great shipping.
3327;Not only is this a dramatic improvement over the last Batman film, its arguably the best comic book.
3328;Being treated like a credible film, you sometimes get the impression you are watching a creepy, gripping psychological drama rather than just a comic.
3329;top music that drives it"
3330;Not to mention the perfect portrayal of the story by director Chris Nolan.
3331;It is the most exciting, dramatic and emotionally gripping of any of the more recent comic book films, certainly of all of the Batman movies.
3332;If you must judge what the Batman character was really meant to be from a movie, make it this one!
3333;By, the way, the special features will keep you up watching for hours also.
3334;They pretty much hold the same structure as the rereleases of the first four films.
3335;Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005) is such a film.
3336;The acting, set design, and narrative are all excellent, with great nods to the comics and graphic novels that have made Batman a legendary character.
3337;Many other viewers simply describe this film as a seminal or mostly decent Batman movie, but there are some distinct elements and casting choices that give this film an edge over other Batman films, including the original 1989 epic.1.)
3338;She was not a femme fatale by any means, but she embodied a strong willed, intelligent, and courageous woman with a purpose.
3339;This was and still is a welcome surprise to me as a viewer.
3340;Rachel also has a distinct function within the film's narrative.
3341;She feels obligated to rid Gotham of crime and injustice, but also is very vulnerable, and is a childhood friend of Bruce.
3342;"Katie's performance was solid, giving viewers the impression that Rachel was both an independent and sensitive woman
3343;Wilkinson's acting prowess is fully utilized here, despite his brief screen time.
3344;His New York / Chicago accent was brilliant, why can't he play more characters like Carmine in other films?
3345;Caine's Alfred presented to the viewers a portrait of a butler whose balanced approach to life also provides a great moral guide to Bruce Wayne and his mission as Batman.4.)
3346;Freeman's Lucius serves as the brains behind Batman, the Q or Quartermaster of the franchise, and also provides the scientific and technological basis for all of Batman's unique gadgets and vehicles, including the tumbler .
3347;Freeman's performance as Lucius is sharp and witty, providing viewers with a smart, and humorous african american character, which up until this film, was not in any other of the Batman movies.5.)
3348;Another one of the most potent and powerful actors our time, portraying one of the most important characters in the Batman mythos.
3349;Oldman remains as the best actor, giving the best performance in this film, as well as the entire Nolan Batman Trilogy.
3350;What was most refreshing about Oldman's take on James Gordon didn't just come from his performance, but also his conception"
3351;Gordon is a confident and capable cop in this film, which was more in line with Frank Miller's Batman Year One (1987 Comic) and a far cry from the late Pat Hingle's character from the original 1989.1997 Batman film series.6.)
3352;Inspired Performance, Great Character Conception,Ducard maintains both the mentor and adversary role well, and his sense of purpose (destroying Gotham through fear) and it shows in Neeson's performance.
3353;Neeson uses a certain craftsmanship in shaping his character, and it presents Ra's as both as a master tactician, and ruthless villain.
3354;Overall, Nolan's Batman Begins was a classic film, one that deserves more credit, due to the fact it re.
3355;Christian Bale gives a powerful performance as both Bruce Wayne and Batman that is full of impact.
3356;I never really considered myself a big batman fan but compared to the previous batman movies this one definitely had my attention.
3357;Because I actually saw Dark Knight first I had to go back and see this one and it's a pretty good movie.
3358;Also, the original Batman is one of my favorite superhero films.
3359;Although the original gets the tone right, we never delve that deeply into the mind of Bruce Wayne.
3360;What makes Batman Begins the best of the Batman movies is because .
3361;it is a character study.
3362;The model Batman Begins follows is the original Superman movie: we begin in the hero's childhood, and explain who he is and how he got to be that way.
3363;The benefit is that we have memorable, three.
3364;Christian Bale is perfect for the part.
3365;Probably because they are better actors than we are).
3366;(His characterization of the playboy is shockingly close to his performance in American Psycho.)
3367;a final note: One of the great things about the movie is the way it sets up relationships that we know will play out in the future.
3368;This movie is superb, and the blu.
3369;"It looks fantastic, and the bonus footage of the first 6 minutes of ""The Dark Knight"" is probably the best looking stuff I've seen so far on my t. v."
3370;This one's much more entertaining than the other Batman movies.
3371;It's a good story based on Bruce Wayne's sincere desire to see justice done and his willingness to lose all to accomplish it.
3372;This was the best Batman yet.
3373;It was action packed and had a great story.
3374;This movie was about how Bruce Wayne came to be Batman, and the first villians that he faced.
3375;Christian Bale did an awesome job as Batman, and Michael Cane was a good and funny Alfred.
3376;I loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone that loves batman or just to anyone that loves a great action flick.
3377;"After many years of disapointment in Batman the TV series and the other Batman movies because of silly villains that turned the Dark Knight into a joke, ""Batman Begins"" finally gets serious."
3378;The Dark Knight is finally a believable superhero.
3379;I certainly hope that he stays this way.
3380;Read the synopsis for the story line.
3381;christian Bale makes an ideal Batman, as Michael Caine makes an excellent Alfred.
3382;The great performances combined with the creative and original story elements all add highly to the watchability of this cinematic masterpiece.
3383;for fans not only of Batman, but also of great movies in general, I highly recommend this film!
3384;Goes into the beginnings of Batman, and the development of his history.
3385;The sound and special effects were among the best I've ever witnessed.
3386;I feel that I more than got my moneys worth.
3387;My wife is not a Batman fan, but she said actually enjoyed it!JB
3388;I loved this movie and I generally am pretty critical so that is saying something.
3389;It has some awesome action and at the same time it upholds moral and principles.
3390;This is hands down the best tv or movie version of Batman to be created.
3391;IMO, it ties with X2 for the best movie adaptation of a comic.
3392;Whether you're a hardcore comic fan or you just enjoy a good action movie, it's definitely worth watching.
3393;director Christopher Nolan reinvent, reimagine, and reinvigorate this franchise, you may well entirely forget about the campy casting (Clooney as Batman!
3394;Nolan, the auteur behind Memento and Insomnia, likes his thrillers dark and twisted, and this one is no exception.
3395;The supporting cast is full of heavy hitters in fine form .
3396;worthy Michael Caine (wonderful as wry, indispensable manservant Alfred) .
3397;I have seen all three of the Chris Nolan Batman series movies and even though all three are wonderfully written, acted, and filmed, I believe this one that starts the series is by far the best as far as plot.
3398;keeps you on the edge of your seat through the whole movie.
3399;must see this one to fully appreciate the third one in this series with Bane.
3400;This movie isn't as great as I'd heard it was, but it was pretty good.
3401;Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon, though, is picture perfect.
3402;Still, it's a marked improvement (to say the least) over the direction the Burton/Schumacher Bat.
3403;With 7 big screen feature films under his utility belt (including Adam West, and Mask of the Phantasm), I feel the cinematic potential of Batman has yet to be fully exploited.
3404;it was full of excitement and adventure.
3405;To that end, Bale's portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman has given a wonderful performance of a man with deep psychological turmoil.
3406;"As an ""origin story"", like it has never been told on the big screen before, much credit to the direction, production and acting is deserved."
3407;But after meeting Henri Ducard, (decent performance by Liam Neeson), and suggested to turn his idea into an ideal, to then climb to the Cantonese Monastery is a bit of comic book ability.
3408;Nolan must keep the film to time and advance the storyline.
3409;A man on a mission.
3410;They were fun in a funny, Hollywood way.
3411;Batman, as told by the Frank Miller stories, is seriously dark and a tad twisted.
3412;"More likely, he's a ""rebel."
3413;This is why I feel Bale has brought the character directly from the Miller pages to the big screen so well.
3414;Perfectly spoken to Flass, Batman questions him of the whereabouts and nature of the drugs.
3415;"Batman responds with, ""Swear to me!"
3416;We see the beginnings of Batman who sometimes changes back to Bruce Wayne.
3417;Caine has truly revamped the importance Alfred plays out in Bruce's life.
3418;He is the moral compass that grounds Bruce to the Wayne name, and still keeps Batman on his feet!
3419;The relationship between the two shows a trust and professionalism of both actors who stay true to Miller's work.
3420;Caine is so talented that he can make the third to Bale and Freeman so believable.
3421;now that Batman is outfitted with all his toys, the Tumbler makes its way into the pinnacle of Batman's success.
3422;Katie Holmes did a fine job as Rachel Dawes.
3423;Nothing spectacular, compared to the A. list'ers here, she held her own.
3424;The flattened cop cars via the Tumbler.
3425;The crushed concrete lane dividers, the end of that entire Monorail system and it's last few carriages.
3426;THIS is exactly the Batman that was so beautifully drawn less than 20 years ago.
3427;A character who is suffering immensely and with all his wealth and family power, sleeps alone.
3428;"Batman Begins is an excellent movie that does an outstanding job of ""telling the story"" of how Bruce Wayne became Batman"
3429;See also the Quotes and Trivia page.
3430;almost all the ingredients to ensure a movie to be good are all included in this movie.
3431;i totally enjoyed this viewing experience.
3432;like spiderman series, giving these comics' characters with realistic emotions, love.
3433;that's why these movies were so good.
3434;the special effect, the graphics.
3435;Movie franchises are cherished commodities in Hollywood, when a studio finds a series of films that works well with audiences they will fight tooth and nail to hold on and capitalize on that success.
3436;popular `James Bond' series, the `Superman' franchise, `Star Wars', and `Batman'.
3437;With each of those examples, time away has produced strong box office numbers, and even with changes made with the cast and directors involved the success remains.
3438;The focus of this review is on one of the franchises listed above that after having huge success with 4 films, though the final installment was the weakest and turned fans off for some time, took an 8 year absence from the big screen and returned in the summer of 2005 with huge critical and commercial success.
3439;The franchise is `Batman', and the movie that put this franchise back on top, well technically it kick.
3440;"started a whole new `Batman' franchise, was Christopher Nolan's expertly crafted origin tale, ""Batman Begins""."
3441;"completely ignoring the previous 4 films from the original `Batman' franchise, ""Batman Begins"" delivers an in."
3442;depth look at the origins of the Dark Knight.
3443;notch cast, a superb director, and terrific writing.
3444;terrific writing, acting, and directing brought Batman back from the pits of movie hell and back onto the big screen.
3445;"With ""Batman Begins"" movie audiences finally learned how Bruce Wayne became Batman, and hope that future installments will continue to build on what was started here, and a great new `Batman' franchise will begin."
3446;"Don't get me wrong, the original `Batman' franchise was terrific for the most part, but based on ""Batman Begins"", this new franchise looks to take the Dark Knight's success to even greater heights."
3447;This movie was just so well done and awesome.
3448;The storyline too was very good.
3449;I love the way they set up for the sequel.
3450;I seen this film with high expectations, I've seen all the Batman films, and I liked them all, well, Batman and Robin was.
3451;Batman and Batman Returns were well done, and Batman Begins could easily compare.
3452;"Christian Bale is a magnificent actor, after I seen him in ""Reign of Fire"" and ""American Psycho""."
3453;the film has a large and effective cast.
3454;Micheal Caine, a great choice for Alfred, brings laughs and a warm heart.
3455;Katie Holmes plays Rachel Dodson, Batman's close friend and heart's interest.
3456;She's pretty good, compared to Kim Basinger and Nicole Kidman.
3457;Gary Oldman plays Gordon, Batman's friendly police officer, and does a good job at it too.
3458;the action was great, great car chase scene, and explosions and things crashing and smashing, and the fighting was good too, except the camera was awkward during fights, making the view close up and weird to distinguish between whats going on and who's getting hurt.
3459;something that bothered me was how it interacted with the first Batman film.
3460;"Memento and ""Insomnia"" director Christopher Nolan, along with ""Blade"" screenwriter David Goyer, has crafted a modern and more realistically grounded Bruce Wayne for the new millennium in his interesting yet flawed ""Batman Begins."
3461;He tells him of the League of Shadows, a society bent on seeking justice at any cost, swiftly and harshly.
3462;He makes Bruce an offer he can't refuse.
3463;He tells him he can make himself into an everlasting symbol.
3464;and finds his true calling.
3465;The cast is solid across the board, except for Katie Holmes who just doesn't seem woman enough yet for this role.
3466;Bale gives Bruce Wayne flesh.
3467;makes him real, genuine, human.
3468;Nolan and Goyer fill the script with terrifically refreshing popcorn dialogue that seems simultaneously based in realism.
3469;"He steals a train sequence right out from under Sam Raimi's nose from his astounding ""Spider."
3470;in the end, Nolan and company have refreshingly bring Batman back into familiar, dark, and gothic territory.
3471;He has made an interesting and plausible explanation for the beginnings of the legend, and given his story great acting weight to accompany it.
3472;He may have stumbled a bit along the way, but he does a fine enough job to make one genuinely mean this:It's good to have you back Batman!
3473;I love how they set up this classic comic book story.
3474;Batman is a very real person with lots of great toys and a passion for fighting injustice.
3475;and there is no better way to watch this than on Blu.
3476;ray is a great way to watch this action packed movie.
3477;Christian Bale is A+ in it!
3478;While most critics and fans prefer the first sequel, I still think Batman Begins is the best of the many Batman movies.
3479;All the actors are excellent, the vistas of the far East are breathtaking, the scenes in Gotham appropriately dark, and the tale established the Batman character quite capably.
3480;Really, it's an inspired retelling.
3481;The acting by Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman was superb!
3482;He is the best Batman since Michael Keaton.
3483;A very well written script and a fabulous cast!
3484;I was looking forward to this movie with intense anticipation.
3485;I have seen every single Batman movie, and I'm a huge fan of comic.
3486;book movies in general, with the Spiderman movies my all.
3487;I also respect the abilities of Welsh actor, Christian Bale, and everything I'd heard about this movie caused me to assume I'd love it.
3488;Here are some of the main reasons why:In Tim Burton's Batman, not only did Michael Keaton do a very good job of making Batman fascinatingly mysterious, the Bat Cave and Wayne Mansion, as his two personal spaces, both reflected his personality and added to his mysterious allure.
3489;In this new Batman, Director Nolan never shows Bruce Wayne in his own personal space at all the first half of the movie.
3490;I respect, too, the abilities of Irish actor, Liam Neeson, but he does a far better job playing tortured heroes than villains.
3491;Where a colorful, frightening villain is important in a regular action.
3492;adventure story, it is supremely vital in comic.
3493;Yes, it shows Bruce learning advanced martial arts in the Far East, but by the time he joins the Ninjas who teach him, he is already a superior martial artist, and we never learn how he has gotten that way.
3494;book heroes, most want to see in a Batman movie.
3495;my final complaint is with the use of setting in the film, both the actual sets of the movie and Director Nolan's use of lighting and camera shots.
3496;"Nolan focuses constant attention in Gotham City and in the Ninja camp on the ""atmospheric"" techniques of dark lighting and jerky camera shots that consistently interfere with the audience enjoying the main purpose of an action film."
3497;outstandingly choreographed and executed fight scenes.
3498;and is about as believable.
3499;This movie was really great.
3500;It all felt really real.
3501;I'm glad to finally see the movie writers for Batman get something right.
3502;This new Batman release, (Batman Begins) is the best Batman movie yet.
3503;Up to ten times better than the Keaton movies!!!
3504;screen 2 disc special edition like I did.
3505;full of goodies any DC comic book fan would enjoy.
3506;"This film is what the ""Batman"" series has been waiting for: a good solid foundation on which all of the crazies and the politics are based."
3507;I thought the screenplay, the script, was excellent because it told the story as a novel would, fleshing out necessary characters and giving the audience their motivation as well.
3508;I thought it was great to see where Comissioner Gordon started out and how Gotham became the center of all corruption.
3509;This first of the Batman Trilogy is the weakest in terms of performance and story however, I recommend watching this in order to get to the third and final of the series.
3510;Go ahead watch all three back to back, we loved it.
3511;I think this was the best of the trilogy with Christian Bale.
3512;More thoughtful and character driven.
3513;christian Bale is a favorite actor of mine, so that doesn't hurt!
3514;He always seems to bring more dimension to his characters.
3515;Batman Begins is the most unique, action.
3516;packed, and overall best Batman movie of all time.
3517;this is the one Batman flick where we get to see exactly how Batman came to be.
3518;overall, this Batman is great.
3519;filled with stunning action scenes and a good plot, this is a must.
3520;see movie for any and all Batman fans.
3521;It is packed with intriguing information about how and why Bruce became Batman, and we get to see the beginnings of the Batcave, the Bat signal, and a sweet new Batmobile (though it can never replace the original one!)
3522;while entertaining, they seemed more like that of a child's view of batman.
3523;christian bale is cast perfectly as batman, and the movie shows a more in depth look at batman's past before he ever wore the suit, and more importantly why he decides to become batman.
3524;the film is intelligent and well worth seeing several times over.
3525;Like everyone of us, I grew up with Batman.
3526;It has been an enduring image.
3527;i am suprised to say the least, the proper choice of words would be appalled, shocked and angered to see the way Batman was depicted in this movie.
3528;mark you, the story line is not too bad, and stellar performances by Michael Cain, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman are truly enjoyable.
3529;And then she has that crooked smile.
3530;She just didnt have the personality or presence required to pull off a crooked smile, let alone a role as that of a Batman romantic interest.
3531;Christopher Nolan brings a new and darker vision to the Batman franchise, and our new Batman couldn't have been a more perfect fit.
3532;In this film we go to the roots of the character of Bruce Wayne, and that is what is so special about this film.
3533;Bruce Wayne now uses what he learned from his journey in the east to enforce justice in the west.
3534;He is aided by his good butler Alfred, and a man who works at the abandoned technology wing of his father's corporation, played by Morgan Freeman.
3535;This brings us to the antagonist of the film, well actually there is no real main nemesis for Batman in this film.
3536;This leads Batman to discover a bigger plot.
3537;That is a major theme in this film, the theme of starting over and rebuilding.
3538;It seems like a good theme given that this is exactly what this movie is doing to the Batman franchise.
3539;It introduces interesting ideas and has a continuing social commentary on society, which has been plagued by corruption from the times of monarchy up until now.
3540;What is really noteworthy of this movie is the score of Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard.
3541;These two long time friends worked closely together to deliver a very dark and intense score.
3542;It's obvious that Zimmer had the greater influence on the score, but you can feel a good deal of Howard's style as well.
3543;The score compliments the new dark vision of Batman perfectly, and it really adds depth to the character of Bruce Wayne.
3544;This is the perfect action film, with an amazing cast, a dark look on society, and an intense climax.
3545;aCTING: Christian Bale fills the shoes perfectly.
3546;This is the new Batman for this new vision.
3547;Those actors are better suited for the comic book version of the series.
3548;What amazes me is that Christian Bale is such a natural actor, he has never taken an acting lesson in his life yet manages to pull such interesting characters.
3549;Micheal Caine makes a perfect Alfred, the old and wise Butler.
3550;Liam Neeson is great in his role, but his character always seems a mystery to the audience.
3551;I kind of felt like I wanted to know his background too.
3552;I believe he is the most versatile actor we have.
3553;I think he did a great job, but I also think maybe someone older should of played that role.
3554;Although he was able to capture the menacing feel of that character perfectly.
3555;Katie Holmes plays the long time friend and love interest of Bruce Wayne, and she does a good job as well.
3556;bOTTOM LINE: A film I really enjoyed.
3557;A darker and more disturbed vision guides this new Batman to great heights.
3558;Christopher Nolan is a director who knows how to create atmosphere.
3559;He did it with Memento, he most certainly did it with Insomnia, and now he brings an amazing atmosphere to Batman Begins.
3560;Great acting, great directing, and great music combine to make Batman Begins not only a summer blockbuster but a film with character and plot.
3561;Batman Returns carried the unreality a little far).
3562;There are so many good ways to portray him!)
3563;eyed, and, though some may say the movie was just too long, I loved every minute of it!
3564;Very good compliant to Japanese Language and subtitle.
3565;i recommend to Japanese users !
3566;It is the best of the live action Batman movies.
3567;It captures what made the comic books so good unlike the Burton/Schumacher era or as I call them: Burmachers.
3568;Christian Bale is a great Bruce Wayne and a good Batman!
3569;Before Bale the best of the Batmen was Adam West and considering he played Batman for camp that ain't a good thing.3.
3570;This flick should get an Oscar!
3571;It is the cinematic definition of shock and awe!
3572;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
3573;Great effects, very good plot line.
3574;well worth the money and a good change from the previous Batman titles (which, I thought were very good .
3575;hey, it's from a COMIC BOOK)!
3576;I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and will probably watch it several more times.
3577;Batman Begins scored very well earning five full stars in my book.
3578;It portrayed for the first time on the big screen the origins of the bat providing a good story and script, fine performances, excellent costumes, great sets coordinated with corresponding miniatures and CGI.
3579;this may have been the first time that picture real computer images were produced by mapping actual city photos onto wire frame models of Gotham City with breathtaking results.
3580;christian Bale's portrayal of Batman in this movie is as definitive as Christopher Reeve's performance of Superman.
3581;Bale had the charisma of Bruce Wayne, and the darkness of Bruce Wayne as well.
3582;"I will also say that this is Bale's best performance since ""American Psycho""To classify this as a comic book movie would be wrong."
3583;It is actually a realistic view of what Batman would be like in today's world.
3584;the extras are very good.
3585;"It will gain new fans, and win back old fans who were turned away with the turd sandwich that was ""Batman and Robin""."
3586;A great start to a wonderful trilogy.
3587;It's a Batman film, and Joel Schumacher had nothing to do with it.
3588;Also, Cillian Murphy has really pretty eyes.
3589;This is one of the exceptions.
3590;It's not only as good as you've heard, it's actually even better.
3591;For the first time, a Batman film has succeeded completely in capturing all of the elements of the fabled comic book character while also producing a Batman that seems fully grounded in reality.
3592;the idea of going back to the character's origins was a master stroke and serves the story well.
3593;Here we get the most detailed on.
3594;Much credit must also go to Christian Bale in the title role.
3595;it helps that he also looks good in a tuxedo.
3596;The whole appeal of Batman was always that as Bruce Wayne by day, he was the biggest playboy this side of James Bond.
3597;Bale's got the acting chops and the look to nail this in a minute.
3598;the movie also benefits from a strong supporting cast.
3599;But where this detracted from Batman in the earlier films, it works here because Nolan keeps the story centered where it ought to be, on the Dark Knight.
3600;The movie gets this exactly right and you're likely to be thrown by a nifty twist involving this character.
3601;still this movie is a treat and stands along with Sam Raimi's Spiderman films as the new benchmark by which all superhero films will be measured.
3602;What you will see are Christopher Nolan's psychological (and if somewhat ponderous) analyses into the nature of guilt and fear.
3603;"The ""franchise"" is a venerable one
3604;And, so far, it's worked real well.
3605;This is a carefully orchestrated, very clever publicity campaign to focus attention.
3606;Look beneath the surface, children: Hollywood, like spyware, knows you very well and wants what you have .
3607;If you don't, the standard version is fine.
3608;I would recommend this film to my best friends to view.
3609;Christian Bale's portrayal of The Batman was the best.
3610;Michael Caine's portrayal of Alfred was very good.
3611;The first of a solid three movies by Christopher Nolan.
3612;The guy is a genius!
3613;This is the best Batman movie yet.
3614;This movie is filled with tons of awesome action, special effects, and great acting.
3615;It's my favorite Batman film.
3616;You have to see it!
3617;This is the best Batman movie for some time it is because everything in this movie is good.
3618;For the story, it is good because it talks about how the Batman Begins.
3619;For the acting, I can't say that Christian Bale is the best for Batman but he is suitable to act as Batman.
3620;He is somewhat better than George Clooney where he stars as Batman in """"Batman and Robin"""" in 1997."""
3621;For the direction, it is awesome because since this movie is truly exciting, no doubt to say that it is good.
3622;For the visuals, it is perfect because you know, if it is a good movie, the visual must play a part of it.
3623;So, it is good overall.
3624;disc deluxe edition, it is good to make this because for disc 2, I can search more about Batman and it is nice that this movie is with the comic book in it.
3625;Batman Begins(No doubt that it is good, it is a must.
3626;Batman Returns(This movie is very memorable, especially the second half of the movie, first, the catwoman is being banished by the Penguin, then, after the city was distroyed by the Penguin, Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle know their true identity to Batman and Catwoman.
3627;Batman Forever(Maybe after a few years after Batman Returns, it brings some fresh look between this and that.)
3628;Batman Begins is on par with Tim Burton's first Batman.
3629;BATMAN BEGINS keeps to the Frank Miller version of BATMAN.
3630;the darkness Burton opened with in his first film, is surpassed here by this extended origin tale.
3631;Although, no obvious influence comes from Frank Miller graphic novel storyline Batman: Year One, this is still a superior comicbook movie, which says alot since Spiderman (1 and 2) upped the bar for the genre.
3632;bale is really believable as the driven, haunted Bruce Wayne, Caine is really believable and fun as Alfred, Morgan Freeman is believable and shrewd as Fox, Gary Oldman is believable in any role, his Pre.
3633;Congrats', to all who decided for Batman NOT to end up with a girlfriend in the end.
3634;Overall, a great beginning, I look foward to more.
3635;Here in San Francisco the house was completely packed at the huge, sprawling IMAX cinema at Fourth and Mission.
3636;After all the brouhaha about Katie Holmes' supposed inadequacy in the part of Rachel, I was surprised to see how good she is.
3637;For me, she has always been up and down.
3638;Anyhow her Rachel here was just as good as her Rachel in DISTURBING BEHAVIOR.
3639;five feet tall and she's a good enough actress to hold her own in scenes opposite many old pros who chew every piece of scenery they find.
3640;(It is pretty long, you definitely get your money's worth.)
3641;I hope they will give us Christian Bale's screen test!
3642;First off, the movie is excellent with adventure, great villains, intrigue, etc.
3643;Acting and direction and special effects are all stellar.
3644;Nolan delivered one great movie.
3645;i am a huge fan of the Spider Man movies.
3646;Audio is great as well.
3647;When Joel Schumacher destroyed the other Batman series, the best thing to do is start over aagain and make it better.
3648;Batman Begins is definitley the best Batman film, the best film of the year and it's definitley a masterpiece.
3649;Don't get me wrong, Michael Keaton is still a great Batman, but Bale was a greater Batman and a greater Bruce Wayne.
3650;one thing I love about this film is that it shows a very good relationship between Bruce and Alfred {Caine},, like it shows how much of a father figure he is.
3651;Cillian Murphy brings out a brilliant performance as Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow and Katie Holmes was a good additional character to this film.
3652;It's definitley worth every penny and you won't be disappointent.
3653;strong storytelling, character development, good visuals .
3654;"Batman Begins feels like a completely new Batman, because in many ways it is
3655;The striking difference with """"Begins"""" is the details: believable city, sharp humor, developed characters ."""
3656;with the exception of the original .
3657;given the constraints of a prequel, and being confined to telling the origin of everything now familiar to the audience, the results are very solid.
3658;It is immensely satisfying to watch the now famous Batman staples (Batcave, Batsuit, Batmobile, Batblades) come to fruition.
3659;gotham City is improved as well.
3660;Another bonus is the humor.
3661;In one great scene, a slightly intoxicated Bruce Wayne dismisses all his freeloading, brown.
3662;and watches with delight as they leave.
3663;"Additionally, there is subtle humor employed during a chase scene (""At least tell me what it looks like."
3664;Each adds lightness to an otherwise dark, intense, fast.
3665;that, to its entirety, emphasizes the strengths of the film: it feels genuine.
3666;cast, and the acting is very good.
3667;Amidst all the internal and external conflicts, it's a wonder Bruce can soar at all.
3668;Perhaps this adds to the heroic charisma of our Caped Crusader?
3669;"small criticism aside, ""Begins"" is a soaring success."
3670;Notably, the final frame featuring the Bat signal and foreshadowing of the Joker's wrath on Gotham brings the movie to an effective end, and the Batman saga to its appropriate original beginning.
3671;Given Nolan's strong direction, it views like a prequel and a new saga all in one.
3672;Batman Begins is a movie that is a summer movie anomaly .
3673;it is entertaining AND sharply written.
3674;Though it is a prequel, Batman Begins gives new wings to a fluttering franchise.
3675;great film, love watching from time to time.
3676;While Star Wars had the great visuals, Batman brings the entire batcave.
3677;The visuals are great and yet more real, adding a plausible flavor.
3678;it is by far more superior to the other films.
3679;The other movies in the series, while satisfactory entertaining (well, not Batman and Robin), are not plot driven and too many characters take the center stage.
3680;Supporting films like this one encourages Hollywood to produce films with strong stories and excellent direction.
3681;Most true Bat fans know that in the Dark Knight's 60+ year history, he has had re.
3682;this film has a strong narrative which is why so many movie critics from Roger Ebert to Jeffery Lions have complemented this film.
3683;This is a film deserving of repeat showings.
3684;the second disk has plenty of extras and it is outlined in the form of a comic book.
3685;We had movie night at my sisters new place after i told her how great Dark Night Rises.
3686;This was a great time for all of us.
3687;He is in prison due to his personal journey to gain wisdom about the nature of evil.
3688;Much of his wisdom and skill comes from intense training in ninjutsu and other martial arts while he is aptly ingesting all of the physical, spiritual, and philosophical parts of his training.
3689;The scene also illustrates the internalized guilt that Bruce possesses due to his fears that frequently haunt his dreams with his personal nightmarish nemesis .
3690;This lengthy beginning is essential in order for the audience to build a complete understanding of Bruce's persona, as he struggles to understand himself within a diverse and unjust world.
3691;Nonetheless, Nolan accomplishes to keep the audience's attention with his hypnotic storytelling that has splashes of wit and insightfulness.
3692;batman Begins provides an authentic image of Batman's true dark character, as he struggles with what is right and wrong.
3693;Through this personal struggle of Batman, Nolan does a wonderful job in depicting a genuine society where things are not black and white, as he brings the film into the gray zone where nothing is completely clear.
3694;This ambiguousness is vital, as it also heavily deals with the emotion fear.
3695;The camerawork and the darkness in the film enhances the element of fear in a brilliant manner.
3696;one of my favorite takes on Batman!
3697;love that I have on my kindle so I can take with me on vacation!
3698;Batman Begins is a great reboot for the Batman franchise.
3699;This film does a great job of not just leading into the Dark Knight, but being a stand.
3700;This was one of the greatest batman movies i ever seen prior to the dark knight.
3701;I mean afterall I always thought no one can do batman as good as Micheal Keaton.
3702;I reccomend everyone to watch this and the sequel to it The Dark Knight.
3703;Batman Begins puts Batman into the real world, while at the same time perfectly capturing the mystique of the comic.
3704;First the casting of Christian Bale was right on.
3705;I've seen Bale in many pictures from Shakespeare to psycho, so I was confident he would do a good job, but he did better than expected.
3706;He captured the duality of Bruce Wayne/Batman perfectly.
3707;The story is strong,the special affects are not overdone and the acting is perfect.
3708;Plus it sets up perfectly for a sequal.
3709;Damn good movie with a great cast.
3710;There was a time in the early 2000s that a slew of comic book adaptations were made.
3711;As the title suggest the first half of the movie is Batman's origin story.
3712;This is a movie that has Batman grounded in the real world.
3713;Even women that I know who don't like super hero movies love, that's right, LOVE, this movie.
3714;i thought the movie was good for an action film,but for a Batman movie ,NO.
3715;someone said that this makes the joker more real,like batman is real in the first place,he is a fantasy character,no human can do that stuff.
3716;well at least the cartoons usually stick to the original story line.
3717;Thankfully, director Chris Nolan saw this as an opportunity to do justice to the series, as well as completely reinvent it to peak the interest back into the original Batman fans, as well as create completely new fans for the new millennium.
3718;batman Begins is a spectacular visual feast that not only exercises visual style, but focuses more on Batman as a character as opposed to how flashy his suit or how many things his Batmobile can do.
3719;and I think fans of the comic book will find this one especially interesting because this is probably the darkest Batman flick, both visually and thematically and definitely stays truer to its origins.
3720;i was also very pleased to see The Scarecrow villain in Batman Begins, being a huge fan of his from the animated series on Fox sometime ago.
3721;"aside from all that, I thought Batman Begins had a strong story going for it, answering all the right questions I've always had about how Batman became Batman
3722;Award winner and Oscar nominee for his 2000 screenplay, Memento, Director Christopher Nolan delivers a powerful punch and a believable plot set in a very realistic Gotham City.
3723;Christian Bale performs admirably as the sometimes Bi.
3724;Cillian Murphy masterfully plays the Scarecrow, a. k. a. Dr. Jonathan Crane, and stays true the psychotic, fear inducing character created by Finger and Kane for the original Batman series.
3725;The scenes illustrating Bruce in training with the League of Shadows, remind us that unlike other mutated or alien superheroes, Wayne is just a man"
3726;In opposition to Wayne's agenda, is the powerful Ra's who believes the best way to create balance is to destroy most of humanity.
3727;When will screen writers learn that women will still go see a sci.
3728;brilliant Michael Caine as Alfred, was a superb casting choice.
3729;like and sometimes heavy handed, Caine delivers the best portrayal of Wayne's caretaker since Alan Napier.
3730;"boys/girls will enjoy the ""new"" look of the Caped Crusader's ride based on the art of Frank Miller (The Dark Knight Returns)."
3731;it has been a long time since the public had the opportunity to see Batman as he should be: dark, pining, credible and absolutely fantastic!
3732;Christian Bale is excellent as Bruce Wayne / Batman.
3733;Christopher Nolan's directing is impressive.
3734;The screenplay by Nolan and David S. Goyer (who also wrote the Blade Movies) and the story by Goyer is brilliant.
3735;The music by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer is very impressive.
3736;The cinematography (Oscar nominated) by Wally Pfister is excellent.
3737;The film editing by Lee Smith is excellent.
3738;The casting by John Papsidera and Lucinda Syson is excellent.
3739;The production design by Nathan Crowley is very impressive.
3740;The art direction by Peter Francis, Stuart Kearns, Paul Kirby, Simon Lamont, Steven Lawrence, David Lee, Patrick Lumb, Shane Valentino, Su Whitaker is very impressive.
3741;The set decoration by Paki Smith is very impressive.
3742;The costume design by Lindy Hemming is very impressive.
3743;"This is one of the year's best and one of the best comic book movies in recent history since ""Spider."
3744;This movie outside of the original Batman is probably the best Batman flick ever.
3745;action Batman film to actually focus on.
3746;While the other films recognized the importance of developing the villian, Batman Begins realizes the importance of developing the hero.
3747;"I loved ""Batman Begins"" overall, especially because it stays true to its title and focuses on Batman's origins."
3748;It is also very dark and brings Batman back to his brooding film noirish roots.
3749;"Christopher Nolan was an ideal choice for director given his film noir past with ""Memento"" ""Insomnia"" and ""Following"", but I suspect that a well."
3750;"(""Batman Forever"" was an OK change of pace, and fit Jim Carrey, it doesn't deserve to be lumped in the same category as it's successor.)"
3751;Batman Begins is a near perfect film, though I think it took a terrible wrong.
3752;"head competition with a pretty good film when you have the opportunity to correct utter garbage like ""Batman and Robin"" ?"
3753;That is until a ballsy director and writer came along, those people being Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer, and FIXED Batman.
3754;Nolan, has MORE than proved he can deliver a dark and gritty Batman film without turning it into dark camp like Burton,or something so insane and flamboyant it would never happen, like Schumacher.
3755;Everything felt like a fantastic set, but what Nolan does, is give us something that exists.
3756;Part of the nature of this film is the internal.
3757;It really surprised me how good this movie was.
3758;It had brilliant acting and Batman was really cool.
3759;the movie is great, I love the price I got it for, it shipped very fast and arrived very quickly and of course, it played great.
3760;Timely Dad, the esteemed and hugely affluent Thomas Wayne, quickly descends the well shaft, offering therapy in the form of mechanically compassionate eyes and bite.
3761;sized moralisms, and Bruce's crying subsides.
3762;even required impressive quantities of antiseptic .
3763;until he mistakes costumed actors for bats while attending the opera and (surprise!)
3764;moving dialogue, and Alfred claiming surrogate.
3765;dad status, the film indulges a fully mature Bruce (Christian Bale) self.
3766;His physical prowess, brooding glances, and witty quips better argue for a curious intellectual in search of higher meaning, a man rejecting the vacuousness of his inheritance and formal education to evolve into something more authentically self.
3767;wielding cronies with grace and uncanny precision while sound creates a palpable impression of terror.
3768;His greatest skills culminate in an assault equal parts feasible, heroic, and bone.
3769;sized round jaw and curled tongue.
3770;the most exciting bit was the Batmobile 'Tumbler' sequence.
3771;The action is turned up 30 notches in realistic 'French Conncetion' style ode, and really delivers a roar.
3772;job well donei thought to myself why would i want to see a movie about how it was in the beginning but i'm glad i still watch it, Beautiful cinematography.
3773;This is how Batman should be done!I love the other batman mostly of course Micheal Keaton but Christian Bale did a great job
3774;this is not only the best Batman movie out there but one of the top five best action/adventure movies I've ever seen!!
3775;batman has always been one of my favorite superheros but one that has rarely been well captured on screen.
3776;He's basically a regular, more.
3777;It really captures the soul of the Dark Knight.
3778;Christian Bale is a perfect choice to play this character.
3779;I can't say enough positive things about this approach, it's exactly how I have always pictured the character.
3780;the pacing nears perfection, the action is gripping and extremely well choreographed, the acting is top rate, the writing is fantastic, and the cinematography is outstanding.
3781;Rarely is a known story done so originally and well.
3782;I love the depth of the characters, the splashes of humor, and the low.
3783;And, despite the fact that we all have a pretty good idea of the plot it is surprisingly original.
3784;I am also very impressed with how they show Gotham being very much like any large US city today yet demonstrate in a realistic and believable manner how a masked superhero and fantastic villians can fit in that context.
3785;This is a dream come true.
3786;I recommend this movie all the time,including my film teacher.
3787;I must say he is the best Batman hands down.
3788;Now that would be a big statement coming from a huge fan of the comics.
3789;I base my decision on Bale's incredible skills of performing real moves of martial arts.
3790;for the first time i finally see batman actually use his elbows as well as his knees to take down some of his foes.
3791;I recommend this film for hardcore Batman fans and those who are just introduced to the franchise.
3792;I will recommend amazon as the best way to order your movies despite me being somewhat disappointed b/c this movie did not include closed caption.
3793;Batman Begins is true to those ideals.
3794;Michael Caine can be funny.
3795;But you always suspected that Alfred was kind of wry, involved but seemingly above it all.
3796;Liam Neeson was a good choice, kind of like Costner, willing to take a second, supporting role.
3797;year old humor and a hot Dunst.
3798;Avenger started out fairly tight and evolved into oddballs and flatulent humor.
3799;This movie, unpretentious, is fairly serious and hence you take it seriously.
3800;In my opinion, Batman Begins is the best Batman movie ever made.
3801;Christian Bale plays the role of Bruce Wayne superbly.
3802;It is here where he meets childhood sweetheart, Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes).
3803;caine plays the part of Alfred very well.
3804;He is memorable in this role as a good guy.
3805;He will do anything and everything to stay in this position.
3806;cop, Jim Gordon, who helps Batman in any way he can.
3807;Nice to see Oldman in this role.
3808;lots of good action and fight scenes follow in this very.
3809;This movie doesn't just raise the benchmark for comic to big screen translations, it reestablishes the more subtle and realistic style of action flick.
3810;It's well written, directed deftly and manages to be both true to the essence of Batman and a worthy movie unto itself.
3811;That said, this is a good version of Batman.
3812;packed, and if you like that, then you will love this movie.
3813;Either this or Sin City is going to the best summer movie of next summer.
3814;I think the idea of making a Batman prequel is the best Warner Bros has come up with so far.
3815;He's probley my favirte Batman villian, so it's good to see him on the big screen.
3816;The movie looks so cool and I can't wait to see it.
3817;I'll write an offical review when I see the movie.
3818;The two DC comic book superheroes have always been like night and day, with Batman prowling Gotham City at night relying on only his finely honed human abilities while Superman uses his superpowers for truth, justice, and the American way.
3819;Batman is his true face.
3820;Then he must return to Gotham City and transform himself into a creature of the night whose very appearance will terrorize the criminals and supply himself with the gadgets that will give him a fighting chance on the streets.
3821;Every time Batman starts fighting the images are on the screen long enough that I can tell it is a new shot but then we are on to the next one while I try to make sense of the jumbled images of these fight scenes.
3822;He builds up his body, studies science and decides to become a masked vigilante, taking as his inspiration a bat that flies against a window of Wayne Manor.
3823;Noland and Goyer provide more depth to the origin, which adds to the depth of the character as well, which is why I rounded up on this one in the end.
3824;few will be surprised that Christian Bale has no problems playing the Dark Knight, and a supporting cast that offers by Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman is pretty impressive for a comic book movie.
3825;If you love comic book movies.
3826;Identifying this form of evil was worthwhile.
3827;"oh yes: Some great comic book ""splash panels,"" mostly at the end."
3828;A dramatic view into the beginnings of the caped crusader with all the cause and effect relationships well in place.
3829;an insight into what is to come.
3830;a most entertaining film for the entire family and especially for Batman fans.
3831;This is, hands down, the finest movie I have seen in years.
3832;It stands on its own and shines in its darkness.
3833;batman Begins ranks with Superman: The Movie as the greatest comic adaptation of all time.
3834;But it transcends being a comic adaptation.
3835;It's a stellar movie all on its own.
3836;hans Zimmer's is simple, riviting, emotional.
3837;A score can make or break a film, and Zimmer once again does not disappoint.
3838;man scores are, and it even eclipses Elfman's Batman scores.
3839;he is an artist, and this will be the pivotal moment in his career, much as Jaws was for Spielberg.
3840;The press leading up to this film noted that Nolan effortlessly pulled the whole thing together, turning in the film on time and on budget, as though already he had years of experience directing big budget epics.
3841;She rose to the challenge of her more seasoned costars, delivering an excellent performance that hopefully will result in her character's return in future films.
3842;Having a female interest who returns in a Batman film is a chance for Bruce Wayne to truly develop emotionally.
3843;And it can even lead to the catalyst for the much.
3844;i reiterate, this is the finest movie, end to end, that I've seen a long while.
3845;these are all films that I've loved in this decade and watched again and again.
3846;If those movies were home runs in their own right, Batman Begins is a grand slam.
3847;Bale does a good job.
3848;Good story line, not just fighting.
3849;A little old on the technology front, but makes it a little more genuine.
3850;This is Batman back to basics.
3851;This movie brings Batman back to that circle of the human factor and focuses more on the human side of Batman unlike the other fluffy Batman movies.
3852;being a long time Batman reader and fan I recommend this movie.
3853;I bought this for my son for Christmas, and it is amazing.
3854;Also loved that they shipped it and it got to me in just a few days!!
3855;Christian Bale is the best Bat Man ever!
3856;This movie is awesome on every level from the script to the fight scenes.
3857;I agree with all the positive reviews of this entertaining and well.
3858;i am very glad I saw Batman Begins at the IMAX.
3859;The sound was big and rich, the images crystal clear.
3860;I did hear a little boy cry for a minute at the very beginning because the colossal screen and full sounds are a new experience for those of us who do most of our viewing in front of a comparatively much smaller TV screen.
3861;the best way to experience this ab.
3862;fab movie is @ the IMAX.
3863;I consider Batman Begins to be a whole new Batman franchise.
3864;baring that in mind, I approached Batman Begins with fresh perspective.
3865;I found it to be good but not great.
3866;i'm sure there are lots of people out there that loved this movie.
3867;Sometimes the voice is so raspy you can close your eyes and picture him on the porcelain throne, straining as best he can.
3868;Well, Nolan's first major film since INSOMNIA is a nice combination of action and horror (believe it or not)and it provides an interesting thesis on human being's repsonses to fear.
3869;Arty, original, and highly impressive production.
3870;wise, this movie isn't for all tastes but it is a unique picture for those who want a new Batman and for a new vision of a superhero.
3871;The greatest superhero movie ever it is NOT, but if you can handle its brutality and nightmarish realism (basically), you may find it to be the best film of the year.
3872;It will certainly take you by surprise.
3873;Great Beginning to a Trilogy!!
3874;Comes full circle when you see the 3rd Batman movie.
3875;Definitely a good movie, Batman Begins, brings to the screen exactly what the title indicates: the story of Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman.
3876;on the positive side: a) The WONDERFUL cast which includes Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Rutger Hauer, Morgan Freeman, and Ken Watanabe among others, who have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!
3877;Consequently, they have done a superb job of providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.
3878;in conclusion, Batman Begins is a movie definitely worth watching as it is guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment.
3879;nolans reimagining of the classic vigilanties story is perfectly executed with this vst back to the well known origins of batman and bruce wayne, played perfectly by Bale
3880;Christian Bale makes a good Batman as well.
3881;Scarecrow is cool vilian I like the gas as a weapon and how the screen got all distorted when he used it and how is voice sounded when he put on the mask.
3882;All in all this look like the begining of a good new franchise.
3883;Kids would, at first, wonder: Is this really Batman?
3884;Haha, this is actually a good thing, because the depth that builds within the character.
3885;power, but rather it's enhanced because it shows how prepared Bruce Wayne is to now take on the Gotham underworld.
3886;It is one of my favorites.
3887;As a youngster I loved the earlier versions for their glamour and action, and as an adult I love the newer movie for its inspiration and powerful story.
3888;This is absolutely the best Batman portrayal outside of the source material, and surely one of the top three or four superhero films ever made.
3889;despite some significant revisions to the character's universe, the film gets the most important aspects right.
3890;Batman Begins comes as close as anything I've seen to fulfilling that vision.
3891;The Dark Knight is great Joker movie.
3892;This is a great Batman movie.
3893;rIP Heath as this is one of his finest performances, a great take on the Joker.
3894;Fantastic effects, great cast, and well put together.
3895;This was a really good movie.
3896;my brother and my dad even liked it which is unusual.
3897;It was a gift for someone who likes the batman movies . . . . . . . . .
3898;keep up the good work and service.
3899;Just as good as the Original!A classic revived!Christan Bale rocks.5 Stars all the way!
3900;There's some neat mini movie posters and a batman jump drive.
3901;batman Begins is one of those movies that captivates your attention.
3902;it's a great movie, and Batman's now my FAVORITE super hero.
3903;chris Nolan did a great job putting this film together, and has the BEST choice of actors.
3904;The supporting actors are great.
3905;The movie, itself is spectacular, and the gift set is really cool.
3906;Batman Begins the movie rules.
3907;disc special edition I received as a gift, that was ordered through Amazon, has two major flaws.
3908;That notwithstanding, it was still an enjoyable experience on second viewing.
3909;Casting of Liam Neeson in the type of role here was a little unusual given his past casted roles, but spectacular action scenes and good use of martial arts and swordwork.
3910;I am not a Batman fan, of either the comic strip, TV show or previous movie versions, but I thoroughly enjoyed this adaption.
3911;All of the actors did an excellent job, especially Gary Oldham .
3912;The movie did not drag and I look forward to more adaptions featuring this winning combination of director, actors, writing, etc.
3913;Batman is more than a superhero, more than movie and comic book entertainment.
3914;He is the dark part of the subconcious that lurks in all of us.
3915;batman is more than a cultural icon.
3916;He is a legend and a myth.
3917;In the astounding Batman Begins, the myth is reborn.
3918;christian Bale is perfect to play Bruce Wayne, the billionaire who is orphaned when a mugger kills his mother and father in cold blood.
3919;like athleticism and dark, brooding demeanor made me confident that Bale was worthy to inherit the mantle of Batman.
3920;For those of you who liked the Matrix, I highly recommend you check out Equilibrium.
3921;"in ""Begins,"" director Christopher Nolan (Memento) and screenplay co. writer David Goyer explore how Wayne adopts his alter ego."
3922;the talent in this movie is astounding.
3923;al. ghul, powerful head of a spiritual, ninja.
3924;All of Neeson's dialouge is highly quotable and inspiring.
3925;wayne returns to Gotham City.
3926;His childhood friend, played by Katie Holmes, knows something is up.
3927;Her target is Arkham Asylum, run by the enigmatic Professor Jonathan Crane (played by the amazing Cillian Murphy).
3928;the Wayne's family butler Alfred is played by Michael Caine.
3929;A younger Police Commissioner Gordon is played to perfection by the chameleon.
3930;I have enjoyed the entire Batman series.
3931;I enjoyed this one also.
3932;The action and music is great.
3933;"like with any ""first in series"" movie, alot of backstory and becoming of the character takes place."
3934;This is the way to do it!
3935;In this one, acting goes from good to extraordinary good.
3936;Cinematography is excellent, darkish, ominous looking, just can't be any better.
3937;Stunts and fight sequences are magnificent.
3938;So Batman is a goody.
3939;In this movie they go to the borderline, and the actors perform their own stunts most of the time, adding realism to the action.
3940;Thus, the fighting sequences are great.
3941;ups and with fast editing.
3942;Bruce Lee did it best 30 years ago.
3943;All his fighting scenes are shot from a distance, so the viewer can see the whole body of the hero and his foes.
3944;that said, this Batman is the real thing.
3945;I hope the sequels are equally relevant to the saga.
3946;In this movie is called The Tumbler and I assure you, is the coolest, greatest Batmobile ever.
3947;It's sooo wonderful that they should get Detroit to manufacure so people could drive it to the supermarket or kids to school.
3948;The movie and bonus disk are authentic.
3949;notch cast directed by a capable director in a intense, atmospheric, and psychological film that's easily among the most idealogically faithful comic adaptations to date.
3950;fans of the comics will be thrilled by the integrity in the characters and plot.
3951;fans will also enjoy masterful performances by A. list actors in a storyline that makes it seem perfectly reasonable for a grown man to dress up like a giant bat.
3952;Batman Begins takes the movie Batman to a whole new level.
3953;made superhero with all the cool gadgets.
3954;It takes a more serious approach and quite frankly its refreshing.
3955;Christopher Nolan has done what Tim Burton never did, and thats what makes this movie so great.
3956;Not to mention the great special effects and story behind it all.
3957;I love the dark side of Batman and that made this movie a little better than a playful hero.
3958;Nolan meanwhile does give a sense of realism to the madness of the city and it's hero and that's where the movie big surprise is.
3959;I think that this is a great come back for the series and I hope there will be a sequel to it to see where Batman goes from there.
3960;This up to date Batman Begins so far shows lows of promiss.
3961;And the second that followed Darknight was great!
3962;So its strange and nice to seen imprements they made over the years.
3963;Batman has had his ups and downs in cinema, beginning with a 1940's serial to a campy 1960's series.
3964;Director and writer Christopher Nolan and writer David S. Goyer have re.
3965;bruce heads abroad to study with a society that has mysterious purposes.
3966;"The final quarter of the movie is spectacular and not only provides a worthy end to this movie, but makes a great beginning to the next film ""The Dark Knight."
3967;Several factors that help make this movie a joy to watch for fans of the Batman.
3968;first, the technology is somewhat accessible and logical.
3969;There are technologies that are rooted in science fiction, but much of what we see in the movie either exists or could exist.
3970;second, the special effects are phenomenal.
3971;last, the actors in this film are excellent choices for their roles.
3972;Christian Bale is excellent and believable as the Dark Knight.
3973;"Michael Caine is the imperturbable butler Alfred (Michael Caine and Christian Bale made another memorable appearance together the year after this film in ""The Prestige"")."
3974;Many other great actors helped make this movie seem very real, including Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Gary Oldman, and Katie Holmes.
3975;I hope the films that follow will get the hint.
3976;michael Caine has a wonderful comedic influence on this semi.
3977;More power to this actor!
3978;It is certainly a long way from The Hand.
3979;this film is a new conceptualization of Gotham and its residents.
3980;the character of Jonathan Crane was well played.
3981;i highly recommend this movie!
3982;"we finally learn where Batman gets ""All those wonderful toys""."
3983;a great flick for comic fans and anyone who likes action and a great story.
3984;I really enjoyed the movie and Christian Bale.
3985;It was very good audio and picture.
3986;I have always liked him.
3987;I'm Hoping Nolan brings in Guy Pearce as Joker for Part II.
3988;One of the best movie adaptation games out there.
3989;page comic book and is for true Batman fans or those who really appreciate seeing just how much the format can offer.Your choice!The Movie:Batman Begins, this summer's entry into the Batman film legacy, redefines the series.
3990;"Director Christopher Nolan, who has already captivated me with his takes on ""Memento"" and the Al Pacino vehicle, ""Insomnia"" finds the story and the star to tell it."
3991;The result is that this film is far and away the best of the five, and edges out the third film in the Star Wars trilogy for the best big screen adventure movie of the year, so far.
3992;making process he takes with Alfred (the outstanding Michael Caine) to build the Batcave, and find the identity of the hero who will finally make criminals feel his presence.
3993;the actual battle scenes are tense and inspiring, the Batmobile is undoubtedly a star of the movie all on its own.
3994;This is a real movie!
3995;Great installment to the first two movies.
3996;This is my favorite movie, second only to the epic of Superman:The Movie.
3997;anyways, along with the feature film, the making of and other featurettes are enjoyable as well.
3998;Until Superman returns, this is the best update to a comic franchise yet.
3999;it's an amazing gift for any batman fan or any movie fan!
4000;director and film magician Christopher Nolan, the dark knight is given a new face, a detailed back story, and, most of all, a newer, fresher, and darker tone.
4001;"Fueled by a knockout performance by Christian Bale and a great supporting cast that includes Katie Holmes, Tom Wilkinson, Cillian Murphy, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, and the magnificent Michael Caine as Alfred the Butler, Nolan's first installment in his acclaimed ""Dark Knight"" Trilogy set up audiences for an incredible introspective take on the character, and changed superhero movies forever."
4002;It comes with no real bonus features other than the theatrical trailer, but it's fine because the film is the real gem here.
4003;While do love most of Nolan's special features (Memento's 2.
4004;disc Edition is a masterpiece in its own right apart from the equally magnificent film), it's just such a great deal to get the single.
4005;disc version, Nolan has a way of making even the making.
4006;of documentaries on his films interesting (see the Prestige single.
4007;Christopher Nolan cleverly directs and interprets Batman as one whole person.
4008;"he's a human being
4009;fetched ideas and try to imagine crafting a story about a human being taking on villainy, and you'll see how this film is clever and emotional at the same time.
4010;I especially love seeing how Batman himself gets developed along with the gadgetry.
4011;true, the love interest is extremely muted, but it certainly acts as an excellent foil for Bruce's personality to be reflected upon and it's certainly NOT what this film is about.
4012;This is the best Batman movie yet.
4013;Overall, a good movie that finally does justice to the Caped Crusader and worth seeing on the big screen instead of waiting for it to come out on video.
4014;This movie is by far the best Batman movie ever created.
4015;The past movies Were more for children than mature audience.
4016;This movied took time and effort to establish a story on Bruce Wayne's journey into achieving his status.
4017;This time Bruce Wayne had to fight and earn his positions from letting go of the spoiled rich life, to the background of his training, to the question of how he got a hold of all his cool gadgets.
4018;Realism, while there are still some extraordinary events going on, this movie was still very realistic.
4019;the best part of this movie is how the director took the time to tell the story without jumps.
4020;And for those who have not yet seen this movie, the ending will DEFINETLY capture you and make you eager for the next installment to come out.
4021;Bale just steals the show as best B. man ever in my humble opinion!awesome stunts/fight scenes.
4022;and great acting too.you will enjoy watching this on home theatre.
4023;good movie to watch with fan OR friends kicking back on a cool nite.
4024;I can't add much more to what everyone else has already said except to say that I totally love this film, and it is one of the best comic/superhero films of all time, much less the BEST silver.
4025;None of the other films can even touch this one.
4026;They understood that an actor has to be convincing as Bruce Wayne AND Batman, and Bale is an inspired choice.
4027;I read that they wanted to make a great, timeless adventure movie (as in Star Wars, the original, and Indiana Jones) with this, and they have.
4028;Great casting, great attention to details all around.
4029;also, we finally get to see The Scarecrow, one of my favorite villians, on screen for the very first time in live action.
4030;I really hope that they can keep up this momentum for the next film, The Dark Knight.
4031;Superman is just way better.
4032;In Star Wars style, """"Batman Begins"""", the fifth installment of the Batman franchise, presents the story of the early days of the superhero, from his childhood and his deepest fears, to his personal pursuit to leave those very fears behind, into the birth of his alter ego and his first days fighting crime and injustice in Gotham City."""
4033;the story is beyond enticing.
4034;like moments that make me scratch my head feeling treated like a silly moviegoer, most of it takes you in with ease.
4035;"I particularly loved the evolutionary process Bruce Wayne goes through during his remote ""retreat"", in order to defeat his fears and overcome his insecurities."
4036;The way he gradually builds up Batman and his gear also results in a mix of fun and cool.
4037;special effects and sound effects are top of the line.
4038;Production design of Gotham City was gorgeous.
4039;I loved the details in the monorail and the gothic arches it went through as it glided over the city, for example.
4040;as a whole, I loved it.
4041;I have been a fan of Batman since I was a boy and I continue to love the character.
4042;I am happy the franchise hasn't sold out even after five installments.
4043;great effects and good story line.
4044;I love the Batman franchise.
4045;it comes in a nice slim box and a packaging which is pretty straightforward to open.
4046;Finally a movie that captures the nature of the Dark Knight and makes me hope this team will continue the series in the same vein.
4047;This is a fantastic movie, which must be watched.
4048;But Christian Bale is perfect as both Bruce Wayne and as Batman.
4049;And then you have a fantastic cast surrounding him.
4050;This is a winning formula.
4051;So Bruce discards his identity and travels throughout the world learning all he can about the criminal mind.
4052;Making him a true fighting machine.
4053;but also go to the extreme and become the judge and executioner as well.
4054;The spoof is well done, fun and silly all at the same time.
4055;There is also eight short features that cover everything from the Batmobile being built, casting, Mr. Bale's conditioning, all the great work on the Bat Suit, the sets being built and what I thought was most impressive, the filming in Iceland.
4056;And it has a couple of other stories in it as well.
4057;All in all the deluxe set is a winner.
4058;It 's beautiful slipe cover.
4059;It's a great movie with a lot of special features, the sound e imagem was amazing too.
4060;I have always HATED Batman.
4061;The story is gripping and the action is intense.
4062;If you're a fan of Batman, you've got to see it.
4063;If you're not a fan, you'll probably enjoy it anyway.
4064;5 stars, 2 thumbs way up and highest recommendations.
4065;Truly a wonderful story and definetly the best version of Batman!
4066;I've always been a casual Batman fan at best.
4067;Am I ever glad I did.
4068;And it's just in time.
4069;But it really feels more like a drama then a superhero movie, so it really works well.
4070;And there are plenty of action scenes, not to mention a climax that is intense enough to make up for the earlier aspects of the movie.
4071;This is a movie everyone can enjoy whether they are a die hard Batman fan or not.
4072;But 3 months later, still good.
4073;A great movie to own and watch again and again.
4074;I actually finished watching this film with family, and instead of us picking another film to finish the day, we all decided to watch this one again.
4075;Great Movie highly recommend it.
4076;A must watch movie, action packed and full of excitement.
4077;and best actor for this character to date.
4078;As a fan of the Batman character, one of the strong points of the Batman persona is how realistic it is, or at least how realistic it could be.
4079;"For those who aren't aware, Batman is not a ""super"" hero in the true sense of ""super heroes"" because he is simply a man, or as director Christopher Nolan aptly put it, ""He makes himself extraordinary through force of will."""
4080;Batman Begins is not only the best Batman film ever made, but as a longtime fan of the comic books, I am convinced it is the greatest Batman story ever told.
4081;one of the great elements of this film is its great character arc.
4082;Here, we see James Gordon prior to being a police commissioner and we understand his motivations as the one good cop in a deteriorating city.
4083;She is an assistant district attorney and a childhood friend of Bruce's who is more than capable of taking care of herself.
4084;Every character in Batman Begins has a purpose.
4085;it is really very well written.
4086;most importantly, we see a very realistic and plausable explanation on the formation of the Batman persona: motivations, mistakes, and challenges ahead.
4087;show host in the previous 4 films, inviting more celebrated villains to take center.
4088;invention of Bruce Wayne and his one man war on crime.
4089;this film is truly a modern.
4090;It is dark, psychological, haunting, beautiful, well.
4091;I have heard people complain about the action sequences with Batman being shot too tight, but there is an explanation for this as well.
4092;In the comics, Batman is somewhat of an urban legend.
4093;"the ""new"" Batman franchise, directed by Christopher Nolan, will be a trilogy, with the next film, The Dark Knight, to be released in July 2008."
4094;The look is at once both dark and brilliant.
4095;The casting and acting are superb (nice to see Rutger Hauer finally get a decent role .
4096;this is probably the best comic.
4097;This film makes up for those debacles and far outshines the Tim Burton films.
4098;The franchise is alive and well.
4099;Let's hope they can keep it up.
4100;And then he offers him a chance to find the answers that he seeks, if he will complete the simple task of bringing a flower to the highest point in what appears to be a mountain monastery.
4101;With Neeson as his instructor, Bruce begins to hone his natural born skills.
4102;In discussing it with his long time friend and butler Alfred (Michael Caine) he realizes he must do so from a position of secrecy.
4103;And all of them will help to develop the man, the legend that he will soon become.
4104;She is completely unaware of the man that Bruce truly is and the plans that he has.
4105;as Bruce considers his options, he also has to take back control of the company his family helped build.
4106;The thing that separates this film from the rest is the amount of rich storytelling involved.
4107;Upon seeing these items, Bruce knows just the way to put them to use.
4108;And the revelation of that is a surprise not only for him but for viewers as well.
4109;the movie does two things with ease.
4110;the other thing it does is offer a movie that is filled with action and romance and adventure and it does so in spades.
4111;This is a fun movie that kids, perhaps not too young, can enjoy as well as grandma who may remember the old sixties show.
4112;the movie features excellent acting all round with no one person taking the full credit.
4113;The special effects are eye dazzling and they compliment the character and story rather than become the main feature.
4114;this film opened big at the box office and deservedly so.
4115;People want to be able to see the action in fight scenes.
4116;"Way back in ' 89's ""Batman"" fat ass, bald nicholson was all wrong visually for Joker, yet he undeniably stole the show with a great performance."
4117;He was incredible and truly made the role his own, the one real casting gem in this seriously flawed film.
4118;so, I am still waiting for a truly good Batman movie.
4119;For all batman fans that love the make of the batmobile.
4120;will love the extra footage of how the make withstand all the other past models of batmobiles.
4121;criminals kind of superhuman that batman really is.
4122;He never really fit, though he wasn't bad.
4123;I think that was Tim Burton twisting things the way he likes to.
4124;Batman was a great movie by itself, and it was also the artistic vision of Tim Burton which gives it a flavor no one can match it because it has his quirky genius threaded into it.
4125;But Batman Begins takes a more realistic approach, and shows you the vulnerable side of Bruce Wayne, and what really motivates him, makes him tic and explains how and why there is a Batman.
4126;and Batman Begins had all the right people in all the right roles.
4127;When I heard Christian Bale was to be Batman I remembered how great he was in American Psycho, and I knew he had it in him.
4128;Gary Oldman is perfect in everything.
4129;Katie Holmes was the beautiful girl.
4130;some reviewers make a good point about how fear is the theme of Batman Begins, and it's all about facing down fear, controlling it and using it.
4131;"that the Batman's best device for getting justice was turning fear on people who use fear
4132;So thanks to Christopher Nolan for revitalizing a dying franchise, and here's to more Batman films like this one.
4133;This film is also the greatest achiever in the category of """"Comic Book based film."""""""
4134;This film beats Spiderman II and X2: X. men United.
4135;this is one of those movies that accomplishes all that it could.
4136;It is an achievement from every element, writing, directing, acting, special effects, and production.
4137;Nolan holds viewers in this comic book world effortlessly.
4138;there are some great acting performances in this film as well.
4139;He's sympathetic, which makes him the perfect villain in this role.
4140;oscar winner Michael Caine plays Alfred, the beloved butler of the Wayne family.
4141;"what makes this story so great is it escapes what I call the ""superhero problem."""
4142;The Fantastic Four are hit with extreme radiation.
4143;bruce Wayne becomes Batman in the event described in this film.
4144;The two have a falling out, and Wayne returns home.
4145;As the movie escalates, we see Wayne evolve.
4146;Finially, an intelligent and mature version.
4147;great acting by all, especially Bale and Caine.
4148;This is by FAR the best of all of them.
4149;supeman, Hulk, Spideman, all great in their own right, but this one is the most realistic, and the atmosphere absolutely made the movie!
4150;very well done, and it just flowed.
4151;this is a classic that is made for adults.
4152;"And, not only that, they made the best of all the Batman movies yet!The always great Morgan Freedman plays a (James Bond's) ""Q"" type character, and helps Batman come up with all his familiar devices we so love from the stories."
4153;It is interesting to see them in development .
4154;as it is to see Bruce Wayne develop into the formidable Batman.
4155;christian Bale plays the part of Batman beautifully, and very believably, and of course having Liam Neelson in your movie is always a big plus.
4156;"if you like Batman, or even if you don't, this is a ""must see"" movie!"
4157;Batman Begins is a really good movie.
4158;I enjoyed it because it wasn't like the comic book depictions I have seen in the past.
4159;It was more like a drama and my whole family really enjoyed it.
4160;Christian Bale was excellent as Batman and everyone in the movie did a terrific job.
4161;The beginning to the best Batman movies that have been made.
4162;christopher Nolan's vision of Batman has been the best comic to movie series to date and set a new standard for what is to be expected of a comic based movie.
4163;BATMAN BEGINS is fantastic, sticks to the TRUE storytelling of how the caped crusader began, and how it should be.
4164;very well thought out, and acted.
4165;This kicked off one of the best trilogies ever in my opinion.
4166;It is a must own for Batman fans!
4167;In this fifth installment of the ever popular Batman feature film series, Christian Bale suits up as our caped superhero.
4168;I thought the fighting scenes were done well, but most were shot so close.
4169;That is the one downside to this movie, if it has any downsides.
4170;Michael Caine brings the character of Alfred to a whole new great level although I would still take Michael Gough as Bruce's butler anyday.
4171;Katie Holmes I thought did a decent job as the assistant DA/Bruce Wayne's love interest, although I feel the film could have gone on without her.
4172;Finally Cillian Murphy does a great portrayal of the big villain in the fim, the Scarecrow/Dr.
4173;Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman are great additions to the cast as well as great portrayals of their characters, Neeson as Wayne's mentor and Freeman as Bruce's ally in Wayne Enterprises, remeniscent of Q in the James Bond series.
4174;A superbly casted, and well directed film by Chris Nolan, this movie represents Batman's best.
4175;so about this great movie.
4176;The best movie of 2005 hands down, Batman Begins.
4177;And in Gotham, he finds that he really has his work cut out for him.
4178;i thought that the actors in this movie were well cast.
4179;Christian Bale carefully balances Batman as a strong hero who has dark inner troubles.
4180;His Bruce Wayne is young, consequential, and above all a inheritor of the powerful Wayne name.
4181;Katie Holmes was also fitting as Rachael, a childhood friend of Bruce's and a future love interest.
4182;She was at times a damsel in distress, yet still a firmly grounded force to be reckoned with.
4183;Liam Neison was great as the mysterious mentor Ducard, and Morgan Freeman (Fox) and Michael Caine (Alfred) both served as perfect father figures for Bruce.
4184;finally, the plot was one of the best that I have seen in a Batman movie.
4185;The villians in the movie are well characterized and conduct their devious plans with the uptmost guile.
4186;As the movie progress, the viewers sees Batman's accretion as a hero and will be routing for him to win in the end.
4187;This is an action packed movie with a get hero and even a more austere yet still powerful Batmobile.
4188;I sure hope that this is true because if Batman has such a promising begining, I can't wait to see where the journey will take him, even if future movies involve re.
4189;inventing characters that are present in existing Batman movies.
4190;Let's hope that Batman's legend will continue for years to come.
4191;Then I began to really like it, and let go of the old story, and accept it for what it is
4192;"All of the actors in this production do an excellent job portraying ""real people"" in a comic book setting !!!"
4193;teats, cleavage, whatever ,,, is REFRESHING !!!
4194;( ,,, it's not often I can say I THOROUGHLY enjoyed this production !!!
4195;Thank You, Thank You, Thank You ,,, to the Production Team !!!
4196;It is dark, exciting, and gives a real feel to the man behind the mask, Bruce Wayne, as well as Gotham City overall.
4197;The best thing about this movie is its plot and its acting.
4198;Christian Bale is great as the Dark Knight (which will be the title of the 2008 sequel), Liam Neeson is a cruel villain as he should be, and Michael Caine is fantastic as Wayne's witty and supportive butler, Alfred.
4199;"overall, Batman Begins was a great movie and brought credibility back to a franchise that had absolutely none thanks to Joel Schumacher and Akiva Goldsman's disastrous ""Batman and Robin""."
4200;The movie reminded me very much of the Fox Kids animated series that aired in the early to mid '90's, which was an excellent series and really not meant for kids under the age of 10.
4201;Has lots of features and commentaries about the movie.
4202;Let me start by saying I'm a huge Christian Bale fan!
4203;I love the guy and I think he was a good choice to play Batman.
4204;Two great movies that I highly recommend.
4205;"It has a good cast
4206;i thought the movie did a good job of showing how Bruce Wayne became able to do what he can do as Batman.
4207;It made sense and it was believable if you have an open mind.
4208;It is entertaining!As far as Christian Bale as the new Batman, I think he is very good.
4209;I hope they do make another one with Christian.
4210;This Batman movie without a doubt is going to be the best most Hard.
4211;hARD Batman fans will be happy and impressed speaking as a DIE.
4212;The movie is just a stunning revivement of the once.
4213;maligned Batman franchise, which took a nose dive with the one.
4214;In 2003, newcomer filmmaker Christopher Nolan (who blew audiences away with his first feature film """"Memento"""") and veteran screenwriter David S. Goyer (who penned all three scripts for the """"Blade"""" series, which were also based on a comic book) approached Warner Brothers about doing another Batman movie, only this time taking the hero back to his roots and making it more realistic and believable."""
4215;the film opened with a good $72 million opening weekend and with ecstatic critical acclaim by critics nationwide.
4216;"one of the reason ""Batman Begins"" did so well was the good word."
4217;People came back for repeat viewings (I did go and see it in theaters twice) and truth be told, it's an excellent movie to boot.
4218;"cast, particularly Christian Bale (""American Psycho"", ""The Prestige"") as the title character and balances Wayne's duality naturally."
4219;The movie also strikes a balance between exposition and keeping the action moving, and never loses focus.
4220;From the beginning right to the end credits, the movie is riveting and never boring.
4221;It stands well by itself, but the ending is purposefully wide.
4222;screen and anamorphic widescreen formats and a widescreen.
4223;ray edition has yet to be released).
4224;the film is presented in 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen and it looks absolutely spectacular from start to finish.
4225;The film has a natural, more earthy tone than the simply Gothic and gaudy looks Burton and Schumacher imparted in the previous movies, and it handles contrast with ease.
4226;Black levels are smooth and inky, and compression is very well.
4227;Dialogue is clear and placed in the center channel, while the surrounds are constantly in use, even in dialogue.
4228;driven scenes, where the ambience really helps draw the viewer in.
4229;But it certainly amps up the volume in the action sequences, with deep bass that'll shake the rafters and pinpoint surround activity (particularly the Tumbler chase and the climax on the monorail).
4230;Dialogue is never lost during the action sequences, and the score co. composed by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer is always clear and detailed.
4231;A French 5.1 dub is included, and the film has optional subtitles in English, French, or Spanish.
4232;Highly recommended and can't wait for the sequel.
4233;The best of the bats.
4234;I hope for many similar like that!
4235;This is the best summer movie of 2005 (Star Wars excluded), this is the best Batman movie ever made, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman are all terrific and Christian Bale is the best Batman ever and even makes up for some weak performances in the supporting cast.
4236;The effects are flawless in this movie.
4237;I highly recommend this movie.
4238;But Christian Bale is since Michael Keaton, the only who can brought this legend come true.
4239;the screenplay is uncredible and very complete.
4240;This is the best Batman ever!
4241;"Great entertainment
4242;day graphics are awesome"
4243;"It's a good movie but ""The Dark Night"" is much better."
4244;$17.95, 140 minutes and The Dark Knight later, I am happy at the way Christopher Nolan has managed to elevate Batman and Gotham into the modern world and yet retain a grim tone that is undeniably fantasy in nature.
4245;begins starts off with a look at a child Bruce Wayne and his growth into the determined young man that becomes Batman.
4246;The pacing was handled very well: Nolan knows when to introduce a montage, and when to focus exclusively on one scene for an extended period of time.
4247;Soon, we're introduced to Henri Ducard (masterfully played by Liam Neeson) .
4248;Caine's portrayal is a bit more relaxed and casual than Michael Gough [of Batman (1989) fame], and despite not being entirely sold on this Cockney accented version, he manages to pull off the wise confidant to his master's secret well enough.
4249;She serves as the moral vehicle that spurs Bruce to reconsider his actions and leave Gotham until he's mature enough to return.
4250;gary Oldman, as Sergeant Gordon, was one of the few actors along with Bale that managed to impress me.
4251;"morgan Freeman rounds out the good guys as Lucius Fox, Bruce's ""Q"" (provider of gadgets and various technology) and true friend within Wayne Enterprises."
4252;While Freeman's role in and of itself wasn't lengthy in terms of screen time, he does prove to be crucial towards the end and delivers my favorite quip of the entire movie.
4253;It isn't quite as memorable as Danny Elfman's work [Batman (1989)] but does an admirable job of never being intrusive.
4254;on a technical note, I am exceptionally pleased with this Blu.
4255;There's also a bevy of extras that were in the two.
4256;entertaining, brooding and with morals that everyone can live by, Batman Begins is a keeper.
4257;This is a world you'll never understand.
4258;Wayne does well with this advice, and how.
4259;Thankfully before their death, they imbedded Bruce with good teachings to make him a good man when he grows up.
4260;"And then Christopher Nolan steps up and says ""Hey yo, WB, I'm bout to hit you up the side of the head with a sweet Batman cause you know, I did Memento and Insomnia""."
4261;Ok he didn't really say that, but he did promise them greatness, and greatness was delivered.
4262;While at first you think Batman starts off a little slow, you have to realize that we are delving into the persona of Batman himself.
4263;And to realize the biggest thing of all.
4264;And it's great to see the two separate entities when it comes to Bruce and the Bats.
4265;Christian Bale was great as both.
4266;I still think Michael Keaton is my favorite Bruce though because he just has a `coolness' about him, but Christian was definitely great also and is my favorite Batman, even with his kind of weird Batman voice.
4267;And then you have Alfred, the butler/second father, played, well, once again, perfectly, by Michael Caine.
4268;Morgan Freeman is even here, playing Lucius Fox, a man that works in the `basement' of Wayne Tower inventing and making up some insane items for the military, that Batman eventually uses for himself.
4269;Crooked smile Katie Holmes plays Bruce's best friend and love interest Rachel Dawes.
4270;She's also a woman that holds her own and tries to bring down the bad guys through the justice system.
4271;some of the extras on the 2 disc were great.
4272;There was a lot of good stuff on those discs that will keep you busy for awhile.
4273;So make sure you watch this first before Dark Knight.
4274;I'm a top 1000 reviewer now!
4275;I am a big fan of all the Batman movies.
4276;i loved all of them, and this movie is no exception.
4277;Its great and if u are a fan of the Batman movies or just Batman in general you should definetly see this movie.
4278;The plot and story in this movie is probably better than all the rest, the action is very cool and you will really get sucked into the dark world of Gotham.
4279;My favorite Batman has always been George Clooney.
4280;that was until i saw this movie, Christian Bale did an excellent job!
4281;I was a huge comic book fan as a kid and Batman was always my favorite character.
4282;Fastforward to 2005 and Nolan's rebirth of the franchise with Batman Begins.
4283;Nolan understands more about the Batman mythos than either Burton or Schumacher, and the film is a thrill ride that doesn't forget to focus on the interesting internal dynamics that make up the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman.
4284;It reminds me of the fantastic Batman: Year One graphic novel in that we get to see Batman as he develops, from concept to crimefighter, in all its arcane and sometimes clumsy detail.
4285;the conflicted yet noble idealist Bruce Wayne .
4286;The action is great without being too over.
4287;top, and the villains are believable and they don't take center stage over the title character as they often did in the Burton and Schumacher versions.
4288;Everything from Bruce's origin to his emergence as the Dark Knight is excellent.
4289;Although Katie Holmes role as Racheal Dawes is questionnable, this show is perfect.
4290;And I must say that the ending to the movie is one of the greatest I have ever seen in a movie.
4291;So many reboots just end up being bad, but this was actually a very good reboot, with a reasonable storyline and two villains (Ra's Al Guhl and the Scarecrow) I liked the story, it was well.
4292;written, and actually made sense.
4293;Even if I didn't like the sequel to this film, this film by itself was awesome, and even if you liked the original Batman movies with Michael Keaton, this is still a great film for any Batman fan.
4294;Bale and Holmes have good on screen chemistry.
4295;As a fan of comics, this is what I imagine it to be.
4296;Batman has always been my favorite superhero, primarily for his lack of supernatural powers and the darkness of his image.
4297;Christopher Nolan brings new life to the Caped Crusader, along with a more in.
4298;depth and believable psychology than anything seen previously.
4299;"Nolan brings with him the psychological sophistication of his work in ""Memento,"" and it shows: he tells a real story with skill and elegance."
4300;"Yes, ""Batman Begins"" has all the elements of traditional action flicks: car."
4301;i can't think of anyone I'd prefer as Batman than Christian Bale: he is good.
4302;bale is in prime form here, as usual, but he's got quite a supporting cast to back him up.
4303;Liam Neeson is elegant as always in what appears to be a patented mentor role, but it was a refreshing change of pace to find him driven by darker motivations than usual.
4304;Michael Caine brings a humanity to Alfred, making him a father figure to Bruce and becoming more than just the crusty facilitator we're used to.
4305;"figure in the film, but he also brings a kindly cunning to his role that is fun to watch
4306;The biggest surprise is perhaps Gary Oldman, who does a 180 from his usual slightly insane roles and embodies so much decent normalcy that it is slightly disconcerting in the midst of such madness.
4307;Indeed, the only weak spot in the casting is Katie Holmes as the dewy Rachel Dawes: she is amiable enough, but her smarmy debate.
4308;the production design is also outstanding.
4309;When it smashes into things and stays intact, I believe it's possible.
4310;The evolution of it, particularly the Cowl, is also entertaining to watch.
4311;All this combines to give this Batman a far more realistic tone, something the franchise has long needed.
4312;but now let us return to Bruce Wayne for a moment.
4313;perfectly crafted performance that threatens to make him the Definitive Batman.
4314;key performances as he is at outlandish ones, and here he strikes a remarkable balance"
4315;He is a superhero who all too easily could really enjoy his work, and we know it.
4316;"obsessed narcissist
4317;candy here (although I'll admit I'm happy to see him buff and beautiful again after his cadaverous turn in """"The Machinist""""): it makes the superhero credible when we know there is under the molded latex six."""
4318;one is also impressed upon in this film that Bruce's alter.
4319;book atmosphere of the others, but this is precisely one of its biggest strengths.
4320;overdue elegance to the franchise and offering the promise of several more fine outings to come.
4321;Excellent movie, recommned to everybody.
4322;I am very pleased with the order I placed.
4323;Even with this intensity and focus on the revenge Bruce Wayne is compelled to take, the character is still TOO WHOLESOME.
4324;still, this is a notable and worthwhile restart for the Dark Knight.
4325;If so, true Batman/Dark Knight fans will recognize the franchise as having returned and that Hollywood finally GETS the character.
4326;if you love batman then you will love this movie!
4327;it was awesome and we will keep watching it over and over!
4328;jump starting the series all over again getting ride of those neon lights, cheesy dialouges, and thos ridiculous bat nipples, this new Batman flick erases the events of the first four films and take us way back to Batman's origins.
4329;Christian Bale is perfect as the dark knight, almost as perfect as Micheal Keaton, who most remembered as the lunatic from American Psycho but he brings the Batman's hurt and pain and some light hearteness that made Keaton so good.
4330;Katie Holmes is surprisingly very good in her first grown.
4331;Micheal Caine as the good butler Alfred brings some well needed comic relief.
4332;So glad I was able to find this movie it finished my batman collection and the price is just beautiful no complaints thank you
4333;BATMAN BEGINS scraps the previous four execrable movies and returns to Batman's roots, with this coming.
4334;white view of crime and criminals, destroys their stronghold, and returns to Gotham to clean up the place.
4335;it is fun to watch Bruce and his faithful butler/surrogate father, Alfred (Michael Caine), assemble the Batman gear from the forgotten store of military prototypes at Wayne Enterprises.
4336;What an amazing retelling of the origins of the dark knight!
4337;Better than all the others and delightfully dark!!!
4338;Bale makes an excellent batman!
4339;He grew up reading the Batman comic books.
4340;I have never opened a Batman comic in my life.
4341;The film does a great job of exploring Bruce's character, which I thought was fabulous.
4342;here are some things I liked and disliked about the film:+ Christian Bale did a great job as Batman/Bruce Wayne.
4343;The whole concept of him having to overcome his fear of bats was brilliant.
4344;"I love the scene where the police radio a description of the car: ""It's a black."
4345;Michael Caine did a great job as Alfred.
4346;No one will ever take Michael Gough's place in my heart, but Caine made the character his own and brought a lot of classy humor to the role.
4347;"(""All those pushups every day and you can't even lift a bloody log!"")"
4348;He's fabulous in everything he does, and this film was no exception.
4349;He did a great job in all those fight scenes!
4350;It was SO PAINFUL to watch!
4351;the bottom line with this film is that it's really good for what it is, but people who were expecting this to be like the Michael Keaton movies are going to be slightly disappointed.
4352;If you are not a fan of comic book heroes, you'll still find a lot to like here, including awesome acting, music, special effects, fighting, explosions, etc.
4353;"Bale shines as Wayne and the ""Bat."""
4354;So do the other actors, however.
4355;Nolan uses this type of camera a lot during the fight scenes.
4356;other than the use of the handycam, this is a cool movie.
4357;The music is especially haunting.
4358;i think this version is closer to what Batman should be.
4359;It is a dark, gritty action movie with gadgets, villains, and heroes.
4360;I loved the Tim Burton version, especially the Prince soundtrack.
4361;We enjoyed this new instalment telling the story of Batman's creation.
4362;this episode was lighter on the comic relief and more on the story.
4363;"Michael Caine was excellent as the caring chaperone butler but I expected him to go into his ""Kings of England"" speech a few times."
4364;All the supporting characters have had better roles but it was fun to see them as supporting cast.
4365;this is a splashy role for Christian but he was hot.
4366;He was enjoyable and believable as the dark Bruce searching for a purpose and societal role.
4367;we enjoyed seeing the creation of Batman's gadgets: the car, the belt, the suit etc.
4368;It looks amazing, and the sound is out of this world and the the film is very good, to boot.
4369;Batman begins is a fantastic piece of cinematic performance.
4370;This is the real Batman: the one that will haunt your psyche forever.
4371;Not only is it the best Batman movie it's the best superhero movie to date.
4372;"Batman Begins is, in my opinion, the best ""Batman"" film ever produced thanks to a combination of superb direction, wonderful acting and an engaging story."
4373;"You'll just have to watch this exciting film to find out!With its stark realism, attention to detail, dark cinematography, wonderful cast, collage of interesting characters and plot twists, ""Batman Begins"" is sure to keep its audience entertained and fully engaged with its 141 minutes."
4374;Other wonderfully portrayed characters include the godfather.
4375;"Overall, I rate ""Batman Begins"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it."
4376;This is the Batman film fans have been waiting for, Chris Nolan and David Goyer have truely brought Batman back from the dead with this cinematic masterpiece.
4377;Exploring the true origins of Bruce Wayne and his journey in becoming the Legendary icon known as The Batman.
4378;The new Batmobile or Tumbler as it's also know as makes all previous Batmobiles look like toys compared to this thing, the chase scence is breathtaking.
4379;Fans and general moviegoers should throughly enjoy this movie.
4380;Takes the comic book format as far as it can go and leaves us wanting more.
4381;Christian Bale is the definitive Bruce Wayne/Batman and Michael Caine delivers a truly great performance as Alfred.
4382;The entire cast is unbelievably good especially (Gary Oldman, Mark Boone Junior, Rutger Hauer and of course Morgan Freeman)and the script is very well written.
4383;The score is also quite good and the editing (pacing) is to die for throughout the film.
4384;Let me just start by saying that Batman Begins is not only the best Batman movie ever made, it's also the best movie of the year.
4385;Christian Bale plays Bruce Wayne/Batman and he is absolutly perfect for the role, Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce's butler, is played by Michael Caine, Gary Oldman plays Sargent Gordon, Katie Holmes plays Bruce's love interest Rachel, Liam Neelson plays Henri Ducard, the man who trained Bruce while he was in Asia and the science whiz Lucius Fox is played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman.
4386;He goes to train with a man by the name of Henri Ducard, and meets the sinister Ra's A Ghaul (Ken Wantabe, The Last Samurai).
4387;With a great story with many twists and turns, Batman Begins is defiantly a movie that shouldn't be missed by Bat.
4388;fans and people who are just looking for a great film.
4389;And this is a crucial and important step that Nolan puts off until Bruce walks the earth in search of his own personal nirvana.
4390;It's an important and telling shift from woman as a plush toy to one who is, not only beautiful but also smart and dedicated to a cause other than self.
4391;christian Bale's Batman is real.
4392;i. e. a genuine, fleshed.
4393;out, beautifully written movie character: he is conflicted, he makes mistakes, he trusts the wrong people at times and he pays for his mistakes.
4394;It is a remarkable casting coup to have Bale in this role particularly since of late he has been playing a spate of radicals.
4395;"i. e. in ""The Machinist,"" in which he transforms himself into a skeleton."
4396;Batman Begins is not only a physically gorgeous film, it is also an emotionally and ideologically complicated one.
4397;but it also has the brains and a profoundly strong back and pumped up physicality to back it up.
4398;Finally, we have a movie that explains everything and does it well.
4399;liam Neeson is super in this film as a teacher to a troubled Bruce Wayne, schooling him in Ninjitsu and other fighting arts.
4400;Morgan Freeman is excellent as an employee of Wayne Enterprises who was pushed aside after the senior Wayne was murdered and who is in charge of a lot of R military equipment that he provides for Bruce.
4401;And of course Michael Caine makes a super Alfred!
4402;there are many memorable scenes in the film, especially where Bruce is making his first batarang and designing the Batman suit.
4403;you know if you are a fan Nolans work
4404;Batman has been brought back to full life and over powers all the rest except the fist one, because I'm still a fan of the first Batman but this one is purely fun and exciting with satisfaction written all over it.
4405;Christian Bale (American Psycho) jumps into the role as Bruce Wayne, who has had a fear of bats all his life.
4406;Wayne grows up in the hands of Alfred Pennyworth, played superbly by Michael Caine (Get Carter).
4407;Bale makes his role his own putting a twist on it and he works it out perfectly.
4408;Christopher Nolan's direction keeps the focus on the dark side of Bruce Wayne's life and he also has as keen eye for visuals and action scenes.
4409;Katie Holmes is surprisingly good as Rachel, the dedicated DA assistant also out to bring justice to the corrupt city.
4410;"Michael Caine is the perfect Alfred, showing a fatherly side to his butler role
4411;With its intelligent and witty script, and a good lead in Bale, the Batman series seems to be heading in a fresh new direction.
4412;The comic book extras are nice (and a bargain).
4413;(I even bought, yes bought, the Producers just to hear her speak another language) .
4414;something soft spot for Danny Elfman and Tim Burton.
4415;I usually laugh at these types of movies given their lack of true credibility when it comes to believing that a super hero really exists.
4416;never mind just finding the raw strength to pull a huge man like Liam with one hand up the side of a mountain, only holding on by the glove with spikes in the other hand .
4417;or the """"feature"""" boy that always seems to spot batman and be saved by batman."""
4418;There are probably thousands of kids running in the city, but of course our feature kid always gets to see batman.
4419;but still, I loved the details.
4420;he is the hope and inspiration that makes us all believe anything is possible.
4421;With the winning combination of Chris Nolan and Christian Bale, we, the fans of Batman, can now say that we have the best portrayal of the character when both see Bruce Wayne and Batman.
4422;What is misrepresented is what is included.
4423;This is a great transfer.
4424;And the 5 minute prologue gives you a sweet taste of how great The Dark Knight will look on Blu ray.
4425;Tim Burton's first two Batman movies were great, especially the first one with the ingenious decision of having Jack Nicholson as The Joker.
4426;But before the Hulk, Spiderman, Daredevil, and the X. men came to the big screen, Batman had to fight to be taken seriously.
4427;It's that Schumacher was making a movie for himself.
4428;"given that little history lesson, it's understandable that Batman Begins strives very hard to ""keep it real."""
4429;Bale has the physique and brooding manner necessary to pull off a believable Batman and an even more believable Wayne.
4430;Freeman has the reserved kindness and intelligence required for Fox.
4431;Caine imbues Alfred with whit and charm as only he can.
4432;And Oldman is both frightened and frail as a lone good cop in a world gone mad.
4433;with this newfound respect, Batman Begins starts the franchise all over again by going back to his roots.
4434;There is a gritty realism that serves as a constant reminder that Batman person could exist, from the training Bruce receives from ninjas to how Bruce, Lucius and Alfred conspire to create Batman's suit and Batmobile.
4435;If there is a high.
4436;In that regard, Batman succeeds admirably.
4437;When Bruce Wayne manipulates, it's believable.
4438;a. theme populate Batman's world.
4439;"If the Batman franchise can stray true to this new ""comic book realism,"" it will be a joy to watch unfold."
4440;I liked this movie because it delved into the origins of Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman.
4441;I highly recommend this movie.
4442;The new one by Christopher Nolan largely reinvents the whole cinematic Batman genre, consisting almost entirely of the backstory.
4443;Christian Bale is reasonably believable as the Caped Crusader and Michael Caine makes a good Alfred.
4444;The Batmobile is pretty neat, too .
4445;The fight scenes and the chase scenes are some of the best of recent years.
4446;This movie is awesome and being a huge Batman and Dc comics fan this film made me proud lol.
4447;What more can I say about Nolan and company that has not already been said, great job guys lol
4448;I Saw The Whole Movie Finally.
4449;Batman Begins may very well be the best Batman movie ever made.
4450;Christopher Nolan does a brilliant job of depicting the origin of Batman.
4451;This movie doesn't have as much action as some other Batman movies but it still may well be the best 1 because the STORY is so great.
4452;The character development of Batman is great.
4453;And the plot itself is well thought well and well told.
4454;The conflict between the League of Shadows and it's determination to destroy Gotham and Batman's determination to stop is well plotted,well acted,and well told.
4455;Ducard turning about to be the real Ra's al Ghul was a great plot twist.
4456;And then you see a piece of setup for the Dark Knight when Gordon tells Batman about the Joker.
4457;It is wonderfully dark and serious.
4458;Everything about this movie is spot on.
4459;The Batman origin story was a great way to reboot Batman and is quite possibly the best Batman movie ever.
4460;He blames himself, and has been travelling the world, picking fights.
4461;They are dedicated to restoring balance to a world overrun by criminals.
4462;He returns to Gothan City with the desire to ride the city of crime.
4463;the establishment of Batman is fully fleshed out, in this excellent film from director Christopher Nolan.
4464;Nolan has yet to make even an average movie, and was a great choice to re.
4465;The previous four films are ignored and a fresh look at the superhero is given.
4466;bale is perhaps the best Batman, pulling off both Bruce and Batman convincingly.
4467;Neeson is excellent in the role of teacher, perhaps channelling his inner Qui.
4468;Caine brings dignity and compassion to Alfred the butler.
4469;Murphy is absolutely perfect as the crazed Scarecrow (a villian I knew nothing about).
4470;There are even some scary moments.
4471;And of course, the ending sets up another film.
4472;Nolan has said that he envisions a trilogy, and I for one hope that he stays with the franchise for a while.
4473;Batman Begins is one of the best superhero movies ever made.
4474;It is also one of the best movies I have seen in a while.
4475;I highly recommend this film.
4476;tim Burton did a great job with his Batman, and a decent job with Batman Returns (1992) but the saga slipped and fell on its bat.
4477;this edition focus's its history and remaking from the comic books.
4478;boots and enjoy watchign Batman.
4479;Batman Begins is an amazing film because of one reason.
4480;dr. Crane was perfect in this movie.
4481;The knew suit was perfect, and looks exetremely well.
4482;this was great and it came quickly and i really love this movie, so i am glad that i got it for such a low price!
4483;Not since the days of the original Batman feature film adaptation back in 1989 have fans of the Cape Crusader experienced joy with the venerable franchise on the big screen.
4484;Director Christopher Nolan, the man behind the critically acclaimed Memento and Insomnia, now returns fans to where the legend began to return the Dark Knight to his beloved glory.
4485;Though dark in tone, Burton's Batman remained set in the realm of fantasy which, in its own right, was fine at the time but Christopher Nolan makes the Dark Knight real, which in effect strikes a stronger tone with audiences.
4486;man franchise, proves effectively, both through heart.
4487;wrenching emotions and body language, that the life of a superhero is not what it is cracked up to be.
4488;Though he undoubtedly has the talent capacity to successfully pull off a performance like this one, it remains a bit unnerving, at least for some, to see him in a role as this, especially after his powerful role in Steven Spielberg's Oscar winning film, Schindler's List.
4489;Ducard is the type of character who presents a truly emotional roller coaster attraction for his audience.
4490;Just as you grasp the concept he is advocating he goes and says something that touches a moral nerve.
4491;Easily the most diabolical villain in the Batman film franchise to date.
4492;the always entertaining British actor Michael Caine brings to the role of Bruce Wayne's faithful butler Alfred a style that is all his own.
4493;Though Morgan Freeman is delightful as Lucius Fox, he is not seen in quite the capacity audiences may expect, which is a bit disappointing to say the least, but there is hope his character's role in the Batman legend will expand with the upcoming sequels.
4494;True, not everything which takes place in Batman Begins has its basis in reality but the characters and their actions are more intone with our world then in any other film present in the franchise which makes it so poignant and insightful.
4495;These individuals, these human beings, are easily vulnerable and are not the squeaky.
4496;now we have a New Batman, so far the Best in years.
4497;"The writers should keep it ""real"" by sticking to the classics.Yeah!"
4498;Batman has been brought back to full life and over powers all the rest except the fist one, because I'm still a fan of the first Batman but this one is purely fun and exciting with satisfaction written all over it.
4499;Christian Bale (American Psycho) jumps into the role as Bruce Wayne, who has had a fear of bats all his life.
4500;Wayne grows up in the hands of Alfred Pennyworth, played superbly by Michael Caine (Get Carter).
4501;Bale makes his role his own putting a twist on it and he works it out perfectly.
4502;This film takes the Frank Miller reinvention and brings it to the big screen setting the stage for a bright future for the Dark Knight.
4503;Very good reboot of the Batman character.
4504;Easily one of the best Batnan movies to date.
4505;Even if you never liked Batman before, you should see this movie.
4506;This one is leaps and bounds ahead of the rest (yes, even better than the first one with Jack Nicholson).
4507;Batman Begins is, in a word, incredible.
4508;strong performances from Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy, and others.
4509;"And some great action sequences that will even make you say ""WOW"" in this era of super."
4510;Now that I'm older I still think it's the only one in the series that is worth seeing.
4511;Thank goodness that this is a new Batman series.
4512;Bale does an excellent job, as does Neeson, (always great) Katie Holmes (which I loathe) actually does a good job in this movie.
4513;hero movie w/o the one.
4514;A promising start to a new series.
4515;I look forward to the next film.
4516;The character development in this story is amazing, providing tremendous insight into how Bruce Wayne became Batman.
4517;There is also a love story developing, which you may already know has a less than perfect ending in The Dark Knight .
4518;I went to see this film the nite it opened in theaters and I was very impressed!
4519;"I kind of had the feeling the film would be good since the producers got alot of the ideas for this movie from Frank Miller's ""Batman: Year One"" comic series."
4520;Thanks to Miller, comic books enjoy the popularity they have today since he injected real.
4521;life elements into comic book character's lives.
4522;In the case of Batman, Miller was able to reintroduce Batman as an obsessed crime.
4523;This version of Batman is a reflection of Miller's ingenuity and towers above Burton's film since it has all of the elements of what a good movie should have: a believeable story.
4524;line, great special effects and action scenes, solid acting and good chemistry between the cast.
4525;Bale is excellent as Bruce Wayne and I like the performances of Neeson, Crane, Freeman and Hauer too.
4526;This film, however, approaches Batman in a much more realistic manner.
4527;This is a must have for the Batman fan, we love our superheroes.
4528;The is one of the best movie reboots that Hollyweird had done in a while.
4529;Yes it's one of the better comic book superhero movies, but definitely not a masterpiece of any shape or form.
4530;One page in any of these novels contains more intelligence, correct science, mind.
4531;opening ideas and grand action than all the comic book movies combined.
4532;Whoever conceived of reviving the franchise decided wisely that the best place to start was at the beginning.
4533;Wayne reestablishes himself as a billionaire playboy with the help of his family's loyal butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and takes a job in Wayne Enterprises' Applied Sciences department under the brilliant inventor Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), where he finds good use for the high.
4534;christian Bale is the best Batman of the franchise.
4535;Bale's performance is more energetic and versatile than actors who took on the role previously.
4536;And he has more sex appeal than even George Clooney, which the female audience will appreciate.
4537;Thankfully, that sequence is intercut with other material.
4538;it can't be easy to explain why a sane individual would fight crime dressed as a giant chiroptera, but Bruce Wayne's motivations and the origins of the bat motif are credible and interesting.
4539;Batman Returns isn't perfect, but it left me wanting to see more Batman films, and that's quite a feat considering that the franchise seemed dead and buried.
4540;Consider the Batman franchise successfully resurrected.
4541;Subtitles are available for the film in English, French, and Spanish.
4542;Dubbing is available in French.
4543;This is undoutably the best Batman movie to date.
4544;The tone of the movie is spot on and realistically based in the modern day world.
4545;Not only is Batman Begins a 'great comic book movie'.
4546;but that's a good thing.
4547;An excellent, dark viewpoint of how Batman got a start.
4548;Better than Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, and George Clooney combined.
4549;But the big thing is that it's true to the actual comic books.
4550;action scenes are purposefully fast to make it more realistic.
4551;character of Batman is far well.
4552;This Batman film was awesome.
4553;But that was more about Keaton and Nicholson and their performances more.
4554;Great story, liked how they stayed true, great actors and characters, really fun and fast.
4555;Makes me excited to watch the Dark Knight now.
4556;Indeed, Christian Bale was excellent and so was Michael Caine, two very witty, sympathetic characters.
4557;most of all, the style was all over the place.
4558;This is not just the best Batman movie, but one of the best movies I have ever seen period.
4559;George Lucas could learn something about story telling and choosing excellent writers, actors, and directors.
4560;the characters are well developed and well acted.
4561;The story and atmosphere are real.
4562;Christian Bale IS Batman and Michale Cane does a great job as Alfred.
4563;The biggest surprise is Gary Oldman as a good guy.
4564;i have opened my eyes on Chris Nolan since Momento.
4565;I think he is thoughtful writer which seems rare in movies these days.
4566;Batman Begins, superbly directed by Christopher Nolan, is a film that works on many levels, but above all, it makes a modern hero relevant again, much like Sam Raimi's spidey flicks.
4567;At first, Bruce Wayne is in a Chinese prison, on a lifes' quest to understand the criminal mind, and how best to fight them and rid himself of the guilt that has haunted him for years.
4568;Working with his beloved butler Alfred (a heartfelt Michael Caine) and good cop Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman, in a role that finally gives Gordon something to do), Bruce goes to work to renovate the caverns underneath his house, collects hardware from scientist Lucious Fox (Morgan Freeman at his wryest and loosest) and builds a batsuit with which to turn his fear into a weapon against his enemies.
4569;And Batman must fight them all by using his skills of manipulation to defeat them.
4570;up shots, the action scenes are among the brawniest, most bracing and innovate in recent memory, including an amazing car chase feauturing the souped up Batmobile and a climatic monorail fight between Batman and some old enemies from the League of Shadows.
4571;But above all, Nolan and fellow screenwriter David Goyer focus on the characters an motivations in the bat story.
4572;After all, after resurrecting the Batman franchise in such rousing fashion, who can't wait for the next of Batman?
4573;It's become one of my favorites.
4574;The clarity of the picture was outstanding.
4575;Batman Begins is an entertaining movie that has good action and gimmicks.
4576;Here's why it's a 5 stay film:1) The overall story is interesting and flows very well.2) A number of top notch actors give good performances.3) The movie stays on track in doesn't get side tracked by focusing too much on a particular villian, as some of the previous Batman movies did.4) Christian Bale is one of the best Batmans we've seen.
4577;I's one of the most fun movies to watch of this year.
4578;Just be prepared for fun and action, because you're not going to get a real deep drama.
4579;What a great super hear movie.
4580;This series is by far the best of the super hero movies out there and much better than previous incarnations of Batman movies.
4581;Since this is the first time this has happened to me, it's fine.
4582;He's about justice, helping people, protecting the innocent, and stopping the guilty.
4583;"His dark image is just how he chooses to become a larger than life ""supernatural"" force against crime, but it's merely a tool to fight evil."
4584;His development from spoiled richboy to force of justice is both believable and larger than life.
4585;the cast is perfect, especially Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon who finally gets to be the good cop he never got to be in the TV or movies.
4586;Still, a great rendition that I was overjoyed to finally see made.
4587;"After a series of ""Batman"" live action clunkers, Christopher Nolan shows what can be done with one of our best fictional characters."
4588;So how was Batman born?In this stylish creation, Bruce Wayne is the son of a corporate giant living in Gotham City (New York is a stand in with bits and pieces of Chicago thrown in as well).
4589;She and Bruce still have a twinkling in their eyes for each other and despite some naysayers I found their chemistry to be honest and appealing.
4590;What set it apart from others of the genre are the intelligent script, crisp direction and great editing.
4591;"Sure the film has some humorous quips but for the most part the ""A"" list actors take their roles seriously."
4592;"Compare the movie with the 6 minute opening of the sequel (""The Dark Knight"") included on this disc and you can see the difference."
4593;Christian Bales has an upper body fit for Batman.
4594;He also has an emotionless gaze that is fit for the bat hero, except when he kisses his love: it then becomes wooden and awkward.
4595;Cain is excellent, as usual, and Holmes is also beyond reproach.
4596;Neeson is the bad guy but he looks and acts like a good boy: delightful.
4597;"the dialogue is average
4598;I wonder why such good actors are in such a feature?The gems in this movie are the sets and the fight sequences, of course.
4599;this movie is well worth you money if you are into action features.
4600;I would recommend this site to everyone, it's really great.
4601;Batman Begins is a great addition to the Tim Burton Batman films and in my opinion it slightly surpasses those, but not by much.
4602;Christian Bale shines as Bruce Wayne/Batman proving he is a star on the rise.
4603;That is one dedicated actor if I do say so myself and I liked him just as much as Keaton in the role because he had the physical build (something Keaton lacked) to go along with the good acting chops to play Batman.
4604;The supporting cast is great as well, with Liam Neeson (very good here), Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman being the standouts.
4605;I am a fan of Burton's Batmobile design, but this one is just as cool in a more realistic way.
4606;thye are and alwyas will be our.
4607;Batman Begins is a fitting title, a statement in itself, stamping an end to a saga that had lost its direction long ago.
4608;It seems one comic book geek, Christopher Nolan, finally did what all arm.
4609;the first move by Nolan was to cast a handful of well established supporting actors.
4610;Liam Neeson as the alluring mentor and conflicted villain, Michael Caine the witty and loving Butler, a perceptive Morgan Freeman as the trusted scientist, the list goes on.
4611;The birth of Batman is truly more intense that meets the eye, more philosophical than Hollywood would usually care to mention.
4612;It has captured a depth in comic books that is rarely celebrated by onscreen adaptations.
4613;Batman Begins is one of many recent releases of big.
4614;i wouldn't go as far to say this movie is a classic, but I am hopeful this saga will resurrect a trend in story telling for our comic book heroes to come.
4615;After a daring escape that appears to spell the end for Ra's, Bruce finds himself on a jet plane bound for Gotham, his loyal family butler, Alfred, at his side.
4616;Then came """"Batman Begins,"""" a fantastic new take on the bat more true to the character comic and animation fans know and love!"""
4617;set on bringing justice to the city his family once nurtured and loved.
4618;The always wonderful Christian Bale seems born to play the Bat, bringing the right amount of intensity and emotion to both hero and secret identity.
4619;Katie Holmes is both beautiful and noble as the high.
4620;Gary Oldman continues to impress and surprise with the most perfect incarnation of Jim Gordon I could ever hope for!
4621;And, though I never would have thought to cast him myself, Michael Caine shines as Alfred Pennyworth, bringing his own charming and original take to the role.
4622;The great Morgan Freeman is wise and endearing as Lucius Fox, the Bat's gadget man.
4623;A perfect Batman villain performance!
4624;Liam Neeson is always flawless, this time playing the role of Henri Ducard, a man with a past as dark and mysterious as The Batman's.
4625;And the magnificent Tom Wilkinson is terrific as the sleazy crime.
4626;The choice of subject and characters is perfect for a tale of the very origins of the Dark Knight, everything about it reflecting the core subjects of fear, deception, theatricality, intimidation, symbolism, madness, and the nature of justice!
4627;I certainly hope there will be many more films in this new Batman line, as long as they all share the strength and realism of this one!
4628;A tale involving the Mad Hatter would be fantastic!
4629;"And Christopher Lloyd is long overdue to play Mr. Freeze!What director/writer Christopher Nolan and co. writer David S. Goyer created with ""Batman Begins"" is nothing less than a masterpiece for the superhero film genre."
4630;There are scenes of such perfection that they demand mentioning.
4631;For example, Cillian Murphy's brilliant performance in the bowels of Arkham Asylum, as he boils.
4632;There's also the wonderful scene where Batman converses briefly with Jim Gordon outside his own modest home.
4633;"I love all the Jim/Batman scenes, and Batman's use of live bats as ""backup"" at Arkham was fantastic!"
4634;There are 8 featurettes on topics like special effects, the development of the film, Christian Bale's physical transformation into Bruce Wayne, the unusual new Batmobile, and much more!
4635;All three stories present situations and characters reflected in the film.
4636;Any Batman fan should love the 2.
4637;"disc Deluxe Edition, just as any Batman fan should love ""Batman Begins!"""
4638;Now, give us many more!
4639;Great remake to a great comic!
4640;If you want the funny Batman go back to the 90's.
4641;Great story, efx, acting, sets, costumes (sans nipples) and a descent Bruce Wayne and Batman in the same movin' picture.
4642;Great job all around on this one.
4643;Christian Bale is HOT and I loved seeing him put through his paces.
4644;Now this movie starts out with bruce wayne as a youngster and has some very good moments from him before he was batman.
4645;Pretty good movie from here, with an ending that was as good as any movie I have seen in a long time.
4646;I am a huge fan of batman the original animated series and tim burton's version which captured the voice perfectly, in fact the cartoon didn't slip up in A SINGLE episode whereas batman begins hits like double digits with how many times they screw this up.
4647;So still a very good movie but this was a major problem for me.
4648;Batman Returns comes next and Batman Begins is somewhere around there.
4649;The Schumacher ones,while not being superb, still have their moments.
4650;all in all, Batman Begins is a good movie.
4651;I have enjoyed all the batman movies and the original show when I was a kid.
4652;Batman Begins removed all doubts and proved to be an excellent movie.
4653;The movie covers this is a fair amount of detail, giving you insight as to how he met important people such as Gordon, and where he got his fighting abilities, his gadgets and even symbolic animal.
4654;As an underlying thread, Wayne's principles are also developed throughout the movie.
4655;"unlike one or two other superhero movies, ""Batman Begins"" keeps a fair amount of the action and pace present while it deals with the troubling issues that a budding crime."
4656;There is a fair balance between self.
4657;top, comic book feel, the movie presents a darkly serious characterisation.
4658;For me, this was an excellent difference.
4659;all in all, I enjoyed this movie much more than the earlier movies from the Batman franchise.
4660;This is a great film, and really has a lot going for it.
4661;Christian Bale is outstanding in this movie!
4662;star cast that delivers the goods.
4663;as an actress she is one dimensional always with the same facial expressions the same hair the same everything.
4664;She never takes it to the next level So, for her to be in this movie.
4665;Its action packed, dark and totally exciting.
4666;This is a truly all new Batman that I have never seen before.
4667;I am a big fan of the other four films, but this one truly stands out as a new chain of Batman films.
4668;what really got me in this movie was the Bruce Wayne is how he transformed into the Dark Knight.
4669;He has the perfect look and an even more perfect voice.
4670;I was surprised at the A. list cast of stars this film has.
4671;Sure, the other four films have several huge stars, but this one's has truly great actors and not just famouse ones.
4672;I would've liked to see a little more of Morgan Freeman since he is great in everything he does.
4673;Although, I would've liked to see more of him, he really gave a chilling and eerie performance.
4674;christian Bale is probably my favorite portrayl of Bruce Wayne.
4675;He really gives it the dark edge and, when he's Batman, you can really hear the tone of fury in his voice.
4676;the action scenes were quite incredible.
4677;Jack Nicholasen truly captivated me with his portrayl of him and I can't watch anyone try to match it.
4678;Christian Bale is great as Bruce Wayne and the rest of the crew(Liam Neeson,Michael Caine,Gary Oldman,Morgan Freeman) make this film the best Batman movie yet.
4679;we see why Bruce Wayne turned to crime fighting.
4680;the film is chock full of suspense,action and high tech gadgets.
4681;Unlike its counterparts this Batman film is a good deal edgier and a lot more gritty.
4682;Instead of the flashy suits and fancy costumes and gadgets this film focuses more on the man behind the mask and how he came to be.
4683;It is quite interesting seeing everything that we've come to know as part of pop.
4684;culture come to life and see how it all evolved including the batcave and the famous symbol etched in the night sky.
4685;The acting is quite good as well, with Christian Bale fillling in the shoes that were so previously occupied by George Clooney and Michael Keaton.
4686;Michael Caine gives a great performance as Alfred as well.
4687;Katie Holmes plays a strong.
4688;But overall the film was fantastic and I highly reccomend it to those who felt that the previous Batman films were a little too flashy for such a dark character.
4689;a rich, pouting whiner with NO CHARISMA AT ALL.
4690;on a positive note .
4691;veteran film actors Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both do a FINE job with the supporting roles they're given here .
4692;some of the photography in the Tibetian mountains and also of Gotham City at night is breathtakingly beautiful.
4693;Of all the 'Batman' movies made, Tim Burton's 1989 'Batman' remains by far the most enjoyable of the series.
4694;Also recommended: 'Batman: The Animated TV Series' (far better than this movie was) and 'Spiderman,' 'Spiderman 2.'
4695;An awesome rebirth of a superhero charater.
4696;Something with bright costumes, lots of violence and explosions.
4697;You have the good ones (Batman Begins, Batman, and Batman Returns) and the bad ones (Batman Beyond and Batman and Robin).
4698;batman Begins is one of the best films I have seen that has been based off a comicbook series.
4699;The film has a strong storyline, great script, and a very talented cast.
4700;I'm glad to have seen a film that brings justice to Batman and his story.
4701;co. stars Michael Caine (Alfred), Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox) and Gary Oldman (Jim Gordon) are excellent as Batman's allies.
4702;The same holds true for Tom Wilkinson and Cillian Murphy (who originally auditioned for the title role) as one of Batman's nemesis.
4703;"When these actors appear in a movie, you expect a good performance and each one delivers with ""Batman Begins""."
4704;This is especially true of Michael Caine's performance that shows more of the bond that Alfred has with Bruce Wayne.
4705;It takes you away from the comic book feel of the previous Batman movies and seems almost realistic.
4706;It's also good to see that Batman isn't secondary to the villains in this movie.
4707;What a fantastic blu ray picture sound track and making of the best part was the added scene of the Dark Night 10/10
4708;If you have any interest in the Batman series this is a must see movie.
4709;lets hope for the sake of all us big batman fans that this one is superior to the rest.
4710;respecting fan knows, this one is an adaptation of frank millers batman .
4711;year one which is pretty much one of the diffinitive comics.
4712;this film is a comic book geeks dream come true.
4713;There is so much attention to detail in this movie that it takes an hour before we see The Batman.
4714;I am sure this is what put some people off who didn't like this film, but I found myself engrossed in this man's personal journey.
4715;To be fair to mainstream movie goers, I was a big comic book reader in my youth and I still love super hero films and collectables to this day, so this film might be a tad bit tedious and dark for a person who really isn't into comic book heroes.
4716;man, it's got a great story and it's a lot of fun.
4717;something I expect from a superhero movie.
4718;"OK, all you DC fans I'm bracing myself.
4719;What can i say, first off this movie is excellent demo material.
4720;If you'd like to impress your friends then this is one of the movies to do it with.
4721;with Excellent picture, crystal clear, sharp image.
4722;This feature presents a PiP(Picture in Picture) format that allows you to see behind the scenes as well as cast and crew interviews that run the entire feature length, all without interruption of the movie.
4723;it is a must have film and also great for demo material
4724;Honestly this is a lesson to Hollywood.
4725;it's now a work of art.
4726;There were some cool parts and scenes and the concept of the villians weapon were pretty cool but the movie didnt have enough excitement for this type of film.
4727;close camera work to really see what was going on.
4728;the backstory of how Batman came to be was pretty interesting and I enjoyed this almost more than when Batman actually came on screen.
4729;just another young, cute Hollywood actress.
4730;The rest of the cast was solid if unspectacular.
4731;Great way to start the trilogy.
4732;The movie is a great look on Batman.
4733;It shows a great deal of detail on what happened in Bruce Wayne's life and introduces the first villain rather nicely.
4734;Still an interpretation of the Batman myth, but a believable and engrossing interpretation.
4735;The supporting cast are phenomenal, highly recommended.
4736;merchandized insanity of the first four Batman films and throw them right out the window.
4737;Director Cristopher Nolan strips down The Bat it his primal form and lets it rip.
4738;I'm just pointing out that Batman Begins is honest.
4739;There's a change for Hollywood.
4740;Great ensemble cast of characters (including Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman)a plot that actually develops into something from something.
4741;All I do know is that as long as WB keeps The Bat pure and simple then it will continue to flourish and attract new fans.
4742;I'm a big fan of Batman.
4743;I loved Tim Burton's version, but this one was an excellent evolution of the franchise.
4744;I really enjoyed Bale's performance, even if you don't like his voice.
4745;My son is a Batman freak and this gift set is so awesome.
4746;It includes some really cool items and the movie is great.
4747;It is great to finally see Hollywood stay pretty close to the actual darkness and storyline of a character as he was originally written.
4748;there are a few moments of humor in this movie, but not the usual comic farse Hollywood seems to throw into everything they make these days.
4749;this Batman is about as close to authentic as we can probably ever expect from any major studio.
4750;but the mask was great!)
4751;The movie arrived on time and was in great conditions.
4752;This movie is actually pretty good.
4753;This is a great movie.
4754;It is the first of the trilogy, so it is important as the introducing film.
4755;My favorite is the second in the trilogy with the Joker.
4756;Batman begins is a very good movie for starters.
4757;This is one amazing film.
4758;Other Superhero films touched one deep feeling of the protagonist and carried that theme throughout the film.
4759;Best example is the first Spirder.
4760;Peter Parker was an interesting, easy to pull off character.
4761;Bale gives such a performance, so much depth that he gives Bruce Wayne something that has never been seen before in all forms of Batman films, a real motive.
4762;We are given the best origin story of Bruce Wayne to really give him a meaningful backbone.
4763;He does what he does not for a loved one but because he believes in justice.
4764;Much better story and character developement than the last one in the trilogy (Dark Knight Rises) and really good to watch again before watching the last one
4765;I liked Batman Begins because it gives an in.
4766;One of the best parts about this blu.
4767;I do like Burton's take but it was very shallow in terms of what makes Batman tick (Tim has always been all style and no substance), Nolan on the other hand gives us what we all wanted and that is the man behind the cowl, the motivation and lessons learned to make him the Knight that he is.
4768;Nolan delivers a great cast with a great scrpit, all told with great direction.
4769;Bale makes the most promising Batman and Bruce Wayne since the casting news of Michael Keaton, whom would go on to drop the ball as Batman in the Burton films along with Jack Nicholson dropping The Joker too (sorry Jack DID NOT KNOW how The Joker should be).
4770;Along with Bale there are some very good actors fleshing out, and I mean fleshing out the roles of some of Gotham's citizen such as Micahel Cain(Alfred), Gary Oldman(Gordon) and Cillian Murphy(Dr. crane/Scarecrow) just to name a few.
4771;The use of actual sets and stunt scenes are most welcomed instead of being once again exposed to CGI.
4772;It is the truest, and in my mind, the only, representation of Batman to ever hit the big screen.
4773;first of all, Batman Begins tells the story of Bruce Wayne.
4774;This movie lets us know Bruce Wayne BEFORE we know Batman.
4775;He is a normal (albeit extremely wealthy and intelligent) human being.
4776;Goyer and Nolan captured this perfectly with Batman Begins.
4777;secondly, Batman as Batman is more fun than ever before.
4778;Christian Bale is absolutely perfect for both the role of Bruce and Batman.
4779;He is an extremely talented actor who has honed his chops on brooding/buff roles in many of his previous films (see Equilibrium for example.
4780;it's basically Batman) and it shows.
4781;Christian's Batman is distraught, he's enraged, he's new to the game, and he's fresh and excited to be out doing what he thinks is good.
4782;Bale nails Batman, which lets Batman be the Batman all us comic fans have been craving.
4783;finally, not only does this film have an absolutely stellar cast, but it has an amazing plot and great action scenes.
4784;Finally, a story that is interesting, intriguing, and worthy of being turned into a movie.
4785;And for all the comic action fans out there, there is action that is (for the most part) believable and very entertaining.
4786;Of course the Tumbler could probably never really drive on roofs, but come on, it's fun and it actually goes with the plot really well!
4787;down the greatest comic movie since the original Brandon Lee """"Crow."""""""
4788;Spiderman 1 and 2 were fun, X2, was a blast, but Batman Begins is a movie.
4789;It's perfectly executed on all accounts and should be viewed by everyone.
4790;Everyone (except young children) will love this movie.
4791;Gary Oldman is great as Sgt. Gordon.
4792;The origins of the Batman legends are very well handled.
4793;the storyline of where Batman came from was absolutely incredible, and Christian Bale did amazing as Bruce Wayne/Batman.
4794;I would love to say how they do the Joker.
4795;Batman Begins is the best Batman yet.
4796;This is my favorite Batman movie.
4797;But as a great story with great characters that looks great in blu.
4798;ray, it is hard to top Batman Begins.
4799;Batman has been at the heart of three of the four comic book movie revolutions.
4800;In the 1960's, the original movie began the era of campy comic book movies.
4801;That era ended with the Michael Keaton Batman film which for the first time took the subject matter seriously and propelled comic book movies into a new phase.
4802;Finally, in 2005 Batman Begins became the greatest comic book movie of all time and created a new type of comic book movie that could only be described as epic in scope.
4803;The sheer scope of its plot, the depth of its plot, and the mythic nature of its presentation all give this film a majesty unparalleled by comic book movies before and to up to this date.
4804;why is this movie so great?
4805;David Goyer as always turns in a fantastic script.
4806;There is always payoff in a Goyer script.
4807;Christopher Nolan as director is a man who understands structure.
4808;This is a movie about rising action and beginings.
4809;Batman's origins are interspersed between the beginning of his modern career and the traumatic events that shaped him in the past.
4810;Goyer and Nolan also give us a twist and play on our assumptions that movie creators do not care about the source material and will alter important elements to fit their vision.
4811;"goyer and Nolan also show that they ""understand"" Batman."
4812;Basically Batman is the real guy and Bruce Wayne is just a persona that he puts on to take care of the minutiae of life.
4813;They also take us through all of the elements that we recognize about Batman and laying out logically why they exist and how they fit together.
4814;Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score is just the right kind of music for this type of music.
4815;Its operatic and grand to give it the right kind of mytho.
4816;epic feel that this movie evokes.
4817;It can also be loud and quick giving us the kind of percussive beats that are necessary for the action packed sequences that rocket throughout the movie.
4818;Christian Bale is perfect as Bruce and Batman, able to tread the line between the greedy playboy and the tough as nails superhero.
4819;Cillian Murphy is great as the deadpan control.
4820;freak psychiatrist, Dr Jonathan Crane.
4821;All of these stellar performances with great direction and writing lead to a delightful synergy that culminates in one of the great cinematic masterpieces of that era.
4822;I gush because it's true.
4823;It's a great set and I can't recommend it enough.
4824;The strongest of the batman films, well made, well edited, superbly acted, truest to the heart of the dark knight.
4825;As a long time Batman fan (I do use a Batman Comforter), I think that this Batman movie is the best of the lot.
4826;While all are fun this one seemed to capture the dark charm of Batman so much better then the others.
4827;The whole movie had fantastic casting.
4828;I believe that the moive is interesting enough that even people who are watching the movie simply because it is Batman will love it too.
4829;"You've got to hand it to Warner Bros.
4830;With Memento director Christopher Nolan at the helm, Batman is finally given the right treatment that the classic DC Comics icon has deserved as Nolan and co. screenwriter David Goyer take the Dark Knight back to his roots.
4831;After a spectacular action sequence, Bruce returns to the crime ridden Gotham City which is under the fist of crime lord Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson)"
4832;Unlike the other Batman films, Batman Begins really gets to the heart and soul of the character, and Bale couldn't be better as the Dark Knight.
4833;The cinematography is superb, the fight scenes are nicely orchestrated, and the rest of the cast is great as well, including Cillian Murphy who is perfectly creepy as the vile Scarecrow.
4834;All in all, Batman Begins is a magnificent return to form for the character, and it's one of the best comic to film adaptations ever.
4835;goers with a clear picture of what they thought comic books and the movie adaptions from them were all about, and it has haunted us true and loyal comic book fans for a long time.
4836;They proved, finally, that hollywood can invest a ton of money, get a great ensemble cast and (cherish the thought) be faithful to the source material.
4837;"now comes ""Batman Begins"", and thank you very much it follows the story more than very well."
4838;It is dark, gritty, emotional and everything a Batman movie SHOULD be.
4839;But before we get Batman, we get Bruce Wayne and the movie is 100x better for it.
4840;And this film shows us all of that.
4841;The first hour or so focusing on Wayne and all the supporting characters (all amazingly well acted) is a great film in and of itself, and then we get an hour or so of Batman on top of it!The film moves along well, and is just a great great flick.
4842;And newcomers get an amazing story.
4843;Also a great comic book interactive menu sits on the 2nd disc, which is really fun.
4844;This is what a superhero movie should be like.
4845;A great origin as well as villians.
4846;"No over the top performances
4847;And the ending was fantastic with a clue as to what villian will be in the next movie .
4848;talk about your exciting film openings.
4849;ah well, anyways, years later, he is Bruce Wayne, the only white man in an English.
4850;Talk about your happy coincidences.
4851;It is a good example of what happened in """"The Emperor's New Clothes""""."""
4852;According to them, only those worthy enough can see the clothes.
4853;Everyone fakes that they can see them, including a very naked king, so that they can feel worthy.
4854;"my God, this fable fits ""Batman Begins"" perfectly."
4855;Christian Bale has a monotone voice and has NO EXPRESSION!
4856;it strives so hard to be realistic and profound that it strips the energy and excitement form Batman.
4857;But really, Gary Oldman in a small role as a humble cop who .
4858;If you want to see a REAL Batman movie that is not boring and actually takes risks and is original, see the aforementioned first 2 batman films BATMAN and Batman Returns.
4859;"They are more well made, more emotional, and far cry better then this new POS movie that should have been called ""die hard 5:now hes a bat""."
4860;This is the best movie ever made!
4861;batman begins and the dark knight are both equally good movies!!!!
4862;take a peek at the other 2 parts of the trilogy for real sticker shock, lol.
4863;Christian Bale adds his dark terminator style and spiritual noteworthiness.
4864;the symbolic good vs evil emulation, kung fu on a mountaintop, fantastic toys and the 1% vigilante justice lifestyle.
4865;"Christopher Nolan, with his new Batman Christian Bale, set out to tear down the franchise as it existed in the previous four ""Batman"" films and reconstruct it anew."
4866;They did so with great success by building the movie around the Batman character, and by building the Batman character bit by bit.
4867;And be honest, it's true.
4868;Tim Burton did a decent job in the semi.
4869;boobs in the batsuit and a just.
4870;paycheck performance by Tommy Lee Jones.
4871;"playboy Keaton did not come anywhere near to conveying Bruce Wayne's pain or dark side
4872;Christopher Nolan essentially destroys the previous Batman movies in order to recreate the legend here.
4873;It deserves the sequel it will spawn.
4874;On another note, the acting in this movie was well done and gave more life to the storyline and the characters that were involved with it.
4875;Overall, I found this film one of the few movies that has come out of Hollywood to be truly worth my time to watch the first time and worthy to be watched more than once.
4876;Fast forward to the finest Comic Book to Film adaptation ever.
4877;Christian Bale (best known for his roll in American Psycho : enough to give Batman the edge he needed!!!)
4878;Director Chris Nolan who brought us MEMENTO and INSOMNIA continues his dark voyage and brings us what Batman should always have been A TERRIFYING FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH.
4879;OVERALL : The Best Batman film ever : Awesome special effects, Outstanding visuals (landscapes, cityscapes and aerial photography) .
4880;Absolutly incredible, Batman Begins is one of the best films ever.
4881;This is the """"Batman"""" film I've long waited to see."""
4882;Christian Bale fits my image of Bruce Wayne.
4883;The trailers then impressed me into seeing this film and when I finally did see it, I was simply awestruck that someone managed to make the perfect Batman film, finally!This is not a film for the children.
4884;This is a very deep, profound, spiritual beginning and provides the most picture of Bruce Wayne yet, helping people understand the kind of person who would spend his nights dressed as a bat going after criminals.
4885;in Tibet, he receives special training from a mysterious Ducard, played by Qui.
4886;There is a disagreement over the use of violence/vengeance, causing Wayne to part company in cool style and return to Gotham after a 7 year absence.
4887;"He learns otherwise and thus in one uniquely spiritual scene, when Bruce Wayne achieves ""oneness"" with a flurry of bats, we see the transformation."
4888;"While this plot might seem a bit of a stretch for a straight foward, dramatic film, it works in ""Batman Begins"" because that's what generally happens in comic books."
4889;"In comparison to the motives of the previous line of whacked out villains of the four ""Batman"" films, this one with the Scarecrow is the most realistic and plausible."
4890;which is very relevant to today's world.
4891;More than Tim Burton's or Joel Schumacher's version, this Gotham looks liveable and realistic (a cross between Chicago and New York City).
4892;This film is the complete opposite of Schumacher's two films and that is a good thing.
4893;"I believe that Schumacher is the person responsible for ruining the franchise and I'm glad Warner Brothers Studios had the good sense to wait 8 years and trust a director with ""indie cred"" to give TRUE Batman fans the film we have waited decades to see."
4894;"I even like it better than ""Spiderman"" 1 and 2, which is saying A LOT."
4895;"As a huge fan of the first ""Batman"" movie, I had some serious doubts when I continuously read reviews, stating that this was the ""best 'Batman' movie yet""."
4896;This movie is simply amazing!!
4897;Christopher Nolan decided to take us deep into the mind, heart and soul of the 'Caped Crusader' and let the audience see what, how and why Batman is Batman.
4898;The audience is also treated to more of Wayne's father.
4899;Nolan did an excellent job of depicting the relationship between Bruce and his father.
4900;Every exchange we see between the two, easily displays the un.
4901;"Truly an emotional scene and one that ""brings home"" the love between father and son)."
4902;He is very feared and is very capable of handling more than 1 man(more like 8 or 9).
4903;As we learn more we see that he has a plan for these men, once he gets them into his asylum.)
4904;There are many twists and turns that start at about the point I have stopped at, and again, I wouldn't want to ruin this film, due to how magnificent it is.
4905;my favorite part of this film is probably Michael Caine as Alfred.
4906;He is simply perfect for the role and this movie gives us the best depiction of Alfred.
4907;In previous films, Alfred was basically a friendly servant, with dry humor.
4908;figure to Bruce and actually persuades Bruce into keeping the mansion, and upholding the Wayne family name.
4909;Alfred and Bruce argue quite a bit throughout this film and the dialogue between the two is so intelligent and so well.
4910;"worded that you almost forget you are watching a ""Batman"" movie."
4911;morgan Freeman is also a joy as Mr. Fox, an applied scientist at Wayne Enterprises.
4912;He is funny, smart, and a very large part of the plot, albeit the fact that his screen time is relatively short in this 2hr 20min masterpiece.
4913;kAtie Holmes gives an adequte performance as Rachel Doss.
4914;the scene that made this movie for me, is when Batman reveals his identity to Rachel.
4915;"Batman repeats a line Rachel had told Bruce earlier in the film, during an argument the two had
4916;this is such an emotional and wonderful part of the movie, my words simply cannot describe.
4917;Kudos to Christopher Nolan for reviving the """"Batman"""" series and ending it on the high note it deserves!"""
4918;"The first great film of Summer 2005 comes in the form of ""Batman Begins""!"
4919;I have just seen this film today with high expectations.
4920;"The direction of Christopher Nolan (""Memento"", ""Insomnia"") was absolutely mesmerizing and powerful!"
4921;Bale brings a powerful presence and on.
4922;spot seriousness to the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman.
4923;In fact, Bale is 100 times better than both Val Kilmer and George Clooney, but the best Batman of all time will always be .
4924;"To me, Christian Bale's performance is about equal to Keaton's performance as Batman in the first two ""Batman"" films."
4925;"He must be more than a man
4926;As Batman, and with the help of his faithful servant Alfred (Caine), rising cop Jim Gordon (Oldman), and Wayne Enterprises weapons specialist Lucius Fox (Freeman), Bruce works to stop the city.
4927;Each element is familiar and, when tweaked, made more real than in previous incarnations.
4928;in conclusion, """"Batman Begins"""" is the ultimate Batman movie!"""
4929;Batman Begins has it all: an unforgettable cast, ground.
4930;pounding action, a mesmerizing and electrifying musical score, explosive special/visual effects, and dynamic storytelling!
4931;Batman Begins accomplishes the fact that it resurrects a fallen film franchise and an anti.
4932;A fresh restart deeply rooted in gritty realism, Begins finally does Bob Kane's legendary character the justice it commands.
4933;Michael Caine, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman round out the excellent cast.
4934;An intricate, intelligent and action packed triumph.
4935;Scrapping all previous Batman story lines, Christopher Nolan starts all over and brings a unique background to the Batman character .
4936;one that is more believable and convincing.
4937;story is gritty and realistically (enough) explains how Bruce learned to do all his stunts and terror tricks.
4938;Nolan's treatment of Batman allows Bruce Wayne's true identity to be completed obscured, something other Batman actors didn't fully achieve.
4939;The terror Bruce Wayne learned to instill in his opponents works impressively in this version, seen especially in Batman's first encounter, with the crooked cop, which is convincingly frightening .
4940;"fun elements are brought to the story by Lucius Fox, wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman, who works at Wayne Enterprises and supplies Batman with his arsenal of awesome military toys, my favorite of which is the new ""bat mobile"", which is probably the coolest tank ever created for the screen."
4941;It is a refreshing change from the outlandish and over.
4942;notable performances come from Michael Cain's Alfred, a capable man and lovable old friend, truly concerned for his master's well.
4943;liners, Gary Oldman as the good.
4944;Liam Neeson's mysterious Henri Ducard even proves to be more than a two.
4945;if the Joel Schumacher treatments (shudder) turned you off from the Batman series, you'll find this one will greatly surpass your expectations and may just become a favorite.
4946;Batman Begins is a wonderful blend of its comic book sources with realistic elements.
4947;It is slow to start, because it's starting over, but there's plenty of solid action, a great storyline and some witty and memorable dialog.
4948;This film is a gem in the Batman canon.
4949;Batman Begins explores the origins of the Batman legend and the Dark Knight's emergence as a force for good in Gotham.
4950;He returns to Gotham and unveils his alter.
4951;ego: Batman, a masked crusader who uses his strength, intellect and an array of high tech deceptions to fight the sinister forces that threaten the city.
4952;liked for adults, not for children though.
4953;however overall it was nice movie.
4954;This movie is one of the best I have seen.
4955;What a excellent and hot actor this guy is!
4956;The whole script was excellent.
4957;There was nothing wrong with it, everything done perfect.
4958;To be honest, I was a little wary upon hearing that ANOTHER Batman movie was going to be made, but this film does the legend justice.
4959;They both offer an experience and a mastery of their craft that is a pleasure to watch.
4960;Freeman, though not the father figure that Cain is, is a cunning friend to the young billionaire, and he provides lots of chuckles and smiles by the virtue of his excellent line delivery and facial expressions.
4961;I thoroughly enjoyed both of their performances.
4962;"He makes a great cop and a great ""good guy."")"
4963;Katie Holmes played Wayne's childhood friend Rachel Dawes, now a young lawyer with Gotham's D. a. office.
4964;Though her role wasn't large, I thought she turned in a solid performance.
4965;this was a fun action film, and I didn't think it was too violent for young families.
4966;This movie is a great way to reboot the Batman franchise.
4967;It has a decent plot and the action is fast.
4968;Batman Begins has more Bruce Wayne than Batman, which is a very good thing for me.
4969;"As the title says, I for one liked this film much more than its sequel ""The Dark Knight""."
4970;Liam Neeson's portrayal of Ra's al Ghul was excellent.
4971;Katie Holmes also played her part brilliantly.
4972;Christopher Nolan's story of the Dark Knight has gotten off to an excellent start with this film.
4973;This film helped me in an ethical/moral sense as well.
4974;One of my favorite quotes from this movie as spoken by Batman.
4975;great cast, cool use of villians and a decent script.
4976;the scarecrow was used very well in this story.
4977;To date, this is the best Matman movie yet.
4978;"Starring Christian Bale, Batman Begins is more ""true."
4979;Saw it in theaters with little expectations but I surprisingly really liked it.
4980;, then you'll be pleased just with the 2.
4981;It is really loaded with extras, presented in a comic.
4982;"I actually did not fall asleep during these extras
4983;This movie is the revival of the dead franchise, solid acting, crisp writing, and fresh visuals make this movie a must see.
4984;I am a big fan of Tim Burton's original Batman and I think this one is every bit as good as that one.
4985;Christian Bale is the best of all the Batmans to date.
4986;This movie has the best developed Bruce Wayne and still has great action sequences.
4987;This movie like other great comic book adaptations(Spiderman 2 and X. men 2) transcends the genre and is truly a great story and a great movie.
4988;The first disc is devoid of any features (except for the trailer and an MTV spoof), but the second disc is packed with just enough for this set to be worth the price.
4989;up that is made to resemble a comic book, so it is a bit tricky to navigate.
4990;It was a few dollars more than this version, but I enjoyed the little graphic novel.
4991;geek"
4992;Nolan and Co. gave us the most true vision we'll probably ever see.
4993;This is due to the fact that Batman beats up all his criminals and leaves them to be found by police.
4994;It really is a terrific movie and I know I'm gonna catch hell for saying this, but please, PLEASE .
4995;liked it but its pretty just a set up for the other movies.
4996;if you plan to watch this and not the others it wont be good.
4997;Batman Begins is my favorite movie of all time.
4998;Every young man should watch this movie as it features an all star father figure cast of Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and the immortal Liam Neeson.
4999;After the disastrous Batman and Robin in 1997, this is the movie Batman fans have dreamed about for years.
5000;BatMan Begins was a good summer movie no doubt.
5001;It's got a telented cast, a razor.
5002;sharp script, and a followable plot that's totally in synch with the legend.
5003;but for the most part, it's entertaining and dead.
5004;So much better than the previous movies from the 90's!
5005;See all the 3 new ones!!
5006;this movie is fantastic !!
5007;its dark , edgy, psychological.
5008;christian bale gives a excellent performance as bruce wayne /batman.
5009;his version ranks right up there with michael keaton's version of batman.
5010;dont even count as batman.
5011;By far the best Hi Def version release to date.
5012;Batman and Batman Returns were two of Tim Burton's finest work.
5013;in 2005 Christopher Nolan breathed life into the series with Batman Begins.
5014;plot: The movie details the origins of Batman as well as Bruce Wayne(played by Christian Bale).
5015;opinion: Batman Begins has a great storyline as well as interesting characters.
5016;Christian Bale is perfect as Batman/Bruce Wayne.
5017;He gives Batman more edge than the Batman of the Schumacher films ever had.
5018;Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred.
5019;Ra's Al Ghul and the Legion Of Shadows are interesting villians as well as Scarecrow(who uses a hallucinogenic gas that causes its victims to have a illusions about their worst fears).
5020;And I LOVE the new Batmobile.
5021;Its is a definite improvement of the last two Batman films and is worth the bucks.
5022;I dont know, those wounds run pretty deep but I can say that it is great step in the healing process and is an excellent installment to one of the best superhero movie series ever made.
5023;Batman is the best super hero out there.
5024;This is a great movie along with all of the other ones that are out now.
5025;As a comic book adaptation, it is average.
5026;the special effects are decent and the City looks real.
5027;The story of Boy Bruce Wayne is in line with the movie as a whole, as it is interesting in some some regards and unconvincing in many others.
5028;and like I said, the story is compelling and keeps you interested as it really is a story about revenge, and humanity, and any normal person can relate to what Bruce is going through in his life, as we have all lost loved ones, it just makes it that much more interesting.
5029;and the sets and special effects are just superb, not a lot of CGI was used in these movies either, which just adds to the talent and work that was put into these films, those sets of Gotham City were actually BUILT if you watch the documentaries, and the action sequences are very well done, as real as you can get for a fictional superhero movie.
5030;Batman Begins is truly not just a super hero film, but a wonderful work by Chris Nolan.
5031;This will become a classic masterpiece like vinyl.
5032;The first half of this film is visually pleasing, as Christopher Nolan no doubt can do (the opening scenes of a Tibetan.
5033;like snowy landscape is stunning).
5034;packed films that constantly throw one.
5035;It was interesting to see Katie Holmes on screen, but I though she was the weakest character .
5036;Just some good old ideas which are given one more round in this movie.
5037;When is there going to be a worthwhile movie that will make you think for yourself?
5038;This was such a great movie.
5039;The Dark Knight was so good that so often people forget how good Batman Begins was.
5040;The special features disc is so cool.
5041;What a phenomenal job they did with this movie!
5042;I loved the other films too but what a fantastic fresh start for a new series of Batman movies!
5043;This is the Batman film that we were waiting for!
5044;Everything about this movie was amazing!
5045;The cast, the sets, the characters, the soundtrack!
5046;The musical score by James Newton Howard (KING KONG) and Hans Zimmer is so intense!
5047;Everything about this movie is amazing!
5048;I hope that there are many to follow!
5049;Christian Bale was an excellent choice for the title character!
5050;I am a huge fan of his work now!
5051;"top Tom Wilkinson as it portrays Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman about as realistically as possible
5052;It has been said that a work of art tells us more about the artist than the subject matter in the art.
5053;This is particularly true in stories about comic book characters.
5054;I feel privileged to have lived in a time when so many good """"superhero"""" movies have been made."""
5055;As I get older, I enjoy fewer things, but I still enjoy a moral tale.
5056;a writing choice that respects the intelligence of the moviegoer.
5057;When is a person simply a facist by taking justice into their own hands?The movie also explores the important question of: How do you deal with the possibility that you may have been a contributing factor to the death of someone you love?
5058;i love this movie because it promotes these, and many other, ideals:1.
5059;i really appreciate the intelligence and creative force of Christopher Dolan and David Goyer's caring screenplay.
5060;This movie packs a great emotional punch, on par with Spiderman 2, another great movie.
5061;c. nOLAN has truly done a marvelous job.
5062;thorougly enjoyed it the 2nd time and will watch it again and again and again.
5063;first the picture and what a picture it is.
5064;It is a flawless transfer with absolutly stunning detail.
5065;The skin tones are beautiful and the colors accurate.
5066;One of the most impressive aspects of the picture is the rendition of the color black.
5067;Black levels are perfect with plenty of detail seen in the shadows.
5068;I dont think I have ever seen the color black presented so perfectly in a home movie before and there are alot of dark scenes in this film so that is one of the reasons why this transfer is so beautiful.
5069;My hats off to the people that were in charge of this transfer, its one of the best I have ever seen.
5070;The Batman begins soundtrack is an awsome one in general, very heavy in bass it just a wonderful mix that adds an extra oopmh to the action scenes like any good soundtrack should.
5071;Finally, a great Batman movie, but it was not to be.
5072;guy voicing was unintentionally funny.
5073;"if you are a fan of the comic, you'll probably love the film as it is much more true to the spirit of the series than the silly ""sequels""."
5074;This is a good Batman movie.
5075;It tells the story of Bruce Wayne's life as a child and the psychological factors that made him become what he is today (although the Frank Miller graphic novel .
5076;Batman: Year One, does it much better).
5077;bale made a better overall actor than any other.
5078;well i didnt see them without having to be shook awake,sorry)the bit players played their parts to the confines of their parts.
5079;one was very cool when he was on screen and the other was a surprise to me and not an outrageous one.
5080;and these days,originality is hard to come by.
5081;he is a nocturnal hero,hence,dark fight scenes.
5082;as cool as choreographed fight scenes(dance moves with kicking and punching)look,ill have mine realistic,thank you.
5083;i'm don't know what else tell about this movie, is EPIC and i love to wach it!
5084;i bought the entire trhilogy!
5085;Overall, it is a good movie specially for kids.
5086;Specially, this three movie series, is full of suspense, awesome gadgets (like Batman movies always have), and great effects!!!
5087;It was a great movie, I've been seen the 3 movies in a maraton and it was amazing!I hope to see more movies with all villains.
5088;Heir to a great fortune, Bruce uses his wealth and company resources to fight crime.
5089;Looked on by some as a menace, Batman continues to fight crime in his unorthodox way.
5090;Christian Bale does an wonderful job as Batman/Bruce Wayne.
5091;We see the man behind the hero.
5092;This movie is full of action.
5093;It makes you believe in The Batman.
5094;As usual Batman is a child's fantasy and my grandson absolutely loved this beginning movie as it explained all the characters etc etc.
5095;Its got a great and flawed super hero, action, thoughtful storyline and good acting.
5096;This movie was pretty good.
5097;The action was great and the story line about batman's beginning was terrific.
5098;At the end of the first Batman is when Batman gives the signal over to Gordon.
5099;Thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie.
5100;I would highly recommend it to anyone.
5101;The answer is yes, this is a great movie on all fronts.
5102;Christopher Nolan did a great job on this film, both the time of production, and budget of production.
5103;I was good and action pack, with a script that made a lot of sense.
5104;Otherwise it had a dark story and great special effects.
5105;I liked the movie just fine.
5106;This IS the definitive Batman film.
5107;it is a wonderful film in general.
5108;It is an origin story of one of America's most popular characters and it delves into the character of the Dark Knight in ways that have not been seen on the silver screen before.
5109;That's just a glimpse of the attention to detail that this movie takes into allowing us to know this character.
5110;He really has such a great character arc and we really feel for the character long before he ever dons the cape and cowl.
5111;the cast in the film is superb.
5112;Christian Bale does an incredible job as Bruce Wayne and Batman.
5113;They finally touch on this, and it is done beautifully.
5114;Also, Gary Oldman is wonderful as Lt. Jim Gordon .
5115;and thankfully this character is done in such an awesome fashion.
5116;Michael Caine really shines as Alfred and the character is portrayed wonderfully.
5117;Liam Neeson is spectacular (as always) as Henri Ducard, Bruce Wayne's mentor.
5118;Cillian Murphy is wonderfully twisted and creepy as the Scarecrow without being over the top whatsoever.
5119;And Morgan Freeman's performance is great (as always) in the few memorable scenes he is in.
5120;Katie Holmes also really gives a great performance as Bruce's lifetime friend and Gotham Assistant DA.
5121;Christopher Nolan and David Goyer wrote a great script with an incredibly touching and suspensful plot.
5122;The action scenes are really incredible as well, and all of the action is necessary to the plot and extremely well edited.
5123;one of the most wonderful things about this movie is the realism that is consistent throughout the movie.
5124;It really goes above and beyond the genre to create a very realistic movie that all audiences can thoroughly enjoy and appreciate at the same time.
5125;this movie is a MUST SEE, in my opinion, and a MUST OWN for anyone who likes having great movies to watch any time.
5126;It is an extremely fine film, and one of my favorites that I have ever seen.
5127;But it is a worthy addition to the Batman legacy, and worth the time and money if you enjoy the Batman story.
5128;I would recommend Batman Begins because it has a lot of action andbecause it had good movie flow.
5129;my experience with the film was good.
5130;I would watch it again because it was packed with action and exciting things happening all the time during the movie.
5131;I would also watch it again because the way that they went from scene to scene.
5132;It had good transitions between scenes.
5133;One other scene that was funny and full of action was when Bruce was trying to get the medicine to his girl friend.
5134;I loved the movie and I'm excited to see the next!
5135;I loved how Bruce Wayne became Batman and he did his part very well.
5136;:) Best movie of the year and I gotta say this again.
5137;I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit, but it may be a touch overrated.
5138;Adequate if not good performances by all members of the cast, especially Christian Bale, who comes across as interesting, charismatic, and likeable.
5139;Nonetheless, the Batman franchise seems to still be alive and well with this latest edition.
5140;It is a hero's journey, as in the old times.
5141;But, the journey is of his own making.
5142;This is a great movie that anyone would like.
5143;Lots of action and it's Batman enough said.
5144;Great image and sound that will make you swear it is all happening in front of you.
5145;The story is intriguing with a few really good surprises.
5146;just enough special effects to pull the audience in.
5147;the theme of fear is powerfully developed in the movie in Bruce's character development.
5148;He uses his fear of bats, something we discovered in the first minutes of the film, to strike fear in the hearts of criminals.
5149;A minor theme placed in opposition to fear is that of hope .
5150;"the good people of Gotham have hope in the face of the troubles of the city while the villians wish to use fear to destroy the city as a kind of ""cleansing process""."
5151;this film is incredibly casted and directed.
5152;I wished we could have seen a little bit more of Morgan Freeman who was perfect as always in the role of a genius scientist who designs all of Batman's gadgets.
5153;But even amid these greats Christian Bale steals the movie with the most convincing Batman yet .
5154;brooding yet driven to action, living a dual existence yet focused in his mission.
5155;the friendship and tension between Bruce and Alfred, well.
5156;acted by Michael Caine, are both portrayed well as we are shown Bruce's coming of age as a rich orphan.
5157;I rediscovered my love of Batman because of this movie.
5158;He's such a great character, and this movie just portrayed him so well.
5159;Christian Bale is by far the best Batman I could have ever asked for.
5160;Just amazing, is the only way to describe this movie.
5161;Ra's Al Guhl is hugely misrepresented and could of been a greater (if yet the best) batman enemy.
5162;There was the fighting scene at the end, bruce vs ninjas (good) and the batmobile chase.
5163;This movie was a great way to start the trilogy.
5164;It started off a little slow, but I loved the scarecrow.
5165;He is a great pshycological enemy, kind of like Psycho Mantis from MGS.
5166;Batman Begins is an amazing movie.
5167;It appeals to a wide range or people both old and young, fans and non fans.
5168;Forget the campy tv show and the ott Burton and Schumacker attempts, this truly represents the character, one which is deep and complex.
5169;Love the story, love the choice of casts.
5170;Would definitely watch this movie multiple times.
5171;'I'm not here to criticize the Dark KNight, because it really is a great movie that has everything.
5172;his origin, his philosophy, his characteristic, his agony, his struggle, his courage, his brilliance.
5173;for just weekend moviegoer, Dark Knight must be a Great Movie.
5174;Pure bliss in this blu.
5175;The movie was already solid, but the high def transfer is one of the best out there!
5176;Christopher Nolan is brilliant I love his vision and the way his mind works if only he could keep the series going and going past the upcoming the dark Knight rises!
5177;This film changed the whole face of movies by attempting to make a superhero seems almost real, bringing gritty realism to the world of DC and opening the door for more reboots.
5178;The blue ray is great and the added comic inside is cool.
5179;Great first movie of the series.
5180;An honest, believable tale of the Dark Knight.
5181;"the director's dogmatic insistence, ""Make it real."
5182;"make it real,"" paid off."
5183;This telling makes the story of Batman real and believable.
5184;"Of all the ""hero"" genre films I've ever seen this one is my favorite because of the aforementioned statement."
5185;The acting is top notch .
5186;"Michael Caine is a great ""Alfred"" and Lucias Fox's (Morgan Freeman) lines are great."
5187;The casting was well done and I am glad they included Rutger Hauer (a personal favorite because of his work in Blade Runner).
5188;but above all, this is the best telling of the Batman story .
5189;even better than in the comics .
5190;or even new fans to.
5191;This is one of the best Superhero films ever because is both entertainingbut at the same time, displays a kind of emotional intensity that I'venever seen before in the Batman Series.
5192;it's extremely well producedbut the MVP goes to Christian Bale (who finally gets to really touch 'em all as Batman).
5193;he's one of the finest actors of my generation!!
5194;Batman Begins shows that it is possible to have a well plotted movie, with CGI effects shine when you have a set of first rate actors playing the roles.
5195;from Bale, to Caine to the Cillian Murphy's absolutely PERFECT Dr. Craine and the even more perfect Liam Neeson the acting not only complements the action and CGI but rises above it.
5196;i've yet to see another picture this year that was so worth my money and worth yours.
5197;All of these Batman movies are excellent .
5198;well done and great story line.
5199;Enjoyed watching with my teens!
5200;Amazon streaming worked great, as well.
5201;"Batman Begins is an excellent retelling of Batman's origins (something's that never been properly done in the movies, except maybe in the cartoon movie ""Mask of Phantasm"") and brings the Dark Knight back to the mantel he stood upon before the late 1990s."
5202;That aside, I really have to commend the director .
5203;on bringing Batman into the silverscreen limelight, the plot was written quite well.
5204;It certainly was on par to the Batman Comics themselves and the dark themes of the series.
5205;The city used for Gotham City was such an amazing choice of the corrupt city .
5206;From the movie becomes very interesting.
5207;That aside, the actors chosen for the roles (comic book and original character alike) were also an excellent choice.
5208;Aside from Christian Bale and Michael Caine, other well known actors play their roles superbly.
5209;the action was sparely placed throughout the movie to develop the storyline and character, but when the action was thrown into motion it really captured your in the moment, especially the Tumbler/Batmobile scenes.
5210;Batman's fighting style was very Batman.
5211;All in all, Batman Begins managed to reel you in with its dark comic book style story telling set in a more realistic world that better reflected Bob Kane's universe, while maintaining the mystery of the plot until the very end.
5212;This is a film I would defiantly want to own.
5213;Out of all the Batman movies, I personally enjoyed this one.
5214;This version of Batman does a great job of standing on its own.
5215;recommended to anyone who enjoys DC, action, or just Batman movies.
5216;Batman is one of the greatest superheros of all time and yet over the years we have insulted him with crappy movies.
5217;Let's move on and put all that behind us.
5218;Batman Begins is not only a rebirth for the Batman franchise but it is also one of the best superhero flicks to date.
5219;Christian Bale is a great Bruce Wayne and a great Batman . . . unlike some of his predecessor who could only pull off one or the other.
5220;The new twist on the Batman myth is so well conceived.
5221;Great story, great cast, great acting, awesome special effects . . . I was totally satisfied.
5222;I heard this is to be a trilogy like Spiderman . . . I hope the other two films will hold up to the standard of the first
5223;"It was nice to see Liam Neeson play that ""wise master"" role that he's pulled off so well before, but now with a villainous twist."
5224;In conjunction with my opening remark, it was nice to see a lesser.
5225;sometimes we have to make do with what we can find in the garage, and it worked out for the better here.
5226;These and others are just as great to watch as their more theatrical counterparts.
5227;"As for the good guys, there's a ""dream team"" cast that is so worth watching."
5228;Katie Holmes was good as Bruce Wayne's friend and love interest Rachel Dawes, but I can't think of anything truely memorible about her role.
5229;good, but I don't really remember anything else about her.
5230;And finally, there is Batman himself, played by Christian Bale.
5231;Apart from that, this is a new Batman whom the city of Gotham and fans of all ages can stand behind as he embarks on his journey across the rooftops.
5232;And with this film's excellent plot, it will indeed be quite the journey.
5233;this is very entertaining for all ages.
5234;Awesome transfer to a great movie.
5235;The picture and sound has never looked so good.
5236;The special effects shots were good, but by the time the big.
5237;They FINALLY got somebody who can do a good Bruce Wayne AND Batman!
5238;"This film is NOT better than ""Batman Returns"" or ""Batman Forever""!"
5239;Both of these movies had incredible, tour.
5240;Schumacher's Gotham City was a little more dazzling, as well.
5241;"The character ""Ra's Al Ghul"" is also misrepresented here as well."
5242;english background in the comic books, working entirely for himself.
5243;Ra's Al Ghul is also a middle.
5244;Scarecrow is ALSO a relative newbie!
5245;all in all, it's a nice diversion, but if you could re.
5246;It has much more respect for the material.
5247;For the first time a I actually believed that we were watching the real Batman for once.
5248;Michael Cane was exceptional as Alfred and Morgan Freeman was one of the best choices for Batman's Q, as I call him.
5249;Q in the Bond movies created all the devices Bond utilizes in his missions.
5250;It was a winner from start to finish.
5251;In fact, even if you don't care for Batman orany of his costumed colleagues, you can still enjoy this film as a goodaction.
5252;It doesn't thrive on special effects and big actionscenes but offers a decent story with lots of attention to characterdevelopment.
5253;Of course, Batman Begins is much darkerthan Richard Donner's beauty, but the evolution of both main charactersfrom youths, coming to terms with who they are, to caped crusaders isdepicted in a similar way.
5254;In fact, Christopher Nolan has even goneone better than Tim Burton and created a credible movie with a goodstory, realistic characters and the filthiest setting the world'sDarkest Knight has ever called home.
5255;"It used to be that comic book movie offering defines clearly who the bad and good guys are
5256;I find it quite a breath of fresh air by """"deconstructing"""" parts of Batman."""
5257;Ultimately, the production is sleek by introducing new elements to freshen up the franchise and yet, not overdoing it to the extent that it sidelines the Batman fans of the past such as myself.
5258;I guess it's true to say that this movie allows us to have a cake and eat it too.
5259;hearted jokes which are mainly done superbly by the veterans such as Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman.
5260;It's really wonderful to see Rutger Hauer back to the silver screen once again.
5261;The casting for Batman Begins is impeccable with so many heavy weight actors.
5262;Hans Zimmer soundtrack is as heroic and compelling as always.
5263;done movie that keeps audience talking after the end credit rolls out.
5264;Highly recommended to be watched on the big screen.
5265;It's a good movie, it's mindless fun .
5266;"Bale is a good actor, and ""suits"" his part ."
5267;"In other words
5268;he live at night climbing over roof tops jumping of , silently entering up on his enemies, my, my it was fun.
5269;Truly a well put together story , the action makes this the classic Batman.
5270;The action and acting of Bale and our loveable Michael Cain fits well together.
5271;Great movie, when the dark Knight comes out lets hope the use Bale again and he comes to the call.
5272;put it in your library,this is the classic.
5273;I'm not a huge Batman fan, but this is a really good take on a superhero movie.
5274;The whole series is pretty awesome and this is a good start to it.
5275;Great pacing, great back story, great character evolution and of course awesome gadgets.
5276;this film is the best about BATMAN.
5277;So imagine my surprise when I finally watched Batman Begins and found a movie version of the Dark Knight that could have been taken from the comics.
5278;christian Bale gives the definitive Batman portrayal in this excellent film and he is joined by an entire cast of amazing actors that give life to characters of the comic mythology"
5279;at its core this movie is about fear and how it is dealt with (and dealt out) and director Christopher Nolan has captured that theme and embedded into every scene and nuance, and the actors, Bale in particular, keep a veneer of fear over their performances that adds to their realism.
5280;Batman Begins is one of the best Batman movies yet.
5281;I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie was, and what a great job Christian Bale (American Psycho) did.
5282;man movies this has just the right amount of action and drama.
5283;man and it is truly worth checking out.
5284;I really liked Batman Begins when I saw it in the theatre and I pop it in every so often.
5285;"like the movie ""Equilibrium' he showed a cool, stoic side, obsessed with his mission."
5286;Like a True Ninja, he worked everything into his repetoir.
5287;For Father's Day, my son and I went to see the fifthin a series of Batman movies.
5288;Atrue fan of this big screen sequence, I thought thisprequel was refreshing, exciting.
5289;What Idiscovered was that Batman has a heart.
5290;stop special effects, violence and thrills.
5291;director Christopher Nolan took this opportunity togive Batman a heart.
5292;granted, the action builds in the last 30 minutes andthere's an awesome Batmobile chase, but the true meritof this film is the heart of Batman.
5293;Bale turns in ahighly believable performance as the viewer discoverswhy Bruce became the comic book hero of the 50's.
5294;the music and sound holds this flick together.
5295;perhaps the finest performance is turned in by cinemalegend Michael Caine as Batman's butler.
5296;but because us viewers expected more action based onits predecessors, I give it an 4.
5297;This is a great Batman movie .
5298;Very entertaining movie and I highly recommend if you like superhero movies.
5299;Batman Begins has enough plot elements for 3 or 4 movies, and, amazingly, they all work, and they are all exciting.
5300;even the early scenes, of Bruce Wayne's childhood trauma with the bats, and his later trek to the lamasery, are interesting in themselves, and add a lot of emotional weight to the later scenes.
5301;the acting is just superb.
5302;Gary Oldman, who is one of the best actors ever, manages to be humble and awe.
5303;inspiring at the same time.
5304;Morgan Freeman is understated and funny and riveting.
5305;Cillian Murphy is deliciously creepy.
5306;And even Christian Bale, who has the expressive range of a tree.
5307;stump, manages to be believable, likable, and complex.
5308;Lots of twists and turns.
5309;part of the love of Batman and comics in general is the art and the editions in the special edition set are really nice in that aspect.Year One is a cult classic in the telling of Batman, and there are alot of liberties taken in this film that die hard fans could raise an eyebrow at, but overall this movie is by far the best in the series.
5310;"ray it looks amazing
5311;I bought this for my boyfriend who is a huge batman fan and he had a smile on his face for a week.
5312;I also enjoyed it, the Batman mythos always interested me.
5313;This movie and its sequels will hold the mantle of """"best superhero trilogy"""" for a long time, I predict."""
5314;i've seen 2 times and see again.
5315;"anyway, still better than all the ""original"" Batman movies."
5316;Very well made and well developed plot.
5317;Christian Bale is awesome as Bruce Wayne/Batman!
5318;A great start to a trilogy that was a masterpiece.
5319;I wanted to know everything about Batman Begins and this is why I wanted the two.
5320;disc version of Batman Begins!
5321;Being one of the highly anticipated movies of 2005, I just had to go see this movie when it released.
5322;After watching `Batman Begins' I can easily say that this was like a breath of fresh air from the previous movies.
5323;Of course, during all this, also includes his relationship with Rachel, overcoming his fears and learning the difference between justice and revenge.
5324;there are many reasons as to why I loved this movie.
5325;I'm sure that fans of the comics will already know the whole history behind Batman, but for some people like me, it is a roller coaster ride of suspense and surprises.3) Finally, how Christopher Nolan managed to balance the emotional scenes to the crime fighting scenes throughout the movie.
5326;christopher Nolan (who directed other great movies like `Insomnia' and `Mememto') continues showing his talent in `Batman Begins'.
5327;Christian Bale gives a wonderful performance as Batman, the dark knight.
5328;Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, and Gary Oldman play their role well.
5329;I was actually surprised by how Katie Holmes has matured in his acting abilities.
5330;on the whole, whether you are a fan of Batman or not, you will definitely enjoy this movie.
5331;This is a great movie and keeps the viewers glued to the seats.
5332;The Dark Knight Trilogy is a must watch.
5333;As a family, we enjoy collecting movies and their sequels then watching them in series over a weekend or two.
5334;all very interesting to watch in order.
5335;batman Begins was an excellent movie, well directed and acted, and really brought home the 'beginning' to us.
5336;Enough action to keep the whole clan entertained, enough brooding darkness to give us the feel of Bruce Wayne's conflict, and superb filming/cinematography.
5337;He is truly a master at his craft.
5338;An excellent reboot of the franchise with an excellent backstory.
5339;The disc printing is excellent with a lot of dark scenes.
5340;This is the best version of the Batman storylines.
5341;The first Batman movie with Michael Keaton was good, the rest I did not like.
5342;"But this one, which ""explained"" how Batman came to be, was very good."
5343;I've always liked movies that attempted to explain how certain characters came to be, especially when the character as originally created sort of pops up out of nowhere and you are asked to accept they are what they are with little or no background.
5344;"great stories, seen many of the movies that have been made, but ""Young Sherlock Holmes"" provided some background that helped put a lot of the stories into perspective."
5345;10/10 Notably, a great piece on the Batmobile.
5346;Batman has been aound ever since the 40's and is still regarded as one of the most critically acclaimed super dynamic mega ultra hyper beamer heroes without poweres of all time.
5347;The movie is a modern storytelling of the Batman franchise, it is a much more realistic retelling of the series.
5348;"This movie is great but the next one ""THE DARK KNIGHT"" is a a masterpeice because of the late Heath Ledger who plays a masterful JOKER/."
5349;the begining of the batman saga that take the bat from the obsecurity of the the bat mipples throws all of that out and starts anew with a great actor, great crew and great director.
5350;First, Bruce Wayne attempting to come to terms with his demons.
5351;"the highlight of the film shows how Bruce Wayne came to being the ""Batman""."
5352;Ah, the fantasy of fiction.
5353;nevertheless, BATMAN BEGINS carries its weight with a parade of well.
5354;Batman begins is a good movie.
5355;suit and utility belt are still imaginative.
5356;Bale is great as the Caped one.
5357;Caine, Freeman, and Hauer are memorable in supporting action.
5358;take a Date to this movie, you'll both enjoy it.
5359;The way it starts out to show how Batman came to be was very interesting to me.
5360;Batman Begins, takes you behind the scene of Bruce wayne's animosity towards the criminal mind and therefore gives clarity on the way he becomes Batman.
5361;Bruce's journey to self discovery was quite believable embarcking the taste of desperate while learning the patterns of criminals.
5362;What I really enjoyed about the movie was watching Bruce Wayne's metamorphis into Batman.
5363;The director took great care in showing the audience the difference between Bruce Wayne the man and Batman the Ideal.
5364;An unforseen twist takes place when Bruce is confronted by a man who becomes his teacher.
5365;He is completely comfortable with the role of Batman and at home in his mansion at Wayne's mannor.
5366;Christian has a natural chemestry with his butler and loyal employee Morgan Freeman.
5367;Of Course Gary Oldman does a perfect job as Officer Gordan.
5368;All in all the cast was well organized and perfectly matched!
5369;I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of this movie and recommend this to any super hero, comic fan who enjoys the history of his heros as much as the adventures.
5370;Several friends and co. workers had been telling me to go see it.
5371;I took a chance and saw it and was blown away by how good it is.
5372;loved the Scarecrow and the plot.
5373;The marriage of comic books and the movies has had a stormy relationship.
5374;"directed ""Batman"" films, the X. men movies, and the Spiderman films, while the duds have included ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" ""The Hulk,"" ""Spawn,"" ""Hellboy,"" as well as last summer's ""Fantastic Four""."
5375;Batman Begins belongs to the success category.
5376;Revamping the Batman mythos somewhat, director/screenwriter Christopher Nolan has a genuine respect for the character and does a superb job of crafting a tale that makes Bruce Wayne an even more tragic individual whose obsession with fighting crime is only equaled by his drive to prove himself as a man worthy of his family's name and reputation.
5377;hits) films, is deserving of a wider audience and the popularity of this film has gotten him noticed by filmgoers that may not have seen his other films.
5378;He assays his role wonderfully and can only be better in the subsequent sequel.
5379;"Chameleon actor Gary Oldman gets to be a ""hero"" as he portrays a young ""Jim Gordon,"" the character that would later become Batman's ally in the police department."
5380;the great dialogue in the script allows each character to deliver at least one ZINGER line, something that was sorely missed in the first X. men film.
5381;"the ""look"" of the film, though reminiscent of the Burton films, has enough of an individuality that makes it refreshingly new."
5382;"At first, I thought it hideous, but when I saw it in action, I found it to be the perfect tool for ""The Dark Knight""."
5383;if the makers of the new Superman film do half the job that Nolan, Bale, and company did on this one, they should have a winner of their hands.
5384;if you like any of the batman series you will really enjoy this.
5385;Great special effects and gritty plot.
5386;Wanted it for my nephew Mason to see.
5387;This is the dark side of DC comic come to life.
5388;Batman has always been the most complex and interesting superhero.
5389;Not exactly well written.Yet these scenes as a cult knight, with Liam Neeson's cult leader, are the best in the film.
5390;while this is the 'hip' Batman, the Batman.
5391;joker axis with Nicholson was truly more complex and interesting.
5392;I like Tim Burton's vision of Gotham far more as well.
5393;First of all, it actually had good actors in it.
5394;I think Keaton is the best Batman/Wayne but Bale did very well.
5395;Caine was perfect as Alfred (though I will miss Michael Gough) and Gary Oldman (a great actor anyway) reminded me exactly of Gordon from the animated series from the 90's.
5396;"Secondly, the storyline was awesome
5397;It brought the dark back in the Dark Knight and showed the origins and training with the ninjas.
5398;The scarecrow was a perfect villain to have and a great addition to the Joker (Nicholson), Catwoman (Pfeiffer), and the Penguin (DeVito) and was actually somewhat scary.
5399;I recommend for all (whether you are a fan or not).
5400;I've always been a fan of the Batman series.
5401;The movies were great looking with great action, but they seemed to have a huge difficulty understanding why and how a rich orphan would be compelled to vigilante justice and dress like a flying mammal.
5402;christopher Nolan, in this latest and greatest installment, has made an entire film on the premise of that question.
5403;One of the things I loved about the film was the fact that it took time to develop Gotham's history.
5404;By the end of the film little has actually gotten better, but Gotham has a symbolic hope from their new hero.
5405;It provides honesty and realism to a genre that so often lacks it.
5406;the best superhero film of all time
5407;I love being able to watch movies on Amazon and the Batman trilogy is great.
5408;It is my first time watching the trilogy and look forward to watching them again.
5409;and it takes the cake when it comes to scares.
5410;Batman: Dead End?The performances are spirited, the film has a punchy pace and the music is sweeping and graceful.
5411;it was good but it lacked the zest and passion of the comic.
5412;Batman Begins is exactly what it sounds like, the early years of Bruce Wayne/Batman and his motivations.
5413;christian Bale is the perfect choice for Christopher Nolan's Batman and I am not saying that like a good thing.
5414;The real tragedy of Batman is that he is destined not to have a normal life in his persuit of his rather un.
5415;when Bruce finally dons the mask, it's an introduction of an action film character and not so much a myth or a legend.
5416;Al Ghul, in the comics, was depicted as larger than life figure who is looked up to by his minions as a god and speaks like a biblical figure"
5417;He wants to rid the world of man entirely so he can restore to it's natural beauty.
5418;pilot was a nice touch for some decent humor.
5419;"Now I can came closer to anyone with a Batman movie and say ""THIS is Batman""."
5420;A man that trained his phisic, mind, a great criminologist, detective, scientist, fighter, THIS was the Batman that we waited to see all these years on the big screen.
5421;that's very interesting something that Goyer did, in get elements from the firts Batman comics in the late 60's and 70's (Bob Kane, Bill Finger, Denny O'Neal, Neal Adams), like the Wayne family getting off of a Opera House, and the new writers, like Frank Miller (Batman Year One, Dark Knight).
5422;The movie is trully inspired on the story in the comic Batman Year One, but most of the time centered on Bruce Wayne/Batman.
5423;The Batman, the playboy Bruce Wayne and the real Bruce Wayne.
5424;He got the right spirit and idea behind the complex mind of his character and did an amazing job!
5425;definitely, this is the REAL and only one adaptation from Batman to the movies.
5426;ray with a box like that.
5427;It is exciting to finally reach an understanding of why there is such acharacter called Batman.
5428;The product was excellent and the transaction was fast, accurate and flawless.
5429;It is a great product with prompt, couteous service.
5430;I have to say, it was the best motion picture treatment of Batman, both the character and the story, I have ever seen.
5431;I have to give full credit to Christopher Nolan, who brought this film together.
5432;With his cast, which includes Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Tom Wilkinson, and Morgan Freeman (just to name a few), Nolan has woven a great, dramatic tale of the birth of Batman, making it seem an inevitable, logical conclusion of the tragedy that befalls the young Bruce Wayne, and enfusing it with a sense of realism which all of the previous movies did not have.
5433;the direction and cinematography are excellent, from the opening frame (with the flying bats suggesting the Batman logo) to the closing frames (the remnants of Wayne Manor, and the conversation with Gordon).
5434;the acting is superb as well.
5435;"I do believe that Bale was an excellent choice for the lead
5436;The supporting cast is all excellent, with a stand.
5437;out performance by Neeson, and a touching, human performance by Caine.
5438;Great choices here, all around.
5439;i'm going to have to see this movie again, perhaps in IMAX.
5440;What we see first is Bruce Wayne, his tragic childhood and the burdens he carries as an adult, and finally the choices he makes that turn him into a symbol for hope in the face of dark times and evil people.
5441;This is how we come to understand how a man can become so driven, so focused, so honed and balanced, like a weapon always prepared to strike.
5442;The first act of """"Batman Begins"""" shows us not only his physical training, but his mental and spiritual rigor as well."""
5443;and then, when he does finally don the familiar cowl and cape, it is so much more powerful, so much more bellievable than it ever has been before.
5444;We see a man who understands what the nature of fear is, and for the rest of the film he uses it against his enemies, the criminals who are tearing his city apart, and those who threaten to tear it down completely.
5445;"Because as much as ""Batman Begins"" is about the creation of the legend that is Batman, it is also about fear."
5446;Bruce Wayne understands this when he puts on the mask and the cape, and one of his foes understands it as well.
5447;The casting is ideal, from Christian Bale as the best Bruce Wayne/Batman dichotomy to ever grace the screen, to Gary Oldman as the perfect Sergeant (soon to be Commissioner?)
5448;well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
5449;The direction of Christopher Nolan captures with crystal clarity, and for the first time on screen, the dual aspects of the Batman character .
5450;the man, and the hero.
5451;The musical score, a unique partnership of Hans Zimmer's dramatic style and James Newton Howard's understated themes, suits the film beautifully, carrying the dramatic aspects while avoiding the use of a catchy theme.
5452;paced, with a good blend of finely.
5453;tuned character development and high.
5454;octane action to keep it interesting, leading up to a pulse.
5455;pounding conclusion that will leave you breathless.
5456;book hero and deals with it in a real.
5457;Both films share a grounding in reality, a hope that things can be better than they are, and an emotional center which should resonate in even the most cynical heart.
5458;"Chances are good that if you like ""Unbreakable,"" you'll like ""Batman Begins,"" and vice."
5459;a complex character who is both legend and man, who looks his fear in the eye and brings a new understanding of fear to his enemies, who buries himself inside a cocoon built of his own doubts, fears, and guilt but emerges as a changed man, free to fly above darkened streets.
5460;Batman Begins is certainly one of the best comic.
5461;book movies ever made, primarily because it treats the subject seriously and honestly, but more than that, it is a challenging film that confronts the subject of fear and the nature of heroism head.
5462;After reading the comic, there is nothing in the movie that was drawn from this 'Year One' storyline, other than the premise that it shows Batman in the starting years.
5463;to review this movie, I wanted to know how true it was to the comic book.
5464;Having said that, this is probably the best Batman movie made.
5465;cristian Bale is great, and I'm glad to hear he has signed up to do more movies.
5466;If you've seen any of the previous Batman movies and like it, then you have to go see this one!
5467;Good movie, I bought the whole trilogy
5468;awesome movie in my opinion.
5469;Batman Begins reivents and restarts the Batman movie franchise with an excellent story concerning Batman's origins and how he came to be.
5470;Saving his mentor's life, Bruce returns to Gotham.
5471;excellent acting, Christain Bale IS Bruce Wayne and Batman.
5472;Completely believeable and very real.
5473;Batman is placed in a world where he can exist, without making the audiece feel like they're watching a fantasy movie.
5474;katie Holmes is good as Bruce's childhood frined Rachel Dawes.
5475;She wasn't in the oomics, and for creating a character from scratch, David S. Goyer did an excellent job.
5476;michael Cane, Alfred Pennyworth, a wonderful performance, with the charm and witty humor that is perfectly associated with Alfred Pennyworth, love watching him.
5477;all in all, a wonderful Batman movie, the story's top notch.
5478;The cinematography is fantastic, the action sequences will blow you away.
5479;about the Extras:The second disc contains documentaries regarding the origins of Batman, the making of the movie, the comic books and how they made the Tumbler for the movie.
5480;If you're a sucker for special features, wich I am, you'll love this disc.
5481;This movie was great, had a good story behind it and never had a boring moment.
5482;"Director Christopher Nolan (Memento and Insomnia) and star Christian Bale (The Machinist) resurrect the popular caped crusader in the remarkable summer blockbuster ""Batman Begins""."
5483;With a striking new disguise and some high.
5484;Batman Begins is one of the finest comic book adaptations to hit the big screen.
5485;"liners that deteriorated the ""Batman"" franchise."
5486;This impressive comic book movie contains a well structured and engrossing plot, solid emotional depth, dazzling action sequences and fine performances.
5487;Christian Bale is certainly engaging as the emotionally tortured Bruce Wayne.
5488;The special features are the same as in the previous 2.
5489;scenes featurettes that deeply explore the making of the 2005 blockbuster, a few picture galleries and its theatrical trailer.
5490;Tankman Begins is a funny spoof of the film that was broadcasted during the 2005 MTV Movie Awards.
5491;"With such terrific presentation and worthy extras, ""Batman Begins"" gets a solid ""A""."
5492;As a kid, I was hooked on the original Batman television series with Adam West.
5493;"Have enjoyed the ""Dark Knight"" cartoons and all the movies."
5494;We also see Bruce retiring from the priviledged world to understand crime so he can fight it better.
5495;Bruce returns to his hometown and becomes Batman to help rein in on the crime spree that threatens to turn the town into a modern.
5496;christian Bale is my favorite actor portraying Batman.
5497;earth humor fits what I think of Bruce Wayne.
5498;At last, an actor truly worthy of the role.
5499;"I think ""Batman Begins"" is a very nice beginning indeed."
5500;I hope they will continue and redo the old Batman stories.
5501;Christopher Nolan's grand idea of putting Batman in a realistic setting has done nothing but stamp out the magic we used to feel.
5502;Stripping a superhero and his world of their fantasy takes away something crucial: the film can't take us away with it.
5503;Goyer transforms him into just another stock villain, blowing his chance to bring a character on par with the Joker to the silver screen.
5504;He's genuinely creepy, and he fills the screen.
5505;But Batman's a creature of vengence.
5506;And this movie's Batman works through his issues like a therapy patient, leaving him with no need for vigilance.
5507;The first two movies transcended the comic book genre.
5508;They had genuine artistry in them.
5509;the special features offer us a glimpse at the new Dark Knight film.
5510;well at least 6 minutes worth.
5511;With powerful direction, a mixture of elegant performances and a dash of just enough special effects, this truly is a beginning worth remembering.
5512;While some moments lead this viewer to think corn was about to be popped right off the ear, the action quickly deviates into a darker alley that allows one to savor the moment of a deep breath.
5513;Lots of room for thoughtfulness and threads to think about.
5514;Batman Begins (Christopher Nolan, 2005)Nolan finally shows us that Memento wasn't a fluke with Batman Begins.
5515;series mythos, he starts from scratch again, giving us the story of Bruce Wayne (The Machinist's Christian Bale, giving his second fantastic performance in two years) in the years leading up to his becoming Batman, as well as the first months of his superhero status.
5516;while Bale's performance is quite good, there's no way he could have pulled this off by himself.
5517;"He's got a bigger budget this time, though
5518;book incarnation (at least, the comic.
5519;the best Batman film to date by a wide margin.
5520;It's good to see Nolan's found his chops again.
5521;I wanted to see it again after seeing The Dark Knight Rises.
5522;The first movie in what turned out to be an amazing trilogy.
5523;Christian Bale was at his best and Christopher Nolan was too!
5524;The notion of a prequel is fine: you explore the origins of certain characters and add new dimensions to it while keeping within the same universe that fans expect.
5525;As this kind of exercise, this is pretty good.
5526;Gotham City declined from greatness.
5527;Is this the stuff that should stimulate the imagination?
5528;recommended as throw away entertainment.
5529;batman is a must for blu ray
5530;I think that this was a great origin story.
5531;Michael Caine is a great as Alfred.
5532;(Mark Hamill will forever be The Joker in my mind, and let's face it Jack was just being Jack, not the Clown Prince of Crime) Great film, score, acting, action, plot, etc.
5533;The ending just sets up the sequels so beautifully.
5534;Batman Begins is the Batman film I've been waiting for.
5535;And Bale made Batman frightening (i. e. the scene where he takes out Falcone's thugs, and the scene where he interogates Flass) Anyway, it's not just an amazing comic book movie, it's an amazing movie, and the first live action Batman movie to get it right.
5536;Really enjoyed watching this on my Kindle, great movie in the new Batman Trilogy.
5537;Christopher Nolan's reinventing of the Batman franchise is more than a good Batman movie.
5538;To really appreciate Chris Nolan's """"Batman Begins,"""" one has to also understand two other things."""
5539;The first is the character of Batman, his core and the continuing appeal.
5540;as to Batman (or The Batman, if you like), his enduring appeal has always been based upon his nature: tortured, borderline psychotic.
5541;But Burton's vision, while taking distinct liberties with the Batman canon, was nonetheless dark.
5542;making to directors and writers who respect the core material, and you will sell movie tickets AND toys.
5543;so the suits got out of the way, and in their place entered Chris Nolan, a director who respected the source material, and one who had a vision of the story he wanted to tell.
5544;but what a first appearance it is.
5545;This Batman is all business.
5546;"the rest of the cast is magnificent, with the glaring exception of Katie Holmes, an ""actress' whose least egregious sin is being just too darn young for the part she is portraying."
5547;The rest of the casting, however, is sheer genius.
5548;this is a movie for both fanboys and casual viewers alike.
5549;toys told for the first time ever, and less involved viewers (IF they can sit through the first half of the film) will find themselves glued to the edge of their seats as a truly memorable story is told.
5550;In this movie Batman truly and finally BEGINS, and it is very good to have him back.
5551;And this time he and his cast of crew are way too preachy, and Batman himself is no fun, or has no sense of fun much like the predecessors before him.
5552;And I thought the complaining of the campy Batman's was out of place, well this is a prime example of what happens when all the fun is soaked out of the Batman series.
5553;The villains are many, and extremely entertaining.
5554;Batman begins may have taken what was missing frrom the old movies but he forgot to give us the colors, the fun dialoge and the joy of Batman here we have a scary, dark drama.
5555;This movie has NOTHING to do with the other four.
5556;it is a clean slate.
5557;Though once thought of as lame and corny, superhero movies like this one show that they can be moving and thoughtful films.
5558;He receives great resistance along the way, especially from Dr. Jonathan Crane, aka The Scarecrow, played a deliciously villainous Cillian Murphy.
5559;As Batman unravels The Scarecrow's plot, he is determined to do all he can to stop him.
5560;Batman Begins brings a kind of emotional tension not normally seen in superhero movies.
5561;"In this and other ways, ""Batman Begins"" soars to new heights and proves that superhero movies do not have to be cheesy and over the top, but can prove to be excellent movies that rival any of the great ones of 2005."
5562;Both Christian Bale and Cillian Murphy pulled off their roles quite well for one being the hero and the other as the villain.
5563;The other actors were great too, including Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman.
5564;He subsequently walks a very fine line between administering justice and exacting revenge.
5565;Already traumatized as he is, Bruce is still a good guy due to his all.
5566;we see a young Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) who is destined to become Gotham City's police commissioner in the future.
5567;"Their early partnership thus lays critical foundation for why Gordon and Batman work together in subsequent years
5568;morgan Freeman also stars as Lucius Fox, a family friend who helps Bruce create the Batman personna.
5569;He is a scientist in the then.
5570;This man's name simply oozes talent.
5571;According to this screenplay, he is Batman's first 'big villan'.
5572;The special effects department did a wonderful job with the character, I definently was terrified after seeing this character throughout the screen play.
5573;Bale brings the perfect match of sensitivity and unbalancw that is essentially needed for this part (Batman IS fundamentally a vengange gig from a disturbed milionare) and I know this film is going to be a blockbuster of the summer, if not the year.
5574;i am also willing to predict Batman Begins generates renewed interest in the Batman concept.
5575;There is a sense that Batman really is starting but is serious about wanting to do a good job of eliminating crime.
5576;awaited period of revival both as a crime fighting force to be recokned with and a box office blockbuster to see.
5577;This is a great movie and very stunning in BR.
5578;What can I say, Christian Bale is the best Batman yet!
5579;tech action of the two movies seemed amusing along with how Batman was now being portrayed as more of a happy go lucky crime fighter rather then a """"dark knight""""."""
5580;New director Christopher Nolan takes the whole experience of the movie closer to the feel of the comic books, something true fans are bound to appreciate.
5581;A darker edgier batman is portrayed by Christian Bale who is probably the best Batman yet.
5582;There have been many dissapointed fans who have complained about the previous two batman movies, but rest assured there prayers have been answered with this masterpiece
5583;com is giving it 4 1/2 stars.
5584;We get a Batman movie that is worth the typeinstead of a run of the mill action film with a boatload of well known (and popular at the time) actors.
5585;the movie starts with Bruce Wayne as a little boy andspends a great deal of the first half of the moviegoing in detail about how and why Bruce Wayne becameBatman.
5586;It really is a nice change from what the serieshas been doing the last two sequels.
5587;christian Bale is very convicing as Bruce Wayne and Ihad a great feeling that he would fit the part.
5588;I thought MichaelCane was very underrated and brought good humor tothe Alfred character.
5589;this movie won me over when it put character develop.
5590;the rest of the cast was just too notch and itshows that a good balance of acting can make a moviework more than a movie with one great proformer or twocan.
5591;Michael Keaton was infinitely superior.
5592;Nice start to the trilogy.
5593;Christian Bale makes a great Batman and Liam Neeson did a great job displaying a particular set of skills in this movie
5594;Christian Bale should be a fine batman.
5595;He has the dark look necessary for such a role.
5596;I am looking forward to this movie and hope that many others are as well.
5597;It was the movie I ordered and what else can you ask for than that!
5598;Obviously the film looks great, the transfer is perfect.
5599;An emotionally gripping and uplifting take on the Batman mythos, Batman Begins focuses on how Bruce Wayne became Batman an does so with a solid storyline and exceptional acting.
5600;This is a movie you can watch on a bad day to uplift and inspire you to face the gritty world and prevail.
5601;i highly recommend this movie to anyone with a pulse.
5602;"this film serves the same function for the previous ""Batman"" movies that the ""Star Wars"" prequels do for the original ""Star Wars."""
5603;Batman Begins succeeds primarily because it paints its central figure in realistic, believable terms.
5604;It takes us step by step through the process by which Wayne transforms himself into Batman, not just in terms of the physical accoutrements that go into making up his superhero persona but the psychological development he must undergo before he can fully take on the superhero mantle.
5605;"Thus, ""Batman Begins"" works on the dual level of an action/adventure picture and a human drama."
5606;Batman Begins boasts fine art direction and special effects, exciting action sequences and first.
5607;"this is the best ""Batman"" movie to hit the big screen yet."
5608;I loved all three of the Batman movies with Christian Bale.
5609;They were all so good and exciting.
5610;But maybe we will be surprised.
5611;I'm not normally a big fan of comics or the movies they inspire, but i was very pleasantly surprised.
5612;Great start to Batman Series.
5613;it's going to be a wild ride for sure.
5614;This movie did a great job at illustrating the origin of Batman, and portraying him as the Dark Knight.
5615;the movie did a great job of overcoming the campiness of some of the earlier Batman movies.
5616;i hope they produce more Batman movies like this one.
5617;Morgan Freeman is in this movie I think he is good actor.
5618;This is the best Batman movie they've made so far.
5619;Christian Bale does an awesome job, and Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy are great as the villians.
5620;Katie Holmes isn't that great, but at least she's nice to look at.
5621;Also, it's cool that they actually did something good with the Scarecrow character.
5622;But they actually pulled Scarecrow off really well, and Murphy's natural creepiness fits perfectly.
5623;driven to become a costume vigilante to save Gotham City but also avenge the years.
5624;this was a pretty good film, though at times it took itself a tad too serious, hoping to escape the self.
5625;The best role here is actually Neeson's .
5626;he's much more interesting as a morally.
5627;Good Movie, a must see.
5628;I really enjoyed all the Batman series and now that Bale is him it is even better.
5629;All the action parts are just great.
5630;Just when you thought Batman had been relegated to the used video bin, along comes this exceptionally entertaining, brand spankin' new, fabulous new movie.
5631;Everything about it is wonderful .
5632;from the engrossing plot and concept to the hyper.
5633;The cast is terrific, headed up by a sexy, angry, smoldering Christian Bale as Batman, and Michael Caine, who has a delightful winking humor as Alfred.
5634;This movie, with its attention to detail, its heart.
5635;pounding soundtrack, and its smart, comic.
5636;book sensibility, gives you what so few summer movies do these days .
5637;a visceral thrill that makes you literally gasp.
5638;This latest Batman flick is much better than previous films.
5639;Action packed, great cast, and a little humor built in.
5640;it's well worth checking out.
5641;The movie is excellent, the High.
5642;def transfer is great, and while the extras aren't new, getting to watch them in a picture.
5643;picture commentary mode is very nice, presentation.
5644;Better to reprint comics that inspired the movies, like the ones that were re.
5645;also, you get a movie pass for the new Batman film, but it is only worth $7.50!
5646;And I bought the special edition thinking the cost of the movie ticket would reduce the added cost of the Limited Edition versus the standard Blu.
5647;Christian Bale is probably the best batman yet.
5648;I liked watching the film.
5649;It was fun and not too unrealistic and the story line was well designed.
5650;Great directing and acting in this Batman movie thank goodness tim burton isnt ruining the charter with garbage like Batman Forever!!!
5651;Christian Bale is a fantastic actor and is perfect for Batman.2.
5652;Very good character development of Alfred.7.
5653;Great teaser for next movie featuring the Joker.
5654;this is a great movie for the comic.
5655;My personal favorite was Bruce Wayne's learning process.
5656;he bounced off a number of roofs and walls before he figured things out!This movie was very entertaining, with lots of action.
5657;Michael Caine as Alfred the butler is a hoot!
5658;"After years of not having a Batman film and mostly due to the franchise hitting bottom thanks to Joel Schumacher's disastrous ""Batman forever"" and ""Batman and Robin"", Christopher Nolan present us his version of the character with an impressive all star cast anda story brilliantly written by David S. Goyer."
5659;Even though the detective part of Bruce's training is not even mentioned, the twist in which Ra's Al Ghul (Liam Neeson) is the one who trained him in the ninja arts and theatricality just makes their conflict more delightful and interesting.
5660;a new Gotham city is presented, much more like a NY city style, a new Batmobile (not as fancy as the previous ones but quite impressive) and a whole set of characters we expect to see in future releases, James Gordon (Gary Oldman who amazingly looks exactly as Jim in the comic), Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine), Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), Jonathan Crane, Carmine Falcone and Ra's Al Ghul.
5661;masterfully executed by the whole cast and brilliantly directed by Nolan, there are many of us looking forward for a sequel to this film.
5662;The disc 2 is organized in a comic book.
5663;I am sure this will be a piece fans of the comic book will enjoy.
5664;All extras are worthy of watching and I strongly recommend the 2 disc set, it is a 5 o 6 dollar difference that will compensate with all the facts and items found in the bonus materials.
5665;Christian Bale is the best Batman.
5666;Everything is done really cool.
5667;Wish they would make more but know this is the best.
5668;Look Memento is a great movie, but Nolan can't direct an action flick to save his life!
5669;Insted lets refrence to him at the end like an after thought with a Joker card.
5670;"Pretty much everything has already been said about this fantastic movie, which raised the comic book adaptation bar well beyond X. men, or even Spiderman, has been said
5671;that is the intent of the fight scenes and it is very accurate.
5672;There are plenty of movies to keep the mouth breathing, knuckle.
5673;Bonus star for great production.
5674;You will love it even if you aren't into the whole """"batman"""" thing, as it has a sense of realism."""
5675;I my opinion Christian Bale is the best Batman of all time.
5676;It has become one of my favorites!
5677;Batman Begins is the first truly great, instant classic film of the summer.
5678;Christopher Nolan's sweeping tale of one man's quest to bring justice to a dying, corrupt city is deadlocked with Sin City as 2005's best movie.
5679;Odd how two motion pictures inspired by the work of Frank Miller are so far the most memorable and entertaining films to hit theaters this year.
5680;That a big budget summer blockbuster not only delivers on the action front but comes equipped with such a well written script has to be something of a studio fluke.
5681;Hopefully a new trend in filmmaking has emerged, the smart action film.
5682;Christian Bale gives us the most believable and downright scary Batman to date.
5683;Michael Caine is eerily convincing as Alfred.
5684;Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow proves his mettle and gives rise to an overall feeling of unease regarding psychiatric professionals everywhere.
5685;Liam Neeson, although seemingly typecast in the mentor role of Henri Ducard, as always makes you believe he knows what he's talking about.
5686;Now everyone mentioned above gives at worst an admirable turn, and this ensemble cast is a director's fantasy come true.
5687;But there's one performance that's so surprisingly, unexpectedly good, I'd say it deserves the Best Supporting Actor Oscar right now.
5688;He's Batman's number one fan and also his number one ally.
5689;"Oldman plays the workingman hero, the average Joe, the family man who keeps his head down to keep his loved ones safe
5690;batman Begins is the must see movie of the summer.
5691;I'm hoping word of mouth on this cinematic masterpiece will bring it well deserved box office success.
5692;Extremely rich storytelling along with phenomenal character development should keep folks coming back.
5693;I'm doubtful there will be a better movie released this year, at least one involving superheroes.
5694;Batman Begins is the reboot of the Batman movie franchise.
5695;The film brings the decades of comics into reality, showing the famous Gotham City with a dark atmosphere, a twisted place where life thrives.
5696;Christian Bale plays Bruce Wayne in as much onscreen time as the Dark Knight himself, something previous films lacked, making the Wayne character real and emotional, showing Wayne must perform as an egotistic, selfish, spoiled rich individual to space himself from the crime fighter.
5697;alfred provides a great supporting role as more than a butler, portrayed as a close family friend, with comedic one lines.
5698;Michael Caine brings certain elegance to the role, provided great heat in whatever scene he appears.
5699;Jim Gordon, like Alfred, has an expanded role in this reboot.
5700;Cillian Murphy finally brings the Scarecrow to life, doubling as the scary villain and controlling Dr. Crane of the famous Arkham Asylum.
5701;David S. Goyer pens a good origin story, incorporating people, places and things from the comic source material while letting the audience get attached to the characters.
5702;ray shows a nice clear picture of the dark Gotham, providing clear audio for dialogue and classical set soundtrack.
5703;Extras are plentiful but basic, mainly contains features of making scenes and costumes.
5704;Unlike Batman media of the past Begins brings all the comic goodness into reality, making a smart, enjoyable movie for Batman fans and non fans alike.
5705;ray provides a great casted movie, story wise and picture wise.
5706;Batman Begins is a great vehicle for the super.
5707;stardom for which Christian Bale seems destined.
5708;Between the original Batman film and the fantastic, dark, gothic cartoon series on Fox when i was growing up, I couldn't escape looking up to the """"caped crusader""""!"""
5709;That being said, I really appreciated the first half of the film, which fleshed out in great detail, the origins and early biograpahy of Bruce Wayne, Batman's doppelganger.
5710;Unlike the films created by Tim Burton, which were very stylized and had outrageous sets, Batman Begins has a much more realistic feel.
5711;I thought Christian Bale's acting was spot.
5712;I love Chicago and really enjoyed the shots made in the city.
5713;It appears the Windy City is finally getting its due as a great filming location.
5714;batman was a fine action film.
5715;It was a competent and entertaining film within the genre it lives.
5716;I look forward to seeing the next Batman film.
5717;I love Batman but looking past that, this is a great movie that renewed faith in the franchise with Christian Bale and Michael Caine.
5718;This movie one of the Best Batman movies I have ever seen and also it was a start of a trilogy that left fans happy and wanting more!
5719;finally they get it right!
5720;Batman is above all a drama.
5721;dC realises that Batman is an intelligent comic.
5722;While certainly some of the character over the years were over the top, my generation found a Batman and his archvillians who were DANGEROUS.
5723;But this is what makes Batman interesting, in that he is an alter.
5724;By coming to gripes with people we reach an emotional attachment, an in depth analysis of how they tick.
5725;Keaton was good at what he did.
5726;my apologies because I think most here have been much more eloquent and detailed in their reviews.
5727;michael Caine is superb as Alfred, Morgan Freeman is a perfect Lucius Fox.
5728;Go see it, you'll be thunderstruck.
5729;This is by far the best Batman movie ever.
5730;And for all those people that write reviews without seeing the movie and saying that they should have let it go.
5731;And the horses breathing fire thing you will understand when you see the movie.
5732;I will admit at first I didnt want to see it but I went and loved it.
5733;I give this movie 10 stars.
5734;One of th best movies of the summer.
5735;this movie is sooo cool.
5736;i went to see it the first day it opened and it was awesome!
5737;well worth the money, it's story was real good,the actors were talented at playing their roles,and christain bale is the best batman i've ever seen!keaton was overrated in his preformance in the first batman movie,but christain bale stays on top the whole time.
5738;the villians are a lot more real and creepier too!cillian murphy did a wonderful job at portraying dr. jonathan crane/scarecrow.
5739;heh, maybe the sequel will be cool.
5740;he was a great batman, and IMO is the still the best.
5741;keaton is the best batman and im pretty confident you feel the same way.
5742;in short, i give this a three for good performances by the actors, but not my favorite bat .
5743;keaton is still my favorite and maybe in the sequel, bale will prove me otherwise.
5744;This is a great start to the movie, showed how Batman came to be instead of just jumping into fighting and bashing heads.
5745;Christian Bale and all of the other case members did a great job.
5746;*SPOILER* One thing to notice, is right after he saves Rachel from the poison, he tells her what to do with the antidote.
5747;He talks to her in his Batsuit, without his Batman Voice.
5748;the Film Boasts A Wonderful Cast.
5749;It's Like M Knight Shamalan's Signs.
5750;it's Just That This And The First Batman Movie (With Nicholson) Is Extremely Dark,Like The Latter Batman Comics.
5751;"The most entertaining and conventional movie of the ""Batman"" series, Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" seeks to create a launching pad for new slew of Caped Crusader films, and this origin story, while choppy and imperfect, sets the buffet table."
5752;"Nolan (""Insomnia"" and ""Memento"") and screenwriter David S. Goyer bring realism ."
5753;"considering it worked so well in ""Spider."
5754;"But we can still recognize it
5755;just a gorgeous shot of a man above his city.
5756;Batman Begins has an amount of restraint to it.
5757;man"""" both survived these growing pains for excellent sequels."""
5758;Oldman plays him simply as a decent, honest cop, one of the few left in Gotham, and Batman's first partner.
5759;he's shoehorned nicely into the climax.
5760;In this day and age, is a lawyer really a symbol of virtue?
5761;climactic and, since it's in the dark of night, not exactly thrilling.
5762;"overall, ""Batman Begins"" takes on a bigger assignment than its predecessors and passes, well."
5763;reality and four excellent actors .
5764;to carry it for a couple more films.
5765;This is THE Batman movie that fans have been waiting to see.
5766;It's a quest that will eventually lead him to become the masked vigilante Batman, who hides in the shadows dispelling his brand of justice.
5767;As this is the origin of Batman, there is a lot of setup, or in other words: There is a lot of story.
5768;A great supporting cast, of course, always helps and here we have Liam Neeson as Wayne's mentor Ducard, Morgan Freeman as Lucias Fox, a man who can just about invent anything, Michael Cain as trusted butler Alfred, and Cillian Murphy who absolutely steals the movie as Dr. Jonathan Crane.
5769;Props go to Christopher Nolan who has created a very believable Gotham City and a new look Batmobile which embarks on one of the best car chases ever captured on film.
5770;For everyone else, a great time to be had!!
5771;An absolutely amazing dark and gritty portrayal of the one of the best superheroes of all time.
5772;The Nolan brothers are brilliant, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy, and the impeccable Gary Oldman.
5773;Great actors combined with great writing and some of the most entertaining action sequences seen in some time.
5774;If you are fan of the genre, more power to you, and please ignore this review.
5775;This movie was bought for my son but I watched it and thought it was pretty good.
5776;Decent action and good graphics.
5777;this movie transcends its genre.
5778;Katie Holmes convincingly portrays Rachel as a young woman with great integrity and determination, and Rachel is more of a supportive, peripheral character.
5779;i also liked that this movie had some grounding in real science.
5780;In the other Batman movies, it's all magic.
5781;Morgan Freeman's character does a great job of introducing Bruce Wayne to the government's latest finds.)
5782;Bruce still clings to the ideal that justice needs to be tempered with mercy, and his mentor (Liam Neeson) cannot change Bruce's stance on the matter.
5783;I'm not a huge action hero fan, but I loved this movie nonetheless.
5784;"Bravo to Christian Bale and the cast and crew of ""Batman Begins."""
5785;But for all the turmoil in Gotham, there is one beacon of hope, though this beacon is quite dark himself.
5786;Bruce Wayne, played by the talented Christian Bale, is Batman, a hero for the people w/ his own set of problems.
5787;The special effects in this movie are incredible.
5788;Plus the batmobile just kicks a**.
5789;I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for some dark, moody entertainment.
5790;My son (age 39) loves this movie and he and his family watch it several times a year.
5791;Even though it's darker than the Tim Burton Batman movies, this is still a good watch.
5792;I have all the Batman Series of movies and am a comic book fan from way back.
5793;It goes back and gives a new look at the beginning of the man becoming the character.
5794;The cast is well developed as the story progresses and it is a joy to watch the film.
5795;The action is fast and cast is great.
5796;I will enjoy this movie over and over.
5797;I was very happy with this movie.
5798;I think Christian Bale did an outstanding job.
5799;"I really liked the way they covered the ""origin"" of Batman."
5800;and, of course, Morgan Freeman is great, and the batmobile is awesome!
5801;I think the story line flows perfectly.
5802;Overall, this is an A+ movie.
5803;I have seen it several times, and I always enjoy it!
5804;Highly recommend it, great family night.
5805;This is a brilliant recovery from the lousy parts 3 and 4 from the previous film series.
5806;Christian Bale was perfectly cast as Batman and it was a real relief not to see those silly characters Robin or Batgirl anymore.
5807;This one is fun to watch!
5808;It was a Christmas gift and came in plenty of time for gift.
5809;Although this movie was blown out of the water by the second in the trilogy, it is still an amazing movie.
5810;Christian Bale's change from The Machinist to becoming Batman was a huge jump .
5811;but it turned out to be fantastic.
5812;Perfect addition of barman movies!
5813;Bought for my nephew and he lives it!
5814;Watched it as soon as he got it and replays over and over!
5815;This was bought as a gift!
5816;my husband loves the movie and loves the clarity of the high dfinition
5817;If it is superior to this film in any way, it is the style of Tim Burton, keeping you consciously grounded in a comic.
5818;Put simply, Burton's Batman installments were fun.
5819;This film has a much larger palette (beyond the world of Gotham), based more in a semi.
5820;The heroes and villians are painted in much greyer shades, and the title character's motive of simple revenge is dispensed with early in the film for headier explorations.
5821;Batman is a very literary figure .
5822;more each time I see it.
5823;As a kid, Batman was my favorite hero in the comics and ever since, all things Batman were cool.
5824;"i was surprised by the approach the director took on Batman Begins, and I'm sure it was a very difficult execution, but superb craftsmanship and originality bring this Batman very lively unto the screen, although he's humanized and the origins of his ""powers"" are explained."
5825;The twist of the story is very interesting and my 11+ year old said that it was a cool movie and he found it a little scary at times.
5826;in this film you learn about the humanity of Batman, although we all know it's a fictional character, but it's interesting to say the least.
5827;Bottom line, it's well worth watching Batman Begins and this flick has an edge to it and it is more serious and darker than the previous takes on this comic book hero.
5828;"In the midst of a rising number of superhero/comicbook films, ""Batman Begins"" stands as a mark against which all others should be measured from here on."
5829;Batman Begins is a great movie, period.
5830;You can enjoy it if you've never seen another Batman film, or another superhero film for that matter, or even if you've never read a single issue of the comic.
5831;drawing inspiration from all of the above, the screenplay by Chris Nolan and David Goyer is tight and emotion.
5832;packed as well as filled with marvelous action pieces.
5833;Several moments during the Batman's first appearance will make you jump as if you're watching a tense thriller or horror film.
5834;And Christian Bale's performance nails the character from every angle.
5835;There a subtlties in his portrayal.
5836;"He carries off Bruce's numerous emotional states, as well as his facade as the ""millionaire playboy"" in a way that no previous actor ever has."
5837;"The highest compliment I can give him is to say his presentation of the dual character Bruce Wayne/Batman ranks on par with Christopher Reeve's rendition of Clark Kent/Superman in ""Superman, the Movie."
5838;Though Michael Caine looks nothing like the comic's portrayal of the faithful Wayne butler, he brings off the part with the perfection I've come to expect in Caine's performances.
5839;the big surprise to me was Gary Oldman.
5840;"Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy and Katie Holmes are all marvelous in their respective parts
5841;interest"""" motif that now plague the superhero film genre."""
5842;"ending kiss, something that made me voice a very relieved ""whew!"
5843;This is by far the best Batman film ever made.
5844;It may even be the best superhero film ever made.
5845;The first act is saved by the closing fight sequence between Wayne and the villain of the first half of the film, Ra's Al Ghul played by Ken Watanabe from The Last Samurai.
5846;after his exile in Tibet, Wayne finally arrives back in Gotham to start the second act.
5847;The villain of the second act is one of my favorite from the Batman mythology, the Scarecrow, second after the Penguin.
5848;in the final battle, they tie in both first and second acts well including a plot twist that I never saw coming.

5855;I got a sense of doom from him the moment he decided to become Batman, and that is the core of the character .
5856;"the REAL ""person"" is Batman."
5857;Bruce Wayne has become a mask.
5858;christopher Nolan and Dave Goyer came up with a new origin story with a mix from the comics' origins.
5859;Batman puts a crimp in his style.

5862;he joins a mysterious group called the League of Shadows, led by the really mysterious Ra'as Al Ghul, played by Ken Watanabe.
5863;Back in Gotham, Bruce comes up with a really kick.
5864;"Of course there's no shortage of that either
5865;If I must nitpick, the climactic action sequence features editing that is so fractured and rapid that it's like watching the trailer"
5866;"This is one messed up superhero
5867;The real star of the show for me, though, is Michael Caine as loyal butler Alfred, whose class, dry humor and Cockney accent let him steal every scene he's in.
5868;Morgan Freeman, who gets the most laughs but also the most respect as Wayne's tech guru proves that he could play Q in the next Bond flick, if they were smart enough to cast him.
5869;The picture is enormous but crystal clear and the surround sound is terrific"
5870;Best of all: no commercials and only one preview!
5871;True, it costs a couple of bucks more, but it's well worth it.
5872;Batman Begins is one Hollywood Blockbuster that deserves your full support, though.
5873;Batman, as a movie, has been done to death.
5874;"this franchise should go in either the direction of making a film purely from the ""Bruce Wayne"" point of view and omit any fantasy aspect or emulate Raimi's ""Spiderman"" or the first X. men since those films have very effectively captured the magic of the superhero film."
5875;It employed a fresh, contemporary attitude.
5876;Steelbox are the best packaging I have seen.
5877;This is a great new direction for Warner Bros' Batman series.
5878;Christopher Nolan's incredible direction certainly shines through on this film as we see a more human side to Batman, and we explore the difficulty of managing two lives.
5879;It was more of a gritty action film that happened to have the main character in a cape some of the time.
5880;"even with these ""flaws"" as I consider them, maybe this is why I enjoyed the film so much."
5881;It's much more believable than the past films, especially when we see Batman falter while trying to use his new gadgets or become accustomed to his new skills.
5882;Very good moving, it puts a human spin on the Batman franchise.
5883;I highly recommend anyone to see this movie.
5884;"Christopher Nolan, of ""Memento"" fame, has made arguably the best ""comic book"" film ever with ""Batman Begins."""
5885;"Taking the ""Batman"" story closer to the ""Dark Knight"" versions of our hero and eschewing the more campy elements of other interpretations, Nolan takes an all."
5886;"star cast and makes a movie that should have George Clooney, Val Kilmer, and even Michael Keaton calling their agents and screaming, ""This is the 'Batman' picture I should have made!"
5887;Christian Bale takes over the title role, and works wonders with it.
5888;"He also has to bring off the ""billionaire playboy"" public persona of Bruce Wayne."
5889;"his work as a young lad in 1987's ""Empire of the Sun"" and Kenneth Branagh's ""Henry V"" in 1989 was very impressive."
5890;star supporting cast, to say the least.
5891;Michael Caine brings the necessary dignity to Alfred the Butler, but also the necessary affection and humor.
5892;only Katie Holmes, as Wayne's love interest and young D. a. Rachel Dawes, seems a bit overwhelmed by all this star power.
5893;standing feud between Wayne and the survivors of the League (oh, yeah, Wayne single.
5894;All I'll say about that is that this plot line builds to one of the most amazing fight scenes imaginable involving Gotham City mass transit and the tank.
5895;"a visual splendour, ""Batman Begins"" is also more realistic than the more recent stylized ""Batman"" movies."
5896;It is a great entertainment, and hopefully the start of a great new line of movies about the Caped Crusader.
5897;Outstanding, the best superhero movie I can remember watching.
5898;Christian Bale was born to play this part and I hope for many sequels with him at the helm.
5899;"Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman
5900;Batman Begins is fantastic from beginning to end.
5901;The Batman portrayed here is perfect and a flawless return to what the character was originally intended to be in the comic books.
5902;Amazing movie with a great two movies following.
5903;The last movie (Dark Knight Rises) relates back to this movie a couple times so good idea to see this one first.
5904;If you loved the 1900s versions then you should watch it.
5905;I loved of how the batman begun and if you are a Huge fan of batman then this is a great movie to watch.
5906;Christopher Nolan set out to make the best Batman movie possible.
5907;He recalled looking at the success of the first Superman movie back in 1978 and decided that part of making the film work was having the right cast.
5908;Christopher Nolan more than succeeded in his aim!
5909;Snatching up some of the best actors around in Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, and even the young talents of Christian Bale and Cillian Murphy helped make this, not only the best Batman adaptation ever done but one of the best comic book adaptations of all time.
5910;He looked at various bodies of work from Frank Miller to other graphic novels as well, trying to find the best story and the best medium for making the movie.
5911;Nolan, the crew, and Bale all had a clear idea of the kind of Batman that they wanted to have portrayed.
5912;Liam Neeson is brilliant as Wayne's mentor, Ducard.
5913;And Michael Caine is wonderful as the ever reliable Alfred.
5914;one of the best performances has to go to Gary Oldman as Sergeant Jim Gordon.
5915;He looks like he was cut right out of the comic, and he does a fantastic job.
5916;morgan Freeman is also very good as Lucius Fox who helps Bruce Wayne make his preparations.
5917;Cillian Murphy turns in a very good performance as Scarecrow (best villian portrayal of any of Batman films thusfar).
5918;Katie Holmes is very credible.
5919;Batman is popular because of the power of his deductive reasoning.
5920;He is more than a fighting machine.
5921;He is able to out.
5922;Batman Begins does the best job of tapping into this.
5923;The suit is the best yet as well.
5924;Gotta love Christian Bale's """"Batman Voice."""""""
5925;And this film is as close to being perfect as it can get.
5926;bring on the Dark Knight!
5927;Terrific introduction to the Dark Knight legend.
5928;This movie and its sequel assured that Mr Chris Nolan did the best job ever with the caped crusader movies.
5929;the new concept by Nolan is powerful and critical.
5930;"When we say we had enough of super heroes movies, here comes ""Batman Begins', to change our minds ."
5931;good script, a story well known ,Very good acting by Chritian BAle .
5932;It had a great and entertaining story line, good acting, and very good visuals.
5933;Sure it took a darker approach to Batman, but it paid off and created a very exciting, edge.
5934;It does the Black Knight justice.
5935;That's when the fun starts.
5936;"Great scenes of Batman busting bad guys and driving around in his ""tumbler"" keep you entertained."
5937;There are nice twists, a great ending, and even some remotely scary scenes.
5938;Add that with well placed humor and good acting from Christian Bale, Katie Holmes, and Morgan Freeman and you have one great movie.
5939;Point is, after summer flops like Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Fantastic Four, Batman Begins is easily the best movie of Summer 2005.
5940;He grew up a rich snot.
5941;batman Begins is a modern classic with beautiful shots reminiscent of Kurosawa that George Lucas would envy.
5942;screen I was more impressed.
5943;This is a very personal film and relies a lot on old style acting.
5944;He shows emotion and nuance in his performance.
5945;The actors and actress were very good at relaying their character's inner lives with the lost art of close ups and the director's use of reaction shots.
5946;The other great thing that Bale does in this film is make Batman scary for the first time.
5947;Batman Begins feels more like a film from the 40s or 50s when movies truly mattered and is the better for it.
5948;a complex and gripping plot, discussion on good and bad, beautiful and most enjoyable film, with great description of gotham.
5949;its christian bale beating criminals to a pulp in a big bat suit.
5950;this series started off strong with Tim Burton's first film Batman with Kim Basinger as Vicky Vale,the love interest for both our hero and our villian,Jack Nicholson having a field day as the psychotic Joker,and in one of the strangest casting decisions ever that actually worked,Michael Keaton played Batman and Bruce Wayne and he played both roles brilliantly.
5951;face(Tommy Lee Jones)and the insane Riddler(played by a absolutley hilarious Jim Carrey)with the help of his new found ally,Robin(Chris O'Donnell).
5952;all this is happening while Bruce has found a new love interest in Dr. chase Meridan(Nicole Kidman).
5953;all in all,Forever was a huge hit,despite not being a favorite in the series.
5954;although I enjoy this film,many people hate it and it's okay.
5955;Batman is back in a big way in this amazing film directed by Christopher Nolan.
5956;this film gives the resons of how Bruce Waynebecame the Dark Knight.
5957;after he learns some incredible skills,he decides to return to Gotham and do something about the criminals who run the streets.
5958;this is the most intelligent and best of the series.
5959;the plot is great and has several twists and turns.
5960;the cast is great:Morgan Freeman,Michael Caine,Liam Neeson,and Tom Wilkimson are great in the roles they have been given,especially the first three I mentioned.
5961;katie Holmes does decent in her role,just don't expect anyting groundbreaking.
5962;cillian Murphy is terrific in the role of the Scarecrow and is downright scary.
5963;he is amazing in the role and he is the best Bruce Wayne,too.
5964;so,if you weren't satisfied by the first four,Begins will be the one you'll enjoy!!!!!!
5965;See this as soon as possible!The Ultimate Batman movie is here and it's Batman Begins!!!!!!
5966;Bale has to be the best actor with enough charisma to become believeable as a super hero.
5967;She was okay, not annoying but not memorable either.
5968;Too bad since the rest of the cast was great.
5969;I really enjoyed this movie.
5970;I am a huge fan of Batman and this is a great one!!
5971;I was a bit wary of this movie, but when I saw it I was blown away, I loved it, Bale was great as Batman, Nieson even better as Rah al Ghul, and Murphy looked like he was having a ball with Scarecrow, as for the story, it was perfectly done, dark, but not oppressing so, and I really liked how the story goes easily from the present to the past and back again.
5972;A rich, revenge crazed, power dresser .
5973;the story is very believable and Chris Bale covers the aspect of his tortured psyche very well.
5974;i loved the 1989 Burton version of BATMAN .
5975;And so Chris Nolan's version is now right for our time.
5976;there may be better out there, but I really do like this one and I recommend it to anyone.
5977;batman Begins tells the story of how Bruce Wayne ended up becoming the Dark Knight.
5978;We see his training, and learn what inspires him to fight for justice.
5979;Christian Bale is perfect casting, and is the best Batman to ever grace the screen.
5980;Michael Caine is a brilliant Alfred with a great sense of humor, Morgan Freeman is brilliant in his supporting role, Katie Holmes is great as Bruce's love interest, and Cillian Murphy is effectively creepy as the Scarecrow.
5981;This Batman brings everything you wanted to see to the screen, and I will be first in line for the sequel.
5982;thank you to Christopher Nolan, David S. Goyer, Christian Bale, and all the rest of the cast and crew for bringing one of my favorite superheroes to life the way he should have been from the very beginning.
5983;This one is by far the best.
5984;Very good, the best of any Batman movie in my opinion.
5985;A Batman movie worth owning, let alone watching.
5986;Now I own two Batman movies, this one, and Dark Knight (but only for the Joker) Enjoy the movies!
5987;I loved the story line beginning with Bruce's childhood and bringing him up through the development of Batman.
5988;I was really surprised by the intensity of Bale.
5989;Michael Cane is perfect as Wayne's butler, Alfred.
5990;All the others put in very good performances.
5991;Nicely done for a comic book to movie.
5992;I endorse this film whoelheartedly, in a way that I endorse few others.
5993;this film succeeds in a way that ALL of the Batman films failed, where most HOLLYWOOD films fail for that matter.
5994;"Instead of ""big stars,"" it has great actors, chief among them being Christian Bale as Batman."
5995;It's easily the best film of the year.
5996;Batman Begins was a really good film.
5997;it gave us a good look on how Bruce Wayne became Batman.
5998;i was really happy how Christian Bale played Bruce Wayne/Batman.
5999;he brought back that seriousness to the role that Michael Keaton had.
6000;this is still a great film and I highly recommend it,if you've never seen it.
6001;For once, the producers got it.
6002;The next morning, set free, Bruce Wayne embarks on a journey that will transform him into the most feared creature of the night by all criminal.
6003;A fearless fighter who became his own demon by fighting it, the Batman.
6004;But every fight and victory has its price as Bruce Wayne will learn throughout the course of the movie.
6005;christopher Nolan not only did an excellent job directing his actors (as always), but he managed to keep every aspect of the film as natural as possible, so it's no surprise when the movie ends that we feel like it might happen somewhere.
6006;His direction is precise and he knows exactly what every scene means to the characters involved.
6007;A wise choice from Warner Brothers who definitely should hire his services for an inevitable sequel that should be as good as this movie.
6008;christian Bale (Duh, the man was so born to play Batman), Liam Neeson (a nice addition to his impeccable acting skills), Morgan Freeman (the genius behind most of Batman's gadgets, nevertheless, an exquisite time with this character), Michael Caine (this man IS Alfred, no questions here), heck, even Katie Holmes is great, Where I thought she would play the Kim Basinger.
6009;Katie Holmes is definitely, after Michelle Pfeiffer, the series' best female addition ever, beating (I'm sorry people) Uma Thurman and Nicole Kidman.
6010;This ensemble shines everytime the spotlight is on them and every scene makes you want more of their characters.
6011;the design of the city, as the look and feel of the movie, is as natural and realistic as ever.
6012;A lot of work went into this project and it definitely shows as the alleys crowded with hanged clothes, close buildings and high.
6013;The locations serve the story and characters, never the opposite, which makes this movie one of the best superheroes movies ever seen.
6014;the special effects are impeccable as Batman is surrounded by digital bats, most of the city's skyscrapers are nowhere near real and the stunts are impressive.
6015;I was baffled, without a word when I saw all the details (I've seen it 5 times so far and I always see something new.
6016;top with this edition (the deluxe edition).
6017;the first rate cast includes Michael Caine (Oscar.
6018;the best film of the summer.
6019;Like a lot of others I wasn't sure if another Batman movie was necessary, with the Burton masterpieces and the Schumacher disasters still fresh in everyone's minds.
6020;This was the Batman movie that surpassed my expectations, an experience so rich and entertaining that I didn't think it could be done as live.
6021;And oh yeah, the man just happens to call himself Batman.
6022;on all around, and Christian Bale easily makes Batman/Bruce Wayne his own.
6023;The cast is fairly star.
6024;studded, and each one contributes their share without putting their ego in, for a true ensemble piece.
6025;It takes a bit of suspension of disbelief, but it's worth it for an otherwise flawless film.
6026;Early editions came with a free comic book featuring a sampling of stories the film draws influence from.
6027;the Burton films are still excellent interpretations of Batman, but Batman Begins will probably be remembered as the most authentic screen.
6028;A great film for fans, and great for converting non.
6029;"One always thought that the original ""Batman"" movie of Michael Keaton was the most descent in the series in terms of storyline and it's closeness to reality, and this Batman Begins comes to kick it off and reinvent the hero, giving him more depth, darkness and colour."
6030;the best thing about this movie is that it both invested time in showing us how the hero has evolved from the abandoned child in the alley to the masked justice warrior, and justified each and every detail of the gadgets Batman gets.
6031;All I have to say is they finally got it right!
6032;This is the real deal right here!
6033;Finally, a serious batman movie, and it actually stayed close to the story of the original comic book series.
6034;Excellent job by Christian Bale.
6035;The action, the characters, the acting, the dialouge.
6036;The talk was that this was going to be a dark and realistic movie.
6037;If you want an interesting and dark action flick, check out the Bourne series.
6038;Batman is just for little kids and comic book fans.
6039;The actors were all spectacular and the typecasting was excellent.
6040;It was a great story .
6041;very dark but true to the Batman story as told in the comic books of yesteryear.
6042;The long build up in the movie to the actual presentation of Batman was very well done and provided the groundwork for a suspenseful and exciting ending.
6043;The movie achieves a unique feat in that it retells a story in such a way that it makes the viewer feel like they are experiencing it for the first time.
6044;It's got everything a good action movie should have and more.
6045;"I've always loved the Tim Burton ""Batman"" movies but they were good for their time and this is a new Batman, for a new day."
6046;The darker ,edgier look of this movie is what I think most comic book fans want.
6047;Batman Begins is the best Batman film made to date.
6048;Christian Bale is as always excellent in the leading role and he is supported by a first.
6049;This is a marvellously well done sequence and probably the highpoint of the film.
6050;at a little over two hours, the film does remarkably well in holding your interest, and it is only in the last section of the film that it lets itself down at all.
6051;The ending was a little too blockbuster oriented for my liking and slightly out of place with the brilliance of the rest of the film.
6052;Don't let this put you off though, because overall, and taking into account the extras disc, this is well worth getting.
6053;as for the movie, this is the 2nd best superhero movie ever made.
6054;(Though that version will always hold a special place in my heart).
6055;That gives the whole film a much more realsistic and immersive experience.
6056;It's a great story, with a wonderful look at the darker side of the Batman character.
6057;And it's even better (of course) on Blu.
6058;Tim Burton's two films Batman and Batman Returns were very entertaining.
6059;the title of Batman Begins is the best description of the movie.
6060;We see exactly why Batman is Batman.
6061;What happened in his childhood, his training, how he gets all those cool devices and toys including a modern day, very realistic Batmobile.
6062;Batman returns to Gotham from his training to face his first nemesis.
6063;batman Begins is suspenseful, scary at times and well acted with terrific special effects.
6064;So Batman Begins was a delightful breath of fresh air filling the sails of what hopefully is the beginning of a new era of Batman movies.
6065;A comic is a comic and nothing but a comic.
6066;like sets and music, stunning pictures and special effects, they were colourful, lively, winking at the viewer and always a little larger.
6067;life, so that right from the beginning one knew that they were taking place in a kind of parallel world where peculiar, sometimes bizarre things can happen.
6068;"Somehow the scene fit perfectly to the film's theme ""Coward turns heroic and sallies forth to save the world."
6069;If I could I would give it 0 stars, but all right, I will still give it 1 star since some of the pictures were actually pretty well made.
6070;this one is perfect better than spider.
6071;man 2, and arguably as good as superman.
6072;Batman feels real all the way, it's more complex emotionally.
6073;I was surprisingly pleased with this movie.
6074;I loved that Gordon is a sergeant and I also liked how it is explained how Batman gets all of his equipment, instead of building everything himself.
6075;The Scarecrow character was well done and Liam Neeson was great as usual.
6076;In my opinion, the best Batman movie yet.
6077;This star playing Batman is the best!!
6078;This movie is the best of his two, so far.
6079;Christian Bale has many sides to his character, and he can play Batman because of it.
6080;HE carries a large sound effect with his voice, and Blu Ray makes it so real.
6081;I bought this one and The Dark Knight in blu ray.
6082;Finally they cast a good Batman.
6083;Christian Bale should be the only actor considered as Batman, he did a great job in this movie.
6084;This is a must for the Batman fan.
6085;christian Bale is the Best Live.
6086;excellent acting from Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Liam Neesom make this a top.
6087;Well worth the price of admission!
6088;It was well written and the special affects were high.
6089;I also enjoyed the acting and the fact that it wasn't extra corny like any of the prior Batman films.
6090;I think Bale did a excellent job as Batman along with the supporting cast.
6091;A great way to bring batman back to life.
6092;Good direction and special effects, along with good actors.
6093;I liked the first half of the movie and thought that it told a fresh story about Batman that hasn't gotten a lot of attention, but I felt the action part of the movie involving Gotham was a bit of a whirlwind.
6094;Overall a good movie, and a must watch if you want to fully appreciate what is going on in Dark Knight.
6095;As a big fan of movies I have decided only just recently to start posting reviews (look for my first on 'DETERRENCE').
6096;Batman Begins is so cooooooool.
6097;All in all a first class movie.
6098;I especially loved the martial arts training scenes, it's one of those moments where you want to do it yourself.
6099;I will start now, after years of movie collecting and following, to post reviews.
6100;Batman Begins shows how Batman `began' (hence the title .
6101;I have to admit that some scenes were confusing for this reason, but it made itself up with another incredible scene.
6102;This film is definitely worth a watch.
6103;I definately recommend the movie, but be wary of the 2 disc set.
6104;the movie really is great though, and this review is only a concern about the features disc technical errors.
6105;christopher Nolan, the man behind such films as Memento, decided to revive Batman.
6106;the movie, like many of Nolan's films, beings by jumping around a bit.
6107;As well as why Bruce Wayne becomes Batman in the first place.
6108;the movie is dark and intriguing.
6109;Put simply, this is one of the finest super hero movies ever produced.
6110;Bruce Wayne, in particular, is built up extremely well.
6111;With some other fine and believable performances by the likes of Liam Neeson and Gary Oldman, Batman Begins is fantastic.
6112;It's forgivable considering the absorbing story, and it surely won't upset too many folks in the long run.
6113;this is Batman done right.
6114;A fine movie with a fine director and an unbeatable cast.
6115;Nolan succeeds in bringing back the seriousness of the original Batman, with Christian Bale (The Machinist) donning the bat suit this time around.
6116;ridden Gotham city, reestablishing a relationship with his childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes, played by Katie Holmes, and vowing to bring back order to the city that his father help build, and in return got him killed, while in the process fight a relentless enemy known as The Scarecrow, played brilliantly by Cilian Murphy (Red Eye), with a little help from an honest detective named Jim Gordon, played by Gary Oldman (State Of Grace, JFK).
6117;Whether you agree with me or not, Batman Begins is destined to be a new beginning for yet another adventurous and exciting Batman franchise, just as long as Joel Schumacher stays away!RecommendedA
6118;I loved this movie, and glad I saw it, and I would watch it over again
6119;top moments, Batman Begins was quite an enjoyable experience.
6120;Many scenes were done well, and I enjoyed the action sequences.
6121;I'm sensitive, but it takes a special piece of cinematography to make me feel such empathy.
6122;Setting aside typical superhero movie flaws, such as mediocre background acting and goofy little lines, Batman Begins is a fun ride and I know I'll watch it more than once.
6123;Amazon delivered it promptly and in great condition.
6124;"Hope this review was helpful
6125;I really enjoyed this telling of how Bruce becomes the batman it stayed true to the origin his traveling the world learning and training.
6126;Great beginning of Nolan's trilogy.
6127;this is probably the 2nd best movie ive ever seen.
6128;with The Dark Knight being the absolute best.
6129;Better than the previous four live.
6130;this is the Batman movie we never thought we'd see.
6131;THIS is the Batman and the Batman mythos of the comic books, and while it's not dead.
6132;The heart and soul and feel of the books are here at last"
6133;all recommended and all better than the previous live.

6138;and into direct confrontation with the crimelords of Gotham and, later, more exotic adversaries, """"Batman Begins"""" is a roaring success on every level, including romantic and comedic touches that don't seem the slightest bit out of place with the intensity of the movie."""
6139;very, very rarely has such a scale of action come off this realistically.
6140;"Just go on from here, keep bringing in people on both sides of the camera as talented as those who worked on this (keep Bale, Freeman, Michael Caine, and every other performer who fits each script
6141;realistic urban jungle in which organized crime has taken over.
6142;Batman emerges as that hope in the second act of the film.
6143;His 'toys' are explained very nicely.
6144;Speaking of which, wait for the excellent sequel set.
6145;the story matches the tone of several comic book stories of the last 19 or so years, most notably the work of Frank Miller.
6146;Here we see Christian Bale as a very focused, obsessed, determined Bruce Wayne, who blossoms into the weird and scary Batman.
6147;He fleshes out the many aspects of Bruce Wayne: the playboy act, the driven kid who sees vengeance robbed from under him, and the guy who finds satisfaction in thwarting the criminal element.
6148;Michael Caine is stunning as Alfred, Morgan Freeman is a breezy pleasure as engineer genius Lucius Fox, Gary Oldman gives a note.
6149;perfect performance as Jim Gordon, and Cillian Murphy is just creepy as Crane/Scarecrow.
6150;Rounding out the cast is Liam Neeson, whose performance is more complicated, but he certainly does a commendable job.
6151;from production design to acting to script to direction, this is a great, fun film!
6152;The Batmobile gets a bizarre but cool redo"
6153;Christian Bale makes an excellent Batman, the back story about how he becomes Batman is plausible and well told, his relationships with Ducard (Liam Neeson), with Alfred (Michael Caine), and Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) are real, and his emotional torment convincingly conveyed.
6154;Some of the scenes are great .
6155;the most lust you'll see in this movie is when he sees the future Batmobile for the first time, and you'll be right there with him.
6156;Also, the director gets the iconic Dark Knight look just right.
6157;why didn't it hold up so well after a second viewing?)
6158;The dialogue is actually pretty didactic .
6159;justice v. vengeance, face your fear, etc. etc.
6160;This is the best batman movie ever, its how it should be.
6161;I thought this one was a classic, added to the first 2 films.
6162;(Michael Caine) did a great Alfred as well as the last one.
6163;(Katie Holmes) did a nice job as Bruce Waynes close friend and love interest.
6164;He played the guy like a normal person but with a twisted way that you knew he was crazy.
6165;I know they are going to do the whole series over, which is good, they better stay with the same tone and Gothic style as the original movie.
6166;As like most high schoolers today.
6167;Batman Begins is 100 times better, most of all it true to the Comic book story the way they should have made it a long time ago.
6168;The comic book verison is darker and more fast pace and enjoyable and go to show you his true Origins, how he came to to be who is he as a famous icon of all time.
6169;Go see this, trust me, its a whole new Gotham, with a new all star cast with a new set of wings !!!!
6170;writer Christopher Nolan has done two movies I admire very much: MEMENTO and INSOMNIA.
6171;With BATMAN BEGINS he works with co. writer David S. Goyer to explore Batman's roots.
6172;I went back to the movie a second time the next night and loved it.
6173;These are all flashbacks, with a strong and interesting good.
6174;Location filming for the Himalayas was done in Iceland, which has a rugged top of the world feel.
6175;Bale is a perfect Bruce Wayne/Batman, full of both anger and disillusionment.
6176;Gary Oldman is unrecognizable and magnificent as Commissioner Gordon, and Michael Caine is butler Alfred.
6177;Lucius invented the batsuit and batmobile, and controls Wayne Manor.
6178;And Tom Wilkinson (IN THE BEDROOM) is a formidable Mafia don.
6179;monorail chases, are just stunning.
6180;"And the dialogue is wonderful for them: ""He's not ON a street, he's driving on ROOFTOPS!"""
6181;"The editing, by Lee Smith, is sensational as Batman flies or drives all over the brightly lit night city and says poignant lines like ""I don't have the luxury of friends."
6182;This new BATMAN movie may be the best yet in terms of taking everything seriously, treating it as realistically as possible with the material, and being intelligent.
6183;But be patient, my friends, and you will be rewarded.
6184;"This ""reboot"" of the ""Batman"" franchise succeeds on many levels, not the least of which is having a rip."
6185;Smug/creepy Christian Bale seems an odd choice for the role of caped crusader but proves effective as a Dark Knight actually like the one I remember from the comic books.
6186;"Even if much of the story territory is familiar in ""Batman Begins,"" this version takes a refreshingly serious path and doesn't bog down under its own weight in camp or pyschobabble."
6187;"Director Christopher Nolan wisely chooses to play it straight, creating a film close in spirit to those of 25 years ago (""Blade Runner"" is rumored to be an inspiration
6188;The film's wonderfully effective, minimalist soundtrack by Hans Zimmer combines with straightforward production values and confident direction.
6189;It goes into great depth about Bruce Wayne's history with flashbacks inside of flashbacks.
6190;This is said with all possible respect due to the amazing movies done by Tim Burton.
6191;Batman Begins truly is the best of the Batman films out there.
6192;I had forgotten how wonderful and riviting the movie was.
6193;old mother, who usually leaves the room when I watch any kind of action movie, enjoyed it.
6194;Christian Bale looks the part of Bruce Wayne, and you can believe he's a spoiled millionaire, oh that's right, he's a billionaire now, who secretly believes in noblesse oblige.
6195;The dark Batman"""" appeared well before Frank Miller, and came out almost immediately after the campy TV series to help us forget the show."""
6196;Now this is how to do a superhero origins story.
6197;Marvellous storytelling, a great ensemble cast.
6198;Batman Begins is a great movie and story!
6199;Christian Bale did a superb job playing the role.
6200;Loved the supporting cast and the music was perfect!
6201;This is still one of the best movies I have ever seen!
6202;Great movie composed of an amazing story and good acting.
6203;Batman Begins is one of the best Batman movies up to its release and is followed by an equally enjoyable film, Dark Knight.
6204;Everyone else has already discussed the storyline, its relevance to the comic book and comments on acting.
6205;The color grading is rather cool with a slight bluish tinge.
6206;There is plenty of discreet channeling throughout the film which I look for and love to hear.
6207;The dialogue is easy to discern and all the volume levels are spot on so you won't have to roller coaster your remote's volume control, so I have no complaints in that area.
6208;Obviously, a classic already with the acting and storyline.
6209;I hate to admit this, but Batman Begins has just replaced Superman the Movie as the greatest comic book movie of all time.
6210;Superman set the bar for storytelling and special effects in movies.
6211;It is it's own start to a series of it's own.
6212;the story is compelling from the start.
6213;Bruce Wayne tourtured self is found in a Chinese prison camp, shutting himself in with criminals to fight them.
6214;And the action is top notch.
6215;I would recommend this movie to everyone I know.
6216;"After the Batman franchise started to become as fermented and corrupt as Gotham itself, devolving into silliness and big men in small tights (think Arnold Schwarzenneger's Mr. Freeze), and with comic book movies in general becoming ever more formulaic and predictable in the quest of the almighty mass market buck, it was refreshing to see Hollywood and Warner Bros. wipe away the old franchise and start anew, handing it to an auteur director, Christopher Nolan
6217;I want to particularly laud the script, which involves an intricate and deep plot that weaves delightful circles and surprises that I won't give away here.
6218;which at the time was probably the best of the genre despite its formula.
6219;Which is far more believable and definitely more satisfying.
6220;And I also wanted to say a kind word about Katie Holmes.
6221;She comes across as sweet, sharp and brave .
6222;The key is what Bruce Wayne is told by the mob boss, """"you always fear what you don't understand."""""""
6223;And the wait was definitely worth it.
6224;Nolan's film is, simply put, the best in the series.
6225;"man"" films) or too strong, but somewhere in between, and perfectly."
6226;"The great supporting cast, fantastic action sequences and dark tone converge to create the best superhero film since the original ""Superman."""
6227;disc Deluxe Edition comes with amazing extras and a fascinating 72.
6228;page comic book with three stories that inspired the movie.
6229;Audio sounds amazing in 7.1.
6230;Michael Caine is terrific as Alfred, young Bruce's loyal butler turned guardian/friend.
6231;the plot flows well, the visuals and sound effects are first rate and there are few dead spots.
6232;i'm sure you have heard about how great this movie is, so I won't spend much time on that.
6233;It is by far the best of the Batman franchise.
6234;There are several scenes that are just jaw.
6235;dropping, including my favorite scene in Gotham near the end (no spoilers here).
6236;A couple of adjustments, and presto!
6237;In Christopher Nolan's capable hands, the Batman franchise finally gets the formula right: drop the camp and embrace the darkness.
6238;is the theme here, and the Nolan/Goyer script is all the more interesting for it.
6239;They also recognise the imperative of telling a good story, offering us a well.
6240;Christian Bale is perfectly cast as the Dark Knight.
6241;He's fresh enough for most viewers to accept him as not just another Hollywood star in a rubber suit, and talented enough to pull off what ends up being a pretty complex character: both terrified and terrifying, sometimes simultaneously.
6242;He's impressive enough to be a credible superhero, yet fallible enough to be endearing.
6243;name supporting cast are excellent, with the exception of the relentlessly banal Katie Holmes who plays Gotham's fearless, mob.
6244;It all comes together here: a great script, engaging characters, wonderful production design, neatly deployed music (which right from the outset cleverly makes potentially tedious expository scenes feel like part of larger sequences), gorgeous cinematography, imaginative but never overpowering use of CGI, and perfect pacing.
6245;it's those wonderfully tortured characters, their desolate urban milieu, and the way it all grips your dark imagination.
6246;Nolan knows that, and he really nails it here.
6247;aside from that, my personal view on this movie is that it is an excellent re.
6248;"Tim Burton's ""Batman"" was great for it's day and was just what us geeks were waiting for."
6249;Keaton and Nicholson were fantastic in their roles of Batman and Joker, respectively.
6250;It would be great to see, possibly, Mark Hamill in this role since he voiced the animated Joker so well.
6251;i usually tire of origin stories, but this one was outstanding.
6252;I was drawn into the story and understood in a more vibrant way than ever before of why Bruce became the Batman.
6253;"His emergence of the hero we all know and love was great to see
6254;Morgan Freeman was excellent and should have had more screen time.
6255;Gary Oldman portrayed Gordon in a very honest and caring way that made me appreciate him as an actor and Gordon as a character.
6256;Michael Caine, of course, was absolutely fabulous and embraced Alfred as his own.
6257;But one done very well with an excellent storyline and great actors.
6258;my wife, who normally doesn't care for superhero/action type films, really liked this movie.
6259;very good story but it is hard to understand , so my family agree to watch all bat man movies .
6260;When i went to see this film, i was filled with both hope and fear.
6261;I hoped Nolan would make a return to the dark and gritty world that Burton had made in the first two movie, and i feared he had done a """"Shumacher"""" on the world."""
6262;batman is such an intriguing character.
6263;So that is the platform that allows Burton and now Nolan to create a more mature storyline, it does not need to be colourful and bright.
6264;It is a storyline that is believable to adults.
6265;"friendly"" version, without all the darkness and with the colour, and Jim Carrey."
6266;The darkness and realism that sets it apart from all the other superhero films.
6267;The blue ray format does a great job of making you notice things of movie shot with the really dark sequences the dark Knight is a great example.
6268;You notice things that you didn't notice, and for some reason it makes you pay attention to all the vibrant colors.
6269;I highly recommend any movie in Blu.
6270;Don't get me wrong, the action was there, and was terrific, but it made sense with the story.
6271;Chris Nolan and the others responsible for the film obviously had done their homework.
6272;Taking the best from Batman comics (more than just the look.
6273;but the story) and making one MOTHER of a great movie out of them.
6274;"(Most notably they borrowed a great deal from Frank Miller's ""Batman Year One"" which is one of the greatest Batman comics I've ever read.)"
6275;"After Joel ""I'm of the opinion that more florescent lights and awful casting will make Batman movies better"" Schumacher, Chris Nolan has actually renewed my faith that Batman films could be good again so much that I eagerly anticipate their sequels."
6276;This film is so good that even my wife, who is not a comic or Batman fan, likes it very much.
6277;Great story, great characters, great action, great look and feel, and great casting and acting.
6278;Christian Bale is by far the best actor to play Batman.
6279;A completely believable telling of how Bruce Wayne came to be Batman.
6280;Christopher Nolan is a wonderful director who chooses, whenever possible, filming the actual effects instead of leaving it up to a special effects studio.
6281;A great movie and almost as good as The Dark Knight.
6282;Batman Begins is about the idea that justice triumphs over vengeance.
6283;It is the second best of Chris Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy (behind The Dark Knight and ahead of The Dark Knight Rises).
6284;And you can see why with the story chart.
6285;This is augmented with a love story between Bruce and Rachel and an internal struggle of Bruce to seek revenge or justice.
6286;For a more interesting take on this idea, you will have to see the next in the trilogy, the epic Dark Knight.
6287;My son was ecstatic over this gift and I'm very pleased with the price.
6288;I must say out of the entire series of Batman movies, this one is the best.
6289;It makes the most sense.
6290;I loved the way it followed to life of Bruce Wayne in terms of how he actually becomes Batman.
6291;It shows Batman as the dark character he is, without, compromising his compassion.
6292;This is a must see.
6293;I've never seen Batman Begins till last night and I think it is a good movie.
6294;My husband and I enjoyed it from the beginning till the end.
6295;If you have seen this movie, you already know that it is fantastic.
6296;The surround sound is one that must be experienced to believe, as well as all the other features.
6297;Classic Batman adventure that delivers with style.
6298;We enjoyed it even when we were home sick.
6299;Christopher Nolan has done a great job in re.
6300;inventing Batman with an origin story with David Goyer.
6301;Michael Caine as the Alfred the trusted butler is the best and only father figure for Bruce Wayne.
6302;But when he is on the screen the scary voice takes control.
6303;With a good ending setting up for the upcoming sequel is very interesting.
6304;overall, This year's best Superhero movie ever.
6305;This was an excellent, must see movie for all you Dark Knight fans.
6306;Now this is the way to do superhero movies!
6307;Nolan's entire trilogy is a masterpiece.
6308;ray makes it that much more pleasurable.
6309;a feast for the senses.
6310;Batman Begins the best pre.
6311;quel and Batman movie I have ever seen including Burton's original.
6312;Bale is the perfect Batman, dark and mysterious Michael Caine the perfect butler humorous in his care taking.
6313;Other roles well cast as well, Katie Holmes is convincing and sexy and did I say, Christian Bale is gorgeous!
6314;I give it credit because it got non.
6315;well they had their ups and downs.
6316;burst of comic book films post 1999 we see the full grand scale cinematic appearences of all the Marvel Comic Book Heroes.
6317;Again, lot of ups and downs!
6318;The X. men Series leaves a good concrete impression as does the Blade Series.
6319;man 2 make their mark in a sugary diabetic sort of way but still leave the viewer a very satisfied customer.
6320;Daredevil (highly underated) stays true it self beginning to end.
6321;Hulk, decent special effects and style The Punisher, Elektra etc etc.
6322;Christian Bale makes the finest Batman ever, One of the only superhero actors to play his alter ego with the same amount of enthusiasm as he does the title role.
6323;This Movie is altogether about Christian Bale as Batman and the rest of the cast (superbly played) blends into the scenes with him (The Main Character).
6324;According to me, this in the only comic film that accomplishes that.
6325;"A Superior Story (David ""The Dude"" Goyer), a Brilliant Cast and an extremely talented Director Nolan make this the most memorable superhero movie ever and one of the greatest contributions in 2005."
6326;My son is a Batman fan.
6327;This movie was slow a the beginning, but quickly moved along in the middle.
6328;Christian Bale was a great choice for Batman
6329;Great movie, great way to show how Batman became Batman.
6330;Christopher Nolan is an awesome director.
6331;His trilogy is just spectacular.
6332;Wish the extra had included out takes.
6333;"Ok well I was bored so after all my exams were finished I went with a friend of mine to go and see ""Batman Begins"" I thought it would be just an okay movie but it turned out to be an absolutely extrodinary film that I have seen in years."
6334;"The acting was very good Christian Bale showed his best performance as the Caped Hero it was better than his acting in ""American Psycho"" he showed a GREAT performance but the one that did really good was Katie Holmes although her role was not that major(she was casted 4th on the credit list) she showed a great performance as a district attorney named Rachel Dawes who is the childhood friend of bruce wayne."
6335;She dumps him in the end.
6336;This is one of the best movies I have seen in a loooooong time.
6337;I have always been impressed with Bale and thought he was/is a WONDERFUL actor and the role of Batman suits him perfectly.
6338;Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Gary Oldman are all great in this film as well.
6339;I thoroughly enjoyed Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow and think he would make a great villian to come back in the future.
6340;one of the best things about this movie is the focus is on Bruce Wayne and his history.
6341;Christopher Nolan and David Goyer did a wonderful job in showing the various, darker sides of Bruce Wayne.
6342;i recommend this film to everyone.
6343;packed as movies of this sort tend to be.
6344;With that said, the action that is in the film is exciting and done very well.
6345;Batman Begins is done the way these movies should have been done all along.
6346;ray versions as the upconversion displays them well enough.
6347;ray, I was confident that the 12.00 was worth it.
6348;It was a wise decision for Warner Bros. to pretend those four movies never happened.
6349;"the result is Christopher Nolan's wonderful ""Batman Begins"", which explains Bruce Wayne's childhood, his quest for answers, his training to become a crime fighter, and his discovery of the tools that would make him into Batman in perfect detail."
6350;Instead of being gothic, the film is now a gritty, stylish noire, complete with sneering mob boss and corrupt cops.
6351;Christian Bale is the best actor to step into the role of Batman so far.
6352;Katie Holmes, like Kim Bassinger, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Nicole Kidman before her, is talented and absolutely stunning.
6353;It helps that Murphy auditioned for Bruce Wayne.
6354;He's perfect as the hero's doppelganger, ranging from charming to oily to completely deranged.
6355;As a result, Bruce's motivation to become Batman takes longer to explain than absolutely necessary.
6356;"those minor quibbles aside, ""Batman Begins"" is the most human, and most entertaining, Batman movie so far."
6357;The acting, directing, special effects, etc. all around amazing.
6358;It is a great way to start the trilogy.
6359;Really surprised that I liked this movie so much, even in spite of seeing all the rest.
6360;i loved the movie and thought it gave great insight into the story behind the man.
6361;ray for our collection and we were very happy to receive it so quickly!
6362;NOT fun like the other Batman movies!!!!!
6363;Blue Ray is definitely worth it to complete you collection.
6364;She saw Batman Begins when it first came out.
6365;ray (awesome visuals), watch Dark Knight first, and then Batman Begins.
6366;Would highly recommend it for anyone who is a fan of Batman.
6367;this movie is by far the best Batman I have ever seen.
6368;Christian Bale gives an incredible performance.
6369;so but she was better in this movie than most others I have seen here in.
6370;I am so glad I finally watched this movie and hopefully you do too.
6371;Batman begins is by far one of the greatest Batman installments of all time.
6372;It puts a much more realistic face on Batman, where he came from, how he could realistically be Batman, etc.
6373;Katie Holmes delivers a solid performance and helps to make this film great.
6374;I'd recommend it top to bottom.
6375;one other word to describe it, Awesome.
6376;Bought this for my son(20 yrs old) as a gift and he loves it.
6377;I found the earlier Batman films, despite their all.
6378;This was the finest of all the Batman films .
6379;It was good enough for this non.
6380;The product always looks brand new.
6381;I think we're in for good things with the new Batman movies.
6382;Batman Begins is epic in scope and feel.
6383;I remember as the movie ramped up to an excellent climax, sitting there and seeing everything that was happening and I wondered, THIS is the BEGINNING?
6384;It was so well executed that it felt like the end of an epic series, rather than the beginning.
6385;His growling at enemies, while masking his voice true, really takes away from the drama and tension of the scenes.
6386;the villains are great as well.
6387;Cillian Murphy (from 28 Days Later) is my favorite as the Scarecrow.
6388;Talk about gritty and pretty frightening.
6389;Tom Wilkinson as a mobster also was really well done.
6390;All I can say is that this is the best version of Batman released yet.
6391;It even towers above the Tim Burton Batmans that I loved back in the 90s.
6392;It's a great new start, and Christopher Nolan isn't shying away.
6393;A very gutsy move indeed for the next villain.
6394;Great film, great time, I doubly recommend it.
6395;The summer movie season has finally begun.
6396;Excellent film and the Blu Ray has some very cool extras .
6397;Truly a visionary film from Christopher Nolan who reset the super hero bar to sky high with this new origin tale for Bruce Wayne/Batman.
6398;Morgan Freeman pretty much recycles the same role he's played a million times.
6399;Give a message to Hollywood that you want something original and creative instead of the same old Hollywood schlock.
6400;"I have always been a fan of superhero movies, and ""Batman Begins"" is one of them."
6401;disc edition provides the viewer with a spectacular featured film, and also an enriching documentary concerning how the movie was made.
6402;I highly recommend this product.
6403;christian Bale is Batman/Bruce Wayne.
6404;This is the first film of the series where the hero is the focus resulting in a much more compelling and more focused storyline.
6405;There were two themes present in this movie: 1) Fear and 2)Relationships.
6406;This weapon, the most important in The Batman's arsenal, is used skillfully in this film, showing us, from the perspective of the criminals, what it's like to be hunted by The Batman.
6407;Batman Begins has more emphasis on strong relationships than any of its recent contemporaries.
6408;i especially loved the relationships between Bruce and the supporting cast:Bruce and Alfred .
6409;Michael Caine is the best Alfred.
6410;Loved the intial mistrust, turning into mutual respect.
6411;Lt. Gordon is one good cop in a sea of corruption in the Gotham Police Force.
6412;Addresses the question of how and where Batman gets his gadgets (especially the very cool Batmobile).
6413;Loyalty and trust are very important in this relationship.
6414;"As mentioned in a previous review, Fox is like James Bond's ""Q""."
6415;She was certainly the most resourceful and down.
6416;great action sequences, excellent acting and a compelling back.
6417;basics story make this the ultimate Batman film.
6418;the best super hero franchise out there is the new Batman franchise, hands down.
6419;Batman Begins is the best super hero flick ever.
6420;"Now ""Begins"" is #2 because ""DK"" is the new #1."
6421;It's what I do that makes the difference.
6422;"Batman consoles Rachel Dawes, as Gotham City's legacy of corruption ends and ""Batman Begins""""Batman Begins"" is the best ""Batman"" film, to date and is also one of the best films of 2005."
6423;Christopher Nolan takes the source material and does something Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher could never do.
6424;"delivering a worthwhile ""Batman"" you actually care about."
6425;Ducard offers Bruce a chance to learn what he has been looking for.
6426;Bruce accepts his offer and meets Ducard's master, Ras Al Ghul, a sorcerer and extensive master in many martial and mental arts, who has trained Ducard in his ways.
6427;But, everything comes with a price and Bruce finds out the true meaning of his training.
6428;Bruce makes his choice and dedicates his life to saving Gotham City.
6429;justice has a new face and for the filth and scum of Gotham City, fear has a new name in the form of., Batman.
6430;Forces that have a link to Batman and Bruce Wayne's past.
6431;"After the horrendous Batman and Robin"", I thought this was the end for the ""Batman"" films."
6432;I thought you'd given up on me.
6433;"Christopher Nolan agreed to direct the film, after being influenced by the Batman"" comic serial ""The Long Halloween"" (starting in 2000 ""The Long Halloween"" spanned over a year and is considered to be one of the best ""Batman"" stories of the new millenium)."
6434;With great respect towards the DC comic and it's long running legacy, Nolan began searching for the new Batman.
6435;he found Batman in the form of Christian Bale.
6436;"Bale's resume includes the cult film ""American Psycho"", as well as ""Reign of Fire"" and ""The Machinist""."
6437;Out of the four actor's who have portrayed the character, for me, Bale is the best Batman (Keaton comes in second, Kilmer third, and Clooney gets the consolation gift).
6438;He brings a certain physicality to the role that was somehow missing in the past.
6439;the rest of the cast is terrific.
6440;Michael Caine gracefully takes over for the great Michael Gough as the butler, Alfred, bringing warmth and charm to the fatherly figure that Bruce needs.
6441;katie Holmes is perfect as Rachel Dawes, instead of being the usual Bat.
6442;dame, she gives the role smarts.
6443;From the feathered back graying hair, the bushy moustache, and the classic glasses and weather beaten trenchcoat Gordan jumped out of the comic book and right onto the screen.
6444;Oldman's performance is that good.
6445;Very good movie second one is better.
6446;man's resolution for its' love story.
6447;(I suspect that Nolan was a huge fan of MTV while growing up.)
6448;Big 'over the top' endings.
6449;A big 'over the top' ending,and that is the last thing you should have for when Batman is just beginning!
6450;Nolan took this hero franchise and grounded it with real world rules.
6451;His interpretation of Batman avoids comic book trappings in favor of a kinetic pace that drives a story of revenge and justice.
6452;although some flaws exist in the film, this is the entry point to one of the best super hero movie franchises in film history.
6453;Great cast (Christain Bale, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, and Cillian Murphy to name a few), and as always great toys (The tumbler).
6454;Batman is back in a gritty reboot that gets the job done right.
6455;Batman Begins is directed by Christopher Nolan.
6456;Jack Nicholson steals the first movie.
6457;so not a very high bar to jump.
6458;but, happily, BATMAN BEGINS arrives and it's easily the best Batman movie ever made.
6459;I loved how he appears from the dark in the Bat's early scenes and literally snarls at everyone he speaks to.
6460;the rest of the cast is incredible: Michael Caine as Alfred the Butler and Gary Oldman as Sgt. then.
6461;paced and well written, interesting.
6462;this is the best Batman movie ever made, and I can't wait for the next one!
6463;Much better than the previous Batman films.
6464;Bale is the most convincing Batman.
6465;Director Chris Nolan takes this genre into a new direction.
6466;Batman Begins is full of batman's roots and the path that lead him to the cape and cowl.
6467;There is high caliber acting and a philosophy that everything should be possible despite it not being very probably.
6468;christian Bale (batman) is spot on as a believable gritty force that literally puts fear into criminals.
6469;Michael Cain plays Alfred to the tee as an enduring figure of wisdom and strength for Batman.
6470;All the other actors' deliver honorable to exceptional performances except for Katie Holmes who is flat from start to finish.
6471;The writing is thoughtful and full of laughs.
6472;extra Features: This holds a lot of cool extras from Bale transformation physically to his fighting choreography plus much more.
6473;Batman Begins two disc is definitely worth the extra money for the special features.
6474;They hit a home run here with Nolan, as he tells the origin story of Batman in this spectacular movie, Batman Begins.
6475;This is a great movie.
6476;Nolan takes the Batman legend into a realistic atmosphere to the point where it is actually believable that someone in the real world can probably be Batman.
6477;that is the kind of director he is.
6478;he is an intense actor whose on a roll.
6479;outrageousness is one form(burton)realism is another.
6480;I absolutely loved the characterization of such Batman villains such as Ras al Ghul and Scarecrow.
6481;Unlike the Spiderman movie's happy happy joy joy feel with unrealistic happy outcomes to every event, Batman Begins has plot twists, deception, and is a more realistic movie in general.
6482;I'd have to say that the movie started out pretty quickly and for a second I thought they made Bruce Wayne an Asian man.
6483;"This movie is probably for teens and adults versus younger kids, just because their is some ""intense and scary"" parts."
6484;"I'd have to say this is perhaps one of the best ""hero movies"" and I highly recommend it."
6485;This movie is an awesome prequel to the Batman story and the best Batman movie made to date (including The Dark Knight).
6486;ray looks fantastic and the movie does not get old.
6487;Anway a star studded cast and possible one of the best evil plots ever to be put on screen gives this wild ride a perfect score.
6488;In fact that is one of the reasons why Batman Begins actually works rather than watching Danny Devito rise up out of a crater in the floor.
6489;[The movie does a great scenery shoot of snowy mountains and rugged terrain and the music is just excellently placed in the right tone with it.]
6490;She starts to realize that some thing big is starting to happen to Gotham.
6491;a lot of flashy camera work and dramatic music really help this Batman movie to really shine on its own.
6492;As puzzle clues start to come together the plot just gets that much more captivating.
6493;I might also add that Michale Caine does a wonderful job as Wayne's always reliable butler.
6494;A great supporting actor if I ever did see one.
6495;A tremendous improvement (how could it be worse than Jim Carry stealing the scenes or George in a nippled Batsuit?)
6496;over the last two and even grabs some ground from the gothic creations of Tim Burton, the original Batman and Batman Returns.
6497;this story, like everyone knows, tells how Bruce Wayne went from the orphened son of a multi.
6498;"martial artsy"", I thought there was no better place to begin."
6499;moving along, Bruce returns to Gotham, transformed from a Corescant.
6500;like wonder of dazzling heights and glimmer into a dark, Blade Runner.
6501;In Gotham, we get the beginnings of Batman from Lucius Fox, a former board member of Wayne Enterprises played by Morgan Freeman, and the butler Alfred, played by the wonderfully English Michael Caine.
6502;speaking of fear, this movie uses psychological fear to a greater extent than any superhero movie, actually more than most movies, I've ever seen.
6503;The cast is excellent (never seen one better for superhero films), the dialogue is witty (unlike the final Star Wars movie), and the plot is a great start to the Batman canon.
6504;Great start for Nolan's film.
6505;Therefore, I approached this movie with an open mind: looking for stylishly presented entertainment.
6506;inducing substance part of the story resulted in some great scary effects, Mr. Cruise's girlfriend has a lovely face, and the Batmobile was cool.
6507;The movie pays significant homage to the first Batman movie, which is a positive.
6508;"man"" and ""X. men"" franchises), return to the silver screen with the definitive caped crusader adventure, ""Batman Begins."""
6509;Bruce agrees, and is soon tutored in the ways of stealth, honor, and justice.
6510;stopping toys with the help of a tech genius (Morgan Freeman) and Bruce's trusty butler, Alfred (Michael Caine).
6511;"written by David Goyer (the ""Blade"" trilogy), ""Batman Begins"" is a confident origin story that starts this new franchise at ground zero."
6512;like adventure to provide big.
6513;"Begins returns Batman to his dark, comic book origins, trusting the audience to be patient while cautious director Christopher Nolan (""Memento,"" ""Insomnia"") painstakingly builds and arranges this shadowy cinematic world from scratch."
6514;Goodness, it takes a full hour before the film even hands the audience some actual Dark Knight action.
6515;The film may not reflect reality, but Goyer and Nolan do a terrific job capturing verisimilitude for Bruce and his bat world.
6516;Begins isn't even close to the light fare that Schumacher brought the series in back in the mid.1990s, which was layered with camp and one.
6517;Nolan's film is more fierce and demonstrative in brood, which gives the film oodles of gravitas and energy, helped along significantly by the propulsive score from Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, which oddly eschews traditional heroic themes.
6518;"star cast of grand acting talents, ""Begins"" gives every actor plenty to work with, and the fun is written across their faces."
6519;"The supporting cast works dutifully fleshing out the ""Batman"" experience, but the center of attention is Christian Bale, and he deserves heaps of credit for making ""Begins"" come together as expertly as it does."
6520;It's wonderful work here from Bale, who gives Batman authority without winking and the outfit realism without much assistance from special effects.
6521;roaring, exceptional entry (or newfound expansion) of the DC comic fame and one of the better action films in recent memory.
6522;A must have to all batman fans who loved this new trilogy.
6523;I was so amazed by it.
6524;Bale did a wonderful job as both Bruce Wayne and Batman.
6525;every one really put everything they had into their given role.
6526;I loved the fact that we got to watch Jim Gordon as he rose through the ranks over the course of the movie.
6527;Micheal Cain had some funny lines and all the flashbacks with young Bruce and his father really tugs hard on your heart strings!
6528;Another than that I high recomend this movie to every one!
6529;with 'Batman Begins', a grimmer, better realized ( and recognizable ) world is presented to viewers pulling the production a bit right of the more fantastical comic book portrayals of Gotham and its' denizens, criminal or otherwise.
6530;I didn't expect much, so I was really surprised and pleased to see that this is actually a movie and not an exercise in foolishness.
6531;first of all, the character of Batman is really well developed.
6532;If you're looking for a good Batman movie, this is the best one yet.
6533;He tells Wayne about a mysterious group of men he works with, who train to rid the world of evil.
6534;Alfred (Michael Caine) welcomes Wayne back to his ancestral home, Wayne Manor.
6535;"i am a big fan of the Tim Burton ""Batman"" films, especially the first one."
6536;"But Christopher Nolan (""Memento"", ""Insomnia"") has created a whole new vision of the character."
6537;I never really read a lot of superhero comic books as a kid.
6538;"In ""Batman Begins"", Nolan creates a detailed, interesting, exciting film about the origins of Bruce Wayne and his superhero alter ego."
6539;fitting a lot of information into the film, Nolan moves things along at a breakneck pace.
6540;A lot is going on, but it is easy to follow as well because the director uses words, actions, visual references and more to inform us.
6541;But how many are successful?
6542;This is a tribute solely to the writer and director.
6543;The training includes a terrific sequence in which Wayne has to find a particular man, standing amongst identically dressed warriors, as the men move in unison, before fighting him.
6544;"This is one of the best things about the film
6545;This is a film for young (well, not too young) and old alike.
6546;there is also a significant amount of humor peppered throughout the film.
6547;Wayne's relationships with Alfred (Caine) and Lucius (Freeman) create a lot of the humor, and warmth for that matter, in his life.
6548;Therefore, he arrives at a party, in a flashy car, with two models sitting in the passenger seat.
6549;And this works brilliantly, providing him with a sense of history, reason and grounding.
6550;the look of the film is also fantastic.
6551;Using real sets, for the most part, the action has a sense of urgency and place.
6552;When you see it, you will understand why this is so important.
6553;All of this work helps to create the world these characters live in, making everything more believable.
6554;Because we believe Gotham really exists, the action, the danger and the story all are more believable.
6555;christian Bale is a really good actor.
6556;One thing that can be said of all of his performances is that they are interesting.
6557;As Bruce Wayne, Bale brings a solemn air, an intensity that works.
6558;Wayne has some dark moments in his past and his upbringing and Bale is the right choice for this part.
6559;When we experience a flashback of a traumatic event in his childhood, it is a very moving moment, because it brings us closer to Bale's portrayal of Wayne.
6560;let's face it, the supporting cast is fantastic.
6561;And """"Begins"""" is great, in large part due to the superb work of these actors, Cillian Murphy and even the future Mrs. Tom Cruise."""
6562;The key to the success of all is that they are all playing the roles seriously.
6563;Yes, some of them have slightly humorous moments, but overall, they believe in these characters, their world, their actions.
6564;This, for me, was the most exciting casting choice in the film.
6565;It is such perfect casting.
6566;In the role, Caine brings a layer of depth and conviction to the character we haven't seen before.
6567;This is a nice touch to the character and adds a certain amount of gravitas to the role.
6568;cillian Murphy is also great as Dr. Jonathan Crane.
6569;Completely believable, he brings a real sense of menace, creating a memorable villain whose plan is very diabolical and multifaceted.
6570;Again, Nolan keeps what could be a complicated idea understandable, by revealing various aspects throughout the story.
6571;Murphy is also completely convincing as an American psychiatrist, even though he is Irish.
6572;Murphy has created a small handful of very good performances and appears to be poised to continue this streak.
6573;the story, as mentioned before, is very detailed.
6574;They are developed well throughout and add a nice layer, creating additional suspense and intrigue.
6575;The hero and the tone throughout are dark, but broken up by some great action scenes and light hearted humor.
6576;For kids over a certain age, and adults, this just helps the film become that much more.
6577;there are some terrific action sequences throughout the film.
6578;This is a unique idea.
6579;"In ""Begins"", a lot of the action is suggested to us, leaving our minds to sort out the actual details."
6580;This idea works really well.
6581;the film also has one of the coolest beginnings I have seen in a long time.
6582;Batman Begins was made because Warner Bros. wanted to reenergize the franchise.
6583;And Nolan has done that.
6584;bring on the sequels, Mr. Nolan.
6585;Still not as good as the first Batman and I think I liked even Batman Forever more than this one.
6586;What made Spiderman and X. men work was that it honored the core elements of the comic.
6587;face and the Riddler were, but a good mix of gritty realism and comic appeal (i. e. Jack Nicholson, Devito and Phiffer) would have helped.
6588;All great superhero movies from Superman's I and II, to X. men to Spiderman all have great superhero music.
6589;I loved the gritty Elfman theme and the Batman Forever theme worked too, even if the rest of the movie was a bit over the top.
6590;liked the fact that it was grittier than the last two films and had good narrative, I think it tried too hard not to be 'Batman and Robin.'
6591;Michael Keaton did a great job with the first two and there was no need to totally separate it from the previous franchise, which was actually really good except for the last one.
6592;After the first two movies, Burton and Keaton had the good sense to move on before the inevitable: WB going sequel crazy.
6593;light world of flourescent paint and was immensely heavy handed in constantly tilting the camera back and forth.
6594;Seldom was there a nice, level camera scene.
6595;By default you also get to see Jim Gordon's journey from an actual uncorrupt cop, helpless to do anything about a system that was essentially owned on all levels by crime.
6596;michael Caine and Morgan Freeman perfectly round out both Bruce Wayne and Batman's inner circle of supporters.
6597;Caine perfectly played both the paternal role as well as the keeper of the Wayne family's legacy and honor.
6598;"You will find yourself saying, ""Nevah,"" with utter conviction in your own life."
6599;Freeman's character is brilliant, hidden in the bowels of the Wayne building with scientific and just plain cool items that would be wonderful to make use of in Iraq right now.
6600;Katie Holmes did a good enough, albeit annoyingly self.
6601;i'd actually give the movie 4 1/2 stars for the above reasons, as well as a few logistical issues.
6602;All in all the movie is brilliant in its story, the acting, and the return to classic scenes of the stoic Batman perched like a gargoyle on various older buildings, watching silently over Gotham.
6603;this is a great movie im 13 yes my birday was yesterday to thums up way up
6604;One thing movie makers are starting to learn is that you can start a series anywhere in the timeline of the story, and then go back and fill it in.
6605;Now it is priven fact, and a true monument to his genius and creativity.
6606;This film is another example, and with a cast to match!I loved the casting of this movie.
6607;the plot is wonderfully written, and is a trbute to the writers, producers, and directors, who put in the time to make it a spectacular story that will be watched and enjoyed over and over, which makes it a wonderful value in the world of movies.
6608;a great film for any collection.
6609;handedly demolishes the 80's and 90's Batman movies by re.
6610;imagining The Dark Knight from the ground.
6611;He assembled a first rate cast, with every member at a perfect pitch.
6612;Christian Bale is spot on as the troubled billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne.
6613;"Michael Keaton was terrific in his fashion, while I was always of the opinion that Val Kilmer was the smoothest of the bunch and George Clooney could have been perfect had he not been saddled with the horrific script dumped off as ""Batman And Robin."
6614;More to the point is that the supporting cast also carries through on their characters.
6615;There's enough light moments in the script to match the darkness, and Morgan Freeman's inventions make for good action.
6616;With three stories to choose from, it is a load of fun.
6617;It made the extra bucks (and the five star rating) worth adding on.
6618;Although this theme can never be realistic, this one gets much closer.
6619;This was the best story line of any of the previous batman movies and I think better than the The Dark Night as well.
6620;However in Batman Begins, Director Christopher builds the story slowly.
6621;Credit Christopher Nolan for taking Batman and Bruce Wayne serious.
6622;Wayne is tutored under than hand of Ra's Ah Ghul a mysterious figure from comic lore, who trains ninjas to carry out their own brand of justice.
6623;Wayne is reunited with loyal butler Alfred played magnificently by Michael Caine.
6624;"He's kind of like Batman's ""Q"", and provides some much needed detail and backstory."
6625;I mean even stalwart comic fans have always wondered if Batman came up with all this stuff on his own.
6626;It's these little touches that make this movie so good.
6627;the rest of the supporting cast is superb, too.
6628;This very much stays with the canon created in the Batman Year One story by Frank Miller.
6629;Murphy fits the gangly scarecrow character very well.
6630;The scenery was just gorgeous.
6631;In the final summation this is really Christian Bale's movie.
6632;He comes the closest by far, of playing the character the way he's always been depicted in comics for over 65 years.
6633;We can only hope that Warner will continue to let this creative group continue to handle the Batman franchise.
6634;due that it will have you believing in heroes again.
6635;A must see movie that will entertain adults as well as children.
6636;I was absolutely convinced that Christian Bale is Batman .
6637;I bought this for a gift for my brother.
6638;A well made movie on blu.
6639;I love comic book movies and this is one of the best.
6640;This is not just an action movie, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the story was interesting and kept you watching.
6641;The BD version takes the SD version to a whole new level!
6642;The colors are brighter, the clarity even better and the audio is fantastic .
6643;Our family estimates that it takes about 3 minutes to bring up the main menu.
6644;This latest Batman installment out of the past 4 is simply one of the best ones and in my book ties with the original from 1989.
6645;This one really balances all out and doesn't overkill on any one element.
6646;I really recommend this to everyone.
6647;Tim Burton's version of Batman is memorable and distinctive, but director Christopher Nolan's vision of Batman has put a whole new spin on our flying dark avenging caped cruasder.
6648;I would recommend this product to anyone who likes the movie, and to anyone who saw the Dark Knight who hasn't seen this movie yet, this is definitely the definitive version!
6649;If you are like me, and want to hear the explanations (logical explanations, that is) and the background story of a movie, legend etc. then Batman Begins is a dream come true.
6650;"I can only compare it to the opening movie ""Batman"" (I still think that Michael Keaton is the best Batman ever)."
6651;I got that batmobile for my son thats probably the best part of the movie.
6652;roof top batmobile chase, more please, Christian Bale batman eeeygh I don't think so.
6653;star cast in this movie, which helps give it its credibility.
6654;this was something much better.
6655;most Sc. fi super heroe movies are just biding thier time until the hero puts on the costumes, but this movie is watchable from begining to end.
6656;Nolan hit's all the right notes, the editing is fantastic, and Bale feels like he nails the character Bruce Wayne with precision.
6657;man is at his heart, a facist, believing the world should function as he sees it.
6658;all in all the best batman movie hands down, and just a great character driven flick period.
6659;In many ways Batman Begins is the quintessential post.9/11 film that manages to smuggle moral quandaries into a big budgeted blockbuster when the larger discourse surrounding terrorism seemed content to ignore basic questions of justice.
6660;perhaps one of the most brilliant moves that Nolan makes in the film is to spend nearly half of the movie on the training and origins of Batman.
6661;I've often found myself on the anti.
6662;By emphasizing the economics of crime and terrorism, Batman Begins asks us to question the root cause of violence.
6663;the first half of Batman Begins is so well crafted, so methodical in its pacing, that it's almost a shame that Bruce Wayne has to suit up in the second half.
6664;Batman's origins are so compelling that Nolan could have done the entire film without a single appearance of the cape and cowl.
6665;nolan also struggles when filming action sequences.
6666;but perhaps the film's single most glaring misstep is Katie Holmes's tone deaf performance as Bruce Wayne's childhood friend, Rachel Dawes.
6667;batman Begins is a much more uneven film in its second half than in its first half, but it still manages to meld big summer action with surprisingly nuanced questions of how we understand terrorism.
6668;Batman Begins proves that when those in the media stops asking tough questions, popular culture can sometimes smuggle them into the public debate under the guise of entertainment.
6669;Finally they got batma begins right from Bruce Wayne to Ra's AL Gul and Alfred.
6670;Alfred did a good job on by telling bruce to don't waste your father's name everyone did a good job on the film.
6671;the best film of the year
6672;This film is brooding and dark, but also exciting and smart, Batman Begins is a film that understands the essence of one of the definitive superheroes.
6673;As a young adult, Wayne lives among the League of Shadows, a martial arts group in the mountains of Asia.
6674;now a beautiful woman and dedicated lawyer.
6675;who steals every scene with chilling menace.
6676;taints the water system with a hallucinatory substance, Batman realizes he has met his first true opponent.
6677;Good story, excellent character developement, and awesome action scenes make this the best batman movie to come out in years.
6678;This is a definite must see for fans and non fans of the series alike.
6679;This year lady and gentlemen, Batman Begins!
6680;This movie is so good, that it was a breath of fresh air.
6681;The story line is awesome, and the director did a great job capturing it.
6682;All of the features that were described on the product page were present and the movie was in perfect condition.
6683;Nolan brings a whole new level to superhero movies.
6684;This is a movie that every superhero movie lovers must watch.
6685;I would have to rank this as the 3rd best in the series, behind the first two.
6686;I will say I liked Christian Bale much better than Clooney or Kilmer, but this role was perfected by Michael Keaton.
6687;The supporting actors were excellent, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, but the one who played the heroic cop was SOO boring.
6688;As you can see, casting was a mixed bag.
6689;In becoming one of their finest students, though, Wayne must complete his rite of passage by taking the life of a man who murdered his neighbor in a territorial dispute.
6690;And through his initial journey, he's assisted by the likes of his long.
6691;My favorite aspects of the film are its dark and gloomy atmosphere, the especially wonderful cast, and an extremely well.
6692;written script that manages to amaze and inspire for both the characters and overall narrative.
6693;In addition to some excellent plot development and character exposition between him and his one.
6694;time mentor, I also thought it made for a great climax and clashing of ideals between two similarly.
6695;sharp detail, Wally Pfister's photography is duly represented here and is as sharp as I saw in the theater.
6696;Very intricate weaving in the costumes and fine texturing in facial features and skin look excellent.
6697;colors are about as bold as they should be, while blacks are almost perfect.
6698;Nonetheless, it's a much better job than what they did to The Dark Knight.
6699;It's still a pretty good transfer.
6700;Separation is stunning from the get.
6701;"The Bhutanese prison fight does a good job of a ""silence and isolation"" effect between Wayne's beating up of the prisoners and when Ducard confronts him with the proposal for joining The League of Shadows."
6702;the score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard keeps up great pace and mood between all the action and drama, though not nearly to the effect of their work in The Dark Knight, but that's for another review.
6703;The crackling ice on the frozen lake is the first example of subtle, but good, bass levels, while the Batmobile chase, and the various explosions at the end of the movie all make for reference material with some excellent fidelity and dynamics in oomps and thumps.
6704;Part of the difference between what I thought I heard the first time and now, though, lies completely in the newer home theater setup I have.
6705;In fact, it makes a big difference in a lot of the movies I watch these days, so make sure you're somewhat up.
6706;But the actual special features are still pretty informative about the production itself.
6707;A couple of parts are funny, but the rest isn't so much.
6708;Yeah, he's a much better writer, definitely).
6709;back for Batman Begins the following year.
6710;Big props to the guy for dedication, though I'm sure that kind of drastic change in that amount of time won't be good for his health later on.
6711;"The Tumbler (SD
6712;This feature focuses a lot on the actual design, mechanics, and practicality of the Tumbler itself and how they were able to get some great shots of it for the car chase sequence thanks to the amazing talents of stunt driver Chris Cottle.
6713;And from the looks of the terrain, it's pretty amazing they got what they did with so little time to prepare.
6714;Genesis of the Bat (SD"
6715;Specifically, they attribute Batman Begins to a combination of the Year One and The Long Halloween graphic novels.
6716;"The thematic depth here is just the beginning
6717;I must be in the minority of thoroughly enjoying this film, keep in mind that this was before I saw the Dark Knight, so my opinion may seem somewhat dated.
6718;The actors couldn't have been better choosen, Christian Bale does a handsome Bruce Wayne, Gary Oldman plays a very convincing Jim GordonMorgan Freeman, whom I've always liked, introduces Luicus Fox very well, Michael Caine does a very compassionate Alfred, the list goes on.
6719;The backstory on the Wayne family is still very done, and Katie Holmes playing Bruce's love interest, proves that she can do grown.
6720;and so it was with the Batman franchise as well.
6721;What a difference a decade makes.
6722;Teamed with an expert in the genre, co. writer David Goyer, Nolan avoids the pitfalls of Ang Lee's disastrous 'Hulk' and delivers not only the year's best film, but the best 'Super hero' film of all time.
6723;I did enjoy the old movies with that quasi.
6724;The new movie though just fits the character so much better.
6725;without discussing plot, this movie is superior to all other Batman films.
6726;That is a rarity for movies now.
6727;the acting was top notch across the board.
6728;The script was good as well.
6729;In this film they were able to give detail and sharp edges without loosing that dark feeling.
6730;The music was well done and added to the movie without it taking center stage.
6731;Everything just fits well together.
6732;Batman Begins is one of the best films I have seen that has been based off a comicbook series.
6733;The acting as well was very believable, with the characters not being overdone or getting into emotions and interactions that are out of place.
6734;The film has a strong storyline, great script, and a very talented cast.
6735;Batman Begins is a great movie much much better than Batman Forever and Batman and Robin because it was not tring to be a comedy and was being serious.
6736;It has great actors in it as well.
6737;I would get right away one of the best movies that has came out.
6738;The disc is a great value, the transfer from film to disc is incredible and the special effects and soundtrack really pop.
6739;The blu ray is definitely worth it for this movie.
6740;The popular consensus, even by non.
6741;batman fans is that this movie is great.
6742;The movie is brilliant and speaks for itself.
6743;The Dark Knight Trilogy is amazing, and I wanted to have all three movies.
6744;Just as Daniel Craig and the writing crew are bringing a welcome change to the James Bond story, Christian Bale does it for Batman.
6745;Aside from setting a benchmark for other franchises (perhaps most notably 007) to follow, Batman Begins is a remarkably ambitious and mostly successful attempt to bring some real substance to the comic book genre beyond mere mood.
6746;It has a sense of the epic to it, as well as an awareness of the escalation of moral quandaries that come with taking the law into your own hands that haven't been seen in a big.
6747;Christopher Nolan even manages to get strong performances from actors who had long ago drifted into ham and volume like Gary Oldman and Rutger Hauer.
6748;I say, Batman Begins is a good movie, and it made the Dark Knight possible, it breathed life in to the dusty rotting bones of the Batman franchise, (I've heard that somewhere else, just thought it was cool).
6749;Anyway, this movie is good.
6750;It gave you two really cool villans, Ra's Al Gul and the Scarecrow, and it was a good origin story.
6751;Although it's not quite as good as the Dark Knight, it stands alone as a good Batman movie.
6752;Great movie start to a magnificent movie trilogy.
6753;This movie is a great template for any movie that does an origin story.
6754;Swear to me that you love this movie!
6755;This ain't your father's Batman, But this movie is fully charged!
6756;This movie shows the origins of the caped crusader.
6757;Christian Bale was the right guy to play Batman, and He'll be Back.
6758;There was an in depth study of Bruce Wayne and Batman's psychology that departs itself from the last two movies.
6759;In the first one, we had the unwilling hero and in the second one we had the lover.
6760;the childhood memories and haunting of Bruce Wayne had led him into complete emotional and psychological breakdown.
6761;The respect and pain relationship between Liam Neeson and Christian Bale was well portrayed and written"
6762;The gadgets are popular and well know gadgets but they were well used and well explained scientifically in the movie.
6763;the movie ended with a very good link to the first Batman movie that could play the music in your heart.
6764;Christopher Nolan's version of DC Comic's Batman takes itself very seriously .
6765;And you know that part before watching the film.
6766;In 'Batman Begins,' Nolan is very careful in making Batman the center of the film.
6767;It is his film, and Batman is always there, in the middle of good action scenes (including that of souped.
6768;Londoner Nolan's choice is quite unique .
6769;In this sense, and with all name actors, 'Batman Begins' is like Christopher Reeve's 'Superman' .
6770;it takes itself seriously, and very entertaining as well.
6771;I'm a huge fan of the Burton.
6772;The story and characters are primarily developed using visuals.
6773;nolan's film, on the other hand, pretty much spells everything out for the audience.
6774;That's a nice way of putting it.
6775;I personally felt assaulted after seeing this movie.
6776;Everything Batman believed in and his very soul were at stake which, as a viewer, is an easy thing to latch on to.
6777;"Gotham City, as it's presented in BEGINS and in keeping with the ""realistic"" tone of the film, doesn't feel like an otherworldly place where people like Batman and the Scarecrow are common place."
6778;It is absolutely jarring to see an utterly realistic party scene with Bruce Wayne one minute and then see Batman (an instantly ridiculous site in the real world) beating up criminals the next.
6779;The gothic atmosphere perfectly serves both the characters and the plot.
6780;"in BEGINS, we get some good fight scenes, a ""realistic"" tone, an admittedly impressive car chase, some fanboy."
6781;friendly interactions between Batman and Gordon and a generally epic feeling.
6782;Batman Begins is freakin awesome.
6783;"Despite the ""controversy"" about the nipples on the Batsuit and the casting of Michael Keaton as Batman, Burton's BATMAN has remained as the best of all Batman films and one of the better film adaptations of a comic book."
6784;As brilliant as Burton's film was, in his own way he began the downfall of the franchise with BATMAN RETURNS.
6785;Warner Brothers was in deep trouble and with a flagship franchise on the verge of completing sinking, they got serious and took help from those who knew best.
6786;It was worth the wait.
6787;bATMAN BEGINS revises the original Batman films.
6788;Instead, the audience is presented with the struggles of Bruce Wayne.
6789;These experiences make Bruce Wayne the man he is and in turn, allow him to become the Dark Knight.
6790;filled picture will abhor the first 1/2 of the movie.
6791;for a picture based upon a comic book, the acting is superb.
6792;But of course with a cast that includes two Oscar.
6793;Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman is the best person in the role to date.
6794;Michael Caine is a wonderful Alfred, Morgan Freeman is perfect portraying Lucius Fox, and Gary Oldman (one of the most underrated actors today) does a remarkable job of pulling off a young Jim Gordon.
6795;Katie Holmes looks beautiful, but despite the working.
6796;Unlike Man of Steel, Batman is a knight, and a true knight can never be with the lady he loves.
6797;all in all, BATMAN BEGINS is a great action movie and the best Batman picture since Burton's 1989 adaptation.
6798;"I have been waiting to see a movie that shows Batman(Bruce Wayne) the way he should be
6799;This movie is so real"
6800;Christian Bale has the look, feal, and acting ability to be Batman and Bruce Wayne.
6801;He plays the part with such dedication and strength.
6802;The villains in the film are realistic as well.
6803;The Scarecrow is frightening and well done.
6804;Even though he is a little underdeveloped, but it still works, because it is a movie about Bruce Wayne!!
6805;Gritty, realistic within the parameters of the superhero's universe looks like.
6806;Overall, it's a superb movie.
6807;He began in Detective Comics # 27 in 1939 and a legend was born, his TV show brought new popularity, he was brought to the big screen in 4 feature films.
6808;"The full amazing story of how ""Batman Begins"" One of the best Superhero Movies I ever seen among my top 3 favorites ""Superman the Movie"",and the two Spider."
6809;It's as good as the first Batman movie.
6810;An amazing top notch summer blockbuster, really cool art direction, a really cool high flying triumph and I'm even more excited for Fantastic 4, I think It will be better.
6811;See Batman Begins in theaters now and get the full extrodronary story of the masked avenger.
6812;Christopher Nolan has done an outstanding job in making this franchise shine.
6813;Christian Bale is probably the best Batman to date (hopefully no one gets creative and wants to re.
6814;The combination of David Goyer and Chris Nolan writing the film really serves the most justice.
6815;The story is so original and fresh compared to the previous films.
6816;The acting comes at a close second.
6817;star cast really pulls through and delivers real mortal lives.
6818;Christian Bale is a fantastic Batman and Michael Caine makes an even better Alfred.
6819;Our villains are well rounded but I wanted to see more of Scarecrow.
6820;I thought the idea was great to have him in this film and I was kinda longing for more.
6821;the special features are pretty interesting.
6822;The behind the scenes clips are fun, and the In.
6823;movie commentary is cool enough.
6824;Pretty much has your basic special features.
6825;ray player you gotta pick up this flick.
6826;is the most interesting thing about this film.
6827;They finally start fighting eventually, but Nolan's style detracts from the effect he is obviously trying to create: excitement.
6828;(we get it: the Batmobile is really fast n stuff.)
6829;Style for one, and panache for another.
6830;"taking this introduction to Batman into account, I believe that's why so many of us felt betrayed by Joel Schumacher's ""Batman Forever"" and especially by ""Batman and Robin."""
6831;screen incarnation of Bruce Wayne and The Dark Knight.
6832;always humble opinion, it was worth it, from start to finish.
6833;Batman Begins gives us the best movie version origins of both Bruce Wayne and Batman.
6834;Taking into account the success Marvel Comics has had as of late with their big screen adaptations, including top.
6835;"notch casting and infusing characters with more humanity, ""Batman Begins"" incorporates both and uses them to perfection."
6836;tim Burton's films were fantastic in their visual style and sense of adventure, but what lacked in my opinion was a clear understanding and compassion to our hero's cause.
6837;"In ""Batman Begins,"" it's more than just good guy versus bad guy
6838;we are given a terrific tale of how Batman came to be.
6839;I enjoyed it because it gave us the intelligent, methodical, and brooding Batman who is the servant of justice, instead of the 'ka.
6840;In my opinion, Christian Bale is the best Batman, even though many of you will undoubtedly disagree.
6841;And, yes, even Joey Potter herself, Katie Holmes, was very good.
6842;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I can't wait for Batman's return.
6843;I thought that this was a very good adaptation of Batman.
6844;It is definitely the best of the ones that have been done.
6845;The cast was excellent and Christian Bale does and outstanding job.
6846;Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Liam Neeson are all solid as usual.
6847;This tells of the teenage Bruce Wayne and how he learns his fighting skills.
6848;And Ra Sa Ghul who is done just perfectly.
6849;I really bought this disk for two reasons.
6850;If you liked the earlier Batman movies, you'll probably like this one even more.
6851;This movie shows us how Batman begins and how Bruce Wayne became the Caped Crusader and it is an impressive film with an impressive cast from Michael Cane to Tom Wilkinson.
6852;Revenge of the Sith, by the best movie of 2005.
6853;He has absolutely no 'super' powers and really has to get by on skills and training.
6854;That is why, when this came out, it was extremely exciting.
6855;It is quite interesting and entirely plausable.
6856;He molds himself into this role perfectly, It was like he was always suppose to be Batman.
6857;As Batman, he is truly perfect.
6858;the supporting cast is great as well.
6859;He brings a great balance to the film, with wit, charm and just the right touch of humour, when the film calls for it.
6860;And his empowering speeches are something to behold.
6861;my other favorite character is Gorden, played by the always brilliant Gary Oldman.
6862;He is spot on in this role.
6863;I always enjoy watching his scenes, especially between him and Batman.
6864;He is probably my favorite character in this, save for Batman.
6865;liam Neeson has a nice juicy role as well, though he is barely in the film.
6866;He always has great presence.
6867;the visuals are all spectacular, as are the costumes, and the Batman car is pretty darn cool.
6868;All in all, it's a great re.
6869;invention of the Batman franchise.
6870;Loved the darkness of this version.
6871;Batman is one of us, he is a vampire.
6872;batman Begins s a movie made for a home theater system, it has great visuals and an even better plot.
6873;The set includes mini documentaries galore, the trailer that helped get us pumped up months before the movie came out, and a mini comic book ( mini in size not length).
6874;this was a decent action movie, not as good as Spiderman 2.
6875;I did love their basic idea of explaining how Batman and all his props and methods came to be.
6876;The philosophy was suitable for NFL voiceovers, and the action mostly revolved around explosions and swooping.
6877;one because I have to give everything AT LEAST one star, and one because I laughed at the man muscles.
6878;it may be a bright new industry.
6879;I bought this because I am a huge Batman fan and love the movies directed by Christopher Nolan.
6880;This guy is a visionary.
6881;The movie in Blu Ray is just perfect 10/10.
6882;A must for any afficionado of Batman movies.
6883;My kids loved seeing each new """"toy"""" as Batman discovered the secret arsenal he had and then the creation of the Bat Cave."""
6884;And, in my humble opinion, Christian Bale is still the best of the Batman actors.
6885;Chris Nolan reboots the Batman story with a darker tone and an amazing cast.
6886;Considered one of the best films of that year, it is a must see for any movie lover.
6887;"Batman Begins is the best of the franchise, beating Tim Burton's first film, which was better than his sequel
6888;All were bound by comic book fantasy, full of superheroes battling bogeymen.
6889;director Christopher Nolan chucks that formula and gives us a real man in a real city up against his own insecurities and, to be sure, real villains.
6890;size"
6891;"Nolan and his production staff owe a debt to Ridley Scott's futuristic Los Angeles (""Blade Runner."")"
6892;But the success of his movie rests on the shoulders of its star, Christian Bale, who now owns the role if he wants it.
6893;But the resourceful Bale, physically and emotionally, is the whole show.
6894;well, maybe not the whole show.
6895;The locations, the plethora of bats, and detailed sets are a marvel, especially the batcave.
6896;CG imagining is used sparingly, so real environments interface impressively with the actors.
6897;But is the Deluxe Edition going to be available for Full.
6898;Batman Begins is a re.
6899;this film brings back the serious side of the dark knight that the first two films captured perfectly.
6900;christian Bale does an oscar worthy job as Bruce Wayne, on par with Michael Keaton's perfect performance.
6901;Probably the best of the five modern movies made about batman, this one is the most true to the comics and the most realistic.
6902;It may be long, but most will enjoy every minute.
6903;again, incredible movie, outstanding story if I could give it more stars I would.
6904;Ever seen this movie, thanks to amazon I was able to show her this IncredIble movie.
6905;if this is a new Oscar category, this movie should win it.
6906;Needless to say, the movie is great.
6907;When not in the dark, the colors are rich and full.
6908;The sound is clearer and has more definition.
6909;The great beginning of Batman!
6910;In Batman Begins, director Christopher Nolan gave us the most realistic and, at the same time, the most faithful.
6911;It is a great story of origins, as well as of character.
6912;"The film is full of quotes that tell you who Batman is and what he is about: such as Alfred's ""Why do we fall ."
6913;Batman Begins is a well.
6914;defined story about a well.
6915;defined character that is both uplifting and meaningful.
6916;i also think Christian Bale is the definitive Batman.
6917;"Batman is about the costume, the ""muscle,"" the eyes, the mouth and the voice."
6918;Plus, he makes a great Bruce Wayne and has the best Alfred you could possibly ask for .
6919;"Michael Caine
6920;Katie Holmes"
6921;"Gary Oldman
6922;Wayne Manor and the Batcave are both perfect.
6923;You've got the perfect nemesis in Liam Neeson, and the perfect Scarecrow in Cillian Murphy.
6924;forward story about origins and character, and was full of memorable quotes.
6925;One wonders what Nolan and his casting director were thinking .
6926;THAT tells me a lot.
6927;Nolan is going to have to do some soul.
6928;The Dark Knight Series is by far the best Superhero movies I have ever seen!!!!
6929;Loved every minute of it!
6930;Batman Begins does a better job than expected of providing the """"prequel"""" or """"backstory"""" to the canonical Batman myth."""
6931;"The clever link at the end to the ""joker"" story is a nice touch, and the bats (as Bruce calls them, the ""reinforcements"") are terrific."
6932;I adored Michael Keaton and didn't think anyone could replace him as Batman, but I'm happy with the swtich.
6933;"Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman provide a magnificent supporting cast, and the shots of glittering ""Gotham City"" and the high."
6934;for instance the wonderful batmobile (as one homeless person announces mid.
6935;make this movie a delight to watch.
6936;Michael Caine's humanity especially gives the film depth.
6937;"Caine's (""Alfred's"") affection for Bruce Wayne is indeed contagious."
6938;But in the end the payoff is worth every minute.
6939;i also like the way that the romantic interest is handled here.
6940;Nobody realized it until the dark knight came out, but we knew begins was something special.
6941;But on the other hand hes very intense, he takes his character seriously, and understands how to portray both batman and bruce.
6942;I think all the other characters were casted perfectly and they all play there parts very well.
6943;Christian Bale makes the best Batman so far, and the rest of the cast, especially Michael Caine and Liam Neeson, are superb.
6944;It's a suspenseful thrill ride from start to finish.
6945;"i enjoyed the movie as a ""movie"", but not so much as a ""batman"" movie."
6946;in short, bale is a great bruce wayne, horriblr batman.
6947;the rest of the cast is good, great even.
6948;This was a fantastic portrayal of Batman.
6949;and it is great (they could do better with the cataloging process)The Prime Video Service does not always have the latest movies but for the price, the movie and tv selection is awsome .
6950;And if you order things from amazon, chances are real good that you won't have to pay shipping .
6951;I would recommend this to everyone.
6952;Loved Christian Bale and all of the other actors in it.
6953;Love all of the action in it for sure.
6954;Batman Begins is by far the best movie about the caped crusader to ever hit the screen.
6955;This is such a maseter piece and can't wait til the dark kinght comes out.
6956;The writing is brilliant, the sets are very good, and the acting is fantastic.
6957;"I mean when you have Liam Neeson, Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine
6958;I love how the writer came up with Batman's childhood.
6959;I never would have developed his life in such a great way.
6960;This is one the great movies of all times, perfect for the begining of the hole series the acting the effect, Christian Bale is the best Batman.
6961;I love Batman Begins and upgraded to Blu.
6962;It got here early and looks new.
6963;Thanks you guys are great!
6964;I personally think this is the best Batman movie to date.
6965;The story, although cartoon in character, leads the audience on a journey that's almost believable.
6966;what a great cast of actors, Christian Bale who plays Batman and a supporting cast of great talent: Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutgar Hauer, Ken Watanabe, and Morgan Freeman.
6967;The cinematography is exceptional and so is the great musical soundtrack by Hans Zimmer.
6968;Christopher Nolan is a very good director, coming from classic films like Memento.
6969;This is an excellent adaptation of the Batman comic book series and in my mind is the best in a series of recent adaptations of the Caped Crusader.
6970;That said, the story is well told and flows logically"
6971;That said, Batman Begins is a film that takes itself seriously and is not a film that has been punched up with a witty sidekick or other comic relief.
6972;That the film is not overwhelmed by its seriousness is a tribute to both the director and a superb cast of both main and supporting actors.
6973;Katie Holmes shows that she is more than Mrs. Tom Cruise with a well.
6974;rounded performance as love interest Rachael Dawes.
6975;Given the star power in the supporting cast, I'm a bit surprised that Christian Bale, a relative unknown, got cast in the title role.
6976;I was pleasantly surprised by his range in this role, which is likely to vault him into super.
6977;special effects in this film are nothing remarkable, though the shots in Iceland (which plays Bhutan in this film) are beautiful cinematography.
6978;The score by Hans Zimmer is outstanding and reflects the dark and serious nature of the film instead of veering into a comic book sensibility.
6979;that said, if you want to see one of 2005's best films and a new standard for the Batman series, this is the film to watch.
6980;Christian Bale brings true life and emotion to the Batman character.
6981;Completely action packed and a true winner!
6982;Batman Begins is an exciting start to the modern Batman trilogy.
6983;Even more than that, it's a well plotted, intense action movie.
6984;The best so far this summer.
6985;This movie does owe a little to Tim Burton's original, but it has so much more substance to it.
6986;For the first time Bruce Wayne is a three dimensional character I sympathized with.
6987;something kind of interesting is, there aren't any big superhero fight scenes like we've seen in movies like Spider.
6988;and just a great movie.
6989;I want to see it again.
6990;I really like well written action movies and this was one of them.
6991;The camera shots and scenes were excellent.
6992;Even as I write this I want to see it again.
6993;I don't know about the other Batman movies but this one is worth watching.
6994;"But then Tim Burton, then a new visionary talent on the rise, came along with just enough familiarity with Batman and just enough strength of will and vision to make it happen, and with the backing of the success of ""Beetle."
6995;After all, he's one of the great iconic comic book characters alongside the X. men, Spider.
6996;Once again, writers, directors, and actors came and went in the seven years between now and then, but finally things came together with director Christopher Nolan, writer David S. Goyer and star Christian Bale.
6997;the result is the familiar but well told origin story of how Bruce Wayne lost his wealthy and warm.
6998;batman/Bruce Wayne is well played by Christian Bale.
6999;feet tall, good looking, muscular, and actually possessing good solid acting ability, here's hoping they don't lose him.
7000;Christian Bale's performance is amazing as he grows up and transforms into Batman.
7001;The storyline keeps the viewer's interest throughout every moment with suspense, mystery, and action in every scene.
7002;Hands down, this is one of my favorite movies ever!
7003;There were some great action scenes in the second half, including an exciting chase involving the first Batmobile.
7004;And it is fun seeing the origins of the Bat Cave, the Bat Signal (in the sky), etc.
7005;The acting is also solid, especially by Bale, Caine, and Freeman.
7006;Great film if you get this get the dark knight too
7007;Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors and christrian bale has become of my favorite actors after seeing BATMAN BEGINS.
7008;A great movie with equally great extras.
7009;The dark knife trilogy is by far one of the best trilogy's ever!
7010;With great action and suspense these are must watch movies!
7011;This is by far the best Batman movie I've ever seen.
7012;the writing and the stunt work was very good.
7013;I was so thrilled that Christian Bale was cast as Batman/Bruce Wayne in this prequel, because he's such a great actor, and he's work in The Machinist was amazing.
7014;I think he's portrayal of Batman is more impressive than the previous actors'.
7015;He's very attractive as Bruce Wayne, and he's so captivating as Batman.
7016;He deserves extra credit for being a British actor playing an American superhero, and he had to regain more than 50 lbs of lean muscles for the role right after he finished The Machinist.
7017;Liam Neeson looks rather unattractive in a wierd beard, and he's probably the most outstanding supporting player in this film.
7018;with the help of his housekeeper Alfred Pennyworth(Michael Caine), and Lucius Fox(Morgan Freeman), who was a weapon specialist, Wayne was able to transform into full Batman gear for the first time.
7019;Wayne eventually reunited with Rachel when she was in danger and rescued her from the toxic chemicals.
7020;the sets are very elaborate, both the structure of the Gothem City and the remote landscapes were quite an eye candy.
7021;The fight scenes were great, especially the car chase scene when the Batmobile was crossing over rooftops.
7022;Overall, this movie is very entertaining, and it's the first time to see so much of Bruce Wayne that isn't depicted in previous Batman movies.
7023;I honestly think that Christian Bale is defintely the best batman ever, this guy was perfect for the role as the dark knight, i love this movie it was great!
7024;For one, it's got Christian Bale in the lead role, Michael Caine as the strongest Alfred ever, Rutger Hauer as a Donald Trump lookalike, Morgan Freeman acting about like James Bond's Q, and a bunch of other good talent.
7025;The fight scenes are good, but oddly indistinct.
7026;and Gotham City is good, too.
7027;It's a good vision: tall, sweeping Art Deco lines, especially in that monorail.
7028;this one's really good, even if you don't usually like comic book movies.
7029;It's got good, varied action, and good characters, or good enough.
7030;In a summer of good summer movies, this is about the best so far.
7031;I looked at the prices and this was actually cheaper, can you believe it?
7032;And the cover is beautiful !
7033;I would recommend this product to my friends!
7034;If you don't think about what is going on in the movie and just watch, you just might enjoy it.
7035;How many times are we going to see a fight on a moving train in superhero movies.
7036;Like I said, don't think to much, and you might enjoy the movie.
7037;The sound was fantastic, the picture was awesome.
7038;With that being said, Christopher Nolan, did a fantastic job with this film.
7039;For my money, this is the best Batman film I have ever seen.
7040;This film goes more deeply into Bruce's past.
7041;These guys did such a fantastic with their respective DC characters.
7042;This was a nicely done action/comicbook drama that should have been done in 1989.
7043;CHRISTOPHER NOLAN (director of memento,Blade)has finally done his homework and came up with a movie that actually is a close persona of the Batman after his re.
7044;The WAYNE PERSONA is important because he is the driving force why the Caped crusader is the best at what he does.
7045;The movie does a very good potrayal of how he came to be, where he gets his gadgets and stuff.
7046;Liamm Neeson is great and the scarecrow was well, scary.
7047;If you really want to see what Batman is suppose to look like, check out the fan film, BATMAN:DEAD END.
7048;The mask and the eyes are perfect.
7049;The Batman is believable as a terrifying winged creature of the night.
7050;overall the movie itself was great.
7051;I just hope Nolan does a good Joker like in the fan film mentioned above.
7052;Christopher Nolan, the director, was primarily known for the exceedingly clever Memento.
7053;"My worries were misplaced
7054;This is easily the best Batman movie yet.
7055;the first two Batmans were well received and are loved by many.
7056;the 3rd movie, Batman Forever, was a dramatic departure from the first two.
7057;Still, the cast handled the script well, and in my opinion, it worked reasonably well.
7058;Put forth a really credible """"man under the mask""""."""
7059;batman Begins manages to accomplish all of the above.
7060;The movie is dark, but tinges of humor are interlaced throughout.
7061;cast/Acting: Batman Begins has a huge cast of A. list names.
7062;Michael Caine makes a great Alfred, if more serious than I expected.
7063;Ken Watanabe and Cilian Murphy play very convincing villains.
7064;murphy, in particular, is very fun to watch.
7065;Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman are very welcome additions to the cast and provide some of the film's best moments.
7066;Finally, Christian Bale is far and away the best man to don the Batman uniform.
7067;He plays both Batman and Bruce so effortlessly that I hope he will get the opportunity to do so again.
7068;plot: Superhero movies always have to walk the fine line of respecting the source material while making it accessible to audiences and conforming it to a cinematic format.
7069;I can't say I've read many of the Batman comics, but I'm very familiar with both Batman and his villains thanks to Batman: The Animated Series and other sources.
7070;Batman Begins stays true to the Batman character while providing further depth than I've seen elsewhere.
7071;The pacing is perfect, and the first part of the movie provides very believable background for exactly and practically how Batman became Batman.
7072;Unlike other origin stories, this part of the movie manages to be every bit as enthralling as the rest.
7073;layered than any of the previous Batman movies.
7074;Batman Begins is both a character study and, in my opinion, a superhero epic.
7075;The legend of Batman is handled carefully, with respect for long.
7076;music: I'm a big fan of movie scores, and I wasn't dissappointed here.
7077;Howard contributes the beautiful quiet themes while Zimmer contributes the powerful themes he's so well known for.
7078;Together, the two composers take the pacing of an already fantastic movie to another level.
7079;In conclusion, I can only hope that the same forces that came together to create this movie will bring us a sequel.
7080;Batman Begins and returns, indeed!
7081;FINALLY, a Batman film that is more true to the comics!
7082;Dark and witty at the same time.
7083;Much more serious and well done than the recent Batman movies.
7084;While not a comic book fan, I did enjoy the Tim Burton Batman films.
7085;the characters were human and the relationships genuine.
7086;The chemistry of the cast is fantastic (though I have a hard time thinking of a film I didn't like with Morgan Freeman or Michael Caine).
7087;The storyline is pretty good showing the childhood of Bruce Wayne to how he became Batman.
7088;The first one in 89 was good, but after that, they all completely blowed.
7089;then I saw the trailer for Batman Begins, and it was amazing.
7090;The acting was great, and Liam Neeson was a great actor for Ra's.
7091;He was a great actor as well.
7092;Hans Zimmer is amazing with this movie.
7093;Already creating incredible soundtracks for Gladiator and King Arthur, for example, he was perfect for Batman.
7094;The music makes the exciting action scenes 20 times better.
7095;I honestly got chills when i watched this movie, it was so good.
7096;"And the ""scary"" parts, or more disturbing parts with the toxin being inhaled by batman and other people, made THOSE scenes perfect as well."
7097;the new batmobile is simply amazing.
7098;batman's outfit is much better in these movies.
7099;And the guy who said earlier that he can barely move his head, well, he moves it plenty.
7100;This is the best cape ever made.
7101;This movie was the best movie i've seen in a long time.
7102;It makes me happy to know that it wasn't really associated with the old ones, and it isn't part of that franchise.
7103;I'd heard good things about the movie before I went to see it, so I was enthusiastic about seeing the movie.
7104;michael Keaton, IMHO, was the best live.
7105;action Batman to hit the big screen, and Bale had to at least equal Keaton's intensity in order to earn my respect.
7106;the good news is, Bale makes the cut.
7107;The great news is, this is by far the best live.
7108;action Batman movie in existence!
7109;"action and embrace a ""new Batman order""."
7110;gadgetman Morgan Freeman and the affable Michael Caine as Alfred.
7111;She's got age and naturally occurring collagen on Ms. Basinger, and little else.
7112;overall, I rate this movie 5 stars, and give it the highest possible recommendation.
7113;This movie not only was as good as the original batman, it was better.
7114;True comic lovers will appreciate the detail and dedication the director had to put into this movie.
7115;He is definitely at the forefront of the story.
7116;Christian Bale is the most intense and angry Bruce Wayne so far in the series and his Batman is even angrier.
7117;The origin of Batman is explored with greater depths and one of the key ingredients is the character of Bruce Wayne's father Thomas Wayne played by Linus Roache, who comes off as interesting a character as Bruce Wayne.
7118;layered and involving tying in Batman's origin with a plot of an ancient secret society to destroy Gotham City.
7119;An impressive cast in this film surrounds Christian Bale.
7120;Gary Oldman who has made a career of playing evil characters is terrific as the pre.
7121;, it is the single best line in the whole film!
7122;This is a great re.
7123;introduction of Batman to the motion picture scene and a needed boost for the Batman franchise.
7124;Batman Begins was a great movie.
7125;Wanted to refresh myself for the newer Batman series in theaters.
7126;I enjoyed this movie because it helped set the scene for The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises, but I realized that it wasn't entirely necessary for me to enjoy the other two movies.
7127;I like the way this trilogy of stories is told, so I was probably always destined to like this movie.
7128;Batman has obtained cult status with all ages.
7129;actionwise this movie is fantastic.
7130;The special effects in the battles are very good.
7131;i really think this movie is worth watching and I am glad that I got it.
7132;I definetly recommend it for any Batman fans.
7133;That is, of course, until this masterpiece from Christopher Nolan.
7134;"adventure fare, this film delved into the important issue of ""why is a man driven to dress up as a bat?"""
7135;"thus, the plot of this movie centers on Bruce Wayne's transformation into the Dark Knight, an intriguing process that probes the very roots and civilized society and makes us question whether ""right"" really is ""right""."
7136;The genius of this film, as a result, is the portrayal of Batman as a vigilante, not entirely accepted by all citizens of Gotham City.
7137;Those questions are what will keep this movie in your mind long after viewing.
7138;finally, the acting in this movie is terrific.
7139;Christian Bale is easily the best Batman to date, while an ensemble cast of Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Homes, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman are delightful to watch in each's respective role.
7140;overall, this film is nearly the perfect amalgamation of intense action, superb acting, and thought.
7141;discover the true Dark Knight as represented by this film.
7142;What a great start to a hopeful new trilogy.
7143;I very much look forward to the next one.
7144;Every thing is realistic and well thought out and explained.
7145;other than katie holmes the movie is perfect.
7146;if you do bring something to slit your wrists with.
