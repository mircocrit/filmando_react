I:67;1;All I can say is its about time this film is a masterpiece it has excellent PQ the sound is excellent great extras the casting is spectacular because ofJjack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway
I:67;2;I just love this movie.
I:67;3;I was very pleased to find that Amazon had it free with prime membership.
I:67;4;Jack Nicholson is great in it.
I:67;5;I would say this is my pick for the best movie ever made.
I:67;6;Roman Polanski's finest work takes place in a prewar Los Angeles where everyone has a past they would just as soon keep hidden, where morality is fluid, to say the least, and where respectability is generally always fraudulent.
I:67;7;It also happens to be the most interesting film ever made about water.
I:67;8;In fact, there have been few films quite as exciting and engaging as Chinatown ever to come out in Hollywood.
I:67;9;believable dialogue, virtuosic acting, editing, scoring.
I:67;10;it's a rare kind of film that has everything working for it (Citizen Kane is another example) and it single.
I:67;11;handedly revived film noir while adding countless new, imaginative touches (such as the infamous Jack Nicholson nose scene).
I:67;12;Needless to say, it's a great film.
I:67;13;Still, the creative staff could, at the time, have savored the fact that it had another parallel to Citizen Kane.
I:67;14;both films only won Oscar honors for their screenplays.
I:67;15;It's quite a profound drop we've seen in film since 1974.
I:67;16;a year where three undeniably great films were nominated for Best Picture (GF II, Chinatown, and The Conversation).
I:67;17;This is one of the greatest of all films.
I:67;18;it's entertaining, enlightening, and emotionally resonant in a way that few works of art are.
I:67;19;it's right up there with Greek tragedy.
I:67;20;one of the best films to come out of the Hollywood boom years of the late sixties and seventies, Chinatown is remarkable not only for its gorgeous cinematography by John A. Alonzo but for its memorable script by Robert Towne.
I:67;21;the transfer is competent and bests any version I've seen.
I:67;22;The 5.1 soundtrack, though not the intended version, adds a satisfactory dimension to the music and ambiance.
I:67;23;chinatown holds the #2 position on the American Film institute's list of Best Mystery Films of all times.
I:67;24;It also was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won for Best Screenplay.
I:67;25;It won several Golden Globe Awards .
I:67;26;Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Screenplay.
I:67;27;But the biggest beef I have is with the direction.
I:67;28;forties and fifties films like Panic in the Streets, the Asphalt Jungle, An Ace in the Hole or Laura.
I:67;29;Chinatown is one of the classics, a flawlessly.
I:67;30;Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway are in top form, as is director Roman Polanski.
I:67;31;Perplexed by what he knows he does seek out the truth.
I:67;32;There are jolts and twists up until the end as the relationship between Nicholson and Dunaway grows.
I:67;33;The directing is top notch.
I:67;34;Sound and picture are strong.
I:67;35;a preview and an interview with the producer, writer, and director but the interview is very enlightening and will assist with a greater understanding about the film.
I:67;36;This is a superb, as the amazon reviewer says, deeply satisfying movie.
I:67;37;New layers are constantly revealed to the plot, and Nicholson's character thrills with his reckless persistence in the face of the unknown, and his ability to always know more than people think.
I:67;38;Twists galore in this fascinating film noir about a corrupt businessman and his family, investigated by a private detective.
I:67;39;a true classic that still has the power to surprise and shock.
I:67;40;it had great reviews from critics and had a good run at the box office too when it was released.
I:67;41;Chinatown is a film packed of mystery, plot twists, suspense, incredible revelations, great performances, great direction, great storytelling, great.
I:67;42;well, in few words, everything is great.
I:67;43;Jack Nicholson (as J. j. Gittes) delivers one of his best performances, perhaps second only to his performance in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest .
I:67;44;Faye Dunaway is also pretty good as Evelyn Mulwray, and John Huston delivers an incredible performance as the corrupt water Baron Noah Cross.
I:67;45;a tough guy who doesn't mind taking a beating for the good of the cause, is resourceful, loyal and resolute and also has a little spare time for the ladies (of course without strings, if possible).
I:67;46;conflicted femme fatale carrying a big family secret is a good match up for Nicholson's tough guy detective.
I:67;47;great acting, lots of suspense.
I:67;48;old but very appropriate for LA.
I:67;49;Very believable if you know the water history of California.
I:67;50;For my money, Chinatown its one of the best noir films (faux.
I:67;51;The plot is a bit complex so you need to follow it carefully.
I:67;52;Be prepared for a few shockers!
I:67;53;I find older movies better than the newer ones.
I:67;54;Robert Towne's screenplay is still one of the best, but the film itself has lost a bit of its bite.
I:67;55;This is a very clever mishmash of rumor, fact, and outright fabrication.
I:67;56;I've seen Chinatown numerous times and was delighted to find it on Amazon, free with Prime membership.
I:67;57;The musical score conveys the sense of the movie.
I:67;58;One of many great Jack Nicholson movies.
I:67;59;It's refreshing to see a movie that isn't counting on special effects to make it worth seeing.
I:67;60;An excellent cast combined with great direction and cinematography yield a fantastic thriller.
I:67;61;Nicholson is always great to watch!
I:67;62;Polanski gets everything right with this one, creating a film that is stunning, captivating, dark and brooding while always maintaining a level of hope that helps glue the audience to their seats (even if that hope is crushed in the devastating finale).
I:67;63;There are few films that have been able to capture this aura, the most recent being `L. a. Confidential'.
I:67;64;the crime noir is something difficult to master, but Polanski masters is effortlessly.
I:67;65;the script is brilliantly crafted, allowing the audience to sink into the grit of the situation with ease, building slowing on its foundation until the dramatic and explosive conclusion.
I:67;66;Much must be accredited to Polanski who just pulls from all angles and draws the audience in with each and every frame.
I:67;67;The murky, gritty feel to the film elevates the material and makes the audience feel a part of the action, and Polanski's resulting vision is one of beautiful demise.
I:67;68;a great facet of this film is the marvelous performances by the entire cast, most notably Jack Nicholson.
I:67;69;`Chinatown' is one of those times when he steps away from his public persona and just delivers a well rounded and fantastically crafted character.
I:67;70;J. j. `Jake' Gittes is one of Jack's greatest cinematic accomplishments and certainly one of his greatest performances.
I:67;71;Jack is given some ample help though, in the form of Faye Dunaway and John Huston, both of whom bring so much to this film.
I:67;72;Dunaway is dynamite here, really stakeing her claim as Nicholson's equal, and as the film draws to a close and her character is finally fleshed out to the full she emotes so much genuine emotion she helps that transition work.
I:67;73;Huston is delicious here, seriously.
I:67;74;`Chinatown' is filled to the brim with enough of everything to keep the audience glued in anticipation.
I:67;75;The script is marvelous, tightly woven and intricate, always keeping you guessing and wanting more.
I:67;76;The acting is superb, truly elevating each and every scene and the mood set is pitch.
I:67;77;perfect, and it never wanes.
I:67;78;One of the reasons I liked Chinatown best is that it takes us back to a time when traditional film noir movies were made back in the 1940's.
I:67;79;Aside from the have sex the day you meet cliche which is unfortunately in almost every movie, Chinatown is believable and realistic.
I:67;80;Chinatown is a metaphor about all that has happened in the film and in the lives of the characters within it.
I:67;81;That, I feel, is the film's greatest aspect.
I:67;82;It does have some nice things on it: a new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack, production notes, a trailer, and some retrospective interviews with the creators of the film.
I:67;83;There, it was huge, big, and beautiful, preserving every tiny detail and taking me to a place that movies today haven't taken me before!
I:67;84;I felt like I was really there!
I:67;85;I suppose that is the best they can do with a video release of Chinatown , and you know it's never going to look at good as it did in the theaters.
I:67;86;Chinatown is still as powerful, as mysterious, and as beautiful a film as it was when it first came out!
I:67;87;This is one of the greatest all time Film Noirs.
I:67;88;The actings is spectacular, the direction and cinematography is unmatchable, and the screenplay is one of the most complete you will find throughout Hollywood history.
I:67;89;Not to spoil it, but the moment near the end with the car horn is one of the most clever bits of filmmaking using sound and visuals to create effect that I have ever seen.
I:67;90;Chinatown is a unique film in many ways and is considered a classic.
I:67;91;I enjoyed watching the film but the ending changed my opinion a bit.
I:67;92;First of all, the plot and dialogue was very intelligent and I really like that about it.
I:67;93;"I'm not surprised that script won an academy award
I:67;94;The casting was also very good.
I:67;95;Nicholson and Dunaway had a unusual but strong chemistry and the supported cast helped build a believable world around them.
I:67;96;It had the fairly typical detective plot but so much of the film was shot in bright, outdoor scenes.
I:67;97;In a largely objective way, it was okay.
I:67;98;I did fit certain themes of the film and brought an odd sort of closure to the plot.
I:67;99;In the end, i think Chinatown was a very intelligent movie that kept my attention but i cant say that i want to watch it many more times.
I:67;100;I really enjoyed the movie, it was the first time I had seen it.
I:67;101;The plot and the actors were outstanding.
I:67;102;I also enjoyed the setting and time period of the film.
I:67;103;The music score matches the mood and action of this movie.
I:67;104;faye Dunnaway's performance was excellent as adult survivor of abuse.
I:67;105;An enjoyable film to watch on first and second and third viewing (if so inclined) and great to sit down after and deconstruct for personal filmmaking pleasure.
I:67;106;making were performed here at an extraordinarily high level, and the result is one of the most satisfying movies ever made.
I:67;107;start with the wonderful script by Robert Towne that borrows from and re.
I:67;108;His plot, characters and dialogue entertain and intrigue us and the film's brilliant central metaphor, Chinatown, reveals, conceals and resonates long after the credits roll.
I:67;109;The supporting players are equally well.
I:67;110;then put this story and cast in the hands of a brilliant director with an equally gifted cinematographer, and turn them loose.
I:67;111;Chinatown succeeds because its mystery is actually mysterious, its story complex, its secrets genuinely surprising.
I:67;112;finally, art direction, costuming and period detail in Chinatown is beautiful and meticulous.
I:67;113;And the music score is so good that it has been imitated many times in Chinatown wannabes.
I:67;114;Chinatown is about as good as Hollywood can do, meeting both the obligations of entertainment while uniting and presenting the various craftsmanship of film.
I:67;115;making at such a high standard that it raises the result to the level of art.
I:67;116;this unique confluence of story and talent occurs rarely, but when it clicks, as it did so brilliantly in Chinatown, the result is the masterpiece we all recognized from its initial release.
I:67;117;A timeless and indispensible film that would be diminished by any change or subtraction of any piece of its construct, this one should not be missed.
I:67;118;While this movie has a decent plot and great acting by Jack Nicholson, people tend to get carried away at talking about how great the screenplay is and how great Roman Polanski was in directing this film.
I:67;119;For a movie to be a fantasic noir film, I would also argue that it has to have great characters other than just the main lead.
I:67;120;namely, it has to have a great femme fatale and great dialogue between that person and the lead.
I:67;121;Jack is at his best and looks the part of an LA private eye in the 1920's.
I:67;122;his character Jake Gittes (a name he borrowed from a well known Hollywoodproducer and friend) is one of his most memorable.
I:67;123;Viewed: 10/04, 5/06, 1/09, 10/10Rate: 105/06: Chinatown is the quintessential film noir and a prime example of what a neo noir looks like.
I:67;124;Every single aspect that comprises of Chinatown is thoroughly refined.
I:67;125;It is also a very meticulously crafted neo noir that benefits the most from every element imaginable: the screenplay by Robert Towne, the direction of Roman Polanski, the acting of Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway without the omission of mentioning everybody else involved, the sunny Californian atmosphere, the scrupulous attention to fine details, and the dark sinister theme that imbues Chinatown.
I:67;126;What makes the movie so great is how important the word film noir is being understood in the first place.
I:67;127;Chinatown traces, interestingly owing the fact that John Huston (played Noah Cross) directed the film noir, its roots from The Maltese Falcon, which makes in all the history very fascinating.
I:67;128;That's why, first and foremost, the acting in Chinatown is absolutely brilliantly done and to the point of genius in cinema sense.
I:67;129;Everything about Chinatown is about strokes of brilliance, masterpiece, and excellence.
I:67;130;Already, I consider it one of the top films ever made.
I:67;131;The fact that The Towering Inferno, even with its cheap cardboard design, beat out Chinatown in the Best Cinematography award in the Academy Awards is astounding!
I:67;132;"It's Chinatown,"" Chinatown has remained one of my favorite pictures, and I adore everything about it."
I:67;133;The film is basically the culmination of all necessary elements that makes me yearn for in any film: the pristine cinematography, the slick direction, the marvelous acting, the fascinating display of emotions, the sharp characterization, the polished writing, and the strong drape of melodrama.
I:67;134;Along with them are the incredible mysteriousness surrounding the circumstances and the unfolding of the story.
I:67;135;Now, to hold a contest of finding out which is the best film noir ever made, is it Chinatown or The Maltese Falcon?
I:67;136;I just love how John Huston comes in a full circle with that plus he did The Asphalt Jungle which I could also say that it's the king of film noir pictures.
I:67;137;Back to the question, both films have all what it takes to fulfill the elements needed to create a film noir, and then they are elevated by the specialness which comes through with that extra effort.
I:67;138;All in all, Chinatown is a sublime masterpiece that really has no equal.
I:67;139;Obviously, the rating of Chinatown stays the same as forever.10/10: It never gets old nor tired: Chinatown remains one of the best movies made.
I:67;140;"Sinister and dark as the plot unfolds, the pictures leads the audience to one of the most unforgettable finishes ever completed with a classic line, ""Forget it, Jake."
I:67;141;But in Chinatown, the characters are real.
I:67;142;The cinematography of sunny California of the 30s and 40s couldn't look any more beautiful.
I:67;143;"The casting is impeccable as ever
I:67;144;All in all, Chinatown is a masterpiece.
I:67;145;Although it was from 1974 it held up well.
I:67;146;Yuck is all I can say.
I:67;147;Spare yourself of this drawn out thing some call a great movie .
I:67;148;"The ending and its It's only Chinatown is ironic
I:67;149;Roman Polanski directed Robert Towne's script into becoming the mold for the contemporary classic.
I:67;150;We are stunned, as an audience, at what we witness throughout this brilliant commentary on how our society works for those with power(money) and those without.
I:67;151;A must own for all fans of cinema!
I:67;152;Bought this for a friend, and he loves it.
I:67;153;Costumes are fabulous, old Los Angels intrigue, and acting is as good as it gets.
I:67;154;What a great movie .
I:67;155;Jack Nicolson and Faye Dunaway are superb in this movie.
I:67;156;Chinatown doesn't only hold up because of the excellent story.
I:67;157;Off course we know it's from the seventies because it's daring, weird and highly original and accompanied by one of the best soundtracks ever written (Jerry Goldsmith).
I:67;158;it's one of the top 5 masterpieces ever made.
I:67;159;The interview with Polanski writers is far to short, but it's there, so that's good.
I:67;160;The 5.1 surround sound is adding to the mood brilliantly.
I:67;161;You're going to spend the majority of this movie wondering why it has the title it does and I'm not going to spoil it for you by mentioning it, but what I will say is that it has one of the great surprise endings in the history of Hollywood.
I:67;162;The plot is outstanding and it's hard to tell where its going based on the first hour alone.
I:67;163;Nicholson is superlative in the role of J. j. Gittes.
I:67;164;His performance is nearly as good as Bogart's was in The Maltese Falcon.
I:67;165;Dunaway and Houston are outstanding as well.
I:67;166;Chinatown is every bit as entertaining as it is excellent.
I:67;167;This is one of the greatest movies ever.
I:67;168;It is the best Noir of the 70's and the best detective movie ever.
I:67;169;Robert Towne's Screenplay is a Landmark in Movie History, and so are the score and cinematography.
I:67;170;But this is Roman Polanski's achievement all the way, his best movie and he'll never top it.
I:67;171;From a scale of 1.10 I give this movie a 10!
I:67;172;Chinatown is a most see for anyone who enjoys cinema.
I:67;173;The characters and story are so rich that you might get a toothache from watching.
I:67;174;As a screenwriter this is one of the best screenplays ever written and one of my favorite movies.
I:67;175;"The script is an excellent example of the three act screenplay and often referenced in screenwriting text books, e. g. Syd Field's, ""Fundamentals of Screenwriting."""
I:67;176;It's a young Jack at his best.
I:67;177;Lastly, lt's Polanski's best directed movie.
I:67;178;The film has it all and there's something here for everyone whether you just want to watch an engaging, entertaining movie or you want to see how to write a screenplay.
I:67;179;BTW, it's based on a true story.
I:67;180;Chinatown is an excellent movie set in Los Angeles in the 1930's.
I:67;181;This is an great movie and I could not recommend it more highly.
I:67;182;Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful score and particularly, the haunting main tile , played so feelingfully by trumper Uan Raseyis unforgettable and a perfect musical setting for this great film.
I:67;183;More proof that one of the golden ages of American cinema was in the '70's.
I:67;184;incredible script, great camera work, great direction.
I:67;185;All the leads are great, all the supporting actors are great, and all of the bit parts are done well .
I:67;186;if you love movies, this is a must.
I:67;187;I had not seen this movie in years but was so glad to see it again.
I:67;188;There was no need for special effects with a story this good.
I:67;189;One of the classiest movies ever made.
I:67;190;The plot is intricate and multi.
I:67;191;layered, and best appreciated after many viewings.
I:67;192;Roman Polanski directed and does so with great care and attention to details.
I:67;193;Nicholson is riveting throughout, even with that bandage on his nose most of the movie.
I:67;194;And that haunting theme music over the closing credits .
I:67;195;Chinatown is by far one of the best films ever made.
I:67;196;Jacl Nicholson's character, Jack Gittes,is one of the most memorable characters ever to come out in film.
I:67;197;The film is great and the Roman Pulanski does a magnifecent job of capturing 1937 L. a.
I:67;198;The films Noir style is amazing and the characters and story are so full of believability you would think this is a documentery.
I:67;199;It is by far the most amazing movie I have ever seen
I:67;200;This is a film you absolutely need to see at least twice.
I:67;201;The first time through you'll be gasping for air, trying to keep up with the twists and turns in the plot.
I:67;202;The second time through, you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.
I:67;203;Those willing to view it again and again will find more and more to love in this amazingly dense but satisfying film.
I:67;204;Jack Nicholson is perfect in the lead role, and the rest of the cast is equally at home in roles that flesh out this well woven tale.
I:67;205;The look and feel of this film is fantastic.
I:67;206;The best art direction, cinematography and the higest production.
I:67;207;A classic noir experience filled with intrigue and a solid plot.
I:67;208;Great story, great acting, great direction and presentation, and one of the great lines in film, Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown.
I:67;209;Good story that will hold your interest.
I:67;210;A good combination of who dun it and decent acting.
I:67;211;Even if you are not a fan of the detective genre it is still a great film.
I:67;212;"In spite of the useless reviews, I am happy to report that the ""Special Collector's edition ."
I:67;213;A classic right from the start, this film gives you the sense of the old 30's and 40's film noir.
I:67;214;Made 30 years ago, it still feels contemporary today and will always be a modern classic piece of excellent film.
I:67;215;for anyone who enjoys authenticity of the movie in the retelling of the novel, including the setting, feeling of the story, and the atmosphere it generates, this is a masterpiece.
I:67;216;Chinatown is my favorite film.
I:67;217;It really captures the 1930s in LA along with great characters, plot, dialougue, and technical aspects.
I:67;218;This is why the film is great for repeat viewing.
I:67;219;I've seen the film ten times now, and I learn something every time I view it.
I:67;220;It's truly ironic that the best film nior came out of the 70s.
I:67;221;The first extra feature isn't much but it's interesting.
I:67;222;The other extra feature worth mentioning is the interview with producer Bob Evans, director Roman Polanski, and writer Robert Towne.
I:67;223;It is a wonderful look at what these three men did to get the film made.
I:67;224;Each men has something unique to bring to the interview.
I:67;225;Loved the story, direction, and performances.
I:67;226;The transfer on the steel book blu ray is stunning.
I:67;227;This film is excellent, and made in the 70's around LA, specifically East LA where I grew up.
I:67;228;Great murder mystery and excellent music.
I:67;229;Two great actors giving stellar performances and delighting the audience with their skills on the screen.
I:67;230;Loved this movie and certainly adds to my already appreciated enthusiasm for them.
I:67;231;I the spirit of Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe, Jake Gettes untangles a web of mystery and intrigue.
I:67;232;I've always enjoyed this, and now with blue ray you can't do any better.
I:67;233;The telling of the rather dark story holds up very well and I agree with all the favorable comments made here.
I:67;234;As a side note: It always amuses me when I see Jack Nicholson, the leading character, appearing in a great portion of the film with a bandage on his nose!
I:67;235;What a great suspense thriller.
I:67;236;Just love Jack, so young and handsome.
I:67;237;This is a must see movie.
I:67;238;Jack Nicholas is at his best.
I:67;239;He captivates you and hold your attention to the very end.
I:67;240;Very good movie showing the depth of corruption among millionaires and their influence on communities.
I:67;241;Young, but exactly the same Nickolson, I enjoyed it anyway!
I:67;242;The best is yet to come, Jack.
I:67;243;It has everything that you would hope for.
I:67;244;A complicated plot that twists and turns keeping you involved right up to the very end and superb acting by the best in the business.
I:67;245;Excellent crime noire with jack Nicholson at his best.
I:67;246;Everyone should have Two jakes also is worth the watch
I:67;247;A masterpiece with a don't.
I:67;248;Great performances by a stellar cast, including a young Jack Nicholson.
I:67;249;I like thing to turn out well in the end.
I:67;250;That Nicholson swagger and the 1930s suits are unforgettable.
I:67;251;The whole thing looks brilliant .
I:67;252;ray, which really captures the vision Polanski intended.
I:67;253;"And my judgment is this: Chinatown is a great film by a great director, Roman Polanski
I:67;254;the real stuff from which dreams are woven!Nicholson was born to play Private Investigator Jake Gittes.
I:67;255;The film is really about Los Angeles.
I:67;256;It is all so very Hitchcockian.
I:67;257;as well as between the director and the screenwriter, and the director and the leading lady.
I:67;258;You see, Mr. Gitts, most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and the right place, they're capable of ANYTHING.
I:67;259;"Though all the aspects of ""Chinatown"" were top notch, a final 'note' on the soundtrack is in order, pun intended."
I:67;260;"Parts of the score reminded me of ""The Planet of The Apes"" where percussion punctuates the mounting tension."
I:67;261;But in a good way.
I:67;262;The best moments though are the beautiful trumpet solos that were played by Hollywood studio veteran Uan Rasey.
I:67;263;Jack Nicholson is a great actor but watching this shows how far he's come since Chinatown.
I:67;264;Loved the period sets of California.
I:67;265;This is an excellent movie that demonstrates a very fine use of the noir genre and could watch it again and again
I:67;266;A masterpiece in every way: writing, photography, casting, ACTING!
I:67;267;Should have received many Oscars in every category.
I:67;268;Faye Dunaway's most memorable performance.
I:67;269;Enjoyed it very much I would recommend it as a classic to anyone.
I:67;270;Ending was quite a surprise but interesting.
I:67;271;This film will go down as one of the great classics of cinematic history.
I:67;272;Both leads present characters that are totally credible in a plot that engrosses the viewer from beginning to end.
I:67;273;Yes, it is superbly made, the script is a model of tightness, the actors are wonderful, the sense of Santa Ana heat nearly palpable.
I:67;274;What it has consistently been incapable of is transcending popular forms, of giving us something *more* than just a handsome piece of entertainment.
I:67;275;Don't get me wrong, I love detective fiction.
I:67;276;To compensate for genuine insight, Towne and Polanski kink up the story a bit, giving the it the veneer of the new and the specific, while also turning corruption into something safely personal.
I:67;277;Chinatown is posh, sexy entertainment, a very good film to be sure.
I:67;278;As it unabashedly caters to people's prejudices, however, it proves it is far from being a great one.
I:67;279;before some hipster tried to convince you it was one of the greatest films of all time .
I:67;280;Don't get me wrong, it was entertaining and I was engaged from beginning to end, but one of the best film experiences I've ever had it ain't.
I:67;281;All in all, this is definitely a decent movie that's worth seeing, just enter with an open mind and disregard the associated hype.
I:67;282;Roman Polanski's CHINATOWN is a brilliant achievement in film noir.
I:67;283;A collector's MUST and certainly one of the greatest American picture of the seventies.
I:67;284;One of the few movies you can watch over and over and enjoy it as much the lastime as the 1st.
I:67;285;That scene is so well acted out you feel the tension.
I:67;286;I believe this movie was Nicholson's finest hour and certainly one of the best movies ever made.
I:67;287;This was a good movie about water in old Los Angeles.
I:67;288;The plot stil holds up today.
I:67;289;Great that you can get it in prime
I:67;290;'Chinatown' is, without a doubt, the best of Polanski's films This is an exceptionally well.
I:67;291;crafted film with so many layers, and subplots happening that you must watch this film from beginning to end with no interruptions.
I:67;292;jack Nicholson stars as Jake Gittes, a private detective whose main specialty is spying on straying spouses.
I:67;293;What should be a simple case of finding out whether Mr Mulwray is being unfaithful or not begins to resemble an English maze in which Jake finds himself getting deeper and deeper in the middle of.
I:67;294;polanski should have won the Oscar for Best Director for this film surely, but since when have the truly deserving ever won that accolade?
I:67;295;i like many Polanski films.
I:67;296;Brilliant film noir and Roman Polanski once again displays his mastery as a director.
I:67;297;The details down to the credits are phenomenal.
I:67;298;Wonderful pace of suspense . . . and a true work of art.
I:67;299;This film is touted as top s in great cinema for a reason.
I:67;300;its a timeless classic and must for movie buffs!
I:67;301;it also arrived in great condition and a very timely manner.
I:67;302;This is simply one of the finest films EVER made.
I:67;303;It is MY personal favorite film of all time and was judged one of the top 25 best films of all time by the American Film Institute for very good reasons.
I:67;304;First of all, the script is brilliant.
I:67;305;This movie gives the viewer clue after clue along the way.
I:67;306;but absolutely play it a second time a week or so later.
I:67;307;Nicholson deserved the Oscar for this film.
I:67;308;Dunaway was sultry and marvelous.
I:67;309;John Huston was absolutely convincing as Noah Cross, the man with unlimited power and even Diane Ladd, in a minor role as Ida Sessions .
I:67;310;a small time working girl was perfection.
I:67;311;but overall it looks clear, color corrected and clean.
I:67;312;The soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith, although composed in a week, is probably his best score.
I:67;313;this one would be terrific to watch that way.
I:67;314;this film is a MUST have for any fan of film noir and cinematic perfection.
I:67;315;Always great, and now on blu ray!
I:67;316;A classic which will forever be mentioned as a high water mark, is even more enjoyable than ever before.
I:67;317;Chinatown, in my view, is one of those rare movies in which just about everything works.
I:67;318;rate mystery, it's a first.
I:67;319;Some of the things I like about it:1.
I:67;320;Nicholson can be a very dominating actor, and in most of his pictures, regardless of the other stars, I tend to pay attention primarily to him.
I:67;321;But Dunnaway and Huston each balances him out and provides a lot of tension on the screen.
I:67;322;It's something like having a charming grandfather you secretly admire for being such a rogue, and then discovering his enthusiasms include small children.
I:67;323;Nicholson does a great job, I think, because he holds back much of the Jack.
I:67;324;lad stuff he brings to many roles (and to his own life).
I:67;325;The three of them make great dance partners.2.
I:67;326;The look and style of the movie.
I:67;327;(See the same look in Mulholland Falls.)
I:67;328;For me, that clever, almost leering knowledge by Polanski the director of how the scene will be received by the audience is the difference between great style and just violent show.
I:67;329;The final revelation and the recognition that a man as rich and powerful as Noah Cross can do what he wants and get away with it is unsettling.
I:67;330;I felt a wave of sympathy for her and a fading hope that she and her daughter would somehow, with Gittes' help, manage to break free.
I:67;331;And second, that I'd just seen a helluva movie.
I:67;332;dunaway is stunning and nicholson is beautiful (check out his hands).
I:67;333;this is truly a film masterpiece in every way.
I:67;334;it is based on real events in los angeles' history, and that makes it more interesting.
I:67;335;Most of the movies on Prime really blow, so it was nice to watch a good movie for once.
I:67;336;To many people, that's odd but water has always been a precious commodity in southern California.
I:67;337;It's a treat for one's eyes, especially if you love that 1940s look, which I do.
I:67;338;This movie just drips with Los Angeles film noir atmosphere: a rich.
I:67;339;looking piece of cinema with great period detail.
I:67;340;"Here, it's Jack Nicholson getting a ""nose job"" courtesy of some thugs."
I:67;341;"Jack, playing ""Jake Gittes,"" will forever be known (among wild roles) as the guy with a bandage on his nose, thanks to this movie."
I:67;342;As interesting as he is, along with Faye Dunaway and the rest of the cast, I always get a kick out of seeing John Huston in here.
I:67;343;I love the way he sounds and acts, and I'm sorry he had such a short role.
I:67;344;fascinating film no matter how many times you watch it or how well you understand it.
I:67;345;_Chinatown_ is a very nearly perfect gem of a film.
I:67;346;So few detective/mystery stories are ever attempted, largely because of the difficulty of effectively capturing the time period.
I:67;347;And the story is an incredibly layered one, starting with the simple mechanics of what's happening to the diverted water, eventually blowing up into something along the lines of a Greek tragedy.
I:67;348;this was the film that really made Jack Nicholson a star and Faye Dunaway is memorable as Evelyn Mulwray.
I:67;349;John Huston is the perfect embodiment of evil and I love the way he purposely mispronounces Nicholson's character's name.
I:67;350;There are some nice behind the scenes interviews with Roman Polanski, Robert Evans, and Robert Towne, whose screenplay won a well.
I:67;351;A movie full of plot twists and turn in good old LA.
I:67;352;Jack Nicholas is fabulous and keeps the viewer entertained at every turn.
I:67;353;Chinatown is a potent reminder that films are more than just the hormone fueled adventures of Dick and Jane.
I:67;354;Powerful performances by Nicholson (not a fave) and Dunaway frame a beautifully directed drama demonstrataing the power of film.
I:67;355;If you have never seen this film, I highly recommend that you do so.
I:67;356;So, if you own the previous edition is it worth the double dip?
I:67;357;While only running 12 minutes, it was a pretty good trip down memory lane.
I:67;358;These new extras bring back all three men and Jack Nicholson for brand new interviews.
I:67;359;This new disc also has an improved transfer that is a noticeable improvement over the previous edition.
I:67;360;minute retrospective look at the genesis of the film with Evans, Nicholson, Polanski and Towne talking about how they got involved with the project.
I:67;361;Towne talks about several things that inspired his script and how his friendship with Nicholson informed the character of Gittes.
I:67;362;"The studio felt that the film was ""too intellectual"" and the critics loved it."
I:67;363;special features are set to include:*Commentary with Robert Towne and David Fincher.
I:67;364;Towne and Fincher offer unique insights into this classic film.
I:67;365;L. a. Department of Water and Power representatives along with Catherine Mulholland, granddaughter of the engineer, discuss the development of the aqueduct and its contribution to the growth of the nation's second.
I:67;366;Legal victories beginning in the 1970's lead to successful reductions in environmental damages and the restoration of some natural habitats.
I:67;367;Historians, local ranchers and activists discuss the up.
I:67;368;date impacts of the aqueduct and struggle to maintain a stable environment and community.
I:67;369;In this featurette, prominent filmmakers express their personal admiration for the film: Steven Soderbergh .
I:67;370;Director ( Traffic), James Newton Howard .
I:67;371;Composer ( The Dark Knight), Kimberly Peirce .
I:67;372;Chinatown is hands down one of my favorite movies.
I:67;373;Acting, directing, screenplay, everything comes together here.
I:67;374;I pretty much love everything with Jack Nicholson but this one particularly struck me.
I:67;375;I love film noir, and this to me is a great example.
I:67;376;i am not familiar with other editions of Chinatown but this one seems great, and I found the featurettes very interesting.
I:67;377;I am very pleased with the entire experience.
I:67;378;It is a very well made film but the #1 reason I watch a movie is for the story, and I just didn't enjoy it much.
I:67;379;I know this is because of the way it ended but I have liked other movies without the typical happy ending.
I:67;380;I also must admit the acting and directing were great.
I:67;381;This sets up the reminder of the film where Gittes deals with plenty of powerful, corrupt and dangerous people to find out what really happened to Mulwray and why.
I:67;382;the color widescreen presentation is a visual feast for the eyes from start to finish.
I:67;383;The story takes place in 1930's Los Angeles and even for being released in 1974, the attention to detail for making it seem true to that era is utterly amazing.
I:67;384;But the film is still more than a powerful retro.
I:67;385;The acting by the three main characters: Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston is magnificent.
I:67;386;Nicholson's role is one that it seems like we seen dozens of times .
I:67;387;The screenplay also works brilliantly as every scene is fascinating and rarely predictable.
I:67;388;see movie for anyone who appreciates beautifully filmed, well acted pictures.
I:67;389;The stereo sound is also top.
I:67;390;The story was crisp and tense and kept me on the edge of my seat.
I:67;391;(Okay, maybe the music could have been a drop better, but it was still quite good enough.)
I:67;392;so, all in all, although I find Roman Polasnki repugnant as a human being, he has a wildly creative and unique gift as a film director, and I respect that.
I:67;393;This film is a masterpiece of story telling.
I:67;394;Following in Bogart's foot steps Jack Nicholson does a superb job in creating a classic gum shoe detective.
I:67;395;This movie is a great piece film noir.
I:67;396;In my opinion, CHINATOWN is the last masterpiece presented by polish director Roman Polanski.
I:67;397;After this 1973 movie, Polanski will shoot good if not excellent movies that nevertheless won't match such references as REPULSION or CUL.
I:67;398;And, for the most of them, they are growing very old.
I:67;399;He will have to face another Hollywood giant .
I:67;400;Nicholson gives the second best performance of his career (first being One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest), Faye Dunaway is bookishly seductive, and John Huston solidified himself as one of the screen's evilest and sickest movie villains ever.
I:67;401;Instead, he mocks our hopes for a happy ending and slaps us in the face with it's tragic twist.
I:67;402;Indeed a classic and one of the best movies of all time.
I:67;403;winning script by Robert Towne, Polanski crafts an excellent noir set in thirties Los Angeles that evokes the milieu of Chandler and Hammett and also some of the better film noir of the forties.
I:67;404;Jack Nicholson gives an effective performance here as detective Jake Gittes, simultaneous determined and befuddled in his attempts to uncover the truth.
I:67;405;Director Polanski also has a cameo here as a knife.
I:67;406;This is 70s nihilism at its best.
I:67;407;Roman Polanski shows us why he's worthy of being regarded as a great director no matter how much sub.
I:67;408;standard product he turns out, and Nicholson shines in his physical prime.
I:67;409;Robert Townes demonstrates why he is regarded as a superlative screenwriter, although it is important to note that Polanski is responsible for the film's devastating conclusion.
I:67;410;John Huston steals the kid and almost the show.
I:67;411;Good movie to check out.
I:67;412;It is a color picture, its private eye in a man pained by loneliness, its femme fatale might just be the most decent individual in the film, and the scandal deals not with diamonds or other typical noir devices .
I:67;413;but a conspiracy involving water and power.
I:67;414;jack Nicholson stars as Jake Gittes, the private eye at the story's center.
I:67;415;At the time, Nicholson was certainly known, yet he had not quite become `Jack Nicholson' the icon, the personality, the character known for going over the top.
I:67;416;In `Chinatown' Nicholson was able to explore his character, and give a wonderful subtle performance.
I:67;417;Yet as the narrative unfolds, he finds himself more and more incapable of keeping that faade.
I:67;418;the film trusts our intelligence.
I:67;419;What Polanski does here, rather than stopping to bring the viewer up to speed, is simply drop us in the film and allow us to explore for ourselves.
I:67;420;While a great deal of the picture is essentially dialogue, the setting, combined with the actor's facial expressions and gestures, conveys a particular mood.
I:67;421;Polanski does a superior job of interweaving the unfolding scandal and the revelations about the characters' secrets.
I:67;422;`Chinatown' successfully constructs a general emotion as the movie progresses .
I:67;423;Indeed, the ending of `Chinatown' remains as one of the most powerful scenes in the history of movies .
I:67;424;This illustration of helplessness and commotion in the face of powers that we cannot control perfectly articulates sentiments that all of us have encountered.
I:67;425;This is a remake of a classic.
I:67;426;With the cast, costumes, setting, etc. this has become a classic in its on right.
I:67;427;An Oldie but one of my favorites.
I:67;428;Chinatown is one of the great movies of the 20th century.
I:67;429;Good movie I really liked it.
I:67;430;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:67;431;I can remember when it came out, it won all the awards, and you will see why.
I:67;432;I loved the twist and turns, and the gritty old fashion reality of how the plot moves and the characters interact.
I:67;433;Amazing screen play, actors seemingly born for their roles and amazingly well shot.
I:67;434;Watched it and thoroughly enjoyed it.
I:67;435;Great movie that was on Dish Network just months ago.
I:67;436;Five Easy Pieces is another great flick, with Jack Nicholson.
I:67;437;He is a MASTER of the film industry.
I:67;438;His portrayal as a Lawyer fits in this flick.
I:67;439;ray Disc that I ordered yet, but it will be here in a few days.
I:67;440;Godfather II gets the edge as the better of the two, i. e., the best film of our times.
I:67;441;Like Godfather II, its understated script is a model of great writing, advancing the characters and the plot with every word.
I:67;442;Chinatown remains the greatest of film noir by far because it extends the genre's possibilities while still remaining respectful of its traditions.
I:67;443;Polanski's tone and legendary attention to detail are dead.
I:67;444;Cynicism gives way to hope, then to irreversible loss.
I:67;445;In today's 'artistic vision dictated by Hollywood marketing' world, yep.
I:67;446;Acting wise, a brilliant ensemble, even down to a one.
I:67;447;scene cameo by great character actor Charles Knapp as a hacking, engaging mortician.
I:67;448;And it could be Nicholson's best performance ever.
I:67;449;Save for a slight detour in a confrontational barber shop scene (in which he assumes his broad, `rebel Jack' persona), it's easily his most subtle and multi.
I:67;450;"In 1974, director Roman Polanski and writer Robert Towne created a masterpiece, ""Chinatown"", which is regarded as a model for screenwriting novices who wish to study the process."
I:67;451;ray transfer excellently captures the color and decor of this original.
I:67;452;A throwback to the classic film noir detective stories.
I:67;453;Every time I watch this movie I pick up on something new.
I:67;454;'Chinatown' is one of those rare film that is absolutely perfect.
I:67;455;Polanski, along with therest of the cast, handle the story with maturity and precision, the wayit should be.
I:67;456;It may take several viewing to put all the piecestogether, but with each viewing the film becomes more meaningful.
I:67;457;The ending is one of the reasons the film is sopowerful and unforgettable.
I:67;458;It is set in the 1930s, and the city issuffering a major drought.
I:67;459;Jack Nicholsongives one of the great performances of his career.
I:67;460;So few actors can bring such range into their roles.
I:67;461;the film is also carried by its brilliant screenplay.
I:67;462;The screenplayhas been hailed one of the best of all time, and I find that hard toargue.
I:67;463;The dialog is so well written, it is an absolute joy watch timean again.
I:67;464;Graphics can become dates, action sequences can become tame,but good dialog is timeless.
I:67;465;He made the right decision because what he gave us was ascreenplay for the ages.
I:67;466;It is wickedly clever, intelligent, andcynical.
I:67;467;To me, the ending is absolutely brilliant.
I:67;468;It should rank asone of the great endings in film history.
I:67;469;Throughout the film, Jake talks about Chinatown, orhow he doesn't like talking about it.
I:67;470;Attimes in this life, there are forces beyond one's control.
I:67;471;What aphenomenal achievement in film.
I:67;472;My favorite movie of all time.
I:67;473;The film offers an engaging mystery and chilling story that is not complete until the very last sights and sounds in the very last scene.
I:67;474;Great period piece and on my all time favorite list.
I:67;475;I love LA and San Francisco detective movies in the style of Maltese Falcon and Big Sleep.
I:67;476;Chinatown has always been regarded as a true cinema classic.
I:67;477;Full of quotable dialogue, a skewered eye, great performances, excellent camera work, and a great score.
I:67;478;Luckily I found mine for a reasonable price.
I:67;479;The acting and directing are superb in this film.
I:67;480;Making this one of the greatest films ever made about LA.
I:67;481;Jack Nicolson has a great performance in this twisted and mysterious thriller that continues the film noir tradition.
I:67;482;Absolutely engrossing and enchanting look into Los Angeles of the 1930's.
I:67;483;will echo in your consciousness long after the closing title.
I:67;484;One of Hollywood's Ten Best of All Time (my own personal opinion/rating).
I:67;485;This is a beautiful film.
I:67;486;One of the best from the 70's cream.
I:67;487;Dunaway is the mysteriously beautiful femme fatale with the classy icy veneer.
I:67;488;the mystery is complex and demands your attention, but the payoff is beautiful and tragic.
I:67;489;"Many people feel that ""Chinatown"" put Roman Polanski on the map as a directorial force to be reckoned with."
I:67;490;"I feel that honor went to ""Rosemary's Baby"" six years earlier in 1968 and ""Chinatown"" solidified his force."
I:67;491;in any case, the movie's plot has been described numerous times on this page (and those folks can do a bit more justice to it than I) but a potential viewer needs to watch the movie to get the full force of Jack Nicholson's incredible acting, Faye Dunaway's conniving character, even Polanski's cameo as a wise.
I:67;492;cracking gangster who cuts up Nicholson's nose pretty good.
I:67;493;"watching ""Chinatown"" is two hours well invested."
I:67;494;Great stars, great story great writing.
I:67;495;A client named Curly is looking at photos in Jake Giddes' office, photos of his wife making love with another man.
I:67;496;He looks crisp and cool in his white linen suit despite the heat.
I:67;497;Evelyn's beauty is somewhat faded and is all the more magnetic for it, and she reveals throughout the film a desperate honesty that makes you want to take her in your arms and comfort her.
I:67;498;john Houston is a perfect Noah Cross, Evelyn's chillingly pragmatic, super.
I:67;499;nails, but deep inside runs a streak of believable compassion.
I:67;500;the underlying theme of Chinatown is Los Angeles' insatiable thirst for water.
I:67;501;this is screenwriter Robert Towne at his inimitable best.
I:67;502;A rare and expansive look into Towne's brilliant approach to this screenplay can be gained by viewing the PBS video Cadillac Desert (available from Amazon.
I:67;503;chinatown is a classic use of the silver screen.
I:67;504;time classic, no question about it.
I:67;505;The absolute magnetism and deft performance of its emerging star, Jack Nicholson, is no doubt one of its stronger assets.
I:67;506;"While the story is brilliantly unique and quite interesting, it is not exciting, per se
I:67;507;Screenwriter and storyteller Robert Towne's scenes and dialogue are spare but sparkling, as is the cinematography and film editing.
I:67;508;perhaps its greatest asset is its director, Roman Polanski who, with his art and set directors, magically re.
I:67;509;creates Los Angeles as it was in the 30's.
I:67;510;lined street at twilight, or an office bathed in a venetian blind's shadows, Polanski gets a perfect, painterly shot in every frame.
I:67;511;He effortlessly guides all of his actors.
I:67;512;in subtle, but heartfelt performances.
I:67;513;Add to all of this a moody, evocative score and its unforgettable love theme and suddenly the economical becomes expansive, filling the screen with dazzling movie.
I:67;514;The devastatingly powerful last scene is screen legend, rivalled, perhaps, only by Casablanca.
I:67;515;If you want intrigue and the feeling of the beginnings of Los Angeles, this is the movie for you.
I:67;516;This Roman Polanski film is a classic of American film.
I:67;517;It has held up very well, and is both gripping and visually outstanding.
I:67;518;Ok first off I have watched this movie 8 times already and every time I watch it I think of how talented Jack Nicholson is in the roles he plays.
I:67;519;He plays his roles out well always.
I:67;520;I would recommend this film always.
I:67;521;My name is Dan G and a I have been a fan of Nicholson's since I was 4.
I:67;522;Jack Nicholson always plays interesting roles whether he's the villian or hero he's always got mad talent.
I:67;523;Polanski wrote a great script.
I:67;524;The plot is just so clever that it leaves you guessing who's in what for what until the end.
I:67;525;I saw the sequal to Chinatown and loved it as well.
I:67;526;The script is cool sounding and has a nice feel to it.
I:67;527;The characters do their parts well.
I:67;528;Jack made me laugh alot.
I:67;529;He knows how to be touching and assertive and many other things.
I:67;530;As Jake Gittes he really played the part well.
I:67;531;The film really captures those times well.
I:67;532;I give Jack Nicholson thumbs up to this and I clap for him.
I:67;533;Watching it this time reminded me why Jack Nicholson was such a magnetic screen presence in the 70s.
I:67;534;changing face, always on the edge.
I:67;535;The whole production, from the great producer Robert Evans, screenwriter Robert Towne, director Roman Polanski, DP John Alonzo (in theaters, this film sometimes looked almost sickly thanks to Alonzo's subtle yellow/gold tones and slightly overbright sunlit scenes), Goldsmith's score, the exceptional casting, and on, and on.
I:67;536;The cinematography and art direction is enought to drool over, and Nicholson's and particularly Dunaway's performance are perfect examples flawless dedication to characterization.
I:67;537;i cannot express enough in words how important it is for a person to go out and at least put effort into seeing this timeless masterpiece.
I:67;538;It is Polanski's crowning achievement, and to this day I am baffled that it recieved only one Oscar (guess for which category), and the fact that John Huston's menacing performance was not even a contender in the supporting actor category.
I:67;539;nevertheless, a gem in Classic Cinema and perhaps the best film noir ever concieved.
I:67;540;There are nice documentary extras, but a commentary from Jack or Robert Towne would have been really sweet.
I:67;541;certainly none of the performances.
I:67;542;key yet dynamic he is here.
I:67;543;He's completely sensational, partly because his take on the 30s private detective is so original and distinctive.
I:67;544;the point of view is Jake's all the way through .
I:67;545;But Polanski's gives two minute glimpses into Cross' and Evelyn's perspective when they're each at lunch with Gittes and the effect is startling.
I:67;546;Jack Nicholson in his prime, Faye Dunaway and John Huston together with a top notch supporting cast and great writers.
I:67;547;If the movie teaches us nothing less, it's that the world can often (and almost always is) against us.
I:67;548;in short, this is simply a great movie that deserved a lot more recognition than it received.
I:67;549;Every aspect is absolutely top shelf!
I:67;550;Nicholson is a good replacement for Bogart, and the story moves well.
I:67;551;I enjoyed the old cars and clothes.
I:67;552;"best film (in spite of his recent and amazingly first Oscar win for ""The Pianist""), Roman Polanski made a neo."
I:67;553;noir masterpiece in 1974 full of elaborate plot twists, morally ambiguous characters and moody, authentic.
I:67;554;"winning ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", Jack Nicholson was on a career."
I:67;555;laden career, this is my favorite of his performances probably because he plays the role so against expectation.
I:67;556;Bogart has so clearly etched the world.
I:67;557;best performance as well, Faye Dunaway is picture.
I:67;558;perfect as Evelyn with her pencil eyebrows, iron.
I:67;559;shingled coiffure and cool aura of heightened glamour and deceit.
I:67;560;The surprising element to her character is that she looks so right as a femme fatale, and yet she exposes herself as a much more complex person full of emotional scars and trembling self.
I:67;561;depth understanding of the genre allows Huston to imbue Cross with the right spirit, enabling him to essay the part perfectly .
I:67;562;diverting the water back to the valley, so the property becomes fertile and the price skyrockets.
I:67;563;Of course, the disclosure of her identity becomes the point of one of cinema's most unforgettable confrontation scenes between Jake and Evelyn.
I:67;564;All the period flavor is impeccable from John A. Alonzo's burnished gold.
I:67;565;hued cinematography to Jerry Goldsmith's moody, insinuating musical score to W. Stewart Campbell's spot.
I:67;566;A monumental achievement strongly recommended.
I:67;567;Twists and turns keep you guessing.
I:67;568;A really great story and good actors and especially like the fact that it is PG13.
I:67;569;This is a great suspenseful drama.
I:67;570;This is a wonderful film, a man who dreams invade toiset.
I:67;571;One of my favorites of all time . . . the setting, acting and super story.
I:67;572;Would recommend to anyone who likes movies of the 1930s and love of cars . . . the yellow packard.
I:67;573;Nicholson, Dunaway, Huston, Polanski, Towne, Evans, and Goldsmith at the top of their game.
I:67;574;One of the best movies ever made.
I:67;575;put this holds up verryyy welll.
I:67;576;hi see this 2009 edition for chinatown, I see the reviews and are reviews from other editions.
I:67;577;please DONT MIX THE REVIEWS!!!!!!!!!!
I:67;578;There a lot of featurettes about the making of the film and an audio commentary with Robert Towne and David Fincher.
I:67;579;This movie really does get better as the years go by.
I:67;580;This is not my first choice for a relaxing evening at home, but the hubby loves it so I bought it for him.
I:67;581;He can watch it in the basement while I watch HGTV or a cooking show on another TV.
I:67;582;I pretty much overall enjoyed the movie Chinatown.
I:67;583;I thought the plot was pretty well.
I:67;584;I especially enjoyed the character and how he never stopped trying to find out what was going on.
I:67;585;Roman Polanski's genius is questionable.
I:67;586;Now although it is not completely justifiable to prove whether Polanski is or is not a genius, it is rather important to discuss the life of this idolized and wanted man.
I:67;587;He had a beautiful, talented, and adoring wife.
I:67;588;chinatown flows with a lavishly perfected Noir tone, and I should add here, the film is the Neo Noir archetype, the best of its kind and one of the best that Film Noir carries in its respective canon.
I:67;589;Not before, and not since, has pacing been so well thought out, so marvelously calculated, and devilishly crafted.
I:67;590;Robert Towne's script is simply impeccable.
I:67;591;Flawless storytelling accompanied by snappy dialogue, and a climax that cuts deeper than that of documentary reality.
I:67;592;but it is Polanski who is the true star of this picture.
I:67;593;You can see him in every shot, peering in through the lens, and directly into your heart.
I:67;594;It is there, in the tragedy, he dares you to hope for the best, he wants to feel safe because films make you feel comfortable.
I:67;595;He leaves you in pain.
I:67;596;Knowing that tragedy is the most universal of luxuries, Polanski makes that perfectly clear, and for the first time, his voice is heard, his war cry.
I:67;597;while Rosemary's Baby is my favorite Polanski film, Chinatown has always been a close second.
I:67;598;A film this important should be treated as such.
I:67;599;In sparkling clear and colorful film noir, we see Robert Towne's masterful story acted by a stupendous cast of performers, none of whom has ever been better.
I:67;600;Ace detective Jake Gittes is on the trail of a murdered water commissioner whose wife has her own series of mysteries she's covering.
I:67;601;fashion, the plot is labyrinthine on first viewing, but it all flows together beautifully once the resolution is presented and one has a chance to review all the twists and turns.
I:67;602;All the better to hear Jerry Goldsmith's mournfully brilliant score.
I:67;603;Nicholson is as always fantastic and Chinatown is one of his best as the private detective who respects the law but doesn't want to be hindered by formal legalities to get what we wants.
I:67;604;More significantly what I liked about the film was the detail of the period in the clothing styles that were worn, the cars and even the furnishings of the offices and houses all seemed to be authentic for the era which added greatly to my immersion in this film.
I:67;605;Chinatown is a classic in the original sense.
I:67;606;It's brooding and often dark plot offer's a real treat for any fan of film noir.
I:67;607;This is, perhaps, one of Jack Nicholson's greatest film roles.
I:67;608;"Nicholson parallels Bogart here and Dunaway does Astor and ironically John Huston, the director of the ""Maltese Falcon"" has an acting role here."
I:67;609;Chinatown does a great job in bringing the noir genre into the colour.
I:67;610;age and does so very well by incorporating the best of the old black and white films into the more modern film making elements of the time.
I:67;611;"This film has gone on to influence even more modern films like ""The Black Dahlia"" and ""L. a. Confidential"" and its theme of corrupt police and their evil rich backers who get away with anything with an excellent plot and great acting by Dunaway, Huston and Nicholson make this a great film to watch."
I:67;612;I absolutely loved the time period of this movie, the water war for Los Angeles, the actors .
I:67;613;The plot had good mystery that keeps you wondering what will happen next and how it will all turn out.
I:67;614;Being a film noir movie, you know someone is going to die in the end, but this keeps you guessing until the last minute.
I:67;615;Love the storyline and the acting.
I:67;616;Jack Nicholson is a superb actor.
I:67;617;Bandages, bleeding, and healing process as movie progressed made the movie and character believable.
I:67;618;This is story telling at its best.
I:67;619;I love the action and the surprises.
I:67;620;If you're looking for strange and unsettling, the last half of this movie delivers.
I:67;621;This is one of the all time great mysteries, perhaps the most superb of all the neo.
I:67;622;, but nevertheless, it is brilliantly written, brilliantly acted, and brilliantly directed.
I:67;623;The original is visually gorgeous .
I:67;624;I still remember the subtle use of color from when I first saw the film, the beautiful pinks and blues and yellows playing against the cool neutrals.
I:67;625;The rich darks giving gorgeous contrast.
I:67;626;And I remember the perfect LA light.
I:67;627;This is a Hollywood masterpiece, and deserved great love and care in its restoration.
I:67;628;rate script (an opinion which I will, no doubt, be criticized for, since it won Best Screenplay).
I:67;629;"the AFI did a pretty good job in compiling their Top 10 Mysteries list, but as far as I'm concerned, ""Chinatown"" is the joker in the pack."
I:67;630;"I highly recommend that all mystery lovers watch the movies on this list (the movies are, in order: ""Vertigo"", ""Chinatown"", ""Rear Window"", ""Laura"", ""The Third Man"", ""The Maltese Falcon"", ""North by Northwest"", ""Blue Velvet"", ""Dial M for Murder"" and ""The Usual Suspects""), but perhaps save ""Chinatown"" until last."
I:67;631;I can tell that statement is the truth.
I:67;632;From themes like money and power having great influence over institutions.
I:67;633;I am happy to experience both.
I:67;634;I watch China town twice and also gave terriers mutiple viewings.
I:67;635;I hope that this brand storytelling has bigger future in next couple of decades.
I:67;636;Corruption and wealth meet an unrelenting gumshoe, and the results make for an unforgettable movie experience.
I:67;637;Legendary actors and actress in a fabled city entwined in a 'clash of cultures' combine to produce a monumental movie!
I:67;638;Excellent viewing at many levels.
I:67;639;Those with power abuse it and deny the rest their rights while they swindle them out of their property with the help and colusion of politians
I:67;640;Experiencing older Hollywood films, films made in the era when script, direction, cinematography, lighting, musical scoring and acting became melded together in an intricate but cohesive escapist adventure, is like visiting a fine art museum .
I:67;641;Using the inimitable Jack Nicholson as the smart and daring private detective who pries open a conspiracy in the family of John Huston and his daughter Faye Dunaway whose private life secret is as huge as the water stealing crimes that are at the basis of the story was a stroke of genius that has rarely been matched since.
I:67;642;And tying all of this together with one of Jerry Goldsmith's finest musical scores and cinematography that is liquid and redolent of the wastes that were the at the core of Los Angeles' prostitution of sunlight and shadow .
I:67;643;was part of Polanski's genius for direction.
I:67;644;for viewing an example of the finest in filmmaking, CHINATOWN remains at the top of the list.
I:67;645;stream from Water and Power, to the daughter.
I:67;646;A good movie, but a great one?
I:67;647;entertainment value counts for a lot with me.
I:67;648;the tone of the film was certainly something of an acheivement.
I:67;649;Amazing cast, locations, direction, cinematography.
I:67;650;ray conversion is lovely and rich, even though a few scenes seemed a bit grainy.
I:67;651;Fincher comes off as a smart.
I:67;652;well done and very much worth the bargain price of $18.99
I:67;653;Jack Nicholson delivers captivating performance.
I:67;654;Femme fetal role of leading lady was powerful and very seductive with a slice of evil thrown in.
I:67;655;The storyline is not merely unexpected, the complexity is amazing.
I:67;656;Faye Dunaway is flawless and jack Nicholson.
I:67;657;"Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston star in ""Chinatown,"" a movie filled with intrigue, suspense and drama."
I:67;658;"All these ingredients make for great cinema and ""Chinatown"" delivers on all cylinders."
I:67;659;Huston's role is really more of a cameo, but he acquits himself well as always.
I:67;660;Jack is one of my favorite actors.
I:67;661;This is one of those movies that you can always look forward to watching again.
I:67;662;Chinatown is a bizarre and intriguing story set in L. a. where a private eye (Jack Nicholson) will discover an awful drama behind all the corruption atmosphere you can brathe in this story .
I:67;663;Faye Dunaway is excellent as the femme fatale who hides her secret .
I:67;664;this movie was the legacy given for Polanski to the universal cinema .
I:67;665;Solid and arresting from beginning to end.
I:67;666;it won the the Academy Award as best screenplay.
I:67;667;Nicholson is absolutely perfect as the private detective, Jake Gittes, in this period piece.
I:67;668;Faye Dunaway and Walter Huston are also first rate in their roles as a woman in distress and her evil father.
I:67;669;The plot will keep you guessing right up until the end, when things finally become clear.
I:67;670;The costumes and settings are so spot on you'll feel as though you are actually back in LA in the early 20th century.
I:67;671;The story is told under the firm hand of Roman Polanski and will leave you wanting more when the story ends.
I:67;672;I love the way it slowly takes shape, actually taking time to develop characters and use the supporting actors.
I:67;673;Also, the chemistry between Mr. Gittes and Noah Cross is awesome (especially given Jack's real life interest in John Huston's daughter).
I:67;674;The story moved slowly and then picked up steam, necessitating a quick ending.
I:67;675;The film is a classic.
I:67;676;Chinatown is one of the best film i've ever seen.
I:67;677;modern film like Chinatown, the picture and sound is at their best.
I:67;678;It has just a few extra.
I:67;679;I found a lot of fun on them.
I:67;680;For now, it's at its best deal.
I:67;681;This is simply one of the best detective story ever made and Jerry Goldsmith's sound track ( which I also own) is probaby the best sound track.
I:67;682;Jack , Faye and John are at their best.
I:67;683;Great movie, and I'm glad I didn't read the plot synopsis on this page, or it would have spoiled the entire movie for me.
I:67;684;That's probably the best part of this film.
I:67;685;So better change them than expect them to change.
I:67;686;ray lent it an aura that made it as enjoyable as the first time.
I:67;687;Huston is my favorite director, bar none.
I:67;688;After I saw it made the AFI Top 100 Films I thought I'd watch it.
I:67;689;loner private eye with a mysterious past, a damsel in distress that's also on the dangerous side, plot twists, mysterious secondary characters and an ultimate goal.
I:67;690;Jack Nicholson as J. j. Gittes delivers a great performance.
I:67;691;But I was truly impressed by his performance in this movie.
I:67;692;We see the movie from his vantage point so he is always on the screen.
I:67;693;Polanski's directing style really draws you into the plot .
I:67;694;you are there with Jake, experiencing everything he experiences.
I:67;695;It's truly a great directing job.
I:67;696;It is a great way to spend an evening.
I:67;697;Who would have guessed you could make a compelling movie about the role water played in the development of the L. A. basin.
I:67;698;One of the things I like best is that Jack Nicholson is no superman.
I:67;699;He engages in the conflict because he is convinced he is in the right.
I:67;700;A favorite character in the movie for me is the county coroner.
I:67;701;Who ever the actor is he steals the scene.
I:67;702;This is a terrific movie.
I:67;703;Even my 16 year old son loved it.
I:67;704;Nicholson and Faye Dunaway are phenomenal in this.
I:67;705;I saw it first many years ago and it was worth it to see it again.
I:67;706;I hadn't ever seen this movie and I loved it.
I:67;707;I recently bought the movie The Two Jakes because I liked this movie so much.
I:67;708;Great acting, dialog, directing, action, mystery, and a kicker at the end.
I:67;709;It deserves the kudos it received.
I:67;710;and it has terrific antecedents (see: Maltese Falcon , Double Indemnity .
I:67;711;motif),and as inevitable as gravity.
I:67;712;gazer, Nicholson is your everyman.
I:67;713;just a bit bigger than life.
I:67;714;It's Chinatown.A haunting, sordid, beautiful film.
I:67;715;"i'm young enough so that the Jack Nicholson I grew up with was from ""The Shining"" onward."
I:67;716;I always admired his charisma, but it wasn't until I watched this film that I grasped what an amazingly subtle and powerful actor he actually was in his prime.
I:67;717;the rest of the cast also rises to the occasion, the script is crisp, hard.
I:67;718;boiled and full of memorable lines.
I:67;719;not to be overlooked by any means is the movie's evocative and memorable score, which sets the perfect tone of film noir at the beginning, and adds unforgettable impact to the movie's tragic ending.
I:67;720;I have seen this movie several times and always have to be reminded of the relationship between Faye Dunaway and John Huston.
I:67;721;Anyone who has studied the history of how LA gets its water will see the implications in this movie story line.
I:67;722;Chinatown is a superb film noir and one of the landmark films of the 1970s.
I:67;723;The script by Robert Towne (winner of the Oscar for best original screenplay for 1974) is justly famous as perhaps the best screenplay ever written in Hollywood.
I:67;724;This is not only a superior detective story but one of the most incisive studies of the morality of the American ruling class ever committed to film.
I:67;725;Truly, Roman Polanski's best film with great performances by Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway (both Oscar nominated) and John Huston in a memorable turn as the face of evil.
I:67;726;One of the top ten films of all time, the top as far as I'm concerned.
I:67;727;With perfect rhythm this film is beautiful and literally has nothing wrong with it.
I:67;728;"just a note from a technical perspective: my release (2007's ""Special Collector's Edition"") is very nice in terms of picture and sound."
I:67;729;Conversely, I prefer the cover art of the even older 1999release.
I:67;730;Instead you will be wondering how the direction, script, acting, score, costumes, lighting, and everything else came together so perfectly.
I:67;731;If you ever want to see Jack Nicholson in a good protagonist role, check this movie out.
I:67;732;You get a great movie made in the classic style of the 1930s, as well as an in.
I:67;733;depth documentary which includes interviews with Roman Polanski (director), Robert Towne (writer), and Robert Evans (producer).
I:67;734;The acting and story are wonderful.
I:67;735;The subject matter is intense, especially considering the era of the movie plot, an d the actual era of filming.
I:67;736;Photography, plot twists, story line and the acting are all first rate.
I:67;737;Very good movie, but so intense you really need to pay attention to appreciate all it offers!
I:67;738;Great acting and worthy of the Oscars it received.
I:67;739;Probably the last great film noir movie in my opinion, its also a faboulous mystery and detective story.
I:67;740;This film is a timely classic that will leave you wanting to see it over and over again.
I:67;741;Though it had a good twist.
I:67;742;i had to watch this movie for film class and loved every minute of it.
I:67;743;Lots of twist and turns that all get solve by the end of the film.
I:67;744;the ending is magnificent (minus the gratuitous violence) for its reflection on capital, power, the police.
I:67;745;also a snapshot of a very specific los angeles moment.
I:67;746;wrenching and suspenseful movies I have ever seen.
I:67;747;Dunaway is also good, and it's good to see John Huston is one of his last roles and few in front of the camera rather than behind.
I:67;748;so someone else has to be at the Oscars in his place, thank you very much.
I:67;749;It does look a bit dated, but the production values are good.
I:67;750;It's a modern tribute to the film noir movies of the 1930's and 1940's, and it is done very well.
I:67;751;on pretty much everyone's list of the top 100 movies ever made .
I:67;752;I originally saw this film in a giant, single screen grand theatre back in 1974, before the attack of the multi.
I:67;753;"and I like breathing through it."""
I:67;754;Chinatown was dissected and it was much more in depth.
I:67;755;"To me, this is one of the ""little things"" that make this film a classic."
I:67;756;This one is better in every way.
I:67;757;The picture is razor sharp, to the point that Faye Dunaway's penciled eyebrows are visible in every scene!
I:67;758;And the sound is spectacular, you'd almost think the movie was engineered as a Sound System Movie, which it wasn't.
I:67;759;Amazing that Goldsmith wrote this score in 9 days.
I:67;760;The extras are comprehensive as well, including an detailed history of the first California aqueduct and the L. a. owens Valley water wars.
I:67;761;really appreciated Faye Dunaway's performance this time and the ending is still chilling as evil continues to trump good intentions.
I:67;762;Good dialogue and intricate plot.
I:67;763;This is my favorite movie of all time.
I:67;764;Much better than the sequel.
I:67;765;This movie has more twists and turns than a L. a. Freway.
I:67;766;Great noir film, Jack Nicholson is at his finest.
I:67;767;This mystery thriller kept me on the edge of my seat.
I:67;768;One of Nicholson's best roles.
I:67;769;"Cynical, brooding, and knotted with mystery, Polanski's ""Chinatown"" is not just one of the best films ever made about the City of Angels, earning a dozen Oscar nominations."
I:67;770;it's also one of the most superbly crafted, post.
I:67;771;The cast, of course, can't be beat: Dunaway is at once jittery, seductive and impenetrable, while Jack is at the top of his game as the Chandleresque former cop Jake.
I:67;772;life legendary director John Huston also delivers a titanic performance as the arrogant Cross.
I:67;773;Watch for Polanski himself as a knife.
I:67;774;Roman Polanski's genius, classic film noir.
I:67;775;The screenplay is widely regarded as one of the greatest ever.
I:67;776;Fantastic performances by Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Huston and many other wonderful actors, plus a memorable cameo by Polanski himself.
I:67;777;so the movie has great heart.
I:67;778;In evoking a period, during a time when period authenticity was not a prized commodity, the movie excels.
I:67;779;Faye Dunaway is wonderful, but occasionally betrays a more 70s sensibility than her character would manifest.
I:67;780;Chinatown, Godfather 1 and 2, and Network are not only the best movies of the 1970s.
I:67;781;i think they're the best of all time.
I:67;782;One of the finest scripts ever penned, attached to a wonderful score by Jerry Goldsmith and top.
I:67;783;This movie is so good, the acting is so believable that you have the feeling that you are watching a real investigation, that you are really following the work of the detective day by day, that you are part of the investigation.
I:67;784;That's how good this movie is.
I:67;785;And for less than 10$ it's a really good deal.
I:67;786;I totally agree with most film critics that this american film noir is a true classic.
I:67;787;No need for special effects to make this one of the best american films of the century.
I:67;788;Great actors, script, and direction.
I:67;789;Very good film noir technique.
I:67;790;"Oscar Winning director Roman Polanski's (Best Director, 'The Pianist') ""Chinatown,"" is a complete, undisputed masterpiece from the great director."
I:67;791;The movie is number 19 on The American Film Institute's Top 100 and won the 1974 Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.
I:67;792;Pulp Fiction, Taxi Driver, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Fargo, Unforgiven are some of my favorite films), but I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would.
I:67;793;Three time Oscar winner Jack Nicholson plays Jake Gittes, a private eye and former cop working in Los Angeles.
I:67;794;After investigating the man, who works really high up at the Water Company, he discovers that the man appears to be having an affair and the pictures end up in the newspaper.
I:67;795;That's right, this film is 32 years old.
I:67;796;This movie is very influential.
I:67;797;But it's also entertaining and genuinely surprising.
I:67;798;Nicholson and Dunaway give some of their best performances and the dialogue is spectacular.
I:67;799;Polanski is a very talented director when it comes to making audiences feel tension.
I:67;800;"Roger Ebert put it best ""The whole movie is a tour."
I:67;801;Which is very very true.
I:67;802;This is one of the best films I've ever seen and any film buff should agree with me.
I:67;803;Chinatown's legendary screenplay by Robert Towne was brought to life by director Roman Polanski and producer Robert Evans, all of them feuding famously.
I:67;804;A very good movie well done.
I:67;805;I enjoy a good mystery type of movie and will probably see it again soon.
I:67;806;I had the pleasure of watching this film one shot at a time during the Virginia Film Festival.
I:67;807;It was a great way to watch this particular film .
I:67;808;Aside from this movie's unforgettable visual elements (and some of those frames we stopped on are now ingrained in my brain), Chinatown has one of the most compelling and original plotlines of any serious drama I've ever seen.
I:67;809;"anyhoo, if you liked this, you should probably check out Polanski's new one, ""The Pianist."""
I:67;810;Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway put in great performances and John Houston as the pedophile old power broker is great.
I:67;811;One of Jack's great performances.
I:67;812;Yes, the movie is a classic.
I:67;813;I was pleased to find this and the pricing was good.
I:67;814;The story is fine, but Jake, Nicholson's character, figures it out about halfway into the show.
I:67;815;I fully recommend those I mentioned above, though.
I:67;816;And if you want a new take on film noir that is truly worthy of the genre, take a look at L. a. Confidential.
I:67;817;Note the MPAA Rating for EVERYTHING but it is one of our favorites of the category.
I:67;818;developed, and the acting is superb!
I:67;819;The true history of the California water fights bring realism to this excellent movie!
I:67;820;A movie that will have you guessing and your heart racing.
I:67;821;A timeless classic you will want to see again.
I:67;822;an American film that pulls aside the curtain to reveal disturbing .
I:67;823;This is an excellent film.
I:67;824;If you are a person who loves great screenplays, then CHINATOWN will have you wrapped up in it's perfect little web of intrigue.
I:67;825;but if you are a movie fan who values characters and plot done well, then CHINATOWN IS the perfect screenplay brought to the screen with the perfect actors and perfect direction AND IT IS A WHOPPING SUCCESS!!!
I:67;826;After knowing what happened in California a few years back concerning the electrical blackouts, this film was all the more compelling for a 2007 viewing.
I:67;827;the ending is pure genius and pure reality!
I:67;828;that it's a great film.
I:67;829;the cast is great, the production is great, the music is great.
I:67;830;This might have been the best film to be seen from director Roman Polanski and it might have been one of the best scripts from writer Robert Towne.
I:67;831;Chinatown has one of the best musical scores for film ever.
I:67;832;Chinatown's score like the one for Lawrence has precisely the right notes and precisely the right feel at precisely the right time.
I:67;833;The prepared piano sounds are at once novel and intriguing.
I:67;834;There are also some wooden deliveries but right after you encounter something like that you get to see a great scene from classic film, so you really can't lose!So I guess all in all the word for it still has to be GREAT!
I:67;835;A good who done it .
I:67;836;Fun to see Dunaway and Nicholson in their younger days, in an original movie.
I:67;837;This is a great film and I loved every minute of the movie.
I:67;838;Nicholson is terrific as usual and the balance of the cast is superb.
I:67;839;They did a wonderful job.
I:67;840;Chinatown has been my favorite film since first seeing it seven years ago.
I:67;841;this film succeeds on every asthetic and entertainment level imaginable.
I:67;842;The mood, characterizations, and pacing are outstanding.
I:67;843;It stands as a hallmark of modern filmmaking, unparallelled.
I:67;844;i keep wanting to write more and more about this film I adore so much, but the highest praise cannot do justice to this movie.
I:67;845;Not everyone will enjoy it.
I:67;846;Each moment draws you into the story, like a hypnotic trance, and then the ending is as unnerving as anything ever put on celluloid.
I:67;847;"i encourage everyone to see several, mandatory films
I:67;848;It carries a similar style with similar themes and is from the same era, the 70's.
I:67;849;What a stunningly sweet transfer.
I:67;850;Chinatown has been one of my favorite films since seeing it as a kid with my old man when it came out, and after watching it a dozen times over the years last night's viewing on blu.
I:67;851;The colors are gorgeous and the anamorphic widescreen is letterboxed as it should be, with Polanski's superb compositional skill highlighted to grand effect.
I:67;852;Add over an hour of excellent interviews with Jack, Robert Towne, Bob Evans and Roman and you've got a true gift for any fan of this fabulous flick, and there's lots of us.
I:67;853;I love the best noirs as much as anything Hollywood ever did, and this is as good as the Maltese Falcon and Double Indemnity to my eyes and ears, and those are two of the finest films ever made.
I:67;854;subtle truths about government and police corruption, and the overall effect.
I:67;855;It's pure noir in all the best ways, especially its willingness to tell the truths we never like hearing about how we let our society be run by the greediest and most ruthlessly immoral people.
I:67;856;and Goldmsith's magnificent score never sounded better.
I:67;857;The sound remaster is excellent and the dymamic range is as it should be, loud but never forcing you to jump for the remote during the loud bits.
I:67;858;He scored the whole picture in nine days!
I:67;859;Now that's genius, as this is one of the finest atmospheric scores you'll ever hear, on par with Herrmann and Morricone at their best, and that's perfection.
I:67;860;chinatown is about as good as Hollywood ever got, and this blu.
I:67;861;ray highlights that fact in all the best ways.
I:67;862;But having time for breaks and the splendid color and definition of Blu.
I:67;863;This is film noir in color and harkens back to an earlier era of movie making.
I:67;864;I just love the movie.
I:67;865;from a production standpoint the movie is perfect.
I:67;866;story is solid with good twists and red herrings.
I:67;867;the dream of living it and the opportunities overwhelm and excite.
I:67;868;chinaTown is the best BORING movie you will ever see, but probably not twice.
I:67;869;Add to that the true story of water in LA in the 30s and you have a great movie.
I:67;870;I had never seen this before and had always wanted to, glad I got to see it.
I:67;871;The classic continues to shine.
I:67;872;A thoughtful movie that excites without special effects or gratuitous actions.
I:67;873;"The movie is fleshed out with familiar elements: the backstage powerbroker who has a thirst for water, land and, (above all), control
I:67;874;"eye J. J. Gittes provides us with the hallmark rakish charm and unforgettable gumshoe dialog, (""Mrs. Mulwray, I damn near lost my nose."
I:67;875;"faye Dunaway radiates the perfect mixture of strength and vulnerability as Mrs. Mulwray
I:67;876;john Houston as Noah Cross is one of the most compelling villains in cinema history.
I:67;877;this cinematic gem employs a host of memorable secondary characters .
I:67;878;This movie is a lesson in great filmmaking.
I:67;879;In the Raymond Chandler tradition, Jack Nicholson portrays an excellent spin.
I:67;880;Faye Dunaway provides the romantic lure angle.
I:67;881;good entertainment value for this genre.
I:67;882;Chinatown is an amazing piece of film that grows richer as it grows older.
I:67;883;It was nominated for 11 Oscars, only winning one for Robert Towne's Best Original Screenplay.
I:67;884;John Alonzo, who was nominated for Best Cinematography, sets a sheen and sparkle to the vintage look of the film.
I:67;885;The soundtrack is also brilliant.
I:67;886;"While Chinatown"" did not do well @ the Oscars, it was the Golden Globe winner for Best Drama and also brought Roman Polanski a Best Director Golden Globe award."
I:67;887;"Roman Polanski has done many classics including his other Oscar nominations as Best Director forRosemary's Baby& ""Tess"" to his 2002 Oscar win forThe Pianist."
I:67;888;Chinatown's detractors say that the pacing is slow, but I find that it builds intensity as each piece of the puzzle is revealed and somehow doesn't fit or indicates that there is more to the puzzle.
I:67;889;"Nicholson brought home the Golden Globe as Best Actor but lost the Oscar to surprise winner Art Carney forHarry and Tontoin a field that also had Al Pacino for ""Godfather Part II,"" Dustin Hoffman for ""Lenny"" and ""Albert Finney in ""Murder on the Orient Express."""
I:67;890;As Gittes, we watch Nicholson twist and squirm.
I:67;891;faye Dunaway received her second Oscar nomination for this film.
I:67;892;Her performance is incredibly controlled, but throbbing with the underlying secrets of her past and conditioned by the opulence of her wealth.
I:67;893;John Huston's legendary career is reflected in the shadow of his presence on screen as the family patriarch Noah Cross.
I:67;894;Perry Lopez plays detective Lou Escobar in his most memorable film.
I:67;895;Chinatown picks us up and carries us through to the ending, surprising with twists and turns.
I:67;896;As my title suggests, the soundtrack for this film is stunning.
I:67;897;On top of that is a captivating performance by a young Jack Nicholson that is complimented well by the devilishly seductive Faye Dunaway.
I:67;898;Definitely a must see for those in love with the Film Noir genre.
I:67;899;Well done, suspensful, Jack Nicholson was great.
I:67;900;Includes a little history as well as well as great story.
I:67;901;Great storyline and fine acting.
I:67;902;the ending:So RP sets us up to believe that they are going to escape to Mexico, but in reality she heroine gets shot and probably dies, her father wins .
I:67;903;Ok, that's a nice unexpected cruel twist to the end, but what did happen to their ride to Mexico?
I:67;904;I saw CHINATOWN when it was first released, and to this day it is a film that comes to mind whenever I talk to other film buffs.
I:67;905;The storyline, the musical score, and especially the actors chosen for the film.
I:67;906;This movie is masterfully done, has terrific acting, a great villain, a number of genuine surprises, and a stunning ending that haunts you.
I:67;907;He is perfectly believable in a very eerie role.
I:67;908;He is charming, menacing, and nuts, all at the same time.
I:67;909;this movie benefited greatly by having a non.
I:67;910;This is an extremely intelligent film with some hard hitting surprises.
I:67;911;Hey, when things get this bad, it helps to laugh.
I:67;912;In short the Best Movie ever made.
I:67;913;This is Jack Nicholson at his finest peak.
I:67;914;This 1974 film takes the classic film noir detective movie to new heights.
I:67;915;But yet Jack Nicholson, cast as a private eye, is a sympathetic character.
I:67;916;She's beautiful, of course, and it's hard to take our eyes off of her.
I:67;917;And by the time her secret is revealed, she's won everyone's heart.
I:67;918;based on a real life scandal in Los Angeles in 1908, another underlying theme is about water and power in this desert city.
I:67;919;The action takes place in the 1930s, and the details of that period of time are well portrayed, right down to Faye Dunaway's shaved and penciled eyebrows.
I:67;920;The screenplay won an Academy Award and I can understand why.
I:67;921;It was tightly written and revealed details that moved the plot forward at just the right pace.
I:67;922;He's a fine actor and his presence on the screen added depth to the whole production.
I:67;923;This added to my enjoyment of the film and provided further insight about its production.
I:67;924;I love film noir movies.
I:67;925;Chinatown is set in Los Angeles in the 30s, and features a great cast including Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway.
I:67;926;It earned spot 20 on the AFI top list.
I:67;927;there's a great plot here, with twists and weaves.
I:67;928;The dialogue is snappy and offers many layers.
I:67;929;Great hollywood movie, good story and good acting all in one.
I:67;930;I can watch it 100 times like it is the first time.
I:67;931;As the extras show you, this was a dramatic encapsulation of a very complex issue involving southern California.
I:67;932;But it is beautifully done, with the layers peeling away, leaving more layers to discover.
I:67;933;Horrific end is so well handled.
I:67;934;Faye Dunaway and the other stars are magnificent in this movie.
I:67;935;It has all the classic elements of detective and suspense movies, but better.
I:67;936;The whole film creates its own special atmosphere that really digs into your mind.
I:67;937;Nicholson and Dunaway's acting is unbelieveable, and the plot has so many twists and surprises you can call off all bets.
I:67;938;See it, for a real cinematic experience.
I:67;939;perfectly made and perfectly cast!
I:67;940;An interesting history of the curvilinear development of Los Angeles .
I:67;941;Chinatown is a fantastic private eye mystery thriller, filmed in 1974 and directed by Roman Polanski.
I:67;942;It is classic film nor in color.
I:67;943;Chinatown has become a classic movie now, and is still spellbinding.
I:67;944;Many parts of the movie still ring true on the water wars and riches of the West.
I:67;945;He starts uncovering layers and layers of secrets .
I:67;946;this movie deserves to be in the best top ten movies ever made.
I:67;947;Wanted to see it because so many screenplay classes hold it up as a great example of how to write a screenplay!
I:67;948;Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway, great chemistry.
I:67;949;This film noir about a woman with a terrible secret is great.
I:67;950;A truly well done period piece that's yet another period piece.
I:67;951;Young Jack and Faye are superb.
I:67;952;The item was carefully packaged and shipped as well.
I:67;953;We certainly recommend this seller!
I:67;954;I also enjoyed the two Jakes the sequel maybe even the prequel to this flick.
I:67;955;In any case this is a good watch follow it up with a viewing of the 2 jakes.
I:67;956;A great period piece about a struggle many desert areas have encountered over the years .
I:67;957;Chinatown has aged wonderfully, like some fine piece of art deco.
I:67;958;Everything about this movie is amazing.
I:67;959;The story, the acting, the directing, the cinematography.
I:67;960;A great flick, you feel transported to that era.
I:67;961;Jack Nicholson is totally captivating in his role as a private detective who specializes in tracking down stray spouses.
I:67;962;chinatown does such a fantastic job of capturing the mood and feel of the pre.
I:67;963;You may think it's a bit slow in the beginning, but rest assured that every little detail is significant to the story, which ultimately builds to an unforgettable climax.
I:67;964;This critically acclaimed film is deserving of every accolade that has been bestowed upon it.
I:67;965;Writing, directing and acting all superb.
I:67;966;A brilliant film noire, and one of Roman Polanski's great movies.
I:67;967;Direction and acting are quite superb.
I:67;968;The plot worls, and it is a wonderful period work that most will enjoy.
I:67;969;John Huston is great in his role, a despicable one at that.
I:67;970;Much drama, loved the shots of California and all aspects to make it film noir.
I:67;971;A fan of this classic since it first was in theaters.
I:67;972;Even more merit for those of us in California, familiar with the 'water wars' about which this movie revolves.
I:67;973;plots makes it all fascinating when watched again and again.
I:67;974;First of all I am a fan of jacks films but there is a difference between a good story and a good movie.
I:67;975;This is a good story, and I have stayed interested through the whole thing twice and enjoyed it both times.
I:67;976;go states in so many words that Chinatown is a flawless film.
I:67;977;Got this great film quickly!
I:67;978;I'm so happy I waited as long as I did to finally be able to order it.
I:67;979;With all the Oscar hoopla this past year around director Roman Polanski's sprawling, if flawed The Pianist, one would think that it's the only Polanski movie out there.
I:67;980;bitingly intriguing, and who'd a thought that screenwriter Robert Towne could take an old, dying genre (the gumshoe movie) and turn it into arguably the best screenplay this side of Citizen Kane and All About Eve ?
I:67;981;It's all here, with Jack Nicholson as smooth private eye Jake Gittes, and Faye Dunaway as the cryptic Evelyn Mulwray.
I:67;982;there's a deep secret lying beneath it all that makes the movie a haunting and unforgettable experience.
I:67;983;Dunaway hides the film's tragedy well, revealing it in an infamous scene that proves this is the finest work she's ever done.
I:67;984;if you're into gumshoe flicks, this is the best one out there, but it also stands as one of the finest American films of all time.
I:67;985;One of the great lines of the film is Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown.
I:67;986;Fortunately, forgetting Chinatown is something anyone that ever sees it will never be able to do.
I:67;987;nicholson and dunaway bring vivid performences but i felt dunaway was the real star.
I:67;988;her character, evelyn mulray, brings true life into the picture and without her i may have turned off the movie.
I:67;989;with this fist cracking screenplay, excellent music score, and eye schorching cinamatography, chinatown is flat out a great film.
I:67;990;Although it moved a bit slow at times it's complexity made it interesting in the end.
I:67;991;Some movies you just appreciate more with age.
I:67;992;What I mean is that there are movies you see when you're younger and you don't fully appreciate them or admire how well crafted they are.
I:67;993;I saw it many years ago for the first time, and while I enjoyed it somewhat, at the time I thought it was long, slow and dreadfully bleak at the end.
I:67;994;"Of course, I didn't get the point that that's what ""Chinatown"" is supposed to be, and that's why it's brilliant."
I:67;995;What follows is a very complex plot filled with twists and turns that lead Jake to a place he thought he would never have to return to.
I:67;996;as I said before, the first time I saw this I thought it was an okay movie, mainly because I love Nicholson in it.
I:67;997;Now, I can watch the movie with older and wiser eyes and I can truly admire and appreciate the labor of love this film really is.
I:67;998;The reason for that is the cast and the writing really sells it.
I:67;999;pocket and I would've still found myself captivated by it because you enjoy the trip the characters give you.
I:67;1000;outs to keep the viewer entertained.
I:67;1001;while everybody is great in this movie, Nicholson really steals every scene, and the great thing is that he doesn't try to steal it.
I:67;1002;Faye Dunaway also does a superb job, and you know she does because you really don't know how much you can trust her, and that's exactly what Nicholson's character goes through.
I:67;1003;The picture looks good for it being so old.
I:67;1004;I'm hoping that they'll release a special edition sometime in the near future, as this is an important film that deserves such a treatment.
I:67;1005;Chinatown is one of those movies that you find yourself appreciating more and more the older you get.
I:67;1006;It's a classic, and it's easy to see why it is.
I:67;1007;Even if you don't end up loving it or liking it, it is something worth seeing at least once.
I:67;1008;Many writers consider Robert Towne's screenplay for `Chinatown' as the perfect screenplay.
I:67;1009;It is, and is also in fact the example of how important good writing is in the art of cinema.
I:67;1010;It is perfection and in the hands of Roman Polanski it became a film masterpiece.
I:67;1011;Towne's screenplay is layered like a decaying Dahlia with twisting mysteries and taught suspense.
I:67;1012;There is not a loose end in sight and a few well placed red herrings are added to the mix to delight any fan of this type of story.
I:67;1013;the attention to detail from vintage cars, sets, real L. a. streets and alleys to the excellent score by Jerry Goldsmith and the golden cinematography of John A. Alonzo contribute to all the aspects of this classic of the post 60's film noir.
I:67;1014;Lacquered and veiled in the most perfect black widow getup of the genre she is superbly brittle and vulnerable at the same time.
I:67;1015;She is fascinating to watch as she slowly unravels along with the mystery until she is naked in the horror of what her past and present prison is.
I:67;1016;This is a great performance by a great artist.
I:67;1017;He too gives the performance of a lifetime and his soliloquy on what a man is capable of is chilling.
I:67;1018;the center of this masterwork is Jack Nicholson who became a star with this, the best of his early work.
I:67;1019;He embodies the soul of Bogart and the heart of a romantic fighting to stay tuff in a rotten world.
I:67;1020;He is drawn with such skill that he seems not to be acting but simply existing the real world of L. a. in the late 1930's.
I:67;1021;Chinatown is seminal in its place in film history.
I:67;1022;this is one of the best film ever made and a must have for any serious film collector.
I:67;1023;This is one of my favorites to watch on a rainy Saturday.
I:67;1024;Chinatown begins with an interesting plot : the woman who had arrived in his private detective office turned out to be someone other than the person he thought.
I:67;1025;My favorite movie is LA CONFIDENTIAL.
I:67;1026;After seeing this it is a tie.
I:67;1027;I loved it it was a great storyline and in the Chandler era of thinking.
I:67;1028;One of the greatest actors of our time.
I:67;1029;He did a great job.
I:67;1030;In only several minutes of screen time John Huston is one of the best movie villains of all time.
I:67;1031;He is unforgettable delivering that line.
I:67;1032;Roman Polanski, Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and Robert Towne have never done better work than this.
I:67;1033;Intelligent, complex, beautifull, this is a wonderfull, wonderfull film.
I:67;1034;"Three of their films were up for a Best Picture Oscar including this one(the other two were ""The Godfather, Part II"" and ""The Conversation"" both directed by Francis Ford Coppola)."
I:67;1035;All the films I've just listed are now considered classics.
I:67;1036;"I remember seeing ""Chinatown"" at the Cinema 21(sadly torn down shortly after a six month run of Cameron's ""Titanic"") in San Diego and although I didn't understand the picture, I certainly enjoyed it's film noir look of Los Angeles in a hot Summer of 1937."
I:67;1037;That look and other details are retained in this outstanding blu.
I:67;1038;According to one of the special features(there are about six of them) he wrote the score in nine days at the last minute and the minute the film starts, it sets the mood of the film.
I:67;1039;The one I watched was 2.35 which is true to Roman Polanski's panavision version of the film.
I:67;1040;For the most part, the colors are sharp and sometimes jump off the screen.
I:67;1041;He changes clothes a lot from scene to scene and his suits compete with Richard Sylbert's elegant production design for the film.
I:67;1042;Sylbert makes Los Angeles look beautiful on Blu ray.
I:67;1043;Nicholson and Dunaway do some of their best work in this picture as does the rest of cast.
I:67;1044;"If any exchange defines ""Chinatown"" the movie then this is it."
I:67;1045;into this web is sprung Jake Gittes, a man who seems to be a typical film noir detective, but upon closer inspection is much more.
I:67;1046;Jake Gittes, as he gets deeper and deeper into the mysteries surrounding him, is ceasing to exist.
I:67;1047;Nicholson is subdued and cool here, in just the right amounts.
I:67;1048;He captures Jake's slow decent into near madness perfectly, while always allowing the man some sense of control.
I:67;1049;Nicholson is always watchable in whatever he does, but this may be his best performance because it asks him to tone down his manic energy, allowing it to bubble over in moments, while alluding to it as subtext in others.
I:67;1050;behind him, the acting is mostly superb.
I:67;1051;John Huston, in his few brief scenes, makes an indelible mark as the pure face of evil.
I:67;1052;Huston's deep, gravelly voice and imposing .
I:67;1053;frame do a lot at conveying the man's power, while his twinkling eyes draw you to him, even though you know better.
I:67;1054;Although best known as a legendary director, Huston nearly steals the show here.
I:67;1055;roman Polanski, who takes a brief but memorable role as the Man With Knife (that's how he's quite functionally billed), directs with his usual visual flare.
I:67;1056;Without saying anything, and without showing the audience the room around them, the scene is set perfectly.
I:67;1057;It's archetypal of how he shoots the rest of the film: with style and subtlety.
I:67;1058;"maybe I put too much stock in what William Goldman has to say, but ""Chinatown"" has to be a frontrunner when tallying up the best screenplays of all time."
I:67;1059;A good screenplay will have two things going for it: a strong structure (of vital importance always), and interesting dialogue (useful in supporting the structure and in adding colour to the proceedings).
I:67;1060;Towne gets full marks on both counts.
I:67;1061;Structurally, it's a dream, a marvelous example of the micro turning into the macro as the web of intrigue broadens exponentially, while maintaining its power on the smaller scale all along.
I:67;1062;Add to this the crisp, precise dialogue, and you've got a screenplay that's as much fun to listen to as it is to follow.
I:67;1063;Jake is full of wisecracks and homespun wisdom.
I:67;1064;Chinatown is much more than your average detective story.
I:67;1065;It's a narrative dripping in character, intrigue, and history.
I:67;1066;It'd make a great prequel.
I:67;1067;As it stands, the movie we've got is a crackerjack yarn, rich enough to demand multiple viewings.
I:67;1068;Actually, viewing the movie led my wife and I to look into the facts that the movie dramatizes.
I:67;1069;Very interesting piece of LA history.
I:67;1070;Unsurprisingly, Nicholson and Dunaway lead a great cast and the story / script are first.
I:67;1071;Kept us totally involved throughout the entire film.
I:67;1072;There are some very clever detective tricks used in the film.
I:67;1073;The director makes a brief cameo in a memorable scene.
I:67;1074;This movie is a classic for good reason.
I:67;1075;It jas a bunch of surprises in it.
I:67;1076;Jack gets his butt kicked a lot but it's a very good movie.
I:67;1077;Jack Nicholson is a master.
I:67;1078;this movie should be a must see for every person that appreciates the classic movie styles of yesteryear.
I:67;1079;the plot captures you and takes you away just like a movie should.
I:67;1080;"No matter how many formats (from Beta tape) this film really ""shines"" on blu ray."
I:67;1081;The colors are bold and are not brown tinted (like on the laserdisc) and really gives this classic a new life.
I:67;1082;This is one lovely looking picture.
I:67;1083;the special features are good too.
I:67;1084;The best, to me, is the one with Roman Polanski (and others) discussing the making of the film.
I:67;1085;This special feature is worth the price alone!
I:67;1086;I have always been fascinated with Polanski and his film making style and to see and hear him discuss this classic is pure joy for me.
I:67;1087;this is the ultimate way to view this great piece of art.
I:67;1088;dunaway and Nicholson together doing their stuff!
I:67;1089;I just now got around to seeing this great flick.
I:67;1090;This movie is one of Jack's best and truly withstands the test of time.
I:67;1091;The ending of China Town is Noir perfection.
I:67;1092;The admonitions of the uncomprehending detectives for Jake to 'just forget it' while Jake has had his world split in two is unforgettable.
I:67;1093;The movie leading up to this moment is gorgeous, funny, suspenseful and very true to Hammet and Chandler.
I:67;1094;It's in my top 10 movies.
I:67;1095;Chinatown the best of the nuevo film noir films of the 70's.
I:67;1096;Roman Polanski crafted a great detective story veiled in the classic shades of grey from the original screenplay by Robert Towne.
I:67;1097;the greatest mysteries are based on fact but covered in fiction.
I:67;1098;It was easily the best picture of 1974.
I:67;1099;jack Nicholson gives his best performance as the detective who is anything but a hero.
I:67;1100;Faye Dunaway is perfect as the not so clean damsel in distress.
I:67;1101;But John Huston, in one of his rare acting role, steals the show as the amoral industrialist.
I:67;1102;You just enjoy each layer being removed and the next secret being revealed.
I:67;1103;chinatown, Roman Polanski's brooding film noir is a film of many secrets.
I:67;1104;Like the best of films, the dialogue makes the audience feel that they're only getting part of the story, like there is this whole other world of decadence that surrounds these characters, its not just a story but a glimpse into another time and place.
I:67;1105;in order to fully appreciate Chinatown, you must really look at the character of J. j. Gittes played by Jack Nicholson in a career best performance.
I:67;1106;As the rich, vunreable and mysterious widow she is more sensual then pretty.
I:67;1107;It is a mark of Chinatown's greatness that she is not a caricature, but a nervous wounded human being.
I:67;1108;the juciest performance in the film however belongs to John Huston as the all powerful Noah Cross.
I:67;1109;As a result the pace of the film is deliberate and builds on detail.
I:67;1110;This makes the film's impact more immediate and satisfying.
I:67;1111;The difference between the two film is best represented by the difference in their music(both scores were written by Jerry Goldsmith).
I:67;1112;Each time I admire it a little more, get a firmer grip on the ingenious complicated plot and soak up more of that decadent atmosphere.
I:67;1113;Chinatown is probably one of the last great film noir movies.
I:67;1114;The absolute best feature of the movie is the script.
I:67;1115;The complex nature of the plot, with its many twists and deceptions, is a modern classic.
I:67;1116;While the movie is long, and the characters come across as people with whom it's hard to sympathize (until it's too late), the storyline is such that you are compelled to see how it unravels.
I:67;1117;So, if you're interested in an intelligent and very original story, Chinatown is a great choice.
I:67;1118;It's a very languid film, but with patience, the viewer is rewarded with a remarkable story.
I:67;1119;There's an impressive line up of celebrated actors.
I:67;1120;The movie speaks for itself in terms of character development and mood.
I:67;1121;It is by far the greatest piece of work ever to come out of the 1970's in terms of telling a solid story with interesting people and depicting a side of human nature everyone tries to forget or repress.
I:67;1122;But the real beauty of the film is how it conveys the day to day life and environment of living in Southern California.
I:67;1123;I may be prejudiced because I love mysteries and the old Noirs, but I love this movie.
I:67;1124;The plot is terrific and the acting first rate.
I:67;1125;It brought Jack Nicholson into stardom.
I:67;1126;A great acting job by Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson.
I:67;1127;The storyline is also great, it keeps you guessing the first time you watch it.
I:67;1128;"This is a masterpiece of acting(Nicholson and Dunaway brought their ""A"" game)
I:67;1129;"if you see no other film from the 70's, make sure you see ""Chinatown""."
I:67;1130;"Melancholy movie plot
I:67;1131;Great Jack Nicholson acting AGAIN
I:67;1132;This was a very well done movie with an engaging plot, that despite its length never seemed to drag on.
I:67;1133;It's surprising that for all the slavish attention to period detail that Roman Polanski puts into CHINATOWN, he lets down the audience in the finale which is supposed to take place in the actual Chinatown at night.
I:67;1134;"He uses ""Chinatown"" as a metaphor for a puzzle nobody can solve, sort of the way Thomas Mitchell summed up a mystery by saying ""makes as much sense as Chinese music"" in ""The Dark Mirror."
I:67;1135;nosed detective is played to perfection by JACK NICHOLSON in the kind of role he excelled in, justly winning a Best Actor nomination.
I:67;1136;And keeping all of this fascinating material well in hand is Roman Polanski, himself a player in the film as the hood who slashes Nicholson's nose.
I:67;1137;it's gritty, authentic looking (except for the above.
I:67;1138;mentioned flaw) and captures the mood of the story with its Los Angeles backgrounds and detailed attention to '30s styles.
I:67;1139;and while the story gets a little slow once in awhile in uncovering a convoluted plot involving land rights and water control, it leads to a highly suspenseful ending.
I:67;1140;a stylish thriller, well worth watching, especially if you love film noir.
I:67;1141;"Elegant, dark meditation on the nature of evil by one of Hollywood's best ""script doctors"" and a director who, when evil is the subject matter, obviously knows what he's doing."
I:67;1142;Nicholson is near perfect as Jake, the detective whose swagger distorts his perceptions.
I:67;1143;If you are a fan of film noir, watch this, it is great movie.
I:67;1144;Polanski's CHINATOWN easily makes my Top 5.
I:67;1145;A complex, mysterious, and brooding movie, it is impeccably flimed in.
I:67;1146;John Huston plays what is easily one of the most compelling and evil roles ever put on film.
I:67;1147;Faye Dunaway is magnetic as both the remote ice queen of wealth and the vulnerable beauty whom Nicholson's PI is understandably drawn to.
I:67;1148;An absolutely marvelous film, it will leave you feeling emotionally wrought by its end.
I:67;1149;fantastic film and one of my top 10 films of all time.
I:67;1150;This is definitely what film making is all about.
I:67;1151;thought story, outstanding acting, and incredible character development.
I:67;1152;If you like Jack Nicholson, this is one of his best.
I:67;1153;It deals with the 1930's, money, power, oranges, and water.
I:67;1154;Now it is one of my top ten.
I:67;1155;Much good in film, for sure, if you forget it was Polanski who directed it, but Jake is too dumb to make this a great movie.
I:67;1156;The Bottom Line:Watch Jack Nicholson act as well as he ever did, watch Roman Polanski channel his wife's tragic death and a script by Robert Towne into a piece of cinematic art, watch one of the few color noirs worthy of the name: above all else, watch Chinatown.
I:67;1157;Chinatown is a great story that moves along at a fairy good pace but does stall in parts.
I:67;1158;The real reason for seeing this film is Polanskis masterpiece direction of noir 30s LA and Jack Nicholsons wise.
I:67;1159;ass and wonderfully mouthy P. i. the story is pretty complexed and you will have to stay awake for a lot of it or else it will pass you by because there are lots of plot twists and turns.
I:67;1160;Overall it is great entertainment and the dialogue is pretty snappy and on que.
I:67;1161;good stuff all the same.
I:67;1162;Two of my favorite actors played such awesome roles.
I:67;1163;Kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
I:67;1164;This is an excellent movie.
I:67;1165;Stars and director are amazing.
I:67;1166;Shipping and handling of the product was exceptional.
I:67;1167;acing is superb, as is the story and the music is not bad either.
I:67;1168;Nicholson's best performance of his career.
I:67;1169;Movie group reallly enjoyed the old movie and would like to see it again soon
I:67;1170;A timeless film in its historical lesson.
I:67;1171;The plot, the art direction, the script, the acting, the music, the costumes, the cars, are just stunning.
I:67;1172;Chinatown is one of the absolute best films of the 1970s, a neo.
I:67;1173;The title is a little confusing, but the acting, plot, and presentation are great.
I:67;1174;The movie comes from the 1970's but is interesting today.
I:67;1175;I saw it before but enjoyed watching it again.
I:67;1176;Thanks for making this available.
I:67;1177;A good movie when you want to pay attention.
I:67;1178;Jack was pretty good looking guy b when he was younger.
I:67;1179;One gets the feeling while watching this film that it's patterned on maybe a Raymond Chandler/Sam Spade book.
I:67;1180;It heralded a new wave of really well done crime films from Hollywood.
I:67;1181;Superb script score and directing.
I:67;1182;One of the best movies ever made.
I:67;1183;Roman Polanski pays tribute to the era of Dashiell Hammett by making an homage to film noir which is the finest, most excellently editted and filmed noir ever produced.
I:67;1184;I will be so bold as to call Chinatown a classic.
I:67;1185;i love the mysteries throughout which you are constantly trying to sleuth along side the main character(s).
I:67;1186;the movie was also extremely aesthetically pleasing.
I:67;1187;The stark contrast between the dull scenes and strategically placed vivid colors was great.
I:67;1188;a great movie at a great price.
I:67;1189;I will certainly be adding Chinatown to my collection.
I:67;1190;one of my all time top ten films of all time.
I:67;1191;In any scene with Nicholson or Huston, they Steal it and Huston steals scenes with Nicholson.
I:67;1192;There can be a lot said for a Film about L. a., which would have been Nothing without water.
I:67;1193;The Extras here are important and a must watch.
I:67;1194;Just Jack's presence can make a film.
I:67;1195;This was early in his career, he was the Star and he Made the Movie.
I:67;1196;"Jack Nicholson is great as a ""nosy"" private detective."
I:67;1197;It is unthinkable, horiffic and chilling.
I:67;1198;Beautifully directed by Mr. Polanski who has a very bit part in the movie.
I:67;1199;One of my all time favorite films to watch.
I:67;1200;Like real life, he's powerless against the system.
I:67;1201;John Huston's character rules the town.
I:67;1202;Any good that he does is covered up by the police .
I:67;1203;No doubt this is an amazing movie.
I:67;1204;Maybe someday there will be a special edition that corrects this.
I:67;1205;This has always bothered me.
I:67;1206;CHINATOWN is such a classic that even if the only existing copy was a third.
I:67;1207;scan VHS dub, it would still deserve to be enshrined in the pantheon of great American cinema.
I:67;1208;Chinatown was inspired by the great film noir genre that was popular in the 1940's.
I:67;1209;The film not only draws inspiration from those films, it outdoes them and is the best film noir ever made.
I:67;1210;Robert Towne's brilliant screenplay has numerous plot twists and the ending is completely unexpected.
I:67;1211;Mr. Nicholson is superb as the put upon Gittes and Ms. Dunaway is luminous and mysterious as the femme fatale.
I:67;1212;John Huston is sinister as Evelyn's father and director Roman Polanski leads us through the plot with aplomb.
I:67;1213;A true movie making benchmark and one the 70's brightest movie moments.
I:67;1214;The plot line was pretty good, up until the end.
I:67;1215;A pretty simplistic but interesting plot.
I:67;1216;I saw Chinatown when it first came out in theaters and liked it a lot.
I:67;1217;But I have to say that I enjoyed it even more now.
I:67;1218;There is so much to see and appreciate.
I:67;1219;First of all, the script is amazing.
I:67;1220;so much better than the usual gumshoe flicks.
I:67;1221;LA looks beautiful in the sun drenched light.
I:67;1222;One of the movies that constantly come up in terms of scriptwriting, camera work, direction, acting, etc.
I:67;1223;I've seen Chinatown in the theatre and in every format including laserdisc since then.
I:67;1224;the extras are thankfully lengthy and informative including the history of the Los Angeles aqueduct which provided a valuable understanding of the importance of water in Chinatown and the characters who used it for their financial gain.
I:67;1225;this film is right up there on the list of great American films.
I:67;1226;ray edition with the extras really does justice to a great film and is a welcome addition to my libraryWord Into Image: Writers on Screenwriting: Robert TowneChinatown and the Last Detail: Two ScreenplaysThe YakuzaThe Cinema of Roman Polanski: Dark Spaces of the World (Directors' Cuts)Rosemary's Baby.
I:67;1227;This movie is brilliant, not just for it's time, but for all time.
I:67;1228;John Huston uses his oily warmth to great creepy effect.
I:67;1229;"and then there is the screenplay
I:67;1230;Is it that in its richness like all great works of art is the stuff of life?
I:67;1231;Early Jack Nicholson is edgy and powerful, and Faye Dunaway is an absolutely superb emotional wreck, in this examination of evil, and the limits to our ability to combat it.
I:67;1232;The surprise climax is very, very powerful.
I:67;1233;"i do NOT recommend the ""Special Collector's Edition"""
I:67;1234;Too bad about Polanski's personal downfalls, but you'll love this flick.
I:67;1235;This classic and timeless thriller from 1974 is a must watch, for the first, second or twenty.
I:67;1236;"I've heard of other older discs having issues like this such as the first version of ""The Deer Hunter"" so perhaps it's time this movie is rereleased so I can actually watch it."
I:67;1237;I agree with other reviewers, in that Chinatown is definitely in my top.
I:67;1238;I received the BD the end of August (2012) and have just now taken a look at it.
I:67;1239;Shadow detail is very good also.
I:67;1240;Overall contrast is also excellent.
I:67;1241;I want to say simply, that this BD for me, and on my system, audio included, is first rate, and an easy recommendation for any Chinatown lover.
I:67;1242;I forgot to make a comment on graininess, mentioned in another, excellent, review.
I:67;1243;screen, so I will let you other guys write in more detail about the technical end!
I:67;1244;Great psychological thriller/drama based on a multi.
I:67;1245;Nicholson is at the top of his game as J. j. Gittes { In this town I'm the leper with the most fingers. }
I:67;1246;trivia: Roman Polanski, the director, has a small speaking role.
I:67;1247;But overall, an excellent movie.
I:67;1248;I'm sure I will watch it again.
I:67;1249;the tough part is, this is a good movie.
I:67;1250;Not the greatest of it's genre, but still worth seeing.
I:67;1251;I loved all the old cars
I:67;1252;Ah, the good ol' days of the 1930s.
I:67;1253;Gritty private eyes, rich socialites, political corruption.
I:67;1254;Jack Nicholson provides yet another timeless role as the hard.
I:67;1255;Faye Dunaway is also brilliant as the tortured Evelyn Mulray, who lives in her father's dark shadow and hides an incredible secret that brings down her world.
I:67;1256;every aspect of this movie resulted in flawless filmaking, from the shady cinamatography to the changes of scenery in and around Southern California.
I:67;1257;"In Gittes' world, no man (or woman) can escape from the city's corruption
I:67;1258;Polanski himself even makes a cameo appearance, as a knife.
I:67;1259;But the most interesting character, besides Gittes, is John Huston's Noah Cross, the rich water boss who is seemingly capable of any crime.
I:67;1260;Nicholson, Dunaway and Houston all give memorable performances, perhaps the best of their careers, and Polanski pieces the story together into a mystery/drama/noir, which never gets boring.
I:67;1261;the acting, the setting, the music, the camerawork, the costumes.
I:67;1262;Gosh, Jack Nicholson looked handsome in those beautiful period suits, and Faye Dunnaway was so beautiful, and so beautifully dressed.
I:67;1263;The brilliant script by Robert Towne justly received an Oscar, but of eleven nominations, this was the only one the movie received.
I:67;1264;It's chief competitor was GODFATHER II, another good movie, which was getting the awards that the first Godfather movie didn't get.
I:67;1265;CHINATOWN seems to me to use color quite successfully, and much of it takes place during daytime, with bright lighting.
I:67;1266;I don't know how Roman Polanski and his cinematographer did it, but it would be fascinating to know.
I:67;1267;Roman Polanski directed one of the perfect movies.
I:67;1268;Nickolson, Dunaway, Houston are perfect casting.
I:67;1269;One of the best screenplays ever written.
I:67;1270;noir.1930's Los Angeles is perfectly rendered as a background.
I:67;1271;nickolson in his best role.
I:67;1272;the cinematography and editing are supberb.
I:67;1273;And the string that pulls it all together is the music soundtrack.
I:67;1274;From the opening titles it tells us we are going on an emotional haunting.
I:67;1275;This is one of my favorite Polanski films, which is saying a lot.
I:67;1276;But in his heart, he does want to help.
I:67;1277;He is skilled as an investigator and smart, but gets in way over his head.
I:67;1278;Dunaway, the femme fatale who is the only person with a clear idea of diong good, also defies simple labels.
I:67;1279;Their performances are amongst the finest of their careers, so good they have to been seen and savored more than once.
I:67;1280;Huston is also good as a sleazeball, but even he adds aspects to the character that make the role unforgettable.
I:67;1281;this is one of the films that is so interesting and moving you can watch it at each phase of your life and find nuance you missed.
I:67;1282;Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.
I:67;1283;The success of THE PIANIST recalls Roman Polanski's glory days, when in just over a decade he turned out such stunning classics like KNIFE IN WATER, REPULSION, THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS, ROSEMARY'S BABY, and this film, CHINATOWN.
I:67;1284;One thing all these films have in common is the great difficulty the main character has in each film in discovering what is appearance and what is reality, perhaps in the end discovering that reality is an illusion.
I:67;1285;"In the usual detective film, the gumshoe follows a string of clues and in the end is able to assert order over chaos by ""solving"" the mystery."
I:67;1286;Later, that is the eye through which she is shot and killed.
I:67;1287;That real life incident took place several decades earlier than the time in which CHINATOWN was set, but with the central role that water has played in the Los Angeles's, the incident was well chosen.
I:67;1288;it is almost impossible to say of an actor like Jack Nicholson that one role is his finest, but one can at least state that his turn as Jake Gittes is one of his very finest performances.
I:67;1289;His fortitude in the face of moral horror provides the foundation for the narrative, and his collapse upon looking into the heart of the void at the end of the film establishes precisely the right tone.
I:67;1290;John Huston managed to create one of the vilest characters in the history of film, while Roman Polanski himself managed to be one of the scariest.
I:67;1291;The scene where Polanski cuts Nicholson's nose is rightfully remembered as one of the most vivid in the movies.
I:67;1292;Hopefully his resurrection with THE PIANIST will signal a return to form of one of the most interesting directors of the 1960s.
I:67;1293;By all accounts, Noah Cross (Huston) is an immensely wealthy and power force within the city's business community.
I:67;1294;a brilliant strategy on Polanski's part to sustain interest with precise pacing while creating tensions and even conflicts whose nature evades understanding.
I:67;1295;It is paradoxical that so many of its important scenes are bathed by dazzling Southern California sunshine in this prime example of a film noir.
I:67;1296;The plot and characters are complex but chillingly believeable.
I:67;1297;The lighting, cinematography, setting, costumes.
I:67;1298;slobbering wealthy still holds up 30 years later.
I:67;1299;This is an incredible film.
I:67;1300;Chinatown is a classic detective flick in which Jack Nicholson flaunts his formidable acting talent.
I:67;1301;The early 20th Century California setting gives this film a wonderful ambiance that I have always found to be irresistible.
I:67;1302;An adult movie with adult stars .
I:67;1303;just a meaty plot with deceptions and turns enough to please a serious viewer.
I:67;1304;It is among the best.
I:67;1305;Great movie It came to our home very quickly.
I:67;1306;If one like Nicholson and Dunaway we highly recommend this movie
I:67;1307;I'm a fan of Noir films from the 50's and this is similar in tone and subject.
I:67;1308;The surprise ending was also a plus.
I:67;1309;Great direction, great acting, great script, star power.
I:67;1310;one of the greatest, and last, film noirs.
I:67;1311;That's part of the film's charm.
I:67;1312;The memorable script and artful direction help contribute.
I:67;1313;But there are some extra interviews on this disc.
I:67;1314;it is a superb film from top to basics.
I:67;1315;all involved are at the top of their form and game,One of those films you can see over and over as it is so very rich in all detail.
I:67;1316;the film starts out slowly but toward the end picks up rapidly for a startling and exciting finish.
I:67;1317;"The use of 1930s decor is impressive
I:67;1318;Everything is seamlessly utilized by the actors so they appear to be living in the era, not merely participating in a costume film.
I:67;1319;"Everything has its purpose
I:67;1320;This film spares no one and shows that even the most admirable characters have their demons.
I:67;1321;I liked the suspense, the surprises in the story line.
I:67;1322;I liked the acting and actors.
I:67;1323;Chinatown is a classic tragedy.
I:67;1324;She asks what he did in Chinatown, and he answers, as little as possible.
I:67;1325;He had written this screen play specifically for Jack Nicholson who was his friend and ex.
I:67;1326;fortunately for Polanski the film was produced by Robert Evans who had the genius of letting great directors direct.
I:67;1327;Polanski notes in the documentaries that Evans more than anyone else made this film a great movie.
I:67;1328;Guess what movie won that year, 1974?
I:67;1329;steps in this that I can see.
I:67;1330;the mystery gets deeper and deeper and just when you think you have the story figured out, another twist.
I:67;1331;But my heart belongs to Bogie.
I:67;1332;Great movie and LA's tainted history!
I:67;1333;Another perfect movie for Nicholson's talent
I:67;1334;It's Chinatown, with great writing, acting and direction, sometimes you get a classic!!
I:67;1335;This film is a classic in American cinema and probably the world's.
I:67;1336;I have watched it many times and learned about the art of film making from the numerous reviews about it.
I:67;1337;And aside from all that, it is a riveting story that is full of familiar faces.
I:67;1338;It's worth watching once and then coming back time after time.
I:67;1339;I see something new and interesting every time I see it.
I:67;1340;One of my top ten favorite films, Polanski and the spot.
I:67;1341;on cast made one for the ages with this one.
I:67;1342;Really wonderful to see a film of this age look like it was shot yesterday.
I:67;1343;now I just want The Last Picture Show to get the same treatment, and I'll be happy :)
I:67;1344;Style and form takes your eye and misleads you into thinking you know what's going on.
I:67;1345;Nicholson's Gittes character is fantastic .
I:67;1346;he is caught in a game far far greater than he can understand and the reality of the stakes involved only dawn on him at the very end.
I:67;1347;And Polanski's direction is as good as anyone in the history of cinema .
I:67;1348;this is what great cinema is all about
I:67;1349;When I was reading one of the reviews for 'The Usual Suspects', there was a mention of 'Chinatown' and how it was such a great movie.
I:67;1350;Some comments say that this one is the best Film Noir till date, and I have one word for such reviews: Baloney!Bottom line: Don't see it, see 'The Usual Suspects' again (and again and again and again.)
I:67;1351;Jack Nicholson is wonderfully dry.
I:67;1352;l. a. cop and private eye whose metier is marital work.
I:67;1353;Jack suspects that he is at the center of a setup, and is confronted by Faye, the public official's beautiful, long.
I:67;1354;the film is artfully and stylishly done.
I:67;1355;The beauty is in the detail.
I:67;1356;Color, costumes, cars, and set designs are exquisite.
I:67;1357;Although many reviewers seem to consider it a noir classic, most scenes are day, with many sunny exterior shots, which belie the darkness of the subject matter.

I:67;1361;for people who like Nicholson, it is a first.
I:67;1362;Faye was and remains a ravishing beauty.
I:67;1363;Likewise, her acting is standout.
I:67;1364;Although it's a mystery, the movie holds up well after repeat viewings.
I:67;1365;There is a lot of plot to absorb on the first viewing.
I:67;1366;It was fun to see a young Jack Nicholson and young Faye Dunaway.
I:67;1367;It was also a believable about the water struggles in California.
I:67;1368;The final last words off a legendary film.
I:67;1369;bannishment, Roman Polanski developed this classic who done it.
I:67;1370;Jack Nicholson continued to give one great performance after another during the early 70's with this one setting the stage for an Academy Award the next year.
I:67;1371;Another great performance was John Huston as the sinister father.
I:67;1372;This is one movie I could continue to watch over and over and over.
I:67;1373;A beautiful widescreen transfer of both video and sound, this release will be welcomed by fans of Roman Polanski Robert Towne's triumph.

I:67;1375;first rate in every way.
I:67;1376;Supplemental material is also good.
I:67;1377;But just like the film itself, the cover art demands closer inspection.
I:67;1378;A true classic can truly be determined by the test of time.
I:67;1379;Soon after that I bought it, and it is now a film I cherish deeply.
I:67;1380;roman Polanski's cinematic translation of Robert Towne's script is beyond words.
I:67;1381;Every scene is pristine, but delicate.
I:67;1382;One of his best performances.
I:67;1383;i love this film, and so will you.
I:67;1384;A superb tale of corruption and greed with an unforgettable ending which is worth owning for the performances of the leads alone.
I:67;1385;It had very Good acting.
I:67;1386;It had an interesting and it was well directed.
I:67;1387;Great production values and editing.
I:67;1388;It was interesting to see Jack Nicholson as a young man.
I:67;1389;A landmark film that I was anxious to get to my small collection of videos.
I:67;1390;interesting from the first to the last minute, a real screenwriter's gem, directedand acted expertly.
I:67;1391;This was my favorite film from college.
I:67;1392;Not all movies in Hollywood end with a happy ending.
I:67;1393;This movie is high on my list of favorites.
I:67;1394;A Really good story and good directing and some really fantastic acting what more can you ask for in a movie.
I:67;1395;This is the best Polanski movie I have seen, although I like most of his other works.
I:67;1396;But the first time I saw this movie, I was so awed by Polanki's masterpiece.
I:67;1397;If you watch the movie carefully, you will find that this movie has a lot of subtle meanings relating to the Bible,and as typically Polanski, Evil wins in the end.
I:67;1398;it has far more deeper meanings, something you have to sense for yourself.
I:67;1399;One of Jack's best with a great supporting role by Faye Dunaway.
I:67;1400;Too many deep reds, too much color infused in the film , far from the original.
I:67;1401;Chinatown (1974) may be the best screenplay ever written.

I:67;1407;The period from 1960 to 1979 is unparalleled, but the backstory of the people who created these classics is a telling tale of why the genre leans to the Left.

I:67;1419;It was a good movie.
I:67;1420;I have watched this classic many times and each time I am more impressed with the directing and storyline.
I:67;1421;So many classic lines and scenes to mention.
I:67;1422;The language crackles with suspense and exhibits the personalities of the major players.
I:67;1423;Whenever 2 of the major players are on the screen one sees competition for who will steal the scene.
I:67;1424;This is excellent movie making 1970's style.
I:67;1425;If you have the time, watch this movie.
I:67;1426;faye Dunaway plays the beautiful and enigmatic Evelyn Mulwray whose husband uncovers the misdeeds.
I:67;1427;He is murdered as a result.
I:67;1428;Chinatown is a tour de force in every aspect from the slyly engrossing direction of Roman Polanski to the brisk and ingenious screenplay by Robert Towne.
I:67;1429;the performances are uniformly superb.
I:67;1430;Nicholson is 100% believable as the sardonic, weary, and compassionate detective.
I:67;1431;And Faye Dunaway proves yet again that she is more than simply a classic beauty.
I:67;1432;(And her beauty is quite extraordinary indeed!)
I:67;1433;Hers is a heartbreaking, richly layered performance.
I:67;1434;It represents the work of artists at the peak of their skills.
I:67;1435;Chinatown has and will endure as one of the finest movies ever made.
I:67;1436;The performances in this film are just incredible, I've never really liked Faye Dunaway but I have to admit she had the acting chops to more than hold her own with Jack Nicholson and John Huston.
I:67;1437;chinatown is a damn fine film.
I:67;1438;that said, i watched it a second time about a year or two later and it was a revelation.
I:67;1439;i was thrilled at every line and twist and marvelled at the 1930s fantasy of the sets and outfits.
I:67;1440;"when approached with patience, ""chinatown"" is full of details, nuanced moments and dark existential energy."
I:67;1441;this movie operates on many levels.
I:67;1442;one obvious level is a modern homage to film noir, even using john huston as a primary charactor.
I:67;1443;combined with the overall richness of the personalities and the constant snapiness of the dialogue is the unmistakable goofy and very dark touches of polanski.
I:67;1444;i am a huge admirer of his, and he puts his mark fully in this picture, including of course his infamous cameo with the knife.
I:67;1445;style to see what the result of gun fire is.
I:67;1446;the mix of the deadly serious and negative with a sharp and humorous bite is a very endearing and brilliant charactor of polanski's best work.
I:67;1447;It is a great tale told by some our best actors of the time.
I:67;1448;PS: The period clothes, cars and scenery are wonderful.
I:67;1449;This is a remarkable film, possibly the best work of it's director, Polanski, it's leading actor, Nicholson, and it's screenwriter, Towne.
I:67;1450;This film works at a leisurely pace and is a loving recreation of 30s noir.
I:67;1451;jake Gittes is a well.
I:67;1452;He works in the field of divorce and adultery.
I:67;1453;She is a very alluring femme.
I:67;1454;the cinematography is excellent with low horizon wide screen vistas of muted colours and radiant light.
I:67;1455;It was also with the forthcoming sex trial, going to be his last.
I:67;1456;He imbues the film with a sense of Greek tragedy,giving it the darkest(and best) ending possible, taking your breath away.
I:67;1457;faye Dunnaway is remarkable in the role of a patrician lady with a dark vulnerability.
I:67;1458;the script is lean, tight and full of witty lines(it went on to win Oscar for screenplay).
I:67;1459;Polanski's personal tragedies have a great bearing on the crushing despondency of the outcome.
I:67;1460;Sorry I waited so long to [finally] see this movie.
I:67;1461;Jack Nicholson is an awesome actor.
I:67;1462;That's the best advice I can give to people who haven't seen this film but going to.
I:67;1463;The payoff is so much more rewarding when you don't know anything about the movie.
I:67;1464;The last 20 minutes of the film is a rollercoaster ride, just when you thought it's over, it's not.
I:67;1465;This has to be one of the most memorable extended endings in the movie history together with Seven and Casablanca to name a few.
I:67;1466;the performances are all phenomenal.
I:67;1467;He gets to exhibit a range of emotions combining subtlety and intensity.
I:67;1468;Faye Dunaway has the perfect mystique to capture the character and she made it really touching and compelling especially towards the end of the movie.
I:67;1469;but the real star of the movie is the screenplay of Robert Towne.
I:67;1470;This is the best screenplay in movie history.
I:67;1471;But of course huge credit should be given to Roman Polanski who combine all this film making aspects and turn into a masterpiece unparalleled in it's genre up to this time.
I:67;1472;It starred a prime time Jack Nicholson and leading lady supreme Faye Dunaway.
I:67;1473;Chinatown is one of the great detective murder mystery movies.
I:67;1474;It's a very dark noir from start and certainly to finish.
I:67;1475;The more he learns the more complex the story becomes on every level.
I:67;1476;The Academy Award winning genius screenplay was written by Robert Towne.
I:67;1477;Rarely will you find a movie that is this well written.
I:67;1478;Overall this is a very intriguing film.
I:67;1479;The directorial pace that drives it is truly one of kind.
I:67;1480;Chinatown takes place in the 1920s, it was created in the 1970s, but really it could fit right in at any time period.
I:67;1481;This one is 100% class, suspense, and corruption all the way.
I:67;1482;This business requires a certain amount of finesse.
I:67;1483;Everything little last thing works, and it all works so well.
I:67;1484;This film needs a full.
I:67;1485;but this probably is the best way to see Chinatown short of a theater revivial.
I:67;1486;Widescreen allows us to apprecite the composition in the frame.
I:67;1487;Instead, since one of the themes of the movie is voyeurism and since Jake Gittes is a private eye, many of the heightened emotional moments are shot with a handheld camera following the action at eye level, usually behind Jake.
I:67;1488;This brings the audience into personal contact with the action, giving it an almost documentary feel at times.
I:67;1489;Certainly a film this dark, this probing, this skeptical of human nature and the political system, would never be made the same way today, where one's allegiance is suspect if they don't have a giant American flag flying on their minivan.

I:67;1493;There's relatively little action by today's standards, but the few violent scenss are so sharp and so believeable that they stay etched in the viewer's mind.
I:67;1494;Sound, on the other hand, is quite good for the vintage, with a stereo transfer of Jerry Goldsmith's haunting music (written in just eight days after the first composer to score the film was sacked) and a few *discreetly added* stereo effects.

I:67;1496;All the principles, except John Huston, are still alive.
I:67;1497;Amazingly, this classic of American films remains largely undocumented.

I:67;1509;"Generations of fans, however, have long since recognized that ""Chinatown"" is a milestone in the history of the film noir and in the professional history of its participants, and one of Hollywood's finest hours."
I:67;1510;It's so beautifully, intricately plotted.
I:67;1511;the acting and directing is flawless .
I:67;1512;this remain my favorite Jack Nicholson role, for which all his later excesses could be forgiven.
I:67;1513;Chinatown is one of the few examples of a perfect movie.
I:67;1514;The cinematography, the music, the acting and of course the direction are all first rate.
I:67;1515;Polanski is a master director, and Chinatown is a great film to prove that point.
I:67;1516;Polanski got the best performances of their careers out of Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway.
I:67;1517;With lesser directors both of those actors are prone to ham it up and go over the top, often embarrassingly, but not here and the result is pure brilliance.
I:67;1518;the kind of movies that I will support .
I:67;1519;Here's hoping that it receives the proper treatment to make it worth the wait.
I:67;1520;Many interesting plot twists and turns.
I:67;1521;This is probably either the best or of of the best movies since World War Two.
I:67;1522;The plot was beautifully portrayed through the brilliant direction of Roman Polanski and there's couldn't be anyone who could act out the part of Jake Gittes batter than Jack Nicholson.
I:67;1523;jack nails it as usual.
I:67;1524;gritty symbolism reveals a foggy realism of what the world is really like, at least in old california.
I:67;1525;One of the better movies I've seen in a while.

I:67;1532;The best thing Faye Dunaway will ever do.
I:67;1533;The best thing Roman Polanski will ever do.
I:67;1534;The best thing Robert Towne will ever do.
I:67;1535;It is a flawless, polished gem of a film.
I:67;1536;a rare treasure of unequaled technical mastery, unrivaled performances by both Nicholson and Dunaway, and screenwriting excellece of course too.
I:67;1537;chinatown is arguably the greatest movie ever made.
I:67;1538;"Chinatown is certainly not the most ""important"" film, as it is essentially a rehashing of the film noir genre, but it terms of absolute and unequivocal success as BOTH a work of art and entertainment, Chinatown is without rival."
I:67;1539;"Critics may have written much more about other movies of the period, and certainly for instance ""Taxi Driver"" is more of a cultural monument, but nothing can touch the staggering richness of this film."
I:67;1540;It still hits me like a locomotive every time I see it.
I:67;1541;I think this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:67;1542;Jack Nicholson does an excellent job in this movie.
I:67;1543;Like I said, one of the best movies I have seen.
I:67;1544;Defenate watch again in my book.
I:67;1545;Great noir films must have a certain dark, brooding atmosphere and Chinatown has this atmosphere in spades.
I:67;1546;This film starts as a relatively simple detective story about a philandering husband but slowly the layers of the onion are peeled back and the web of intrigue becomes more complex and seedy.
I:67;1547;This film is really a throwback to the great noir era of the 40s.
I:67;1548;If you like any of the noir greats (like Double Indemnity), you'll love Chinatown.
I:67;1549;I am a fan of Jack Nicholson, but, this movie is simply amazing.
I:67;1550;I am really not that easily impressed by movies, honestly get bored really easily, but, this one with its 8.4/10.0 on imdb, is a very special one.
I:67;1551;noir cinema directed by the great Roman Polanski (Rosemary's Baby) and starring three time Academy Award winning actor Jack Nicholson (both of whom are no strangers to dark stories).
I:67;1552;Chinatown is a mystifying puzzle of a film that immerses its viewers into its world.
I:67;1553;He's sarcastic as well as a scoundrel, but that's Jake's charm.
I:67;1554;How he keeps such good humor about the events is anyone's guess.
I:67;1555;"jack Nicholson's performance is one of the best I've seen out of him (and that's saying something) truly embodying J. J. ""Jake"" Gittes
I:67;1556;Jake Gittes will bring you into Chinatown with a fast tongue and scathing sarcasm.
I:67;1557;with such a bleak film it's almost hard to believe it can be such a beloved classic, yet here it remains as one of the greatest films of all time.
I:67;1558;"People always seem to look for happy endings
I:67;1559;a great director brings his or her vision to screen without compromise.
I:67;1560;I would watch it again and I would recommend it.
I:67;1561;What I saw was good though.
I:67;1562;I have loved this movie since I first saw it when it first came out .
I:67;1563;color film noir detective genre, the acting is fantastic, the plot incredible, it is a classic .
I:67;1564;I always find something new.
I:67;1565;Chinatown is a throwback noir thriller set in the broad daylight of southern California.
I:67;1566;The color palette is all primary: bright yellows and sanguinary reds.
I:67;1567;Polanski sets the tone and the period perfectly.
I:67;1568;Unlike most noir films of the forties, though, Chinatown has a great script with fantastic characters, a whirling, looping (but always sensible and believable) plot, and one of the best endings of any Hollywood film of any period.
I:67;1569;Though it need not be said at this point, Nicholson is at his very best, and even the icy Faye Dunaway comes across as sympathetic.
I:67;1570;It's one of the best pictures ever made.
I:67;1571;Robert Towne penned the keep you guessing script.
I:67;1572;Just another unparalleled film of the American seventies, a time when they seemed to come off the line as regularly as clockwork.
I:67;1573;"A remarkable film noir classic, ""Chinatown"" finally gets the deluxe treatment it deserves on Blu."
I:67;1574;the audio is spectacular for the film.
I:67;1575;It depends on your TV and how good it displays high def and, more importantly, how important THIS film is to you.
I:67;1576;Both sound very good with the 5.1 featuring a nice dynamic mix.
I:67;1577;It is a superb example of film making, certainly among the 20 best movies I have ever seen.
I:67;1578;crosses, murders and plot twists all lead into a climatic showdown in Chinatown which has a surprising conclusion.
I:67;1579;Sex is only suggested between the Nicholson and Dunaway characters, yet it is convincing enough.
I:67;1580;nicholson is a tour de force in his role as Gitties, but the rest of the supporting cast (Including John Huston as Mulwray's deceptive father) is equally superb.
I:67;1581;As to how Nicholson could loose the Best Actor Oscar to Art Carney in Harry and Toto is beyond me.
I:67;1582;Fortunately, Nicholson and Duanway have both won Oscars since.
I:67;1583;In addition, the film itself received nominations for Best Picture and Best Director for Roman Polanski (Who has a cameo in the movie as the knife.
I:67;1584;The only Oscar won was for Robert Towne's screenplay, which is today considered the model for film writing.
I:67;1585;After watching the movie, one will know why.
I:67;1586;From the stellar performances to the sharp direction to the superb screenplay, this is a cinema treasure.
I:67;1587;Great film that captures the subterfuge of L. a.'s water grab doing the '30s and '40s .
I:67;1588;plus, it has great acting.
I:67;1589;Chinatown arguably represents Jack Nicholson at his very best in his most enduring role, despite not having received an Oscar for his effort.
I:67;1590;Fortunately Robert Towne netted an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in what film experts consider one of the greatest scenarios ever written.
I:67;1591;History was juxtaposed and the controversy was moved from the first decade of the twentieth century to 1937.
I:67;1592;It made good sense cinematically since the city was so much more developed by that time.
I:67;1593;Gittes' romantic progress is slowed by the manner in which he holds Evelyn, an erudite, sophisticated woman in awe, someone removed from his own rough and tumble middle class world.
I:67;1594;in addition to adroitly directing the film, maintaining a consistently brisk pace, Roman Polanski also had a small but key acting role.
I:67;1595;"Playing one of Cross' thugs, he tells Gittes, ""You've got a big nose, kitty cat."""
I:67;1596;This is a great steelbook and looks very nice.
I:67;1597;Arrived undamaged and excited to watch it.
I:67;1598;Fast shipping and is at a reasonable price.
I:67;1599;There's a relationship with a woman that Faye is protecting.
I:67;1600;You'll find a gem in each performance and the cameo by the director is not fun to watch but essential to the film.
I:67;1601;This film is classic, a return to the early days of Los Angeles before the Dodgers and freeways in the interwar era.
I:67;1602;The remaking of the roaring 20s milieu is well done with autos, phones, cigarette cases and spiffy clothes.
I:67;1603;Jack Nicholson is great as a 1930's private eye in this classic film noir about the building of an aqueduct to supply southern California with water.
I:67;1604;More than a must see movie.
I:67;1605;Maintains suspense from beginning to end.
I:67;1606;A dark, real sense of place and time.
I:67;1607;It's a mystery, wrapped in an enigmatic love story, riddled with corruption.
I:67;1608;It's his best script, and elicited Jack Nicholson's finest performance.
I:67;1609;Chinatown is one of the best movies of all time directed by one of the greatest directors of all time (who seems to go unappreciated): Roman Polanski.
I:67;1610;With great performances by Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson, it's no wonder why this film is a classic.
I:67;1611;The film is a great example of film noir, and it keeps you in suspense throughout the film.
I:67;1612;The story for this film is so brilliant that it could beat out almost any modern Hollywood film today.
I:67;1613;this film has so many great epic scenes, such as the one where Jack slaps Faye for some answers.
I:67;1614;The ending is one of the best endings of all time.
I:67;1615;Roman Polanski directed this film to a Best Picture nomination.
I:67;1616;the story is complex so you need to pay attention at all times.
I:67;1617;There are a lot of twists, and we only slowly discover things as we follow Jake throughout the film investigating.
I:67;1618;Two scandals are investigated side by side: a personal family one, and a water business one.
I:67;1619;This film has a lot of film noir characteristics, so if your a fan of noir, mystery, investigations, scandal, that type of stuff you will love this film.
I:67;1620;The film is a mix of suspense, romance, and detective work.
I:67;1621;Besides that, the acting, directing and script are all very good.
I:67;1622;Jack at one of his early best.
I:67;1623;Great sets and attention to detail.
