id;spiegazione
1;this to me, being a teen in the 70's, brought back many fun memories, and I chuckled through most of it.
2;nothing cerebral, just good fun.
3;One of the funniest movies I've seen.
4;You just gotta keep livin' man.
5;L I V I N.
6;Great movie from the 90's.
7;A critically acclaimed, very funny winner.
8;They're just kids, mostly pretty wild kids at that.
9;This is very unusual in Hollywood, of course, and is probably a healthy, or at least thoughtful, approach.
10;She has the most lethal glances at her casual boyfriend, Jason London ( Floyd , the quarterback) when she walks past him and sees him with other girls.
11;You have to be on the lookout for the times they walk past each other, but it is so worth it.
12;The smart kids have a few really good moments, which somehow I hadn't expected in a party movie.
13;Ok, I just pointed out some things to watch for, but basically it is worth watching just because it is very entertaining, and really shows a slice of life.
14;almost everyone in that movie reminded me of someone I knew in real life.
15;Music is fantastic too .
16;all in all a splendid romp through that time.
17;The Criterion Collection finds the best movies around the world, and releases them in very well made packaging.
18;The packaging for Dazed and Confused was very well made.
19;The case itself is really popping out with colors, and has amazing art on it.
20;This edition has commentary from director Richard Linklater and was recorded just for The Criterion Collection.
21;If you haven't seen this great movie now is the perfect time.
22;This movie is my all time favorite!
23;But through this process you are transported to this place and time.
24;I have little interest in the 70s but what a fun trip it is while watching this movie.
25;*******This movie takes place in the Bicentennial year, 1976.
26;The movie begins with the football players meeting up for the last periods of class and getting into a confrontation with their coach, whom wants them all to sign a promise to keep out of trouble (among other things) during the summer.
27;This leads us into the introduction of next years incoming Freshmen class!
28;Again, this movie is SPECTACULAR!
29;Total classic that will be watched by my kids and my kids kids!
30;I honestly can't recall how many times i've seen this movie.
31;The picture is flawless, and the soundtrack is stellar.
32;the cast is kind of amazing, considering how bad the movie is.
33;I recognized several people who've have had successful careers since this film.
34;Other actors include plenty of oh, yeah,THAT guy!
35;Maybe it was funny when it came out.
36;Not massive fun, or wildly entertaining, but.
37;And quirky and dated and wall.
38;This is a great movie.
39;It brings you back to when you were a teen, in high school, with your friends having great times.
40;It was fun to watch with my friends when we were 17 18 and it's still fun to watch 12 years later.
41;Amazon lists a commentary track by Richard Linklater, class.
42;(And yes, in public school to pirate is a verb).
43;This movie is a cult classic, the rock.
44;n. roll nostalgia it brings back.
45;What an absolute perfect release for this movie.
46;era packaging and a totally awesome selection of bonus features makes this special edition two.
47;Let me tell you what Melba Toast is packin' right here, all right.
48;woodersonThat's what I love about these high school girls, man.
49;woodersonSay, man, you got a joint?
50;It's just pretty much in the movie.
51;And i think the dynamic word suites very well!
52;The movie has great characters and the right suiteable actors for'em.
53;And still so many talents gone.
54;The movie is incredible lotsa drugs!
55;I watched it once and it more than sort of mirrored what life was like for me back then (I was 15 at the time).
56;It's a pleasure to see Mitch follow in Pink's footsteps, while wondering uneasily if Pink is going to follow in Wooderson's footsteps.
57;It's even fun to hear everyone, girls and guys alike, overuse the word man , because that's just what we all did.
58;Watch it with someone who was from that era and can relate.
59;It is a great movie to watch with friends while sharing beers or just hanging out without a point.
60;but the film is a period piece, which is a favorite genre for me and one has the chance to see if the producer/director gets things right, whether it's clothes, hairstyles, cars, etc. or whatever.
61;Slacker is explicitly set in Austin, and I recognize scenes from thirty years ago in that movie.
62;i think Wiggins in this movie is easily the best actor.
63;So in a way, this movie is kind of like Ridgmont High meets The Wonder Years.
64;And thanks to stuff like cell phones, kids don't have the kind of adventures and fun they did back then, in Austin or anywhere.
65;This move is all right all right all right all right.
66;Great drinking games to play with it and your friends.
67;I absolutely love this cult classic and the Criterion Collection has so many features that just add to my adoration!
68;Interviews with the actors, behind the scenes of the 10th anniversary in Austin.
69;seeing the antics, getting a buzz behind the school, the party in the woods, and especially the clothes, brought me back to a great and fun time in my life, that I THOUGHT I wouldn't miss, but I do.
70;the music is pretty awesome ( except for Peter Frampton ), it really clicks with the movie.
71;i watch this movie about every couple of months or so, and still crack up at Slater.
72;So many people I knew that was just like him.
73;it also comes with a book that was put together pretty well as far as bringing the characters to life if you will.
74;To me it's worth having as an extra to watch once in a blue moon.
75;this movie has become a cult classic for almost everyone, especially for the kids that have reached their late forties to early fifties.
76;Our big brothers and sisters had fought the revolution of the 60s, and won us the right to get high every day after school and sit in the park and talk about nothing at all.
77;Dazed and Confused should really be packaged with Breaking Away as companion pieces for that particular time and place in American History.
78;First off, I love this movie.
79;Since then I've seen it more times than I can count on my fingers and toes.
80;I can practically recite every line.
81;and that really did add to my enjoyment of the actual movie.
82;Like I said, I can recite a lot of the lines.
83;The title of this film is very fitting.
84;quite possibly one of the single greatest movies from my generation.
85;we don't have much in the way of traditional classics, but this film, though about another era, signals the concept of group dynamics and the Anerican way perfectly.
86;Affleck is my personal favorite here.
87;The final party scene comes and goes without much impact, and all that build up for nothing!
88;A perfect flick to watch before a full night of partying.
89;Dazed and Confused reminds us that life is pretty simple when you break it down, just have fun and live it up.
90;Although there isn't much of a plot that develops, this film's still great cause of the soundtrack and non.
91;What is this movie doing in my list of greatest movies ever made?
92;It is because its one of the best movies I've ever seen, teen movie or otherwise.
93;The cast is perfect, and everything about them rings true, its like I lived the story and identify with the cast.
94;Anyone familiar with this film knows that the soundtrack is one of the best things about the movie and it's never sounded more wonderful.
95;Its just one of those movies that you can watch over and over because the dialogue is so good.
96;This movie is worth it for the one liners alone.
97;It's great to see a movie that launches so many careers.
98;By the way Linklater's mom has a really great Bed Breakfest in Texas.
99;Wish I could remember the town .
100;First is Cole Hauser with his slick acting.
101;That was just an awesome performance in playing David Wooderson, a high school wannabe who graduated from high school already yet hanging out with the high school crowd.
102;His lines are among the best.
103;One of them is very memorable: That's what I love about these high school girls, man.
104;That's a true classic from him.
105;The best performance of his career.
106;There are nice incorporations by small time role.
107;Ben Affleck, who got nailed by an abrupt departure in this film, should have had a more extended work.
108;The shining star of this film is Matthew McConaughey as the gorgeous Dave Wooderson.
109;His lines are brilliantly delivered and right to the punch of his character.
110;His remarkable keenness of being part of this 70's atavism is absolutely outstanding, and he richly deserves a merit here, which is an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.
111;All in all, Dazed and Confused is a fun.
112;Put simply, this is THE best movie (to me) of all time.
113;Great nostalgic movie that brings back many high school memories.
114;I highly recommend this for anyone that graduated from high school in the 1970's.
115;The music soundtrack is great and brings back many memories.
116;It just seems that this movie does a perfect job of re.
117;I'm actually saying wow for two reasons.
118;studded cast of characters, but ones that have plenty of memorable lines and memorable scenes, it's probably the second best way to write a movie, or rather, the best way to make a movie that's missing a meaningful plot.
119;These are actually REALLY enjoyable segments to watch and they're always done with a feel.
120;Dazed and Confused is just downright *fun*.
121;A real treat to watch.
122;Well I'm a bit disappointed that my Dazed and Confused soundtrack doesn't include *every* song you hear in the movie (such as Lynyrd Skynyrd's Tuesday's Gone, Ted Nugent's Stranglehold or Black Sabbath's Paranoid to name a few) it's totally fine since those songs can all be found on numerous other discs/sources.
123;Expect lots of Alice Cooper, Foghat, Peter Frampton and Ted Nugent in particular, among the occasional Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Seals and Crofts, Steve Miller Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd in between.
124;Oh and on a final note, the women are absolutely *smoking* hot too.
125;This is my favorite movie of all time.
126;I got such a deal for it.
127;I am very satisfied with this product
128;I am a huge fan of Richard Linklater and almost all if his films(with the exception of the lackluster Newton Boys and decent but not necessary Bad News Bears remake), so I was excited to see a verison of the movie with interviews with the expnasive cast, commentaries, all the bells and whistles.
129;Well I'm here to tell you Dazed and Linklater fans, Criterion has done their typically exceptional job on this 2.
130;the packaging is excellent, with an extensive booklet made to look like a high school booklet that features excellent essays and interviews with the cast and Linklater.
131;If you are a fan of the movie and want more then this is the best way to go.
132;It is a strong picture in my opinion, but not perfect.
133;for fans of the movie or for fans of the directors other stuff(I hope Criterion continues to work with Linklater on films such as Before Sunrise/ Sunset and Waking Life, because along with this and Slacker they've made me want more)will finally get a version of this excellent movie that is worth adding to your collection.
134;I loved the movie
135;The soundtrack is the best ever produced.
136;The movie is amazingly accurate, both in setting and in portrayal of teen life.
137;Dazed and Confused is an exceptional movie that speaks to anyone who has ever been through high school.
138;You can relate to anyone of the characters in the movie and can understand the struggles they are going through.
139;Solid performances by Jason London and Ben Affleck help bring the story together.
140;This movie should serve as motivation to high schoolers everywhere, to go and have fun.
141;Overall an excellent movie and a definite good time.
142;this brought back high school memories,great sound track if your from them years makes me think about all the rock shows over the years i have seen
143;This is the best film about high school ever made.
144;It is also a great film about America.
145;This proves to be one of its strengths, as it allows Linkletter to focus on his characters.
146;It's a thoroughly enjoyable film, but it's more an experience than a story.
147;And it's an experience you'll want to have again and again.
148;But this film is so much more.
149;The film, otherwise, is a 4.
150;Although the party aspect of this picture is part of its charm, to be sure, what I most appreciate about it is the true character of teen life and 70s period flavor, captured with the help of the most appealing, magical cast this side of American Graffiti, to which this film owes a great deal.
151;But while these are important themes, Dazed and Confused is certainly a very fun, humorous, special movie that should be enjoyed on all these levels (although I would argue that its purpose is not to condone most of the behavior portrayed within).
152;i feel like I'm in an 11.
153;Kind of surprising treatment after the highly.
154;Let's keep our fingers crossed that Criterion will pull through!!
155;The music is incredible and I had to get the soundtrack as well.
156;This Movie has brought back more memories than I ever thought possible.
157;I think you will enjoy it as much as I have.
158;I bought it for the music
159;the plot is so simple it's brilliant, what constitutes one scene in any other movie.
160;Even though it's set in the 70s, it's still remarkably true today.
161;Perhaps the most infamous of them all is the one played by Matthew McConaughey, the creepy older guy still hanging out with the high schoolers.
162;He plays the perv perfectly.
163;The cast is so geniously aware of the vision in this film, that it is perhaps.
164;It's amazing that a movie could liscense so many big names.
165;And the songs are laced throughout the movie so consistantly and precisely that it would keep the viewer entertained even if nobody was speaking in the film.
166;I grew up in the 80s and It makes me wish I was born a decade earlier!
167;extras not so well organized, but cool nevertheless.
168;informative in some aspects of their filmmaking process.
169;This is one of the best films ever made.
170;It documents an era gone by and is a hell of a lot of fun on the ride!
171;In my opinion this was a totally fun movie to watch!
172;You WILL find a good time in this movie.
173;I have it on tape and I must have seen it 100+ times!!
174;All I have to do is list a few of the legendary lines to capture the feeling of this film.
175;Otherwise this is an excellent portrayal of high school life pre Just Say No.
176;its like hanging out with your friends, something timeless and at the same time specific.
177;This movie is so fun.
178;It's one of the best views of high school and does it without pulling any punches.
179;It's real and honest but, still not losing any of the humor.
180;It's got a amazing cast with many roles played by future Stars in their early work.
181;The music, clothes and sets really tie the whole thing together.
182;day teenagers would hit it off well with a movie about the last day of high school in 1976, think again.
183;I loved this movie the first time I saw it, and have seen it four times since.
184;It's just a snapshot of their life, but it's a vivid snapshot and it's one I never tire of looking at.
185;randall Pink Floyd (Jason London) is as close to a protagonist as we get in this ensemble cast.
186;He's a football player and an all.
187;memorable performances come from every single member of this cast .
188;McConaughey has some of the best lines in his movie, including the notorious and oft.
189;quoted, That's what I love about these high.
190;L. i. v. i. n. His Wooderson is slightly sleazy but never creepy and always very cool, and it's a shame that McConaughey made so many bad career choices after this movie, because it's clear here that he has real talent.
191;good seventies movie with good old.
192;If you want a character study of a realistic cross.
193;A must for all fans of Dazed and Confused and top.
194;it was fun but I like Jason London better in some of his other work.
195;At long last, lifelong fans of this cult film from 1993 finally get something worthy of the title Special Edition.
196;While standing out a bit incongruously amongst their other titles by people like Goddard and Kurosawa, this disc is nonetheless worthy of the Criterion moniker.
197;as already mentioned, Criterion has put out the definitive 2 disc edition, complete with a truly superior picture, commentary by the director, 13 deleted scenes (many of which are really good), and then an hour long making of documentary.
198;scopped, a technique that converts live action to animation, and then the special effects can be animated as well.
199;Quentin Tarantino cited it on a list of the 12 greatest films of all time.
200;VB has some great football scenes.
201;Granted, D was more realistic while VB had some scenes of comic relief that verged on the silly.
202;He belongs to a trio of misfits who have banded together.
203;mike: It's what everybody in this car needs is some good ol' worthwhile visceral experience.
204;He was once engaged to Christina Ricci.7.
205;He originated the role of Mark Cohen on Broadway and also played him in the film version.
206;He also appeared in the original Broadway production of 'Six Degrees of Separation' and the film adaptation.
207;It is her red hair and good looks that get them invited to the beer bust by David Wooderson (Matthew McConaughey).
208;tony: Life of the party.
209;She found one herself, and is also officially the Queen of All Nerds, as she is married to Beck.9.
210;Funny thing, though Ben Affleck is the biggest star to participate in 'Dazed and Confused' yet I didn't even recognize him until I saw the credits roll.
211;The fashion, music, cars, and the way things were done back then were crazy.
212;The music brought me way back.
213;This film is a bright spot in mostly pandering world of teen movies.
214;Obviously inspired by American Graffiti , Richard Linklater chose an excellent cast to bring to life his literate and funny script, set on a single day and night in May, 1976.
215;I waited until now to see this movie and I regret not watching it earlier.
216;A hit on 70's teens and their lives.
217;The music of course i could listen to for hours on end!
218;Classic artists classic lines, just a great movie!
219;Since the 70's reflected mostly on dopers, it was a bit hard to relate, but all in all had some really funny moments.
220;Fun to see some of the young actors before they became big stars.
221;The first day I got the tape, I watched it 3 times(not consecutively) and I've watched it countless times since.
222;One if the most quotable movies from the last 20 years.
223;This 1993 comedy/drama inspired the television series That 70s Show, and such films as 54, Go, and Sunset Strip.
224;be stars as Matthew McConaughey, Ben Affleck, Parker Posey and Milla Jovovich.
225;But the true joy of Dazed and Confused is its lovingly detailed recreation of high school life circa 1976.
226;What sets Dazed and Confused apart from similar teenage comedies is the respect Linklater shows for each character .
227;dimensional individuals is a colorful hodgepodge of friends we all had in high school.
228;These kids, for the most part us (if you grew up in the 70s), are likeable, identifiable and at times haunting.
229;like football coach, are the realistic choices faced by most teenagers no matter the year or American locale.
230;n. roll, though all three are prominent factors in this film, their obsessions are with the future and their place in the world created for them.
231;perhaps the greatest success of Dazed and Confused is that it serves as a respectful document to American teenage life.
232;Look closely through the haze of marijuana smoke, bell bottoms and puka shells, and you will see a universal mirror into a youthful past.
233;the performances, almost too many to mention, are uniformly terrific, with exceptional nods to McConaughey, Posey, Rory Cochrane and Wiley Wiggins.
234;Quite simply, Dazed and Confused was one of the most underrated and memorable films of 1993.
235;Dazed and Confused is one of the best movies of all times!This special.
236;edition is a must for me, becuase the case is so awesome and really captures the theme of the movie.
237;Also, it comes with a bonus disk with documentaries and trailers and stuff, which is really cool.
238;This set also comes with the original movie poster!
239;First off, this is a great movie.
240;The script is well written and the humor is the kind of humor that almost anyone can relate to.
241;It's one of the greatest.
242;This Criterion version is the definitive and the best.
243;Great special features, a brilliant commentary and a little fun booklet to go along with.
244;Invest the money, it's worth it!
245;This Criterion edition of Dazed and Confused is very good.
246;The commentary track with Linklater is very informative and entertaining.
247;The deleted scenes are as good as what made it into the film.
248;The featurette on disc two is extremely worthwhile.
249;also, this is one of the greatest movies ever made.
250;like all of the arts, cinema has a history, and an awarenesss of it,going into a theatre, is critical to a valid evaluation .
251;spirited movie, withouthumor, or a point of observation that I could appreciate fromany angle, except this one: Sometimes there are kernels ofhope in even the lowest of appearances.
252;Richard Linklaterand some of the actors have done better work since.
253;This was my first time seeing this movie and it was very well done as well as quite accurate.
254;the second disc kicks off with an impressive, 50 minute retrospective documentary entitled Making Dazed that combines behind.
255;scenes footage from 1992 with the ten.year cast and crew reunion with more recent interviews as well.
256;This is a fascinating look at the challenges that Linklater faced on his first studio movie.
257;Auditions features footage of 12 cast members reading for the film.
258;There is also quite a bit of behind.
259;Finally, there is an impressive 72.
260;And to top it all off a fold out movie poster is included as well.
261;You see stars such as Ben Aff, and Mathew MaC, before they were really stars.
262;This is the greatest movie ever published of high school life.
263;great movie i love this movie i have watched it i don't know how many times i love jason london, i love the story.
264;it is so funny if anyone knows what other movies are good on tj lined of this movie please contact me.
265;Somehow I missed this excellent movie when it was out in theaters.
266;style American Grafitti, but without all the profound life lessons of the original as befits a decade more about fun than changing the world.
267;Great characters, a brilliant turn by Matthew McConaughy, and nothing ever turns out like the Afterschool Special would want it too.
268;this movie basically has no plot, but is really just a great movie about high school, paddling freshmen, and gettin stoned, overall its hilarious
269;Bought it ti share with younger generation of early 20 some year olds that have NEVER seen it.
270;the guys will have a blast watching it.
271;crowd end up at a midnight beer bash.
272;One of my favorites and a must see about American Culture in the 70s.
273;This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I've seen Star Wars!
274;dazed and Confused is great.
275;I've seen this movie more then probably any other movie out there, and I keep enjoying this one, which is quite rare.
276;dazed and Confused is great.
277;I've seen this movie a few times and always enjoyed it because it's the same time frame for me in high school.
278;I definitely recommend it and I am sure I will watch this movie over for many years!
279;All in all, a humorous look at the 70s.
280;First off, this is a great movie.
281;I love it I love it I love it.
282;I compared it with my full screen VHS version!
283;One of these best soundtracks ever the music really fits perfect with the scenes of the movie and really help to compliment it.
284;Got it fast at a good price.
285;this was, is and always will be the best movie ever.
286;Highly recommend it to anyone that went to high school in the 70's, 80's.
287;the clothes the hair just like that year the cars etc. hilarious.
288;barely recongize Affleck he's so you in this movie
289;It shows what it was pretty much like at that time.
290;this has always been one of my favorite movies i watch this movie every summer i used to watch this movie on last day of school all the time just a classic movie.
291;The fashions, the cars, the music .
292;Physical Graffiti style windows on the cover.
293;I love this movie
294;I know it doesn't sound too interesting but it is a hilarious, accurate movie that is suprisingly thoughtful and observational.
295;cAST:Jason London(Randall 'Pink' Floyd): London isn't very funny at all in his role but he is great as the guy who is popular because he gets along with everyone and is laid back.
296;He's the star quarterback and is pressured to sign a pledge not to indulge in sex, alcohol, or drugs all of which he is active in.
297;rory Cochrane(Ron Slater): Cochrane is hilarious as the stoner who goes through most of the movie out of it with his eyes closed throwing out great rambling about weed, sex, aliens and George Washington.
298;sasha Jenson(Don Dawson): I think Jenson gave the best performance as the football player who doesn't care about much of anything except girls and partying and having a good time.
299;Everything he does is hilarious.
300;He has some good lines and I love it when he gets in a fight at the end just because you wouldn't expect it from him.
301;ben Affleck(Fred O'Bannion): I really liked Affleck's also performance because its another one of those you can easily recognize from your own life.
302;eXTRA STUFF: The one liners are classic and the movie is suprisingly thoughtful and contemplative about life and whether you should do what you want or conform for the sake of your friends.
303;fINAL WORD: This is one of my favorite movies and it's sure to bring back memories.
304;I just watched it with my 16 year old son and we both totally enjoyed it!
305;But some of the coming of age moments are still true.
306;Which is why I love this movie.
307;It's quite a movie
308;As one I Love The '90s commentator said, it deals with the high of the last day of school, and the high from smoking all the [narcotics] you can.
309;Wooderson's my favorite character
310;another great aspect of this movie: THE MUSIC!
311;I found it to be quite funny.
312;Dazed and Confused is a great movie and it really represents the '70s and even today's life of many highschool students.
313;On the movie it shows initiations of the freshman.
314;last year I was initiated myself!
315;or just a teenager or anyone who grew up in the '70s, I'm sure you'd love this movie!
316;As another reviewer noted, Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a far superior coming of age film with a lot more believable situations and sympathetic characters.
317;This movie gets it all right.
318;As a child of the 70s, I lived through it all and it's documented very well in this movie.
319;The constant pot smoking, the music, the muscle cars, the clothes, he even nailed obnoxious coaches too.
320;This will be on your top 10.
321;The beginning is classic in itself.
322;with sweet emotion and the sweet car they are driving will catch ur attention and u will be like yeh man .
323;And the black dude with the afro has the best spanking stick.
324;And all this happens very subtlety.
325;And that my friends is the first time it has happened to me with a movie.
326;Because that is how life is unexpected and how some people can surprisingly turn their lives around any day.
327;This was exactly the way I remember it in the 1970's.
328;the movie and extras more than lived up to expectations.
329;The second disc has a ton of interviews, both from the time of shooting and the 10 year 'reunion'.
330;Everyone is classically young and somewhat normal at the cusp of some great careers.
331;They are casual, cocky, tired, nervous, but at the heart of it all entertaining.
332;The deleted scenes were interesting to see and in my opinion the right ones to cut.
333;the book is v. interesting and insightful with some great 'essays' written about the movie, the cast, and more importantly the time that that this movie attempted to portray.
334;the movie itself is great, the criterion collection addition to it just makes it something more.
335;This was a truely amazing transfer, that brings the look the director truely wanted to show us.
336;Very recommending if you like this kind of movie!
337;This is a must see film.
338;its authencity and warmth makes every rainy day to a summer breeze.
339;Its a must see film.
340;And u can take that to the Bank.
341;The Movie brings back the days of my final year in High School back in the 70s, enjoyed the movie very much
342;Many of the actors eventually developed to take on larger roles in the future.
343;I highly recommend this film as it will become a classic for the high school stoner genre.
344;It's just as funny as I remember it.
345;It came quickly, and works perfectly.
346;He doesn't mince words and he certainly tells how it is.
347;the cast is full of really great performances by young actors who actually seem to be channelling real people from 1976.
348;so, wow, yeah, this film fires on all cylinders in creating a very realistic portrayal of that special time in high school.
349;the music is so perfectly tuned to the goings.
350;Plenty of laughs and will probably make you long for the wild days of your irresponsible youth.
351;You just got to keep living, L I V I N
352;Most people under 40 should enjoy this movie.
353;Mary janes beers and Footbal, girls and a new freshman class to haze, what could be better!ben affleck is great!
354;I love this movie it so describes high school in the 70's.
355;A little more drama than what was in my school but still very entertaining.
356;If you were in high school in the late 70's this movie is for you.
357;Dazed and Confused is one of the best films ever made.
358;In particular, it captures the feeling of high school in most any small town in the United States.
359;Nearly every high school archetype is represented in this film, so most people will be able to relate.
360;The documentary that is part of the set is adequate, and it's the reason my rating slipped down to 4 stars.
361;As many others said, this movie is great for the manner in which it captures an era.
362;I was in high school myself in the 70s, and it's amazing how close to home it hits.
363;Most of the actors even look like kids I new back in high school.
364;And one of the best sound tracks I can remember, clearly showing there was more to mid.70s music than Helen Reddy and disco.
365;This film by Linklater is by FAR the best teen flick ever made.
366;linklater must be a genius for compiling something which is BETTER than American Graffiti (for those who are +30!)
367;but me being born in the summer of 1976 makes me somewhat proud that its set in the summer of '76 where wayward teens share a lil' about life, love, drinks, drugs and the most subtle jokes which you just can't stop cracking up over.
368;watch this, and you'll see.
369;There are some mildly amusing moments in the extra features but nothing of substance.
370;(get off of soapbox, pick it up, put it away)Dazed and Confused is a hilarious movie and worth watching every time.
371;So great to see this movie finally get the attention it deserves.
372;But, what really makes this movie work is Linklater's incredible eye for detail, from the pictures pasted to the locker doors to the egg stereo chair to the wry send up of the bicentennial year by one of the homeroom teachers.
373;the characters are drawn from his experiences, to the point he even took many of the same names.
374;How else could one come up with Randall Pink Floyd, the antihero of this film who refuses to sign a paper that demands he won't partake in any illegal extra.
375;What I find even more surprising is how many people don't mind admitting their favorite movie is about sex crazed high school jocks who ride around town searching for young, adolescent boys so they can give them a good homoerotic spanking.
376;It'll remind you of the good old days.
377;I mean, these kids had fun!
378;Oh yeah, and EVERYONE got high.
379;the movie and the situations it displays are pretty much timeless: high schoolers pulling pranks, defying authority, and searching endlessly for something to do.
380;Just a time of more freedom, when rock n. roll, drive.
381;the soundtrack is spot on for a time for me when everything was new, fun, and not jaded.
382;A true portrait of a time that will never be again, not for me.
383;All the more amazing since it was from 1993, but the people behind this film were obviously not.
384;take a trip back in time!
385;Best stoner film of all time!
386;I thought the cast was great and the fashion/music took you back to '76.
387;The music and acting is top notch.
388;This blu ray looks amazing.
389;Great job by Criterion on this transfer and special features.
390;This is the best burn out movie around.
391;I caught it on tv the other night and it made me remeber how much I love it.
392;It's hilarious portrayal of the 70's high school scene has earned it the title of a cult classic with good reason.
393;defintely fun to kick back and watch.
394;Will most likely do buisness with this person again.
395;Although the one I got did not include cover art in the packaging, it still holds a dear place in my heart as one of the best teenage drug dazed days movies ever.
396;Like any good movie, Dazed keeps calling my name when I'm at the video store.
397;Amazing music, amazing actors, amazing story about growing up.
398;It in gulfs you in humor, amazing acting and some great great quotes!
399;Dazed and Confused represents one of the better entries in the film genre fans affectionately refer to as the stoner picture.
400;There are probably many more that I could not recall, but the mother of all stoner films has to be the amazing Over the Edge, a movie notable for showcasing Matt Dillon in his first film roll, but also because of its gritty '70s feel and its wonderful fusion of youthful alienation with suburban sprawl.
401;In that respect, Dazed and Confused, while suffering a few problems, does a nice job of keeping the tradition alive.
402;In the meantime, the gang of jocks and their female counterparts take great joy in engaging in the time.
403;Director Richard Linklater punches up the film with plenty of humor, such as Affleck's over the top role as the school jerk, but he also shows many of these characters worrying and wondering about the future and what it holds for them.
404;Some of these scenes will break your heart.
405;The last scene of the film, with that open road stretching into the distance.
406;really sums up the what this movie is about.
407;i think the viewer who will understand this movie the best will be the person who went to high school and has been out of that place for a period of years.
408;That way you can appreciate the humorousness of the various characters while understanding the implications of their actions.
409;Dazed and Confused is unique because it acurately depicts a time in history.
410;A perfect time capsule of high school in 1976.
411;This movie has it all: Rock music
412;A true definitive edition completed for yet another worthy film.
413;A staggering amount of behind.
414;This movie is a classic it's funny relatable and just plain fun.
415;I enjoy this movie so much.
416;The characters had a perfect blend of post.
417;The movie is an easy 5 stars in my book.
418;release, yeah the Dts 5.1 is great, but sound can only entertain you so much.
419;SO WAIT OUT FOR LATE 2006 it will be worth it!
420;I love it and recommend it!
421;Two thumbs up for sure!
422;So, if you are in the mood for a mind.
423;While that is partially true, this movie is so much greater.
424;i really can't put into words how great the performances of some the actors in this movie are.
425;Just shows signs of what is to come for him.
426;Everybody should see this movie at least once in their life then judge for themselves of how great it is.
427;Great package of inside and background materials on a forever classic.
428;All I'll say is, see it.
429;If you went through middle school or high school anywhere during the 70's, see it.
430;If you grew up in Texas, see it.
431;If you want to see early Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck (in the only role in which I can stand him), see it.
432;If you're just in the mood for a good laugh about what it used to be like to be a teenager, see it.
433;It contains an amazing wealth of added materials that are worth the price by themselves (including original auditions footage
434;i don't think they would have made the end result better by including them but it was fun to see them just the same.
435;it's easy to relate experiences with the characters since they are very close to persons we all knew way back then.
436;those years live not so far away in our hearts and minds.
437;Came quickly and was in perfect condition.
438;Definitely a must see if you grew up in the 70's or 80's.
439;It arrived when it was supposed to and she was delighted to receive it.
440;What a funny and entertaining movie.
441;The fashion, music, language and mood of the movie were right on target with the mood of the 1970's.
442;Now that it is the new millenium, maybe we should take a lesson from the 70's and roll one up, kick back and Have a Nice Day!
443;The acting was great and the music is fantastic.
444;The director and producer have made a classic!
445;life, intelligent, often hilarious movie wins you over with its sheer exuberance and dead.
446;on recreation of the wild and wooly seventies.
447;Director Linklater satirizes the period with considerable affection, so we feel nostalgia for a period many of us thought (at the time) was a mediocre follow.
448;up of seventies rock classics and those distinctive cars add pungent flavor.
449;Posey and Affleck are terrific, but in truth, so is entire lesser.
450;besides that, Dazed and Confused is an extremely well.
451;crafted piece of filmmaking, satirical, funny, with stand.
452;The opening sequence, utilizing Aerosmith's Sweet Emotion to great effect, draws you right into the film completely, and keeps you there until the closing credits finish rolling.
453;This is definitely a good time movie, whether you get dazed and confused yourself or not.
454;and the companion book is a real hoot, too!
455;I can tell you it was just like this.
456;When I watch this I see my youth and my friends.
457;but they were very good days.
458;I remember toking the grass with friends.
459;Hitting the beer bash, crusing the town in some cool cars.
460;I really dig those tight jeans and the long hair.
461;how does it feel watching you youth in such incredible detail?
462;It was after my high school time but I enjoyed seeing young kids go through all that wild and crazy stuff that teenagers do.
463;A beautiful transfer, booklet and poster.
464;It's almost handled in a politically correct manner as the local predator got a phone number during a party rather than take advantage of the red heads vulnerability.
465;Dazed and Confused is a classic as well as an all time great film, with its bell bottoms, polyester clothes, mood rings, and bongs.
466;I think it's an enormously funny and spectacular movie.
467;At least one of my favorites, Its fantastic 70's role's played by Mathew McConaughey, Ben Affleck, Parker Posey, Joe Laurence Adams and Adam Goldberg was dazling.
468;Dazed and Confused has a great sound track to back up its 70's mantality.
469;First off, I love this movie.
470;This film's massive cult following has led to the recent rise in marijuana use among teens in the small town I hail from.
471;The film does depict a nostalgic, care and consequence free look on an era of casual drug use.
472;My jaded side would absolutely relish Linkletter making a sequel to this fine film and re.
473;I really would love to see what happened to them as they matured and became producers (if ever).
474;He wants his characters to tell their stories on their own terms.
475;He, through his camera honestly creates honest and personal spaces.
476;the film is also extremely economical and tasteful.
477;The performances and writing in the film are seemless and natural in their execution.
478;Watch the fine performances of Nicky Katt, Anthony Rapp and Adam Goldberg in addition to the more famous debuts.
479;I especially love the dorky tight shorts and pulled up socks of the super macho football coaches.
480;With the exception of Cameron Crowe's superb Say Anything this is the greatest teen film ever made.
481;love the music and the coming of age story!
482;Always a nice get away on a week night.
483;If you have not seen it in years or never seen it at all, this is a gem, a heartfelt, deceptively simple valentine to youth and the 70's.
484;This is one of the best movies ever made.
485;When I found this version on Amazon I knew I had to have it.
486;The reason Dazed and Confused is so freakin' good is because there is a character that everyone can relate to .
487;There a lot of hot girls and beatiful cars too.
488;Dazed and Confused also helped launch the careers of many of todays top celebrities such as Mathew McCaugnehey,Joey.
489;Love Dazed and Confused good Movie!
490;Love the Cast, and the time setting The Blu Ray is good, good Music in the Movie
491;From THE EMPORIUM to MOON TOWN this movie is full of fun and makes you wish you could have been part of it.
492;Has a great cast and the soundtrack is excellent!
493;It DID have a story line and it DID have a plot.
494;finding out what life after junior high is like.
495;Dazed and Confused is the BEST movie ever!
496;Dazed and Confused is one of my all time favorite movies.
497;Nope!The top spot of cinema ectasy goes to Richard Linklater's simple homage to teenagers on the first night of summer vacation.
498;Richard Linklater more then matches Lucas with probably one of the best films ever made about being a teenager during that nostalgic age that we called the 70's.
499;linklater's script gives us a realistic, yet very funny portrait of a night in the life of these kids.
500;Also,like Lucas's classic, Dazed Confused features a shining young ensemble of actors at the begining of their careers including Matthew McConaughey, Ben Affleck, Parker Posey, Joey Laurence Adams and Adam Goldberg.
501;For a great nostalgic '70s trip, I highly recomend this movie!
502;It's rare that a film captures the transitions that occur between adolescent years and adulthood.
503;Needless to say I would highly recommend this film.
504;it's just about a bunch of high school kids having a good time after the last day of school.
505;to me,this was Matthew McCoughnahay's best part.
506;This was a very good movie!
507;It was mostly what happend in the 70's, the one of the best decades in the century!
508;I reccomend it to anyone who likes great party movies!
509;Bought this as a gift for my sisters boyfriend (22yo) and he loved it.
510;This movie is pure genius.
511;If you've ever had a beer in the back of a pickup truck while the sun starts to set, this is a film for you.
512;And, truth be told, the presentation of this version is excellent.
513;This is far better than THAT 70S SHOW, for example, but it's still utterly ersatz.
514;The film gets the stoner elements just about right (And it's green!)
515;lest I sound TOO cynical, this is a little gem of a film that's well worth seeing, and it will take you back.you'll just never forget that you're watching actors act.
516;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
517;Lots of nobody actors made their break with this movie.
518;The music, the clothes, the partying.
519;Mr. Linkletter hit a home run with this move.
520;I'm not going to review the movie because I've loved it for nearly 20 years and it gets better every time I watch it.
521;The Criterion edition is very nice.
522;The booklet is well done.
523;The articles and the bios are great.
524;I loved getting to see all the deleted scenes, audition footage, and interviews.
525;The Making Dazed documentary was almost as entertaining as the movie itself.
526;Great picture and sound and loads of extras.
527;I have to say this is the best movie ever.
528;It has a great cast and one of the best soundtracks ever.
529;This is an older movie but its funny and everybody needs a good laugh.
530;A good movie, not profound, but definitely entertaining.
531;I order this for me and my boyfriend to watch because he insisted I would just love this movie.
532;I watched it and I loved it!
533;It cracked me up when they would smoke a joint and talk pure s***!
534;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
535;Funny story an ex took my vhs copy of this movie.
536;The book that comes with this is so neat to sit and read.
537;I would recommend this to a friend absolutley
538;Perhaps that is the ultimate truth behind Richard Linklater's gem.
539;This is pretty much where we find the amazing young ensemble cast of Dazed and Confused that includes Ben Affleck, Parker Posey, Cole Hauser, Matthew McConaughey, Adam Goldberg, Nicky Katt, Milla Jovovich, and Joey Lauren Adams amongst others.
540;And they deliver in one classic scene after another.
541;undoubtedly if you watch this movie some of these people will remind you of people you knew, another one of the gifts of the film.
542;This film is a standing reminder to the viewer how wonderful it was to be young.
543;I have not got the movie yet but I have it on VHS, love it and think its a funny movie.
544;Its a very chill movie and makes you remember high school days if you have been out for a while.
545;Dazed and Confused is a great film, with some of the most memorable qoutes ever.
546;The characters are excellent, and the dialogue classic.
547;It takes you back to the 70's, with it's cars, music and clothes.
548;Even if you weren't around then, this film still has the effect of putting you there.
549;There is a point to the film, and the point is that being young is the most fun you'll ever have.
550;I've seen it but it is so funny everytime.
551;its a good vreak from life, a great way to just laugh for a while.
552;this movie is spectacular, i just love it.
553;Dazed and Confused will always stand as one of the most realistic portrayals of high schoolers on the cusp of adulthood.
554;But now you get to see the story behind the scenes.
555;In the Extras, Richard Linklater talks about fighting to keep one of the key elements in the film, the soundtrack that defines a generation.
556;I graduated from high school in 1976 and I recognize pretty much every rite of passage and cultural symbol.
557;As a former DJ, my husband hates when a film misplaces music and he says this is one of the most accurate soundtracks he's seen in film.
558;In almost every scene, I found myself saying Yeah, I remember that!
559;hearted day in the life kind of movie.
560;It brings back memories of the '70's.
561;Anyone who's lived through teen angst will be able to relate to Pink's unwillingness to compromise his principles even though it means the end of his football career.
562;And the fact that the story takes place in the '70's allows for lots of stoner humor and beer bongs.
563;All in all, my favorite film of all time.
564;Impressed with the very fast shipping , this is the best movie ever, brand new, I am a very happy customer and watched it at least a dozen times since getting it.
565;Dazed and Confused is a great movie, one you will want to watch again and again!If you were in junior high (middle school) or high school in the 1970s, you will be able to re.
566;this film gives a good all.
567;this movie was made in the 1990's, but they did a fantastic job of depicting school.
568;life back in the mid.70s. as you continue to watch the movie again and again, you will inevitably have fun repeating the key lines in this movie.
569;, That's why I love those high school girls, man.
570;The music in this movie is GREAT!
571;And unlike most movies about teenagers, you feel like you know these kids and where they will end up in life.
572;for the brat pack crowd, this movie is sure to please people who enjoy the 80's and early 90's coming of age movies.
573;I can't honestly say if those from other generations will enjoy this movie, but it is a hilarious riot (as well as a blast from the past for some of us).
574;Such is the way of life.
575;A real keeper I enjoy every few years.
576;Arrived on time and in excellent shape.
577;I thought the price was really reasonable also .
578;This is a cult classic and is quoted to this day in some sketches(Dave Chapelle) and monologues.
579;Stoner comedy is how to best describe it.
580;I loved every moment in this movie.
581;This movie matches Fast Times at Ridgemont High for its ability to capture what really happens in high school.
582;Its one of those movies that you can watch over and over again!
583;This is a must see for anyone!
584;Dazed and Confused was the best movie I have ever saw.
585;Not only is it a great movie, it has the hottest cars you will ever see.
586;Stick with standard definition and you'll be fine.
587;there's some great actors in this, in the time when some of them were virtual unknowns and the rest were unknowns.
588;This is one of those movies that just gets funnier and better every time you see it.
589;Of course, for the been there done that drugs and alcohol crowd the film rocks, but beyond that it's truly an outstanding film .
590;Interestingly, the film to which I see many compare this .
591;and to which it's definitely comparable .
592;What I love about the film is that, like the Lucas film, it doesn't place any characters above the others, it memorably recreates an era, and Linklater is able to garner strong performances from all of his characters .
593;and by extension, our ability to truly think.
594;Finally, keeping in line with the pedantic nature of this review, my favorite part of the film is the final shot: For the first time in the film we have an overhead shot of the action .
595;Look out the windshield shot and you'll see it's uphill: what was once life in the fast lane becomes a slow ride.
596;And that's why it continues to entertain.
597;And by extension, every generation's high schoolers.
598;linklater is making fun of his characters.
599;:SIMONE: I'm heading this way.
600;Look, I'll probably get, you know, hung up with the guys, maybe, you know, later.
601;but my best argument for this point is the soundtrack.
602;These are all fun tunes (I admit to a certain soft spot in my heart for the beautiful guitar work in Lynyrd Skynyrd's Tuesday's Gone ).
603;In an average movie of this kind (enormous ensemble cast of teenage and twentysomething actors), you'd expect many breakout stars, and many careers to be made.
604;pressed to find a bigger star than Ben Affleck, but the rest of the cast has disappeared mostly without a trace.
605;Wiley Wiggins, as an incoming freshman taken under the wing of the seniors, is very good at showing the awkwardness and potential of his character.
606;Rory Cochrane, who plays a stoner named Slater, carries a lot of comic weight and is the most often quoted character in the cast.
607;He pulls off both aspects.
608;out ramblings are specious at best.
609;high tube socks), the faux.
610;This is by far one of the best teen movies ever, besides American Pie.
611;Slater is the funniest pothead I've seen in a while, and Ben Affleck has one of his first performances in this.
612;Jeremy London is funny and I can't live without this movie.
613;Richard Linklater wrote and directed this tribute to his mid.1970s high school days.
614;Randall Pink Floyd (Jason London) is a handsome, amiable quarterback who gets along with everyone: jocks, stoners, nerds, but is reluctant to sign a no.
615;not a whole lot goes on during this night of revelry and mayhem, but Dazed and Confused does as much to capture suburban teen culture in the 1970s as American Graffiti did for the 1960s.
616;The film was made in 1993 with an ensemble cast of up.
617;coming stars of the 1990s decked out in 1970s attire: Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, Parker Posey, Mila Jovovich, Matthew McConaughey.
618;It's a fun and fond trip back in time to a more laid.
619;This is an absolutely awsome movie.
620;Its all of the great things about being in high school rolled up in to one.
621;What Dazed and Confused does absolutely brilliantly is setup and execute a period (even if it's a recent period) piece.
622;blares great rock tunes from beginning to end.
623;there is a contingent of people who truly love this film, like me!
624;If you're someone who can relate to the characters or lived a similar experience, you're sure to enjoy what Linklater offers up.
625;the technical aspects of the release, however, are excellent.
626;The colors are rich and vibrant, particularly when they're part of a shiny automobile.
627;The audio is crisp and clean and well balanced with the rest of the track.
628;First off, this is the best teen movie hands down.
629;Awesome movie to get drunk to.
630;Hopefully Criterion will release their own edition with commentary and some footage from the 10 year anniversary party.
631;I thought she was very cute in the movie, and I always wondered how she looked now, and if she was in any other movies.
632;This is easily the best teen movie ever.
633;every moment was shot with the greatest of execution and ALWAYS makes you think that you are part of this group.
634;Take a look at the role played by ben affleck too, this is my favorite performance out of him.
635;so mix in a soundtrack with ALL the best songs and some really cool cars, and you have yourself one of the funniest and coolest movies ever.
636;This is my all time favorite movie!
637;its great its funny, and its a classic!
638;It was all about the music and having a good time and not having a care in the world.
639;Living for the moment, See I connect so well with this movie I think that's why I like it so much!
640;So if you love comedies or the 70's get this.
641;Im a 48 year old guy and this movie touched me so much because I swear it is about as accurate as any movie could be about being a teenager an the 70s or 80s.
642;Great classic rock music all through, lots of cool things you probably long forgot about from those days and the actors were awesome.
643;Lots of cool music, musclecars, long hair and a great movie to watch with your child to let them see how times were when you were in high school.
644;Highly recommended and guaranteed to make you think about some great memories.
645;It's pretty cool to see actors like Matthew McConeghy and Ben Affleck before they became famous.
646;It's alot of retro fun.
647;This is a classic 70's stoner flick.
648;A very well written film with a great cast.
649;This movie has plenty of reviews already, but it's worth affirming how good it is.
650;I'm not even into the whole drugs/drinking/partying thing, and I still love this film.
651;But then I came home and watched Dazed and Confused, and it lifted my spirits again, taking me back to a time where that kind of stuff happened, and the people were awesome and weren't in such a hurry all the time and could just kick back and have fun.
652;I did, man, and got 211.
653;, and we see the kids wonder about they're uncertain futures, and have a fun time doing it.
654;It's stoner comedy at it's best, one scene in particular is when Slater (Rory Cochrane) is discussing how cool of a lady Martha Washington was and how she took care of George, is laugh out loud hilarious.
655;This film is hilarious and probably contains something you have seen or experienced in High School.
656;The characters are well represented by the stellar young cast.
657;A great acquisition to fit along side American Pie, Porky's and Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
658;This movie is a classic and any body who loves nostalgic movies this is one for you.
659;funny how times have changed yet stayed the same!
660;This is definatly one that earns my seal of approval.
661;Great movie and I wil see it a million more times before I die.
662;it was definetly a pretty jokes movie, and i thought all of the actors had been perfectly cast for their roles.
663;OK, I'm a teacher and I can definitely appreciate anything that has to do with the last day of school!
664;It's got a great soundtrack too!
665;this film captures the sights , sounds and feelings of that era with an almost eerie realism.
666;Its a real blast from the past for anyone who grew up during the 70's, but that's where it ends.
667;I like the movie for a number of reasons but from a technical, or even artistic standpoint, it is not a good movie, nor is it the funniest movie ever made.
668;Simply stated, it is a piece of nostalgia.
669;Great film (5 stars), however, I was extremely disappointed by this blu.
670;The Criterion Collection edition will feature a high.
671;definition transfer, which this film so greatly deserves.
672;I just saw it and thought it was very good.
673;The Bottom Line:With no plot to speak of, Dazed and Confused lives (and dies) on the charm and affability of its characters
674;And I hope I never hear it again.
675;what's next?Where my school years the best ?
676;The cast make the most of a wonderfull script and Matthew Mccounahry is brilliant.
677;if you love Kevin Smith,you will enjoy this film and love it like your own child.
678;This movie is a great movie.
679;It is one that all kids can relate to.
680;Good growing up/high shool movie.
681;Got for my husband and he loves this movie.
682;Well worth getting or even just seeing.
683;This is a film made in documentary style, a style which gives maximum credibility to the wide and varied selection of characters.
684;Melvin (the black guy) and Hirschfelder (Mitch's chubby friend) are two perfect examples.
685;I'm so impressed with this.
686;the poster was really cool too.
687;I'm only 21 but I would of loved to live in those times (70's).
688;Partying, drinking, smoking and having fun is what its all about.
689;This is one of the best movies to put you in the mood 8).
690;You'll see many known actors of today in their early careers.
691;Until then, I'll give it 3 stars for cool cover art.
692;Just hangin out and it made the movie.
693;The music is great and each song they used personified the scene.
694;it sets the tone for the 70's.
695;he's a hottie, and so funny in this flick.
696;If you like high school stoner movies, this movie is great.
697;Very funny and a great price.
698;The year is 1976 and the town has a bizarre tradition of the seniors.
699;The fact it has no plot sounds like a detriment, but it is the real beauty of the film.
700;The movie is quite funny, but not in a slapstick manner.
701;The humor is subtle and the writing is razor sharp.
702;The film is also notable as many of the cast have gone on to bigger things.
703;Ben Affleck, Matthew McConaughy, Adam Goldberg, Milla Jovanavich Parker Posey all appear as do actors like Jason London, Rory Gallagher, Cole Hauser Michelle Burke who you may not know by name but will recognize by face.
704;The movie is chock full of 70's rock classics and the clothes, cars, hair and settings are quite authentic.
705;This truly is an excellent movie, as well as an accurate description of a teenagers life.
706;It's a hilarious movie, and one I can (and do) watch again and again.
707;They will really realize how teen life is.
708;While Dazed and Confused is not among the most influential, ground breaking movies ever, it's one of the loosest, most fun movies ever.
709;For a movie that doesn't feature much of a plot, it's a compliment that this movie is so great.
710;And hey, while that's true, you have to love Dawson's reply of getting the most out of High School as well.
711;Great messages embedded within, and it's stuff that I already knew.
712;it's just great to hear it among this movie.
713;but it's also a whole lot of fun, which helps it stand out a lot (much how Heathers stand out with it's use of Black humor).
714;and features cool cars, sheer fun, drinking, and great dialogue, all the while making one of the coolest movies out of one day, which, as everybody and your mother knows, the last day of school.
715;But when the moods hits, nothing is quite as fun and satisfying as reliving the last day of High School with these people.
716;, the cars are great, and who doesn't love watching Fred get pissed off or going along for a ride of Baseball mailbox (or whatever it's called)?
717;richard Linklater is something special, and being part of the VCR generation of film makers like the great one, Smith, and Anderson, safe to say, what a cool batch of directors.
718;See it with a bud, and get Dazed, man!CHARACTERS 10/10PLOT 8/10DIRECTING 9/10DIALOGUE 9/10STYLE 10/10
719;Because the teen years are a joke to begin with, even tragedy seems perversely amusing through the looking glass of time.
720;The patter is accurate with stoner kids talking like black folks sort of.
721;One of the last scenes, a romance on a blanket was unexpected, and I will not spoil it.
722;No, not much, but film is amusing at times, and it certainly nails a time and place.
723;Watch for future stars like Ben Affleck.
724;for anyone who was a youth in the 70s, this movie will bring it all back.
725;the ultimate funny and close to the bone high school party movie.
726;matthew mconnaughey is hilarious as a high school hanger on
727;It's like funny with out the usual American corn.
728;Dazed and Confused is a great cult classic coming of age movie with a superb cast.
729;You will love every moment of this movie if you've seen it or not, young or old.
730;This is a great movie, I love it.
731;Dazed and Confused, considered by some to be the greatest high school/'70s comedy of all.
732;time, follows the lives of these students during a memorable 24.
733;like many of Richard Linklater's films, Dazed And Confused is an ensemble piece with little plot.
734;Randall Pink Floyd (Jason London) is a star football player and rising senior trying to decide whether to play by team rules or rebel .
735;among the talented cast, Wiggins, Affleck and McConaughey stand out.
736;As the idiotic O'Bannion, Affleck hilariously captures the meathead mentality.
737;But the real star is McConaughey in an uproarious role as smooth stoner David Wooderson.
738;Here, though, he exudes charisma and steals scene after scene with lines like, That's what I like about these high school girls, I keep getting older, they stay the same age.
739;Dazed will undoubtedly have you reminsincing about the glorious high school years.
740;But Linklater also invests the film with some subtle philosophical questions that are surprising to find in a nostalgic comedy like this.
741;After a wild night of partying, Pink remarks to his friends, All I'm saying is that if I ever start referring to these as the best years of my life .
742;Dazed and Confused has gained a well.
743;deserved cult following as one of the greatest party films of all.
744;Lack of plot aside, this is a riotously entertaining flick that's guaranteed to generate a ton of laughs and get you into the party spirit.
745;It is amazing in 2003 to realize that when DAZED AND CONFUSED it was filmed with a cast of unknown actors and actresses.
746;That is a lot of talent for a low budget film featuring a group of unknowns.
747;Even Wiley Wiggins, who winsomely plays Mitch Kramer, one of the new freshmen and who has been in few films since, managed a memorable turn as the real life model for the animated main character in Linklater's superb WAKING LIFE.
748;all this talent combined with a great script means one of the best films about life in high school ever made.
749;the greatest thing about this film is the way it takes you back to high school, even if that has been quite a few years.
750;A great moment from a great teen film.
751;Granted, the hazing was pure invention (who knows, maybe it did occur in Linklater's town), but the demeanor, the pent.
752;I watch it sometimes to remember that period of time, which, compared to the ultra.
753;modern times we live in (including the very means by which we are communicating right now) seems so innocent and full of hope.
754;It's a fun movie, great adaptation to the 70's and kind of reminds me old school times.
755;A great movie to watch.
756;It will bring you back to your reckless teenage years and make you feel young once again.
757;I've watched it about 50.60 times, still I just want to rewind and see it again at once!
758;The atmosphere in D C is enormous!
759;, yeah I know it's it's a typical stoner movie but still I find it's a great movie.
760;the setting: summer of 1976.
761;with an awesome soundtrack to boot, this film is a definite must see!
762;Dazed and Confused is smart, funny, and honest.
763;The first time you watch it you will be entertained.
764;Upon each successive viewing you will discover more elements of the fine storytelling, character development, and nuanced commentary on the dynamics of adolescent development in the ubiquitous setting of a boring, suburban, football.
765;Though it's fun to watch this filim with friends and maybe have a beer or two to feel some of the buzz that the characters have practically thoughout the story, it's also a good idea to watch this film attentively.
766;There's a lot to see.
767;In the most interesting one, an argument on the Vietnam War ensues between Pink, the protaganist we love, and Benny, his one.
768;But this one is a really good edition, there is no need for another edition to come out now.
769;This movie perfectly captures sort of a lost era in the US.
770;It's easily one of the ten best comedies about high schoolers and is very funny in some scenes, yet very poignant in others.
771;Wanna come?Shotgun!Kegger tonight at the Moon Tower!This is easily a cult classic!
772;It is my favorite party movie.
773;All these characters share a common goal: What do you want to do?
774;Dazed and Confused came out about 1993.
775;What makes this film work so well is that the 24 main characters are all unknown actors (at the time).
776;which makes this film, all the more, precious and a gem to get lost in.
777;I love McConnahey's approach when he says All right!
778;This is truly a fun party movie to have on with friends over (you know, the 30+ crowd).
779;Linklater really captured the essence of the moment.
780;This film might just serve to please a small specific age group, just like American Graffiti, and The Big Chill.
781;This film also comes in the new 5.1 stereo sound.
782;These are two excellent films to have together.
783;And I understand that this movie will be on Blu.
784;Dazed and Confused is a fantastic comedy that's equal parts funny, insightful, and feel.
785;The Criterion edition does a fantastic job with the transfer, also packing in a ton of extras, including a poster and a companion booklet.
786;own for true fans of the movie.
787;It is compelling to watch the greatness simmer, and seeing a bit of today's mega stars in nursery schoolThe music is awesome, I could smell the dope , and still feel that this is such an important part in expanding one,s mind
788;This movie is a CULT CLASSIC and I was excited to see the Criterion Collection at such a good price!
789;IMO, this movie is right up there with The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller's Day Off 
790;This is one of those movies that captures exactally how I perceive the mid 70's to be.
791;This film is about, well, graduation night and future freshmen and seniors.
792;The line up is an all star cast of who's who in movies.
793;this is a film that takes a comedic, yet precise look at life in 1976.
794;The music is absolutely awesome and the dialogue will keep you laughing from beginning to end.
795;If you enjoy great humor pick this one up.
796;Outstanding classic rock album with some great tunes on it.
797;aside from that, Ted Nugent's Stranglehold has long been a favorite of mine, and Lyrnyrd Skynyrd's Tuesday's Gone has a special kind of feel to it, no matter how many times you hear it.
798;thrown in for good measure, and for the free.
799;wheeling kind of fun that the film itself reflects, we have Rick Derringer's Rock and Roll Hootchie Koo.
800;also, you just gotta love the tagline on the album, The Film Soundtrack Everyone Will Be Toking About.
801;this movie is pretty cool.
802;the plot is really straightforward, this movie is extrememly easy to follow.
803;it is sidesplitting funny, yet at the same time carries another feeling with you i've yet to come to a name for.
804;this movie really got me thinking about how life has changed from back then until now.
805;and i loved every minute of it.5 stars.
806;I loved this movie so much the first time I seen it that I decided I had to own it.
807;It really brings back my own high school years.
808;My love for this film is the love of nostalgia.
809;I also grew up in Texas so there is that supporting my interest in this film.
810;the characters are true to life.
811;The simplicity of the story is marvelous and Linklater works small wonders within this setting.
812;There is a beautiful moment which occurs between an elderly married couple and the rebellious quarterback Randall Pink at the conclusion of a little league baseball game which conveys something of the nature of Texas.
813;For me this is a highlight.
814;still Dazed and Confused is a fine film.
815;This is a classic and funny movie.
816;It has a great soundtrack and is a definite one to watch at some point in your life.
817;Brings back high school in a fun memorable way!
818;That's the kinda people I was telling you about!
819;This is one of my favorite movies.
820;Classic music and entertaining characters.
821;This is a movie I can watch over and over.
822;For those of us that grew up in the mid or late 70's Jr and Sr high, You'll LOVE this movie and it will remind you of the days when you actually knew someone like each character in this movie!
823;It's a hilarious movie and you will be amazed at how many famous stars were in this movie!
824;Loved it So like how it was when I went to school!
825;My grown kids love the movie too!
826;Exactly the way I remember it around my own Town back in the early 70's !
827;Has some great Muscle Cars in it also!
828;The music is great too!!
829;The cast is fantastic a s well.
830;If any movie has ever captured my high school daze, its this one.
831;We also must remember the ever present cruising scenes (riding shotgun) and all the great music.
832;I went to school with all of these people, and i love being able to remember each and every one of them.
833;It was so great, if you love old movies, this one is a great one!
834;insane cast featuring future stars and an amazing soundtrack.
835;This film has a great performance by Matthaew McConnaghey when he was a ggod young actor,before he became a hack leading man, and then rediscovered himself recently as a great character actor
836;All the characters are realistcally drawn, with consistently good acting.
837;I'd compare this movie to American Graffiti, except it's funnier.
838;Both movies used a stellar cast of young actors and both went to a lot of trouble to get all the details of the particular time period right.
839;When you see a movie like this you realize how all the mega.
840;That's my only criticism, and it's still an easy 5 star movie.
841;I got this movie for my boyfriend because our vhs copy won't play.
842;I love watching this movie.
843;I wasn't born till the early 80's, but it seems like a lot of fun back in the 70's.
844;I hope I got the year right.
845;I enjoy watching the teens getting high and drink.
846;Having the time of their life.
847;If you are looking for a movie to put you in a good mood this is the one.
848;There are bonus features galore, and even a Dazed and Confused poster to put in your locker at school.
849;Watch it again, if it's been a while.
850;And anytime I get to see Jason London on screen is a good time.
851;This is a classic along the lines of Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Clueless.
852;see with an AMAZING cast of actors, many of whom went on to have truly outstanding careers!
853;i did not particularly enjoy the film but I enjoyed the bonus material somewhat.
854;There is also audition footage, scees frotm the 10th anniversary reunion and a documentary on the film's production.
855;I always thought I was born later than I should of been.
856;Cute Movie, reminds me of when I was growing up in the 70's.
857;It was a cool way to see ourselves as we were in the 70s.
858;And hooking up with buddies with cars was the right thing to do.
859;cool flick for dates, parties, and just remembering what teenage life was like back in the 70s.
860;I still laughed out loud.
861;Now, I'm a senior in college, and this movie still defines my life.
862;The characters are so real.
863;This movie makes me smile, and sometimes cry when I'm really drunk.
864;An excellent soundtrack (both of them) but I wish the Dylan song would have been on there.
865;it's one of my few favorite movies to get blazed out of my mind and watch.
866;one of my favorite lines: you got a joint, man?
867;well, it would be a lot cooler if you did.
868;This has to be one of the most overrated films from the 90s!
869;Probably the best aspect of this movie is the soundtrack, but it is NO where near a classic movie that people claim it is.
870;I was actually kind of turned off by it.
871;Painful to see act on the screen.
872;No witty lines, jokes, characters or story to make it great like Jerry's show.
873;The closest true to what I remember teen life stories that made sense, told a good story and had great music.
874;Richard Linklater's first picture, SLACKER, made on a shoestring, earned him a lot of attention, and he somehow managed to persuade Universal Pictures to spend $6 million on his sophomore effort, DAZED and CONFUSED, which follows a group of two dozen suburban Texas kids on the last day of high school in 1976.
875;Both of them are ensemble pieces introducing a slew of talented young actors
876;wall scores of golden oldies.
877;but the differences between the two movies are striking as well.
878;the performances are persuasive down to the smallest part, and Linklater has a fine ear for the unexpectedly loopy turns of phrase that make these teenagers come to life.
879;It was great then and it's still great now.
880;Very good movie with a ton of extra features on the Criterion edition.
881;One of my all time favorite movies.
882;Great cast, most of them before they became big stars, great music, awesome reproduction of an earlier age.
883;just love this movie great cast too.
884;Product arrived shortly after ordering it, in great condition, and at a great price.
885;This is a great movie that is probably one of Ben aflecks best ever.
886;Plus if you like gto's then the cars are pretty good too
887;The film does a wonderful job of capturing the atmosphere of the late Seventies!
888;In fact the soundtrack is so good it sometimes distracts you from the film which you will want to watch more than once.
889;Have always loved this movie, now even more.
890;Great extras, a cool poster comes w/ (made by Frank Kozik if you know him).
891;American Pie is hilarious, but it's too bogged down by clich s. Dazed and Confused , however, finds the perfect middle ground.
892;The story itself is very simple, yet captivating and intriguing.
893;depth character study, and a great teen comedy.
894;That captures how these kids feel about school, and about life.
895;Cause hey, you want the best years of your life, forget high school.
896;I love movies to do with partying and rock 'n roll.
897;Even if you don't like Jeremy, you will still love this movie!
898;I bought this for my son and he made me watch it with him.
899;One of my new all time faves!
900;God Damn this really is one HELL of a great movie.
901;This movie always puts me in a good mood.
902;I love those red heads manThe music is the balls, and the plot is excellent.
903;Allright, so there IS no plot but its still great!
904;You gotta do what Randall.
905;This one is a lot more INDIE but an equally entertaining film.
906;LINKLATER writes excellent dialouge in that one too.
907;This is a great movie that really makes you wish you could go back to high school.
908;This film takes a pretty realistic look at life as a worthless teenager.
909;is a wonderful way to conclude the message of this film: the open road of life is right before us, and it is our jobs to make sure ours is a fullfilled journey.
910;A enjoyable flick for people who grew up in the 70's.
911;Dazed and Confused is my all time favorite movie.
912;It may not be a masterpiece, but I think it is brilliant.
913;i've just received this item today.
914;I have full confidence that it will be well worth watching.
915;It also came with a really cool poster for the movie, and the little yearbook full of articles and stories is a very interesting read.
916;This movie is so great.
917;That particular time was magic and the film totally gets that across.
918;Parker Posey, Ben Affleck, Matthew McConaughey were just a few great actors who appeared in this and I bet had the time of their lives filming this.
919;One question: Where is the beautiful and very talented Michelle Burke been?
920;This movie is so cool!
921;The characters are really cool.
922;And the actors actors are cool, and everybody is really really funny!!!!
923;I will definatley be watching this movie more and more and more!!
924;Telling the broad story of how high school students feel, while getting equally involved which each character really makes this movie unique and special.
925;It's the essential guide to life.
926;It makes it 100 times better.
927;good things to do while watching this movie:Count how many times Mitch Kramer touches his nose in the nose.
928;saying, look at the blood stains right there and Are you cool man.
929;singing to sweeeeeeeet emmmmmoooootions, slooow ride, freeeee ride.
930;count how many times Man is said.
931;to my mind, Dazed and Confused is one of the best high school comedy.
932;dramas, along with 1982's Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
933;The difference between these two films is that Fast Times contains more goofy antics whereas Dazed is more of a docudrama with amusing flashes.
934;top parts with Spicoli, Dazed and Confused is more like a slice from real life.
935;what makes Dazed work so well is that it gets the LOOK of the mid.
936;In fact, a large part of the film's success is the excellent casting choices.
937;comers here: Matthew McConaughey, Milla Jovovich, Ben Affleck and one or two of lesser note (as far as future popularity goes).
938;because it successfully takes you back to the high school years with all its joys and agonies.
939;life film than a plot.
940;The message is that school's out and it's time to celebrate!
941;tight pants must be put on with pliers and the help of a friend, be true to yourself, etc.
942;I love his laugh and he has the most classic lines in the movie.
943;I have seen it so many times and it still gets funnier.
944;Not to mention the awesome songs on the movie.
945;It's one of my favorite teen comedies.
946;Dazed and Confused is definitely a cult classic, and a movie I could watch easily over a million times.
947;Even though it's about the END of the school year, it's still fun to watch whenever.
948;Oh, and Slater is my favorite character by far.
949;The soundtrack is AWESOME as well, featuring songs by: Aerosmith, Foghat, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Alice Cooper, Ted Nugent, War, ZZ Top, Peter Frampton, KISS, Steve Miller Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd to name a few bands.
950;this is, hands down, one of the greatest teen movies ever made.
951;People who grew up in the 70's claim this movie captures the time perfectly (just read some of the reviews here!)
952;, and this movie is definitely a must see.
953;It'll make every young viewer wish they were there partying and having a good time, and every adult remember the good times they had during their teenage years.
954;this is the best movie ever created ever and i love that i now have it and can watch it whenever
