id;spiegazione
1;I saw this movie on HBO a couple of days ago and I really enjoyed it.
2;It really shows the vapidness of the SoCal culture.
3;the actors are unknown and do a great job.
4;I was surprised about how much I really liked it.
5;I will say the movie takes about a half hour to develop before the take the kid hostage but in doing so it is set up really well and there is a good reason behind the kidnapping.
6;Both fought the other and one broke into the others house and there you go the reason for the kidnapping.
7;I thought Justin Timerbaland did a great job acting in this movie and I know a lot of people hate on him because he is a singer.
8;I am going to go with a 4 out of 5 stars and a strong recommendation to get this movie.
9;if you can stand M. f. ing language as rank as Snoop Dogg on speed, ALPHA DOG is a really good movie filled with great performances by a huge cast including Sharon Stone, Harry Dean Stanton, Bruce Willis, Emile Hirsch and Justin Timberlake.
10;aLPHA DOG is based on a real case in Southern California that played out in the late Nineties and early part of this decade
11;on with liberty to fictionalize, telescope or rework: the classic as based on tale.
12;True to life, the last several minutes of the film touch upon six or seven years of flights, trials, persecutions and imprisonment of so many young people portrayed in the movie.
13;this is quite a good film IMO and Nick Cassavetes has the best of both worlds: in terms of repertory and acting he has some of the best actors around and lets them grow (Sharon Stone is especially effective as a luxury.
14;what, but is the structure of our society visibly eroding?About my only gripe is that the film is in widescreen and, ironically, that director Nick Cassavetes uses it so well .
15;go for it, and IMHO you'll have gone for the better option.
16;It was a true story and the actors played in it was really great .
17;The movie was great up until the end.
18;My sister had seen it and loved it and said that I had to watch it but refused to tell me much of anything about it.
19;the film, advertised more like a party film, has its fair share of teen debauchery that is sure to catch the eye of many rebellious teenagers today.
20;the film has yet another surprise in store for the audience, and that is an impressive performance by pop.
21;Buffed up and tattooed out, Timberlake embodies Frankie Ballenbacher with such charisma and natural charm.
22;zone, which is good because the final scene between him and Timberlake is all the more heartbreaking with both actors on point.
23;Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone take a backseat to the youths in the cast, Ben Foster included who continues to prove he is a very talented actor.
24;It's flawed, sure, but it has a message and director Nick Cassavetes does a great job of delivering it.
25;What Cassavetes has done here is create a very alarming character study of a certain subculture of youths today.
26;Cassavetes did a great job of sticking to the facts, even with the inclusion of witnesses who saw the kidnapping take place.
27;Once I started to watch it, I thought.
28;but then 'Zach' gets kidnapped and all of a sudden, you remember that this is based on a true story and you start to really pay attention.
29;And that's a good thing because that's when it pulls you in and doesn't let go until the end.
30;Zack is OK with being a hostage .
31;alpha Dog is a remarkable film, but to tell the truth .
32;Nick Cassavetes did a great job, but still Larry Clark's movies, for instance, have a greater impact on you.
33;Sometimes a good movie can come out of nowhere and really surprise you, even when you've read the description for said movie beforehand and get a picture in your mind what the plot is going to be like.
34;There's lot of fighting going on ALL the time.
35;Just about every sentence you will hear them.
36;but what made the story so interesting was how a good amount of time was devoted on the main characters, so you always know who was who.
37;When the one guy gets kidnapped, you'll be surprised how he reacts to it, and what happens at the end of the film.
38;You'll be pretty shocked at what you're seeing.
39;The fact that the story is true makes the movie more disturbing.
40;The visuals are great and the story and acting is very good.
41;The lead character is a wimpy coward and Timberlake plays it well.
42;I really loved this movie!
43;Alpha dog has a great story, mostly very good acting and some really memorable moments.
44;justin Timberlake was very good here .
45;to my great surprise .
46;but the show belongs to Ben Foster.
47;His Jake Mazursky is one of the most charismatic villains ever seen on film.
48;This movie keeps you into it from beggining to end!It's a drug dealing movie where this dude owes the drug dealer money.
49;But at the end of the movie, the ending is bitter sweet.
50;The kids are the most riveting here, and the limited vocabulary they employ is very close to real.
51;It's a really great movie.
52;It is based on a true story.
53;This is a must see.
54;The lucky thing is the story (paralleling the real life SoCal drug dealer Jesse James Hollywood) is riveting.
55;a terrific, if flawed, movie.
56;The movie was well written for the times.
57;Enjoyed the actors and their ability to true to the characters.
58;Justin Timberlake was awesome as usual!
59;My favorite parts of true stories is the ending when it tells you what happens to each character.
60;Definitely a movie for the collection!
61;This is a film with possibly some of the best actors in the business.
62;firstly the Hostage of this movie, Zack (Yelchin) seems more than welcome to being kidnapped by these men and shows that he's fine with the situation.
63;this is a surprisingly good movie that depicts the mindset that some of the younger generations have towards life, no matter how privileged their background may be.
64;sensically but towards the middle the plot starts to make sense as it becomes a movie about morals, friendship and trust.
65;The most surprising thing is, is that this film is based entirely around true events which is a bit upsetting but again a true depiction of the lives of some young generations in suburbia.
66;ray version that's released in the UK.
67;It felt chopped up as I read the book.
68;This film is based on a true story, and it's heartbreaking.
69;What makes this movie worth seeing?
70;I cried the first time I watched it.
71;It's worth watching, it really is.
72;ALPHA DOG is a strong film that reminded me of a film called BULLY that was similar, but not given much publicity.
73;ALPHA DOG is a frightening film based on a true story and its greatest gift is its closeness to reality and how kids go through life thinking with blinders on.
74;He was probably the most interesting character in the film.
75;He walks through the movie with an unabashed intensity that explodes at will.
76;fortunately though, this movie is given its life by Nick Cassavetes' screenplay and direction, a solid young cast (including a solid performance by Justin Timberlake) and a solid veteran cast.
77;alpha Dog is a really good film and a lesson in life and its undeniable consequences.
78;Also goes to show that drugs are so not cool.
79;first, I'll start with the acting.
80;But for people, the big question mark is Timberlake, since he was an Nsync member and seems to want to be the next Michael Jackson but here he's actually quite good, playing a character who's both clueless yet seems to be the only one who has a conscience and good sense around him.
81;The acting, plot and story line are well connected and compelling.
82;Not for children, however a captivating movie for adults.
83;I actually chose to watch it with my teenage son, because I felt that it was important to expose him to this sad truth.
84;My son and I fully enjoyed it and have since lent it out to friends.
85;A frightening movie worth your attention.
86;A lot of aspects of this film surprised me beginning with Justin Timberlake's performance.
87;excellent work, I only hope he continues to do more edgy work like this and doesn't return to pablum.
88;otherwise a slick and jarring indictment of modern youth (and especially white, privledged) culture.
89;It was very interesting watching the true story of the fate of a young man.
90;Bad acting but good storyline, wait till the end.
91;I have yet to figure out why people feel it is their right to give away the entire plot of a movie in their reviews.
92;this is an underrated movie that will keep you thinking about it long after you're finished watching.
93;Perhaps exaggerated in spots, but I was entertained throughout the entire film.
94;I thought Timberlake would annoy me, but he actually played a decent role here.
95;teens smoking, drinking, partying and fighting.yup that pretty much sums it up.
96;This movie is a classic.
97;A very sad, yet true to life movie.
98;I believe it is good for all to watch, to grasp reality of the reality of this world.
99;And, how well they get so many points across about the realities of life.
100;This is a really good movie.
101;I totally recommend this movie to everyone.
102;When I got this movie from amazon I went to my room and watched it right away that's how good the movie is.
103;So because the film is based on a kidnapping/murder that actually occurred, writer/director Nick Cassavetes lets this riveting story play itself out.
104;and fully incorporate a very real human component in the process.
105;The inevitable is very disturbing and painful to watch, but it is also riveting and acutely compelling.
106;everything about ALPHA DOG is riveting, from direction to dialogue (which is very realistic).
107;The large cast excels
108;Veterans Bruce Willis, Harry Dean Stanton, and Sharon Stone appear in supporting roles.
109;stone (in a fat suit and virtually unrecognizable) particularly memorable as the subject of the mock interviews.
110;It will stick with you long after you have finished watching it and you will be surprized at what a good job all of the actors in the film did.
111;Alot was put on Justin Timberlake's shoulders since his character, Frankie is very central to the story and he did a very fine job.
112;He has alot of charisma and it comes across in his relationship with the young victim, Zach, played by Anton Yelchin who also did a wonderful job.
113;It is the basis of this relationship that makes this movie so powerful and poignant.
114;nteresting story that really captured my attention, It develops most of the characters very well and shows the ugly side of drugs and negative family influences.
115;I gotta say that the main character was extremely foolish and childish and i find it very hard to believe that he got along so well with his kidnappers .
116;It gets to a point when they actually become friends and the kidnappers are surprised as to why they are going to be arrested.
117;i really enjoyed the actors in the story though.
118;I recommend this movie a lot.
119;After watching it, turns out it's better than I thought.
120;It's inspired by a true story and it reminds me of Bully but without the unnecessary, overexposed nudity.
121;I actually favored their decision to mark every witness that saw the hostage with the captors.
122;The acting was pretty good but the entertainment value could've been better.
123;it is based on true events.
124;He is actually a pretty good actor.
125;He can swear a meanstreak!
126;this is an insane film!
127;if you like fast, swear filled films with lots of drinking, drugs, fights, and sex involving young beautiful people, this is right up your alley!Stars include Bruce Willis, Justin Timberlake, and Harry Dean Stanton.
128;This movie features an impressive cast, excellent acting, and is based on a true story.
129;I accidentally bought the widescreen version.
130;Shawn Hatosy is sexy as the abused and beguiled.
131;The dialogue is a revelatory insight into the airheaded inhabitants of LaLa Land.
132;Alpha Dog is full o whit and wisdom, facts and fiction.
133;I really loved this movie.
134;I didn't expect the ending and was moved by the performance of all the actors.
135;keep up the good work
136;I didn't go into this movie expecting much, if anything really, in the way of a decent plot or convincing acting, but the film turned out to be actually very well done.
137;Both Justin Timberlake and Anton Yelchin, who is turning out to be quite a talented actor, put on good performances.
138;Overall, I was very pleased with the pacing and end result of this film, and it's certainly worth consideration for addition to my collection.
139;ALPHA DOG is a tough movie to watch and to review.
140;old kid by his peers is captured in an intense manner by writer/director Nick Cassavetes in the way he has cast, directed, and propelled this story of the infamous Jesse James Hollywood to the screen.
141;They make a fine ensemble cast, especially the despicable characters they are asked to portray.
142;Interesting movie based on the real life case of Jesse James Hollywood one of the biggest young lowlifes you'll ever see.
143;Having seen various news segments on Unsolved Mysteries and America's Most Wanted, I felt I had a decent background on what to expect here.
144;In the end though Cassavetes does a good job of showing his own interpretation of what happened.
145;In fact he's perfect for this role Frankie Ballenbacher.
146;He is brash, arrogant, a loudmouth but can also be serious in his songs and interviews.
147;He plays this role as best as anyone could playing a real punk who thought.
148;He is seen hanging out with Jessie's friends and blonde bimbos.
149;summing up then, Alpha Dog is a decent recollection of the events about the real life kidnapping/murder case of Nick Markowitz.
150;Director Nick Cassavetes' gritty drama exploring the infamous case of Jesse James Hollywood, named Johnny Truelove in the film, is hit.
151;Alpha Dog is one of the better films I've seen in 2007.
152;There is no central character as such but most characters are rather absorbing.
153;Bruce Willis has no role in the film, Justin Timberlake was actually good but the most harrowing of acts was done by a man called Ben Foster.
154;his act in the film is great.
155;Ben Foster is very convincing as Jake Mazursky in this film.
156;He's a little mad in the film, likes to take fist shots at people, will go to any length to procure drugs and to save his job.
157;Alpha Dog is worth watching .
158;it's a pretty good tale of how things go wrong and is reminiscent of films like Juice, 11:14 and Bully .
159;Well acted, well directed film about the real life events that took place.
160;The writing in this film is great.
161;I don't think that the directing was the best and I can certainly see that there was much more to this based on a true story movie that ended up on the editing floor.
162;life spontaneous kidnapping of a 15.
163;justin Timberlake, playing Franki, Anton Yelchin, as Zack, and Shawn Hatosy, as Elvis, give the movie's strongest performances.
164;This is a great true story.
165;I purschased it for Justin's acting.
166;which was very well paced .
167;This is a movie for somber reflection, and appreciation of the actors who tackle such difficult challenges.
168;Additionally, Ben Foster as strung out Jake Mazursky is absolutely entrancing.
169;He owns the character, displaying fearlessness, a manic behavior and crazed mood swings.
170;A stunning performance to be quite honest.
171;Finally, Anton Yelchin as Zach Mazursky provides a much needed softer side, a sentimental edge that makes the tragedy in this movie, and the source material realism, so much more moving.
172;Alpha Dog is a nice surprise, and exposes everything offensive about the criminal and drug lifestyle.
173;Alpha Dog is a really great movie.
174;Emile Hirsch did a great job as always and for you Justin Timberlake fans, this was a really good performance by him.
175;JT is the man in this, and the nice guy.
176;This film is based on Jesse James Hollywood case in real life.
177;The film takes place in the year 1999 and the director really captures it.
178;The film feels very real.
179;Timberlake and the Jesse James H. character treat him with a good time with girls, beer, marijuana, and parties.
180;There are actors here that will bring in both those who prefer established Hollywood as well as young, pop stars with names familiar to the younger set.
181;Some have roles that are little more than cameos but it is fun to try to pick them all out.
182;She's quite believable in a family dinner scene, then over the top and practically unrecognizable at the end of the film when trying to express the mother's feelings about the crime.
183;If I have to choose the only actors that stood out to me were Justin Timberlake, Bruce Willis, and Ben Foster who done a great job with his out bursting role.
184;Timberlake gets across just the right mix of charm and dimwittedness to totally convince us in this film.
185;timers who together enjoy the spoils of Johnnys illict mini.
186;emile Hircsh is believable in the title role.
187;Great movie with great actors, I like how they put the real witnesses at the bottom of each screen when they are introduced into the plot.
188;The movie is, essentially, an independent drama but received a wide release since Justin Timberlake is in it and his album FutureSex/LoveSounds was at the top of the charts when the film finally got distribution.
189;It didn't do well in the theatre, hasn't clicked that much with audiences, but it is a pretty good film.
190;cause that's pretty much who the character is.
191;Timberlake is more than decent as an actor and gives one of the best performances in the movie.
192;The real star here is Ben Foster.
193;While some could say his performance gives new meaning to the term over.
194;acting, it's still absolutely brilliant and he keeps your eyes glued to the screen whenever he appears.
195;His mother is actress Gena Rowlands and his father is John Cassavetes, one of the most acclaimed writer/directors of all time.
196;I think a lot of people who aren't expecting much from this film will be pleasantly surprised though.
197;Also, look for some interesting acting bits by Bruce Willis, Sharon Stone, and Harry Dean Stanton, who steals every scene he's in.
198;in the eyes of an alpha male, he had to be always right, with a way out of any situation.
199;Truelove was above all,and acted so.
200;the teenager is treated well, till the discovery that the Stolen Kid, will get them a jail sentence.
201;The varying fan bases widen these audience ranges.
202;frankie's final scene with Zack leaves one with a sea of emotions!
203;When a man like Nick Cassavetes, the director of She's So Lovely and The Notebook, stumbles upon the story of Jesse James, the youngest person ever to be featured on America's Most Wanted, you can expect a riveting vision.
204;It's even better when someone gets the guts to tell that vision.
205;In this case, Cassavetes delivers his baby.
206;keyes bring in a great cast but Nick Cassavetes brought them to perfection.
207;Everyone from Bruce Willis to Justin Timberlake delivered breakthrough performance.
208;Everything from Aaron Zigman's score to Dominic Watkins' production design was marvelous.
209;And if you think the end was harsh, it even adds more drama to your experience and what you thought of the film and helped reveal to you that not everything is Hollywood.
210;Instead, there is an okay making.
211;if you got the answer, well, you'd better keep it for yourself, because i don't want to hear or know it.
212;Justin Timberlake was actually a good actor, and I wanted to just make fun of the movie!
213;I thought the acting was spectacular, even though (and I know this is a true story) I think Zach should have used some of his black belt skills on Elvis when he had the chance!
214;Surprisingly good take on the true story of Jesse James Hollywood's antics as a suburban drug dealer and his kidnapping a business colleague's younger brother to settle a debt.
215;The names are changed but the story is very accurate.
216;the performances alone make this one worth watching.
217;I think the reason for this is because it is a true story.
218;Like a dog walking on its hind legs, it is not done well, but you are surprised to see it done at all, so you give Justin more points than he deserves.
219;a cautionary and true story about having it all way to fast.
220;outstanding performances by Sharon Stone, Bruce Willis, Emile Hirsch and Justin Timberlake.
221;I contacted amazon about the incident and got a replacement.
222;This one catches you by surprise.
223;It starts off pleasantly enough with the Lifestyles Of The Rich, Young and Drug Dealing.
224;i found out about this movie from a episode of the ricki lake show she had the mother of the young man who was murdered, this was a very heart wrenching story, i recomend it highly for the whole family strong language and content but a real must see
225;This movie is def worth watching.
226;The actors and actresses are very good.
227;The best part is the character development.
228;The ending scene with Sharon Stone was incredible and very underated.
229;I actually thought that was an interview of the real mother after her issues and trials after the passing of her son.
230;When you watch this movie, you also learn about the REAL story behind it.
231;Alpha Dog was highly entertaining, from beginning to end.
232;emile Hirsch was absolutely fantastic as Johnny Truelove, and he stole the show with his performance.
233;His performance was so believable, that you'd never know in a million years that he hasn't been acting all of his life.
234;this movie was based on a very compelling, real life story, which made watching the movie even more intense.
235;This film is a wonderful example of what happens when the pursuit of those things, which in the long run just don't mean a whole heckuva lot, usurp our time to the exclusion of ALL else, and when all else begins to fail, we have no answers as to how to fix the problem, which has now grown out of control.
236;Mind you, Alpha Dog was a CAPTIVATING bit of film.
237;Alpha Dog and Bully are educational in that they show what to, and what not to do, when it comes to raising children, but hey, it was an entertaining bit of film, oh, yes!!
238;Surprisingly,this is a very strong film with several standout performances.
239;Ben Foster is the real scene stealer as the drug crazed Mazursky,and while other reviewers have said he was over the top, I found him quite convincing indeed.
240;I defenitely enjoyed the movie through and through, and being familiar with the case it was based upon so therefore knowing the ending per se,I was still shocked at the overall bluntness of the crime.
241;If a movie can't find something interesting to say, then it should at least be interesting to watch.
242;Anyway, the story's pretty simple.
243;screen who isn't a part of the kidnapping is given a number and labelled a witness), this is a story that has little to recommend it.
244;Decadence and decay are truly film.
245;The intrigue comes when you realize it was based on true events.
246;a movie worth seeing, and Justin Timberlake gave a surprisingly good performance.
247;this is a great action movie.
248;Bruce Willis delivers as usual.
249;I stumbled across Alpha Dog the other night on cable and found myself wrapped up in the true life teen gangster story along the lines of Larry Clark'sBully, although lighter and funnier.
250;disc Special Edition)combined with strong seasoned performances by Sharon Stone, Bruce Willis, and Harry Dean Stanton.
251;Amazon already does an informative write up, which talks about Cassavetes own run in with the law for his contact with the real life character behind Johnny Truelove, still on the F. b. i's ten most wanted list at the time of the film.
252;in this movie of solid performances it is Ben Foster's Jake Mazursky that steals the spotlight, as he did in similar fashion from Russel Crowe and Christian Bale in the western3:10 to Yuma (Widescreen Edition)with his portrayal of Charlie Prince.
253;Ben Foster does a great job showing rage in this part with words or without.
254;Justin Timberlake also gives a good performance as the mostly obnoxious, with hints of charisma, Frankie Ballenbacher.
255;This sets a chain of events sometimes fun and entertaining but ultimately tragic.
256;What I think this movie really does is establish the fact that Justin Timberlake has some acting chops.
257;the extras on the disc tells some of the true story the film was based on, and has interviews with some of the actors.
258;Overall it is worth the price if you enjoy fictional versions of true crime stories.
259;The basics is that they kidnap the 15 year.
260;old kid so that his older brother pays up the 1200 dollars he owes Truelove.
261;Sharon Stone is also fairly decent as Zack's mother, that is until the end.
262;This is quite possibly one of the best films I've ever seen.
263;The script and dialogue is solid as well as the acting.
264;The story is told very well, and is portrayed very accurately.
265;Great price and exclent customer service.
266;This was a amazing movie from an great site.
267;I'm happy to own this movie.
268;It is very believable and farfetched at the same time.
269;This film has great insight into how such a crime could take place.
270;This is a movie you will want to watch over and over.
271;It has a good story line and lots of unexpected action.
272;lets face it, it's an excellent B movie.
273;I do recommend having it in your best movies library.
274;Good job Justin and Bruce never disappoints you.
275;The creative and very effective use of captions under characters provides a sense of foreboding that is especially disturbing given the free.

278;A topic that Hollywood is all to eager to promote, market and sell to middle America.
279;You can tell by their gnarled syntax and grammar that these are indeed products of our excellent American public education system.
280;i knew the story about what had happened in 1999 ahead of time and decided to see it put on the big screen.
281;I really felt for the kid at the end of the movie.
282;If you had no idea about the true story you would think Timberlake would of let the kid go at the end and then the good ole happy ending comes true.
283;awesome movie, I bought it, and will watch it again and again.
284;Got my movie on time, Excellent service.
285;While in their minds this is an innocent game of control and their abducted kid has seeming fun in his captivity, these boys slowly realize that there cannot be good end to their actions.
286;Movies that are based on true events or a true story make the movie even better.
287;I thought this movie was done really well.
288;It has great actors in it also.
289;I highly recommend this movie.
290;Cassavetes has written a tight script that captures the fast.
291;It is in that context that Truelove relinquishes his role as the main focal point of the film in favor of Frankie Ballenbacher, a cheerfully sardonic wise guy whose job it is to watch over the boy while Johnny figures out what next to do with him.
292;there are fine performances by Emile Hirsch, Shawn Hatosy, Ben Foster (Six Feet Under), Bruce Willis, Harry Dean Stanton and Sharon Stone, among others, but it is Justin Timberlake, as the high.
293;In his every moment on screen, the charismatic Timberlake brings an intensity, shrewdness and liveliness to his performance that bodes well for his future career in movies.
294;in his direction, Cassavetes generates a starkness of vision and moodiness of tone that are greatly enhanced by the brooding, darkly.
295;lit camerawork of French cinematographer Robert Fraisse.
296;And there are sporadic rare moments, mainly in the early part of the film, where one gets the sense that the cast members are playacting rather than truly inhabiting their parts.
297;But these impressions are few and very fleeting and, for the most part, the actors do an admirable job of conveying the down.
298;Thank you for your time, and have a good day.
299;This isn't a great movie, but it is a pretty good movie.
300;But it's certainly an interesting movie that's worth seeing.
301;There are moments here that really work if you ignore the ones that don't.
302;he was just attempting to tell the story of an interesting guy in a quirky, sometimes funny way.
303;The movie is worth your time because the story is interesting.
304;The main character is played by Emile Hirsh, and he does an adequate job, although he seems a little uneven at times.
305;in the end, if you like interesting stories and you aren't turned off by strong language and spotty acting, you'll probably find this film worth your time.
306;Every time I heard him curse and glanced at his tattoos, I laughed louder.

313;with the storyline already written for him, all director Cassavetes had to do was get the performances he wanted out of his young cast, which he does with great success.
314;His right hand man, played surprising well by Timberlake, is affable, cocky and troubled by the notion that he's somehow gotten in over his head.
315;Some characters, particularly Timberlake's, are cast in a relatively positive light as mere children swept up in situation beyond their control.
316;This probably reflects the truth more accurately than your typical black and white analysis of killer and victim, and in my opinion, it is exactly this element that makes the film such a stunning study of how relatively ordinary people can be persuaded to participate in unconscionable acts.
317;despite an ending that is preordained AlphaDog manages to hold your attention with excellent performances.
318;Right up to the moment the tek.9 ends his life you can't help but hold on to the hope that the kind and quiet Nick will be spared.
319;While Hollywood has always done a great job at bringing fiction to life,what is always remarkable is to see a true story be turned into a film.
320;one of 2006's most successful films,Alpha Dog,is proof of the paragraph above.
321;here,Alpha Dog documents everything that lead to Jesse James Hollywood becoming one of the youngest men to ever appear on the FBI's ten most wanted list.
322;Writer/director Nick Cassavetes does this by taking the true event and turning it easily into a plot.
323;while Alpha Dog may not earn Oscars,on the whole,it is a really good film.
324;It does a good job at covering the whole Jesse James Hollywood case.
325;With his direction of Alpha Dog,Nick Cassavetes does a strong job at telling viewers like it is.
326;At the same time,Alpha Dog does a good job at getting a message out to its viewers of all ages,and does not contain what it gave it an R rating for the sake of it.
327;A lot of powerful acting is also to be found here in Alpha Dog,which is a large contribution as to how this film turned out to be as good and successful as it did.
328;overall,a film that does a perfect job at covering one of the worst and saddest crimes ever to be committed,and works well as both a true story and a film.
329;Go into this film being prepared and having an open mind,and you will find yourself enjoying Alpha Dog.
330;Taking one look at the cast and I thought wow.
331;another movie with great, mainstream actors.
332;based on a true story, this movie is great.
333;What this says about our culture is distrubing at best.
334;How thrilled I was then to see Nick Cassavetes brilliant Alpha Dog.
335;It must have taken guts to make a film this bold and unrelentling.
336;From the opening credits with the late Eva Cassidy's haunting rendition of Over The Rainbow to the final denouement I was entertained, laughed, cried and moved beyond imagining.
337;Justin Timberlake was very good as was Anton Yelchin.
338;Robert Fraisse's cinematography was stunning as well.
339;All the best ones are like that.
340;Nick Cassavetes is taking an interesting path in his work and I'm looking forward to what he has in store for us next.
341;This Movie has to be one of my favorites and to know that its a true story makes it that much better
342;Alpha Dog is a perfect companion piece to the equally harrowing Bully.
343;Much of the film focuses on the kid being held hostage, and the friendship he forms with Justin Timberlake's character.
344;Justin treats him with respect, and the kid responds by trusting him with his life.
345;He even allows Justin to bind his wrists and mouth with electrical tape, accepting this dubious action like a Judas kiss.
346;the film is energetic, well.
347;It also has smatters of perverse humor.
348;I think the ending speech by Anton Yelchin sums it up perfectly.
349;He comes to appreciate his mom, who's the bomb.
350;He's at a turning point, and can choose the right path.
351;His son's work for the day involves pruning the abundant marijuana plants in the backyard.
352;but thats what makes this movie so good.
353;This is a great movie as it points out a major flaw in today's society.
354;I think is a very complicated topic, and it was handled unrespectful, considering that was a true story.
355;Not a very good movie.
356;A true classic in every sense of the Tarrantino word.
357;I could watch this movie a dozen time and see something new every time.
358;Great plot, action, suspense, has it all.
359;I rate this movie up there with Casablanca and Pulp Fiction as one of the great classics.
360;Best as a visual reenactment of the events surrounding the crime, Dog tells a shocking story.
361;Dad and Grandpa (Harry Dean Stanton) treat Johnny like the adult he is, prodding him to get some tail and to forget about his steady girlfriend.
362;One evening, Jake (Ben Foster) arrives, strung out, to talk to Johnny.
363;But Zack actually enjoys the company of the older guys and goes along willingly and also enjoys the local notoriety of being a hostage.
364;up as a faux documentary.
365;As the story progresses, the various days and times appear onscreen, to help us navigate the events.
366;Also, as new people enter the story, we see their name, and in some cases Witness #1.
367;emile Hirsch plays Johnny and he does a good job of showing the character's toughness, bravado and a need to maintain a certain image.
368;Even among his friends, he is more talk than anything else.
369;justin Timberlake plays Frankie, Johnny's good friend.
370;shawn Hatosy pays Elvis, one of Johnny's friends, who also owes him some money.
371;Later, he takes on a job for Johnny, clearly meant to erase his outstanding debt.
372;This is one of the more interesting characters in the story
373;When he ultimately agrees to do something for Johnny, it makes sense.
374;anton Yelchin is also good as Zack, Jake's younger brother.
375;son of Olivia, played by Sharon Stone.
376;His words are very true, because whenever he plays a drunken character, he seems like a real person who has just had too much to drink.
377;He plays the role way over the top.
378;Mom, can I talk to you for a moment?
379;Alpha Dog works best as a sort of chronicle of this event, showing the who, what, why and where of the situation.
380;Alpha Dog is a great B movie.
381;The actors are meant to speak in real time scenes with realistic everyday dialog, meaning it should come off as a false reality TV show like The Office, where realistic acting is done well.
382;Still, the movie is enjoyable for its gratuitous violence, swearing, and drug use.
383;For a while, the seriousness of the story is cast aside as the comedy, action and excess becomes enjoyable on a base level.
384;While characters are based on real people, as characters they are left to thrive in their movie reflection of life, but as reflections of people they gain an extra layer of sympathy and identification.
385;I must confess that this movie was a pleasant surprise.
386;he does a damn good job.
387;All of the characters in this play excellent roles.
388;It's just amazing that this is a true story.
389;It's so possible and the ending so inevitable that this movie will hold you to the end.
390;This is a good movie of something tragic.
391;That's worth the wAtch in itself.
392;Overall I recommend this movie.
393;good thing it was cheep
394;He comes from a good family, owns his home, several cars and enjoys partying with his friends.
395;He's enjoying partying with them, losing his virginity and having a good time .
396;Justin Timberlake is very good as Frankie.
397;but, it is based on a true story.
398;I also bought it on Amazon, the place where the price is always right.
399;Well, most of the time the price is right.
400;I also bought it as a gift to a few friends.
