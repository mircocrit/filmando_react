I:9527;1;The Birds (1963) is the first Hitchcock film I've seen, and I'm so glad I've seen it, because it started my Hitchcock film collection, and it's one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:9527;2;I also think that it's one of the greatest horror films of all time.
I:9527;3;"this is one of the films that made the whole ""nature gone wrong"" thing popular and it's a classic that you can watch over and over again."
I:9527;4;It's not scary now, but it still is very suspenseful and heart.
I:9527;5;Another great thing about this film is that it marks Tippi Hedren's first big role.
I:9527;6;"She also appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Marnie"" a year later."
I:9527;7;"It comes with a 1 hour 17 minute documentary: ""All About The Birds: An Original Documentary"", where it talks about how the film was made, and it's pretty interesting."
I:9527;8;The Birds is a landmark classic that only Hitchcock could have done, and it still will be a classic another 50 years from now.
I:9527;9;There she meets his family and a few other people and for a time its good and without really any problems.
I:9527;10;The characters that infuse Hitchcock films are what make them classics.
I:9527;11;The diner moments are especially worth watching in this.
I:9527;12;The Birds starring Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor is my second favorite Hitchcock film, Pyscho being #1 for me.
I:9527;13;This film is scary, romantic, and intoxicating.
I:9527;14;Jessica Tandy also stars, she was such a magnetic actress back then.
I:9527;15;would recommend to see it!!!
I:9527;16;This is a classic, it never gets old.
I:9527;17;The unsettling atmosphere in this film is created masterfully.
I:9527;18;She is pretty, alluring and by all outward appearances well adjusted.
I:9527;19;She almost seems to be creating the bird problem herself,and this is the driving force of the film.
I:9527;20;The scene in the coffee shop is spectacular.
I:9527;21;The effect that massive amounts of birds are attacking is genuinely projected.
I:9527;22;Its the end of the world.
I:9527;23;The picture is sharp and the sound is decent for its time.
I:9527;24;A curious and good movie.
I:9527;25;ray is pretty good for a movie 50 years old.
I:9527;26;This is an excellant movie.
I:9527;27;One of Alfred Hitchcocks best movies.
I:9527;28;In the day before computer generation, the methods that the movie makers used to make the special effects works.
I:9527;29;Several great stars in the movie and it is done as well as a movie of the time could be done.
I:9527;30;I highly recommend this movie.
I:9527;31;Highly recommend it, whether you haven't seen it since 19xx, or if it's your first time.
I:9527;32;This is a really good movie.
I:9527;33;It's very interesting and visually nice to watch!
I:9527;34;Now imagine that going on for two hours!
I:9527;35;What you get is Hitchcock's classic film.
I:9527;36;But then again this is an Alfred Hitchcock film.
I:9527;37;I refer to him as the thinking person's film making .
I:9527;38;I think the birds did it because people ignored nature and it's animals.
I:9527;39;But there are redeeming moments in this film.
I:9527;40;For one Tippi Hedren gives a wonderful performance.
I:9527;41;Hitchcock as always displays his talents.
I:9527;42;And the effects(which got nominated for oscar's) are visually stunning!
I:9527;43;Here's a wonderful movie by the master of suspense.
I:9527;44;And this one proves he deserves that title just as well as any of his other films.
I:9527;45;The Birds was a very good movie.
I:9527;46;It took me a while to get into it but by the end I was very satisfied.
I:9527;47;I thought it was very cool that it had no music in the movie because it was the only movie I have ever known that had no music in it.
I:9527;48;Melaine (Tippi Hendren) was a very good actress, she did very well in this movie but I have never seen her in another movie but she was very good.
I:9527;49;I also thought it was very cool that Alfred Hitchcock plays a very small roll in this movie just like in all of his other movies.
I:9527;50;That is my favorite part about Alfred Hitchcock movies.
I:9527;51;What makes this movie so unique among Hitchcock's work is that it has an almost supernatural feel to it.
I:9527;52;In most of Hitchcock's films the mystery comes from the actions of other people .
I:9527;53;The film also leaves you hanging with more questions than answers, which in its context is perfectly acceptable and indeed part of its appeal.
I:9527;54;The final shot is one of his best.
I:9527;55;I think it is one of Hitchcock's best movies and as familiar as I am with the film it still has the ability to scare me silly!
I:9527;56;The Birds is a fabulous movie.
I:9527;57;I enjoy it more each time I watch it.
I:9527;58;The movie is made up of a web of discrete scenes .
I:9527;59;Tippi Hedren is beautiful and captivating.
I:9527;60;The restaurant scene with Mrs Bundy (Ethel Griffies) is excellent.
I:9527;61;this is one is much more subtle.
I:9527;62;If you are looking for wonderful acting, captivating characters, and a suspense and intriguing plot .
I:9527;63;then you will enjoy this movie!
I:9527;64;My students enjoyed the film!
I:9527;65;Tippi Hedron does a very convincing job playing the spoiled socialite.
I:9527;66;rod Taylor is handsome and caring as Mitch and together they make a good looking couple.
I:9527;67;hitchcock takes his time with this movie.
I:9527;68;And yet it's still interesting to watch.
I:9527;69;there's backstory here with interesting family dynamics.
I:9527;70;Melanie and Mitch don't know each other and yet they are suddenly in the kitchen touching and acting as if they had been a couple for awhile.
I:9527;71;You would shine the light, see the birds and quickly shut the door.
I:9527;72;Excellent one of classic horror.
I:9527;73;Anybody should give this chance to watch.
I:9527;74;I love classic horror movies and that's how I got into horror movies for years.
I:9527;75;That has bring good memories of the time I had with my mother and she loves classic movies.
I:9527;76;"Melanie Daniels (Tippy Hedren) is the daughter of the publisher of ""one of the larger newspapers in San Francisco"" and carries, along with her two surprise lovebirds, a sense of entitlement."
I:9527;77;assured lawyer who lives with his widowed mother and young sister in Bodega Bay.
I:9527;78;This film is masterfully filmed.
I:9527;79;The early scene of Melanie in the boat, in the middle of the bay, is especially memorable.
I:9527;80;As smoothly as Melanie's sports car.
I:9527;81;"at the end there is some assurance that ""the military will be involved."""
I:9527;82;When you hear the name Alfred Hitchcock, there are a few movie titles that instantly jump into your mind (most notably, `Vertigo', `Psycho', `Read Window' and `The Birds').
I:9527;83;i soaked this one in, and what is great is that in my adult years I can see this film for so much more than I did in my youth.
I:9527;84;While `The Birds' has certainly become a cult favorite, a film that circulates the tongues of many people for various reasons, but it is also a film that stands tall on its own merits.
I:9527;85;this film is actually riddled with a keen sense of intelligence and a stark expression of depth that one may initially shrug off because of its genre.
I:9527;86;Taking the family structure build with the characters within the film, Hitchcock unleashes on us a tale of aggression that spans all spectrums of the equation.
I:9527;87;by using a near unknown in the lead, Hitchcock was also able to create a sense of realism that may have been lost in a big star.
I:9527;88;in the end, `The Birds' will always be one of the greatest `horror' movies around, but it is deeper than that and it deserves to be regarded as such.
I:9527;89;it's a great mesh of a film.
I:9527;90;More than just some tense horror, you are given a story worth discussion.
I:9527;91;Its really quite brilliant how it all plays out and in a lot of respects is almost two films in one.
I:9527;92;The opening half, a very mysterious love story, and of course the later half a good ole Hitchcock suspense film.
I:9527;93;Theres a terrific making of, an original trailer, deleted scene, alternate ending, and, most important for me, other actors or film lovers, Tippi Hedren's original screen test!!
I:9527;94;You gotta check it out.
I:9527;95;Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds is a must see for any of the director's fans or fantastic cinema fans at large.
I:9527;96;I have watched movies in theaters and home video for more than 50 years, and take my word for it that it looks good.
I:9527;97;Worth the price of admission as much now as when it was released.
I:9527;98;This movie is just as entertaining now as when it when I first saw it!
I:9527;99;A classic worth adding to your collection.
I:9527;100;Good actors, great action and cinematography, leaves you wondering.
I:9527;101;"beautiful blonde Melanie Daniels (""Tippi"" Hedren in her film debut) has arrived in beautiful Bodega Bay, where she falls in love with Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor)."
I:9527;102;One day, a seagull attacks her without reason.
I:9527;103;The Birds is truly a masterpiece.
I:9527;104;edren excels in her first film role, and the rest of the cast is great.
I:9527;105;Hitchcock directed this film with fist clenching assuredness, and some of his finest camerawork is present on this film.
I:9527;106;I tried to watch it with an open mind.
I:9527;107;Hmm there's a million birds outside.
I:9527;108;Oh my gosh, the gas station's exploding and birds are attacking everything!
I:9527;109;Ooh, maybe I can open and close the door randomly!
I:9527;110;"It doesn't take a genius to write a story with a million loose ends
I:9527;111;it was a good movie went it came out.
I:9527;112;There are lots of layers to this filmTippi Hedren is very good as well as Rod Taylor and Jessica TandyCan seem a bit out there, but look up references or studies to enhance overall understanding
I:9527;113;The only additional comment is the recommendation that viewers enjoy the brilliant insightful book Camille Paglia devoted to this cinematic triumph.
I:9527;114;Viewed: 12/05, 12/13Rate: 312/05: The Birds is a nice, memorable, and beautiful Hitchcock film, but it's hard for me to sustain my attention due to the length.
I:9527;115;I like the acting the best, especially the intensity of the relation between the two female characters, Melanie and Annie.
I:9527;116;Rod Taylor plays his part very nicely: the sort of a Cary Grant prototype.
I:9527;117;All in all, The Birds is a beautiful picture but deserves, at best, a weak rating of `7'.12/13: There are parallels between The Birds and The Night of the Living Dead.
I:9527;118;common sense does prevail a lot of times.
I:9527;119;A natural reaction to this sort of thing is to crack open the door a bit and look what's inside before closing it fast.
I:9527;120;She walks inside the room out of fear just like that.
I:9527;121;All in all, The Birds is one of the sillier pictures I've seen.
I:9527;122;The Birds as a film is exceptional because of its ingenius director.
I:9527;123;I will say that this film is enjoyable multiple times because is was so carefully planned and well constructed on so many levels.
I:9527;124;He took his sweet time and made real gems.
I:9527;125;look at the film with fresh eyes and it begins like a screwball romantic comedy.
I:9527;126;Hitch creates atmosphere and suspense with amazing prowess.
I:9527;127;There is such suspense here, and it's just a lady dropping off some pets.
I:9527;128;More directors and writers could do well to pay attention to Mr. Hitchcock's work.
I:9527;129;this is just one scene in the film that's fascinating and expertly crafted.
I:9527;130;Hitch purposely stayed away from the original story by Daphne DuMaurier, allowing screenwriter Evan Hunter to create a very interesting set.
I:9527;131;it's a fun horror film that's multifaceted and fascinating.
I:9527;132;With all my favorite movies.
I:9527;133;Good shipping as always .
I:9527;134;This little thriller by Hitchcock still holds up pretty well even after circa 50 years.
I:9527;135;Good script, direction, and camera work.
I:9527;136;In this case I believe the concession was worth the effort.
I:9527;137;Anyway I'm pretty sure a movie released in 1963 wasn't originally in color, but the color really makes the film more watchable.
I:9527;138;Just not believable enough suspense to create a feeling of satisfaction in todays world.
I:9527;139;The best part is definitely when the blonde woman, the man, his mother and the young daughter are all together in the house and they hear the distinct and disturbing sound of thousands of birds about to invade their home right above the roof.
I:9527;140;This is actually REALLY good horror, and it's surprising to me how effectively well done it is for a 1963 flick.
I:9527;141;The sound the birds make here is really cool and for anyone who fears isolation, this will really creep you out!
I:9527;142;But this movie is unquestionably a classic.
I:9527;143;"the story adapted from Daphne du Maurier, does seem to be a little mysterious as to why the birds suddenly appear and as to the ending if that is what it is
I:9527;144;After all this is an Alfred Hitchcock movie.
I:9527;145;Also, see if you spot his cameo appearance.
I:9527;146;The sound is terrific though this film deserved the 5.1 treatment that was given to psycho and vertigo blu rays.
I:9527;147;I bought this movie for my mom because she's been wanting it for a long time.
I:9527;148;The case itself has a very nice slip cover that opens up and it's absolutely beautiful!
I:9527;149;I love the clear picture that blu.
I:9527;150;The Birds is a Hitchcock masterpiece the way he puts fake birds in with real birds to make you think they are all real is brilliant.
I:9527;151;The drama, suspense, tension is very well done.
I:9527;152;"There are a lot of birds in this movie
I:9527;153;Under the supreme guidance of Alfred Hitchcock, THE BIRDS is a genuine horror classic!
I:9527;154;The Alfred Hitchcock classic is captivating.
I:9527;155;who doesn't really seem that ditzy (in fact she seems exceptionally well.
I:9527;156;possessed, trim and organized) .
I:9527;157;This is a small community: perhaps they are all inbred.
I:9527;158;I really will have to read the book (which has to be set in rural England somewhere?)
I:9527;159;, and study the dialogue much more carefully.
I:9527;160;Anyway, it's certainly an odd, disjointed, disturbing, surreal, and yes, memorable film.
I:9527;161;THE BIRDS is a wonderful film, intensely touching with it's much analyzed symbolism of human fragility.
I:9527;162;It is also scary with imaginative attacks and wonderful sequences.
I:9527;163;The Tides Restaurant sequence is a wonderfully black sequence of comedy, terror, and logic ending at the only conclusion: if it's true, we haven't got a chance.
I:9527;164;The subplot of Lydia, Annie, and Melanie is wonderful to analyze.
I:9527;165;Watch again and again for it's cool and cold atmosphere and clever sequences and directing by Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense, who definitely suceeded in this film.
I:9527;166;Personally, this is my 4th or 5th favorite film, the first four being REBECCA, THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY, and SHADOW OF A DOUBT, and REAR WINDOW.
I:9527;167;"well, my dreams were troubled ""evermore"" for a good long time."
I:9527;168;THE BIRDS is not one of Hitchcock's best films.
I:9527;169;"And wonder, as I have for over 30 years, ""Just what DOES it all mean anyway?"
I:9527;170;This Mother Nature strikes back movie in the form of bird attacks featured an all star cast.
I:9527;171;Novice actress (at the time) Suzanne Pleshette ( The Bob Newhart Show ), rendered a remarkable performance as the town schoolteacher.
I:9527;172;Even young Veronica Cartwright ( Sound of Music, Lost in Space ), acted well.
I:9527;173;If you love creature features that terrify, you'll love this Alfred Hitchcock favorite.
I:9527;174;It is a great move made very well good stroy line.
I:9527;175;one of my favorite movies!
I:9527;176;Old movie but a great one use to watch when I was little.
I:9527;177;Hitchcock is, of course, is master of creating mood with his camerawork, such as the scene on the park bench in which the birds slowly collect in the background.
I:9527;178;There is no doubt that Hitchcock was a genius and that this was one of his biggest triumphs.
I:9527;179;But today it is interesting mostly as a cultural artifact.
I:9527;180;it is a great story, great acting and superb photography.
I:9527;181;The Birds is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous thrillers, though it's not always regarded as one of his best.
I:9527;182;the humans may be overshadowed by the birds, but they provide some of the best moments.
I:9527;183;"Well, I do, Mrs. Bundy declares, ""I do know."""
I:9527;184;Mrs. Bundy is a minor character, but she steals the show during her brief scenes.
I:9527;185;hitchcock also knew that the anticipation of horror can be more frightening than the actual thing.
I:9527;186;office hit when it opened in spring 1963, and it would shatter previous viewing records when it made its television debut on NBC five years later.
I:9527;187;It was also the great director's final cinematic triumph.
I:9527;188;Love this movie and love having it available online to watch whenever I want!
I:9527;189;I love shopping with Amazon and it is the first site I go to when I need something!
I:9527;190;Still terrifying even today, Alfred Hitchcock's THE BIRDS is the ultimate for sheer thrills and exitement.
I:9527;191;with an effective use of flapping wings and ominous bird sounds as opposed to a full musical score, the atmosphere is tense and moody for the whole duration of the motion picture.
I:9527;192;Probably one of Tipie's best movie, although i haven't seen much of her.
I:9527;193;She was good in this an american horror classic.
I:9527;194;This move totally averts that.
I:9527;195;I saw this movie when I was a kid, and have wanted to see it again since.
I:9527;196;They sat unmoving with the exception of the suspenseful musical buildup of the attack scenes.
I:9527;197;We all totally enjoyed this old classic.
I:9527;198;Alfred Hitchcock knew how to make a movie.
I:9527;199;This is true despite his not having the high tech at his disposal that today's filmmakers have for making a film that needs all of these attacking birds' sequences.
I:9527;200;What he used instead was his imagination and also the best collaborators in the business for every aspect of the film.
I:9527;201;This was my primary thought upon finishing this excellent movie and comparing it to all of these dismal action adventure yarns of today which have little to recommend them besides their state of the art special effects.
I:9527;202;good movie but I ordered the wrong one.
I:9527;203;This is one of my favorite Hitchcock films.
I:9527;204;It's suspenseful and has definitely given me a slight fear of birds.
I:9527;205;I love Alfred Hitchcock, and this movie is certainly one of the classic Hitchcock films.
I:9527;206;The suspense is great all the way through, the audio is great, and if you like cliff hangers, it's a home run!
I:9527;207;The characters are all well.
I:9527;208;I have seen this movie numerous times and love it!
I:9527;209;Scary and clever for the times.
I:9527;210;Good acting, good color, good sound.
I:9527;211;Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren especially good together in this movie.
I:9527;212;An intelligent script, well acted and a couple of plausible explanations including where your own imagination takes you as to the reason to why the birds are attacking just underscores what is missing in today's horror films.
I:9527;213;If you are on heart medication or don't like films that don't tie up endings for you, don't watch this but if you enjoy a perfect horror movie, this is about as good as it gets.
I:9527;214;This is my all time favorite movie.
I:9527;215;But you really have to marvel at the special effects and some of the great camera.
I:9527;216;Those bird attacks are masterful and look so real!
I:9527;217;Suzanne Pleashette gives the best understated performance as the woman scorned, as does Jessica Tandy as the neurotic mother hen .
I:9527;218;Lots of subtle symbolism, and there are some classic throw.
I:9527;219;so I think Hitchcock may have been on to something!
I:9527;220;Good fun and always suspenseful entertainment.
I:9527;221;This is a classic Hitchcock movie and my Aunt is a Alfred Hitchcock fan too!
I:9527;222;I recommend this movie to anyone who loves Hitchcock movies.
I:9527;223;Have always been a Hitchcock fan, and this is Hitchcock's BEST.
I:9527;224;I remember how I watched it before and loved it.
I:9527;225;I have loved this movie for a very long time now.
I:9527;226;Thank you, Amazon, for a wonderful viewing experience!
I:9527;227;Trip to Bodega Bay and this is one of my classic favorites.
I:9527;228;Want to get Birds 2 next, i have seen both but its nice to watch one after the other in order
I:9527;229;Watched this for the first time when I was about 12 and I remember most of it.
I:9527;230;Suspence almost became Hitchcock's trademark, and The Birds is one of his best.
I:9527;231;it is well known that Hitchcock did not have a high regard for actors .
I:9527;232;although not as subtle as some of the old Englishman's films, this is one of the Master's more memorable pictures of the 60's.
I:9527;233;and this is true, so help me .
I:9527;234;This film has moments where it seems dated but all in all it holds up well.
I:9527;235;Tippi Hedren was so beautiful, and her performance is fine.
I:9527;236;This film was another well done thriller by Alfred Hitchcock.
I:9527;237;My favorite Alfred Hitchcock thriller and another Rod Taylor movie that I highly enjoy and still watch over and over again.
I:9527;238;now, why is The Birds worth watching?
I:9527;239;"Mitch (Rod Taylor) is handsome in the movie, and he knows it
I:9527;240;Their dialogue is humorous and witty, and the power play is well worth watching.
I:9527;241;THAT'd be an interesting motion picture.
I:9527;242;It's the perfect gift to offer to your mother.
I:9527;243;features, for once, are very instructive AND interesting.
I:9527;244;The copy is quite perfect : I had the feeling to rediscover a brand new movie after so many bad copies seen in local theatres or during the late.
I:9527;245;i admire Tippi Hedren, I admire the way Alfred Hitchcock has photographed Tippi Hedren, I admire Tippi Hedren's classy incarnation of a high society child.
I:9527;246;taylor works perfectly and you never have the feeling that they are nothing more than a pale copy of, let's say, Grace Kelly and Cary Grant.
I:9527;247;jessica Tandy is the usual possessive mother with the murderous sparkle in her left eye and Suzanne Pleshette has a great second role.
I:9527;248;And you have this subtle British humor during the scene involving the two lovebirds in Tippi Hedren's car.
I:9527;249;This is a must see for people who love suspense.
I:9527;250;This scene is worth watching a couple of time.
I:9527;251;Alfred Hitchcock sure knows how to make them.
I:9527;252;This is one of my favorites.
I:9527;253;The Birds written by Daphne De Maurier is an excellent story concerning a flock of gulls who come to Land's End to prey on the innocent.
I:9527;254;Eerie effective thriller with great shocking scenes such as the schoolyard event when a flock of birds nest on a wire waiting for attack.
I:9527;255;The mystery is one of the most remarkable aspects of this horror film.
I:9527;256;The birds is my favorite Alfred Hitchock movie, timeless and always delivers.
I:9527;257;But with that being said, the cinematography and acting in this movie are outstanding!
I:9527;258;Anyway, this movie is still worth seeing, although I liked Psycho, Rear Window, Vertigo, and Rebecca better.
I:9527;259;I think this is the best horror movie ever made.
I:9527;260;Tippi Hedren is a great, sophisticated, and pretty actress.
I:9527;261;rod Taylor was great too.
I:9527;262;beleive me folks ,this is a great thriller.
I:9527;263;she makes the trip up to Bodega Bay and interesting relationships start to develop.
I:9527;264;She has a discussion, about the two, with the teacher (played by Suzanne Pleshette) and there is interesting character development in the works.
I:9527;265;The history of the filming of this frightening scene is fascinating.
I:9527;266;Because of these unanswered qestions, I waver between 4 and 5 stars.
I:9527;267;Pushing me towards 5 stars are some interesting views into human nature.
I:9527;268;Certainly, it is human nature to try to deny something that is so frightening.
I:9527;269;Not only does the film look great in widescreen, but it also comes with a lengthy featurette that includes filming details that are informative and interesting.
I:9527;270;tippi Hedren, who plays Melanie Daniels, does a superb job in her first feature film.
I:9527;271;unlike some reviewers, I think the movie's final scene is perfect.
I:9527;272;It's quite ominous (better than a resolution), and visually haunting.
I:9527;273;i particularly like the clever dialogue between Mitch and Melanie (Rod and Tippi).
I:9527;274;"the best visual shot in the film is a ""God's POV"" (Hitchcock's term) scene in which sea gulls descend upon Bodega Bay, where a number of cars have just exploded into flame."
I:9527;275;How this incredibly powerful scene was filmed is explained in the featurette.
I:9527;276;"i have seen a good many Hitchcock films, and ""The Birds"" remains my favorite."
I:9527;277;That's what Hitchcock wanted viewers to ask themselves.
I:9527;278;Hitchcock provides some clues to possible interpretations.
I:9527;279;The Birds is one of those expertly made films that can be viewed time and again.
I:9527;280;Still, the film looks very good overall.
I:9527;281;But all thinsg considered, this is a true masterpiece.
I:9527;282;Shipping and Delivery was excellent.
I:9527;283;One of the best early fiction films ever made.
I:9527;284;a couple of very iconic shots and Hitchcockian style film making at it's best.
I:9527;285;I've always thought the acting in this Hitchcock film was top.
I:9527;286;generated shots in this one, making the viewer appreciate all the more what Hitch was able to accomplish on screen!
I:9527;287;He creates a feeling of real tension and apprehension as the film progresses.
I:9527;288;My favorite scene is the one set in the town's diner.
I:9527;289;There are no birds in this scene, but Hitchcock manages to invoke fear in us merely with dialogue during this fascinating scene!
I:9527;290;The Birds is another in a long line of Alfred Hitchcock gems.
I:9527;291;One of the best movies from the Master of Suspense.
I:9527;292;"It still works today
I:9527;293;I was just really impressed with the quickness.
I:9527;294;This is such a great classic!
I:9527;295;I love being able to order movies I will watch over and over, Thanks Amazon!
I:9527;296;I've always liked this movie and was happy to see it again.
I:9527;297;My second favorite,action and heart warming,very entertaining not shown much on tv.
I:9527;298;i think it is the best of alfred hitchcock
I:9527;299;So glad that I was able to find this after all the years of searching!
I:9527;300;I was surprised this was in color.
I:9527;301;good and think others would like it.
I:9527;302;Its a good movie for people to watch with some pop corn and soda.
I:9527;303;What's missing from this film is the signature Hitchcockian soundtrack that accompanies his mysteries so well .
I:9527;304;this one, by allowing an overwhelming cacophony of bird caws wash over the picture every time you expect the music to help you ride the waves of thrills.
I:9527;305;"i once read that Hitch never wanted to make thrillers
I:9527;306;although we do know that it may never happen, the attack scenes are frightening, so that you start allowing yourself the pleasure of the disbelief.
I:9527;307;grade special effects, Hitch's impeccable craft commands the same intense degree of fear and suspense, and when you think about how many shots make up on actual scene is when you truly begin to appreciate his genius.
I:9527;308;It looks like great Alfred had his with this one.
I:9527;309;I loved this movie growing up, so it's awesome to get the chance to own it.
I:9527;310;lol) And Tippi is amazing.
I:9527;311;bless her lil heart for going through that for this amazing role!
I:9527;312;This terror is explored quite vividly in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, full of a terrific mix of horror and suspense, well.
I:9527;313;Marion and her man get to know one another better, and he is able to convince her to stay longer during the weekend.
I:9527;314;Nonetheless, this movie is definitely worth a watch, and remains one of Hitchcock's most serious and suspenseful films to this day.
I:9527;315;I already rated it previously and thought it was a good movie.
I:9527;316;Now I watch this film and chuckle at the special effects.
I:9527;317;The animals really did harm her, so what you are seeing is truly real.
I:9527;318;If you can get past the hokey special effects, THE BIRDS is a classic thriller recommended to all horror buffs.
I:9527;319;This Hitchcock classic is a keeper.
I:9527;320;The improved picture really brought out the beauty of Northern California.
I:9527;321;One of the best Suspense films of all time.
I:9527;322;well I was not as scared, but it was still a very erie movie, and kind of strange.
I:9527;323;Over all, it was a great Alfred Hitchcock movie and would recommend for your viewing pleasure.
I:9527;324;A little campy, but I still love this Hitchcock Classic.
I:9527;325;Tippi Hedren is just wonderful in what I believe was her very first movie.
I:9527;326;"excellent special effects
I:9527;327;It arrived and I would recommend this to any Hitchcock fan!
I:9527;328;We are very satisfied!This movie is a classic too!!
I:9527;329;but these omissions are its unique strengths.
I:9527;330;The missing soundtrack leaves you with pure, unadulterated atmosphere.
I:9527;331;the siege on the Tides restaurant, is staged uniquely and brilliantly.
I:9527;332;in a sense, The Birds is a highly experimental, avant.
I:9527;333;movie, and to that end it succeeds brilliantly.
I:9527;334;Everyone whose seen it, remembers it vividly, hauntingly.
I:9527;335;There are many ways in which this movie is trailblazing, Hitchcock always made the harmless terrifying and re.
I:9527;336;"i've always loved these two particular Hitchcock(""call me hitch, hold the cock"") films, though being far removed from the time period they were made in I find psycho/the birds to become more complex the older i get."
I:9527;337;i see something new with each viewing.
I:9527;338;his films are so well shot, cut, and arranged you often forget you are watching the work of a genius unfold.
I:9527;339;Really liked this movie and wanted to share it with my daughter.
I:9527;340;It was neat to watch it in color.
I:9527;341;Hitchcock has always been my favorite director!
I:9527;342;The location shots are outstanding to say the least.
I:9527;343;It was great, and to my pleasure, it still is.
I:9527;344;"Now that I am far more familiar with Hitchcock's filmography and realize the gamut of sophisticated drama and thrilling suspense he created in his long career, I think 1963's ""The Birds"" is far and away the most wonderfully visceral experience he produced onscreen."
I:9527;345;The film is one part allegory on man's impudence over nature and one part family psychodrama full of unresolved feelings, and the two parts work seamlessly together thanks to Evan Hunter's shrewd screenplay.
I:9527;346;although the birds provide an ominous presence from the outset, it starts with a flirtatious, love.
I:9527;347;This is the start of what becomes a series of attacks that increase in scope and terror, and what I appreciate about Hitchcock's style is how he manages to build to them gradually, almost nonchalantly until the moment of strike when he lets the birds take over the screen.
I:9527;348;in a surprising twist, Hitchcock eschews the glamorous stars he usually casts for the leads, though ironically the journeyman.
I:9527;349;As Mitch, Taylor has always been a lunkish presence onscreen and barely charismatic enough to elicit such fervent behavior from the women around him, but he manages the heroic sincerity necessary in the role.
I:9527;350;I also love Ethel Griffies's bit as the elderly ornithologist who happens to be there to explain the genesis of the various bird species.
I:9527;351;even though the matte shots look dated compared to today's seamless computer animation, the effects are still startling, and some scenes are developed brilliantly, in particular, the schoolyard accumulation leading to a direct attack on the running children.
I:9527;352;This represents grand execution by a true master.
I:9527;353;the fact that a major studio like Universal released this is quite astonishing.
I:9527;354;from the birds chipping away at the opening title in that amazing sequence to the quiet,foreboding ending.
I:9527;355;this is one that is a must for collectors.
I:9527;356;It was so enjoyable, even after having watched it so many times, seeing this young person really get a kick out of it.
I:9527;357;Once I watched it, I remembered how brilliant and ahead of his time Alfred Hitchcock really was!!!
I:9527;358;I can tell this film inspired other film makers because some of the imagery in this film felt familiar to me.
I:9527;359;the most successful thing about this film is the creepy atmosphere.
I:9527;360;The actress who plays Rod's mother does a decent job, though.
I:9527;361;Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds was an exceptionaly entertaining movie.
I:9527;362;It was an action packed thriller for the time.
I:9527;363;This 1963 version of Daphny DuMoure's book The Birds, was well portrayed in the movie with exceptional actors.
I:9527;364;Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor did a wonderful job in the spot light.
I:9527;365;They really made the movie their own.
I:9527;366;The romance between the characters Melanie (Tippi Hedren) and Mitch (Tod Taylor) really added more of a dramaic twist to go with all of the films action.
I:9527;367;I like The Birds best I think.
I:9527;368;The bonus features are loaded with information and alone make this a delight to own.
I:9527;369;In spite of the advancements made in special effects and computer graphics in the nearly forty years since it was originally released, THE BIRDS still manages to be extremely convincing in its own way, and terrifying as well.
I:9527;370;key on the acting side that at the same time has ever been this strikingly well made.
I:9527;371;But there is clearly a great deal of psychological tension, and this is far more disturbing than any long.
I:9527;372;Even better, one can clearly see the influence this film has had on Steven Spielberg, whose two suspense masterpieces DUEL and JAWS clearly owe a debt to the Master.
I:9527;373;if one can get past the film's age, and the arguably dated special effects work, one is left with one of the most brilliant and chilling horror movies of all times.
I:9527;374;It is rated 'PG.13' for scenes of tension and slightly bloody violence, but it is yet one more masterpiece in Hitchcock's lengthy and distinguished canon.
I:9527;375;this is the best movie ever made just loved it and cant wait to watch is again and again great price also
I:9527;376;This movie I think is an all time great movie to watch now and then.
I:9527;377;I would recommend to a friend if you never seen.
I:9527;378;Thank you for the quick ship too!
I:9527;379;Alfred Hitchcock really made it good when he made this movie.
I:9527;380;the plot was really exciting in this one.
I:9527;381;I would recommend The Birds II: Lands End also, because it was more of a make of the book instead of a sequel.
I:9527;382;The Birds is a HORRIFYINGLY MAGNIFICENT film, and deserves more appreciation than it gets.
I:9527;383;This film is more than meets the eye, the birds.
I:9527;384;You must watch closely to find the messages, so that you can fully enjoy it.
I:9527;385;No, The Birds may not be as complex as Psycho or Vertigo, but it is the symolism and sheer TERROR that sets it apart.
I:9527;386;The actors and actresses did a very good job with fitting the roles that they were playing.
I:9527;387;i think even the little girls did a good job in their roles.
I:9527;388;the reason is,are the birds happy because they have a village to themselves?
I:9527;389;This was never one of my Hitchcock favorites.
I:9527;390;About the movie itself, well I don't need to tell, this was under Hitchcock, a master of movie making.
I:9527;391;This is a classic and the best film that Alfred Hitchcock has made.
I:9527;392;Even though the film has gotten some negative remarks, I still think it is excellent and has good scenes.
I:9527;393;Tippi Hedren looks radiant and does a fine job playing Melanie Daniels.
I:9527;394;Time has a way of qualifing our initial assesment of films, and this is particularly true of films made by director Alfred Hitchcock (1899.1980.)
I:9527;395;"Films that had been earlier dismissed were recognized as great classics
I:9527;396;evaluation continues today, and at this point one film in particular proves extremely contentious to critics: THE BIRDS, which was considered both extremely innovative and a great shocker in 1963 but which is now teetering on the brink of critical dismissal.
I:9527;397;"according to film lore, Hitchcock was intrigued by a newspaper story about a ""bird attack,"" and his interest in the story gradually evolved into THE BIRDS."
I:9527;398;tHE BIRDS is primarily famous for the sheer number of disconcerting and often stunning set ups it creates for the birds' attacks.
I:9527;399;but the sheer brilliance of these set pieces is off.
I:9527;400;Stories and scripts of Hitchcock films are usually very tight and very precise, but where THE BIRDS is concerned you could drive a Mac Truck through the gaps.
I:9527;401;"But I'm an ""art film"" fan myself, and I can't see it."
I:9527;402;commercial action and adventure films than it is to an art.
I:9527;403;At its best, THE BIRDS has an incredibly high level of artistry, and those moments really do carry the film and impress themselves in your mind in a most remarkable way.
I:9527;404;I offer my own experience as an example.
I:9527;405;And that's cinematic power, nothing else.
I:9527;406;Final comment: it's extremely uneven, but it is also extremely powerful.
I:9527;407;Watching that makes the movie just that much better, because it illustrates the true genius of Hitchcock's moviemaking.
I:9527;408;As much as I love his other films, The Birds is my favorite Hitchcock film.
I:9527;409;I have seen it more times than I can count since then.
I:9527;410;it is still so impressive what Hitchcock was able to do with 1963 technology.
I:9527;411;This is one of the many reasons why this film was such an achievement.
I:9527;412;Regarding the cast, Rod Taylor was a fine, macho leading man and one of my favorites of the 1960s after starring in this and George Pal's The Time Machine.
I:9527;413;Suzanne Pleshette is fine in an early role as his previous girlfriend and the school teacher in the town of Bodega Bay, where this takes place.
I:9527;414;Jessica Tandy, years before her best actress Oscar for Driving Miss Daisy is also excellent as his mother.
I:9527;415;And finally theres Tippi Hedren, the beautiful blonde discovered by Hitchcock after viewing her in a toothpaste commercial while Hitch was watching the Today Show.
I:9527;416;Hedren was one of the cool sophisticated blondes loved by Hitchcock (and this eventually led to problems on their next film, Marnie.)
I:9527;417;Tippi is just so classy and beautiful to look at and gives a very nice performance considering the fact that she had almost no acting experience.
I:9527;418;Tippi is absolutely wonderful and was even better in a difficult role in her next (and last) Hitchcock film, Marnie.
I:9527;419;The film is also loaded with many interesting character actors in small roles: Charles McGraw, Richard Deacon, Lonny Chapman, Karl Swenson, etc., all giving entertaining performances.
I:9527;420;I've met Tippi Hedren twice and mentioned to her what the writer told me which got her good and annoyed.
I:9527;421;I thought this was strange then and I do now.
I:9527;422;time classic, one of my favorite films of all time.
I:9527;423;Hitchcock still remains as the master of suspense!
I:9527;424;But still, a very good movie.
I:9527;425;Great movie, love the Hitchcock thrillers.
I:9527;426;The creepy aspects of the film still holds up today.
I:9527;427;Give it try if you enjoy good classics!
I:9527;428;i really love this film.
I:9527;429;hitchcock made a good choice.
I:9527;430;i read the book and I got scared.
I:9527;431;my two local movie thiters are showing Hitchcock films.
I:9527;432;i have seen the movie more than 4 times and it gets beter every time.
I:9527;433;tippi Hedren makes a stunning performance and she is absalutly betufill.
I:9527;434;hitchcock's camio is easy to find.
I:9527;435;Hitchcock's last truly great film, The Birds, is an anomaly in his oeuvre by being based on a supernatural force, rather than the motives and machinations of his characters.
I:9527;436;And as a supernatural film, it opens itself to interpretation of what the real.
I:9527;437;I believe that a persuasive case can be made that the birds are the manifestation of the mother's rage at rivals for her son's affection.
I:9527;438;She is introduced walking across the street to a pet shop.
I:9527;439;when Melanie arrives, she receives a great deal of helpful exposition about the layout of the town.
I:9527;440;She notices the birds in the car.
I:9527;441;"Melanie's confident ""Thank you,"" and toss of the head is priceless."
I:9527;442;"now that I'm no longer a threat we're very good friends."""
I:9527;443;At that moment a gull smashes into the front door.
I:9527;444;The wordless sequence in which she explores the house, finds the body, and reacts showcases Hitchcock's wonderful ability to tell a story entirely visually.
I:9527;445;She then becomes emotional and articulates her fear of being left alone.
I:9527;446;The survivors, huddled inside, are made up entirely of women [save one male child].
I:9527;447;She then catches herself and apologizes.
I:9527;448;She is attacked by the birds.
I:9527;449;The first scene in the bird shop sets up the flirtation between Mitch and Melanie, establishes Melanie's character as a brash, confident modern woman, and draws the connection between the two of them and the birds.
I:9527;450;the scene in which Melanie fist meets Lydia in the diner is interesting, as it portrays the three women [Melanie, Lydia, and Annie] as somewhat interchangeable.
I:9527;451;both of their outfits matching their hair color.
I:9527;452;"Lydia also replicates Annie's reaction to the lovebirds: ""Oh I see."""
I:9527;453;What sets Melanie apart is her confidence, specifically that she can manipulate men at her will.
I:9527;454;which is fairly remarkable, considering her general antipathy toward Melanie.
I:9527;455;The two important points of this conversation are that Melanie offers to go check on Cathy, taking Lydia's fears seriously and seeking to ally them, and also that Melanie asks if it's so important for Lydia to like Mitch's girlfriends.
I:9527;456;The story, acting, and editing of the filmis so fantastic.
I:9527;457;This is one of the best of Alfred Hitchcock's works.
I:9527;458;As a Hitchcock fan I have seen 90 percent of what he has done, including the early stuff and this is a solid classic by the Master of Suspense.
I:9527;459;Rod Taylor's solid performance, as the steadfast Mitch Brenner who gradually realizes (but cannot fathom why) that things are beyond even his control, is pivotal to the progression of the story.
I:9527;460;This film is a masterpiece full of vivid histrionics running the gamut of human emotions.
I:9527;461;After bumping into a handsome bachelor in a pet.
I:9527;462;The title features a play on words: the two love.
I:9527;463;But the real interest is in the birds of the feathered kind, and their conflict with mankind.
I:9527;464;The arrival of Megan and the love.
I:9527;465;The first ominous sign comes when a lone sea.
I:9527;466;the movie begins slowly with comedy, with a gradual suspenseful build.
I:9527;467;Slowly the suspense increases, with moments of high drama accompanied by spine.
I:9527;468;Part of this is deliberate, with Hitchcock leaving the reason for the attacks unexplained to increase the sense of fear in the real world.
I:9527;469;But Du Maurier's he original concept is brilliant: the idea of bird attacks makes the predictable unpredictable and challenges our complacency.
I:9527;470;in many subtle ways the sense of fear grows and is increased by the production .
I:9527;471;such as one memorable instance when Megan is seated on a bench not realizing that flocks of birds are gathering behind her, whereas the audience is fully aware of this fact.
I:9527;472;The movie was outstanding for its time because of the technical difficulties in shooting superimposed images of birds on an existing film.
I:9527;473;This was cutting edge technology in its day, and was pulled off very successfully.
I:9527;474;"Considering the limitations imposed by the technology of the day, ""The Birds"" is a remarkable contribution to the world of movies, and another great feather in Hitchcock's cap."
I:9527;475;But it can hardly be regarded as his best, and there are undoubtedly better movies both by Hitchcock and others.
I:9527;476;Definitely worth a look, but once is probably enough.
I:9527;477;This film is of course a classic, but I was rather dissapointed when I saw it.
I:9527;478;In fact, my sister and I laughed so hard we had to rewind and watch it four times!
I:9527;479;If you can get through the first half, this movie is pretty good.
I:9527;480;It was very scary and exciting!
I:9527;481;it was a nice look back at the way people dressed at the time, furniture, cars we drove.
I:9527;482;"This movie and ""Psycho"" are my fave Hitchcock movies."
I:9527;483;"I guess ""Birds"" is my fave color Hitchcock movie and ""Psycho"" my fave B&W Hitchcock movie."
I:9527;484;The Birds is a good movie.
I:9527;485;It was one of the best Alfred Hithcock movies ever made.
I:9527;486;It is great to watch as a family but also a great intense movie.
I:9527;487;The Birds is a great scary movie for any occasion, it is just fun to watch.
I:9527;488;Great movie that stands the test of time.
I:9527;489;The film has not dated at all and still is among my favorite Hitchcock films.
I:9527;490;Story, star performances and good production values makes this a treat .
I:9527;491;seeming premise (most people today, hearing about it, probably can't even imagine it would be at all frightening) and turns into an excellent suspense and horror film.
I:9527;492;A great movie that stands true today and doesnt need the multimillion dollar special effects most newer movies rely on.
I:9527;493;Tippi Hedren is very good in it and, god, is she beautiful!
I:9527;494;For me it's about people and their frailties in the wake of nature and their surroundings.
I:9527;495;Robert Burks' cinematography and Ub Iwerks' special effects go hand in hand.
I:9527;496;"on the other hand we may realize this is one the most sarcastic films of Hitchcock: When in the first part of the film Rod Taylor catches the canary and brings it back to its cage and smiling says to Tippi Hedren: ""I bring you to your golden cage"", is a caustic allusion to her, because of the fact she is a rich and consented girl."
I:9527;497;And you know the mythical roots around the significance of this special avis, and finally a very curious casualty perhaps?
I:9527;498;one of my eternal favorite films of Hitchcock, because carves in relief the suspense in Hitchcock was always a device and not a goal by itself.
I:9527;499;Such a great old classic.
I:9527;500;She's wanted it for her video library for a long time.
I:9527;501;This is by far my favorite of Alfred Hitchcock's movies.
I:9527;502;Apart from knowing of Psycho, this movie I got introduced to when I was a child and it still remains a classic for me to this day.
I:9527;503;I recommend this movie to anyone everywhere I go.
I:9527;504;It's a worthy addition to anyone's movie collection.
I:9527;505;First of all, The Birds is a brilliant example of the sci.
I:9527;506;it's a simple matter of questions.
I:9527;507;(And if Hitchcock ever succumbed to an openly fantastic detail, as in the final sequence of Family Plot , that introduction was clearly with the director's tongue firmly planted in his cheek. )
I:9527;508;With the confidence of a great master, the movie.
I:9527;509;"making in The Birds is quite simple (open and closed shots
I:9527;510;Elegantly, the movie opens with a comic scenario that involves us within the lives of plain romantic somebodies.
I:9527;511;"The relationships between the women in this movie are so well constructed and performed (the looks in their eyes
I:9527;512;The building of the suspense, the progression from one strange behaviour of one bird to a mass attack from flocks, schools and shoals of birds is still perfect.
I:9527;513;The drunkie who finds in the Bible the perfect explanation of the end of the world brought by birds.
I:9527;514;This is a new way of looking at the world.
I:9527;515;The suspense and horror is well played.
I:9527;516;Ahead of his time with computer animations as well.
I:9527;517;Still entertaining and attention getting.
I:9527;518;Worth watching again even though the technology has improved now with computer graphics.
I:9527;519;I've seen the trailer for the film, and it's very humourous, and obviously Hitchcock wanted to have a lot of fun with his audience.
I:9527;520;It's an interesting idea, especially since the reason for the attacks is omitted in the film, which is one of the things that I like about it.
I:9527;521;The performers are good, especially Suzanne Pleshette, and although I don't think Tippi Hedren was the greatest actress to appear before a camera, I think she's better than most people give her credit for, especially considering that the actors are secondary to all that is happening in the film.
I:9527;522;She looks great, and projects a certain detached coolness, which is appropriate for the character.
I:9527;523;The special effects are good (condsidering the time), and the tension slowly builds with each attack.
I:9527;524;For me, this is a fun movie to watch, well made and very effective for its purpose.
I:9527;525;My absolute favorite Hitchcock movie!
I:9527;526;The school scene may be the best ever in horror!
I:9527;527;Great effects for it's day!
I:9527;528;An Alfred Hitchcock classic!If you like thrillers, you'll like this one.
I:9527;529;Miss Daniels takes a sudden interest in this dashing man, so she pretends to work in the shop for the man who requested her help.
I:9527;530;THE BIRDS has always been my favorite Hitch film.
I:9527;531;All the wonderful traits we've come to love and expect in a Hitchcock film are here: suspense, moments of terror, and counter.
I:9527;532;balancing those, needed moments of humor.
I:9527;533;Included is the telling of Hitchcock's original ending, an example of Hitch's story.
I:9527;534;As well make the ENDING make sense!
I:9527;535;lets see how the Birds stacked up.
I:9527;536;I made an exception for Strays, I can for this.
I:9527;537;If you think not having a clue what you're suposed to pretend you're doing constitutes Good acting .
I:9527;538;See it once, you'll like it, though you'll find it laughable.
I:9527;539;It was supposed to be serious, but it was hilarious.
I:9527;540;I am glad I finally got this movie.
I:9527;541;First, let me say that Hitchcock's film, The Birds, was hailed as a brilliant film when it was first released, and it still is thought of as a masterpiece today.
I:9527;542;hitchcock must have taken great pleasure in starting out with what seemed to be a light romantic film with amusing conflict among women for what seems to be a perfect man.
I:9527;543;But audiences are watching and waiting, knowing .
I:9527;544;It's a sudden pivotal moment of awareness of birds as a source of fear.
I:9527;545;birds is an excellent film.
I:9527;546;One of hitchcocks best but not as good a psycho
I:9527;547;thanks it's a grat movie a classic and I needed it for my collection.
I:9527;548;A classic I haven't seen in some time.
I:9527;549;It holds up well and the chill factor is almost the same as when I saw it as a kid.
I:9527;550;Probably Hitchcock's most famous movie (apart from PSYCHO), THE BIRDS is perhaps best understood as a companion piece to the director's favorite among all his films, SHADOW OF A DOUBT.
I:9527;551;"free ""score"" by Bernard Herrmann and Hitchcock's tremendous build."
I:9527;552;up of suspense make the film one of his greatest among his later and more flawed classics.
I:9527;553;The acting is at times very unexpected (and thus unlike the flawless performances of Teresa Wright, Joseph Cotten and Patricia Collinge in SHADOW OF A DOUBT), but Rod Taylor is perhaps the most virile leading man Hitchcock ever had, and Jessica Tandy does odd and memorable things with the role of Taylor's neurotic and possessive mother.
I:9527;554;Her beautiful green Edith Head coat and gloves which she wears for most of the film are among the most iconic outfits ever created for a film, and there are moments (particularly towards the end of the film, after she's been severely traumatized by a bird attack) when her affective qualities are undeniable.
I:9527;555;This is a good Hitchcock film not my favorite but still good, The bird thing seems really unbelievable but I like the cinamatography and the actors, as well as how Hitchcock captures the feel of the1960s and the California coast .
I:9527;556;it still is a good story and worthwhile to any Collection of Alfred Hitchcock.
I:9527;557;This is a movie I watched when I was younger and I still love to this day.
I:9527;558;Good for individuals who like classic suspense movies.
I:9527;559;This is one of those movies I never tire of.
I:9527;560;Even though I know the story and how it will end, I still enjoy watching it.
I:9527;561;I've watched a lot of Alfred Hitchcock's movies and this one is still one of my favorites.
I:9527;562;Still scares me as it did when I was a child 45 years ago.
I:9527;563;This is an American classic that should be required viewing.
I:9527;564;I still liked the movie though but, it would have been nice to see it all the way to the end.
I:9527;565;he keeps a good pace throught the movie, a must have for any fan of horror.
I:9527;566;Universal, obviously, takes great care of their master copies.
I:9527;567;Psycho is equally as superb.
I:9527;568;The Universal Monsters boxed set is incredible also.
I:9527;569;We will enjoy these for years to come!
I:9527;570;The Birds was the first Hitchcock movie I ever saw as a kid, and it is still the best to me.
I:9527;571;Tippy Hedron is perfect as the Paris Hilton of 1963.
I:9527;572;Rod Taylor is a great hero.
I:9527;573;I know all the lines and still have to see it again!!
I:9527;574;This is one of my favorite classic movies!
I:9527;575;an important consideration for Hitchcock enthusiasts, given the director's meticulous planning of his films' visual compositions.
I:9527;576;The Birds features some great cinematography, a nerve.
I:9527;577;"wracking soundtrack, and some finely wrought performances (particularly those of Jessica Tandy, Suzanne Pleshette and Ethel Griffies)
I:9527;578;There are a wealth of bonus features, including newsreel footage of Hitchcock and Hedren publicizing the film, an extensive stills gallery, and a fascinating behind the scenes production documentary.
I:9527;579;Especially intriguing are the ad.
I:9527;580;This is such a great movie!
I:9527;581;It's suspenseful and funny at parts.
I:9527;582;The extra features are really neat too: reading the alternate ending and reading about a deleted scene, though reading about the deleted scene was a bit confusing because you weren't really sure where it was supposed to be.
I:9527;583;The documentry was very neat also.
I:9527;584;I seriously enjoyed this movie and I see why people like it so much.
I:9527;585;It's just a really really great movie!!!
I:9527;586;It's one movie that you've just gotta see!
I:9527;587;I saw this movie in the 60s and it was thrilling and a bit scary I thought, but I liked it.
I:9527;588;hay it was a movie and Hitchcock knew what he was doing.
I:9527;589;It is a good movie to see and just remember, all birds are good and friendly.
I:9527;590;Just kidding he's a good bird.
I:9527;591;This movie was a winning one and very well done in it days.
I:9527;592;This Hitchcock movie may be scary and action.
I:9527;593;packed as well as suspenseful, but personally there are better ones.
I:9527;594;One of those films you want to watch over and over again.
I:9527;595;Fun to watch with someone who has never seen it before.
I:9527;596;"Undoubtedly one of Hitchcock's scariest films, the special effects are surprisingly effective for the time
I:9527;597;Rod Taylor is stolid in a role Cary Grant might have done ten years prior, and Tippi Hedren is suitably intriguing as the icy blonde who's a magnet for men.
I:9527;598;This is an astounding film given the technology of the day.
I:9527;599;I am very impressed with the special effects in the movie.
I:9527;600;it is SO easy today to create a realistic artificial reality.
I:9527;601;Shooting this film when it was shot was a work of art.
I:9527;602;I thought it was a good film and I thought it was scary.
I:9527;603;there is a short documentary about the film and I found it to be entertaining.
I:9527;604;if you are a Hitchcock fan this movie is a must see.
I:9527;605;If you are a fan of movie magic and movie technological achievements you will appreciate this movie.
I:9527;606;This was a difficult movie to shoot and Hichcock and his crew did an extremely good job given the technology of the day.
I:9527;607;saw it on the documentary and will go back to watch it in the film.
I:9527;608;The film is full of Hitchcock's subtle jokes and add ins.
I:9527;609;this is a movie I like and a technological achievement which I appreciate.
I:9527;610;ray and it is definitely worth it .
I:9527;611;The color, the sharpness, everything makes this Blu.
I:9527;612;the birds represent all of those social changes that were soon to tear up the fabric of american society.
I:9527;613;I loved and hated it for that reason.
I:9527;614;The Birds (1963) is another horror masterpiece from Alfred Hitchcock, right up there with Psycho (1960).
I:9527;615;this was the first Hitchcock movie I ever saw.
I:9527;616;I can appreciate this movie's special effects, even though they're nothing compared to today's CGI special effects.
I:9527;617;For a movie that came out in 1963, it's pretty impressive.
I:9527;618;The CGI effects of today are obviously done on a computer.
I:9527;619;Melanie and Mitch are attacked viciously as well (especially Melanie).
I:9527;620;'Tippi' Hedren carries this movie.
I:9527;621;She's a looker and can act well.
I:9527;622;This is one of the most scenic movies I've ever seen, shot in San Francisco and Bodega Bay, California.
I:9527;623;The absence of music for most of the movie is highly effective at creating the right feel and atmosphere.
I:9527;624;i highly recommend this horror classic.
I:9527;625;I recommend that you watch The Birds.
I:9527;626;If you are into Drama and Suspense, you absolutely NEED to see this movie!
I:9527;627;THE BIRDS is one of Hitchcock's most terrifying films, if the most.
I:9527;628;That is a question THE BIRDS wisely chooses not to answer.
I:9527;629;A wonderfully executed suspense film that is terrifying because its us against nature.
I:9527;630;Highly recommended movie from the master of horror, Alfred Hitchcock.
I:9527;631;I've always felt kind of ambivalent about The Birds.
I:9527;632;Every time I see it I find myself losing interest in the overdeveloped story until the brilliant restaurant scene, where everything is suddenly funny and entertaining and offbeat.
I:9527;633;Of course it's good to have deep, rounded characters in a movie like this instead of just a bunch of thick.
I:9527;634;But I seem to be in the minority on this one, so if you love this movie go ahead and get it.
I:9527;635;as one reviewer here so rightly stated, the extras here are quite staggering, particularly that documentary, which is the best I've seen on any film, ever.
I:9527;636;You genuinely do learn more about the making of every aspect of the film than you could possibly have hoped for, especially in how Hitchcock brought his vision to the screen (the part where you learn that Hitch enjoyed the pre.
I:9527;637;as for the film itself, well it still stands the test of time as one of the most perfect examples of visual film making that you'll ever see.
I:9527;638;Hitchcock's always treated the viewer with respect, allowing countless scenes of little or no dialolgue to tell the story.
I:9527;639;True, some may have tried, such as the interesting but hugely flawed THE CELL, but it does seem that film makers like Hitchcock are a very rare species indeed.
I:9527;640;the closest anyone has got to successfully matching or replicating Hitchcock's suspenseful style would be in Robert Zemeckis's jumpy and atmospheric WHAT LIES BENEATH, but at the end of the day there is and always will be only one true master of terror and suspense .
I:9527;641;It is one of the best scenes in the movie.
I:9527;642;we bought it after going to visit Bodega Bay up the coast from San Francisco so it was fun to be there and see the places in the movie.
I:9527;643;These people turned around (after I gave them the right one) and mailed it right back at NO extra charge.
I:9527;644;When we receaved the movie it was in excellent condishion.
I:9527;645;thank You for your help and the great movie
I:9527;646;It's a great spooky film, a little on the claustrophobic side as there's no place to run, get away or be safe.
I:9527;647;That's always one of my favorite themes in movies!!!!
I:9527;648;Tippi Hedren is as beautiful and classy as ever, a perfect role for her.
I:9527;649;It holds up over time because it centers on people and what they do in scary circumstances.
I:9527;650;Hitchcock did this on purpose.
I:9527;651;if you're a fan of Hitchcock or old movies and thriller's this one is perfect.
I:9527;652;Lots of extras very interesting and amusing.
I:9527;653;This may now be one of my favorite movies of all time
I:9527;654;I have always liked this movie and, now that it is part of my library, I love being able to watch it whenever I want.
I:9527;655;I really enjoy perusing the drawing board sketches for scenes that were never filmed.
I:9527;656;This is a good movie for family viewing, but not for young children under the age of 7 or so.
I:9527;657;"I'm a big Hitchcock fan, and ""Marnie"" is my favorite Hitchcock movie."
I:9527;658;She is the typical cold, blonde heroine that Hitchcock favored, but my, what subtext!
I:9527;659;the gas explosion with the flashes of Tippie's face, for example.
I:9527;660;The scenes between Tippie and the mother, between Tippie and Suzanne Pleshette: the actresses and the screenwriters don't make the obvious choices and that's part of what makes these movies so fun to watch again and again.
I:9527;661;The scene with the woman birder in the cafe is very enjoyable.
I:9527;662;While not a great movie, it is worth having in your collection if you enjoy tension, great acting and writing, and a few giggles at the melodrama.
I:9527;663;I thought The Birds was a really good movie.
I:9527;664;I liked how they didn't use music when the birds started attacking them.
I:9527;665;The actors were really good.
I:9527;666;Alfred Hitchcock is a good writer.
I:9527;667;I think this is one of his really good books.
I:9527;668;the part when the crows were standing on the jungle gym was funny.
I:9527;669;Mitch (Rod Taylor) did a good job at playing his part.
I:9527;670;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
I:9527;671;I'm only 32 and I enjoyed this film for the fact that there was no such thing as computer generated effects in 1962.
I:9527;672;Disney contributed to the effects and it works.
I:9527;673;What can you say, a classic movie by a venerated director.
I:9527;674;suspense and action without nudity.
I:9527;675;This is a great movie, and actually extremely influential in the horror genre.
I:9527;676;I loved it and actually found it to be pretty creepy and scary.
I:9527;677;And that's a compliment to the genre.
I:9527;678;Definitely recommend if you haven't seen this yet.
I:9527;679;No CGI just fantastic scenery of Bodega Bay.
I:9527;680;Deep insight into the workings of the female mind.
I:9527;681;Hedren is a classic ice.
I:9527;682;"princess
I:9527;683;The rural setting makes an interesting backdrop for unexpected thrills.
I:9527;684;You'll be on the edge of your seat, waiting for the next attack of The Birds!
I:9527;685;The Birds is perfect for 5.1.
I:9527;686;The Birds is classic Hithcock with a building suspense of horror of nature hitting back at man for changing its enviroment .
I:9527;687;The product was exactly as described, fast delivery and I'm very happy.
I:9527;688;The price was very reasonable.
I:9527;689;I recommend this seller and the movie.
I:9527;690;He said he though this was his most suspenseful movie .
I:9527;691;"Before long the birds begin to get aggressive and unleash an entertaining look at the man called ""Hitchcock""."
I:9527;692;the special features include interviews with an older Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren.
I:9527;693;"The young Jessica Tandy is seen in the film as beautiful as ever
I:9527;694;"the special features also take a good technical look at how all the bird sequences were made
I:9527;695;i enjoy this film more today than I ever did in the sixties.
I:9527;696;definitely worth viewing as a Hitchcock creation or simply as a film.
I:9527;697;This is such a classic film by the master of all suspense films, Hitchcock.
I:9527;698;The buildup, the subtle anticipation, they are so perfect in this film.
I:9527;699;It is interesting enough to get three stars, but not nearly good enough for four.
I:9527;700;That has to diminish the impact of this movie.
I:9527;701;There's a woman prankster, rich, without emotion, lying and playing with people.
I:9527;702;New, fresh Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor made a charming romantic comedy on the pet shop scene at the beginning, which was very delightful to watch.
I:9527;703;The enormous birds invasion scenes with gorgeous, stylish Tippi Hedren's great performance, remains unforgetable Hitchcock masterpiece even today.
I:9527;704;I saw this movie when it first came out and thought it was great!
I:9527;705;This 1963 Alfred Hitchcock thriller has all the retro elements of the time .
I:9527;706;cigarettes, a beautiful blond with a sculptured hairdo and a tiny waistline and a male.
I:9527;707;It also has a scary premise .
I:9527;708;He spends his weekends with his mother, played by Jessica Tandy, and his younger sister in a small California town.
I:9527;709;When she gets to the town she meets an old girlfriend of his played by Suzanne Pleshette and they soon become friends.
I:9527;710;The attacks get more and more intense.
I:9527;711;It is all visually stunning and a pleasure to watch.
I:9527;712;What kind of a statement is the film making?
I:9527;713;I really did enjoy the film.
I:9527;714;There's suspense, strong story line and memorable characters to keep me interested and at the edge of my seat.
I:9527;715;This has always been my very favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie.
I:9527;716;one of the great classics.
I:9527;717;Classic thriller at its best!
I:9527;718;My 10 and 12 year old found it very interesting and exciting too!
I:9527;719;Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed the Birds.
I:9527;720;The start of The Birds already have you feeling intense.
I:9527;721;The acting style was oddly fascinating, understated I guess.
I:9527;722;If you like Hitchcock this is one of his best.
I:9527;723;And I love that it doesn't have a soundtrack.
I:9527;724;And the whole picture is misframed .
I:9527;725;This is a movie meant to have no music, with a great reliance on silence and the creepy electronic bird sounds.
I:9527;726;Great movie with a great blu.
I:9527;727;I can only imagine what Hitchcock could do with the technology they have today.
I:9527;728;But I've grown to love it and the scenes of Bodaga Bay are really nice.
I:9527;729;The book is always better than the film.
I:9527;730;I really enjoyed reading this story as I had only seen the movie.
I:9527;731;This film greatly changes the way I feel about birds.
I:9527;732;Once, I loved their songs, their feathers, and their wings.
I:9527;733;Watching them fly gracefully across the sky could raise my spirit and inspire me in my activities.
I:9527;734;This is a great film to show a class of students, where each student then writes a sequel explaining what they think would happen next and what the birds' motives are.
I:9527;735;This is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie.
I:9527;736;For anyone who remembers the Alfred Hitchcock hour and how entertaining his work still is.
I:9527;737;And for anyone who wants to experience a classic.
I:9527;738;We chose this movie after a recent family outing to Bodega Bay.
I:9527;739;the premise, by today's standards, seems shockingly simple.
I:9527;740;The item was in perfect condition.
I:9527;741;Tippie Hedren is a wonderful actress and this is classic Hitchcock at his best!
I:9527;742;The Birds (Collector's Edition)The movie is a classic Hitchcock.
I:9527;743;I've loved this film since I was a kid and still do.
I:9527;744;I would def recommend this classic.
I:9527;745;My recommendation is to watch the movie late at night with the color turned off, and enjoy one of Hitchcock's best.
I:9527;746;Great acting and plot .
I:9527;747;will make most people very nervous/very fast.
I:9527;748;I recommend everyone to watch this classic.
I:9527;749;I hadn't seen this movie since I was twelve, it was still very gripping and the blu ray was superb.
I:9527;750;"Along with ""Psycho"", this is definitive Hitchcock."
I:9527;751;Truly astonishing bird attacks are realistically done and the film becomes a sort of sci.
I:9527;752;Just an incredible film and the soundtrack alone of birds flapping and screeching will shred your nerves.
I:9527;753;The two are destined to be destined for each other.
I:9527;754;It's like I've just suspected: the film is a masterpiece.
I:9527;755;And NONE of the characters are even faintly likeable.
I:9527;756;But once the birds really take a special dislikin'.
I:9527;757;The scene in which the gas station explodes I dug special.
I:9527;758;If I could change my rating I'd now give the movie four stars, subtracting one star for how mind.
I:9527;759;He's a real mamma's boy.
I:9527;760;The Birds is one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock films.
I:9527;761;Perhaps that has a lot to do with the beautiful Tippi Hedren, who shines in everything she does.
I:9527;762;The gorgeous scenery, adorable costumes, and lavish colors also add to the surreal atmosphere, which quickly gets disrupted by a flock of killer birds.
I:9527;763;breaking addition to the horror genre and further revealed the master director's darker obsessions.
I:9527;764;hailed as one of Hitchcock's masterpieces by some and despised by others, THE BIRDS is certainly among the director's more complex and fascinating works.
I:9527;765;eerie, scary, and suspenseful, this is a great film and classic Hitchcock, which highlights his genius.
I:9527;766;The scenes of birds attacking humans are truly upsetting, the more so since Hitchcock provides only a potential allegory as a subtext for meaning.
I:9527;767;Instead, he uses the lovely Tippi Hedren as the locus of the film as one who not only provides a romantic interest for Taylor but as one who seems somehow inexplicably intertwined with the avian assaults on humanity.
I:9527;768;She is the one who is physically present in every scene of such attacks.
I:9527;769;But Hitchcock is a master at pricking beneath the skin in a manner that pays no heed to logic.
I:9527;770;So effective is Hitchcock at focusing our attention on Hedren that we do not feel cheated at being denied a more rational explanation.
I:9527;771;Thus, THE BIRDS emerges as a thriller that proves once again that the implication of horror is often more chilling than its blunt reality.
I:9527;772;Felt this was a good Alfred Hitchcock film.
I:9527;773;"The Birds is one of my favorite ""summertime"" movies."
I:9527;774;the setting, the characters, the suspense, it's all terrific.
I:9527;775;the special effects, especially for the 1960's, are superb!
I:9527;776;this horror film is lightened by unintentionally funny scenes.
I:9527;777;The mother does a great job of giving Melanie the icy stare down, although it's a bit over the top.
I:9527;778;Aside from all this fun, there is Hitchcock's masterful direction, the wonderful location shots in San Francisco and Bodega Bay, and the well.
I:9527;779;paced plot to make this a great film.
I:9527;780;maybe not a great introduction to Hitchcock, but required viewing for true fans.
I:9527;781;of documentary is quite good and approximately an hour long.
I:9527;782;I love movie title here and he always considered it to be one of his best films.
I:9527;783;Finally, Tippi Hedron's screen tests were great to watch.
I:9527;784;I discovered the way Ms. Hedren was discovered and cast by Mr. Hitchcock.
I:9527;785;She was being made into a star, with lessons from The Master himself!
I:9527;786;The rest of the documentary covers every aspect of THE BIRDS: from makeup, to sound, to effects.
I:9527;787;Having not seen it for years, I was first impressed with the story.
I:9527;788;Her vulnerability mixes well with her blond.
I:9527;789;And when she and Tandy finally connect as characters, it is truly moving.
I:9527;790;The trailer is hilarious .
I:9527;791;one of Hitch's witty speaches.
I:9527;792;He really was a genius director as well as a shrewd publicity man.
I:9527;793;This is a fun movie.
I:9527;794;Its Alfred Hitchcock, he's a genius.
I:9527;795;That kind of behaviour is extremely unusual in gulls, according to local people.
I:9527;796;"from my point of view, ""The birds"" is one of Hitchcock's best films, even though my personal favorite is ""Vertigo""."
I:9527;797;I would like to highlight the fact that this film manages to mix suspense, action and terror, throwing in a developing love story and some characters that you cannot help but care about.
I:9527;798;I just bought 'The Avengers' a huge blockbuster movie recent movie for twenty bucks.
I:9527;799;We always enjoy Hitchcock movies.
I:9527;800;the special effects that are employed in the attacks by thebirds are outstanding.
I:9527;801;their safety is in peril throughoutthe entire movie.
I:9527;802;this is a classic movie.
I:9527;803;It will keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:9527;804;As a family movie, we watched several times, very good classic.
I:9527;805;We have fun and a good time watching this movie.
I:9527;806;After the stellar job on the blu.
I:9527;807;There are a ton of process shots here, and hopefully they will remaster the film properly.
I:9527;808;Loneliness, family, fear of abandonment.
I:9527;809;It's classic Hitchcock at it's best.
I:9527;810;And this copy looks great!
I:9527;811;They did an amazing job on remastering the picture.
I:9527;812;tHE BIRDS is the best of Hitchcock!!!!
I:9527;813;This movie is a solid classic.
I:9527;814;Not the darkest Hitchcock film but definitely a good one.
I:9527;815;Starts out slow but builds to an interesting experience
I:9527;816;"I feel a little guilty giving this, one of my very favorite films, only four stars
I:9527;817;"I found her ""soul baring"" scene with young Cathy on the hillside to be PARTICULARLY embarrassing."
I:9527;818;One can only fantasize how, let's say, a young Ellen Burstyn, would have handled the Melanie role.
I:9527;819;But hey, as far as acting goes, a superb (and rare) film performance by a middle.
I:9527;820;In the most effective, Malevolence, even if quashed, will leave seeds behind.
I:9527;821;In this regard, chalk up five stars for Mr. Hitchcock's brave and apocalyptic finale to a horrific masterpiece of infinite implication.
I:9527;822;Very cool!Today, I hold a doctorate, perhaps am a little wiser, definitely a little nicer and, although I still have foul acquaintances and colleagues that I wouldn't mind seeing pecked apart, I have never been more impressed, or awed, by the Master's, Alfred Hitchcock's, unqualified brilliance in filmmaking.
I:9527;823;No question, Mitch is mighty sharp.
I:9527;824;infinitely scarier than the lunging gull that bloodies Melanie's scalp while motor.
I:9527;825;"More likely, the ""birds of the world"" that are ""uniting,"" as referenced in the ""discarded"" materials, address deeply personal, social, psychological, and esoteric matters, which Hitchcock weaves into the film."
I:9527;826;Alternating cycles of volatile psychic confrontation, symbolized by the bird attacks, ingeniously frame the film's characters in sundry combinations of intense interaction.
I:9527;827;She reproaches his choice of female companions who fuel her fear of abandonment.
I:9527;828;This is brilliance, pure and simple.
I:9527;829;filling birth pangs of a remarkably mature, mother.
I:9527;830;absorption, two local merchants, in a memorable scene, profess to know the Brenners, yet cannot correctly name Mitch's sister.
I:9527;831;This is a powerful metaphor of the sacred feminine pouring her spirit from the unseen heavenly realm to earth as projected light.
I:9527;832;Melanie's gift of the sedate, cooing lovebirds provides her with excellent therapy to recover from her own physical and psychic shock.
I:9527;833;striking exactly the same pose she is in when she is found dead on her front stairs near the end of the movie.
I:9527;834;That image of her dead is one of the most striking things in the film because you've seen it before.
I:9527;835;The connection is so subtle that you only make the connection after repeated viewings.
I:9527;836;Only Hitchcock could pull something like that off so beautifully.
I:9527;837;He really was a genius.
I:9527;838;The Birds is one of my favorite movies.
I:9527;839;The movie is still good and scary after so many years.
I:9527;840;This is a masterpiece movie by one of the greatest movie makers.
I:9527;841;Would recommend for anyone who has not seen this movie the plot is OK the special effects are great for the time highly recommended
I:9527;842;She is warm, kind and beautiful and Cathy really likes her and Mitch's mom is starting to come around, Oh no!
I:9527;843;Watch and see mu ha ha ha.
I:9527;844;hitchcock's concept is interesting as our bird expert points out earlier in the film.
I:9527;845;One of Hitchcock's best films.
I:9527;846;I ordered this movie for a film class that I was teaching.
I:9527;847;Just goes to show you that Hitchcock can even appeal to the modern, over.
I:9527;848;The suspense that Hitchcock creates is the best part of the movie with my students trying to guess what is going to happen next and alternatives not matching what is given to them.
I:9527;849;i would definitely recommend this movie as an alternative to the messes that pass for horror and suspense nowadays.
I:9527;850;"up to ""Psycho"" he chose and unknown actress from the ranks of runway models to star in the film."
I:9527;851;She goes along with it, in an effective flirting scene.
I:9527;852;hitchcock manages to bring a modicum of suspense leading up to the various attacks.
I:9527;853;Regardless of the back story, the scene is very gruesome and very effective.
I:9527;854;The Birds is a serviceable thriller and certainly deserves praise for some of the technical achievements of its day.
I:9527;855;Whether it is one of the great director's best, I don't think so.
I:9527;856;Although the high definition improves on previous releases, it is far from perfect.
I:9527;857;At times the film looks murky, the next shot may be terrific.
I:9527;858;The colors look good as does skin tone.
I:9527;859;The audio, even with a cleaned up mono is excellent.
I:9527;860;There are some interesting extras on the disc.
I:9527;861;Usually in movies the music works up when a suspense moment is about to happen and because there is none in the movie everything is so eerie and unexpected.
I:9527;862;I agree the photography was terrific.
I:9527;863;As an adult you will enjoy this for what it is, a horror film with no real villian.
I:9527;864;But this film will keep the kids up at night.
I:9527;865;This was one of his best all out horror films (Only Psycho was better).
I:9527;866;But Hitchcock sets a love story in the middle of it.
I:9527;867;1 hour 19 minute documentary about the making of the film.
I:9527;868;This may sound long but it is a wonderful look not only into the film but Hitchcock.
I:9527;869;This was the original ending for the film.
I:9527;870;This is her original screen test with Martin Balsam and background voice of Hitchcock.
I:9527;871;Screen tests are seldom seen and so this is fun to see.
I:9527;872;This movie is one of those movies that you watch and say wow I just watched that movie now I can do something else
I:9527;873;The movie was very entertaining and displayed Hichcock at his best.
I:9527;874;Besides the excellent performances by the leads, the supporting actors played their part as well.
I:9527;875;I appreciated the supporting feature covering the making of the movie.
I:9527;876;This is an amazing and ingenious film because it doesn't attempt to explain why the birds are attacking.
I:9527;877;I always remembered the special effects looking unrealistic, but I thought they looked very good this time around.
I:9527;878;I am watching the master piece collection and I started with Psycho and the Birds.
I:9527;879;Both are classic horror films and should be in every movie lovers collection.
I:9527;880;It is still one of Hitchcock's best works.
I:9527;881;Still a scary movie after all of these years.
I:9527;882;I LOVED every moment of it.
I:9527;883;It's a classic in it's kind
I:9527;884;Always been a favorite of mine.
I:9527;885;Even today, with all the modern special effects, this movie is grand.
I:9527;886;a wonderful copy of the classic.
I:9527;887;The bonus features are the most interesting.
I:9527;888;This is a great copy.
I:9527;889;"Her novel ""Rebecca"" had provided him with his foray into American movies and the resulting film won a Best Picture Oscar ."
I:9527;890;After a chance meeting in a bird shop in San Francisco, Melanie is determined to get under Mitch's skin by secretly delivering a pair of love birds to his family home in Bodega Bay.
I:9527;891;Skeptical of Melanie's past and quite aware of the burgeoning romance between her son and Melanie, Lydia is determined to keep the two apart.
I:9527;892;But that's where the story ends and the special effects begin.
I:9527;893;The Birds is by far the most technically challenging film in Hitchcock's canon.
I:9527;894;It features complex matte shots, process photography, multi.
I:9527;895;shot sequences and perilous stunt work performed by the principle actors with live birds.
I:9527;896;"Despite these difficulties, the resulting film emerges as Hitchcock's final cinematic triumph
I:9527;897;Though the picture is anamorphically enhanced there is an excessive amount of digital anomalies present throughout.
I:9527;898;Colors on the whole are bright and accurately rendered.
I:9527;899;Extras include a very thorough and entertaining documentary on the making of the film, screen pages and storyboard ideas on how the film was supposed to end, as well as the original theatrical trailer.
I:9527;900;It would be interesting to discover what someone thought who was seeing it for the first time (an older person, since kids today have been inundated with quick cuts and plenty of action.
I:9527;901;This has been and always will be a favorite Hitchcock film.
I:9527;902;I still think it is a very good movie.
I:9527;903;The Birds is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most interesting movies and one of the scariest.
I:9527;904;If you've never seen this movie, watch it!
I:9527;905;That's why it's a classic.
I:9527;906;Good definition and sharp picture.
I:9527;907;Modern day movies can never compare to the Great Alfred Hitchcock.
I:9527;908;This legandary film is Amazing.
I:9527;909;A great movie, state of the art effects, seeing birds lined up on the telephone lines, won't give you the same feeling after watching this classic Hitchcock film.
I:9527;910;bagoda Bay seemed so mysterious and the characters led you on a journey that began with a simple practcal joke, and ended up with an indictment on mankind itself.
I:9527;911;I went to see it the first night it opened.
I:9527;912;But other scenes such as the attack on the town after the gas station blows up are amazing, seeing as how all of the effects had to be done by hand.
I:9527;913;Anyway, I am sure all of us have special films in our life that have had an impact.
I:9527;914;It is truly a classic and I am glad of this.
I:9527;915;It is still one of Hitchcock's masterpieces after 42 years.
I:9527;916;cat and mouse between humans and birds!!!
I:9527;917;Getting the kids away is one of the all.
I:9527;918;I appreciated the quick delivery!
I:9527;919;Plays great and the case was in excellent order.
I:9527;920;Really lived up to it's promise and that's really rare.
I:9527;921;I'll open by saying that Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedron were perfect casting choices for this film.
I:9527;922;Hitchcock also hit a grand slam with the story, which tenons perfectly with the location, Bodega Bay (Northern California Coastal village).
I:9527;923;the story is this: Rod Taylor (a successful playboy.
I:9527;924;Anyway, Tippi is sorta hot for Rod as well and she's the adventuresome type .
I:9527;925;Rod races around the lake in his cool, (well, it's cool NOW anyway), car and retrieves her from the boat, steering her to a nearby tavern.
I:9527;926;tippi is noticed right off by the locals and sort of despised right away for all her city good looks, and, since she's made such a frivolous fuss.
I:9527;927;the camera angles, the cinematography in general, and the nostalgic details of Bodega Bay all contribute to make this masterpiece of horror films one of the best of all time.
I:9527;928;i give this one my very highest rating and recommend it to all.
I:9527;929;This is an interesting and spooky film that I first saw during lunchtimes in junior high school in 15 minute segments daily.
I:9527;930;It is fun top see it all at once and to remember what the female lead endured to make the film, after reading histories of Hitchcock's works.
I:9527;931;Still fun to watch even all these years later.
I:9527;932;if the birds at the park have ever buzzed you in dissatisfaction at your invading their park, you will surely enjoy this movie.
I:9527;933;"Hitchcock, in other words, was a ""clinical"" director of anxiety: the opposite of a film like ""The Birds"" is not Clouzot's ""Diabolique"" or Polanski's ""Chinatown,"" but rather ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" or the 1962 version of ""Carnival of Souls."
I:9527;934;So he introduced padding, particularly the love interest revolving around Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor .
I:9527;935;For example, on those rare occasions when Hitchcock does vouchsafe an individual focus (e. g., Jessica Tandy entering the house of a victimized farmer, or the attic scene previously mentioned), the effect is very powerful.
I:9527;936;"having said all that, I consider ""The Birds"" a superior film in the horror genre, and, typically for Hitchcock, there are many things to admire on a technical level."
I:9527;937;Psycho is another matter entirely, and for those looking for real intensity and undiluted focus, that is the film to watch.
I:9527;938;the movie when I received it.
I:9527;939;This has been a favorite childhood movie.
I:9527;940;"If you enjoy the older ""Chiller"" type movies this will be fun for you!"
I:9527;941;By far thee scariest flick of its type made at that time.
I:9527;942;Great movie, have watched it several times and would recommend it to anyone, One of Hitchcock's Best Thrillers 5 STARS
I:9527;943;Hitchcock excelled at the unexpected.
I:9527;944;A classic film adaptation of the short story.
I:9527;945;Kids love both, and it is fun to have them analyze both.
I:9527;946;happy that I found it!
I:9527;947;Experience positive start to receipt of product .
I:9527;948;I found it deeply frightening and disturbing.
I:9527;949;"but this second look revealed to me a deep psychological drama between a overprotective mother and her female rival (if you want to dig deeper into psychological details I recommend you to read Camille Paglias analysis of ""The Birds"")."
I:9527;950;All the characters and their relation to each other are revealed to us in a quick glance.
I:9527;951;sharp beaks instead of a knife, we also experience his mummified mother springing back to life.
I:9527;952;The Birds is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best movies.
I:9527;953;The scenes were the birds attack are well staged and scary, but the times in between the attacks are truly chilling.
I:9527;954;Mr. Hitchcock keeps things eerily quiet and the attacks happen so suddenly that you never see them coming.
I:9527;955;Mr. Hitchcock is of course the master of suspense and this is another example of how he keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:9527;956;The effects also show his deft hand as a director.
I:9527;957;This took a tremendous amount of skill and the end results are fabulous.
I:9527;958;First of all, The Birds is a brilliant example of the sci.
I:9527;959;it's a simple matter of questions.
I:9527;960;(And if Hitchcock ever succumbed to an openly fantastic detail, as in the final sequence of Family Plot , that introduction was clearly with the director's tongue firmly planted in his cheek. )
I:9527;961;With the confidence of a great master, the movie.
I:9527;962;"making in The Birds is quite simple (open and closed shots
I:9527;963;Elegantly, the movie opens with a comic scenario that involves us within the lives of plain romantic somebodies.
I:9527;964;"The relationships between the women in this movie are so well constructed and performed (the looks in their eyes
I:9527;965;The highlight of the movie is the uber cool Czarina of Sophistication Tippi Hedren.
I:9527;966;I love how the actors of yore spoke English, pronunciation was so perfect that it is very easy for Non.
I:9527;967;Hitchcock made some good films, such as North by Northwest.
I:9527;968;Hitchcock usually manages to find a way to explain everything in his movies.
I:9527;969;But I promise that I'm giving NOTHING away.
I:9527;970;Technically, this one is a massive collaborative effort planned out by the great field general, ah, director, Alfred Hitchcock.
I:9527;971;The meeting of Tipi and Rod Taylor in the pet shop is pure schlock.
I:9527;972;Still, they are attractive people and Tipi is wonderful in Edith Head's Jackie Kennedy green skirt suit.
I:9527;973;Finally, the birds take over and the last half of the film is pure suspense and pecking.
I:9527;974;Even though this film has no background music at all it is a definitive masterpiece from the Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.
I:9527;975;blonde beauty 'Tippi' Hedren makes her movie debut playing the sassy Melanie Daniels.
I:9527;976;in summary, this is an excellent movie.
I:9527;977;Even the special effects are good, considering this was made long before digital technology/CGI was possible.
I:9527;978;Being such a huge fan of his movies, I had to have this one .
I:9527;979;this is gary cullen and iam happy to say the birds landed okay.
I:9527;980;i like the older movies and will be after more over the coming months .
I:9527;981;Now I can watch it anytime I want.
I:9527;982;Fast shipment and excellent condition when it arrived.
I:9527;983;There are adversarial themes running throughout this film.
I:9527;984;There are battles between the sexes, man versus nature, and one with oneself.
I:9527;985;Seen are contentious dynamics between men and women, as well as between women.
I:9527;986;His statement about male/female relationships is that they are combative, provocative, competitive, and sometimes comedic.
I:9527;987;Traditionally, this is considered acceptable behavior.
I:9527;988;Annie is strong and independent, and Melanie is a high society woman, who has the freedom to do as she pleases.
I:9527;989;This illustrates a desire for men to also want to exercise outside the boundaries of what is considered acceptable.
I:9527;990;life is a game between chaos and perfect order.
I:9527;991;one of my favorite moments in the film which illustrates the struggle one has with oneself deals with Mitch's mother, Lydia, when she first meets Melanie.
I:9527;992;When Mitch introduces Melanie to her, as a friend, she gives Melanie a subtle long up.
I:9527;993;I found it slightly comedic in the way she does this.
I:9527;994;Played well, written well, mastered.
I:9527;995;One of Hitchcock's best in my opinion.
I:9527;996;Love Tippi and Taylor is gorgeous.
I:9527;997;It is an amusing premise, and the buildup to an interesting romance .
I:9527;998;In perfect Hitchcockian pacing, the attacks and the townsfolk's reaction to them start small, before building into full.
I:9527;999;obviously, some of the special effects are dated, but I was surprised to find that in many cases they hold up well.
I:9527;1000;They are certainly still good enough to sustain one's belief in attacking birds, and even when they're not so good, the story is strong enough to cover it up.
I:9527;1001;It's harrowing, no matter how many times I see it.
I:9527;1002;This is a time when a woman would smile indulgently when a man gives her the wolf.
I:9527;1003;whistle, when she always has her knees together even when she's navigating a dingy, who is perfectly groomed no matter what her situation, and doesn't feel the slightest shred of guilt in wearing a fur coat or smoking cigarettes.
I:9527;1004;"Some of these aspects of feminine life are obviously better left to the past, but this 21st century female can look back on this time with a sense of nostalgia
I:9527;1005;"behind only ""Psycho"" as Hitchcock's most famous film, ""The Birds"" is a must."
I:9527;1006;"Tense, creepy, unsettling, and incredibly entertaining, ""The Birds"" is one of those movies that you just have to see before you die ."
I:9527;1007;and the brilliant level of suspense it can wring out of something as simple as a phone call.
I:9527;1008;It can keep you watching with your eyes glued to the screen as the plot is masterfully, compellingly, and chillingly laid out only to take a sudden twist just as surprising, not to mention its technical mastery.
I:9527;1009;I reccommend it not only for its originality and technical mastery, but as brain food as well.
I:9527;1010;"everyone I know who ever watched it certainly thought twice afterwards about our fine feathered friends hovering above us and the possibility of their ""turning"" at any moment."
I:9527;1011;in town later that day in a restaurant there is some lively discussion,both pro and con,about what is happening.
I:9527;1012;"technically speaking this film while crisp and generally clear shows it still needs some work on it as there are many areas of excess dirt and it does get grainy
I:9527;1013;there are alot of special features however that are a welcome addition to this release.
I:9527;1014;finally,The Birds is definitely one of Hitchcock's more well known pieces and it certainly had a changing effect on many viewers after its' initial theatrical showing and subsequent airings on TV.
I:9527;1015;this along with the less than stellar release print brings this rating down a good full star.
I:9527;1016;"fi territory,has many memorable and unforgettable moments that make it worth recommending.You may not remember the plot,but you will remember ""The Birds""."
I:9527;1017;if you havent seen this movie, you better get on the ball, it's one of Hitchcock's best in storytelling, drama, and suspense.
I:9527;1018;The gore is witheld, but the innuendos, action, and visuals are there, as well as the fine sound effects of swarming birds on the rampage.
I:9527;1019;all in all, the birds are great actors, and the biting beaks leaves scars on viewers that dont exist.
I:9527;1020;its a great movie and being a SyFy movie, and being old, .
I:9527;1021;an avian world holocaust with the imminent extinction of the human race.
I:9527;1022;possibly this was done to produce a Hollywood more.
I:9527;1023;This is one of my favorite movies of all times.
I:9527;1024;OK, this is one bizarre movie, but it does have that distinctive master's touch all over it .
I:9527;1025;The mysterious but thin plot is aided enormously by the deft camera work and mesmerizing performances of even the worst of the lot (Tippi Hedren is comically self.
I:9527;1026;"The shots of the birds themselves and attending effects have not really dated
I:9527;1027;and Suzanne Pleshette is excellent as an emotionally devastated schoolteacher .
I:9527;1028;That the birds flying, flapping and screeching provides the film with its soundtrack only underscores Hitch's sure directorial hand .
I:9527;1029;It's a treat, no matter how you look at it.
I:9527;1030;My husband and I sat down to watch this movie again after not having seen it for years, and we really enjoyed it.
I:9527;1031;My entire family loves this movie.
I:9527;1032;The information on how Hitchcock made this movie was as excellent as the movie.
I:9527;1033;It has always been one of my favorite Hitchcock movies, despite it's dated special effects and sometimes hokey acting.
I:9527;1034;The suspense is still there regardless.
I:9527;1035;Hitchcock truly was a master at what he did.
I:9527;1036;Most of the bonus materials are great but a couple of them are kind of deceiving.
I:9527;1037;I saw it in a theater several years ago and enjoyed it.
I:9527;1038;I enjoyed seeing it again.
I:9527;1039;i went into this movie with big expectations because of its status as a classic, and as one of Hitchcock's best.
I:9527;1040;Hitchcock certainly picked an eye.
I:9527;1041;The movie is so good as I remembered it so long ago its very good.
I:9527;1042;I love the classic movies and knew I had to have this movie, It had been a long since I seen it but it still was super creepy.
I:9527;1043;The movie was delivered quick , and at a very good price.
I:9527;1044;A lot of analysis of relationships and potential relationships.
I:9527;1045;Alfred Hithcock is just a great story teller.
I:9527;1046;He is one of the GREATEST!Highly recommend for one's collection, this with Rear Window and Psycho is one of the best.
I:9527;1047;His camera work is great.
I:9527;1048;this is a great example of ' less is More'In my opinion
I:9527;1049;I recently viewed this movie for about the third time, and I was amazed at just how great some of the special effects were considering it was filmed in 1963.
I:9527;1050;Suzanne Pleshette as Annie and Ethel Griffies as the wise old hag near the end give the best performances.
I:9527;1051;"The film is an original to be sure certainly has redeeming qualities in the special effects department
I:9527;1052;Apart from the thrills this film is interesting.
I:9527;1053;The scene where they debate the birds' onslaught in the diner is one of my favorite movie scenes ever, probably because it makes their attack all the more impossible.
I:9527;1054;The Birds starts as a romantic comedy,and builds up to a great conclusion.
I:9527;1055;you are introduce to your characters, and certainly there is something wrong in the air and you can feel it.
I:9527;1056;Hitchcock is always driving the narrative, logically and its certainly manipulating the audience very effectively.
I:9527;1057;Tippi Hedren stars as blonde bombshell, Melanie Daniels, a wealthy, but fun.
I:9527;1058;the birds, driven by unknown malice soon begin attacking the town and its residents.
I:9527;1059;okay, the birds is quite simply fantastic.
I:9527;1060;The scenes actually shot in Bodega bay were really cool.
I:9527;1061;The birds made excellent and implacable enemies, and I liked the character of Melanie, who is a spunky and resourceful heroine, (I liked the fact that she cold handle an outboard without a man to help her!
I:9527;1062;overall, an excellent, Excellent film.
I:9527;1063;This movie is a great movie.
I:9527;1064;This is a great movie .
I:9527;1065;All in all it is very entertaining.
I:9527;1066;This film is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:9527;1067;It is filled with action and suspense.
I:9527;1068;I enjoyed the special effects and camera angles from the bird's point of view.
I:9527;1069;It was great fun watching the special features about how the movie was made.
I:9527;1070;He was the master of his time.
I:9527;1071;Great classic suspense thiller from Alfred Hitchcock, one of my favorite movie to watch on a cold and rainy day.
I:9527;1072;This this one of the top Hitchcock shows made, love the suspense but the ending could have been better, what a classic.
I:9527;1073;great old movie love old movies.
I:9527;1074;The potential for looming danger is ever present.
I:9527;1075;hitchcock deploys the bird theme to magnificent sci.
I:9527;1076;I am a Hitchcock fan and always will be.
I:9527;1077;I love his movies and they are always precise and well made.
I:9527;1078;This will always be one of my favorites.
I:9527;1079;But he is simply the best.
I:9527;1080;Oh felt so good watching this old classic movie, took me wayyy back.
I:9527;1081;I watched this again, having seen it the first time many years ago, and since then, seen many superior Hitch films.
I:9527;1082;Highly implausable choices by characters.
I:9527;1083;Next to Trouble With Harry and Psycho this is his best.
I:9527;1084;found this very interesting after viewing the HBO production of The Girl .
I:9527;1085;It made both films more meaningful to me.
I:9527;1086;I remember the original headlines this film produced
I:9527;1087;the sequence with the explosion is impressive as well as the sequence where the birds enter the house through the fireplace.
I:9527;1088;this and Psycho are my favorite Alfred Hitchcock films.
I:9527;1089;Tippi Hedren is gorgeous in this film and I was surprised to learn that this is her first film, she did a very good job.
I:9527;1090;This meaning has heretofore been kept a strict secret among British and American intellectuals.
I:9527;1091;For her first film, she did well.
I:9527;1092;watch it every Halloween, and well, when I want to laugh and cheer up.
I:9527;1093;The extra material that was included about the actors and the filming are definitely worth the time to watch them.
I:9527;1094;There's suspense, and an ever building romance.
I:9527;1095;The tension builds throughout this movie as the birds slowly begin to act abnormal.
I:9527;1096;probably because I was only a kid when I first saw this timeless classic.
I:9527;1097;this is by far Alfred Hitchcock's best movie!
I:9527;1098;but it is with a wizened eye that I now look at the scenes that had such impact: and they're still some of the scariest scenes put on film.
I:9527;1099;amok has been made into mincemeat in the decades since, but seldom with such a deft touch.
I:9527;1100;The plotline involving Daniels and her pursuit of attorney Mitch Brenner definitely has problems, but seems necessary to create the atmosphere and set the stage for the real stars of the movie .
I:9527;1101;Jessica Tandy is chill and formidable as Mitch's mother, Lydia, and Suzanne Pleshette, as schoolteacher Annie Hayworth, is one of the most interesting characters in the movie.
I:9527;1102;And her final scene is most memorable, as she is found facedown in front of her home, pecked to death.
I:9527;1103;the climactic attack that takes place at Mitch's home is sheer brilliance.
I:9527;1104;As the birds are pecking through the door and gathering in the attack, there is a sense of madness unleashed that is breathtaking.
I:9527;1105;but it is most successful in leaving behind a sense that the story is not quite over.
I:9527;1106;The film has acquired a certain campiness over the years that allows the sophisticated viewer to look past the obvious plot devices, and find an arch humor in the classic scenes.
I:9527;1107;So much so, that Tippi has become a popular Halloween costume .
I:9527;1108;The above line of dialogue is from this entertaining, suspenseful, scary, and romantic movie directed by the great Alfred Hitchcock.
I:9527;1109;(It was nominated for a special effects Academy Award.)
I:9527;1110;She decides to unexpectedly visit him at his home located in a small Pacific coastal village.
I:9527;1111;By not telling the viewer everything, Hitchcock effectively adds another dimension to his movie.
I:9527;1112;It has thirteen extras, many of which are brief but interesting.
I:9527;1113;"Be sure to see this classic movie directed by ""The Master of Suspense!!!"""
I:9527;1114;"(1963
I:9527;1115;Of all of Alfred Hitchcock's films, The Birds is remarkable on a number of levels.
I:9527;1116;Technically, for the time, it was a marvel.
I:9527;1117;Needing years of preparation with hundreds of trick shots, it still is pretty powerful stuff, even by today's computer generated standards.
I:9527;1118;When Melanie is attacked by a seagull right in front of Mitch, a series of unusual events begin to take place.
I:9527;1119;The camera work throughout this film is extraordinary.
I:9527;1120;The shot of Taylor driving his car along the Bodega Bay coast to meet Hedren at the dock is a wonderful piece of cinematography.
I:9527;1121;It's a great scene and it's classic Hitchcock suspense.
I:9527;1122;Good performances from all the lead players, with an amazing debut by Hedren.
I:9527;1123;All in all, The Birds is a fun film, one I never tire of watching.
I:9527;1124;ray prompted me to revisit some of the best films in the set.
I:9527;1125;I have always liked The Birds because I saw it as a child and it has stuck with me over the years.
I:9527;1126;It's interesting viewing such films again with a critical eye, rather than as a young boy who just needed to be entertained.
I:9527;1127;like Psycho, The Birds starts off with a light tone, as Hitchcock leads us to believe that the film will develop into a romantic comedy.
I:9527;1128;I admire this approach because it's realistic.
I:9527;1129;So you can expect to see the main characters introduced at the start of the film, and you'll see them flirt and develop a mutual attraction.
I:9527;1130;if Hitchcock had decided to make the entire film a romantic comedy, I'm sure he would have done a good job.
I:9527;1131;There's a depth present that doesn't exist in most examples from that genre.
I:9527;1132;The dialogue gives us important insights into the characters, as well as supplying some of the exposition for the basic plot.
I:9527;1133;She seems to have a wild, impulsive streak, and that fits her actions when she decides to visit Mitch.
I:9527;1134;She also lies often, although never in a malicious way.
I:9527;1135;melanie is also resourceful, and we see her charter a boat and use it to approach Mitch's house unobserved.
I:9527;1136;It's so unexpected that it can be quite frightening in places.
I:9527;1137;i have always enjoyed seeing what happens when events cause society to begin to break down.
I:9527;1138;The special effects earned an Oscar nomination at the time, so try to forgive the somewhat dated feel.
I:9527;1139;as usual, Hitchcock assembled a strong cast.
I:9527;1140;Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren are convincing as potential romantic partners, and both give good performances as their characters encounter stressful situations.
I:9527;1141;Mrs. Brenner (Jessica Tandy) is an important character too.
I:9527;1142;There's one particularly good scene in which Melanie talks to Mrs. Brenner and tries to allay her fears about the birds.
I:9527;1143;one of the best scenes occurs outside the town's school, where Annie (Suzanne Pleshette) is teaching a class.
I:9527;1144;She makes the children sing, while Melanie waits outside to collect Cathy.
I:9527;1145;This leads to one of the most dramatic sequences in the film as the children leave the school.
I:9527;1146;the Birds is elevated above the level of most horror films for several reasons: The characters are real people with genuine fears, the dialogue means something, the acting is strong, and the audience is given time to absorb the danger of a situation rather than being bombarded with gory or shocking scenes.
I:9527;1147;It reminds me of The Mist in that way, and I think the scenes contain more tension because we make up our own minds about how to feel, rather than having the music inform us that there is danger or a scary moment approaching.
I:9527;1148;most of the whimsical scenes happen early in The Birds.
I:9527;1149;By the end of the film, you'll feel as if you have been through a grueling emotional journey.
I:9527;1150;The sound of fluttering wings is particularly effective.
I:9527;1151;I may be reading too much into this movie, but it seems to me that there is a really great subtext throughout, which continuously informs the suspense and horror of the film in general.
I:9527;1152;Even if I'm totally out to lunch, it's a fun concept to keep in mind while watching.
I:9527;1153;The mother is jealous of both the school teacher and of Tippi.
I:9527;1154;To me, that is the hallmark of a truly brilliant movie (and we KNOW that Hitchcock loved to insert double.
I:9527;1155;meanings everywhere he could, in all of his pictures).
I:9527;1156;The best film from the master of thriller films.
I:9527;1157;It is more exciting, more violent, and more scarier than any Alfred Hitchcock film around.
I:9527;1158;But when I saw it, I thought it was a very interesting What If?
I:9527;1159;Every fan of this director's work will love this film.
I:9527;1160;One of Alfred Hitchcock's most graphic, chilling, and under.
I:9527;1161;"the theme of the changing role of women extends beyond the central avian conflict
I:9527;1162;the bird sequences, however, are truly terrifying and unforgettable.
I:9527;1163;"when compared to Hitchcock's more accepted masterpieces like Vertigo and Rear Window, The Birds is less impressive
I:9527;1164;The birds themselves are also wonders of special effects that easily rival the best CGI effects of the present day.
I:9527;1165;This open endedness is an intriguing narrative decision by Hitchcock but gives the film a feeling of incompleteness.
I:9527;1166;Albert Whitlock's special effects are brilliant.
I:9527;1167;The combination of real birds and optical effects produce the exact amount of terror intended.
I:9527;1168;The Birds is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie for a number of reasons.
I:9527;1169;Of all the Hitchcock films, this one has the most humor and the most suspense and scares.
I:9527;1170;The acting is very good throughout and I really cared about what happened to the characters.
I:9527;1171;The anamorphic widescreen picture looks good, and the sound is nice.
I:9527;1172;"In my english class we read the short story that ""The Birds"" which the movie was based on, and I thought it was pretty interesting."
I:9527;1173;This has been one of my ALL time favorite movies and I watch it over and over again.
I:9527;1174;This is another scarey movie, but with a Hitchcock twist which he does so well.
I:9527;1175;A must see for those who love Hitchcock.
I:9527;1176;Any film by Hitchcock has wonderful moments, and some from this movie are unforgettable, like the huge flock of crows slowly gathering in the playground behind Tippi Hedren, as she unsuspectingly smokes a cigarette.
I:9527;1177;be killers, right in front of their eyes, down a seemingly endless staircase.
I:9527;1178;Because she brought two caged love.
I:9527;1179;But she doesn't mistreat them, and they seem perfectly happy.
I:9527;1180;I loved the way Hitchcock used the shots of those exquisite love.
I:9527;1181;birds as beauty relief, so to speak, after the shots of the attacks by gulls and crows.
I:9527;1182;minded, but I think Hitchcock's best films are the ones in which even the most macabre events make sense.
I:9527;1183;That's when the fun starts.
I:9527;1184;She is attacked by a sea gull and meets Mitchs's family.
I:9527;1185;the overprotective somewhat needy mother and cute sister.
I:9527;1186;The attacks are very realistic.
I:9527;1187;what I like is the dynamic between the characters.
I:9527;1188;Overall, an excellent movie and one I would watch more then once.
I:9527;1189;she had to watch the movie and right down certain parts of the movie.
I:9527;1190;This should hint us that what has just transpired is an important scene.
I:9527;1191;Listen carefully to Annie's mysterious speech to Melanie in their night together.
I:9527;1192;So why is Lydia so keen on giving love to her son?
I:9527;1193;"This is revealed later when she asks ""She's very rich, isn't she?"""
I:9527;1194;"Her line ""I want so much to understand"" is heartfelt and passionate, not calculating."
I:9527;1195;It is made clear that she is a widow of a wealthy man, and small hints in many scenes build up to the conclusion that Lydia has some special reaction to Melanie associated with guilt over her children, and an inexplicable wariness over Mitch and Melanie's relationship.
I:9527;1196;Watching the scenes and listening to the dialogue carefully informs one that Lydia's behavior is indeed explained by her knowledge that Melanie is her daughter.
I:9527;1197;i give this movie two stars for its ingenuity.
I:9527;1198;I am a big fan of Hitchcock's movies and The Birds is one of my favorites.
I:9527;1199;It is the perfect drama/thriller combination.
I:9527;1200;This movie is definitely one of Hitchcock's best!
I:9527;1201;I enjoyed it this time.
I:9527;1202;Hitchcock is good the effects turned it from suspense to comedy.
I:9527;1203;I viewed this fine movie for the first time in a long, long, while, just at the time of the 8.9 earthquake in Japan, March 2011, occurred.
I:9527;1204;The theme in The Birds is the awesome power of nature and how utterly defenseless and futile humankinds' effort to control it once something out of the ordinary occurs.
I:9527;1205;a colorized version of a timeless classic Hitchcock movie!!!
I:9527;1206;I love this movie every time I see it!
I:9527;1207;hitchcock's unforeseen success of Psycho put him in a tough spot.
I:9527;1208;While it portrays the story of avian, murderous birds terrorizing California with a horrific sense of dread and atmosphere, this film is a showcase for a cast of exceptional actors and actresses who do not even have a chance to show their stuff.
I:9527;1209;The premise seems laughable, but Hitchcock uses his uncanny tools to create a film that possesses great cinematic urgency, using the birds as a sharp shock of terror.
I:9527;1210;but Tippie Hedren and Suzanne Pleshette look fantastic.
I:9527;1211;and darn it, this is a good film!
I:9527;1212;Yes, it looks fake sometimes and the subplot of the love triangle is a bit annoying but there will always be a special place in my heart for The Birds .
I:9527;1213;i bought this as a Christmas present for someone who loves the classics .
I:9527;1214;He loved that this movie came out on blue ray and he is always looking for others.
I:9527;1215;Always love this movie, showed it to some younger guys who never saw it, and they couldn't believe how much they like it.
I:9527;1216;reallySometimes the older things can still be new.
I:9527;1217;movie was new and I enjoyed it.
I:9527;1218;It's a an Alfred Hitchcock classic.
I:9527;1219;Actually, if you are visiting San Francisco, it is well worth the trip up the coast to see it.
I:9527;1220;And it is a magnificent drive.
I:9527;1221;This is a classic that still manages to provide a good deal of shocks.
I:9527;1222;(I still dread the scene where the farmer is found) 'Tippi' Hedren is great as Melanie.
I:9527;1223;Rod Taylor is sufficiently hunky and Jessica Tandy is great as the quietly boiling mother.
I:9527;1224;The Birds is a very good suspense thriller, in that it builds tension throughout.
I:9527;1225;I was impressed at how realistic the depictions of the ferocious birds were, being that this movie debuted in 1963.
I:9527;1226;The plot is very simple, and is sort of a precursor to another classic in the horror genre, Night of the Living Dead.
I:9527;1227;Overall, The Birds is a good movie in the Hitchcock catalog.
I:9527;1228;watching it now is more entertaining than frightening.
I:9527;1229;This is truly an Alfred Hitchock classic.
I:9527;1230;Of course, this is a classic movie and wonderful to own so that we can watch it when we find it convenient.
I:9527;1231;I would recommend it to anyone who likes Alfred Hitchcock movies.
I:9527;1232;Hitchcock has made many great movies, and this certainly stands up as one of them.
I:9527;1233;Here, Hitchcock gives a lesson in film directing and creates a truly masterpiece of work in the process.
I:9527;1234;This classic is an all.
I:9527;1235;It is, however, still a great, classic film.
I:9527;1236;The Birds is one of the best Alfred Hitchcock's movies.
I:9527;1237;This is the secret key of the movie: normality can be easily reversed by an inexplicable incident.
I:9527;1238;This movie is very important in cinema history, it influenced a lot of directors include George Romero and Steven Spielberg.
I:9527;1239;You have to watch this movie with your imagination, this is a true fantastic movie because there is no explanation of the attitude of the birds, these ordinary birds become the element rooting the horror in everyday.
I:9527;1240;If you want to see dinosaurs, you could watch the extraordinary TV documentary on the life of dinosaurs made by the BBC and others European channels like France 3, the special effects were by far superior of those of Jurassic park.
I:9527;1241;He also told us that making some special effects of Star Wars was even easier than those of the Birds because they do not have to animate flying birds.
I:9527;1242;For myself I prefer think that my opinion about these fantastic special effects is the same opinion of a master of special effects.
I:9527;1243;The only memorable moment was What are you, who are you, where are you from?
I:9527;1244;This is a movie and replicates the book perfectly.
I:9527;1245;Love Alfred Hitchcock films and The Birds being one of his classics.
I:9527;1246;Big Fan of AH movies and this one is my all time favorite.
I:9527;1247;Tippi Hedren is superb in this!
I:9527;1248;This is an oldie and well worth having.
I:9527;1249;Forgot how good it was and scary for the time it was made.
I:9527;1250;"Note: Your ""helpful"" votes are appreciated."
I:9527;1251;Longer reviews are best read after you see the movie, in my opinion.
I:9527;1252;What I liked the most was the recapturing of rural California of the 1950.
I:9527;1253;The roads, the small town, the cars, they really take you back.
I:9527;1254;considering the time, the special effects are really great, too.
I:9527;1255;"my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie (a great mystery) is ""Vertigo."""
I:9527;1256;Vertigo has so much to think about, and the romance is perfect.
I:9527;1257;You'll find many Hitchcock movies that you'll love.
I:9527;1258;I loved The Birds as a kid.
I:9527;1259;The film is pretty frightening stuff and is one of the few films of Hitch's that crosses the line from thriller to horror (along with the much maligned but terrific little film Frenzy made with Anthony Schaffer of Sleuth fame.
I:9527;1260;Rod Taylor gives a nice, complex performance that enhances the film.
I:9527;1261;All the performances with the exception of Hendren's are stellar.
I:9527;1262;nevertheless the film benefits from a number of powerful set pieces including the sequence where Hendren is trapped in a telephone booth.
I:9527;1263;The first major assault by the birds is effective and frightening.
I:9527;1264;Although Hitch would have a few missteps after this film (Marnie, Torn Curtain and the uncertain Topaz)he managed to close out his career with two minor classics with Frenzy and the comical Family Plot.
I:9527;1265;So it was interesting to watch as an adult.
I:9527;1266;That's intriguing as well as the birds assaults.
I:9527;1267;Still, this movie can capture my attention.
I:9527;1268;"With Halloween at the tail end, October is definitely the ""month of horror"" should there ever be one, and ""The Birds"" is a definite horror masterpiece."
I:9527;1269;The Birds is full of suspense and a thickening plot, and is able to be a scary movie without relying heavily on the graphic side of horror, although I will admit there are a few scenes that were probably quite graphic for the mid '60s audience.
I:9527;1270;And that's one of the things that makes this such a great horror movie.
I:9527;1271;"Even today, such a concept is rather rare, so for it's time, it was most certainly a visionary concept, I would assume!Although I'm probably a lot younger than most people familiar with this film, I still think ""The Birds"" is a suspenseful and brilliantly."
I:9527;1272;Highly recommended for all horror fans, especially in time for Halloween!
I:9527;1273;Thanks for the time, and peace.
I:9527;1274;BirdsIn my opinion, one of the best Hitchcock movies.
I:9527;1275;Still scary ater 40 years.
I:9527;1276;The box is nice but you can't play the box
I:9527;1277;The Birds is Hitchcock's masterpiece.
I:9527;1278;It is my official selection for the best Hitchcock movie EVER.
I:9527;1279;it is so much more than just a horror movie .
I:9527;1280;This film is loaded with haunting images and symbolism which deserves multiple viewings and discussion among serious film buffs.
I:9527;1281;"The film itself is a beautiful widescreen presentation with very nice sound
I:9527;1282;The Birds might well be the first official nature.
I:9527;1283;Besides, the beautiful Bodega Bay photography provides some nice backdrop eye.
I:9527;1284;candy to help maintain one's attention with the soap operatics.
I:9527;1285;driven drama of the first hour is actually appealing in light of the modern glut of moronic cgi.
I:9527;1286;It's entertaining to see the clothing and decor styles, as well as social interactions, etc.
I:9527;1287;Although I don't find Tippi sexy, I do enjoy her facial expressions.
I:9527;1288;There are numerous memorable and thrilling sequences .
I:9527;1289;I also enjoyed the interesting discussion on birds in the diner sequence.
I:9527;1290;Bit they did a great time for the time is was made.
I:9527;1291;as usual, this film is such a classic because of Hitchcock's ability to create tension.
I:9527;1292;By the title alone, the viewer knows that birds will play a large role in this film, so in the early.
I:9527;1293;goings Hitch uses certain scenes/images to foreshadow what is to come.
I:9527;1294;Hedren and Taylor are solid, while supporters such as Jessica Tandy and a young Veronica Cartwright turn in fine performances as well.
I:9527;1295;overall, though, this is a solid film that deserves a place among Hitchcock's best.
I:9527;1296;"Classic Hitchcock tale, a most original concept
I:9527;1297;Amazingly enough, it was the animators of Walt Disney that made the fireplace sequence possible
I:9527;1298;Hitchcock liked to film in California.
I:9527;1299;Shadow of a Doubt, his favorite movie, was filmed in Santa Rosa, which is north of San Francisco on highway 101.
I:9527;1300;Looks great in H. d.!
I:9527;1301;Also the sound track and bird effects were great.
I:9527;1302;It is about a woman who brings some lovebirds into a small town to give to a man's daughter.
