1;The movie is excellent and it came on time in good condition.
2;The movie arrived when the seller promised, and in good condition.
3;Part A is on one side (the first half of the film) and Part B is on the other side.
4;It has it all, comedy, drama and some action.
5;This movie was well written and directed.
6;This move comes with a story book about the Color Purple.
7;I watched this film last night, and its power, depth, and beauty continue to reverberate in my mind, heart, and soul.
8;american cast and characters, this story is (and I was glad to hear one of the actors convey this during an interview, found in the Special Features) a story about people (and not solely African.
9;and is, at its heart (and as conveyed by another of the actors, in one of the Special Features), a story about people having the ability to transform, and to grow, and to become someone they didn't know that they could.
10;but can be (and often is) aided along by the help, love, and inspiration of others .
11;but after it occurs, people are 'never the same', and the positive outcome can and often does beget yet more positive change and outcome for those whose paths one crosses, and whose lives one touches.
12;this story also involves a portrayal of the deep and abiding love, and indescribable closeness that is felt by many sisters, and for that matter, can be found among siblings whose childhoods involve unspeakable and/or shared pain and/or the reality of a difficult circumstance (an understatement) that results in some siblings finding themselves in the role of a 'protector', or otherwise having profound (and warranted) concern for the safety and wellbeing of a sibling.
13;americans, and is part of what makes this story important for all to see, and regardless of whatever color one's skin might happen to be.
14;the story, the script, the acting, the direction, the cinematography, the scoring, composition, and performance of music, the sets .
15;and you also feel deeply moved by moments of sweetness, tenderness, kindness, and love.
16;and you ultimately feel indescribable joy and happiness, and can be overcome with emotion at the end .
17;in viewing the Special Features, from the 2nd disc of the 2.
18;Steven Spielberg also mentioned that the scene I just alluded to, in which Danny Glover's character engages in actions to separate the sisters, and involves emotional and physical aspects that render the scene one of great intensity (and the acting, on the part of the actresses who portrayed the sisters, and the nearly visceral pain of their being separated, is astonishing) .
19;but the realism of what gets portrayed is important, and provides an aspect of the 'impact' that a given film can (and in this case, absolutely does) have.
20;And the fact that Steven Spielberg wasn't even nominated, for Best Director, will remain one of life's mysteries, as far as I'm concerned.
21;and its brilliance and power go beyond words.
22;This movie is a masterpiece.
23;You will weep, wail, laugh.
24;This is one of the top 10 movies ever released in the twentieth century.
25;the ending is the best ending of any movie I've ever seen.
26;It reaches the core of the human soul: Freedom, happiness, Love and Harmony.
27;celie and Nettie Best Friends for life.
28;They will always have a place in my heart I hope yours as well!Eugene Ramirez
29;This movie is really enjoyable.
30;The storyline is fairly weak, average at best, but the all star cast holds your interest, and you can feel yourself going through many of the emotions of the characters.
31;I forgot that I ordered it .
32;The colors are beautiful and the sound is great.
33;Thanks Amazon for selling me one of my favorite movies at a great price ($7.50)
34;up between Malcolm X and The Color Purple, depending on my mood.
35;I suppose TCP is the best movie tending to be on the girly side while MX is the best on the masculine.
36;hUGE thanks to all of the actors, directors and producers for making movies that celebrate people of color without the need of the GW Hollywood hero.
37;The movie reminded me of a simplier time and what is really important.
38;It showed how diverse a family can be.
39;I love this movie, Had to own it, so I can watch any time I want.
40;My movie was delivered in a timely fashion and packaged as promised.
41;Boght for my mom was a flick we love to watch when i was a kid Great music cast and setting
42;i was very surprised to find out that I had to flip the disc over to finish this great movie.
43;I look forward to watching it from start to finish and NO commericals.
44;i read somewhere that alice walker didn't like it much, but was happy to see her work on screen.
45;the fact that many people can drop a line from it on cue, should be an indicator.
46;the movie will evoke almost every emotion that you can draw on.
47;no need to be like me, and see it so many times that you can recite it.
48;and enjoy an american masterpiece.
49;The Color Purple / B000P0J092If you read and enjoyed Walker's The Color Purple, then you will most likely love this movie .
50;this is possibly one of the most faithful book films I have ever seen.
51;only elements go, I should note how wonderful the acting in this movie is.
52;The relationship between Celie and Shug is beautifully portrayed, and is extremely nuanced as each woman aids the other in their spiritual and emotional growth.
53;Glover, too, acts wonderfully here, and it is fascinating to see his character evolve as well (a feature of the novel that could have easily been swept aside in the Hollywood desire for a completely irredeemable villain) from a cruel, emotionally dead man to one who regrets the things he has done and the opportunities he has lost.
54;i would greatly recommend this movie to anyone, but I would also recommend that you read the novel first if you haven't already.
55;Because the novel covers such a long period of time (most of Celie's life, really), it was necessary for the movie to cut many events, and while it did so in the best possible way, there's still a lot of material worth reading in the novel that will help to understand the movie and why the characters feel and act the way they do.
56;The Color Purple is my favorite film of all time.
57;Wonderful story and brilliantly acted.
58;Color Purple was not only my favorite novel of all time, it must be one of the best films of its decade.
59;It is still fresh, every time I see it.
60;There should be perpetual appause to everyone and anyone who played a part in making this exceptional film.
61;It's hard to take, sometimes overly dramatic (this may be uplifting and inspiring in the end, but getting there is a rough journey) but Steven Spielberg almost takes a Ron Howard approach to his filmmaking and creates a film that is dramatic yet heartwarming, with enough elements of purity that make the heavy.
62;The film spans over forty years as Celie grows up reclusive and bitter only to have her spirits and her eyes opened when the boisterous and soulful Shug Avery comes into her life.
63;Shug, one time lover to Albert, has some troubles of her own, but her way of dealing with them far outshine the way Celie has dealt with hers, and she helps Celie to come into her own and take back the life she should have had to begin with.
64;this film is aiding by some of the most moving and effective performances I've seen committed to film.
65;Margaret Avery and Oprah Winfrey (both of whom were Oscar nominated) give amazing performances.
66;Oprah is at one moment in.you.
67;Margaret Avery is beyond fantastic as Shug.
68;The way she effortlessly wraps herself around Celie and dominates her thinking and actions is heart.
69;Yes, Whoopi delivers what may be one of the greatest female performances of all time.
70;She never breaks her characters emotional state, delivering to us a woman who has been conditioned by her surroundings.
71;"She walks hunched and fearful
72;She is afraid to smile.
73;She is afraid to be herself, but when her fire is ignited and her inner person is unleashed she is finally freed from her cage and given the chance to break away from those holding her down.
74;Her final confrontation scene at the dinner table is one of the most earth shattering scenes in my movie watching history.
75;in the end I highly recommend this movie to any and everyone.
76;This is a truly emotional film that connects with the audience on a deep and personal level.
77;This is a film about oppression, and each and every one of us has been oppressed at one point in our lives.
78;We have not all been oppressed to this extent, but we can all gain strength from Celie's story and can all appreciate her struggle and eventual triumph.
79;Yea, Steven Spielberg can also create dramas, yes and Whoopie Goldberg can also act in dramas in an extremely moving and impressing way.
80;it's so incredible how this movie can interpret pain and pressure in such a realistic and touching way.
81;The story is dramatic and full of emotions.
82;It is inspirational and life contemplating
83;Incredible photography, stunning performances, a story that will not leave you untouched.
84;One of the great movies with great performances by every actor.
85;Oprah was outstanding in her character.
86;It was a great movie and soon to be a classic.
87;The Color Purple has so many messages, moral and otherwise, that they blur together into what can only be described as wisdom.
88;Despite that, I get a strong sense of realism from this film, in the same way we are forced to believe someone when they admit a degrading fact about themselves.
89;the heart of this movie is a woman named Celie.
90;Woopie Goldberg was cast in the role and it represents her first cinematic outing.
91;She was nominated for an Academy Award and, in my opinion, should have won it.
92;Celie doesn't get to talk much, is subservient to many of the larger powers in her life and yet still manages to communicate depths of emotion few of us ever see in our own lives.
93;Albert's mistress, Shug Avery, is a degraded yet stylish club singer who eventually loves Celie more than Albert.
94;Albert has a son from a previous marriage, Harpo.
95;She becomes aware of her own inner beauty and her own power.
96;This transformation is so gradual that we almost believe nothing is changing but by the end of the film, Celie is a woman in control of her own destiny and a force for good in her community.
97;But, if you ever start feeling a little sorry for yourself, I recommend this movie.
98;Not only will it put your troubles into proper perspective but it will also lift up your heart as few films can.
99;i love this movie and it came on time.
100;Best movie Oprah and Whoopie ever.
101;Alice Walker's novel (a masterpiece) is faithfully translated by director Spielberg and a perfect cast.
102;Whoopi Goldberg delivers a soulful, devastating performance developing Celie from downtrodden girl to proud, strong woman.
103;Danny Glover's Mister is a fully realized portrait of an abusive alcoholic who turns out to be not as evil as we suspected.
104;Oprah Winfrey, Margarey Avery, Dana Ivey and Adolph Caeser complete the superlative ensemble, and Spielberg wisely focuses on storyline and character, giving us just enough visual beauty to make this a modern classic on all levels.
105;Ms. Walker's message is universal: all things want love, even, as Shug Avery tells Celie, the color purple.
106;Ultimately it is a celebration of life and the human spirit, something with which each of us can connect.
107;WONDERFUL, very sad and yet joyous, fabulous acting by everyone, it certainly is a real eye opener as to what went on in that era
108;Stellar in every aspect this film is, including Stephen Spielberg's highly credible direction, the acting, especially of the four most prominent stars: Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey (both quite impressive in their debuts), Danny Glover, and Margaret Avery.
109;Spielberg should be congratulated for this masterpiece!
110;I had been looking for This movie at a reasonable price and I found it.
111;This was one of the few movies that are destine to become a classic.
112;It is so true to life that I had to have it in our film Libery.
113;The movie was a gift and my friend was delighted.
114;Really believable work of art on all their parts.
115;The movie came in a timely manner!This is one of my favorite films and I plan to add my indepth review of the blue ray and attached book very soon.
116;After I saw the films that won the Oscars, I felt the outrage.
117;Alice Walker's works all revolve around similar themes, so anyone familiar with her writings knows what to expect.
118;It is the bond betwee those two sisters, the separation that takes place between them, and their ultimate reunion, that is the heart of the story, with a lot that happens along the way that can move mountains.
119;the performances of Margaret Avery and Oprah Winfrey are unforgettable and earned them Oscar nominations.
120;Danny Glover as her brutal husband Albert appears as most of the men in the movie appear, but he is afforded the chance to show a true character that develops and grows as the story progresses so that at the end, he is able to show his repentance in the only way he knows how.
121;Throughout the film, the sumptuous score of Quincy Jones gives a special touch that after twenty years has not lost its charm.
122;As many times as I have seen it since, the more I have come to admire the film and realize just how monumental it really was.
123;Since that first viewing, I have found it much more relaxing to watch the film without such distractions, but even so, the film truly is a masterpiece, and it deserves all the credit that it did not receive in 1985.
124;This set is just great and we highly recommend it.
125;It was a mother's day gift for my mother and i thought of it at the last minute.
126;The package came in excellent condition.
127;This film is absolutely outstanding.
128;It's powerful, highly emotional and leaves you exhausted, but with an amazing feeling of triumph over adversity.
129;I love it's gritty portrayal of a life less than glamourous and is not afraid to show the true horror of what a grim place the world can be.
130;Even the hardest of men will love this film.
131;She's another actress that is top notch in everything she stars in.
132;She gives a stellar performance in this movie!!!
133;An ambitious drama based on Alice Walker's acclaimed novel.
134;When she finds herself the wife (slave would be a better term)of the man she calls Mister, she is determined to be herself and return someday to something better.
135;contrary to what we would consider normal marital relations, Celie is actually happy and thankful for the mistress in her husband's life.
136;A strong friendship is formed between the 2 women, climaxing in a kissing scene which I never expected.
137;But, Shug definitely has talent as well as insight and she knows the real reasons why Celia pampers her and shows no disdain.
138;since I am a literacy teacher, the scenes of Celie's learning to read were superb!
139;i loved the music and singing and the graphic demonstration of their idea of a swinging nightclub where Shug sang and cavorted.
140;when Celia finally had a chance to leave, I cheered her on, watching and expecting her to cement her intentions.
141;the title and the color purple were not clear to me until the very end, but I felt Steven Spielberg did a remarkable job and for the life of me, I cannot understand why, with 11 Academy Award nominations it did not win at least 3 or 4!
142;if this was Whoopi's first movie, she started off excellent, and is still excellent!
143;No matter what age you are when you watch it, you will have a favorite part that you will remember always.
144;I love this movie it's my second all time favorite 2 to Love Jones.
145;This disc is going to be great!!
146;relase this true gem of a movie and now they finally are, I CANNOT wait to get this!
147;When I brought the vhs edition of this flim, I was so proud I had it in my movie collection.
148;The colors are so expressive, that it makes you cry.
149;In fact, this movie will have you in tears for 1 whole hour almost.
150;With 2 discs with full.
151;length commentary, a photo gallery which features some unseen and rare photographs, and a making.
152;He's a good actor in my ratings tho.
153;But what else would you expect, Hollywood knows what people want, and they love it.
154;love whoopi in this movie for me a great start to what and who she is and will continue to bee a good artist and smart
155;It was received on time in perfect condition.
156;A classic movie my aunt will really enjoy it and cry like I do every time I watch it on tv
157;The video got here really fast.
158;I loved this it was such a great movie and in perfect shape thank you for all the great work you do!
159;This has always been one of my favorite movies, the price was great and now I have it available whenever I get in the mood to watch it."
160;This is my all time favorite movie.
161;I watch this movie at least once a month and many scenes I can give you a line by line dialogue.
162;The Color Purple is a wonderous movie directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the novel of the same name.
163;It's heartbreaking but uplifting, sad but joyous.
164;The story at its core is a great one of the darkness, love, frailty, and goodness of the human spirit.
165;woopie Goldberg gives a much superior performance in my opinion than to her Oscar winning one in Ghost.
166;Some have complained this movie makes the women all look great while the men look like scum.
167;The women characters are all generally good people, but are not flawless, and the male characters, outside Danny Glover's intensly dislikable one and the dad character early in the movie, are generally likable as well.
168;It's a story that's about women uplifting themselves off dire situations, and even if it does tug on too many emotional strings to get there, the path at which it arrives still feels great.
169;In aditions to what I mentioned above, one may claim it's like a fairy tale.
170;To me it comes down to great characters in a great story that's inspirational and can make one look to the brightness in the world.
171;That's when I knew that this is a great movie.
172;Highly recommended for those who love this underestimated GEM and real CLASSIC in all American cinema and for those who appreciate one of the Spielberg's very best film ever!!!
173;The scene with the characters singing their way to the church near the end borders on self.
174;All the actors are good.
175;Oprah gives an impressive performance, as does Whoopi Goldberg.
176;Danny Glover is great, too, as the slimy Mister.
177;"This is one of those ""triumph of the human spirit movies."""
178;One of the best movies ever .
179;I highly recommend this movie!!!
180;I consider it a classic, necessity to the black movie experience.
181;I will always love the color purple for its music, scenery, characters, laughs, tears, and lessons.
182;The color purple is a great tale for today's audience.
183;A story told in a way that makes you laugh, cry and get excited for Miss Celie.
184;I have long enjoyed the movie the Color Purple.
185;The most amazing original score and soundtrack by John Williams.
186;Such a powerful story of one woman's struggle (Ms. Celie) in life.
187;I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys good cinema.
188;One of my favorite movies of all time, without a doubt.
189;"Steven Spielberg wonderfully directed and produced ""The Color Purple"", which was released in 1985."
190;This became one of the best movies released that year.
191;The only complaint is that this received 11 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, and it didn't win any.
192;Its plot, based on Alice Walker's novel, is brilliant.
193;It digs deep into the events and the characters throughout, while never holding back a drop of emotion.
194;Such substance keeps the audience guessing every future event and double checking every detail.
195;Its layers of storylines keep the chain of events interesting.
196;It proves that there's more to Celie's life than just her own trials.
197;whoopi Goldberg made a triumphant movie debut in her role as Celie Johnson, a woman being abused by her husband and yearns for a better life.
198;She rightfully earned a Golden Globe win and an Oscar nomination both for Best Actress.
199;Oprah Winfrey and Margaret Avery rightfully earned their Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress as Sophie and Shug, strong female fighters who survived past life trials.
200;Danny Glover's role as Celia's abusive husband is one of the best performances in his career.
201;The entire cast, major or minor, placed every drop of heart and soul through their characters.
202;The research and the hard work shines.
203;"Most scenes offer its emotional level through the background alone, whether it's sadness, anger, happiness, etc.""The Color Purple"" is great for those looking for a power drama."
204;this is simply my favorite.
205;I rarely rate anything 5 stars, not to mention label something a favorite!
206;The movie mainly gives you glimpses of the life of a black womyn who is tortured most of her life with more than her share worth of the pain that reality can bring but who overcomes all to feel the power of being a full, beautiful spirit in a humyn world regardless of circumstances, racism, poverty, etc.
207;I hope others who have become hopeless will watch this movie and be inspired, because the power of spirit you can achieve in this world is more beautiful and fulfilling than can be described .
208;I really enjoyed this movie.
209;It's a good movie to watch during Thanksgiving, Chritsmas, and Easter.
210;Because it kinda gives you a sense for the holidays.
211;I recommend this movie for audiences twelve and up.
212;I enjoyed watching the movie.
213;I saw this, when it came out, I bought it later, and still watch it.
214;Oprah has it in NYC, her OWN.
215;presentation, of it in musical form.
216;To hear Oprah say, this movie was her dream, became her dream, (and I know why as so many do) is such a huge huge championship of one, over adversity, and a true testimonial of complete courage!
217;I love this film, along with any film of courage, and determination and true grit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
218;I'd have loved to sit and look at how people tried to survive during those dark years.
219;It's really a great movie and very educational.
220;It is sure to be a classic.
221;I hav watched it many times and will again.
222;This is one of the few movies ever made that represents African Americans well without crucifying white people.
223;Steven Spielberg is a moviemaking prodigy.
224;And yes I believe Whoopi Goldberg should've won the Oscar Award for this role!
225;Love, love, love this movie.
226;it's a wonderful movie you care about the characters wonder about their lives.
227;", and really should have won Best Picture over ""Out of Africa."""
228;Whoopi Goldberg never got another role like this one, showing her incredible and untapped acting talent by way of Steven Spielberg's inspired and altogether ambitious direction.
229;Oprah Winfrey was given an Oscar nomination, as was Margaret Avery, but there are so many stunning performances here from the entire cast that pointing out any standout performances is nearly impossible.
230;There is also some clever film editing(certainly the most under.
231;rated facet of filmmaking), that keeps the film constantly fresh and the story moving forward with some fantastic cinematography.
232;"It is really a small discrepancy given that both actresses that play ""Celie"" are excellent(in particular, Whoopi Goldberg)."
233;"For those who know only Whoopi's fairly lame films like ""Burglar,"" I guarantee you will be pleasantly surprised by her amazing work here."
234;There are many moments in the film that are so genuinely touching and heartfelt that by the end of the final scene I suddenly realized that it never felt so good to cry.
235;"This is easily one of my favorite ""Spielberg"" films."
236;Everything about this movie is gorgeous!
237;This is probably one of the few movies that I know by heart.
238;I love it's courage and defiance.
239;"Just watching this film you immediately empathize to the hand that ""Miss Celie"" has been dealt."
240;And what I found interesting was all of the women had very intriguing lives.
241;Great movie with a fantastic cast and plenty of history on the Old South's mentality.
242;The movie is great and makes you mad, angry, happy, and I always cry at the end.
243;So many elements in this movie with ups and downs but of good does prevail.
244;Whoopi and Oprah, Danny, and Caesar are all wonderful in this movie.
245;The life and trials of a young African American woman.
246;There is a big twist in this movie, it's about her father, or is he.
247;She is far from the woman she is today.
248;This is a 1985 movie.
249;The Color Purple was the greatest movie I have ever seen.
250;I recommend it to anybody.
251;This is truly a blow to such a beautiful, heartbreaking, shiningly beautiful film that depicts horrendous examples of human brutality and abuse (child rape, domestic violence and everyday racism) and also shows in the example of the main character, Celie (a beautiful and understated Whoopi Goldberg), how the human spirit has the strength to overcome unthinkable odds.
252;this story was masterfully translated from Alice Walker's novel to the screen by director Steven Speilberg.
253;american community (that is, when some weren't protesting the novel's depiction of abusive, unfaithful and animalistic African.
254;Was it possible that a white man could really capture the essence of this amazing novel written by a young African American woman?
255;Yes, it was more than possible!
256;I believe Steven Speilberg tapped into his close knowledge of hardship that is rooted in his identity as a Jewish American man.
257;the whole cast was just marvelous!
258;Oprah Winfrey also lends her talents as Sofia, a fearless, dignified woman who teaches Celie the importance of self respect at all costs.
259;it is important that EVERYONE see this film.
260;I thank Alice Walker for having the courage and the strength to write this novel.
261;I also thank Steven Speilberg, all of the actors and actresses and Quincy Jones for adding his masterful soundtrack to this film.
262;This is truly incomparable to ANY other film.
263;If Steven Spielberg had only directed one movie, he would have still been thought of as a great director.
264;Jaws, Schindler's List and The Color Purple as just a few of his masterworks.
265;the Color Purple is a film that will engross you for its entire two and half hour running time.
266;All involved must have channeled something because each performance is unique and honest.
267;this Blu Ray Book edition is really nice and when Blu Ray was being introduced to us consumers, we were sort of promised that Blu Ray would be something special.
268;I happy to say that The Color Purple isn't one of those titles.
269;The characters and much of the dialogue are right out of the book but take on new form.
270;For the true powerful story of Celie and her sister Nettie, the novel is hard to beat.
271;that said, Spielberg uses good visuals for the film, and the acting is uniformly good.
272;The actors who played Harpo and Shug seemed to have vanished from memory but Goldberg, Glover and Winfrey are very strong.
273;americans in the early 20th century.
274;This is the first movie that i could actually connect to being an African.
275;Our identity was stolen from us and we had to, generation after generation, try to create and identity while dealing with corruption amongst our own people and families.
276;anyhow, this movie is funny and for a race where most of us barely know where our great.
277;great (let alone great) grands have come from, I'm sure that I can speak for many of us (African.
278;"The ""Color Purple"" is a moving and beautiful film that is well made."
279;this skilfully crafted film is a tribute to the artistic and exceptional writing skills of Alice Walker, the author of the book with the same title, and the movie making genius of Steven Speilberg.
280;This is a heartbreaking film about Alice Walker's autobiography, which feature, among other things, how she got separated from her sister who was very close to her, how she endured a loveless arranged marriage to a man who often beat her and how her character eventually developed and she underwent self.
281;the actors were wonderful and they perfomed their roles exceptionally well.
282;this is a classic film of all time and one of the best that I have ever seen.
283;It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards but did not get any but has endured over the years, perhaps because of its profound underlying theme on the abusive relationships with which many people relate to.
284;This is a classic movie that everyone should watch.
285;It is a good story of a black woman who came out of abuse and feelings of low self.
286;worth to make her voice be heard in a time where black women were considered the lowest of the low, even by males of their own race.
287;It is a story of triumph in the face of a lifetime of extreme adversity.
288;The storyline is timeless and it DOES have a Very Happy ending!
289;People cheered for Celie in the theatres as she comes out on top.
290;each and every one of the actors were virtual unknows at the time (that is the way Spielberg wanted it) and this is the vehicle that help launched their careers.
291;It is a credit to all who participated in the movie, in any way.
292;Folks, this is one very powerful and emotional film!!
293;This film will stir every emotion inside your body until the end!
294;This is one very fine and top notch film and in my opinion one of Spielberg's finest!!!
295;A movte that gives heart to the era in which the story derives.
296;I love this movie I can watch it over and over again.
297;The actors and actresses are wonderful I enjoyed every minute of this movie.
298;Move me to the point of tears.
299;It is sad and beautiful.
300;The art direction is flawless.
301;Steven Spielberg translated Alice Walker's novel in a tender and respectful manner.
302;This is written from the perspective of our lead character, Celie.
303;One must assume a certain amount of intelligence on the part of the viewer to understand that this was an interpretation of a brilliant novel.
304;Creativity springs from the artist's imagination and inspiration I believe at times, from God.
305;The artists here, Alice Walker, Steven Spielberg, Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey (I could go on to name the entire cast because they are all wonderful in this) do their finest work.
306;Writing a book, creating a movie, is personal.
307;The movie changed me and brought me a deeper insight into so many issues.
308;These are the men she experienced in her life.
309;There is redemption for many of the characters.
310;That is the beautiful part.
311;Yes, this is a film about a black experience.
312;I thank Steven Spielberg for making this movie.
313;This movie is a classic and one of my all time favorites, even if I thought the book was better.
314;Its A good movie but it,s one I belesve you have to watch the whole movie to enjoy.
315;The movie is one of the best movies which I know.
316;But this is actually okay, cause I paid only less than 1$.
317;This movie has to be one of my all.
318;The cast is superb and the story is so compelling.
319;I love all the depth and richness of it!
320;It will make you laugh, cry, and scratch your head.
321;rate Walt Disney film than the actual subject at hand.
322;down Alice Walker's brilliantly story of a depression.
323;class audience at which this film is very clearly aimed.
324;fortunately, THE COLOR PURPLE is remarkably blessed in its cast.
325;Whoopi Goldberg's performance is a revelation of unexpected artistic depth, touching, funny, tough, and entirely honesty.
326;Ophra Winfrey and Margaret Avrey are equally fine in complex supporting roles, and Hollywood's failure to make successful use of these actresses following their appearance in this film says quite a lot about the down.
327;as well as every one in the entire cast.
328;is such that the performers largely transcend Spielberg's ham.
329;heavy touch to make the film memorable.
330;The art direction is merely so.
331;On the other hand, the cinematography is exceptionally fine and deserves a great deal of credit for making the film as enjoyable as it is.
332;The Quincy Jones score, however, is stunning and deserves every one of the accolades heaped upon it.
333;watch this movie for the deeply moving performances, cinematography, and score.
334;The 2nd disc is very interesting in the making of the movie.
335;Whoopie Goldberg is great in this.
336;With all the 60 reviews given ahead of me, I will not go through the story again but to mention it is among one of the best Spielberg movie ever to grace the cinemas over here in Asia.
337;we (here in Asia) were very shock indeed watching the Academy awards and to witness that this remarkable movie about 3 remarkable black women facing sexism and racism win not a single pathetic oscar.
338;with pretty strong scripts, beautiful panoramas and an intense story, The Color Purple to me, is a masterpiece that ranks among most International Art.
339;And most often than not, we see a lot of unfairness in many Oscars awards.
340;the haunting score for this movie is one tune I can hum and whistle till today.
341;well after seeing the color purple I can now proudly proclaim that this country is racially healed.
342;And we owe it all to the great spielberg and this great film.
343;A special kudos to mr. spielberg for having the courage to tackle a black story.
344;your insight into african americans is so great that I'm sure many of the blacks who saw this film and never heard of you thought you were probally black.
345;It took me about 4 times to make myself see it through to the end.
346;A great and memorable film but I wonder why the men were all depicted in such brutish manner.
347;when I heard they were producing a musical on Broadway of The Color Purple, I found it mind boggling.
348;will they next be producing a joyous musical about the HOLOCAUST?
349;The cast deserved Oscars for this one.
350;It was a Christmas gift for my son.
351;Would love to send it back if possible for a working movie.
352;This movie is funny, serious, outright entertaining!
353;cause they come nowhere close to the epicness displayed by the entire cast of characters, the brilliance of the music and the realism of the times.
354;The cast, directing, locations and music were and still are unforgettable.
355;I would think it might be disturbing to some, but it had to be told as is to appreciate the triumph of the human spirit .
356;It is rare to find a film that does not shock you out of its world at some point.
357;one of the things I appreciate the most is the transfer.
358;The extra features are interesting, but not really compelling.
359;I SO DO NOT recommend it.
360;also, the bits with Harpo falling were hilarious.
361;Oprah's a much better actress (and better.
362;I can give you an idea, though: it's what you do in the bathroom (ie.
363;I've read it numerous times.
364;Definitely NOT subjects suitable for children.
365;One of the best movies I have ever seen.
366;Every scene throughout this story is amazing !!!
367;One to see for sure !
368;The acting is top shelf and the story most interesting and entertaining.
369;A must see and must have movie.
370;And he went to the roots of the black soul with a slow paced film but told with unforgettable European style, the camera work and edition process are simply formidable.
371;if I had to establish the first landmark of this acclaimed filmmaker in what heavy weight maturity and artistic stature concerns this would be, precisely my first choice.
372;Supported by a concise script and clever dialogues that breath charm ,humor and portrait the poignant innocence of the childhood, Spielberg built a fresh picture, impregnating of his peculiar style and attached in the tradition of Great Directors of the past, you can observe the influence of Douglas Sirk and Frank Capra, with a clinic eye to discover two emblematic figures that later would be widely known: Danny Glover and Whoopi Goldberg.
373;a pleasant picture that despite the fact it was not immediately recognized, has been able to endure and remain through the years, as proof of its undeniable artistic specific weight.
374;Go for this one, a picture that will always reward you.
375;A film that can make you shed tears of sadness tears of joy would be considered quite a step in the career of a common filmmaker.
376;The fact is, Steven Spielberg, probably our greatest story.
377;It is quite an entrance.
378;One surprise is how Spielberg could present such a moving film about African.
379;americans in the deep south.
380;The PG.13 rated film is pretty open to the sexual issues raised by the Walker novel.
381;The films' most poignant and heartbreaking moment comes when Goldberg and her sister, Nettie (played by Akosua Busia) are separated, maybe forever.
382;There really is something to live for, but love triumphs over all.
383;Spielberg bashers take note: the guy can make an unforgettable classic without any cute aliens.
384;It does not follow the book, however it is most enjoyable.
385;One of the best movies ever.
386;A classic film telling a story of strong women who survive patriarchy and racism until they eventually flourish!
387;Should have won the Oscar for best film in its year but you know.
388;This one is a classic.
389;Although it is an older movie and I saw it when it first emerged years ago, I feel that this is one of the movies is a must.
390;Great delivery, decently priced and a great selection of movies from this seller.
391;Funny moments mixed in tactfully with heartwrenching moments.
392;this is one of the FEW times the movie certainly outshines/outperforms the book it was adapted from.
393;Alice Walker is a great pioneer.
394;american women who deserves all our love and adoration.
395;She explores in this film, and behind it in the book, the slow and progressive liberation of black women from their ancillary slavery.
396;They must find the courage to develop their own personalities and freedom in the closed jail of their skulls, and then, little by little they find the strength and the power to resist men, and then society, and then to excell.
397;Liberatiion is a mental process that finds its total power when it gets public and looks at society as the natural field of its realization.
398;The film is touching, poignant, sensitive, intelligent, sentimental and tremendously potent, if not even pregnant with the most universal language we can imagine, the language of the liberation of women seen as the first step of the liberation of humanity.
399;Alice Walker is universal in this story and she deals with the whole world, and with every single human being.
400;The husband pays for the immigration of his wife's sister's own African husband and family.
401;Wow wow and wow what a great film from start to finish.
402;The film has a great story and a balck women forced to marry a man who beats and raps her, her husband tried to rape her sister so the siter ran off.
403;the acting is great and the direction is outstandin.
404;Steven Spielberg's first true masterpiece, The Color Purple traces the life of a lowly black girl named Celie, so brilliantly portrayed as an adult by the incomparable Whoopi Goldberg.
405;As the beautiful flowers bloom in the fields at the end of the movie, so does her life with the beautiful people surrounding her.
406;first time I saw this film, I hated it, second time it grew on me, and now I am mature enough to appreciate all of it in its finest glory.
407;I highly recommend seeing this and owning it because you'll want to watch it again and again!
408;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
409;A great story, great history, great acting, a must have for your movie library.
410;I loved the movie so much it was so amazing.
411;I've never seen a movie so good in my entire life and I just loved it!
412;I hope to see more movies like this in the near future.
413;Thank You, A person who really loved your movie.
414;The script, the performances by the actors, the cinematography, everything is perfect in my opinion.
415;it is one of my favorite movies of all timeand each time that I watch it.
416;So I highly recommend this movie toanyone and to everyone.
417;Great movie, I really like it and love Woopie.
418;Would recommend this movie to my friends.
419;Received movie in good condition and time
420;Spielberg made it easy for everyone to love this movie.
421;The talented actresses and actors made the film what it is even in today's standard.
422;Of Spielberg's two films on Black culture in America, I feel that he can still take it one step further.
423;The Color Purple is an excellent film, with outstanding performances and great directing.
424;Otherwise, this film is excellent.
425;This is certainly a must have for any film collector, and I have my own copy in my collection.
426;If Spielberg had done that film, I'm sure it would also be a classic as well (it's a classic anyway, in my mind).
427;Whoopie and Oprah was absolutely phenomenal.
428;I've watched this movie at least 10 times and still it moves me.
429;When I first learned he would be the Director, I wondered how he would capture the images and do justice to Alice Walker's masterpeice.
430;It is worthy of such exaggerations.
431;notch all the way (Whoopi Goldberg's debut performance is still a wonder) and Spielberg's visual sense still makes me look on in awe with his use of color and composition.
432;ray is absolutely gorgeous, and even though I would kill for Spielberg to start doing commentaries, the extras are still very good.
433;please everyone out there in Amazon land, READ the whole discription carefully.
434;This is a great film.
435;Thus, in the film when Margaret Avery and Whoopi Goldberg kiss while listening to jazz with a windchime in the air, I thought it was powerful and appropriate.
436;can you believe that heterosexist naysayers played a role in preventing Oprah, Whoopi, Steven and many others from losing Oscars!?
437;"It is just as powerful for women of color as ""Joy Luck Club"" or ""Frida"" is."
438;"I said my favorite movie is ""The Color Purple""!"
439;I read the book a few years ago and was pleasantly surprised to see that it really kept to the spirit of the book.
440;I would highly suggest watching this movie to anyone who enjoys a good pot, strongly built characters, and great music.
441;One of the BEST movies I have seen in awhile.
442;I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it.
443;The movie delivers a poignate look at life back in the day.
444;This is a must see and own.
445;From the first time I discovered this movie and to this day, this movie is and will always be at the top of my list of favorites.
446;The casting is epic, the storyline is even better, and the feeling you get when you watch this movie from beginning to end is priceless!
447;Tears, hope, prayers, and even a few laughs along the way you will not get tired of this movie!
448;The Color Purple is a wonderful film, full of beautiful cinematography, complex characters, and emotional roller coasters.
449;Another classic that I have seen numerous times and also own.
450;The character development is intriguing.
451;I loved watching Celie on her road of self.
452;discovery, and the people she met along the way.
453;It is an instant classic.
454;Spielberg made great character developments and characteristics.
455;This is the finest screen debut ever!!
456;Oprah Winfrey was heartbreaking as the strong Sophia.
457;Margaret Avery gives an outstanding dramatic and musical performance as the singer Shug Avery, who was only one of the few people that cared about Celie.
458;With a combination of Steven Spielberg, Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover, and Oprah Winfrey, how can you lose?
459;While the movie won no awards, the audience won just by having this movie to watch.
460;again beautifully acted, artfully directed and photographed, and wonderfully scored by John Williams, this film takes us on a triumphant journey of the human spirit more than most films in recent memory.
461;After becoming the King of popcorn movies, Spielberg switched his focus, realizing that he could use the world's most powerful medium to make important statements.
462;You must watch its splendor to appreciate it's magic.
463;a cinematic triumph worthy of much praise.
464;The novel's emotional intensity was so much greater than that of the film, I was not moved by the tragedies and successes of many of the characters.
465;The epistolary form with which the novel was written allows the reader to form a greater attachment to the characters and their experiences.
466;Whoopie Goldgerg and Oprah Winfrey's portrayal of Celie and Spohia was outstanding.
467;Costumes fit the time period and I also enjoyed seeing Harpo's jukejoint come to life.
468;This movie made me cry it is a beautiful movie.
469;The tale of hard times for a young girl forced to live with a man and cook,clean,take care of his children and basically be his slave, and the simple things that highlight her time with this man and his children.
470;The Color Purple is a great movie.
471;It was made years back but it's still worth seeing.
472;Individuals gained their freedom, families were brought back together and some people changed for the greater good.
473;i would recommend this movie to anyone.
474;This movie will always be my favorite and hopeully later it will become yours.
475;I've been ordering from Amazon for months now, and they are always on time,or before time and if you have a problem with your order they will, take good care of you at immediate response.
476;I found the performances excellent, especially Whoopi Goldberg and Opra Winfrey.
477;I thought it funny and sad and very heartwarming.
478;ray as I wanted a perfect copy.
479;she loves the movie, she rates it 5 (five) stars.
480;I believed that the cast and crew got screwed when it came to the Academy Awards.
481;The story is so well put and it makes you feel something for some of these characters in this film.
482;Soundtrack was equally as beautiful as the film.
483;The movie is the best I have ever seen.
484;Great movie and will be an all time classic.
485;The movie color purple was a good movie.
486;The film had great scripts and costums.
487;The acters worked very well together.
488;The things I liked most about the movie was that the costums went well with the time frames.
489;This film is a good educational movie on the life of a black woman in the 1930's
490;I got to see it with my fiancee here on Amazon, and the movie moved me as much as it did the first time watching snippets of it.
491;You can feel the emotions of all of the characters as they struggle throughout the film, and overcome those struggles together.
492;It is very moving and emotional, and I loved every minute of it!
493;The strength of all of the female characters is indominatable.
494;For him not to have received the Oscar as best director and for this film to have been denied the Best Picture award is one of many great injustices perpertrated by the .
495;The music was perfect as it built in intensity.You'll laugh, cry, think and be entertained.
496;whoopi Goldberg is one of the best dramatic actresses I think i've ever seen.
497;it ultimately is a triumph of the human spirit.
498;This is one of the best films made.
499;It brought out the unspoken atrocities in many families, but it showed compassion and forgiveness as well.
500;Both the book and the movie, of the same title, shed light on feminist issues.
501;The feminist level of stance is powerful in the novel.
502;Celie struggles to find peace and establish her worthiness.
503;They band together to hold each other up in support and sustenance, even those with interest in the same men.
504;The latter, in their relationship, encapsulate the twin roles of sisters and lovers.
505;some of the women, such as Sofia adapt to fighting for and defending themselves.
506;Sofia is of strong character, she is not subservient, she is powerful and physically strong.
507;The sisterhood feminist bond between Sofia and Mary Agnes is stronger than their mutual interest of affection for Harpo.
508;She is a career blues singer, an occupation that offers her much more freedom than the others who are under the confines of home, housework and bringing up children.
509;Shug's stance on sexual freedom is stronger than that of many other women, she has numerous affairs while enjoying her sexuality without restraint and guilt.
510;Indeed it is the relationship between Shug and Celie that is the central theme in the novel.
511;Shug will liberate Celie in numerous aspects of her life.
512;She passes these qualities onto Celie.
513;Celie becomes strong enough to point out to Albert that the qualities of honesty, integrity, and independence are valid for both genders.
514;I mean she upright, honest.
515;"She bound to live her life and be herself no matter what"" (1982: 270)."
516;the book is a complex weaving of events in a woman's life that are hard to completely represent in a movie.
517;Whoopi Goldberg artfully plays the shy and abused Celie, Oprah Winfrey is powerful as the strong and no.
518;the actors performed their roles exceptionally well.
519;The movie depicts the female characters as generally good persons, not flawless.
520;The women are of unique backgrounds, conditions and talents, and they weave together to help each other out, in feminism strength.
521;both the book and movie turn out to be amongst the most powerful in addressing issues of feminism in everyday life.
522;The book offers much more in that sphere than the movie, but both declare that triumph in a woman's life often happens when misfortune and adversity are challenged by feminist unity and forthrightness in face of a male dominated world.
523;A woman is to significantly love and cherish herself, get rid of the oppression blocking her, before she can fully appreciate and enjoy herself as well as others.
524;This is the best movie I have ever seen.
525;Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, and Danny Gover are magnificent, and the supporting cast does an equally impressive job.
526;On an artistic level the film is wonderful, but its emotional effectiveness (a rare combination of rawness and innocence) is indescribable.
527;She'd just been hit in the head, and as she lay on the ground the wind blew her dress over her head, exposing her underwear.
528;I am crying right now remembering that moment, that stripping away of dignity.
529;The movie is beautiful, simple, and powerful.
530;By turns devastating and uplifting, Steve Spielberg's adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize.
531;winning novel is one of those rare films that effectively captures and builds on the book's underlying themes and moods.
532;The themes presented here .
533;are universal and real and Spielberg delivers a potent mix of superb film technique, a well.
534;crafted plot and simply said, breakthtakingly heartfelt performances from an all.
535;whoopie Goldberg earned an Oscar nod for her amazing performance as Celie, literally transforming herself from the stand.
536;up comedienne we all know and love into a sensitive woman.
537;child whose life is a mix of tragedy and triumph.
538;"Schindler's List ""Birth of a Nation"" are two that come to mind ."
539;Filled with raw dramatic power and awe.
540;"inspiring humanity, ""The Color Purple"" is a film for the ages."
541;Read the book and watch the film to see how great film adaptations are done!
542;There are also a lots of outstanding actors and actresses in it.
543;Seeingeach character's evolution rise above their individualand racial predjudices of the time is beyond uplifting!It gives the spirit a view above the clouds of this world.
544;"the Color Purple tell's one that life can be good and fair,if one listens and act's upon their soul's ""calling""."
545;This movie is great for a good cry, and some laughs, too.
546;I remember seeing this in the theater for the first time.
547;There are special people in the business who I will watch no matter what and Spielberg and Whoopi are two near the top of the list.
548;This movie had all the elements which make a great one in my estimation.
549;The changes that were made from the book makes the story work on film.
550;I have no argument with what was done to make the transition from a remarkable book into a beautiful, moving and important movie.
551;proving just how political those awards are.
552;I recommend this as a must see movie that should be in everyone's library.
553;interesting insight to life in those primitive days of the south.
554;This movie was a literal tour de force for director Stephen Spielberg.
555;This film followed: E. t., Close Encounters, Jaws.
556;What do you do with a artist so versatile?
557;It proved that Stephen's movies had all of that and it also proves that Stephen Spielberg is the man that can do it all.
558;fi, fantasy, I don't think the industry took him seriously just yet.
559;This film just needs more attention and more notice, besides launching the acting career of Whoopi Goldberg and establishing Danny Glover, it showed us a brilliant Oprah Winfrey and a whole host of other fine actors.
560;Not to mention establishing Stephen Spielberg firmly in the records of film making as one of our greatest directors and story.
561;This is a truly wonderful movie!
562;Whoopi Goldberg should have won an Oscar for her performance and so should Steven Spielberg for directing it!
563;I highly recommend that everyone epecially African.
564;It is truly a classic!
565;The price I paid for this set is very well worth it!
566;My mother, who received it as a Christmas present, was very upset.
567;Still think Whoopie Goldberg should have won the Oscar for her role in this film.
568;My husband loves this movie and when I found it online I bought it for him.
569;He loved it and it is pretty hard to fine new.
570;taking place mostly in rural Georgia, the story focuses on the life of women of color in the southern United States in the 1930s, addressing numerous issues including their exceedingly low position in American social culture.
571;Alphonso brings home a new wife, and continues to abuse Celie.
572;celie and her bright, pretty younger sister, Nettie, learn that a man known only as Mr.___ wants to marry Nettie.
573;Celie finds herself infatuated with Shug and attracted to her sexually.
574;Shug and Celie's relationship grows intimate, and Shug begins to ask Celie questions about sex.
575;Sofia returns for a visit and promptly gets in a fight with Harpo's new girlfriend, Squeak.
576;In town one day, the mayor's wife, Miss Millie, asks Sofia to work as her maid.
577;Celie begins to lose some of her faith in God, but Shug explains to her a new view of the Divine, one which places Celie within a loved creation.
578;the entire movie in my opinion is just incredible, and I can't thank you enough.
579;the book came inside the box so it was also in excellent condition.
580;At the same time, Albert is courting a beautiful blues singer, Shug Avery (Margaret Avery), but this does not concern Celie, since Shug's presence provides a sense of hope and love for Celie.
581;In addition, the cinematography enhances the presence and absence of warm and tender love as Celie struggles, which enhances the overall experience and leaves the audience with a brilliant event.
582;spielberg's bastardization of Shug's relationship with her father and the redirecting of her spiritual resolution with the church disempowers Shug especially in her role as a proponent of independent spiritual perception and experience.
583;It is still a beautiful story with its own entity, its own strenghs, its own message to offer.
584;Color Purple is a great movie about two sisters seperated by an evil man that the older sister is married too but wants to have sex with the other one.
585;so he flings the sister from the house never for her to return to see her older sister again.
586;As always this movie is so touching, loving inspiring.
587;Whoopi is be highlight of this movie.
588;Would root for her every time I watch it!
589;This Movie has a powerful view and impact on certain issues that arose in the time it was set.
590;But it is based on a work of fiction.
591;It is a powerful movie that has impacted so many for a reason.
592;It gave us hope, it let us see the impact on so many lives.
593;"every scene has you riveted, and takes you on this long journey with ""Celie."""
594;Both Goldberg and Jackson were flawless in their roles as Celie.
595;it is truly a classic piece of movie making history.
596;The price was right and it was shipped fast!
597;It is nice to own The Color Purple because it's fun to watch it more than once.
598;Operah and Whoopi are hilarious in their roles.
599;It will make you laugh and will make you cry.
600;I'm very please with this product.
601;I also ordered another item and they both came in sturdy box with air bag protection inside.
602;Without the doubt a great copy of one of the best movies ever made.
603;One of the best movies I've ever seen.
604;plenty highs and lows in this story.
605;We just enjoy the movie so much that we watch it over and over.
606;Amazon is always very helpful in finding just the right thing at just the right time.
607;the actors do an outstanding job depicting the characters with all their flaws, weaknesses and beauty.
608;american men in a positive light, that was not the purpose of this movie (or book).
609;there's a lot to learn from this beautiful movie.
610;Still brings tears to my eyes and stirs emotions after ALL this time.
611;I can watch this movie over and over again.
612;Directed by legendary director Steven Spielberg, this was the film that marked the film debuts of some of today's most notable African.
613;while many felt that Spielberg shouldn't have been selected to direct this tale of life in the South because of his religion and California upbringing, Mr. Spielberg's work stands as one of the best films of the 1980's.
614;His style and sensibility to the novel's characters and actions gave him the respect that he deserved and dispelled his critics.
615;this film will make anyone cry, and I can't watch the final scene where Celie's happiness to see her loved ones after so many years is so intense without crying.
616;It was her first film performance and it was her best.
617;oprah Winfrey's performance is also one of the most stirring.
618;Danny Glover is truly amazing as Celie's abusive husband, and so is Margaret Avery as Shug.
619;quincy Jones gospel and African.
620;inspired score is one of the best scores in the past ten years.
621;The scenes where we are transported to Africa to see a sacrifice will keep your suspense up, as well as the gospel performance at the end where Shug reconciles with her father at the church.
622;overall this is one of the greatest films to be ever made.
623;It represents the life so many African.
624;americans had to go through after Reconstruction and during the Great Depression.
625;If you must see a film of the African.
626;american experience in the Deep South, this is it.
627;The Color Purple is a film gem for all times.
628;I am sort of biased because this is my favorite movie, but this movie is great!
629;Great cast, great storyline and great message.
630;This is a great movie!
631;Direction, acting and script are all excellent.
632;I laugh and cry every time I watch.
633;Good movie and my sister love it .
634;thank you for the price too .
635;This is my #2 movie of all time and I think Steven Spielberg did a great job with this one.
636;the movie is based on Alice Walker's Pulitzer Price winning novel and I think it gets the feeling of it and moves it onto the movie/TV screen.
637;Shug is a blues singer who stops by many times and is the only person whom is loved by Mr. Mr.'s son, Harpo marries a woman called Sofia (Oprah Winfrey) who has very bad tempers that bring her all sorts of trouble throughout the movie.
638;In the end, everyone gets what she has to get.
639;what makes this movie one of the best movies of all time?
640;First of all, the fantastic actors and actresses.
641;Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey give the best performances of their career (though both debutants here).
642;Danny Glover is frightening as the evil Mr. though you can understand him as well and I must admit that he won my sympathy in the end.
643;These are only the main characters but all the other actors are great.
644;Spielberg uses special settings and signs to make you understand every movement and every emotion (there are lots of emotions in the movie).
645;Many people think that Schindler's list was the best movie directed by Spielberg.
646;The director of photography does a great job, too.
647;And it gives you something more: a catharsis.
648;The movie has some important messages, too.
649;There is sadness, joy, and there is forgiving, too.
650;"My favorite line is: ""See, Daddy, sinners have a soul, too."
651;It is about incest, it is about men beating their wives and it is about many themes that are considered as taboo themes even today.
652;I highly recommend it to anyone.
653;action lawsuit over this movie: Spielberg takes a heart.
654;wrenching love story between two poverty.
655;It was a Christmas gift.
656;My little brother hasn't seen it yet but he was happy to get it.
657;It is indeed a great movie.
658;Nice to find everything I need here.
659;I loved the singing by Margaret Avery and the church choir near the end of the picture.
660;I watched this film when it first came out and from the very first scene onwards, it has been and still is the best movie ever.
661;The actors and their characters in the movie, the story, the music .
662;the real world out there is a tough place.
663;This movie is about a story taking place in the older days , but in a lot of aspects, it's still very up.
664;Fact is, that there are a lot of homosexual tendencies around which one simply has to accept.
665;But: It's part of the movie, it belongs there!
666;Shug is just the first person, that shows here real affection, including its physical aspect.
667;It is so very, very touching.
668;A true gem in a world full of the works of a highly commercialised movie industry.
669;I love this movie and was unable to watch it as it seems to be defective and would not work in either of my players.
670;A politically incorrect story of a black man abusing his wife over many years until one day she makes a stand, and he eventually does right by her.
671;I bawled my eyes out.
672;I haven't seen it in many years and had forgotten what an incredible film it is.
673;i was particularly moved by Oprah Winfrey's performance.
674;But his filmmaking technique was incredible for this film.
675;The camera work is exciting.
676;everyone has their crying moments in COLOR PURPLE.
677;Celie gets the letter ( I got two children. )
678;God's Tryin To Tell You Something ( See daddy, even singers got soul ) and, of course, 4.
679;I'm saving it for a rainy day!
680;The setting and scenes are amazing.
681;Most women in my mother's generation love it.
682;This movie does feature the best performances ever given by Danny Glover, Whoppi Goldberg, and Oprah Winfrey.
683;Watch it if you have somehow never seen it.
684;I remember seeing this movie a long time ago when i was younger, and decided to watch it again.
685;Having read the book itself before I saw this movie again, I was better able to appreciate it (and remember more about the movie!)
686;and hey, a great job was done by everyone .
687;the cameras, directors, and actors.
688;Some of the scenes are truly incredible.
689;I loved the one with Shug singing and leading her friends to church and being all like 'See, even sinners have soul' as well as Celie standing up to her husband and then cursing him.
690;Oprah and Whoopi Goldberg both did fantastic jobs in their roles as Celie and Sophia.
691;I received this product in a couple of days.
692;It was a Christmas stocking stuffer for my husband and he loved it.
693;This is such an incredible story, and there is so many things to say about it, and yet no amount of words can quite convey the artistic beauty in this hidden gem.
694;The matured talents of Speilberg shine through with a story that is multi.
695;layered, strong characters and cinematography that will leave you awestruck.
696;this poignant drama is based on Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, and the movie has a lot to live up to.
697;The movie is true to the book's diary format, as the diary is read aloud by the Celie, played by Whoopi Goldberg.
698;"This movie gave her her big break, and her performance screams, ""Give this woman an award!"
699;Oprah and Danny Glover also star, and both perform as they never have before (or since!)
700;Margaret Avery's performance as Shug Avery is also worth mentioning, and it is very memorable and poignant.
701;this movie is about the value of being true to yourself, long.
702;lasting love, perseverance, dignity and how to survive in the face of suffering, pain and loss.
703;this movie was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including best picture and actress (supporting players Oprah Winfrey and Margaret Avery were also nominated), and it won none.
704;See the movie and you will experience the injustice of that for yourself!
705;"This is what I call a ""strong woman"" movie much like ""The Help."""
706;This is a classic that I will enjoy for years to come.
707;Certainly a drama but with many light moments and thoroughly interesting characters.
708;A glimpse of early 20th century life of one southern black farm community as it grows into modern times/comveniences and changing male/female relationships.
709;She stated they could have but the bonus features on the flip side.
710;Nobody can deny that Steven Stielberg's take on Alice Walker's novel THE COLOR PURPLE is one of the classic films of all time.
711;It has historical significance as well as significance about black culture and etc.
712;It is an accurate view of an abusive relationship that no matter what race or color that you are, if you have been in such a situation you can definitely identify and relate to it.
713;It is completely understandable why it was nominated for multiple Academy Awards because of its high production qualities, real.
714;life scenery, and its ultimate realness.
715;it is a beautiful production both in colors and clarity.
716;it really was Outstanding X2,in both color,sound,and clarity.
717;just great and about as good as it gets in Blu.
718;"i thought he was in my living room,and a Live Broadway Show on Blu Ray called ""Julie Andrews in Victor Victoria"" My wife and I saw this on Broadway."
719;This is my new favorite movie.
720;The color purple really speaks about the bonds of sisterhood, in a feminist sense.
721;Can watch it again and again, and still cry at the end.
722;I absolutley love the story line of thos movie it reminds me personally of myself and my cousin as we grew up hard in the times of such in this plot~Oprah and Whopie give stellar performances as so does the other actors in it as well~Engaging and heart warming story surly will bring smiles and a few tears i watch it over and over~its one of those kind of movies you jus embrace.
723;one of my absoulte favorite films of all time.
724;The first time I saw this movie, I laughed, cried, laughed some more, cried some more, etc.
725;Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey played their roles so well in this movie, and the story was just beautiful.
726;The ending is the happiest ending I believe I have ever seen in a movie like this.
727;Get this movie and enjoy it with the family.
728;When it came my friend watched it and it was perfect.
729;It came in perfect condition and I didn't have to contact anyone about anything.
730;I love the movie because the contents was not filled with alot of sex and strong language.
731;It made you laugh and cry.
732;This is like, one of my favorite movies of all time.
733;I really love this movie, but the full version would have satisfied me.
734;the movie does a remarkable job at capturing the essence of the black american experience and journey during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
735;whats so good is that the movie comes in close second to the book, Spielberg does an excellent job of translating the book to film.
736;if you haven't read the book consider yourself lucky because at least you still have a great book to look forward to.
737;So I found it on here i ordered two.
738;There is an expectation of subservience shown.
739;'The Color Purple' is a wonderful film!
740;It is full of great characters that are well fleshed out.
741;The cienmatography is fantastic and the story is very compelling.
742;Films like these are why we love movies so much.
743;it's a must see movie!I bought the 2 disc version and this review is for that one edition.
744;The extras are thorough and very interesting with hours of material to keep anyone interested.
745;well you don't know what your missing!
746;It has everything a great masterpiece should have in tonnage.
747;But you pay them no mind Celie, the fickle Sun may indeed shine equally on the virtuous and the sinful alike, but once you have found that bright star inside yourself then Oh!
748;What a light to see by.
749;I bought it in a Barnes and Noble which was very cool.
750;The interviews with the cast are very outstanding in that they put a very clear picture on how the movie was made and what went on backstage.
751;overall I love the movie and am happy with the extras they added.
752;Makes me love it even more.
753;thanks to everyone who worked on the film and letting the audience be a part of this remarkable film.
754;Steven Spielberg's first cinematic attempt to delve deeper than escapism produced a rich, heartfelt epic that matched the Pulitzer Prize.
755;winning credentials of Alice Walker's novel, receiving 11 Oscar nominations but famously winning none of them.
756;The Color Purple is a triumph of all elements of production design, nominated for its screenplay, cinematography, makeup, costumes, art direction, score, and three of its actresses .
757;The snub may have helped push him as an artist toward such prestigious works as Schindler's List.
758;breaking dynamic between three black women in Spielberg's brutal world of racial and sexual prejudice.
759;It boils the blood at the same time that it touches the soul, making for genuinely tear.
760;soaked cinema with a visceral emotional payoff.
761;Love to see this fellow get his comeuppance.
762;I can watch this movie over and over.
763;Whoopie and Oprah did such wonderful jobs in this movie.
764;This is a movie the whole family can enjoy!
765;This movie has been a favorite of mine for over 10 years and I listen to the soundtrack regualarly.
766;the points of the film, Whoopi's film debut and got an Oscar nomination for it.
767;beautifully photographed.2 disc special edition.
768;Great story line and a wonderful ending.
769;One of the very best movies I have ever seen.
770;It is ironic that Spielberg attempts a Griffiths.
771;like approach to this subject as it dessimates any possibility of true insight into the machinations of Walker's more resigned, cerebral literary experiences.
772;Spielberg is a technically astute filmmaker, masterful at grabbing an aesthetically appealing image, arranging shots from strict pre.
773;I have seen it on tv, but there is so many deep messagesin it that I wanted to study it.
774;It is consumed with American culture.
775;Otherwise, I loved the sarcastic humor and love the charactershave for each other and hoW they show it.
776;It cost much more in stores, so I was happy to be able to get it at such a low price.
777;I love it and so glad I bought it !
778;this movie is always a must to have.
779;its old, but always good to have the Color Purple around.
780;Excellent way to do that.
781;The Color Purple is my favorite film.
782;Some parts are shockingly honest and can be difficult to watch, but these moments are followed by hilarious and uplifting scenes.
783;Spielberg makes the viewer experience the full spectrum of emotions.
784;This film, its actors, and Steven Spielbeg were all robbed at the Oscars.
785;Although the ending with Celie is touching, I found Shug Avery's reconciliation to be much more powerful.
786;That scene is one of the great classic in cinema.
787;the Color Purple is always great on rainy days.
788;i got the color purple the day it came out.
789;all they need to do is check out this movie.
790;ray for a while now and most of them all look great.
791;i'm a big fan of 80s movies.
792;It was a new movie in the original packaging which to me is great.
793;This film has everything that makes a film work and become a classic, but it goes beyond that.
794;It's a moving life altering film that'll stay with you forever.
795;Great casting, great music, great photography, great editing and an amazing, heart.
796;Out of Africa is a good movie, but The Color Purple is infinatelly more important and relevant!
797;This is, in my opinion, the greatest film of all time, and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
798;and the direction, photography and score are all equally awe.
799;discovery was far greater than even suggested by the film.
800;This is one of those rare instances where I actually liked the movie better than the book.
801;With a combination of Steven Spielberg, Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover, and Oprah Winfrey, how can you lose?
802;While the movie won no awards (and was hardly nominated) come Oscar time, the audience won just by having this movie to watch.
803;Beautifully acted, artfully directed and photographed, and wonderfully scored by John Williams, this film takes us on a triumphant journey of the human spirit more than most films in recent memory.
804;Spielberg does it again, filming Alice Walker's iconic novel with classy melodrama .
805;the film techniques are so startling, so eye.
806;top dramatic, that it almost detracts from the central story of coming of age in the poor south.
807;I thoroughly enjoyed the movie .
808;Provides an informative, compelling, and emotional window into a community.
809;is to see a great promise, and then pure crap.
810;deserved success (if he did, it sure didn't show).
811;"Spielberg should have a special ""Oscar"" for succeeding in getting such a poor 'actress' giving such an outstanding performance."
812;This movie makes you laugh, cry and can infuriate you to no end.
813;An awesome cast and a movie that you will want to see over and over again.
814;I was looking for this item as a gift and was happy to locate it on amazon at a GREAT price.
815;This is a beautifully filmed story inspired by the amazing book by Alice Walker.
816;It is about human bonds and about the strength of family in the face of conditions that threaten the most basic connections.
817;Everyone needs to see this masterpiece of Spielberg.
818;It is film that makes you cry but also laugh and rejoice at human triumph that the characters represent.
819;Speilberg's cinematic translation of Alice Walker's novel is not perfect, but it does work beautifully.
820;Strong, believable performances come forth from every actor in every scene.
821;in short, you'll love it!
822;A very moving and memorable story which I saw when it first hit the big screen.
823;A classic of its time
824;I saw this movie with my mother and i had to pick it up.
825;i love the movie it self and the all of the actors and actresses and how in this movie it shows how a true love is.
826;Thank you, thank you, thank you!
827;very insightful, because i can identify with the reasons and methods behind every character here.
828;"very seldom does EVERY character in a movie have a story to tell, but they do here
829;alice walker and steven spielberg did great jobs with this, as well as the cast of actors.
830;one of the top five of all american movies.
831;Another classic film well worth watching.
832;I also like the movie.
833;I love this moving but I ordered it from Amazon and only half of the movie is on the disc.
834;I saw this within the first week of its release, and I was profoundly shaken by its power.
835;There's little to be known about the plight of rural Black landowners during the depression, so we're relying on Alice Walker's novel as the basis of the riveting narrative of Celie's journey through a remarkable life.
836;Still, he was deserving of a nomination, showing many layers of a complicated character.
837;driven film, since the best characters (and acting) came from the many fine women's roles.
838;Whoopi was certainly wonderful, though she didn't show up until a half hour into the film.
839;Celie's young character, played with wonderful strength and pathos by Desreta Jackson was appealing.
840;Akosua Busia was confident, as was Dana Ivey, in a bit of inspired casting, as the rich white woman, a grand display of idiocy and ignorance.
841;Rae Dawn Chong's character should've been developed more, since she figured significantly in the final outcome.
842;Oprah, of course, was the most memorable character, since she had the showiest role.
843;To me, she gave the best performance in the film.
844;Her final scene with her father brought tears, her strength of character made Celie the strong character that she became.
845;I loved Avery the most, but Glover, after a great role the previous year in """"Places in the Heart"""", showed great versatility."""
846;Overall, this is a film of passion, warmth and emotion.
847;It's always been one of my favorites.
848;Commentaries would be nice, since most of those involved are still around.
849;this is a great argument for people to ignore awards and critics.
850;This film is a delight.
851;You should see this, and have tissues handy.
852;It made me want to see the movie again.
853;I ordered it on Amazon and got it within a few days.
854;We will go back and finish it.
855;This movie got to a certain part n stopped playing!
856;This is my favorite movie n I'm just not happy bout this at all!
857;This movie could still win an Oscar!
858;The plot is intriguing and the acting is wonderful.
859;Oprah Winfrey is at her best acting ever and Margaret Avery stand out.
860;I recommend this disc to everyone.
861;Whoopi Goldberg makes one of the greatest film debuts in history.
862;Her Celie is as fine a work as any first timer in recent memory, and still her best performance to date.
863;All around superb cast of actors.
864;A great effort from Steven Spielberg's ingenius cinematic mind.
865;Received a well deserved 1985 Academy Award nomination for Best Picure.
866;get ready for an unforgettable journey!
867;The best movie ever ?
868;especially if you plan to let your children watch it.
869;while Spielberg does wonderful things with the visual design of the film and the female leads give powerful performances, the film left me feeling dirty.
870;This Story tells of another way of life.
871;The music will move you and you will feel the tears Celie certainly must have shed.
872;Yes, he is an incredible filmmaker, however, Ms. Walker presented him with a masterpiece to be put into film.
873;"I am grateful for the ""Color Purple,"" for it produced one of the most talented poet ever to be born."
874;Ms. Alice Walker, Mr. Steven Spielberg, and all the actors, to you all, do take a bow.
875;The color purple is one of my favorite movies i can watch it over and over again it's a must have.
876;I enjoy ordering from Amazon and have never had any problems with the product or shipping.
877;This is a marvelous motion picture portraying what the life of black women and family's had to endure in the south from the time they were freed from slavery.
878;What is inside a person's heart and soul is what was important.
879;I have always believed that.
880;This movie woke me up to the reality that some people still treat black Americans like that today in this country.
881;I snatched it before the price shot up!
882;I recommend this to everyone if they can get the great price I paid.
883;Color Purple is one of my favorite movies.
884;"I didn't know that it would have a side ""A"" and ""B"" but that's fine."
885;I've always loved this movie and have gained even more appreciation for it over the years.
886;Both women as well as the other cast of the film deliver awesome performances as African Americans fighting to survive in a predominately white town.
887;The movie will make you have a new take on life no matter what race you are.
888;It teaches you respect and loyalty, as well as passion for the people you love.
889;This movie is a monument to those who made it.
890;perfect in almost every tone and nuance of Color Purple.
891;This movie is just the right movie for about everyone to watch again and agin.
892;A very real story of life for some in the old days, so moving.
893;Actors and cast did wonderful work in this, gives you a true pic of how things were sometimes.
894;If you enjoy this movie, please read the novel by Alice Walker!
895;It will fill in many of the gaps left by the movie and is a wonderful book.
896;This is one of my favorite movies.
897;It shed light on the fact that black women were treated in the early 1900's.
898;This book deserves 2 stars.
899;This is, hands down, the Best Film I have ever seen.
900;I know this because I can watch it over and over and over and over again and discover something new every time, another twist, another lesson.
901;And it always makes me cry, and laugh, and Sing that wonderful song .
902;"Sister, we're two of a kind, Sister I'm keeping my eye on you."""
903;You will relate to it regardless of your race, sex or age.
904;It has something for everyone.
905;It is a powerful testament to the cyclical ebb and flow of human domination and freedom.
906;It shows humanity's ability to stick together in times of trial to formulate a safe haven for the vulnerable.
907;It represents the best and the worst of what human nature has to offer.
908;But, we always have a choice.
909;And it is our choices that matter in the end.
910;I love this movie and am upset that i have to flip it over to view it in its entirety.
911;The color purple is one of the saddest but best movies I have ever seen I absolutely love this movie!
912;a good job has been done transferring this movie from film to Blu.
913;While scenes like those in the juke joint could have benefited from some ambience, this movie is first and foremost a story told by the main character, and every part of that story was understandable.
914;Quincy Jones' music also came through very well, and fairly numerous musical numbers are very enjoyable to listen to.
915;scenes featurettes, two photo galleries, and three movie trailers.
916;conclusionFor fans of the movie, this title is definitely worth picking up!
917;The transfer is good and the booklet and included extras make for a nice addition to a home video library.
918;The transfer is very good, but it should be, considering that this is a Steven Spielberg movie being released on a milestone anniversary.
919;this is a favorite movie of mine but, I ordered this because someone stole my original.
920;This movie is one I watch over and over again.
921;i see and hear something new when I watch it.
922;I mostly cry because the movie is so touching.
923;I loved the book, and was thrilled when they made the movie!
924;The stunning cast does an excellent job of bringing Alice Walker's characters to life!
925;this is such a wonderful movie.
926;It will make you mad, sad, and happy during the movie.
927;i love this movie from begining to in the is movie was excellent i love this movie.
928;The Color Purple has to be one of the most emotional movies I have ever seen.
929;Mr. Spielberg understand the human intimate emotions, and this movie really reaches to your evey sense.
930;Whoopi and Oprah give an outstanding performance, as well as the other actors, specially Glover who you end up kind of hating, but that by all means, meant that his part was really believable.
931;excellent Movie, Excellent Direction, acting.
932;The second disc is all extras and interesting specials, but the entire movie is on disc one, and you do NOT have to flip!
933;Opression, degradation, and racism are present throughout the film.
934;The Mayor follows eight years of jail with a release and Sofia is put into the service of Miss Millie.
935;Miss Millie shows some white sympathy for the coloreds as she tells Sofia she's going to take her home on Christmas day and let her stay all day with her children.
936;Shugs' reconciliation with her father was monumental.
937;good overcomes evil as Celie escapes her bonds from `Mister' with Shug.
938;"Shug singing ""Miss Celie's Blues"" is great."
939;and the acts of compassion that follow between Shug and Celie are awesome.
940;this is a great movie and I'd give it a 4 star rating out of 5.
941;I can remember watching The Colour Purple with my grandad when i was a child and it touched me so much much that i can still remember it now.
942;The Colour Purple still remains one of my favourite films as it is so powerfull and moving.
943;I recommend this film to everyone as it touches humanity in a way hardley any other film does
944;This is one of Steven Speilberg's treasures.
945;Anyways, this was THE best film of 1985, and I don't care what anyone else says.
946;I mean, every performance was Oscar worthy.
947;Her performance as Sofia is awesome.
948;adjust themselves, watch this gem again, and get a second opinion.
949;There is just something about this film.
950;I love it, and I have seen it over fifty times.
951;I will see it fifty MORE times.
952;Steven Speilberg created a classic.
953;He can be sure that his first adult film was a success.
954;It is filled with emotion, and the end always forces me to cry.
955;minded people, but I had the chance to read it before then.
956;Amazing service, Amazing products, and Amazing response time.
957;Danny Glover and Opra winfrey give their greatest performances ever in this great movie.
958;First, they were considered lower class status in the community and in one scene Oprah is physically reprimanded for her opinion.
959;This was a tough movie to watch and I found my spirit of humanity very involved.
960;It is a classic that I love to take out and watch over and over!
961;A moving story of the Colored people from the era of the civil way.
962;a good performance by all the well knownactors that we know.
963;And I will view it a 1000 more.
964;This movie gives you a lump in your throat.
965;It is and will be my favorite of all time!!
966;This is one of my favorite movies.
