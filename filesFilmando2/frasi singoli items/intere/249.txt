I:341;43;As for Traylor, she acted well and was a pretty face.
I:341;44;Two veterans actors in here .
I:341;45;the main story of this movie is a familiar one: revenge, but this time it is played strictly for laughs, and there are plenty.

I:341;73;If you don't know much about him, try looking him up on youtube for some of his Conan O'Brien appearances, and that should give you a good idea of what to expect.
I:341;74;The jail scene is quite possibly one of the funniest scenes of all time.

I:341;78;with cheesy humor from physical to funny lines.

I:341;103;This movie was so funny and had so many catchy lines.
I:341;104;This movie is refreshingly funny and just plain fun.
I:341;105;It is older and rather hard to find because of that, but it is well worth the effort of hunting it down in a video store.

I:341;114;If you're a Norm fan this is a must see.
I:341;115;Teaming up with Chevy Chase, Norm delivers this hilarious and inventive comedy for the entire family (or most of it, at least).
I:341;116;This is my favorite movie on earth and one viewing simply will not do.
I:341;117;So if you've already seen it, take my word for it and see it again!
I:341;118;This movie shows to true fans what Norm is capable of.
I:341;119;Along with Jack Warden, Artie Lange, Don Rickles, and Chevy Chase, Norm proves he has great talent, and a love for prostitute humor.

I:341;131;The first 5 minutes are more than worth getting this movie.
I:341;132;Behind Sandler, Norm is one of the best unassuming comic actors out there.
I:341;133;Artie Lange pulls off a great performance as Norm's best friend.
I:341;134;It's lighthearted, clever and well.
I:341;135;OK, this film bombed at the theaters and I am guessing it was panned by the critics.
I:341;136;HOWEVER, it has some of the funniest lines and scenes in movie history.
I:341;137;ever since the first time i saw it, i've loved it, and it's still funny after the tenth time.
I:341;138;also, you'll almost definitely pick up note to self and use it sporadically.
I:341;139;Dirty Work is a very funny movie that is along the lines of Dumb and Dumber or Saving Silverman.

I:341;146;I just want to make it clear one final time that I thought that this movie rocked.
I:341;147;It has bright colours and clothing (not unlike the latter Kevin Smith films) that look really sharp and has really nice clarity for a low budget comedy.
I:341;148;This is helped by the casting of Arte Lange who had his moments on Mad.
