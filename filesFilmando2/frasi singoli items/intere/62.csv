1;the T. Rex scenes are gripping!A great family pick for those dull Sat nights!
2;I have the best Internet package I can get in my area.
3;Saw it a long time ago but now seeing it again and it is still great.
4;I must admit though that the movie was in excellent condition.
5;"I am very pleased
I:8589;6;I'm a happy customer and you can be too!I love this film and always will.
I:8589;7;This film is a joy to watch and is magnificent entertainment value.
I:8589;8;It's just as spectacular now as when first released twenty years ago to it's stunned and thrilled audiences.
I:8589;9;This new copy of """"Jurassic Park"""" is clean looking, crisp and sparkling."""
10;Jurassic Park is so much better than most of today's new releases in theaters right now.
11;That being it's intriguing well written story line and it's always witty dialog, plus it's excellent performances from all members of it's well known and beloved cast.
12;Everything about this film speaks of the love director Steven Spielberg has for (Dinosaurs), film making and his ability to make and tell a well told adventure tale.
13;Suspense, thrills, humor and terror run rampant throughout this enjoyable film causing today's new fans to laugh and scream in the autotoriums again.
14;All the actors (Laura Dern, Sam Neill, and Jeff Goldblum), are all so young and fresh faced in this film.
15;Time flies when you're having fun!
16;Musical maestro John Williams soaring beautiful iconic soundtrack touched me the same way it always does when I hear this rousing soundtrack.
17;As usual it brought tears to my eyes during the first glimpses of this films magnificent Dinosaur's.
18;I highly, highly recommended this film to everyone except little children.
19;released again in another 20 years for it's 40th Anniversary, and they (and hopefully us) will get to see whatever new and improved special effects Hollywood will have dreamed up in our future.
20;The special effects still don't disappoint.
21;I watched it as a kid and maintain the same level of excitement.
22;I've loved jurrassic Park since i saw it in theaters in 1993 when iwas 9 years old.
23;I never got this to stream in even a decent picture.
24;Its still great to watch.
25;For how old it is, the special effects are still amazing even for now.
26;Epic in it's day, still great now.
27;Loved how they didn't need blood and guts to tell a good story and keep the audience watching!
28;"Jurassic Park, the movie
I:8589;29;com"
30;"Thank you Amazon
I:8589;31;Move on up to the 21st century.
I:8589;32;Jurassic Park was a huge and successful movie when it was released in 1993 and I just a little kid back then but watching this blockbuster now, well this film has lost its luster and excitment.
I:8589;33;so great to have a digital copy of this moviewe love this classic so muchwho wouldn't want to go to dinosaur land?!
I:8589;34;i'm going to be honest here.
I:8589;35;The depths of perception is incredible.
I:8589;36;Sure, it isn't bad, Neill, Goldblum and Attenburough are quite believable in their respective roles and the supprting cast works hard to back them up, but why did Spielberg have to sentimentalize about the children?
I:8589;37;Excellent work of Sam Neill here, who manages to keep the story from becoming a tearjerker, but it shouldn't have been necessary.
I:8589;38;Great special effects for its time.
I:8589;39;Very happy with the order!
I:8589;40;Here's a great movie directed by the fabulous Steven Spielberg.
I:8589;41;i remember very well the first time i saw this film, at a local cinema in 1993.
I:8589;42;It was a chilling experience.
I:8589;43;As a kid, i was truly thrilled.
I:8589;44;today, i still enjoy the movie very much and consider it to be the best of the franchise (the second film being too dark and the third too light).
I:8589;45;But the adventures of Doctor Grant (Sam Neill is very good), Doctor Sattler and the kids are worth bying this.
I:8589;46;Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster based on Michael Crichton's technothriler about cloned dinosaurs running amok on a Costa Rican island, is still an exciting journey of the imagination, even though it's been 10 years since its theatrical release.
I:8589;47;like mixture of chills and thrills.
I:8589;48;after an incident in which a worker falls prey to a velociraptor (in a sequence that pays homage to Jaws, Spielberg's first megahit), InGen's board of directors gets antsy and demands that the Isla Nublar complex, Jurassic Park, be inspected by a team of experts to ensure the park's viability and safety.
I:8589;49;Out to sea, a hurricane approaches Isla Nublar from the east.
I:8589;50;Worse, one of the techniques to enable the cloning of the dinosaurs .
I:8589;51;while not Spielberg's finest achievement ever (Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and the Indiana Jones movies are better), this is still a fun movie to watch, especially on a lazy, hot summer evening.
I:8589;52;It is exciting and suspenseful, and like its close cousin Jaws, is better than the novel that inspired it, thanks to a crisp screenplay by Crichton and David Koepp.
I:8589;53;Even more amazing, Spielberg also gave us Schindler's List later that same year, proving his talents in organization and creativity.
I:8589;54;This is one of the best dinosuar movies I've ever seen in my whole entire life!
I:8589;55;They are, always have been, and always will be my favorite dinosaur of all time, whether they be in the three Jurassic Park movies or in the late Cretaceous peroid 70 million years ago.
I:8589;56;This movie was filled with intense action, as well as some funny moments.
I:8589;57;And the setting, the sheer terror, the design, the savagery.
I:8589;58;It is well worth your $25.00.
I:8589;59;T. rex roaring in my face, rain everywhere, edge of my seat.
I:8589;60;This movie is one of my favorites!
I:8589;61;The only reason I bought it was as a gift for one of my co. workers who loves it.
I:8589;62;Steven Spielberg's direction of the actors is absolutely terrible.
I:8589;63;ups of Dr. Grant's face, Jeff Goldblum throughout the movie, and the kids just plain suck.
I:8589;64;Steven Spielberg is just a pop director.
I:8589;65;The actual story is good and the special effects were amazing for the time, but the acting and directing darn near ruin it.
I:8589;66;This is and was the best dinosaur movie I've ever seen.
I:8589;67;And how old is it now and it still holds up well against other movies' special effects today.
I:8589;68;as for the story, some will say it's slow, but I think the pacing is perfect and although kids now a days might think there isn't enough action, I think the build up to the first time you see the Tyrannosaurus Rex attack is one of the greatest moments in movie cinema.
I:8589;69;It's intense, scary, even funny, and best of all you don't think about the special effects because you're watching a real 8 ton monster wreak havoc.
I:8589;70;The movie is worth this scene alone and then when the raptors come you'll be jumping and at the edge of your seat.
I:8589;71;I received the product early, which was great.
I:8589;72;One of the best films of 1993 and based on the best.
I:8589;73;jurassic Park is a pretty good movie.
I:8589;74;The visual effects such as the giant Brachiosaurus encounter to the Galliminus chase scene are spectacular.
I:8589;75;Jurassic Park is one of the best movies of the 1990s.
I:8589;76;ray and great to have on UltraViolet so you can watch it anytime, anywhere.
I:8589;77;The kids love it, and its amazing with the new blu.
I:8589;78;ray technology that it looks just as good as it did in theaters if not better.
I:8589;79;And the digital copy makes it so i can watch it anywhere.
I:8589;80;I bought the movie for a friend of mine and she was so happy.
I:8589;81;She wanted it bad, so I went on Amazon and found it, it was in real good condition and she has watched it over and over.
I:8589;82;I watched it at home with my wife and some friends.
I:8589;83;Very glad I was able to grabb this at a good cost.
I:8589;84;It was great to watch it again.
I:8589;85;It still put me on the edge of my seat.
I:8589;86;From my childhood to adulthood, this movie will always be one of my favorites.
I:8589;87;Of course, Jurassic Park is an amazing movie.
I:8589;88;If you liked it when it first came out, you're going to love this.
I:8589;89;The first time you see the full view of the T. rex and he roars, that was good times.
I:8589;90;It is so real that the dinosaurs seem to come into the living room.
I:8589;91;Movie far exceeded our expectations.
I:8589;92;This movie stands the test of time.65 million years worth.
I:8589;93;It changed our perception of CGI and opened up a whole new realm of story.
I:8589;94;Jeff Goldbloom delivers some of the movie's great philosophical dialog with a perfect balance of humor.
I:8589;95;Sam Neill delivers a perfect blend of awkward scientist and reluctant hero.
I:8589;96;There, dinosaurs are brought back to life after 65 million years.
I:8589;97;There, the people have an adventure, but not a very happy one.
I:8589;98;The Dinosaurs look real, thanks to CGI and models.
I:8589;99;All in all, the best of the Jurassic Park movies!
I:8589;100;d effect is pretty good and the sound effects are amazing.
I:8589;101;This is now my sons favorite movie!
I:8589;102;Nearly 10 years on, this Spielberg classic is rivalled only by Jaws for originality, tension, and superb performances.
I:8589;103;This was the first and definitely best in the series of 3 movies, and I almost wish they'd stopped here, where the trilogy arguably peaked.
I:8589;104;The best thing about this picture is it's longevity however.
I:8589;105;Like """"Jaws"""" it is a non topical and timeless adventure for the whole family (with the exception of very small children)."""
106;It's gripping, and often scary without being offensive or gratuitous and will undoubtedly be rediscovered by each succesive generation of viewers.
107;Deservedly hailed now as a classic piece of Cinema.
108;A great movie at a great price.
109;I loved this movie when I first saw it.
110;Great price and they enjoyed watching it with me!
111;lol)thank you again for the fast shipping!
112;This movie is a classic and watching it you actually feel like you are seeing real dinosuars.
113;The story was great and for the time the special effects were amazing.
114;Haven't seen it in years and it was just as good today as it was 20 years ago.
115;This is a really cool movie.
116;The special effects and sound are awesome.
117;The movie just sweeps you into it.
118;Sam Neill, Joseph Mazello, and Ariana Richards do a great job together as they are lost in the park.
119;It's full of suprises and twists and turns, as the story will leave you on the edge of your seat.
120;This is the coolest movie ever, and it's a definate must.
121;Movie is great as always.
122;Still enjoyable, and the special effects still look believable all these years later.
123;This movie lacked the oomph that the book had but it was still great.
124;But still, these scenes in particular were very, very real, very scary and pulse.
125;If you don't have it already, Give it a shot!!
126;, and to me that is a very good question.
127;Coming out the same year as Spielberg's masterpiece `Schindler's List' it was set as Spielberg's Blockbuster of the year.
128;It breaks my top five for the year, that's for sure.
129;Regardless, this is still a landmark film to say the least.
130;These dinosaurs are of course behind steel bars and are the main attraction for a new theme park.
131;`Jurassic Park' is directed brilliantly by Steven Spielberg, so much so that not a frame goes by we don't remember.
132;The acting is decent among all here with Sam Neil and Laura Dern as standouts.
133;Wayne Knight is effectively disgusting as Nedry and Richard Attenborough makes a fine Hammond (although if you've read the book you'll know that his character is changed DRASTICALLY for the film).
134;Samuel L. Jackson continues with his long line of thankless roles in any and everything he can get his hands on.
135;Tell me, aside from his `Pulp Fiction' and `A Time to Kill' stints (both brilliant I will admit) what has he given us but filler performances.
136;filmmaking at it's very finest.
137;If you saw this as a kid it was down right amazing!
138;", ""We're back in the car again"", ""God bless you""."
139;liners from the movie, obviously designed to generate a laugh in the audience.
140;In Spielberg's earlier work (E. t., Close Encounters, Jaws) there wasn't some underlying moral message and it got on just fine.3.
141;INCREDIBLY, the girl continues to shine the flashlight at the T. rex.
142;When I originally saw this movie, it was at a movie theater with an excellent sound system.
143;A classic comedy of our time and the definitive satire on nuclear warfare!
144;And the raptor eggs, what a riot!
145;Sam Neill delivers the performance of his career in the role of a lovable and dull.
146;witted paleantologist with great support from his peers (Richard Attenborough, Jeff Goldblum, and the timid Mr. Arnold).
147;Excellent direction, good editing and a well chosen cast makes the film worth a watch.
148;My grand children love it.
149;A lot of action to keep their attention.
150;It was sent in great condition to us.
151;Great movie, no matter how many times I see it.
152;Now watching with grandchildren, and excited to see how excited they get.
153;This film is one of the top grossing movies of all time, and for good reason!
154;After recruiting 2 archeologists and 1 chaos specialist, the overly confident owner and developer of the park gives the trio a grand tour in order to publicize his main attraction.
155;Now the race is on to survive the outbreak and call for help before its too late!With amazing special effects and edge of your seat excitement, Jurassic Park is bound to amaze viewers for generations to come!
156;The effects are seamless and the action is heart stopping.
157;We have a scientific breakthrough that brings the dinosaurs back to life after a much touted 65 million year absence.
158;: A game park to be precise.
159;the next thing you know, T. rex has escaped and is snacking on lawyers and the rest of the good guys are battling it out against a pack of vicious Velociraptors.
160;Lots of tension and suspense here.
161;Jurassic Park, is quite simply, one of the greatest blockbusters ever made.
162;The plot looks simple: a group of experts and friends are invited to explore a theme park that has yet to open .
163;but the premise is high.
164;ride for survival, complete with claws, teeth, fangs, venom, and more.
165;in the human corner, we haveSam Neillas Dr. Alan Grant, a crusty but passionate paleontologist, and his partner Dr. Ellie Sattler, played with childlike wonder byLaura Dern.
166;Richard Attenborough's excellently optimistic performance as the park's creator John Hammond is a highlight of the film, as of course is Jeff Goldblum in full Goldblumish glory as chaos theorist Ian Malcolm.
167;"The supporting cast, including Wayne Knight, Bob Peck, and Samuel L. Jackson give tremendous performances, and the immortal lines ""Clever girl"", and ""Hang on to your butts!"
168;In the dino corner, we have the T. rex, a tremendous achievement in special effects, and one of the most awe.
169;you have both an incredible achievement in digital and practical effects, and the groundwork for the most awe.
170;Ask anyone about the first time they saw Jurassic Park, and they will be able to tell you where, and who with, and of course, about that feeling of sheer awe in the face of Spielberg's spectacle.
171;And that's the greatest thing about Jurassic Park: Yes, the special effects might be a little dated, and maybe those kids are annoying.
172;And THAT, my friends, is why I give the film 5 stars.
173;Jurassic Park is an unforgettable cinematic experience that has no equal anywhere.
174;If this review was helpful to you, please give it a like.
175;"I've always pitied myself for never seeing ""Jurassic Park"", a film that many deem a must see."
176;Today, I watched it for the first time, and I loved it.
177;the plot is simple enough.
178;Both have proved to be successful, and their research attracts the attention of Doctor John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), who offers them a trip to his dinosaur theme park, Jurassic Park.
179;steven Spielberg really outdid himself with this film.
180;The special effects are amazing, and the dinosaurs are amazingly realistic.
181;The performances are great (though Goldblum is the only one that is really of note).
182;The special features are a bit lacking, but you cna overlook that since this film is truly a masterpiece.
183;And I expect service that works.
184;this is the last year I subscribe, and the last year I use Amazon.
185;I've seen the movie about 32 times (mostly in 2nd and 3rd grade when I was a fanatic) and I learn something new every time.
186;I believe they had the perfect amount of good acting, emotion, characters, science, thought, and action, not too much or too little (I think It would be interesting to read the book if it was by Arthur C. Clarke).
187;Contact was good too, if you liked this you'll probably like it too.
188;great movie, I have seen it 4 times and will watch it again and again as time goes by.
189;Throughout the decades there have been classic movies of its time.
190;earth people who can act very well and are very believable.
191;This was based on Micheal Chrictons novel (an excellent book) and they are somewhat similar a few changes from book to movie but they were good and they worked.
192;The script was very good and the direction was great.
193;Thanks for the thrill of a lifetime!!!!!
194;One of my favorite things to do is have a JP movie playing in Spanish.
195;That way I can even claim that it's study!
196;he spit in Michael's eyes cuz he screwed up a line of This Ol' Man !
197;All 'n all, Spielberg's got himself a humourous/thrilling, yet very timeless classic amongst the King Kongs/Godzillas of the film industry.
198;It's more than a little uncommon for a film to visually impress two times in a row.
199;What made for spectacular viewing the first time becomes old news by the second.
200;And with the rate at which the technologies used at the movies advances, these former special.
201;poppingly amazing to look at.
202;perfect look of modern movies.
203;And in a movie that has the awesomeness of the natural world as a major theme, that really helps to sell it to you.
204;behind Jurassic Park's new bells and whistles is the same excellent Spielburgian film it has always been.
205;John Hammond, a visionary scientist, has had a jolly old time playing around with genetics.
206;the couple Alan and Ellie, and the eccentric ladies' man Ian Malcolm .
207;extinct T. Rex's is actually safe.
208;jurassic Park knows what it wants to be .
209;fiction thriller, and it does that well.
210;Beyond that, though, it's effective as something of a pseudo.
211;the acting is mostly excellent, particularly with Jeff Goldblum as Ian.
212;Richard Attenborough also does a wonderful job as Hammond and his rapidly.
213;While the characters are not the centerpieces (Jurassic Park is much more War of the Worlds than ET), it helps the film immensely to have such engaging performances.
214;The added dimension fits the film perfectly, as if it were shot that way all the way back in 1993.
215;And if you're somehow lucky enough for this to be your first viewing, than enjoy.
216;You're in for a wild ride.
217;Always will be one of the great movies of all time in my book.
218;First time for my daughter to watch it.
219;a good movies but not as good as the first onepart one was good with lots of drama nd less action neat flow
220;Now I can share it with my son, and he just loves it.
221;CGI is still fantastic for he m
222;the movie is way to exciting to see what happens to the next scene to the next scene and the characters are hilarious and great.
223;In my opinion, one of the best action movies ever made.
224;Viewed: 4/03, 12/13Rate: 412/13: I remember the excitement of the general population when Jurassic Park came out in 1993.
225;At the same time, the dismal story undid the wondrous spectacle and rendered the film as a joke.
226;Jurassic Park is one of my all time favorite movies.
227;ray disc and began to notice a good deal of grainy artifacts in the beginning of the film.
228;Some of the interior shots in the Jurassic Park computer center, especially at the edges of the frame were filled with a great deal of dancing grain.
229;good:I don't even need to mention the special effects.
230;the atmosphere was really great.
231;ian Malcom and John Hammond were decent characters.
232;But I guess it is a decent movie, though tyounger viewers would enjoy it a lot more.
233;An amazing movie and this combo pack does a great job of having a way to access the movie anywhere.
234;Jurassic Park is a great, thoughtful, imaginitive, and fun movie.
235;It has a great plot.
236;I remember the super hype in summer 1993 over this movie.
237;It was great to see theatres, twice!
238;The film is about a wealthy man who starts up a real life dinosaur park.
239;This movie has great effects and music.
240;Also a wonderful cast including Sam Neil, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Samuel L. Jackson.
241;I love Wayne Knight as the parks trader!
242;See the equally good sequel The Lost World:Jurassic Park.
243;Its like watching a whole new movie compared to the original.
244;My husband and I saw this in theaters when we were dating and we enjoyed it as much this time as we did back then.
245;I bought this for my mom as a gift, as it's one of her favorite movies.
246;'Jurassic Park' is a masterpiece, even today.
247;This amusement park is unlike any other, for it is an amusement park of real.
248;created by top scientists who discovered a way to bring dinosaurs back to life.
249;This movie rocks and the special effects are just stunning and simply spectacular.
250;The plot is really good and there's even some humor.
251;The whole cast from Sam Neill to Samuel L. Jackson is absolutely superb.
252;This is one of my favorite Speilberg films ever.
253;The directing and filmmaking are top.
254;Some of the best special effects of the early '90s are featured in this movie.
255;If you have not yet seen 'Jurassic Park', then I strongly recommend it .
256;And if you liked 'Jurassic Park', then I also strongly recommend 'The Lost World' and 'Jurassic Park III', which are just as amazing and awesome as the first!
257;This is a nice family movie for all ages over 12 years old.
258;always at a really good part .
259;Best movies ever made, the Jaurassic Park movies.
260;Scares the heck outta me at times, but very good movies, well made and I love them.
261;I'm real excited about #4 and can't wait to watch it.
262;That's what Spielberg wanted and that is what I gave him.
263;Now I have to go back and watch the movie again, which I had (of course) planned to do many times anyway.
264;It is very well worth the wait!
265;The attention to detail is in every scene.
266;Even Sam L's cigeartte is perfect.
267;It is a very good movie and we have enjoyed it very much.
268;The service was great and we got it without any trouble
269;It was a full blown phenomenon!
270;Steven Spielberg is the unrivalled king of such films.
271;Every few years he puts out another spectacular that sweeps the world and sets a new standard (like Jaws, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, E. t., Raiders Of The Lost Ark, etc.).
272;Throw in an approaching hurricane, and you've got the perfect monster movie!
273;It's his way of thrilling us and breaking new cinematic ground that we love.
274;Jurassic Park blew my mind with it's realistic T. rex, Raptors, Triceratops, and the rest.
275;We got CGI that put flesh on 65 million year old bones!
276;The team that made this movie are legendary, and have pushed special effects to stratospheric heights.
277;JP is a true milestone that stands the test of time.
278;this was and old movie but the effects in it was really good I would suggest this one the kids loved it
279;The transfer is top notch and the sound is simply amazing.
280;It may not be a classic yet but it will be, sorta like E. t. Wife didn't really care for the movie but she liked it better at home than in the theater.
281;My kids really enjoyed this movie .
282;"But they found it to be faced paced
I:8589;283;Probably the greatest achievement in special effects, of all time.
I:8589;284;Back when CGI was new, Spielberg crafted it into his existing toolbox of FX masterfully, and the story is timeless.
I:8589;285;This movie is old yet it is one of the best movies ever made.
I:8589;286;The actors are the best Sam Neil,Samuel L. Jackson.
I:8589;287;And the dinosaures look so real.
I:8589;288;This movie is worth the money!
I:8589;289;This movie is the best,I mean the best movie ever.
I:8589;290;Also it is the special effects that it is in the movie, which make the movie real.
I:8589;291;Second it is the actors,SamNeil,Samuel L. Jackson,Bob Peck,and many more.
I:8589;292;It brings to life the true scope of the adventure and puts you right into the action.
I:8589;293;We really enjoyed the enhance color and audio which this video providedis
I:8589;294;The kids were fantastic actors!
I:8589;295;I enjoyed the movie and the special effects were well done.
I:8589;296;This fun movie is fine for the whole family.
I:8589;297;The special effects are so riveting, you forget to breathe until it's over!
I:8589;298;the best is either the first one or second one .
I:8589;299;Good family entertainment in any case.
I:8589;300;Already a fan of the original movie, I'm really impressed with what they did here.
I:8589;301;This is a reproduced world of various dinsaur types.
I:8589;302;The on site laboratory is well protected with secure doors and alarms.
I:8589;303;Part of the scenario includes rides to see all of the centuries old creatures.
I:8589;304;There are so many good scenes that will capture your imagination through action, suspense and awe.
I:8589;305;What happens in Jurassic Park is taking it to the extreme, but it still makes an exciting movie, nothing else is like it.
I:8589;306;Jurassic Park is just one of those memorable movies that you'll never forget.
I:8589;307;The movie arrived quickly and worked fine!
I:8589;308;Big dinosaurs gonna eat you up!
I:8589;309;Highly recommended for any Jurassic Park fan!!
I:8589;310;I think I like the movie because it is entertaining and the creatures look so real.
I:8589;311;create dinasours on an un.
I:8589;312;inhabited island, an excellent cast including Sam Neil, Laura Dern, Samuel.
I:8589;313;l. jackson, and the great Jeff Goldblum, directed by talented Steven Speildberg, and great music by John Williams.
I:8589;314;It brings back a lot of childhood memories.
I:8589;315;And my love of dinosaurs!
I:8589;316;Wish I had bought it.
I:8589;317;all I can say is WOW!
I:8589;318;I and my family were immensely pleased.
I:8589;319;This is every bit as amazing as I remembered it, and then some.
I:8589;320;It is as if we gained a new sense of experiencing a film beyond regular sight and sound.
I:8589;321;And yes: the sound was even more improved as well.
I:8589;322;see it if you can at the theater: on the big screen this is mind.
I:8589;323;Spielberg's movie is that good.
I:8589;324;see it at the theater if you can, but I am sure you will love it at home, too.
I:8589;325;It is an exhilarating movie that hasn't lost a step in 20 years: truly AMAZING!NOTE: It makes you wonder if we'll ever seeJawsre.
I:8589;326;This movie is always good to watch.
I:8589;327;Dinosaurs are cool, science is cool.
I:8589;328;I destinctly remember going to the theater and seeing this movie and going wow .
I:8589;329;There are very few movies that make me do this and this is definatly one of them.
I:8589;330;This movie is one of Steven Spielburgs most fun movies and you are making a huge mistake if you dont see it.
I:8589;331;and Speilberg succeeds yet again, delivering the thrills and chills at a breakneck pace.
I:8589;332;The movie is great, but streaming wasn't one hundred percent.
I:8589;333;I would recommend it to anyone, especially if you want to spark interest in biotechnology and genetics.
I:8589;334;The special effects are still stunning to this day.
I:8589;335;The mix of CGI and animatronics creates a balance of reality few films manage to find.
I:8589;336;for those with good sound systems the 7.1 DTS master track is as amazing as I recall from the theaters.
I:8589;337;It is incredibly satisfying to hear the soft rustling of leaves from the left rear speaker, followed by a chirp from the front right.
I:8589;338;The visuals may draw you in, but the sound is what brings alive the immersion.
I:8589;339;jurassic Park has always been an excellent movie.
I:8589;340;An adventure 65 million years in the making.
I:8589;341;such is the tagline for Jurassic Park, the onscreen adaptation of Michael Crichton's wildly successful novel about the human.
I:8589;342;aided return of dinosaurs to planet Earth.
I:8589;343;One of Steven Spielberg's greatest achievements, Jurassic Park was, and remains, a special effects masterpiece unrivaled by its peers.
I:8589;344;Dinosaurs roam the plains and scour the forests against the backdrop of conductor John Williams's original score (some of the best music of his career, which is saying a lot).
I:8589;345;The computer generated creatures are so amazingly animated, that you'll finish the film believing that Jurassic Park is a real life destination.
I:8589;346;dr. Alan Grant's (Sam Neill) life is dinosaur bones and the study of the various ancient reptiles that once dominated the Earth.
I:8589;347;But when Dr. Grant is approached by the eccentric multimillionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) in regard to touring """"something of great interest,"""" the man's world of dinosaurs becomes more realistic than he ever thought possible."""
348;But Jurassic Park also offers an interesting and compelling story, lots of action, and reams of suspense.
349;Even an occasional lawyer joke helps to break up the intensity.
350;A summer blockbuster by a director who almost single.
351;The saving grace, of course, is the special effects and surround sound.
352;She stopped watching it half way through.
353;Cool movies if your kid is older and into dinosaurs.
354;Jurassic Park is a fun.
355;filled movie and very exciting.
356;Looks like a brand new movie, and the sound is quite excellent as well!
357;The first scene with the TRex is phenomenal in the surround sound environment.
358;a story line that has possibilities.
359;and when this movie came out by far the best movie animation.
360;even the kids did a great job.
361;I highly recommend this version!
362;The biggest attraction of this film back in 1993, of course, was the realistic computer graphic animation of the dinosaurs by SGI coupled with the realistic sound effects and the good use of suspense built around them both.
363;One aspect of the movie that still impresses me that doesn't get much mention is the outstanding use of sound and sound effects.
364;It is still great action adventure viewing for the entire family, and the 50.
365;"minute documentary ""The Making of Jurassic Park"" was very interesting too."
366;James Earl Jones narrates this extra feature in which the special effects are given particular attention and examination.
367;The documentary also includes interviews with Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton.
368;This night is about to get fun!
369;thanks for a great evening of entertainment!
370;Looking for a family friendly movie suitable for 10y.
371;Even if you've watched it 20 times it still delivers a few scares and amazing scenery.
372;kids and Adults LOVE this movie .
373;It's a little slow for the kids in a couple areas, but over all the movie is fantastic.
374;Lots of drama + learning about dinosaurs in an exciting way makes this a hit for our family.
375;This is probably the most credible, most perfect concept in science fiction that I can recall.
376;I have no doubt that the restoration of life from extinct genetic material will one day be possible, and that is what makes this movie so exciting.
377;Bravo to a great movie, with great effects.
378;A great way to revisit this classic.
379;Recommended just for the thrill of it all.
380;This film is full of gotchas and pitfalls about opening a dinosaur park (and sub.
381;This is a grat movie that is a very close adaptation of the book it is based on.
382;Jurasic Park is one of the best movies out there.
383;It is better than the book.
384;Watching it again, Jurassic Park holds up as great entertainment, even if the characters and storylines seem a bit flimsy at times.
385;It's probably more worthy of 4 stars than 5, but hey, this is the movie of MY generation and I'm not going to apologize for its rating.
386;Jurassic Park continually reminds its viewers that Steven Spielberg is the greatest entertainer since Walt Disney.
387;Constantly filling the screen with visual treats, keeping the plot moving at a brisk pace (once the obligatory exposition is filled in), and allowing us to enjoy ourselves without stooping too low, nobody does blockbusters like this man.
388;perhaps taking it for granted that movies should be so thrilling and fun, and that every filmmaker was capable of such wonders.
389;He had introduced the world to the blockbuster (Jaws) and had made audiences for the past 15 years laugh (the Indiana Jones movies have terrific comedic bits to them), cry (ET), and cringe (Hook).
390;No longer did props, locations and, nowadays, actors have to be readily avaliable .
391;And the CGI never gets in the way of the story, as it does in countless movies today.
392;it is added seamlessly with great believablity.
393;Of course, the story is simple.
394;The now famous sequence with the T. rex attacking the tour cars is some of the best suspense since the days of Hitchcock, and although Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Wayne Knight may just be those guys you've seen in that other movie, the acting is good too.
395;So sit back and enjoy the movie that started the computer revolution that you now see in today's theaters.
396;In fact, you could pop this in and enjoy it more than what's out today.
397;As we all know, this is one of the greatest movies made!
398;It was way beyond its time when it released and to this day it still competes with the CGI and effects of brand new movies.
399;The original Jurassic Park movie remains my favorite of the three in the series.
400;"There is also good casting and acting from Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum (a good fit as a ""Chaos."
401;"tician""), Samuel L. Jackson (way underutilized), and Richard Attenborough (very likeable as the entrepreneur, John Hammond)."
402;the movie does require some suspension of disbelief and acceptance of pseudoscience but overall the plot is strong and the effects are believable.
403;This is one of the few movies that has the ability to keep you literally on the edge of your seat.
404;For that same reason it is one of my teenager's favorite movies.
405;A real Spielberg gem that does not dissapoint in thrills.
406;I remember this movie being really exciting and it still is.
407;I found that I cared more about the dinosaurs than the characters.
408;About the only thing this movie is good for these days is as a film.
409;I remember seeing this when I was a kid, definitely one of my best memories.
410;I'm looking forward to Jurassic World, but nothing will ever top the original!
411;Wealthy entrepreneur John Hammond (an excellent Richard Attenborough) secretly builds an all new type of safari park on a remote tropical island.
412;a suspense filled, action packed and charged atmosphere throughout, which continues to impress.
413;Near perfect casting and screenplay make sure the action has a meaning, and, in this film, the division between reality and fiction becomes almost as thin as in the novel.
414;a marvel of cinema and a key part of flick history.
415;If I had to say one good thing about this film its that the effects on the dinosaurs are very good and the overall feel (including the soundtrack) is very professional.
416;Because Dinosaurs capture the hearts of many children Speilberg probably thought that his remade models of these creatures would carry the film by themselves.
417;Leaving out the technical stuff is all fair and good (it's great in a book but would be out of place in a film), but surely characters and whole scenes should stay in the film?
418;In the film, Grant and Sattler are implied to be some sort of item .
419;The book makes you believe that one day, maybe, just maybe, we'll be able to create dinosaurs.
420;The film on the other hand just seems like the fantasy that it is.
421;speilberg was great with Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, and he proved that he could make gritty, powerful and realistic films.
422;i love love it everyone should want to see it
423;I'd give it more then 5 stars if I could.
424;Sam Neil, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum are the best actors(actress) ever!
425;A rich Scotsman has hired a staff of scientists who have discovered how to clone dinosaurs from DNA found in ancient mosquitoes trapped in amber.
426;He decides to build a theme park on an island, so the whole world can come see real live dinosaurs.
427;this is a good, exciting idea and it's well written and well acted.
428;The dinosaurs are so well done you can't believe they are special effects and this was over a decade ago when effects such as these were in there infancy.
429;Classic movie whose computer graphics are surprisingly good, even though the movie was made years ago.
430;The story is so engaging.
431;We love the movie and still do but we should have just bought the blu ray.
432;Jurassic Park is an awe.
433;inspiring film that kept me entertained throughout.
434;The music and visuals are a real treat and the characters are likeable too.
435;Jurasic park was very well made.
436;this is a great film and is very exsiting.
437;Just as good as the first time I saw it.
438;Prime made it very easy to watch the movie for a reasonable price.
439;A movie so good that it takes away most of Sam Neill's nincompoopery!
440;There's basically 2 kind of summer blockbusters: the big visually impressive film, and thrill rides that gets adrenaline pumping.
441;The latter half are the edge.
442;seat types and Spielberg is best when he does these kind.
443;"Yeah Private Ryan and Schindler's List are great films but they're more ""arty"" than entertaining."
444;john Hammond is part of a genetic breakthrough: he's successfully brought back dinosaurs to life using a technique which integrates their DNA with that of frogs to fill in sequence gaps.
445;hungry computer programmer named Nedry decides to steal the valuable dino embryos and smuggle them to another company, plus a hurricane that's heading right for them.
446;Where the film succeeds is the effects and the suspense.
447;The other performances are great as well.
448;The movie does have great action and CGI and all that but I liked some of the quiet moments in it, like the brontosaurus eating leaves off the eucalyptus.
449;I also liked the part when they went on the tour and didn't see anything.
450;I was pleasantly surprised when I found out it wasn't.
451;On the surface it is a touching scene, but we all know what happens.
452;As the title states, Spielberg's recreation of the novel is splendid.
453;Today I have a 4 year old who loves dinosaurs.
454;The benchmark by which wholesome family entertainment should be measured against.
455;Steven Spielberg is a movie genius!
456;This is one of the greatest suspense/action/sci.
457;Jurassic Park is a landmark film, in that nobody had ever seen special effects like the seemingly living, breathing dinosaurs it assaulted the world with.
458;Steven Spielberg does well on this film, with several classic scenes of killer dinosaurs dismantling vehicles and slowly pacing kitchens.
459;to leave the best for last, I will discuss what I dislike with this film first.
460;there are, however, many fine points to this film.
461;Spielberg's directing is good, with foreshadowing of Velociraptor attacks and great action scenes.
462;Jeff Goldblum especially does a good characterization as the chaotician Ian Malcom.
463;the special effects are super, especially when the time at which Jurassic Park was made comes into consideration.
464;The dinosaurs are very believable and alive seeming.
465;this brings us to the dinosaurs themselves.
466;the gigantic Tyrannosaurus Rex ensures that all eyes are riveted on her, with eerie roars and ground.
467;their intelligence is a step away from human rationality.
468;this film is definitely good for what is usually a cheezy genre, and makes for a good screen spectacle.
469;I think i will watch it again.
470;In 1993 he managed to release films in both genres.
471;Jurassic Park set a new standard for special effects in moviemaking, while Schindler's List proved that Spielberg could tell a serious, emotional story.
472;with Jurassic Park Spielberg had to overcome the gargantuan challenge of creating realistic, believable, lifelike dinosaurs that would share the screen with actors.
473;There were a number of approaches that he considered for bringing the prehistoric titans to life.
474;Spielberg then gathered together some of the greatest minds in the special effects field.
475;They even consulted Jack Horner, an esteemed paleontologist, to assist them in their efforts.
476;in June of 1993 the highly anticipated film was released to eager audiences.
477;the story focuses on an eccentric capitalist, John Hammond, who uses modern science to genetically engineer living dinosaurs from cloned DNA.
478;Hammond even invites his two young grandchildren, Lex and Tim, saying that they are the target audience and therefore perfect to prove the potential allure of the park.
479;fi thriller that will stun its viewers.
480;Other cast members include Samuel L. Jackson, Bob Peck, Martin Ferrero, B. d. Wong, and Wayne Knight.
481;production meetings, animatics sequence, storyboards, dinosaur encyclopedia, production notes, cast and filmmakers' bios, and theatrical trailers for all three Jurassic Park films.
482;i also recommend the beautifully evocativesoundtrack by John Williams.
483;It's been a while since watching it, but well worth the time.
484;Well, I have to hand it to Steven Spielberg, even though he often annoys me.
485;"He made us pay attention to archeology and the Ark Of The Covenant
I:8589;486;Wow, say what you will, the man has done some amazing things in the world of film.
I:8589;487;Here, he brings dinosaurs back to life and gives us another classic adventure story, unlike anything seen up to this time.
I:8589;488;i rank this one right up with the best of all.
I:8589;489;time among great adventure stories.
I:8589;490;This is truly memorable stuff.
I:8589;491;To this day, those scenes can still get your attention.
I:8589;492;the movie has always been fun to watch, and not just because of the thrills or special effects, of which there are too many to recite here.
I:8589;493;There is humor in here and characters are interesting, led by Richard Attenborough as the scientist who creates Jurassic Park.
I:8589;494;do a fine job of acting, as good as the adults.
I:8589;495;definition Blu=Ray, which should bring another generation of fans to this innovative film.
I:8589;496;One of the greatest directors of all time has created a world of beauty amazement and horror adventure.
I:8589;497;This movie was one of the greatest movies ive ever seen.
I:8589;498;Spielburg makes a dino film for all ages I mean all ages!This movie presents good thrills, an excellent plot brought by the author Michael Chricton, great acting, and of course the dino violence this is a fun thrilled ride for the whole family.
I:8589;499;This was the first film ever to bring dinosaurs to life and thrill dino nuts all over the world.
I:8589;500;The character's are great, the soundtrack is huantingly beautiful, and the dinosaurs are amazing.
I:8589;501;This film has some stunning scenes that can only be appreciated in the full format (so get the wide screen edition) This is just an awsome movie.
I:8589;502;Surely you're familiar with Steven Spielberg's """"Jurassic Park"""" by now."""
503;"ray last year was just as spectacular as seeing it all those years ago, but personally speaking ""Jurassic Park"" never gets old."
504;john Williams score is as epic as ever.
505;hearing the raptors screech in an IMAX theater is one thing, but the T. rex scenes are just incredible.
506;That immense roar and its massive footsteps are even more amazing in this atmosphere.
507;It is worth the price of admission for the T. rex scenes alone.
508;Even though the film has been around for 20 years, it's amazing that the special effects are still quite good even by today's standards.
509;Jurassic Park is one of those special films that can stand the test of time.
510;This is an excellent movie when seen in 2D and it was a big hit when it originally came out.
511;This film was a runaway hit back in 1993, and still carries quite a punch today.
512;dropping effects, sheer amazement, and spine.
513;It all seemed so real!
514;They intermove with the real people so seamlessly you believe they are real as well.
515;The picture transfer is perfect, and the sound is incredible.
516;dimensional charactors, amd weak plot, the breathtaking special effects more than make up for it, and make this one worth owning.
517;I showed this movie to my 2 year old nephew and now we have to watch it every time he comes to the house.
518;I still love this movie over the sequels.
519;I think the kids in the movie are great and there is a great chemistry between all the actors.
520;"It's almost like Spielberg's making fun of the audiences who flocked in hordes to the theaters
I:8589;521;'Jurassic Park' is on my list of the best movies to never recieve a 'Best Picture' nod at the oscars.
I:8589;522;I feel that 'Jurassic Park' is still one of the best films to ever grace the big screen.
I:8589;523;The film quickly turns from awe and wonderment to fear and terror and it does so with smart and effective scenes and dialog, and what works so well here is that not only does it serve up great action and suspence but it also builds up the charactors and gives you a look into these people, creating a three dimentional cast and giving the veiwer a feeling of being there with these people as the try and survive.
I:8589;524;One of the most effective thrill rides to date and well deserving of all the praise.
I:8589;525;By far my favorite movie of all time, Jurassic Park exceeds all expectations as a movie would from it's vividly believable dinosaurs to a stunning cast including Sam Neil as the infamous Dr Grant who would return to Jurassic Park later for another adventure.
I:8589;526;This movie is by far a visual and theatrical masterpiece, using both C. g. i and animatronic dinosaurs to stun us as they roamed the screen.
I:8589;527;I personally reccomend this movie to everyone and anyone If thwey want to truly experience a movie that was a landmark of its time.
I:8589;528;Seems to have been a very good job.
I:8589;529;weve all seen it and we all love it
I:8589;530;Good movie, steamed well straight to my tv.
I:8589;531;Steven Spielberg won the Oscar for directing Schindler's List, and it is as great as any other Big, Serious Movie you'd care to name.
I:8589;532;here is a special effects movie that, like Terminator 2 before it, heralded a new era of filmmaking.
I:8589;533;, but Jurassic Park is memorable because of the love and care its director lavished on his beasties.
I:8589;534;fi adventure escapism at its best.
I:8589;535;i will always admire this movie for the T. rex sequence, which scared me so badly in the theater that I had to pony up three more times to take the ride again.
I:8589;536;What a great moment"
537;The final scene, which brings together the T. rex and the raptors, is a fast, brutal classic that leaves you wanting more.
538;the acting isn't great, but it is efficient.
539;I have a very nice system $8,000.00.
540;It is a very nice system and hooked up to internet for updates.
541;Jurassic Park is a wonderful movie.
542;For it's time, the special effects are revolutionary.
543;Steven Spielberg's masterpiece is back, better than ever in this collectors edition filled interviews and behind the scenes documentary.
544;jurassic Park remains one of my favorite movies of al time and it is a classic.
545;It has held up well and the story is good but it is still showing it's age at times.
546;inn and i loved it!The special effects are awesome and the cast was great!I This will always be my favorite dino movie:.)
547;The CGI and special effects may not be up to par with modern day blockbusters, but they still hold up very well.
548;The film is one of Spielberg's best and is a masterpiece of suspense.
549;It's one of the last movies I remember seeing that makes great use of animatronics instead of heavily relying on CGI.
550;In my opinion, Jurassic Park belongs on the list of greatest movies of all time, and will continue to stand the test of time for years to come.
551;ray was excellent and the film is just as good as I remembered from my childhood.
552;The story is a good one,bringing dinasoars back to life.
553;And indeed, most of the extras are just documentaries about how great CGI is.
554;realistic with the dinosaurs and then have humans not react to these ultra.
555;But the T. rex is the star of the show and I have to admit that he 'does' deliver.
556;The Raptors too are a great accomplishment (though it is important to note that they are scientifically inaccurate .
557;"of course, ""Jurassic Park"" is a lot of fun to watch, and I think it's a great dino movie."
558;"It ushered in a whole new age of movie effects and creature features, much more so that ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" or ""The Abyss"" (also two great movies that really paved the way for CGI)."
559;It has more to do with how the real actors interact with their CGI environment and less to do with how good the CGI actually looks.
560;it's because the actors having something real to interact with on.
561;still, a great accomplishment and fun movie.
562;Simply put, the greatest film ever made!
563;The directing is superb, the music is unforgettable, and the visual effects are never to be matched.
564;Jurassic Park brings it all to the table in an adventure film for the ages.
565;"I was already a huge fan of Spielberg's ""E. t."", but now I had another movie to love."
566;he directed a terrific movie that know one will forget.
567;this has to be his best movie since e. t. i love this movie and so will you.
568;He brings in a team to evaluate his living attractions, and from that point forward everything that can go wrong does.
569;the lean, economical screenplay, by Michael Crichton and David Koepp, does just what it needs to.
570;it moves us efficiently from thrill to thrill.
571;Even today, when almost every film seems to include some CGI, the effects hold up very well.
572;"The classic and best dinosaur movie before ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" from the discovery channel!"
573;i got my film faster than expected, it came with slipcover,and that made me very happy.
574;It came very well protected in packaging.
575;i was so satisfied i ordered again a couple of days later i loved this seller and will keep ordering from him.
576;This Twenty year old classic is heart.
577;The realism in this finely crafted piece of visual magic simply overwhelms one's senses.
578;fi movies show their age, both with the technology used and the science referenced as the backdrop for the story.
579;fi horror show, but he still manages to bring out the joy of the movie experience that makes many of his movies so fun to watch.
580;Sorry to burst your bubble, human beings has only been on the earth for 5 million years.
581;I wish people would keep their religious views to themselves, and let people enjoy these kind of movies.
582;Jurassic Park is a great movie with good acting, great special effects, and exciting action sequences.
583;If you have a good 5.1 home theater receiver and speakers and a subwoofer, you will really enjoy this movie.
584;All the little details are highlighted.
585;All the leaves in the trees, cups on tables, they all pop off the screen!
586;Jurassic Park, directed by Steven Spielberg, is an excellent thriller.
587;Dinosaurs escape from their restrictions in a new amusement park.
588;Good plot, good acting, bad SFX!
589;Michael Crichton's imaginative and fascinating novel brought to vivid life by Steven Spielberg.
590;It is a truly fun movie experience from start to finish.
591;And both movies came out in fine shape too, a fact which is backed up by the accolades (and huge box.
592;because the movie is so much fun otherwise!
593;And the choice of actor Jeff Goldblum to play the part of Dr. Ian Malcolm was the best casting decision made for the whole picture, in my view.
594;He adds a lot of humor to the film.
595;"i've liked Mr. Goldblum in everything I've ever seen him in
I:8589;596;His dry humor and easy.
I:8589;597;going style come across nicely in this film.
I:8589;598;Plus, yet another witty Goldblum.
I:8589;599;:)Mr. Spielberg blends a great deal of comedy in with what should be a major calamity .
I:8589;600;but Spielberg manages to lighten up this scenario skillfully, with several humorous scenes.
I:8589;601;the great John Williams composed the music score for Jurassic Park .
I:8589;602;and it fits the movie like a glove.
I:8589;603;rate musical scores for film after film .
I:8589;604;via a full and booming Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack and a handsome Widescreen (1.85:1) Anamorphic video transfer.
I:8589;605;a generous helping of Special Features is dished out by Universal, too .
I:8589;606;with the top prize in the package being the very informative behind.
I:8589;607;opening featurette, explaining much of the creative work that went into getting this film to the movie screen.
I:8589;608;picture industry at the time of the film's production in late 1992 and 1993, making Jurassic Park a true pioneering film in many CGI ways.
I:8589;609;rOM stuff, a Dinosaur Encyclopedia , and some cast.
I:8589;610;there's a certain magic that emanates from Jurassic Park #1 .
I:8589;611;with its three main ingredients for success (and fun) being: Director Steven Spielberg, John Williams' terrific score, and those first.
I:8589;612;At first I thought the price was way to high.
I:8589;613;But now that I have seen the movie it's worth the price!
I:8589;614;ray version of Jurassic Park is quite good.
I:8589;615;The details are crisp"
616;The special effects hold up surprisingly well considering the film is now twenty years old.
617;fi thriller like this one.
618;About the only complaint that I have has to do with a few night scenes, which come across as gritty in the transfer.
619;I was skeptical about how this movie would look on blu ray, but I was very pleasantly surprised.
620;Spielberg's use of robots instead of 1994 CGI showed to be the right move, as the movie held up very well.
621;A couple of scenes the velociraptors jump out of the screen it looks incredible.
622;"We watched on our 120"" across screen so that may have helped the experience."
623;But Jurassic Park was as good as I remember it as a kid
624;I think it is a good movie, not much blood.
625;I know the movie very well and love it.
626;I was really glad I could share this with my kids.
627;The movie delivers all too well on its promise to show us dinosaurs.
628;We see them early and often, and they are indeed a triumph of special effects artistry, but the movie is lacking other qualities that it needs even more, such as a sense of awe and wonderment, and strong human story values.
629;Richard Attenborough, as the millionaire who builds the park, is given a few small dimensions .
630;he loves his grandchildren, he's basically a good soul, he realizes the error of tampering with nature.
631;Also along are Attenborough's grandchildren, and a lawyer, who is the first to be eaten by a dinosaur.
632;with skill and subtlety, as in a caper movie .
633;True, because the director is Spielberg, there is a high technical level to the execution of the cliches.
634;pieces are especially effective: A scene where a beast mauls a car with screaming kids inside, and another where the kids play hide and seek with two creatures in the park's kitchen.
635;The creatures they see are tall, majestic leaf.
636;There is a sense of grandeur to them.
637;"Think back to another ambitious special effects picture from Spielberg, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977)."
638;It was a movie that had faith in the intelligence and curiosity of its audience.
639;Jurassic Park throws a lot of dinosaurs at us, and because they look terrific (and indeed they do), we're supposed to be grateful.
640;Because the movie delivers on the bottom line, I'm giving it four stars.
641;You want great dinosaurs, you got great dinosaurs.
642;"Spielberg enlivens the action with lots of nice little touches
I:8589;643;On the monster movie level, the movie works and is entertaining.
I:8589;644;My son loves this movie and I love the fact I can download it to my ipad with this included disk.
I:8589;645;Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.
I:8589;646;The plot is very original.
I:8589;647;A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs.
I:8589;648;The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park.
I:8589;649;That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.
I:8589;650;Jurassic Park is one of the biggest movies of all time, brought to us by Steven Spielberg and the incredible wizkids at Industrial Light and Magic.
I:8589;651;The movie inspired awe in anyone who first saw it in the theatres.
I:8589;652;Richard Attenborough is a rich man who creates an island theme park full of cloned dinosaurs, and is one of the first films to deal with the serious issue of cloning.
I:8589;653;There is also a load of extras, including trailers for all 3 films.
I:8589;654;So many movies lose their luster as they age but this one has remained both entertaining, engaging and powerful.
I:8589;655;My jaded kids loved it and the scientific aspect intrigued them enough to google additional info after the movie.
I:8589;656;Better yet, it was a great family night.
I:8589;657;But I will tell you about the great DTS track included in this DTS.
I:8589;658;It is superior and so much better than the one included in the Dolby Digital edition.
I:8589;659;In short, I absolutely recommend this DTS.
I:8589;660;a great family movie with horror comedy action and suspense.
I:8589;661;the excellent transfer of video and earth shattering audio.
I:8589;662;Screams and laughs throughout and the girls reaching out to touch things, lol.
I:8589;663;Highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an action.
I:8589;664;The special effects are awesome!
I:8589;665;One of the best movies of our time.
I:8589;666;I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater (twice) when it first came out.
I:8589;667;I was really looking forward to J. p since it is one of the best sound movies ever made.
I:8589;668;As far as the movie itself goes, I still love it.
I:8589;669;Probably as a new feature film would have been more impressive
I:8589;670;This was always a fun movie, and now it's just great.
I:8589;671;The movie brings that glimpse to life, using state.
I:8589;672;art special effects to create the mammoth creatures and a talented cast to carry out the story.
I:8589;673;Special effects in this film, while they were only made in 1993, are seamless and utterly believable.
I:8589;674;The acting leaves nothing to be desired, with compelling performances from the supporting cast as well as the leads.
I:8589;675;An interesting twist on the not.
I:8589;676;unthinkable, this film is one of Speilberg's best.
I:8589;677;Great movie, great musical score!
I:8589;678;Hard to imagine few movies as fun as JURASSIC PARK.
I:8589;679;I had fun when I first saw this Spielberg offering in the theater, and I have grand fun every time I catch it on cable.
I:8589;680;art CGI effects that make this thriller so special.
I:8589;681;the cast is exceptional, but I especially enjoy Jeff Goldblum as a free.
I:8589;682;spirited science ethicist"
683;liners and zingers are priceless.
684;Comes in plastic wrap and is exactly what i ordered for much cheaper than most stores!
685;Cant wait to give this as a gift.
686;While I loved almost every aspect of the movie, its the dinosaurs that steal the show, naturally.
687;And it's not just because we see a T. rex in full form or a pair of ruthless Raptors, but this is the first time something is presented in glorious CGI.
688;Jurassic Park made a huge impact with that for its time, just like Terminator 2 did in 1990 and the Matrix in 1999.
689;Jurassic Park had its place too, at bringing to life dinosaurs that look wonderful and real, and hold up even today on the screen.
690;based off the book by Micahel Crichton, one can't expect the over all feel of the film to be as good, but honestly the whole thing worked just fine.
691;The cast is quite decent, and though huge amounts of dialouge are not shared as well as deep in depthness to most of the characters, its ok because this is about the dinasours and the park on the island.
692;A tropical storm comes, and combined with a sneaky worker named Dennis (Wayne Knight .
693;Thus begins the last hour thrill ride of chases and survival tactics.
694;There are two scenes that are very action filled.
695;in addition to the dinosaurs, I enjoyed the characters and their acting was fine.
696;The story was excellent too, and though a bit slow at first, it works out well.
697;Thanks to the directing of Spielberg and the outsanding score by John Williams, every scene is a good one.
698;And thanks to Williams usual impressive composing skills, he creates not just good music, but a theme for Jurassic Park that is easily recognizable whenever heard.
699;It was created before its time, and holding up very well for today's standads.
700;The story is fascinating and the dinosaurs themselves .
701;have liked this movie since it first came out.
702;Great to add another movie to our growing collection.
703;"The point, though, is to hop on for the ""ride"" and enjoy it at all levels: action."
704;All in a big, glitzy, gorgeous, commercial Hollywood blockbuster by Steven Spielberg, the master of the form.
705;This was a nice one to add to it.
706;Great fun, good entertainment that never gets outdated.
707;The first installment is the best.
708;I love this movie and have seen it many many times.
709;Fun way to watch it
710;If memory serves, despite the great technological advances in the 60 Years between King Kong and Jurassic Park, the Great Ape still has the edge over the Dinosaurs.
711;The difference fundamentally is, of course, that the Great Ape had a heart and a soul: he could and did love the White Goddess, Fay Wray.
712;happily, one can see and enjoy both today and anyone seeking adventurous thrills in a film should see both.
713;up job thereby earning the reward of making the two additional films their performances allowed.
714;need I add that Spielberg can be proud of his achievement, as well as being happy over the fortune he earned from it.
715;penned source material, in action it's got Steven Spielberg's fingerprints all over it.
716;friendly adventure flicks in his portfolio in that it's big and intense without going so far over.
717;top as to scare the kiddos.
718;Of course, at the time the real star here was the film's fantastic effects work .
719;perfect as the muttering, brainy Ian Malcolm) and there are plenty of character moments scattered about to flesh out the more extravagant action sets.
720;Next thing I must complain about is first they seriously over rated guns then they completely underrated the intelligence of professional gun men!
721;I really hope somebody goes back and completely remakes a similar story line.
722;I was lucky that I was able to get it working in about 15.20 minutes.
723;five miles off the west coast of Costa Rica, man brought nature's most extraordinary creatures back from the past using a special technique of recovering and cloning dinosaur DNA.
724;length adventure vividly entertaining and suspenseful from maybe the most successful director, Steven Spielberg ( Jaws , E. t. ) and author Michael Crichton (writer of Congo and many more successful novels).
725;I am very happy that they are going to release Collectors Editions of the film.
726;Everything that was in the movie was great, all the actors were great, it is obvious that everyone that worked on it worked really hard.
727;A fascinating story with a Frankenstein.
728;ray pretty much captures the essence of this movie to me.
729;Beautifull and just breath taking!
730;"Plenty of incredible ""pop"" out scenes with a perfect combination of depth."
731;She was born in 1917, give her a break.
732;this movie defines smart, elegant, cool, action, adventure and education without breaking a sweat.
733;Spielberg's heart was still in his work.
734;and in JURASSIC PARK, it shows all of Spielberg's heart.
735;The idea that a devious billionaire (Hammond, played by the long.
736;mtDNA and create living dinosaurs was so incredible.
737;It is worth watching because of that alone: the corporation as angel.
738;It is what is on the screen and it is the truth as Spielberg wanted to express it.
739;They looked like real animals, and it can be said JURASSIC PARK introduced CGI to the world.
740;It's a major landmark in film.
741;It gave us a dynamic Sam Niell, a new and glossy Jeff Goldblum, a sexy Laura Dern, an impossibly grumpy Samuel L. Jackson (who was nearly unknown back then).
742;wow, I could go on forever.
743;one last thing is the soaring, riveting score by John Williams.
744;because it is the grand.
745;It is, like most of Spielberg's work, highly manipulative rather than artfully done.
746;Spielberg loves to take shortcuts, hitting the obvious notes at the prescribed time.
747;He is a director from the sledgehammer school of film, continuously thumping you on the head until you get it.
748;They are the reason I've watched and enjoyed it many times.
749;some of the characters/actors are more successful than others (my favorite is the ever snarky, and always right, Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm).
750;And yet, I will keep watching it.
751;My husband and I had seen it 20 years ago and thought it would be entertaining to watch with them.
752;A guy has developed a way to create dinos.
753;It's amazing that our family pops this movie in on a regular basis, and it still works as enjoyable viewing.
754;This film still has something which the other two do not have.
755;While all the films lack any real character development, this one has more characters that we really care about.
756;sucking lawyer first, but even he had some charisma.
757;Our very first glimpse of the herds on the island is still breathtaking.
758;i rate I, III, and II as my favorites, in that order.
759;I was captivated by the smart extrapolation of science, particularly the clever use of biotechnology for breeding extinct animals, the warnings about uncontrolled uses of new technologies (Crichton's recurring theme), all the new and updated information about how dinosaurs really were, and by Crichton's trademark in his earlier works, a storyline full of verisimilitude, imagination and originality.
760;generated (CGI) special effects, the dinosaurs looked very realistic, fully integrated with the actors.
761;The merit of the movie is indeed the successful introduction of CGI, a technology that was a revolution in cinema, from which we are benefiting from up to these days.
762;Together with Star Wars and The Matrix, JP is a landmark in modern cinema's history.
763;for those of you who were kids or teenagers in 1993, when you watched the movie for the first time, I highly recommend you to read the book, especially if you already are a SF fan.
764;Jurassic Park is thrilling, believable, and well told.
765;A rarity in action movies like this.
766;Since this movie is based on Michael Crichton's bestselling novel, the script, story, and characters are excellent.
767;Sam Neill brought Jurassic Park to life, he was superb!
768;Jeff Goldblum was perfect for the role of Ian Malcolm and brought subtle humor to the screen, which I loved.
769;Laura Dern rocked, this is defintely her best performance yet!
770;The dinosaurs and sets are breathtaking and it's almost scary how real they look!
771;Steven Spielberg did an excellent job at directing Jurassic Park, he deserves an Oscar!
772;Jurassic park is amazing and intriguing, a must see.
773;This movie has great special effects, to think that this movie was filmed in the 90's.
774;Great movies, could watch it again.
775;It was probably the last true blockbuster of the modern era.
776;Everybody loved the special effects and seeing realistic dinosaurs on the big screen (remember, this was the FIRST time a movie had realistic dinosaurs as opposed to Godzilla.
777;It's a perfect mix of lovable and oddball characters.
778;I love the subtle character development over the course of the movie, particularly with Dr. Grant and John Hammond.
779;The movie by contrast embraces the wonder of seeing dinosaurs on the big screen and is much more fun to watch.
780;It was already an instant classic when it came out and I predict it'll be so even years from now.
781;Its one of those films where every couple of years you just feel like seeing.
782;For all who don't know jurassic park is about really rich man that funds a science team that finds out how to make dinosaurs.
783;He plans to open a theme park, the worlds most successful one, so he gets two archaeologists to ok the park for him or teach the other people about dinosaurs what they eat, what the can't eat etc.
784;When I originally bought this movie on video, I bought it in widescreen so I have something to compare the picture to.
785;rom, a screensaver and access to Live Web Events!
786;This film has great special effects and excellent storytelling and acting.
787;I'm having a great time enjoying one of my favorite classics in a crisply remastered format.
788;d is surprisingly good, considering that the film wasn't originally shot in 3.
789;d. I'll treasure this for a long, long time!
790;It's a great way to get students and young children interested in the concept of genetic engineering.
791;As modern science moves towards great genetic achievements, it is absolutely critical that students have some understanding of DNA.
792;Although pure Hollywood fiction, it is still a great movie
793;But it's a damn good one, and it's an even match with any of the Indiana Jones films for sheer escapist adventure (thank God Steven Spielberg directed films during my adolescence).
794;And yes, Jurassic Park is very fun.
795;As a result, its first appearance is truly terrifying.
796;inspiring (with these images nicely boosted by John Williams' rousing score), and with such great special effects on hand, holding back the sight of the dinosaurs would be a pretty silly notion.
797;Sam Neill is great as always, playing the likeable Grant as a convincing action hero who never resorts to ridiculous stunts.
798;rate filmmaker (yeah, I admit it, I'm an exremely ardent Spielberg fan).
799;"The other performances are good
I:8589;800;Loved the man, wish he was in the movie more.
I:8589;801;it's interesting to note that the pacing is so good, I never noticed that the film doesn't get into the dino action until almost the halfway mark.
I:8589;802;The film was enjoyable before the dinosaur mayhem, and once the dinosaurs start chomping down on puny humans, the movie jumpstarts into a remarkable thrill ride.
I:8589;803;There are two action sequences, in particular, that stand out.
I:8589;804;mouse game with the raptors is an even more impressive nail.
I:8589;805;JP's got great action, first.
I:8589;806;rate special effects, and charismatic leads"
807;Personally, I enjoyed it a bit more than Jaws, probably because Williams' score never goes inappropriately playful at any point in JP.
808;By certain definitions, Jurassic Park might not rate as a great movie, but it's great entertainment, and what more could you ask from a film?
809;rate, the comedy is well done, and the special effects are.
810;well, do I really need to say anything?
811;"And the cast is perfect
I:8589;812;famous line Must go faster!
I:8589;813;And while he may not always be successful at it (1941 and HOOK being examples), he is successful far more often than not.
I:8589;814;JURASSIC PARK, based on Michael Crichton's 1990 novel, is a prime example of Spielberg's abilities.
I:8589;815;What results is some of the most terrifying and suspenseful sequences of 1990s cinema, from a director who clearly studied the techniques of the Master, Alfred Hitchcock.
I:8589;816;winner of three Oscars (Sound, Sound Effects Editing, Visual Effects) and a $1 billion box office winner to boot, JURASSIC PARK, scripted by Crichton and David Koepp, is a hugely entertaining and relevant science fiction/suspense thriller that, while giving audiences the requisite chills and thrills, also has a warning about the potential dangers of cloning, which now seem to be coming perilously true in reality.
I:8589;817;John Williams, yet again, provides Spielberg with another memorable music score.
I:8589;818;Followed four years later by THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK (a very respectable sequel), and in 2001 by JURASSIC PARK 3.
I:8589;819;Some of the special effects are better than those in films today.
I:8589;820;Jeff Goldblum is a national treasure.
I:8589;821;In 1993, imagination, science and technology came together, bringing these remarkable creatures back from extinction in a spectacular motion picture that became a worldwide phenomenon: Jurassic Park.
I:8589;822;A Steven Spielberg film starring Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough, Jurassic Park is a breathtaking adventure that opens the gate to a lost world, the incredible world of the dinosaurs.
I:8589;823;Before opening the attraction to the public, Hammond invites a top paleontologist, a paleobotanist, a mathematician/theorist, and his two eager grandchildren to experience the park and help calm anxious investors.
I:8589;824;This is the original story of Jurassic Park, a simple but well developed idea based not only on the best.
I:8589;825;selling novel by Michael Crichton, but also on truly scientific evidences.
I:8589;826;In order to evoke this lost world, Jurassic Park makes use of striking visual and sound effects that depicts faithfully these extraordinary creatures which were the dinosaurs, how they were and how they lived"
827;this incredible motion picture goes 6,5 million years back of evolution to inspire millions of people today and give us what we humans must need: hope.
828;Because although dinosaurs appear to be the real creatures, we are the villains of this story which is life.
829;And as the birds fly away at the end of the film it is time to think about our own existence and our place in the world habitat.
830;"As Spielberg said during filming of this biogenetics adventure ""My interest is in making a good movie that honors the existence of dinosaurs""."
831;Jurassic Park is a good one entertaining without inappropriate content.
832;The special effects become more real.
833;A classic that looks great on Blu.
834;Putting you back in that seat with that bucket of popcorn.
835;Having that feeling that a T. rex is coming to eat you and there isn't anything you can do to stop it, it's all here.
836;Jurassic Park is one of the best, especially if you have a subwoofer!
837;As others have said the rain effects are way cool but the roars and the impact tremors will totally absorb you.
838;The extras are cool too.
839;You'll also see production sketches/paintings, and a fly.
840;wall effect of early production meetings.
841;Steve and the effects guys really look like 10 year olds playing with toys it's great!
842;The widescreen version was crisp, clear, and no signs of artifacting.
843;It was a great movie before and made it even better.
844;I looooove it, hope for part 2 and 3 soon .
845;haven't seen this movie since I was a kid, but it is still a great actions/adventure flick.
846;what was state of the art special effects 20 years ago isn't quite up to today's standards, but that being said its still definitely a must.
847;Spielberg at his best and awesome soundtrack as well
848;ray edition is much more detailed), all clothes look like they are made of plastic, faces are waxy (especially middle shots, where they look plain ridiculous) and the background vegetation often looks like green jelly.
849;Great price point for a multi.
850;I checked my equipment to make sure.
851;that said this is a excellent movie.
852;Everything is very well done and fits perfectly.
853;The storyline is a simple one.
854;what starts as a fascinating foray into the re.
855;the film can be best remembered for the incredible special effects, and the amazing recreation of the dinosaurs making for some thrilling soundbites.
856;the real stars, apart from of course the dinosaurs, are Ariana Richards Joseph Mazello who are just naturals as the kids who accompany the scientists, and get just the right balance, as American kids in a fantastically surreal situation.
857;I will recommend to other people too.
858;Interesting subplots and of course, VERY COOL DINOSAURS.
859;This movie was ahead of its time and is still great fun to watch.
860;It has a great story line, along with the 90's special effects.
861;With actors Sam Neill and the beautiful Laura Dern you can't go wrong.
862;Even over a decade after its inital release, this movie is still a thrill to watch.
863;It still has kept its suspense and is still freaky and fun to watch.
864;The visual effects are amazing for the time that this was made.
865;Steven Spielberg is a great director.
866;A lot of the scenes are amazing, especially the cup of water rippling, and the raptor looking in the kitchen window.
867;The best scenes are the T. rex chase and the velociraptors in the building.
868;depth, but enough to keep you interested.
869;The movie draws you in and you feel scared with the characters, and relieved when they finally get off the island.
870;Arguably the best in the series, I really hope they don't kill Jurassic Park with the release of the 4th movie next year.
871;I highly recommend watching this movie, you'll really enjoy it.
872;They have such a realistic view.
873;There is some ghosting on objects in the foreground, but on my theater this movie makes for an unforgettable experience.
874;It is one of the best movies in my collection.
875;One of my favorite movies just got better.
876;I thought it was a very good movie and held my interest throughout.
877;The science may be flawed but it was believable in the context of the movie in my opinion.
878;The same is true if you push the stop button, you have to start the movie over and go through the menus.
879;The picture and sound were pristine.
880;This is a great movie.
881;It got delivered on time and came with everything they said.
882;Steven Speilburg has changed us all.
883;JURASSIC PARK is probably one of the greatest movies of all time and it's the 7th top grossing box.
884;Even their fossil remainments haunt us and awe us with their great sizes and shapes of many assortments.
885;But otherwise than having good visual effects, fun roller coaster plot, and good actors, JURASSIC PARK has a fonominal soundtrack.
886;The themes have that authentic John Williams style with it's exciting and thrilling yet sailient themes.
887;So, its got amazing special effects, fun plot, great cast, and a monumental soundtrack.
888;Definitely has moments where I though it was good I paid attention to the rating.
889;Pretty good graphics for that time period too.
890;Good scary fun if your kids are old enough to sleep it off.
891;It's a classic and I love the extras on classic movies like this.
892;So many more details that went into this film that I knew about.
893;This is pure entertainment at its best.
894;This was one of the greatest movies to come out of 1993.
895;It had action and the special effects were great.
896;If you want a movie you really want to enjoy then this is the movie for you.
897;"When I decided to watch this film with my kids, I thought it would be similar to another story by Michael Crichton, ""Andromeda Strain"" which is one of my favorite films."
898;"The climax of the film is a real ""deus ex machina"" and the heroes are saved by an incredible piece of luck and not really due to their own efforts."
899;The special effects were state of the art in 1993 and they still are today.
900;You will feel you are inside of the Park as you view the herds rushing past you.
901;A pleasure to see again and again.
902;Truly one of the Best Pictures of the Decade.
903;Steven Spielberg's masterpiece is a truly unique story about a paleontologist Allen Grant (Sam Neill) and a Paleobotanist Ellie Satler (Laura Dern) who visits John Hammond's (Richard Attenborough) island filled with Engineered Dinosaurs.
904;Beautiful color and just made an old story gain more life.
905;The special features also are good, you can understand how they were able to convert this so well.
906;"Obviously this movie needs no introduction at this point
I:8589;907;It all started with a book written by Michael Crichton, and whoever said it would make a great movie is now, clearly, a millionaire.
I:8589;908;As you can see it's a very ambitious film.
I:8589;909;The story is very impressive from the perspective of a """"what if"""" scenario."""
910;I think that fact alone makes the movie even more impressive to watch.
911;Also they seriously ramped up the industry of animatronics to produce this film!
912;This was an ingenious move over having computer graphic dinosaurs.
913;The viewer is astounded by the sheer beauty of the creatures and the park throughout the entire film.
914;They developed special grids that are fenced off with high electricity wire.
915;This is where the movie gets really exciting.
916;my favorite character was the paleontologist Alan Grant played by Sam Niell.
917;Granted the third Omen wasn't anything special, but I thought Niell was really good in the film in the end!
918;Many people will enjoy seeing some smaller characters roles show up, such as the one played by Samuel L. Jackson.
919;Sienfeld fans will surely appreciate the appearance of Newman as the character Dennis Nedry who interacts with Sam Jackson a lot and that pairing was simply a great idea!
920;It made those scenes pretty funny.
921;there were a few scenes here and there that were mentally jarring because some parts were just silly and characters probably wouldn't do that in the real world, but the point was to create a suspenseful moment or to move the story along.
922;it made for an intense moment.
923;Either way this movie is superbly filmed and very well written.
924;For those of you that have been living under a rock and don't know what Jurassic Park is about, well it's about a scientist who uses DNA to bring Dinosaurs back to life.
925;The power goes out and the dinosaurs get out of their cages then the fun begins.
926;The special effects in this film still remain as some of the greatest in film history and the story is equally good.
927;Also included are many awesome special features such as the Dinosaur Encyclopedia and Making Of.
928;I personally love knowing more about the dinosaurs depicted in the film.
929;Also when watching Jurassic Park the viewer envies in how much it fun would be to film with robotic dinosaurs on a tropical island, the Making Of feature allows the fan to truly understand what production was like.
930;This film appeals to the die.
931;hard Spielberg fans, Jurassic Park enthusiasts, and children who were not born when the film was available in theaters.
932;This film was one of my favorite childhood movies and will always rank high on my list of greatest movies.
933;with dna cloning a lot closer to reality today than ever, it might be time for a sequal, but please not like number three
934;The film explores the theme of cloning.
935;the film has plenty of action, thrills and chills, but I've heard it's a poor version of the novel.
936;I like Sam Neill's acting, he's been in some good movies.
937;If you are not a picky stickler for logic, this film is good entertainment.
938;For its time it was a great film.
939;good saturday flick for entertaining, takes you out of reality for atleast a while.
940;Even though the movie is old, the audio and video hold up VERY well.
941;This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest adventure/sci.
942;"It was very smart of the makers to cast not ""Huge Stars, but great actors""."
943;The acting is great, and the musical score is great.
944;The film does have great effects, and a very interesting story as well.
945;"In amazon's description, one feature is a ""documentary""."
946;But this is one of the greatest in.
947;depth movie documentaries that I've seen.
948;this movie is nearly perfect in so many aspects.
949;unlike traditional dinosaur movies, its plot is very deep and involved.
950;at first the idea seems very nice, as the entire group, with the addition of Hammond's grandchildren, begin to explore the park, amazed at the wonderful creatures all around them.
951;the rest is now movie history, as this brilliant and often funny thriller plays out.
952;This is a must have for a movie fan.
953;Jurassic Park is one of Spielberg's best films.
954;The computer animation is revolutionary, one of the best examples of this art in history.
955;The plot and the acting are great too, making this an incredibly strong and well.
956;It was almost like seeing it the first time with the enhanced realism.
957;Overall great movie, sequels could do without, not as good as the book but essential to any Blu.
958;Played like brand new and great price.
959;jurassic Park was an awe inspiring visual effects masterpiece when released in 1993.
960;Compared to a lot of other action movies from the 1990s that relied heavily on CG effects, Jurassic Park's effects still stand up fairly well.
961;jurassic Park is rated PG.13 for intense science fiction terror.
962;d it feels like a new adventure again.
963;but it still makes me happy to watch.
964;It is very intense and filled with action.
965;But I''ve always felt this way anyhow.
966;'s Best Director list, are you kidding??
967;Perhaps the best of the trilogy, I wanted a Blu.
968;It haves supense and action to keep you watching.
969;"The final result was an admirable exercise of vivid and unconscious terror respect our antipodes, the recreation of a primitive world
I:8589;970;a splendid cast delineates a kinetic plot with the secure and accurate vision of this unbeatable entertainment 's wizard: Steven Spielberg.
I:8589;971;line is good and the dinosaur scenes are spectacular!
I:8589;972;They are all valid, and they all have some worth.
I:8589;973;The plot is sturdy enough to support this original premise, and the action enables us to watch the slick work without, on occasions, even realising the non.
I:8589;974;then this movie is definitely worth a watch.
I:8589;975;This is one of those movies you want in your collection, you will want to see it over and over again!
I:8589;976;Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:8589;977;Another good example of escapism and total enjoyment for the family.
I:8589;978;One of the greatest movies of all time, it's fun and thrilling.
I:8589;979;We all know that it's a great story.
I:8589;980;d version and i'm extremely satisfied with it.
I:8589;981;d version gives the viewer the perspective of depth that makes the animated dinosaurs and their environment look like you are their in the middle of the action.
I:8589;982;This is definately the best of the series.
I:8589;983;The acting, plot and storyline are top notch and is almost believable.
I:8589;984;sam Neil and Jeff Goldblum are a good plus.
I:8589;985;This is a classic movie that has to be in the Blu Ray Collection!!
I:8589;986;Makes you appreciate an already great movie even more.
I:8589;987;In my opinion a visual piece of art.
I:8589;988;I love this movie and it's been in my collection since it came out.
I:8589;989;Yes the computer generated dinosaurs were well done and were used well with real life actors and sets but the acting put this one over the top.
I:8589;990;*The T. rex is awesome.
I:8589;991;d on our new TV and everyone had a great time.
I:8589;992;Being scared again after a few years was great fun.
I:8589;993;This is great entertainment for the entire family.
I:8589;994;The characters are all well.
I:8589;995;acted, the storylines are engaging, and the effects will stick in your mind for a long time to come.
I:8589;996;The Raptors are Spielberg's finest movie creation since Jaws, and the sets, combined with a first.
I:8589;997;Actually, Spielberg takes B. movies, and transforms them into A. movies.
I:8589;998;It is full of dazzling special effects, yet the human actors stand on their own, with performances that keep your attention.
I:8589;999;The pacing also is excellent, with intense action broken up with character development, some philosophizing, and plenty of humor to make the suspense more effective.
I:8589;1000;one thing that Spielberg effectively does is introduction of characters.
I:8589;1001;This movie is an example of this.
I:8589;1002;The first time a dinosaur is actually seen is very effective, and the same is true with the first appearance of the Tyrannosaurus.
I:8589;1003;realistic (e. g. Star Wars)"
1004;People who read the book first liked the book better, as is often the case with movies based on books.
1005;I saw the movie first, and I realize that there is a difference in the two.
1006;While this point is not absent from the movie, the purpose of the latter was to be a money making exciting blockbuster movie, which it succeeded at.
1007;John Hammond is more likable in the movie than he is in the book.
1008;Some of the changes are to make the picture more enjoyable, and some are probably to keep the people who read the book guessing.
1009;entertained for a couple of hours, this is an excellent way to achieve that goal.
1010;Jurassic Park is one of my all time favorite movies.
1011;Tyrannosaurus Made a Good Addition.
1012;Love love LOVE this movie!
1013;This is by far the best of the series.
1014;arguable because it's one of the best family adventure movie of all time ever.
1015;It comes with a blu.
1016;My daughter watched this for the first time and she loved it.
1017;I remember watching it around her age and enjoying it.
1018;We'll see what they do with Jurassic World.
1019;Steven Speilberg has done it again.
1020;Sam Neil, proabably the best preformance in his career, is a Dinosoaur reseraching, along with his girlfriend.
1021;Very good scenes makes this movie a classic.
1022;d like its the first time seeing it!
1023;and its pretty damn good too.
1024;d is some of the best on blu.
1025;I still enjoy this movie no matter how many times I watch it .
1026;It is always so entertaining.
1027;Steven Spielberg has done it again.
1028;Like it's predecessors Schindler's List and Jaws, Jurassic Park has broken numerous records in film history.
1029;Our storyline is a very simple one: a billionaire creates an amusement park with cloned dinosaurs, he invites several people to come view it, then something happens with the locks that keep the dinosaur cages locked.
1030;Surprising twists and great computer generated special effects for it's year, Jurassic Park is a film you'll want to experience over and over again.
1031;When this movie first came out, I was a kid.
1032;The animatronics are great, the acting is very believable.
1033;Now, 20 years later, it still is awesome!
1034;The concept is great, the story line is believable.
1035;I LOVE this movie still.
1036;This is a good film to test out your speakers and tv system.
1037;It is a great movie.
1038;Good family film that raises some ethical questions about cloning of creatures, that just might become a reality one day.
1039;One of the best dinosaur movie I have ever seen.
1040;A great addition for my movie collection.
1041;loved every minute of watching it again.
1042;Well done throughout, it's a classic and well worth the price .
1043;The sound is the best I've heard (I believe Jurassic Park was the first film to use DTS in theaters).
1044;visually, the movie is also stunning.
1045;The dinosaurs look as I would imagine them, and the transfer to video seems excellent.
1046;This is a great movie.
1047;The movie was great !
1048;i will recommend this movie to some friends and family .
1049;i have seen this movie before, it was better watching it at home thanks !
1050;mania peaked with the movie based on Michael Crichton's novel.
1051;Jurassic Park brings dinosaurs into the present by cloning them from DNA.
1052;all under the direction of Steven Spielberg with special effects beyond compare.
1053;It is still a great movie almost 20 years later.
1054;I think most people have seen Jurassic Park by now, but if not it's a fun movie about dinosaurs that try to eat people.
1055;Item was as listed, perfect.
1056;It was good back then and good now.
1057;Teens and adults will love it.
1058;The surround sound is great as well.
1059;eating dinosaurs, I highly recommend this new version!
1060;This is one film that holds up, even decades after it's initial screening.
1061;The FX work, the plot's exciting.
1062;Just good old fashioned fun and wonder, wrapped up in the best effects of ILM.
1063;Even though it's 25 years old, still a fantastic movie.
1064;The dinosaurs are even more amazing.
1065;Great job at making the dino's look real.
1066;entertainment, fun, action, and a pleasure to watch.
1067;When it was first released it was a stunning visual spectacular with all of the special effects of the time that audiences had not really experienced before.
1068;I really enjoy movies where I don't have to look for a hidden meaning and just enjoy the show.
1069;An important worker in the park has made a previous illegal agreement with another company to smuggle some dinosaur embryos out of the island and he will accomplish it at all costs.
1070;steven Speilberg has overdone it with stunningly detailed dinosaurs and visual effects with the help of Industrial Light and Magic of California.
1071;This is an excellent portrayal of Michael Crichton's best seller.
1072;This first film was above superb!
1073;The reason it held the single grossing record of a 3.
1074;day movie premiere (which WAS the record until Harry Potter came out (.)
1075;, was the kids wanted to see it.
1076;It had great action scenes, but not a thick plot with it.
1077;"the film is about a rich scientist who offer a couple of paleontologist three years more research on there project if they will just come and visit his ""amusement park""."
1078;I am a huge fan of Blu Ray, and I have seen a lot of movies in Blu Ray, And this by far is the best one I have ever seen in Blu Ray, make sure you also have a sound bar or surround sound when watching, you're welcome!
1079;i loved Jurassic Park from the word go.
1080;It lived up to all of my expectations, which is saying a lot.
1081;now, seven years later, Universal is finally offering us fans a chance to own the ultimate edition.
1082;The dinosaurs are still amazing, the story still interesting, and I've already enjoyed this disc three times.
1083;The video transfer is perfect, no lines or dots, and the sound is clear and precise.
1084;minute short of the kind that probably ran on HBO or Showtime, and is informative, especially about one of the movies that birthed the CGI.
1085;It looks and sounds great.
1086;I can remember when it came out on the silver screen with the new.
1087;It's not as interactive watching it on your Kindle or TV screen, but it's still a suspenseful, fast.
1088;paced adventure with lots of humor and pathos and dinosaurs!
1089;He is very interested in this pro.
1090;Born in Ireland and raised in New Zealand, Neill works all the time.
1091;This scientist is interested in both children AND marriage.
1092;Daughter of Bruce Dern and Diane Ladd, she is another professional who has acted all her life.
1093;She looks so young here!
1094;talented actor/producer/director is one of Britain's most honored professionals.
1095;"* Samuel L. Jackson (""The Avengers"") is Ray, one of the tech."
1096;nicians at the theme park.
1097;"After decades of television work, Miss R. has a new movie, ""Battledogs,"" scheduled out this year."
1098;Mr. M. has managed to work a college degree into his busy schedule.
1099;For some reason, that indelible scene has stayed with me all these years.
1100;Spielberg made a memorable movie in 1993 and now, 20 years later, it's fun to visit it again.
1101;But it's great either way!
1102;Be sure you get the remastered edition from Amazon so the soundtrack is clean.
1103;Several have watched it now at my home and all have enjoyed it.
1104;I remember seeing this movie in the movie theater when I was 8.
1105;I love Titanic, but they made things pop more on this set.
1106;Very well done and worth the watch!!!
1107;I've always loved stop motion movies, but the first time we see the dinosaurs in this movie I felt exactly like Sam Neill's character did.
1108;Just an amazing movie that holds up well years later.
1109;It's like they took the normal film and sliced it into 3 parts .
1110;Take my advice and run from this one!
1111;Hands down the greatest movie of all time!
1112;I give this move 5 stars!
1113;Everything about it is top.
1114;They're intelligent, fast, killing machines.
1115;I will definitely rewatch it in the future and recommend it to anyone who loves this movie.
1116;I have yet to watch the 6.
1117;hour documentary, but I look forward to that feature.
1118;This is the almost perfect scarey movie.
1119;Seeing them come back to life was wonderous.
1120;I bought the laserdisc, and I thought that was good.
1121;30 some bucks is expensive but i split it with a friend and worked out well.
1122;Meanwhile, the main characters in the story run into some escaped dinosaurs, such as the amazingly huge T. rex and the pack hunting Raptors.
1123;The T. rex is even badder than I remember it and this is a great way to experience the wildest theme park of all time.
1124;There are two reasons for this:1.)
1125;it always wows people, because they are so familiar with the movie in 2D that it blows their minds to see it in such an eye.
1126;I can't believe how old this movie is and I would still rather watch it than a new movie.
1127;Watch the whole series in order!
1128;The movie kept my in suspense from the moment that t. rex roared on.
1129;Honestly one of the greatest movies of all time that I personally think everyone should have.
1130;And I'm a huge fan of the use of Animatronics and limited CGI.
1131;Love the characters, love the story, and dig that T. rex hardcore.
1132;Pretty good remake of the original.
1133;This movie is great, however the book is a lot better.
1134;Great movie, but please, read the book.
1135;It is still a great movie 20 years later.
1136;I ended up seeing my favorite movie of all time.
1137;The characters were great, and ofcourse the dinosaurs were the made out of the some of the greatest most unbelievably believable special effects ever created.
1138;the T. rex, velociraptors, brachiosaurus', parasaurolophaus', the spitter, triceratops, were all amazing!
1139;The film for me is every bit as good as Spielberg's Jaws and better.
1140;It's a GRAND motion picture with terrifying creatures, aswell as pleasant creatures.
1141;But, frankly after watching it I feel very under impressed.
1142;I think the movie is best viewed in the format which Spielberg originally shot it in.
1143;It's going to be a classic ground breaking fantasy adventure film.
1144;So many classic scenes in this movie.
1145;love watching the scary movies again with the youngsters.
1146;It is full of chills and thrills and prehistoric monsters with attitudes.
1147;It is a must have movie.
1148;The movie does some justice to the book, and should have done a lot more.
1149;The computer effects are so breathtaking that one wants to drop the popcorn and gasp, good goshamighty, those are REAL DINOSAURS!!
1150;But the dinosaurs are a miracle in themselves, and make the movie the ultimate fun ride it is.
1151;when I bought this it was on sale for 19.99 which was a steal.
1152;What more can be said about this brilliantly made film?
1153;Steven Spielberg is a creative genius, and this is the movie to prove it.
1154;Paired with the musical composer John Williams, every single moment of this movie leaves a cherished memory for me!
1155;inspiring size and gracefulness of the Brachiosaurus leaves the visitors to the park spellbound, and movie audiences in amazement.
1156;Actually, some of the dinosaurs were quite beautiful in their own way.
1157;Some were incredibly intelligent, too.
1158;The biggest star of the silver screen, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, is the best villain and best redeemed character of any movie.
1159;ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT cinematography, musical score, book adaptation, and creation of realistic dinosaurs for a hard.
1160;This movie is one of those timeless Hollywood productions.
1161;The special effects are astounding for their time, the story line is good and there is suspenseful drama, along with some humor.
1162;It's a good family movie (if you're kids are over the age of 5).
1163;The movie is a classic.
1164;The depth in the jungle scenes is amazing!
1165;blockbuster about people and the dinosaurs who eat them.
1166;"Laura Dern, easily the best actor in the movie, flounders without a character to play
I:8589;1167;the only reason she's looking at a leaf in the first place is so Spielberg can build suspense by delaying the dinosaur revelation.
I:8589;1168;Think of Jaws, another Spielberg movie about a fangs"
1169;that said, Jurassic Park is fun for casual viewing, and I find it remarkable Spielberg pulled it off at all while also working on Schindler's List.
1170;"kitchen sequence
I:8589;1171;The only thing left is the tremendous technical challenges to make all of these imaginings come to pass.
I:8589;1172;the story presented in this film is interesting and fun to watch.
I:8589;1173;Just as interesting and fascinating in its own right is watching these flights of fancy come to life on the screen.
I:8589;1174;The dinosaur footage is worth the price of admission all by itself.
I:8589;1175;The dinosaurs are the real stars of this show.
I:8589;1176;The excellent performances by all the rest of the cast are just the icing on the cake.
I:8589;1177;This too is worth the admission.
I:8589;1178;Overall, I thought this was a pretty good movie, despite not being as good as the book.
I:8589;1179;Based on Michael Crichton's best.
I:8589;1180;Groundbreaking computer effects make dinosaurs frighteningly real, and once more, Spielberg knows just how to build tension, inch by gut.
I:8589;1181;Whole cast is fine (including Samuel L. Jackson and Wayne Knight in supporting roles), but make no mistake: the dinos are the real stars.
I:8589;1182;Original feature is vastly superior to the two sequels.
I:8589;1183;Jurassic Park , as some poor souls may not know, is a fantastic movie based on a fantastic novel of the same name written by the late Michael Crichton.
I:8589;1184;enough about the story, you'll have to take my word that it's good if you haven't seen the film before.
I:8589;1185;a must have for those who grew up on this movie!
I:8589;1186;Science, from this film's angle, is a form of modern.
I:8589;1187;day magic that destroys all who try to employ it for personal gain.
I:8589;1188;I would have loved to see this film as a child .
I:8589;1189;Fortunately, I was able to watch it with my nine.year.
I:8589;1190;What a great transfer it is!
I:8589;1191;i understand Spielberg was so impressed with the T. rex that he couldn't resist bringing it back for the JP climax.
I:8589;1192;It's groundbreaking, entertaining, funny, scary, like Jaws genetically engineered.
I:8589;1193;Jurassic Park is one of the finest pieces of Sci.
I:8589;1194;I remember seeing it opening day.
I:8589;1195;She has the most kills, the most screen time of all the dinosaurs, and is just fun to watch, especially the classic scene where she saves the humans from the raptors.
I:8589;1196;An adventure 65 million years in the making, Jurassic Park.
I:8589;1197;And even the sound is enhanced beyond the original.
I:8589;1198;We really enjoyed the movie.
I:8589;1199;This brings out the best of our system.
I:8589;1200;Everything about it was great .
I:8589;1201;Liked this movie, even after watching it several times over the years.
I:8589;1202;Watched it with my grandchildren and they loved it.
I:8589;1203;It's interesting nonetheless, and damn if it isn't exciting and amazing.
I:8589;1204;The special effects in this movie are amazing, even today, and the scenes with the T. rex and Raptors are absolutely thrilling, especially the raptor scenes.
I:8589;1205;I love the scene where the two raptors are in the kitchen with the two kids.
I:8589;1206;Definately my favorite scene in the movie.
I:8589;1207;I can appreciate a good, critically acclaimed movie when I want to, but sometimes you just need to sit back and let yourself be thrilled, and endulge yourself in great special effects without having to worry about the symbolic meaning of this, or the meaning of that.
I:8589;1208;And really, the Jurassic Park series so far is one of the best in that category.
I:8589;1209;They cleaned up this movie very well.
I:8589;1210;I watch this movie at least once a day.
I:8589;1211;edge of your seat thirll ride
I:8589;1212;Best movie that was made about dinosaurs and one of the greats of all time.
I:8589;1213;They did not go so much into the wow factor but just gave you a more realistic visual environment.
I:8589;1214;The music and images were great!
I:8589;1215;Here are the required eight more words, people!
I:8589;1216;I found this movie to be very informative in displaying a dinosaur's true anger towards the human race for making them extinct.
I:8589;1217;A few movies I've seen in my short time on earth, I call them movie epics.
I:8589;1218;But the movie that easily surpasses those three films is the epic of all major movie epics, Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park.
I:8589;1219;A brilliant scientist, John Hammond, discovers a process that is able to bring dinosaurs back to life, and succeeds in doing so.
I:8589;1220;And everyone must fight for their lives.
I:8589;1221;jurassic Park is the truest thrill ride you can get out of a movie.
I:8589;1222;The story by Michael Crichton, from beginning to end, is a well thought out and exciting story.
I:8589;1223;The story was initiated very very well by director The acting is brilliant.
I:8589;1224;All performances were right on the mark.
I:8589;1225;The dinosaurs looked so incredibly real.
I:8589;1226;The picture and audio transfers are amazing.
I:8589;1227;There are some nice supplements.
I:8589;1228;There's a behind the scenes deal, and a neat dino encyclopedia complete with sound effects.
I:8589;1229;jurassic Park was absolute fun as a kid, but now, as a 17 year old, I'm able to laugh at the grown up jokes and enjoy the actual piece of cinema from the viewpoints of looking at acting and directing.
I:8589;1230;This movie has held up to time and is still an amazing film.
I:8589;1231;You will have a blast watching this!
I:8589;1232;Family loves it, especially our 3 year old son.
I:8589;1233;the movie itself is awesome!
I:8589;1234;It's a well written and developed action/dinosaur flick.
I:8589;1235;For a movie which came out 20 years ago, the special effects still look quite realistic, and I think I would rate the movie as high had it come out today then as I did when it came out two decades ago.
I:8589;1236;truly one of my all time favorites.
I:8589;1237;It's one of my favorite movies and can go into any part of the movie and be captivated.
I:8589;1238;Its a good movie to watch with your kids, and it make you intense what going to happen next.
I:8589;1239;Out of all of the Jurassic Park movies this one is my favorite.
I:8589;1240;But there is much more to this film.
I:8589;1241;Steven Spielberg's basic ideas are family values, illumination and flight, according to Douglas Brode, author of The Films of Steven Spielberg"
1242;The park's owner invites two scientists to his park, hoping they will endorse it so the park can open.
1243;show, and the Triceratops is ailing.
1244;This film, first released in 1993, still thrills and has the in.your.
1245;(In my opinion, the original film is excellent.
1246;Fun for the whole family.
1247;this is the best movie put out in a long time.
1248;It is an enjoyable movie that you can watch over and over again and not get tired
1249;The movie came in great shape and in a timely manner,I was very happy with gohastings we have already ordered something else!!
1250;The special effects are fantastic.
1251;They may be a little dated in comparison to the more recent Lost World , but as computer generated effects (which are often done poorly in other movies), it sports some of the best.
1252;Jurassic Park contains excellent direction and good acting, escpecially from the children.
1253;The movie also finds a good balance between the suspense and the humor .
1254;With a score by John Williams, Jurassic Park also has some of the greatest music of any movie.
1255;Jurassic Park is one of my favorites.
1256;This movie has adventure, science, genetics, twists, comedy, scary monsters, and a great cast.
1257;This movie was especially important to me because it really piqued my interest in both prehistoric history as well as genetics and world change.
1258;For the technology available at the time, the graphics are extremely well done and believable.
1259;As a dinosaur enthusiast, I have to recommend this film for its spectacular effects and its overall sense of fun and excitement.
1260;I ordered this film from amazon and it was delivered to my home just the other day.
1261;We all love it and cant wait for the others to be remade!
1262;Spielberg simplified movie classic out of the multilevel and more interesting/complicated bestseller from Michael Crichton.
1263;You can't help but enjoy it when the dino's pop out at you.
1264;This has been out for many years and it's still a great movie to watch.
1265;The dinosaurs that come to life are great and give a somewhat accurate picture of what they were like back then.
1266;This movie may not have been Oscar material, but it is a great movie.
1267;I'm a big Sam Neill fan, and his performance as Dr. Alan Grant is wonderful!
1268;Jurassic park on blu ray is amazing!
1269;It brought back all they good memories of my childhood.
1270;This movie was a classic.
1271;Jurassic Park is a Terrific Movie.
1272;The best film I've seen in blue ray yet.
1273;One of the most creative pictures in film making history.
1274;Never have we seen anything like this fantastic film before.
1275;First off, with a great and seemingly plausible story by Michael Crichton, good casting and performances, and absolutely wonderful cutting edge CGI by ILM and the full scale creature effects of Stan Winston this movie will be very hard to ever top.
1276;The work that went into paleontology research, animal motion and design studies for the full scale dino work of Stan Winston made me feel like I now know what actual prehistoric animals look like in action.
1277;most important was the basic story which was one of the best science fiction novels I have ever read.
1278;Hats off to Sam Neill and the entire cast for their great performances.
1279;A movie experience this great only happens a couple of times in a movie goers lifetime.
1280;This movie sets the new gold standard for state of the art CGI and full scale creature effects.
1281;I loved this movie when I saw it three times in theaters as a child.
1282;Now I can enjoy the experience at home with my home theater system and it is just as good as I remembered.
1283;There is some interesting bonus footage.
1284;Spielberg creates some genuinely terrifying momnents in this popcorn thriller about dinosaurs brought back to life and running amok on an island.
1285;As with many Crichton plots, this one is kind of ridiculous if you give it any thought, but it's fun if you like monster movies.
1286;this an oldie and a goodie!
1287;Jurassic Park is a movie legend.
1288;It set a new standard for special effects and suspense.
1289;Excluding the ever boring Jeff Goldblum this film has amazing acting.
1290;The soundtrack is also one of the most famous movie scores of all time.
1291;The scenery, action and drama are all incredible as well.
1292;This movie is a legend.
1293;I love this movie and wanted to test my home theatre system sounded great.
1294;My daughter and I watch the movie every once in a while.
1295;Its theater release was amazingly successful.
1296;It is a Spielberg production to a Michael Crichton novel that is treated with respect.
1297;This is a movie for all to enjoy, except for those who try to find something wrong purposely.
1298;Sir Richard Attenborough has been in acting for quite a while and is perfect as Hammond, the tragic millionaire who's honest intentions prove disastorous (even if it's not totally his fault).
1299;Sam Neill and Laura Dern are totally believable as scientists who find themselves coming to grips with the revelations about their work and why their way of life could be jeopardized.
1300;Jeff Goldblum is immersive as the 'mathmetician' who argues the moralities and possible repercussions of the park.
1301;aside from the great performances, the story is really what makes the movie work.
1302;Michael Crichton sparked a timeless screenplay.
1303;The audience has to care about who's on screen as well as what is.
1304;It's a classic and merits its longevity.
1305;Though primarily famous for its visual effects, this film has a highly active and creative surround soundtrack that should give your 5.1 speakers the most workout they ever got.
1306;Compared to the old laserdisc's Dolby Prologic sound, the DD 5.1 sound (I haven't heard the DTS version) has much clearer and louder dialogs, much stronger and richer surround effects, and much better integration of dialogs, effects, and music, so they sound more cohesive to, and yet distinctive from, one another.
1307;The '95 documentary The Making of Jurassic has been aired on TV countless times, but it does provide a nice recounting of how the visual effects got made.
1308;motion film clip of the kitchen attack scene done by Phil Tippett is very nice, and I wish more such clips were included.
1309;production meeting and a location.
1310;The best supplements, in my opinion, are the storyboard sequences of 5 dinosaur attack scenes, including 2 that were omitted from the film.
1311;Storyboards are an excellent way to show how key shots were constructed and got translated into the finished film.
1312;It would be nice to mention at least what they do and what their advantages are, especially on a disc where DTS and DD are put to such good use.
1313;So make sure you order (and receive) the right copy.
1314;"Perhaps one of the best films ever to grace a big screen, ""Jurassic Park"" is a suspenseful thrill ride that I never tire of watching."
1315;It's hard to believe that this film came out over a decade ago and yet the advances it made in special effects are still influencing films today.
1316;now that you have an idea of what is going on, just know that this is one of the most suspenseful films made in the last twenty years.
1317;It features a wonderful cast headed up by Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum.
1318;Richard Attenborough turns in a wonderful performance as the park's visionary creator and Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello play his very eager grandchildren.
1319;since its creation, I have yet to see a film influence movie.
1320;making as much as this one did.
1321;The action is thrilling and suspenseful and the sound is amazing.
1322;Even the cinematography provides some stunning visuals for the viewer.
1323;highly recommended to ALL fans of cinema.
1324;This one film is one of the best of all time.
1325;"Jurassic Park is good entertainment, but take most of the ""science"" it presents with a grain of salt."
1326;innovative in its presentation of realistic looking dinosaurs, Jurassic Park is the name of a new dinosaur.
1327;It becomes an adventure to see who will escape alive.
1328;The kids, played competently by Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello had some of the best lines.
1329;The movie is best when there are dinosaurs on screen.
1330;see S1m0ne) with her knowledge of UNIX.
1331;screen movie, a behind the scenes documentary, and a few other minimal goodies.
1332;Everything went very smoothly from the moment I ordered to the moment we watched the movie with our son.
1333;It's witty, funny, and action packed.
1334;"The dinosaurs look so real
I:8589;1335;Even their movements looked realistic.
I:8589;1336;I believe it has the best plot and storyline of any of the Jurassic Park movies.
I:8589;1337;This is a great movie even after all this time.
I:8589;1338;This is one of my favorites.
I:8589;1339;It's not too deep, but yet, it's interesting to watch and the special effects are ever so realistic.
I:8589;1340;He loves it and has watched it many times already
I:8589;1341;I enjoyed the original Jurassic Park when I saw it several years ago in a theater.
I:8589;1342;First in the series and the best.
I:8589;1343;I've always loved this movie, and I was delaying purchasing a new version of the movie until one of the two remaining vhs tapes broke, but those old tapes just won't budge.
I:8589;1344;So when they started to get fuzzy and got that little line through the middle of the screen, I bought a new one here.
I:8589;1345;i fell in love with it all over again.
I:8589;1346;This movie was the reason I pursued a Biology career, and while I might not have the privilege of cloning dinosaurs, this is an exceptionally enjoyable film.
I:8589;1347;This is my favorite movie of all time.
I:8589;1348;Combined with Spielberg's fresh and ingenious plot and script, along with the wonderful acting (and/or scream antics:)) of Sam Neill and Laura Dern (the main characters, Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler), and the incredible CGI techniques for the dinosaurs, this movie comes alive with realistic settings and edge.
I:8589;1349;I guarantee that it'll be worth all the money!
I:8589;1350;Loved the original and like this even better.
I:8589;1351;Spielberg's dinosaur adventure Jurassic Park is up there with the all.
I:8589;1352;Taken from Michael Crichton's thrilling novel, Jurassic Park is one of the most entertaining and exciting films ever made.
I:8589;1353;The seamless combination of CGI and robotic creatures creates some truly terrifying action set.
I:8589;1354;despite what some critics thought when the film was released, I feel that all the principal actors give good performances, especially Sam Neill as Alan Grant and Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm.
I:8589;1355;But admittedly, the special effects are the main attraction, and Winston's dinosaurs (which won him another Oscar after Terminator 2) are truly frightening.
I:8589;1356;rate, with superb picture and sound.
I:8589;1357;The special features are exceptional, with a 50 minute 'making of' of the film and trailers for Jurassic Park, the Lost World and the teaser for Jurassic Park 3.
I:8589;1358;production meetings with Spielberg and the FX team discussing how certain shots and effects should be done.
I:8589;1359;A 5 star film, 5 star extras.
I:8589;1360;until the T. rex gets free in the park!This movie is funny exiting and fun!
I:8589;1361;This movie is a classic.
I:8589;1362;It would have been nice had there been more extras, but the movie itself is always a winner.
I:8589;1363;Jurassic Park is an action packed movie starring Sam Neill as Alan Grant and Laura Dern as Ellie Sattler.
I:8589;1364;He decides to steal some embryos to sell elsewhere.
I:8589;1365;Quite a bit of action goes on here!
I:8589;1366;I recommend it to anyone whom loves action/adventure films.
I:8589;1367;creating this Steven Spielburg was very smart with it.
I:8589;1368;Its still a fun fun movie with just more atcha moments.
I:8589;1369;ray looks and sounds fantastic.
I:8589;1370;I was totally thrilled watching and listening and feeling this movie on my big plasma and excellent sound system!
I:8589;1371;Not bragging, but this movie is meant to be enjoyed with these type of components.
I:8589;1372;It was a brand new adventure for the adults as well as the children.
I:8589;1373;The first one is the best!
I:8589;1374;My son's favorite dinosaur action and adventure movie of all time!
I:8589;1375;this movie is one of my all time favorites.
I:8589;1376;the special effects had never been tried before and the end result was a sheer masterpiece.
I:8589;1377;i've always been a fan of dinosaurs, ever since i was a little kid, and i've never seen them captured with such beauty and magnificence as they are in this movie.
I:8589;1378;although it doesn't follow the book, it was a great adaptation.
I:8589;1379;I love Jurassic Park the movie.
I:8589;1380;For me it is worth to have it in all formats.
I:8589;1381;and the blu ray is even better, sound, picture, it is great!
I:8589;1382;The soundscape is beautifully used and the 7.1 environment really immerses you into the sounds of the island.
I:8589;1383;ray and it was in excellent condition.
I:8589;1384;It played very good, and I am well pleased with it .
I:8589;1385;This has always been one of my favorite if not my favorite movie of all time.
I:8589;1386;I adore dinosaurus, and this film portrays them greatly, although of course there are faults, the Velociraptors in here are portrayed much larger than their actual real size(6ft long, 3ft tall, and around 40 to 60lbs)Speilberg made them larger to make them look more impressive, mission accomplished I have to say.
I:8589;1387;This movie starts out with a very ominous filling to it and ends with a great scene(my favorite part of the whole film).
I:8589;1388;Sam Neil(Alan Grant)is a fantastic actor and did great.
I:8589;1389;Richard Attenbourough(forgive my spelling) once again shows off his fantastic acting skills here.
I:8589;1390;However it's the dinosaurs who really steal the show, and if you haven't seen it you will be awe struck with the majesty and power in which Speilberg portrays these awesome creatures.
I:8589;1391;Tyrannosaurus Rex has always been and will always be my favorite dinosaur of all time.
I:8589;1392;The power in which he brings to the screen is incredible, his awesome power and massive presence is astounding.
I:8589;1393;The Velociraptors are what really brings the fear to the movie, this is a movie however that can only be expierienced by viewing it for your self.
I:8589;1394;The ending remains my favorite part to this day and I never get tired of it.
I:8589;1395;Seeing you favorite dinosaur you love so much truly makes your stomach tingle and fills you with a great amount of pride.
I:8589;1396;A few of the characters were switched around, but I was so impressed with the adaptation.
I:8589;1397;Sam Neil is my favorite.
I:8589;1398;Richard Attenborough is a little too cute and nice, but I liked his white clothing, the hat, and the amber cane.
I:8589;1399;Wayne Knight was incredible as Nedry, the slob.
I:8589;1400;He's as likeable as ever, though somewhat the villain.
I:8589;1401;Jeff Goldblum fit the description of Ian Malcom from Crichton's novel well.
I:8589;1402;And of course, in the novel and film, Malcolm was right.
I:8589;1403;I've always thought it explained the process very well for something that is complicated (though I found Mr. Hammond's live speaking lines to be unrealistic.
I:8589;1404;I only liked her because of her excellent music choice.
I:8589;1405;Is a very good experience, for share with the family and friends.
I:8589;1406;This is a welcome addition to our movie collection.
I:8589;1407;They made the 20 yr old, ahead of it's time, special effects look even more realistic.
I:8589;1408;I have loved this movie since I was a little kid, so I'm a fan.
I:8589;1409;I loved the original movie and they did a great job remastering it.
I:8589;1410;but to the show, It had very good pacing and intensity, some of the characters were carried off very well (Wayne Knight's Dennis was excellent).
I:8589;1411;The action was very exciting and the concept (as with most Chrichton novels) was very compelling.
I:8589;1412;This is absolutely, without a doubt, the most beautiful cover art ever released for Jurassic Park, and I own EVERY edition ever released.
I:8589;1413;I was blown away by how beautiful this was upon opening my box.
I:8589;1414;The dinos even jump in your face!
I:8589;1415;even if you have this movie in 2D, go see it again!
I:8589;1416;This is my favorite Steven Speilberg film.
I:8589;1417;It has great acting, special effects, characters, and story.
I:8589;1418;I recommend this movie to anyone!
I:8589;1419;most of the movies I own look terrific in 480p.
I:8589;1420;The special effects in this movie make it the equivalent of a ride at Universal Studios.
I:8589;1421;As it turns out, greed on the part of one of the characters helps in the escape of the critters, including the highly intelligent, carnivorous and agile raptors.
I:8589;1422;This movie is about the special effects and the chase.
I:8589;1423;this movie is great entertainment.
I:8589;1424;It is a thrill ride and you do not examine thrill rides too deeply"
1425;Five stars for special effects that were phenomenal when this movie was first released.
1426;I love love love this movie:) it is my all time go to movie.
1427;like and right in front of me on the screen.
1428;"the energy of the film was adventurous and who can forget Jeff Goldblums best line ""at least when the ride breaks down the Prates don't eat the guests."""
1429;The kids were charming and right on the money with their reactions.
1430;visually the film is eye candy.
1431;Even Sir Richard Attenburough gives a stellar performance.
1432;The interviews with Spielberg, the cast and crew are very interesting.
1433;The mechanical items and the CGI (Computer Generated Images) and their renderings are incredible.
1434;Still great after all these years.
1435;still laugh at the guy in the bathroom getting eaten.
1436;I bought it so I can watch it whenever I want.
1437;My favorite scene is when Neil sees his first living dinosaur and grabs Derrn's head to see it.
1438;I also love the John Williams theme music.
1439;"This was my son's favorite movies when he was little
I:8589;1440;What makes it really rock is the bonus footage, including a couple of very well.
I:8589;1441;filmed and informative episodes on the making of Jurassic Park.
I:8589;1442;I had almost as much fun watching these documentaries as I did the feature movie itself.
I:8589;1443;savvy thriller from Steven Speilberg doesn't follow its source novel to the letter, but it's just as fun to watch this movie as it is to read the (very good) book.
I:8589;1444;This is an immensely fun movie, and is just as deserving to be called a classic as Speilberg's Jaws and E. t.
I:8589;1445;The special effects are still incredible.
I:8589;1446;All the important stuff they got right.
I:8589;1447;Speilberg is a master behind the camera, and Jurassic Park proves why.
I:8589;1448;I've had this game for a few months now, and I'm addicted!
I:8589;1449;I love leveling up my dinos and decorating my park.
I:8589;1450;Anyways, this game is addictive, fun, and the best part, it's free!
I:8589;1451;I loved watching this with my kids over 20 years later, still a classic!
I:8589;1452;I just saw the movie again for the first time since it came out, and I have to say it still holds up very well from the standpoint of the special effects and animation.
I:8589;1453;the dinosaurs are realistically rendered, and movement is very fluid and realistic also.
I:8589;1454;But overall this is still an impressive movie from the standpoint of the special effects.
I:8589;1455;But I have always liked actor Sam Neill and this might be his most famous role as the enthusiastic and intrepid dinosaur expert.
I:8589;1456;And Mr. Attenborough is always good in whatever he does.
I:8589;1457;overall still a great adventure classic that still holds up well today.
I:8589;1458;But it's a beautiful and visually appealing movie about a war between a peaceful race and warlike humans who attack their planet.
I:8589;1459;even technically difficult lighting effects such as simple and complex reflection and refraction such as specular highlights are rendered realistically, which many world.
I:8589;1460;so if you're into CGI stuff I can recommend this movie also.
I:8589;1461;Watched it the minute I got it, even though I've seen the movie many times.
I:8589;1462;I've always loved the subject of dinosaurs .
I:8589;1463;anything by him is fun to watch.
I:8589;1464;The animatronics are so real .
I:8589;1465;But now, it's big fun .
I:8589;1466;The effects are superb, the plot very entertaining, and it (in my opinion) is better than the book in many parts.
I:8589;1467;This is one of my favorite Spielberg movies.
I:8589;1468;Aside from the great special effects(even 7 years later) and excellent score, the movie is still very suspensful and imaginative.
I:8589;1469;I think this is fair but I find that Jurrassic Park has far more interesting characters and is a more enjoyable film.
I:8589;1470;Hey, I liked the book.
I:8589;1471;I would love to see the scenes that hit the floor.
I:8589;1472;I would love to see an interactive product that is as much fun as The Lost World website was .
I:8589;1473;I'll be honest, this is my favorite movie ever.
I:8589;1474;Awesome fx, to say the very least.
I:8589;1475;I read the novel, and although there are many scenes from the novel I wish had been put in the movie, I still loved this movie.
I:8589;1476;I mean it had a good plot with strong, well developed characters.
I:8589;1477;I definately recommend this movie to everyone.
I:8589;1478;But luckily ILM decided to push it and blew the world away.
I:8589;1479;I dont think the first ten times I saw it I knew what the plot was, I didnt care because it just was so amazing to see.
I:8589;1480;But now the fun is wearing off, lets hope number 4 does it right.
I:8589;1481;For those who have seen J. p. and have big expectations for these movie, hold on a little bit and yo'll enjoy it very much.
I:8589;1482;For those who just want to see a good action/family movie, its an excellent choice.
I:8589;1483;this is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8589;1484;I watch it all the time.
I:8589;1485;will love this movie always
I:8589;1486;This movie has everything that I love .
I:8589;1487;great special effects, believable creatures, straightforward characters, and an interesting storyline.
I:8589;1488;This is one of just a handful of movies that are better than the book.
I:8589;1489;This movie is appropriate for anyone, from pre.
I:8589;1490;There are some pretty scary scenes in this movie and they are very realistic.
I:8589;1491;Give your little kids a break and watch something a lot milder with them, to keep their young minds innocent.
I:8589;1492;I highly recommend this movie.
I:8589;1493;the main focus of this movie is Dinosaurs Trying to Kill People .
I:8589;1494;John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has come up with the most incredible idea for a theme park yet.
I:8589;1495;He has found a way to clone dinosaurs.
I:8589;1496;the three are admittedly impressed by what they see, especially Alan and Ellie.
I:8589;1497;Will any of them make it off the island alive?This movie was one of the first to use computer effects, and it revolutionized the industry.
I:8589;1498;Frankly, these effects still hold up even today.
I:8589;1499;There's lots of talking in the first hour.
I:8589;1500;Once the dinosaurs get loose, the movie kicks into high gear and becomes an edge of your seat thrill ride.
I:8589;1501;despite the weaknesses in the story, this is still a well deserved classic.
I:8589;1502;If you haven't seen it, you're in for a heart pumping thrill ride.
I:8589;1503;Loved this movie when it was first released.
I:8589;1504;Very nice remake in 3.
I:8589;1505;d, this movie comes alive even if it is the 5th time watching, the special effects make it seem real!
I:8589;1506;The cast performed amazingly and the effects just add to the tension.
I:8589;1507;This is the most incredible movie I have seen in a long time.
I:8589;1508;The graphics are incredible and the story line intriguing!
I:8589;1509;The kids watch the whole trilogy all the time.
I:8589;1510;law woke from a dream suddenly a few years ago, startling my brother awake as well.
I:8589;1511;We all shared a good laugh when they shared that story.
I:8589;1512;historic mosquitos is used to clone a forest full of very impressively real.
I:8589;1513;the scene where Neill and Dern first come upon a scene from millions of years ago enacted before their very eyes captures us with it's awesome dino display.
I:8589;1514;This movie gets better and better everytime I see it.
I:8589;1515;The film paves the way for future summer blockbusters introducing the movie going audiences with state of the art sound and special effects.
I:8589;1516;Steven Spielberg is a genius, and this film will be remembered for a long time!
I:8589;1517;Jurassic Park is undoubtedly the best movie to come out of Hollywood.
I:8589;1518;the thing that makes JP the most special is that fact that Steven Spielberg Originaly was going to use robotics for the entire film.
I:8589;1519;They moved pretty well for robots, but even Spielberg himself stated that they were """"too jerky""""."""
1520;animated scene of a T. rex chasing some gallimimus.
1521;The movements were so smooth, so real, he decided that computers were the thing to use.
1522;jP simply blows you away with the special.
1523;It's incredible the technology we have.
1524;after seeing Jurassic Park (for the 900th time) I can say with confidence that it is the best movie ever.
1525;Jurassic Park is Steven Spielberg at his finest
1526;I love this and share the experience with friends and family if they have not seen it when they come over.
1527;I saw this when it first came out and thought it was wonderful.
1528;I love the part when Lex and Tim were in the kitchen, the computer technology used was breathtakeing.
1529;Really enjoy the Full Screen version.
1530;Excellent edge of your chair excitement, and the recreation of the dinosaurs was awesome.
1531;everyone has seen this movie by now.
1532;but I still enjoy watching it again.
1533;The film which is based on one of Michael Crichton's great books.
1534;Alan Grant is played by the great Sam Neill, Ellie Sattler is played Laura Dern, Richard Attenburg plays the owner of Jurassic Park, and Ian Malcolm is played by Jeff Goldblum.
1535;Critically acclaimed by critics and people who have seen this great film.
1536;This film is a work of Speilburgian genius in his earlier films such as E. t. and Gremlins.
1537;When it came out, this was the epitome of the action movie, boasting amazing visuals, a fascinating and almost.
1538;believable plot device, and creative editing that gave an interesting spin to action sequences, as when a car, suspended in a tree, drives down the tree in a freefall.
1539;Also the CGI has been touched up well!
1540;The green screen work for the shots inside the helicopter however, are hilarious.
1541;steven Spielberg has made a cinematic masterpiece with this movie.
1542;Industrial Light and Magic did a great job creating the prehistoric creatures.
1543;The movie is shot so well.
1544;Spielberg is a master story teller and he sets everything up well.
1545;The movie uses so many things to make it good.
1546;There is action, suspense, comedey, and just enough seriousness to make you think.
1547;jeff Goldblum as Ian Macolm to me had the best performance of all the actors in the film.
1548;Very few people in Hollywood can reach the level of weirdness that Goldblum can achieve on screen and he has another one of a kind performance in Jurrassic Park.
1549;all the other actors are solid all the way across.
1550;It's solid all the way around with stars like Neil, Dern, Samuel L. Jackson, and Goldblum.
1551;Goldblum has the best performance, but the others don't disappoint.
1552;the music is great in Jurrasic Park.
1553;Once again John Williams has shown us why he's the man in one of the best movies ever scored.
1554;If you like to see why Williams is the best just watch the movie and see how his score makes the movie so much better.
1555;this is a fantastic movie.
1556;At one time it was the most successful movie in box office history and it's easy to see why.
1557;It's a cinematic masterpiece that should be enjoyed by all.
1558;Bought this as a present for my Nephew.
1559;He loved is as did I growing up when I first seen it.
1560;Ok, Jurassic Park is one of my all time favorite movies to date.
1561;The acting is superb and is filled with great action and some hilarious dialogue.
1562;It is basically just telling you that there is actually a JP3 which several people already know.
1563;The depth is incredible and makes you feel that you are there.
1564;There's also many scenes that have objects that pop out of the screen and into your living room.
1565;The combination of picture and sound is awesome.
1566;All in all, well done and a stellar conversion.
1567;For its time, this movie was and still is brilliant.
1568;Entertaining story, many heart stopping action moments and very good graphics.
1569;A classic movie and a must have for any movie collector.
1570;Jurrasic Park is a modern classic, not great, but fun.
1571;Steven Spielberg masterfully conveyed primeval terror in his 1993 mega.
1572;Fortunetly, I read the Michael Crichton's novel in anticipation of seeing the movie.
1573;a masterfully told story of mankind's *real* terror: human greed.
1574;I've never read the book (I really should, one of these days) and I really enjoyed this movie.
1575;The premise is very creative, and the premise and special effects made this truly a memorable film, especially the T. rex and the raptors.
1576;part of this movie could be considered horror given the scary scenes where the dinosaurs chase people, but it is also a very good piece of sci.
1577;This is a classic movie with lots of action and great special effects even after so many years since it was released.
1578;But I had high hopes for this re.
1579;It was fabulous for the time and even looking back at it now still is.
1580;Loved it then, and love it still now!
1581;this is a great movie.
1582;it is a must see for the whole family.
1583;It still is a thriller.
1584;Having viewed the movie a great number of times, I feel compelled to argue against this point of view.
1585;True, the dinosaurs do steal the show, but the value of the other elements is almost as evident and praiseworthy.
1586;First of all, Michael Crichton and David Koepp's script does magic in limiting the book (which is significantly longer) to an hour and a half of footage that maintains a convincing story line.
1587;paced action scenes that live up to the movie's thriller nature.
1588;Thirdly, extraordinary camerawork, overall construction of the set and creation of a truly breathtaking atmosphere contribute to a re.
1589;creating of the past in the present with astounding results.
1590;And finally, great performances by Sam Neill (who is perfect as a conventional scientist whose views are shaken), Richard Attenborough (in a triumphant return to the big screen as a genetics tycoon whose dreams end up shattered by disater), and especially an unforgettable Jeff Goldblum (as a sarcastical, good.
1591;it is this immense success that makes Jurassic Park one of the great movies of the 1990s and one to be viewed by generations to come.
1592;Jurrasic Park is a classic movie.
1593;If you go back in time to 1993 and remember the awe you felt when you first saw the spectacular effects that brought us real.
1594;looking dinosaurs, you can see why JURASSIC PARK remains a marvelous film.
1595;Although CGI has come a long way since then, you can't deny the wonder of seeing those larger than life creatures come to life in Spielberg's classic fashion.
1596;"While the storyline isn't as strong as some of Spielberg's other movies, it's still a terrific roller coaster ride of stunning action and terror scenes
I:8589;1597;They're all still as much fun as when I saw this one thirteen years ago.
I:8589;1598;What makes the movie work so well is Spielberg's patented gift of looking at the world through child's eyes, seeing the wonder of the dinosaurs and not realizing just what the results would be.
I:8589;1599;The movie has a great cast: Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Knight, and an early role for Samuel L. Jackson, but it's the dinosaurs who own and motivate this film.
I:8589;1600;Sound is good as well, A must have for any Blu.
I:8589;1601;Blue ray version is much better.
I:8589;1602;It's a great movie, a classic, nothing beats this movie!
I:8589;1603;I've loved it since the day it came out in theaters
I:8589;1604;and that pretty much sums up one of the greatest movies ever to grace the silver screen.
I:8589;1605;There are also a few trailers.
I:8589;1606;Jurassic Park , Always a great film to watch.
I:8589;1607;showed to my ten year old son for the first time, he thought it was great.
I:8589;1608;It's very similar to """"Godzilla: Size Does Matter,"""" which itself is a great movie."""
1609;If you liked that, you'll like this one.
1610;Excellent movie on a stormy evening.
1611;Excellent movie, definitely a classic.
1612;This edition looks great and is packed with extra features.
1613;We have enjoyed adding this on to our collection.
1614;I really wanted to watch this movie.
1615;At the end of the movie, I loved it!
1616;I hope you love it as much as I do and don't be scared!
1617;I enjoyed the movie as a teenager when it came out, wanted my kids to experience it too.
1618;JURASSIC PARK is the story of four adults and two children who embark on an unforgettable adventure, by taking a tour through John Hammond's (Richard Attenborough) mysterious park.
1619;JURASSIC PARK featuring real life dinosaurs!
1620;meaning all the dinosaurs are free to come and go as they please!
1621;After the people are caught in a big storm, and the cars stop rolling, the dinosaurs start hunting!
1622;Watch out for one of the biggest blockbusters that took imagination further than ever.
1623;JURASSIC PARK is one of the greatest movies ever made!
1624;The dinosaurs are so real in this film!
1625;The acting is perfect, the story couldn't be better, the directing is superb.
1626;the movie is just a major classic that will live on forever!
1627;It surprises me that anyone hasn't seen this movie yet, but if you haven't, you are really missing out on an amazing movie!
1628;I wanted to watch this at the movies again as I love this movie.
1629;Growing up I was a dinosaur freak and I still love them, and this movie brought them to life for me.
1630;i recommend this movie to everyone.
1631;It was just as thrilling to me as when I watched it when it first came out!
1632;When a tree breaks apart, splinters fly in your face.
1633;the sound is amazing too.
1634;it's really like watching the movie for the first time again.
1635;Ever since 1st grade(I'm almost 34 now)I've loved these beasties.
1636;down, grab a bucket of popcorn, eye.
1637;Oh, the Tyrannosaur scene is still the best movie monster scene ever!
1638;For a thrilling action adventure movie for all ages you can't get much better than this original Steven Spielberg classic.
1639;For one of the first times, dinosaurs look real.
1640;The opening sequence will definitely get your attention and once everyone reaches the island, the suspense is sustained.
1641;millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has created a theme park on an island near Costa Rica unlike any other.
1642;I got the item in a timely manner and it came as advertised.
1643;I've always loved this movie!
1644;Some day they will watch it!
1645;Super fast shipping and it is perfect!
1646;I saw this many many years ago but I wanted my 13 year old son to experience it.
1647;He has seen Avator, Hobbit, Iron Man but he still was entertained and captivated by this movie.
1648;This is a movie I especially wanted on Blu Ray because of the picture and sound.
1649;The video is vivid, with beautiful colors and details.
1650;Given the age of the film, however (doesn't seem like it was that long ago but I guess it was), it is very good.
1651;d for the first time it was a whole new experience!
1652;{ in a good way! }
1653;Jurassic Park is action packed fast paced and very entertaining!
1654;Steven Spielberg has made the dinosaurs belivable.
1655;You feel like your actually in the movie running away from them with the humans!
1656;I love Jurassic Park and I would highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in dinosaurs or someone who is a fan of movie monsters!
1657;Just as awesome as when I first saw it!We loved it and so did our daughter!
1658;In 1993, the year that Steven Spielberg received the Best Director Oscar for Schindler's List, Steven Speilberg made another classic that would goon to have two more sequels: Jurassic Park.
1659;Jurrasic Park is a great thriller about several scientists who find D. n. a and use it to create dinosaurs.
1660;Jurassic Park has amazing special effects and an all star cast including Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Samuel L. Jackson.
1661;It's defintetely a classic and is much better than its two sequels.
1662;Jurassic Park remains at #2 of my top five favorite films of all time.
1663;Everything about it is just amazing and magical.
1664;The cast also fit their roles perfectly!Direction: You would expect the direction of a movie thats directed by Steven Spielberg to be creative and original and well.
1665;it is, the direction of Spielberg adds originality as well as tension and chills to the already magical and thrilling as well as frightning scenes.
1666;I would say Jurassic Park and it's first seqeul have the best CGI/Ani to date, the dinosaurs are just so realistic and look so real that you wish you were inside this theme park ride.
1667;this film contians some of the most memorable scenes of all time which include SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER: When Tim and Lex Murphy(Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards) are trapped in the kitchen and are being stalked by Velociraptors, the scene is ultimatley chilling as well as magical and jaw dropping.
1668;Another scene is the Tyrannosaurus Rex's first appearence in which it attacks and overturns the explorer car that Tim and Lex are inside of, the whole scene is magical and terrifying.
1669;The film is great from a very chilling scene to one of the best climaxes I've seen from a movie!
1670;magnificent, and ear pounding, one of the best movie scores of all time!
1671;You have to see this film!
1672;Jurassic Park is perhaps my favorite film of all time.
1673;the picture clarity and sound are restored very well.
1674;That first scene where the score hits and you see the brachiosaurus in all it's glory I still cracked a smile.
1675;Jungle scenes and the dinosaurs look great.
1676;On playing it through my 7.1 surround set up it seemed very dynamic and much more active in the surrounds.
1677;Whilst obviously comparable to Spielberg's other big monster movie, 'Jaws', this is still excellent in its right.
1678;Even several years on, the sight of the T. rex clawing its way past metal fencing remains spectacular.
1679;basically this is a rollercoaster ride and little else but for what it is, 'Jurassic Park' is great fun.
1680;Most impressively though, it remains pretty scary.
1681;One particularly well constructed scene has two kids hiding out in a kitchen which is being stalked by two vicious raptors.
1682;the acting, as in many movies like this, is incidental.
1683;Neill plays a pretty flat main character, Dern excels as a feisty archaeologist, the kids are good value, Goldblum is fun whilst Attenborough doesn't appear to do anything.
1684;Most importantly though 'Jurassic Park' grips from the very beginning and will keep you on the edge of your seat.
1685;, but it's definitely thrill.
1686;It is full screen, which I enjoy since it gives me a larger picture.
1687;I am very pleased with it and enjoy watching it.
1688;Jurassic Park has got to be one of the greatest movies of all time.
1689;The directing, animatronics, acting, graphics, and casting were perfect in this movie.
1690;It is a theme park with real dinosaurs.
1691;The main four go on a tour with Hammond's grandkids.
1692;Nedry steals the embryos, pulls the power and runs off.
1693;action, drama, and comedy all rolled into one, great movie, I could watch it again and again.
1694;I was surprised at how much my Biology students were interested in watching this movie following our DNA unit!
1695;Take this one out for a spin and enjoy the ride!
1696;The DTS version really rocks.
1697;There's room for many genres of film, and this one is a great for what it is.
1698;The acting is fine, the soundtrack is great, the cinematography is fantastic, and the computer graphics are as good as it gets.
1699;Watch this one when you want to escape reality and enjoy the rush of great action.
1700;Relax a bit, Amazon reviewers, and enjoy the action side of Spielberg.
1701;but I watch this one for escapist cinema!
1702;Jurassic park is a story of how dinosaurs are brought back to life and a park is open to house these dinosaurs.
1703;This show is very nice.
1704;Refreshing story plot and many beautiful sceneries.
1705;One of the first realistic dinosaur movies I've seen when it first came out.
1706;The kids loved the movie and want to see Jurassic Park II.
1707;Santa brought our 4 year old son (and dinosaur lover) this movie for Christmas.
1708;It's just as awesome as I remember it!
1709;The service was excellent and I would gladly do business with them again.
1710;Great movie was when it came out and still is we enjoy it every time we watch it, so you enjoy it too
1711;they loved the movie and I loved watching it with them
1712;Another instant classic from Steven Spielberg, this spectacular translation of Michael Crichton's famous novel entertains with constant, enduring bouts of excitement and a full plate of terrorizing sequences as memorable as they are awe.
1713;A forewarning of the possible cataclysmic effects of meddling with biology and genetics, Jurassic Park exercises one of the most engaging, smartly.
1714;simple, yet beyond the realm of most peoples' imaginations.
1715;Spielberg's use of special effects (in particular, animatronics) is absolutely perfect.
1716;the dinosaurs are more realistic than anything similar that anyone's ever seen.
1717;This film's cast is pleasant and applicable, and its sound effects rival its visuals, making it one of the most technically flawless films of all time.
1718;Anyway if you like adventure films, your in for a treat.
1719;Great special effects, good story line and the acting was first rate.
1720;Some people say sequels are usually not as good as the original, but I my opinion, all 3 are excellent.
1721;The plot is crystal clear and it's a sure thriller!!
1722;I love it a lot.
1723;Jurassic Park is a classic film, hands down.
1724;my kids liked the movie.
1725;This is very good family movie.
1726;I am very satisfied with the movie.
1727;This is hands down my favorite Steven Spielberg movie!
1728;I received my order in wonderful condition and it plays beautifully.
1729;For anyone who is a big fan of the first Jurassic Park film and not too crazy about the sequels, I highly recommend the collector's edition because it has a lot of extra content.
1730;Because let's be honest here.
1731;Jurassic Park is the best and there is no arguing otherwise.
1732;in today's day in age, seeing a film in 3.
1733;I remember seeing the original release in theatres so my expectations set the bar quite high.
1734;The lights dimmed and I watched it in my well.
1735;This is the real deal!
1736;Steven Spielberg is one of those painstakingly careful directors that has a mind and an eye for depth, detail and vision which only helped the film in this case.
1737;It breathes new life into the lush, exotic sets and adds a whole new level of thrills to the action that's culminating on screen.
1738;I really appreciated Spielberg's selectiveness on which scenes to present in 3.
1739;d. the initial dino reveal, the T. rex escape, the Jeep chase, the Gallimimus herd, and raptor kitchen scene (among others).
1740;they were all appropriately chosen and the new depth of field really added to the sense of wonder, awe and danger we as an audience felt.
1741;It's a happy surprise to see that 3.
1742;The added layers intensified my viewing experience to the max and allowed me to feel the same sense of imagination and wonder as the first time I saw it on the big screen.
1743;The attention to detail and careful conversion process gives new meaning to movie magic and helps to create a heightened sense of depth and added drama.
1744;This movie was a vision that was expertly executed and is beyond worthy.
1745;It's even enough to justify the few extra dollars on the hefty price of admission.
1746;This is absolutely the best film of its kind.
1747;This is one of my favorite movies to watch.
1748;An amusement park ride from hell.
1749;What will make this a Classic is the ground.
1750;Ranked as the thirteenth highest grossing film worldwide on all time, Jurassic Park is another Spielberg masterpiece!
1751;Shared this with my son.
1752;After 20 years, the story and special effects still had him on the edge of his seat.
1753;this movie blends the dinosaurs with REALITY to great effect.
1754;This classic Stephen Spielburg movie was a hit with the kids.
1755;This movie has held up pretty well from when I was a kid.
1756;watched it with my kids and they thought it was pretty cool
1757;The blue ray makes this movie much better to watch.
1758;I got the single movie rather than the set because the other two movies blow, and still raise the cost 20 bucks.
1759;grown kids loved this movie when they were young and so did we!
1760;vitalized a classic family thriller.
1761;While there is not a lot of extras they take it that extra step so the special features is also 3.
1762;This is, quite frankly, the greatest dinosaur movie of all time.
1763;Will recommend to others for sure.
1764;This movie is always great.
1765;Plain and simply a movie masterpiece.
1766;Even now as an adult I am still impressed by this movie.
1767;We ordered the movie to watch with our children.
1768;Would not recommend until new one is available.
1769;Good, old fashioned exciting movie.
1770;Good acting, beautiful scenery, and a lot of scary excitement.
1771;The movie is good also.
1772;"Steven Spielberg's box office hit ""Jurassic Park"" is good enough to rival ""Jaws"" (well, maybe not)."
1773;The story is a very original one, even thought Michael Crichton thought it up.
1774;Richard Attenborough owns and finances a huge island amusement park.
1775;Because it's populated with cloned dinosaurs!Sam Neill is perfect in the role of Dr. Grant, the dinosaur.
1776;loving scientist who, along with his assistant/girlfriend, is invited to review the Park.
1777;Jeff Goldblum provides comic relief as a mathematician who is invited also for reasons unknown.
1778;animated special effects are AWESOME!
1779;spielberg has done it again!
1780;He has created a modern classic!
1781;Kudos go to Goldblum, who really makes this film memorable.
1782;The effects are a bit dated and the film plods at times, but overall a fun and enjoyable way to pass a few hours.
1783;I watched a new TV dino movie the other night and Jurassic Park FX, from 20 years ago, blew it away.
1784;Jurassic park is a creative, enjoyable, and intelligent, and thought provoking.
1785;Plus, my 8 year old daughter LOVES it!
1786;I bought this edition a few years ago.
1787;Spielberg did a great job on this one.
1788;Twenty years on and this movie is still exciting.
1789;Our 9 year old sons have been wanting to see it so we finally caved.
1790;fo me, it was fun to watch it again.
1791;Yes I really do go back to 50 cent movies with double features and cartoons and news plus collections for fighting polio.
1792;Some are good, some are great and this falls in the latter category.
1793;If you get this one hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
1794;The kids love it as much as I do.
1795;Throw in Dickie's grandkids, Bob Peck (Slipstream) as a big game hunter, and a nerdy insurance/accountant type and you've got plenty of fodder for the real stars of the movie .
1796;It's a terrific rollercoaster ride of a film that all the family (except the smallest maybe) can hold hands together to watch.
1797;especially since it's taken Spielberg long enough to approve the release, and maybe throw in some trailers in the Universal showcase or recommendations sections, and this should be one memorable monster movie release!
1798;This is the best movie ever in history!!!!!!!
1799;I saw this movie in 2000 and immediatly it became my favorite movie of all time!
1800;You Rock outloud Steven Spielberg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1801;My grandson is nine and this was the first time he saw it, just loved it.
1802;Nowadays It's all done with CGI.
1803;What more can be said?Well, I'll tell you.
1804;They made a new master (after six months).
1805;I liked it, but that was mostly because it was a PG.13.
1806;After reading it (it was a excellent book, by the way), I wanted to see the movie again to see what changes it had in it.
1807;this movie is probably one of the most chilling movies that I have ever seen.
1808;The special effects still remain amazing (nine years later), they still fully explained the plot (which is brilliant), and is just plain very good.
1809;That is a rare thing in movies, they ussauly pause for a long time in between each little three minute thrill seen.
1810;Such a classic and so well done!
1811;A perfect rainy day movie for the entire family.
1812;Arrived on time and was packaged well.
1813;What Spielberg did was take a bunch of second rate actors (except Richard Attenborough), so the real stars are the Dinosaurs.
1814;Really action packed like Jaws, heart pounding, scary, with a touch of dark humor (Man eaten on toilet).
1815;Perfect blend of all emotions.
1816;I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end.
1817;It is Fresh and Scary, as it was in 1993.
1818;He does a great job of making these dinosaus beautiful and terrifying at the same time.
1819;But even though it doesn't follow the book, it is still one heck of a movie.
1820;Great service and a nail biting show to boot.
1821;It's for pure fun, and it preforms that use almost flawlessly.
1822;I loved the first Jurassic Park the best.
1823;It kept moving and was intense.
1824;The depth of field made you feel you were there.
1825;I actually applauded when the film was over.
1826;i'm going to watch it again!
1827;Not the best but it's still enjoyable to watch.
1828;Jurassic Park is a timeless classic, no question.
1829;but either way, it's a solid presentation with ground shaking audio and a delight of a film to watch.
1830;like dinosaurs roaming across the screen was a visual and technological marvel.
1831;Watching the T. Rex storm across the screen is mesmerizing and the Raptors are among the scariest screen villains ever.
1832;Stephen Spielberg is the master at this genre and he deftly guides through the suspense and tension of the film until its dramatic climax.
1833;Great action adventure that can appeal to everyone?
1834;substantial dialog that makes the characters interesting?
1835;great character development that makes us care about them as they fall further and further into danger?
1836;time is slowly outdating the science in this science fiction adventure, but the graphics and action are brilliantly done and very realistic, keeping the realism at the essence of the suspense still gripping.
1837;It also contains some of the best performances ever put into a summer blockbuster.
1838;Everything as large as a brachiosaurus and small as a little hand gesture are finely crafted by everyone involved into perfection.
1839;We had a blast watching this as a family.
1840;I may have had more fun watching my kids scream and get freaked out by the suspense than I did watching the show, but when I was watching, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
1841;ray release of JURASSIC PARK (probably my favorite movie of all.
1842;time) has a great new transfer.
1843;Glad the U. s. finally got a great release of this classic film!
1844;Great connection of DNA science and fantasy.
1845;Spielberg's Jurassic Park still stands on it's own as being a great film, nearly 20 years later after the film was first released.
1846;While there has been tons and tons of movies that have used CGI and CGI has been commonplace everywhere, Spielberg's film still has the emotional power to stir and move like a legendary filmmaker should.
1847;We all know that Spielberg's Jurassic Park is terrific entertainment, with thrills and chills on every corner.
1848;But it also manages to be quite a powerful cautionary tale, doing something that films like Frankenstein still haven't been quite able to master.
1849;Now how exactly can a film that made close to a billion and was a franchise starter and marketing powerhouse do that?This is why.
1850;Michael Crichton book has more detail, science, and more ideological intelligence, but Spielberg's film has what Crichton's novel doesn't have: emotional intelligence to make his own viewpoints through behavior come across in a much more convincing way.
1851;Some people call this shallowness, but in my opinion, being able to paint the experience and emotional content of a complex emotional experience is not shallow, and Jurassic Park's scenes of consequence and danger are able do so, with kaleidoscopic emotion andThe initial T. rex scene, one of the most famous of them all, is a good example of this.
1852;Spielberg directs the scene with danger, and the Dinosaur is absolutely primal, stripped down to it's instincts at dangerous cost.
1853;It's one reason why this is a valuable and piece of science.
1854;fiction, and why it's very much essential as much as other great films.
1855;understandably, this is still a large budget thriller, with more thrills and chills than a roller coaster, but it's damn good one at that, made with talent and passion by Spielberg and company.
1856;There are some underwhelming moments here and there, but some of these are overpowered by Spielberg's awesome visuals, spectacular sound design, and humanistic acting.
1857;But it's the sound of these creatures that works.
1858;I also think the production design is great as well, for what that's worth.
1859;John Williams score is also amazing and uplifting.
1860;the character development is a little thin, but I think this is easily transcend with good performances.
1861;Spielberg has a knack for being able to make his characters seem very real (no matter what other people try to convince me.
1862;moment, but instead some subtly that shows Alan Grant's very realistic alleviation to his dislike of all children after finally opening his mind (or forced to, for a better word).
1863;It's not too deep because characters are second, but it's got enough pathos to move you.
1864;But the movie, for me, is better because it's just more convincing, and simply showing the is much more riveting and makes you think about the consequences of tinkering much more, simply because Spielberg.
1865;On top of that, it has enough heart stopping moments to give, so that certainly doesn't hurt either.
1866;Whatever you do though, see this one for it's relevance and artistic intentions within one of the most well known pieces of entertainment.
1867;Story and affects hold up well.
1868;Will definitely be watching more movies this way.
1869;I would recommend it to all my friends and family.
1870;since then, my tastes have, I trust, matured somewhat.
1871;So I was extremely pleased when I watched Jurassic Park recently to see that the story and characters that I had accepted so easily as a kid still stood up.
1872;"And, yes, I was pretty thrilled to see that these dinosaurs from 1993 looked more believable and ""real"" than anything I have ever seen in film since ."
1873;Jurassic Park is a theme park created by the aforementioned Mr. Hammond, on which he's created live dinosaurs.
1874;As to who lives and who dies, well, you'll have to watch the movie to find that out .
1875;and I highly recommend that you do!
1876;Jurassic Park is a classic movie for suspense/thrillers and Sci.
1877;a good time all around, good story, good acting and good fun.
1878;This movie got me hooked onto dinosaurs ever since I was very young.
1879;the special effects don't look as amazing compared to when it first came out, but it still looks very realistic.
1880;"the acting is great
I:8589;1881;The second half is where stuff hits the fan.
I:8589;1882;the soundtrack is astounding"
1883;the direction Steven Spielberg took near perfectly matches the tone of the original book.
1884;Not too corny or too serious, Spielberg does a fantastic job directing this movie.
1885;what I love most about this movie is the magic it brings to us.
1886;A fourth film has been announced for release next year, so I trust Spielberg to bring us the magic we got back in '93.
1887;Although it is getting old and the graphics are not up to today's standards, it is still a great movie.
1888;"I offer as Exhibit A
I:8589;1889;This is one terrific movie that captivates our attention with its creation of the realistic image of modern.
I:8589;1890;day dinosaurs while, at the same time, captivating us further with a thrilling tale of suspenseful adventure.
I:8589;1891;The acting is terrific as well as the writing, cinematography, directing, editing, and, of course, the special effects.
I:8589;1892;Some may scoff at this or that aspect but I was wrapped up in the whole experience by the time it finally ended.
I:8589;1893;It's worth staying up past 11PM to watch.
I:8589;1894;Thought it might be a disappointing effort, but I am quite pleased with the results.
I:8589;1895;Movie sound was awesome and the plot was the best I've seen in many years.
I:8589;1896;I would definitely recommend this movie to all.
I:8589;1897;Very good adaptation of the book which I read in one setting (out loud to my wife who is blind) .
I:8589;1898;The storyline was (and still is) captivating.
I:8589;1899;Each of the actors contributed to the feel of the movie in their own way, adding their unique personality and perspective on the events happening around them.
I:8589;1900;Using Amazon streaming, this came across clear and vivid, with no issues.
I:8589;1901;Love this movie and, for being so old, the graphics are great!
I:8589;1902;It's been years since I've taken the time to watch the original movie, but from what I remembered it was a great movie from my younger days.
I:8589;1903;that's why I bought it.
I:8589;1904;So much fun watching this classic with our nine year old son.
I:8589;1905;The animatronics are still amazing after all these years.
I:8589;1906;We were very impressed with the job they did turning this into a 3.
I:8589;1907;They breathed new life into this classic movie!
I:8589;1908;I love this movie and man does watching it take me back.
I:8589;1909;The acting is awesome but lets not kid ourselves here the real top star of the film is the T. rex and they do a good job with the T. rex especially for being so old it is hard to tell its not real (the CGI parts).
I:8589;1910;I love this film its a classic favorite of mine that is always a pleasure to watch.
I:8589;1911;All the actors play their characters to perfection, the two scientists who are awestruck to see the things they dig up and day dream about are alive in front of them.
I:8589;1912;The acting is great you can almost feel the tension and stress in the air at points.
I:8589;1913;The mix of awe and terror is perfectly done leaving the viewer really happy with watching it.5/5 stars for this classic, it is a nail biting thrill ride that i would recommend to anyone!
I:8589;1914;This film has to be one of the greatest movies ever created, I have never seen a film that could top this one.
I:8589;1915;fi, fantasy, action, adventure, thrills, chills, suspense, comedy.
I:8589;1916;Speilburg was deffinetly the perfect choice for director.
I:8589;1917;And it was made in 1993!
I:8589;1918;The acting is good at all times, it never falls behind, and the characters are well developed.
I:8589;1919;I read the book after seeing the movie, I thought it was amazing too!
I:8589;1920;So in conclusion, this movie is amazing, there is absolutely no reason not to see it, even kids can see it (because its PG.13, in fact i saw it as a kid).
I:8589;1921;THe one movie I will rember forever for sure.
I:8589;1922;He put these monsters from a bygone era on the screen for all to see, and the unique thing about it was that they were real"
1923;And in doing so he touched the imaginations of every child who sat there in the dark of a theater and watched his creations come to life, and he touched the child that still resides within every adult who came to see his show as well.
1924;"To borrow a line from one of his own characters, he ""Spared no expense,"" and simply made one of the most exciting and memorable films in the history of the Silver Screen."
1925;"Spielberg pulled out all the stops to make this remarkable film, and it goes without saying that the special F/X are incredible
I:8589;1926;It's a supporting role into which he immersed himself to create one of the more memorable characters in the film, and his performance.
I:8589;1927;with the countenance and attitude he lends to Malcolm, even the commanding, mesmerizing way he speaks.
I:8589;1928;has never received the attention it so richly deserved.
I:8589;1929;He's such a gifted performer that he makes you forget he's acting"
1930;The result of using all of the magic available, and using it wisely.
1931;"The wonderful thing about a movie like ""Jurassic Park"" is that, not only will it forever remain as a testimonial to a filmmaker of genius and vision, but that it will be there for all the generations that follow to discover anew."
1932;The world may change drastically around us, even from one day to the next, but as long as even a single spark of imagination survives, one thing will always remain constant: The fascination by children of all ages for these legendary beasts that once ruled the earth.
1933;This is the legacy, and the true magic of the movies.
1934;One of the best Spielberg movies of all time!
1935;But the audio was still good and I will probably watch this one again and again instead of the original and the Blu.
1936;In most cases I bought the BD for the extras.
1937;some small personal history: very small, I promise.
1938;I remember being tiny, staring up at these immense creatures, falling in love.
1939;That, and the paras by the lake, showed me real, believable dinosaurs for the first time, and it was an overwhelming experience, really the fulfillment of a lifelong desire: to see dinos alive, muscled, in the flesh.
1940;I'd watch the beloved Brach, rapt with wonder and delight, utterly identified with Dr. Grant.
1941;My kids, amused and patient, would watch me staring at the screen with tears in my eyes.
1942;It was that powerful a reunion.
1943;It's very much like being in the theatre again that first time, taken beyond myself by the brilliant work of ILM and Spielberg, showing me something I'd wanted to see all my life.
1944;I shelled out and got this Blu.
1945;Made perfect sense to me!
1946;Classic movie worth adding to your collection.
1947;The first movie is the best of the three part series.
1948;The remake is true to the theatre experience .
1949;a thrill ride, especially the point.
1950;view with a T Rex chasing you, or high up in a tree rapidly falling as limbs are breaking underneath you.
1951;i definitely recommend this film to anyone liking the genre and thrills.
1952;Steven Spielberg's movie till stands tall 20 years after its release.
1953;clean and nice for all ages.
1954;was fun for the entire family to view again.
1955;This is a spectacular movie!
1956;Comparing this movie to a novel is unfair to the director and to all that worked on the film.
1957;Cinematically this movie will hold up for decades.
1958;Spielbergs' directorial penache exudes through every frame of this film.
1959;This is a great entertaining ride through a fantastical world of make believe.
1960;Great for friday movie nights and other such entertaining destractions.
1961;Personally I love this movie and find it entertaining to this day.
1962;We have seen this movie in the past I don't know how many times, but 3 D is the best.
1963;We did enjoy this very classic movie though.
1964;This is one of the best films of the 1990's.
1965;Great cast, great story and fantastic dinosaurs.
1966;So the big question is: does it substantially add to the viewing experience of one of the most beloved blockbusters of all time?
1967;It opens it up immensely and it brings you into the proximity with the T. rex that you dived under your seat to avoid in the theater not to mention the Raptors (shudder).
1968;It's like seeing the movie again for the first time and refortifies Spielberg's genius for the big canvas.
1969;This is undeniably one of the best movies of all time.
1970;As soon as/if JP4 comes out, I'm going straight to the theatre!
1971;Tons of special features, and the menu is greatly designed.
1972;Five stars, very well earned!!!
1973;This is one of the greatest movies i ever seem.
1974;dinossaurs are such interesting creatures, and this is the best DINO movie ever.
1975;the story is amazing and the special effects are unbeliavable for the time Jurassic was made.
1976;such a great movie, i think everyone in the world should see this classic!!
1977;The exceptional blockbuster set box.
1978;office records and remains one of the most popular FX films of all time.
1979;Acclaimed director Steven Spielberg is still a master of landmark filmmaking.
1980;"selling novel by Michael Crichton, ""Jurassic Park"" is an astounding edge."
1981;fi adventure contains an engaging well structured storyline, strong performances and breathtaking thrills.
1982;Its remarkable visual effects set new standards in CGI effects technology.
1983;This dazzling blockbuster is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format.
1984;The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is impressive with aggressive surround effects for an exciting home theater experience.
1985;The sense of depth rivals Avatar and Hugo.
1986;As a bonus, the sound is much improved over the original blu.
1987;In this 1993 film re.
1988;The visual effects used to portray the dinosaurs were revolutionary at the time, and are still awe.
1989;If you want the kids to see how excitement at the movies was generated two decades ago, take them to see Jurassic Park.
1990;And, as we all know, the story line is super, even though the excape scenes are a little over the top and non.
1991;My 9 year old daughter and I enjoyed every minute
1992;contends that it is a very good movie for showing off your system.
1993;ok folks this is the most outstanding mind blowing movie ever created!
1994;the story is a winner .
1995;actor is excellent as grant .
1996;so is goldblum and attenborough.
1997;the film is flawless and the dinos are too real!the lost world wasnt half as good as this masterpiece.
1998;part 3 will hopefully bring neill and dern back.
1999;speiberg has created the most spellbinding film ever.
2000;even though the dinos are not in every scene the film still is completely involving.
2001;i have the original poster above my bed also.
2002;i actually cried at the end because the film was soo beautiful.
2003;john williams's score is breathtaking.
2004;This movie is approaching classic status.
2005;A classic favorite for sure.
2006;My grandson loves it just like his dad did.
2007;Seeing it again many years later still was very enjoyable.
2008;My grandchildren especially liked it.
2009;The special effects were superb.
2010;But Spielberg did not want to answer angry letters from soccer moms and other sensitive Americans from the midwest, so he kept the movie enjoyable for the whole family.
2011;overall it was an entertaining movie.
2012;I would recommend seeing it.
2013;What a great movie, they just don't make em like this anymore.
2014;Let me tell you it is really hard to keep them it one place long enough to watch a movie, Jurassic park is a classic film one that I hope my children will one day share with children of their own.
2015;I loved this movie when it first came out in theaters.
2016;They did a wonderful conversion on this film.
2017;The awe and wonder is abruptly replaced by terror and a fight for survival after the park's security system is sabotaged, granting the resurrected behemoths free run of the island!Director Spielberg is at his creative best in this tour de force of suspense, acutely blending action, thrills, awe and humor.
2018;Equal to the challenge is composer John Williams with an appropriately rousing and kinetic score that sounds something like Stravinsky on melodic steroids!Expert direction, superb performances (Richard Attenborough is particularly effective as the eccentric billionaire entrepreneur, John Hammond) and breathtaking, unprecedented visual effects (the ILM computer generated dinosaurs are completely convincing!)
2019;"Along with the action and fun, ""Jurassic Park"" also raises some serious questions about the ethics of advanced science and cloning."
2020;"perhaps Steven Spielberg's best adventure film, ""Jurassic Park"" truly is a cinematic masterpiece and one of my five favorite films of all time!"
2021;First three to five minutes has sparkles in the picture.
2022;Yet the terrors are great fun, and, though over.
2023;top with a typical Spielberg flourish, deliver in spades.
2024;He was right, of course.
2025;some excellent examples are when their climbing down the tree while the vehicle crashes towards them and the climbing over the fence scene which looks like you're actually there looking up at a tall fence and into the seemingly endless sky.
2026;Words probably can't do it justice and I'm also doubly impressed because the visual hold up very well for a 20 year old film.
2027;This movie is a classic adventure of the century.
2028;The special features are a blast too!
2029;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
2030;I remember watching it as a kid and now get to share it with my family.
2031;Considering how long ago this film was made it still stands as on of the best.
2032;The casting is excellent in every role.
2033;John Williams' score adds to the grandeur of seeing dinosaurs in the wild.
2034;Jurassic Park is simply stated as the best movie of the 1990's.
2035;An amazing movie for it's time and still fun to watch.
2036;It came quick which is always a good thing.
2037;It is definately one of my favorite sci.
2038;This film is true cinamatic magic.
2039;The plot as well as the script is wonderful.
2040;All the acting is wonderful.
2041;See this movie before you die.
2042;I deeply reccomend this film.
2043;Still one on my favorite movies.
2044;John Williams is a master of movie music, the music in this film is great.
2045;and she was on the edge of her seat the whole time.
2046;This is the best dinosaur movie ever!My family love, love loves Jurassic Park!
2047;I thought this movie was spectacular.
2048;So much technology was put into this movie as well.
2049;This movie is great no matter what format
2050;This 'oldie' is always fun to watch.
2051;IMO the best Dino flick ever made!!
2052;The velociraptors steal the show everytime!!!
2053;Watching brought back memories of the excitement of being younger when we saw this movie for thefirst time.
2054;Plus it was fun to share that with our kids.
2055;watching their eyes widen with excitement &anticipation.
2056;This movie is a coassic!
2057;Felt like a new movie again and looked spectacular.
2058;I'm sure the sequels are more sophisticated with updated technology, but I loved this one.
2059;and the story was very good.
2060;My sons and I really like this movie.
2061;The dinosaurs are intense and really make you think about what they really are.
2062;The excitement and drama have you sitting on your seat.
2063;I love the raptors the most!
2064;A must see for anyone.
2065;It'll scare you, make you laugh, and make you actually think.
2066;Yes, this is a great movie!!
2067;It was a gift so I was slightly irked but it turned out fine.
2068;The movie is in great condition.
2069;Iam happy to say glad I bought it from amazon.
2070;well worth a few hours to watch.
2071;a fun flick to watch.
2072;I remember seeing this film when it was first released in the theaters a few years ago.
2073;they did an incredible job of converting it.
2074;This was always one of my favorite movies.
2075;This is an amazing version of a modern classic and it's probably the best version you're ever going to find.
2076;Spielberg's Jurassic Park was for the most part a revolutionary film, mixing the then.
2077;new CGI with traditional model effects to bring us dinosaurs.
2078;Still, it won the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction film for a reason.You know the plot: a rich philanthropist, John Hammond, has found that cloning dinosaurs is a reality and decides to introduce the world to this phenomena by making a park that will entertain the rich masses to his little island.
2079;this was nature's power and she decided to have the dinosaurs up for extinction and yet Man brought them back is looking for trouble .
2080;animation techniques and meld them with traditional model techniques was fascinating, as well as an interview with Spielberg and what was going through is mind in shooting this film.
2081;His excitement and interest over the project was fascinating.
2082;A director's enthusiasm often translates to the crew and cast and this was evident in the film.
2083;Still, well worth watchingOther Spielberg Films of Interest:Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition)Jurassic Park TrilogyE.
2084;Several members of the party are killed whilst the rest manage to escape after some scary adventures.
2085;I found it on Amazon for a great price.
2086;It was one of her favorite Christmas presents.
2087;This is the best movie ever!
2088;I first saw it when I was eight years old and it scared the bejezzus out of me, but I saw it later and enjoyed it so much.
2089;It has a great message that preaces against modern science and greedy corporations, especially the ones in the life sciences.
2090;like, and I commend the puppeteers on their excellent work.
2091;The acting is also really great.
2092;This IS a great movie and I give it five stars.
2093;This was a gold box special that let us get a Blu.
2094;The effects are amazing, suspense is professionally done, the dinosaurs a virtually real, a corker!!
2095;I liked this movie because the acting is well done, and the dinosaurs look sooooo real you wouldn't believe!!!
2096;but apart from that, a fantastic movie, worth the watch!!!
2097;This is a fun movie and the blue ray captures the action well.
2098;I appreciate that they give you all the digital copies so it is easy to watch this movie anywhere.
2099;The depth looks great and the picture looked very clean.
2100;I had to keep reminding myself this movie is 20 years old because it just looks that good.
2101;Walk with the giant and small dinos as you enter Jurassic Park experiencing it in a new way.
2102;For those who love the old originals of King Kong, Mighty Joe Young,and Godzilla this one is for you.
2103;This is a great movie to sit down and watch with the kids.
2104;It arrived in perfect condition and well packaged.
2105;Worked fine and the kids enjoyed the show!
2106;Everyone knows this is a great movie.
2107;close items are a little fuzzy, they did a good job with the depth of this film.
2108;Amazing how much we forget after a few years from seeing a movie.
2109;Just as enjoyable as the first time!
2110;a stellar cast and crew help make this film one of the best of all time.
2111;this film is all about action and thats just what it delivers.
2112;what a wild ride, as spielberg shows just how good a moviemaker he actually is.
2113;spielberg also made other superb films most notably jaws, close encounters of the third kind, and the new a. i. artificial intelligence.
2114;this one has thriller written all over it.
2115;My son is 9 and watched this for the first time a month ago and just loved it!
2116;I am glad I got to share it with him.
2117;This picture is awesome in Blu.
2118;The movie has a great cast.
2119;Jurassic Park is one of the best Crichton film adaptations thus far.
2120;the animatronics and computer technology used to bring the film's dinosaurs to life have aged remarkably well, and the action sequences remain as gripping as ever.
2121;this is one of my favorite films and it was certainly a crowd pleaser when it was released in 1993.
2122;Spielberg keeps the introductions relatively brief and once the action starts, it continues pretty much unabated until the closing credits.
2123;but the film is so enjoyable that one hardly notices them.
2124;dimensional characters are nevertheless filled out nicely by the cast, with Wayne Knight in a great performance as Dennis Nedry and Sam L. Jackson adding his trademark, smoke enveloped cool.
2125;This movie was a good movie I wanted my grandson to see it .
2126;He thought it was okay he wanted to see it before thinking of seeing the new 3.
2127;No, it isn't Citizen Kane, but when you want to have fun, Spielberg knows how to deliver the goods.
2128;the DTS sound is better than ever.
2129;you are going to have a real good time.
2130;Anyone who knows this classic dinosaur movie will love this!!!
2131;the character develpoment is a problem , yet the overall experiance is quite entertaining.
2132;the movie was still good, unlike the second which had a little girl kill a V. raptor with gymnastics.
2133;Classic movie and looks beautiful on Blu.
2134;I remembered it from my childhood, but forgot the details :( I'd say better for older children/pre.
2135;Although a classic, this movie is still cool (in my 40 something mind).
2136;I remember seeing it in a drive thru for the first time.
2137;its still jurrasic park just more in your face.
2138;I liked that it was blu.
2139;Spielberg's work was superb and I wouldn't want to see someone try to remake it and offer up some edgy wannabe.
2140;But I am of the personal opinion that it is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.
2141;Spielberg, state of the art special effects, a great John Williams score and dinosaurs!!!
2142;The film Jurassic Park is an excellent movie that portrays the apprehension that the public feels towards biotechnology and cloning.
2143;the unethical behavior depicted in the movie has a major impact on public perception of the biotechnology and cloning.
2144;Wow the picture wipes the floor away with the 2D version.
2145;The image is razor sharp with no waxy faces.
2146;"Annoyingly cute kids, dottie old eccentric billionaire grandpaps, dependable scientists, entropy
I:8589;2147;But it's Spielberg, so it must be good, right?
I:8589;2148;Looks and sounds great though.
I:8589;2149;This is the best of the Jurassic Park movies.
I:8589;2150;There is much excitement and scary parts to this movie to make it enjoyable.
I:8589;2151;This film is one of Steven Spielberg's finest creations.
I:8589;2152;The pure awe and magic of this film has stood the test of time for me, personally.
I:8589;2153;Even now, the magic of this amazing piece of art holds a deep place in my heart.
I:8589;2154;You see living, breathing creatures, just as real as the actors.
I:8589;2155;this wonderful piece of nostalgia, 65 million years in the making, has the heart, humor and excitement of the perfect weekend watch.
I:8589;2156;If you love the works of Steven Spielberg or love dinosaurs, this is the perfect watch.
I:8589;2157;This movie has a great plot and great action.
I:8589;2158;I can remember seeing this movie in the theater.
I:8589;2159;I had already read the book, but I was still squirming and jumping in my seat.
I:8589;2160;When I was a kid, I watched """"Jaws"""" with my family."""
2161;Stephen Spielberg created the ultimate thrill ride when he made this movie.
2162;In my opinion, almost everything about the film is perfect.
2163;Many people have said the plot was weak, but if you compare it to a lot of other blockbusters gracing the screen today it holds up pretty well.
2164;The special effects also hold up perfectly, especially when you compare it to Spielberg's recent film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (now those were bad effects).
2165;The dinosaurs still look pretty realistic.
2166;My favorite thing about Jurassic Park is the suspense throughout the movie.
2167;well, you know what happens.
2168;Though other sequels followed, to me there will be nothing better than the first one: Welcome to Jurassic Park!
2169;"But good enough to give you ""brain pictures"" when you re."
2170;I love the movie so much!
2171;Great timing just when i needed it!
2172;I recomend this to any sci fi loving person!
2173;it's a classic movie for all ages for all audiences in my opinion.
2174;I keep watching it over and over again.
2175;Jurassic park is a classic.
2176;My family really enjoyed it, and it got my kids really interested in dinosaurs.
2177;It reminds me of seeing it in the theater.
2178;Ya got to love it!
2179;Great movie, the best of all of em :) Enjoy!
2180;Great classic well done in 3 d not cheesy at all great sound as well I wish the other 2 were on 3 d as well
2181;I found it and bought it at once and my younger son is now totally addicted to this movie.
2182;theater (well I do actually like popcorn movies).
2183;"I was very impressed with the visual transfer
I:8589;2184;Old and excessively well off man creates the ultimate theme park on a far away island where the attractions are real live dinosaurs.
I:8589;2185;Amazing special effects that bring the dinos to life and some good performances (especially from Goldblum) but unlike GREMLINS, the violence in this movie is way over the top.
I:8589;2186;The chaos theory scene gives some of the surprise away.
I:8589;2187;People who liked this movie should see CARNOSAUR.
I:8589;2188;highly recommend adjusting Contrast and Brightness accordingly!)
I:8589;2189;that should be lots of fun!
I:8589;2190;Amazon, thanks for a great discounted price for pre.
I:8589;2191;like ability to craft a film when cute kids show up on the set.
I:8589;2192;michael Crichton's original novel is a brilliant, well.
I:8589;2193;the best scene in the movie was also the most exciting chapter in the book: the first time we see the T. rex tearing its way out of its pen and rampaging against the guests.
I:8589;2194;the special effects were the real stars of this movie.
I:8589;2195;As far as entertainment film, delightful in all ways.
I:8589;2196;I loved this movie as a kid.
I:8589;2197;This is a great movie in the sci.
I:8589;2198;Loved it as a kid and it is still awesome even today.
I:8589;2199;Great movie for those that can only watch things that could be real as the story is plausible and is entertaining due to a good story line as well.
I:8589;2200;Lets face it, Congo and Sphere just both bombed one after the other, but Jurrasic Park sure showed what you can do with a great author's story when you combine it with a great director.
I:8589;2201;There is one difference with his park, or should I say, there is a big difference with his park.
I:8589;2202;the park tour goes smoothly, if not for some sick triceratops and some no shows at some exhibits, but when a storm comes, and a park employee decides to cash in on the embryos with the Dino's DNA, thats when the movie gets really interesting.
I:8589;2203;A lot a mayhem, and a especially scary scene when the T. rex gets out makes this a super chiller.
I:8589;2204;Also look for the incredible special effects, both terrifying and aw.
I:8589;2205;inspiring, add all those things up and you have yourself a great movie.
I:8589;2206;Jurassic PArk is a great movie and this Collectors Edition does not let it down.
I:8589;2207;This movie has everything a bit of romance, some scary bits and all adventure.
I:8589;2208;i would recommend it to anyone.
I:8589;2209;just wish Michael Crichton was still alive making more fantastic stories like this one.
I:8589;2210;I saw this movie many years ago when it first came out and enjoyed it then.
I:8589;2211;I just watched it again recently with my 9 year old son and we both enjoyed it!
I:8589;2212;it would be nice if the dinosaurs would have come out of the screen more but other than that I thought it was very well done and I hope they will remaster some other earlier movies this way.
I:8589;2213;The transfer, detail, and sound are wonderful.
I:8589;2214;I think my cats are moving out for good!
I:8589;2215;This is great, relatively inexpensive way to acquire this ground.
I:8589;2216;Land Before Time was a commercial success.
I:8589;2217;After the film, everyone in the theater stood up and applauded.
I:8589;2218;Speilberg did his best to follow as closely to the book as possible, as well clean it up a bit so the whole family could enjoy it.
I:8589;2219;I mean Speilberg is a director of family films.
I:8589;2220;It is his trademark and style.
I:8589;2221;West World sounds interesting to see.
I:8589;2222;Chrichton has a style and trademark that he has perfected.
I:8589;2223;I believe it is important for all artists to have their own style and originality.
I:8589;2224;It makes them unique and special.
I:8589;2225;cracking, smart alec, moral chaotician, an isolated child.
I:8589;2226;hating paleontologist, a passionate, observant paleobotomist, a self.
I:8589;2227;The movie had the qualities of a classic film"
2228;Steven Speilberg's Jurassic Park, is a classic example of the power of movie's to use special effects to generate money .
2229;And the special effects are dazzlingly realist, the dinosaurs are alive and superb, and the action sequences are tense.
2230;The story, by M. Crichton, was well thought out and impressive.
2231;The plot is a good one mixed with many horror.
2232;movie type scenes as well as Speilberg's off the cuff sense of humor.
2233;The screenplay lacked many of the important issues brought up in the book such as the dinosaur's escape from the island and the international effect of the prehistoric creatures on the world.
2234;it was such an interesting idea.
2235;I will admit, Jurassic Park is a great video to watch with the sound system way up, the lights off, and a big screen TV at the ready.
2236;The dinosaurs are quite stunning, and seem almost alive.
2237;All in all, if you want a story full of awesome special effects and not much else, watch the movie.
2238;If you want to read a suspenseful and well written story that combines thrill with science (and learn a bit about the chaos theroy at the same time), read the book.
2239;Very clean clear picture and sound.
2240;Totally enjoyable and immersive experience.
2241;Well worth adding to a collection.
2242;Oh well, the most brilliant people in the country flock to Jurassic Park to be the first to walk through the park.
2243;Little Timmy is smarter than the adults.
2244;Alan Grant doesn't like children, I can see why.
2245;Ian Malcolm talks funny and he looks like my friend.
2246;What really made the movie work were the young actress picked to play Lex (the beautiful Ariana Richards) and the music written By John Williams, which paced the ariel and dinosaur sequences nicely.
2247;My youngest son and I love these series, do had to get them in Blu.
2248;ray, Will be watched many times!
2249;This product comes from Italy, but I assure you everything is in English.
2250;And the shipping cost and transit time were both very respectable.
2251;love this movie, love the soundtrack.
2252;The story is engrossing and the acting is first rate.
2253;The young actors did a great job.
2254;Everything is believable and fantastic at the same time.
2255;"never other than a film maker basically guarantee the ""wow"" effect every time."
2256;its a scarey thought really.
2257;well, this movie shows what could happen.
2258;People are getting eaten, animals are getting eaten, theres alot of chasing, its terrifying, but at the same time the movie has some of the most beautiful scenes ever.
2259;Its all shot on a beautiful island, there is one particular scene where they are overlooking a family of brontosaurus.
2260;i think the first one was definately the best.
2261;the first one was the best but in one of the sequels, i think it was the second one but im not certain, they see the kids again and i love the look the kids give them.
2262;I loved Michael Crichton's book, and I never thought that the movie could come anywhere close to it, but this was a great movie!
2263;You will love it!The plot is intense, and actually fairly realistic in the future.
2264;The characters are good enough that you will want to watch all of the sequels, and you will be on the edge of your seat throughout this movie.
2265;In ten years JURASSIC PARK has become a contemporary classic and spawned two sequels.
2266;It's definitely among Spielberg's most fun films ever made and one of my favorites.
2267;an amusement park that stretches across the entire island and is of yet top secret.
2268;the animatronics are perfect, along with Spielberg's always great directing.
2269;"Michael Crichton and David Koepp write the suspenseful screenplay from Chrichton's novel
I:8589;2270;jURASSIC PARK is definitely a magnificent film and will continue to entertain us for generations to come.
I:8589;2271;In fact, it's one of the most entertaining films in years.
I:8589;2272;Go see this wonderous thriller for yourself.
I:8589;2273;It was one of the most thrilling movies I have ever seen.
I:8589;2274;There is a feature with Spielberg, who said, he saw what they did with Titanic and he asked the same people to do Jurrasic Park.
I:8589;2275;The music is still fantastic.
I:8589;2276;Everything about it is what real entertainment is all about.
I:8589;2277;Even after all these years, it was as new and fresh as the day it was released.
I:8589;2278;JURASSIC PARK is a film about a millionare who builds a large theme park on a Costa Rica island, and populates it with genetically.
I:8589;2279;Soon, a storm sweeps over the island and all the electric power in the park shuts off, and the dinosaurs are able to break out of their cages and terrorize the visitors.
I:8589;2280;This is without a doubt one of the best movies ever.
I:8589;2281;This show was just great!
I:8589;2282;It was just amazing, and also didn't over sat his prescence.
I:8589;2283;And the rest of the dinosaurs were great!!!!!!!!!!
I:8589;2284;The acting was also great, on just about evryones part, especially Doc Grant.
I:8589;2285;Before opening the attraction to the public, he invites a top paleontologist, a paleobotanist, a mathematician/theorist, and his two eager grandchildren to experience the park, and help calm anxious investors.
I:8589;2286;The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great.
I:8589;2287;All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.
I:8589;2288;Steven Speilberg will take you to places in this movie that no one else ever will.
I:8589;2289;I highly recommend Jurassic Park.
I:8589;2290;The Grandson enjoyed this movie.
I:8589;2291;Have always liked this movie very much.
I:8589;2292;JURASSIC PARK is one of the best, if not the best, movies made about dinosaurs ever.
I:8589;2293;He builds a zoological theme.
I:8589;2294;It was a massive undertaking, but one that had a huge payoff.
I:8589;2295;Sam Neill is great as Dr. Grant (the role was originally offered to Harrison Ford and I'm actually glad he turned it down) and Jeff Goldblum is almost always a delight to watch on screen.
I:8589;2296;After 15 years of directing his own movies, Richard Attenborough came back for the perfect part as John Hammond.
I:8589;2297;The action sequences in the film are still as exciting to watch as they were when the film first was in theatres.
I:8589;2298;The movie is classic Spielberg and those are some of the best movies ever made.
I:8589;2299;Even though it came out in 1993 when I was only 1, I still claim the movie is amazing!
I:8589;2300;In fact it is my favorite movie of all time.
I:8589;2301;one of the most successful movies in all time is also a movie that changed the way movies were made forever with it's awsome computer animation.
I:8589;2302;It was the most amazing thing I had ever saw the first time I saw it.
I:8589;2303;Spielberg really made an awesome movie that time.
I:8589;2304;I mean whith the spinosaurus and somehow it always finds the people.
I:8589;2305;One of the greatest movies of all time.
I:8589;2306;Steven Speilberg's thrilling blockbuster masterpiece that became the highest grossing movie in worldwide box office history for some time.
I:8589;2307;This film is one of Speilberg's best,an imaginative,brilliant,thrilling roaring ride,a triumph for all ages to enjoy.
I:8589;2308;One of the most honoral films ever and one of the most honorable for visual effects, the dinosaurs are one of the most real looking animals ever on the screen.
I:8589;2309;I recommend this for a dinosaur movie,a speilberg movie and great movie all around.
I:8589;2310;this is an thrilling epic not to be missed and it seems only yesterday this was this ruled the box office in 1993, it is the highest grossing movie of 93 and in my opinon the best of 93.
I:8589;2311;Bring home one of cinema history's greatest triumphs.
I:8589;2312;It's always a movie worth watching, like if you're looking for a movie to watch even though you've probably seen this lots of times it's definitely one that can keep you entertained.
I:8589;2313;If you are having friends over and they want to see a movie, this is one they can probably agree on watching and be entertained throughout the movie, especially during the scary parts.
I:8589;2314;I made my 4 year old and 6 year old watch this with me.
I:8589;2315;so if you want your neighbors happy and still want your hearing when you reach your 70's, stick with the old version because it is a very cool movie with no magnification needed.
I:8589;2316;JURASSIC PARK is a true Masterpiece, no matter how or where you see it.
I:8589;2317;In right more words .
I:8589;2318;If your set is like that, keep just enjoying the blu.
I:8589;2319;I'm sure it looks fantastic on a decent set!
I:8589;2320;/it's as good now as it was 20 years ago.
I:8589;2321;Loved sharing it with my 12 year olds
I:8589;2322;I really enjoy this movie.
I:8589;2323;If you are a Jurrasic Park Fan, you will see this movie as it was meant to be seen!
I:8589;2324;Everything about this movie is phenomenal.
I:8589;2325;The acting, effects, story, suspense, everything.
I:8589;2326;It's just a perfect film in EVERY sense.
I:8589;2327;It's a very underrated film, but in truth it's six.
I:8589;2328;Also the score by the maestro John Williams is one of the best every composed.
I:8589;2329;Nothing I say can do this masterpiece justice, so i'll just say this: Jurassic Park is definitely one of the top 5 best movies ever made, a true masterpiece of cinema.
I:8589;2330;The movie is fun, and mostly holds up to the test of time.
I:8589;2331;Hold on to your seats and enjoy!
I:8589;2332;Spielberg has always excelled at directing thrillers.
I:8589;2333;While Jurassic Park is far from his best film, it's an entertaining thrill ride for older kids and adults.
I:8589;2334;Others have given a pretty good synopsis of the plot, so I'm going to focus on the technical side and strengths/weaknesses of the film.
I:8589;2335;the visuals are still stunning nearly a decade later.
I:8589;2336;The transfer is first rate with stunning clarity and no analog artifacts that I can see.
I:8589;2337;Audio mix is quite good as well and managed to give my system a work out.
I:8589;2338;production meeting that gives us a peak into the creative process and a short documentary on how the foley artists created the sound effects.
I:8589;2339;There's a mighty leap of faith when it comes to extracting the DNA from insects.
I:8589;2340;Keeping those flaws in mind, it's an entertaining and at times awe inspiring film.
I:8589;2341;Spielberg has taken a very similar approach to his career since the early 80's.
I:8589;2342;Although not as powerful or emotionally involving as Schindler's List, it's a lot more entertaining on a superfical level.
I:8589;2343;I watched this as a youngster and decided to watch it as an adult to make sure it was appropriate for my son.
I:8589;2344;Very sharp and clear picture.
I:8589;2345;i loved this movie on TV.
I:8589;2346;Jurassic park is a thriller that will always keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:8589;2347;the special effects are done well.
I:8589;2348;service is great and I got it as excate date.
I:8589;2349;Man this movie is intense.
I:8589;2350;At the time, it had to be the best movie of the year.
I:8589;2351;Spielberg really mad a classic out of that movie.
I:8589;2352;Now it is an 8 year old movie.
I:8589;2353;But it still was a good movie.
I:8589;2354;Just the people actually new what they were up against, they were prepared, but in the first they were not as prepared and that is what makes it so intense.
I:8589;2355;So go watch this and enjoy it.
I:8589;2356;What a deal, what a movie, what a picture and what great sound!
I:8589;2357;This was well done throughout.
I:8589;2358;Growing up, I always wanted to be a dinosaur.
I:8589;2359;Still a great movie though.
I:8589;2360;Never gets old, fun to watch with lots of action, adventure and suspense.
I:8589;2361;the kids love dinosaurs, and this is still the best dinosaur movie around.
I:8589;2362;There was much anticipation concerning Spielberg's dinosaurs and, as far as that goes, the film delivers.
I:8589;2363;The story is a good.
I:8589;2364;the latter is where the film excels, but it takes a whole hour to arrive.
I:8589;2365;The good thing about the long wait is that it creates much anticipation.
I:8589;2366;When the t. rex sequence arrives it is both most welcome and truly horrifying.
I:8589;2367;Two other thrilling scenes are memorable .
I:8589;2368;as far as the principle cast goes, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum are effective as the male protagonists while Laura Dern is likable enough.
I:8589;2369;The kids are good, especially the girl (Ariana Richards), while Richard Attenborough comes across as Santa Claus.
I:8589;2370;Seeing the film recently, he's still a bit over.
I:8589;2371;top and cartoony, but provides a necessary contrast to the other characters.
I:8589;2372;bOTTOM LINE: The dinosaurs and thrills are A+ while the story and characters are just good.
I:8589;2373;Clearly I is fast more impressive than II and III.
I:8589;2374;i can really offer you breath.
I:8589;2375;I read the book and have owned various releases of it over the years.
I:8589;2376;this practice of remastering movies with what's called the """"Blockbuster look"""" (teal / orange cast) is a practice of late with the Hollywood studios."""
2377;ray from the import JP Triology set looks stunning.
2378;it's a perfect surround mix.
2379;I gotta say this movie kick a$$ on my home theater system.
2380;i bought the DTS collector edition and I was happy of the picture,is bright and clear then my old VHS I got it for 5 year then I sell to a friend.
2381;my subwoofer sound great and awesome stomp from T. rex.
2382;This movie is spieldbergs greatest masterpiece.
2383;While Schindlers List may be his best movie on story, this is far better.
2384;The story is very simple and with a movie about dinosaurs rampaging how complex could it be in the first place?
2385;The effect may not be as overwhelming on the small screen, but considering the power of this movie it shouldnt take long before you are engulfed in it.
2386;This is in no means a classic based on deep and riveting story line like the above mentioned schindlers list.
2387;It is more of a classic because of the extremely high entertainment factor based of effects, and the fear that is conveyed from the actors to you.
2388;I was just a 20 something year old when I saw this in the theaters and it was incredible!
2389;The cast was solid and the humor to scary scene ratio was perfect.
2390;The only thing I can compare this movie to as far as epic adventure movies go would be Transformers 3!
2391;The first transformer movie had better writing and so that movie is more comparable to this in that aspect.
2392;first and foremost, this is an action/adventure flick filled with impressive images, and in that role it succeeds admirably.
2393;The 1993 graphics still measure up to anything that has been produced today, and almost all of the action sequences are breathtaking and will have you on the edge of your seat.
2394;"what really gives ""Jurassic Park"" a solid four stars, though, is that Spielberg doesn't ""take sides""."
2395;The viewer is allowed to see the pros and cons of both, and weigh them themselves in advance of the sequel.
2396;overall, this is a solid film that delivers in all important departments: effects, action, plot, and characters.
2397;Plus, thanks to the Spielberg direction, it holds up very well almost 20 years later.
