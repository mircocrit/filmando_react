1;at the beginning he hooks up with a friend to work in the oil fields.
2;So he does what no one else would do: He leaves the driver's seat and climbs a truck moving a piano.
3;As soon as he finds the song he wants, traffic starts moving again, taking him to a new destination.
4;In a famous restaurant scene, Bobby, who has decided to pick up two women in distress along the way, has an interesting way of getting what he wants when he asks for whole wheat toast to go with his omelette.
5;But real affairs have to do with his sister who is a recording pianist artist.
6;'Five Easy Pieces' is a classic.
7;This is the best work (or as good a job as) Jack Nicholson, Karen Black, Susan Anspach, director Bob Rafelson, and writer Carol Eastman have ever done.
8;It did represent the culture of the day though.
9;the soundtrack is amazing and I'd appreciate any information on how to get it.
10;I love character studies like this one, and there are few that really hit the nail on the head as accurately as `Five Easy Pieces'.
11;When you have the right balance of script, actor and director the story just kind of `tells itself' effortlessly, and that is the case with the impressive exercise in human poignancy.
12;There are very few characters that live on in my mind as extraordinary cinematic creations.
13;What Jack Nicholson (screen GOD) does with this character is remarkable.
14;Seriously, seeing the subtle unnerving unraveling that overtakes Robert is just.
15;The character is so complex and so full of range that it really takes a delicate balance of earnest restraint to make it work, and Nicholson understands that balance beautifully.
16;with marvelously crafted sequences of scenery that elongates the emotional core of the film, `Five Easy Pieces' understands the importance of coupling all facets of the film with each other in perfect synchronized order.
17;Ever facet of the film is a compliment to the other.
18;the underside of man and what makes him tick (and hide) is something that has always fascinated me.
19;`Five Easy Pieces' is a spectacular film that makes me understand something deeper about myself with every viewing.
20;And this is where another good movie from the same area, Fat City, comes to mind: scenery, rhythm, content, colors etc. but I definitely agree, this is one of the all.
21;It never tells you any of this, and that's where it is brilliant.
22;It does so in a deliberated, gritty, dramatic way, sans the effervescence of Audrey Hepburn.
23;Again, the movie presents this brilliantly.
24;when I finished watching it today, having neither seen it nor known the plot previously, I sat quietly, in awe.
25;It hit me in the way reading a great piece of literature hits me.
26;It is among the best movies I have ever seen.
27;This film provided one of the first demonstrations of the sheer emotional power of Jack Nicholson as a force of nature, a power unlikely to veer course based on the actions of other human beings.
28;filled attempting to live a life of meaning in the time frame of the turbulent 1960s can be.
29;brow family of cultured and well.
30;the most memorable scene in the movie, and possibly the most revealing on a number of levels, is his attempt to explain his nomadic existence to his wheel chair ridden father.
31;This is an extraordinary film, and one I think you will truly come to appreciate for the breath taking work of cinematic art it is.
32;This is an honestly raw emotional experience.
33;Karen Black is also great.
34;Filled with many memorable dialogue, such as the 'chicken sandwich' scene.
35;The scene where Nicholson speaks with his father is powerful and is one of the few moments when Nicholson really shows us his range as an actor.
36;A landmark movie of the 70's.
37;Superb performances, fascinating characters, great story and some funny moments.
38;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film an 8!
39;It takes responsibility and commitment just to be good at something, more to be great.
40;This movie holds up well even after 43 years.
41;tells a great story in a subdued manner.
42;jack Nicholson at his best!
43;BUT the theme is timeless: we are wondering in the woods, and man, we are PISSED!Bobby also wonders: from state to state, women to women, identity to identity, life to life.
44;His problem is, he is smart.
45;He is aware of his own aimlessness.
46;He demands honesty from everyone, because that is all he can offer anyone.
47;Bobby does what he wants, says what he wants, takes what he wants, and has sex with who he wants, all while pointing out the hypocrocy of everyone around him.
48;he is very funny in his rage, and does and says all the things we want to, but fearfully stop ourselves.
49;It is easy to fall in love with Bobby's bull in a china shop style, especially when, most of the time, he is right on the merits.
50;Jack Nicholson plays Robert Eroica Dupea, once a promising pianist, who has chucked it all and is now working in a Texas oil field and living with a real floozy named Rayette (Karen Black).
51;He goes back home when he learns his father is dying, and we see the claustrophobia he had to escape from.
52;Nicholson delivers a powerful performance as this malcontent who can't seem to fit in anywhere.
53;This remains his best screen performance after that of Jake Gittes in CHINATOWN.
54;Karen Black is also excellent as the airhead bimbo he's attached to .
55;One of the best pictures of the 1970s.
56;I have senn Nicholson in much more likeable roles.
57;Jack is one of my alltime favorite actors and he really deliversin this film.
58;Though Rayette is far from an accomplished bowler, which irks Bobby, she loves him, puts up with him, and wants to be a country singer.
59;the trailer parks, truck stops, oil fields, and bowling alleys of the first part of the movie are pure Bakersfield.
60;He is the patriarch of a musical family, and Bobby is very much the prodigal son.
61;She wants to go to Alaska, because she thinks it is clean.
62;She has seen the pictures of the snow.
63;She asks him to play something for her, and he plays her a beautiful piece by Chopin.
64;She responds, but he laughs and says he picked it because it was the easiest piece he knew, and he played it when he was eight years old, and he played it better then.
65;Bob Rafleson's Five Easy Pieces is an absolute masterpiece.
66;I loved it and after could not wait to see Easy Rider, a very similar film both beginning Jack Nicholson's career.
67;Nicholson's performance in this film greatly exceeds his performance in Easy Rider as did the films themselves.
68;Nicholson's character gives up his life as a concert pianist to work on oil fields.
69;His wife, Karen Black, is emotionally instable and listens to country music whenever sad.
70;In Easy Rider, Karen Black is a prostitute.
71;Some of the best bits of Easy Rider were with Jack Nicholson.
72;"It succeeds tremendously as both
I:8628;73;The scene outside the bowling alley especially captures this beautiful grit.You all probably know the story, so I won't bother with the obligatory references to the diner scene, the hitchhikers, or the truly heartbreaking scene where Robert Eroica Dupea clumsily spills his guts to his sick father.
I:8628;74;I will admit it took several viewings to truly appreciate this film.
I:8628;75;But now I rank it as one of my favorites.
I:8628;76;It's rare to find a film that can take you to a time and place you weren't at and introduce you to people you've never known, yet feel it as if you had.
I:8628;77;Give it a few tries if you have to.
I:8628;78;It was a bit odd seeing sweet Sally Struthers behave so 'naughty', but she played it well.
I:8628;79;I also loved the ranting hitchhiker.
I:8628;80;In a story of two worlds and what happens when they collide, Jack Nicholson gives a performance that should have won an Academy Award.
I:8628;81;something he will eventually apologize for.
I:8628;82;And while all the perfomances are excellent, it is Nicholson that keeps us spellbound.
I:8628;83;Definitely a candidate for a successful remake.
I:8628;84;I have always liked Jack Nicholson (and Karen Black as well).
I:8628;85;I forgot how good Jack Nicholson can be.
I:8628;86;When it's obvious that Bobby doesn't want to live a life like Elton's, Bobby's life hits rock.
I:8628;87;We learn a lot more about Bobby from this visit and realize that he's a far more complex and educated individual than what the first half of the movie reveals.
I:8628;88;His screen presence is mesmerizing and so many scenes leave an indelible imprint in the viewer's memory.
I:8628;89;Nicholson portrays a very complex and enigmatic character and does it superbly.
I:8628;90;After having meaningless relationships with two dimwitted bimbos, Bobby later meets Catherine, a woman who is beautiful both on the outside as well as the inside.
I:8628;91;Bobby woos her by playing a very moving piece of classical music on the piano.
I:8628;92;The sound was very good, but far from great since there were instances where voices of the characters were hard to understand.
I:8628;93;I'm not sure that it lived up to the hype, but the move had good character development and some interesting parts.
I:8628;94;FIVE EASY PIECES is a magnificent film that is extremely moving.
I:8628;95;This telling comment, while delivered as a casual joke, cuts right to the heart of Dupea's emotions.
I:8628;96;In a memorable scene during a traffic jam, Dupea jumps up into the back of a truck, pulls some covers away from a piano, and begins to play classical music.
I:8628;97;There are a few heart.
I:8628;98;These scenes alone make FIVE EASY PIECES worth watching.
I:8628;99;jack Nicholson's performance is simply amazing in this film.
I:8628;100;In 1970, he was definitely at the height of his game, and his game is very good.
I:8628;101;Nicholson manages to breathe life and complexity into Dupea, a character who does not come of with our full approval, nor our total disapproval.
I:8628;102;Ultimately, we get the perfect portrait of a man who is on the run from his past.
I:8628;103;I highly recommend FIVE EASY PIECES to anyone, particularly to those who enjoy 1970s film as much as I do.
I:8628;104;Dupea (and Jack Nicholson's performance) is one of the most memorable characters ever brought to film and one that you just have to meet for yourself.
I:8628;105;I finally got a chance to watch this and I truly enjoyed it.
I:8628;106;Also, the character that Karen Black played was pitch perfect.
I:8628;107;The film's central character, Robert Eroica Dupea, is not a particularly likable person but as written superbly by Carol Eastman and brilliantly assayed by Jack Nicholson he becomes sympathetic.
I:8628;108;Nicholson gives a carefully modulated performance, a departure from his more flamboyant work in """"Easy Rider"""", suggesting both the anger, apathy, and sadness that seethes inside."""
109;The real revelation here is Black.
110;Rayette is certainly unlearned but Black brought out the sweetness and the sadness in her.
111;On a final note any film that puts Tammy Wynette and Chopin on equal footing has to be great.
112;I tried to find something good in this flick because Jack Nicholson is a great actor.
113;Director Rafelson was never this good again.
114;"In Pieces, subtle images and sounds make an impression: a pained, silent father's face
I:8628;115;Therein lies the film's strengths.
I:8628;116;Dupea represents an alienated generation, but an intellectually honest one too.
I:8628;117;Nicholson was the perfect actor for this part"
118;So there's an appealing lack of classic 'cocky Jack' in his performance, as if he's a bit unsure himself.
119;His quieter moments work quite well.
120;But he worked that kind of scene to far greater highs in The Last Detail.
121;By the way, has anyone noticed that, when Nicholson is really good, his greatest strength may be making other actors better?
122;In Last Detail, Randy Quaid is unquestionably better and was far deserving of an Oscar.
123;More intriguing characters replace relatively amusing but predictable ones.
124;The entire tone grows quieter and open.
125;Nicholson in his younger days, so can really see his acting talent.
126;Love the music aspect to the movie as well.
127;Probably the best lines in any movie!
128;diner scene is a classic.
129;Jack Nicholson at his first and a this best.
130;It is a classic so be prepared for a great movie.
131;I love the sandwich episode.
132;It's a little slow and hard to follow but has some of Jack's best early work.
133;One of the all time great movies!
134;very actor was wonderful, especially Nicholson and the late Karen Black.
135;All sorts of interesting questions raised from the silence of God (Nicholson's father) to human attractions, and art.
136;see for any Jack Nicholson film enthusiast.
137;And anyone into 1970s nostalgia can swim up to their eyeballs in it with this one. . . even in spite of the Tammy Wynette songs served up ad nausem.
138;The narrative, the characters, the performances, the settings and direction are marvelous.
139;I think Nicholson's role was intended for someone a little younger but his performance was deeply felt and very human.
140;This was a very interesting story about a family of musicians and a son who had been a piano prodigy.
141;This film is everything that modern character studies long to be.
142;"'Five Easy Pieces' is revealing about a wayward culture
I:8628;143;do, intellectual family for a proletarian lifestyle of manual labor and promiscuity.
I:8628;144;There, he finds what he believes could be his salvation in the form of sophisticated woman who is also romantic and optimistic (she doesn't believe she's ever been bored).
I:8628;145;enjoy this picture for the craftsmanship with which Rafelson molds the internal conflict, an art that is evidently admired these days and very rarely achieved.
I:8628;146;Everyone is great in this movie.
I:8628;147;I've never been a Karen Black fan, but she fits her role perfectly.
I:8628;148;Playing a once promising pianist (his full name is Robert """"Eroica"""" Dupea ."""
149;It is one of his performances that I truly love and admire.
150;Karen Black as Bobby's girlfriend Rayette, Tammy Wynett's admiring waitress, is outstanding.
151;Laszlo Kovack's cinematography is gorgeous.
152;salad scene in a diner is a classic and pure delight to watch.4.5/5
153;The film stars Jack Nicholson, with Karen Black, Susan Anspach, Ralph Waite, and Sally Struthers in supporting roles.
154;summary: Classical pianist Robert Dupea (Nicholson), who comes from a family of musicians, works in a California oil field.
155;He tells Rayette that he must go to see his father and reluctantly agrees to take her along.
156;Eventually, Robert reaches his destination.
157;She played the role of a wife that was constantly insulted and put down.
158;Just because I can't give this zero stars I have to give it 1 weasel star and that's being nice.
159;I had heard about it but finally got to watch it.
160;Early Jack Nicholson was an amazing actor even back then.
161;The movie is an interesting study of a young man trying to find himself.
162;so ya' got that, one of Sally Struthers first films as well.
163;Here's your chance to see Jack have a sentimental moment.
164;The filmography is beautiful, richly colorful, with the occasional understated symbolic shots (windshield wiper wiping away rain) and incredible views which range from oil fields in South Cal to beautiful northern pine country in Canada.
165;Silence speaks louder than words.
166;You're in the presence of art with this movie, albeit art that leaves a bitter taste and which you could write off as BS in the final analysis, which I partly do, but you gotta hand it to the film.
167;The movie has some classic scenes including the famous scene in the diner with the waitress.
168;especially poignant are his exchanges with Tita and his Dad, and how he always ends up observing the reality more than he would really want to.
169;an excellent drama about a lost soul.
170;Jack Nicholson In a unbelivably well played talored made role for an actor of his magnuitude.
171;A Powerful moving film drawing it's strength from a detailed point of view displaying the frailty of the human soul.
172;The end of film is truly memorable when Nicholson Leaves his beautiful but annoying girlfriend stranded at a Gas Station while he hitches a ride with a Trucker up north.
173;One of the best films of the 1970s Many people cite One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest as Jack Nicholson's best performance, but for my money his performance in Five Easy Pieces tops them all (and that's saying a lot!)
174;It is a quiet, understated film about a man (Bobby Dupea) who doesn't know what he is looking for, but keeps looking.
175;do family, all, including himself, quite talented musically, but he has abandoned that to work in the oil fields and live as an unskilled worker.
176;Nicholson's scene alone with the father who can no longer speak is acting at its very finest (it ranks with Brando's scene with his dead wife in Last Tango In Paris).
177;The supporting players (Karen Black, Susan Anspach, Lois Smith) are perfectly cast.
178;A must see film for any serious movie.
179;His violent changes of humour , and bitterness still are a must for all his hard fans and cinema lovers but also for young actors .
180;bob Rafelson made to me his brilliant masterpiece with this one .
181;This movie has a very strong influence of the best European Cinema and that' s why it can explain how the great audience frequently do no remember with major intensity .
182;the final sequence seemed to reveal the triumph of the will in the middle of the quotidian loneliness that becomes in an usual way of life with the petrified forest in the middle of a gas station , crude metaphor that signified his wrong initial decision .
183;Jack Nicholson is superb in the role of a man who spent most of his life trying to be the musician his father wanted him to be and then decided to go in search of himself.
184;The service by the vendor was excellent but I did not enjoy this movie.
185;Nicholson is excellent at playing characters such as this, the antihero protagonist who is as charming as he is self.
186;This movie was good because I actually got to view the whole movie.
187;I am happy I watched it.
188;this was actually the first time I ever watched this movie start to finish.
189;loved it and how did I miss it
190;Bob Rafelson's film stands out as one of the landmark films of the post.
191;While he responds to the vitality and freedom of his working.
192;"the best thing about the script is how much intelligence it cedes to its audience
I:8628;193;one in a recording studio, another at a Ping Pong table in front of the Dupea home.
I:8628;194;In a very wise move, Rafelson allows us to hear twice at some length her beautiful voice singing the songs of her idol Tammy Wynette, allowing us to see how country music affects her and expands her emotions as much as classical music does the culture.
I:8628;195;I am mystified as to why so many people think this film is so great.
I:8628;196;A very early movie in Jack Nicholson's career.
I:8628;197;he becomes a worker on an oil rig, a complete alcoholic, a brutal misogynist and generally reprehensible human being all around, completely divorced from his origins and disdainful of his considerable talents.
I:8628;198;Karen Black, his gorgeous hilbilly girlfriend, really forms the paradox of Dupea's character: his ferocious embrace of man's lower instincts in favor of a greater authenticity and his actual repugnance when facing them for any extended period of time.
I:8628;199;for good reasons, and the impotence of the son.
I:8628;200;This is a masterpiece and wins out over similar modern fare like """"American Beauty"""" or """"Good Will Hunting"""" anyday."""
201;Karen Black is a warm sweet rollwith axle grease coffee.
202;This is a truly great OLD film, deep and intriguing.
203;Karen Black was award worthy as well.
204;I love movies, and I can almost always find something redeemable in even a bad film.
205;And I've always liked both Nicholson and Black.
206;The other nominees that year were Patton, Love Story, Airport, and MASH .
207;One of the definitive, highly acclaimed films of the early.70's New American Cinema, Bob Rafelson's edgy, deep character study features complex and courageous performances from both Nicholson and Black.
208;"nominated ""Pieces"" will stick with you."
209;"Holds up very well, Jack Nicholson in his prime
I:8628;210;This is arguably one the best films to emerge from the late 60's.
I:8628;211;Hopper and Fonda, as his travelling cohorts, are also excellent.
I:8628;212;is what film enthusiasts like to call a """"landmark performance."""""""
213;The restaurant scene is one of the most memorable in cinematic history.
214;highly recommended for every film buff out there.
215;Probably waited half the movie for something interesting to happen, it never did, so I turned it off and watched something else.
216;She dresses like a frump, or sometimes like a little girl, with a red cardigan and pigtails.
217;Her joy at seeing her brother after a passage of three years is palpable.
218;In everything from EAST OF EDEN to FOXES to AI: ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE, directors have tried tweaking that overbearing and particularly gruesome hamminess to ill effect, but here director Bob Rafelson (never better) manages to tone her down so she gives what must be her very best performance.
219;if only the rest of the movie was as consistently good as the scenes in which Lois Smith gives such a good performance.
220;This is a must see for any Nicolson fan or a fan of good well written movies.
221;He is brought back to his hometown when he goes to visit his father who has taken ill.
222;This is a classic movie that still holds up in the present day.
223;nicholson was at his finest and the supporting cast was excellent.
224;His best movie ever, right up there with The Shinning Pure Genius.
225;A must see for Nicholson fans:)!!!!!
226;karen black is wonderful as always, and of course theres sexy jack too!
227;I love Jack Nicholson and i saw it was nominated for academy awards, so I figured it must be good.
228;It features some powerful and convincing acting, but if you're looking for an uplifting movie with a happy, satisfying ending this is NOT it.
229;Nominated for four Academy Awards, this 1970 film stars Jack Nicholson as Robert Dupea, a creative and alienated drifter who once held the promise of being a serious classical concert pianist.
230;There, he enters into an impossible relationship with his brother's sophisticated girlfriend played by Susan Anspach.
231;the film moves fast and held my interest, with a wide variety of episodes to further deepen the intensity of the Nicholson character.
232;this is a film that works as well today as it did in the 1970s.
233;But it must have especially timely then and viewed as a cry for independence and freedom as the alienated Nicholson just keeps moving on.
234;The screenplay by Carole Eastman, under the direction of Bob Rafelson, is excellent.
235;And there's something about the story that makes us realize that there's a little bit of the Jack Nicholson character in all of us.
236;Memorable scene upon memorable scene.
237;The characters made their point clear on how they see life, and it is an intimate view.
238;western songs that grate on Nicholson.)
239;After leaving with his girlfriend, Nicholson decides to return to his home and pursue his new.
240;Very surprised that this movie is so acclaimed.
241;I loved seeing Jack Nicholson in his beginning.
242;It was fun to see some of the facial expressions that ended up being a part of every later role.
243;fun to see some of the other guys to and recognize them.
244;Jack Nicholson plays a concert pianist who works on oil rigs and has a beautifully singing girlfriend who is employed as a waitress.
245;Karen Black, his girlfriend, puts up with mistreatment and infidelity while Jack constantly mistreats her and longs for someone else.
246;A good story of a man with talent who can't seem to get it together and take himself in a direction which would make his life meaningful.
247;A very good character study without obvious answers.
248;Although the film is dated, it is worth viewing for Karen Black and Jack Nicholson's performances.
249;Great movie with great actors.
250;Entertaining and timeless with Jack Nicholson showing his potential as an actor.
251;Jack N is stellar and shows his acting roots.
252;Even though the movie is now dated , the story was interesting and the acting was great.
253;Nicholson stars as Robert Dupea, one of his most complex and challenging roles.
254;Once a promising pianist, he left that lifestyle and his family and moved to work on an oil rig in Texas.
255;The middle act turns into a slapstick road movie with Helena Kallianinotes hilarious as a hitchhiker they pick up along the way.
256;One particular vivid scene that stands out for me toward the end of the film is when Robert tries to have a coversation with his estranged father, who is disabled by a stroke and wheel chair bound.
257;Ultimately Robert decides to escape from everything for the the last time and start over with a clean slate, as his existential journey begins at the end of the film.
258;I wanted to like it, as a piece of classic cinema, as early Nicholson, as an anthropological study of Vietnam.
259;but on no level can I consider this a good movie.
260;His performances are usually top.
261;The characters are complex, the plot is thick, and the young Jack Nicholson is outstanding.
262;This is an excellent film!
263;"Originally released in 1970, ""Five Easy Pieces"" is a spellbinding character study and a landmark film that remains one of the most powerful and thoroughly excellent accomplishments in the history of cinema."
264;key intensity, and with lots of surprises, keeping us glued to the screen.
265;of course, a huge part of why we remain glued to the screen is because of the truly phenomenal, awe.
266;inspiring lead performance from Jack Nicholson.
267;Nicholson has every nuance of this deceptively complex character nailed, and his screen presence is simply beyond words.
268;bound, and can no longer speak following two strokes.
269;This scene, wrenchingly performed by Nicholson, is essentially the emotional climax of the film.
270;And in the end, we find that we really do sympathize with Robert Dupea, with thanks again to Nicholson's superb acting.
271;The movie's ending is hardly a happy one, but it's perfectly in line with the Nicholson character, and it is a haunting, brilliant way to bring closure to the film.
272;as somber as the movie is, there are certainly some gloriously funny bits as well.
273;on the one hand, Nicholson's performance carries this movie.
274;black perfectly portrays the kind of well.
275;meaning but ditzy type who is willing to forgive their boyfriend for almost anything.
276;Also unforgettable is Susan Anspach.
277;Helena Kallianiotes is hilarious as the airheadedly 'deep' Palm Apodaca, Lois Smith is wonderful as Robert's sister Partita, and Billy Green Bush is extremely good as Robert's co. worker and friend of sorts Elton.
278;And in a bit part, Lorna Thayer proves to be a perfect foil for Jack as the waitress in the aforementioned restaurant scene.
279;by all means, the film's screenplay is marvelous.
280;The dialogue is simply right on the money, containing great black humor.
281;I'll admit that I wasn't even around until over a decade after its original theatrical release in September of '70, and this film strikes me as an entirely relevant and brilliantly realized piece of work.
282;Five Easy Pieces is a profound masterpiece that, for serious viewers, will remain forever timeless.
283;Pathetic story, but well made.
284;A sophisticated man and musician who can't live up to his own expectations.
285;If you grew up in that era, it will ring a lot of bells.
286;This is one of my favorite films.
287;"His girlfriend Rayette 
I:8628;288;Then there is Catherine"
289;Catherine is a partial reflection of what his life could have been and in the end of the film he is caught between returning to his ho.
290;there are classic moments in this film that I don't really need to go over because we already know them but for me the film becomes more intriguing when he finally arrives at the island to visit his ill father and encounters Catherine.
291;this film is deceptively complex because of the dynamic humanistic detail thats shown of all the characters in this film and how they relate to one another.
292;One of Jack Nicholson's best work and Karen Black is unforgettable as Rayette.
293;Robert is happy with his existence and everything is fine.
294;this starts a memorable road trip with the most famous diner scene where Robert has a fight with a snotty waitress.
295;We find out that Robert grew up in the upper middle class and is an accomplished pianist.
296;Enter a new woman (Susan Anspach) who turns Robert's head and reminds him of what he left behind.
297;at the time, this was a cutting edge film but looking back it is very uneven with some great performances.
298;Robert Dupea (Jack Nicholson), a narcissist, works on an oilrig with his friend, of sorts, Elton (Billy Green Bush).
299;on the road is where the film really comes alive.
300;"She's heading to Alaska because it looks ""all white and clean in the pictures""."
301;The scenes in his family's house touch greatness.
302;And because of that realism, it is more affecting then most films.
303;Equally as important is that it has a bonafide great movie performance by Jack Nicholson.
304;But its reflective performances in films like Five Easy Pieces and Ironweed that impress me most.
305;He's like a actor of that genre.
306;I feel bad to say this but Ironweed was the best film he made in the last 30 years and maybe Two Jacks.
307;This is probably my most favorite movie ever, but I would like to point out to all the people, including the official amazon.
308;the movie itself is incredible and in my opinion Nicholsons' best and most raw acting, without the goofy cliche crazy Nicholson schtick that characterizes his later work.
309;and one of the best performances on.
310;Having just seen this movie for the first time I am floored by the greatness of all aspects of this production.
311;Very classic film with excellent acting.
312;Jack Nicholson is a wonderful actor, but since the early 1970s, virtually all of his performances have been variations of Jack playing Jack.
313;Nicholson's Bobby Dupee is a talented classical musician who comes from a family of talented classical musicians.
314;It is a moment that can stand with anything he has done since.
315;If you're a huge Jack Nicholson fan, then by all means watch it and come to your own conclusion.
316;This is a great 70's movie!
317;It was fun to see the actors in their younger days.
318;Karen Black's character was a hoot.
319;Yes, is he one of the most important characters in American films?
320;I do not think so, but Jack Nicholson's performance IS one of the best in American film.
321;most of the characters in this film are eccentric and I found some of their interactions forced.
322;The main character was kinda trippy, but he was entertaining.
323;Sort of like a more charming and motivated bukowski.
324;Technically, the movie was fine.
325;Teaming up with his old pal Bob Rafelson (from Monkees fame), they created an interesting character study.
326;His girlfriend, played by Karen Black, wants to be a country western singer and is constantly singing along to Stand By Your Man .
327;Mr. Nicholson does an incredible job of peeling back the layers of Dupea and his scene ordering a chicken salad sandwich is highly memorable.
328;Ms. Black is perfectly annoying in her role and she does a tremendous job.
329;this film contains more than its fill of powerful and perfectly done moments.
330;A movie capable of engaging the viewer so perfectly and exacting everything is certainly worthy of praise.
331;Handheld cameras compliment crane shots and, most importantly, are used when they should be to incite the perfect in response and symbolism.
332;He did have something to say with some of the sharpest acting I had ever seen.
333;"Throw in an equally magnificent portrayal by Karen Black, sexy and hillbilly
I:8628;334;Consequently, the siblings are brilliant and eccentric.
I:8628;335;culture, drugs, long haired hippies, sexual openness, and shiftless lifestyles.
I:8628;336;Bob Rafelson's film gives you that, but mercifully, with subtly.
I:8628;337;A pessimist dream of a movie.
I:8628;338;Nicholsan's performance is without a doubt superior, but the material is second.
I:8628;339;His performance is layered with angst, passion, soft.
I:8628;340;Supported by Karen Black (too bad she's never had as good a role since), Susan Anspach and the wonderful Lois Smith, the entire ensemble provides a thought.
I:8628;341;provoking study of a potentially rewarding life wrought with bad choices.
I:8628;342;This is very much of a character.
I:8628;343;driven film, and Bob Rafelson gives the actors free reign, a wise decision.
I:8628;344;From the standpoint of its historical value, the film is most instructive.
I:8628;345;Five Easy Pieces is a contemparary American adaptation of Jesus Christ's best.
I:8628;346;This is a modern day morality play dramatizing the war that rages inside every human between the spirit and the flesh with the stakes being either the salvation or the damnation of man's eternal soul.
I:8628;347;Although the film appears a bit dated now, the ominous message it delivers on personal self.
I:8628;348;music plays an important role in the story as it represents Spirituality.
I:8628;349;While this song has been vilified by feminists as being humiliating to women, it perfectly conveys how love on the spiritual level is so paradoxical to the carnal man.
I:8628;350;To paraphrase Jesus' message, """"If you want love, give love."""
351;The journey home concludes with a ferry boat ride to a Puget Sound island.
352;The house has an aura of quiet solemnity and is filled with furniture and appliances which haven't changed since it's initial habitation.
353;I've got a jacket in the back here.
354;This is an extraordinary treat, to see a film I found outrageously funny 35 years ago and then find far more in it than I remembered.
355;What is so fun about this is how unHollywood it is: the themes .
356;Nicholson delivers a character so multi.
357;facated, so complex in its ugliness and charm, that you see his potential as a great artist (in spite of Hollywood).
358;remember that wonderful actress and beauty?
359;There is a little of Robert Dupea (Jack Nicholson) in all of us.
360;Nicholson who finds himself working in the oil fields and living with his girl friend (Karen Black) is growing restless with his surroundings.
361;The film follows Nicholson as he receives news that his father is dying and returns to his home in Washington.
362;There are a great many descriptive scenes in this film and some great acting.
363;The scene in the resturant has become a classic.
364;If you like Jack Nicholson, this film is one of his best.
365;"All this is by way of suggesting that Nicholson as Bobby Dupea is not only a stunning performance
I:8628;366;All they share in common (other than bloodline) is a love of classical music.
I:8628;367;As directed by Bob Rafelson, the cast provides a number of excellent performances which are, more often than not, as out of sync with each other as all of them are with the Nixon Era in which they then lived.
I:8628;368;Brilliantly portrayed by Karen Black in a performance (then and now) deserving of much more praise that it has received, Rayette is Bobby's pregnant girlfriend.
I:8628;369;She yearns to stand by her man.
I:8628;370;for me, the most poignant moments in the film occur when Bobby returns home and is reunited with his father, sister Tita (Lois Smith), brother Carl (Ralph Waite) and his wife Catherine (Susan Anspach).
I:8628;371;Paradoxically, Bobby combines both angst and apathy.
I:8628;372;His emotional range and versatility are stunning.
I:8628;373;This was for Nicholson, however, a breakthrough performance and for all we know, his best work may lie ahead.
I:8628;374;One of Nicholson's earlier films, this tragi.
I:8628;375;It is gritty, heartbreaking, and it also gives a good picture of American culture in the early 1970s.
I:8628;376;One of my favorite Nicholson movies.
I:8628;377;This is a very understated movie.
I:8628;378;Hard to find a plot but manages to keep you interested in what is going on anyway.
I:8628;379;Jack Nicholson gives a terrific performance as Robert Dupea.
I:8628;380;The movie is very artistically done and well planned out.
I:8628;381;I can see it being studied in film school as an example of good acting and directing.
I:8628;382;I believe that a movie can be both technically brilliant and entertaining but I didn't find this one to be one of them.
I:8628;383;my favorite scene in """"FEP"""" is when Nicholson gets testy with the waitress in the diner."""
384;this is Jack Nicholson at his best.
385;are we to admire and sympathize with the hero, when he is in a way a creep, if nonetheless a charming creep?
386;or now?Nicholson plays it well, as do Karen Black and Susan Anspach.
387;I admit I simply found the Nicholson appallingly babyish, self.
388;I can say I specifically enjoyed seeing so many actors from the past in their prime, but the story was simply about a blue collar jerk who is actually a pompous jerk from money who ends up being, most likely, a drifter jerk.
389;One particular scene in the movie has become legendary, and it's typical of the entire film.
390;His actions reveal intelligence, along with the requisite anti.
391;Despite his philandering ways, he also reveals a moral awareness and complexity, demonstrated by his decision to see his father and taking Rayette along for the trip.
392;These aspects create an expectation for psychological understanding, compelling the viewer to attach motivation or meaning to his actions.
393;bobby's romantic relationships are a manifestation of his internal conflict.
394;He knows Rayette is uneducated and her intelligence level is questionable.
395;He treats her abominably, if not abusively, but fundamentally respects her qualities (at least when juxtaposed with the values of his upbringing).
396;His regard is notably revealed in his defense of her character and humanity in the parlor scene.
397;She is Rayette's opposite, Bobby's mirror, and a necessary manifestation of his internal conflict: She is never an honest romantic interest.
398;He always wraps himself up in it and makes you believe that he could be no one else.
399;Amazon helped us identify and solve that problem easily, and I got to revisit a well made (if challenging storyline) movie.
400;Yet from the soundtrack of the opening scene featuring Tammy Wynette singing STAND BY YOUR MAN I was involved in this absorbing character study.
401;This film is all about relationships and character development and is well acted as is vital in such films.
402;"The ending of the film is surprising yet fits with Bobby's pattern of choosing the ""easy piece""."
403;I thought this was going to be a good movie.
404;I enjoyed watching this movie again some 39 years later and complete.
405;Jack Nicholson shines in this extraordinary 70's film by writer/director Bob Rafelson.
406;He is a womanizer, and lives with a waitress (Karen Black) who hates and loves him.
407;"She asks him what to do with the chicken, and he tells her to ""hold them between your knees."""
408;It's funny how we sometimes forget how great older films were.
409;This movie got good reviews and am still trying to figure out why.
410;Wasted time as far as I'm concerned!
411;Five easy pieces great movie, great performance, good reminder to us to find our own right place in society .
412;we all are looking for harmony, harmony is ultimate peace of mind.
413;Jack Nicholson does some of his finest work in this quiet, thoughtful character study of a man who can never be satisfied with work, family, friends, lovers, music or anything else.
414;"Karen Black shines as his ditsy but sweet girlfriend, whom he eventually abandons for good
I:8628;415;This is a movie with plenty of 1970s zeitgeist, from the confrontation with the waitress to the two female hitch.
I:8628;416;Having seen """"Five Easy Pieces"""" when it first came out and again on video long ago when VHS was the rage, I was surprised at how well I remembered it."""
417;What most reviewers seem to have missed is all the other hilariously funny bits: the ping.
418;"every scene with Carl in it is hilarious
I:8628;419;there's another name for you classical music buffs .
I:8628;420;Almost as good as the humor are the wonderful performances of Ralph Waite as Carl, and Karen Black and Susan Anspach.
I:8628;421;Best of all are the spectacularly beautiful Puget Sound ferry scenes .
I:8628;422;the film is worth seeing for those alone.
I:8628;423;This is from the era of great and understandable movies.
I:8628;424;This one has made up my mind.
I:8628;425;With movies like this,I will keep my prime membership after the trial period.
I:8628;426;Surprised it was considered for a best picture Oscar, not that entertaining.
I:8628;427;Jack did a good job in his role.
I:8628;428;iQ conflict that is portrayed brilliantly.
I:8628;429;Her character is most beautifully played, and shows very sympathetic character traits .
I:8628;430;the first scene when she sings in the car and when she comes to the family and makes big efforts to be nice, are examples.
I:8628;431;There is true blue humour that lies in the accuracy of rendering contrasts.
