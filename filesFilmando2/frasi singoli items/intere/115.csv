1;Just like 'The Squid and the Whale' and 'The Royal Tenenbaums' before it, 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a quirky, comedy masterpiece about a dysfunctional family and their quests for love and greatness.
2;His brother, and their uncle, is gay and has just attempted suicide before living with the family, interestingly enough sharing Duane's bedroom where they can have heart.
3;The daughter (Abigail Breslin) is sweet, perceptive, and charming.
4;The uncle also has much wisdom, including some advice to Duane about suffering that he seems to need and hear for himself in the same meeting.
5;With the admonition that our society has a low tolerance for failure, and the wit and laughter to set us all straight, 'Little Miss Sunshine' remains a sage and funny family satire.
6;(It is rated 'R,' so the laughs may be only for those family members at your discretion.
7;The characters are a somewhat complex and you do have to infer some things which explains some of the so.
8;This is a quirky off color comedy which reveals some really important life outlooks and biases.
9;I could watch this film again and again.
10;Mix a marguerita, sit back and enjoy the ride!
11;Maybe they forgot to put the laugh.
12;I started the movie, sat on my couch, and waited to laugh.
13;The humor comes quite naturally from a realistic group of characters and how they relate to one another.
14;It helps that all the actors did such a fine job of bringing everyone to life as well.
15;"It's a ""road movie"" that you're sure to enjoy."
16;"I saw this movie as a sneak preview, and all I have to say is that this movie is by far the funniest and smartest comedy of all time, with a little of ""National Lampoons Vacation"" but with the indie charm of ""You, Me and Everyone We Know,"" Little Miss Sunshine brings to the screen a heartfelt irony of pain and love with every character presenting a full personality not hollowed or spoiled by cheap antics or bad acting."

18;The plot is really secondary to its characters.
19;"He had some of the best lines in the film (e. g., ""Get me some porn."
20;but he keeps plugging away.
21;The Neitzche driven son, driven to the edge by his pursuit of success is probably the most tragic loser of the group, but his ultimate destruction is also the most amusing (at least to me).
22;Thanks and triple thanks to Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris for bringing me this glorious display of human wretchedness.
23;Hilarious comedy that makes you think a little.
24;Great performances by the entire cast.
25;In you're into indie films at all, this is a must see!
26;Steve Carell is in an unusual role and gives an amazing performance.
27;hippie, druggie grandfather who teaches the adorable and talented young.
28;"fun for the entire family
29;This film was nominated for best picture and Alan Arkin won best supporting actor, I was worried this film would be a disappointment but I was pleasantly surprised.
30;I enjoyed this quirky flick from beginning to end.
31;Abigail Breslin (also nominated) is ray of sunshine as a beauty pageant hopeful Olive Hoover, she is plain, chubby, and less than graceful but she has tremendous heart.
32;Breslin's performance is pretty amazing for someone so young, and jeez she's been in like a thousand films after this one made her famous.
33;Paul Dano and Steve Carell also star and probably have the best character layout in this film.
34;I highly recommend this much.
35;Has a lot to do about family values.
36;Little Miss Sunshine has a sunny heart.
37;The movie is heartwarming, without being sugarcoated"
38;Its allure is that it's fresh, funny, and innocent, even when profanities are being uttered left and right.
39;what is most redeeming about this movie, however, are the characters and the superb cast of actors who play them.
40;office, is incredibly convincing as Frank, the uncle who attempted to commit suicide because of an unrequited homosexual love.
41;Alan Arkin (Jacob the Liar, Gattaca)'s Grandpa is one of the best forefathers on screen.
42;Dano, who spends most of the movie mimicking and writing his lines on a notepad, is an exceptionally talented young man and a promising actor.
43;Breslin is a girl with a very, very bright future.
44;She isn't a supermodel, but she is better .
45;more human and more real.
46;the last ten minutes of this movie will delight, surprise, and entertain you.
47;The rest of the moviegoers in my theater laughed until their hands could clap no longer and their faces were full of glee after the movie ended.
48;The movie brought a childhood smile, one of true wonderment and enjoyment to everyone's face.
49;if you can make people laugh that hard about everybody's worse fear, you don't only have a comedy, you've got a true classic.
50;little Miss Sunshine is a winner, but not because it tries and never gives up.
51;It's a winner in the truest sense of the word .
52;it warms your heart and entertains you until the very last credit rolls.
53;day family trip can do.
54;plus, great performances from each and every character.
55;I reckon you'll laugh and give life a second and happier thought.
56;This movie has quite often been recommended to me by friends, and it is almost ALWAYS on television here in Australia so it must be doing something right, so I decided to give it a try.
57;i was quite pleased with my decision to watch the film and it made me feel a bit better from illness for the 2 hours it lasted.
58;that being said it's a fun little movie that most other people will enjoy again and again.
59;i would happily recommend it to people, despite not being extremely fond of it.

62;"Secondary characters lift the level higher
63;Watching their relationship evolve is particularly touching.
64;as the bizarre events unfold, one knows that the payday will come at the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant.
65;Gramps, by now long gone, is so very alive in every bit of it.
66;It is uproariously funny, and very defiant too, mirroring Dwayne's rage.
67;Watching this family, and I use the word carefully, finding themselves on stage, for all the """"perfect"""" world to see and ridicule, despise, and condemn ."""
68;I'm sure plenty of people here will share their favorite humorous moments from this film, and there certainly are plenty.
69;This movie has heart, and it deals with the human condition.
70;Alan Arkin's character intimates this twice, once to Olive and once to his son (Greg Kinnear).
71;Carrell tells him that real growth in life and true wisdom come from making it through often unbearable pain.
72;It's smart, and it leaves you with more than a tummy ache from too much popcorn.
73;I even have videos of my family members laughing as they watch it.
74;She is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve this dream and strieves to gain support from her family who eventually gives in and decides to take a road trip to where the pagent takes place.
75;The length that Olive's family is willing to go in order to assist her in fufilling her dream is very heartwarming.
76;If you love movies that are unpredictable, hilarious, yet have true important meaning and values behind them, then Little Miss Sunshine is the movie for you!
77;I bought it for myself to add to my movie collection, this is such a classic movie that will never get old.
78;Also, Steve Carell is amazing!
79;Great comedy with lots of twists!
80;There were so many moments I could identity with concerning my own family.
81;You will laugh and cry!
82;I just watched Sunshine last night, and I had the most wonderful time.
83;It was brilliant to see everything going wrong in just the most perfect way!The movie centers around a charming but awkward 7.
84;(A lot of movies work beautifully with almost no acting by the actors, and this one is an example.
85;She is so utterly a seven.year.
86;The way she bounces up and down when she's excited is worth it all, at least for me!It's tempting to look for morals in this movie.
87;I can see how it could be hilarious for some people, and I did find myself chuckling.
88;the cast was very strong, the writing was excellent, and this movie deserves every good thing it receives.
89;And I wish all the actors, especially the younger ones, lots of continued success.
90;I absolutely loved this movie.
91;Abigial Breslin shines as does everyone else.
92;Yes, this family was/is dyfunctional but pulls together in the end.
93;Great cast, great story, great acting.
94;This will become a classic.
95;This is a totally satisfying film.
96;I enjoyed this movie despite the fact that it is not particularly my type.
97;It's quirky, its fun, it's charming.
98;"A refreshing corrective to our American fetish with ""Facing the Giants"" and winning."
99;But life can still be sweet in a dysfuncional VW Van.
100;Every family has a few crazies, so nearly everyone can RELATE to this movie.
101;This movie is one of the best comedies I have seen in quite some time.
102;And a superb cast brings it all together perfectly.
103;It had its (few) funny moments.
104;What is funny about subjecting a little girl to sexual ideas anyhow?
105;It is hilarious and touching at the same time.
106;There were parts I laughed really hard, and parts that made me cry.
107;This is definitely one of my favorite movies now.
108;I bought it the day it came out, and have given it to numerous people as a gift.
109;Everything in this movie is completely capable of happening in real life.
110;I love this movie because it shows that EVERY family, no matter how ordinary the lives they lead are, has moments that everyone can laugh for or cry for.
111;if you like twisted humor, you will love this movie.
112;"The movie was great
113;The movie was in wonderful condition and I received it quickly.
114;The following year `Juno' waltzed up to an Oscar nomination thanks to the success this little yellow bus and even this years `Slumdog Millionaire' is being called the `Little Film that Could'.
115;It's actually quite common and not very imaginative when you think about it.
116;Stuck in the middle is young impressionable Olive who just wants to be pretty.
117;everything that can go wrong does go wrong, but tagged onto the end of this comedy is a message of togetherness and family"
118;"breslin is a natural talent
119;One friend of mine said that he never caught her acting, which is very true.
120;I have always liked Kinnear and I found his turn here probably best in show.
121;He was superbly entertaining and understandable as the controlling father obsessed with winning.
122;Toni Collette continues shining her beacon of light on everything she touches"
123;Honestly I fell that AMPA's got this one right, and I know that not many agree with me there.
124;I thought that Arkin was very genuine and heartwarming here, even at his crudest.
125;He stepped up his game in a HUGE way the following year with a stellar performance in `There Will Be Blood'.
126;truth be told, the funniest parts in this movie involve running, and just the sight of any of the cast barreling down a street or a parking lot gives me the giggles.
127;It's fun, but not great.
128;This movie just brings memories of my own life and family experiences.
129;It was also shot in my hometown where I have great memories as well.
130;great acting, very funny, but behind the comedy there is a very real feeling to this movie.
131;the score is great, one of the best by Mychael Danna and Devotchka.
132;i'm still waiting to watch it with that certain someone!
133;This movie is very special to me.
134;I'll always be attached to this movie and I'm getting it the first day it comes out!
135;I caught a free screening of Little Miss Sunshine in Chicago the other day at the reccomendation of a friend of a friend.
136;I had seen previews for the film and I thought that it looked good, and when I learned that the producers were holding promotional pre.
137;mouth going, I was very excited.
138;She and her family pack themselves into an ancient VW bus and take a two day drive west.
139;He has taken a vow of silence and claims that he will keep it up until he achieves his goal of becoming a pilot.
140;He also is Olive's coreographer.
141;The film's climax at the pageant is amazing because it is both hilarious and creepy.
142;little Miss Sunshine is a great film that I think most people can enjoy.
143;Even if you claim not to like indie films, Steve Carrell alone is worth the ticket price.
144;I will say that his performance here is like nothing he's done before, but he is great playing this new kind of character.
145;A very funny, occasionally moving and at times disturbing look at a typically dysfunctional family on a road trip to a beauty contest for pre.
146;The entire cast is great .
147;Alan Arkin (who is hilarious) won the Oscar, but really any one of the six could have won.
148;What I like about Little Miss Sunshine the most is that it's a feel.
149;good movie that never feels corny or manipulative.
150;The film could be just as easily depressing and dark as it could be sappy and sentimental, but the two polar opposites keep the other in check and create a fun, quirky atmosphere.
151;Despite its flaws, I dare you to watch Little Miss Sunshine without cracking a smile and feeling good.
152;executed comedic moments in 'Little Miss Sunshine.'
153;I found myself laughing out loud many times.
154;I enjoy Toni Collette in pretty much everything.
155;She's good here, but the standouts are Greg Kinnear (his 'Nine Steps' Tony Robbins.
156;wannabe shtick is great stuff) and Steve Carrell.
157;From 'Talk Soup' and 'The Daily Show' respectively, these guys have turned themselves into wonderful actors.
158;In fact, the movie's best acting comes from Kinnear, especially in the scene where he sits in the audience at the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant and realizes .
159;In contrast, Murphy's take on James 'Thunder' Early in 'Dreamgirls' is a tour de force.
160;What I love about this film is the message that family will always be there for you.
161;The actors are also what made this movie a huge success.
162;"The real star is Abigail Breslin who is one of the best child actors out there
163;'Little Miss Sunshine' is an extremely well made film and its just like witnessing a family living right next door to you, and you are even more surprised when you find out how down to earth the charecters in the family are and are so genuine that you may even compare some of them with your close neighbors or people you may or maynot know.
164;Abigail Breslin simply steals the show, she is beyond words!
165;The film will surely entertain you, carry you along with its emotion.
166;Witness every inch of this unforgettable adventure of a family, you wont be dissapointed.
167;Oh yeah, that's a real hoot.
168;The dance scene near the end was kind of funny, and it was nice that some of the family found some common bond and became a little less dysfunctional at the end.
169;On the plus side, Abigail Breslin is very talented.
170;It is by far the best I have watched in a while.
171;It's hilarious and heartwarming at the same time, without venturing into cheeseball/emo territory (like the reprehensible Garden State.)
172;It does what every great piece of art does: it gives you a greater appreciation for those around you and for life itself.
173;Whenever the mood gets serious is usually when the biggest laughs are about to occur.
174;This deft balancing between laughs and seriousness is what makes this movie truly amazing.
175;The high points are some of the funniest moments you'll ever see in a movie.
176;The dinner table scene"
177;those scenes are transcendent comedy.
178;It will probably remind you of your own family in some ways as well.
179;the characters are all expertly crafted and portrayed.
180;They may be friends, co. workers, neighbors, family.
181;"This is truly what a ""family film"" should be, despite the R rating."
182;But I did enjoy it, kind of compared its feel to Bottle Rocket which I loved.
183;Steve Carrell is awesome in his role, and no matter who you are, you'll certainly find something amusing in this film.
184;My teenage children loved it too.
185;A treat to be enjoyed by young and old alike.
186;My husband who can't stay awake through the opening credits of a movie made it all the way through!
187;More of a drama than a comedy, this poignant film I believe is probably the best movie of 2006.
188;An unpredictable but uplifting ending.
189;Despite her external imperfections, her big heart, touching naivete and optimistic attitude will captivate you.
190;I guarantee you will walk out of this movie a better person and with a smile on your face.
191;This movie was not quite what we expected and started out rather strangely, but was pretty funny and kind of cute.
192;It means that one, big.
193;thanks for killing Captain America, Little Miss Sunshine!
194;I like quirky, independent films, and actually expected this to be more quirky after all I'd heard.
195;Made me smile a few times, maybe laughed once or twice.
196;One of the most incredible movie that I watched.
197;This movie is a comedy and a subtly satirical piece at the same time.
198;the main comic elements at first are Olive's family members and their neurotic interactions with one another.
199;Olive's family members realize that the love that ties them together proves to be stronger than their worries and problems.
200;If you like quirky films, this is one you have to watch.
201;fun with an all star cast, the story is so off the wall it will have you in stiches.
202;This movie has an awesome array of unique characters.
203;It's a great movie that most people can personally relate to.
204;"If life has ever tested you to your last wits and caused you to just say ""forget it!"""
205;then you will relate to this film.
206;and their journey will crack you up!
207;Trust me, you'll love this movie no matter what your age or general movie interests are!
208;Each member of the family has their own wacky problems, and you will find out about them as the movie rolls along.
209;Good writing truly makes this movie a winner.
210;I was laughing so hard I was crying for most of the movie, its that good.
211;That being said it is a fabulous drama.
212;"One of the best films of the year."""
213;This is movie is 'ok' at best.
214;It isnt the best of 2006 or 2005 or any year for that matter.
215;to be honest, in some of the scenes I felt kind of awkward, the scene between mom and dad at the hotel, dad dying, frank and that dude, the kid finding out about his eyes, the end of the beauty pageant?
216;Kinnear probably was the saving grace of the movie.
217;on the good side, it did kind of capture middle america pretty well.
218;I think brings us closer in our mind about what is FAMILY.
219;The message of this movie is so much more empowering and family value affirming than many of the other films out there that are marketed to families and teens.
220;A REAL family, with REAL probs.
221;Thanks to EVERYONE involved with it's creation!
222;I loved this movie from beginning to end.
223;And Olive, so perfect and pure, was so Christ.
224;like, so innocent and loving and accepting of each member of her crazy family.
225;It is delightful, and sad, and infuriating, and hilarious, and ridiculous, and obsurd, and right.
226;It is a fantastic movie.
227;enjoy movie to relax with, but especially grieved that this film has received so many accolades, a true reflection of how low we have sunk as a society.
228;"Also, the movie exploits the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" of the film, a delightful ten.year."
229;"Yep, great ""heartwarming"" family entertainment!"
230;One of my Top Ten best of all time.
231;A little sleeper of a film with the quintessential ensemble cast.
232;And it's funny to boot, not only in an ironic way, but in a groaning, laugh.
233;It's hard to see how anyone could have improved on this film, whcih accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do.
234;This is one of the few movies I have felt like walking out of.
235;never before has a story been so well told and equally acted.
236;Moving the audience to tears one moment and making us burst with laughter the next, this script was absolutely brilliant.
237;The first place contestant in a local New Mexico beauty pageant got eliminated and Olive, who'd came in second, is the default winner.
238;She's going to California for the Little Miss Sunshine finals.
239;Richard (Kinnear) is the only one who can drive a stick, so he has to go.
240;"But with him comes his ""are you a winner or loser"" motivational comments that irk everyone around him."
241;"A renowned Proust scholar, Frank found himself fired from his teaching job after falling in love with a student

243;He's also Abigail's instructor for her dance sequence in the upcoming competition.
244;each family members' personality, Olive (Breslin) is the unifying good.
245;natured persona that makes this entire flick so very watchable.
246;the dance sequence at the end of the film is something of movie legend.
247;Needless to say I cringed and laughed at the choreographer's choice.
248;The plot immediately kicks into gear when circumstances involving a default move Olive into the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant to be held in Redondo Beach CA.
249;off approach to events: he just lets life happen to him and laughs at it.
250;In that way, he's a good companion for high.
251;But he does his best by Olive, even helping her pick her music.
252;at the hilarious and inadvertent inappropriateness of it all.
253;in the end, though, this is a story about a family that sticks together.
254;It's a terrifically entertaining character.
255;driven piece, and features fine acting by all involved.
256;star"""" actors and extensive special effects are a dime a dozen these days."""
257;This film reaches those with visions of success and perfection, to the folks who have a crazy relative, or anyone who's ever been disgusted with the world of beauty and pageants.
258;There's something to be gained in this film for everyone.
259;"that is to say that despite a few ""contrived"" moments during the course of the film, the team of directors, actors, producers and staff are able to share a convincing picture of what it means to be a family experiencing all manner of adversity, and how they cope."
260;I never laughed anywhere here, but I did somewhat enjoy the film.
261;It's a real lowball indie.
262;Again, the little girl is the most impressive of the bunch.
263;Worth your time, but don't be taken by all the raves.
264;My hubby and I went and saw the movie and we both just loved it.
265;The story takes many twists and turns and has a great ending.
266;This movie isn't hilarious but it is definetly entertaining and worth a watch.
267;You will enjoy a few laughs and follow a great story line.
268;This is an original movie and I highly suggest you put it on your to.
269;Little Miss Sunshine is essentially a long set up for the very funny extended punch line that is its last five minutes.
270;"From an acting standpoint, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is an actor's showcase, which probably explains its Oscar success."
271;The story line has a lot of potential .
272;One of the funny movies you will watch over and over again with all the family.
273;It is so funny you can watch it again and find things you missed the first time.
274;All the characters are wonderful and quirky, there isnt one better than the other.
275;This movie was really funny.
276;The quirky characters are great.
277;I recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh.
278;"with one of the finest comedic ensembles of last five years (Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Steve Corell), ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is actually a lot of fun until Mr. Screenplay forces each member of the van load to have their ""moment."""
279;"handedly, and very conveniently experience a ""life changing situation/realization"" on their way to the titular competition."
280;(How else to explain a character's realization that he is colorblind, watching him freak out about this news, and then completely cool down and move on from the devastating moment .
281;before the lesson plan however, the film and its cast shine.
282;"caliber performance) plays ""Olive"", a character on the trip who is more or less the catalyst of the film."
283;Breslin is entirely convincing as the easily excitable glue that holds the misfit family together, and breezily steals her scenes away from her costars.
284;This little film about a family's adventurous journey to a beauty pageant is one of the best road trip films since National Lampoons Vacation (but better).
285;A fun, interesting and wonderfully done movie I gave as a gift to a friend who is housebound.
286;He absolutely loved it and wants a sequel.
287;And the acting, direction and other elements, such as music and visual touches, all rose to the level this work deserved.
288;The gentle way the satire rolled out was a welcome change from the more pointed mockery, exaggerated caricture, and heavy.
289;The masterful writing astonished me.
290;"That said, I think ""Dreamgirls"" is more deserving of a Best Pic nomination and after viewing this film that was one of my first reactions."
291;Most families will enjoy this because most families aren't mental about making their young daughters look like street women for a beauty contest.
292;I found this movie refreshing and I loved the family.
293;Each member was developed exceptionally well.
294;We see the typical family with it's highs and lows.
295;I recommend this if you enjoy melodramas.
296;"If you enjoyed this catch ""Best in Show"" and ""As Good as it Gets""."
297;"Oh, and now to make it even more ""funny"" let's make the horn on the VW continuously honk!"
298;I honestly thought it might be more like the old Shirley Temple movies.
299;if it was meant to depress people and to prove that children aren't safe with grandpa or dirty old mean, it accomplished it.
300;Any movie that does this for me is highly recommended.
301;Just an all around fun movie, And the grandfathers wisdom is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
302;A little fun for the whole family.
303;I was to watch this to study a screwball comedy.
304;This is such a cute movie!!
305;I loved all the actors.
306;I love indie films and this is one of my top 10!
307;Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin and Steve Carell make this indie black comedy at must see!
308;I am a fan of quirky, character.
309;I enjoyed the interaction among the family members, and enjoyed the social commentary with the beauty pageant scenes.
310;My jaw dropped at the very unexpected culmination of the pageant scene, but I found it a very fitting statement about these pageants.
311;I loved this movie, and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys quirky characters and pointed social commentary.
312;Yeah, I loved this movie.
313;This movie is laugh after laugh, and culminates with the best ending ever!
314;As the movie begins a clear dislike of everyone but the little girl develops, but then it starts to warm up.
315;One after another each family member shows a humanity, focusing on Olive.
316;With one mishap after another each member of the family develops a depth and snese of caring that helps them coalesce into a full and happy family.
317;This is just sick, and the movie makes this point very, very well.
318;Little Miss Sunshine was an excellent film, and I recommend it.
319;On this journey they learn the importance of love, and family.
320;One of the scenes revolves around color blindness, and that seems an apt metaphor for the blind spots otherwise intelligent people can have when it comes to seeing their own needs to love and be loved.
321;but in the short year since, he starred in a hit movie, The 40.
322;Year Old Virgin, as well as starring in a hit comedy series, The Office, for which he received an Emmy.
323;He also appeared in Will Ferrell's Anchorman, but the character he played.
324;the perfect storm of success changed their minds, and Carell was called upon to promote the film.
325;In fact, I just watched a little promotional clip on Amazon where he is actually interviewing himself, and both Carells do an excellent, though tongues firmly in cheeks, job of it.
326;He is cast well here.
327;Alan Arkin won an Oscar for best supporting actor, and though he only appears in the first half, his presence is felt throughout, and he thoroughly deserves his Oscar for this performance.
328;He would seem to be an unlikely target of sympathy, but beneath that rough exterior beats a heart of gold.
329;Abigail Breslin plays a young beauty contestant hopeful.
330;She is the Little Miss Sunshine of the title, but though you might think it is meant to be ironic and sarcastic, she is a hopeful ray of sunshine, without ever going too far into the excessive cuteness mode.
331;For being in such a dysfunctional family, she is remarkably well adjusted, and though nave about many things, she seems to have an emotional wisdom beyond her years.
332;She wears glasses, and good use some dental work.
333;But you keep hoping that her routine will hit a grand slam, but that possibility is remote considering her act was choregraphed by her recently deceased Grampa (Alan Arkin, in an Oscar winning supporting role).
334;This whole shtick of writing in the pad could get annoying, but actually is handled very well, as a great running gag.
335;Key moments of his character's transformation or turns of plot are conveyed very skillfully with this device.
336;Somewhere along the journey he goes through a subtle metamorphosis, and emerges as empathetic and sympathetic, while still avoiding the too.
337;It was a very strong ensemble cast, and she was the glue that held the dysfunctional family together.
338;I honestly never ever heard of this movie before, but it is freakin amazing!
339;honestly, this movie might make you tear a bit in some parts but it is hilarious and has a good meaning in the end: family is family no matter what.
340;But a must see if you have a sense of humor.
341;There's very little funny about it.
342;`Little Miss Sunshine' is the story of Olive, a cute but dumpy seven year old, obsessed with beauty pageants.
343;The last 20 to 30 minutes of this movie contain some of the most truly funny moments I have seen in a film in a long time.
344;If you think you can handle the language, then you should check this one out, it is definitely worth your time.
345;It contains good dark humour.
346;Many scenes made me laugh and broke my heart at the same time.
347;the next scene is hilarious when it showed the family trying to sneak the corpse into their car to continue their trip to California.
348;in the last scene, the director cleverly took aim at child.
349;She's so cute, lovely, and innocently funny.
350;She's naturally beautiful without any makeup.
351;But in my opinion, it's acceptable and funny.
352;"i saw this movie with a friend who thought the movie ""sucked"" while I thought it was an original screenplay with a refreshing end."
353;acting by all characters was superb.
354;Situations were one hillarious scene after the next, making the road trip from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach, CA one wild roadtrip.
355;the little girl was a genuine lore of sunshine.
356;good (if not outragious) aura.
357;kilter rhythm to it that keeps it from being, well, phenomenal.
358;"Pluses include outstanding performances all around, especially by Kinnear (the motivational father) and adorable Abigail Breslin (as Olive)
359;Overall verdict: enjoyable and worth repeated viewings, but certainly not the best film of the year.
360;Each character was beautifully crafted and executed to perfection.
361;Paul Dano killed in the role of Dwayne and hopefully we will see plenty more of him in the future.
362;I laughed past the point of tears and told everyone they must see this movie.
363;If you're a smartass, you'll love this film.
364;the family is actually the only source of support and solace available to the beleagered individuals depicted in the film as they each strive.
365;the pinnacle of the American Dream: the top spot, the """"winner."""
366;the wholesome Dad swears under his breath as his dream of a motivational.
367;the soundtrack, if you will, of the American Dream.
368;"Despite its wholesome veneer, the entire contest is deeply subversive of childhood, a bizarre distortion in which girls are made up to look like small adult women and perform ""Miss America"" type song."
369;a searing exaggeration of the contest's subtext of pushing adulthood onto little girls.
370;"though other bits of American life get similarly skewered, the key satire is of The American Dream of being a ""winner""."
371;"The film uses satire and parody to draw the distinction between the honor implicit in competing and the pathological emphasis now placed on ""winning the top spot"" in American society."
372;"The humor is very similar to that of ""Garden State"", so if you enjoyed Zach Braff and his hysterical dark humor, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" should hit you pretty well."
373;I think the humor sits well with college.
374;One reviewer gave a great recommendation.
375;(Either are really a far better choice.)
376;The movie starts out strong with a hilarious ensemble cast of eccentric characters.
377;Her father, Richard Hoover, is obsessed with winning.
378;"So he insists the family must make a last minute road trip to California so Olive can be a ""winner."""
379;The road trip portion of the film has it's funny moments.
380;"But then allow her to participate so she can fulfill her ""dream."""
381;centered ways and manage to unite as a family that loves and cares about each other.
382;"Only when they let go of this obsession with ""winning"" were the family able to come together and be happy."
383;Brother Dwayne sums it up best when he says it's better to just do what you love and forget the rest.
384;This is a sweet, charming and funny movie, definitely worth seeing.
385;"What a great, great movie ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is
386;That's a treat from the audience's point of view"
387;They often fight, they regularly swear, and they each have personalities that clash to an incredible degree.
388;No one in this film is a rigid caricature, and that made it worthwhile.
389;it's also a very funny film.
390;"loud kind of way
391;feels kind of way, presenting situations that the audience is able to understand and sympathize with.
392;It was an interesting storytelling method, especially since every main character in this film is forced to partake in something they would rather do without.
393;old girl who dreams of someday winning a beauty pageant.
394;Of course, Richard is certain that his new program.
395;For these reasons, he's now snorts heroine on a regular basis.
396;But some weeks later, Cheryl's sister calls and tells the family the good news: the first place winner of that contest has been disqualified (""""Something to do with diet pills!"""")"""
397;As you can probably imagine, this sends Olive into a whirlwind of excitement.
398;But more compelling are the emotional obstacles each character will have to clear in their own way.
399;The scenes in the van were probably the most significant in terms of allowing the characters to face their problems.
400;But it's Richard's dialogue that is the most priceless: he just can't get out of his you.
401;a. winner mode, constantly spewing his self.
402;"he praises Olive for this mindset
403;That's the kind of family we'd all like to have, especially when everyone can learn something valuable.
404;This is despite the fact that the world of children's beauty pageants hits them like a ton of bricks.
405;I will say that it all comes together in a way that's beautiful, funny, and touching all at the same time.
406;There's quite a bit one can learn from a movie like this, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to experience it.
407;It's actually much simpler than that"
408;"What a perfect message
409;The look on Greg Kinnear's face was priceless, and pretty well summed.
410;The performances by the entire cast were wonderful, particularly Alan Arkin.
411;I was also pleased by the directing.
412;The characters are all Quirky in that indie film way.
413;For those of you who are movie fans, imagine the fun in them driving into Scotsdale and someone saying to Greg Kinnear's character, """"Isn't this where Bob Crane died?"""""""
414;My family and I had so much fun watching this movie!!
415;All the characters were well developed and interesting.
416;Love Steve Carell, funny and quirky movie that I would recommend to everyone wanting a funny quirky type of movie experience!
417;It reels you in slowly at first and then that's it, you're hooked!
418;This is the best movie we have seen in a long time, my husband agrees.
419;My favorite part of the movie was the ending where it finally got a little funny.
420;"then you will probably appreciate the hilarious and poignant indie film ""Little Miss Sunshine."
421;Sheryl (Toni Collette) is Richard's wife and arguably the most normal and high.
422;functioning member of the family.
423;Their son, Dwayne (Paul Dano), is a nihilistic and remote 15.
424;Olive (Abigail Breslin) is the family's bright and effervescent 7.
425;when the family finally does arrive at the pageant, the weirdness well and truly begins.
426;When Olive is finally called upon to do her performance piece for the audience (a real show stopper which I won't spoil by detailing), she is actually the most wholesome and entertaining part of the whole pageant.
427;although this family bickers with one another almost constantly, they manage to close ranks and support each other when it truly counts.
428;Part of the pleasure of watching this film was the talented cast, who looked like they were really enjoying themselves.
429;A wonderful way to spend 90 minutes .
430;and you will probably come away with a deeper appreciation of your own family.
431;Olive surpassed all expectations society placed upon her.
432;I watched this movie in threater and it is so good.
433;I found this movie very heart warming movie.
434;A lot of people HATED Sideways simply because it was marketed as a pure hilarious comedy.
435;Sideways did have a lot of very funny lines and moments, but narrowminded viewers think that movies should only be in one category or the other.
436;"the dark comedy along with painful realizations of real life drama (losing a loved one, fighting social stereotypes and expectations) provides a beautiful build up for triumph
437;This is slow painful build up, gives the viewer such a release of happiness, which is the film's strongest point.
438;budget movie with great actors and quirky humor won Best Picture?
439;While very """"R"""" talking, the grandpa has a sweet relationship with his granddaughter that I've seen quite a few times and the angst."""
440;the casting is always essential in a movie and thankfully not a single cast member is interchangeable.
441;Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin and Paul Dano are note.
442;perfect as the father, mother, grandfather and the son respectively.
443;The 2 standouts are restrained Steve Carell who's likable and funny without being overbearingingly so in a Jim Carrey/Robin Williams way.
444;But the real star is actually Abigail Breslin.
445;It is uplifting and fun!
446;Peculiar, original, strange and bending towards the darker areas of the comedy genre, this art house film turned popular hit, is full of pleasant surprises with equally sad moments made hilarious.
447;there are two aspects about this film that has made it a great film, and that is its talented cast and off beat soundtrack due to the combined contributions of Mychael Danna and DeVotchka.
448;"The music adds to the film's originality and certainly is the right ""tone"" to the many pitfalls and basic bad luck that this dysfunctional family experience while on the road to California to have the youngest, Olive Hoover, compete in the Little Miss Sunshine contest."
449;Of course, Toni Collette as the mother manages to somehow keep her family together despite their ecentricities and the many mishaps that befall them: a wonderful and restrained performance.
450;although excellent performances by the entire cast, Olive, (Abigail Breslin) stole the show as Little Miss Sunshine, realistic and endearing, the end of the film, her dance number truly stole the show.
451;having heard so much positive talk about Little Miss Sunshine to finally see it, all expectations were met as it is original and very funny.4.5 stars.
452;To my surprise the movie was hilarious.
453;The funniest part of the movie was the end!!!
454;That little girl is hilarious.
455;This is a good movie, but not the funniest of the year by far, nor of all time.
456;I'ms still READING (note that word) the classics.
457;"A fine cast helped garner the critical acclaim that the feel good comedic drama, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" richly deserved."
458;They nonetheless pull together to assure that young Olive is able to fufill her destiny, the ability to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine contest.
459;the film has a terrific cast and each plays his or her role superbly.
460;Each makes a terrific contribution to the film, and given the special aspects of some of the characters, that is more of an achievement than you might at first expect.
461;Notice the difference in their individual happiness and joy as an extended family as they set aside these conditions and accept life for what it is offering at that moment.
462;One of them knows that all the way through the movie.
463;It is a film that will apeal to a broud audiance.
464;l was pleasantly surprised by the heart of this movie.
465;the grandpa, played by Alan Arkin, is wickedly candid and made the movie for me!
466;Overall it's simply a very cute movie reflecting real life angst with a sprinkle of exaggerated situations that kept me watching and rooting for the underdog!!
467;It also made me so upset that i cried.
468;This will become a classic.
469;It captures the struggle and dysfunction of the American family.
470;Great movie, full of wonderful characters .
471;story line is precious and darkly hysterical.
472;Watch and laugh, watch and laugh
473;A funny commentary on society's view of beauty as well as a look at a quirky family that seems to work in spite of itself.
474;Everyone in it is superb.
475;This is just a darn good movie.
476;This is the type of movie that makes you laugh in places where you didn't think you were going to laugh.
477;This is a great movie, but the 24.
478;Especially for families with young kids, it helps if the movie can be watched over the course of two evenings.
479;The DRM scheme still protects it.
480;Loved it and will watch it again.
481;The acting by everyone in this movie is wonderful.
482;Young Abigail Breslin is so enjoyable to watch.
483;So, Little Miss Sunshine is a rare movie.
484;Child beauty pageants, road trips, and drugs.
485;Yet, it manages to make them ironic and endearing.
486;With a drug and sex crazed grandfather whose wise cracks are actually wise to Abigail Breslin's genius debut as Olive, the one everyone has wrapped their hopes and dreams into, this cast delivers smart dialogue and inspired performances.
487;Life is nothing but a beauty pageant with everyone judging you all the time.
488;Wife and mom Shery is the peace.
489;"Little Olive, the darling of the family, won a trip to the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" beauty pageant, so the entire family piles into their dilapidated VW van for the 800."
490;Thank God for the Harris family!
491;She sweet even if the world around her isn't so.
492;The last ten minutes of this film are easily the best.
493;As for the other 90 minutes well that's up in the air.
494;There is a fine line between dark humor and just plain darkness.
495;You start to see some themes pop out that would make good talking points in an article or interview, but in the context of the film it's all just filler.
496;It has it's moments, and on the surface it is very sweet and charming.
497;Little Abigail Breslin steals the show, giving Olive a wisdom beyond her age, and a wide.
498;Little Miss Sunshine is a celebration of the differences that exist in pretty much all families but are afraid to admit it.
499;"No film has skewered the beauty pageant culture so expertly since Michael Ritchie's ""Smile"" in 1975."
500;The cast is uniformly excellent but special citations should go to Alan Arkin and Abigail Breslin.
501;Breslin, as Olive, has the formidable chore of being the optimistic glue that holds the Hoover clan together.
502;The tender scene between Arkin and Breslin prior to the pageant is heart.
503;"I first saw ""Little Miss Sunshine"" in a movie theater and was impressed with how original and funny it was
504;That in the depths of despair we can find reasons to laugh, and in our supreme happiness we suddenly find ourselves on the verge of tears.
505;This simple little film, beautifully directed and written, says more about the human condition and our responsibilities to one another as people than do more """"important"""" films like """"Babel"""" and """"Children of Men"""" and """"Flags of Our Fathers"""" combined."""
506;(And they're all good films, by the way.)
507;"Little Miss Sunshine will sneak up on and stick with you
508;It's profound without being pretentious, superbly performed, and very, very winning.
509;I think it's a classic, and the best picture of 2006, whether it wins the Oscar or not.
510;There are a number of funny bits, but overall the movie is closer to a tragedy than a comedy.
511;Abigail Breslin is perfect in the title role, and many of the adult actors' performances are quite funny"
512;But overall, the movie misfires almost as often as it succeeds.
513;I live in a fairly hip artist community in which movies are a basic conversation.
514;imagine my surprise at our chance to see a film everyone told me I would love and then actually love it.
515;And I thought the end sustained the rest of the movie.
516;the movie is about believing in yourself, and going forward.
517;Yes, there are similarities to oother films, but it is absolutely wonderful.
518;Funny, touching, heartbreaking and character driven.
519;"it is quirky, but totally creative in it""s own world."
520;alan Arkin is a national treasure, Carell and Kinnear do great serious work, Collette is always amazing, and Breslin anchors the piece.
521;I loved his work in a rather unlikeable first two acts.
522;even if everyone tells you to see it.
523;The reviews posted here tell about a brilliant satire that explores and reveals great subjects, grand topics, and enormous themes.
524;I believed every one of the reviews, which are brilliant in themselves, but I didn't find the movie at all the kind of film that informs and enlightens.
525;I loved the comedy, the acting, the wild story line, the goofy antics and odd displays of maladjustment, but I didn't get the feeling that great truths were being explored.
526;"The grandfather character was played so well by Alan Arkin that I began immediately to say the big ""O"" word, Oscar."
527;His every gesture and expression is the work of a master comic actor.
528;Christmas Day he loaded it into his imac pro laptop, and it would work.
529;The little girl in this movie is a fun full of life child living amongst all these struggles adults.
530;She truely has a positive loving outlook on life.
531;beauty that is Olive is expected to win the contest and thus lift this most.
532;the casting for this movie was spot on.
533;Everyone does a great job at playing his or her own miserable part.
534;Kinnear is perfect as a financially stressed motivational speaker/dad and Toni Collette is excellent as the end.
535;It is great to see a child star who can pull off a character such as this with a straight face.
536;If you don't see your own family in them, you'll definitely see your neighbors.
537;great movie 2 thumbs way up one should have this movie in their collection.
538;alan arkin is really good he deserves a couple of oscars for his role.
539;But even if you have to drive seven hundred miles in your broken VW Bug, and you have to push it half the way, it is well worth it.
540;This is an alternately hilarious, dark, and poignant movie, that measures family values (everyone cheers on the under.
541;let me just say how good it is to see a suburban family whose home is in shambles, and who has to come up with an amount of money everyone can spend when they go to Denny's.
542;They usually have big dinners that the mother cooks, and the kids are usually perfect, as are the obligatory live.
543;She brings home chicken and all of the side dishes that the restaurant includes.
544;the title refers to the beauty pageant that Olive has placed in, and the plot revolves around the family driving to Rodondo Beach, California.
545;Despite the late timing of my order, the item arrived in time for the holiday and in good condition.
546;The ending also touched my heart for the underdogs of this world.
547;"Another good movie I highly recommend is ""Secondhand Lions"" with Robert Duvall and Michael Caine."
548;"This movie is also like ""Little Miss Sunshine"" in that it will make you laugh and cry."
549;Oh, boy!Credit Michael Arndt whose script won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for this lineup and for a wonderful and strikingly original comedic and satirical romp through dysfunctional land.
550;Who will win?Alan Arkin won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and Abigail Breslin and the picture itself garnered Oscar nominations.
551;But see this for the writer.
552;Michael Arndt's warm, funny and highly original script has me (and half the screenwriters in Hollywood and New York) green with envy.
553;Every year there's that one movie that just makes you feel so good about yourself.
554;This year it's Little Miss Sunshine, and the sun sure was shining on us today as we watched this one.
555;"The best shot it has is Alan Arkin who plays ""Grandpa""."
556;placed comedic scenes in this film.
557;Breslin was fine in this film and has a career, if she doesn't fall into the child star syndrome.
558;Kinnear has been better, and I've never liked Toni Collette.
559;Unless you've lived in a cave in Tibet during the last 18 months, you know Carrell, and he's wonderful here as the suicidal, out.
560;His stark white outfit fits well against the bright banana (or should I say sun?)
561;I love this move and watch it every time I it comes on.
562;The whole cast is just amazing and the story is both funny, touching, crazy, and endearing all at the same time.
563;A great character study, but with heart.
564;beautiful, beautiful movie from beginning to end, and what an ending!
565;The 7 year old daughter is obsessed with beauty pageants.
566;The family embarks on a car trip to California to take the daughter to yet another beauty pageant.
567;If you like Black Humor, you'll like this film.
568;But if you're looking for some good laughs, and are willing to suspend your disbelief, you'll enjoy this one.
569;Perfect family entertainment for those who understand that all families are dysfunctional in some way.

602;What good thing could be said of this movie?
603;Little Miss Sunshine is a delightful, quirky summer comedy starring Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear.
604;This family puts the fun in dysfunctional with all their insecurities and other emotional issues that plagues them.
605;loving Dwayne was spot on.
606;Despite his pessimistic view of his family, he still loved them.
607;Steve Carrell was hilarious as Frank.
608;I loved the scene where he matches wit with Richard in the VW van.
609;Toni Collette was wonderful as Sheryl.
610;She has quickly become of my favorite actresses.
611;The films she choses to work in are impeccable and as Sheryl her performance certainly deserves to be recognized by the Golden Globes and/or the Oscars.
612;Her scenes in the last ten minutes of the film were hilarious.
613;Little Miss Sunshine is proof that summer films don't need special effects or big name actors.
614;Little Miss Sunshine proves that all you really need is a really good script and actors who are able to stay true to form as the characters they embody.
615;"Every year has at least one quirky movie that really captures your heart and imagination, and in the year 2006, that little movie was ""Little Miss Sunshine."
616;"But ""Little Miss Sunshine"" approaches the family dysfunction from a bizarre, smart, and sometimes slightly nuts perspective."
617;This indie movie deserves all the credit that is being heaped on it .
618;His wife Sheryl (Toni Colette) is on edge as Richard inflicts his nine.
619;if you're going to make a dark comedy about a family, then for crying out loud, give it a heart.
620;These people drive each other crazy, don't ever communicate, but they really do love each other .
621;He's not the only one: each character has his or her own odd spots, and a unique way of expressing it.
622;abigail Breslin is a simply brilliant little actress .
623;cute, yet not cutesy .
624;Instead, it's a little gem of an indie film.

627;esteem and what could be more important than that for any child.
628;It's a charmer written by first.
629;Co. directed by the husband and wife team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, this uproarious comedy obviously benefits from both perspectives in balancing the satirical elements with the subtleties of the character arcs in the Hoover family as we follow them in their dilapidated Volkswagen van.
630;eerie visions of JonBenet Ramsey will come back to you when you see the pageant climax itself but not before the actors inject a great deal of humanity into their performances.
631;Collette continues to impress with her unique combination of sharp intelligence and visceral emotionalism.
632;Veteran actor Alan Arkin is a welcome presence as Grandpa, and looking appropriately Goth.
633;like, Paul Dano is hilariously dead.
634;abigail Breslin is an unaffected joy as Olive, and she makes the most of the talent competition in the film's most winning moments.
635;"There are also memorable bits from Paula Newsome as a curt grief counselor
636;On the whole, however, this idiosyncratic road movie is well worth the ride share.
637;It is a funny movie and it is unfortunate that children can't see it.
638;The cast does a great job!
639;Well worth seeing, if only for two things: Steve Carell's performance, and one scene between between the two young siblings while they're on the road which reveals why this little girl is the life force of this eccentric family.
640;this is a great entertainment piece for you
641;The story is set in a Volswagen van on a trip to California for the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant.
642;The trip is a mix of angst and humor for all the characters except Olive, the Little Miss Sunshine contestant.

644;You have to be smart to understand this film and able to laugh at the on screen dysfunction because it is an accurate depiction of American families today.
645;one of my favorite movies of all times .
646;hilarious,my favorite actors too,best movie,comedy of all times
647;Everyone telling me in every way imaginable, """"Oh Ken you have to see this movie."""
648;We should watch his career with great intrigue.
649;intellectuals who think films like these are progressively artistic in their endeavors to speak to everyone in some way.
650;This film holds up to repeated viewing.
651;it has a terrific cast, insane but somehow credible situations.
652;overall, its delightful and timeless too.
653;whoever picked the characters and the actors to portray this family should have received an Academy Award.
654;Greg Kinnear is brilliant as the zealously motivated but oh.
655;I won't give anything away, but even they have fun.
656;This is one of those things that you just can't help but love and watch over and over again.
657;Olive wants to make it to the pagent, and when she finally does, with her family's help, the result is hilarious.
658;I did enjoy this movie.
659;It had an interesting kind of humor to it.
660;Priceless performances, laughs, drama, everything.
661;If you GET this movie (it's easy, so I hope you do) you'll cherish it forever.
662;this is in my top 5 of 06 with out a doubt.
663;loaded with dark comedy and touching moments.
664;Well, it was certainly the best movie *i saw*, and you have to like the comedy/drama genre.
665;But if you do, and if you like wes anderson's movies, then you will certainly enjoy this one.
666;Anyone who watched the Academy Awards this year must have noticed the look of surprise on Alan Arkin's face when he heard his name called as the winner of the Best Supporting Actor award.
667;As great an actor as he is, I felt Arkin spent far too little time in this film to be singled out for any serious Osar consideration.
668;which, for the most part, matches the performances as well.
669;I also found it hard to believe that this film had been nominated for best picture.
670;"By the way, if you really want to see a great example of a performance by a best supporting actor, watch ""Sunshine's"" Greg Kinnear in ""As Good As It Gets."""
671;Kinnear was nominated for his performance, but, like the film's great writer.
672;director, James L. Brooks, he was snubbed by Oscar that year.
673;Sunshine won the oscar for that category, too.
674;Really makes you wonder what the Academy is thinking these days.
675;I thought the acting and the characterization were wonderful.
676;The movie overall was not wonderful, a C+ at best.
677;It had a few funny moments.
678;Twisted, funny, emotional, heavy and sweet simultaneously.
679;it's comforting to think that such a family exists.
680;Greg Kinnear, always a joy, plays the father convinced of his own ability to sell a how.
681;old, but as she has the best outlook of all of them, perhaps that's the point).
682;Olive's mission, however, in an absolutely priceless performance among her peers .
683;brings a fractured family together as nothing else can.
684;good movies I have had the pleasure to watch in a very long time.
685;This is one of the best movies I've seen.
686;"This is ""quirky"" taken to its logical conclusion ."
687;Early in the movie, we're introduced to her family and get a sense of what's about to come.
688;Parts of this are laugh.
689;loud hilarious and parts of it are shed.
690;the family finally makes it to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant and, just when you thought the roadblocks were hurdled, more issues arise.
691;"Little Miss Sunshine is still its own movie and is a big step above what was delivered in ""Vacation."""
692;"To me, the movies are similar enough that if you enjoyed ""Vacation,"" you'll enjoy ""Little Miss Sunshine."""
693;busting comedy into the realm of being a smart comedy with just enough realism to hit home.
694;Makes us reflect on the ambiguity of our American way.
695;Its an amazing indie film with a superb cast (Breslin, Carell, Arkin etc.)!
696;So real but with a warm ending!
697;"That's to say, you like everything ""perfect""."
698;the story's very simple, so simple it's such an achievement.
699;sheryl's the wife and mother, who works a steady job and is probably the most normal.
700;He's determined to become a test pilot, and has taken a vow of silence till he reaches that goal, though it hits a screeching halt.
701;He got evicted from a rest home after he started snorting heroin.
702;Combine those characters with a hilarious script, amazing music, and a fine dose of reality, and you've got Little Miss Sunshine.
703;Little Miss Sunshine is a good drama about family and how not everyone's is perfect, definitely nothing like you would see on the early days of television.
704;This movie does have a few funny moments, but mainly focuses on the problems that families have.
705;As you can see, this movie isn't a family film, but it is great none.
706;The acting in the film is great, I was happy when they were and was sad when they were as well.
707;except Dayton and Faris make it all seem amusing.
708;little Miss Sunshine takes postmodernism and places it into the form of film.
709;overall, LMS is a fun, funny, and wonderful slice of Americana.
710;definitely not my favorite movie, but definitely worth watching.
711;It will move you, make you laugh, and you will lose yourself in it.
712;I have seen this movie a number of times, including at the theater.
713;It has a lot of drama as well as humor.
714;My family has always been known for our unusual sense of humor.
715;I enjoyed it very much, but I can think of more people who would be annoyed by it than entertained.
716;If you find humor in the everyday being turned into slightly absurd then you will like this.
717;"If you enjoy ""you can't do that in a movie"" humor then you will love this."
718;I think it was a brilliant mix of drama and humor.
719;good movie that keeps on keeping on.
720;state ride in a VW bus hilarious.
721;This film succeeds in some ways.
722;Its characters were well drawn, you cared about them and the movie exalts interfamily cohesiveness and caring, which is clearly the main point of the film.
723;Little Miss Sunshine is a family road movie with heart.
724;All the performances are excellent, especially Steve Carell in a wonderfully understated performance as the depressed brother Frank.
725;eyed innocence and hopeful optimism stands in sharp contrast to the cynicism and depression of her damaged family.
726;year old Breslin gives a completely natural performance and more than holds her own with the all.
727;"if you like quirky heartfelt films like ""About a Boy"" and ""You Can Count on Me"", you'll love Little Miss Sunshine."
728;and being a winner of a film based on so many potentially disastrous bits of black comedy works exceedingly well!
729;As opposed to some of the movies of the recent past (Borat, American Pie, Waiting, the National Lampoon endless series, etc) LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE starts with a smart script by Michael Arndt that addresses many of the highly dysfunctional family elements present in today's society and allows us to hold a few mirrors up to our own vaguely warped view of good and bad, right and wrong, ambition and self destructive delusion and makes us laugh .
730;Along the trip we get to know these oddballs personally and in the end the results of the family effort competition seem almost secondary to the fun of getting there.
731;Each of the performers is at peak form in acting and the direction and pacing would be difficult to improve.
732;The film accomplishes what comedy sets as a goal: it entertains us while allowing us to take a second look at our own foibles, and that makes for a fun and healthy outing.
733;A great movie that starts off depressing and ends with a burst.
734;I'm using this great movie in a college class to open up discussion on family issues in U. s. society.
735;And this film offers issues galore!
736;First, Paul Dano (the son, Dwayne) is really great with facial expressions and emotion.
737;Thing is, you can't SNORT heroin.
738;Its very well written, but was that much cursing really neccesary?
739;I had heard and read that it was one of the funniest movies in years etc.
740;this movies is good to watch I needed it for a school project on disablities.
741;it is a good movies for that
742;I gave this movie four stars because I found it extremely entertaining.
743;The acting was really top notch and what sets the film apart.
744;Just watch, and you will know what I mean.
745;Her energetic personality was a perfect contrast to the stark despair that existed in many of the other characters.
746;The movie's theme is best summarized in a Proust quote that Carell delivers in a very poignant moment towards the end of the film.
747;It is a small budget film about a road trip a family takes so that the youngest member can participate in a fancy competition.
748;The film has an impressive start and by the tenth minute, all the characters are introduced in a very effective way.
749;His dialogues are to the point and hilarious, his quotes are unforgettable.
750;I carried one with me after the movie ended.
751;Coming to my favourite character, Steve Carell was very good.
752;His run is funny, his silent un.
753;paul Dano (the 15 year old kid) is actually 23 and his character was very interesting as well.
754;He speaks in that scene.
755;the last scene is absolutely HILARIOUS, though.
756;This is an incredibly funny movie about a wacky, dysfunctional family with a happy ending in which everyone manages to pull together against all odds.
757;So we watched it right away, and it didn't disappoint.
758;We cried, we laughed, we cried some more, and we laughed a lot.
759;There are plenty of kids movies out this holiday season already.
760;this movie is raw and emotional.
761;Actually, Richard pretty much shouts at everyone.
762;Grandpa swears, is practically obsessed with sex, and snorts heroine, as others have mentioned.
763;But he was also in WWII, so I figure he earned the right to do just about anything he wants.
764;It's great to see Hollywood doing movies that aren't all sugary and sweet, but deal with real problems of real people, in a real way without neatly wrapped up endings.
765;Little Miss Sunshine is as good as comedy gets.
766;If you can see only one funny movie this summer.
767;run to see this one while it's still in the cool theatres.

772;Little Miss Sunshine is a story of a family that makes a cross country trip for a pagent for their young daughter.
773;You won't find to many movies like this, it's odd, and awkwardly times humor make it funny, yet uncomfortable.
774;good sense out of it.
775;It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a movie as much as I did Little Miss Sunshine.
776;It was the true laughter through tears movie.
777;and I was able to connect with each character.
778;Both films are about family and what pulls them apart and what holds them together.
779;Toni Collette is Ma Joad: keeping the family together is everything.
780;a. long who finds his soul.
781;sharon who certainly is able to bring life and hope to a family in need of both.
782;"what a great film that can take you apart and bring make you better and so much more appreciative of being a member of a ""real"" family."
783;this movie is as black a piece of humour as you can find.
784;Possibly not even the title hero is quite right in her mind, but let us be generous.
785;Whoever found it and popularized it deserves a special praise.
786;It is even better, all by itself, than Greg Kinnear's wonderful lecture on refusing to lose.
787;it is so realistic, you could shed tears over it.
788;It is so funny, you can hardly ever laugh, seriously.
789;The best film I've seen in years.
790;so original, you will cry laughing from begining to end.
791;And the best part of it all, the daughter performing a strip tease act at the Little Miss Sunshine contest.
792;Hollywood is really giving us the movies that we need to see?????
793;Fantastic acting lets you believe this story is taking place, and how great it is to be along for the ride.
794;how i would have done it)ok,a regular uncle isnt funny or gimmicky.
795;some animal thats not a popular choice but is loved nonetheless.
796;even more,have her be good at it.
797;have her be good at her tricks while still involving said animals and have rick james be her soundtrack.
798;A wonderful gem of a film.
799;Hilarious at times (especially the scenes with grandpa, played by Alan Arkin), touching and sad at others, this film touches all the right emotions and makes for a great ride to a hilarious ending at a silly and creepy beauty pageant for little girls.
800;Little Olive (Abigail Breslin) sparkles and charms throughout.
801;I laughed until I cried.
802;This is just a great little gem of a movie, with wonderful performances by Steve Carrell and Abigail Breslin and Alan Arkin.
803;Sweet with just the right amount of edge.
804;If you like offbeat, dark humor, you will find this movie hilarious.
805;This dark comedy is the best movie of 2006!
806;The ensemble cast is amazing.
807;all are worthy of Best Supporting Acting Oscars.
808;This movie, aside from 300, is my favorite of this year.
809;It's amazing to me how the lives of an entire family can be wrapped into an hour and a half of disc time.
810;I have introduced it to all of my friends and they all loved it.
811;I don't want to give away the ending but Rick James works his way into the movie.
812;Granpa truly gave her the gift that keeps on giving.
813;Little Miss Sunshine takes a humorous look at the dysfunctional make up of an average family.
814;Life is good when the family finally comes together.
815;but his plot would be an organic byproduct of some quirky honest dialogue.
816;what's inspiring, uplifting, useful, timely about this message?
817;I watched it and though I was not bowled over with the idea of how great a movie it was I certainly laughed in many places and was surprised by the talent segment in the pageant scene.
818;When the granddaughter asks if she is pretty he says she is beautiful and that he is completely in love with her.
819;He then states the reason why is not because of her brain, or her personality, but because she of how beautiful she is.
820;So many hilarious scenes that keep you laughing weeks after you even watch the movie.
821;"It's got a great story line too, the audience comes out feeling, ""if they can make it work, maybe my family has hope too."""
822;You absolutely have to watch the very ending, its the funniest scene in the entire movie, hands down.
823;And guess what the wonderful break through this family makes is?
824;in fact he commits suicide, another inspirational moment of the film .
825;if this is our new world vision of the family of the future, of an inspirational family in any form whatsoever, God help us.
826;It's a movie for all ages and the presentation is colorful.
827;Dysfunctional family + road trip = Hollywood goldIn all seriousness, this independent film surprised many.
828;It's offbeat, and boasts excellent performances by the entire cast.
829;This movie is absolute perfection.
830;This is one of those movies that everyone needs to see.
831;It is filled with characters that are brilliantly acted and quickly become people we know.
832;Its good and full of sarcasm.
833;Heck, there was even a line where Steve Carell said something like.your most miserable times are more important than happy times, because they bring out the best in you.
834;It is easy to see why it won an Academy Award for Best Picture.
835;Rarely does a movie stay entertaining and engaging from opening to closing credits, but this film bats 1000.
836;The movie was in perfect condition and arrived a day before it came out everywhere!!!
837;Little Miss Sunshine has a lot going for it: all.
838;star cast, OK writing, decent premise and an adorable child star.
839;Suddenly, Olive has a shot at the Little Miss Sunshine crown .
840;"if only her dysfunctional family can get its act together and help her get to the contest!LMS is another in a long line of ""funny"" movies about dysfunctional families."
841;Uncle tried slit his wrists .
842;i also found that the movie misfired in its attempt to satirize pre.
843;there was a very human and very funny movie lurking inside LMS.
844;In other words, the film is enjoyable to watch, until the ending, and becomes less and less enjoyable the more you think about it after it ends.
845;this film started strong with the funny family and the touching bond between Olive and her brother Dwayne.
846;social loser beset by family problems redeemed by confident funky dancing.
847;It was so funny I wanted all my friends to see it.
848;It's been lent out ever since I got it.
849;Everyone I loan it to loves it.
850;There will be at least one character everyone can relate to.
851;I quite enjoyed this movie.
852;I'm generally a heavy drama/action guy but this blend of laughter and soul.
853;Little Miss Sunshine is one of those rare films that will actually move you.
854;What on the surface appears to be a dark road comedy about a dysfunctional family, is at its a heart a celebration of what makes a family.
855;finalist in a beauty pageant, the family sets out to California in a VW bus.
856;"From the film's opening moments, with the memorable, poignant score and the dad (played by the underrated Kinnear) giving a motivational speech to a small, nearly empty room on his ""9 Steps"" to becoming a ""winner,"" it's obvious ""Little Miss Sunshine"" could be something special."
857;to go into the details of each of the characters would be redundant, as most other reviews here seem to have that covered, but it's important to note that the entire cast shines.
858;"Nobody's phoning it in here
859;This is essential because much of the comedy stems from the characters and the dialogue.
860;Even the occassional moment of physical comedy (the way Carrell's character runs, for example), is subtle and character.
861;based, and for that matter, effective.
862;Each character gets their moment in the sun, and """"Little Miss Sunshine"""" is filled with memorable moments because of it."""
863;Every scene in the movie doesn't just advance the plot or makes us laugh, it also reveals the nature of the characters.
864;It's also wise enough to know that those mishaps are the moments you'll look back on with your family and laugh about, perhaps even cherish.
865;it all builds to one of the most rewarding and enjoyable payoffs in recent years.
866;This is a truly heartwarming movie that manages to charm and convey its message using dark humor and adult honesty, instead of through the sappiness or Hallmark sentiments of most Hollywood products.
867;"I haven't seen all the big films of 2006 (such as Babel, Letters from Iwo Jima, or Pan's Labyrinth), but ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is one of those true crowd pleasers that appeal to both low and high brow audiences, and it's one of those movies that gets better with each viewing."
868;the funniest dirty old man ever and a very funny script make this a winner
869;This definitely got a lot of attention by movie goers as well as the accolades if it's peers.
870;Really cute movie if you really pay attention to it from the beginning.
871;Not the best movie I have seen, but it is still pretty good.
872;And a family was portrayed with very real problems, and very unreal effects of those problems on the family members.
873;It's unbelievable to me that so many people liked it!
874;In all honesty, the funniest part of the movie was when they got to CA and the door fell off of the van (and that only got maybe half of a smile).
875;You'll fall in love with this movie as you watch this quirky family take a road trip of sorts in their Volkswagon van which has it's own quirky issues.
876;This family is very entertaining!
877;Little Miss Sunshine brings to light the quirks in everyday life that we all experience but seldomly reflect on.
878;The characters remind us of people in our lives, people we've met, and people we hope we never meet.
879;This movie is fantastic if, for no other reason, because it accurately conveys how truly bizarre and human nature is.
880;Definitely the best movie of 2006.
881;This film has a brilliant script, amazing cast, and flawless humor.
882;I saw this with a group of friends who didn't know much about the film.
883;That's pretty much the feeling for the first half of the film, but once the characters are established, the viewer is set up for one of the most charming displays of a family bonding ever in a film.
884;the family is extremely messed up.
885;after watching this I thought it was very funny and thought.
886;Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear are totally believable and utterly great as the struggling couple, trying their best to keep themselves going for the sake of their determined daughter.
887;Abigail Breslin is adorable and perfect in the role of Olive, and does all the right things to make us really love her as if she were our own sister or daughter.
888;Steve Carrell and Alan Arkin deliver subtle yet wonderful performances as well, though I wish Arkin had more screen time (this was the film's only lacking point).
889;Paul Dano was absolutely spot.
890;Little Miss Sunshine is one of the most enjoyable comedy films I have seen this past movie year.
891;This film is the funniest, most truthful, joyous, and moving thing I've seen all year.
892;There is the one type where you are glad they're not your family, but you can still appreciate and like them.
893;what is nice about such directors like Woody Allen, is that you can typically relate to any family in there, one way or another.
894;And mind you, I don't need a film that I can relate to that I can like, but it does help some.
895;If you can endure the foul language and constant talking about sex at the beginning, the movie is good.
896;This could have been a really great movie if handled properly.
897;One of my all time favorites.
898;"Olive (played by the adorable and very funny Abigail Breslin) has just been accepted into the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" beauty pageant (because of a cancellation) and her family decides to drive through three states so she can make the competition on time."
899;Richard Hoover (played by former Talk Soup host, Greg Kinnear) is Oliver's dad who believes that winning is number one.
900;cream (because there aren't any fat Miss America contestants) I thought it was both extremely funny and also equally sad.
901;"And rounding out this ensemble cast is Uncle Frank (played by ""Forty Year Old Virgin"" star Steve Carell.)"
902;There are so many funny moments in this picture.
903;It was also touching to see Olive put her head on her brother's shoulder to try to cheer him up, and I did suspect at that moment that Dwayne actually didn't hate everyone because he seemed so sensitive.
904;"time ""Malcolm In The Middle"" star Beth Grant) goes absolutely BERSERK!"
905;but I suppose family is whatever you make of it and the Hoover family must have really loved each other to go through all they did and still stay together.
906;i reluctantly went to go see this movie after a friend told me how good it was.
907;And I am so glad that I went because this was one of the best movies I have seen in months.
908;It is dysfunction at it's funniest!
909;Little Miss Sunshine is a wonderful story of a dysfunctional family reunited on a car trip across the Southwest United States.
910;It is very funny and tells its story without killing the viewer with emotional exhibition.
911;Loved the ironic message at the end about the little girl pageants.
912;The uncle is the nation's foremost Proust scholar, and decides to emulate the great writer by screwing up his life and almost taking it.
913;I ended up watching the rest the next day.
914;A great ensemble cast delivers a dynamite screenplay with a deft comic touch and sense of timing.
915;"This is easily one of the best ""road movie"" comedies I've ever seen."
916;I loved the strength of the surprise element on the ending in that you just couldn't see the train coming before it hit you.
917;i've really enjoyed Alan Arkin over the years but this performance here has to rank among his best.
918;Incredibly funny, and deeply touching without being sappy.
919;The casting is perfect, and the message truly hits home.
920;A husband and wife embark on a road trip to California, hoping to enter their 7.
921;They are, in essence, a group of individuals dealing with enormous personal problems, yet joined in their love for little Olive and their desire to see her perform in a competition that's the highlight of her short life.
922;this hilarious independent film is bound to make all viewers laugh, as they see elements of dysfunction and drama common to all families.
923;Little Miss Sunshine is a comedy with an indie feel and follows a family as they transport their daughter (Olive played by Abigail Brensen) to a children's beauty pageant via their VW bus.
924;The movie is perfectly cast with many good comic actors, Greg Kinnear (determined Father), Steve Carell (suicidal Uncle), Alan Arkin (cracked out Grandfather), Toni Collette (seemingly functional Mother).
925;Abigail Brensen and Paul Dano (Dwayne, Olive's brother) really outshine in their roles.
926;The brother Dwayne does not even speak in his scenes for the majority of the movie but gives fantastic presence regardless.
927;They are a very funny, very dysfunctional family.
928;Their destination is the Little Miss Sunshine competition in Redondo Beach, California.
929;olive, the young, slightly overweight daughter of the Hoovers who has earned a spot in the competition, is the principle character here.
930;She seems to be the force that brings this eclectic family unit together, and it is through her that all the members of the Hoover family find commonality and loyalty toward once another.
931;"perhaps the wittiest film of 2006, Little Miss Sunshine is at times vulgar and will make you squirm a bit, but the subject matter is all about the fine trimmings of family and the message is clear during the last, nutty segments of the film, ""Family is family, and you've only got one, so get over your differences and DANCE, baby!"""
932;it's a touching and somewhat disturbing story thrown together with a huge amount of laughs.
933;I really enjoyed this movie.
934;This is part road trip comedy and part disfuncional family drama.
935;they had their problems, things got in their way, but they realized that if they stick together as a family they can overcome the odds, all the while learning more about themselves in the process.
936;I would recommend this movie to anyone that's sick of all these teen comedies and bathroom humor and just wants a good, clean laugh.
937;Made by an independent filmmaker, Little Miss Sunshine brings out the best of the indie genre and, in my book, is an instant classic.
938;man show into something spectacular.
939;the daughter, Olive (Abigail Breslin), an adorable young girl has fantasies of winning the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant.
940;Still, this is her dream, and her family supports her enough to throw themselves in their VW van and drive hundreds of miles to get her into the pageant.
941;the mother, Sheryl (Toni Collete) is the necessary straight character, and certainly the sanest of the bunch.
942;Her presence holds everyone together.
943;with a cast of characters like this, it's impossible for a fantastic voyage not to occur.
944;From the van breaking down so that it can only be started by everyone getting out and pushing to an improbable hospital escape, the adventure is a lively one.
945;We have to, because she's easily the most endearing character in the film.
946;olive's dance presentation, the final of the evening, is hysterical.
947;She begins to dance .
948;and from the very first move, the audience is in hysterics.
949;"Richard dreams of becoming a motivational speaker
950;part of the enjoyment .
951;its a good tho overpraised movie.
952;i liked the cast most of all, especially greg kinnear who is as usual underrated.
953;alan arkin, of course, is alan arkin: giving the quintessential supporting performance as the raunchy heroin.
954;Spoilers below:This movie encapsulates the American obsession with success, and more noteably not being a loser.
955;The line in the title of my review is given by Olive, and it is just heart breaking when she delivers it.
956;It is her Grandpa's reply to Olive which is reassuring and touching.
957;The movie opens with Olive viewing the moment when a contestant for Miss America (or the equivalent) learns that she has been named Miss America.
958;the other characters in the movie are:Richard, played by Greg Kinnear, is a wanna be motivational speaker"
959;as each one of these character's dreams comes to naught, the family has to grow closer and closer together.
960;Olive's hug of her brother after his realization that he will never attain his dream, and he decides to join her on her quest, is quite touching.
961;and finally the metaphor of the yellow VW bus, the one that can not be driven with out the entire family pushing it, is perfect.
962;It could be the incredible way they draw humor out of stressful situations and family dysfunction.
963;It could be the wonderful score, largely adaptations from DeVotchKa's amazing album,How It Ends.
964;It could be the insightful cinematography that manages to capture the serene beauty of highway interchanges and oil drills and other unnatural things we usually view as ugly.
965;rate cast is obviously having fun.
966;The writing is sheer genius and the direction is impeccable.
967;Thanks to everybody involved with the making of this film.
968;I absolutely loved this movie.
969;"subtle jab at the ""Little Miss"" Beauty contests skillfully illustrates up how bizarre that industry really is."
970;The characters were well developed and the ending was a winner!!
971;I give it 2 stars for originality and good performances.
972;I watched the movie when it first came out and loved it.
973;It is so funny and I laughed so hard my sides hurt.
974;It's not a perfect film, but it is definately entertaining, very funny at times and worth watching.
975;there are no huge stars in this film, but there's an impressive cast of actors that you kind of recognize from small parts in other movies.
976;She is terrific and I'll never order ala mode without hearing her order her waffle ala modee.
977;This movie is so delightful.
978;It has every element that a film should have: laughter, tears, reflections on your own life.
979;There is a little of all of us in each of these characters.
980;And just watching their everyday struggle is an inspiration.
981;I just finished watching this movie and was very pleasantly surprised by it.
982;I really liked this movie.
983;There was something real and refreshing about it.
984;That's pretty much all I have to say.
985;I was laughing throughout the entire movie!
986;This film is a breath of fresh air.
987;in the midst of this dysfunctionality is one bright spot .
988;Olive's innocence, guile, trust and lovingness that bring child's realness and love to the family.
989;When it really matters, the family pulls itself together around this shared love and defends it against what can truly be described as horrific pathological expression of adult narcissism: a beauty pageant for little kids.
990;The movie is actually funny and entertaining.
991;Its simplicity is profound, and its message touching.
992;It reminds the soul of what really matters.
993;So that when one leaves the cinema, one feels more present and alive.
994;a feel good movie with some laughs.
995;The acting was great, the story line cute and an overall enjoyable viewing.
996;This is a truly quirky movie that is well produced and worth watching, but it's hard to know what you're left with when it's done.
997;The characters ring fairly true, and I guess that's the biggest strength of the film.
998;The most sympathetic characters for me were Frank, who has recently attempted suicide .
999;They certainly did succeed in pointing up the dissonance between what we worship and what we are in everyday life.
1000;if you haven't seen this movie yet, it's worth it.
1001;Olive is a little girl who dreams of winning a beauty pageant.
1002;top moments, some of which are funny and some of which are merely tasteless.
1003;The most heartwarming moment in the film occurs when the family has a rare show of solidarity when they serve as back.
1004;Olive is a refreshing contrast to the Jon Benet Ramsey look.
1005;This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.
1006;Her innocence while depicting the underlying truth that few face about the weirdness of child pageants makes the film.
1007;And it turns out that despite the family dysfunction people always talk about in this film, it is clear that she .
1008;is loved for who she actually is and not for who they pretend to be.
1009;And I laughed so hard I had to put my face in my hands because it hurt.
1010;Olive's dream is to become a beauty queen and the opening scene shows her watching a beauty pageant and imitating the winner.
1011;"the father, Richard (played by Greg Kinnear) is the inventor of a ""9 Step Program"" on being a ""winner"" and his opinions on avoiding loserdom are quite funny."
1012;sheryl, the mother, is a divorcee .
1013;She appears to be the glue that holds everyone together.
1014;He has many vices all of which add a lot of humor to the picture.
1015;"He is Olive's ""coach"" for her beauty pageant."
1016;okay, so mix all these people up with their problems, and the movie is an absolute trip.
1017;but overall, the movie, to me, had a positive vibe.
1018;She is a plain girl, with a bit of a belly and big bucked teeth.
1019;They stand behind Olive in pursuing her dream (win or lose) with confidence, and to me, that was very uplifting and positive.
1020;overall I thought Little Miss Sunshine was supremely funny and very well made.
1021;This is one of the best films of the year, and the first movie that deserves some attention from Oscar voters.
1022;The story is about a family who takes a road trip to enter their daughter into the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant.
1023;We start the story and our ensamble cast is introduced one by one.
1024;What follows is a heartwarming, emotional, and hilarious journey.
1025;Each character finds their own personal journey through Olive.
1026;Olive is the center of the film that holds the family together.
1027;A great scene in the film has Dwayne, the rebel son, refusing to get off the side of the road and continue with the trip even though everyone else is trying to comfort him into getting back in the car.
1028;Then his sister comes and rests her hand on his shoulder, he looks up at her, gets up and carries her back to the car.
1029;The film addresses many of life's problems and basically shows how it's all one big beauty pageant, but of course beauty doesn't matter at all.
1030;aCTING: The film is filled with an incredible cast, and I mean incredible.
1031;Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, Paul Dano, Steve Carell, and Abigail Breslin all give outstanding performances.
1032;Steve Carell is an amazing actor and I really feel like he's going to get nominated for his role here.
1033;The film is truly something special and the script definately calls for an ensamble, which they deliver.
1034;Who new that this first time screenwriter would produce such a rich script.
1035;You also have to acknowledge the superb directing from real life married couple, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris.
1036;Another Xmas gift to one of my kids.
1037;This is a must see for everyone, especially those of us in dysfunctional families who believe we're going to make it.
1038;This was honestly one of the best movies I've seen all year.
1039;What a fun movie this is.
1040;This is no sanitized, perfectly set movie.
1041;"It's gritty, uses ""real"" sets and has a quiet wonderfulness about it."
1042;"Alan Arkin is priceless as the grandfather
1043;follow this quirky family cross country as they take their gem to a beauty contest.
1044;What follows is a hilarious road trip that will keep you smiling.
1045;Nice movie about life and how people can overcome any challenges Great for people living based on status to watch
1046;I love watching this movie over and over again.
1047;This movie has great characters.
1048;I am happy with this movie.
1049;In doing so, they craft a last scene full of all the comedic command of Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, an up and coming little Abigail Breslin, other members of this stupendous cast, and a certain funky number by the late Rick James.
1050;It will break your heart.
1051;It's funny, but it was never seriously considered.
1052;Personally I think Little Miss Sunshine is the best movie of 2006.
1053;I swear it just keeps getting funnier every time I watch it!
1054;each actor captures their role so perfectly (I especially love Paul Dano as Dwayne).
1055;My congrats to Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris on a fine piece of work (and of course Michael Arndt for his brilliant screenplay).
1056;Little Miss Sunshine is easily my pick for best film of the year.
1057;It's a dark comedy, but it's also something else altogether.
1058;believe that the performances tip the balance in favor of genius.
1059;Alan Arkin is extraordinary as the cantankerous, heroin snorting grandpa with a heart.
1060;Watch the movie and you'll see what I'm talking about.)
1061;And here's something that's entirely refreshing: a seven year.
1062;She sold it, and I bought every tear and toothy grin.
1063;the opening sequence introduces the characters and their particular quirks in a series of one.
1064;minute shots, so the audience member knows right from the beginning who these people are and basically what's wrong with them.
1065;In fact, Little Miss Sunshine accomplishes the nearly impossible and makes us grateful for the tragedies that occur, because that's when we get to see who the characters really are.
1066;Nobody ever says the right thing in this movie.
1067;be prepared to laugh, hard and often, so much so that you won't see it coming when it's time to cry.
1068;But regardless of how original you do or don't think this movie is, it delivers some big surprises.
1069;But nevertheless Sunshine offers a good mix of strong emotion and light.
1070;For all you who would prefer slapstick, there's a good dose of that too, along with some pretty funny one.
1071;In this era of big money, Hollywood blockbuster productions (""""Harry Potter"""", """"Spiderman"""" ETC.) it feels most satisfying to find a small, amiable, entertaining, film comedy like """"Little Miss Sunshine"""", that seems to depend on nothing more than a good script and fine acting performances."""
1072;Finally, in the title role is seven year old, Olive (Abigail Breslin) a sweet little girl with a sunny disposition and an obsession with beauty pageants.
1073;bus and make the 700 mile journey, which is filled with both big laughs, drama and tears.
1074;Co. directors, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris' have done a sure and steady job creating a wonderful film.
1075;"Likewise, Screen Writer, Michael Ardnt's Academy Award winning script (""Best Writing, Original Screenplay"") is filled with rich, well."
1076;rounded characters, witty, funny dialogue and a story that makes the viewer care.
1077;but the best attribute of the film is the talented ensemble cast of actors, who's peformances really made this movie.
1078;Toni Colette is a accomplished actress, who always seems to just disapear into her roles.
1079;She is just great as the stressed out mom, who keeps everyone together.
1080;"Alan Arkan won an Oscar (""Best Performance By an Actor in a Supporting Role"") as the foul."
1081;mouthed Grandpa, provided some of the film's biggest laughs, while showing a lot of heart.
1082;wise, Steve Carell's (in a pre.
1083;making role and more than holds her own with her fellow performers.
1084;Bravo to the whole brilliant cast!
1085;It's funny and moving, providing themes about being yourself and not being afraid to go after your dreams.
1086;there's a depth to it that earns every laugh you get and there are quite a few.
1087;a brilliant cast, led by Alan Arkin, the codgy old grandfather, Steve Carrel, the suicidal brother of Toni Collete, a mother trying to keep the family running, and frayed from it.
1088;There's something wonderfully uplifting and heartwarming about this movie but not in your typical Hollywood bloated way, and laughs are real belly jumpers not those little chuckl laughs.
1089;For an independent film, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE hits practically all the three.
1090;act plot points Syd Field and his ilk recommend.
1091;Each of the actors undergoes his or her own trauma, revelation, and recovery.
1092;Most of them were pretty well done, like Greg Kinnear's encounter with Bryan Cranston at the Scottsdale hotel.
1093;It is to Carell's credit that he almost makes it work.
1094;If so, it's great that Gordon Thomson has hooked himself onto a hit.
1095;Brlliantly captures the insanity of modern life.
1096;He is obsessed with success because he's had very little success of his own.
1097;A little girl watches a beauty pageant with intensity you rarely see in a child, as she dreams of a future that will never come.
1098;Then one day the daughter, Olive (Abigail Breslin, who fully deserves her Best Supporting Actress nomination), gets a call from the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant.
1099;No one in the family (save for Olive) is happy about this trip.
1100;In what becomes one of the best running gags in the movie, the stick shift of their mini.
1101;The point is that they all love each other.
1102;But quirks can be embraced and become redeeming features about you.
1103;It's just one of many examples of the excellent acting and character development found in the film.
1104;of course, the reason all this works above all else is because the movie is funny.
1105;Well, there are some dramatic moments, but this is a comedy through and through.
1106;When the movie ends there is sense of wanting to continue with the family to see where their life goes, but also a sense that they've come to grips with who they are, and though they will still be dysfunctional when they get home, they will also live better lives as a result of this trip.
1107;Once again the old saying that the destination is not as important as the journey itself proves true once again.
1108;Little Miss Sunshine is yet another quirky indie comedy, this time about a dysfunctional family roadtrip.
1109;So I'm pleased to report that Little Miss Sunshine is far more successful than it has any right to be.
1110;While I still feel as if this little picture was slightly overpraised upon its release (as well as being a major Oscar contender), it provides many laughs and works as screwball comedy.
1111;one thing that sets Sunshine apart from similar indies is a stellar cast.
1112;Abigail Breslin brings a refreshing blend of hope and delusion to the title character.
1113;It's nice to see him again, especially in such a showy in.your.
1114;Steve Carell is surprisingly sympathetic as the depressive homosexual brother.
1115;And Paul Dano, in my opinion, delivers the movie's best performance as the disconnected son who has taken a vow of silence.
1116;So even though this colorful, supremely eccentric bunch are character types as opposed to real people, the actors make it work.
1117;but, first and foremost, this is a comedy.
1118;And I forgave the calculated eccentricities because the film is simply funny.
1119;Outrageous and slapstick, yet smartly observant, this film earns your respect and laughs.
1120;It's a fun ride with many identifiable situations.
1121;Little Miss Sunshine is not particularly original (it shares many plot elements from Vacation, in fact), but it is extremely well done.
1122;I love this movie, I'm pretty I didn't stop laughing the entire time I watched it.
1123;I woke up one morning to this movie and thought it was hilarious, I thought that it would be great for family night, I ordered it maybe 2 weeks before the holidays and it arrived right on time to watch with my family on christmas.
1124;Wonderful movie, part comedy, part serious and poignant with memorable performances by Alan Arkin and Abigail Breslin in the title role.
1125;One of the best films in recent memory.
1126;I've worked very hard to create a safe and kind environment in my home.
1127;I felt like a piece of my soul was taken after experiencing this film.
1128;Prepare to laugh, and prepare yourself to laugh at things that make you squirm.
1129;That broken horn on the VW Bus is still making me laugh today.
1130;Best comedy I've seen in a long while.
1131;This very funny comedy concerns old Olive, a sweet little seven.year old who wants to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California.
1132;She lives with her eccentric family in New Mexico, so the whole brood piles into the old VW bus for a road trip, and there's never a dull moment.
1133;the excellent ensemble cast and surprisingly clever script make this a genuinely funny comedy with many laugh.
1134;loud moments and just the right blend of serious and touching and manically silly.
1135;Except for the constant use of foul language, it's a movie everyone could enjoy.
1136;The script gives each member of the family plenty of time to shine, and each part was perfectly.
1137;I left the theatre with a smile on my face, glad that I saw this movie, and that's something that doesn't happen often these days.
1138;Why this movie got an Oscar nomination for Best Picture is beyond me.
1139;"pS If you want to see a great ""indie/art house"" movie about a family at a crossroads, check out, Brooklyn Lobster, a great movie that did not become ""the movie one must see to be in"" (see my review)."
1140;Little Miss Sunshine is excellent!
1141;One of the best films of the year!
1142;The directing by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris is excellent!
1143;The story and screenplay by Michael Arndt is excellent!
1144;winning performance for Best Supporting Actor) are excellent!
1145;"The music by Mychael Danna (who also worked on ""The Nativity Story"" (2006) and Devotchka is excellent!"
1146;The cinematography by Tim Suhrstedt is excellent!
1147;The film editing by Pamela Martin is excellent!
1148;"The casting by Justine Baddeley and Kim Davis (both who also worked on ""We Are Marshall"" (2006) is excellent!"
1149;The production design by Kalina Ivanov is excellent!
1150;The art direction by Alan E. Muraoka is excellent!
1151;The set decoration by Melissa M. Levander is excellent!
1152;The costume design by Nancy Steiner is excellent!
1153;This is one of the most original films and comedies of the year!
1154;This is an unique film that has never been done before, until now, of course.
1155;One of the year's best!
1156;but by the end of the movie you HAVE to own it!
1157;I make it a habit every year to watch at least the five best picture nominess for the Oscars.
1158;First: Greg Kinnear, whom I have watched since Talk Soup and have seen almost all of his movies.
1159;He is a constant surprise when it comes to acting.
1160;Third: Nominated for Best Picture.
1161;The patriarch (Greg Kinnear) is spending all of his time and effort, along with the family's money, into a success program he has developed.
1162;There are nine steps in this program claiming to make anyone and everyone successful.
1163;there's Uncle Frank (the subtle and hilarious Steve Carell) who is a gay, formerly world class Professor respected world wide.
1164;He's the 15 year old son refusing to utter a word until he achieves his goal of becoming an Air Force pilot.
1165;He has learned everything his knows about his philosiphy in life from Nietzsche.
1166;Olive has dreams of becoming a world famous Beauty Pageant Champion while having a small potbelly, larger than normal gapped teeth, and 80's style glasses.
1167;Needless to say, comedy and mayhem ensue.
1168;this movie is quite funny.
1169;Instead, it's a heartwarming, touching, life lesson learning film of the realistic, dysfunctional family we are all a part of.
1170;the journey this family takes while on the road to realize Olive's dream is one filled with lessons not only from the obvious (don't kill yourself), but to the small, albeit grand rules in life we must learn the hard way (not everything will go you way.
1171;and there's more to life than meets the eye.)
1172;The oddest thing about the film is how bright it is, while having some of the darkest themes I have witnessed in a 'family film.'
1173;"Although this is an ""R"" rated family film, it's one I think is important for families to watch, once the children are older."
1174;without giving too much away, I suggest everyone watches this film simply because it's heartwrenching, funny, touching, and scary all wrapped into one sunny, 103 minute package.
1175;Felt like we knew the characters from the very start of the movie.
1176;Would recommend this comedy to my friends.
1177;Abigail Breslin is great in her portrayal of Olive, the young aspiring Little Miss Sunshine.
1178;The family goes on a trip that tests their resolve and closeness.
1179;A film that has a good message that is shown through family adversity as well as quirky triumph.
1180;This is a fresh and delightful romp with one of the world's most idiosyncratic and disfunctional familes.
1181;Each family member fits with the others in a way that real families work together.
1182;The laughs are genuine throughout the voyage of discovery they make which includes tragedy, slapstick, and pathos, and ends with a scene that will leave you gasping for breath between the laughs.
1183;I haven't enjoyed a movie this much for years.
1184;This movie is on my top ten lists of favorites, I watch it about every year or two and it is always enjoyable.
1185;The grandpa, Alan Arkin, plays a character who is funny and essentric, despite his vulgar mouth and helps make the movie what it is.
1186;It actually is a feel.
1187;good movie that shows the disgrace in child beauty contests.
1188;The whole script was hilarious.
1189;Alan ark in was terrific as always.
1190;Everyone has a family like that right?
1191;This all starts when Olive gets a call that the regional winner has stepped down.
1192;up, Olive gets to compete in this envious competition.
1193;Not with this family, they are THE poster family of dysfunctionality.
1194;all I can say is that if you like family dynamics no matter how chaotic they can be, then you'll enjoy *Little Miss Sunshine*.
1195;There's something special about that bond because he comes back.
1196;"Here's the movie the Motion Picture Academy overrated and nominated for best picture for 2006, much as it did with ""Sideways"" a 2004 flick about a pair of middle aged guys travleing through California's wine country a few years earlier."
1197;the action revolves around the family taking its trip from New Mexico to the pagaent near Los Angeles and the various underlying stories that go on while that's in progress.
1198;The film is variably hilarious, stupid, insightful, energetic, arousing, perverted and sentimental.
1199;if you're like me, you'll wonder why the Motion Picture Academy thought this was one of the five best movies of 2006.
1200;"Its temperament reminds me a bit of ""In America"", a movie from 2002 starring a pair of real life sisters that lit up the screen with transcendent performances that bordered on magic."
1201;"That film didn't have the outright humor of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" but it was, from my perspective, a far better production and a much better story."
1202;this one will leave you feeling good, if that's your goal, and it will entertain you throughout, but it definitely should not have been considered an Oscar contender.
1203;What a wonderful comedy !
1204;An american coemedy, piece of a true culture, your culture.
1205;In such films, the American culture expresses its originality.
1206;And there are other shockers, as well.)
1207;The story is made fairly simple and clean by omitting the messy details we all know exist.
1208;The acting is so well done, and everyone was lovable.
1209;see this one, you'll be glad you did.
1210;A movie that can make you laugh, cry a little and laugh again!
1211;Amazing movie that glorifies being true to yourself and your family.
1212;That being said, Little Miss Sunshine is a true gem, which sports one of the best ensemble casts you'll see all year.
1213;Along the way, various situations occur which test every member of the family, and ultimately brings them all closer together as the movie ties up with the most fantastic scene ever to grace the stage of a pageant competition: Olive competing in the talent portion of the contest.
1214;cast of characters:Richard Hoover (played by Greg Kinear): a completely unsuccessful motivational speaker, whose entire existence is hinging on a book deal, the likes of which is, ironically, a book about success.
1215;dwayne Hoover (played by Paul Dano): the angsty yet thoughtful teenager who has taken a vow of silence until he accomplishes his dream of becoming a fighter pilot.
1216;fueled old man who helps Olive with the talent (dance) portion of the pageant.
1217;pop some popcorn, grab a drink, and sit down and enjoy the ride.
1218;out for the best use so far of a Rick James hit.
1219;very touching, funny, and simply awesome!
1220;One of my favorite movies with Steve Carell.
1221;If you like movies that are funny then this is for you!
1222;Lots of laughs will be had with this one.
1223;The little girl Abigail Breslin will steal your heart.
1224;she is so innocent and vulnerable and beautiful on the inside.
1225;What better things do you have to do with your time than enjoy a little pleasure and a laugh?
1226;"i should really stay away from these ""feel good"" comedies."
1227;It was worth watching just to see the performance of Alan Arkin.
1228;The film pokes fun at everything, including the human potential movement, the concept of a dysfunctional family, beauty pageants in general, and homophobia.
1229;He was really that good.
1230;comedy lovers who want to come out of the theater with a warm and fuzzy feeling might like this film.
1231;This is a great movie!
1232;It's important to have a great sense of humor when viewing this and an open mind is a must!
1233;But for adults, I found it interesting and funny.
1234;I saw this movie in the theater and absolutely loved it.
1235;it was the acting that really got my attention.
1236;Abigail Breslin has really become an excellent actress (she always has been in my opinion) and she shows it here.
1237;She was an excellent pick for the role.
1238;i loved Greg Kinnear's performance as Richard.
1239;She's a brilliant actress who fit this role PERFECTLY.
1240;Still, Ms. Collette deserves the honor.
1241;"this family really put the ""fun"" in dysfunctional."
1242;Alan Arkin was so funny and just great.
1243;paul Dano (Dwayne) and Steve Carell (Frank) give outstanding performances as well.
1244;if you like dramedies, you love this movie.
1245;I highly recommend this wonderful movie to pretty much anyone.
1246;Great movie with an excellent moral and plot twist.
1247;I won't reveal the ending, but it did live up to hilarious and unexpected.
1248;It's rather like an endless joke that is painful to see through to the conclusion but you're rewarded for your tenacity with a good laugh.
1249;"A funny story about a dysfunctional family that put aside their troubles to give Olive a chance at the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" title."
1250;Olive is a little girl about 9 years old who is positive about winning this title, even though her chances are slim.
1251;The family bands together to overcome their own problems and help her.
1252;It is a very rewarding and funny story.
1253;If you've ever been on one of those family vacations where everything that can go wrong, goes wrong, then moments of Little Miss Sunshine will resonate with you.
1254;The finest part of the film was the casting, and the ability of the director to draw out an excellent ensemble synergy.
1255;"the nuclear family in the story, of Albuquerque, is headed by Kinnear as Richard, the developer of a ""self."
1256;"Breslin is perhaps the finest part of the film (she has appeared before, in ""Signs"")."
1257;This is not a laugh out loud role for Carrell, and it's excellent to see the bittersweet side of him.

1262;Movie has a strong cast.
1263;The story and the characters are so dysfunctional, but it worked out wonderfully.
1264;I loved all the characters .
1265;I watch this film a few times a year.
1266;The performances are all excellent.
1267;One of my favorite films.
1268;Little Miss Sunshine is an earnest and amusing little movie.
1269;"There are some nice moments, a wonderful performance by Alan Arkin, and a ""slice of life"" feel that reinforces that gut feeling (which turns out to be correct) that all of us are pretty screwed up ."
1270;which is at least half the reason that human beings are endearing.
1271;It's a loose travelogue rather than a Hero's Journey, and a gentle, poigant pleasure.
1272;"once on TV in the beautiful ""Six Feet Under"", and once in the offbeat comedy ""The Daytrippers"" with Parker Posey."
1273;I loved this movie .
1274;To me, the strongest actors were Paul Dano and Abigail Breslin (who I think, is a good actress beyond her years, and a REAL actress unlike the young Dakota Fanning).
1275;Paul Dano plays the young Dwayne, and his is the most unnerving and realistic depiction of a troubled teen I have seen in some time.
1276;"please check out the wonderful ""The Daytrippers"" starring Hope Davis and Parker Posey, as well as the Beauty Contest satire ""Drop Dead Gorgeous""."
1277;I love movies without big budgets and without big stars.
1278;The characters were excellent and it was pretty funny at times, but over all, I didn't really feel much when it was over.
1279;Paul Dano is very good looking and has such a growing talent.
1280;"There is no words to explain this movie
1281;classic hall of fame in the years to come.
1282;It is a fantastic, fun and delightfully dysfunctional look at a family road trip with plenty of fun, colorful characters to entertain you.
1283;A delightfully surprising little movie with a lot of heart at its center.
1284;This movie is the best movie I've seen in years.
1285;Each character was frighteningly real.
1286;But at the end, he said, """"Marion, you did it again because this one is a real keeper!"""
1287;My husband and I owned that van (in another form) in the 1970's and we really did have to park it on a hill to push.
1288;Perhaps that helped make the movie more poignant and hilarious for me.
1289;"it was SO amazing I bought the freaking movie and the last time I bought a movie was ""Kill Bill 1 and 2"" (the ultimate chick flicks of all time, bar none!)"
1290;"I also bought the soundtrack to ""Little Miss Sunshine"" which is fabulous."
1291;It's a classic, for sure!!
1292;I loved this movie because it put the whole Beauty Queen in perspective.
1293;perhaps the most endearing thing about Little Miss Sunshine isn't it's intimate look inside the slightly twisted hearts of its six main characters.
1294;kilter comedy of its road.
1295;pilot, doggedly moving ahead simply because that has been their purpose.
1296;Toni Collette is absolutely perfect as the mother, Sheryl, who has made this frazzled family the locus of her own frazzled life.
1297;And Steve Carell shines, cast against type as the once.
1298;given such a cast of characters, it would be easy to see it devolving (even with the talent at hand) into something melodramatic and cheesy, but this movie operates with a light touch.
1299;We are treated, instead, to a tender and yet unflinching look at these people and how they struggle.
1300;This is, quite obviously, a family of losers (in whatever way you want to define that word), but .
1301;I laughed through most of the movie and really enjoyed it.
1302;Bought it for Christmas for my sister.
1303;I'm hoping someone is thoughtful enough to make it a gift to me.
1304;Alright so I love this movie.
1305;The ending is enough of a jaw dropper.
1306;Great movie to watch with the entire family.
1307;I had heard people talk about this movie, so i really wanted to see it.
1308;Funny, intelligent and great acting.
1309;Little Miiss Sunshine is a real gem with a wry take on a dysfinctional family, the world of child breauty competitions , teenage angst and well.
1310;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!
1311;It was hilarious and at the same time got you thinking about our society today in this country.
1312;What a wonderful departure from the usual Hollywood fare.
1313;It's a monument to the power of great writing, casting choices, and directing.
1314;It's witty and sharp, but also has a deeply humanistic edge.
1315;This movie is a work of art and so entertaining.
1316;Great characters, script, music, and it's visually stunning.
1317;Little Miss Sunshine is one of those bittersweet comedies that catches your attention right away and holds your attention quite well.
1318;The acting is very convincing and the plot moves along at a good pace.
1319;"Watch the movie and find out!The cinematography is rather fine
1320;The choreography shines through in scenes where the little girls all compete for the title of Little Miss Sunshine.
1321;Some people may say that it tries too hard to please but I didn't pick up on that"
1322;Girl Next Door was OK for him, but he did the amazing movie L. i. e.
1323;Everything about it was funny, and well acted.
1324;I highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you have a dysfunctional family of your own!
1325;The real entertainment lies within the family itself.
1326;And what a family it is.
1327;headed by a man who lectures people to find the winner inside of them, we have a father trying to sell a nine.
1328;grandpa really loves his family and isn't afraid to tell them at various times in his own way.
1329;The uncle is quick to bond with the kids in spite of his own troubles.
1330;The big brother is very intelligent and eventually comes around, and Dad somehow manages to get his daughter to the contest on time.
1331;while parts of it reminded me of vacation, the plot was surprisingly unpredictable, and the brilliant cast made these eccentric characters real enough to sustain the most far.
1332;It had the right combination of elements: enough drama for conflict, enough sentiment to bond the characters, and lots of humor to carry it through.
1333;This was a great way to bring a little sunshine to the last day of my vacation in the San Francisco Bay Area.
1334;The day that I, and one of my best friends, saw this film started like most of the other days of my visit to the Bay Area .
1335;"Neither of us ""read up"" on the film but selected it based on the suggestion of friends to ""go see it
1336;This film is as emotionally accessible as it is humorous and edifying.
1337;By the end of the film we'd both cried when a particularly relevant scene elicited tears of recognition and we'd laughed riotously when a scene helped us remember that even in the midst of life's chaos, there are always rays of pure joy and outright fun.
1338;This was a great way to lighten up the afternoon and our spirits.
1339;A classic screwball comedy that flown under the radar for years.
1340;A very funny movie with a great cast headed by Greg Kinnear in one of his funniest roles.
1341;A must have for those who want a fun movie with allot of laughs that you will want to watch often.
1342;I liked it, it was creative, and you can never go wrong with Greg and Steve!
1343;The streaming was good too.
1344;This movie, """"Little Miss Sunshine"""", is an incredible piece of work."""
1345;I think it's because it's so true to real life.
1346;"When this movie was recommended to me by a friend it was described as ""funny""."
1347;I recommend this movie because it was a work of art in itself.
1348;Unlike other movies about a quirky family that goes on a trip together this one had a more realistic plot to it.
1349;It had a happy ending, in a sense.
1350;If you haven't seen Little Miss Sunshine yet, you absolutely must see this movie.
1351;I would recommend this movie to everyone, but especially mothers with daughters who compete in pageants.
1352;Also, anyone in the Air Force will appreciate this movie as well.
1353;I was required to watch this movie for class and do a family assessment on it.
1354;It was more sad yet touching yet slightly disturbing.
1355;Little Miss Sunshine, the little indie film that could, is in my opinion one of the best films of the year.
1356;extremly funny, quirky characters, and a simple plot that makes it work.
1357;whats best is this transformation isent shoved down our throats but is done in a very subtle yet prominent way.
1358;the humor is definently the funniest i have heard in a while but the most hilarious part is definently the pageant.
1359;the performances are also top notched, the best definently being Alan Arkin, Paul Dano, and Abigail Breslin, they just shine in the film but Breslin is the standout.
1360;i was pretty shocked that Alan Arkin won the oscar for Supporting Actor but, he's also a very nice choice though i still think Eddie should have got it.
1361;This comedy is dark and delicious about dysfunctional family realtionships.
1362;There are several turns and twists in the movie.
1363;When I was first watching this movie I thought that it was going to be a sleeper.
1364;I was truely surprised at the turn of events.
1365;Little Miss Sunshine is a spectacular movie about the hilarious but dysfunctional Hooper family.
1366;The whole crazy family comes together when it's time for seven.year.
1367;in other words, she's normal.
1368;i really enjoyed this fun, quirky little movie.
1369;The cast is excellent, but I was especially impressed with Arkin, whose foul.
1370;"mouthed comments steal the show
1371;Other than that, though, this is a great movie about the family ties that bind: definitely worth watching.
1372;i'm totally in love with this film and plan to watch it again and again.
1373;I laughed really hard and cried numerous times.
1374;I'm not a big fan of Steve Carell (40 year old virgin, The Office) but I loved him in this film.
1375;Olive first won my heart in M. Night Shyamalan's Signs and again in Raising Helen.
1376;All the actors young and old were superb and harmonized one another.
1377;little Miss Sunshine is a sweet, hysterical and sad film.
1378;I highly recommend seeing it.
1379;This is what I call a road trip movie done with a mixture of happy and sad side of the human nature.
1380;I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to follow a great journey across the vast United States of America.
1381;The ending is a must see.
1382;I brought the movie for my son as a Christmas gift.
1383;It was one for the funniest movies that I have seen in a long time.
1384;I told all of my friends to watch it for themselves.
1385;Is this movie Oscar worthy?
1386;it certainly is entertaining and original, with a screenplay that examines a dysfunctional family in a kindly light.

1392;When a beauty contest winner is forced to abdicate her position, Olive (Breslin) is elevated to the top spot.
1393;Various situations force her entire family to come along with her.
1394;Richard (Kinnear), the dad, is a motivational speaker who is a few steps away from making it big.
1395;Dwayne (Dano) the teenage son, has taken a vow of silence and likes to read Nietzsche.
1396;Grandpa (Arkin) is a heroin addict and lives an edgy life.
1397;Little Miss Sunshine is a genuinely funny and sweet movie.
1398;All the actors give their characters real life.
1399;At times funny and sad, their trip to the pageant is a memorable one that will have audiences talking well after the film is finished.
1400;I highly recommend this film.
1401;The ending is key because it leaves you with the spirit that ALL of our families are crazy and that we all still have to get along in life and find our own way.

1406;i recommend this movie to all movie fans.

1416;"owing to Michael Arndt's heartfelt script and its wonderful ensemble cast, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is both hilarious and credible on an emotional level."

1423;If you at all have any issues with your family, you will enjoy this film as well.
1424;it manages to find the laughs within the dysfunction.
1425;It's silly and moving, and at times a little disturbing.

1489;The story behind the movie is good, disfunctional family trying to pull together to make a little girls dream come true.

1512;the movie opens with Richard indoctrinating Olive with the pressure.
1513;The family rallies to protect Olive and hilarity ensues.
1514;little Miss Sunshine beautifully portrays the power of family to protect and nurture, even when one, or in this case several, of the parts are broken and vulnerable.
1515;Some love the depiction of the dysfunctional family.
1516;Others simply pan it outright.
1517;"One reviewer said, ""If you liked `American Beauty', you'll love `Little Miss Sunshine'."""
1518;"I did, however, really enjoy ""Sideways"" ."
1519;Maybe growing up in a relatively normal and loving home disqualifies me from empathazing with a tale like this.
1520;If that's the case, then I do sincerely feel for those touched by this movie.

1526;It was uplifting, entertaining and just plain fun.
1527;Little Miss Sunshine is so funny it actually hurts.

1529;That being said it is a fabulous drama.

1532;If you love smart humor and drama that is as funny as life you must watch this movie!
1533;this family is the most loving, neurotic, wacky crew, and little Abigail Breslin has this true to life child presence that makes the urgency for the roadtrip from hell all the more credible.
1534;And this film is the pinnacle of intelligent comedy.

1544;Many believers shy away from some films because of language, (myself being one of them) but sometimes we miss out on a great piece of film that can touch us in many ways.
1545;Little Miss Sunshine si one of the best comedies of 2006.
1546;It has a smartly written script that is clever and original with some very funny moments in it.
1547;I found Little Miss Sunshine to be one of the best comedies of 2006.
1548;It is a real pleasure.
1549;Finally got around to watching Little Miss Sunshine, and it was just as good as everyone said it was.
1550;The film tells the story of the Hoover family .
1551;while there is certainly enough plot to go around, this is primarily a character piece.
1552;We see Dwayne's dream to be a pilot threatened.
1553;And she is so trusting and vulnerable that I was totally hooked.
1554;His melancholy recovery from depression is something to see .
1555;smart, likable, witty, in other words, someone we really want to keep around.
1556;At any rate, you will love this movie.
1557;I did, and I strongly encourage you to check it out.
1558;This movie was totally hysterical, heartwarming, and just an outstanding piece of work if you are trying to explain the #1 most dysfunctional family on earth.
1559;the cast is amazing, and it is worth every minute.
1560;wall humor, get this movie.
1561;it's about a very functional family living life!
1562;Certainly there are ebbs and flows in the collective life of each family .
1563;But what they do, together, ultimately, is really wonderful.
1564;each character was well cast and each actor did a GREAT job of showing us who their character was.
1565;"It will reaffirm for you that people really do want to take care of each other and allow each other to ""be""."
1566;And Ms. Abigail is absolutely precious in this film.
1567;I'm happy that she looked like what a seven year old should look like and not those life.
1568;Cynical, sarcastic, biting, dark, this is hands down the funniest movie of 2006.
1569;Wonderful movie, great script, great actors, what's not to love?
1570;A very smart comedy, which will have you in stitches.
1571;"LMS is a very ""interesting"" movie."
1572;It's more subtle and sophisticated than people seem to give it credit for.
1573;Even though the characters all fail, they do still emerge stronger and more unified as a family because of it.
1574;IMHO it's much more existential than that.
1575;this, combined with a great cast makes for a very interesting movie.
1576;If you're not the unthinking drone that Hollywood assumes most (all) of us to be, then LMS is defiantly worth your time.
1577;A fun and light hearted look at all the odd and wonderful differences that make up a loving family.

1583;Steve Carell is excellent in the role of Frank, Sheryl's suicidal brother, a gay Proust scholar and professor whose inamorato, a handsome grad student, has taken up with a rival prof. The youngest member of the family is seven year old Olive, wonderfully acted by Abigail Breslin, for whose sake the quarreling Hoovers pile into the VW and head for a little girl beauty pageant in California.
1584;obsessed, emo teenage son Duane, brilliantly perfomed by Paul Dano, very nearly steals the show with his temper.
1585;I have never been a big fan of Greg Kinnear, but he impressed me and was truly superb as a man on the brink of bankruptcy who attempts to remain positive.
1586;It was a pleasure to see Steve Carell in a semi.
1587;serious roll, his verbal exchanges with Richard and Grandpa in the bus, and with Duane at the beach in California, are funny and sensitively.
1588;Abigail Breslin is perfect as the wannabe beauty.
1589;Her earnestness and genuinely childlike spirit are seen to good effect against the glitzy backdrop of a beauty contest in which simpering children with bouffant hair, layers of makeup, and frothy girly.
1590;"About Paul Dano a great deal has been said in connection with his work in ""There Will Be Blood."""
1591;He is a superb young actor with an impressive range, and his surly, sulky teenage Duane provides the film with some of its best moments.
1592;admitttedly there are one or two moments when the predictability of the plot can be a bit much, but this is more than made up for by the film's hilarious conclusion which is anything but predictable, as well as uplifting and moving.
1593;Little Miss Sunshine is funny, thoughtful, and unpredictable.
1594;It is certainly rated R, but real to life.
1595;Everyone has seen this, and knows it's great.
1596;I bought this for a friend for Christmas, I know she'll enjoy it.
1597;Awesome soundtrack, would listen to it all day if I could.
1598;a lot of family tension.
1599;I was pleasantly pleased and should have watched it years ago.
1600;lOL I also now understand the flood of youth pagentry shows a few years back.
1601;Little 7 year old Olive Hoover discovers (to her screeching delight), that she's won a place in the finals of the 'Little Miss Sunshine' beauty pageant in California.
1602;i loved every minute and actually learned a few lessons from it:1.
1603;True beauty is absolutely what's inside a person and not what's on the outside and in this day and age, this is definitely a message we should ensure our children hear from us.2.
1604;A family of misfits and neurotics that love and support each other is still a loving and supportive family.3.
1605;(And this one has particular personal relevance).
1606;this is a family road trip movie with a difference.
1607;Great acting from Greg Kinnear, Toni Collete, Paul Dano, Steve Carell, Alan Arkin, the wonderful little Abigail Breslin as Olive and last but by no means least, that plucky yellow VW van.
1608;see how many you can spot .
1609;directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris have put together a fantastic piece of art here.
1610;Sometimes these little indie films are simply the best.
1611;Definitely one to own as I will want to watch this again.
1612;Little Miss Sunshine has earned well.
1613;deserved Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay Oscar nominations as well as Best Spporting Actor and Actress nominations for Alan Arkin and Abigail Breslin.
1614;this movie is amazing to watch, its funny and sad at the same time.
1615;it will be great to watch it whenever you want to
1616;The Bottom Line:Little Miss Sunshine suprised me as much as anyone by charming its way to an undeserved Best Picture nomination, but it's still a funny and fast.
1617;moving road comedy with its share of affecting moments and quotable lines.
1618;This is a great comedy .
1619;The film is about a family's trek to deliver their daughter to a young girl beauty pageant.
1620;And it's about finding ways to live with people who do things we don't like.
1621;an elaborate public spectacle illustrative of the history of a place, institution, or the like, often given in dramatic form or as a procession of colorful floats.
1622;a costumed procession, masque, allegorical tableau, or the like forming part of public or social festivities.
1623;Dwayne: F#*k beauty contests .
1624;life is one beauty contest after another . . . If I want to fly, I'll find a way to fly.
1625;The comic acting is sublime.
1626;To do this, they must run along side and jump into the arms of a family member inside.
1627;This regular and repeated dangerous activity and its symbolism are great.
1628;to a beauty contest for children .
1629;it is a fantastic parody of beauty contests .
1630;"the emcee for the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" Contest is hilarious."
1631;Something about his clowinsh face and perverted eyes captures the true absurdity of the film.
1632;olive manages to shine despite her lack of pageant attributes.
1633;greg Kinnear shines as Olive's father and Alan Arkin delivers a stellar performance as Olive's foul mouthed, drugged out grandpa.
1634;it was fantastic and all the actors were hilarous.
1635;I found this movie to be one of the most hilarious movies I have watched in a while.
1636;Regardless of their problems, the family supports each other and bands together to journey on their quest to Olive's beauty pagent.
1637;The funniest movie of the year!
1638;I still laugh everytime I watch it!
1639;Yeah, this is a great movie . . . this is definitely on my list of worst movies ever.
1640;Much is revealed about the family members in the first minute of the movie.
1641;i enjoyed watching the family dynamics throughout this movie.
1642;One of my favorite moments was when Olive found out early in the movie that she won a pageant by default.
1643;It is so funny also, the encounters and what happens along this road to hopeful stardom.
1644;Really good movie and highly recommended.
1645;This was an excellent story with a moral.
1646;good comedy with a message.
1647;It was a good movie but certainly nothing Oscar worthy.
1648;Well it is a sweet film that has recieved way more than its share of publicity.
1649;I loved it for the van they drove around in, like one my family had growing up.
1650;I watched it once and enjoyed the story, but not sure if I'll watch it again.
1651;I haven't laughed this much at a movie in a while, I absolutely loved it!
1652;Like the viewer below said, the climax of the movie is hilarious, something you'd never expect.
1653;There is a great sense of unease throughout this film but it stays endearing somehow.
1654;Filled with amazing actors and great performances.
1655;this film has made it onto my favorite movies and my favorite comedys lists.you must get this film.
1656;People that normally have the same taste as me highly recommended this movie.
1657;I kept waiting for the good parts.
1658;The son was probably my favorite character.
1659;He's the epitome of teenage angst.
1660;The grandfather was so wrong yet hilarious at the same time.
1661;The dynamic between the uncle and son was one of the more realistic traits of the movie.
1662;the entire movie was very thoughfully and beautifully filmed.
1663;All the shots were composed so masterfully.
1664;I especially liked the scene when the son finds out he is color blind and is crouching on the ground with the family and VW in the background.
1665;There is also a part of the movie when the family gets out of the VW and enters their hotel rooms.
1666;this movie was great and deserves all the acclaim it got.
1667;The setup is pretty simple.
1668;the road trip that ensues plays on their dysfunction, with witty exchanges between the talented performers.
1669;The chemistry between Paul Dano and Steve Carrel is most affecting, despite the fact that Paul Dano doesn't talk for a good 2/3 of the film.
1670;This is perhaps the most original concept the film has to offer.
1671;That the film is so funny and makes you feel so good at the end is an amazing feat.
1672;The finale is a little over the top for my tastes, but there is something so human and honest about these characters that you can't help but want to jump in and help get their VW van on the road again.
1673;If you find humor in dysfunctional family situations you will enjoy this movie about a struggling extended family of misfits.
1674;speaking teenager, 60's generation liberal grandfather, newly released gay uncle on suicide watch, and a sweet, baby.
1675;"This surprised me
1676;what saves it and earns my four stars here is the excellent cast.
1677;Greg Kinnear is always terrific, in my book.
1678;Abigail Breslin is truly Little Miss Sunshine"
1679;Steve Carrell is very good in what had to be a difficult role, rising from his suicidal despair to life before our eyes.
1680;Paul Dano is good too as the suffering teenager.
1681;But she does sweeten up a bit in the end.
1682;We're supposed to hate the dad but he is the one who by sheer force of will, pulls the family through all of the set.
1683;Little Miss Sunshine is wonderfully upbeat family movie that exudes warmth and promotes family values in a way that is smart, funny and serious all at the same time.
1684;I highly recommend this film.
1685;I expected this total feel good experience where everyone's dreams come true.
1686;I enjoyed the film for what it was, but at the same time I was left wondering what the point was.
1687;Life sucks, but we still have each other.
1688;There was a lot of sexual humor in this one.
1689;This is the most hysterical movie I have ever seen in my entire life.
1690;I laughed so hard that I cried throughout almost the entire thing.
1691;And that's saying a lot coming from me.
1692;There are some movies you watch because it gets great review, and you really expect you're in for one of those powerful, awe.
1693;You expect to come out of the theater with the warm and fuzzy feeling.
1694;of course Abigail Breslin was wonderful, and I'm sure, will prove to be a very powerful actress as she grows.
1695;driven story with some strong acting coming from the two youngest actors in the movie.
1696;I would recommend this movie again and again.
1697;told tale is a delight.
1698;While there is some salty language and themes, we watched the film with our teenage sons and just love it.
1699;This movie is funny and good for familycomedy about little girl dreams to be miss shine , then it turns into comedysituations.
1700;"I had no idea what to expect from ""Little Miss Sunshine"" but I knew that it was nominated for ""Best Picture"" so it must have had something going for it."
1701;You can see it coming and it really becomes rather impressive to watch.
1702;For some groups it has been a real issue.
1703;I've attended a lot of pageants over the years (thanks primarily because our town annually hosts the state's Miss America contest).
1704;Otherwise, this is an enjoyable albeit unusual film.
1705;Be happy with what life allots you while laughing at those who haven't yet had their comeuppance.
1706;Oh well, I noticed that this was an independent film so perhaps they were poking fun at Hollywood's glamour girls with more looks than talent while the Indie actors were doing the heavy lifting.
1707;See, none of this really scores any points.
1708;"Oh well, enjoy ""Littler Miss Sunshine"" for what it is rather than what it isn't."
1709;warming story of a family on the road to exciting adventures where they each learn something new about themselves along the way, you've come to the right place.
1710;the way this defective family learns to band together during an exhaustingly odd road trip will leave you with smiles, tears and a better view of your own family.
1711;lucky girl with big dreams.
1712;It turned out to become one of my favorites!
1713;see that transcends every typical movie in mainstream theaters.
1714;One of the best movies of 2006, without a doubt.
1715;I completely recommend this to anyone with a good sense of humor and willing to be submersed in this wackily realistic adventure of the Hoover family.
1716;And I answered my own question: well, yes but the movie wouldn't be a comedy anymore.
1717;Little Miss Sunshine is R. rated .
1718;finally a great movie intelligent story and extremely fun funny and engaging.
1719;This one is really well done.
1720;It's not one of the best movies of all time but it's a very good movie.
1721;This is not a great film, but is definitely worth the time for some enjoyable eccentric behavior from a brilliant cast.
1722;Ms. Breslin's and Mr. Arkin's Oscar noms speak for themselves, but Kinnear, Carrell, Paul Dano and, especially, Toni Collette are so in touch with their material that Ms. Breslin's only task is to be reactionary, which she does beautifully and naturally.
1723;actors and she won me over.
1724;There's fire and wisdom behind those beautiful, spectacled eyes, and when she lets loose at the end, you simply HAVE to cheer.
1725;The clever screenplay of Michael Arndt may be its only chance of a win.
1726;Indeed, the plot is outrageous, pitting one obstacle against another, but the ending is satisfying and appropriate.
1727;Little Miss Sunshine is a small, easy to watch film, and though some previous reviewers were offended by the foul language, I thought it was representational of the characters' state at the moment.
1728;Yes, people do talk like that a lot.
1729;I had a good time, and laughed a lot.
1730;I also felt for the characters, something I can't always say.
1731;UPDATE: I love Eddie Murphy, but I'm glad Arkin won the Oscar.
1732;mouthed outrage is remembered more than the sweet moments he had with Ms. Breslin.
1733;I have recommended Little Miss Sunshine to every person I know.
1734;You will see your own family in this dramatic comedy.
1735;as well as the rest of the cast.
1736;my favorite movie for 2006.
1737;i think it has a pretty good shot at being best movie at the oscars.
1738;great performances by the whole cast.
1739;"In the case of ""Little Miss Sunshine"", the ""original idea"" is to make a comedy about a disfunctional family who take a ""road trip""."
1740;Back in 1983 there was such a comedy.
1741;"The reviewer who gave this movie two stars and made the comment related to the ""rubs against reality"", didn't grow up in a family like mine.
1742;it made us both laugh .
1743;for me this movie highlights some of the craziness you can encounter in """"reality"""", and shows the humor in it."""
1744;That's a beautiful message and a state to strive for.
1745;well, guess it just goes to show, to each their own.
1746;i LOVE this movie, and highly recommend it.
1747;When the idiosyncratic crew began to push the VW van all I could do is smile.
1748;I love this move and cast.
1749;The first time I saw this movie, I laughed so hard, I cried.
1750;It's now one of my favorites (which is why I bought it.)
1751;It has a little bit of everything, funny, happy, sad, and the end was great, the characters fit together in a crazy way.
1752;LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE (LMS) is a wonderful example of a movie that has many moments that make you want to laugh and cry at the same time.
1753;Because I think you have to really care about the characters to reach that point.
1754;Indie movies are alway SO interested in quirky people.
1755;This leads to some very amusing and somehow touching moments with all these characters push.
1756;starting the car and then one by one, leaping into the open door!
1757;This is creative (and very believable if you've ever owned a VW!)
1758;This part, while amusing, deflates some of the power the film was building towards.
1759;"and the ""climactic"" scene wants to be sublime, but is only mildly pleasing."
1760;Most of it is excellent, primarily because of the outstanding performances.
1761;Alan Arkin is always great (in my opinion, he's the single greatest film actor never to win an Oscar.
1762;i will pretty much see anything he's in.)
1763;"Greg Kinear, doing another take on his ""decent loser"" is in fine form."
1764;and that's exactly what it should do!
1765;including one of the most convincing American accents ever done by an Australian.
1766;She is simply a terrific actress.
1767;Steve Carell steals the show in many ways.
1768;His character undergoes the most growth, and in some ways, the most pain.
1769;(Although I must say that when Carell smiles, he has a wonderful, glowing, innocent smile that cannot help but make you feel better.)
1770;His performance is very internal, deep, and best of all.
1771;so I heartily recommend the film for its richness (even when it descends into cliche.
1772;it's heartfelt) and the great acting.
1773;Alan Arkin is great and the actor that plays the son is wonderful.
1774;This fact has never been more substantiated than by Little Miss Sunshine, a very funny movie that also is thought.
1775;though this movie seems a little light on the plot, it is the excellent ensemble of the six family members that make it what it is.
1776;From the Bus that won't start without everyone pushing and then jumping on, to the frustration of Richard's business attempts, the subplots and backgrounds of each character are very engaging and keep you hooked.
1777;so, I highly recommend Little Miss Sunshine.
1778;"Its incredible ensemble of characters and thoughtful ""dramedy"" style make it a must for anyone who likes movies."
1779;Little Miss Sunshine has a brilliant cast and contains moments of pure genius.
1780;My favorite scenes in the film were of the interactions between Carell and Paul Dano as a angst.
1781;Dano and Carell manage to be both genuinely disturbed and genuinely touching, especially late in the movie.
1782;The conclusion of the pageant was shocking and, while amusing, made a serious comment on contemporary mores.
1783;the cast is talented, and the critiques of modern society, particularly the exposure of the false values of the winner and loser, are frequently on the money if you look past the superficial veneer of the movie as strictly a comedy.
1784;This is one of my favorite movies.
1785;if you are looking for funny, touching, and interesting film,this one is for you.
1786;This is one of the finest low budget indie comedies you are ever likely to see and the finest I have seen since NAPOLEON DYNAMITE.
1787;"For a ""small"" film this one has a surprisingly strong cast and I would love to know how the producers managed to get so many fine individuals together for this project."
1788;YEAR OLD VIRGIN is going to be crushed, but those open to something unexpected will be delighted.
1789;The very gifted Toni Collette, who does her usual fine job as the mother in an exceptionally dysfunctional family, plays his sister.
1790;One of the joys of the film is Abigail Breslin's performance as Olive, who while cute as a button is not traditional beauty pageant material.
1791;step plan to become a winner, plays her father.
1792;Rounding out the family is Dwayne, played wonderfully by Paul Dano.
1793;the ordeals the family experiences are all original and exceedingly funny.
1794;There are a host of great scenes that any viewer will remember vividly.
1795;"While this is a ""small"" film, it manages to be infinitely funnier than any of its larger."
1796;It could also quite possibly end up the funniest movie of 2006.
1797;i did have one quibble with the film.
1798;But apart from that, this is an utterly delightful and very funny movie.
1799;Little Miss Sunshine is a heck of a fun movie.
1800;I just love the way the family is all bickering all the time and of course I think thelittle girl was the best in the movie!
1801;I highly recommend this movie to anyone (um.
1802;Needless to say, the family experiences many colorful and lesson.
1803;The father, Frank (Greg Kinnear), is a win.
1804;this is, for the most part, a charming, extremely well acted film that can be very entertaining provided one doesn't go into it expecting too much.
1805;The conflicts and interactions among the various characters are often sharp and shrewdly observed, and directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris keep the tone and pace of the film lighthearted and breezy (even in its darker moments).
1806;although all the performers are fine, Toni Collette is really the one who brings this film to life.
1807;surrealistic events that are happening to them.
1808;And young Abigail Breslin is a natural.
1809;In a way its refreshing to see a film like this with big name stars.
1810;Its got a little bit of everything, and enough of it to keep most viewers happy.
1811;the movie is shot with very well with a mix of shots to capture the road film aspects of the movie and more intimate framing for dramatic moments.
1812;this works great since the actors are playing this film relatively straight.
1813;The entire case from veteran Alan Arkin to newcomer Abigail Breslin do an excellent job.
1814;The characters are believable in their own world, and even though we laugh with them (and at them) they never feel untrue.
1815;The cast has a great script to work with.
1816;The mix of comedy and drama is perfect, and while tragedy occurs during the film, we are left feeling good about the outcome.
1817;the music (song and score) are perfect accompaniments and make me want to seek out the soundtrack.
1818;Of course a certain Rick James song is going to have a whole new meaning for me.
1819;"Our main cast are the ones who could be labeled ""wacky""."
1820;overall a very entertaining film.
1821;Once again, the marketing gives away some of the funniest scenes in an effort to sell the film.
1822;"Loved this movie, although there were times I felt uncomfortable
1823;I especially like stories that show the love of a family with all of their faults, arguments and misguided decisions.
1824;i cried, and I laughed.
1825;The cast in this quirky, very dark comedy make it fresh and very appealing.
1826;fantastically real Toni Colette to the surprisingly layered Greg Kinnear, put heart into a screenplay that likes to go out of its way to be wacky and offkilter.
1827;It is one of those wildly great performances that pop out of nowhere .
1828;his innate humor informs the soul of a man who is brilliant, haunted and observant.
1829;before silliness, but this is often a very entertaining and moving slice of life.
1830;My boyfriend assured me this was going to be my new favorite movie.
1831;F**k beauty pageants, as Dwayne said?PLEASE stop overrating this film!
1832;This could be such a cute movie for all ages if the grampa would clean up his mouth, his nose, and his library.
1833;Don't missunderstand, because I thought the movie was hilarious.
1834;But this movie turned out to be a wonderful surprise.
1835;this was like eavesdropping on a real family, a family of real people who care about each other and who draw us into caring about them.
1836;As I was watching, I was reminded of the 1970's TV documentary featuring the Loud Family.
1837;But I think """"Sunshine"""" succeeds."""
1838;"It has the ring of truth
1839;It captures what could be the plausible dynamics between family members as they, with all their diverse preoccupations, take to the road to get their little daughter to the spot she qualified for by default in a California beauty pageant.
1840;But it seems all the members of this """"Miss Sunshine"""" movie family are nave on that score."""
1841;And there is a disconnect between the little girl's looks and the talent presentation that her grandfather coached her into preparing.
1842;I rode along with this family in their clutch.
1843;the characters were all stunning.
1844;follow him around for a day and steal all his expressions, eye rolling, clothes?
1845;there were places of laugh out loud funny, that were so amazingly brilliant .
1846;One funny scene after another, but never slap.
1847;That is the genius of the writing.
1848;"never, but, ""this is life ."
1849;"and it is a wonderful funny hoot!"""
1850;I am tempted to tell you cute funny tid.
1851;what makes this so endearing, is how this family all love each other so much.
1852;but deeper than that is the relationships.
1853;The way the brother loves his little sister, and she loves him.
1854;I could cry, so sweet.
1855;the funniest, most endearing film in a long long long time.
1856;The timing of the film's theatrical release with the latest bombshell about the JonBenet case is practically uncanny.
1857;"A real winner, he tells the family, is someone ""who's not so afraid of losing he's afraid to try."""
1858;Apart from some raw language, this is a family film recommended for all dysfunctional families who enjoy crying as much as laughing together.
1859;"at the same time, thanks to inventive scripting and directing, this little gem transcends the ""family film"" genre, providing moments of subtlety, nuance, and genuine ""life."""
1860;"And again the mom is the one member of the family who has sufficient confidence in her daughter to sense that the men's concern about Olive's being ""laughed at"" speaks less about Olive than their own childish fears and self."
1861;finally, by making Grandpa the unlikely voice of wisdom, the film takes on universal, life.
1862;count this one is an all.
1863;"an entertaining, formulaic movie with enough twists, vitality, heart, and thought to almost atone for all of those long, dull ""Talledega Nights"" which moviegoers increasingly have to endure as part of their desensitizing training."
1864;It has all the witty adult humor you could ask for.
1865;"It's very well written and carefully though out (like calling it ""sunshine"" when it's actually kind of a dark movie)."
1866;Thank you for your quick attention to this order.
1867;It arrived quicker than expected and was very happily received.
1868;Nothing really extraordinary about this movie.
1869;Little Miss Sunshine shows the strength of that family bond and it is a surprise to them all when they pull (or push) together.
1870;It takes the innocence of the child to spark the love, sacrifice and forgiveness the characters experience.
1871;Grandpa exhibits the unconditional love for Olive that inspires the others to put their problems aside and support her as she does her very best at the Little Miss Sunshine Pagent.
1872;All the broken and desparate members of one family are redeemed and learn that loving one another is the only way in this imperfect world.
1873;This film goes places, exposing winner.
1874;By the time the family hits the beauty competition in Redondo Beach, having traveled from New Mexico in a VW bus that definitely has some health problems, you'll think you've seen everything the writers could throw at you.
1875;glam contests was seriously the funniest thing I've seen in a theatre all year.
1876;If that's true, the man needs a hug, stat.
1877;LMS takes a big old bellyflop into a family held together by the barest shreds of convention.
1878;laced to truly let go.
1879;Olive is just a wonderful young person, and fortunately the story more or less revolves around her.
1880;The family decides to help Olive with her dream of winning the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in Redondo Beach.
1881;Fortunately, the humor is biting, but not savage, and you will laugh more than you will cringe.
1882;"clever (marks of a Sundance fave), ""LMS"" nevertheless brings the goods."
1883;Fine acting across the board saves the film, and at the end of the day, the Hoover family has restored some dignity and sanity to the world.
1884;Each member of the family brings their own brand of humor and tragedy to the mix.
1885;This film is a prime example of how dark comedy should be done, the film has it's fair share of dark, sad, and tragic scenes, but these moments are balanced with a healthy amount of light and humor to keep the film from being too depressing.
1886;Paul Dano's portrayal of Dwayne as an unhappy teenager who has taken a vow of silence until he reaches his goal of being an air force pilot, is both subdued and very emotional, particularly after he discovers he's colorblind.
1887;The youngest member of the family, Olive, brilliantly portrayed by the lovely Abigail Breslin, is clearly affected by all of the dysfunction which constantly surrounds her, as she suffers from obesity and low self.
1888;esteem, and her weird, and slightly disturbing dance towards the end also shows how messed up she really is.
1889;I thoroughly enjoyed this film, with it's hilarious comedy and oddly sympathetic characters.
1890;"The acting was decent all around, and the film has a good balance of comedy and drama, unlike some other supposed ""dramedies"" like Everything Must Go and Margot at the Wedding, which are basically dark dramas with a few funny scenes added in to lighten the overall mood."
1891;great movie if you love that quirky family who's trying to keep it together thing.
1892;the characters are great .
1893;still, very good, realistic, somewhat satirical movie.
1894;You will experience almost every emotion with this movie.
1895;It is such a great, great story.
1896;I highly recommend it to almost everyone.
1897;It leaves you laughing and feeling good!
1898;I bought this movie on a whim.
1899;When the movie ended, I realized that they are in fact the most normal people at the beauty pagent, and are a stronger family for having traveled together.
1900;I highly recommend this movie.
1901;I just love this movie.
1902;Really clever, fun, moving, beautiful.
1903;I imagine it's not everyone's cup of tea, but if you like a clever and quirky movie with great acting and a real cast of characters, you'll like Little Miss Sunshine a lot.
1904;This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in the last few years.
1905;This is the result of a combination of fascinating characters, great dialogues and outstanding performances by an all.
1906;On top of that, the final scene is so unexpected and hilarious that you will be rolling on the floor laughing.
1907;She has one of the most dysfunctional and peculiar families you can think of.
1908;Her father, Richard, has created a nine.
1909;Her mother, Sheryl, likes to be brutally honest, feeds her family chicken out of a bucket every night and hides her smoking habit.
1910;Olive's grandpa also lives with the family.
1911;the dialogues are so good that it is unreal.
1912;For example, the honest approach of Sheryl led to a discussion during dinner in which Frank ended up explaining about his suicide attempt.
1913;Now Olive has the chance to take her place and compete for the national title.
1914;The result is a road trip to California with the whole family in an old yellow van.
1915;Arkin's is the best performance of the bunch, but the other members of the cast do not lag far behind.
1916;Greg Kinnear and Steve Carell play their roles convincingly, and Paul Dano really shows us how a conflicted teenager behaves.
1917;Abigail Breslin deservedly got an Oscar nomination for her performance, and she joins the group of outstanding kids in movies, like Elijah Wood, Macaulay Culkin and Ivana Baquero.
1918;If you want to have a good time and laugh for a while there are few options better than this one.
1919;It's great to be able to see a movie that doesn't rely on special effects and blood.
1920;All of us have run into road blocks (literal and spiritual) just like the Hoovers.
1921;it's there, they can see the hotel, they just can't figure out how to get there.
1922;One of the best gangster movie.
1923;Full of accurate fashion and great acting.
1924;Very entertaining all the way to the end!!!
1925;Surprisingly, I found it hilarious and to a limited degree, meaningful:.
1926;, each of them loves and supports each other through various hurdles, making the family tie stronger in the end.
1927;Sorry that the many Oscar Nominations had devalued it, artistically speaking.
1928;Nevertheless, a very entertaining movie not to be missed!
1929;This is a funny and touching movie with a sharply observed script and fine performances from all the cast.
1930;And the journey is, of course, a cathartic one for all concerned.
1931;This was a cute film, that really flys because of some wonderful performances.
1932;The story is essentially about a plucky little girl, whose belief in herself and inner spirit makes members of her family realize things about life and what's ultimately important.
1933;The acting is top notch in this, with Arkin winning an Academy Award for his great preformance, but it's the little girl that steals the show with her eyes that convey so much in their innocent gaze.
1934;This movie does an extremely good job at poking fun at that.
1935;the whole family is here and there's someone you can relate to.
1936;she's a very freaky girl!
1937;This movie really hit home for me.
1938;The fact that it is Oscar nominated for best picture gives validation to my disrespect for the Oscars.
1939;Nothing that she did in the movie is award worthy, there are any number of children actors that act better and have done a better job in roles than she did, Will Smith's son in Pursuit of happyness for example.
1940;I frowned through most of it.
1941;This time it's form uses a little girl, a dysfunctional family and a beauty pageant.
1942;There is nothing cute or special about this movie.
1943;This movie contained a very humorous (albeit dark) look interactions between its members.
1944;I am not a Steve Carell fan but he was very good.
1945;Have loved Greg Kinear since Talk Soup.
1946;Alan Arkin was perfect for his role.
1947;I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to put the FUN back in dysfunction.
1948;Each character was played perfectly.
1949;First I traveled back in time to the era of which I grew up.
1950;I laughed, cried, loved and disliked grandpa.
1951;I love how this family came together and realized what it's all about.
1952;The contest performance at the end is great!
1953;A refreshing comedy that follows a family in a beauty pageant.
1954;Filled with awkward scenarios that are all too similar to real life, the movie brings refreshing realism to the big screen.
1955;The summer of 2006 flicks just keep getting better!
1956;"First we had the brilliant and hillarious writing of Kevin Smith in ""Clerks 2"", then the fun of ""Snakes on a Plane."""
1957;The fantastic performances take what on the page is simply a cute little movie and elevate it to a comedic gem!Greg Kinnear .
1958;"wound father obsessed with his ""9 steps"" program for success, he walks a fine line between annoying and sympathetic
1959;she's got the most difficult role: playing the straight man to everyone else, and she does it well, providing the perfect balanceAbigail Breslin .
1960;It's nice to see a young actress actually act rather than just be cute.
1961;but Carrell thankfully never takes the character in that direction, giving him dignity and a brilliant subtle humorAlan Arkin .
1962;old Dwayne how he should being living his life (which I won't spoil by revealing the details) is one of the funniest scenes in the moviePaul Dano .
1963;But even without words, Dano still imbues Dwayne with hilarity, intelligence, and dignity.
1964;one other great thing about this film: the teaser posters .
1965;are a brilliant marketing idea.
1966;the best Ive seen in quite awhile .
1967;Now this film is a bit on the odd ball side, it is funny, and I like it, I don't think it was Oscar worthy, but then I didn't think the Movie """"Babe"""" ( the pig one ) was best Movie and it won, """"Apollo 13"""" was much better for that yrs Oscar, but Hollywod didn't want Tom Hanks to have 3 in a row."""
1968;lol Anyway as I was saying it's a cute film but NOT for kids.
1969;There was a lot of profanity for a family theme.
1970;This movie definitely has one of the best scripts I've seen in the recent past.
1971;"And the real icing on the cake is the last 10 minutes when you will ""Roll on the Floor Laughing""."
1972;One of the best movies I've seen this year.
1973;I just loved this movie.
1974;It was funny in a way that felt true and good.
1975;I saw this in the theater with my brother and we pitched such a fit during the scene with the horn.
1976;I laughed harder in a public place than I have in years.
1977;All around, the best movie I have seen in 2006.
1978;While I think most everyone relates to Olive at some point, the fully represented dynamic of the nutty family is probably equally familiar.
1979;I loved everything about this film, except that it ended.
1980;This movie is in my all time top ten.
1981;This is an absolute must see.
1982;Whenever I have a sick friend, I make a basket of funny movies and this is always their favorite.
1983;It is the most enjoyable flick of 2006, IMHO.
1984;There are some unexpected twists and a creative ending.
1985;On the surface a classic Road Trip of a disfunctional family but on reflection the story of a bonding journey that cements the family around the dream of a little girl.
1986;A great cast that works well together.
1987;Let me start by saying 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a quirky, yet delightful gem.
1988;The story is pretty original and all the actors do an amazing job, especially the young girl who plays Olive and Steve Carell in a more serious role for him, rather than the usual slapstick he does.
1989;At just over 90 minutes this film is perfect for those lazy afternoons and although there are many laugh out loud moments, there are also some warm and touching moments as well.
1990;A great little film that is well worth a viewing.
1991;Hilarious, from start to finish.
1992;It was a great show and I loved the moral of the whole thing that family comes first, no matter what!
1993;In the midst of all this mess, the family has a chance to redeem itself and start acting.
1994;well, normal!I enjoyed Little Miss Sunshine.
1995;It works well with the excellent cast (I expect some Oscar nods, especially for Collette, Arkin, and young Breslin), funny dialogue, and road setting.
1996;The character development is great, and the ending is worth living room applause.
1997;It had great characters, all with their own quirks, working together to tell a funny story.
1998;Greg Kinnear, steve carrell and Arkin are a gass in this very funny film.
1999;but somehow it is made fresh here.
2000;the gag where they push the van is very good.
2001;A bright spot in an otherwise bleak year for cinema.
2002;"To its credit this film features a lively group of eccentric characters, in their own defiant ways doing to the TV sort of ""family values"" what satire requires should be done to them."
2003;This trip, I'd argue, with its ups and downs is the best part of the film .
2004;the journey itself infinitely superior to what ends it.
2005;17m:15s)#No One Gets Left Behind .
2006;I heard from a lot of people what a great and funny movie this was.
2007;This movie had us laughing so hard at the end of the movie!
2008;It seems our creative community can do nothing but sneer.
2009;What a whacked out comedy.
2010;This movie is a sleeper gem!
2011;"I loved the story of this dysfunctional family's trip to the Little Miss Sunshine beauty contest between teen girls
2012;Abigail Breslin was also nominated and the film was included in the best picture category.
2013;i listed so many of the cast because this dark comedy is filled with good performances.
2014;The story is mainly driven by dialogue with the exception of a couple of situations.
2015;the presentation was excellent for such a low budget movie.
2016;i would recommend this intelligent comedy to anyone who doesn't need to be bullied into laughter with slapstick.
2017;this is the type of story that has plenty of replay value as it will be fun to revisit these people and spend a while in their dysfunctional lives.
2018;ray, I heartily recommend this presentation.
2019;I personally think that Blood Diamond or Pan's Labrynth deserved its spot as Best Picture Nominee, but still very good.
2020;This is an odd film and it's down right creepy in places, but it also makes you smile too.
2021;In that sense it is like real life.
2022;ager, but he really does love his family.
2023;ager with a heart he tries to hide.
2024;He even apologizes to his family at one point.
2025;Toni Collette is perfect as the caring by burned out wife to a pipe.
2026;Alan Arkin is convincing as the grandfather and a very restrained Steve Carell is perfectly cast as the gay brother who attempts suicide early in the film.
2027;Paul Dano gives a interesting performance as the son who can't stand living in the """"hell"""" of his dysfunctional family."""
2028;"Lastly Abigail Breslin, ""Signs"" fame, is wonderfully cast, as the forever optimistic girl who longs to be the next ""Little Miss Sunshine"", but already is in our hearts and her family's hearts."
2029;She is just irresistible in the role.
2030;What makes this quiet little gem of a movie work is the trust the screenplay writer and director afford to the audience.
2031;without spoiling where the action takes you, I'll just say that the acting is strong but it's the ensemble that really works here, not one specific actor's acumen.
2032;I guess that's why I liked it so much.
2033;little Miss Sunshine surprised me with it's ability to be simple, yet brilliant in it's simplicity.
2034;The highest point next to the balanced script was the great ensemble work from the actors.
2035;The characters all have interesting relationships with each other as well as a lot of backstory to add to the overall plot.
2036;A perfectly cast movie with each actor getting a chance to shine.
2037;It's rated R for a reason.
2038;But if you enjoy offbeat humor and complex character driven movies, check it out.
2039;I saw this film when it came out and found it thoroughly heart warming.
2040;What I missed was Greg Kinnear's finely turned performance as the father.
2041;It was easy to overlook his performance there in favor of his model good looks.
2042;But seeing the film again recently, he accomplishes a marvel portraying a gentle but not effeminate Gay man who is totally devoted to his work as an artist.
2043;He is now forty six and well into middle age.
2044;The good looks are blunted but still there.
2045;He is now portraying a father just as convincingly as he portrayed a drop dead gorgeous young Gay man.
2046;It's time this phenomenally gifted actor received the parts and recognition he deserves!
2047;Little Miss Sunshine is a wonderful film, but try watching it with your attention focused on Kinnear.
2048;I even got my husband to see it, and he enjoyed it as much as I did.
2049;All those who didn't enjoy it, relax and watch it again.
2050;This movie is simply a beautiful story.
2051;This movie is soooo funny.
2052;The funniest movie of the decade, and perhaps of all time .
2053;Cool bonus feature: Four alternate endings!
2054;not only are the characters and actors themselves pitch perfect, but the cinematography is beautiful and unique.
2055;The theater was packed with people to see this, and everyone, everyone was just howling.
2056;A HAVE to see movie.
2057;just good clean fun (and do you see parts of your own ring of relatives here?)
2058;It's a good movie for the family to watch and enjoy together.
2059;I was surprised that I like it ao much.
2060;I just saw a sneak peak of this movie and I LOVED it!
2061;each character is brilliantly cast and the acting is first rate.
2062;Their characters are so believable.
2063;in one scene where husband and wife are arguing, you can see the ghosts of past arguments in Toni Collettes eyes.
2064;"there's a real ""feel"" to this movie."
2065;The costumes are great too.
2066;Very subtle, but meaningful affects, right down to little Olive's wedgie in the bathing suit competition.
2067;I know I should tell you what the movie is about, but that would take the fun out of it.
2068;You should go and experience the ride like the rest of the family.
2069;"The ending ""talent"" part of the little miss sunshine contest is hilarious, and the actress that played Olive should win an award for her fine performance."
2070;I will warn you, this is a quirky movieand the humor is a bit dark, but I think you will definately enjoy this movie.
2071;I had to watch this for a class assignment but was pleasantly surprised!
2072;Very cute, glad that my professor assigned this movie.
2073;7 year old girls in high heels, in their bathing suits, with their bigger than their head hairdos and not to mention the balls to the walls make up.
2074;I mean honestly whoever thought this was a great idea?
2075;i can actually sum of the movie in one sentence.
2076;In between states and cities, we get to see the craziness up close and personal.
2077;Her performance as a whole is much better than that, don't be fooled by that useless scene.
2078;And just how he consistently developed the nitty gritty of the character.
2079;the movie appropriately hit its climax in the beauty pageant itself.
2080;"It was touching when the rest of the family sort of had an ""aha"" moment about how this pageant is going to damage this little girl's self."
2081;"But the absolute funniest scene was when Olive started to do the ""stripper"" routine."
2082;The look on everyone's face was priceless.
2083;It was sweet and moving at the same time.
2084;I'm dumbfounded by all the people claiming this is the funniest movie they've ever seen.
2085;i have yet to hear/read of a ''winner'' doing anything in regards to helping anyone.
2086;A classic comedy about how families, no matter how dysfunctional, can pull together for each other.
2087;The actors portrayed the characters so well and the laughs were heart felt.
2088;The is one of the best movies I have seen in years.
2089;On an important level, these people are us.
2090;"Do all of us win all the time?True, in a sense, everyone in the family is a ""loser."""
2091;These do not sound like unusual problems to me, but together, they do make for a lot of really funny and poignant moments.
2092;This is a movie filled with humor and humanity.
2093;"It is a wonderful antidote to a myth that would make us all feel like ""losers"" when things don't go our way."
2094;and by the way, I don't laugh easily at movies.
2095;But I laughed so hard at the end of this movie that my glasses steamed up.
2096;I kind of came into this movie in the middle but all I can say from what I saw is when the little girl did her talent performance.
2097;quirky, not your average, everyday family, but family nonetheless.
2098;If you grew up in a dysfunctional family, this movie will bring back to those wonderful times.
2099;while this car scene is the funniest thing you'll ever see.
2100;This is an overall entertaining indie film, until the end.
2101;The little girls wear makeup, adult style bikinis and evening gowns, and perform lewd song and dance routines.
2102;But pick one message, and be consistent.
2103;It was a fine film until the end.
2104;Little Miss Sunshine, the new independent comedy, is that rare thing.
2105;It is a delightful film filled with memorable performances, in one case, the actor's best performance.
2106;Sheryl brings him to the family home in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
2107;"Uncle and nephew have to share a room together
2108;Sheryl and Richard's little girl, Olive (Abigail Breslin) is a budding beauty queen and spends every available moment with Grandpa working on her routine for any upcoming beauty contest.
2109;Olive will be able to participate in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in Redondo Beach.
2110;The family is going on a road trip.
2111;Little Miss Sunshine, written by Michael Arndt (his first film) and directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (who previously worked on music videos for REM and Janet Jackson), is a delightful comedy.
2112;It creates genuine moments of laughter and also manages to tell a touching story.
2113;Every single moment seems to fit with every other moment, so if you aren't laughing during a particular scene, there is a very believable reason for this.
2114;Sunshine is all the more amazing because it is the first film from these people to hit the multiplex screens.
2115;Sunshine caused a bit of a stir at the last Sundance Film Festival.
2116;I guarantee you the creative process was a lot more streamlined because they had fewer people to add their two cents and `suggest' changes and fiddle with the end product.
2117;The writer and directors have created a lively, interesting, funny film about a family falling apart at the seams.
2118;In """"Sunshine"""", the story progresses naturally to its surprising conclusion."""
2119;Yes, I know it seems odd to say natural and surprising in the same sentence, but it works in this film.
2120;Once we see what is happening in the resolution, everything just fits.
2121;Its hilarious, but human and we can honestly say the family does the right thing.
2122;As they travel along the highway, watching every penny, much of the humor derives from their close, confined proximity.
2123;This makes us all the more receptive to the laughter because we are able to anticipate when a laugh might be coming, yet the filmmakers change it and make it unexpected, making it even more funny.
2124;the cast is universally excellent.
2125;Toni Collette is very good as Sheryl, the mother of the family.
2126;She makes sure everyone is moving together, trying to keep everyone on the same page, yet she is a modern day mom and is pulled in many directions at once.
2127;Rushing from her job to the hospital, she walks in to see her brother still wearing her work uniform.
2128;greg Kinnear is also very good as Richard, the budding self.
2129;This is easily Kinnear's best performance to date.
2130;In one hilarious scene, he starts to impose his self.
2131;help teachings on young Olive, as the family sits at a diner, enjoying breakfast.
2132;It is a funny, funny performance showing a man at the edge of his rope.
2133;steve Carell is, as always, very funny.
2134;paul Dano is very good as Dwayne, the sullen teenager who hates everyone in his family.
2135;He seems real, interesting, unusual and believable.
2136;alan Arkin is easily the star of the group.
2137;He talks openly and frankly about sex, imploring Dwayne to have sex with as many women as possible, he's young, and he should be having a lot of sex, experiment.
2138;abigail Breslin is a real find as Olive, the little girl who has a dream of becoming a beauty queen.
2139;She is simply perfect as a child who is sheltered, yet inquisitive.
2140;a. likes she is competing against.
2141;Olive is an endearing character and Breslin does a great job.
2142;The finale is a hoot, but again, every person here loses their dream.
2143;The payoff a broad comedy aims at the arthouse crowd.
2144;There's nothing funny about this family, yet as they all are crowded into a Volkswagen bus for a road trip to the Little Miss Sunshine contest, we find ourselves laughing out loud, often hysterically at this sometimes dark, sometimes slapstick, but always clever comedy.
2145;the film works because of its ensemble cast that works together to bring out the humorous nuances of the troy.
2146;Toni Collette is convincing as Sheryl the working mother trying to keep her family together and throughout the film, she's the only sane personality.
2147;Greg Kinnear is Sheryl's husband and is a convincing hapless self help guru we want to shake into reality but also someone we feel for as well.
2148;"Paul Dano is believable as Dwayne and Abigail Breslin plays the young Olive rather sweetly and truly is a ""Little Miss Sunshine"" (you'll have to watch to see if she actually wins the crown."
2149;It's one of those comedies that can generate laughs over and over.
2150;This is a film you won't soon forget and can be enjoyed over and over.
2151;I'll usually watch this movie once a year.
2152;Little Miss Sunshine is a classic.
2153;Little Miss Sunshine is the Oscar.
2154;The cast is an impeccable ensemble of Hollywood's relative newcomers and veterans, and legend.
2155;Young Abigail Breslin really shines, though, and even earned an Oscar nod for her unforgettable performance.
2156;little Miss Sunshine seems mildly humorous, with spots of black humor and somber heart.
2157;warming moments, for the first three quarters of the film.
2158;It truly is charming and warm and you do really fall in love with the characters, but the film offers so much more than just family dysfunction.
2159;It's also a sharp satire of child beauty pageants.
2160;The last scene, at the pageant, is the funniest scene in any film released last year.
2161;little Miss Sunshine walks the delicate line of dark humor and family comedy with such precision and passion.
2162;I personally think of this film very funny and am going to get it Blu Ray soon but I got for my friend and she enjoys it a lot very funny!!
2163;Oh my god, I can't begin to explain how much I love this movie.
2164;It's so genuinely funny and has such a great, original story.
2165;Each character is so unique and funny in their own hilarious way.
2166;There's also a message to it, which adds to how amazing this movie is.
2167;Little Miss Sunshine is a classic comedy that has a warm touch to it and I can guarantee you'll fall in love this movie as much as I did.
2168;You'll be better off and it will be more enjoyable I promise.
2169;Great character plot of some extreme individuals.You will love it from start to finish.
2170;Sit back, relax, have a chuckle, and enjoy!!
2171;Just When I Thought Hollywood had run out of Ideas, A Little Film such as This proves Me Wrong!
2172;The ending when the LIttle girl does her Talent in the Beauty Pageant is Hilarious!
2173;I highly recommend this film and I hope is gets the oscar nominations that it deserves!
2174;I was looking for something bright and truely insightful and funny with the viewing of this film.
2175;Greg Kinnear is Richard a success obsessed father who developed a mental training method to succeed, and Alan Arkin is a powder.
2176;"many people say ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a funny comedy."
2177;continental journey or the farces at the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, the characters take themselves very seriously, and are determined to be true to themselves.
2178;And their adamant decision might sometimes irritate you.
2179;The characters are not begging to be liked, but still you will notice the changes of heart in every one of them by the end of the story.
2180;the actors are all great.
2181;The filmmakers are clearly helped greatly by their talent .
2182;but the entire cast of the main characters still did a fine job.
2183;It is not my cup of tea, but the film is certainly a good character study, not afraid of showing unlikable part of them.
2184;Little Miss Sunshine is a surprise.
2185;You laugh, you cry but you're always moved till the last minute.
2186;Every actor is just terrific, especially Steve Carell, so funny as usual.
2187;It's a brilliant comedy, that has quite rightly received a great amount of awards.
2188;This is the children's beauty pageant you always wanted to see.
2189;There are scenes in this movie that will stick in my memory providing residual laughter long down the line.
2190;But this film is delightfully surprising from the very beginning.
2191;alan Arkin is a treasure, and it is obvious how much fun he had playing this role.
2192;Arkin is a seasoned, veteran actor who has played many roles in his career, however I will always think of him as the porno addicted Grandpa.
2193;He brilliantly portrays a person who does not want to grow, and yet does, in bits and pieces, because he has no other choice.
2194;any film that Steve Carell is in is worth watching.
2195;He has such a quiet way of embodying the characters he portrays.
2196;if you want a guaranteed laugh out loud movie that will pick up your Spirits and brighten your day, this is a must.
2197;I love this movie .
2198;but I do think you need to have a certain sense of humor to enjoy it.
2199;There are two children in the family as well.
2200;Later, each of the family have unexpected moments of shock and emotion.
2201;LIttle Miss Sunshine is absolutely marvelous, from the opening scene to the ending.
2202;The story has a truly realistic take on a dysfunctional family that makes it feel so real.
2203;The whole main cast all fit perfectly in their roles with a lot of humor, drama, and spirit.
2204;The camerawork even makes you feel like you're actually with the Hoovers wherever they go.
2205;LMS is truly one of the best indie films of all time, as well as one of my all.
2206;it's a movie that will put people in a laughter, shock, and enjoyment with its realistic tone.
2207;The film even had me thinking that we're all very lucky to have our loved ones with us when we need them the most.
2208;LMS has an ingredient that helps it become so incredible: family.
2209;"final Verdict: ""Little Miss Sunshine"" takes a realistic and unforgettable idea about a family and their adventures on the road."
2210;This movie was funny and sad and so good.
2211;It played very well and I hope to watch it many more times.
2212;Little Miss Sunshine is the surprise indie hit of my 2006 movie watching year.
2213;The family includes a cantankerous, sex.
2214;working mother, patient as a saint, glue that holds this family together.
2215;Abigail Breslin is adorable and full of hope as Olive.
2216;as they make the trip to California, something happens that changes their lives.
2217;Satirical, touching, hysterically funny and terribly sad, this film is a must.
2218;The entire cast is incredibly good.
2219;little Miss Sunshine is a delicious blend of bitter and sweet.
2220;I loved this movie: it's hilarious, charming, and uplifting in a tragicomic way.
2221;This is destined to be a cult classic, with great performances from the entire cast.
2222;A fantastic cast and a daring screenplay make this one worth owning.
2223;"Little Miss Sunshine is a great ""feel good"" movie."
2224;I recommend it for everybody but our small children as some of the language is rather coarse.
2225;I thought this movie sounded so cute.
2226;Like the beauty pageant: in the script, it was much bigger, more outlandish and more climactic.
2227;Many of the comic effects (like double.
2228;the best character in the story was the yellow VW bus.
2229;winning performances, nor should this have been a Best Picture nominee.
2230;The directors took this script and tried to make it a cross between the outlandishly funny, off.
2231;I think Hollywood is so enthralled with their own quirkiness and weirdness that they interpret anything quirky and weird as being funny and great entertainment.
2232;Now, I like quirky, but I draw the line at weird.
2233;I'm sure you've met people who are so Very Ugly that they're actually Beautiful.
2234;[A howling blizzard in Antarctica perhaps, viewed from the warm safety of your living room.]
2235;some reviewers have remarked on how well dysfuntionality is captured here.
2236;and it's a big one.
2237;And, yes, as other reviewers have said, her act in the talent competition is wonderful, amazing, and memorable.
2238;getting the movie's point across very nicely.
2239;He tells her she's the most beautiful girl in the world, and she shyly demurs.
2240;"But he insists, and then comes up with a great line to the effect that ""And I'm saying that, not because of the brilliance of your mind, or your precocious intellect, or because of your accomplishments, but because you're goddamned gorgeous."""
2241;The fact that she is anything BUT gorgeous gives the scene a powerful poignancy that makes up for many shortcomings earlier and later in the plot.
2242;A wonderful and memorable moment in an otherwise rather forgettable film.
2243;The characters are quirky and unique, but entirely dsyfunctional.
2244;It seems to have a weird start for a comedy but give it a minuet and you will be laughing.
2245;Great and funny human interest story and what a great ending!
2246;good type movie with an excellent cast.
2247;You may find it interesting to note that the script is available online.
2248;The characters represent a broad spectrum of personalities and disorders.
2249;I laughed the hardest when the horn in the VW van starts beeping irratically.
2250;Further when the master of ceremonies asks the little girl who taught her to dance she gives credit to her grandfather.
2251;I just watched this for the second time last night and enjoyed it as much as when I saw it in the theaters.
2252;Everyone gives absolutely wonderful performances.
2253;"Greg Kinnear is especially pitch perfect as the ""Tony Robbins."
2254;"Abigail Breslin is absolutely amazing as the little girl eager to participate in the pageant, having been ""coached"" by her grandfather, Alan Arkin, for her performance in the competition."
2255;there are both laugh out loud moments, funny awkward family moments that anyone with some dysfunctional family or family members can relate to and some more subtly funny commentaries on people and society as a whole.
2256;The final 20 minutes of the movie was perfectly written/directed.
2257;an innocent 7 year just having fun .
2258;This is definitely worth seeing once, due to some excellent casting, sharp writing, and a few surprises.
2259;Abby Breslin as the pageant contestant is superb, but there are several moments of tension or sadness in here which, while well.
2260;done, do outrank the laughs.
2261;Uncle wants to be an academic success and he can't.
2262;off in an ancient VW minibus, with mechanical condition that fully matches their personal condition .
2263;if you enjoy the kind of entertainment that leaves you happy that you're not them, you'll love it.
2264;An interesting film that was not released on a large in theaters, little miss sunshine is a film that is likely to be seen big on the awards stages in the next few months.
2265;An interesting view into a dysfunctional family that again proves that dysfunction can function if given the right ingredients.
2266;I did think the ending was predictable (the routine produced by grandpa), but it was funny.
2267;I would expect at least a few nominations at the golden globes and oscars, and hopefully it will take home a couple.
2268;Greg Kinnear does well, and Steve Carrell was great.
2269;One of my favorite films of all time.
2270;dozen times and look forward to seeing it again and again.
2271;focused movies but this one is great.
2272;A highly heterogeneous disfunctional family .
2273;At the end they realize what's important .
2274;to have fun and don't try to please everybody around you.
2275;A story of a dysfunctional family coming together in triumph.
2276;All of the family were stars!
2277;Interesting to see how this family comes together and shows support for each other.
2278;"Christian bashing is alive and well as the teen boy wears a t. shirt saying ""Jesus Was Wrong"" the entire movie."
2279;Little Miss Sunshine is best viewed as the surprise sleeper independent film that made it big.
2280;The truth is, this film is an interesting, sometimes funny, almost poignant look at a dysfunctional family.
2281;on the other hand, all of the acting is superb.
2282;Steve Carrell is surprisingly successful as a depressed Proust scholar.
2283;I could go on about the rest of the cast, but they all nail their characters.
2284;esque acting talent which really makes the film.
2285;overall, this is an enjoyable film, but really that's all it is.
2286;"It doesn't live up to its great hype, and it never transcends its ""I'm a quirky independent film, love me"" style."
