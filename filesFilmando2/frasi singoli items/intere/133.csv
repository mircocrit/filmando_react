id;spiegazione
1;Most outstanding in this 1964 restored classic is the score, an outstanding '60s soundtrack by Michel Lagrand and dialogue by director Jacques Demy.
2;all elements converge to create '60s French magic as much sweet sorrow's invoked.
3;also here is great cinematagraphy and it should be said this is not one of those schmaltzy Rogers and Hammerstein.
4;well just a bit of schmaltz, but the plot's got an edge, as does the style.
5;I felt bad because it is a movie I watched years ago and liked it a lot
6;Gorgeous and a must have.
7;The music is timeless, treat yourself to this film!
8;This French film from the early 1960s is essentially an opera about two young people, their declarations of undying love, and then subsequently, the peace they make with life.
9;It is very, very beautiful, both visually and musically.
10;I recommend this movie without reservation to any serious student of the history of film.
11;It is also the perfect romantic movie.
12;down the most memorable, moving film I have ever seen.
13;It combines an incredible story, in an historical time frame .
14;with outstanding colors and images, and an outstanding soundtrack by Michel LeGrand.
15;A wonderful musical film from Jacques Demy.
16;First act: Genevieve (a very young Catherine Deneuve) is a teenager living with her mother, with whom she works in a shop that sells umbrellas.
17;He wants to marry Genevieve (despite being pregnant with other man), and eventually Genevieve will agree.
18;Genevieve, now married and with a daughter, arrives with her car to Guy's gas station.
19;Surprised to see each other, they decide to go inside the station to talk, but they both soon realize that their relationship belongs to the past.
20;She goes away, and soon Madeleine and their boy arrive, and they celebrate Christmas by throwing each other snow balls.
21;It's an extremely entertaining and amazingly fluid movie, despite not having the traditional happiness of musical movies.
22;just about sums it up: on the eyes, ears, and heart
23;This movie is odd and unforgettable.
24;The subject matter is realistic, but it's handled so gracefully, it's like watching a fairy tale.
25;There's so many reasons to like this movie
26;Catherine Deneuve is stunning, but then so is the woman who plays her mother, and for that matter, so are her suitors.
27;Everyone in the movie is beautiful.
28;And even if the actors weren't so beautiful, the clothing and backgrounds of sharp oranges and reds and greens are very striking.
29;i've always thought of Michel Legrand as one of the last great songwriters, on par with Henry Mancini and Antonio Carlos Jobim, before they started putting something in the water to stop songwriters from writing good melodies.
30;His music is delightful, ranging from big band to cocktail jazz to some lovely ballads.
31;I Will Wait for You and Watch What Happens became standards, and it's interesting to contrast the familiar lyrics with the various French lyrics in the film.
32;the visual and musical appeal of the film is such that I think it would be a good watch for non.
33;I was literally STUNNED by the beauty of the colors, the details.
34;My husband and I could not stop watching it and it was an absolute delight.
35;After becoming entranced with My Father's Glory and My Mother's Castle, which are also movies in French, I discussed these two movies with another movie lover, and he mentioned the Umbrella's movie.
36;What a great idea, the whole movie in song.
37;In this movie the plot moves right along in a beautiful way, and holds our interest very easily.
38;well, who knows, maybe it was the lovely Catherine Denueve, she was so ethereal and fragile.
39;i give this movie a big recomendation!
40;After 50+ years of movies, few stay in my heart as much as this one.
41;Music, colors are ravishing,This movie is better the 5th time around!
42;This is a French release with subtitles in English for the American viewing public.
43;It is a grand production of Michel Legrand's marvelous score, which makes me wish for the old Maurice Chevalier French.
44;It almost always happened to the most popular and best.
45;the music was sweeping and kept the action going.
46;i'm still stumped to this day.
47;The story is sophmoric, but I bought it for two other reasons.
48;How maybe it was the war that got in the way, but perhaps it was the best after all.
49;It is nevertheless a charming movie with a young and beautiful catherine deneuve.
50;Loved this film when saw it after it opened and loved it.
51;love the music, the stars and how beautiful it is filmed.
52;A bit sad, but you can make happiness,and overcome whatever you think will knock you down.
53;When I was young I found the picture beautyfull.
54;now I,m much older ,but the film is as young and fresh as ever.
55;i,ve a soundtrack too,but seeing the picture nowadays it,fantastic.
56;for me it is a one and only picture in it,s kind.
57;beautifull,see it and you will be the same fan as me.
58;It also has the most haunting score of any movie in the world.
59;If this were a music album it would be called 'Easy Listening' yet the emotions are deep and powerful.
60;it is Jacques Demy's salute to Hollywood musicals and tells the story of a young couple ready to swear eternal love as they marry.
61;The flow of their lives as time passes leads to other paths for them both.
62;A show with a melancholy ending as both find love and goodness in life, yet it isn't what they foresaw for themselves in a time before.
63;This is an ending that allows the viewer to roam the fields of memory for meaning.
64;I watched this beautiful film last night and fell in love again.
65;Catherine Deneuve as Genevieve and Nino Castelnuovo as Guy are just the perfect star.
66;You totally believe their story, even though it is all intense colors, music and seemingly light conversations.
67;Thank you, Jacues Demy, and Michel Lagrand, and all the actors and everyone who worked on this film.
68;It makes life so much better even though life is not always so perfect and yes, very sad too often.
69;what is it good for?
70;Everything is sung which makes it very unique.
71;this is a love story one of those that wasn't meant to be.
72;I LOVED IT and thought it was wonderful.
73;the main love theme in the movie is I Will Wait For You by Michel Legrand.
74;if you like heart warming and heart tugging musicals, you will love this.
75;it is a beautiful and moving experience for the ears, the eyes, and the heart.
76;(the hero is an auto mechanic) to I will love you forever is sung.
77;In the first act, Departure, we are introduced to the heroine and hero, Genevieve (a breathtaking Catherine Deneuve) and Guy.
78;The lover dream, sing, and most of all love each other in this act, which ends with Guy departing for a two.year stint in the Army and Genevieve promising to love him forever.
79;I won't ruin the movie but suffice to say, in Act II (Absence), Genevieve deals with a pregnancy, a rich and ardent suitor and a very practical mother.
80;there is more, much more, to this movie than just song and love.
81;The sets are amazing and rich with candy.
82;Finally, the acting is so deeply felt even though every single line is sung.
83;i cannot recommend this movie enough to lovers not just of French film and movie musicals but of serious cinema in general.
84;It is well worth your time.
85;And you will be humming some of the more popular themes for a long time.
86;The colors, music, story and singing in this movie are great.
87;After watching for about 5 minutes, I woke my wife in the middle of the night to watch it!
88;i am very happy to own this one, and am excited to show it to my friends who are not philistines(sadly too few).
89;But let me promise you something else, Umbrellas of Cherbourg is so lovely a picture, you won't mind the effort it requires to see it through.
90;let me first compliment the restorers who recently returned this enchanting motion picture to its full colorful glory with its pastels and washes of bright hues.
91;old Genevi ve, played by the glowingly beautiful Catherine Deneuve.
92;working nature hides the spirit of a romantic tinged with an undispelled sense of realism.
93;Genevi ve is happy, but a dreamer, and very much infatuated with Guy, who is if anything (as events later show) even more in love with her.
94;Umbrellas of Cherbourg concludes with a bittersweet irony that lingers indelibly in memory, and contrasts with the intense gaiety of the bright scenery ever.
95;umbrellas of Cherbourg is a classic.
96;It was reportedly among the first modern films to draw crowds back again and again, and still remains a movie often noted as among the lifelong favorites of the generation that came of age around the time of its 1964 release.
97;Fortunately, I was able to play it on my new computer and project it onto a large.
98;Still, it is a wonder.
99;filled movie and well worth viewing, even if it does not capture fully the glorious colors if displayed half a century ago.
100;Just make sure the distributor sends you a disc for the right region.
101;Director Jacques Demy's UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG is simply the best tragi.
102;Catherine Deneuve is angelic in the role of a sixteen year girl in love with a car mechanician.
103;run in 1992 of this masterpiece, wrote : If your town doesn't have a theatre playing it, build one !
104;This is a great, award winning movie!
105;I saw it in the theater when it first came out and loved it!
106;I gave it to a friend who loves foreign movies and she loved it too.
107;les Parapluies de Cherbourg is one of the most beautiful movies ever made with an enchanting and haunting score by Michel Le Grande, and totally focused, sharp and creative direction by Jacques Demy.
108;Catherine Deneuve gives a fine performance in pinkish white makeup with her blonde hair pulled away from her famous face, at twenty playing a seventeen.year.
109;The sets are splashed in vivid color.
110;It depends on the circumstances, and sometimes circumstances and the passage of time can change her heart.
111;To be honest I found her more attractive than Deneuve who of course went on to become a great star and an acclaimed international beauty.
112;Additionally, the brief, beautifully structured, final scene at the shiny new Esso gas station is not to be forgotten.
113;But will he still want her when he learns that she is pregnant with another man's child?Jacques Demy who also wrote the script is to be commended for the effortless pace and tight focus of this romantic tale of star crossed lovers.
114;The tale is an atmospheric tour de force of love lost and gained, of bourgeois values triumphant.
115;the film trades the traditional concept of a musical number for an operatic style in which all dialogue is sung.
116;Whether it is the greatest musical or not, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is undeniably an absolutely overwhelming cinematic experience.
117;In addition to being one of the greatest love stories ever to grace the medium, Jacques Demy's film about love and loss is a masterful exercise in style.
118;Catherine Deneuve's performance is sublime.
119;One of the best musicals ever filmed.
120;loud funny, and the more muted, equally dramatic scenes can bring tears to your eyes, are missing out on a treat!
121;She was only twenty years old when she made this film, and she and Nino Castelnuovo, her romantic lead, are lovely together.
122;crossed love, and life throwing rocks on the road to happiness, is classic.
123;The musical score is catchy, and some of the songs might ring familiar in American audience's ears.
124;Jacques Demy's masterpiece is beautifully colour coordinated and every bit of dialogue is sung.
125;It sounds a bit contrived but it is one of the most genuinely moving and purest love stories ever to be committed to celluloid.
126;Michel Legrand's score/songs are gorgeous and a couple of the themes I Will wait For You and Watch what Happens were transferred to hits for other top class artists but have never sounded better than they do here.
127;But from the opening shot of the rain and umbrellas with Legrand's I Will Wait For You coming in softly below you know you are going to witness something really special.
128;This is a profound movie in every sense.
129;What can you say, the story tugs at your heart, Catherine Deneuve is breathtaking, the colors are vibrant, the sung dialog captivating, and the musical score wonderful.
130;It's amazing how far we've changed in the past half century, and on reflection, all of it has certainly not been improvement.
131;All the dialogue is sung in the recitative manner of opera music and lead so naturally into the actual songs that you really can't tell the difference.
132;it is a beautiful story told simply and effectively by one of the French New Wave directors, Jacques Demy.
133;As I understand it, he made a few more musicals starring Catherine Deneuve (The Young Girls of Rochefort, Donkeyskin), but this film was his most popular musical.
134;truthfully, it looks quite fantastic.
135;The colors are briliant enough to rival the Hollywood Technicolor process, and the sound is clean.
136;This marred an otherwise beautiful restoration effort.
137;however, this is still an excellent film, and I would HIGHLY recommend it to any lovers of musicals!
138;In 1964, filmmaker Jacques Demy made an audacious move by directing a deceptively simple love story completely in song.
139;The lovers eventually consummate their relationship once Guy finds he has been drafted to serve for France during the Algerian conflict.
140;The wondrous Catherine Deneuve, all of twenty, had her first important role as Genevieve, and it's no wonder her career seems assured from her ethereal performance.
141;With his earthy good looks and open.
142;along with the vibrant colors faithfully recaptured in a 1996 restoration, such artifices really add to the film's charm.
143;I enjoyed the movie very much but realize this will not be everyone's cup of tea, especially those already alienated by the musical genre.
144;This movie is just SO good.
145;Catherine Deneuve is so beautiful.
146;The movie is just so pretty to look at.
147;the umbrellas, the wallpaper (seriously!)
148;I recommend it to all of my girlfriends who just want to have a night of girliness!
149;Michel Legrand's and Jacques Demy's first collaboration is a visual dream.
150;Such beautiful people, Catherine Deneuve and Anne Vernon.
151;up, dress in such beautifully expensive clothes.
152;the story line has been described to death, so let me just describe the physical beauty of the characters, the sets and the songs.
153;Catherine Deneuve, like a flower, is blossoming into the beauty that she is.
154;there are musical scenes of particular beauty where you feel the music, the singing and the characters as they act it out, to be so good, that it touches you in the deepest part of your mind and emotions.
155;The scene in the jewelry shop, which starts with What beautiful things.
156;as jewels in a box are shown and in comes the most beautiful jewels, Catherine and Anne.
157;The movie is a beautiful gem that will fascinate and satisfy you in all its color,music and the physical beauty of the characters.
158;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg may very well be the best movie ever made.
159;Its a treat for the eyes (the colors are STUNNING.
160;The cinematography is beyond amazing), and the ears (the music.
161;is fantastic), and the cast lights up the screen.
162;Deneuve (nee Dorleac, sister of Francoise who died much too young) is incredibly cute and adorable and Legrand's tunes are effective.
163;It's the beautiful, sweet, adorable, Chanel #5 Catherine Deneuve, who I'm absolutely positively sure can do no wrong.
164;It also has another particularity, in that the entire dialogue is sung, with music .
165;This can add very much emotion to a story if well done, and in this case it is.
166;They come to marry other people, for more practical reasons, and never look back.
167;It is, in essence, a triumph of practicality against romanticism.
168;The music, the sets, the colors, and that INCREDIBLE ending will stick with you for years.
169;A classic for that romantic in us all (and I usually like hardcore horror!)
170;The Winner of Cannes Film Festival's Golden Palm in 1964 and five times Oscar nominee, Jacques Demy's/Michell Legrand The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, is a superb romantic movie.
171;It tells a very simple story of love lost but not forgotten in such enchanting, unusual, and ambitious way with such delightful results that no other musical or romance was able to achieve since.
172;The beauty of the film lies in the unique combination of color and sound.
173;But the more I watched, the more I became overwhelmed by its kind and sweet tenderness and I enjoyed with all my heart the unique romantic delight.
174;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg received a great deal of attention upon its release, becoming one of the most widely seen and greatly praised French films of its decade.
175;But Umbrellas of Cherbourg gives us precisely that, played out against a sometimes jarring, sometimes lyrical jazz.
176;although the film and its story may sound a bit complicated, both are quite simple in execution, and therein lies much of the film's charm.
177;intensity arias or duets or the like performed by powerful voices in Umbrellas of Cherbourg
178;The cinematography is equally clean but surprisingly lyrical, and moves easily between realistic location shots of the city and the highly stylized interior designs.
179;but such is the nature of life, and the tranquility of the film itself allows us to approach their problems with affection rather than intense involvement.
180;still, for all its charm, appeal, and delicate impact, Umbrellas of Cherbourg can take a bit of getting used to.
181;The score features one widely popular melody, known in English as (If It Takes Forever) I Will Wait For You, but the lyricism of this peice is actually a bit atypical of the score, which is often jazzy in a way that seems alien to American ears.
182;But in a curious way the aesthetic distance the music sometimes creates is precisely the element which allows us to approach the film with such tranquility
183;Umbrellas of Cherbourg is an unusual film, yes.
184;It is also a remarkably haunting one, a film that lingers on in the memory like the ghost of lost love from one's own past.
185;created conventions, but those who can will find it a charming, touching, softly.
186;funny, and very memorable experience.
187;with ideal casting (the young Catherine Deneuve is simply ravishing) and lovely voices (she's dubbed by a major French pop star, but you'd never know it) and the most romantic music (Legrand) since Puccini, this film is not only surpassingly enjoyable, it is unforgettable.
188;In its new digital incarnation the colors are back in all their glory and the movie is breathtaking again.
189;With American soldiers away from home now in seemingly neverending foreign wars, Parapluies has a new relevance.
190;The songs are award winning and Catherine is the ingenue de jour in this pic!
191;It was a sad movie but the music was good and the acting was very good.
192;I got caught up and carried along to the end .
193;by Michel Legrand's glorious music .
194;by director Jacques Demy's and cinematographer Jean Rabier's vibrant visuals .
195;by the the highly appealing cast.
196;This story is far more sophisticated, even daring to end on a beautifully understated scene.
197;The libretto (like that of most operas and operettas) is very sentimental and only the opera format keeps it from being sickly saccharine.
198;It all adds up to something unique and daring .
199;and worth a try by someone looking for a new film experience.
200;In Les parapluies de Cherbourg we have frames that look like paintings, music that is unforgettable and a talent to tell a story like few directors have.
201;Beautiful to look at, listen to, and study.
202;A timeless French cinematic MASTERPIECE from 1964.
203;after some searching, I was fortunate to acquire the magnificent double.
204;The young and ravishingly gorgeousCatherine Deneuve has never looked so beautiful as she does here.
205;Cinema and art at its finest from French director Jacque Demy, winning the1964 Cannes Film Festival Grand Prize.
206;One of the most emotionally romantic movies ever made.
207;500 million stars for thestunning, brilliant, and beautiful Umbrellas of Cherbourg, a classic timepiece from a long.
208;i took some comparison captures of the two discs on my computer and the results are astonishing.
209;there's a long technical explanation, but basically they found a way around this for NTSC.
210;There's nothing missing they're just moving at a higher speed than intended, causing everything to move ever so slightly faster and voices and music to go to a higher pitch.
211;Still, that means five extra minutes of eye.
212;The music is familiar and tinged with nostalgia for another long gone time of innocence and youthful passion.
213;Catherine Deneuve is heartbreakingly beautiful.
214;This has been one of my favorite movies for years.
215;since so many other reviewers have described the plot, I'll just wax poetic about the music, the color, the exquisiteness of Catherine Deneuve .
216;and 42 years later, she's still beautiful!
217;La Deneuve, of course, is still so beautiful it is not to be believed.
218;this movie is to be treasured!
219;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a fantastic film with a deceptively simple story, outrageous colors, and beautiful music (especially the tune I Will Wait For You played during the opening and ending).
220;Fine performances from the cast as well, and all the dialogue is sung.
221;Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a poignant French musical that could probably have been improved by allowing some spoken dialog.
222;a. kind tribute to the quotidian inverts the subject matter of the great MGM musicals that formed his inspiration.
223;The stunning wallpapers that so often form the backdrop to this sung.
224;A very young, very fragile Catherine Deneuve and Nino Castelnuovo are the starcrossed young lovers
225;stopper in the movie is the stunning Oscar.
226;nominated I Will Wait for You.
227;The plot is pretty easy to follow, yet it develops the characters quite well.
228;What will happen to Guy and Genevieve, and Cassard, and Genevieve's mother, and Guy's godmother?
229;Watch and find out!Another way in which Umbrellas is unique is that it does not try to opt for easy answers.
230;Without giving away the specifics, I can say that the ending is happy, but not in the way viewers would expect it to be, and there are lots of unresolved issues.
231;The ending has a mix of happiness and agony, much the way life is most of the time.
232;Catherine Deneuve shines as the lead actress.
233;thank you Amazon for carrying a wide selection of hard to find movies from non.
234;If you like Michel Legrand's music, you're gonna love this.
235;up beats and painted with lush strings .
236;Some familiar music you can hear in the film.
237;But apart from that, I love the story, the music and the art direction.
238;You get to sympathize with Nino Castelnuovo's role who sung and acted very well here.
239;The pacing of the film in coordination with the music (and lyrics) is simply astounding.
240;Quite possibly the greatest movie ever made, certainly the greatest  musical  movie ever made.
241;I am impressed and moved each time I see it.
242;Director Jacques Demy's visually sumptuous masterpiece is unique in that it's all.
243;Thanks to a magical score by Michel Legrand, this bold conceit works.
244;Deneuve is a vision as Genevieve, a role that made her an international star.
245;Lead billing also goes to Demy's vibrant color palette, a tribute to the `50s Hollywood musicals he so loved.
246;The perfect first date movie.
247;a feast for eyes, ears, and hearts.
248;This is a most unusually beautiful movie and quite unique in that it is sung throughout.
249;It probably appeals to a small but select audience.
250;The pace is gentle but moves steadily.
251;I recommend it to those looking for something out of the ordinary.
252;A genuinely classic retelling of the boy meets girl, boy loses girl, and boy finds her again tale sung to Michel LeGrand's great jazz score.
253;The brightly colored sets have a definitive 1960's look, yet do not seem dated at all.
254;The performances are all first rate, especially Catherine Deneuve's.
255;This classic French romance film is a lasting work of art not only because music and scenery is breathtaking, but also because the storyline is passionate and well developed.
256;A very good, exceptional value of a rare and hard to find foreign movie with beautiful music starring Catherine Deneuve.
257;The product is as described and the most reasonable cost for this item.
258;Beautiful restoration of a classic French musical.
259;Very politically incorrect now, of course.
260;ups of Vincente Minnelli's ZIEGFELD FOLLIES and CABIN IN THE SKY, Demy's camera snakes through the picturesque streets of Cherbourg, poking into shop windows, racing ahead around corners with a brisk, airy pace, unafraid and remarkably steady and obtrusive.
261;The camera is everywhere, most obviously trying to penetrate the great beauty of its young stars as they throw their lives away
262;finally, we can see the stylish fingerprints of Stanley Donen all throughout the interior designs of TUOC.
263;up), and yet a dynamism animates the interplay, a bow in Terpsichore's direction.
264;Beautiful songs, a great story and great actors.
265;It's touching without being sentimental and highlights an important time in France's history when it was dealing with the Algerian war.
266;This movie is so incredibly beautiful.
267;The storyline is excellent on its own.
268;but the music just puts this one over the top.
269;This is one I would recommend again and again.
270;I don't know that I would call it a musical in the Hollywood sense, but it is a stunning piece of cinema.
271;i first heard Michel Legrand's wonderful music on the 1954 LP I Love Paris, the best recording of Parisian music ever made.
272;Legrand's beautifully orchestrated and melodically rich music for the movie is just as wonderful.
273;i have never seen a more beautiful woman than Catherine Deneuve.
274;She was 19 when this movie was made in 1964, and has a classic beauty which she has retained to this day.
275;The story is charming, sad, serious and entirely believeable, unlike most stories for musicals.
276;The cast and Demy's direction are excellent.
277;this classic film should be on everyone's shelf.
278;The most romantic movie ever???
279;Gorgeous music by composer Michel Legrand, a timeless star (19 year.
280;A love story edged with a trace of sadness.
281;This is my favorite foreign film of all time.
282;The dialog is entirely sung in French, the music is captivating, the set design is breathtaking, and the acting is brilliant.
283;Catherine Deneuve never looked so young, beautiful, and innocent as she appears in this movie.
284;The movie's ending gives the viewer an unexpected but sometimes so true dose of reality.
285;This is my favorite foreign film of all time.
286;This film is a masterfully crafted modern musical opera.
287;A must for French language hobbyists as well.
288;The musical score by Michel Legrand is gorgeous and has been a favorite of mine.
289;He also did the haunting score for Wuthering Heights, 1970 with the incredible Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff.
290;with Leslie Caron and Maurice Chevalier is a heartwarming, enchanting look at the same basic storyline set in an earlier time period.
291;'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' ( Les Parapluies de Cherbourg ) may well be one of the three most important French films ever made.
292;seen gem one of the best examples of superior motion picture.
293;style operetta with everyone grieving all around.
294;On the other hand, what we are treated to is a timely romantic tale, both spiritual and grave in its' treatment.
295;the story is pretty straightforward.
296;Catherine and Nino Castelnuovo are lovers .
297;step any possible political statement, and instead focusses on the lovely curtains in Catherine's bedroom) our heroine finds herself pregnant.
298;the rest of the story is extremely compelling.
299;this one manages to do so with the utmost simplicity, and triumphs when its' time comes.
300;And the music is instantly reminiscent of the beauty of the era.
301;everyone probably knows how this film ends .
302;I love this movie because it never pretends to be something its not, and no.
303;The other, of course, is the chilling, colder.
304;Perhaps more poignant and relevant now in a world gone mad, I seriously recommend you get this film to bring back the ideals of goodness, purity and the rarity that is young love, back into your life.
305;there is also a 're.
306;this film, alongwith 1962's 'Escapade in Florence' remains his best works).
307;There are people in France, especially the '60s lot, who know the entire film word.
308;A brilliant exercise, and I recommend that you let your children do the same.
309;If you're shopping on Amazon, I would highly recommend that you also pick up the rare 2.
310;And any film that can do that, is a top notch effort in my book.
311;epic, touching, and never boring, 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' is one of the true classics of the twentieth century.
312;I highly recommend this to anyone who has a heart.
313;everything looks so perfect and appetizing that you have a hard time deciding on where to start or on what to concentrate.
314;Between the acting, the cinematography, the sets, the costumes, the singing, the music, the plot, it is a bit difficult to take everything in at the same time.
315;It's easy to suspect that Francois Ozon was inspired by this movie to do his8 Women, which is a similar sensual overload and also (surprise, surprise) stars Deneuve.
316;A classic you can watch over and over and over again.
317;one of the greatest romantic.
318;drama musical movies ever!You will definitely enjoy it!
319;And although the lyrics are a bit sappy at times, the music, by Michel Legrand, is some of the lovliest to grace a soundtrack.
320;English subtitles and the completely sung dialogue make it accessible and fun for beginning students of French.
321;masterpiece with this homage to the classic Hollywood musicals from a decade before.
322;The opening shot is just a hint of the wonderfully creative treat that lies ahead for the viewer.
323;catherine Deneuve and Nino Castlenuovo are the impossibly young and beautiful stars of this film.
324;Were there ever two more beautiful actors in Europe at that time?
325;They bring to life a true portrait of the tender and doomed love they share to the screen with a skill and grace that is unmatched.
326;This visual perfection of youth and love is matched only by the glorious music of Michel Legrand.
327;The score proves irresistible and sweeps the tender but thin story to the heights of grand opera.
328;The use by Demy of color in the film is so precise and purposeful and helps add to the emotional pull of the entire effort.
329;I promise you that the bright jazzy score will capture you.
330;and indeed the last scene is brilliantly handled and one of the great moments of romantic cinema.
331;The lives of ordinary people given operatic treatment with a jazzy score, colorful sets, and lovely cinematography.
332;Through composiotion, in which every line of dialogue is sung, is common enough in opera, but rare in musicals
333;Mechanics in a garage are washing up, and singing to each other as they do.
334;legrand's music is of course wonderfully lyrical, and the combination of the music, the pastel colors that dominate the sets and the soft lighting result in a look not unlike the great MGM musicals.
335;The story is a perfect tragic romance
336;The entire cast are warm and sympathetic, and Catherine Deneuve in her first major role is breathtakingly beautiful.
337;if you love musicals, and you like the classic post.
338;war French cinema, you'll find in this film the perfect synthesis of the two genres.
339;Delightful opera with unique, colorful staging set in the City of Romance.
340;A real feast for the ears and eyes!
341;The most romantic movie since David Lean's Summertime.
342;it is in the third that the effect of the story comes.
343;the first part is very dramatic, almost to the point of being melodramatic.
344;The feeling of isolation is so well done by removing a character one gets use to seeing.
345;Did me NO good at all.
346;It's definitely on the top of my favorite movies.
347;Catherine Deneuve looks great and the music is hauntingly memorable.
348;A masterpiece that deserves to be seen by everyone!This is the ultimate musical.
349;The vivid colors are spectacular.
350;romantic person I've ever met .
351;looking Esso station in the snow five years later, it's pure sentimental, stylized magic.
352;they are any young lovers and what the film is about, it seems to me, is that bittersweet feeling we all have towards our first loves.
353;At the end of the film, both are married and it is fairly clear that they have made the right choices .
354;one thing I find fascinating is that the two leads are both rather weak and passive, and in both cases they end up with stronger, more aggressive and more competent partners.
355;Here's a great quote from Jonathan Rosenbaum's long review regarding composer Michel Legrand's contribution to the film:Though Legrand isn't credited as the film's cowriter, his collaboration with Demy, who wrote the lyrics, suggests that he may well deserve to be, for this is a film in which the score and the narrative are inseparable, shaped to the same architecture.
356;The film LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG is one of the finest movies ever made.
357;It has tragedy, humor, beauty, grace, and a superbly haunting score that will stay in your mind long after the film is over.
358;This is my favorite movie of all time, and it has been beautifully remastered in this latest edition.
359;the marriage of music, color, visuals, faces, emotions, and finally war enabled Demy to present his most romantic picture to date with THE UMBRELLAS.
360;she shows pictures of characters from the earlier films, and if you've seen them all, this film should come full circle.
361;Demy wanted the music to be very fresh and American, and so hired SPIRIT to work with him, when he couldn't convince Jimmy Morrison and the Doors to do it.
362;the music, of course, is the most recognizable of Michel Legrand's work, two of it's songs having received worldwide recognition.
363;curl up with your favorite cuddler, turn off your need to be totally realistic and drift away with young love, a palate worthy of the French Impressionists, and music to warm your heart.
364;The characters were appealing, the story was relatable, the period style is nostalgic, I cared about these people.
365;In this opera, what the orchestra plays is far more interesting than what the singers sing.
366;having to work around the wild colors and patterns of the wallpaper in the umbrella shop and apartment.
367;the singer's part or the orchestral background?Still, it was an entertaining and enjoyable film.
368;This timelss love story, set as a jazz opera by the inimitable Michel Legrand, is a feast for the ears, the eyes, and the heart.
369;Everything about it is musially and intellectually engaging, and the sets/costumes are especially striking.
370;The music and choreography are brilliant and the story is thought.
371;The acting was very good, the cinematography was good, and the movie is thoroughly enjoyable.
372;The sound is okay, barring the skips, and it's one of my favorite foreign films.
373;This is the best chick flick of it's genre that I have ever seen.
374;the music is perfect and it's a beautiful story.
375;I hadn't seen this movie in years, but it was just as entertaining and beautiful to watch as I remembered.
376;owned copy, but it was in excellent condition and more than met my expectations from the description provided by this seller.
377;This is a magical heart.
378;The script is set completely to famous French tunes and sung by all as a real.
379;It is the story of a daughter's down to earth journey from teen to woman living and working with her mother in a small accessory shop.
380;The mother (Madame Emery) of Genevieve (Catherine Deneuve) though her heart is in the right place in terms of genuine concern for her daughter's material well.
381;age story with a bitter twist, sweetened only with the incredibly lovely pastel composition of the camera shots and Michel Legrand's breathtakingly beautiful score whose moving lyrics replace any would.
382;if the criteria that defines art lies in showing something new in a new way, then Jacques Demy's film is successful as a work of art.
383;The exquisite splashing of color through costume and set design, operatic delivery of lines, not to mention the fine acting, perfect editing and captivating theme and story, all make this film an endearing and enduring work of cinematic art.
384;Well, the sets and the costumes were outstandingly colorful and I enjoyed that.
385;I also enjoyed the story despite its' simplicity because the ending impressed me on an emotional level.
386;Finally, I'm always willing to give an extra star for a director that's willing to try something new
387;i could tell by the other reviews that plenty of people loved this movie.
388;After all, the movie ends in a rather beautiful way.
389;I first saw this movie in high school French class back in the 70s.
390;got it on a lark recently to watch again and found it very touching, and beautifully filmed, if a tad melodramatic.
391;Actually, I think I preferred Rochefort, but both are worth watching.
392;forward way, a fact that is masked by having all the dialogue sung.
393;Still, the movie is better because of this, more moving and realistic.
394;And each scene is lovingly and gorgeously put together, so its a feast for the eyes.
395;I found the women's voices harsh at times, hitting high piercing notes that grated.
396;Still, the score is pleasant and.
397;the famous song a joy to hear.
398;Umbrellas of Cherbourg is quite a few levels beyond a musical due to the operatic elements and fairytale sets.
399;The summery pallet of pastel pinks and blues contributes to the childlike wonder and innocence in this romantic classic.
400;the wallpaper is magnificent and the sets are decorator dreams.
401;He has also beautifully woven kindness and eventuality into the complex human experience.
402;Not only does it succeed, it excels in this task.
403;The music is dreamy and comforting all while taking you through a very human experience.
404;umbrellas of Cherbourg is filled with sweet dreams, snow, rain, fantasy candy.
405;camera techniques are blissfully creative and characters wander from room to room in a natural flow of experience.
406;Singing continues throughout, creating one of the most memorable musical experiences in cinema.
407;It captivated me by it's unusual concept, which, led me toward a love of musical drama and opera.
408;One thing that bears repeating is that Catherie Daneuve was the most beautiful woman in the world, then as now.
409;The acting remained intact, without the efforts of the vocal ability involved.
410;This restoration pretty much retrieves the original intention of production designer, Bernard Evein.
411;The colors are so grotesquely vivid as to compliment the idea of the sung dialogue.
412;It is indeed a modern fairy tale.young love ain't always what it seems.
413;Jacques Demy took a chance, and gave us a unique film experience of classic proportions.
414;I was still riveted after all these years.
415;sweet moments of your past.
416;So beautifully presented, so naturally acted
417;Ellen Farner, as Madeleine, gives the best performance (she looks a lot like Katharine Ross), her every nuance is heartfelt.
418;This film is so perfectly set.
419;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a classic of world cinema which shows the bold style of film maker Jacques Demy.
420;Demy has all the dialogue sung to the pounding emotional score of Michel Legrand.
421;Catherine Deneuve is etherial in one of her first leading roles and the role which really brought her to international attention.
422;the restoration of the film ranks up their with the work done to restore Vertigo or Lawrence of Arabia.
423;Otherwise, it is a job well done.
424;Here, every line of dialogue is sung, and it gives the movie a much smoother feel.
425;the story follows young lovers Genevieve (the great Catherine Deneuve) and Guy (Nino Castelnuovo, who got his greatest American exposure in this film), determined that their love will last forever despite the meddling of Genevieve's mother and Guy's impending service in the French war against Algeria.
426;that alone would make this movie well worth your time, but there's also the spectacle of a nineteen.year.
427;The supporting cast all do their jobs quite wonderfully as well, and the technical aspects of the film are also quite nice
428;This is a movie that's got it all.
429;For instance, every line of dialogue in the movie is sung, yet apart from the heartbreakingly beautiful I Will Wait for You, there are no songs.
430;So, is it a musical?
431;as fine as the music is, I actually found the film to be more riveting on a purely visual level.
432;For instance, inn scene after scene, I found myself focusing on the art design rather than the music.
433;Demy also employs a host of subtle camera angles and techniques.
434;The film is unquestionably as much for the eyes as for the ears.
435;Marc Michel, for instance, who plays Deneuve's wealthy suitor Roland Cassard, is a thoroughly likable person, even admirable.
436;Genevi ve's mother might push her towards Roland and away from Guy, but she is clearly motivated by a love of her daughter.
437;In a way, it deconstructs the kind of romantic myths that dominates the musical genre.
438;disney version of the possibility of eternal love.
439;A visual and auditory masterpiece.
440;At least as important the film is INTELLIGENT.
441;This is a genuinely beautiful film but, for all its beauty, it is at the same time realistic and perhaps even cynical.
442;It is, in fact, a deconstruction of the classic romantic fable.
443;Genevieve, confronted with an unexpected pregnancy and a Guy who seldom writes, soon turns to the thoroughly likeable and generous and well.
444;do Roland Cassard, who loves Genevieve and wants to marry her despite the fact that she is pregnant.
445;Encouraged by her mother Genevieve turns to him and, together, they plan for the arrival of 'their child'.
446;See it yourself and you won't be disappointed.
447;for all the beautiful characters, perhaps the most wonderful and genuinely decent person is Madeleine who is in the background for most of the film.
448;Despite Catherine Deneuve's [Genevieve's] vulnerability and delicate beauty, Madeleine.
449;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is quite simply one of the most gorgeous movies ever made .
450;glo 60s fashion and color, and the French settings awash with sumptuous, tactile beauty .
451;the cast is stunningly beautiful, every one of them .
452;and the score, by Michel Legrand, gives the movie a swirlingly romantic narrative that is thru.
453;It is intoxicating, to say the least.
454;And the simple, melancholy story grabs and clutches at your throat, since it has the sting of truth.
455;This is one of those films that makes you so glad that movies were invented.
456;I am a big fan of the initial Jacques Demy film Lola from 1961 due to the great female lead star Anouk Aimee' (due to her tremendous work in Fellini's .
457;It holds it own and was a welcome addition to my fledging Demy library.
458;Bay of Angels about an ill starred couple whom tear up and down the French Riviera battling gambling addictions.
459;This is another great addition looking great in black and white, a camera that never slows, plus a story plausible and intriguing enough to keep you pinned.
460;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is absolutely perfect as a color pallet unrivaled ever in cinematic history.
461;Mind you it is a musical from start to finish but deftly done in Demy's hands we witness the full blossom of Catherine Deneuve and terrific musical score by Michel Legrand for the 1964 Palme D'Or winner from Cannes.
462;The English subtitles are great.
463;this is unlike any movie you will ever see.
464;The colors, and that hopeful face and haunted eyes.
465;Genevi ve is in love with Guy (Nino Castelnuovo), a young auto mechanic with dark hair and a dazzling smile.
466;After a tearful goodbye, Guy reluctantly leaves with the promise of Genevi ve's hand when he returns.
467;Her stomach begins to expand, revealing Guy's child growing inside.
468;Visually, this is a stunning film.
469;All of the sets are bright and cheerful and are well coordinated to the seasons and moods.
470;Do not expect that everything will be wrapped up neatly in the end with an extravagant musical number to finish it all off.
471;It is haunting and memorable, a lovely film.
472;I don't usually like this type of movie, it is sung all the way through, but the music is so haunting, that you will remember it long after the memories of the actual story is gone.
473;pastel palette but not breathtaking without those delicate pastels.
474;This is a must see!
475;Storyline, and musical scores are tops!
476;Enjoyed it from start to finish.
477;Has the right mixture of joy, nostalgy, and pain.
478;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, (Les parapluies de Cherbourg) (1964), a tenderly told musical romantic drama, was, in its time, a great big immensely popular hit for Jacques Demy, (Les Demoiselles De Rochefort), who both wrote and directed it.
479;The French director created a singular cinema classic, a burst of color and emotion in which every word of dialog is sung, to an everlastingly beloved score by French composer Michel Legrand.
480;Before he leaves, he and Genevi ve consummate their love
481;The ancient northern city has always been an important port, fought over by generations of French, Germans, and English, and somehow, Demy shows us how beat.
482;Even the interiors are exuberantly colored
483;The young Deneuve, an astonishing beauty, is never less than charmingly dressed, and pregnant as she is supposed to be, may still be the most gorgeous movie bride ever.
484;Mind you, even the umbrella shop, and Guy's garage are charmingly portrayed, and the quite pretty Mme. Emory, as portrayed by Anne Vernon, could have had no complaints about her wardrobe.
485;breaking scene, perhaps an homage to the carnival scene in the great French movie,Children of Paradise (The Criterion Collection), Genevieve decides that she must after all marry Roland.
486;Guy has his own garage, bought with an inheritance from his godmother, and is evidently happily married, father of a boy Francois
487;Guy's wife, after doing the dinner dishes by hand, has walked downtown with their son.
488;the camera leaves Genevieve, Deneuve, cold and beautiful, aloof and mysterious, as she always was and has been.
489;Critics have always said that her lively real.
490;She's simply too beautiful, and must exist in the public sphere, as Deneuve has.
491;She's had children by two lovers, famous French film director Roger Vadim, and famous Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni
492;And I like to think of myself as a sophisticate, but I love it.
493;My french teacher showed my class this movie just a few weeks ago.
494;Most of the kids in my class thought it was extremely corny, but I liked it!
495;Anyway this is such a good movie, I'd recommend it to anyone who likes dramatic romantic movies!
496;the music, the heartwrenching love story, and the colorful scenery all add up to one conclusion.
497;it's a take on romeo and juliet.
498;the musical score from michel legrand contains incredible emotional impact, as well as some very memorable tunes.
499;Umbrellas of Cherbourg is the simple and timeless story of two young lovers, Guy and Genevieve (played by Nino Castelnuovo and Catherine Deneuve) who plan to marry until those plans are disrupted when Guy is drafted into military service.
500;By chance, she encounters a handsome, young businessman there, Roland, played by Marc Michel.
501;Umbrellas of Cherbourg is an inventive, unqualified classic.
502;The entire dialogue in this movie is sung by a gorgeous, talented cast.
503;The wondrous Jacque Demy's direction is graceful and elegant.
504;And Demy's screenplay and lyrics are sensitive and perceptive.
505;as for the rest of this movie, Michel Legrand's music is ravishing and intoxicating.
506;And the photography, sets, and costumes are stylish and accomplished.
507;this is also the movie that made Catherine Deneuve an international star and deservedly so.
508;Her restrained, yet heartbreaking performance is unforgettable.
509;Deneuve's delicate and entrancing beauty define perfection.
510;Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a richly rewarding cinematic confection.
511;Lots of good words were said about the movie itself and I just join my thumbs up with thousands raised before.
512;This is such a good movie.
513;as I wish more people would see it and enjoy French singing.
514;Still looking for lover in the rain.
515;Wonderful movie, it will stay with you forver!
516;My idea of a great love story is Leaving Las Vegas.
517;time great performances and is totally believeable in the first act as a love.
518;sentimentality and one of the great achievements in the history of cinema.
519;I'm a big fan of musicals, but when I first started watching this film for the first time and heard the mechanics sing.
520;But then I kept watching, and before I knew it I was crying, completely swept up in what I now consider one of the most beautiful films ever made.
521;It's one of those films where everything just works together perfectly to create an absolute work of art .
522;the story and the performers and the music and the cinematography are utterly beautiful.
523;which is quite possibly the most beautiful in all of cinema.
524;this happens to be a nice presentation of a beautiful restoration of a terrific and innovative film.
525;Beautiful to look at and to listen to.
526;the extras are quirky, like the tiny bios, for instance.
527;A semi followup to Jacques Demy's Lola .
528;both Michel Legrand's main theme and Marc Marcel's character return .
529;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is surprisingly upbeat despite its subject matter.
530;I don't even like musicals!
531;But this story is so romantic and I love the music and actors!
532;The sets are pure psychedelia.
533;Yet, the melodies and melodrama are absolutely hypnotic.
534;The acting is uniformly excellent and comes through the music with every nuance intact.
535;Most striking is the over.
536;top visual beauty (check out the sumptuous wallpaper in every room!)
