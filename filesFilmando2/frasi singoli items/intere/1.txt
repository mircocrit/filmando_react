I:8493;1;But, in all honesty, I thought this was an amazing film long before I knew what people would be saying about it (I saw it the day it opened and knew nothing about it.
I:8493;2;I'm sure most people have seen it and most people know what its about.
I:8493;3;I never really thought about them as far as artistic matters are concerned.
I:8493;4;Now after all the years since its release I've learned a lot about movies and can appreciate them on another level.
I:8493;5;So, thanks to Pulp Fiction I have a great appreciation for movies.
I:8493;6;as entertainment and now as art as well.
I:8493;7;watch movies that I had seen before, I can watch them with a new appreciation and understanding.
I:8493;8;so that is why Pulp Fiction is my favorite movie and one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:8493;9;it was unpredictable and exciting throughout.
I:8493;10;but I liked the miracle and Bruce Willis scenes too.
I:8493;11;Fortunately, the use of guns as overly powerful extensions of will is well.
I:8493;12;"If somebody pointed a gun at me and said,""You gotta have an opinion ."
I:8493;13;i think it is the funniest movie I've seen that actually doesn't go in the comedy section at the video store.
I:8493;14;When he dies they will refer to him first and foremost as the director of PULP FICTION.
I:8493;15;His place in history as one of the great directors of cinema is secured with this film.
I:8493;16;Samuel L Jackson remains the stand out and some of the dialogue is still very, very funny.
I:8493;17;This time I was not so impressed by Ms Thurman and Mr Travolta's twist scene but still shuddered at the adrenaline shot to the heart.
I:8493;18;Tim Roth still had the ability to take the dialogue out into the weird and Bruce Willis was, well Bruce Willis.
I:8493;19;I would watch Mr Jackson again as he remains for me, a superb actor, but not the movie in full.
I:8493;20;Pulp Fiction is a vital, energetic, unique (I know Tarantino borrows a lot of his ideas, but so does everyone, and I'll argue with anyone who says his usage of them is not original), and unflinching film.
I:8493;21;work in this movie a LOT more entertaining than in any of the post.
I:8493;22;I like this one, but I feel he's got another one that could even go further.
I:8493;23;I liked all of the actors.
I:8493;24;And I liked the music.
I:8493;25;i hope he does a sequel!
I:8493;26;You've finally made a film that makes killing people really sexy.
I:8493;27;Hollywood, how do you do it???
I:8493;28;Must watch if you are a fan of any of the cast.
I:8493;29;I enjoy it every time I watch.
I:8493;30;This is the classic Tarantino film and it is really great.
I:8493;31;If you are a fan of any Quentin tarantino films like kill bill or the inglorious bastards you will like this movie!
I:8493;32;This movie is a must see and in my opinion it should be in every Tarantion's fans collection.
I:8493;33;The Blu Ray is great!!
I:8493;34;All was good with the movie!
I:8493;35;Pulp Fiction is still regarded as one of the greatest movies ever made, and why should it change from that rank?
I:8493;36;The movie can be really funny in certain areas while giving you the classic drama feel, along with a recreation of how people seem to live.
I:8493;37;for starters, people will love the transfer.
I:8493;38;"His scene and part were eventually cut from the film, but you can see this on the ""deleted scenes"" features."
I:8493;39;One of the best films of the decade, this thing started a wave of ' gritty/cool, pop culture/guns.
I:8493;40;Completely, totally entertaining, this movie has quite literally helped to define Generation X. Anyone in 2002 between the ages of approximately 25.43, probably has a soft spot for this movie.
I:8493;41;like alot of people, I saw this thing about 5 times in the theatre and it was always a great experience.
I:8493;42;and that's something I've rarely felt since, if ever.
I:8493;43;It's one of those movies I'd love to see again for the first time.
I:8493;44;"If you want a action, adventure, and comedy
I:8493;45;This is one of the most funny movies.
I:8493;46;I'm not going to spoil it for anybody that hasn't watched it but, you'll want to own it and watch it again and again and again.
I:8493;47;Pulp Fiction has often been hailed as one of the greatest films made.
I:8493;48;certainly one of the best in modern times (along with Fargo, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the Star Wars trilogy).
I:8493;49;And it is easy to see why.
I:8493;50;Beside being a great film, it catapulted Tarantino into the public's eye, revived the dead career of John Travolta, introduced us to Tim Roth, reminded us of Harvey Keitel and Ving Rhames, gave us so many catch phrases, and ingrained itself into American pop culture.
I:8493;51;This is arguably Tarantino's best film (only Reservoir Dogs can compete with it) and after watching it, there is little room for doubt about the greatness of the film.
I:8493;52;As a film, volumes can be written on it, and I can't say enough of it here.
I:8493;53;But has it been worth the wait?
I:8493;54;Disc 1 contains the movie and an enhanced trivia track.
I:8493;55;Anyone who has seen Pulp Fiction (or any Tarantino movie for that matter), knows how important music is to the film.
I:8493;56;This option allows you to jump to the various music selections in the film.
I:8493;57;This is the best movie ever!!
I:8493;58;Every single minute of this film is beautiful.
I:8493;59;This movie is beautifully well shot.
I:8493;60;This is Quentin Tarantino at his best!!
I:8493;61;Anyone who's watched the Blu issues of '2001' or the Blu James Bond Collection or The Godfather probably knows what I'm talking about.
I:8493;62;Its like someone washed the camera's lens and everything that was to be sharp is even more so and all shades are nuances are now perfectly rendered.
I:8493;63;Add to that the spectacular Loseless DTS.
I:8493;64;as for the extra content, this one.
I:8493;65;rOM features and adds 2 new featurettes containing more recent interviews with the cast and some critics discussion on the movie's role in the history of cinematography.
I:8493;66;It is also an excellent movie!
I:8493;67;Pulp Fiction is still raw, captivating, and completely mindblowing to this day.
I:8493;68;This is the only Quentin Taritino film that I truly adore, the whole cast are at their best here especially John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis.
I:8493;69;If you love a long and complicated film then Pulp Fiction is for you.
I:8493;70;This is pure genius and Tarantino pulled out all the stops in his second movie.
I:8493;71;He beautifully crafted a modern day masterpiece, interweaving multiple story lines and characters.
I:8493;72;Tarantino is the king of interesting dialogue.
I:8493;73;faced, get the job done, and get the heck out with perfect precision.
I:8493;74;To show the genius of Tarantino, he takes this situation which is in any other circumstance would be dead serious, and he makes it funny.
I:8493;75;this movie is perfect in everyway.
I:8493;76;It would be the best decision you have ever made.
I:8493;77;Besides the acting of Travolta and Jackson, the charm of Uma, the story gets you completely, so you will never forget this movie, both dramatic and funny, very well written and directed.
I:8493;78;definition looks amazing on this Pulp Fiction Blu.
I:8493;79;This is an absolute classic cult movie.
I:8493;80;It certainly worth watch at least once, or in my case at least a few times a year.
I:8493;81;Funny, crude, a bit violent, great cast, and just down right fun.
I:8493;82;Interesting movie, plenty of action and comedy combine.
I:8493;83;Perfect actors for each roll, and very detailed story line.
I:8493;84;This movie is obviously great.
I:8493;85;It has an all star cast.
I:8493;86;John travolta, and Uma Thurman are great.
I:8493;87;My favorite parts are with Samuel L. Jackson.
I:8493;88;If you like Quentin Tarantino, see this movie.
I:8493;89;I really liked this movie!
I:8493;90;I can see it over and over again and I always laught.
I:8493;91;well I'm not a good movie reviewer, but this one is by far the best Tarantino's movie.
I:8493;92;A picture is a masterpeace because you can see it over and over again and there is always something that appear to be new, fresh, you don't get tired in front of it as you always can be looking at details that makes it unique.
I:8493;93;The same happens in music with Mozart or Bach etc.You see this movie over and over again and there is always something new that you show or notice about it.
I:8493;94;I think this movie can pass generation over generation and always will cause an effect to it's public.
I:8493;95;A must see if you haven't yet.
I:8493;96;So many people claim Chinatown has the greatest screenplay (some even say that honor goes to Good Will Hunting) but the true great is, was, and always will be Pulp Fiction.
I:8493;97;Greatest movie of all time.
I:8493;98;I like it, but it's not the best movie I have seen.
I:8493;99;It's definitely for adult viewers.
I:8493;100;After 10 years, 'Pulp Fiction' still holds up as an absolute classic, and thankfully Beuna Vista/Miramax have released this gem on PSP for all us to enjoy.
I:8493;101;picture:Like Kill Bill Vol 1+2, the picture is nice and sharp, and in it's Original Aspect ratio of 2:35.
I:8493;102;score: 1/5Overall:One of my fav films, and one i was looking forward to all month, is below scratch.
I:8493;103;It is still as great as people told me it was.
I:8493;104;Christopher Walken has a hilarious cameo as a former POW who delivers a special watch to Butch, and Quentin Tarantino portrays the only non.
I:8493;105;tough guy in the film, Jimmy, with amazing authenticity.
I:8493;106;jackson is thunderingly powerful when he quotes Ezekiel 25.17, and Travolta generates laughter with his bumbling mistakes and volatile attitude.
I:8493;107;Thurman is oddly sterile in her conversations for reasons I can't figure out, and Rhames always talks annoyingly slowly, but the rest of the actors, expecially Keitel, shine brightly.
I:8493;108;The redeeming of Jackson's character at the end of Pulp Fiction is almost heart warming.
I:8493;109;the realism in Pulp Fiction is just wonderful.
I:8493;110;This is a very adult movie, only for the mature.
I:8493;111;It portrays the underworld with surprising gritty realism.
I:8493;112;But this is more than those things.
I:8493;113;Underneath a violent veneer is a very moral movie.
I:8493;114;It is a story about a dedication to the human conscience.
I:8493;115;But if morality is one thing you could care less to see in the movies, then you will surely enjoy the dialogue and interactions between the film's unique characters.
I:8493;116;"dropping dialogue
I:8493;117;It's an amazing movie, truly worthy of all of its recognition.
I:8493;118;With its many subplots, an impeccable cast performing best of career characters, profanity used in the manner of an opera, topical orchestration of life's mysteries (to f. t massage or not), and so on.
I:8493;119;Writer/director Quentin Tarantino demonstrated his gift of creating cinematic orgies of the mind and body.
I:8493;120;It is graphic, but has excellent acting, script, cinematography, everything!!
I:8493;121;Film making at its best!
I:8493;122;This is a twist and turn of excitement.
I:8493;123;I can tell you, for me, this movie is a classic.
I:8493;124;This is one of those movies that I just can't pass up.
I:8493;125;If I get the chance, I watch it.
I:8493;126;I've watched it again and again and it's always entertaining.
I:8493;127;I love Quentin Tarantino Movies, he always adds an odd twist that makes the movie enjoyable and funny even though the topic of the movie is violent sarcastic action.
I:8493;128;It's just a style thing.
I:8493;129;The way the story travels forward and backward and all fits at the end is marvelous.
I:8493;130;Quentin shows up in his film with a cup of coffee.
I:8493;131;The photography is outstanding, and on display.
I:8493;132;It's a great movie, One I can watch over and over.
I:8493;133;The price was right and it's even better on Blu.
I:8493;134;Tons of quotable lines, mystery, intrigue, action, and a good resolution (for most of the characters).
I:8493;135;samuel L. was awesome, John Travolta was pretty good, Ving Rhames was great.
I:8493;136;I saw it almost 10 years late, and I still enjoyed this awesomely.
I:8493;137;This is the best movie ever!
I:8493;138;This movie is a classic.
I:8493;139;Great acting, awesome story plot and it keeps you guessing all the way to the end.
I:8493;140;I bought it for my son and daughter.
I:8493;141;Superior movie with nice additional scenes and commentary.
I:8493;142;This is the one that forwever changed directors and writers requirement to show everything in it's time and place, and is better for it.
I:8493;143;Samual L Jackson is superb and Bruce Willis carries the day.
I:8493;144;All of my friends said that this was a great movie.
I:8493;145;I asked my brother to watch it with his friends who liked the movie.
I:8493;146;If you enjoy Quentin Tarantino or want to get an introduction to the type of film he produces/directs, this is it.
I:8493;147;Pulp Fiction was his first Oscar win, and he hasn't stopped wowing audiences!
I:8493;148;Just read the cast list and you'll know that this is required viewing.
I:8493;149;A really good classic movie that everyone should at least see once in their life time.
I:8493;150;I forgot how great this movie was.
I:8493;151;Everything about this movie was spot on.
I:8493;152;The sets, the costumes, the actors, the production, etc.
I:8493;153;star cast was joined by a phenomenal song selection from a variety of artists from the 1970s and 1980s.
I:8493;154;star review and the 1071st overall to rate it.
I:8493;155;I will, however, discuss something that I really liked about the movie.
I:8493;156;I also loved the fact that there were no cops to be found anywhere in this movie!
I:8493;157;That was innovative and something very rare in Hollywood at the time.
I:8493;158;Tarantino is a master of weaving the past with the present and refining things to such a degree that they are an art form.
I:8493;159;The man knows his stuff.
I:8493;160;`Inglourious Basterds' was, in my opinion, Tarantino's crowning achievement and is a film that will be hard to beat.
I:8493;161;This film will forever be remembered as the birth of a true auteur filmmaker, and man who takes nothing for granted and who gives of himself stylistically as well as substantially with each and every film.
I:8493;162;watching `Pulp Fiction', it's easy to see why.
I:8493;163;That being said, these characters have become staples, truly memorable pieces of pop culture.
I:8493;164;tarantino's spitfire dialog is insanely inspired and really develops from scene to scene, and the way that the actors handle those words speaks volumes for their talent.
I:8493;165;Thurman has never been better, Jackson is top notch entertaining and Bruce Willis is astonishingly complex as the boxer who turns his back on a deal and winds up on the run for his life.
I:8493;166;Compelling characters, a wonderful story line, and very memorable lines make this movie a good choice to be on anyone's Top 10 list.
I:8493;167;PULP FICTION is one of those movies that can't help just oozing with coolness.
I:8493;168;for all of its influence, it's still one of the most entertaining films to come out of the 90's.
I:8493;169;"These talking scenes are the real meat and potatoes of the film
I:8493;170;The characters are almost uniformly excellent, with only one or two exceptions.
I:8493;171;Harvey Keitel nearly steals the entire movie in his smallish role as the wonderfully unrealistic Mr. Wolf.
I:8493;172;Still it's worth it to have this film on the clearer, longer.
I:8493;173;John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson play hit men working for Wallace who screw up a job.
I:8493;174;This is a really good movie, but its replay value is severely limited.
I:8493;175;This is definitely a movie that can only be fully enjoyed once by most people (people who are die.
I:8493;176;hard Tarantino fans will probably be the ones doing multiple viewings).
I:8493;177;Seriously, a good movie to watch and talk about and know about.
I:8493;178;Yea, I know they're crooked, but faith and some honesty can really screw wicked men's plans up.
I:8493;179;Clearly one of the greatest films ever produced.
I:8493;180;It is always fun to watch, the convenience of streaming makes it even better.
I:8493;181;Classic movie must see !
I:8493;182;You will enjoy it it's very good lots of action lol enjoy enjoy enjoy enjoy
I:8493;183;it has a bit of an odd humor to it, but I recommend it for everyone above the age of 16.
I:8493;184;i love the cast and all the characters in this film.
I:8493;185;i also love that the story is told out of sequence .
I:8493;186;everyone should see this film at least once.
I:8493;187;Great writing, acting and an over.
I:8493;188;After seeing Django Unchained I really wanted to see Pulp Fiction again.
I:8493;189;This is a terrific movie of Tarantino's.
I:8493;190;Violent, of course, but a great film.
I:8493;191;Definitely a must see for film lovers.
I:8493;192;I always liked John Travolta and he is good.
I:8493;193;Most I liked the music from Pulp Fiction, especially when John T. and Uma Thurman dance .
I:8493;194;jackson's revelation in the diner about becoming a righteous wanderer and Travolta's rejection of the miracle message, an act that seals his doom.
I:8493;195;trivia:At the 1950s retro burger joint, Buddy Holly is played by Steve Buscemi.
I:8493;196;The way in which the story goes is great, confusinf at first but at the end, very likable.
I:8493;197;Great plot, dialogue, cast, and direction.
I:8493;198;star cast of John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and Bruce Willis that each play to their best.
I:8493;199;Samuel L. Jackson has some of the best lines in this movie, including his Ezekial speech.
I:8493;200;Christopher Walken, for as little as he is in this movie, delivers one of the most hilarious monologues I have ever heard.
I:8493;201;Tarantino's attention to detail is at its best here and the pop culture references are abundant.
I:8493;202;The intermingling of the stories bookended by the restaurant scene really keeps the movie together.
I:8493;203;one of my favorites, a staple movie for any collection.
I:8493;204;A true classic movie for the generations with a great story line
I:8493;205;Loved everything about this movie from beginning to end.
I:8493;206;"Pulp Fiction was indeed a unique movie: rather than have a plot revolving a central character or characters, ""Pulp Fiction"" was four films in one."
I:8493;207;First, it won the Palm d'or (a foreign film award) as best pciture, than it won over critics around the world with its unique storytelling and excellent cast.
I:8493;208;Pulp Fiction, as I said earlier, is essentially four films in one.
I:8493;209;Next thing you know, Coolidge wins the fight, kills Vega, and him and Marcellus are held hostage in a weapons shop (the best scene in the film).
I:8493;210;"If ""Pulp Fiction"" had nothing else going for it, the cast would still shine through with their wondeful performances."
I:8493;211;"however, ""Pulp Fiction"" has a lot going for it."
I:8493;212;Great characters and great acting.
I:8493;213;an all time favorite too.
I:8493;214;This classic by Quentin Tarantino was the first ultra.
I:8493;215;An American Independent movie at its best.
I:8493;216;I think the best things of this movie are Sam J and John T just talking.
I:8493;217;You can definitely see the comedy context in the movie, so I thought that was clever mixing with the darker context.
I:8493;218;I guess I'd recommend since its such a well known movie.
I:8493;219;Interesting plot told in a way that keeps one paying attention.
I:8493;220;Fun scenes and a world which one loves to watch for we would never want to find ourselves actually in it.
I:8493;221;Even if I never watch this again due to whatever reason I feel comfort knowing that I own it and am able to if I want.
I:8493;222;My favourite movie of all time.
I:8493;223;Quentin Tarantino has reminded us what a powerful art medium the celluloid could be by making a bold, chronologically ripped movie which mesmerises you with its characters, dialogue and music.
I:8493;224;The dialogues are sharp and witty and every character is perfectly cast.
I:8493;225;"Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of the most addictive movies I have ever watch."
I:8493;226;The plot, while being a little strange, is intriguing.
I:8493;227;And the sequence of the film, starting in the middle of the story, going back to the beginning, reaching the end (with a flashback thrown in) and then arriving back at the middle for the final scene in the movie was unique and inventive.
I:8493;228;but all that being said, this is a great film.
I:8493;229;I can only imagine the cast, including John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson, Harvey Keitel, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth,& Ving Rhames, to name a few, must have had a blast making it.
I:8493;230;Everyone who's ever heard of Pulp Fiction knows that it's one of the greatest films ever made (I've never heard it discussed in any context stating less).
I:8493;231;I'll explain:Pulp Fiction is an excercise in storytelling via film.
I:8493;232;The casual use of profanity helps this notion as well.
I:8493;233;my favorite of the stories.
I:8493;234;Excellent, will always remain a classic cult film of all times.
I:8493;235;An epic among modern day films is what this movie is .
I:8493;236;Creative in style, funny, dramatic, musical and excellent are the words.
I:8493;237;the script tops among the plusses.
I:8493;238;The background music is terrific!!
I:8493;239;You got to keep watching it over and over, to discover more everytime!!
I:8493;240;John Travolta's comeback picture and the best he has been in anythingsince Saturday Night Fever.
I:8493;241;Samuel L. Jackson burns in this one and he isalso at he true best with a screenplay and Direction from Quentin Tarantinothis is a true classic.
I:8493;242;This one has it all.
I:8493;243;an amazing script and possibly Tarantino's best writing ever.
I:8493;244;Second time I've given this movie as a gift.
I:8493;245;As much as I hate cliches, if I had a dollar for every All Americans are drooling, fast.
I:8493;246;as for the movie, excellent.
I:8493;247;"In many ways, it doesn't matter
I:8493;248;Quentin's films are always a subtle balance of the disturbing and the great.
I:8493;249;This film is almost as disturbing as it is amazing.
I:8493;250;Here as in his other films, music is an important element.
I:8493;251;The music is inspired and compliments the action on the screen, of which there is much.
I:8493;252;up boxer is at his best, without a doubt.
I:8493;253;I would highly recommend it to anyone 21 years old or over.
I:8493;254;I love everything about it.
I:8493;255;Yes, a great film indeedy!
I:8493;256;This is the greatest movie ever thought of.
I:8493;257;It is personally my favorite movie EVER.
I:8493;258;And a lot of action too.
I:8493;259;I definitly think this movie is worth seeing and owning.
I:8493;260;The first time I saw it, and only saw about half of it, but I still love it.
I:8493;261;Another great thing about this movie is the jumpiness of it.
I:8493;262;One minute their talking to next BAM!
I:8493;263;Viewed: 11/03, 1/05, 4/06, 6/11Rate: 94/06: The performances.
I:8493;264;At first, it can be quiet and straightforward.
I:8493;265;Then, suddenly the momentum is pumped up so high that a single incident rolled onto a fury of speed in an energetic form before it calms down.
I:8493;266;The performances, those who gave the best of the best were: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, Rosanna Arquette, Eric Stoltz, Amanda Plummer, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, and Ving Rhames.
I:8493;267;I personally think John Travolta and Uma Thurman are the most outstanding with Samuel L. Jackson and Eric Stoltz a close second behind.
I:8493;268;Three of the best scenes are: the stab onto Uma's heart, the bible quote by Samuel L. Jackson, and the reminiscence of Saturday Night Fever with John Travolta, especially when he does the V sign across his face.
I:8493;269;It's a very exhilarating moment when John Travolta does that.
I:8493;270;Pulp Fiction is the most explosive film of the 1994 and completely changed the standards of how new movies are thought to adhere by.
I:8493;271;It's an everyday man's delight.
I:8493;272;Yes, Quentin Tarantino establishes himself a master of stealing stuff from other films but did anyone do it well as he?
I:8493;273;Sure, it has its famous moments and brand of conversational style which we label it as Tarantinoesque.
I:8493;274;"John is still brilliant in Pulp Fiction
I:8493;275;That's the most I can say for Pulp Fiction excluding for the memorable moments, mostly from the scenes with John and Uma Thurman.
I:8493;276;This is one of those wonderful films which is so unique and original that it sticks in your mind.
I:8493;277;The acting cast choices in this film was brilliant .
I:8493;278;John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Kietel, Uma Thurman, etc. were notably exceptional.
I:8493;279;The multiple plots were fastpaced and fantastic in their detail and interest.
I:8493;280;Great screenplay, great acting, and great directing.
I:8493;281;I don't know if they remastered it or what, but it looks and sounds amazing.
I:8493;282;if you have never seen this movie, start here, you'll be happy you did.
I:8493;283;truthfully, i don't really think i need to write this review, because almost everyone i have ever met has seen this movie and loved it.
I:8493;284;Great movie, great picture and sound.
I:8493;285;I'd recommend this to anyone.
I:8493;286;He revolutionized film making by dispensing with the pretense of time: the movie ends with the second middle part, starts with the first middle part, and everything else in between is, well, not exactly in chronological sequence either, but this gives it great momentum and contributes to building excitement and anticipation of the next scene(s).
I:8493;287;It has held up amazingly well over the years.
I:8493;288;His ability to cast is almost spooky.
I:8493;289;His genius really shows in Inglorious Basterds.
I:8493;290;if you love Quentin, you'll love this movie.
I:8493;291;That's how good it is.
I:8493;292;Good ol classic in my opinion.
I:8493;293;Quentin Tarantino has shown time and time again what's missing in our special effect happy movies of now.
I:8493;294;Tarantino gets it done like the classics of old.
I:8493;295;Interaction of characters by using everyday small talk, believable attitudes, and great sequences of emotions experienced by the characters.
I:8493;296;and last, but certainly not least Four: Choice of actors.
I:8493;297;Tarantino combined Samuel L. Jackson, who at the time was little known, and another actor John Travolta, who I will forever see as Vinny Barbarino , and created some of the best in.
I:8493;298;both actors' careers skyrocketed after the movie's release.
I:8493;299;Bruce Willis shows an outstanding performance as a has.
I:8493;300;in with some great scenes as armed robbers.
I:8493;301;Every scene is some crazy scenario with a handful of on.
I:8493;302;point actors, who pull you in with the greatest of ease.
I:8493;303;Watching this film about two relaxed and matter.
I:8493;304;fact hit men named Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is likely to be a confusing experience, but one that becomes rewarding for those patient enough to learn why Quentin Tarantino's efforts to make it an outrageously violent and hilarious success won for him an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.
I:8493;305;But when you get used to that, you will find the film brilliant.
I:8493;306;combined stories in it, which makes it very good.
I:8493;307;The music forPulp Fiction is really good and the sound track is worth having as well.
I:8493;308;This film is exciting and keeps moving and dosn't have a boring moment.
I:8493;309;One of my fav movie.
I:8493;310;Tarantino has a great way of getting the audience into the movie, scene by scene, character by character and you really can get into his head what he was thinking when he directed the movie.
I:8493;311;Great BR and a must have for all movie lovers!
I:8493;312;and its at a great price.
I:8493;313;Pulp Fiction is a brilliant movie written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.
I:8493;314;It tells 4 stories that eventually entertwine which gives each story a distinguishing mark.
I:8493;315;The dialouge is perfect and noirish which adds to the films roots.
I:8493;316;Samuel L. Jackson is brilliant and he killed their butts.
I:8493;317;Go and get this one.
I:8493;318;Thanks for the fast service and the movie plays great.
I:8493;319;The characters and there dialogues are the best.
I:8493;320;A must watch for any movie fan that loves character driven films.
I:8493;321;savvy fusion of three interwoven stories, each a take.
I:8493;322;The impressive cast plays off each other extremely well, the dialogue snaps, and, of course, the guns fire all the way through this movie.
I:8493;323;He shows what they do with the rest of their days, what they talk about, and puts them in normal situations.
I:8493;324;Bruce Willis's character, Butch, the past.
I:8493;325;prime boxer, is a tough.
I:8493;326;All the characters also have a distinct level of decency and dignity, despite their language.
I:8493;327;Likewise, after Marsellus is rescued by Butch, he lifts the price from his head.
I:8493;328;Within the three overlapping, interlocking stories of this movie, a playful energy courses throughout.
I:8493;329;The actors deliver their lines with a tongue.
I:8493;330;name stars and sharp dialogue making the film, Pulp Fiction is an amazing movie, and is quintessential Quentin.
I:8493;331;As soon as you start watching you will be so into it you will forget all other aspects in your life.
I:8493;332;It's really funny, because a little while ago I would be the last person to be writing a review like this.
I:8493;333;Snappy, witty, intelligent dialogue, near perfect characterisation from everyone, and beautiful lighting and cinematography that sparkles off Samuel L. Jackson's hair.
I:8493;334;I'm no prude, but this was an extremely seedy film.
I:8493;335;Yep, this is real funny stuff folks.
I:8493;336;It's well done and ends up being action packed.
I:8493;337;Violence abounds, which I am not a fan of, but for one classic scene, it's worth the four stars.
I:8493;338;iconic, Cult Film, Superb Acting, An All Star Cast, Dark Humor, Action.
I:8493;339;Consistently witty, and despite the glorification of its seemingly amoral or immoral characters, one is not left withoutthe message of there being consequences for our actions.
I:8493;340;While in many ways dated, primarily by having influenced lesser talents, it holds up as a very special, stylish, and intelligent work.
I:8493;341;But they must understand that the movie focuses more on the individuals and their stories.
I:8493;342;It worked really well in my opinion.
I:8493;343;"power to sell a movie"" trap, but this movie definetly backs up the stars with a unique set of sub."
I:8493;344;I would have to say this is easily Tarantino's best film.
I:8493;345;What can I say, the movie is great.
I:8493;346;Nothing amazing or terrible about it, just a good picture and good sound.
I:8493;347;Great film, great acting, and great directing.
I:8493;348;I just saw this film a little while ago and wow.
I:8493;349;This film is loaded with everything from great performances to great music.
I:8493;350;I liked the fact Tarantino infused real people into the story and showed conscequences for their actions.
I:8493;351;The film includes great dialogue though.
I:8493;352;Just the stupied things the characters talk about is in a way interesting because you don't know who they are.
I:8493;353;I really like jackson and travolta's characters in the way they talk and interact,.
I:8493;354;check out all his films for sure.
I:8493;355;Quentin Tarantino is a master director/screenwriter and this is him at his best.
I:8493;356;Great characters, rich dialogue, and memorable scenes are what we get.
I:8493;357;Using a fantasicly amazing blend of modern urban.
I:8493;358;suburbian style with classic film noir style, the movie has a feel like none other I have ever seen.
I:8493;359;Probably my favorite part of the movie, it ends in the basement of a pawn.
I:8493;360;the best movie of the 1990's, Pulp Fiction is imortalized by its sick, hip, scarey, funny, emotional, and realistic themes.
I:8493;361;This has to be one of the most overrated films in history.
I:8493;362;I finally watched it and was impressed.
I:8493;363;All of these great actors in a movie when they were younger was funny to watch.
I:8493;364;Anyways now there is a collector's edition of this movie and I got it for Christmas.
I:8493;365;I have to say it is a cool view and there are alot of special features for anyone interested in the making of or any other type of information you would like to see about the history and production of the film.
I:8493;366;The film in itself is great since the hype of it was so big when it came into theatres so if anything this movie is already know globally it's just if you are willing to see this classic for yourself and If you haven't seen this movie yet and you are atleast 17 years of age then I suggest you watch this movie.
I:8493;367;It's a classic and a must have for any movie collector out on this grey and brown earth!
I:8493;368;A must see for every movie buff.
I:8493;369;in constant rotation on my television, this is a classic.
I:8493;370;that puts it over the top.
I:8493;371;The acting is supberb and full of stars.
I:8493;372;The score is put together perfectly and the music matches each scene wonderfully.
I:8493;373;Additionally, the arrangement of the film's scenes were ahead of their time and just fun to watch.
I:8493;374;the movie is a classic that I enjoy and love to watch again and again and again.
I:8493;375;Personally, this is the greatest film of all time and fostered my love of film, directing, scripts, acting, and the craft as a young man.
I:8493;376;thank you, I look forward to hearing from you in the future.
I:8493;377;The characters and their roles played by the actors are excellent.
I:8493;378;Fast moving and certainly not a minute without some action whether it is spirited killings or Uma dancing.
I:8493;379;The soundtrack is perfect and the dialogue still amuses me even after watching this for the hundreth time.
I:8493;380;It is after all staring some great actors and actresses right?
I:8493;381;Anyways I have to be honest, I got my entertainment from watching these characters make a fool of themselves.
I:8493;382;The movie was cute and here are some of the lessons I learned on the way1.
I:8493;383;give the movie a whirl and ENJOY
I:8493;384;This movie is possibly one of the 10 best movies of all time's.
I:8493;385;Quentin, has mastered the art of story telling thru a criminal's eye's in a funny and sometimes downright rediculous sort of way.
I:8493;386;Not only is this movie cast great but the acting is some of the finest to date.
I:8493;387;If you like movies with plots and twists, watch it!!
I:8493;388;you either love it or despise it.
I:8493;389;those who love it, know movies.
I:8493;390;well what floats their boats.
I:8493;391;that it has birth a whole new form of filmmaking of its own.
I:8493;392;Video is great, sound is great, features are lacking.
I:8493;393;Go to sum up, great movie, great cast, great video/audio, no features.
I:8493;394;always a good view no matter how many times you've seen it.
I:8493;395;Everyone in the cast deserved an Academy Award.
I:8493;396;The 3 storys weve together brilliantly and the pace suits the movie perfectly.
I:8493;397;If you haven't seen it, for the love of god, please do.
I:8493;398;Husband and teenage/young adult kids found this movie to be good, I, as the writer of this review, cannot say the same things.
I:8493;399;Pulp Fiction has the dialogue, the elliptical plot device, intriguing characters, fabulous music(check out the even.
I:8493;400;The visual and acting aspects are superb!
I:8493;401;There are so many twists and surprises that it is guaranteed to keep the viewer's interest the entire way through.
I:8493;402;Everything from the acting to the dialogue to the cinematics makes Pulp Fiction one of the greatest films, if not the greatest film, of the '90s and in Hollywood history.
I:8493;403;each of the three stories told is a movie on their own, all having some of the best scenes and dialogue ever incorporated into a movie.
I:8493;404;Just pure moviemaking at its best.
I:8493;405;mentioning the acting, Samuel L. Jackson has established himself as the greatest badass of all time.
I:8493;406;Truly a memorable scene in movie history.
I:8493;407;It is loaded with extras and is well worth the money.
I:8493;408;Quentin Tarantino always casts great actors and actresses like Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, John Travolta.
I:8493;409;i love this movie it is an all time great.
I:8493;410;This is a movie that you have to have in your library.
I:8493;411;It is exciting, funny, and original.
I:8493;412;Tarantino follows Resevior Dogs with this innovative film.
I:8493;413;The stories are all interrealted and very entertaining.
I:8493;414;The stories are about two hit men, a boxer and his girlfriend, the hit men's boss and his wife and two very funny robbers.
I:8493;415;what is so clever about this film is that it isn't moved along by the action.
I:8493;416;Tarantino's independent approach to the movie helped it maintain its originality.
I:8493;417;The movie is fueled by dialogue.
I:8493;418;It has it's share of other funny lines ( Zed's dead baby, Zed's dead. )
I:8493;419;I loved this movie, and it is in my top five.
I:8493;420;It is outrageously original and strikingly funny.
I:8493;421;It is the perfect film of the 90's.
I:8493;422;Released in 1994, the film was an adrenaline shot to the heart of the film industry.
I:8493;423;Though the movie payed homage to a variety of film genres and styles (film noir, gangster film, French New Wave), it managed to be unlike anything seen before.
I:8493;424;Whether you love Pulp Fiction or hate it (and I, for one, love it) you can't deny the impact it had on filmmaking moving forward into the 21st Century.
I:8493;425;I will save my praise for Quentin Tarantino's audacious attempts to show us something original, daring and experimental and for giving us a welcome break from the stale products Hollywood studios have been churning out for years.
I:8493;426;I can't guarantee you'll like it, but I can guarantee that you'll have a definite opinion about it, and even that is refreshing these days.
I:8493;427;This movie could be my favorite movie and that's saying a lot for a movie buff like me.
I:8493;428;This is one of the only movies I've seen more than once, in one day.
I:8493;429;This is a timeless flick.you have some of the best actors that are still in the business today that starred in it, along with a no holds barred approach.
I:8493;430;I would recommend this to any adult audience.
I:8493;431;But great all the same, even WITH John Revolting!
I:8493;432;One of THE best films, IMO.
I:8493;433;lots of dialogue, wrapped up very nicely, very integrated story line!
I:8493;434;Lots of quotes came from this movie that I didn't expect.
I:8493;435;Good to see at least once.
I:8493;436;Quentin Tarantino's amazing movie which he wrote and directed as well as played a cameo role in, is one of the best movies ever made.
I:8493;437;The film feels like it was written and directed in a white HEAT, showing how truly great a talent Tarantino really is.
I:8493;438;Peppered with outrageous humor, characters, and situations, PULP FICTION is a masterpiece.
I:8493;439;The movie revolves around several characters whose own personal stories finally interweave with each other.
I:8493;440;Superbly played, he can be despised and loved at the same time.
I:8493;441;Equally incredible is Sameul L. Jackson's performance.
I:8493;442;Uma Thurman is great as the beautiful but drug.
I:8493;443;One of the best performances in the entire movie is that of Bruce Willis, who finally shows that he is truly much more than just an action star.
I:8493;444;Christopher Walken provides a wonderful cameo in which he explains to a younger version of Bruce Willis the way his father died.
I:8493;445;Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth make a dynamic duo as bank robbers, and Maria de Medeiros is very effective as Fabienne, Willis's girlfriend.
I:8493;446;Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette are very good in their small but important roles, as well as Steve Buscemi in his very small and unrecognizable role as the Buddy Holly waiter.
I:8493;447;Tarantino won an Oscar for his screenplay, and he definitely deserved it.
I:8493;448;This is Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino's undisputed masterpiece.
I:8493;449;Simply put, a genius rollercoast ride from beginning to end.
I:8493;450;With a large list of stars, including Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Christopher Walken, Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman in some of their greatest performances to date.
I:8493;451;the movie is broken up into three stories, all revolving around two hitmen (Jackson, Travolta), a mob boss's wife (Thurman), a boxer planing on retiring (Willis), and a mysterious breifcase, this fast paced film is probably one of the greatest action films EVER.
I:8493;452;The dialogue is what you would expect from Tarantino, with plenty of funny but memorable lines that you will remember forever.
I:8493;453;"hard cast, a chaotic but focused storyline, and an unbelievable soundtrack, including the classic ""Miserlou"" by Dick Dale and the Del. tones, this film is definately Tarantino's funniest, most violent, and most fun romp to date, and one of the top ten greatest films ever!"
I:8493;454;See it and you will not regret it.
I:8493;455;"goer who needs explosions and fighting in order to keep your attention, go watch ""I,Robot"" or ""AVP"" or something."
I:8493;456;This movie is about great dialouge and a combination of several styles of moviemaking, and that's what Tarantino does (and does very well), so if you don't like it, don't watch his movies.
I:8493;457;each character is set up and you watch as they met their end, an end that is appropiate for them.
I:8493;458;"That's it morality, redemeption, and respect among those who are ""evil""."
I:8493;459;That one line almost moved the picture to a two star rating.
I:8493;460;It's a classic, through and through.
I:8493;461;And how dare that a$$clown talk that way about this brilliant classic of a movie.
I:8493;462;THIS is what movies should be, fun to watch, totally engaging, great plot(s), great acting, great everything all the way around.
I:8493;463;Tarantino is one of the best directors out there.
I:8493;464;I havent seen Hostel yet, but he didnt actually direct that one.
I:8493;465;Timeless classic movie that any movie buff should enjoy and appreciate for what it is.
I:8493;466;This is another all time great film.
I:8493;467;It has thrills all the way through.
I:8493;468;All the actors are great in this film.
I:8493;469;Definitely in my top 10 films of all time.
I:8493;470;A great weave of 4 seemingly unrelated tales which artfully tie together during the movie.
I:8493;471;watched it at least 5 times and discover something new about it everytime I see it!
I:8493;472;That pretty much speaks for itself.
I:8493;473;Second, this is a very religous and spiritual movie.
I:8493;474;The main theme of the movie is redemption.
I:8493;475;There's just too many good things happening in this movie.
I:8493;476;A great movie with some great extras.
I:8493;477;The disc itself works fine.
I:8493;478;It's a classic movie, and personally I love it.
I:8493;479;if you are into this kind of movie,it is a really action packed movie with some sick humor it will hold your attention
I:8493;480;Confusing at first but found my way in a few minutes and loved it all the way!!
I:8493;481;The movie is rich with detail, with references tomarijuana culture among other things.
I:8493;482;there are many reviews on this movie, it is perhaps one of the greatest films ever produced.
I:8493;483;easily the best film of the 1990's decade.
I:8493;484;What then makes this movie so powerful?
I:8493;485;Perhaps this ambiguity, or multiple layers of meanings is what makes the film so powerful.
I:8493;486;This film is his greatest work.
I:8493;487;It is not only above Quentin Tarantino's normal fare, it is above most other movies.
I:8493;488;So so many classic lines you'll need to revisit time and time again.
I:8493;489;my bro in law received this from us for xmas and loved it.
I:8493;490;super fast shipment and will use in future!
I:8493;491;A great concept film that keeps your attention from beginning to end!
I:8493;492;It will always remain a cult classic in pulp films.
I:8493;493;Pulp Fiction is one of the most successful movies of the 90's.
I:8493;494;With Tarantino's breakout film Reservoir Dogs, this young director showed potential.
I:8493;495;Pulp Fiction was an even better film, and garnered even more respect.
I:8493;496;tarantino really shines in his script and directing style.
I:8493;497;It has some pretty amazing and even intellectual lines.
I:8493;498;The sets look great, there is some great cinematography, like random camera angles at the opposite end of the hall, with the characters on the other end.
I:8493;499;Things like this makes the movie unique.
I:8493;500;the acting is great, and the roles were picked perfectly.
I:8493;501;This is a movie you can not miss, and is entertaining, but has a very great plot too.
I:8493;502;Yet, immediately after one of the two most shocking scenes, you laugh.
I:8493;503;In fact there's something comic about the whole film.
I:8493;504;Watch it on a big screen with big sound, if you can.
I:8493;505;This is an entertaining movie but I found the first half rather slow.
I:8493;506;I highly recommend it, for the action and the music.
I:8493;507;This is one of the best movies of all times.
I:8493;508;This is by far my favorite film.
I:8493;509;Quentin Tarantino once again gives us witty dialogue, thrilling scenes, and memorable characters.
I:8493;510;A tale of love, loyalty, betrayal, crime, and featuring an A. list of actors such as John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel and Christopher Walken.
I:8493;511;Pulp Fiction is quite a ride, I hope you enjoy it.
I:8493;512;Tarantino loves to play with genres, mixing things up then turning on the blender.
I:8493;513;He makes characters into every day ordinary people with big, wild backgrounds in them.
I:8493;514;They cause me a great headache each time I TRY to use that service.
I:8493;515;Keeps you wondering, thinking, enjoying the outcome and wanting to watch again.
I:8493;516;Pulp Fiction is a cinematic masterpiece.
I:8493;517;From the beautifully crafted interwoven storyline to the memorable dialogue, Pulp Fiction is a sensation.
I:8493;518;Easily one of the top ten films of the 90's.
I:8493;519;John Travolta makes a brilliant comeback and Sam Jackson establishes himself as a truly Bad Motherf**ker .
I:8493;520;This is one of my all time favorite movies, with its huge cast, detailed story line, wacky humor, it is a movie that everyone should see at least twice!
I:8493;521;But the movie is in english and looks great.
I:8493;522;One of my all time favorite movies.
I:8493;523;No matter how many times I've seen it it is always so cool.
I:8493;524;The picture is great and the extras are even better
I:8493;525;This, I have to say is one of the most realistic, exciting movies I have ever seen!
I:8493;526;The entire movie fits together like a puzzle.
I:8493;527;Quentin Terrantino did a great job of writing as well as directing.
I:8493;528;This one stayed with me for weeks.
I:8493;529;What kind of story is this, and why is it considered entertainment?
I:8493;530;One of the year's best films???
I:8493;531;After then watching the 2nd disc and hearing the method behind the madness of deleting parts the director had, it made the movie more complete and understandably enjoyable.
I:8493;532;This was such a great movie to watch.
I:8493;533;I enjoyed this movie so much it was awsome!
I:8493;534;I love the narrating way that Tarintino makes his movies it is so original I love it!
I:8493;535;This film is by far the best movie of it's year!
I:8493;536;I'm a big fan of action and vignette movies.
I:8493;537;i guess the strong performances of the cast made it possible to make this movie what it is A VERY DARK ACTION/DRAMA/COMEDY
I:8493;538;Had to get this movie to add to my collection since it is a cult classic.
I:8493;539;John Travolta best scene, well to me, was the dance one.
I:8493;540;Quentin Tarantino's gangster melodrama is riveting from start to finish.
I:8493;541;The way the scenes are all connected makes it difficult for me to pick out a favorite one, but I loved the final diner scene.
I:8493;542;Great roles for John Travolta and Bruce Willis, but Samuel L. Jackson's Jules steals the show.
I:8493;543;The scenes originally edited from the film, but included on the video are also a nice bonus.
I:8493;544;Worth the watch and the re.
I:8493;545;Gritty edgy scenes that push the limits of story telling!
I:8493;546;The first time I saw pulp fiction, was amazing!
I:8493;547;Everything was good about it: the actors, the action, the way it made me feel.
I:8493;548;comGreeting from Christian, a pulp fiction .
I:8493;549;Well, this is the best movie ever but I already knew that.
I:8493;550;My favorite role for every actor in here.
I:8493;551;It came quickly, the packaging was really good and protected it from any possible damage.
I:8493;552;It's a classic Quentin Tarantino film you'll be making quotes from or recognizing others quotes from!
I:8493;553;Dripping with attitude, this film is a great romp with a star.
I:8493;554;I highly recommend this film for its extremely witty script, and for how the actors become their charcters, as opposed to simply playing themselves (Except for maybe Bruce Willis).
I:8493;555;This movie is a classic, start to finish.
I:8493;556;Wonderful weaving of stories, characters, lives.
I:8493;557;You already know and love the film.
I:8493;558;first, the film is truly gorgeous, for better or worse.
I:8493;559;There is very little technically unsound.
I:8493;560;just clean and crisp resolution.
I:8493;561;Seriously, this film is so sharp that I could see each and every pore on Samuel L Jackson's face.
I:8493;562;documentaries about the film and its effect on the film industry.
I:8493;563;There are also interviews, award shows, making of, and a fun trivia pop up game.
I:8493;564;One of the, if not THE finest film by Quentin Tarantino, this movie can be considered a crash course in cinematic brilliance.
I:8493;565;A nearly flawless movie in stunning hi.
I:8493;566;The sharpness of the picture and sound is unparalleled in small screen devices.
I:8493;567;Came on time and enjoyed watching this movie.
I:8493;568;One of my favorite movies.
I:8493;569;This is a classic movie that is entertaining from the beginning.
I:8493;570;Movie looks unreal, so gorgeous.
I:8493;571;Like seeing it for the first time.
I:8493;572;Also, John Travolta is a lot of delicious fun in this movie with Uma Thurman and Samuel Jackson, but there should have been a lot more scenes with him in it.
I:8493;573;John Travolta should be dancing and romancing, and Samuel Jackson should be saying F. words, and Bruce Willis should be smirking while he walks on broken glass.
I:8493;574;i liked the music fine although it was too loud at times.
I:8493;575;Great movie and great extras.
I:8493;576;This movie shows just how great the director is.
I:8493;577;Also Steve buscemi is buddy Holly
I:8493;578;This is my favorite movie and down it's a classic and one that's worth watching multiple times!
I:8493;579;And I think that is a true testament of a classic and excellent movie, can you watch it more than once.
I:8493;580;And I think Pulp Fiction stands up to that challenge easily.
I:8493;581;now I think the best part of this movie in my opinion is the dialogue.
I:8493;582;This movie help me to truly appreciate Quentin Tarantino's ability to make funny and interesting banter among his characters.
I:8493;583;And once you watch the movie the gravity of that statement is so poignant and classic.
I:8493;584;another one I told you love is the scenes with Lance and Vincent they are awesome.
I:8493;585;To me Eric Stoltz just crushes it is Lance and his demeanor and presentation is amazing.
I:8493;586;so I can say is you need to watch this movie and fall in love with it because it's so worth your time and money.
I:8493;587;"pS I find myself constantly saying ""that is a tasty burger!"""
I:8493;588;Thanks to those who do this.
I:8493;589;this is a fantastic Blu.
I:8493;590;I didn't see any grain at all, and the detail was excellent.
I:8493;591;i am very pleased with this Blu.
I:8493;592;This is one of my favorite movies, so I was waiting for the Blu.
I:8493;593;I think they did a great job making it.
I:8493;594;With only two films, Tarantino established himself as a fresh new talent.
I:8493;595;There's Butch Coolidge, a prize fighter with a price on his head, played by Bruce Willis.
I:8493;596;There's Vincent Vega and Jules Winnefield, two hitman played expertly by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson.
I:8493;597;The structure of the film is so well crafted you just won't believe it.
I:8493;598;What makes this film so special is the humor.
I:8493;599;It is a moment that is so brilliant, nobody could copy it.
I:8493;600;In the end, you feel so excited, you wish the movie wasn't over.
I:8493;601;This movie easily qualified as an instant classic.
I:8493;602;Even Willis demonstrates some wicked acting chops in a beautifully understated performance.
I:8493;603;Christopher Walken, too, provides the most satisfying and memorable cameo!)
I:8493;604;casual movie lovers will enjoy this as just a great film.
I:8493;605;So many memorable characters and outrageous story lines.
I:8493;606;I would definite recommend this one.
I:8493;607;I think about moments from this film and laugh all the time.
I:8493;608;Pulp Fiction inspired me to love cinema for all it is and can be.
I:8493;609;The story is superbly told, the characters all are distinct and noticable, and the dialogue makes you think you're sitting in a diner overhearing someone speak.
I:8493;610;The movie is on of the best of all time, and it would be my only choice if I were to have to view one for the rest of my life.
I:8493;611;Best movie ever, non linear story, great acting, Samuel Jackson's and John Travolta's best work, wonderful soundtrack, Urge Overkill has best song in the movie.
I:8493;612;This is a true iconic movie that is a must see.
I:8493;613;It is so well made that it looks realistic.
I:8493;614;Anyway the movie is very bizarre but great.
I:8493;615;There is a very good friend of mine who has memorised the entire script, the whole dialogue of Pulp Fiction.
I:8493;616;Why he loves this film is easy to understand.
I:8493;617;it is a well written tale, the content is interesting, and the acting and soundtrack set a new precedent in American filmmaking.
I:8493;618;but did the American public understand that this new film, new in various technical innovations, and inventive in the standard storytelling model, the circular plot,and studiously criticises the industry of filmmaking and American life in general?Tarantino and Roger Avery won the Oscar in 1994 for best original screenplay, the actors, however, with the likes of Jackson and Travolta, received only nominations and nominations well worth it.
I:8493;619;my good friend and I spent the afternoon viewing this film and laughing, feeling the tension, knowing, (because we have seen it so many times) every line, waiting for that one very cool line, to then laugh again.
I:8493;620;well written, certainly, but the dialogue, makes the film.
I:8493;621;"jackson and Travolta are astounding
I:8493;622;i love this film and certainly recommend it to die.
I:8493;623;Shocking, outrageous and profound .
I:8493;624;Pulp fiction breaks away from the normal movie stories and how they play, it's a great change of pace and the actors are awesome at their roles
I:8493;625;Pulp Fiction is one of the best films I have ever seen.
I:8493;626;It is very surreal and amusing at the same time.
I:8493;627;proclaimed moralists, but the film is a vivid reminder that the world is not the way we want it to be.
I:8493;628;"john Travolta stole the spotlight
I:8493;629;Samuel Jackson was also great.
I:8493;630;I also enjoyed Bruce Willis as the boxer .
I:8493;631;his performance was quite impressive.
I:8493;632;I also enjoyed Uma Thurman and Rosanna Arquette in their supporting roles.
I:8493;633;The acting, the incredibly witty script, and the way it was put together is a piece of work!
I:8493;634;But this movie is fantastic!!!
I:8493;635;If you like Bruce Willis or John Travolta films, you will enjoy this.
I:8493;636;It is one of the best films ever!!!
I:8493;637;I love watching this movie.
I:8493;638;The characters are over the top, well acted and memorable.
I:8493;639;i wrote Amazon yesterday, mindful of their refund policy and asked nicely if there was any answer.
I:8493;640;great movie and great satisfaction from Amazon!
I:8493;641;I've always loved this movie.
I:8493;642;One of my all time favorite movies!
I:8493;643;Cult classic, never laughed so hard.
I:8493;644;I liked this movie because it was so typically outrageous Tarantino.
I:8493;645;I agree with everything that's been written about this outstanding film.
I:8493;646;Rest assured, this movie is brilliant, and looks great and finally WILL play on your American players.
I:8493;647;Great ensemble cast, some crazy twists and vintage script.
I:8493;648;I give pulp fiction 5/5 stars!
I:8493;649;This movie has completely redefined entertainment for so many reasons.
I:8493;650;Great dialogue, great acting and and great action.
I:8493;651;I really love how Tarantino alludes his story in a non.
I:8493;652;linear fashion, as it makes it unique and definitely surprising.
I:8493;653;I highly recommend this film to not only Tarantino fans, but movie fans in general.
I:8493;654;A foreign PF has the right color timing and I suggest people go there.
I:8493;655;Those films look fantastic to me despite some not liking the teal or whatever, it certainly fits their mood and tone.
I:8493;656;Everything about this movie just seems to be perfect, from the acting to the directing to the dialogue to the soundtrack to the storyline.
I:8493;657;Just the style, the atmosphere, the environment surrounding this fascinating group of people, draws you in and keeps you enthralled until the very last line ( I think we should be leaving ) is uttered.
I:8493;658;Though the characters do perform technically illegal acts, one must look beyond the acts themselves and see people who struggle with justifying these acts.
I:8493;659;This is what makes this movie simply brilliant, its endless shades of gray infusing a vividly colorful film.
I:8493;660;time favorite movies, so there may be some bias in my review since I am such a huge fan.
I:8493;661;I was not a Tarantino fan, so I went into this movie with a completely open mind.
I:8493;662;The way the scenes are shot, the use of music, and the incredible dialogue and mastery of the human language sets this movie apart on a level with the classics.
I:8493;663;On top of the wonderful cinematography, the acting is superb as well.
I:8493;664;Seeing people like Sam Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, and Ving Rhames in a film before becoming superstars shows the brilliance of the casting.
I:8493;665;As one who was only 12 when Pulp Fiction was first released, and therefore, too young to appreciate it's significance, I have a great appreciation for the extras on this edition.
I:8493;666;There is also footage from the Cannes Film Festival that Pulp Fiction won with ease.
I:8493;667;Anyone who likes this film needs this edition of Pulp Fiction, not only because it is such a good movie, but because it carries with it all the proof anyone could ask for that this film is an achievement in pop culture history, and deserves a place among the classics.
I:8493;668;I love Quentin Tarintino's films he has a unique twisted touch that no other director has in the film industry.
I:8493;669;This film has action,comedy and some revival of catch phrases from past generations.
I:8493;670;John Travolta is a great actor, I bought this one for a Christmas Present.
I:8493;671;Clever technique in story telling and character development.
I:8493;672;Travolta and several others gave excellent performances.
I:8493;673;But what about the emotional fervency of Samuel Jackson's performance and the film's extraordinarily moving conclusion?
I:8493;674;The dialogue is rich, funny, and hip.
I:8493;675;The performances are terrific and a sense of dangerous fun keeps the picture spinning.
I:8493;676;A vignette in the middle of the film involving a drug overdose and a terrifying method of resucitation bounces off the walls with kinetic energy and a lengthy monologue delivered by Christopher Walken ends with a punchline so unexpected, you're doubled over with laughter.
I:8493;677;But the film takes a thoughtful turn at the end, countering this joyful mayhem with a powerful monologue, delivered with brio and furious concentration by Samuel Jackson.
I:8493;678;And underneath the bloodshed lies a deep humanity.
I:8493;679;I think this was one of QT's best films.
I:8493;680;I would have like more special features, but this is a must.
I:8493;681;Nothing else really like it, Tarantino is an auteur for the ages.
I:8493;682;What I find interesting about this film is the strong reaction so many people have to it.
I:8493;683;full of wonderful dialogue and a terrific cast (Samuel Jackson not winning the Oscar in 1994 for Best Supporting Actor is one if the worst decisions by the Academy in the 1990's).
I:8493;684;This movie hums along with a terrific soundtrack.
I:8493;685;It gets better with each viewing and you pick up little details that may have been missed in the first viewing.
I:8493;686;This is all good stuff.
I:8493;687;The movie can also be watched with a enhanced trivia track that provides interesting tidbits on the bottom of the screen.
I:8493;688;I really liked that feature.
I:8493;689;The sound is terrific as is the color print.
I:8493;690;AFI named it one of the 100 best films of the century and they were right.
I:8493;691;This is a fun ride and don't be put off by all the talk of gore.
I:8493;692;This is one that belongs in any film lover's collection.
I:8493;693;This is a great item.
I:8493;694;Therefore, I would truly recommend this product.
I:8493;695;'Pulp Fiction' is and will always be remembered as one of the defining moments in cinema today.
I:8493;696;Upon it's release it opened eyes and paved the way for films to come that will continue to draw from this masterpiece of a film, never being able to capture what made this so brilliant in the first place.
I:8493;697;It's called a brilliant script coupled with brilliant acting.
I:8493;698;Uma is stunning and captivating, Travolta is o top of his game and Jackson is scene stealing in his best role ever.
I:8493;699;Willis and Rhames feed off each other perfectly and add a side story that is both hilarious in it's own seriousness.
I:8493;700;Great film most everyone can enjoy.
I:8493;701;There's a reason this film is considered legendary!
I:8493;702;its an awesome movie its funny suspenseful and awesome it is not a kid movie its its fun to watch
I:8493;703;minute valentine from Quentin Tarantino to his own perceived genius.
I:8493;704;This is by far one of the best movies ever made.
I:8493;705;This is an awesome movie.
I:8493;706;Plus rumors have it that they will reveal what is in the Misterious Case.
I:8493;707;A great Blu Ray pickup.
I:8493;708;An amazing movie from an amazing director and cast.
I:8493;709;A movie that everybody should watch at least twice.
I:8493;710;It is the definitive Tarantino film and the definitive film of the 1990s, and is far more than just a genre piece, but a commentary on cinema itself.
I:8493;711;Not a moment of QT's spectacular stunt would have worked without the healthy doses of irony and humor injected into the script, which is one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century.
I:8493;712;I enjoy this movie on many levels, primarily because of Quentin Tarantino's dark, offbeat humor and the star power fueling the film.
I:8493;713;Christopher Walken is hilarious as the Vietnam Vet.
I:8493;714;The storytelling is great, the acting is superb, and there is enough comedy and ultraviolence to make you want more when it's over.
I:8493;715;intoxicated with the very act of making a movie.
I:8493;716;the screenplay, by Tarantino and Roger Avary, is so well.
I:8493;717;travolta and Uma Thurman have a sequence that's funny and bizarre.
I:8493;718;"That's before she overdoses and Stoltz, waving a syringe filled with adrenaline, screams at Travolta, ""YOU brought her here, YOU stick in the needle!"
I:8493;719;Walken's monologue builds to the movie's biggest laugh.
I:8493;720;if the situations are inventive and original, so is the dialogue.
I:8493;721;"But the people in ""Pulp Fiction"" are in love with words for their own sake."
I:8493;722;The dialogue by Tarantino and Avary is off the wall sometimes, but that's the fun.
I:8493;723;Pulp Fiction, the 1994 film which stunned the world.
I:8493;724;"Critics hailed this film as ""the film which has redefined motionpictures in the 20th century,"" and it surely did."
I:8493;725;Pulp Fiction also led many actors on the road to stardom including John Travolta who delivered a great performance, but the real star here is Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winnfield.
I:8493;726;Jackson just has a presence on screen which is fantastic, his portrayal of anger is displayed so realistically and whenever he recites a certain passage from the Bible, it makes you quiver in a sense.
I:8493;727;Also features nice performances from Ving Rhames who plays the manager of Willis who soon gets involved in a huge dispute with him, Uma Thurman who plays Mia Wallce, she's the girl John Travolta has to babysit.
I:8493;728;Eric Stolz as Lance, Harvey Keital as Mr. Wolf, Christopher Walken and Quentin Tarantino also show up in some cameo performances.
I:8493;729;Tarantino along with Roger Avary won the oscar for Best Original Screenplay in the 1995 Academy Awards and it's easy to see why.
I:8493;730;This is one the best films of the decade, and still remains to be, it's a cult classic.
I:8493;731;stop essentially and it's also quite strong.
I:8493;732;By far a great movie!
I:8493;733;I have watched it sooo many times and would still watch it again.
I:8493;734;Fair to say it is a classic?
I:8493;735;It's twists and turns I liked a lot.
I:8493;736;The plot was always changing and a good ending.
I:8493;737;One of the greatest movies aver.
I:8493;738;which release is the best?
I:8493;739;This is an excellent flick.
I:8493;740;The script is superbly written and direction is flawless.
I:8493;741;While watching this movie, I was eating rice and fish and I laughed so hard that I made sushi in my nasopharynx.
I:8493;742;There is no way you can TELL some one how good this movie is.
I:8493;743;Tie them to a chair and make them watch it.
I:8493;744;it is the most action.
I:8493;745;packed movie i have seen and it is very exciting.
I:8493;746;if you like Quentin tarantino's work then you will love this movie.
I:8493;747;This in my top 5 movies of all time list.
I:8493;748;The visuals and audio are top notch.
I:8493;749;This will always be a classic movie.
I:8493;750;Great movie I haven't seen in years.
I:8493;751;Still a super awesome movie with one of the best soundtracks ever.
I:8493;752;wow it's such a perfect movie.
I:8493;753;great cast and script overall acting and dialog is awesome.
I:8493;754;I usually have a hard time watching movies by Quentin Tarantino, but this was great!
I:8493;755;This is still Tarantino's best, but all his movies are amazing.
I:8493;756;Pulp Fiction is a fantastic movie nominated for 7 Oscars and winning 1 (Best Original Sccreenplay.
I:8493;757;So, being a huge fan of films, when I herd this was on Blu.
I:8493;758;ray I was very excited.
I:8493;759;I bought it just a few weeks ago and never got the chance to write my review.
I:8493;760;The soundtrack is one of the best of the 1990's.
I:8493;761;this movie is just fun, there is so much thoughtful dialogue to chew on.
I:8493;762;when Mia (Uma Thurman) and Vincent (John Travolta) arrive at Jack Rabbit Slims for their dinner, she comments to him that an Elvis man should love this place.
I:8493;763;the movie has violence, drug use, and lots of profanity, but I think the great story telling still makes it a fun movie.
I:8493;764;There is lots of humor in this movie, in a twisted sort of way.
I:8493;765;right after the main titles with Vincent and Jules riding in the car.
I:8493;766;Quinton Tarantino produces, directs, and writes Pulp Fiction wonderfully, giving it a unique 70's funky vibe.
I:8493;767;John Travolta makes a triumphant comeback, making this his best performance since Saturday Night Fever .
I:8493;768;deserving of their Oscar nominations for their acting roles.
I:8493;769;The Travolta and Thurman dance club scene is unforgettable.
I:8493;770;Thurman's next scene is when she shines more than anywhere else(can't say how).
I:8493;771;This movie will be a classic for years to come.
I:8493;772;"I remember seeing ""Pulp Fiction"" in the theatre back in 1994."
I:8493;773;It was then that I knew I was watching something great.
I:8493;774;One has to go back to the seventies when Scorsese, Spielberg, et al. emerged on the scene to find a truly original voice in American cinema.
I:8493;775;The use of pop music, probably records in his personal collection, to comment on the action is superb.
I:8493;776;The actors he recruited for this film(John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames) had their careers either jump.
I:8493;777;This is an important film in the scheme of American cinema because it shows that the rules for making a film can be changed and for the better.
I:8493;778;A perfect example of how movies used to be made.
I:8493;779;This will grab your attention and keep you entertained from beginning to end.
I:8493;780;Writer Director Quentin Tarantino do right in his second movie a mixture of classic thrillers with somewhat wickledy funny humor.
I:8493;781;all with memorable dialogue,soundtrack and use excessive of some swear words.
I:8493;782;If you have never seen this movie, take a couple of hours to relax and enjoy a classic.
I:8493;783;A classic for all time.
I:8493;784;THe action and story lines in this movie are great and keep you on the edge of your seat!
I:8493;785;Although this movie is built on a reasonnably solid foundation, the true genius of Pulp Fiction lies in it's eyepleasing exteria!!!!!
I:8493;786;Dan Brown, writer of the best selling book, the Da Vinci Code, thinks that what QT has done is very innovative and will have impact on all films to come!!
I:8493;787;IT came to be known, therefore, that such films were seldom creative or original because of their commercial nature.
I:8493;788;And so, a new generation of cinema was created: Trainspotting, Kill Bill, Fight Club, AHX, Power Rangers, Kevin and Perry do America.
I:8493;789;uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction is the most sexually captivating woman in movie history!
I:8493;790;She holds all the quintessential female qualities that make men happy.
I:8493;791;She's intelligent, beautiful, slim, eager, cute, sexy, doughty, fearless, oblivious, assertive (but not arrogant or obnoxios), dangerous, adorable, blissful, delicate, and powerful.
I:8493;792;The clothes that QT dresses her in are interesting too, they cling to her body showing off her beautiful, slim feminine shape!
I:8493;793;The Vincent\Mia dance scene was probably the best sex scene in movie history.
I:8493;794;With excellent timing and precision, I might add.
I:8493;795;Pulp Fiction is one box office blockbuster that certainly doesn't compromise on principle, as it features four uniquely interwoven, well.
I:8493;796;It is also funny and ironic that both opening and closing scenes were shot at the same locale, with the same exact sequence, too, creating a bunch of loose ends left for the viewer to tie together, as noted above, leaving the viewer to use his or her imagination here.
I:8493;797;Director Quentin Tarantino lets the audience participate in this upstanding masterpiece, and doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence in the process, which is only part of the beauty of watching a movie of this caliber.
I:8493;798;"The other part, is watching ""PF""'s all."
I:8493;799;star cast add their individual perspectives and talents to each of the characters they portray, with both John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson portraying savvy and suave hit men, Bruce Willis portraying a tough.
I:8493;800;"All in all, ""Pulp Fiction"" is Quentin Tarantino's absolute best directorial study in contrast, and is a real eye."
I:8493;801;The VHS Special Edition also features some added trailer footage at the conclusion of the film, narrated by Tarantino himself .
I:8493;802;"another outstanding reason why ""Pulp Fiction"" is a must."
I:8493;803;see, must own motion picture that belongs in every movie buff's video library!
I:8493;804;I also got to share the movie with someone who had never seen it.
I:8493;805;I haven't perused all of the extras yet but good value from Amazon.
I:8493;806;Great price for a instant classic !!!
I:8493;807;If you like to watch people get high and talk filthy this is for you.
I:8493;808;Decent movie, lots and lots of classic one liners.
I:8493;809;This movie is amazing in so many ways.
I:8493;810;The cast of characters is only surpassed by the amazing dialog.
I:8493;811;A treasure trove of quotable scenes.
I:8493;812;You can see a new layer every time you watch it.
I:8493;813;Pulp Fiction, in my opinion ,is truly the kind of film that really has all the elements of a great film that I will probably never forget.
I:8493;814;great acting,story and a really cool soundtrack make this film worth seeing.
I:8493;815;john Travolta and Samuel L. jackson both play hitmen.
I:8493;816;vinge Rhames delivers a really great performance as a crime boss.
I:8493;817;christopher Walken and Harvey Keitel both appear in hilarious appearences.
I:8493;818;a group of stories all connect into one terrific film that really took me on a trip.
I:8493;819;both of their performances are well written.
I:8493;820;the entire cast was well written.
I:8493;821;the scene where Samuel L. jackson recites a bible passage before killing Frank Wayles has to be the coldest but most impressive scenes in filmmaking to date.
I:8493;822;it deserves to be seen.
I:8493;823;After 12 years, I finally got around to seeing this one.
I:8493;824;What a wild ride, with career rescuing or career establishing performances by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson.
I:8493;825;Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Harvey Keitel, among others, add to the bloody, profane fun.
I:8493;826;He's always loved the movie but it somehow never made it to our shelf.
I:8493;827;So I got this as a gift for him and we've already watched it.
I:8493;828;Best Cult classic of all time!
I:8493;829;One minute you see John Travolta.
I:8493;830;quentin definitely establishes that he knows what he doing, with unique camera angles, sparkling script, and wonderful acting.
I:8493;831;saved by a miracle of God refers to a memorable line by Samuel L Jackson who plays a hitman that is convinced that the reason he survived near death is beacuse God's mighty hand came down and stopped the bullets.
I:8493;832;i love every aspect of this movie.
I:8493;833;i'd recommend anyone who has seen this to watch it cuz its cinematic gold
I:8493;834;In its own way, this is one of the best of the Chick Flicks.
I:8493;835;By the end of their scenes together, Travolta's and Thurman's characters are best buds, with the kinds of secrets that buddies keep.
I:8493;836;He's polite and pleasant with the bloodthirsty cab.
I:8493;837;When Thurman's character is alone with her husband, she is obviously completely happy and at ease.
I:8493;838;She wants a man she can be silently happy with.
I:8493;839;Somebody she can just sit and enjoy life with.
I:8493;840;They're both happy and comfortable and stable with each other.
I:8493;841;Harvey Keitel and his girlfriend are the picture of great pals.
I:8493;842;In a way they reflect the natural gratitude of predators .
I:8493;843;do something good for a predator, and that animal will never forget.
I:8493;844;He's been handed a Fairy Tale that shines in the past, and tried to pass it on.
I:8493;845;But the closer you get to today, the more true and the more mean the Fairy Tale always gets.
I:8493;846;"The characters in ""Pulp Fiction"" are as good and honest and true as their lives allow them to be."
I:8493;847;This movie is so symbolic.
I:8493;848;Tarantino is one of my favorite directors and with this movie showcases his style.
I:8493;849;All the actors are good in their rules.
I:8493;850;Big ups go to Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Ving Rhames, and Christopher Walken.
I:8493;851;This movie is a classic.
I:8493;852;This movie had a very talented cast.
I:8493;853;Over the years, this movie has become a cult classic, and I'm happy to own it on Blu.
I:8493;854;It will continue to disturb and delight for many more years!
I:8493;855;One of the all time greatest movies.
I:8493;856;Although very violent and at times hard to watch, has superb dialouge, monologues, and characters, as well as exceptional directing.
I:8493;857;And the way the movie is split and sequenced adds a great deal.
I:8493;858;The actors speak the script in a way to make the movie what it is, when combined with the directing.
I:8493;859;recommended for everyone to see atleast once in their lifetime.
I:8493;860;together they made up for a most excellent cast for a story that made us laugh and hold us to the edge of our seats.
I:8493;861;I recommend it to all my friends, just to feel the nostalgia.
I:8493;862;A classic movie that you can watch over and over and over again.
I:8493;863;Highly recommend for mature audiences only of course.
I:8493;864;The movie is a blindingly repressed spewage of pop culture, brilliant setup, drug excrement, softcore porn, and a magnificent mixture of philosophy, religion and violence.
I:8493;865;Thus retrained, we are blasted on a whirlwind tour of the hippest of the hip.
I:8493;866;Samuel Jackson gives the performance that will undoubtedly mark his career.
I:8493;867;It is a performance that is disturbed, hysterical, deadly, funny, compassionate, smart and scared (yes, scared.)
I:8493;868;Travolta is slick, slimy and stupidly sharp in his role.
I:8493;869;The cast is a who's who of the best cult actors of the mid.90's and Tarrantino gets them to deliver stunning performances.
I:8493;870;The dialogue is possibly the best written verbage for any film ever made and is a Holy Grail for fans of offbeat and subculture cinema.
I:8493;871;"From ""the holiest of holies"" to ""correctamundo"", the movie is the masterpiece for a guy so immersed in pop culture that he needs an oar to navigate it all."
I:8493;872;Roth is dynamic in a relatively small part and Ammanda Plummer is like a shrieking little wicked witch.
I:8493;873;Uma Thurman is a thinking man's dream.
I:8493;874;She's vulnerable, demonstrative, and most of all, playful.
I:8493;875;The dancing sequence is priceless and needs no further discussion.
I:8493;876;Willis has a nice blend of sensitivity and brutality.
I:8493;877;The movie also rips on all cultures virutally equally with a burst of fresh air.
I:8493;878;Shooting a movie of this length out of sequence was a tremendous gamble but the dialogue holds it together and it is, doubtlessly, brilliantly creative.
I:8493;879;Tarrantino evolved this idea slightly by the end of the movie and continued it in one of the best B. movies ever made, From Dusk Till Dawn.
I:8493;880;The audio and video on this blu ray release are great, considering how far technology has advanced.
I:8493;881;Tarantino's direction shines through nicely.
I:8493;882;Uma Thurman is just decadently sexy.
I:8493;883;date spin, bets on himself.
I:8493;884;Samuel Jackson is interesting as the Bible.
I:8493;885;"naturally they make us root for the bad guys
I:8493;886;A Hollywood movie, a commercial flick, is always a clich .
I:8493;887;What a cast, what a concept, what edgey art, what genius.
I:8493;888;The year this landmark film came out another off.
I:8493;889;"beat film matched it in box office power or perhaps surpassed it, ""Forrest Gump"" which swept the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay but Tarantino's film has influenced many films thereafter like ""Lucky Number 7"", ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" plus many other Guy Ritchie's films."
I:8493;890;memorable moment in the whole 2 hour plus running time.
I:8493;891;"So all I can say at this point it's a matter of taste between a comedic dark film noir and a fable expertly done as ""Forrest Gump""."
I:8493;892;If you haven't seen it, watch it!
I:8493;893;Pulp Fiction is the 2nd film by Quentin Tarantino, who also made the entertaining Kill Bill movies.
I:8493;894;The first story is about one of the hitmen, Vincent, taking care of the boss's wife, Mia, while he's gone.
I:8493;895;Mia takes some strong drugs and passes out, with halarious results!The second is about a boxer who betrayed the crime boss and is now hiding from him.
I:8493;896;Lots of spicy discussions and topics.
I:8493;897;The acting is great too.
I:8493;898;If you haven't seen it yet, well do so, NOW!
I:8493;899;One of the best movies ever!
I:8493;900;its originality did PARTIALLY stem from past compilations .
I:8493;901;t, it was a fantastic twistable movie.
I:8493;902;Its a movie that will keep your HEAD and MIND ready and willing to spin and be spun.
I:8493;903;great acting ( Excellent job with Samuel L Jackson in particular ) great plot and characters, and killer absoultely great humor!!
I:8493;904;hearted and draw in the gullible masses that'll watch anything that shocks the faint.
I:8493;905;He knows that jumping back and forth in time during scenes can be very effective.
I:8493;906;And Quentin knows how to do it very effectively.
I:8493;907;again, I refer you back to Resevoir Dogs, a brilliant flick where he used devices in a very effective and stirring way.
I:8493;908;There is some decent acting by some of the involved actors, given the undesirable script.
I:8493;909;I know that you know how to make a brilliant movie.
I:8493;910;Look at me, I am a Quentin Tarantino fan!
I:8493;911;I am so hip and cool because I sit around and praise his movies like they are the greatest thing ever put on film.
I:8493;912;Look at me, I am a Quentin Tarantino fan!
I:8493;913;This is a great movie,it does take a lot to understand the flips in the movie.
I:8493;914;If given a chance the movie is really a good movie, took me watching the movie twice.
I:8493;915;This is one brilliant, amazing and well thought out movie in which has everybody interested!
I:8493;916;Quentin Tarantino impressed us with 'Resevoir Dogs' but Pulp Fiction stunned people.
I:8493;917;This is probably one of the best movies ever made.
I:8493;918;Starring * John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, Rosanna Arquette, Christopher Walken, and Bruce Willis * to name a few.
I:8493;919;Quentin Tarantino, this is your best work.
I:8493;920;Great cast, great scenery, great cinematography, great plot, great great great movie.
I:8493;921;The film is supported by an excellent soundtrack .
I:8493;922;This is a good tip for a little talented director .
I:8493;923;One of the best movies ever!!
I:8493;924;I loved the way Tarantino did this movie, every time you watch it you will see something new
I:8493;925;In my humble opinion, this is the best film ever made.
I:8493;926;I know that might sicken some film buffs, but just give it time and it will be considered by more and more poeple to be the best thing ever put on the silver screen.
I:8493;927;Mix this with an all star cast and you have a masterpiece.
I:8493;928;Ran well the first time I placed in blu.
I:8493;929;This film was entertaining at best.
I:8493;930;Yes, it was cool that the beginning and the end scenes tie the story together, but think about it.
I:8493;931;That moment was pretty funny, though.
I:8493;932;All most of you can do is call it a masterpiece and leave it at that.
I:8493;933;however, there are some strong points.
I:8493;934;Sameul L. Jackson gives an incredible performance in this movie, although the flaw I mentioned earlier lies in Tarantino's stupid idea, not Samuel's acting.
I:8493;935;There were also some very funny parts, like when Bruce Willis's character is searching for a weapon and keeps on finding a better one until he finally rests his eyes on a samurai sword.
I:8493;936;so is this movie worth a watch?
I:8493;937;You'll be entertained if you're not a Tar.
I:8493;938;head, you'll declare this movie as the greatest thing since electricity.
I:8493;939;And that's just the way it is.
I:8493;940;It features superb acting, and the character development is so wonderful that we find ourselves CARING about drug.
I:8493;941;This film is best viewed when one can throw their film prejudice aside and take the movie for what it is: a classic.
I:8493;942;I bought this at a really good price and am so glad that I did!
I:8493;943;This is a fantastic film!
I:8493;944;Lots of crackling dialogue throughout, both funny and smart.
I:8493;945;Pulp fiction is one of the best movies ever made, period.
I:8493;946;The story, the sequence, the characters, the setting.
I:8493;947;It shows a cross section of society that is on the outer fringe, yet those who are also out there that are still not beyond redemption, and those willing to stand up to the evil elements that are able to escape what could be their pitfall.
I:8493;948;the storyline is so rich, the characters so intriguing, that this movie is not only good, but worth 10 viewings to catch some of the subtlties you might miss the first few times.
I:8493;949;Just a great flick, with John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson playing fantastic roles!
I:8493;950;This is one of my all time favorite films of any genre.
I:8493;951;Holds up and is still amazing.
I:8493;952;Tarantino is without doubt the 1990's god of pulp cinema, and a collector's series of his best movie ever will certainly be welcomed with open arms!
I:8493;953;why no spanish subtitle for the special feature, fantastic movie one of my favorites ever.
I:8493;954;thanks for good images and sound
I:8493;955;One of my top 5 movies of all time.
I:8493;956;I was very happy with all of the extras available on the Blu.
I:8493;957;This is one of those cult classics that is a must!!!
I:8493;958;Great dialogue and tonnes of monologues and quotes!!
I:8493;959;One of the best movies.
I:8493;960;First of all, I will not deny this fact for one second: Quentin Tarantino is an ingenious writer.
I:8493;961;The dialogue he creates is witty, cool, cutting, and incredibly raw.
I:8493;962;"Still, even with such little at his disposal, Quentin delivers
I:8493;963;up really takes away from what, if correct according to its own time line, would be a fascinating, and completely rewarding film.
I:8493;964;The characters are a necessary piece to the Pulp.
I:8493;965;Maybe Samuel saw the two ending up like the two hitmen somewhere down the line, and he saw a chance to preempt as much.
I:8493;966;One could even liken it to Hitchcock's more inventive moments.
I:8493;967;Surely this is as imaginative a move as that.
I:8493;968;all in all, Pulp Fiction is arguably the most innovative of Quentin Tarantino's films, amongst the fairly straightforward narrative of Reservoir Dogs, the 70's action film homage that was Jackie Brown, and the Samurai throwback Kill Bill 1 And 2.
I:8493;969;Because, you may feel like I did the first time I saw it.
I:8493;970;But, remember, they laughed at Hitchcock, too.
I:8493;971;one of my favorites since I was young.
I:8493;972;Great movie, great cast and an all around good movie night pick.
I:8493;973;have a drink and take a seat.
I:8493;974;Great script, Great music and classic Tarantino.
I:8493;975;Its good to remember that this is written as a tongue in cheek homage to literary pulp fiction.
I:8493;976;I gave this movie 4 stars because of the acting line up: John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Maria de Medeiros, Rosanna Arquette.
I:8493;977;it's gritty, it's racy, it's trashy, it's fiction, it's Quentin Tarantino.
I:8493;978;If you like Quentin Tarantino then you will love this movie.
I:8493;979;Travola exceptional, Kietal was superb.
I:8493;980;cast excellent, What an adventure of live by the sword die by the sword
I:8493;981;Pulp Fiction is easily the greatest movie of all time.
I:8493;982;The widescreen format makes the movie look like it did when it was at the theaters.
I:8493;983;Great writing, quick witted, funny, intelligent.
I:8493;984;It's a trailblazer, wholly original and carries the mark of all marketable trailblazer's in that it spawned countless cliche's.
I:8493;985;Jackie Brown and Resovoir Dogs were both highly inventive and interesting and all that but this one just pulls ahead.
I:8493;986;So many intwined stories, it is so not linear and yet sequeanced perfectly to further the movie.
I:8493;987;Sheeeeeit, that's all I have to say.
I:8493;988;it had alot of related life issues were the understanding and meaning of respect to each other and enjoy life.
I:8493;989;Hmmm, now that's a Good burger!
I:8493;990;So by seeing the previews, I thought this movie would be good.
I:8493;991;I've been more entertained by Sponge Bob before.
I:8493;992;Great movie, a mondern day classic, with improved sound on Blue.
I:8493;993;"My son brought over ""Pulp Fiction"", a movie that he loved, and I sat through this thing shaking my head (a strange and seedy flick, to say the least)."
I:8493;994;He left me the tape, and a few months later I viewed it again (at his urging).
I:8493;995;I ended up really enjoying this film and its unique perspective of direction.
I:8493;996;I certainly realize this film won't be to everyones' taste, (it is very offensive) but sometimes one has to give a movie with potential another chance.
I:8493;997;"Between 1 and 10, ""Pulp Fiction"" gets a solid 7."
I:8493;998;It's brilliant, shocking, funny daring.
I:8493;999;not only is this one of the smartest films of the 90's, it also might be the funniest.
I:8493;1000;You'll be quoting lines at the most inapprorpriate times, as there are a ton of great one liners.
I:8493;1001;Once you're hooked, you're hooked for life.
I:8493;1002;This movie is the pinnacle of excellent movie making.
I:8493;1003;While Quentin Tarantino stays in my mind as one of the strangest individuals in the entertainment business after perhaps Crispin Glover and Michael Jackson, I think his ability to creat a cinematic masterpiece is of the highest level.
I:8493;1004;this movie stands as one of the greatest movies of all time.
I:8493;1005;The intertwining of movie making and storyline are what make this movie so wonderful!
I:8493;1006;Casting was top notch, as well as makeup and costume design.
I:8493;1007;It was phenomenal watching him on the big screen, especially during the shootout in the apartment.
I:8493;1008;I also very much enjoyed the dialogue between him and John Travolta, especially before the shooting, as they are waiting to enter the apartment.
I:8493;1009;i give this high marks, and hope that others will take the time to watch this wonderful movie.
I:8493;1010;Switched to another movie I enjoyed.
I:8493;1011;The majority of the people I've spoken to about the movie seem to love it, while very few people dislike it.
I:8493;1012;The dialogue in this movie is simply amazing.
I:8493;1013;The acting is outstanding and it is, simply, hilarious.
I:8493;1014;Anyone who claims a movie is the greatest is stupid, because the title of greatest movie is highly subjective, but it is my favorite movie of all time.
I:8493;1015;This is an audacious film with many character, commentary, and situational surprises.
I:8493;1016;Love it, one of my all time favorites from the very first to the last scene, each has something memorable.
I:8493;1017;This is of course the best film ever made.
I:8493;1018;The laserdisc format has plenty of extras.
I:8493;1019;For example it has the tralior and T. v. spots.
I:8493;1020;bender commentary track and a director's cut of the complete film.
I:8493;1021;It is the best movie ever made and gets better each time you watch it.
I:8493;1022;For instance, the gun on Butch's counter didn't belong to Vincent, it belonged to Wallace.
I:8493;1023;The movie also has a comic side to it.
I:8493;1024;I think it's funny how Vincent basically caused everything in the movie.
I:8493;1025;The more you watch it, the more likely you'll have the answers to these questions and more.
I:8493;1026;The actors are great and perfect for thier roles.
I:8493;1027;Any real movie fan will agree with me.
I:8493;1028;this is my favorite and the greatest movie ever made!
I:8493;1029;I popped it in just to take a quick look and of course ended up watching the whole movie, again.
I:8493;1030;Maybe some eventual great actors where in it, but the movie itself is just plotless drugs, violence, and generally the worst our culture has to offer, with the exception of the music was excellent.
I:8493;1031;The thing that appeals to me the most about this movie is the dialogue, it's quotable, memorable, hilarious and even makes you think.
I:8493;1032;I wish Samuel Jackson had won an award for his performance, he deserved it far more than travolta.
I:8493;1033;Samuel carries every scene he's in and is the glue that holds this great movie together.
I:8493;1034;This movie has classic moments if you don't look closely you'll miss, like watch the look on Jules face when Winston Wolf tells jimmy to make him a cup of coffee.
I:8493;1035;Pulp Fiction is one of those legendary movies that you're pretty much required to watch, if you consider yourself a movie buff.
I:8493;1036;"top spectacle in his recent movies, ""Pulp Fiction"" is Quentin Tarantino at his leanest and tightest ."
I:8493;1037;But despite the dark subject matter, it's a deliciously funny movie with a lot of quotable dialogue and endless pop culture references.
I:8493;1038;Yes, this is actually important, so be patient.
I:8493;1039;it's also wildly, wickedly funny.
I:8493;1040;pounders with cheese on their way to kill someone?And yes, the dialogue is absolutely glorious .
I:8493;1041;"Like many Tarantino movies, the characters tend to witter away, but it's surprisingly funny and quotable (""ENGLISH, mother****er!"
I:8493;1042;it's hard to single out a single great performance in this movie, because it either made or revived the careers of pretty much everybody in it.
I:8493;1043;Pulp Fiction is one of THE rare movies that deserves its praise .
I:8493;1044;shaped film overflowing with wit and dark comedy.
I:8493;1045;Honest to God, this is a great film and it's really funny as well.
I:8493;1046;John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are great together in this one.
I:8493;1047;There is a lot of swearing in this one and also some drug ise and it's violent too but other than that, a great film and easily out of all of Taratino's movie, PULP FICTION is one of his best!
I:8493;1048;Also check out RESERVIOR DOGS, DUSK TILL DAWN and for a great laugh from Tarantino, check out FOUR ROOMS!
I:8493;1049;Easily my favorite movie, still can watch it on a regular basis.
I:8493;1050;There are a few things that date the movie but for the most part it's great
I:8493;1051;While this is not in my top ten, it is certainly in the top twenty.
I:8493;1052;Quite a movie, and like most Quentin Tarantino movies, a person can watch it over and over.
I:8493;1053;I think that his movies have a lot of replay value and that is always a good thing.
I:8493;1054;It has comedy,romance,violence,and SAM JACKSON WITH A FRO!
I:8493;1055;Although a bit bloody, this is so well written it's worth the view!
I:8493;1056;Quenten Tarantino really knows how to bring it all together.
I:8493;1057;I can't tell you how many times I have watched this movie and enjoy it each and every time.
I:8493;1058;Tarantino on top of his game.
I:8493;1059;Plot turns, suspense of the gritty L. a. drug scene as seen by the director.
I:8493;1060;It was by far the best film I've ever seen and I will vouch for it under any circumstances.
I:8493;1061;It truly is a genre defying masterpiece.
I:8493;1062;lol that is crazy, but i just love this movie so much.
I:8493;1063;i can watch it a million times.
I:8493;1064;so the extra copy, well thats going to a friend.
I:8493;1065;For those of us who have a truly open mind when it comes to movies and are able to stretch the mind as far as it will go, for those of us who are fans of Tarantino, those of us who love an original film that has alot of violence, humor, and probably the best script in motion picture history PULP FICTION is one of the best, if not THE BEST film of all time.
I:8493;1066;PULP FICTION has got amazingly talented actors who portray their characters with total perfection and they all deliver their lines so cool.
I:8493;1067;I truly thank him for coming up with the idea of PULP FICTION so movie fans like me could have such an amazing piece of celluloid history to view continously, and quote often, and just plain LOVE.
I:8493;1068;Great one of a kind film.
I:8493;1069;Ten goddamn stars, Quentin Tarantino must be pure genius!If you like this movie, you might want to watch True Romance.
I:8493;1070;If you like the out of ordinary movie, hold on to your seat.
I:8493;1071;We bundled several really good movies with a blue.
I:8493;1072;"I have yet to see one film that produced such a feeling as that of ""Pulp Fiction""."
I:8493;1073;Quentin Tarantino is one of, if not the most, brilliant directors of all time.
I:8493;1074;All actors in this became much more popular based on the films gigantic success.
I:8493;1075;That's the greatest thing about him.
I:8493;1076;knows the world and people's thoughts better than anyone else.
I:8493;1077;And the same goes for Jackie Brown, Reservoir Dogs, etc.(also excellent) films I would recommend this movie to anyone, but who is intelligent enough to understand its complex foundation, and, well ok, not offended by strong language or violence (but it is not that bad).
I:8493;1078;This film truly is a masterpiece.
I:8493;1079;It is incredibly written, acted, and moving.
I:8493;1080;Pulp Fiction is my favorite movie of all time, and it will not be soon forgotten as a classic to the worldwide public.
I:8493;1081;I've seen this movie a million times, and everytime I watch it, I laugh, I cringe, I love.
I:8493;1082;Pulp Fiction has mass appeal, which to me is great, but I can't hold it as close to my heart as Dogs, cause it just isn't as gritty.
I:8493;1083;And if there's one thing Tarantino knows, it's grit.
I:8493;1084;This is superb though, and remains one of the best films since it's release.
I:8493;1085;brainer for fans of this film.
I:8493;1086;Wasted 2 and half good hours of my life.
I:8493;1087;First off this is a masterpeice of film and argubaly the best movie to come out in the 90's.
I:8493;1088;and that's for the talent in all honesty.
I:8493;1089;If you like Tarantino films, this one is a good one to own on blu.
I:8493;1090;Great story line with a lot of well.
I:8493;1091;still in wrapper so it was brand new.
I:8493;1092;a must see and its a classic.
I:8493;1093;One of my favorite moves of all time.
I:8493;1094;A classic from the demented mind of Quentin Tarantino.
I:8493;1095;Crazy weave of stories requires you to pay attention but that is easy to do since this one grabs you from the start.
I:8493;1096;Whenever you find yourself laughing at something that you shouldn't find amusing, you know you are watching a good movie.
I:8493;1097;He is incredible as Vincent Vega.
I:8493;1098;Sam Jackson is also hysterical as Jules.
I:8493;1099;Overall this film keeps you wrapped up and interested.
I:8493;1100;Ok, Pulp Fiction was interesting and original.
I:8493;1101;People have said that this is the best movie of the 90's.
I:8493;1102;What am I missing?This movie is made out to be A+, I see it as B. at best.
I:8493;1103;I've seen it more than 20 times and it gets better each time.
I:8493;1104;It will be hard to top.
I:8493;1105;Creative plot layout along with actors such as John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson is what makes Pulp Fiction great.
I:8493;1106;I highly recommend this film to anyone over seventeen.
I:8493;1107;As far as realistic dialogue and gallows humor, this is the greatest film of all time.
I:8493;1108;Even though there are continuity issues (e. g Jules at one point calls a man Brad when his name is Brett), the film is outstanding on all levels.
I:8493;1109;Tarantino is a first rate director and his casting choices are unique and on point.
I:8493;1110;Simply put, it's Tarantino at his best.
I:8493;1111;Seen this movie over and over.
I:8493;1112;If you haven't seen, please do so.
I:8493;1113;It is an instant classic and is a very rewarding watch!
I:8493;1114;Some movies are great because of the acting, some because of the story, some because of the cinematography.
I:8493;1115;This movie is great because of the dialogue, and it's awfully hard to appreciate the dialogue and how it builds up the plot and tension in the movie the first time through.
I:8493;1116;Because of the exchange that he had with Jules (Jackson) about the guy who Marsellus threw out of a four.
I:8493;1117;the dialogue builds on itself and creates the environment which the characters live in.
I:8493;1118;Full of epic quotes, best 2 hours of my life.
I:8493;1119;I watched it two times back to back, it is epic good.
I:8493;1120;So few movies do I absolutely love and this is one of them.
I:8493;1121;Truly this is in my top 5 favorite films.
I:8493;1122;So much is going on, yet one is not lost and that is a feat in itself which shows you how great this movie is.
I:8493;1123;Highly Recommend this movie, especially now that it is offered in this two disc collectors edition for those who have yet to see this film.
I:8493;1124;The film that not only resurrected an aging genre but also put John Travolta back on the map and formally established Samuel L. Jackson as a superstar (who prior to his partaking in the film, was chiefly just another extra), Pulp Fiction, like Quentin Tarantino's earlier hit, Reservoir Dogs, featured some absorbing dialogue by Quentin Tarantino himself and Roger Avary that's frequently off the wall but funny, and stupendous performances by an all.
I:8493;1125;star cast in this memorable melodrama that weaves together three interrelated stories regarding small.
I:8493;1126;But the ones in Pulp Fiction are completely in love with words for their own sake.
I:8493;1127;This is one of the greatest films of all time, and certainly one of the most influential and talked about films of the past 20 years.
I:8493;1128;Extremely interesting movie, not in action but in the story line.
I:8493;1129;The whole movie is about seeing how one person's life affects the life of another.
I:8493;1130;This movie is realistic in terms of drugs (Tarantino did his research).
I:8493;1131;If you want to see a movie with an interesting story line, this is it.
I:8493;1132;I was excited to see that Pulp Fiction made it to Blu.
I:8493;1133;reservoir dogs was creative as well but the rest of his works do not measure up to this.
I:8493;1134;everybody is addicted to the music and style of this classic
I:8493;1135;along with the unique story telling, he took the risk of a non.
I:8493;1136;linear approach, which I'm sure made it very interesting for its time.
I:8493;1137;the whole cast was excellent.
I:8493;1138;And the music was fantastic.
I:8493;1139;Everybody harps about this film being a modern classic and how rapturous they are about Tarantino's work.
I:8493;1140;"They'll look at you as a complete weirdo for not seeing this "" masterpiece "" and will end up telling you the whole thing scene by scene."
I:8493;1141;Crack up, laugh at hilarious it seems.
I:8493;1142;Oh the post modern touch .
I:8493;1143;Oh well, here's to mediocrity with high levels of boasting .
I:8493;1144;gets you far in this world.
I:8493;1145;"A lot of the Pulp"" extras appeared on Criterion's laserdisc, though a few recent interviews are cut in."
I:8493;1146;contest number with Thurman, adding a few moments of music and dance to the delicious scene.
I:8493;1147;Pulp's video transfer takes a while to reveal its finesse, but the images are rich in leather.
I:8493;1148;Starring a cast including John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis, this crime film tells the somewhat inter.
I:8493;1149;Separately, Travolta has a somewhat harrowing outing watching the wife of his boss (Thurman).
I:8493;1150;The eclectic pop culture references were classic along with some of the dialogue.
I:8493;1151;my favorite movie of all!
I:8493;1152;it has everything a classic movie can bring to the screen.
I:8493;1153;travolta, Willis, Sam Jackson, Kietel come on.
I:8493;1154;this film is a cult favorite that gave john travolta a vehicle for a come back.
I:8493;1155;the stories are well written, filmed and acted.
I:8493;1156;Blew me away the first time I saw it, and I still love it.
I:8493;1157;Even if French isn't up your alley, it's still hilarious to watch Samuel L. Jackson give his hell and damnation speech in French!
I:8493;1158;And the frogs LOVE this movie.
I:8493;1159;If you want to say the title in French, it's pronounced, Feek.
I:8493;1160;ray version will eventually look like.
I:8493;1161;no one tells a story as entertainingly and as uniquely in.your.
I:8493;1162;face as Tarantino and this blackest of comedies is for me his very best work.
I:8493;1163;There are many great performances here but surely Jackson's and Travolta's stand out.
I:8493;1164;I also thought Walken's brief contribution was extremely humorous and worthy of honourable mention as well.
I:8493;1165;face vice the ending still seems to suggest good triumphs over evil in the end in true Hollywood fashion.
I:8493;1166;very unique, enjoyable and certainly a classic that should continue to age very well.
I:8493;1167;thank you for your honest opinion of my video.
I:8493;1168;Easily one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:8493;1169;Tarantino directs a masterpiece with an all star cast.
I:8493;1170;I found what I was looking for quick I will order again here!
I:8493;1171;Nice movie starting a new way of filiming.
I:8493;1172;Tarantino does a good job in bringing these individuals together and sewing the fabric of the plot in a way that leaves you exploring all avenues.
I:8493;1173;nice intro to some of the now famous artists.
I:8493;1174;This movie is nothing short of brilliant, i have seen it many times and continue to do so.
I:8493;1175;Quentin Taratino is obviously a very talented film.
I:8493;1176;maker and writer, i hope that one day he will dazzle us with his brilliance again.
I:8493;1177;This movie is definitely in my top picks.
I:8493;1178;I get laughs, trills, chills, and a gimp!
I:8493;1179;This is one movie I can watch over and over again.
I:8493;1180;Wonderful Storytelling, EXCELLENT acting by Samuel L. Jackson, Memorable Lines.
I:8493;1181;I loved it when I saw if for the first time back in 1994 with my then 13.
I:8493;1182;year old son in the theater, and I loved it again when I saw it last weekend on TV.
I:8493;1183;I am fascinated by the incredible pace, witty dialogs, and brilliant writing .
I:8493;1184;Pulp Fiction is a glorious example of the fact that there is no low subject for Art.
I:8493;1185;It is amazing how a work of art can consist of so many trashy elements, which is alluded to in the title of the film.
I:8493;1186;cent paperbacks and by magic of their talents turned them into something fresh, sparkling, clever, funny and incredibly enjoyable.
I:8493;1187;And last but not least .
I:8493;1188;how well Tarantino works with his actors, in this film everybody shines.
I:8493;1189;For me, it is a perfect film and a true source of joy, one that I've experienced dozens of times and am always ready for again.
I:8493;1190;For him, the toys are the old movies that he adores and he brings his love and admiration of these films to his own work.
I:8493;1191;"He is not greedy
I:8493;1192;Tarantino does not make profound statements or ask eternal questions, but what he does do is entertain, and he does it marvelously .
I:8493;1193;with style, class, irony, wit, and talent.
I:8493;1194;When I am in the presence of a great work of art I know the feeling, and Tarantino's film is a great work of art that happened to be very enjoyable.
I:8493;1195;"Like any time of day is a good time for blueberry pie, any time of day and any day of the week is a good time to watch and enjoy ""Pulp Fiction""."
I:8493;1196;Even thought Reservoir Dogs got him noticed in the States, it was this film that really made everyone see that a genius story writer and director had been born.
I:8493;1197;Always paying homage to the kinds of films he grew up with, Quentin comes through with Pulp Fiction.
I:8493;1198;A brilliant story about two worn out hit men that are basically tired of their jobs, at least one of them is.
I:8493;1199;story of the Boxer who has a bounty on his head for not throwing the fight is equally as interesting of a story.
I:8493;1200;the list goes on about how many great actors and actresses are in this film.
I:8493;1201;If the characters aren't believable, the movie is a bust and not good, but each did a great job at fitting their roles perfectly.
I:8493;1202;The acting added a lot to the well written story.
I:8493;1203;"This film is so great
I:8493;1204;You will love this movie if you haven't seen it already.
I:8493;1205;It's definitely one of the best films to come out of the 90's.
I:8493;1206;The pulps I'm familiar with were well written.
I:8493;1207;First of all, I viewed this film primarily because it was a 1998 American Film Institue Top 100 Movies of all Time winner.
I:8493;1208;Uma Thurman is alluring as Marcellus' girlfriend.
I:8493;1209;Hard to believe, then, that this film was nominated for best screenplay at the Oscars!
I:8493;1210;I give it three stars, because the vignettes were cleverly arranged, and some of the stories were interesting.
I:8493;1211;A classic worthy of inception in A. f. i.'s Top 100 list?
I:8493;1212;A more worthy candidate would have been The Shawshank Redemption.
I:8493;1213;Quentin Tarantino masterful roller coaster ride of a movie you never know where it will go nextwell written grate acting all the way around!!
I:8493;1214;"Tarrantino's style in unmistakable and the ""out of sequence"" framing of his early work like ""Reservoir dogs"" (another great movie), is taken to NEW heights."
I:8493;1215;This movie is a roller coaster with great acting, dialogue and visuals.
I:8493;1216;Always interesting and provocative and fun.
I:8493;1217;Tarantino demonstrates his love and appreciation of ALL things '70s.
I:8493;1218;"His latest ""Django"" is excellent too)"
I:8493;1219;taking seem cool, and there are scenes of sado.
I:8493;1220;abiding cop is seen in the film .
I:8493;1221;that said, there is intense, visceral drama in many of the scenes, it's nicely edited, there are some great speeches, and much of the music fits in superbly.
I:8493;1222;it's understandable why the film is so loved and it is also understandable why it is so disliked by others.
I:8493;1223;Not only that but it is somewhat a tribute to older films and an example of export photography.
I:8493;1224;The images are all seen in the imagination, and the imagination can show far more violent images that what any film can.
I:8493;1225;Two of the men are caught at a crossroad in there life and the other meets his end.
I:8493;1226;He rides a motorcycle (or chopper) back to his loved one.
I:8493;1227;On the chopper it says grace, meaning the grace of God that delivers him from evil.
I:8493;1228;The movie was actually pretty good but i expected more from the reviews i had heard.
I:8493;1229;It had an all star cast that included John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Christopher Walken, Ving Rhames, and Quentin Tarantino himself.
I:8493;1230;I thought that the dialogue for the movie was outstanding.
I:8493;1231;But overall the movie was pretty good, and you should see it but leave the kids with the babysitter.
I:8493;1232;He always cameos in his films .
I:8493;1233;Yet the bulk of the actors he chooses to deliver these sermons are so charismatic and talented that you're still thoroughly entertained while waiting for a point, if indeed one exists.
I:8493;1234;And when that point invariably emerges it's full of unmistakable insight and humour, which makes it all worthwhile.
I:8493;1235;O. k this movie was a good movie don't get me wrong, basically its about Hitmen and various other people that meet there fates over a few days.
I:8493;1236;the movie is old and has many great actors and actresses two of my favorite parts were with the marvin, and what does marcelous wallice look like lol
I:8493;1237;I'ts a good movie, I was confused when I saw it back in 94, cause I was 11, but even then, I liked the movie, and I like it even more now.
I:8493;1238;Anyway, this isn't really a review, just telling those people that come here and give this movie one star, don't bother sharing your disgust with us, the majority of us loved the movie, and there's really nothing you can do to stop smart shoppers, movie collecters, etc., from getting the film.
I:8493;1239;The brilliant dialogue has become legendary, the elliptical structure of the script has been much imitated and will continue to do so.
I:8493;1240;The fantastic group of actors, who range from has.
I:8493;1241;beens (at the time) to cult favourites, are all uniformly excellent, and the soundtrack is one of the coolest and most eclectic ever assembled.
I:8493;1242;In short, this is a modern classic, and required viewing for all movie fans.
I:8493;1243;'Pulp Fiction' is as good as any movie you care to name.
I:8493;1244;This is one heck of a good movie.
I:8493;1245;This movie had me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end.
I:8493;1246;I thought that this movie was unlike any other that I have seen.
I:8493;1247;It surprised me, fascinated me, and really did a lot to entertain me.
I:8493;1248;rich version some time later.
I:8493;1249;The fascinating thing about all the adulation this movie receives, and its endless comparisons to great movies of the past, is that none of the critics / reviewers ever talk about the meaning of the movie!
I:8493;1250;This is one movie that I can watch numerous times and enjoy it.
I:8493;1251;That is one indicator of how powerful this movie is.
I:8493;1252;Great movie and better price.
I:8493;1253;This is a cult classic.
I:8493;1254;I finally saw this movie for the first time last night and, wow.
I:8493;1255;if you think about it, it's a dark comedy, but also a drama, and also an action, but also an epic.
I:8493;1256;It's funny in a twisted way and uses what hit men talk about before they kill to stir up laughs.
I:8493;1257;The soundtrack is explosive as almost all surf guitar.
I:8493;1258;most of it is presented comical.
I:8493;1259;If you love the movie, get the Collector's Edition because it really is very cool.
I:8493;1260;So many memorable scenes in the movie, no wonder why it's on AFI's top 100 greatest movies ever made list.
I:8493;1261;This movie, without a doubt, is one of the best movies to ever grace the silver screen.
I:8493;1262;his boss's (a brilliant Ving Rhames) wife (Uma Thurman).
I:8493;1263;The dialog between these two characters is truly amazing, especially at the dinner table.
I:8493;1264;This act is an emotional releif from the previous two, while still staying sharp.
I:8493;1265;if you havent seen this movie, please do, as you will see a remarkable film.
I:8493;1266;this award winning film is truly a masterpeice in every sense of the word, so do yourself a favor and if you have not, see it.
I:8493;1267;We think this movie is hilarious and now we can enjoy it whenever we want and not have to wait until someone schedules it and if may be on the same time as something else we want to watch.
I:8493;1268;Of all my movies this is my favorite.
I:8493;1269;part of my feeling comes from the strong performances of the entire cast, part from the slick editing, butperhaps mostly from the redemption of the character played by Samuel L. Jackson.
I:8493;1270;I can only say that ofall the movies I've seen flashes of this one pop up in my mind from time to time more than any other movie.
I:8493;1271;This is truly one of the best films to come out of the decade.
I:8493;1272;The performances are all magnificent.
I:8493;1273;But the real reason this film is so well liked and critically appreciated has to be because of the incredible dialogue.
I:8493;1274;It is truly one of the best and most daring scrips in contemporary American movie history.
I:8493;1275;The screenplay certainly deserved the Academy Award, and is itself well worth purchasing.
I:8493;1276;An all around fantastic film which seems to get better the more often it is viewed.
I:8493;1277;I give it one star for Samuel L. Jacksons amusing performance, another for being audacious.
I:8493;1278;i like to be entertained.
I:8493;1279;In my opinion this is a classic movie from the 90's but for an adult audience of course.
I:8493;1280;This is Quentin Tarantino's best movie.
I:8493;1281;Every scene is thought out so well.
I:8493;1282;Breakfast scene is my favorite.
I:8493;1283;this is a great film featuring a cool cast that'sdefinitely one of Tarantino's best.
I:8493;1284;Watched it again after all these years.
I:8493;1285;A whole new generation needs to see it and appreciate it!
I:8493;1286;Kevin Smith said that it is important to make a distinction between Pulp Fiction the PHENOMENON, and Pulp Fiction, the actual film.
I:8493;1287;Smith's point is very well taken.
I:8493;1288;When it was released, myself (and every human in existence) was told that it was, indeed, one of the greatest artistic works to ever be committed to celluloid.
I:8493;1289;Keitel's scene treats his character like a genius, this brilliant fix it man.
I:8493;1290;NOT the most amazing thing I've ever heard.
I:8493;1291;It's been done before, and much better, in Kubrick's The Killing, Clint Eastwood's Bird, and, in the best example, Leone's magnificent Once Upon a Time in America (the uncut version).
I:8493;1292;So, overall, a decent film, but a much overhyped one.
I:8493;1293;"The 90's was the decade of ""hype"" (to quote the name of a documentary on the grunge music scene), and they hyped many films as well, and this is the greatest example of that."
I:8493;1294;If you wish to see Tarantino's best film, watch Reservoir Dogs.
I:8493;1295;That is a better film than this one (even though that's a shallow film as well).
I:8493;1296;Simply put, this movie is one of the best of our generation.
I:8493;1297;Samuel L. Jackson gives, in my opinion, the best performance of the movie, followed closely by Travolta.
I:8493;1298;Every now and again a film comes along that changes the way we as people look at movies.
I:8493;1299;It is a visceral experience that is part exploitation film and part noir epic.
I:8493;1300;Upon its release it managed to accomplish its success almost completely by word of mouth.
I:8493;1301;with an all star cast (John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman), this movie grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go.
I:8493;1302;It is a great movie that, on an $8 million budget, made Tarantino a household name.
I:8493;1303;pulp Fiction packs so much energy and invention into telling its interwoven short stories (all about temptation, corruption, and redemption amongst modern criminals, large and small) it leaves viewers wanting more.
I:8493;1304;Love the theme, great class of characters.
I:8493;1305;The storyline takes a strange but funny directions.
I:8493;1306;Third, the drugs, sex, and general evil happenings throughout the film.
I:8493;1307;that said, having seen this movie at a young age, those were all the things I loved about it.
I:8493;1308;"But now that I'm older and have gotten past the giggling stage of hearing the ""F"" word 281 times, I respect the deep story, the character interaction, and the cinematography."
I:8493;1309;Everything meshes together beautifully in the end, and it is a truly classic movie.
I:8493;1310;A timeless movie that cannot be any more perfect.
I:8493;1311;Really sets the difference between movies with a good script and acting from movies that exploit ephemeral modern technological advances.
I:8493;1312;A nice exercise in film making, perfect acting by Samuel Jackson (he deserves an Oscar), Harvey Keitel, Bruce Willis and John Travolta, some funny dialogues from Tarantino, a lot of violence, and that's it.
I:8493;1313;The best scene is the last, it has some redeeming values, and succeeds to save not only the character, but the film itself.
I:8493;1314;One of the best cult thriller i have ever seen.
I:8493;1315;One of the best cast i have ever seen.
I:8493;1316;One of the best director i have ever seen.
I:8493;1317;director Quentin Tarantino revisits the seedier side of Los Angeles.
I:8493;1318;with this funny, violent, tongue.
I:8493;1319;cheek tribute to the less classic side of filmmaking.
I:8493;1320;The first story focuses on Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), two hit men on duty for the big boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), whose gorgeous wife, Mia (Uma Thurman), takes a liking to Vincent.
I:8493;1321;tarantino wears his cinematic influences proudly, bringing them to life in the ironically hip, self.
I:8493;1322;The result is a work that changed the face of independent cinema forever, making it a legitimate player in the Hollywood mainstream.
I:8493;1323;star cast steps into their roles with obvious glee, and Tarantino once again uses his soundtrack to up the cool ante yet another notch, making for a motion picture event that has worked its way into our national vernacular.
I:8493;1324;This movie is a joy from start to finish and established Quentin Tarantino as the modern Orson Wells of independent film.
I:8493;1325;Right from it start of the first few minutes of this movie we know we have stumbled on to something new.
I:8493;1326;And for a moment let's talk about the violence.
I:8493;1327;the two main characters are Vincent (played by John Travolta) and Jules (played by Samuel L. Jackson) who are witty wisecracking cold hearted hit men.
I:8493;1328;The witty lines, the playful banter between characters and the absurd (albeit sometimes horrific) situations in this movie really give it its charm and the nonstop action give it all of the excitement of a roller.
I:8493;1329;there is an incredibly meticulous attention to detail in this movie and this really stands out in the sets and the soundtrack.
I:8493;1330;This movie was obviously a labor of love and if you can get over the violence and obscenities you will see the movie as being joyous in an odd sort of way.
I:8493;1331;It is definitely a movie you want to own as every time you see it you will see something new.
I:8493;1332;As a movie buff Tarantino has assimilated all that he has learned from his favorite movies and added some new twists.
I:8493;1333;This movie could very well be the best movie ever made to date.
I:8493;1334;Samuel L. Jackson's character, Jules Winnfield, is probably one of the best character's ever in a movie.
I:8493;1335;His dialect is incredible, and Ezekiel 25: 17 is a great great quote.
I:8493;1336;John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames ignite the screen in this action.
I:8493;1337;John Travolta proves he's still got the moves in a dance scene with Uma Thurman.
I:8493;1338;He should act more in his own movies.
I:8493;1339;One of the most famous movies of the 1990's, Pulp Fiction is a graphic, crowd.
I:8493;1340;pleasing, shocking and awesome crime drama that boasts more astonishing ideas than any movie I can remember for the 1990.1995 period.
I:8493;1341;This is, quite simply, a masterpiece with poignancy, comedy and sheer brilliance packed into one big, explosive movie that we'll never forget.
I:8493;1342;Not only one of the best films of 1990's, Pulp Fiction also gives us one of the most ensemble casts in a film ever.
I:8493;1343;All of them give great performances and all are amazing actors!
I:8493;1344;Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary breathtaking, descriptive and unexplainably excellent screen.
I:8493;1345;The script is so good it'll knock your socks off.
I:8493;1346;Quentin's direction is also very worthy of praise, he dares to go the next step in filmmaking and wins the audience over.
I:8493;1347;hearted and children to keep way away from this movie.
I:8493;1348;life, then see this now!
I:8493;1349;I wanted to share the experience so we watched it from our hotel room in London.
I:8493;1350;It's a really fun rollercoaster ride that suffers only in it's delivery vehicle.
I:8493;1351;Loved the definition of divine intervention and I highly acclaim Tarantino's style of dialogue and conversation flow he adds to films making you forget you are watching a film like nooone else does.
I:8493;1352;one of the best films I've had a privilege of seeing.
I:8493;1353;For me it is Ving Rhames soul.
I:8493;1354;The first shot in the movie of Rhames is a back shot of his head with a band.
I:8493;1355;I tell friends of my interpretations and they think I'm a crackpot, but I firmly believe Tarantino has put these subliminal religious messages in his film.
I:8493;1356;classic masterpiece that demands repeated viewings!
I:8493;1357;One of the best and most favorite movie ever.
I:8493;1358;"Not many works go further towards closing the putative gap between a film and a movie than Pulp Fiction
I:8493;1359;In short, a piece of cinema appealing to both the megaplex crowd and megalomaniac critics alike.
I:8493;1360;"what remains is essentially a ""cool"" flick."
I:8493;1361;What was raved as cool and interesting in 1994.
I:8493;1362;in essence, an enjoyment of this movie depends very much on one's frame of mind, and one's expectation of it: if the viewer expects to see innovative filmmaking so beloved by critics back then, he would probably be disappointed.
I:8493;1363;If the viewer deigns to sit back and simply enjoy an entertaining escapist treat for the weekend, he is in for a helluva ride.
I:8493;1364;This movie is just perfect from A to Z.
I:8493;1365;The dialogs are incredible and Travolta is an amazing actor in there!
I:8493;1366;Funny and violent movie, best Tarantino ever
I:8493;1367;this movie has to be one of the best all time classics.
I:8493;1368;Though I always loved the movie, this version brought to life the full effect of the film.
I:8493;1369;This supremely artistic vehicle designed obviously to showcase the many sides of Samuel L. Jackson's multidimensional talents, is a cinema.
I:8493;1370;graphic triumph of a very high order.
I:8493;1371;tarrintino has done it again: pulled off the impossible and the surreal and made it seem so imminently possible and real: This movie, more than any other, is truly a new metaphor of our hectic times.
I:8493;1372;As is true with all of his work, the technical aspects of Tarrintino's work are so carefully worked out and put in place .
I:8493;1373;the utter cleverness and darkness of the subtext, the casting, the scenery, the character development, the script, the writing, the directing, the brutal artistic honesty .
I:8493;1374;"His art, as is the case with any truly good art, is above critique:""It just ""IS."""
I:8493;1375;Altogether the movie (or the book) shouldn't work, but the script and the writing are handled with such exquisite aesthetic balance and sensitivity that not only do they work, but in doing so, the movie sets a new standard of cinema.
I:8493;1376;"graphic possibilities: It is an aesthetic feast well ahead of its times
I:8493;1377;It was especially an unexpected hit in Japan and Europe.
I:8493;1378;It is like a basketball team that wins the NCAA championship: It could not have been pulled off without all of the characters playing their respective parts and doing so at the highest level of their art.
I:8493;1379;This movie is fantastic in all aspects.
I:8493;1380;I've watched it so many times since I've bought it that it's unreal.
I:8493;1381;One of Tarantino's best works.
I:8493;1382;This is a damn good movie!
I:8493;1383;Excuse me while I go watch this masterpiece again!
I:8493;1384;This giant film will remain in the memory as one the ten best films of this decade.
I:8493;1385;The astonishing and frenetic rhythm shake hands with an original approach of the underworld in Los Angeles told with cynicism, tension, humor and extreme violence.
I:8493;1386;A true universe of dissipated and out of their minds characters will constitute a true portrayal of a real social kaleidoscope or human puzzle if you want.
I:8493;1387;the hyper kinetic and the breathtaking dynamic of this movie make of it an obligated reference at the moment to consider the attitude in Cannes respect Hollywood where the Film was a winner.
I:8493;1388;The film shot the career of three actors: the lovable and attractive Uma Thurman, John Travolta and Samuel Jackson.
I:8493;1389;Travolta and Thurman are great actors.
I:8493;1390;All the acting is BRILLIANT, but, I think, especially JOHN TRAVOLTA (he excels in everything he does) and SAMUEL L JACKSON (always stellar).
I:8493;1391;Maybe, her best performance ever.
I:8493;1392;Mostly it's just a day in the life.
I:8493;1393;Plus, the sound tract is great.
I:8493;1394;i have the two disk set, and there are all kinds of good stuff on it.
I:8493;1395;One of the best movies ever made in my opinion.
I:8493;1396;great cast and great script.
I:8493;1397;have recommend this kinda unknown movie to everyone I know,everyone seems to love it.
I:8493;1398;This is, simply put, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.
I:8493;1399;The dialogue is masterful, it is shockingly funny and intense, and all of the actors shine through wonderfully.
I:8493;1400;John Travolta is superb in his role as Vincent.
I:8493;1401;One of my favorite movies of all time, I think everyone needs to see this.
I:8493;1402;Beautifully written script and the plot development is perfect.
I:8493;1403;One of the few movies I can honestly watch multiple times and still enjoy it.
I:8493;1404;Tarantino tears up the screen with his violence!There's comedy, violence, suspense and dramaall rolled up into this one!
I:8493;1405;The deal with the car is Hollywood at its best.
I:8493;1406;The greatest movie ever to be released.
I:8493;1407;I still find fantastic things, that's just great.
I:8493;1408;The script is also incredible in it's way.
I:8493;1409;So don't judge PF after the first time you enjoy it.
I:8493;1410;a very good movie too.
I:8493;1411;Well that's all I have to say about that.
I:8493;1412;The Citizen Kane of our time has got to be Pulp Fiction because it's simply amazing!
I:8493;1413;I guess you could also say it's the All About Eve of our time because it's so well written.
I:8493;1414;pulp Fiction is fresh and original, and the dialogue is delicious.
I:8493;1415;aside from Pulp Fiction's dialogue, the story is moved along by its actors.
I:8493;1416;Also, check out Uma Thurman's breakthrough performance as the sexy wife of a hit man who reveals to have a serious (and we mean SERIOUS) drug addiction.You must see Pulp Fiction.
I:8493;1417;it's the stuff dreams are made of!
I:8493;1418;in this installment to his array of unique cinematic masterpieces, Quentin Tarantino delivers a stylized non.
I:8493;1419;"it's well written, the cinematography is great, the soundtrack is perfectly fitted to the movieand to top it off, the whole fiasco is 100% original
I:8493;1420;this movie made it clear why Tarantino has his own genre, and in all honesty, this is one of the greatest movies i've ever seen.
I:8493;1421;the bottom line this time around is a 95%.
I:8493;1422;A sheer definition of good filmmaking, Pulp Fiction redefined boththe noir genre and the movie genre as a whole, and in turn is a heavily inspirational fiasco that triumphs on all levels.
I:8493;1423;People like me take notice and want to share their opinion,besides, it's what all the cool kids are doing.
I:8493;1424;I mean granted, a lump sum of the Tarantino universe is prominent in this film, and if you'reeither a Tarantino fan, or just someone who likes good writing, you'll probably enjoy this movie.
I:8493;1425;The scripts ride along like a rollercoaster and are complimented by the rich and compelling performances from an excellent cast which stars John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson, Bruce Willis, Harvey Kietel and Uma Thurman amongst many others.
I:8493;1426;This was something remarkable considering Tarantino was still vastly learning his trade.
I:8493;1427;His deep, genius talents come into full force in this astonishing, diverse, imaginitive movie that boasts an equally sizzling soundtrack.
I:8493;1428;The high calibre writing is astounding as are particularly the revitalised John Travolta and the then largely unknown Samuel L. Jackson.
I:8493;1429;The film went onto win oscars for Tarantino and his co. writer Roger Avary.
I:8493;1430;Exhilirating stuff and one of the best and important films made in the 1990's.
I:8493;1431;One of the greatest movies of all time(I'm sure you got sick and tired of hearing this all the time!)
I:8493;1432;i think it's the best dialogue since GoodFellas.
I:8493;1433;the dialogue's got everything:humor,intensity,wise cracks and everything you'd enjoy to hear and repeat all day long.
I:8493;1434;*Reserructing the careers of Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta.
I:8493;1435;*Harvey Keitel's scenes were some of the best parts in the film.
I:8493;1436;Bought it for my 22 year old son.
I:8493;1437;This Quentin Tarantino classic has become the blue print for so many other movies out there.
I:8493;1438;This collector's edition is great.
I:8493;1439;Many bonus features and anamorphic widescreen.
I:8493;1440;All the witty lines, the suspense, the dark humor, character development, violence/balsy threats, etc.
I:8493;1441;Great movie a true classic.
I:8493;1442;i enjoyed the action and the star filled actors characters which made this movie a must see.
I:8493;1443;those are are the best words I could think of to describe Mr. Tarantino, ditto this overrated, overpraised, and overhyped dung heap of a film.
I:8493;1444;This is one of my favorite all time movies and I could not resist having it in blu.
I:8493;1445;I loved everything about this movie.
I:8493;1446;quentin Tarantino has such a unique style.You don't even have to understand the movie to like it.
I:8493;1447;I do not deny that this much lauded Quentin Tarantino film set in a violent underworld is enjoyable.
I:8493;1448;There is snappy dialogue, interesting characters .
I:8493;1449;intelligent banter between the film's various characters .
I:8493;1450;hand store and even an excellent cameo from Tarantino himself as Samuel L. Jackson's testy friend who doesn't want his wife to find out about his underworld connections.
I:8493;1451;This is a testament to Tarantino's ability to create an enjoyable film experience for the viewer.
I:8493;1452;loved it its a really good movie it came with the movie and extras its also really good for the price and hard to find anywhere elswe
I:8493;1453;The movie is one of my favourites.
I:8493;1454;there is definitely a booklet in it.
I:8493;1455;This movie has a great well written story, interesting characters, and is just fun to watch.
I:8493;1456;This may be tarantinos best film.
I:8493;1457;Pulp Fiction is by far one of the single best movies I have ever seen in movie history.
I:8493;1458;I say that because of the amount of great actors in it and supporting actors for the storylines.
I:8493;1459;The scrpit is also very good and important to the movie.
I:8493;1460;"Their are mutiple lines in the movie that I personally enjoy, ""Personality goes a long way"" the religious passage Jackson keeps repeating threwout the movie."
I:8493;1461;But just watch the movie and see for yourself how much you enjoy the movie QT wrote and directed.
I:8493;1462;Pulp Fiction has to be one my favorite movies of all time.
I:8493;1463;and best of all, it's a great movie.
I:8493;1464;It's a little over the top with the language and violence, but it's done in a very entertaining way.
I:8493;1465;I have watched all of Quentin Tarantino's movies and this one still remains my favorite.
I:8493;1466;It's just a really good movie.
I:8493;1467;Two hit men have a simple job.
I:8493;1468;A mix up with a boxer.
I:8493;1469;Written and directed in 1994 by the peculiar genius Quentin Tarantino, evolved the best screenplay Pulp Fiction.
I:8493;1470;this movie stars actors such as Samuel L. Jackson who play Jules Winnfield, a strong religious hit.
I:8493;1471;Vince is also a hit.
I:8493;1472;the second side to the story is the boxer Butch played by Bruce Willis.
I:8493;1473;A strong man with much anger built up inside.
I:8493;1474;finally, the story of the happy couple of bandits, Ringo/Pumpkin played by Tim Roth and Yolanda/Hunny Bunny played by Amanda Plummer.
I:8493;1475;"some fun facts nn the movie: the part when Jules recites Ezekiel 25:17, the part about the righteous man and the shepherd were actually not in the bible
I:8493;1476;tarantino was inspired to write this movie because he thought it would be cool to make a movie with multiple stories and combining them together.
I:8493;1477;Tarantino got these ideas from magazines such as Black Mask.
I:8493;1478;genre that has luric subjects and is usually on a magazine of some sort.
I:8493;1479;At the end it all comes together to make a spectacular movie.
I:8493;1480;This movie is one of my favorites.
I:8493;1481;Because it is both a great movie and a cult hit.
I:8493;1482;It is a must see for and film buff.
I:8493;1483;Probably one of my personal favorite films, Pulp Fiction is a film that feels very trashy.
I:8493;1484;There is a common misconception that Tarantino is a action film director, and this couldn't be farther from the truth.
I:8493;1485;Tarantino's films are driven by dialog, and his flair as a writer is demonstrated in Pulp Fiction.
I:8493;1486;The characters interact realistically, and as always his dialog is spot on for its setting.
I:8493;1487;Tarantino is a master of his craft and is really spot on in his film making.
I:8493;1488;Pulp Fiction is hands down his masterpiece, and deserves its place in history for its unique style, pulpy setting, and amazing dialog.
I:8493;1489;This is, put simply, one of the most entertaining films of the last decade or so.
I:8493;1490;picked soundtrack, PF succeeds in captivating one for the better part of two and a half hours.
I:8493;1491;At any rate, what impresses me most about this film is, as mentioned earlier, it's entertainment quotient.
I:8493;1492;It's all very well for analytical.
I:8493;1493;but the upshot is that this is, in its own right, an immensely watchable film that played an important role in rejuvenating the medium in the mid.90s.
I:8493;1494;possibly one of quentin tarrantino's best films with great performances from John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis and Tim Roth in this sleak stylish film whcvih was cleverly three stories iterconnecting into one main story with one very squimish scene scene of a heroin injection the film got a bit of a rep along with the great performances, the soundtrack was the icing on the cake with performaces from Dusty Springfield, Chuck Berry, Al Green.
I:8493;1495;pulp Fiction won the 1994 cannes film festival award.
I:8493;1496;the start of this film is great, 2 normal guys riding in a car having a normal convosation, about cheese burgers.
I:8493;1497;I absolutely adore this film
I:8493;1498;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8493;1499;Tarantino is a master of non.
I:8493;1500;linear storylines, and brings a unique style to his directing.
I:8493;1501;Please, continue, you were saying something about best intentions.
I:8493;1502;Pulp Fiction is now a classic.
I:8493;1503;It is the most satisfying of Tarrantino's movies as he artfully weaves together a compelling set of stories into a riveting film.
I:8493;1504;This film also saw the welcome return of John Travolta as a very hip hitman.
I:8493;1505;The Watch was a wonderful piece, woven seamlessly into Bruce Willis' memorable role as the boxer.
I:8493;1506;It brings together a great ensemble of actors playing their roles to the hilt.
I:8493;1507;Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as the Ecclesiastics.
I:8493;1508;He ties all his stories together with a keen eye for social commentary.
I:8493;1509;I took another look at this film after watching Tarantino's recent tour de force Kill Bill .
I:8493;1510;"Must has been said about Pulp Fiction, from being a violent bloodfest to a spiritual journey
I:8493;1511;These stories are intertwined effectively and effortlessly, the seems between them are negligible, so when one character from another story suddenly pops up in another one, its understandable.
I:8493;1512;Clearly, he's at the forefront of this movie, from its look and style.
I:8493;1513;First, the sharp script, dialogue heavy, is extremely well written.
I:8493;1514;Tarantino manages to build suspense and tension, in order for us to think it's more violent than it is.
I:8493;1515;From the stylistic 50's diner atmosphere, to the oddly weird and normal twist contest Mia and Vincent enter, it's brilliant from start to finish.
I:8493;1516;pulp Fiction is a cinematic feast from beginning to end.
I:8493;1517;i ordered five movies , all classics and they arrived on time and intact .
I:8493;1518;they were a gift to my dear brother and he loves them .
I:8493;1519;Can't get much better, one of the best movies I've seen.
I:8493;1520;It has it all, action, humor, suspense, mystery, a novel approach to movies.
I:8493;1521;The plotting is great, the violence over the top but understandable and leavened by a wry sense of humor.
I:8493;1522;I could watch it again and really enjoy it again.
I:8493;1523;Bought this movie for my friend and he loves it.
I:8493;1524;It is one of his all time favorite movies!!!
I:8493;1525;I will recommend this blue ray to anyone.
I:8493;1526;If you haven't seen Pulp Fiction, please do me and the rest of the world a favor and watch it.
I:8493;1527;It's one of the greatest movies ever created.
I:8493;1528;*definitely pick up the collector's edition if you are a tarantino fan.
I:8493;1529;bonus materials include heavy dosages of tarantino, including his palm d'or acceptance film (won best picture at cannes film festival) and explanations regarding the film's deleted scenes*this movie is brilliant not only because of the way in which it was put together (intertwining events, etc.) but because it is a splendid balance of comedy, drama, action, wit, satire, and is a throught.
I:8493;1530;The 1990's was a huge year for Writer, Director, Producer and Actor Quentin Tarintino.
I:8493;1531;"In 1992 he released his first major hit ""Reservoir Dogs"", in 1994 he released his Oscar winning ""Pulp Fiction"" and in 1997 he released the hit ""Jackie Brown""."
I:8493;1532;"But his greatest accomplishment had to be ""Pulp Fiction""."
I:8493;1533;"With jaw chewing dialouge, a dynamic cast and great directing, Pulp Fiction has deserved its ""just rewards""."
I:8493;1534;men (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson), a last chance prize fighter (Bruce Willis) and a loving couple of robbers (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer).
I:8493;1535;This film has such notable sayings as .
I:8493;1536;The first time I saw this film I was wondering how in the world could this be nominated for any Academy Award, but the film grows on you, and you really realize that this film is extremely humorous.
I:8493;1537;the action is superb, and the performance of Samuel L. Jackson is absolutely the best of his career.
I:8493;1538;a film lead with a brilliant writer/director (Quentin Tarintino) and an ALLSTAR cast, with such names as John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Amanda Plummer, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Kathy Griffin, and Phil Lamar!You really cant afford to miss this cinematic masterpiece!
I:8493;1539;With a lot of action, humor, drama, and just plain out a great movie going experience!
I:8493;1540;This film is an absolute thrill ride that dont stop till the credits roll!
I:8493;1541;One of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8493;1542;I watch it over and over ,its conseder a good move to watch, john travoltas at his best ,I think.
I:8493;1543;This is truly a fun movie .
I:8493;1544;because if you know all of the story it really does take away from the experience .
I:8493;1545;What a treat and a wild ride.
I:8493;1546;comes one of the greatest movies of are time.
I:8493;1547;Part of a three part series from Quentin Tarantino (also featuring Reservoir Dogs, and the unmade Vega Brothers which would feature Vincent Vega played by John Travolta and Vic Vega played by Michael Madsen) this is my second favorite movie of all time.
I:8493;1548;Many of you have read the review of this tangled movie, now I will untangle this movie for you.
I:8493;1549;After a few minutes of excellent dialogue they finally enter the apartment of the punks.
I:8493;1550;The date is one of the big scenes of the movie it's here we get to see John Travolta's dance steps and Uma Thurman OD on coke, as well as appearances by Buddy Holly, Ed Sullivan, and Marilyn Monroe.
I:8493;1551;This is a very spectacular movie that I think everyone should watch at least once.
I:8493;1552;This film is talked about so much because it's one of the best movies of my lifetime.
I:8493;1553;i put this movie in my top 5 great movies.
I:8493;1554;if you like to follow a group story this is it.
I:8493;1555;What makes this such a fine film?
I:8493;1556;I really loved this movie.
I:8493;1557;Because Tarantino knows what he's doing.
I:8493;1558;This edition gives an indepth look at all of the makings and the artistic beauty that is the Quentin Tarantino masterpiece.
I:8493;1559;the music is a bonus, a little overplayed these days on the radio but at the time of the movie release, it fresh as a daisy.
I:8493;1560;Incredible cast, all giving great performances.
I:8493;1561;This is a classic and it's amazing
I:8493;1562;Part of that is manipulation.
I:8493;1563;Anybody who has seen Quentin Tarantino in Sleep with Me knows what I am talking about.
I:8493;1564;Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta are the central characters, a couple of hit men who make their murderous way through life until something amazing happens that separates them.
I:8493;1565;They disagree as to the event's nature, one taking it as a miracle, the other as an accident.
I:8493;1566;This leaves in it's wake several small acts of redemption and reconciliation.
I:8493;1567;The story is a complex intertwining adventure which will leave you thinking about it and trying to unravel it in your mind.
I:8493;1568;There is genuine camaraderie, honor and restraint between the most death.
I:8493;1569;My son is an avid reader and enjoys watching a variety of old and new movies.
I:8493;1570;This movie is so realistic that rather than watch it, a person could live it, having a normal conversation or dancing with someone's girlfriend like Travolta and Uma.
I:8493;1571;It does have its funny moments with in your face humor, but otherwise there are four parts of a legitimate movie rather than you talking with your friends.
I:8493;1572;Watched it again for the 4th or 5th time and still love it.
I:8493;1573;The dialogue is great, the pacing fantastic and Tarantino figured out to weave the various stories together somehow.
I:8493;1574;liners, more over the top characters or fabulous characters.
I:8493;1575;adrenaline's a b. wow, why do I have to type so many fing 'characters'.
I:8493;1576;When I watched it a second time, a lot of things fell into place and I really thought it was a brilliant movie.
I:8493;1577;What makes this movie unique is the sequence the story is presented.
I:8493;1578;for what I would call a low budget flick, the acting in the movie is phenomenal by most of the actors.
I:8493;1579;Travolta and Jackson give an exceptional performance playing the two gangland enforcers.
I:8493;1580;Ving Rhames does a great job in his short role as the hard.
I:8493;1581;Quentin Tarantino also gives a stellar performance as the high.
I:8493;1582;all in all, I found the movie to be quite genius with a touch of insanity, a mix that Quentin Tarantino seems to have perfected.
I:8493;1583;This was a rare movie that seems to be better the second time it is watched.
I:8493;1584;If you are into violent movies with plots such as Goodfellas, The Last Boyscout, or Face Off, this is probably a movie that you would enjoy.
I:8493;1585;Quentin Tarantino really did an excellent job with this film.
I:8493;1586;The way that the plotline unfolds really makes the movie, it was done in such a creative way.
I:8493;1587;It was really enjoyable for me.
I:8493;1588;With its stylish attitude, Pulp Fiction was the movie of the nineties.
I:8493;1589;It uses the characters in such ways to intrigue the viewer into watching it.
I:8493;1590;A brilliant, captivating film from start to finish.
I:8493;1591;Samuel L. Jackson is simply brilliant in his part, as is John Travolta and Ving Rhames.
I:8493;1592;By now, the entire world has seen Pulp Fiction.
I:8493;1593;All I can say is what an amazingly brilliant film!Tarantino is great in cinematography or no matter what he does.
I:8493;1594;A fantastic story which is very uniquely set out.
I:8493;1595;He has a style all to his own.
I:8493;1596;Pulp Fiction is a classic from the day it was released!
I:8493;1597;But this is a great one.
I:8493;1598;sequentional timing of the movie is fantastic.
I:8493;1599;"I got a kick out of ""Pulp Fiction"" the first time I saw it."
I:8493;1600;There are a lot of big.
I:8493;1601;after the shrill overexposure this film received when its shot at the Oscars came up, I figured I'd see it a couple more times, to determine if it was really the artistic milestone it was being hyped as.
I:8493;1602;In fact, I found it much less entertaining each time I saw it.
I:8493;1603;I knew exactly what was going to happen, and the plot, even with its film.
I:8493;1604;Quentin Tarantino is strange but gifted.
I:8493;1605;I can watch this any time it comes on.
I:8493;1606;This movie is full of twists and turns.
I:8493;1607;The plot is exciting and you never know where in the movie you are.
I:8493;1608;This movie was very funny, my dad and boyfriend love this movie and we all quote the lines form a few scenes.
I:8493;1609;Yes a bit strange but I loved this movie!
I:8493;1610;My boyfriend and my mom recommended Pulp Fiction to me and now I recommend it to you!
I:8493;1611;Kinda funny in my opinion but who knows if there is a correlation.
I:8493;1612;Well simply genious and Tarantino at his best.
I:8493;1613;in the minds of people who haven't seen that many movies.Yes, this is the breakthrough film that helped give every 12.
I:8493;1614;give me a guy who reveres this flick and I will tell you the other 24 movies he considers the top of all.
I:8493;1615;"The embarrassing truth is that we are merely entertained by his spelling of ""defenately""."
I:8493;1616;"He's an upstanding member of the ""Clockwork Orange"", ""Fight Club"", ""Goodfellas"" crowd, a guy whoDIGS THE ARTY VIOLENCEbig."
I:8493;1617;It's just that I also appreciate movies with other things on their minds.
I:8493;1618;"if you've read many of the other reviews of ""Pulp"" on this site, you've probably noticed that the movie's ""scrambled"" structure is often singled out as a ""good"" thing about the film."
I:8493;1619;"Note how few of the film's fans then explain WHY this is a ""good"" thing."
I:8493;1620;"In fact, several writers claim both that it is a ""good"" thing AND that the film is structured that way ""for no reason""."
I:8493;1621;First of all the movie is fantastic and for under ten dollars a must for any fan of Tarantino.
I:8493;1622;Funny, entertaining, creative and thought.
I:8493;1623;"provoking are words that best describe ""Pulp Fiction."""
I:8493;1624;I especially enjoyed Bruce Willis because he gave an exceptional performance that was both unique and meaningful.
I:8493;1625;John Travolta was also a lot of fun to watch.
I:8493;1626;"The man is a true professional and always gives a wonderful performance in movies, but in ""Pulp Fiction"" he is even more fun to watch because he put so much life and energy into the role that he plays."
I:8493;1627;If you don't take things too seriously and don't mind mindless violence with a little bit of crude language thrown in for good measure than this movie is assuredly for you.
I:8493;1628;The disk was clean, playable, and unscratched.
I:8493;1629;I love how the story lines overlap and then all come together at the end.
I:8493;1630;Always a classic, everyone should see this movie
I:8493;1631;This is one of the best movies ever.
I:8493;1632;A little frightening towards the Antidote scene yet totally believable as well.
I:8493;1633;it is a work of art.
I:8493;1634;I loved this movie because the entire thing was like a shot of pure oxygen.
I:8493;1635;Samuel Jackson is the best as his character Jules, a spiritual hitman with some big anger management issues.
I:8493;1636;Uma Thurman is good for her two scenes,a nd Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames are hilarious.
I:8493;1637;Travolta is quyite good, and plays his character well.
I:8493;1638;This is far superior to anything Tarantino has even been associated with.
I:8493;1639;This is truly a cinema gem.
I:8493;1640;This Is one of the best movies of all time.
I:8493;1641;It is a movie about an american fantasy the good guys win and the bad guys loose.
I:8493;1642;Great movie from start to finish.
I:8493;1643;Great plot line and great actors.
I:8493;1644;His gun accidentally goes off, the windshield gets covered in blood, and, well, though you'd be afraid to admit it, it's funny.
I:8493;1645;this is one of the coolest movies ever made and they don't skimp on the violence do they.
I:8493;1646;it is a great film made with great improvement by a weird genius.
I:8493;1647;That said, it's a hilarious crazy.
I:8493;1648;quilt of a movie, superbly directed by Quentin Tarantino.
I:8493;1649;And yes, there is a straight story line throughout.
I:8493;1650;"Jackson and Travolta are great as the two hitmen Jules and Vince
I:8493;1651;It's a wild, crazy, mind.
I:8493;1652;boggling movie that gets better and better each time you watch it.
I:8493;1653;I have always enjoyed this tale which is real pulp fiction .
I:8493;1654;Thumbs all the way up!
I:8493;1655;'Pulp Fiction', by the great Quentin Tarantino, is probably my favorite movie.
I:8493;1656;The acting, characters, and overall story are simply brilliant.
I:8493;1657;the start of story is about two hitmen taking care of a little business.
I:8493;1658;Later in that story one of those hitmen has to take out his bosses wife and show her a good time while he is away.
I:8493;1659;In the end the movie somehow all makes sense.
I:8493;1660;You should definetly see it more than once to get a full understanding of it.
I:8493;1661;Quentin Tarantino hits another homerun in this instant classic.
I:8493;1662;A lot of action and funny scenes
I:8493;1663;Pulp Fiction, directed by Quentin Tarantino is a cinematic masterpiece, pure and simple.
I:8493;1664;This incredible film that depicts gangsters and thier lives in California is startling, realistic, brutal, engrossing, electrifying, I could go on and on with adjectives.
I:8493;1665;The actors do terrific characters.
I:8493;1666;travolta was so good he was nominated for an Oscar.
I:8493;1667;but the real standout is the director Tarantino.
I:8493;1668;He makes a series of advance and backward scenes that is spellbinding.
I:8493;1669;Tarantino always captures realistic human interaction and its extremely gripping.
I:8493;1670;Go get it now and prepare for an unforgettable cinematic masterpiece.
I:8493;1671;(This opinion comes from a viewer who considers A Clockwork Orange and Fargo excellent films).
I:8493;1672;This movie is so great.
I:8493;1673;It is one of my favorite movies by far.
I:8493;1674;, some standout performances from John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson (one super.

I:8493;1677;It even created a genre, and helped spawn an indie film renaissance of sorts.
I:8493;1678;For others, bite into this slab of cinema that's as meaty and tasty as a Big Kahuna burger.
I:8493;1679;good actors and all around good movie.

I:8493;1683;Samuel L. Jackson's most riveting performance ever.
I:8493;1684;Uma Thurman is a powerhouse.
I:8493;1685;I see the point in the film's name.
I:8493;1686;other reviewers have stated it far better than I can.
I:8493;1687;My view is that this is an excellent example of a film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, who also plays a small part in it.
I:8493;1688;Sometimes it requires some thinking to follow the various chronological shifts of the story, but that makes it more interesting.
I:8493;1689;one emerges with a great deal of respect for Tarantino.
I:8493;1690;the acting is great, smoothly done by consummate professionals including John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman, and more.
I:8493;1691;it manages not to take itself totally seriously.
I:8493;1692;I watch this movie about once a year, and still enjoy it every time.
I:8493;1693;an extraordinary motion picture that has been hailed by audiences and critics alike as a modern masterpiece of film.
I:8493;1694;"Quentin Tarantino fresh off from directing ""Reservoir Dogs"" which shocked and suprised audiences and critics alke too has created another classic of his but as an anthology."
I:8493;1695;The soundtrack is just outstanding including the amazing performances by the cast which also includes Christopher Walken, Rosanna Aequette, Dwayne Whitaker, Phil Lamarr, Harvey Keital, Quentin Tarantino and Eric Stoltz.
I:8493;1696;The dialog is sharp and so is the original screenplay and the characterizations are well done.
I:8493;1697;socks off experience that has became one of the true classics of recent memory that is violent, unique, complex and smart as well with so much memorable quotes you don't know where to start and it's a must see.
I:8493;1698;This is a truly great movie and story line, and the cast is all.
I:8493;1699;star in terms of talent.
I:8493;1700;They act like this was a fun movie for them, and it shows in the final product.
I:8493;1701;Truly enjoyable from beginning to end, however the end was extended by several pauses while the movie reloaded .
I:8493;1702;these three stories unbelievably fit perfectly with each other.
I:8493;1703;"in 1992 ""Reservoir Dogs"" burst upon cinema screens across the world
I:8493;1704;the dialogue is so cool and intriuging and they talk about absolutely.
I:8493;1705;the characters talk about whatevers on their mind.
I:8493;1706;and foot massages!It's bizarre, but so unique dialogue.
I:8493;1707;the characters are so suprisingly real and Jackson, Travolta and Willis give out their best performances in ages.
I:8493;1708;sam Jackson steals every scene with his super cool and smart.
I:8493;1709;"Travolta who hasn't danced sine Grease"" delivers a superb performance and great dance moves along with the tune ""You Never Can Tell"" by Chuck Berry."
I:8493;1710;"one thing that will bug you about the film is ""what was in the case?"
I:8493;1711;"the only clues you get is a glow shining on Travolta's face and Tim Roth looking at it and saying ""it's beautiful."
I:8493;1712;i can't tell you how damn good this film really is.
I:8493;1713;The cast in this film is excellent.
I:8493;1714;This film will have you entertained from start to finish.
I:8493;1715;What makes this film so great is its dialogue.
I:8493;1716;But it is a great film about nothing.
I:8493;1717;Although the film deals with very serious matters it actually kind of makes fun of them selves with all of its comic relief.
I:8493;1718;This film is a great inspiration for ala the young writers out there.
I:8493;1719;At the end of he movie it has a great inspiring speech by Samuel L. Jackson that makes this movie one of the greatest films of all time.
I:8493;1720;Thank goodness it is a Prime movie.
I:8493;1721;This movie is a great one!
I:8493;1722;I loved the acting they are soo real and believable.
I:8493;1723;This is a great movie and I highly recommend anyone watching it.
I:8493;1724;QT places far too much emphasis on making it look hip, stylish, and retro.
I:8493;1725;At the end of it all, that is all it is .
I:8493;1726;top violent setpieces that are an end in themselves.
I:8493;1727;This thing won an Oscar for Best Screenplay?
I:8493;1728;every scene should come with a voice.
I:8493;1729;, because that is the feeling one gets watching this movie .
I:8493;1730;But its success was as much a matter of fortuitous timing as anything else.
I:8493;1731;It was the right film at the right time in Hollywood .
I:8493;1732;the ultimate Flavor of the Month film.
I:8493;1733;But QT has yet to show us that he has the chops to have a long career as a filmmaker of substance.
I:8493;1734;Pulp Fiction, now ten years old, is taking on the feel of a timeless classic.
I:8493;1735;The dialogue is every bit as sharp and even though the movie has spawned imitators, nothing has since measured up.
I:8493;1736;sexy and hip, and speaks volumes about Tarantino's directing abilities.
I:8493;1737;The characters, who present that criminality through a script that is fantastically written, are unforgettable: Samual L. Jackson, as always, bites your head off with in.your.
I:8493;1738;face, unbeatably cool dialogue that's worth repeating.
I:8493;1739;"one of my favorite lines has to be ""I'm a mushroom cloud."
I:8493;1740;But of course, let's face it, Samual L. Jackson is just unquestionably cool.
I:8493;1741;A worthwhile and genuinely creative use of Christopher Walken's weirdness turns out to be a very funny and instrumental addition to Willis's character as well.
I:8493;1742;There are numerous other characters all of whom contribute to the richly fullfilling plot of the film, not to exclude Quentin Tarantino himself, who makes a fairly long appearance.
I:8493;1743;All in all, there is far too much to say about this film but in short, it is a timeless, brilliant film that does seem to capture the essence of the 90's and the prolific existence of criminals and scoundrals in the world.
I:8493;1744;There is dialogue that will make you laugh out loud, long exchanges that will make you think, and action scenes that are graphically real and unforgiving.
I:8493;1745;Love the way the movie wraps around to the beginning (or middle) to the end.
I:8493;1746;While this is my least favorite of the big 3 (Jackie Brown, Reservoir Dogs, and Pulp Fiction) it is still a very good movie.
I:8493;1747;Loved the trivia subtitle track that plays during the movie.
I:8493;1748;The perfect blend of humor, bullets, and dark realism to make this one of the films that I am proud to put on my list of favorites.
I:8493;1749;The second in the lineup of Tarrantino's shocking and cooly hip films (the first being Reservoir Dogs, which I have also reviewed) is the absolute best.
I:8493;1750;Three stories that are played in no particular order and somehow link together are what make up Pulp Fiction.
I:8493;1751;In the second, the subject is a boxer, a crime boss, a gold watch, and a pawn shop keeper.
I:8493;1752;And finally, the third, is about two hitmen, a gun, a car, brains, and a paranoid suburban guy, who somehow has a problem with storing a headless body in his garage.
I:8493;1753;I know that I did not go into much detail, but I want you to enjoy the twists, turns, and suprises that make up this great movie.
I:8493;1754;A rough film, no question about it, but still one of the best in history.
I:8493;1755;This is one of those movies that I would give 6 stars if I could.
I:8493;1756;Terintino is an Excellent film maker, and Samual Jackson is excelent as the assasin that turns over a new leaf.
I:8493;1757;the best part of the movie is its refreshing uniqueness in that plot lines flow through sub plotlines and everything works together in a seinfeld.
I:8493;1758;Pulp Fiction one of the best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino.
I:8493;1759;This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken.
I:8493;1760;The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful.
I:8493;1761;Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s.
I:8493;1762;Interweaving stories in Altman style, but with the Tarantino violence and humor combined with impeccable acting by actors at the peak of their craft.
I:8493;1763;It's one of the most underated films.
I:8493;1764;I forgot how much I enjoyed this movie.
I:8493;1765;This is one the best movies ever made even if the director is a total nut and a pompous windbag
I:8493;1766;I will watch it every year or so and enjoy it every time
I:8493;1767;This movie is unlike any other you've seen before.
I:8493;1768;From the Mia Wallace scene to the hilarious dialogue with Quentin Tarantino at his house, its just amazing.
I:8493;1769;Its very weird and deranged, but in the best way possible.
I:8493;1770;For those who were wondering, this is one of the best movie ever.
I:8493;1771;This is THE movie that made the 90s the 90s.
I:8493;1772;Some hailed it as a masterpiece.
I:8493;1773;The only Tarantino film I liked better than this one was True Romance.
I:8493;1774;Both great movies that I would recommend.
I:8493;1775;Watched this in the theater back in the day and still love it.
I:8493;1776;One of Quentin Tarantino's best movies by far.
I:8493;1777;It's just an awesome movie.
I:8493;1778;And it looks great on Blu Ray too.
I:8493;1779;Seriously, who would deny that this is the best movie ever made.
I:8493;1780;Everything in this movie (characters, scenery, music, plot, order, etc) has been expertly thought out and perfectly executed to create this amazing story that I could watch endlessly.
I:8493;1781;Bought this after having numerous friends talking about it and I have loved every minute of it!!
I:8493;1782;Everybody knows Pulp Fiction, right?
I:8493;1783;If you love enormously entertaining action movies, then this is the movie for you.
I:8493;1784;found the movie I wanted,ordered it , and 4 days later it was right at my door.
I:8493;1785;Pulp Fiction is one of my favs, good storyline, nice that it was set in the 80's, it's like a look back onto the underbelly of LA back then.
I:8493;1786;line of the story, makes it more interesting.
I:8493;1787;My favorite movie of all time!
I:8493;1788;A pioneer to a new genre style of movies.
I:8493;1789;love this movie would recommend to anyone who loves action and thought provoking movies.
I:8493;1790;Well worth your time and money
I:8493;1791;The role of Jules Winnifield played by Samuel L Jackson was just brilliant.
I:8493;1792;I just loved this film.
I:8493;1793;It's a film you actually have to watch twice to fully understand, I love movies that make you think and still have action and funny at the same time.
I:8493;1794;i recommend everyone with a mind mature enough to understand what's really going on to watch it,it's just great!
I:8493;1795;Pulp Fiction really put into perspective for me, what makes a good movie.
I:8493;1796;paced movie, long single camera scenes, conversations like those you usually have with your friends, but for some reason you can't be bored by this movie, it completely captures you.
I:8493;1797;Iconic movie of our times.
I:8493;1798;I gave this movie 5 stars for its outstanding cast, directing, and content.
I:8493;1799;The more you watch it, the better it gets.
I:8493;1800;John Travolta makes an awesome comeback!
I:8493;1801;but it is a good movie to watch again if u haven't seen it for a while.
I:8493;1802;loved it first time around
I:8493;1803;Hands down the best independent film ever constructed.
I:8493;1804;Master auteur and genius screenwriter Quentin Tarantino builds this magnum opus (his best film to date) which is to be forever re.
I:8493;1805;Thorough character development, a complex plot, the most intriguing dialogue and an abundance of stars and excellent acting make this film a contemporary cult classic.
I:8493;1806;You go into a Tarantino movie expecting irrevelent but thrilling dialogue, buckets of blood, spectacular writing and characters more real than you or me.
I:8493;1807;Pulp Fiction delivers in every respect.
I:8493;1808;It is pumped with energy and will keep you wanting more.
I:8493;1809;Still, there is a connection between the music and the moving action.
I:8493;1810;There is a feeling that you do wish to know a bit more, but that is just another demonstration of the skill in the writing.
I:8493;1811;The dialogue is funny and fresh, more real than reality.
I:8493;1812;With such original writing, it needs a style that suits it a little better.
I:8493;1813;It works most of the time but every once in a while you feel you are watching another director's movie.
I:8493;1814;this is probably the masterpiece of the 1990s, not as good as some profess but still a brilliant piece of work.
I:8493;1815;It's entertaining and new, something that movies have been lacking as of late.
I:8493;1816;Django unchained was really good too.
I:8493;1817;Great period piece with quick dialog that is smart, witty, and charged with electricity.
I:8493;1818;Bought this as a gift and the receiver loved it!
I:8493;1819;This is a great classic movie that is just so much fun to watch again.
I:8493;1820;I love this movie, it's hilarious!
I:8493;1821;A great pick for a Tarantino movie night if you're the kind of person who does those sorts of things.
I:8493;1822;Great movie, lots of stories, lots of action, and Bruce Willis is always amazing.
I:8493;1823;If you're looking for an action flick with lots of character, this is it!
I:8493;1824;The movie was in perfect condition.
I:8493;1825;This is one of those movies that you will watch over and over again.
I:8493;1826;It was fun to follow.
I:8493;1827;my husband loved the movie and wanted me to see it.
I:8493;1828;I'm glad I bought it for him!
I:8493;1829;This movie is so riveting, I had to go back to the theater 4 times to see it to make sure that this was really in a movie!
I:8493;1830;With stars like John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Harvey Keitel, Bruce Willis, and even a cameo by Quentin himself, this movie SIZZLES from second to second.
I:8493;1831;Travolta is a hit man for Ving Rames' character and also a heroin addict.
I:8493;1832;When he takes Ving's girlfriend, played by the sexy Uma Thurman, out to dinner as a favor and she OD's on his heroin thinking it's cocaine.
I:8493;1833;Quentin, you a one twisted but totally cool DUDE!
I:8493;1834;Enjoyed this film more than I thought I would.
I:8493;1835;Greatest guy movie ever created.
I:8493;1836;Top notch performances by all actors involved.
I:8493;1837;If you like movies you'll like this one.
I:8493;1838;Pulp Fiction is just a classic!
I:8493;1839;This movie has some of the best dialogue of any movie I've ever seen: Discussions about how intimate a foot massage is, $5 milkshakes, the differences between fast food in Amsterdam, Paris and the U. s., the art of body piercing, appreciation of good coffee, etc.
I:8493;1840;Pulp Fiction just makes them interesting.
I:8493;1841;the movie essentially follows four stories: a romantically involved couple who also are hold.
I:8493;1842;"up artists, two hitmen, Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) on a job, Vincent's ""date"" with his boss's wife (Uma Thurman), and a boxer (Bruce Willis) who is paid to take a fall."
I:8493;1843;linear plot also adds to the movie's interest.
I:8493;1844;Ultmately, the movie comes full circle, and it's quite a fun ride.
I:8493;1845;for an interesting perspective on the movie, watch for the way the power shifts.
I:8493;1846;At any given time, there's usually one or two characters with power.
I:8493;1847;and how the power shifts and who winds up with the power is fascinating.
I:8493;1848;This is especially true during Jules and Vincent's ride after their hit, their visit to Tarantino, a very put.
I:8493;1849;This is a must have to own.
I:8493;1850;Great plot, and as typical for Tarantino, the non.
I:8493;1851;sequential timeline keeps things interesting and the viewer somewhat off.
I:8493;1852;Excellent method and good movie.
I:8493;1853;The opening dialog between Travolta and Jackson is well worth the price of admission for this classic.
I:8493;1854;It was in great shape, with no scratches and played perfectly.
I:8493;1855;Funny parts in it with people doing drugs and crime.
I:8493;1856;The problem is that young people see this movie and then believe that crime is a way of life that is considered normal and even fun.
I:8493;1857;This is one of my favorite mind twisters.
I:8493;1858;Has to be one of my favorite Quentin Tarantino movies.
I:8493;1859;Pulp Fiction is a modern classic, an outstandingly stylish movie from Quentin Tarantino.
I:8493;1860;What I liked best about this release, in addition to the improved graphics, is the bonuses, particularly the interview with John Travolta and other cast members.
I:8493;1861;"I agree that the ""Jack Rabbit Slim"" scene is one of the best sequences shot, very stylish and memorable."
I:8493;1862;Superb set design, acting, dialogue and the rest.
I:8493;1863;Brilliant masterpiece of filmmaking and modern cinema.
I:8493;1864;I hope to see more movies from QT, he's one of the top filmmakers today .
I:8493;1865;"edgy, ""gets it"", and memorable."
I:8493;1866;Inglorious Basterds is my favorite Tarantino flick, but, Pulp Fiction is pretty close.
I:8493;1867;I love how he frames a shot.
I:8493;1868;oh, and yeah , he's the best writer too.
I:8493;1869;I love Quentin Tarantino and this movie.
I:8493;1870;I really like how you go back and forth in the timeline and it shows everything that happened.
I:8493;1871;Samuel L. Jackson is great and the movie has funny and serious parts.
I:8493;1872;One of my favorite Quentin Tarantino movies.
I:8493;1873;Great acting, I love Tarantino's style .
I:8493;1874;this is a must see movie!
I:8493;1875;It's like the best movie in the world.
I:8493;1876;Quentin Tarantino is a pretty damn good director and writer.
I:8493;1877;Quentin is a great director and picture writer.
I:8493;1878;he gives you a little bit of everything life has to offer.
I:8493;1879;this movie has an all star cast that did a great job portraying quentins vision.
I:8493;1880;all wrapped up in not one, but several great story lines .
I:8493;1881;Despite the shared story line that drugs and violence generally end badly for the purveyors, probably not something I'd share with my 13 year old .
I:8493;1882;What can you say if you love Tarantino's work.
I:8493;1883;it's a great story!The music and dancing really fit in with the story.
I:8493;1884;I can see why this is considered a film classic.
I:8493;1885;I loved how the narratives were mixed together to create such an interesting overall story.
I:8493;1886;This film is a true original with the timeline of events completely confused (for effect not error).
I:8493;1887;It is not for youngsters but is a true instant classic!
I:8493;1888;This movie is just outrageous and over the top.
I:8493;1889;The stars are here too, Samuel L Jackson Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, Umma Thurman, and John Travolta.
I:8493;1890;First of all, an awesome movie.
I:8493;1891;When Jackson and Travolta are in the guys' appartments retrieving Marcellus' briefcase, Travolta opens the breifcase and there is a bright shining light that reflects on Travolta's face.
I:8493;1892;The shining light represents the soul.
I:8493;1893;Travolta and Jackson's job was to retrieve his soul.
I:8493;1894;I was lucky to see it in the theatre.
I:8493;1895;It's one film I still thought about three weeks later.
I:8493;1896;This is a new classic movie!
I:8493;1897;I enjoyed all the extra bonus content on the extra disc.
I:8493;1898;A great addition to anybody's collection.
I:8493;1899;Just remember it has a mature rating, not for everybody.
I:8493;1900;Bought this for my dad as a gift .
I:8493;1901;he loves it and brings it up every time I see him.
I:8493;1902;hip film that put John Travolta back on the map is one of the most effortlessly entertaining films in cinema history.
I:8493;1903;The top cast of Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis are all great in their decidedly off.
I:8493;1904;The unique approach to the material is played out in the grandest sense, with the backwards events and commendable wayward camera techniques.
I:8493;1905;The classy soundtrack (one of my favourites) is equally impressive.
I:8493;1906;nails direction makes this one somewhat hard to sit through.
I:8493;1907;But it's enjoyable on so many levals, including counting how many time the F word is said.
I:8493;1908;the acting was good, except by Quentin Tarantino, the director who read his lines like he was reading a book.
I:8493;1909;This is a stunning blu.
I:8493;1910;ray with a perfect, glowing transfer and hours of extras.
I:8493;1911;I first saw PF at the equally one of a kind theatre at the Tacheles in Berlin in 1995, and the marriage of this film with that art.
I:8493;1912;punk squatters' collektive's wonderfully trashed out cinema, with the movie screened on a huge white wall and the seats a mish.
I:8493;1913;but then I found the blu.
I:8493;1914;This is a pristine image, absolutely stunning colors and definition, with lossless sound.
I:8493;1915;Easily one of the best modern films on BD that I've yet seen.
I:8493;1916;It started a whole new wave of auteur cinema, and remains as fresh as the day it was released.
I:8493;1917;So many wild moments, especially the adrenaline scene.
I:8493;1918;Travolta and Jackson are tremendous, and the extras show John talking about how Quentin changed his life with this role, and his love of JT's work.
I:8493;1919;This is just one of those works of art where the stars aligned, and everything clicks.
I:8493;1920;Walken always cracks me up, and his delivery of the asswatch speech is so hilarious.
I:8493;1921;Keitel is likewise right on, as is everyone.
I:8493;1922;not a film for the overly sensitive in any case, Pulp Fiction is a real masterpiece, and it's wonderful that it looks so damn fine on blu.
I:8493;1923;And at 9 clams here, it's a real deal as well.
I:8493;1924;This film belongs in any collection of 20th century cinema classics, and in any collection of the best blu.
I:8493;1925;Typical Trantino: violent, interesting characters, messes with your sense of time and place and overall very entertaining.
I:8493;1926;great performances, interesting story, and an awesome soundtrack, too.
I:8493;1927;The wonderful thing about this movie is the down.
I:8493;1928;And the acting is absolutely amazing.
I:8493;1929;This is one of the best cast's I have ever seen, from Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta and Bruce Willis.
I:8493;1930;The best scene is by far the scene with Tarantino in his house, where they have to clean.
I:8493;1931;but I guarantee if you see this you'll love it.
I:8493;1932;This is one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time.
I:8493;1933;if you what a action movie this has your name all over it.
I:8493;1934;samueal L. Jackson and John Travolta do great performaces as hit.
I:8493;1935;the movie tells a story like you have never heard before, its very easy to get into this movie because its so easy to watch.
I:8493;1936;this is a excellent movie I recommend watching it any time.
I:8493;1937;Yes, let's all thank Tarantino once again for creating one of the most original, enjoyable, brilliant, and flat.
I:8493;1938;out greatest movies ever made.
I:8493;1939;The kinky charisma between John Travolta and Uma Thurman alone is worth viewing this movie.
I:8493;1940;Their dance scene at Jack Rabbit Slim's is (in my opinion) the most memorable.
I:8493;1941;bruce Willis fit into his role of prizefighter Butch perfectly.
I:8493;1942;Samuel L. Jackson (being one my favorite actors) gave a powerful and stunning performance as hitman Jules.
I:8493;1943;He always mamages to add the right amount of humor to his character.
I:8493;1944;Ving Rhames also gave a very powerful performance as Marsellus Wallace, Mia's husband.
I:8493;1945;Harvey Keitel gave a masterful performance as well as his role of the Wolf .
I:8493;1946;And may I not forget Christopher Walken (one of my most favorite actors of all time) whose monologue was the one of the highlights (if not THE highlight) and one of the most memorable scenes in Pulp Fiction.
I:8493;1947;The rest of the cast which includes Tim Roth (as Pumpkin), Amanda Plummer (as Honey Bunny), Eric Stoltz (as Lance), Rosanna Arquette (as Jody), and Maria de Medeiros (as Fabienne) all give powerhouse performances.
I:8493;1948;Hey, even Quentin Tarantino himself gives a cameo!Pure classic, pure entertainment, pure brilliance, pure originality .
I:8493;1949;Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed it, and that in itself is amazing.
I:8493;1950;Anything Tarantino does is amazing.
I:8493;1951;A superb cast including John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, and Christopher Walken, to name a few.
I:8493;1952;This is a superb cast simply because each actor (big or not) appropriately fills his or her role.
I:8493;1953;Quentin uses a very unique and distinctive story.
I:8493;1954;telling method which I feel makes him one of the greatest film.
I:8493;1955;Pulp Fiction is Tarantino's 2nd film, and showcases great performances wrapped in an excellent story with very real.
I:8493;1956;This movie is dark, yet hilarious at the same time.
I:8493;1957;Bottom line, Pulp Fiction is on my Top 10 All Time list, and is a film that you absolutely must experience.
I:8493;1958;Strong language and sexual situations, but really an interesting movie with lots of non.
I:8493;1959;lots of stars and a good soundtrack.
I:8493;1960;i liked it a lot.
I:8493;1961;Like any great work of art, it can be a bit difficult to write about a movie like Pulp Fiction.
I:8493;1962;a. kind characters, or the instantly evocative set pieces, but there's more to it than just that.
I:8493;1963;The movie is, in the truest sense of the phrase, so much more than the sum of its parts.
I:8493;1964;Pulp Fiction is a world unto itself, a fantasy universe in which the most tantalizingly filthy aspects of American culture are transformed into high art.
I:8493;1965;It's a world in which comic books, dime novels, gangster films, and surf music 45s are every bit as evocative and compelling as the works of Shakespeare or Da Vinci (seriously, I'm not exaggerating.
I:8493;1966;It's a movie that wraps you around its finger from the unforgettable opening scene and holds on to you until.
I:8493;1967;This is a real classic.
I:8493;1968;I still love the movie even after 20 years.
I:8493;1969;(wow has it been that long?)
I:8493;1970;A lot of people are like that, myself included.
I:8493;1971;that being said, I can move on and say that Pulp Fiction is probably the best American movie ever made.
I:8493;1972;The plot is amazing, the visuals are eye catching and the acting is excellent.
I:8493;1973;It has a little bit of everything, and overall, it's just about as good as cinema can get.
I:8493;1974;The movie is great, and in perfect condition.
I:8493;1975;One of the best movie quotes pictures ever.
I:8493;1976;Got this movie as a gift for someone.
I:8493;1977;He loves Quentin Tarantino movies, so this was the perfect movie for him.
I:8493;1978;Plus some people see this as an iconic movie.
I:8493;1979;Being an avid film junky is a big job, but someones gotta do it, and there's nothing more I like to do than give a good film the recognition it deserves.
I:8493;1980;there aren't enough, but I can say with it's star studded cast and stupendous dialogue it will remain to be one of the best films.
I:8493;1981;His directing talent is profound and it show in this film.
I:8493;1982;he won an oscar for best adapted screenplay and should have got more, I have no idea how Forrest Gump out did him, the soundtrack alone sholdd win it eleven awards but somehow it missed out.
I:8493;1983;The film though still holds the same charm, excellent characters and fantastic writing .
I:8493;1984;The film is one story about three stories, showcasing a brilliant cast, with John Travlota, Sam Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Bruce Willis.
I:8493;1985;The brilliance of the film lies in Tarantino's ability to create likable characters doing very unlikable things.
I:8493;1986;Named on AFI's 100 years, 100 movies as one of the best films in the last 100 years!
I:8493;1987;It truely is a must see, and a movie to be watched a hundred times.
I:8493;1988;It was a little too rough for my taste but he weaves an interesting time line.
I:8493;1989;A simple story packed with many surprises, twisted plots and common dialogue.
I:8493;1990;Each characters share an individual story.
I:8493;1991;It is probably the greatest movie to ever come out of the 90's.
I:8493;1992;It was the most original movie to come out in a while, one of the most widely respected and critically acclaimed genre films of all time.
I:8493;1993;He revived the career of John Travolta, and introduced Amanda Plummer to the U. s., all be it a very small role she delivered a wonderful performance.
I:8493;1994;This film is a classic.
I:8493;1995;"Tarantino, the whiz kid of the New Illiteracy and the even newer wave of cinema ""geniuses"", is actually a very entertaining screenwriter."
I:8493;1996;"The dialogue in ""Pulp"" is heavily laced with profanity, but much of it is so funny it is hard to care about that."
I:8493;1997;Samuel L. Jackson is an unacknowledged genius of an actor, and Travolta, for what it's worth, was the perfect lead character to play opposite of him.
I:8493;1998;"Where ""Reservoir Dogs"" is savage and cruel (and those are its good qualities), ""Pulp Fiction"" is actually more enjoyable and approachable."
I:8493;1999;"I think Quentin has lost his way with these tawdry homages ""Death Proof"" (or as I like to call it, ""100 Proof"") and ""Inglorious Basterds"", but ""Pulp Fiction"" is a movie that I can watch and enjoy almost anytime."
I:8493;2000;I guess it goes to show what can happen when talented actors are on board and when great individual scenes are written for them to get into.
I:8493;2001;"Even the violence in ""Pulp Fiction"", while quite strong, is surprising and handled a bit more imaginatively."
I:8493;2002;It's certainly a film to take one by surprise, so I am definitely giving it a strong recommendation, despite some over the top moments.
I:8493;2003;(And yes, the syringe to the heart scene is more humorous than scary.)
I:8493;2004;the best movie ever !!!
I:8493;2005;one of the best scenarios with the brilliant act of legendary actors !
I:8493;2006;Excellent movie, memorable scenes with passive aggressive behavior.
I:8493;2007;One of the best movies from Quentin.
I:8493;2008;This is truly a classic!
I:8493;2009;This movie is as cool as it gets.
I:8493;2010;From the cast and their unforgettable dialogue, to the music and unorthodox timeline.
I:8493;2011;all of it work together beautifully to make an entertaining movie which has stood the test of time.
I:8493;2012;the music sounds great, and the few scenes where the action gets loud (namely when Vincent Vega and Juels let their guns loose in the iconic collection scene) sound rich and crisp.
I:8493;2013;ray is definitely the definitive version.
I:8493;2014;it's in a class all of it's own.
I:8493;2015;I did enjoy it (but oh the swearing.)
I:8493;2016;This is one of my fav movies .
I:8493;2017;If you can get around the profanity, good flick!Like Travolta immensely, does an exceptional job in the movie!Five stars!
I:8493;2018;This movie is a classic and one of my favorites.
I:8493;2019;Will be enjoyed by both men and women.
I:8493;2020;Should have one an Oscar for best picture.
I:8493;2021;Best movie ever, enough said, period.
I:8493;2022;Pulp Fiction is a great film by Quinton Teratino (sp?)
I:8493;2023;It has dry humor clashed with action with a twist of romance.
I:8493;2024;It is the quirky classic that put Tarantino on the map!
I:8493;2025;It has been several years since I viewed this film.
I:8493;2026;quentin Tarantino is at his best
I:8493;2027;But I watched it again today for the first time in ages, and it reminded me how great this is and how much of a classic it is.
I:8493;2028;It's a classic from a classic director.
I:8493;2029;It's funny and so well written.
I:8493;2030;It's one of the best movies ever made.
I:8493;2031;John Travolta et al are amazing.
I:8493;2032;They did such a good job on this.
I:8493;2033;"if you own the first ""medieval"" release, replace it with this one."
I:8493;2034;I think Quentin creates films that are masterpieces of creativity, just like Kubrick uses imagery.
I:8493;2035;This film has really great characters who just come across with dialog that doesnt so much ring with wit but with imagination.
I:8493;2036;The film uses actors who just turn their roles into scene stealers again and again.
I:8493;2037;Willis doesnt say too much, but he reflects his nonverbal as stoic until he turns into a baby talker with his uniquely attractive french girlfriend with a very round apple face.
I:8493;2038;The two main thugs are Fishburne and Travolta, they both do a good job.
I:8493;2039;I like the way Fishburne uses his speech and articulates so eloquently, he finally feels his bible verse during a murder raid, which will change his life.
I:8493;2040;Travolta and Thurman are the most inventive and I loved when they share an intimate outing with drugs overtaking the real connection.
I:8493;2041;The things I liked were the cool connection of the Travolta and Thurman, the twist and the fun of showing off their style.
I:8493;2042;I liked Thurmans camera director meeting with him.
I:8493;2043;She displays this air of creativity and in the moment fun even though on a high.
I:8493;2044;Filming is fun, I liked to do little short character takes or shooting your friends like an interview.
I:8493;2045;I liked the coffee shop.
I:8493;2046;I liked the motel with the anonimity and intimacy they shared, with the overcast skies.
I:8493;2047;I liked the thought of a big breakfast with blueberry pancakes and sausages with lots of maple syrup.
I:8493;2048;I liked that they could go anywhere and experience great adventures like Bora Bora.
I:8493;2049;I liked that Willis went back to help the oppressor out of so much degradation.
I:8493;2050;This is the greatest movie, and not only that, the bonus material that comes with it is awesome for the price!
I:8493;2051;This is one of my favorite films.
I:8493;2052;It's definitely Samuel Jackson at his best.
I:8493;2053;He has lines that we love to quote in our house.
I:8493;2054;We both love how all the stories tie together at the end.
I:8493;2055;Pulp fiction launched his carear and made a huge impact on hollywood.
I:8493;2056;one of the big things that makes a tarantino film a tarantino film is the story.
I:8493;2057;Tarantino writes AND directs his own stuff and is as talented a writer as he is a director.
I:8493;2058;You absolutely must watch the WHOLE movie, and pay attention, this isnt a movie you can watch while talking to a friend on the phone, but you will be greatly rewarded.
I:8493;2059;The diologue can be about nothing and somehow still be compelling and keeping you lusting for more.
I:8493;2060;star cast are OUTSTANDING by any definition of the word, and all bring real personality and nuances to thier well thought out and interesting characters.
I:8493;2061;But Pulp Fiction is truly in a category of it's own.
I:8493;2062;If you are a fan of Tarantino then you will love the movie.
I:8493;2063;Great acting and many story lines merge together in a way that makes it all work.
I:8493;2064;Violence is a trademark of any Quentin Tarantino film, and he doesn't disappoint in this one!
I:8493;2065;This is a classic movie and Amazon might just be the only place you can stream it.
I:8493;2066;But this film has something that none other does, great performances by characters that are the lowest of low and saying things in the a way that makes them real and sympathetic to the audience.
I:8493;2067;this film that many have said it one the best of all time.
I:8493;2068;it has three separate stories one with John Travolta (Saturday Night Fever, Look Who's Talking, Michael) and Samuel L. Jackson (Star Wars Episode !
I:8493;2069;and @, Pulp Fiction) giving some of their best performances and their careers.
I:8493;2070;They are all intricately intertwined and cross each other paths with the seemingly witty talents of Uma Thurmon (Batman and Robin, The Avengers), Christopher Walking (America's Sweethearts, The Dead Zone ), Harvey Keital (Red Dragon, Little Nicky), Rosanna Arquette (The Big Blue, Joe Dirt, The Whole Nine Yards) and Eric Stoltz (Mask, Anaconda, Hercules).
I:8493;2071;The story is raw and the action is non.
I:8493;2072;It is amazing interesting and riveting at times.
I:8493;2073;This hyperactive director takes you on this hyperactive ride rather well.
I:8493;2074;There are several good behind the scenes of the production, history and story of the film.
I:8493;2075;i really liked this movie because of the performances Travolta and Jackson are incredible and even Eric Stoltz shines in this one.
I:8493;2076;Great cinematography and an amazing soundtrack.
I:8493;2077;Tarantino is the director and must have tongue in cheek throughout!Pulp Fiction is set in Hollywood in the 1990's and combines three stories that focus on two characters.
I:8493;2078;Marsellus has a beautiful wife, Mia (Uma Thurman).
I:8493;2079;Marsellus wants Vincent to entertain his wife and takes her out to a 1950's themed restaurant.
I:8493;2080;She takes a liking to Vincent, and is also a drug addict.
I:8493;2081;She overdoses and the scrambling and the scenes scrambling saving her from death are hilarious.
I:8493;2082;He decides to make money himself by doing the opposite and wins the fight, killing his opponent in an early round.
I:8493;2083;there is also an interesting character named Wolf (Keitel).
I:8493;2084;He is a mobster cleanup man who instructs on how to do the job.
I:8493;2085;the film's stories weave in and out, there is a lot of dialogue that is mesmerizing.
I:8493;2086;The movie is original and bright though the theme is dark in the noir way.
I:8493;2087;the final scene brings the movie together .
I:8493;2088;I love how there are multiple story lines and how they all thread together at the end.
I:8493;2089;I watched this movie in 2005 (I never saw it before) and the reason I finally did see it is because most people I know told me how great it is.
I:8493;2090;The idea that this movie is liked by so many clearly shows the direction that society seems to have taken.
I:8493;2091;This is one of my favorite movies EVER!
I:8493;2092;Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta are two of my favorite actors and they are amazing together in this movie!
I:8493;2093;great memorable lines, good drama, music!
I:8493;2094;This was a gift for Christmas.
I:8493;2095;It came in a timely fashion and it was so easy to locate.
I:8493;2096;Obviously this was brilliantly directed and acted.
I:8493;2097;It fits no genre yet appeals to all demographics.
I:8493;2098;Its perfection is almost divine.
I:8493;2099;Tarantino was so confident in his bizarre story that he made it work.
I:8493;2100;Without a doubt, this is the best film ever made.
I:8493;2101;Pulp Fiction is a fantastic film.
I:8493;2102;Very Good interview with Tarantino and his philosophy.
I:8493;2103;ray or 2009 Swedish international import version that works in region 1 (North America).
I:8493;2104;The Swedish import has held its value well.
I:8493;2105;It is one of the best Blu.
I:8493;2106;i bought this one because at times I will watch it.
I:8493;2107;i have always liked it.
I:8493;2108;I have always loved the movie and wanted to add it to my collection for the third time.
I:8493;2109;After looking at IMDB for some of the best movies of all time, we came across Pulp Fiction.
I:8493;2110;There are a lot of intense scenes in the movie as well as some quite funny parts.
I:8493;2111;If you are a fan of his movies, this is a must.
I:8493;2112;Others may not feel the same way however it's definitely worth a watch.
I:8493;2113;probably Tarantino's best or at least well.
I:8493;2114;For example, the two main characters (played by Samuel Jackson and John Travolta) are a couple of amiable hit.
I:8493;2115;men who are perfectly friendly and civilized as long as you're not on their little list of people to eliminate, as they go around cheerfully discussing philosophy, sex, and the meaning of life while offing their boss's enemies.
I:8493;2116;The watch makes an interesting symbol, because neither Travolta nor Willis has time to lose messing around with, in Travolta's case, nature's call, or in Willis's case, sentimental keepsakes.
I:8493;2117;I enjoyed this clever and funny aspect of the movie and it probably remains my favorite among Tarantino's films.
I:8493;2118;Plus Harvey Keitel is great as the guy who can fix even the worst of Travolta and Jackson's screw.
I:8493;2119;At the core of each story fragment is an emotional vacuum that gets glossed over by the clever use of filmmaking gimmickry, self.
I:8493;2120;For a similar effect I prefer to watch Warner Brothers cartoons.
I:8493;2121;They are funnier, more inventive, more artistically satisfying, and there is no element of self.
I:8493;2122;pulp Fiction is one of the most creative and entertaning movies of the 1990s.
I:8493;2123;It stands apart from most crime dramas/action flicks ever made, and is definately a treat.
I:8493;2124;Great Story line (or lack thereof) and great acting.
I:8493;2125;After seeing PULP, I realised that I wanted to do that.
I:8493;2126;After seeing PULP FICTION, I was much more willing to go out and see new forms of art and experience new things.
I:8493;2127;The Theater, Literature, and Indie and Forgein film all seemed much more appealing after this movie.
I:8493;2128;I really enjoyed watching this movie again on the streaming video.
I:8493;2129;watch it again for the first time.
I:8493;2130;I am so happy I bought this.
I:8493;2131;It was in perfect condition for being a used version.
I:8493;2132;I got it for my brother for Christmas and I actually got a hug for it!!
I:8493;2133;This film, is one of my most all time favorite films I've ever seen.
I:8493;2134;If any film crew of Pulp Fiction views this, I just want to thank you all for your great work on this film.
I:8493;2135;One of the best movies ever, this movie doesn't need a review, you know its a classic that you must see.
I:8493;2136;Although I found that it was hard to enjoy it as much as I had back in the VHS days, due to the familiarity of so many lines and scenes and their repetition with friends over the years, I appreciated seeing it in all its glory.
I:8493;2137;It's a long movie that quickly goes by with its whirlwind of dazzling dialogue.
I:8493;2138;So, in my case, it's a great film.
I:8493;2139;It's got a great plot, story, sound, and amazing acting from John Travolta.
I:8493;2140;I can still remember the first time I saw Pulp Fiction.
I:8493;2141;Between trying to put the chronology together and absorbing the bizarre and seemingly disconnected events, I was completely hooked right to the end as everything finally came together and finally made sense.
I:8493;2142;story and how strangely they come together is enough to make it a fairly regular favorite.
I:8493;2143;If you don't care for an overabundance of violence, drug use, foul language, or perverted sex, stop right here and get on with your life.
I:8493;2144;directed, graphically controversial, sarcastically provocative and darkly humorous.
I:8493;2145;One with the movie, and the other on how the movie came about.
I:8493;2146;Man has a special gift.
I:8493;2147;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
I:8493;2148;There's a lot going on in it and it all comes to .
I:8493;2149;There's a lot of name association here.
I:8493;2150;It is one of the best pieces of work I have ever seen.
I:8493;2151;The edit of the film was genius as well as direction.
I:8493;2152;Tarantinos best work, pehaps ties with Jackie Brown, Kill Bill,Inglorious Basterds, and Reservoir Dogs.
I:8493;2153;The stories are great, and the characters are well developed.
I:8493;2154;Humor, action, gore, profanity, great sound track, this movie has it all.
I:8493;2155;This movie is enjoyable on a number of levels.
I:8493;2156;It's very entertaining on the surface level.
I:8493;2157;There's so many things going on and so much variety that it's easy to watch and stay curious.
I:8493;2158;For those who like to study film, there's enough interesting elements here to explore.
I:8493;2159;All in all it's well worth watching.
I:8493;2160;but, if you suspend judgement, this movie is fun to watch.
I:8493;2161;Even the bad elements are funny.
I:8493;2162;But a lot of that craziness adds up to some funny moments.
I:8493;2163;it's also cool that so many retro elements were incorporated so well into the movie.
I:8493;2164;Jack Rabbit Slims, the throwback 50s restaurant Travolta and Thurman eat in, is very cool.
I:8493;2165;The dance contest scene is definitely one for the ages.
I:8493;2166;it is a bit of a stretch to call this one of the best movies ever, as some reviewers have done.
I:8493;2167;"Suffice it to say that it's a fun movie to watch and interesting enough to be considered ""good."""
I:8493;2168;"Those expecting ""one of the best films of all time"" will be disappointed."
I:8493;2169;all in all, if you got a few hours and you want to see a movie with great camera work, some funny and scary moments, and enough variety to keep you interested, Pulp Fiction is worth a watch.
I:8493;2170;It keeps my attention every time, and every time I see something new.
I:8493;2171;But the characters in Pulp Fiction are real people.
I:8493;2172;their everyday talk is intriging, interesting, independent of the plot.
I:8493;2173;It allows you to identify with the characters rather than take their word for it.
I:8493;2174;the genious behind the movie is actually a simple idea.
I:8493;2175;Tarantino takes story which spans two days, cuts it into four pieces, each ending with a revelation of some kind, and re.
I:8493;2176;PART 1: Film reviewThis is one of those films that come along so rarely that one must savor them when they eventually do.
I:8493;2177;Quentin Tarantino screenwrites and directs to an incredible high.
I:8493;2178;This film has some of the most poetic cursing in any movie.
I:8493;2179;The dialogue is extremely carefully written.
I:8493;2180;The conversations sound realistic and are often laugh.
I:8493;2181;John Travolta is equally fantastic as his partner, in the role that revitalized his career so late after Grease was released.
I:8493;2182;Uma Thurman is as she always is, which is effortlessly cool, calm, and collected no matter what her character is doing.
I:8493;2183;The role is written for her, and it's exactly the kind of person that only she can play.
I:8493;2184;It's the slowest part of the movie, but it creates a strong sense of the relationships between the people in the movie and the content of their characters, as well as revealing what drives these people to do what they do in the way they choose to do it.
I:8493;2185;As it moves onwards, it begins to turn around on itself, as characters interpret things that have happened, and this forces you as the viewer to see everything in an entirely new way.
I:8493;2186;The way Tarantino's script simultaneously tells an interesting story so well while creating memorable characters without even telling the story straight is remarkable.
I:8493;2187;The Collector's Edition is the best transfer yet by far, with cleaned up video, a fresh transfer, and Dolby 5.1 surround sound.
I:8493;2188;secondly, the special features are remarkable.
I:8493;2189;length documentaries about the film and crew, to reviews, many photo galleries, a Charlie Rose interview, an episode of At the Movies (with Ebert and Roeper) about the impact of this film.
I:8493;2190;Plus, there's even a fun trivia subtitle track that you can turn on that gives a very large number of intriguing facts about each scene as it plays.
I:8493;2191;An incredible package of extras that seems to be unparalleled by almost any other film release to date.
I:8493;2192;The price is right, too.
I:8493;2193;That way you have a general idea what the characters are saying, and can pick up a lot of vocabulary.
I:8493;2194;This is, without a doubt, the greatest film ever made.
I:8493;2195;Endlessly inventive, creative, dazzling and hilarious.
I:8493;2196;"It offers up two of the greatest scenes in cinema: jack rabbit slims dance, and ""adrenaline shot."""
I:8493;2197;Well, I think, Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest movies ever made, not only because of what I call funny brutality (like blowing someones head away without even wanting to) but of its' cool dialogues and even cooler characters.
I:8493;2198;I have owned this movie for years, someone bought it for me as a gift and just yesterday I watched it for the first time.
I:8493;2199;This film was so wonderful!
I:8493;2200;The dialogue was genius, John Travolta and Samuel L. Jakcson made a great on.
I:8493;2201;I can't put into words how great this movie was.
I:8493;2202;This movie's blend of sharp, witty dialogue interspersed with philososphical and social commentary, is an example of Taratino at his best.
I:8493;2203;The characters are unique and well personified by each actor in his or her respective role.
I:8493;2204;I would watch it again just for all the memorable one.
I:8493;2205;But make sure it's widescreen.
I:8493;2206;There are some scenes with Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) that are best viewed in widescreen.
I:8493;2207;The ending scene HAS to be the best scene in any movie EVER!
I:8493;2208;some of the best ever in any movie.
I:8493;2209;It's the first time I watch a movie with amazing ratings and so boring.
I:8493;2210;If you play the chapters in this order, you will clearly see that Pulp Fiction is a Tales from the Crypt type of storytelling.
I:8493;2211;And also check my review of Reservoir Dogs for the chronological order of the chapters.
I:8493;2212;I thought it was a little long (which it is) and I didn't appreciate the awesome dialogue or how well the film is crafted.
I:8493;2213;And especially interesting after seeing a movie like Django to compare it with Tarantino's other stuff.
I:8493;2214;Tarantino's only accomplishment is that he steals most of the techniques from much better Hong Kong directors and inserts some of his unique dialogue.
I:8493;2215;I think this is the best of his movies.
I:8493;2216;I have this on VHS, it was one of the movies, I had to re.
I:8493;2217;It's a grand journey .
I:8493;2218;"cheek hilarity of Tarantino's colorful and endlessly quotable screenplay (""I'm gonna get medieval on yo' a$$"")."
I:8493;2219;Submerged in director Tarantino's deep love of film, it plays like a gift to cinephiles of all ages that thankfully never fumbles into parody or blatant tribute.
I:8493;2220;This is probably my favorite movie ever, so I'm admittedly a biased reviewer.
I:8493;2221;There are so many quotable lines.
I:8493;2222;But if you don't mind a generous sprinkling of f. bombs, some on screen violence, and clearly adult themes, this is a fantastic movie.
I:8493;2223;This movie has the best lines.
I:8493;2224;This movie is a classic.
I:8493;2225;The actors, the music, how it captures the comic book.
I:8493;2226;like effect, the shock, the zone it puts you in.
I:8493;2227;but I'm definitely keeping it now!
I:8493;2228;I did see similarities with Trainspotting, with all the drug taking, and Quentin Tarantino had a certain je ne sais pourquoi about his directing.
I:8493;2229;I loved how when he was first introducing characters, he only showed them from behind, and all you could see was hair (Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames .
I:8493;2230;It's amazing how you've never seen a movie before (honest) but you know it instantly about the soundtrack!
I:8493;2231;And then the film really kicked off, and I found myself enjoying it.
I:8493;2232;And it has some great music in it (guess what I'll be getting next?)
I:8493;2233;"I found myself humming along to ""Let's Get Together"" by Marvin Gaye (mainly cos it was used in another movie, Down To You), so I definitely think this soundtrack will be great."
I:8493;2234;I was in fits throughout the rest of the film .
I:8493;2235;It's such a funny image.
I:8493;2236;the person I was most shocked to see in this movie was Bruce Willis!
I:8493;2237;I definitely would have seen it long ago!
I:8493;2238;He was quite sexy in it, apart from where he was first introduced .
I:8493;2239;he never moved a muscle, and looked a real hard nut.
I:8493;2240;He was definitely a cutie in this.
I:8493;2241;the most memorable moment from the whole film (apart from Bruce Willis coming out of the shower .
I:8493;2242;It's what I know it for, and that's the tiny dance segment between John Travolta and Uma Thurman.
I:8493;2243;Funny how Uma shakes her pretty black bob a lot during this, but it there's never a hair out of place .
I:8493;2244;see, although try and replace Johnny Boy with the guy he was in Grease.
I:8493;2245;Always a good time killer!
I:8493;2246;Having seen it many times I can still sit and watch it once a year.
I:8493;2247;Now I know the catch phrase about Quarter Pounders and some of the various other cultural references that I see that come from the movie.
I:8493;2248;the movie wasn't completely predictable and had quirky characters, so maybe that made the movie refreshing to many.
I:8493;2249;I am frankly boggled why it is so popular or won so many awards.
I:8493;2250;I can watch it a million time.
I:8493;2251;i have seen many movies but this makes the top five.
I:8493;2252;it is so juicy, so entertaning, so mezmerizing, so hilarious and so damn cool, its a full blown movie section its self.
I:8493;2253;this is defenatly Tarantino's block buster film that made him into the director he is.
I:8493;2254;its all jigsawed up and it takes you a couple to times wacthing it to get the picture but its still entertaining.
I:8493;2255;so if you want to see the 1990's movie that brought back the story telling gernes like the godfather, bonnie and clyde, the exorcist, and ben hur, then go see pulp fiction, one of the greatest movies made.
I:8493;2256;The amount of greatness that comes out of this film is undescribable.
I:8493;2257;All performances are to die for, and the drug overdose scene was a classic.
I:8493;2258;This movie keeps getting better with time, the fact that its in Blu Ray really caught my attention.
I:8493;2259;I have always liked this movie.
I:8493;2260;I is very will written.
I:8493;2261;Pulp Fiction is one of the most perfect films I have ever sat down to watch.
I:8493;2262;The dialogue is awesome, and the directing is awesome.
I:8493;2263;This just happens to be my 2nd favorite movie of all.
I:8493;2264;The plot unfolds itself perfectly.
I:8493;2265;This is a true masterpiece due to Quentin Tarantino's direction.
I:8493;2266;It has great action, great humor, and great suspense.
I:8493;2267;This is a movie classic, I love Uma, John, Samuel, and even Bruce.
I:8493;2268;The story line is quirky and funny, the appearance by Quinton is cute.
I:8493;2269;Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that has that timeless qaulity that will have people watching it 30 year's from now, and it will still have the same effect on those people that it has on people now.
I:8493;2270;It is an abosolute masterpeice of experimental/independant cinema, extremely ahead of it's time, and mile's away from what anyone was doing at the time.
I:8493;2271;Quentin Tarantino is a director with his own original style that could never be replicated or imitated, and you can't say that much about director's anymore.
I:8493;2272;the great thing for me about Pulp Fiction is how it play's out as a modern day exploitation film.
I:8493;2273;a** action movie's from that era.
I:8493;2274;As a big fan of those film's myself it was great to see a modern.
I:8493;2275;day filmmaker incorporate those influences in a new way ,and I applaud him for doing so.
I:8493;2276;of course one of Tarantino's trademark's is his great use of dioluge.
I:8493;2277;It's refreshing to hear the character's in a movie actually talk like real people would talk.
I:8493;2278;It say's a lot that a director can make an amazing movie without abundant amount's of flashy editing and special effect's.
I:8493;2279;overall Pulp Fiction is an amazing, and most importantly, original masterpiece of experimental cinema that will continue to 'wow' viewer's for year's and year's to come.
I:8493;2280;Anyone who has seen the Kill Bill movies can understand Tarrantino's style.
I:8493;2281;I have seen the movie 4 times and seem to pick up something new about it each time I see it.
I:8493;2282;I think this is the quintessential movie.
I:8493;2283;"Travolta and Jackson are superb as lackeys
I:8493;2284;The whole cast is amazing, the script is amazing, and I could watch this ten times over in one day!
I:8493;2285;What a great movie I hope this helps you with the story.
I:8493;2286;Tarintino is a master just like Scorsese and Spielberg.
I:8493;2287;this one is a winner and I liked the whole ride it brought and people know it brought back the careers of Bruce Willis and John Travolta.
I:8493;2288;the intense is dynomite and its enjoyable.
I:8493;2289;And with a cast that included John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis, how could it go wrong?As for strengths, Travolta's Vincent and Jackson's portrayal as Jules are first rate, as are performances by virtually all of the first.
I:8493;2290;the movie is a must.
I:8493;2291;Words cannot express how much I love this movie, but I will try my best.
I:8493;2292;Pulp Fiction is one of my favorites.
I:8493;2293;Quentin Tarantino is a very gifted director/writer.
I:8493;2294;released in a fully loaded special edition.
I:8493;2295;"the acting is more than superb
I:8493;2296;Tarantino is a master when it comes to writing and directing.
I:8493;2297;"I have said it before, and I will say it again
I:8493;2298;Tons of special features, and not to forget the fact that the movie has been restored in high definition.
I:8493;2299;And the sound is also a lot better.
I:8493;2300;You can watch the movie in DTS, which is always a good thing.
I:8493;2301;There's a ton of them!
I:8493;2302;And every one of them is great.
I:8493;2303;If you haven't seen it yet, check it out when you can!
I:8493;2304;That's fine, nothing wrong with that.
I:8493;2305;"Filled with sharp humor, great characters, outstanding dialogue, and some of the craziest surprises and twists, ""Pulp Fiction"" is a wonderful film, and will continue to be one of my favorites."
I:8493;2306;Classic movie, Quentin Tarantino is a genius.
I:8493;2307;One of his very best works, multiple plot lines that all seamlessly tie together.
I:8493;2308;Well, he's good in this movie anyway.
I:8493;2309;I was pleasantly surprised how wonderful and entertaining this movie was.
I:8493;2310;Made me on the edge of my seat cracking up the whole time!
I:8493;2311;this movie is awesome and the Blu.
I:8493;2312;if, on the other hand, you'd like to experience some of the most brilliant (and arguably some the most genuine) dialogue in movie history, Pulp Fiction is a classic.
I:8493;2313;This is an excellent movie.
I:8493;2314;The actors bring robust life to their roles and create memorable and quirky characters.
I:8493;2315;The writing is original and innovative.
I:8493;2316;The most impressive aspect of the film is how the director effectively breaks the usual convention (dating back to Aristotle's Poetics) of having a linear beginning, middle and end.
I:8493;2317;This movie , in my opinion , may be the best all around film ever .
I:8493;2318;Also , so many aspects of it are perfect from the script , to the casting .
I:8493;2319;The camera work and production are equally as brilliant .
I:8493;2320;Tarantino did a great job at bringing the gritty world of drug dealers and other social scum into middle America's living room .
I:8493;2321;Career making performances by Uma Thurman and Ving Rhames .
I:8493;2322;An intelligent action movie with complex characters, non linear story telling, and surprising plot twists.
I:8493;2323;If you are a fan of Tarantino's work, then you know that this is by far his best writing and directing.
I:8493;2324;One reason I love this movie so much is the all star cast.
I:8493;2325;From Jackson's thoughts on religion and retirment, to Willis' thoughts on his father's gold watch, the acting is great.
I:8493;2326;I fell in love with the way that Tarantino directs and the way that he writes.
I:8493;2327;The way the movie jumps around back and fourth, and then at the end all comes together I think is genius.
I:8493;2328;"If you want to see something like you have never seen before, give this movie a try, and if you are like me, it will give new meaning to the term ""great movie""."
I:8493;2329;This is Quentin Terantino's finest work.
I:8493;2330;Pulp Fiction is in a class of its own as regards the body of his work.
I:8493;2331;It holds up over time extremely well, and is far above the remainder of his self.
I:8493;2332;"centric work, including the ""Kill Bill"" fantasy volumes."
I:8493;2333;i would enjoy this movie on the basis of the performance given by Samuel L. Jackson alone.
I:8493;2334;"You'll see a ""young"" Tim Roth, joined by a cast that has, to their credit, gone on to do even finer work."
I:8493;2335;In the gangster genre, this is a must see that stands with other classics.
I:8493;2336;Pulp Fiction is a rare and well executed glimpse into the world of 'small time' organized crime.
I:8493;2337;It has has qualities beyond those found in comparable films.
I:8493;2338;"disc Collector's Edition"" replacement product will give you the full content of this older version."
I:8493;2339;"this movie is very well done, and stands with others of its genre such as ""GoodFellas"", ""Casino"", etc."
I:8493;2340;I do so without filling the screen vertically, without difficulty.
I:8493;2341;this is one of my all time favorite movies.
I:8493;2342;An all star cast delivers for non stop action and suspense.
I:8493;2343;A well written, well acted movie.
I:8493;2344;I enjoy all the little funny things as well as some of the drama as well.
I:8493;2345;pulp Fiction is great movie full of action, some suspense, and often downright hilarious in parts as Quentin Terrantino, Harvey Keitel, and Christopher Walken all make appearances.
I:8493;2346;an exciting story combines with some real acting star power talent to make for a great movie.
I:8493;2347;I appreciate the work that QT does and I'm just thrilled to own this.
I:8493;2348;John's dancing is the best.
I:8493;2349;creates a new approch to film presentation.
I:8493;2350;Blu Ray brings these movies to life, especially if you have a good surround sound system.
I:8493;2351;When it debuted it was something new and fresh.
I:8493;2352;I enjoy this movie the same every time I watch it.
I:8493;2353;so finally in closing I'd like to exuberantly add, mmmmmm this is a tasty movie, if it's ever on television check it out sometime.
I:8493;2354;Uma Thurmond's role was the best part of the movie.
I:8493;2355;I love this movie!All the actors are great in it.
I:8493;2356;then it has succeeded in entertaining you.
I:8493;2357;A bloody good movie .
I:8493;2358;well worth the cheap price!
I:8493;2359;In a word it is perfect!!
I:8493;2360;Great acting, great story and of course who can forget the Tarantino diaologe.
I:8493;2361;Works flawlessly in my Region 1 player.
I:8493;2362;One of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8493;2363;I admit I fell asleep the first two times I tried watching, but I kept hearing how good the movie is.
I:8493;2364;Third time I tried, I got to the middle.
I:8493;2365;I got this for a huge Pulp Fiction fan for Christmas.
I:8493;2366;Politically incorrect and very funny.
I:8493;2367;I guess what makes Tarantino interesting is that his excess in violence is augmented by goodly amounts of humor and wit.
I:8493;2368;Their business is strong arming people and killing them if necessary.
I:8493;2369;It's graphic but hilarious at the same time.
I:8493;2370;She goes into convulsions, so Vincent takes her to his dealer where the famous scene where they inject adrenaline directly into her heart takes place.
I:8493;2371;The detail is finely honed, right down to Jules' (Jackson) wallet in the final scene.
I:8493;2372;Watching this movie 18 years after its release, I'm still entertained and exhilarated.
I:8493;2373;this single disc Blu ray has an excellent 2.35:1 video transfer and a DTS.
I:8493;2374;It was neat to show this to my son and he recognized many references.
I:8493;2375;So impressed and happy with this service.
I:8493;2376;An outstanding movie, if you are looking for a good performance, perfect argument.
I:8493;2377;After watching and loving Kill Bill: Volume 1, I made Pulp Fiction a priority to see.
I:8493;2378;There are so many things I love about this movie I'm afraid this review won't do it justice.
I:8493;2379;If you've seen Kill Bill and enjoyed it, you'll most likely enjoy this 1000 times more.
I:8493;2380;the plot is perfect in every way.
I:8493;2381;I can't say enough nice things about this movie, it's amazing.
I:8493;2382;The film is also darkly funny, I found the hardest I laughed was at Christopher Walken's brief appearance, which ties into my next point.
I:8493;2383;the cast of this movie is awesome.
I:8493;2384;John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis all give great performances, as do all of the rest of the cast who play smaller parts.
I:8493;2385;A movie is always better when you like the entire cast, and when everyone in the cast just seems to fit well together.
I:8493;2386;the movie is also characterized the the music, the cinematography, and the overall raw feel that it has.
I:8493;2387;I loved every second of it.
I:8493;2388;It has such energy and passion, you just can't help but stare at it.
I:8493;2389;Because of Pulp Fiction, I think of Quentin Tarantino has earned a place on the list of Best Directors of All Time .
I:8493;2390;As soon as this Miramax Collector's Edition graced the department store shelves, I knew I had to have this one also.
I:8493;2391;There is a portion called the Tarantino Generation which is very interesting to all Quentin Tarantino fans.
I:8493;2392;"Pulp Fiction also has a message ""What a lark crime can be!"""
I:8493;2393;Pulp Fiction is a great / somewhat funny movie to have in your collection.
I:8493;2394;I liked this movie for a long time.
I:8493;2395;Amazing classic that never disappoints.
I:8493;2396;With a dialogue that you want to quote every day.
I:8493;2397;This movie is absolutely fantastic.
I:8493;2398;Brilliance in acting all the way, sensational writting and directing by Tarantino, everything about it is perfect.
I:8493;2399;stanley Kubrick created the non.
I:8493;2400;linear time movie with his masterpiece, The Killing.
I:8493;2401;He took each scene to its conclusion.
I:8493;2402;The film jumps back and forth in time with no reason.
I:8493;2403;The one thing is that most people who loved the film usually are talking about all the graphic violence not the plot.
I:8493;2404;This is another case of critics wanting to create a new star (and in their own way become the one who discovered him.)
I:8493;2405;the one good thing in this film was a stellar performance by Samuel L Jackson.
I:8493;2406;He is one of those actors that Hollywood doesn't know what to do with and he once again shows his great talent.
I:8493;2407;If you want to see a great action pact film with great style then get Kubrick's The Killing, Danny Boyle's Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie's Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrells.
I:8493;2408;In my opinion Pulp Fiction is one of Quentin Tarantino's best movies.
I:8493;2409;Samuel L Jackson superb in a film written by a superb script writer.
I:8493;2410;John Travolta gets his career going again after a bad spell and prooves he is a cool dude.
I:8493;2411;Must be seen and most important of all must be bought as this one is a clasic
I:8493;2412;A must have for someone who loves film.
I:8493;2413;I watch it at least once a year.
I:8493;2414;In less than a decade, 'Pulp Fiction' has become a cult classic, making many people's top ten films of all time.
I:8493;2415;Not only was it a highly impressive second feature but it made Quentin Tarantino a real big Hollywood player (especially after the fantastic 'Reservoir Dogs') and it didn't just ressurect John Travolta's career but it made him cool again.
I:8493;2416;There's countless moments in it to treasure, many of which have even become famous, especially Travolta and Jackson's conversation about the Royale with cheese.
I:8493;2417;Cult movie fans should also be acquainted with the debate over what really was in that suitcase: diamonds, a human soul or even a Royale with cheese!The story has three basic threads .
I:8493;2418;The cast itself is formidable, with Thurman and Travolta being especially good.
I:8493;2419;The truth is, this grips you from start to finish, and proves beyond doubt that Quentin Tarantino is a force to be reckoned with.
I:8493;2420;It is region free and works without any issues on my Panasonic DMP.
I:8493;2421;Best thing to do is let the movie start then after the first menu let it run and select the options for no subtitles and English audio from your remote.
I:8493;2422;Then you are good to go.
I:8493;2423;Details are sharp and clean.
I:8493;2424;"The part with the needle has a realistic ""thump"" to say the least."
I:8493;2425;sure its coming out in August but for an all time favorite movie of mine getting it 9 months in advance is worth it.
I:8493;2426;Quentin Tarantino's best film ever, The cast are all good, the story line is great and Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) is very fetching indeed.
I:8493;2427;'Pulp Fiction' is responsible for giving new life to a few actors careers and having completely set a new standard for modern films.
I:8493;2428;The film is filled with rich dialogue and performances.
I:8493;2429;a neat 3 story line ingeniously woven into an unforgettable movie.
I:8493;2430;If you haven't seen it you have missed one of the best films of the last 20 years.
I:8493;2431;the two discs set sports an excellent transfer and has a ton of great extras including commentary, on screen facts, excellent deleted scenes explained on screen by Tarantino, trailers, TV spots, Siskel and Ebert show devoted to Tarantino, Charlie Rose show devoted to Tarantino, on the set documentary, feature.
I:8493;2432;What can you say about such a terrific movie?
I:8493;2433;Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta were amazing in this film.
I:8493;2434;It also helped me to see the story the way real life events happen, by happening with no seemingly connection to one another but upon closer inspection everything is connected.
I:8493;2435;Certainly worth watching one or two times but I wouldn't call it a classic.
I:8493;2436;Pulp Fiction is awesome of course .
I:8493;2437;So many great characters and wonderful lines .
I:8493;2438;A lot of my friends are Quentin Tarantino fans and I finally decided to watch one of his movies and see what all the fuss is about.
I:8493;2439;It made all those strands meet together with an extremely satisfying click.
I:8493;2440;tarantino has done it again.
I:8493;2441;This movie truly lives up to that monicker.
I:8493;2442;It's definitely not the mainstream movie that most seminal classics are, but it has a beauty, an identity, and a stroke of mental manipulation (i. e. direction) that I have never seen, and we may never see again.
I:8493;2443;The mainstream will be confused by this movie, but those of us who engage in storytelling know what this epic did to the world.
I:8493;2444;Pulp Fiction is a classic for all Tarantino fans.
I:8493;2445;All star cast with great performances.
I:8493;2446;There is NOTHING going on at all.
I:8493;2447;Everything about it from start to finish is great.
I:8493;2448;one of my favorite movies of all time!
I:8493;2449;Have watched the movie several times already and decided I want to own it so I can watch it again from time to time.
I:8493;2450;Something original is much more preferred in my taste.
I:8493;2451;This is a GREAT movie, by the way, one of the best.
I:8493;2452;Such a good movie, I laughed, was nervous, sad, and there were some gun scenes.
I:8493;2453;If you haven't seen it, I recommend you do!
I:8493;2454;"The reason you need to see it twice
I:8493;2455;It has some pretty intense stuff.
I:8493;2456;It's still a good movie, fun to watch with anybody.
I:8493;2457;this film has it's moments and has some snappy dialogue but there is absolutely nothing original in it.
I:8493;2458;PULP FICTION is the sort of tale right up Quentin Tarantino's dark alley of a fictional mind.
I:8493;2459;"laced dialog with such effortless ease that it seems perfectly natural after the first five minutes to hear the ""f"" word and the ""n"" word spoken with regularity by a very competent cast of actors."
I:8493;2460;It's all done in brisk, good story.
I:8493;2461;telling style to keep the viewer interested throughout the two.
I:8493;2462;uMA THURMAN has delicious fun with the role of a gangster's moll who sniffs a little too much white powder in the ladies room while on a date with JOHN TRAVOLTA.
I:8493;2463;The two of them get a chance to demonstrate their prowess with romantic comedy in this wonderful sequence where they go to a '50s.
I:8493;2464;They also indulge in a twist dance contest which, naturally, they win.
I:8493;2465;it's the lightest moment in a film with plenty of dark twists and unpredictable shoot.
I:8493;2466;"HARVEY KEITEL has a fine time with the role of a ""cleaner."
I:8493;2467;BRUCE WILLIS is excellent as a boxer who fails to lose the match and has to go on the lam to escape the wrath of a crime boss.
I:8493;2468;Despite the disturbing scenes of violence, it manages to be a highly entertaining mix of crime and comedy that keeps rolling along toward a satisfying ending in the diner where the first scene involving TIM ROTH and AMANDA PLUMMER took place.
I:8493;2469;summing up: More likely to have broadest appeal for young male viewers who like their crime stories raw, real and unpredictable.
I:8493;2470;Original, inventive and understandably awarded a great many honors when released.
I:8493;2471;"Tarantino assembled one of the finest casts ever envisioned, and bracnhes the film into seperate yet interwoven stories
I:8493;2472;All in all, Pulp Fiction is a modern day American classic that will make you laugh your head off while your not asking yourself Did I just see (or hear) that?!
I:8493;2473;When I first saw Pulp Fiction, I knew that it was definetely going to be a modern day classic which I think it has turned into .
I:8493;2474;This movie is simply amazing.
I:8493;2475;I also love the soundtrack.
I:8493;2476;Quentin Tarantino is so talented.
I:8493;2477;I would love to meet that guy.
I:8493;2478;connected story is cleverly constructed, and the characters are so quirky that the movies flies by.
I:8493;2479;I'm a big fan of Tarantino.
I:8493;2480;Loved Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill.
I:8493;2481;And the stories were very good.
I:8493;2482;directed, and interwoven in a very interesting way.
I:8493;2483;So, all in all, a very good movie.
I:8493;2484;Many, many great PARTS to this movie.
I:8493;2485;Better than most stuff out there.
I:8493;2486;This is probably the best action film ever, Travolta's best acting.
I:8493;2487;Some pretty crazy stuff went down in this movie and that's what made it awesomely amazingly entertaining and fascinating.
I:8493;2488;Watched with a bunch of friends and we all were surprised how much we enjoyed it.
I:8493;2489;men (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson) and their dark adventures entertaining their boss' drug.
I:8493;2490;"One of these partners is a prize fighter (Bruce Willis), who actually wins a fight when he, well, wins a fight
I:8493;2491;What ultimately redeems this film and, in fact, raises it above the league of most commercial movies is that it is so well crafted and audacious in its approach that it stands as a uniquely fresh masterpiece in American cinema.
I:8493;2492;One of my favorite and most innovative shots, for instance, involves the Bruce Willis character's conversation with Jackson and Travolta's boss (Ving Rhames).
I:8493;2493;hip, and sometimes, revivalist choices.
I:8493;2494;Of course, this `retro' philosophy is echoed in the casting choices that are made in his films, as we note that Pulp Fiction breathed new life into John Travolta's screen career, while tapping also new talents, such as those of Samuel L. Jackson.
I:8493;2495;the clever dialogue, the rarefied violence, the retro soundtracks, and the unconventional story arches present us with a bold, new vision for movie making.
I:8493;2496;pULP FICTION is the best effort so far that Tarantino has made to challenge and invigorate the cinematic arts in America.
I:8493;2497;Every scene in this movie is powerful enough to stand on its own.
I:8493;2498;Great acting by everyone involved and a great script that allowed all actors to rome as free as their acting skills could take them.
I:8493;2499;The 1st story involves two hitmen, played by John Travolta (his ONLY good movie), and Samuel L. Jackson (the man).
I:8493;2500;After that, a series of simple, yet really cool plot points follow, with some truly disturbing scenes.
I:8493;2501;Also, Harvey Keitel is in his best role since Mean Streets, and almost steals the show.
I:8493;2502;Great movie, great soundtrack, just great.
I:8493;2503;With a cast of John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis, it would be hard to beat this movie in any shape or form.
I:8493;2504;All you really have to do is see that Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed it, and you would know it was a winner.
I:8493;2505;If you like the Kill Bill series, you will definitely love this movie.
I:8493;2506;One of my favorite movies.
I:8493;2507;Although i have only seen pulp fiction once (i have not owned it long) I still love and talk about some of the funny lines.
I:8493;2508;Pulp Fiction has multiple plots that intertwine within each other and still has the classic Tarantino Flashbacks.
I:8493;2509;His boss gets angry with him so he gets one of his men, John Travolta to kill Bruce Willis but things dont work out so well.
I:8493;2510;After eating at Jack Rabbit Slim's, she gets into his heroine and has an overdose.
I:8493;2511;Good jokes, good acting, and a good story make Pulp Fiction a sure fire hit.
I:8493;2512;It's movies like Pulp Fiction that glorifies sensless violence and portrays it as something funny.
I:8493;2513;The movie's full of them, and each one of these scenes is it's own little masterpiece that can exist outside the movie.
I:8493;2514;They are, in fact, their own short films inside a bigger film.
I:8493;2515;And THAT'S why this movie is so great.
I:8493;2516;keeping an audience interested is one thing.
I:8493;2517;I can't imagine anyone hasn't seen it by now, and if you have, you know it's fantastic.
I:8493;2518;oh and of course Natural born killers Quentin Tarantino is my favorite!
I:8493;2519;I was watching it with a friend of mine and we both haven't seen this movie in about 5 years.
I:8493;2520;When the film is so vivid, you notice more things on the set and hear sounds you never noticed.
I:8493;2521;I appreciate this film more than ever.
I:8493;2522;tarantino is an amazing director/ producer.
I:8493;2523;He is truly a genius.
I:8493;2524;The entire cast is perfect.
I:8493;2525;One of the all time great movies!
I:8493;2526;Superb cast and director, all at their prime.
I:8493;2527;Soundtrack is terrific as well.
I:8493;2528;A classic movie from Tarantino.
I:8493;2529;It was worth the effort.
I:8493;2530;pulp Ficton is a great movie that tells the tale of two hitmen, a boxer, and a mob bosses wife and the things that happen to them over the course of a day.
I:8493;2531;If you look at it as a film by itself, it is a great movie.
I:8493;2532;If you look at it as a revolutionary work of art, well it's still a great movie.
I:8493;2533;many people have listed PULP FICTION's merits: awesome cast, outstanding dialogue, the way Quentin Tarantino was able to put this together for such a low budget.
I:8493;2534;Seeing their dialogue at the end puts everything in a whole new light and gives viewers a whole new perspective.
I:8493;2535;He made a good film and it should judged for itself.
I:8493;2536;I have to write this if only to honor one of the most influential films of our times.
I:8493;2537;tarantino is one of my most favorite directors, from schlock to high art.
I:8493;2538;If you haven't seen pulp fiction, next to maybe reservoir dogs, this is one of his greatest films.
I:8493;2539;And i have seen almost all of them.
I:8493;2540;cast film with a multifaceted plot that is carried incredibly well both in writing, direction, and performance.
I:8493;2541;Subtle humor, subtle horror, subtle redirection, this is The Film that made quentin tarantino a household name.
I:8493;2542;This is the film that made Samuel Jackson a legendary figure, revived John Travolta's career, and upgraded Uma Thurman to megastar status.
I:8493;2543;This is a wonderful vehicle for Bruce Willis.
I:8493;2544;This movie is pretty much a cult classic.
I:8493;2545;Anyone who is going out of their way to watch it 19 years after it was released is obviously a huge fan.
I:8493;2546;Unique movie, both in content and style.
I:8493;2547;There is much more to see.
I:8493;2548;The extra scenes at the end are a nice payoff.
I:8493;2549;As for the movie, I love it.
I:8493;2550;All the performances are right on track.
I:8493;2551;The soundtrack is also very nostalgic with surf music and oldies but goodies.
I:8493;2552;So go get this widescreen version, enjoy it with a Big Kahuna Burger and a tasty beverage.
I:8493;2553;I loved it back when it came out, and was waiting for a Special Edition to come out.
I:8493;2554;My patience was rewarded with the excellent two.
I:8493;2555;disc set that includes not just a great transfer of the film, but a boatload of interesting features.
I:8493;2556;Yes, there are some spectacular scenes of violence, but it's the scenes that rely on interaction between characters that are the most watchable.
I:8493;2557;The scene between Bruce Willis' Butch and the cab driver is facinating and provides deep looks into both personalities.
I:8493;2558;When Travolta and Sam Jackson, the hitmen, are talking before the apartment seen, the movie is all about the conversation and the people, with what they are about to do clearly not as important as who they are.
I:8493;2559;This dialogue style would be copied too many times in too many bad movies to count over the 90's, but here it still seems fresh.
I:8493;2560;The film is beautifully transferred on this disc, and remains a joy to watch.
I:8493;2561;the extras are great, too.
I:8493;2562;Deleted scens with commentary by Tarantino are included, documentaries and interviews, and an old episode of Siskel and Ebert called The Tarantino Generation is on the disc as well, examining the immediate impact of the film on the cinema world.
I:8493;2563;It's a facinating time capsule that reflects how influential the film was, and continues to be.
I:8493;2564;In Quentin Tarantino's critically acclaimed movie, Pulp Fiction, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and John Travolta do something to someone while trying to get some money for their boss.
I:8493;2565;They spend the movie carrying around a briefcase with something that lights up inside of it.
I:8493;2566;There are some very entertaining exchanges of dialogue between Jackson and Travolta and some great cinematography, but for the most part I have to say I am not a big fan of Pulp Ficton.
I:8493;2567;Of course, on the flipside, maybe this is the brilliance of the movie.
I:8493;2568;i would at least watch this movie once just to be able to discuss it with other people, but I would borrow it from a friend.
I:8493;2569;great movie with stand for all time this is one you can watch over and over again.
I:8493;2570;HiI love the Film Pulp fiction.
I:8493;2571;the Stories are so nteresting and exciting.
I:8493;2572;This one is for the vault of classic movies.
I:8493;2573;You watch it and watch it again and again and each time you'll hear or see something you didn't note in your earlier viewings.
I:8493;2574;This movie keeps you entertain from the very beginning to the end.
I:8493;2575;Im not normally into the constant violance no real plot kind of gangster movies but this one along with reservoir dogs and Jackie Brown (maybe a few others) differ from that genre as there is always a well plotted story line to follow and the gangster scene has been really carefully crafted.
I:8493;2576;I'm not a huge fan of Tarantino in all honesty, but this movie is one of those films that simply 'works' on every level.
I:8493;2577;The Blu Ray version of this is fantastic.
I:8493;2578;The music is crystal clear and the image is sharp.
I:8493;2579;for about of the movie, you just have to take it on faith that the seemingly random bits of action are eventually going to merge and make some sense .
I:8493;2580;There are such spectacular, tongue.
I:8493;2581;In addition to Willis, you've got Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, Amanda Plummer, etc. unbelievably terrific quirky wacko wild and wooly violent (yeah, it is violent) nutso twisted corrupt wicked hilarious top dog of a movie.
I:8493;2582;night success for this, his breakthrough tale of irony and fate that effects the lives of a few distinct characters over a period of two days.
I:8493;2583;movie' script and morphed it's bold stories into 'Pulp Fiction'.
I:8493;2584;"a drama/Mystery Crime epic that made several actors synonymous with success
I:8493;2585;Lead by one of America's most beloved actors, John Travolta, this film uses it's audiences' imagination and memory to commit the convictions and events of the lives of these characters to their utmost importance.
I:8493;2586;This hitman is endulging in his day.
I:8493;2587;This friendship/partnership to me subtly pays homage to the partnerships of buddy.
I:8493;2588;cop triumphs of the past on screen, and it's power is broken wide open by a gripping character.
I:8493;2589;The circle of these characters, binded by completely separate conflicts, loops itself in this brilliant screenplay so as to make every action and recourse of one scene relevant to the next.
I:8493;2590;I have for years admired not only the beautifully delivered performances by John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Ving Rhames in this film, but more so Tarantino's unique piecing.
I:8493;2591;Films like 'Pulp Fiction' must be extremely difficult to make, and for Tarantino to use this method of direction and writing, is the overwhelming successful technique that makes it stand out among look.
I:8493;2592;I love Rock Star movies like these.
I:8493;2593;All movies by Quentin Tarantino are amazing I do reccomend this to anyone
I:8493;2594;Quentin Tarantino isn't for everyone, but his material is definitely my kind of entertainment.
I:8493;2595;This is the one that just expanded his popularity, and he remains one of a kind.
I:8493;2596;He makes movies for himself and those that love movies.
I:8493;2597;With as great as dialogue as is here, it just breezes by.
I:8493;2598;That aspect continues on every one of his movies.
I:8493;2599;"Now, he makes movies that challenges the norm in Hollywood and hangs out with fellow ""kick."
I:8493;2600;And of all his movies, I like Pulp Fiction the best.
I:8493;2601;a$$ (pick a word, they're all suitable) but this movie really blew me away with its unique storytelling, superb performances and witty dialogue.
I:8493;2602;Watch it and you'll understand.
I:8493;2603;It may sound unusual but it all adds up to make a surprisingly entertaining movie.
I:8493;2604;as I said, there are many things I loved about this movie, but something that really stands out is the screenplay.
I:8493;2605;At the time, it was considered to be new and refreshing, and I can see why.
I:8493;2606;Watching the movie more than 10 times, I realize something.
I:8493;2607;Tell me, how many people can pull of talking about burgers in Amsterdam sound cool and intelligent.
I:8493;2608;The thing you notice immediately is the passion involved in the movie.
I:8493;2609;It's a huge gamble, but it works.
I:8493;2610;and the fact that Tarantino got a whole bunch of talented people to appear in Pulp Fiction, speaks for itself.
I:8493;2611;John Travolta delivers one of his best performances, launching back his career to an all.
I:8493;2612;Samuel L. Jackson is also superb in his role.
I:8493;2613;"The rest of the cast
I:8493;2614;all give very convincing performances that the movie comes alive and I guess making it so much more than what it set out to be.
I:8493;2615;it very well deserves to be.
I:8493;2616;Considered historic in American cinema, I for one, recommend it wholeheartedly.
I:8493;2617;Pulp Fiction is Quentin Tarantino's perfect masterpiece, and is one of the most influential films of all time.
I:8493;2618;The film also garnerd alot of awards, including: Best Picture at the Independant Spirit Awards, as well as plenty of other wins, and best original screenplay at the Oscars.
I:8493;2619;It also got nominated for six other awards at the oscars, including best picture, but lost out to Forrest Gump.
I:8493;2620;The reason why it influenced these, is for the seperate stories and the chronological orders of the films, like Memento is told backwards.
I:8493;2621;Tarantino is also a huge influence on Sin City director Robert Rodriguez, and worked together on many projects.
I:8493;2622;He starts saying that it's a tough job, because some of the shop owners don't understand a word they say, and some places are armed to the teeth for them.
I:8493;2623;They come down to an agreement, pull out their guns and hold up the place, and then the credits kick in.
I:8493;2624;"The lady is Mia Wallace(played by Uma Thurman), he takes her to place she wants to go to called ""Jack Rabbit Slim's"", and is a 50s pop culture restaurant with everything that is 1950's."
I:8493;2625;After he takes the watch from the man's hand a bell clings, we then realise Butch is having a dream and is going to fight in an important boxing match.
I:8493;2626;He makes a run for it and knows that Wallace will kill him if he finds him.
I:8493;2627;Butch has planned ahead, with his girlfriend supporting him, he has got to pick up alot of money he won due to the fight, and go get his watch that his girlfriend left behind at their old place.
I:8493;2628;It has everything a good crime film must have, suspense, humour, violence, and snappy dialogue.
I:8493;2629;The writing for the characters are just masterfully done, they talk like normal people would talk like on the way to work, or sitting at a restaurant, meanwhile they're crooks who, we see, are just doing another day's job.
I:8493;2630;The acting is also outstanding, with Tarantino's direction that bought out the very best the cast could give us.
I:8493;2631;The soundtrack is fantastic and makes the film the even more enjoyable.
I:8493;2632;the extra features are brilliant on this disc.
I:8493;2633;Finally got around to the second viewing.
I:8493;2634;it moved so fast the first time, I did not realize what I had missed.
I:8493;2635;planning to see this at least one more time.
I:8493;2636;This is one of the best movies that I watch over and over and never get tired of.
I:8493;2637;That, I think, is the most enduring legacy of this film.
I:8493;2638;The movie is as great as ever (though its asethetic has been so thorougly integrated in mainstream culture that much of what was amazing when the film originally appeared is now less impressive).
I:8493;2639;A unique perspective on an original Hollywood mind.
I:8493;2640;"EXCELLENT writing
I:8493;2641;tarantino has a style that is all his own and I would recommend that you watch this or any Tarantino picture.
I:8493;2642;A great treat with most Tarantino films is that he casts actors actresses that give acting its grandeur.
I:8493;2643;This film follows in the same tradition with GREAT performances by Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis, Jon Travolta, Uma Thurman, Christoper Walken, etc.
I:8493;2644;Pulp Fiction has a great cast to act one of the few modern day movies that has a screenplay that stands out above the movie itself.
I:8493;2645;Pulp Fiction is one of the best 100 films of all time.
I:8493;2646;Quentin Tarantino's classic take on the world through the eyes of two hit.
I:8493;2647;at the price Amazon is offering this at I bought several, one for my collection and a couple others as gifts for friends.
I:8493;2648;One of the among many good movie deals you will find here.
I:8493;2649;I thought the part towards the end with Harvey Keitel in it was great, yet some of the drug scenes were just not interesting.
I:8493;2650;Must be the atmosphere that Los Angeles brings to the movie making process and that it is the nicest place I have ever been to in this country.
I:8493;2651;Overall, the film is very popular and has a great cast to it.
I:8493;2652;Way strange, yet worth viewing.
I:8493;2653;But glad I did experience this movie once.
I:8493;2654;This is one of those films that just goes to show people will call you a genius if you do something original whether it's good or not.
I:8493;2655;Tarantino should be proud that he went from working as a cashier at Blockbuster video to a successful 90's flash in the pan director.
I:8493;2656;His success is classic proof that anyone can make it if they try hard enough.
I:8493;2657;He'd finally be perfectly cast and maybe then there might be a reason to laugh.
I:8493;2658;moving movie that doesn't come close to living up to its reputation as one of the best movies of all time.
I:8493;2659;A great movie with great acting and great music.
I:8493;2660;I have never had a movie with so much action, comedy, and genuine storytelling.
I:8493;2661;There is just so many quoteable parts in the movie, and so many amazing parts, that i can't even begin to put it down on paper.
I:8493;2662;protagonistic plot is excellent and enjoyable for layman and intellectual alike.
I:8493;2663;One of the first Tarantino movies I ever saw.
I:8493;2664;I was blown away by his directing and impressed with the unique story telling.
I:8493;2665;A Tarantino classic for sure.
I:8493;2666;One of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8493;2667;A great cast of actors that came together to make a hit under great direction.
I:8493;2668;It also had a profound stylistic influence.
I:8493;2669;It was a hip movie with sharp dialogue, graphic violence, cool soundtrack and intricate plotlines.
I:8493;2670;Mr. Tarantino was able to pull John Travolta out of a decade long funk and directed him to the finest performance of his career and one that garnered his second Academy Award nomination.
I:8493;2671;He also pushed Bruce Willis to a stellar performance that showed he was more than just an action hero.
I:8493;2672;The cast is first rate including a beguiling Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Eric Stolz, Rosanna Arquette and Christopher Walken.
I:8493;2673;The best performance of all is given by Samuel L. Jackson who is absolutely amazing.
I:8493;2674;forwards and twists and turns and some mysteries that are never revealed.
I:8493;2675;It is a rare film that is both stylish and full of substance.
I:8493;2676;a good grimey 3 tales of loyalty, crime, and betrayal.
I:8493;2677;stop thriller that'll keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:8493;2678;Hands down Quentin Tarantino's most popular movie (not saying his best that's up to the viewer to decide).
I:8493;2679;Being a great fan of all of Quentin's movies this is definitely no exception.
I:8493;2680;What made this movie so great?
I:8493;2681;Was it the large amount of colorful characters who played top notch in their environments and situations they found themselves in?
I:8493;2682;Was it the unforgetable and slick dialogue?
I:8493;2683;Was it the excellent selection of music?
I:8493;2684;Pulp Fiction arose in 1994 and is still recognized as one of the better films of the 90's.
I:8493;2685;It is a great movie that is a must see.
I:8493;2686;Great movie, really enjoy dinner sceen interaction between Travolta and Jackson.
I:8493;2687;Nothing good in the whole movie to talk about.
I:8493;2688;It was as funny and violent as I remembered.
I:8493;2689;this may be John Travolta's best role.
I:8493;2690;He is an actor I dislike intensely, but in this role I could overlook that.
I:8493;2691;He is Vincent Vega, a hit man who works for the mob.
I:8493;2692;The action is violent, the conversations hilarious, and the writing if this film one if the best.
I:8493;2693;Of course, the director, Quentin Tarantino is superb, and really he cannot outdo himself with another film.
I:8493;2694;we laughed and cringed our way through this film, and I thought, this needs to be seen on a regular basis!Highly Recommended.
I:8493;2695;I really have never felt this passionate about a movie before, as well as Quentin Tarantino himself.
I:8493;2696;"Your there in Jack Rabbit Slim's, chilling with Mia and Vincent, feeling the 50's ""wax museum with a pulse""."
I:8493;2697;His wide array of close up shots, tracking shots, and his knack for making facial expressions add to the characters believabiltiy really show that Tarantino knows how to direct.
I:8493;2698;His vision comes to full force when he's behind the camera.
I:8493;2699;the ensemble cast is one of my favorite and most memorable.
I:8493;2700;I didn't like Forest Gump but I feel that Tom Hanks was more accomplished, Uma Thurman wasn't quite the best, and Jackson faced tough competition from Martin Laundua from Ed Wood (another great performance from a great movie from that year).
I:8493;2701;John Travolta's sagging career got a great revival with his best role to date, and Thurman's classiness makes for a believable Mia Wallace.
I:8493;2702;loved characters in the Tarantino canon.
I:8493;2703;Christopher Walken's spot on portrayal as a veteran is significant despite his low screen time, and Bruce Willis's cementation as a bad @$$ mother_______ (no doubt from movies like Die Hard) rocks as well.
I:8493;2704;Lance is particulary well portrayed.
I:8493;2705;_________ Coen Brothers (the single most overrated film.
I:8493;2706;Oh please), or dialogue that's even remotely entertaining.
I:8493;2707;The characters themselves each talk in their own distinctive way, something that Roger Ebert himself noted.
I:8493;2708;The soundtrack is used in the best way possible, and the movie itself doesn't benefit for a score, silence falls when needed, and the right music captures the right mood of the movie perfectly, whatever mood it's in.
I:8493;2709;Some of the dances are iconic, as well as the instant classic twist scene, as you all know of.
I:8493;2710;But many moments are highlighted and burned into your mind with the music tracks.
I:8493;2711;The soundtrack proves that music beyond traditional film scores can, and do, highlight and create the exact same thing that traditinal film scores do so well.
I:8493;2712;It's not just meaning to be witty, it's just Tarantino's way of using music and what he chooses.
I:8493;2713;The two disc set is amazingly good, with a bevy of features and interesting articles (Roger Ebert especially).
I:8493;2714;but anyway, Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece, and what I mean by masterpiece is it's done by a master, in a masterful way, and I _________ mean that _______________!
I:8493;2715;Tarantino rarely disappoints and with a cast that you have in this movie you can't go wrong.
I:8493;2716;The price was great also.
I:8493;2717;Definitely get this if you are a Quentin Tarantino fan.
I:8493;2718;groovey and all the rest of the words hippies used in the 70's.
I:8493;2719;This is one if not the greatest film I've ever seen.
I:8493;2720;A breahtaking film by a hungry director Quentin Tarantino .
I:8493;2721;The characters in Pulp fiction are amazing.
I:8493;2722;All these characters are involved in one of three stories.
I:8493;2723;But Butch actually doesn't lose the fight, he wins it and steals the money.
I:8493;2724;My least favourite story, but it's still good.
I:8493;2725;The best story, funny, amusing and has a great climax.
I:8493;2726;So, if you're just a casual fan of films get this!
I:8493;2727;Thank you Mr. tarantino for this movie.
I:8493;2728;movie came quickly, great price, no damage, great movie over all really enjoyed it.
I:8493;2729;It is one of those movies that you need to watch at least 2 times to understand .
I:8493;2730;this is one of the best modern day movies, has a great cast.
I:8493;2731;john Travolta and Samuel Jackson are excellent together, there gangsters and Samuel Jackson spells out bible verses and the shoots people.
I:8493;2732;another movie that as a superior cast.
I:8493;2733;Harvey Keitel is the cleaner and his part was great.
I:8493;2734;The U. s. release will look similar to this disc unless Disney creates a new master.
I:8493;2735;One of the best movies of all time.
I:8493;2736;the humor content is very subtle and well thought out.you actually have to think about what puchlines are spread throughout the movie, such as Jules's wrath at having to pick up brain instead of Vinces, or the constant reminder of how good Jimmy's coffee is.
I:8493;2737;Best movie out there from Quetin Tarantino.
I:8493;2738;the coversations are epic and action rocks, cant get enough of it kapooya
I:8493;2739;gore with great writing, direction, sets, and actors.
I:8493;2740;This is a movie made by a man with own sense of style who told Hollywood I'll make it the way I want to!
I:8493;2741;I loved this movie the first time i saw it.
I:8493;2742;Samuel Jackson, Bruce Willis, John Travolta, and Quentin Tarantino really put up a good show on this one.
I:8493;2743;Stellar performances by the then newcomers Samuel L. Jackson, Ving Rhames and others.
I:8493;2744;"Yes, John Travolta and Samuel Jackson do marvelous jobs, which is especially interesting for Travolta as his early entry into being ""bad"" (his later entries were less convincing)."
I:8493;2745;blooded business man, compassionate, woman.
I:8493;2746;The editing and sound are excellent (I also bought the soundtrack, but it includes too much dialog to be really enjoyable).
I:8493;2747;movie was truly a waste of my time / i do like some of the directors other movies though and it had a good cast as well.
I:8493;2748;All of my friends had built this up as being such a wonderful movie, by the time I watched it there wasn't any chance it would live up to its hype.
I:8493;2749;It is now one of my favorite Tarantino films (behind the Kill Bill series).
I:8493;2750;I saw this with a friend at a screening at the writer's guild.
I:8493;2751;And that's why it's so great.
I:8493;2752;Quentin Tarantino's PULP FICTION is a rare masterpiece that is unlikely to be repeated by him, or his imitators.
I:8493;2753;And believe me, many have tried, with varying levels of success.
I:8493;2754;stupendous dialogue, discourses on the meaning of life, flash.
I:8493;2755;These extended sequences of talking are like a trademark, providing insights into the characters and lulls between the bouts of frenetic violence, which occur in everything that this director touches.
I:8493;2756;It seems churlish to pick Travolta and Jackson as the stars, since everyone is convincing in their portrayals, but these two are great foils to each other and provide an intriguing core to the movie.
I:8493;2757;Combined with a superb soundtrack, which both fits into the action and provides a setting for it, the effect is akin to a 154.
I:8493;2758;it is a great movie and one of my favorites but there are other web pages for good movie reviews.
I:8493;2759;especially given the great soundtrack.
I:8493;2760;region 1) has some extras.
I:8493;2761;It gets 4 stars for being a great movie.
I:8493;2762;Quentin Tarantino delivers the goods in tall order, along with with one of the most talented casts ever assembled and a brilliant story.
I:8493;2763;Presenting them out of sequence affords us some brilliant directing by Tarantino .
I:8493;2764;who also provides some good laughs, and proves that he's a capable actor alogside these heavyweights, in his portrayal of Jimmy from Toluca Lake .
I:8493;2765;and allows the award winning director to end the movie at a more interesting spot in the natural timeline.
I:8493;2766;Even the opening credits, which occur after the first scene, hold your interest, and they are simply words over a black screen, set to music.
I:8493;2767;And that story is excellent.
I:8493;2768;I enjoyed this film immensely.
I:8493;2769;I liked the character development.
I:8493;2770;I find this incredible, since the moral dimension is rather profound.
I:8493;2771;Quentin Tarantino is one of the most unconventional film directors of our lifetime, and I am quite a big fan of his.
I:8493;2772;The first of his films I have ever experienced by Tarantino was Kill Bill, and I loved those 2 films and have watched them numerous times.
I:8493;2773;Pulp Fiction is Tarantinos masterpiece of cinema, being able to tell a compelling story without following a linear storyline, or even a cohesive story for that matter.
I:8493;2774;"What ""Pulp Fiction"" accomplishes that I have never seen in any other movies is rely totally on the characters personas instead of focusing on the story's plot."
I:8493;2775;well yes this film is abundant of dialogue, but that's pretty much the appeal of the film.
I:8493;2776;"And that's where I found the film so compelling
I:8493;2777;watching this movie numerous times after.
I:8493;2778;The acting was so well done that it just felt natural for the viewers.
I:8493;2779;the standout performance for me would easily have to be Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winnfield.
I:8493;2780;And that goes the same for John Travolta and Uma Thurman, but this is by far my favorite performance from Samuel L. Jackson in any of his roles.
I:8493;2781;I can't forget about the films soundtrack either, his choice of music was so diverse that I found myself shocked and impress of how well these songs fit the scenes.
I:8493;2782;Now I am by no means a film expert, but I would have to say that this film is truly one of a kind, and I dare anybody to say otherwise.
I:8493;2783;From the incoherant beginning to the amazingly well.
I:8493;2784;written climax, the fun of the film is to just sit back and just enjoy the characters and piece together the storyline.
I:8493;2785;This is an amazing movie, nuff said.
I:8493;2786;"scan that I'd enjoy seeing, now that I'm fully integrated into the ""Pulp Fiction"" cult."
I:8493;2787;"Our creative writing teacher in high school said that good results are obtained by placing ""words in strange places""."
I:8493;2788;In the Tarantino's case, whole sequences that are developed, to just the right length, and put in some mighty strange places indeed.
I:8493;2789;I loved this movie the first time I saw it and still can watch it just about any time.
I:8493;2790;samuel Jackson does a superb job acting as a religious fanatic / murderer.
I:8493;2791;His script and the way he conveys it are exceptional.
I:8493;2792;John Travolta and Uma Thurman are excellent as well.
I:8493;2793;As long as you can keep up with the lil parts of the movie, you'll finally get it and need to watch it again:)
I:8493;2794;Pulp Fiction is Quentin Tarantino's (director of Kill Bill) 2nd movie.
I:8493;2795;And it just happens that PF is his best movie.
I:8493;2796;It has an all star cast, and plus, some great action.
I:8493;2797;sTORY: This movie is actually 3 stories: The first one is about a man named Vincent Vega returning home from Amsterdam to a girl he meets named Mia Farrows.
I:8493;2798;tHOUGHTS: What a work of art!
I:8493;2799;Totally one of the greatest films ever made.
I:8493;2800;What's more, it's first suggested in full presence of their waitress.
I:8493;2801;I remember seeing this scene for the first time in eighth grade, how I found myself captivated by how casual the conversation was and how the characters seemed to enjoy how casually they could discuss the robbery in full view of the waitress.
I:8493;2802;I remember my thrill at the way each cut or zoom seemed to perfectly compliment the nature of the scene at any given moment.
I:8493;2803;For the first time in my life, I was appreciating art.
I:8493;2804;pulp Fiction has since become my favorite film, and for the personal significance it has to me, I predict it will stay my favorite.
I:8493;2805;The dialog and performance treats it as such.
I:8493;2806;these scenes are amusing even without reading into them because we see a reflection of our own behavior placed in extreme circumstances.
I:8493;2807;The script is profound without seeming profound.
I:8493;2808;Armed with knowledge of future events, we see how they would come to pass.
I:8493;2809;those of you who remain reluctant to see this film, because it seems like little more than gratuitus violence should see it right away.
I:8493;2810;It's a brilliant drama based on growth of characters and very human emotions.
I:8493;2811;Casting is perfect, screenplay is revolutionary and the acting spot on and the soundtrack is sublime.
I:8493;2812;American movie making at its best.
I:8493;2813;I've always lived this movie, and now I get to watch it on Blueray.
I:8493;2814;Than five stars,I'll stick with the majority,this is an amazing film.
I:8493;2815;star cast of stars that we have used as a household name for years.
I:8493;2816;they all lead up to a odd but well ending that will have you talking about for years.
I:8493;2817;this is great film that should be viewed by nearly everyone.
I:8493;2818;Always get a kick out of it.
I:8493;2819;One of my favorite Tarrantino movies.
I:8493;2820;I'm not a Tarrantino fan, so I don't like them all, but this one is particularly good.
I:8493;2821;Some day I'll get my wife to watch it.
I:8493;2822;A true classic in every sense of the word and one of the best from Travolta, Jackson and Willis!
I:8493;2823;If your a fan or not it's a classic.
I:8493;2824;It just one of those movies with a little shock value as well as great music and actors.
I:8493;2825;watching, we found we liked it even more that the first time.
I:8493;2826;When this movie first came out it was an instant classic.
I:8493;2827;Love watching this movie now matter how many times I've seen it!!!!
I:8493;2828;From start to finish this movie was really interesting and funny.
I:8493;2829;Pulp Fiction is an excellent example of Tarantino's rich, dialog.
I:8493;2830;Eloquently disturbing, this movie delivers an insightful view of reality in a series of intertwined vignettes.
I:8493;2831;"Filled with ""one liners"" for centuries to come."
I:8493;2832;I liked the way they played the Minnesota accent.
I:8493;2833;perfect actors to play the parts.
I:8493;2834;Quinton has made another great movie.
I:8493;2835;I enjoyed it a lot.
I:8493;2836;Well written and well acted.
I:8493;2837;It is just absolutely fantastic.
I:8493;2838;Second, the extras are fantastic.
I:8493;2839;So order a Vanilla Coke, put some bourbon in it if you like, and enjoy the ride.
I:8493;2840;it is a classic of modern mob/criminal and is the source of many modern cultural touchstones.
I:8493;2841;this streamed movie's delivery went smoothly and I enjoyed the experience.
I:8493;2842;"In ""Pulp Fiction,"" director Quentin Tarantino consistently defies viewer expectation and delivers one of the best films of the '90s."
I:8493;2843;You'll marvel at Tarantino's adept bending of time structure, brilliant dialogue and memorable images.
I:8493;2844;"Some indie fans may prefer the admittedly great ""Reservoir Dogs,"" but I say no go: ""Pulp Fiction"" is a deeper, more audacious and more accomplished picture."
I:8493;2845;"bending narrative, but here goes: ""Pulp Fiction"" commences with two hitmen ."
I:8493;2846;slinging hilarious dialogue (already considered classic) as they journey to collect some product from a soon.
I:8493;2847;A seemingly innocent night out turns into a unforgettable evening of '50s nostalgia, drug overdose and a memorable needle scene that will have the more squeamish population wincing.
I:8493;2848;The film is consistently hilarious and pushes the envelope in just about every sense.
I:8493;2849;changing realization in the film's final act, a transformation that makes the movie about something instead of just a stylish piece of entertainment.
I:8493;2850;Jackson's phenomenal performance is the best of many excellent acting turns, most notably John Travolta's outstanding comeback role, Uma Thurman's career.
I:8493;2851;best peformane and Ving Rhames' star.
I:8493;2852;Even the perpetually obnoxious Eric Stoltz is hilarious.
I:8493;2853;andrzej Sekula's brilliant cinematography demands mention, making great scenes even greater (e. g. Travolta's walk down drug.
I:8493;2854;Pulp Fiction is a stunning film that deservedly cements Tarantino's position as one of the industry's hottest directors.
I:8493;2855;You know you're a respected director when u can release an independent film packed with world.
I:8493;2856;renowned stars who will do anything to be in your movie.
I:8493;2857;The structure, plot twists, script, and acting are all unique: Tarantino does an excellent job in taking all of his talents and letting them go on the screen.
I:8493;2858;"And Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson (who gives his most commanding performance
I:8493;2859;hearted, you'll feel like you've taken part in something extremely special after watching it.
I:8493;2860;down one of the best movies ever made!
I:8493;2861;One of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:8493;2862;disc set packs lots of goodies, including castinterviews, location footage, stunts, and a BUNCH ofdeleted scenes, narrated by the drector.
I:8493;2863;Also, a neat box, booklet and a Jackrabbit Slim's menu.
I:8493;2864;Quentin Tarantino knows a good story, as seen in his first film, Reservoir Dogs.
I:8493;2865;The trio of stories is rounded out with the adventures of Travolta and the boss's sassy wife,Mia.
I:8493;2866;far from a 'family' film, Pulp Fiction tkes on a lot of social taboos, gets downright philosophical, and maintains a dialogue that manages to be funny, in the midst of the violence, drugs and just plain weirdness.
I:8493;2867;Highly recommended, especially in this new, better version.
I:8493;2868;Tarantino is great at what he does and know one should bug on him.
I:8493;2869;the casts were greatthe story is perfect and jon travolta is superb in the film.
I:8493;2870;Pulp fiction is one of my all time favorite films it has a very cool story and superb actors such as Bruce Willis, John Travolta, and Samual L. Jackson.
I:8493;2871;This is Tarantino's best film.
I:8493;2872;The story is what really makes this film shine and it is awesome how the films scenes are mixed in differnt scenes and not straightforward(Chronological Order, I think that's what it's called sorry If I can't spell it right)Alot of Critcs and Audiences hailed this film as the star studded motion picture that Redifined Cinema in the 20th Century.
I:8493;2873;the casting in this film is Unforgettable, the story is excellent, the film is just plain entertaining and exhilarating that oozes thrills and amusement.
I:8493;2874;unforgettable and truly deserves its5 out of 5 stars.
I:8493;2875;Best Mother***** movie out there.
I:8493;2876;This is my favorite film of all time.
I:8493;2877;John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Amanda Plummer, etc. all give an outstanding performance.
I:8493;2878;This is truly a star.
I:8493;2879;studded film and has a great plot.
I:8493;2880;If you like Tarantino's other works, you'll love this one.
I:8493;2881;A terrific ensemble cast, including a back from obscurity John Travolta.
I:8493;2882;in my opinion, it's a classic .
I:8493;2883;For me, PULP FICTION was as original and as exciting as any film I had seen in ages when it came out in 1994, and I was looking forward to a worthy successor to it.
I:8493;2884;my favorite film of the year, and I replied instantly: PULP FICTION.)
I:8493;2885;Retaining much of the edge and incredible dialog that was found in both RESERVOIR DOGS and TRUE ROMANCE, for which Tarantino wrote the script, but injecting precisely the right blend of Americana and popular culture, the film blew me out of my seat.
I:8493;2886;Immediately after seeing it, I saw it again, and then again.
I:8493;2887;The film had style and swagger to burn, humor to soften the violence and give it a surreal turn, and simple the greatest talk I had ever heard in the movies.
I:8493;2888;All the characters in the film love to talk, and many are brilliant at it.
I:8493;2889;pULP FICTION is filled with more great moments than are usually found in three or four good films added together.
I:8493;2890;contained, and would be classics on their own, but added to the others produce something even greater than the sum of its parts.
I:8493;2891;You get the extraordinary hit that Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta make at the beginning of the film.
I:8493;2892;"The unbelievable sequence with Bruce Willis and the ""Gimp."""
I:8493;2893;Christopher Walken's tale about the watch and its presentation to the young Bruce Willis character.
I:8493;2894;There are a host of great performances, although I have to express some perplexity as to why Travolta received the nomination for Best Actor and not Samuel L. Jackson.
I:8493;2895;While Travolta has one more scene than Jackson, in all the scenes where the two are together, Jackson absolutely and utterly dominates the action.
I:8493;2896;Still, Travolta is good, if not as dominating as Jackson.
I:8493;2897;And to this day it remains the best thing that Bruce Willis has ever done.
I:8493;2898;special mention must also be made of the superb soundtrack.
I:8493;2899;Pulp Fiction not only attracts our attention, it demands it.
I:8493;2900;Much credit must be given to director Quentin Tarantino who co. authored the Academy Award winning best original screenplay with Roger Avary.
I:8493;2901;The influences on his development as a filmmaker are too numerous to list here but it is worth noting that Orson Welles, Daffy Duck, Akiro Kurosawa, Dashiell Hammett, Spike Lee, and Francois Truffaut would be on it.
I:8493;2902;Many believe that this film saved John Travolta's career.
I:8493;2903;His portrayal of the dangerous but somewhat dimwitted hit man, Vincent Vega, is brilliant.
I:8493;2904;In fact, Tarantino assembled an outstanding cast and somehow coordinated the various plots in which they are involved.
I:8493;2905;Tarantino has a very traditional view of film making: He wants vivid PICTURES and he wants them to MOVE.
I:8493;2906;eminently an unorthodox examination of how MOVING PICTURES can tell a story with compelling impact.
I:8493;2907;"scenes montages, a production design featurette, a Siskel and Ebert At The Movies feature (""The Tarantino Generation""), Tarantino's Cannes Film Festival ."
I:8493;2908;Palm d'Or acceptance speech, his appearance on the Charlie Rose Show, and various reviews and articles which discuss the film.
I:8493;2909;So, the bottom line is this movie is a classic because it reinvented the way movies are done, great dialogues and great way of editing the film, with the movie beginning and ending at the same place and at the same time.
I:8493;2910;This movie has to be Tarantino's best.
I:8493;2911;The story line is great and the way it moves backwards and forwards through time adds something to it.
I:8493;2912;One of the greatest movies of the 90's without a doubt.
I:8493;2913;This is an awesome classic movie!
I:8493;2914;It is amazing on blu ray, and its just a great movie in general.
I:8493;2915;This is good, but, more of a good thing is better.
I:8493;2916;samuel L Jackson is an iconic character in this film.
I:8493;2917;john Travolta, Bruce Willis, Ving Rames, Uma Thurman all excellent.
I:8493;2918;i recommend this movie to any John Travolta or Samuel L jackson fan.
I:8493;2919;it is a great movie with great acting and great work by Quentin Tarantino.
I:8493;2920;But for any fan of this incredible film, what makes the set worth the price are three things: the synchronized trivia game, the independent spirit awards footage, and, if you missed it, the dialog with Charlie Rose.
I:8493;2921;All together this will tell you why PULP FICTION is an established classic already, and will be for generations to come.
I:8493;2922;I love the Samuel Jackson story and the Uma Thurman story.
I:8493;2923;They're both odd, quotable, and shockingly entertaining.
I:8493;2924;Pulp fiction is one of the best movies ever made.
I:8493;2925;Alil hard to know what is going on at first but it keeps you entertained
I:8493;2926;im satisfied seeing it on cable once in a while.
I:8493;2927;well overall an ok movie but i wouldnt worship this.
I:8493;2928;This movie is the best in its genre.
I:8493;2929;This is an odd film, very stylistic and with a meandering and disjointed plot punctuated with lots of surprises.
I:8493;2930;Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta put in terrific performances as the leads in this film.
I:8493;2931;This one manages to be both hilarious and serious at the same time.
I:8493;2932;It is easy to see why this one has become a cult classic and guilty pleasure for millions of film aficionados.
I:8493;2933;in fact, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:8493;2934;It is amazing that the director/writer could break such cardinal rules and produce a masterpiece.
I:8493;2935;The acting is certainly excellent.
I:8493;2936;The others in the cast are equally good, full of contradictions as people are.
I:8493;2937;But it is still a real picture of the human condition.
I:8493;2938;a classic that you can not not take your personal selection.
I:8493;2939;the shipping was very fast, so I recommend it.
I:8493;2940;One of my all time favorites.
I:8493;2941;The whole 3rd rock from the sun theory.
I:8493;2942;Tarantino combines humor, action, violence, love, and hamburgers all in perfect harmony in this classic film.
I:8493;2943;I can see how it took a lot of movie making skill to make this movie, but it's not entertaining.
I:8493;2944;tarantino managed to develop a gangster movie that is funny, sad, witty and shocking.
I:8493;2945;Great cast, great script, great film.
I:8493;2946;Great Movie, it's a hard movie to beat for dark humor mixed with a lot of comedy.
I:8493;2947;This is the kind of movie you can watch over and over again and that's what it's made for.
I:8493;2948;For anyone who likes dark humor this movie hits the spot.
I:8493;2949;this Classic is now more than ever a viewing sensation.
I:8493;2950;Pulp Fiction is probably one of the greatest movies of the 1990's, but is it the best?
I:8493;2951;the movie in some way is unique and has some memorable dialogue and characters.
I:8493;2952;That's why I give it 3 stars .
I:8493;2953;Great movie, but the hype totally takes 2 stars away from it.
I:8493;2954;I think it is entertaining, but certainly not the greatest movie ever.
I:8493;2955;the twist sequence is magnificent.
I:8493;2956;these two give so much joy and are so f. ing cool.
I:8493;2957;I would have loved to see them dance in a full length film.
I:8493;2958;"this song was so weird then but nobody heard the words
I:8493;2959;but now the words are also so right and brings back memories of piped in music at bowling alleys.
I:8493;2960;A must movie for your collection.
I:8493;2961;A movie you can what many times and still enjoy it.
I:8493;2962;I am a Tarantino fan and this is one of the best.
I:8493;2963;Most of his movies are great.
I:8493;2964;Even better than I remember.
I:8493;2965;But it never really got a chance to develop.
I:8493;2966;Incredibly degenerate life style but a gripping story. . . the acting and script are superb in this black comedy of violence and degeneracy.
I:8493;2967;A huge ensemble cast, insanely hilarious story(s), a killer soundtrack, and top notch direction from Quentin Tarantino make this one of the best jaw.
I:8493;2968;It's hard to pick a favorite performance: There's John Travolta's ultra.
I:8493;2969;curl toting Samuel L. Jackson, the voice of reason who always keeps his cool.
I:8493;2970;The tough as nails, don't tread on me, boxer played by Bruce Willis.
I:8493;2971;The beautiful Uma Thurman in a heart stopping performance.
I:8493;2972;A timeless classic that is definitely not for the kiddies.
I:8493;2973;A truly essential movie to add to your home collection!
I:8493;2974;Pulp Fiction is absolutely amazing.
I:8493;2975;This is an amazing movie.
I:8493;2976;A monumental movie for Quentin Tarantino and the generations that followed.
I:8493;2977;Bruce Willis's character of Butch CoolidgeBut the situations they get into are amazing in the way they are told.
I:8493;2978;Pure Tarantino as he was developing his voice/style.
I:8493;2979;Following upon his Reservoir Dogs, this film further explores Tarantino's unique vision.
I:8493;2980;Great cast and superb montages.
I:8493;2981;"deadening, sedating Pavlonian formulas that pass for movies these days is a truly fresh, well crafted, yet perpetually playful, cinematic statement like Tarantino's dazzling ""Pulp Fiction."""
I:8493;2982;"Whatever you've heard, it's no ""Citizen Kane,"" but in the context of the films of the day, its style and methods are certainly analagous to Welles' breakthrough film."
I:8493;2983;top attempt to beat Tarantino at his own game.
I:8493;2984;Whereas Tarantino knows how to amuse and delight by using familiar patterns (the variation on the buddy theme, for example) which engage our human interest despite the unexpected contexts, Stone merely distances us from all the mayhem on screen, which generates about as much interest as watching someone else play a video game.
I:8493;2985;"When I ask young people about the film, they see Jules' ""transition"" as proof of a character who changes for the better, who for one moment at the end of the film stops being a self."
I:8493;2986;appointed executor and takes on the role of the protective, forgiving Good Shepherd.
I:8493;2987;It's a moment, perhaps, that does not convince us of its lasting impact.
I:8493;2988;"But then again, Jules, like most of us, makes no claim to being ""saved"": he's in a state of ""transition,"" doing the best he can to be a ""good Shepherd"" as much of the time as he's able."
I:8493;2989;It's one of our favorite movies even if it is a little violent.
I:8493;2990;Pulp Fiction is an American icon, epitomizing the feelings of the nineties and pointing the Gen.Y generation in the direction it has ended up in now.
I:8493;2991;Tarantino is a master of witty repartee, his characters engaging in a number of entertaining conversations.
I:8493;2992;many of these are fascinating, however, in the way they reveal small truths about life to which we can relate.
I:8493;2993;It works here mainly because of Tarantino's objective: to tell stories like the pulp dimestore novels he read as a kid.
I:8493;2994;the performances are fun to watch, particularly Samuel L. Jackson.
I:8493;2995;This is HIS movie, and his dialogue and mannerisms are so in tune with Tarantino's writing, you wonder if this is how Jackson really is in life (hope not).
I:8493;2996;Travolta, Thurman, Willis and all are entertaining as well.
I:8493;2997;Jules (Jackson) has a great moral arc, as does Travolta.
I:8493;2998;I still wonder why Uma Thurman's character is in this movie, as it seems merely to serve as a slick, hip bit of cinematic cotton candy: fun to watch but not particularly gripping, moving or profound.
I:8493;2999;I enjoy it, but it's kind of like listening to that kid you knew in high school who thought he knew everything about everything, and couldn't stop telling you about it.
I:8493;3000;"Everyone looks cool, talks cool and does hip things, but the pathos, or the ""why"" never really comes out."
I:8493;3001;now this is the second film by the greatest director of all time.
I:8493;3002;everything about this film is amazing.
I:8493;3003;the characters are hip and original.
I:8493;3004;the dialogue is superb and just feels so natural.
I:8493;3005;i recommend this to any movie buff or anyone who just wants to be fasinated with a film,cause this is the one for you.
I:8493;3006;PULP FICTION will always be remembered as one of the greatest films ever made.
I:8493;3007;I love this movie and therefore it's really great.
I:8493;3008;Pulp Fiction is a good contender for being the best film of the 90's.
I:8493;3009;Tarantino's unique, explosive creation is something that should be watched, analyzed and treasured for years to come, it's brilliance is absolutely unparalleled.
I:8493;3010;The movie is great, and indeed looks awesome on Blu.
I:8493;3011;"The first sticker tells me I can scan it with my Smartphone and watch the trailer on my 4 inch phone screen, thanks to this 1 1/2 inch ""Wimo Enabled"" sticker."
I:8493;3012;"There's also a magic number on it, ""3000017221""."
I:8493;3013;The humanity of the film rests on his shoulders, and he delivers.
I:8493;3014;This is a fine example of dialog that sounds natural, yet is highly original.
I:8493;3015;See the movie in its original form.
I:8493;3016;The weird wonderful characters and their conversations are the real stars.
I:8493;3017;What a wild ride this movie provides.
I:8493;3018;it has all the great acting from the actors that I love, Travolta, Willis and Thurman.
I:8493;3019;But now that i have seen it again i must say that it still isnt that good.
I:8493;3020;"Overall its a half decent movie that has a certain good feel to it at the end, its got some funny things like ""damn i just shot marvin in the face""."
I:8493;3021;Kill Bill is much better, this is a movie you should see once, and i understand why most people like it alot, but for me it just doesnt provide me with has much fun as Kill Bill, but its defintly worth a look.
I:8493;3022;This a great 90s movie if you like to watch 90s movies.
I:8493;3023;Some good acting and some good laughs.
I:8493;3024;Tarantino's acting is the only performance that does not border on amazing, and Tarantino can be forgiven for that for writing such tremendous characters, gritty dialogue and avant.
I:8493;3025;linear fashion works wonderfully, creating a tremendous climax at the end of the film and adding more to its mystique.
I:8493;3026;Some may not be able to follow the story because of this, and others may not be able to stomach the abundance of violence and dirty language, but for those who can, the movie itself is cinematic gold.
I:8493;3027;I can watch this movie about once a year and enjoy it.
I:8493;3028;This is Quentin Terantino's masterpiece of his career.
I:8493;3029;One of the best cult classics of all time!
I:8493;3030;out, star studded cast, wicked soundtrack, explosive script and story that will have you begging for more.
I:8493;3031;I got it fast and it was in perfect condition.
I:8493;3032;Bruce Willis played a fighter and it was wonderful.
I:8493;3033;Classic movie, can watch over and over and and it is still entertaining.
I:8493;3034;pulp fiction is/and always will be a classic film to the slightly young adult category.
I:8493;3035;it's really unexplainable and quite appealing how such an arbitrary plot could ironically make sense.
I:8493;3036;to start off, an award winning cast to bring the movie home.
I:8493;3037;i must admit this movie is kind of hard to follow, but that's what makes it great.
I:8493;3038;it's very unique and extremely rare.
I:8493;3039;One of our all time favorites and would highly recommend it.
I:8493;3040;one of the all time best ever movies ever made .
I:8493;3041;I love this movie but even more I love resevoir dogs, jackie brown and true romance.
I:8493;3042;Quentin, please make more like these!
I:8493;3043;My grand childrens' grandchildren will talk about this movie and how outrageously great it is.
I:8493;3044;They will place it in their top 5 list and dare afreind to differ.
I:8493;3045;Just as we do today and just like my sisters did in the 90's!
I:8493;3046;The way in which this movie is pieced together, by starting and ending in the same scene just forces you to turn off the television with a smile on your face.
I:8493;3047;As far as movie influences go, i think i would be safe to say that this definitely ranks as one of the top 20 most influencial movies of all time, and i can see how.
I:8493;3048;These will be the best 150 minutes of movie watching you will spend.
I:8493;3049;This movie is raw, violent, and funny entertainment.
I:8493;3050;The actors are well known and put in some great performances.
I:8493;3051;Pulp Fiction is one of the best American films ever made.
I:8493;3052;As Tarantino was both writer and director the film has his mark all over it.
I:8493;3053;Scenes are shown chronologically out of sequence, which sounds odd but Tarantino makes it work to his advantage as the loveable rogues are still alive at the end of the film, in the scene where the film started from.
I:8493;3054;John Travolta is a revelation, Samuel L Jackson is Samuel L Jackson, but this is before we knew who Samuel L Jackson was!
I:8493;3055;Uma Thurman is also great, but in possibly the best scene in the film Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames also turn in teriffic performances.
I:8493;3056;In a lovely cameo role Harvey Keitel also turns up near the end of the film as well.
I:8493;3057;there are cimematic nods to a number of Tarantinos favourite movies as well.
I:8493;3058;It is endlessly watchable and quoteable and that is the sign of a really great film.
I:8493;3059;Only screenplay is good enough,but nothingelse.
I:8493;3060;See what he wanted to show in the movie.
I:8493;3061;Fargo , Goodfellas are really good movies made in 1990's in this country.
I:8493;3062;Feel the difference between those movies and Pulp fiction Pulp fiction is good(not great),though.
I:8493;3063;"for the rest of us, especially those who appreciate dark humor and/or are fascinated by the criminal ""underworld,"" Pulp Fiction is on a very short list of the best films of all time."
I:8493;3064;As she lies unconscious and close to death, Lance (the drug dealer) has a hilarious shouting match with his wife (Rosanna Arquette) as he frantically searches for a shot of adrenaline and a medical book.
I:8493;3065;this film is riddled with outstanding dialogue, but for me the best scene was toward the beginning, when Vincent and Jules (Samuel Jackson).
I:8493;3066;Critics say this movie glorifies violence, and to an extent I suppose this is true, but I think the real reason this movie is so entertaining is that many of us non.
I:8493;3067;"criminal"" types have a natural fascination with the criminal underworld that presumably exists in our own backyard (Los Angeles, in this case)."
I:8493;3068;Tarantino brings these characters to life with such depth, we feel that we know them intimately.
I:8493;3069;One of the best movies,it never gets old, I love to watch it over and over once in a while.
I:8493;3070;Love this film and glad to add it to my Blu.
I:8493;3071;Looks great and this movie never gets old.
I:8493;3072;one of the best movies ever made.
I:8493;3073;I've seen this movie a million times and I love it every time I watch it.
I:8493;3074;It is definitely a classic!
I:8493;3075;Yo this is the best movie of the year fo me and my homies!
I:8493;3076;Zed got it in the end tho.
I:8493;3077;Food is good for us nizzles.
I:8493;3078;Great movie, great actors, great story, and wonderful everything.
I:8493;3079;Good movie, just a lot of violence, drugs, and cuss words.
I:8493;3080;This is my favorite movie of all time!
I:8493;3081;It's funny, it has drama and it has action.
I:8493;3082;It's witty banter between characters is legendary.
I:8493;3083;I love quoting this movie.
I:8493;3084;I remember seeing this movie for the first time in the mid 90s and thought it was great then.
I:8493;3085;Very original and great acting and script.
I:8493;3086;Despite my age, I have found this movie to be extraordinarily unique, having opened an entirely new genre in films.
I:8493;3087;"ness"", and experience the joy of a new dimension within films."
I:8493;3088;Hostel was every bit as riveting, and I highly recommend that movie.
I:8493;3089;minded viewers will love Hostel every bit as much as Pulp Fiction.
I:8493;3090;Introduced many new cinematic techniques including story line development out of chronological sequence.
I:8493;3091;Good acting by the principles.
I:8493;3092;Surprisingly, this was a major box office success, grossing over $213 million after being made for $8.5M.
I:8493;3093;I just tried to figure out what was behind all the technical innovation, witty, disillusioned dialogue and brilliant music.
I:8493;3094;expression or soulful artistry in this film.
I:8493;3095;I don't see the point in making a movie for fun.
I:8493;3096;This film's status as a cult classic causes young, aspiring filmmakers to.
I:8493;3097;A decade after its release, Pulp Fiction is considered a landmark of American cinema.
I:8493;3098;"But movies like 'Pulp Fiction' and 'A Clockwork Orange' are fantasy
I:8493;3099;I may not know for sure how history will judge Tarantino, but my guess is that he'll be placed in the company of Kurosawa and Hitchcock in terms of talent and genius.
I:8493;3100;On repeated viewings you can see why and I still marvel at the style of this film.
I:8493;3101;this is made up of a series of vignettes around LA and with a core of the same characters, until everything comes full circle and ties up at the end.
I:8493;3102;This delivers a fast paced, gritty storyline and whilst the humour is certainly dark, it can't help but make you laugh.
I:8493;3103;The cast is outstanding and Travolta, Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis all turn out stellar performances.
I:8493;3104;it goes some way to show how enduring a film is if lines or scenes from it are still quoted many years after it was made and this is definitely one of those film.
I:8493;3105;The amount of times I have seen a pastiche of this or heard lines from it on TV or from friends is incredible.
I:8493;3106;The direction is amazing, with a few scenes standing out (like Willis leaning against a wall in close up, with Ving Rhames character chasing him down an alley in the distance),simple perfection.
I:8493;3107;The plot is excellent too with the non.
I:8493;3108;The soundtrack, as in most Tarantino film, is a key element and each song matches the scene perfectly and the interaction between the music and actors is a sight to behold (again I`m thinking of the now iconic scene where Uma Thurman dances the twist with Travolta).
I:8493;3109;this is highly lauded and beloved by many fans for good reason and if you haven't seen this yet then snap it up and if you have seen it, then add this to your discerning film collection.
I:8493;3110;Although I will still never understand Tarantino, nor do I think we are supposed to, this is a classic.
I:8493;3111;Seeing the film 15 years later, Pulp Fiction still feels fresh and has has all the elements of the great entertainment.
I:8493;3112;People remark about the writing and delivery of Samuel L. Jackson's lines, but some of my favorites are stuff like Be cool, Honey Bunny, be cool.
I:8493;3113;well, the man just shines when gifted with the brilliance of Blu.
I:8493;3114;"but often times you'll also hear about a little film called ""Pulp Fiction""."
I:8493;3115;The film that saved Miramax, and made Quentin Tarantino one of the most well known directors in the history of filmaking!Let's get one thing straight.
I:8493;3116;That's right, it's a movie about nothing!
I:8493;3117;As the name of the film implies, it's a Pulp Fiction.
I:8493;3118;"what's unique about ""Pulp Fiction"" is simple."
I:8493;3119;"Cue up the music and opening credits and get ready to watch a ""Pulp"" fiction unfold."
I:8493;3120;but as we see this film in the first story, you'll realize the dialogue is the highest point in the film.
I:8493;3121;"The story between Jules and Vincent opens up with a classic ""Royale with cheese"" discussion."
I:8493;3122;It's hillarious, smart and clever dialogue.
I:8493;3123;once the first story ends, we're seen with Vincent again, taking his boss's wife on a date.
I:8493;3124;It's nothing but witty and kookie dialogue.
I:8493;3125;Just keep your kids far away.
I:8493;3126;truly though, the brilliance of this movie comes not from Quentin Tarantino's dialogue or directing, but from Mr. Samuel L. Jackson.
I:8493;3127;He delivers such powerful lines in a tone that strikes fear into us all at some point.
I:8493;3128;pulp Fiction is a cult classic!
I:8493;3129;"It's nothing but good ""Pulp"" fun!So sit back and enjoy!"
I:8493;3130;Laugh, quote and admire what Quentin Tarantino has presented here.
I:8493;3131;The movie is a good watch for movie lovers.
I:8493;3132;which is also good about this movie is that it can not easily be sumed up into one unique thing cinematographic ly speaking it is at times absurde,realistic,intense,burlesque.
I:8493;3133;"sometimes it is shot in a ""classist style"" with a ""cinematographical language"" and at times in a ""modern style"" with no particular indirect meaning like an episode of ""cops""."
I:8493;3134;you'll understand when you see it.
I:8493;3135;Pulp Fiction remains the most powerful movie of the past decade.
I:8493;3136;Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece recieves its much deserved special edition treatment with plenty of goodies.
I:8493;3137;The movie also features a subtitled commentary on the film with important, if you are a big fan, information for each shot or scene.
I:8493;3138;It is a perfect 10 movie when it comes to scaling fairly.
I:8493;3139;Tarantino put all of his heart, effort and witty talent on paper and then transformed the words into images that created this film.
I:8493;3140;Whatever Tarantino made afterwards wouldn't matter, he will still be viewed as the modern day film revolution starter.
I:8493;3141;Yes, Pulp Fiction was a revolutionary piece of work.
I:8493;3142;You can literally close your eyes and still enjoy Pulp Fiction.
I:8493;3143;Tarantino uses imitations of real life conversations between his characters that makes you feel intimate with these people onscreen.
I:8493;3144;on their way to finish a kill is both hilarious as it seems realistic.
I:8493;3145;this makes Pulp Fiction not just a movie but one big entertainment experience that stood, and still stands, the test of time.
I:8493;3146;ized yet, well its about time.
I:8493;3147;this special edition is a must.
I:8493;3148;It's definitely so good you want to watch it twice!!
I:8493;3149;Pulp Fiction is a brilliant piece of filmmaking.
I:8493;3150;It was a completely innovative idea by director Quentin Tarantino and should be commended for it's grat use of black comedy blended in with the gruesome violence and the understandable bad language.
I:8493;3151;There are plenty of other things that make a movie.
I:8493;3152;with a superb cast, great direction, and a kickass soundtrack, Pulp Fiction clearly earns its five stars.
I:8493;3153;As my friend Froggy told me, this film will change your life.
I:8493;3154;This film, although filled with disturbing images and too much swearing, strikes a chord within the human heart.
I:8493;3155;In this case, murdering, fighting, and abusing people.
I:8493;3156;This film is great because it shows constant human struggle and those same people overcoming the odds and persevering through them.
I:8493;3157;Pulp Fiction in my opinion is the best Quentin Tarantino film, and a must watch.
I:8493;3158;The cast, music, and acting are superb, the dialogue a bit shocking, and the content over the top, but it is very entertaining and a must see at least three times.
I:8493;3159;very very clean transfer with a high bit rate varying between the mid 20's and low 30's.
I:8493;3160;Skin tones are perfected natural and environmental colors true to life and do not pop as you might see on an action film like Transformers.
I:8493;3161;Contrast for Pulp Fiction is excellent and at no time did I see any noticeable grain or disturbing artifacts.
I:8493;3162;The great music score uses all your home theater and really and fully envelops you into the movie.
I:8493;3163;extras include some deleted scenes, each introduces and explained sincerely and without BS by director Tarantino who makes it a point that while he liked the scenes, the theatrical release on this Blu Ray is the way he wanted it so not to expect a future 'extended' cut.
I:8493;3164;Another extras is a round table discussion of the film, a great interview with Tarantino and considerably more some of which I have not yet watched.
I:8493;3165;OK, I've finally seen it from front to back.
I:8493;3166;i watch everything that the man makes.
I:8493;3167;I really enjoy the chemistry between John Travolta and Samual Jackson as two hitmen.
I:8493;3168;The extras are very insightful.
I:8493;3169;quiton Terrintino is one of Americas greatest film makers.
I:8493;3170;Pulp Fiction (1994)Crime, Thriller, 154 minutesDirected by Quentin TarantinoStarring John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Christopher Walken and Harvey KeitelIt's not easy to write about Pulp Fiction.
I:8493;3171;The opening scene is set in a diner and we see two people discussing the virtues of robbing restaurants.
I:8493;3172;Tarantino's dialogue is very distinctive.
I:8493;3173;It's funny and true to life, but it also provides plenty of exposition and characterization.
I:8493;3174;Whether it's burgers, miracles, or foot massages, it's always entertaining.
I:8493;3175;That means he has to go on the run.
I:8493;3176;one thing I like about Tarantino is the structure of his films.
I:8493;3177;He regularly includes a scene immediately before a sequence to explain the motivations of the characters in that scene.
I:8493;3178;Christopher Walken's cameo is one of the funniest I have seen in any film.
I:8493;3179;The dialogue is at its best when the two talk in the restaurant.
I:8493;3180;Tarantino makes some good observations, such as why we feel the need to talk about trivial things rather than enjoy the silence.
I:8493;3181;The plot meanders all over the place and offers a glimpse into the lives of these colorful characters.
I:8493;3182;The actors have so much fun delivering his words.
I:8493;3183;But the swearing does fit the characters and it always feels authentic.
I:8493;3184;tarantino's films are a lot of fun.
I:8493;3185;If you have a sense of humor that's similar to mine, you might find it among the funniest material available on film.
I:8493;3186;I grin my way through all his films and Pulp Fiction feels about an hour shorter than it actually is.
I:8493;3187;ray presentation is just about perfect.
I:8493;3188;and the trend continues to this day.
I:8493;3189;Great dialog with a perfectly told story.
I:8493;3190;One of the best movies of the 1990s.
I:8493;3191;Tarantino shows what great film making is all about.
I:8493;3192;Reservoir Dogs is good but this movie put Tarantino on the map.
I:8493;3193;Excellent performances by Samuel Jackson, John Travolta, and Bruce Willis.
I:8493;3194;Its one of the most entertaining, and creative movie in a long time.
I:8493;3195;Amazing soundtrack puts it over the top.
I:8493;3196;A rollercoaster ride from beginning to end.
I:8493;3197;He's alive at the end in the restaurant scene.
I:8493;3198;Quentin Tarantino is possibly the best storyteller/director in hollywood today.
I:8493;3199;a modern classic that changed the way movies were written and made.
I:8493;3200;In short, a work of genius.
I:8493;3201;This is a classic movie.
I:8493;3202;Definitely not a movie for the kids, but a humorous movie for the adults.
I:8493;3203;Guys normally love this movie.
I:8493;3204;Easy to see why it is such a popular movie!!
I:8493;3205;Pulp Fiction was a terrific movie.
I:8493;3206;John Travolta, as usual, plays a really good role and makes the movie what it is.
I:8493;3207;The movie is a bit gory, but the storyline is good.
I:8493;3208;I would recommend this movie to people who like to watch a good mob type movie.
I:8493;3209;It's worth it and don't forget the popcorn.
I:8493;3210;As is his trademark there is no lack of violence, made palatable with thick helpings of hilarity.
I:8493;3211;John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson play their parts to perfection.
I:8493;3212;I loved this movie when I first saw it and now I can watch it whenever on my PSP.
I:8493;3213;This movie is one of my all time favorites.
I:8493;3214;Tarantino does an extremely good job of stringing you along with seemingly seperate story lines, and bringing them together at the end.
I:8493;3215;A film that has some of the best quotes, and one of the best soundtracks ever!
I:8493;3216;"This is one of my favorite movies
I:8493;3217;One of my all time favorite movies in amazing high definition.
I:8493;3218;One of the best conversions of film resolution I've ever seen.
I:8493;3219;A perfect example of this is when Uma Thurman told John Travolta not to be such a square and drew a square in the air and you could actually see the outline of a real square!
I:8493;3220;That's basically the whole movie: Unecessary but cool.
I:8493;3221;This movie is a slice of life kind of movie.
I:8493;3222;I give it 5 stars based on originality and creativeness.
I:8493;3223;Tell us how the movie made you feel, why you liked it or disliked it, etc.
I:8493;3224;See you at the movies.
I:8493;3225;And i'm pretty sure during the black Friday sale I only paid about 3 bucks for it PLUS it came with it free to stream as well, through amazon!
I:8493;3226;Totally Tarantino's style, with absurd situations with a lot of blood and with an excellent performance.
I:8493;3227;He directed and co. wrote the screenplay with Roger Avary depicting the underbelly crime scene of the greater Los Angeles area.
I:8493;3228;John Travolta's career took an upward turn after a series of Hollywood flops in this masterpiece playing a hit man who works alongside another psychotic maniac, played superbly with unapologetic force by Samuel L. Jackman.
I:8493;3229;The story mainly deals with their encounters with many shaddy creatures in the drug trade as the film's backdrop.
I:8493;3230;Quentin and Roger Avary would win one of the most acclaimned Oscars, for Best Original Screenplay.
I:8493;3231;"on a paltry budget of $8,000,000, ""Pulp Fiction"" has so far grossed an incredible $212,000,000 at the worldwide boxoffice becoming one of the biggest films ever."
I:8493;3232;this is by far one of the greatest movies i have ever seen.
I:8493;3233;the action, the dialogue, the humor, the general irreverence while still maintaining a story line.
I:8493;3234;Great movie, all star cast great cinematography!
I:8493;3235;My dear ex husband said he loved this movie and kept wanting me to see it, so we could share ideas.
I:8493;3236;Grantedthe acting was pretty good, and some humor helped.
I:8493;3237;the two stars go to the director, Tarantino, for his unique perspective.
I:8493;3238;Pulp Fiction is an absolute classic.
I:8493;3239;This is my favorite Tarantino flick of all time.
I:8493;3240;These only just begin to describe one of the greatest American movies ever made.
I:8493;3241;Snappy and witty dialogue make this one a keeper.
I:8493;3242;"If, on the other hand, you do have a brain and do like to enjoy a movie (rather than just ""watching""), then this movie is definitely for you."
I:8493;3243;Should easily have won Best Picture over Forrest Gump, please!!
I:8493;3244;I do own a widescreen TV, so if I can get the format in Widescreen, I do so.
I:8493;3245;The other is a two disc version which is the special edition.
I:8493;3246;Liked: Clever dialogue, gratuitous without being in your face violence, hilarious dark humor.
I:8493;3247;overall: It's a masterpiece and my favorite film of all time.
I:8493;3248;It's very memorable, yet you forget enough of it to make you want to see it again.
I:8493;3249;The characters also draw you back to the movie.
I:8493;3250;John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, and Uma Thurman all give the performances of a lifetime in this classic gangster hit.
I:8493;3251;Christopher Walken also gives a minuscule but memorable cameo.
I:8493;3252;up Jackie Brown, Quentin Tarantino uses his signature unconvention structure.
I:8493;3253;well, all in all, this is a contemporary classic that anyone, particularly film fans, will enjoy and be fascinated with.
I:8493;3254;Pulp Fiction is a rare experience.
I:8493;3255;pulp FictionReleased in 1994Directed by Quentin TarantinoRated R for strong graphic violence and drug use, pervasive strong language, and some sexuality.
I:8493;3256;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8493;3257;Great movie, great cast, great director, great story line and memorable scenes.
I:8493;3258;If you happen to dislike intense violence or frequent expletives, just keep moving.
I:8493;3259;While Bruce Willis is surprisingly excellent, and revived John Travolta gives the best performance of his life (which I rate as pretty good overall) and marvelous array of secondary characters litter the film, it is Samuel L. Jackson's burning, brilliant work that truly makes this film more than another highly styled slashfest.
I:8493;3260;You want the extra materials.
I:8493;3261;aggrandizing set of material about a movie, you will be hard.
I:8493;3262;hour feature The Tarantino Generation and an adulatory documentary.
I:8493;3263;While I realize most special features tend to have the director and cast patting themselves on the back, this set manages to do so without providing a lot of real insightful information.
I:8493;3264;(See: Terminator 2: Extreme Edition for an example of an egotistical but INFORMATIVE group of special features.)
I:8493;3265;Name a movie in the last 20 years as good as Pulp Fiction and I will pay you one hundred dollars.
I:8493;3266;This movie is nothing short of incredible, and by the the most enjoyable experiences.
I:8493;3267;Gritty and hilarious, breathtaking and mind.
I:8493;3268;blowing, this film is a must own.
I:8493;3269;this is one of those movies that if you've seen before there's nothing new here but it's still enjoyable.
I:8493;3270;After that, I only give it 3 stars, as the impact of knowing the plot lessened my appreciation for the movie.
I:8493;3271;The dialogue is better, and knowing how the plot is going to break down doesn't subtract from the power of the film.
I:8493;3272;I had people tell me to see it again, and see if my opinion changed.
I:8493;3273;it really is one wild ride.
I:8493;3274;Anyway, great movie, interesting, funny, very nice to watch.
I:8493;3275;good actors, good plat and an amazing director .
I:8493;3276;Quentin Tarantino, with a small but tasteful performance (as Jimmy).
I:8493;3277;Pulp Fiction is absoulutely one of the best movies ever made in the history of Hollywood.
I:8493;3278;Pulp Fiction is My favorite Movie!
I:8493;3279;You see very rarely does a movie come out with such great writing that it leaves feeling questioning if what you just saw was fiction.
I:8493;3280;It all just fits into place.
I:8493;3281;This is a hilarious thing but also a realistic sounding script, like something you might be talking about on the phone with your friend.
I:8493;3282;This is proof of the greatness of Mr. Tarintino's writing he can make genuinly funny lines out of nothing conversations.
I:8493;3283;The special edition extras are well worth the price, I'd really rather not take the time to write them all but lets just say theres a good amount.
I:8493;3284;this is the best movie ever made.
I:8493;3285;It's funny, entertaining, and challenging.
I:8493;3286;One of the first movies of its kind, uses a circular story.
I:8493;3287;Smart, gritty and full of weird twists and turns.
I:8493;3288;Snappy dialog Quentin's best movie in my opinion.
I:8493;3289;This has to be one of the greatest films ever made in my opinion , great acting , great writing , great movie , a modern day classic , highly recommended.
I:8493;3290;Their adventures unfurl in three stories that ingeniously trip back and forth in time.
I:8493;3291;Director and co. writer Quentin Tarantino uses whip.
I:8493;3292;smart dialogue to propel the most audacious and imitated movie of the 1990s.
I:8493;3293;anyway, this is absolutely the best movie ever made.
I:8493;3294;Marcellus gets raped and Fabian asked Butch 2 give her oral pleasure .
I:8493;3295;but what makes this movie the best ever.
I:8493;3296;One of the best reasons is ofcourse the cast, with Travolta, Jackson, Willis, Thurman, Rhames, Keitel, Roth, Tarantino himself and Walken amongst others.
I:8493;3297;The acting is absolutely great.
I:8493;3298;It should have won at least one Academie Award (Sam Jackson as best supporting actor), but it didn't.
I:8493;3299;Then there is the great chemistry between Travolta and Jackson in the first and last part.
I:8493;3300;The terrific dialog (the you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris is now a classic with even the Cartoon Network copying it!)
I:8493;3301;And then there's the soundtrack, which fits perfectly with the movie.
I:8493;3302;This film is vastly over.
I:8493;3303;In Leonard's novels thi sort of thing is very funny, and I think Tarantino intends the film to be funny.
I:8493;3304;(Amazon wrongly lists it as a drama/thriller.)
I:8493;3305;They are all excellent actors, but they don't get the right tone for the material to really work.
I:8493;3306;She's terrific, but not even mentioned in Amazon's long list of supporting actors.
I:8493;3307;very funny and never dull.
I:8493;3308;I don't usually review movies, but this one is the best for mature audiences if you like the other works of the Samuel Jackson, Bruce Willis, or John Travolta and all the other great actors and actresses in the movie.
I:8493;3309;No cell phones, no computers, no virtual reality, just a damn good movie.
I:8493;3310;Let's hope that Disney/Miramax offers a better, more extras.
I:8493;3311;I'm a Quentin Tarantino fan and this is one of his best.
I:8493;3312;I always look forward to his next movie.
I:8493;3313;Pulp is a timeless classic that anyone should see.
I:8493;3314;But all in all it's a wonderful movie.
I:8493;3315;Audio and video is top notch.
I:8493;3316;one of the best movies ever!
I:8493;3317;this is a great movie for anyone who likes.
I:8493;3318;awesome actors, comedy, action, and weird ass.
I:8493;3319;Classic film, with many great stars and very interesting!
I:8493;3320;Happy to have it on Blu Ray, and such a great price!
I:8493;3321;viewing the film, I discovered some of the subtler moments of really good acting, particularly Samuel L. Jackson's final Ezekiel speech in the diner and Bruce Willis' uneasy reconciliation with Ving Rhames after their encounter in the pawn shop.
I:8493;3322;These moments alone make the investment of time in the whole, lurid journey worthwhile.
I:8493;3323;pulp Fiction is film that definitely benefits from multiple viewings.
I:8493;3324;My wife had never seen it and thought it weird but I thoroughly enjoy it.
I:8493;3325;The banter is especially entertaining.
I:8493;3326;What more can you say it is a classic in blu.
I:8493;3327;Pulp Fiction is arguably one of the best films ever made.
I:8493;3328;I myself had to watch it a couple of times before I fully understood everything that was going on, and that was part of the beauty of this movie.
I:8493;3329;Its just unexplainable on how great this movie is.
I:8493;3330;It has great acting, great film shots, a superb script, great production and direction.
I:8493;3331;A must see career savers for all.
I:8493;3332;"It was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won one (Best Original Screenplay for Tarantino and his pal Roger Avary)
I:8493;3333;"It is not only one of the absolute finest movies ever made
I:8493;3334;Tarantino is infatuated with every aspect of filmmaking, and his love for the medium radiates from each and every image in this movie.
I:8493;3335;It takes more than infatuation to make a great film .
I:8493;3336;it takes talent as well.
I:8493;3337;Thankfully, Tarantino is just as talented at moviemaking as he is infatuated with it.
I:8493;3338;The outstanding soundtrack is made up almost entirely of classic surfer music and 50's tunes, though there's also tunes from Dusty Springfield, Kool and The Gang, and Al Green.
I:8493;3339;"fashioned as well
I:8493;3340;then she O. d.'s, and it's up to Vince to save her.
I:8493;3341;This leads to one of the film's best and most gruesome sequences.
I:8493;3342;Travolta is better than he's been in years, and Thurman is delightful as Mia.
I:8493;3343;"Willis is superb
I:8493;3344;Also great is Christopher Walken, who opens the segment with a very amusing speech about the importance of Butch's watch.
I:8493;3345;He grips it, getting a feel for it .
I:8493;3346;He picks it up and we see it's a baseball bat.
I:8493;3347;Butch has discovered a beautiful samurai sword (which would have a far larger part in Tarantino's next masterpiece, 2003's KILL BILL: VOL.
I:8493;3348;in the third and final segment, Travolta returns as Vince, working with his partner, Jules (Samuel L. Jackson).
I:8493;3349;This is arguably the finest segment, thanks to many laugh.
I:8493;3350;Jackson gives the finest performance of his career, and Keitel seems as cool and confident as one can.
I:8493;3351;It's the perfect way to close the film.
I:8493;3352;This is a very clever technique which makes the film twice as interesting.
I:8493;3353;Each of the stories interweave to create one big seamless masterpiece.
I:8493;3354;Tarantino's screenplay is truly wonderful and features some of the very best dialogue ever written.
I:8493;3355;In fact, Tarantino's screenplay is one of the best of all time: original, over.
I:8493;3356;I found myself struck also by the cinematography, which is truly excellent.
I:8493;3357;Each scene is captured from just about every possible angle.
I:8493;3358;It really spices up the film and helps keep you mesmerized for the entire 154.
I:8493;3359;how can a film be this good?
I:8493;3360;It's Tarantino's dedication that makes PULP FICTION so good.
I:8493;3361;The acting is superb, the editing seamless, the script outrageous and original, the soundtrack classic, the cinematography magnificent.
I:8493;3362;It's a masterpiece that is undoubtedly one of the ten best films ever made .
I:8493;3363;Love this movie and both discs are in great condition.
I:8493;3364;This was a great deal at 4 bucks!
I:8493;3365;This shindig takes you between the lines and further between the lines.
I:8493;3366;My favorite part is the Ezekiel 29:17 speech with Sam Jackson.
I:8493;3367;By all means, please let me know.
I:8493;3368;It's packed with tons of great extras, my favorite being that of the charlie rose interview.
I:8493;3369;The movie is made even more amazing with great sound and picture.
I:8493;3370;To me there is no better movie than this movie.
I:8493;3371;It's funny, sick, demented, philosophical, witty, intense and is probably the best film of the nineties.
I:8493;3372;I take that back, most definately is the best film of the nineties.
I:8493;3373;All around good movie and funnier than would seem.
I:8493;3374;Good for working out as its long.
I:8493;3375;The the third time I saw it (about 3 months ago) was off of Netflix streaming with decent enough audio, but not so great video.
I:8493;3376;Be it the achronological storytelling, the sassy script, the dark humor, the quirky characters, or just the amazing level of star power involved from every which way, there's a lot to like about this film.
I:8493;3377;For me, personally, it's the method.
I:8493;3378;"up timeline (which is enjoyable in itself and keeps you on your toes), but how so much of the dialogue is ""just there"" from a purely jovial or character."
I:8493;3379;It's a part of our modern day pop culture with all kinds of quotable lines, a beacon of entertainment and inspiration within the industry,and, for all intents and purposes, one really fun movie to watch.
I:8493;3380;First and foremost, I have to commend the black levels.
I:8493;3381;And then you have the hallmark scene where Vincent is taking Mia to Jack Rabbit Slim's, which is FULL of dark lighting, and yet still manages to display an amazing amount of detail around the restaurant itself, its patrons, on Thurman's hair, and in Travolta's suit in addition to the smoke he's blowing.
I:8493;3382;lit backdrops (which isn't many), I'm pleased at how a lot of the detail still remained intact.
I:8493;3383;Maybe it was more so the stuff they used to be the blood, but when it splatters, it looks great.
I:8493;3384;There's a fine layer of grain (and I mean very fine), but it doesn't seem like any DNR was added.
I:8493;3385;Regardless, though, I can tell you everything else looks superb, especially for its age.
I:8493;3386;English, English SDH, SpanishAnother big part of Tarantino's films outside of its aesthetic and literary homages is the sound, particularly the music.
I:8493;3387;Directionality and separation sound wonderful during these parts putting you right there in the thick of things.
I:8493;3388;Meanwhile, high and low ends still manage to be very well.
I:8493;3389;calibrated, specifically in the scene where Mia is getting her adrenaline shot between all the paper raffling around and the eventual thump on her chest.
I:8493;3390;From Jules' intimidating preacher vibrato to Fabienne's sweet and sexy accented.
I:8493;3391;produced featurette that shows a roundtable discussion with critics and their thoughts on how Pulp Fiction has affected the industry, their favorite parts, and some of the things that make the movie so good.

I:8493;3395;lover, and what he believes makes a good film.
I:8493;3396;I didn't really get into Reservoir Dogs and the Kill Bills were stylish enough, but keep in mind it's been nearly five years since I've seen those, and five years is a lot of time for my brain to better develop.
I:8493;3397;But to the point, yes, Pulp Fiction is definitely one of those films that somehow managed to turn a bunch of dialogue into a fun and raucous movie.
I:8493;3398;acted, and is a good way to spend two and a half.
I:8493;3399;This movie is, without a doubt, the best movie I have ever seen in my life.
I:8493;3400;i think when all is said and done, this will go down as one of the best movies ever made, if it's not already.
I:8493;3401;But when I started screenwriting I thought, well, I should make sure I watch all sorts of movies, especially the ones the industry loves.
I:8493;3402;this movie is a stunning tour.
I:8493;3403;QT puts things in their proper order to reveal these fantastic, fascinating characters, with the catalyitic events of their intersecting lives displayed when needed, so in the end you know why these wild people do what they do and end up where they end up.
I:8493;3404;the sequence is subservient to the dialogue, and, as another reviewer pointed out, it forces you to listen to some of the most brilliant dialogue in cinema, hands down.
I:8493;3405;mix that with some absolutely classic gags.
I:8493;3406;One of the best movies ever made.
I:8493;3407;the story, the cast the filming and the music .
I:8493;3408;I was all about VHS, and look how right I was in the long run!
I:8493;3409;Pulp Fiction is a classic movie.
I:8493;3410;Very good movie and I recommend it .
I:8493;3411;Played fine on my USA Blu.
I:8493;3412;An inside look at a memorable community of criminals.
I:8493;3413;The kind of movie you look forward to seeing again even as you're watching it.
I:8493;3414;This movie is wild, unique, smart and hilarious.
I:8493;3415;What I hoped to learn about the movie was his concept in detail.
I:8493;3416;So is the whole cast.
I:8493;3417;I always enjoy watching this movie.
I:8493;3418;This and Elizabeth and Strictly Ballroom are three of my favorite movies of all times.
I:8493;3419;Probably my favorite Tarantino movie to date.
I:8493;3420;Has several storys and all of them keep you glued to the TV the whole movie.
I:8493;3421;A great chioce of actors for the movie and they all play the parts well.
I:8493;3422;Every movie lover must see this movie during their lifetime.
I:8493;3423;The Charlie Rose interview is a classic.
I:8493;3424;It seems so totally original and holds up well after many viewings.
I:8493;3425;See it if you haven't already.
I:8493;3426;This is one of those movies you can watch over and over and catch something new every time.
I:8493;3427;There are few that really do that for me.
I:8493;3428;A good film usually expresses its story visually.
I:8493;3429;It shows us the story.
I:8493;3430;Pulp Fiction is a rich circular story about around gangsters, criminals, and a mysterious briefcase.
I:8493;3431;Good dialogue seems organic and almost conversational, yet express a deep rich subtext.
I:8493;3432;Yet this shows Tarantino's masterful writing skills, because he is able to pack so much weight in dialogue without seeming to do so.
I:8493;3433;Tarantino puts his characters in dire and serious situations, but he always finds dark humor in these circumstances.
I:8493;3434;The movie combines a very ironic mix of violence and humor throughout that takes you on a thrilling experience.
I:8493;3435;The unconventional structure of the story adds another twist, with interrelated scenes that add more context to each other.
I:8493;3436;The ensemble cast, including John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, bring their characters to life.
I:8493;3437;Pulp Fiction's creativity in juggling all these aspects creates a movie that is pure pleasure to watch and be dazzled by.
I:8493;3438;Travolta is outstanding as is Samuel L Jackson.
I:8493;3439;Pulp Fiction, the masterpiece, the classic.
I:8493;3440;That's all I'm going to say because half of the beauty is the anticipation and surprise but I assure you it all works out amazingly.
I:8493;3441;I was happy to have finally watched this movie.
I:8493;3442;It's still very good so don't this review stop you from watching it.
I:8493;3443;This movie is a true great.
I:8493;3444;Travolta, Jackson, Willis,etc. star studded cast and a great script make this very entertaining.
I:8493;3445;This movie has alot of stars and has a great story.
I:8493;3446;but ya gotta love the people in the film.
I:8493;3447;I am not a fan of bad language but the plot and the tempo of the film is great.
I:8493;3448;This is one of those films that you will want to watch more than once.
I:8493;3449;Lots of twists and great music.
I:8493;3450;i think it is brilliant, and very funny.
I:8493;3451;i love Tarantino, and this is the best he ever did
I:8493;3452;I rarely watch gangster movie, but this one is perfect for me.
I:8493;3453;The acting is clearly very good, but the story line was way too weird.
I:8493;3454;I know the movie is supposed to be funny in a weird way, but I found nothing entertaining about it.
I:8493;3455;One of Quentin's best all time!
I:8493;3456;Great characters and movie lines as well!!
I:8493;3457;I see can why this has become a cult classic.
I:8493;3458;Everyone knows how great this movie is, so I wont use this review to discuss the movie.
I:8493;3459;First, the packaging and design are really cool.
I:8493;3460;Quentin added a little something extra inside the package that I thought was cool, it's a Jack Rabbit Slim's menu.
I:8493;3461;This is the best and most insightful interview I've seen Quentin give (that's thanks to Charlie).
I:8493;3462;He talks about all the little details that led him to become a film maker and what inspires his unique vision.
I:8493;3463;Also, is a full program of At the Movies, that discusses Quentin's influence on today's film scene.
I:8493;3464;This is a classic that should be part of every collection.
I:8493;3465;Raw sexy humor brings together a talented bunch for a great tale.
I:8493;3466;It has a lot of interviews and shows related to the movie, it has a few deleted scenes, a great transfer both in audio and video.
I:8493;3467;Pulp Fiction is a very good movie.
I:8493;3468;It has an unmatchable group of stars.
I:8493;3469;Tarantino and another great production.
I:8493;3470;This movie is as good as Kill Bill.
I:8493;3471;The way the story is blended together is majestic.
I:8493;3472;And that's what makes it very creative and interesting.
I:8493;3473;The story takes you to the past and then back to the present and so on.
I:8493;3474;Excellent performances by Travolta, Willis, Jackson, Thurman and all the cast.
I:8493;3475;Not that it interferes with the picture, but I always prefer to have full screen and be able to see everything centered and with symmetry.
I:8493;3476;The movie is in English but you can also watch it in Spanish.
I:8493;3477;The movie arrived surprisingly soon, which was great.
I:8493;3478;There are answers to those questions and plenty of others .
I:8493;3479;I found this very entertaining!There are two discs .
I:8493;3480;the second one has unedited scenes in their full glory and those scenes that didn't make it.
I:8493;3481;"They are accepted as being ""great"", therefore everyone and their mom says they are great simply because everyone else says so."
I:8493;3482;Fair to good is my rating.
I:8493;3483;The movie then introduces us to two hit men Jules and Vincent played by Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta.
I:8493;3484;Jackson in particular is great as the logical and somewhat spiritual killer.
I:8493;3485;These characters intersect one day as Willis and Marsellus are captured by some redneck rapists.
I:8493;3486;In conclusion there are some pretty good ideas here.
I:8493;3487;Pulp Fiction is an example of the power of marketing and advertising.
I:8493;3488;Quentin Tarantino had the right connections at the right time, the right publicist and the right people behind him.
I:8493;3489;It is the power of advertising that chooses to call this movie great.
I:8493;3490;Yes, it is a comedy, no matter what you might hear from other people.
I:8493;3491;I don't consider myself a Quentin Tarantino fan, but this movie rightfully deserved an Oscar.
I:8493;3492;This movie is a classic, and is served quite well on Blu.
I:8493;3493;Be right back, gotta go fix that.
I:8493;3494;One of the best movies ever, and easily my personal favorite.
I:8493;3495;this movie is a good benchmark to tell if a person's taste/opinion in movies is worth anything.
I:8493;3496;This movie is one of my all time favorites!
I:8493;3497;Pulp Fiction is a very unique movie.
I:8493;3498;John Travolta, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis give some of their best preformances.
I:8493;3499;The soundtrack is also terrific.
I:8493;3500;It will keep you rocking through out.
I:8493;3501;I thought this one was exceptional.
I:8493;3502;The extras are Ok, the slipcover is good, but it has the same case as Jackie brown and I honestly don't like it.
I:8493;3503;Any intellectual movie buff will tell you that this movie among other favorites including 2001: A Space Odyssey, ranks among the top ten list of great movies of all time.
I:8493;3504;It is extremely creative, entertaining, mind boggling, and full of great acting, with a very intriguing cast.
I:8493;3505;This is definately one to watch many times over, and memorize all the great lines!
I:8493;3506;Tarantino really makes his space in the director chair with this movie.
I:8493;3507;Starting with the great cast, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta and more.
I:8493;3508;Tarantino's amazing screen display, as well as an original plot makes this an amazing movie.
I:8493;3509;It mixes a lot of genres and the divisions of chapters and stories makes it really good for the trama.
I:8493;3510;Really good movie and for the psp even better!!
I:8493;3511;Tarantino on his best day is a very good director, but not quite a great one.
I:8493;3512;Even with that, it's still a very good movie, and one of the few Tarantino movies that actually deserved most of the critical praise that it got.
I:8493;3513;I find it amazing that so many people can be hoodwinked by slick packaging and the Hollywood spin apparatus.
I:8493;3514;The success of this film can only encourage the Govt.
I:8493;3515;He's the best publicity prostitute and self.
I:8493;3516;important carciture I've ever seen in Directordom.
I:8493;3517;This is an excellent edition of one of the most innovative films of our age.
I:8493;3518;Seeing how this movie is the 4th best movie of all time (according to IMDB) I figured it was worth a shot for $10.
I:8493;3519;i found the entire movie odd, but enjoyable and perfectly watchable.
I:8493;3520;I personally don't think it should even be in the Top 200, but it's a good movie to watch nonetheless.
I:8493;3521;i actually saw this film a couple of years ago, so much of the detail of the film has blissfully receded into the recesses of my memory.
I:8493;3522;It took a tremendous act of will on my part to see it through to the end the first time around (always hoping until the credits appeared that something, ANYTHING, would happen that would make me feel the time was well spent.
I:8493;3523;I can't bear the thought of watching it again in the hope that I will finally see a point to anything this film had to offer.
I:8493;3524;My recommendation is that you do the same.
I:8493;3525;This is a great movie, a fantastic transfer to Blu.
I:8493;3526;ray and a terrific bargain thanks to Amazon's Black Friday Deals.
I:8493;3527;But still a great deal even at Amazon's everyday prices.
I:8493;3528;Smoothly flows between scenes and ties it all together at the end.
I:8493;3529;Pretty crazy in some spots, but all in all, some of the really good movie lines.
I:8493;3530;not my most favorite, but somehow I just keep coming back to it.
I:8493;3531;I've seen older films with pristine transfers.
I:8493;3532;One of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8493;3533;Its almost a half a dozen movies in one that all come together to make one big juicy pulp.
I:8493;3534;His stunning portrayal of Jules Winfield is so indelible and convincing that you actually forget that you're watching an ACTOR.
I:8493;3535;Quentin Tarantino writes the best dialogue in modern film (Jackson himself said that 'he writes things that actors want to say') and the way he twists time and events to tell the story is unparalleled.
I:8493;3536;One of our favorite movies!
I:8493;3537;A film format like you have never seen.
I:8493;3538;This is his best, in my opinion.
I:8493;3539;Samual L. Jackson never did finish that muffin!
I:8493;3540;This is one of the BEST movies ever made, something I simply had to have on Blue ray.
I:8493;3541;I enjoyed it a lot.
I:8493;3542;My favorite Tarantino movie out there is Jackie Brown, because it has to be one of the best player movies out there.
I:8493;3543;i GOTTA see it now.
I:8493;3544;Save your time keep looking.
I:8493;3545;This is still the movie that represents Tarantino at his height, the one that combines his love for all things movies into 2 hours of pure fun.
I:8493;3546;Everything works perfectly in a way that things rarely come together: the choice of actors, music, dialogue.
I:8493;3547;"It looks great on my 46"" led Samsung tv."
I:8493;3548;"I was 20 years late, but I finally watched Quentin Tarantino's popular ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) and was impressed."
I:8493;3549;linear fashion, but it's easy to follow and the final act ties everything up nicely.
I:8493;3550;The dialogue's witty and the story maintains your attention, despite its 2 hour and 34 minutes runtime.
I:8493;3551;"The film's stylish and pulsates with energy and innovation
I:8493;3552;But if you can look beyond this, the film's worth your time.
I:8493;3553;That may be a cliche, and of course it is, but in fact that is the reason why Pulp Fiction is so great.
I:8493;3554;There are so many reasons why it is so great, and as a work of cinematographic art it stands amongst the best of them.
I:8493;3555;pulp Fiction is a snapshot of American gangster life, classy and crisp.
I:8493;3556;The first is the story of Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L Jackson), two gangsters sent to retrieve a mysterious briefcase, the second the tale of a marked boxer (Bruce Willis) the third the conclusion of the first.
I:8493;3557;"Yet this adds to the atmosphere
I:8493;3558;The film is very strong visually and also has a superb soundtrack.
I:8493;3559;piece, hate it for its arty pretensions, love it for the intelligent, thought provoking plot, hate it for leaving the plot hanging.
I:8493;3560;"personally, it blew me away
I:8493;3561;One of the greatest films of all time .
I:8493;3562;"as Jackson says
I:8493;3563;Pros:Excellent pacingExcellent interweaving storiesExcellent vibe of movieExcellent actingGreat humorWhen watching it still feels fresh,original, and unique all at the same timeExcellent soundtrackCons:noneSummary:I love this movie and find it to be a perfect film, I would recommend this to everyone.
I:8493;3564;all the actors are very powerfulDirector's arrangement is also very memorable, and I love the soundtrack very much.
I:8493;3565;I see and understand how this movie revived the careers of Travolta and Willis.
I:8493;3566;How amazing that both are in the same film.
I:8493;3567;I will watch it again, but the first time is the best.
I:8493;3568;The dialogue is so fresh, the camera angles and slo mos are great (i. e. the camera shooting Willis while Marcellus is telling him to rig the game) and the soundtrack rocks.
I:8493;3569;Without the messages and symbolism you get a great new age gangster movie set in drug addicted 80's Los Angeles.
I:8493;3570;Great acting and directing makes even the most trivial side characters memorable and important.
I:8493;3571;But then you can crack into the meat of the movie, looking past the initial shock and digging deeper to find all of the underlying plots, the true conflicts the film sets up.
I:8493;3572;Very Pleased overall with all aspects of product.
I:8493;3573;The dialogues are excellent and the story is inspired.
I:8493;3574;This is whithout a doubt a great flick.
I:8493;3575;I did not know big names like John Travolta, Tim Roth played part of it, their action were very good.
I:8493;3576;It's funniest crime movie I've ever watched.
I:8493;3577;I still love the acting, Samuel L. Jackson shines and this is one of his best roles in a film.
I:8493;3578;I love Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and the Kill Bills.
I:8493;3579;I hope he's doing another good film, fingers crossed.
