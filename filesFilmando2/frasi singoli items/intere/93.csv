1;Blazing Saddles was one of my fathers favorite movies of all time.
2;in my humble opinion Blazing Saddles is a true classic.
3;Still funny after all these years.
4;Mel Brooks is a comic genius.
5;I was very pleased to be reacquainted with this classic.
6;A totally wacko funny movie for the none too sensitive audience.
7;The film holds up extremely well.
8;"The fourth wall shattering script is a clear inspiration for great modern comedies such as Dan Harmon's ""Community."""
9;Richard Pryor had a role in writing many of the jokes, so hold on for a great ride.
10;Politically incorrect but one of the funniest movies ever.
11;It is in my top ten.
12;Mel Brooks is a comic genius, period.
13;If you are expecting anything else from one of the funniest men who has ever lived you must be on something.
14;this movie always makes me laugh.
15;but yes, it's one of the funniest movies ever made and I'll continue to watch it ever few months just for fun .
16;Some of the most memorable lines in the history of Hollywood.
17;Mel Brooks' 1974 Blazing Saddles is a classic film in the making.
18;Mel Brooks was definitely way ahead of his time, poking fun at a touchy subject, then and now.
19;This film stars Mel Brooks, Madeline Kahn, Gene Wilder, and Slim Pickens, all delivering incredible performances.
20;It seemed fresh a new then, as it does today as a 23 year old.
21;Everybody should see this masterpiece of filmmaking in Mel Brooks filmography.
22;"You will definitely understand why this film is always in the top ten of those ""Top 100 Funniest Movies"" lists."
23;I'm a big fan of the idea that humor is improved by seriousness, and vice versa.
24;Sure, director Mel Brooks takes the film as seriously as the public took Dan Quail's presidential run.
25;"But it works
I:8336;26;the title track sounds like a real western opening, but that's all this movie does to convince you it's anything but comic.
I:8336;27;after one bit) and it works.
I:8336;28;and it all works together into one bit, unorthodox western.
I:8336;29;But if you have ever laughed, and you're open to doing it again, then this will probably have something in it for you.
I:8336;30;Except, of course, that it's seriously good.
I:8336;31;I loved the beans part, and the ending is total anarchy.
I:8336;32;this is a great Mel Brooks film.
I:8336;33;this just what you expect from Mel Brooks the funny.
I:8336;34;i will let you see the movie so you can see why and what i mean and the rest of it.
I:8336;35;I just love this movie.
I:8336;36;And now that it is on Blu.
I:8336;37;I definitely recommend this movie.
I:8336;38;Still, worth watching one time.
I:8336;39;PQ is better than the original theatrical release!This title is highly recommended!
I:8336;40;Mel Brooks is and always will be brilliant.
I:8336;41;I would also recommend Young Frankenstein.
I:8336;42;It funny, and a classic great film that only Mel Brooks brings to the screen.
I:8336;43;If you are just looking for a good laugh and like westerns this is a great movie to watch.
I:8336;44;Mel Brooks at his best in his western spoof.
I:8336;45;this movie is funny and one of Mel Brooks's funniest movies!
I:8336;46;Move over Citizen Kane there's a new sheriff in town!
I:8336;47;Lots of belly laughs and just enough satire to help us all understand that we can all live together.
I:8336;48;A friend recommended this movie.
I:8336;49;On her word I bought it and have enjoyed it.
I:8336;50;It was funny the first time I saw it as a young lad and it is funny today.
I:8336;51;it's a classic in our house!
I:8336;52;My husband loves this movie and was happy to get it in blu.
I:8336;53;This is a classic movie .
I:8336;54;I laugh from the start to the end.
I:8336;55;This is by far one of the best movies of all time, I mean it's Mel Brooks we're talking about here.
I:8336;56;swim back to the mainland and check it out.
I:8336;57;The sky was a natural blue, with realistic cloud formation.
I:8336;58;Rocks and trees along with man.
I:8336;59;d than watching a two dimensional image.
I:8336;60;This is due to the additional contrast between foreground and background provided by the hi.
I:8336;61;Skin tones were natural with perceptible sweat and a warmth that draws the viewer into the character.
I:8336;62;Anyway, these two points take away a star.
I:8336;63;what we do have is a classic made more enjoyable by the better resolution, and a host of extras sometimes omitted on hi.
I:8336;64;Good menu bar that pops up which allows for continued watching of the movie while making your selection.
I:8336;65;It is true that in today's politcally correct world, there would be much hand wringing about this film.
I:8336;66;But, it is one of the funniest films of all time.
I:8336;67;Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder are a great comic team.
I:8336;68;And, the film itself is filled with so many wonderful moments.
I:8336;69;Harvey Korman and Madeline Kahn are fabulous.
I:8336;70;This movie showcases Mel Brooks as a director.
I:8336;71;But, it this movie, in works.
I:8336;72;And, sometimes, we just take ourselves to darn seriously!
I:8336;73;That is what makes this movie so great.
I:8336;74;Mel Brooks is able to hold up a mirror to society and show us what we are really made of!
I:8336;75;It is one of Mel Brooks' classic movies.
I:8336;76;I saw it many years ago and I had to have it in my collection.
I:8336;77;It was funny, but I found some of the script to be very uncouth.
I:8336;78;a wonderful satire on the western genre with Cleavon Little, and Gene Wilder in the main roles, obviously enjoying the material and farce of it all, in one of Mel Brook's best offerings.
I:8336;79;Fans will see most of the familiar Brooks crew (including himself) in either supporting or cameo roles throughout the picture, and although I loved this picture, it will not be to everyone's taste.
I:8336;80;There are some very good moments of biting satire, as well as over the top obvious sight and line gags, but this is still a good funny movie.
I:8336;81;Quite simply, one of the funniest movies produced by Brooks in a long line of hilarious movies.
I:8336;82;At a younger age my boyfriend loved talking about how much he loved this movie, he was SOO excited when he received this for Christmas!
I:8336;83;Of course recipient loved it!
I:8336;84;On the surface, the modern viewer would find this to be low grade politically incorrect humor on the Howard Stern level, but it's all done with a purpose.
I:8336;85;One look at the subhuman beast who makes these comments show that Brooks is poking fun at the depraved people who say such things, although it would not be permitted today.
I:8336;86;If a black man is sheriff than everyone will leave, right.
I:8336;87;Gene Wilder is the best thing about this film, aside from Madeline Kahn who actually tickled my funny bone a bit, but for the most part nothing was even remotely entertaining.
I:8336;88;The final few minutes of the film are hilarious.
I:8336;89;See, writing this review has helped me to find something entertaining within the film.
I:8336;90;It looks and feels like a real western, but it isn't, it's the most brilliant spoof ever created to date.
I:8336;91;This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.
I:8336;92;The anniversary edition is great!
I:8336;93;Nothing is sacred in this film.
I:8336;94;easily one of the funniest I've ever seen.
I:8336;95;the crew in the film work together wonderfully, especially Wilder and Little.
I:8336;96;tHAT made the jokes all the more funny (but watch out for Jesse Jackson!)
I:8336;97;An airtight script makes for a great viewing experience.
I:8336;98;I never saw the cut scenes that numerous people refer to but they sound funny.
I:8336;99;Hopefully a great collector's edition will be released in the near future with those scenes intact.
I:8336;100;Blazing Saddles is a hilarious film by the creative and very talented Mel Brooks.
I:8336;101;Although, some parts seem to drag on, overall the movie is extremely funny.
I:8336;102;I do recommend this movie to a more mature audience.
I:8336;103;If you enjoy this movie I would also recommend: Young Frankenstein, History of the World Part 1, and High Anxiety
I:8336;104;Best idea I've had in a while.
I:8336;105;Hilarious movie from start to finish.
I:8336;106;If you need a pick me up and have a good sense of humor watch this movie!
I:8336;107;I have always loved Mel Brooks' work .
I:8336;108;Cleavon Little was fantastic in this .
I:8336;109;It was funny, but not as funny as I remembered.
I:8336;110;This is the best group of actors for this time period.
I:8336;111;One of my favorite Mel Brooks movies, but of course you cant go wrong with them
I:8336;112;Though Mr. Brooks took all the credit, this movie was mostly written by the late Richard Pryor, the hysterically funny comedian and actor.
I:8336;113;Anyone familiar with his work will recognize themes and laughs that could only have originated in his mind.
I:8336;114;an hilarious story that three decades later garners perhaps as many laughs as it did in the seventies.
I:8336;115;absurdly sarcastic, witty and funny.
I:8336;116;More like the willing suspension of reason, as you will laugh hysterically through the movie.
I:8336;117;he manages to make it appear that he's telling a story even while taking great pains to pointedly remind you that it's all merely a zany construct housing the funny stuff.
I:8336;118;its refreshing to watch a film that is fun to view and understand that the scenes and dialog are not intended to hurt or offend, however in todays over.
I:8336;119;This is by far one of the best.
I:8336;120;Cleavon Little was very good in some scenes (when he dropped his cool), but at other times he played it too cool for his lines to really be funny.
I:8336;121;Now for the extras: The retrospective was nice and informative, and the excerpts from Lifetime's Intimate Portrait of Madeline Kahn were sweet too.
I:8336;122;And where is a special edition for History of the World, Part I?
I:8336;123;If you enjoy comedy, then this movie is for you.
I:8336;124;Mel Brooks is a genius.
I:8336;125;one of the funniest moveis ever made.
I:8336;126;Mel Brooks is a master at movie making.
I:8336;127;incorrect films I have ever seen and the fact that it was filmed that way on purpose is a miracle.
I:8336;128;The plot is almost incidental in this film, its the acting and gags that makes this film a joy to watch.
I:8336;129;His character is as much the target of the racist dialogue uttered by the townspeople and the cowboys, but he's able to shake it off with a smirk and a smile and give it as good as he gets it.
I:8336;130;I give this film a high recommendation if one is not offended too easily.
I:8336;131;This was a comedy movie and made fun of everybody, no one was safe.
I:8336;132;It was a true equal opportunity movie.
I:8336;133;This movie had a great ensemble cast and no one fought over top billing.
I:8336;134;When the odds of getting the biggest names in comedy to the to do that today?
I:8336;135;see movies, this one has to be part of the conversation.
I:8336;136;A very funny movie for those who can take prejudice comments.
I:8336;137;For us white crackers, I found it very intertaining.
I:8336;138;This movie is hilarious and l never get tired of watching it.
I:8336;139;Mel Brooks is a genius and a pioneer of comedy.
I:8336;140;Mel Brooks' classic western spoof is still funny 40 years later.
I:8336;141;The movie is a joy to watch.
I:8336;142;The disk extras are fine, with an interesting making of video and tribute to Madeline Kahn.
I:8336;143;Mel Brooks' 1974 comedy classic was a real ground breaking comedy in certain aspects.
I:8336;144;The film is also noted for it's tone, and it's remarks towards black people.
I:8336;145;The brilliant and legendary Gene Wilder plays Jim to perfection.
I:8336;146;His quick hand moments are hilarious.
I:8336;147;Little was a perfect choice.
I:8336;148;He is sly and charming, and is winning in every scene.
I:8336;149;Brooks appears himself as the governor, in a funny, and rather small, role.
I:8336;150;Brooks peppers his film with other fine characters and actors.
I:8336;151;Khan is such a gifted comedic actress, and it seems like she never gets the recognition she deserves.
I:8336;152;She did receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for this role, and that is quite something since such a role rarely gets acknowledged in such a way.
I:8336;153;And Slim Pickens also co. stars as Mr. Taggart, Lamarr's right hand man.
I:8336;154;Four writers, including Brooks himself and Richard Pryor, penned the hilarious script.
I:8336;155;Brooks even helped co. write the songs used in the film, including the great title tune, sung by Frankie Laine, and the song Khan sings at the saloon titled """"I'm Tired""""."""
156;It is certainly a laugh.
157;It's hailed as one of the best comedy classics, and it deserves it's praise, but the early Zucker Brothers films are better.
158;Watch it and have a good laugh.
159;The irrepressible Blazing Saddles is a great treasure that could not be done today with all our political correctness .
160;A must see, laugh, spit take, insane and movie.
161;Well, this movie and The Producers are Mels' best.
162;The sight gags and the dialogue /screenplay are extraordinarily funny.
163;One of the funniest movies ever.
164;Had me laughing the whole time!
165;Love Mel Brooks' dry humor!
166;Mel Brooks films are always funny!
167;This is the best western ever filmed, and also the funniest.
168;Crisp, sharp but still pleasantly soft, not like the super.
169;Blazing Saddles is Over the top and hilarious.
170;Its a piece of cinematic history.
171;You'll laugh and also think.
172;Blazing saddles is one goofy, irreverant, enjoyable romp of a movie.
173;Pokes fun at various groups of people thru the movie.
174;who was in the running for the rolr of Bart) stole from elements from John Ford, John Wayne, Howard Hawks and RANDOLPH SCOTT to create the greatest UN.
175;top villain (played with a aplome by Harvey Korman) and a saloon singer (Madeline Kahn) and played with the audience and made them laugh.
176;the story of a railroad worker who is made a black Sheriff by an evil attorney General bend on power, sent to a town of Rock Ridge where the railroad is going thru is funny.
177;this black comedy does not just spoof the western genre, it makes you laugh at what we love about westerns.
178;Brooks and his comedy staff (Ricahrd Pryor, Norman Steinman, Allan Uger, and Andrew Bergman)meshed tbis comedy into a masterwork, the best film Brooks did.
179;and I loved the classic The Producers (the non musical one!)
180;This is one of the funniest/best movies I've ever seen.
181;Now go do that voodoo that you do so well.
182;This is a wonderful movie to watch and enjoy all cozied up to your man.
183;Makes for a great sharing experience and lots of laughs.
184;This is another one of my husbands favorite movies of all time.
185;I would recommend this show to anyone!
186;Service was great and showed up before it was promised .
187;If you can get passed the raunchy words and scenes this is one of the funniest movies ever made.
188;I watched this movie as a kid and still love it.
189;I am happy that it was digitally re.
190;This is Mel Brooks at his best.
191;The actors are some of the best comedic actors of their time, and the ending is one of the best ever.
192;If you like comedy and satire, you'll love this movie.
193;One very funny crazy movie but that is Mel Brooks., It never gets dull.
194;Some really good acting and dialog.
195;Not for the kids, madcap humor at it's best.
196;Pokes fun at racial stereotypes a lot.
197;The comedy that ensues is hillarious, this is one of the most quotable films ever.
198;Gene Wilder and Cleavon Little are brilliant together, and Madeline Kahn stills the show as a hillarious Western performer with some trouble with the R's.
199;A classic guilty pleasure film for many.
200;Clever, made us laugh at racism, clever script.
201;Mel Brooks third best film.
202;Blazing Saddles is a comic masterpiece!
203;Cleavon Little is fantastic as sherrif Bart, the poor guy who has to deal with a world full of bigotted numbskulls.
204;"Gene Wilder is perfect as his sidekick ""The Waco Kid"", a washed."
205;Harvey Korman proves that there's more to him than his role on the Carol Burnett show.
206;I find this movie to be as funny the tenth time as it was the first.
207;Mel Brooks is a genius!
208;I don't know if the original master was just in excellent condition or if they had to go frame by frame and clean it up, but the detail level was astounding.
209;Madeline Kahn's rendition of I'm Tired is worth the price of the movie alone.
210;This is a truly funny movie you can't see on TV today, except on pay cable.
211;It is full of incorrect speak and skits.
212;Another great movie and it is very good!
213;This movie has become such a part of our culture that everyone should see it at least once, maybe not Mel Brooks finest work but it is right up there.
214;The extras are also entertaining by filling in some background on the movie.
215;I had watched this movie decades ago, and remember thinking it was funny.
216;But parts of it can still be entertaining, if you remember that this was written to make fun of racist views.
217;This is a very non p. c. funny classic movie that will give anyone who doesn't get offended a lot of laughs.
218;I got this disk as one of the free movies that was in the promotion for getting a player.
219;Turned out to be a great selection.
220;It is a very funny movie!
221;this is a classic, I have it on older video tape, but wanted it streaming, from amazon.
222;This movie is absolutely the best comedy ever.
223;Watched this with my family.
224;Definitely a movie I would recommend to my friends!!
225;Probably the best, if not, the most influential of all of Brooks' films.
226;Madeline Kahn at her finest with her tongue.
227;This is a comedy classic.
228;up of popular westerns is not only funny, but it is socially relevant, in a warped sort of way.
229;cleavon Little and Gene Wilder make a great team as the newly.
230;Brooks includes some of his standard actors, like Harvey Korman, Madeline Kahn, and himself (all of whom are hilarious), and adds some great cowboy.
231;This is Brooks's most brilliant move: to hit the viewer over the head with humor, while subtly suggesting that we CAN all get along.
232;"From the first scene on the railroad (""I don't hear no singin'"") to the last scene in Hollywood, this movie is great."
233;I have seen this movie so many times I can say the lines from the beginning to the end.
234;Really funny movie, very quotable.
235;I don't know what else to say about it, just go see it, it's a classic.
236;If you loved other Mel Brooks movies like Spaceballs, or Young Frankenstein, then you'll love this.
237;Pitch perfect acting and story telling.
238;A classic Mel Brooks film and for the right price.
239;I would highly recommend this film to all men and women.
240;I laughed so hard and it was at myself, that's what's so great about this funny/funny/funny movie, that a sequel would never be able to hold candle to.
241;BLAZING SADDLES has survived throughout these years as one of Mel Brooks best films.
242;Filled with hysterical sight gags and some of the funniest lines ever spoken, it is no surprise that many people argue that BLAZING SADDLES is the best Mel Brooks film.
243;Cleavon Little stars as Bart, whose fine performance stands out as the best he ever gave to a film.
244;Gene Wilder is brilliant as ever as Bart's friend Jim, or as he was known so many years ago, the Waco Kid.
245;The truly magnificant performances are done by the supporting cast.
246;bam fantastic as Hedley Lamaar!
247;Definitely his best performance in a Brooks film.
248;The late, great Madeline Kahn received an Academy Award nomination for her great performance as Lili Von Schtupp, and she is amazing from beginning to end.
249;Slim Pickens shows great comic poise as the dim.
250;Mel Brooks plays dual roles as the hilarious Governor and later as the Indian Chieftain.
251;Dom Deluise, though only appearing for less than five minutes, gives a wonderful performance as an effeminate director.
252;All in all, Mel Brooks' direction and screenplay co. written by Richard Pryor among others are awesome.
253;I have to start this by saying that this is one of the funniest movies of all time.
254;Those who seen this on network TV remember scenes where Mongo has an anvil dropped on his head, is dropped down a well, and all other sorts of Warner Brother foolery a la Bugs Bunny.
255;The disk you get is double sided with widescreen on one side and regular viewing on the other.
256;hope the Special Anniversary edition did not, in anyway, alter the original, it was and still is a classic movie.
257;ray the other night and all I can say is WOW!
258;The transfer is excellent, the colors really pop.
259;I noticed so much more detail.
260;It's the greatest, funnyest, best comedy ever on film.
261;The perfect ensemble cast ever put together.
262;Blazing Saddles is as fresh today as it was in 1974 ( it was actually shot in February, March and April of 1973 ).
263;what great memories of fun times for me!!!
264;I first saw this movie years ago and thought it was real funny then, now that I am older I find it awesome.
265;"You don't have to be a fan of ""spaghetti"" westerns to appreciate this movie but it does make the molvie funnier."
266;The film looks at a range of social and political matters, and skewers them.
267;Also, Mel Brooks and Richard Pryor collaborated on this film, so it's a truly funny film.
268;I enjoyed watching this classic Mel Brooks movie.
269;This is still one of the funniest movies ever!
270;This is a great classic movie.
271;My kids who are 18 and 20 years old, love this movie.
272;One of the greatest comedies of all time!
273;I remember the first, or rather the second time I saw this film, very well.
274;The first time I was too doubled up with laughter to remember anything.
275;missed Madelyn Kahn, the stressed Harvey Korman and the bulbous Dom De Luise created classic characters that linger in the memory while helping Mel Brooks take on (and shatter) the 'epic' western.
276;known to review here but you will find something new with every viewing.
277;pure genius, the film is raw, funny, brilliant and a social commentary all rolled into one.
278;Blazing Saddles takes every western film clich and shoves it down our throats in a unique and brilliant way.
279;the acting is sharp, the writing amazing.
280;"rank it up there with ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Duck Soup"" as one of the best comedy pictures ever."
281;"beyond that, it resides in a neighborhood with ""Citizen Kane,"" and ""Casablanca"" as one of the finest American films ever made."
282;A film the remains an ageless classic.
283;I got this for my husband as a gift.
284;He has often spoken of it with happiness and hilarity.
285;Really great Blu ray transfer of one of Mel Brooks' greatest ( second only to Young Frankenstein).
286;Great picture and sound makes for very pleasurable viewing.
287;For under ten bucks, a heck of a deal.
288;Good movie with a lot of slap stick humor.
289;My husband and I love it and any movie with Gene Wilder cast in it.
290;They thought it was the funniest movie they had soon.
291;It certainly gets their vote.
292;I have seen this movie many times and it is hilarious.
293;I bought this one as a gift and can't wait to give it to this person.
294;He is a big fan of this movie.
295;Saw it years ago and it still has some funny parts.
296;I love this movie as I do all of Mel Brooks movies.
297;Highly recommend if you are a mel brooks fan.
298;Ordered it and received very quickly
299;But I love this movie!
300;I love how Mel brooks makes fun of everyone equally!
301;This is such a well.
302;and has some of the greatest one.
303;and great fun for a movie night!
304;Chocked full of what are now classic jokes yet thought provoking.
305;Anyone who can stand a bawdy joke should see this movie.
306;This Movie is probably Mel Brookes funniest movies and believe me thats saying a lot.
307;It has some pretty good specail features to.
308;it has a lot of funny parts in this movie like someone gotta go back and get a s**t load of dimes.
309;There are few movies I watch more than once, I have seen this one a dozen times or more.
310;One of the funniest movies of all time!
311;I remember watching this 20 years ago and laughed again when I watched it 20 years later.
312;This is a truly funny film.
313;what a Great western Spoof !!!!
314;One Of Mel Brooks Best Movies Ever !
315;A Must for any fan of his work !
316;This movie has to be one of the greatest ever made.
317;Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder are hilarious, the latter of which has some of the best timing i've ever seen from a comedic actor.
318;i own this on VHS (egads!)
319;it was worth it for me to stream it on demand from Amazon.
320;it's just as funny now as it was on the first viewing, 15 years ago.
321;Having seen this movie over and over again. . . I still love it.
322;It is such a classic comedy with a fantastic cast that every time I see it I find things/gags I missed earlier.
323;I think all races can laugh at themselves in this one.
324;A true Mel Brooks gem!
325;Great cast, of comedians reak the stage in this motion picture!
326;This is a very funny movie .
327;bLAZING SADDLES is littered with creativity and constant one.

340;BLAZING SADDLES will be remembered as one the best comedies of the 20th century, but also, one of the singular standout comedic performances of the century will be from this film.
341;Madeline Kahn's Lily Von Shtupp is, without a doubt, one of the best examples of how a brilliant comedic supporting performance can take on a life of its own and steal an entire movie.
342;The whole movie is one of the best examples of Mel Brooks' trademark style.
343;crazy chaos somehow weaving a cohesive tapestry by the end of the movie, and, somehow making perfect sense.

362;It has some more mature humor but is fantastic all the same.
363;The writing team of Brooks and Pryor and the acting of Little and Wilder made for an wild wild ride, using the classic western as a backdrop!

365;This movie is just as funny as it was when it first came out over 30 yrs ago.
366;This is a classic and only Mel Brooks could produce a movie that mocks racism this way.
367;due to the animated menu, Black Bart TV ep, tribute to Madeline Kahn and particulary the new doc on the making of the film.
368;it has the same audio commentary from the previous edition by Brooks but it is funny just the same.

385;Many people love this movie for its raunchy off colored humor.
386;Many people feel it is tooracist in nature to be funny.
387;Mel Brooks felt the best way to teach a lesson was through laughter.
388;If you take predjudice and laugh at it, does it not lose it's power.
389;Watch this movie with that point of view and it is funny all over again.
390;I'd recommend this to anyone who likes comedy with a purpose.
391;It played good and made a new fan of the movie.
392;A real Mel Brooks classic.
393;An unforgettable flick of endearing folks witty lines, this classic film will always be one of the highlites of my video collection!
394;This movie (along with 'Young Frankenstein') are two of my favorite comedies of all time.
395;This is a classic comedy that you cannot pass up!
396;So many classic lines, and to be politically correct , I cannot repeat any of them in this review.
397;time best movies ever made, and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of this movie.
398;it is a good example using humor to show the attitudes of the day when it was made.
399;it makes fun of everyone including itself.
400;After watching this film for years on cable tv, one truly looses the real essence of the film.
401;This film simply looks amazing!

405;Just watch Laugh and enjoy!
406;Still funny after all these years.
407;this is a classic movie.
408;the dialogue will keep you in stitches.
409;Simply put, this is the funniest movie ever made.
410;Harvey Korman, Slim Pickens and Madeline Kahn deserved Oscar's for their supporting roles.
411;Cleavon Little is great, and Gene Wilder gives one of his best performances as The Waco Kid .
412;a comedy classic not to be missed.
413;Arguably Mel's best comedy (and he's had some good ones).
414;broad as it is .
415;always makes me laugh hysterically.
416;Blazing Saddles is class Mel Brooks, and quite possibly his best production.
417;See this once and you will be quoting lines from the dialogue for the rest of your life.
418;I think this movie is one of the best Mel Brooks movies ever made.
419;It's a great comedy that is not politically correct and I love that.
420;I also recommend his movie History of the World Part I. Great great movie!
421;Highest form of hilarious cinematic slapstick and obvious double entendre humor.
422;Brooks is a genius and the cast a delight, with Alex Karras given some of the best lines.
423;It is funny every time you watch it.
424;One of the all time great parodies of the classic western ever made.
425;It is so outrageous and non politically correct that it can't help but be funny.
426;The movie is funny and makes a great spoof of most westerns.
427;What we are very impressed about is the delivery time.
428;We will do business with this shipper again soon!
429;We would definitely recommend to a friend!
430;It is for 18 years old and up!
431;It is a family favorite in my family!
432;He now has been let loose on the world Mel Brooks and has made it a summer mission to see all Brooks films.
433;This movie will keep you laughing and laughing no matter how many times you watch it.
434;Wanted to share it with my daughter.
435;Although the released version lacks some of the great gag's, it will and always will be one of the funnest movies of this decade.
436;This is one movie that belongs on every video shelf and should be shared with future generations.
437;The inspired casting of Alex Karas as Mongo and the magnificent Madeline Kahn are just two reasons.
438;But the entire cast is great.
439;Along with Young Frankenstein, this is Mel Brooks' best, followed closely by The Producers.
440;Belly laughs from beginning to end.
441;I hadn't seen this in years and forgot how funny it is.
442;It was fun to share with my teenage kids.
443;This is the best Mel Brooks movie.
444;Just remember, there is some raw humor, not for the faint of heart.
445;Still makes me laugh after 40 years.
446;This has always been one of my favorite comedies.
447;I have loved the actors and the humor contained in the plot of Blazing Saddles.
448;Warning: it contains some politically incorrection situations.
449;I love comedies and this one still makes me laugh.
450;Mel Brooks is a genius in my opinion.
451;i had heard there were some quotes that have gone down in history, but not sure the movie was worth watching to see where the quotes came from
452;I liked it, I think that too many people take themselves so seriously.
453;Blazing saddles gives a relief to that narrow type of outlook.
454;It's a comedy, and plain and simple a very good one.
455;Lighten up ,and just enjoy.
456;Blazing Saddles is such a classic.
457;They become friends and allies and save the day.
458;I think it's because the jokes are all very pointed, and they're funnier because they're true.
459;the biggest point of the movie is, of course, racism, and it's treated in a way unheard.
460;my sons, of course, loved it, and it sparked a lot of serious in.
461;Only thing is I wished Richard Pryor got to play the lead role however Cleavon Little is a fine actor!
462;This was a gift to a relative that mentioned it was one of his favorites.
463;I sneaked into the cinema when it was a double feature with Monty Python's Holy Grail.
464;It's a shame he hasn't had more starring roles since this film, because he can not only act, but is funny and very watchable.
465;It was this grounding in Westerns that makes Blazing Saddles so enjoyable for me.
466;And Amazon got it to me a couple of weeks before the due date, too!
467;I have always enjoyed this movie!Sit back and just laugh and laugh.
468;Perhaps it's understandable that a film 37 years after its release no longer is funny.
469;I love the lines in this movie.
470;If you have a sense of humor and not PC, get it.
471;He enjoyed seeing it again with a friend, they laughed a lot.
472;Fun, wonderful, bold and so incredibly tacky it takes your breath away.
473;i love him and his movies.
474;The movie sort'a peters out in the last 1/2 hour but you can forgive that cuz' the first 2/3 are so hilarious.
475;Too funny and full of sayings used around the work place not to have and watch once a year!
476;A classic funny movie, if you are kind of sick like me!!
477;If you love Mel Brooka, (The Producers, Young Frankenstein, High Anxiety) this is a must see.
478;Madeline Kahn singing in a saloon as Marlena Deitrich is a great scene.
479;(I also recommend Spaceballs, another Mel Brooks classic)
480;I watched this with my 25 yr old son last week and he loved it!
481;Considering how much entertainment is available these days, the fact that this movie can still be very entertaining really says something.
482;finally moved from VHS with this classic comedy from the master.
483;nonstop laughs with this must for any movie collection.
484;This is a great movie and my favorite movie of all time.
485;I have watched this one many times over and it is still just as funny as when I first saw it.
486;Mel Brooks overdoes the role of the Governor a bit, but is redeemed by his supporting cast.
487;Gene wilder and Cleavon Little are great together.
488;Harvey Korman is at his best!
489;The writing is interesting, the story is typical (of a western) the timing of the lines and slapstick is perfectly done.
490;a must own if you enjoy a great Mel Brooks flick!
491;Slim Pickens does an especially good job!
492;BLAZING SADDLES is what many regard as Mel Brooks' best film that announces its intentions right at the beginning when the African.
493;Cleavon Little is just marvelous as the African.
494;of the sexual kind, that is .
495;"The film is replete with memorable sequences: the scene where the cowboys break wind after eating beans
I:8336;496;At once a homage to and a spoof of classic westerns of the mid.
I:8336;497;twentieth century, this is a film to watch again and again.
I:8336;498;Mel Brooks is a genius.
I:8336;499;This is a piece of American humor.
I:8336;500;It's amazing, looking back, just how much variety this succinct satire of the western genre is able to put on display.
I:8336;501;Crammed full of every type of joke, pun and ruse imaginable, it's the perfect vehicle for an in.
I:8336;502;More impressively, it's able to make those wild leaps from pointed, hilarious dialog to silly sight gags to dense, dark satire without disrupting the flow of the story and becoming an undisciplined series of loosely.
I:8336;503;That it can also be so funny amidst a subject matter so heavy, (Brooks tackles racism and government corruption amidst the obvious parodies of an overpopulated genre) is further testament to his talents.
I:8336;504;One of the greatest movies of all time!
I:8336;505;Such a great cast of stars!
I:8336;506;Everyone should see this classic movie.
I:8336;507;Classic Mel Brook's, written with Richard Pryor.
I:8336;508;This movie is always good for a few laughs!
I:8336;509;I have watched this in past but looking at it again it still is quite funny and entertaining as well.
I:8336;510;The merits of this landmark comedy are well known to moviegoers and don't need additional insight.
I:8336;511;The shock value of much of Brooks' humor has diminished somewhat with age, but it is still genuinely funny and rewatchig it for the umpteenth time remains very enjoyable.
I:8336;512;The regular release was great so even if it isn't what I hope, I will still enjoy it.
I:8336;513;Mongo is funny, and Gene Wilder gives a fantastic dramatic performance as always.
I:8336;514;which is simply the best movie ever made).
I:8336;515;Mel Brooks has a supporting role in this film, as he usually does, but the joke Harvey Korman has in his monologue is only the funnier as the lovely and talented Madeline Kahn actually WON the Oscar!
I:8336;516;Clevon Little nailed his part so perfectly that he became a central piece of history (as the star of the funniest movie ever made).
I:8336;517;Helped by the great Gene Wilder (a longtime friend of Mel brooks), they save the day from """"Hedley"""" Lamar (Harvey Korman in his best role ever) and Slim Pickens (in his best role outside of Dr. Strangelove)."""
518;The acting really *is* that good.
519;The humor is genuine, with only one fart scene (probably the original extended fart scene) and the undertones of exactly how STUPID racism is and how STUPID racists are, are dealt with, with so much humor that it comes across as truly enjoyable and hard to find offensive.
520;Mel Brooks pushes all boundaries to teach us valuable life lessons while making us laugh so hard that we sometimes fail to notice exactly how seriously he takes these things.
521;This will ultimately be seen as Mel Brooks' greatest work far and away.
522;The closest movie of greatness to this masterpiece of Mel's greatness is Young Frankenstein, which is a must.
523;Lesser vehicles of Mel Brooks' humorous genius are History of the World (Part 1), and The Producers .
524;That is all there is to it.
525;If you have any sense of humor, you will more than likely love this movie.
526;I loved this movie the first time I saw it.
527;It is still one of my favorite comedies.
528;Prime streaming makes it easy to enjoy what I want, when I want .
529;Takes you on a wild west exposing those idio.
530;A wild and Funky time living in a time of the Stailest Part of History capturing the oddest outward appearences with Knowone being left out of the critical eye of the affore mentioned director.
531;A delightfully timed movie and laugh.
532;"barred hilarity, ""Blazing Saddles"" just doesn't seem to age as well as 1968's ""The Producers"" and what I consider his filmmaking high point, his other 1974 film, ""Young Frankenstein""."
533;There are definitely funny moments, but his Western take.
534;Cleavon Little is the right choice for this role as he maintains a nice, easy balance between rule.
535;"Brooks is still funny and full of insight about all aspects of the production, such as the film's original title (not ""Black Bart"" as generally believed but ""Tex X"" as a pointed reference to Malcolm X) and the ill."
536;"of feature, ""Back in the Saddle"", produced in 2001 and about half an hour long, and it includes the surviving cast members and writers reminiscing about their good times on the set."
537;There are also a few dispensable additional scenes, a three.
538;Definitely worth revisiting for the big laughs.
539;I like this one a lot.
540;It's one of, if not the funniest movies ever made.
541;A great cast, hysterical story and great theme song that should be on every ipod.
542;One great, funny as hell movie!
543;The mouvies is good, some times is getting too much of black humor.
544;still laugh just as hard
545;Mel Brooks is a comedy genius, and this movie will forever stand as one of his best and one to watch over and over again.
546;One of the funniest movies of all time!
547;it was truly a funny movie in the context of it's time.
548;It's a fun anniversary special of a great Mel Brooks movie.
549;Mel Brooks was quoted in our local paper as saying it was the funniest movie EVER.
550;The colors are spot on and the level of sharpness is top notch.
551;This release showcases an excellent video transfer of this movie.
552;it'll keep this short and sweet.
553;Blazing Saddles was funny 30 years ago, it was funny then, and even funnier now!
554;This politically incorrect '74 comedy by Mel Brooks is a classic, no doubt about that.
555;It goes way beyond the boundaries of both satire and slapstick.
556;The film satirizes the racism that's found in old traditional western dramas (and in American culture), while it completely avoids political correctness with its raunchy verbal and physical comedy.
557;There are so many memorable moments in this film that it's hard to keep track.
558;Almost everything about this movie is incredibly hilarious (the infamous fart scene, for example).
559;Yes, 36 years have passed, and Blazing Saddles still holds up very well.
560;Even though there are a couple of jokes that don't really work, this film is pure comedy gold.
561;O. k. Finally without question, we have agreement on what is the funniest movie ever made.
562;They created comic chaos, and did it throughout several levels in this movie.
563;His companion, The Waco Kid, is a splendidly cast Gene Wilder, the fastest right hand on any left handed gunslinger in the world.
564;Madeline Kahn is magnificent in her send.
565;one is funnier than Slim Pickens who has some of the funniest (and most tasteless) lines in the movie.
566;After more than a dozen times seeing this movie, sometimes just hearing a line from it makes me crack up.
567;Saddles is, a full quarter century later, still the funniest movie it has ever been my privilege to view.
568;A well placed quote of any of a dozen lines from this movie will make the most serious folks erupt into laughter.
569;This is clearly one of Mel Brooks' best films (along with Young Frankenstein).
570;In today's politically correct climate, one wonders whether any studio would have the guys to produce this film.
571;Fortunately for us, the film holds up very well, and it always rewards repeated visits.
572;"I cannot say enough about this movie so I will keep it short and quick, funny, when it was realeased and still funny, all the actors were awesome the storyline was a typical Mel Brooks storyline, yes this movie was considered riskee' when It was released, but it is a kick in the pants to watch, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who has or hasn
I:8336;573;That said, Slim Pickens is the best part of this whole movie, every scene with him still shines.
I:8336;574;Excellent movie that doesn't age.
I:8336;575;I laughed just as hard as I did the first time I saw it.
I:8336;576;Blazing Saddles is one of the funniest movies ever made yet to understand the humor requires some understanding of the New Yorker perspective.
I:8336;577;Still there are more laughs packed in then any other movie around.
I:8336;578;Mel Brooks is one of our favourites and I wanted to get this for my dad for Father's Day.
I:8336;579;It was delivered on time and he absolutely enjoyed watching it.
I:8336;580;This movie had me laughing from start to finish.
I:8336;581;But if you want pure laughter, bawdy humor, and an ending that is like no other this one is for you.
I:8336;582;Still funny after all these years.
I:8336;583;If you have never seen one of his offerings, I highly recommend that you take a look.
I:8336;584;I thought that this was the funniest movies ever made.
I:8336;585;Slim Pickens was great as the cowboy leader.
I:8336;586;The one who played Hedley Lamarr was the best.
I:8336;587;I think it has aged well, and that it is one of the films that everyone should see at least once.
I:8336;588;I've seen it a hundred times including it's theater debut and it's still hilarious even though I know what's going to happen next.
I:8336;589;Mel Brooks and his cronies made this one of the funniest movies of all time.
I:8336;590;Blazing Saddles, a 1974 comedy western spoof, is a wonderful romp by the one and only Mel Brooks himself.
I:8336;591;With this film, he made THE best film of his career and also, THE best Western Parody ever made for the silver screen.
I:8336;592;Lamarr convinces the governor that appointing him will mark him in history and ensure him of a strong political future where he could wind up as president of the USA and that it's a wonderful idea.
I:8336;593;Later on, the citizens of the town discover what the attorney general is really up to and what he really wants to do with their small town, and band together with Bart and Waco to beat them.
I:8336;594;mel Brooks delivers THE very best film of his career and also, THE best western parody and also, the funniest western film ever made.
I:8336;595;Blazing Saddles is a knee slapping and foot stompingly funny movie.
I:8336;596;No pet rock goes unturned in this wickedly funny western spoof that still holds up well after over three decades.
I:8336;597;This film is still as funny as heck and no matter how many times that this film is watched, it is still a funny and entertaining romp that never gets dull no matter how many times that it is watched.
I:8336;598;Brooks does a fantastic job capturing this film in all of it's wicked glory and he does keep you entertained from the beginning to the very end.
I:8336;599;the film was also nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Music, Best Original Song, Best Supporting Actress(Madeline Khan)and Best Film Editing.
I:8336;600;It also received two BAFTA nominations for Best Newcomer (Cleavon Little) and Best Screenplay.
I:8336;601;It won the Writer's Guild Award for it's screenplay.
I:8336;602;mel Brooks also wanted John Wayne(may he also rest in peace) to appear in the film in a cameo role, but after reading the script, John Wayne, though he said to Brooks that he loved the script, turned it down because he felt that it would ruin his family image at the time, but said that he would be one of the first in line to see the film when the film premiered.
I:8336;603;pROS: The movie looks even more colorful.
I:8336;604;The audio sounds great and the soundtrack sounds crisp.
I:8336;605;The special features include a Mel Brooks commentary discussing certain scenes.
I:8336;606;It also has a cast/crew reunion documentary called """"Back In The Saddle"""" and the final two things are an intimate portrait of Madeline Khan and the pilot Black Bart, that was spun."""
607;Again, this film still holds up well after over three decades after it's initial theatrical release as it is still as funny as heck and never gets dull.
608;Those films were good as well, but Blazing Saddles is still THE best of them all.
609;The film was a commercial success, though not a blockbuster.
610;overall, Blazing Saddles is wickedly funny western parody film that is not only the funniest western film ever made, but also, THE best western parody film ever made.
611;Although many of the jokes don't quite have the same effect as they did at the time of release which is what you would expect from most comedies as society moves on and comedies are really from and of the time that they are made however, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself at least chuckling at quite a few of the gags.
612;"There are many parallels to an earlier Western spoof which I still think is the superior one ""Cat Ballou"" and I get the impression that Mel was even spoofing this spoof!"
613;"As a fan of great music I was also pleased to see a cameo of the great Count Basie too and if you remember it was Nat King Cole in ""Cat Ballou""."
614;"funny insanity at the end, ""Cat Ballou"" still holds the title as the best ever Western spoof."
615;Mild by comparison today, BS was just a little ahead of its time and a lot of fun.
616;Mel Brooks was in his prime and let everything hang out in this very funny movie.
617;This is my favorite movie .
618;It's classic Mel Brooks, with some sly pokes at politics and religion.
619;The edges are sharp, the colors are rich, I have never seen Blazing Saddles like this before.
620;The audio is also very good.
621;if you're a Mel Brooks fan, this one is well worth getting on blu.
622;It's a comedy classic, of course, and it's now over.35 years old.
623;We watched it last night and I got a lot of laughs.
624;In any case, we both enjoyed it.
625;Blazing Saddles is a comedic western spoof and anything goes.
626;color humor, political incorrectness, you name it.
627;And the actors and cast are obviously having fun putting this thing together.
628;Blazing Saddles provided good relief after a tough day, that's for sure.
629;roaringly hilarious send up of everything Western.
630;Even the bit players leave you crying with laughter!
631;"The top notch script, written by a ""collective"" of writers including Richard Pryor(who wrote most of the more racially charged material and finds it hilarious), is so full of verbal jabs and visual japes that you will find yourself visiting this movie over and over again when you need a good dose of laughter."
632;Don't let the conservatives scare you off, this is one of the funniest films ever made!
633;With writing by Richard Pryor and Mel Brooks, this movie offends.
634;That is the beauty of it.
635;Other than that the incredible writing team pulled off a gentle blend of satire, cynicism, political humor, and Methodist humor that pales to what we could achieve today.
636;The humor you find here is in its shock value.
637;That is how this movie will survive long into this century as a great comedy movie.
638;High Anxiety, Young Frankenstein, The Producers, are a fine films but they never can capture the spark at the time Blazing Saddles did.
639;gene, Clevon, and Harvey made for an awesome team.
640;He passed away many years ago but to hear him laugh again in my head is a special gift.
641;Classic from the hilarious Mel Brooks.
642;if you love comedy this is for you.
643;It was a great movie when it came out and it is still a great movie all these years latter!
644;C'mon Mel, crank out another great slapstick piece .
645;the best movie seen in years and one of the funniest ,you must see this ,you will love it to
646;Blazing Saddles is even surprising to someone has seen it before.
647;Get it and enjoy it!
648;Always good for a laugh.
649;I really like how Mel Brooks did this film.
650;The entire film is such a goofball that it can't help but be very funny.
651;All the characters are extremely funny plus all the actors do such a fine job in their roles that I honestly don't think anyone else could do a better job.
652;it would be far more enjoyable.
653;As a little kid, I loved this movie.
654;i give it two stars because I remember a funny movie i loved as a kid.
655;This movie has just one funny scene after one hillarious sight gag after one slap happy great moment.
656;Mel Brooks fooling around in the sheriffs office is amusing as well.
657;Cleavon Little as the good natured sheriff keeps a happy disposition no matter how much everyone ridicules him.
658;This is a first rate video for any collection.
659;This movie is a comedy classic.
660;What makes the movie so funny is that it makes fun of just about every ethnic and racial group.
661;in addition to making fun of just about everyone, it has Mel Brooks over the top sense of humor, and a great cast.
662;i got my copy as a gift from a friend that got it for me because i borrowed it quite alot from him.
663;Got to be one of the funniest movies ever made.
664;Well written, wonderfully acted with a lack of reverence that just makes it a joy to watch over and over and over.
665;every single line is funny or so it seems.
666;another great Mel Brooks movie.
667;I love this movie you either love it or hate it.
668;My son loves it as well we text lines from the movie all the time.
669;Very hilarious movie but you have to have an open mind.
670;He still has a knack for writing and producing very funny off color movies.
671;This was definitely Mel Brook's crowning achievement.
672;, it is the supporting cast that truly made this the all.
673;time classic it is today.
674;Slim Pickens first line in the movie is unforgettable, Harvey Korman's hilarious bad guy (that's HEDLEY!)
675;All are hilarious and each of them steals the show at some point in the film.
676;That part where Mongo punches out the horse is a classic clip.
677;One terrific character in the film not mentioned in other reviews here is frontier gibberish.
678;But the true gift of this film is that every kind of humor is used, from subtle situational humor to in.your.
679;Truly a funny movie that is appreciated by several generations today and will continue to be so in the future.
680;this version of the film is identical to the theatrical version and previous video releases.
681;It's heart is thoroughly in the right place and those critics would do well to remember that the script was co. written by the great Richard Pryor.
682;Watching Blazing Saddles again after many years gone by still makes me laugh.
683;Great movie, but those who like to be offended, will be.
684;I have always enjoyed this movie.
685;Its nice to have it at hand, anytime.
686;interviews were enjoyable and what I would expect.
687;This is the best movie ever.
688;a must see for everyone.
689;This movie has just gotten better over the year
690;This had to be hands down the funniest movie ever.
691;Funny, language not for kids but ok ay most grown ups.
692;I watch few movies all the way through.
693;Old, yes, but fresh in its take on stereotypes.
694;this film will be an altime classic comedy.
695;Our whole family knows all the lines and reference it often.
696;perhaps the best comedy ever released on celluloid.
697;I rate Saddles higher than history, though, and it's a decent evening's entertainment.
698;The Director's narrative on this movie is fun, I didn't realize that Richard Pryor was a writer for the movie.
699;Always a great movie to watch to liven up the mood.
700;It will always be a classic.
701;It contains a masterful cast, Gene Wilder, Cleavon Little, Madeline Kahn and many more.
702;I watched it constantly, and to this day it still makes me laugh.
703;busting laugh riot film that deserves more respect than it gets.
704;The classic movie from Mel Brooks I thought could't get any better until Blu.
705;The price was great and delivery quick.
706;If you haven't seen it, please do.
707;Blazing Saddles has earned the spot on the American Film Institute's top 100 comedies of all.
708;And by watching this movie, you will agree.
709;An absolutely hilarious and distinct memorial to Mel Brooks, a true medicine for what ails anyone country born and raised.
710;this movie was funny the time it came in was good it played very well thanks to everyone who help to get the movie out to our family
711;Blazing Saddles is a top western comedy that pokes fun at the way people act.
712;The movie was never made to be historically accurate, just funny.
713;If you can look past the political correctness of today, you will enjoy this movie.
714;Mel Brooks does it perfectly in this send up of western films!
715;It is a comedy classic.
716;ray, it is a decent one.
717;ray titles to be sure, but it looks as good as I have ever seen it look here in Blu.
718;ray High Def!No older film is going to look perfect in high def, and flaws are to be expected, but this is still a nice transfer overall.
719;As always brooks has a humorous command of the English language.
720;while the movie is full of racial slurs it is done such that it speaks to the human condition much more than just one slice of it.
721;Best Mel Brooks movie of all time.
722;Best movie for the money, just know it has racist tones so some may be offended.
723;Besides the man Mel Brooks is Jewish and only does it to even poke fun at people of all races.
724;Great flick which still stands up to today's movies.
725;I absolutely love this movie.
726;Mel Brooks did a perfect send up on the western with Blazing Saddles.
727;My favorite classic comedy and by far one of Mel Brooks' finest films.
728;I am glad to see that amazon allows it to be viewed
729;I saw it in the theatre when it first came out, and laughed my head off.
730;The base was showing this film, and I told my brother that he had to see it.
731;Needless to say, he loved it to, along with most of the other guys stationed there!
732;The campfire scene itself is worth the price of admission!
733;This movie was the start of Mel Brooks best comedies.
734;cheek comedy, this is for you.
735;On the surface, it's just a lot of vulgar jokes, but if you look deeper, you'll find a great story.
736;It was a great gift for someone who'd never seen it.
737;"Mel Brooks, by the way, does a great Harpo impression in the outtakes, but that's beside the point
I:8336;738;The Sheriff, a """"big underground success,"""" actually wins over the townsfolk and becomes a spanner in the works."""
739;If you've never seen this movie, do yourself a favor: go and get it!!!
740;This is one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen.
741;I think it is even better than Young Frankenstein.
742;The film has many sight gags and funny moments, as when some of Hedley's men encounter a group of black men.
743;If you are a fan of Mel Brooks, you will love this film.
744;Great cast and incredible humor that breaks the boundaries of racism and stereotypes.
745;Love the lead actors and Mel Brooks.
746;It was good to be on the trail again.
747;This movie truly is a classic and is a ton of fun to watch!!!
748;It 'spoofs' so many old westerns and produces a lot of laughs.
749;The cast is great and very talented.
750;This movie had always been one of my favorites.
751;Now it's even better I'm blu Ray.
752;All acting in this movie is great, but using Kahn was a great move on Brooks' part.
753;My best friend loves this movie.
754;It has its funny parts.
755;Good to watch once every few years.
756;This is an absolutely amazing movie and i would suggest it to anyone.
757;I gave this movie to a friend and she loved it.
758;This great movie from Mel Brooks is a comedy classic!!!
759;One of Mel brooks greatest comedies.
760;a good flick that will keep you laughing with its originality and classic one.
761;for those who don't mind the dark borders,I recommend the widescreen version.
762;but whatever version you see,except the t. v. one,you'll enjoy this funny and enjoyable picture.
763;Funny as all get out!
764;"I gave it to my husband for Christmas
I:8336;765;This was fine. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I:8336;766;I have always had fun watching this movie.
I:8336;767;A friend and I were talking about the song sung by Madeline Kahn, I'm Tired , and I just had to watch it again!
I:8336;768;It was just as humorous as I remembered it to be.
I:8336;769;I would recommend this movie.
I:8336;770;A Fantastic addition to any collection.
I:8336;771;It's movie has some of the greatest quotes ever.
I:8336;772;Must be a generational thing.
I:8336;773;i've seen it so many times on regular TV, I forgot about the many, many times the """"N"""" word is used."""
774;Just letting you know if that kind of thing bothers you.
775;The picture and sound is excellent.
776;i love it when you find a Special Feature that is good, it's like finding a gem.
777;"They continue the ""N"" word tradition that's for sure."
778;watch it and you will see why, well, watch it and imagine it's on during primetime in 1975 and you will see why.
779;But, it is quite entertaining and a good find.
780;"I think it is Mel Brooks' best
I:8336;781;You'll laugh from the first scene until the final scene.
I:8336;782;Awesome movie, done well and has the kind of humor I grew up with.
I:8336;783;Great movie for the world that is trapped in political correctness.
I:8336;784;another Mel Brooks, Classic movie, Every one I know who watches it, wants to see it again, this movie is so damn funny
I:8336;785;Classic funny movie from when parody's were actually funny.
I:8336;786;This is one of the best films of all time.
I:8336;787;If you have watched this movie on TV with all the great lines bleeped out, you must own it and see it for the first time on your home big screen to understand it completely.
I:8336;788;Mel Brooks is a genius with comedy.
I:8336;789;This is a classic Mel Brooke's movie.
I:8336;790;There is so much humor throughout the movie that you should be laughing for days.
I:8336;791;It surely is one I definitely would have on my shelf.
I:8336;792;Saw it again many years later and was blown away by how funny and non.
I:8336;793;A great movie, as long as you have a sense of humor and aren't easily offended.
I:8336;794;Perhaps the best Movie Mel Brooks Has made.
I:8336;795;A funny """"Spoof"""" of the western movies and the racial antics from the time."""
796;"The Movie is very funny and Is about a Group of people who want to run townfolk out of ""ROCK."
797;plenty of classic Mel Brooks comedy and gags.
798;A Mel Brooks true timeless Classic.
799;Great price on a classic movie.
800;If you haven't seen this one, it's hysterical!
801;I just love the hysterical un.
802;It's refreshing to lose yourself for a little while in this, or any of Mel Brooks' movies.
803;Very funny, but for the grown.
804;Everything is fair game in this move.
805;This is Mel Brooks at his best, and it's one of the best comedies ever made.
806;I was lucky to see this in a theatre on the first day of the run.
807;Great interviews and commentaries of the actors.
808;They made fun of everyone.
809;It is a classic Mel brooks, and we bought it to replace our missing copy.
810;Our kids are finally old enough to appreciate the humor, so it is a fun family movie providing you have the right age group.
811;This movie is great satire and very humorous for adults.
812;It is probably viewed by some as politically incorrect, but it is satire!
813;Cleavon Little does an excellent job of being the town's new sheriff.
814;As always, a classic, now we can watch it over and over again!
815;Love this classic movie for viewing on the go!
816;don't listen to mr. intellectual above, this is a gem of a movie.
817;worth seeing for 'mongo' alone.
818;A movie that makes fun of every race, It cracks me up every time I watch it.
819;Blazing Saddles is a great movie!
820;A little bit of the humor is dated, but I got most of it and I am in my teens and this is definitely one of my favorite movies.
821;It isn't even neccesarily immature humor, but it's really funny.
822;One of my favorite lines in the movie is the ditto part early on.
823;But every scene is very good.
824;I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes movies by the Zucker.
825;I think Blazing Saddles is funnier, at least compared to the parts of Young Frankenstein I've seen.
826;Have fun with this movie, and it's at least as good the second time you see it.
827;For a spoof movie fan, this is a must.
828;By far the strongest movie in the Brooks stable of send.
829;Rock Ridge won't get out of his way, so he hires a black man as sheriff of the town, thinking this will accomplish his goal.
830;"Together they clean up the town, foil Heddy's (""Hed."
831;"ley's"") plans, and tear up a small portion of Hollywood along the way."
832;this movie is completely un.
833;Need I honestly say more?
834;A movie that the whole family can enjoy.
835;Scene for scene, Blazing Saddles is the second funniest movie ever made, Red Dawn being the first.
836;This (along with Young Frankenstein ) represents the summit of Mel Brooks' genius.
837;this is totally uninhibited fun and one of the few gag.
838;Not only that, the performances are brilliant, especially Kahn's, though Little and Wilder make a charming team, and Korman really chews up the scenery.
839;Even underappreciated Dom DeLouise has a hilarious cameo.
840;It really has terrific zip to it.
841;I can't believe I'm giving this movie four stars instead of five, since it is my nomination as the funniest film ever made.
842;"I bought this new disc because it promised a ""scene specific"" commentary by Mel Brooks."
843;When Sandy found out that I had never seen Blazing Saddles , she made sure that i would see it.
844;She owns the movie and brought it over last week and we sat down to watch it.
845;the opening song starts playing and the humor in it sets the mood for what is coming.
846;there are too many great lines and memorable scenes to make it worthwhile to list.
847;Considering how funny, and how good this movie is, I'm surprised that i have never seen this great movie about a black sheriff in a prejudiced white western town.
848;It is a decent track, as Brooks discusses how this movie got off the ground.
849;excellent movie, short on special features
850;The fact that I bought it in Blu.
851;I thought this film was well done in a sense, as far as spoofs go.
852;I feel that this film is among the best of the best of Mel Brooks, and was truly a torch to light the way to many other great Brooks creations over the years.
853;I watch it at least once a year for the sure fun of it.
854;A knee slapping good time, comedy that was truly funny.
855;The actors were very good in their parts and Mel had his usual jokes flying left and right.
856;first, the short reunion reel, Back in the Saddle (about 24 minutes) is fantastic.
857;Great insight from the original screenwriter, Mel, the surviving actors, etc. second, the 5.1 mix is a nice touch.
858;Definitely makes the playback more dynamic for those of us with home theaters.
859;so most of these new twists are great.
860;What compelled me to inform other fans of Saddles is that the scene.
861;plastic jewel case is nice.
862;Just about everyone imaginable becomes the target of Mel Brooks's shamelessly funny lampooning, and Harvey Korman, Slim Pickens, and the great Gene Wilder turn in some of the loopiest performances of their careers.
863;Madeline Kahn is especially memorable as Lilli Von Shtupp, a Marlene Dietrich.
864;Blazing Saddles is one of the best movies ever made a tipical Mel Brooks movie in the comedy and the cast of stars in the movie.
865;Not many movies you can watch 40 years after it was released and it is as good now as it was then.
866;If you like Mel Brooks, this is a must see movie.
867;The humor is dedinitly from the 70's.
868;If you like Yiddish humor you will love this movie.
869;excerpt from a Lifetime special.
870;Like the ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA Sergio Leone documentary, it takes the bits relating to the film and puts them together .
871;good documentary and probably the best thing on here.
872;Still, not as good as some other retrospectives made.
873;Just wait 'till you see it.
874;The new transfer is excellent and unlike VACATION anniversary edition this comes with 5.1 Dolby Surround (yay!)
875;but overall it's really nothing extraordinary .
876;Every actor is superb .
877;Yes, he actually said that during a Dark Helmet sequence.
878;One of the funniest movies ever made by that comedic genius, Mel Brooks.
879;The speaker watches and describes the movie in real.
880;the actual commentary by Brooks is an interesting one but is definitely not a screen.
881;I've seen this movie at least 30 times and it always makes me laugh.
882;It helps if you love Mel Brooks' warped humor.
883;One of my all time favorites!
884;I am a fan of all things Mel Brooks, but I think this is his best work.
885;I could watch this movie 10 times a day, every day, and it would never get old.
886;It deserves to be seen by everybody at least once, but that's about it.
887;I look forward to using this service more.
888;Very funny movie, all around classic film by Mel Brooks.
889;He managed to attack racism in a funny and open way.
890;Plus, this movie makes for a great drinking game in college.
891;A perfect day would start with a viewing of Spaceballs, followed by Monty Python's Holy Grail leading into Blazing Saddles.
892;A work of pure genius.
893;A comedy masterpiece for the ages.
894;Great cast and lots of funny innuendo.
895;This is one of those movies that jokingly offends most people with stereotypes and classic comedy.
896;I highly recommend watching this at least once all the way through.
897;I first saw this as a kid and it is even more hilarious now that I'm older and can catch the references to other movies and social situations.
898;This movie has much more in it than comedy.
899;Of course that being said you will laugh till the cows in the lobby come home.
900;The fantastic Mr. Mel Brooks shatters the western genre lovingly.
901;This was my Dad's favorite movie, now I see why.
902;Would recommend to anyone who needs a good laugh.
903;I love this movie and can watch it over and over again, it is always funny and never dull.
904;This is classic Mel Brooks doing what he does best.
905;He spoofs accepted movie genre, pokes fun at cliches' and leaves us rolling with laughter.
906;Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder are hilarious.
907;This movie is a must.
908;Some of the jokes fall flat, but this is still the most memorable comedy flick of all time.
909;In the seventies, Mel Brooks co. wrote and directed a handful of comedies that remain today among the funniest movies of all time.
910;gene Wilder is great as the Waco Kid, Cleavon Little is terrific as the newly appointed sheriff, Madeline Kahn is wonderful as Lily the lounge singer, and Harvey Korman gives one of his best performances as the villain, Hedley Lamarr.
911;Blazing Saddles has more inspired gags and silliness in it than most contemporary comedies combined.
912;We laugh at the film, but laugh at ourselves at the same time.
913;Mel Brooks is comedic genius at its best.
914;Made me laugh and laugh.
915;A must see for anyone who is a fan of the great Mel Brooks.
916;bLAZING SADDLES is an even better (meaning more worthwhile) example of this phenomenon.
917;ultimately, it's about the comparatively mild .
918;but i'm in danger of painting a deceptively clinical, even solemn, picture of one of the greatest comedies ever put to film.
919;Stanley Kubrick once said, in reference to his greatest work, DR. STRANGELOVE, that comedy sometimes makes more sene than drama because it's permitted to take into account the bizarre.
920;it's everything you want a comedy film, Mel Brooks or otherwise, to be.
921;This was a very funny movie for it's time and it still is for some people.
922;My husband has watched this numerous times and loves it.
923;I remember watching this in the theatre when it came out.
924;I just laughed and laughed.
925;in one of the best comedies ever made.
926;"The movie already has four great songs
I:8336;927;dozen more of similar caliber would make for a strong score.
I:8336;928;but 'The Producers' was a cult film that never made it to Main Street and needed the second act of a Broadway musical to give it a place in popular culture.
I:8336;929;In the summer of Watergate and Patty Hearst, here was one bit of madness people could enjoy.
I:8336;930;In order to live together, we have to laugh together first.
I:8336;931;He's very good, bringing a lightness to the role that's equal parts Shaft and Bugs Bunny.
I:8336;932;He makes for a sympathetic center, and he is flash in those corduroy threads.
I:8336;933;solid cast around him, particularly Harvey Korman as Attorney General Hedley Lamarr.
I:8336;934;Her Baba Wawa meets Marlene Dietrich performance is a comic masterpiece, and it takes guts to wear that dead.
I:8336;935;gunslinger known as the Waco Kid, but he grows into the role well enough.
I:8336;936;'Blazing Saddles' is one of the most significant video titles because it rewards repeat viewings so well.
I:8336;937;It's a cultural landmark, yes, but it's even funnier now than it was 30 years ago, one of the funniest comedies that exist today.
I:8336;938;Mell Brooks is one of the great comedy writters of this era and Blazing Saddles is the apitamy of his work.
I:8336;939;He takes ordinary situatuions and adds a funny twist.
I:8336;940;This is the best Mel Brook's movie made because it had a great cast for one.
I:8336;941;The cast in this one just blend good.
I:8336;942;All of Mel Brooks' movies have a cast that blend well.
I:8336;943;This is the best to me because it is the first Mel Brooks movie I saw when I was young.
I:8336;944;I still laugh at it so if you want to see a good Mel Brooks movie and u have never seen one start with this one.
I:8336;945;It is the funniest movie that I have ever seen and has been my favorite since it first came out!!!
I:8336;946;This movie is a great piece of Mel Brooks comedy.
I:8336;947;Much of this movie's allure comes the use of non politically correct humor but to a useful end.
I:8336;948;It does show how even in the face of adversity, people really can overcome their assumptions and prejudices to work towards a common goal.
I:8336;949;If you are looking for sophistication, go somewhere else, but if you are looking for a spoof comedy that you can just sit and enjoy, it's here!
I:8336;950;I'm sure it's as good in that format as well.
I:8336;951;We love all the extras that came with this one.
I:8336;952;It is a nifty packaging system.
I:8336;953;I think this movie is absolutely hysterical.
I:8336;954;The physical comedy (falling down, making faces, shooting things) is super funny.
I:8336;955;The movie was to be part of a wedding anniversary gift.
I:8336;956;They thought that it was hilarious .
I:8336;957;This is very generous of you, and I thank you very much.
I:8336;958;Now, I can enjoy having it in my film library!
I:8336;959;This is truly the funniest movie I've ever seen, along with A Fish Called Wanda.
I:8336;960;The characters are a riot, and lots of bawdy stuffhappens.
I:8336;961;He and Gene Wilder are as funny as ever in this classic.
I:8336;962;good humor never stops making you laugh and it is especially true in this case.
I:8336;963;High Anxiety and """"Silent Movie""""."""
964;Blazing Saddles was not my particular brand of humor but I have to admit, very funny.
965;I rate it at four stars and Mel Brooks has never been very good at political correctness anyhow.
966;This is one of the best classic Filmsin Hollywood CA.
967;"I got new appreciation for this classic sendup of westerns when late one night I saw ""High Plains Drifter"" and realized where many of the ideas in Blazing Saddles came from (much like ""Airplane"" was a sendup of ""Zero Hour"")."
968;I can add nothing else to what has been written here except that I've seen it 167 times and it keeps getting funnier every single time!
969;"(OK, I borrowed that line, but it fits lol) Between this, Young Frankenstein (spoofing ""Son of Frankenstein"") and History Of The World you see Brooks' at his best."
970;Mel Brooks timeless masterpiece of forbidden humor.
971;He knew how to do it.
972;Blazing Saddles is a great Mel Brooks film that would, in no possible way, make it to the theaters today.
973;It is a hilarious comedy that is, in many aspects, more true to the cultural dilemmas of the time than The Patriot.
974;"or when the elderly lady tells sheriff bart ""up yours' N."" when all he is doing is wishing her good day ."
975;there are many many funny moments in this movie .
976;Old time favorite movie, its a classic and the actors are top notch, it doesn't get any funnier than this
977;This movie is so funny, and picks away at stereotypes in a way that keeps you laughing for the entire movie.
978;The ensemble cast is perfect and you will watch it again and again to catch all of the little things you missed the first, second, or third.
979;This is a classic in our eyes!
980;I had forgotten a number of the funny spots (at least to me), so if you haven't seen it in a while, it is worth a look.
981;In places I am sure most people would say it is kind of stupid, but humor varies from person to person.
982;I think this is Mel Brook's funniest movie but Frankenstein vies for that honor too.
983;Lots of cameo performances too if you look.
984;Still makes me laugh out loud.
985;Always cracks me up and makes me laugh.
986;It was funny when it came out and it still is.
987;I could recite this entire movie script, word for word and still laugh every time I see it again.
988;I thought it was funny back then.
989;My 14 year old son loved it as he loves all the Mel Brooks movies.
990;This is a classic and absolutely must see film for anyone who is not easily offended, such as myself.
991;Blazing Saddles is an awsome funny hillarios movie, ordering from Amazon is the best,safest and quickest way to go.
992;Best price I could find anywhere.
993;If you like Mel Brooks, you'll love this movie.
994;I laugh everytime I watch it.
995;This movie is a classic.
996;It took every sacred cow and idea of political correctness and burned it like a fine steak.
997;I know this movie is old, but I saw it my first time on cable channel and I enjoyed it a lot.
998;Even though it's a bit racy it's all in good fun and can be overlooked if you are not the serious type.
999;Funny from beginning to end.
1000;When it comes to making me laugh out loud Mel Brooks takes full honors!
1001;This movie is the classic of what is referred to today as politically incorrect , all throughout the movie.
1002;I bought this brand new and it came from a warehouse in my same state so I got it the very next day!
1003;It was for a b. day gift.
1004;It's a good old fun movie :)
1005;Safe for kids to watch!
1006;I ordered this one day and it arrived the next day!
1007;I got to surprise someone with it.
1008;Anything with Mel Brooks is funny in my book.
1009;I classic movie with some of the greatest comic and non comic actors of there time and one of the best ball players of all time who went into acting.
1010;Blazing Saddles , along with Young Frankenstein , is one of the greatest comedies of all time.
1011;"about ""Blazing Saddles"" is absolutely true."
1012;a mixed mercy, but I have it now in my library so that makes the B. s. experience worth revisiting, and in a time of strangling political correctness, I'm proud to say there is no single frame of video in the film that doesn't piss somebody off.
1013;The effort to leave no viewer unoffended is an historic success.
1014;this is a great movie from bank in the day .
1015;it is so funny as well .
1016;Great movie but had a crackle through the speakers while watching.
1017;Ultimately, I think Mel Brooks' 1974 film is one of the most important comedies ever made because it opened up the door for the entire range of comedies that have followed that eventually gets us to the Farrelly Brothers.
1018;, nor is it even the funniest Mel Brooks movie ever made (which is still The Producers, although Young Frankenstein is a close second).
1019;The one kindred spirit Bart finds in town is the Waco Kid (Gene Wilder), who is sobering up in the jail.
1020;Every one of those names should bring forth a favorite memory from the film.
1021;I've seen it many times, and still find it enjoyable, particularly the performances by Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn and the late, great Harvey Korman.
1022;Will watch it again, of course.
1023;, etc) almost steals the show and Alex Karras is wonderful as Mongo, especially considering it was his first real role in a movie.
1024;it is among my favorite 5 comedies of all time.
1025;Blazing Saddles continues to be my favorite Mel Brooks Film.
1026;Madeline Kahn is such an amazingly talented comedic actress.
1027;This is worth your time to watch.
1028;This is one of the funniest movies ever made.
1029;A big Thank you Mongo and Mel Brooks for all the laughs.
1030;This movie proved you can roll down the aisles with laughter.
1031;My kids are learning the wit and edginess of Mel Brooks via this classic!
1032;This is without a doubt one of the funniest movies to ever be recorded!
1033;Mell Brooks was able to do things that are forbidden in today's politically correct society.
1034;"Perhaps the most memorable scene was Brook's whorehouse character Lilly Von Schupp
I:8336;1035;This movie is a belly buster.
I:8336;1036;i finally found a place that you can get this movie unedited.
I:8336;1037;Blazing Saddles is one of my very favorite movies of all times.
I:8336;1038;Classic acting, classic charm, good clean America fun.
I:8336;1039;Truly is a classic in the film.
I:8336;1040;brow humor even your mom will appreciate, a movie that because of political correctness could never be made today the ultimate in Good Bad Taste.
I:8336;1041;Together they set about the task of winning over the folk of Rock Ridge (""""simple, wholesome, country folk ."""
1042;This blissfuly funny film is packed with hilarious episodes.
1043;The film is utterly delightful, with hilarious performances from all concerned.
1044;Cleavon Little is such a wonderful comic actor, not to mention being drop.
1045;dead gorgeous as well, why has so little been seen of him since this film was made?
1046;Never mind, if you're only going to be famous for one film, this is a great one to be remembered for.
1047;A family favorite that makes us all laugh until tears run down our faces.
1048;Risque, full of innuendo, and well ahead of its time for humor.
1049;One of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and good price at Amazon.
1050;Ordered as a gift for a grandson who wanted unedited version .
1051;An incredible satirical Western comedy film written and directed by Mel Brooks and full of excellent stars.
1052;after 40 years the same fun !!!
1053;I love Mel Brooks and his stylish humor.
1054;It is funny, some scenes are very funny.
1055;This is coming from a big parody fan.
1056;The funniest jokes involved Gene Wilder's character and his hilariously exaggerated reflexes, but there aren't many of them.
1057;In my opinion, they are all superior to Blazing Saddles.
1058;it was funny back then and still is funny today!I don't think I have seen a Mel Brooks movie that I didn't like.
1059;An irreverant comedy classic masterfully restored.
1060;Although raw humor in some parts, this is a classic of silliness.
1061;Everything Mel Brooks directed was excellent, but this one is the best of the best.
1062;The classic western comedy and still the best one.
1063;we have watched this movie many times and thought I would give as a gift.
1064;They should make more movies that make people laugh.
1065;Blazing Saddles has always been my favorite Mel Brooks films.
1066;And of course Harvey Korman and Madeline Kahn are priceless!
1067;This movie is a classic and cannot be watched on TV due to censorship and bleeping.
1068;Even if the N word is used it is still a very funny movie!
1069;No one can you laugh like Mel Brooks can.
1070;This movie will clear the blues away!
1071;BUT you must have a sense of humor!!!!
1072;I can vividly remember seeing Blazing Saddles at the cinema in Dublin in 1974.
1073;the entire audience was screaming helpless with laughter as bullwhip.
1074;eyed Cyclops Hedley hits on the genius idea of making the new sheriff a black man.
1075;playing that part with just the right amount of inner.
1076;breakingly funny Wild West set pieces and fabulous one.
1077;We'll ride into town and kill every first born child!
1078;And then theres Director and Co. writer Mel Brooks as the Governor who cant string two words together (has GOV on his jacket) and keeps lusting after his big.
1079;but best of all is the famous farting sequence where all the cowboys are sat around a campfire eating plates of beans .
1080;And on it goes like Airplane whomping you in the nuts with clever one.
1081;all of which lead up to a Randolph Scott joke and a very slapstick ending.
1082;youd have to say the picture is good rather than great.
1083;Its easily in the top 5 funniest films ever made still brilliantly anarchic snotty and fresh in a way that so many gross.
1084;do yourself a rootin tootin favour and get this fabulous piece of un.
1085;It's funny how politics creeps into everything.
1086;One of few movies I can watch over and over.
1087;silly and brilliant at the same time.
1088;find something new every time I watch it!
1089;One word describes this movie perfectly PATHETIC.
1090;This Mel Brooks Richard Pryor writing collaboration is a true classic.
1091;I thought the studio did a great job making this in blu ray.
1092;For a 30 year old film, it's looked very good.
1093;It's a classic Mel Brooks film, probably his best.
1094;I love this movie from Mel Brooks it's one of his best!Also this was one of the first blu.
1095;This is one of the greatest movies every made.
1096;Another great movie with the perfect cast!
1097;Every actor in this movie is a great comic genius!
1098;This movie is just utterly fantastic.
1099;It's hilarious from start to finish and has you laughing like a madman the entire time.
1100;About the movie: This is one of my all time favorites, and definitely one of the best.
1101;HOWEVER, these scenes are hilarious and I really miss them.
1102;well, since it has all these classic scenes in one place, that is all the more reason to have this disc in your collection.
1103;It's one if the best comedy's that I have ever seen.
1104;Mel brooks is great along with history if the world part one.
1105;Just a belly laugh movie
1106;It is actually my favorite comedy of all time.
1107;The ending is especially innovative and clever.
1108;this is a comedy classic, a take.
1109;This is a classic Mel Brooks film and the actor who plays the sheriff is seriously underrated.
1110;Moreover, when I first viewed Young Frankenstein without knowing that it was a Mel Brooks film, and having seen Ms. Kahn at the start of Young Frankenstein, I knew it was going to be a funny one.
1111;The campfire scene was absolutely hilarious and any made.
1112;The singing by Ms. Kahn was great, as well as her acting on the stage.
1113;This is a great movie but not meant for young ones, since it's a little racist.
1114;It still is sure to give anyone a good laugh.
1115;One of the funniest movies you'll ever see.
1116;Quite possibly Mel Brook's funniest movie.
1117;It should be in everyone library, the cast is chock full and it is hilariously funny.
1118;It is timeless on issues and will make you laugh
1119;Truly one of the best comedies put out by Mel Brooks.
1120;best scenes: Campfire scene Mongo slugging the horse.
1121;as for my review of the film, I think it's a very funny, though perhaps over.
1122;I've never enjoyed Mel Brooks as much as I felt I should, but he still produces some funny stuff (Young Frankenstein is my favorite).
1123;Blazing Saddles would have to be one of the most politically incorrect movies ever made.
1124;But that's ok, it's all in good fun.
1125;My favorite is and always will be Young Frankenstein, which is one of the funniest movies ever.
1126;mel Brooks parody of Westerns is still a success though.
1127;Featuring one of the funniest men ever, Gene Wilder, and having a hilarious cast, Blazing Saddles is sure to make you laugh, and have a fun time.
1128;This is one of the funniest looniest movies of all time and well worth watching again and again!
1129;This movie has a great story.
1130;line, great actors, and is hilarious!
1131;Sometimes it is just funny to laugh at life, because what else can you do!
1132;this is one of the funniest movies of all time, right behind Young Frankenstein.
1133;Mel Brooks is and will always be a comedy genius.
1134;What can I add to some of these great reviews.
1135;I'm just proud to share a portion of my name with this great funny man and artist.
1136;"And yes the ""N"" word is right there but I think that was one of the main points."
1137;This movie covers a lot of bases.
1138;of thought cascading into a waterfall of creative alternatives.
1139;"The success of ""Blazing Saddles"" is attributable in large part to the superb direction and writing (in conjunction with several other writers) of Mel Brooks, who (of course) also acted in the film in three separate roles: as Gov. William J. LePetomaine, an Indian chief and a World War I aviator."
1140;Equally important are the many very talented comedic actors who brought the film to life.
1141;The story continues to entertain as it builds to a climax that only the twisted comedic genius of Mel Brooks could devise.
1142;It is a hysterically funny film that I can highly recommend to everyone.
1143;it just made for good humor then.
1144;It's got so many anachronisms, it's hard to keep up with them and the climactic brouhaha at the movie studio makes little sense, but it's one damned funny movie and it still makes me laugh and laugh!
1145;Just sit back and enjoy a comedy that is funny and with great action.
1146;Made in 1974, this film was an honest stab at humor from a level that will likely never be embraced again.
1147;Difference is amusing, whether one admits it or not.
1148;It is however a hilarious movie.
1149;Mel Brooks is a comedic genius.
1150;I wanted one and I now have it
1151;Blazing Saddles is one of the great comedies of all time.
1152;As long as a film offends as few people as possible and appeals to as many members of the general public as possible (preferably between the ages of 18 and 35), the executives like it .
1153;Hollywood has lost a lot of daring and courage since 1974.
1154;See Blazing Saddles and you will realize just how much.
1155;Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles is probably the best movie I have ever seen.
1156;It is definetly the funniest.
1157;I love how the movie has many parts that would be out of place in 1874 (Gucci Saddlebags, limoseines, wide world of sports, and popcorn).
1158;Gene Wilder's story of how he became a drunk is absolutely hilarious.
1159;This is a must for any video collector.
1160;I just love this movie!
1161;This movie is politically incorrect, but it is an absolute classic.
1162;If you like to laugh this should do it.
1163;This is a great movie with very funny scenes that offers the best satire of bigotry I've seen.
1164;This is a classic Mel Brooks film.
1165;It is an all around great movie with a lot of scenes that are hilarious.
1166;I was a very late starter with this comedy classic masterpeice.
1167;But Blazing Saddles is one of my favorite Mel Brooks comedys that is very hard to beat in a comedy sense.
1168;It wasnt really funny anyway.
1169;i'd recomend you watch this if you like a good comedy.
1170;But who knows, you might just enjoy it.
1171;Mel Brooks is a genius.
1172;The greatest thing about this movie is that it is way before the days of political corretness.
1173;Funny, entertaining, have watched this movie many times and always enjoy it.
1174;i wanted this for a while now and made it a gift for myself.
1175;one of the funniest movies of all time
1176;Easily one of the best movies to date.
1177;As you watch it, the color brightness goes up and down.
1178;The movie tho is one of my most favorite spoofs of all time.
1179;Mel throws every cliche at us from all the Western and then someSlim Pickens is great love the toll booth scene a classic
1180;I loved this moving as a kid.
1181;this video is one of the great mel brooks video ever since the producers i laughed until i split my side a wonderful funny movie to see in this depressing times
1182;This is one of the best movies of ALL TIME.
1183;At one point this year, me and my brother.
1184;I have always loved this movie.
1185;Along with The Producers and Young Frankenstein, Mel Brooks has made three of the all time funny movies.
1186;I remember seeing this when in was first released and the audience in the cinema were in hysterics of laughter throughout and today it still is a hoot.
1187;great cast, crazy script(such as it is)and just a great vibe throughout combine to make a movie classic.
1188;Mel Brooks has tried many times to recreate the wackiness and great spoofery of Blazing Saddles and has never succeeded.
1189;what makes Blazing Saddles so good is that he went for it 100% and was inspired.
1190;And even after they make a movie about gay cowboys, this is still funny.
1191;And there is still no better way to show how small racial politics can make us than to shrink racism with laughter.
1192;Enjoyed it as much today as I did as a child.
1193;exemplory acting and great writing.
1194;and you have the gem that Blazing Saddles truly is.
1195;Harvey Korman is masterful as the dastardly Hedley Lamar, Slim Pickins is brilliant as his evil side.
1196;kick, Madeline Kahn shines in her 1st acting role .
1197;or Kahn singing I'm Tired ), this is a fine addition to any video collection.
1198;Mel Brooks at his best in a spoof of all the westerns ever made.
1199;Jam packed with famous stars and loaded with laughs fromstart to finish, this one will go down in comedy history.
1200;details, especially with dialogue, are important throughout the film.
1201;Acting and dialogue are well delivered.
1202;Now I get to introduce my sister to it!!!
1203;The sheer silliness and comic genius is hard to beat.
1204;One of Mel Brooks best movies.
1205;A very funny spoof of western genre.
1206;This flick could never be made today even since it makes fun of everything we cannot say today because of political correctness.
1207;Who doesn't love this silly schtick?A must have for everyone's comedy collectionMel Brooks is a comedy genius!
1208;The movie pokes fun at the white status quo, while the black sheriff, that the townspeople at first despised, gets the best of them.
1209;"As often as the dreaded ""N"" word is dropped, the people that actually use it are the ones that are proved to be ignorant."
1210;For me this movie is a breath of fresh air from a time when people weren't compelled to take themselves so seriously.
1211;Still great after all these years (although the racism isn't quite appropriate for these times) You must see again and laff your butt off.
1212;Their are a lot of talented actors and actresses in this movie.
1213;This is a great movie to watch with friends or any time you just want to laugh.
1214;Special edition of laughter and laughter.
1215;he is one of the greatest American comedians.
1216;we hope you make the 50 years special edition.
1217;this will be given as a gift.
1218;mel brooks, one of the most creative men of conedy.
1219;now my Grandbaby is loving it.
1220;she laughs till she cries.
1221;the oldies are the best always
1222;It is an Extremely funny movie every time.
1223;We still think this film is still hilarious, even after all these years.
1224;This is a classic movie!
1225;It was a steal for the price I paid.
1226;Very classic and funny, love Mel Brooks!
1227;Something to watch once a year.
1228;The film Blazing saddles is one of the best post counter.
1229;It is wonderfully surrealisic near the end with the western characters going to see a film called Blazing Saddles at the movie thater.
1230;My wife and I viewed it, and the laughs were few and far between.
1231;Overall, it was worth viewing to gain historical perspective, but we were reminded that a lot has changed in the movie industry and in American life since Blazing Saddles was introduced.
1232;It was hilarious and completely unpredictable, so much so that I went to see it again the next night!
1233;This movie helps us laugh at yourselves and others, with some of the best lines you will hear on the silver screen.
1234;Its a ride from the beginning to the end, and if you have a sense of humour.you will be exhausted from laughter when the ends!
1235;I have watched this movie so many times and its still funny.
1236;You woulndt be able to make a movie like this now.
1237;This movie is a true classic.
1238;If you think racial humor is funny then you'll love this movie.
1239;Funniest movie I have ever seen.
1240;I love this movie, classic Mel Brooks.
1241;Overall great movie, great extras and at a can't beat it price.
1242;A classic, one that I can watch over and over.
1243;Mel Brooks is brilliant, and his films are always entertaining, and have great messages.
1244;See it now and remember it forever more.
1245;Colors are rich, vibrant and startlingly three dimensional.
1246;The picture is remarkably solid with limited film grain and NO digital anomalies for a very smooth visual presentation.
1247;The audio has been cleaned up and remixed to 5.1 with a very nice .
1248;Warner Home Video has done a very, VERY nice job on this disc.
1249;It's a pleasure to have Mel Brook's insulting satire back where it belongs!
1250;Mel Brooks is a cinematic genius in his unforgiving and relentless jabs at whatever you think isn't politically correct.
1251;Mel Brooks has been generous to us for decades, enlightening us and imparting on us his view of this ridiculous world by means of humor.
1252;He's made the world a better place by showing it what a wonderful place it often isn't.
1253;It spits in racism's and racists' faces and makes them laugh while its doing it.
1254;Vignettes: DeLuise as a director is great and 'Dolf in the comissary is a howl (watch the back when the fighting's happening)
1255;Absolultely one of the funniest movies ever.
1256;Granted it is not polictically correct in any way, but it is a classic.
1257;One of Mel Brook's Greatest movies.
1258;Blazing Saddles is simply hilarious, but could never be released main.
1259;This movies starts out with a bit of subtle humor, which gets more and more absurd with each passing moment.
1260;I just love Dom Deluise's cammeo as a director at the end.
1261;Slim Pickens steals the show a a send up of himself.
1262;Great fragrance going to use it for stocking stuffers got it quick and it was really really reasonable Love it
1263;If you're a Mel Brooks fan you'll love this movie.
1264;Liked it when it first came out, liked each re.
1265;This movie is a classic!!!
1266;"There are so many good reviews of ""Blazing Saddles"", and so many articulate rebuttals of the PC."
1267;oriented one star reviews, that it's clear that there are a lot of you who would want to know about a little.
1268;known and equally hilarious European film.
1269;, Italian director Marco Ferrreri presents his take on the classic American Western, sympathizing with the Indians instead of the cowboys.
1270;"Westerns have always played loose with the facts, but this 1973 film ""is hilariously and deliberately erroneous"" (Time Magazine)."
1271;Recently shown in the United States for the first time, the film works on several levels.
1272;Last I looked, Blazing Saddles was still in the top 100 of all time, and well justified.
1273;It will do you good!
1274;You have to really understand Mel Brooks and his sense of humor to enjoy this one.
1275;This movie makes me laugh everytime I see it.
1276;It's the first movie I downloaded onto my Kindle.
1277;Firstly Mel Brooks has a gift for creating satire and this out does the Producers which was a riot.
1278;Nothing is sacred when Mel Brooks puts his hand to it a relief in our culture of superficial correctness.
1279;I still love the campfire scene, but there are just so many great parts to the movie!
1280;The Count Basie scenes are priceless now and many generations have been introduced to his wonderful music thanks to this movie.
1281;Blazing saddles is a excellent comedy.
1282;Always will reign as one of his crowning achievements .
1283;and a true tribute to the comic genius of Harvey Korman, Madeline Kahn and Cleavon Little.
1284;I can watch it over and over and still howl with laughter.
1285;An excellent addition to the movie collector who appreciates good humor.
1286;I think this one is Mel Brooks' best effort.
1287;Many have given excellent reviews of the movie, so I thought I would say a few words about the Blu.
1288;i would actually give this 4 1/2 stars if I could.
1289;ray will be based on the sharper, more detailed image.
1290;But when the movie goes outdoors, the scenery is razer sharp.
1291;ray disk is technically excellent.
1292;I laughed through the whole movie.
1293;It is Mel Brooks at his finest.
1294;If you are not offended easily this is a true classic.
1295;I love Mel Brooks, he is hilarious.
1296;Old movie, still a classic comedy.
1297;Highly recommend it, but only if you want to laugh
1298;Literally the funniest movie ever made.
1299;this should be required viewing for every person who loves cinema!
1300;Deep and relatable, Blazing Saddle represents all that is right in American Society.
1301;A perfect date night movie!
1302;Social, slapstick, farcical and phsyical humor is a blended into one of the greatest comedies of all time.
1303;The collaboration of Brooks Wilder is a recipe for success, as in Young Frankenstein.
1304;The best modern parallel I can think of is SHREK (Loaded with inside humor that the youngest kids don't get.)
1305;Possibly Mel Brooks' most famous, and most famously overrated film.
1306;"thirds of the movie is admittedly frequently hilarious, with the ""plot"" pretty much shoved to the side in favor of funny sight gags and characterizations."
1307;ray rocks why is it that it was more funnier back then lol, but still very funny
1308;This movie is always funny.
1309;I usually watch it when we go to our cabin in the summer at least once as pretty much a tradition now.
1310;One of my favorite Mel Brooks movies.
1311;Super funny (in your face you racist) comedy.
1312;Blazing Saddles,family favorite,just as funny today as was when it first came out and even better in blu.
1313;One of the best Mel Brooks movies of all time!
1314;pC elements of the film it also hysterically funny.
1315;You know you are going to have a good time when everyone in the film has the last name Johnson.
1316;And, so it goes, one laugh after another.
1317;It keeps us laughing except for a few long stretches.
1318;The film is a comedy Western.
1319;He wins them over much to the gi wigs surprise and hilarity ensues.
1320;Quotes by the dozen are part of the film.
1321;If you need a laugh, latch onto this film.
1322;mel brooks' film is outrageously funny.
1323;, yet it's a hilarious send up of westerns.
1324;This was a very funny spoof of the Western genre.
1325;A town full of rednecks gets a new sheriff who happens to be black.
1326;Gene Wilder also makes the film funnier as Jim, but most people call him.
1327;If you love Mel Brooks movies, you'll love BLAZING SADDLES!!!
1328;out movie with an absurd plot and much of the humor is at the high school level.
1329;first off i loved this movie when i was a kid and still do today,as far as the case it was pretty flimsy as most cases are today but what can you expect for 5.6 bucks.
1330;This movie, is the best, from when i was a little boy i watched this movie, 20 years later i still love it like the first time i saw it.
1331;It is an spoff that has to have the highest credit.
1332;This is one of Mel Brook's funniest movies, full of humor that will appeal to 12.
1333;The comic possibilities are endless, and Brooks explores virtually all of them.
1334;That might be part of the fun.
1335;It pokes fun at every one, so special interest groups easily offended by Indian, or China.
1336;"odd years later, Mel Brooks' ""Blazing Saddles"" still retains its impact, and its unapologetic political incorrectness."
1337;And the movie sure looks it.
1338;but the comedy still rules, especially when you have a campfire bean.
1339;And like YF, BS has so many outrageously funny moments that you need a score card.
1340;well, even the supporting players are terrific.
1341;fast paced and hilarious, you definitely can't go wrong with this comedy which shows Brooks at the top of his game!
1342;Probably the funniest movie of all time, Mel Brooks and Harvey Korman at their best.
1343;There are so many one liners in this movie and so many funny moments it is hard to pick just one.
1344;Just as funny today as when it came out for middle aged and up generations and older.
1345;Some of the humor is dated and may pass right by younger crowds, but there is still enough general humor that they will enjoy.
1346;A classic comedy that really leaves you laughing.
1347;quotable lines to keep a generation of movie fans nodding and smiling wistfully.
1348;"The film reminds you that Brooks set a lot of cinematic ""firsts""
I:8336;1349;Mel Brooks is a comedic genius.
I:8336;1350;but I saw it several decades ago and thought it was funnier at that time.
I:8336;1351;still a good laugh, though!
I:8336;1352;this is a funny movie about the early west.
I:8336;1353;It was funny, but corky.
I:8336;1354;The humor in this flick never changed a bit in all those years.
I:8336;1355;Open and real it just made a believer in fantasy out of you.
I:8336;1356;Blazing Saddles is a classic movie unbound by political correctness.
I:8336;1357;This is Mel Brooks at his finest.
I:8336;1358;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
I:8336;1359;This is one if the funniest political incorrect movie ever made.
I:8336;1360;Blue ray makes it even better
I:8336;1361;I love it and almost all people have a favorite line from this classic.
I:8336;1362;I especially enjoyed seeing the great Harvey Korman and the great Madelyn Kahn.
I:8336;1363;They had really good parts.
I:8336;1364;It is a treasure of the past that we should take a lesson from.
I:8336;1365;This movie gets better with every viewing.
I:8336;1366;classic mel brooks movie spoof from the 70s using some of the greatest comedians from that era love mongo comedy was still clean
I:8336;1367;Plus great price for it.
I:8336;1368;One of the all time classics!!!
I:8336;1369;This is Mel Brooks at his best.
I:8336;1370;On my top 10 list of favorite comedies!
I:8336;1371;this is hands down the best comedy ever made.
I:8336;1372;Its one of those movies thats always funny and has more quotable lines than any comedy ever.
I:8336;1373;its also great to finally see this in letterbox because if you were used to the version that was available all these years, you cant believe how much stuff was cut out of the screen.
I:8336;1374;Mel Brooks at his finest, not only as director but playing one of the leads.
I:8336;1375;Slapstick comedy meets the high plains.
I:8336;1376;Only Mel Brooks could get away with everything that is totally politically incorrect and i think the man is a truly a gifted artist.
I:8336;1377;what more can you say about this forever classic film.
I:8336;1378;Everyone has at least one memorized line that will always make them laugh.
I:8336;1379;It's really a great film and is just as funny if you have seen it one time or one hundred times.
I:8336;1380;Great job Mel Brooks, your a real showman.
I:8336;1381;If not, it means you have a good sense of humor.
I:8336;1382;This is a brilliantly funny/silly movie.
I:8336;1383;A great opportunity to laugh at everyone including yourself.
I:8336;1384;Blazing Saddles does this extremely well.
I:8336;1385;A broad comedy of nonstop gags will keep you laughing untill your sides hurt.
I:8336;1386;By far Mel Brook's best film.
I:8336;1387;This film is truly hilarious while holding the racists and anti.
I:8336;1388;semitics of our world up to the ridicule they so richly deserve.
I:8336;1389;the townsfolk now love their new sheriff but he has higher and loftier plans and with the Waco Kid by his side,they ride into the sunset Mel Brooks style.
I:8336;1390;This is, without a doubt, the funniest movie that I have ever seen.
I:8336;1391;This movie is a comedy classic!
I:8336;1392;I love how Mel Brooks makes an hysterical mockery of the Wild West.
I:8336;1393;His role as an equally corrupt and incompetent governor, under the sway of Harvey Korman's Attorney General is hilarious.
I:8336;1394;Many other great scenes are found throughout the movie.
I:8336;1395;A must for all fans of """"intelligent comedy."""""""
1396;groundbreaking for its time and still hilarious today.
1397;the images are crisp and clean, the songs as good as the first time they were sung, and the laughs just as hearty 40 years after it was first shown on the big screen.
1398;I laugh just as hard every time I watch it.
1399;Great cast, great script and great director.
1400;It's my favorite comedy of all time and I don't see that ever changing.
1401;Based strictly on the number of laughs that it generates, BLAZING SADDLES has to be considered one of the greatest comedies ever made.
1402;This magnificent parody of DESTRY RIDES AGAIN and of the classic western genre in general was not merely one of the great comedies of the seventies, but arguably the finest film of Mel Brooks career (along with YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN).
1403;Brooks later created and wrote with Buck Henry the great sixties spy comedy GET SMART!
1404;Brooks tries to generate laughs any way he can, engaging in sharp racial satire (such as when Slim Pickens tries to get the black railroad workers to sing some n*gger songs, and they respond by beautifully imitating the Mills Brothers)This is without question one of the most interesting films ever made dealing with race.
1405;the cast is just extraordinary.
1406;Harvey Korman's brand of humor was always a bit too broad for my taste, but he was just perfect in this one as That's Hedly!
1407;"Mel Brooks undertakes a number of smaller roles (in one of the church scenes you can spot his wife Anne Bancroft in the crowd if you look carefully
I:8336;1408;But this is a minor squabble with what is otherwise both one of the most hilarious and one of the most important comedies of the past half.
I:8336;1409;This movie is one of the all time great comedy movies.
I:8336;1410;If you have never seen this movie and can handle the politically incorrect humor, it is a must see and should be added to one's permanent collection of great movies.
I:8336;1411;It is an extremely funny off the wall Mel Brooks classic.
I:8336;1412;It is packed with famous actors who make the movie even funnier than ever.
I:8336;1413;it is still a very funny movie and I am glad I watched it again.
I:8336;1414;Still funny after 30 years or more.
I:8336;1415;If you grew up watching Hopalong Cassidy, Roy Rogers, Bonanza and Gunsmoke, Blazing Saddles was a wonderful parody.
I:8336;1416;got to be one of the best classics .
I:8336;1417;Amazon is great service to have and use.
I:8336;1418;It may not be politically correct any longer but it is still a very funny movie.
I:8336;1419;funny as hell, great to be able to find this movie in blu ray, looks great, sounds great im sure to be laughing for years to come!
I:8336;1420;the generation of when it was made thought it was hilarious, and the new generation, after getting over the fact it is an old movie will watch it and will think the same thing.
I:8336;1421;I would recommend this movie for any man that has a demented mind.
I:8336;1422;lots of laugh, weird, but yet enjoyable.
I:8336;1423;Blazing Saddles is an all time comedy classic.
I:8336;1424;It has earned a fantastic release on Blu.
I:8336;1425;It doesn't matter what you call it, it will be one of the funniest movies you have ever seen.
I:8336;1426;Wonderful cast and funny movie, Can be considered a classic for the times ,Mel Brooks is a comic genius.
I:8336;1427;It is funny and well made.
I:8336;1428;This is truly one of the funniest movies ever made!!!
I:8336;1429;A comedy this fun and politically incorrect will never go out of style.
I:8336;1430;Mel Brooks' comic direction in this is only second to """"Young Frankenstein""""."""
1431;The cast is excellent, down to the smallest part.
1432;Cleavon Little is one of the most likable heroes ever.
1433;Harvey Korman is always gets the biggest, smartest laugh.
1434;"Slim Pickens is the perfect ""Western"" stooge."
1435;And Gene Wilder is never not brilliant.
1436;Madeline Kahn is a comic goddess.
1437;This is important cinema as well as TIMELESS entertainment.
1438;Yet again, another great film by Mel brooks.
1439;This is one of my favorite comedies over the years.
1440;I feel it's up there with Animal House and Caddyshack.
1441;This movie pokes fun at anybody and everybody.
1442;what a wonderful way to lighten things up after a tough time.
1443;One of my all time favorites.
1444;This movie is classic Mel Brooks!
1445;Seen it several times and still laugh when I watch it.
1446;This is a great classic movie with Gene Wilder, It is so funny that you laugh so hard that it make your stomach hurt
1447;An excellent example of Mel Brooks and Richard Prior's Classic hilarity.
1448;racism is real, idiotic and worthy of ridicule!
1449;The GOV character perfectly details uselessness in power
1450;This classic comedy from Mel Brooks has stood the test of time .
1451;I have laughed almost continuously every time I have seen it.
1452;this is pretty much the same.
1453;Blazing Saddles is a great movie that I never tire of.
1454;It's one of those movies that I can watch over and over and still like.
1455;I also remember that the TV.
1456;Blazing Saddles is one of the best comedies with hilarious acting and constant laughs.
1457;This is probably the last time I'll ever watch this movie.
1458;Madeline Kahn is fabulous, and does the Marlene Dietrich schtick in her own inimitable style.
1459;"There are so many wonderful gags throughout the movie, and yes, the movie will offend many, but then, it is so difficult to keep up with the latest political correctness, and one must take into consideration, this movie was not racist in any way and was made long before we even had the term political correctness
I:8336;1460;It is Mel Brooks gone wild, with a great cast to egg him on, and you really have to pay attention or watch it more than once because you will be laughing so hard at so many tings you will miss the next line.
I:8336;1461;Little is VERY cool and wears beautiful buckskins and is debonair and urbane to the max.
I:8336;1462;Mel Brooks' at his best, with the likes of Gene Wilder and many other people that made this film funny to watch and you'll be glad you did.
I:8336;1463;Even after thirty years this is still a freakin hilarious movie.
I:8336;1464;While I thought it was hilarious at the time, I laugh even more when I watch it today!
I:8336;1465;It has some of the most memorable scenes and lines in movie history, and the performances by Gene Wilder, Cleavon Little and Harvey Korman are splendid.
I:8336;1466;The Mel Brooks commentary is interesting, but a special edition would be fantastic (especially if it's not in one of those terribly cheap snap cases).
I:8336;1467;A bit repulsive at times, but enjoyable.
I:8336;1468;Blazing Saddles will certainly go down in history as the best movie Mel Brooks ever did.
I:8336;1469;that's a laugh riot in and of itself.
I:8336;1470;granted this movie is almost forty years old,but it's still hilarious.
I:8336;1471;In terms of sheer laugh content, """"Blazing Saddles"""" survives as Brooks' finest hour ."""
1472;One of the funniest movies ever made.
1473;This is one of Mel Brooks best creations ever.
1474;A true funny classic that will never date itself.
1475;The jokes and actions are timeless and love watching this movie over and over.
1476;I laugh before the punchlines and have to force myself to remain quiet if I'm watching it with someone who has never seen it before.
1477;It is one of the best movies ever made.
1478;it makes fun of everyone and is a laugh a minute.
1479;I am happy that Mel Brooks had the insight to produce this comedy.
1480;This movie has always maked me laugh no matter how many times I watch it.
1481;It's so hard to find a truly funny movie anymore.
1482;there are racial slurs in this movie, but in this movie they are making fun of the way the white man sees other races.
1483;This tongue in cheek western comedy is hilarious!!
1484;Good CLEAN fun and not swearing!!
1485;Ol' Mel Brooks on the cover really sells it.
1486;One of Mel Brooks masterpieces, laughed through the entire movie at the theatre years ago when I first saw this movie and enjoy it as much each time I watch it now.
1487;My boys love them, too.
1488;Although I saw this film in a theater, when it was released, this version is terrific.
1489;The input on the making of of the film, by Mel Brooks himself, adds so much insight.
1490;He is truly one of the great comedic minds of our time.You can't possibly go wrong by purchasing this movie.
1491;all that said, Blazing Saddles is a worthwhile addition to your Blu library.
1492;"I thought it would be some kind of ""Great Comedy Masterpiece."""
1493;then one day I decided to watch it in as laid back a mood as possible .
1494;what I'm trying to say is if you're in a relaxed sort of mood, this movie will give you a lot of laughs.
1495;minute audio commentary by Mel Brooks, in which he pretty much describes the entire production.
1496;It's a bit scratchy, but sharp.
1497;You'll love this movie more than a box of paddle.
1498;Mel Brooks' finest piece of satire.
1499;It is a comedy classic
1500;You can watch this movie a dozen times and still see something you missed, still laugh like a maniac at the famous scenes, and hear classic lines quoted in daily life.
1501;As usual Amazon got me what I ordered when they said they would and it was exactly what i asked for.
1502;Received it in a timely matter and love love love this movie and recommend it to everyone.
1503;i hope he enjoys it!
1504;I still remember going to see this movie on a first date.
1505;This is the best comedy ever made and I don't think any movie will ever come close.
1506;second only to Frankenstein, which is also terrific.
1507;this movie is where I discovered and became a huge fan of Madeline Kahn.
1508;"Harvey Korman is also very funny here
I:8336;1509;if you like wacky comedies you'll probably enjoy this film.
I:8336;1510;one of the funniest movies ever.
I:8336;1511;Just relax and enjoy because this movie couldn't be made today!
I:8336;1512;At the time, it was shocking (in an unexpected sense) and hilarious.
I:8336;1513;This scene is but the tip of the iceberg for the movie and the comic genius of Mel Brooks.
I:8336;1514;This movie is a classic and has something for everyone.
I:8336;1515;brainer, but the actors are great and it's guaranteed to keep you laughing all the way.
I:8336;1516;You couldn't make this movie today, but the humor is just as funny now as it was when it was produced.
I:8336;1517;everyone is made fun of in this film, including the filmmakers.
I:8336;1518;This film is still """"fresh"""" after three decades since its creation."""
1519;Mel Brooks realized that it was important to enlist the writing talents of one of the most brilliantly funny great black comics of all time .
1520;"Humor is what people need to get along and this film delivers it ""in Spades!"""
1521;"The extremely funny use of Slim Pickens (the great charaacter actor also used brilliantly in the Peter Sellers' ""dark comedy"" cult classic Dr Strangelove) in this and also in the WW II spoof ""1941"" were master strokes of creative comic genius."
1522;"All four of those films are ""must sees/haves"" for comedy film fans."
1523;Never get away with this type of comedy in today's sensitive world!
1524;Mel Brooks uses comedy to show the ignorance of people!
1525;Blazing saddles is without doubt (along with 'Young Frankenstein') one of the two funniest movies I've ever watched.
1526;even vulgar, but overall, I really enjoy the movie.
1527;This was a hilarious send up of old westerns.
1528;Every moment of this film was a hoot!
1529;Almost every scene is a classic.
1530;The Camptown Ladies scene and the finale are a riot.
1531;You will love this classic.
1532;If you ever need a movie to make you smile, this is the one.
1533;humor is close to South Park.
1534;My favorite Mel Brooks movie: This is a must in your comedy collection.
1535;It's fun to see the humor back in the 70's on race and what would offend people today.
1536;So well done with great, memorable one liners!
1537;One of many classic Mel Brook's films.
1538;Great to have this gem in my home collection.
1539;This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.
1540;It is a good and funny movie.
1541;He was excited and I recommend this movie to others.
1542;Witty, clever and a political reflection of the times in which it was made.
1543;This is another great Mel Brooks movie!
1544;This movie is one of the most entertaining films ever made.
1545;Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder are wonderful together, and Madeleine Kahn was hilarious.
1546;Love the one liners and the play on words.
1547;The more you watch it the better it gets.
1548;Wish we had more smart, fun movies like this.
1549;"This film was such a success that it spawned a pilot entitled ""Black Bart"" which is on here."
1550;besides the extras and features, it's a first rate comedy and genius in it's delivery.
1551;Cleavon Little is perfect as Black Bart.
1552;In the special feature, we learn that Richard Pryor was Mel Brooks's first choice.
1553;It was a great comedic film if you don't mind the lack of political correctness.
1554;"if you love to laugh at life, Hollywood, and the westerns, you'll love Blazing Saddles which could easily be turned into a Broadway musical after ""The Producers"" and ""Young Frankenstein"" were onstage."
1555;One of the all time comedy westerns of our time.
1556;You have got to see and own this classic movie cause if you don't your going to regret it.
1557;Mel Brooks thank you so much for this one of a kind.
1558;A classic Mel Brook's movie.
1559;One of Mel Brooks best movies ever.
1560;Well, now I am happy.
1561;i believe that everything said about this movie has been said, so now I am taking up space to say 1,000 words.
1562;Oh, MAX of 1,000 words, I thought that was the MIN.
1563;This is Mel Brooks' humor at it's best.
1564;Great casting of Clevon Little, Gene Wilder, Madeline Khan and Harvey Korman.
1565;I love all Mel Brooks productions but Blazing Saddles, together with History of the World (which should be on Amazon Prime, but is not, SHAME) are by far my most favorite ones.
1566;I love every single character but Cleavon Little wins my heart every time.
1567;BUT for those of us with the type of sophisicated humor found in this movie, it remains as funny as it was all those years ago.
1568;Didn't get a lot of it then but thought it funny now i find it hilarious.
1569;Will keep watching it over and over.
1570;if you appreciate a movie that really makes you laugh than Blazing saddles is the movie for you.
1571;yeah, it's sposed to be some sorta funny western.
1572;but I was hooked on Mel Brook's films forever.
1573;This is the standard to which all 'funny westerns' must be held.
1574;The movie uncensored was fantastic, acting was great, the gags funny and corny.
1575;Five stars for the movie itself as well as the presentation.
1576;The movie looks and sounds great.
1577;This is easily one of the most influential comedies of all.
1578;It's nice to have them, though most of them are shown in the Back in the Saddle featurette.
1579;minute show is a real curiousity, a great archival piece even though the show itself is excruciatingly BAD.
1580;Still, its interesting viewing, and very easy on the eyes.
1581;This show, quite simply, looks amazing!
1582;I always enjoyed Mel Brook's comedy, but in this movie he outdid himself.
1583;I've seen a few Mel Brooks movies, so I'm a bit familiar with his style.
1584;It's always silly, but in a way that works.
1585;I just got it yesterday and watched it already and I am VERY impressed by the picture and sound!
1586;I didn't see any scratchiness or white blips or anything on the picture and the sound was also very good.
1587;I had never seen it before and thought it was mildly funny.
1588;It has a few laugh out loud moments, and I recognized a lot of comedy routines and phrases in this one that I've also heard in newer movies, so I'm guessing this is where they got their material from.
1589;and that's what I love about it.
1590;Nothing funny about humorous stereotypes?
1591;I think you will enjoy Eat Pray Love , go get that movie instead.
1592;the rest of us that still have a sense of humor and can handle some adult language and potty humor, this might be the greatest movie ever made.
1593;Blazing Saddles is a classic American film on the many levels.
1594;A new sheriff comes to town with intent to help a community the local government is trying to destroy in a attempt to expand the railroad.
1595;This is actually a funny and very smart critique on the American perception of history and how it is presented by Hollywood.
1596;If you saw it a while ago and all you can remember are the jokes you should view it again.
1597;You will certainly rediscover some of the magic that has kept this film relevant in the social stratosphere for so long.
1598;This is an absolute classic comedy movie.
1599;My dad's favorite movie and one of mine.
1600;This movie is pure lunacy.
1601;This movie is pure roll on the floor funny.
1602;Bart wins over the people and helps them defend their town.
1603;The scene where they are sitting around a campfire eating beans and passing gas is a pure riot.
1604;Like all of his movies, Mel Brooks throws good taste out of the window.
1605;Some of the greatest comedians working with one of the Twentieth Centuries greatest directors.
1606;There is something quite subversive about this film that he never quite managed before or since.
1607;in fact the casting is so right that this is one of the most faultless spoofs ever made!!!!!!
1608;All time great from Mel Brooks.
1609;I fully recommend this movie to any adult with a good sense of humor.
1610;This movie is a classic for any Mel Brooks fan.
1611;Recommend this to anybody who likes smart and thoughtful comedy.
1612;"Yes, it's a comedy
I:8336;1613;But this is undoubtedly a great classic American film.
I:8336;1614;just a great classic movie!
I:8336;1615;Mel Brookes is the greatest.
I:8336;1616;politically incorrect and loving it, """"Blazing Saddles"""" holds up as a comedy nearly 30 years after its release, and maybe even has gotten funnier as Americans get more uptight."""
1617;"and while the bathroom humor (and the campfire scene) gets all the notice, there are some very subtle jokes in the film, such as the ""laurel and hardy handshake"" and ""Thank you, Van."
1618;specific, but it's worth listening to.
1619;specific commentary by Brooks and co. writers Andrew Bergman and Richard Pryor.
1620;simply put this is one of the greatest comedies ever produced.
1621;This Mel Brooks spoof of westerns is one of the funniest movies beginning to end I've ever seen.
1622;i've always felt this was Mel Brooks' best film.
1623;This is my favorite movie of all time so likely my review will be slanted toward the positive.
1624;It's surprising to see such a movie do so well but this likely is because of Mel Brook's ability to tastily make fun of everyone without pushing the bar too far in any direction.
1625;Definitely a gem in my collection.
1626;This is such a great flik.
1627;The tone of the film is so hilarious in and of itself I even loved this film when I was a little kid and certainly didn't get all the jokes.
1628;The humor is ribald but with such an upbeat, happy tone nothing comes off as crass or crude, it's just funny.
1629;It's such a comedy's comedy .
1630;The jokes, the timing, the acting, it's just so well done and wall.
1631;The movie poked fun at all our stereotypes and should make us laugh.
1632;I had such high hopes for this film.
1633;It came out the same year as YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, which is one of the best comedies ever, and Mel Brooks' best movie.
1634;BLAZING SADDLES has a good cast, lots of funny people, and people who work well with Brooks, like Gene Wilder and Madeline Khan.
1635;One of the most embarrassing movies I've ever seen.
1636;A movie in its own class!
1637;Some of the lines stick with you forever.
1638;This movie speaks for itself!
1639;So many scenes to choose from because the movie is a classic.
1640;Movies like Robin Hood: Men In Tights are great examples of this.
1641;I personally prefer the Zucker brothers' stuff (Airplane!)
1642;Perfect over the top comedy, TONS of classic moments and quotable lines, completely non.
1643;pC storyline and dialogue, this is one of the greatest comedies EVER.
1644;Any fan of Monty Python zaniness will appreciate the genius of Blazing Saddles.
1645;of course, a large part of Blazing Saddles' success has to do with the EXCELLENT screenplay, and a large portion of that must be credited to Richard Pryor (who was going to play the lead character, the role that went to Cleavon Little).
1646;Pryor's sharp dialogue is very evident here, and mixed with Mel's slapstick, the writing here is top.
1647;cheek, over the top performances, and the movie is all the better for it.
1648;LaMarr to perfection, while Cleavon Little is fantastic as our hero, the sheriff.
1649;Rounding out the characters are the always understated yet excellent Gene Wilder, Madelaine Khan sporting an outrageous accent, and Mel Brooks himself as 'The Guv'.
1650;One of the very best things about Blazing Saddles is that it can never be duplicated.
1651;If you are offended by Blazzing Saddles, Mongo is smarter than you are.
1652;As one of the greatest comedies of all time, it stands head and shoulders above the AWFUL 'comedies' that Hollywood turns out these days.
1653;the movie is great, fun to watch even it's as old as it is.
1654;This Movie is so Not Funny!
1655;I sat down and watched this flick with some friends who loved it and i have to say what a waiste of my time.
1656;I know a lot of rebiews were good about this movie, maybe good to the older crowd who are in there 40's and 50's but for the hip young generation and sophisticated one like mine in the teens and twenties this movie is pure crap.
1657;Nothing good about it at all.
1658;I love it and, thought i have seen it 15 times (probably) I still laugh every time as though it was new stuff.
1659;Madeline Kahn and Harvey Korman are stellar!
1660;Movie arried very quickly and was in great condition.
1661;Hilarious and worth a watch for sure.
1662;This is the film that made Mel Brooks famous.
1663;Still, this film is legend.
1664;Thank you Mel for one of the best laughs I've ever had!
1665;Mel Brooks has made some of the best comedy movies in the history of cinema and I think Blazing Saddles is his best.
1666;Definitely my favorite Mel Brooks movie!
1667;And then there is the rest of a great cast.
1668;And we all know that it's brilliant.
1669;She said it was a guy movie.
1670;So, I recomend this movie to every guy out there who likes a funny movie.
1671;I love this movie, Such a great movie , so happy to finally own it on blu.
1672;This is a very good Mel Brooks movie and I would rate it just under Young Frankenstein, with 4 1\2 stars!
1673;I just love this movie and most of the guys I know my age can quote the best lines.
1674;take it for what it worth which is one excellent comedy and a movie meant to smile about.
1675;I love how they break character in the end and they are on the studio set!
1676;If you can get over that, this is a very funny movie.
1677;Harvey Korman is hilarious and every time Slim Pickens talks it just cracks me up.
1678;This is a great movie with great actors.
1679;This movie is great and has always been great.
1680;It's a classic need I say more.
1681;It might be offensive to some, but it's a great old comedy
1682;I found this movie rather humorous and very funny.
1683;This is, without a doubt, one of the funniest movies ever made.
1684;The acting is terrific, the blue ray audio and video is terrific, and to watch it is an instant way to lift any depressed feelings you may have.
1685;The poster is kind of misleading.
1686;I can't remember even one funny moment in this movie.
1687;Mel brooks is a great comedic director who has a sarcastic edge in all his work.
1688;I was tearing up with laughter and I thought my dad was going to pass out with his laughter.
1689;The uncensored version leave you laughing, and laughing, and laughing.
1690;Heck, I saw it when it first came out and I have watched my VHS copy over the years and I still enjoy it.
1691;All I wanted was a good copy of the original movie, and that's what I got.
1692;I watch this movie about once a year.
1693;It is just a fun flick.
1694;The BEST movie ever made!
1695;How refreshing it is to see everyone laugh at themselves without looking for an opportunity to be offended.
1696;Check your political correctness at the door and come see how funny we all look when we think we're better than others.
1697;In reality, it's Mel's hour interview from the previous set), there's the great Back in the Saddle documentary which discusses the original making of the film with writer Andrew Bergman, Brooks, star Wilder and others.
1698;It's nice to finally have this available.
1699;We also get the theatrical trailer which given the time the film was made is actually pretty good.
1700;There's also an excerpt from the Biography program on Madeline Kahn.
1701;I'd much prefer to have a two disc edition with the full length biography as well as any other bits and pieces on the wayside but, well, this is what we have.
1702;the remastered sound and picture looks very good and improves on the previous edition (which, admittedly, looked pretty good).
1703;There are some minor analog imperfections visible but, on the whole, the print looks very good.
1704;Blazing Saddles looks good and has some tasty extras.
1705;The movie deserves 5 stars.
1706;Seen this movie many, many times .
1707;showing its age, but still fun and in many way socially relevant.
1708;And although the plot is mainly pointless, it works well for the movie.
1709;It's the spoofs and gags that do that.
1710;I particularly loved the part where the men come to a pay.
1711;in conclusion, you must have a sense of humor to enjoy Blazing Saddles .
1712;"And I do recommend this movie
I:8336;1713;For anyone who still doesn't know, yes, this hilarious Mel Brooks spoof of the Old West features the famous campfire scene where a group of grizzled cowboys suffers the aftermath of eating huge plates of baked beans.
I:8336;1714;theft device secured to its face.
I:8336;1715;camp, so to speak, to the task of finding a new sheriff.
I:8336;1716;The aide (played brilliantly by the wonderful Harvey Korman)finds a sheriff, alright.
I:8336;1717;if you are one of the few on the planet who has not seen this priceless film, you are in for a very wild ride!
I:8336;1718;To own it is to love it, and in my view, everybody should own at least one version of this hilarious classic.
I:8336;1719;I have enjoyed all of Mel Brooks' movies, this one being in my top 5.
I:8336;1720;Cleavon Little (may he rest in peace) is an amazing actor.
I:8336;1721;funny Gene Wilder, and how can we forget Slim Pickens, among the other well.
I:8336;1722;known actors/actresses including the genius himself, Mel Brooks as the Governor.
I:8336;1723;stick humor from an all.
I:8336;1724;star comedy class is awesome.
I:8336;1725;laughter is the best anti.
I:8336;1726;It is still as funny as ever.
I:8336;1727;So many classic lines in this movie.
I:8336;1728;Specifically, her rendering of """"I'm Tired"""", a perfect send."""
1729;is it a true classic?
1730;But it is funny, mostly because of its blunt treatment of racism.
1731;"In this regard, it's a much more honest film than ""Crash""."
1732;the cinematography by Joseph Biroc does little to enhance his excellent reputation.
1733;The night scenes, though, are richly colored and jsut plain beautiful.
1734;amazon's attractive price makes the BD a must.
1735;have, if only to see Madeline Kahn in a classic performance.
1736;This is one of the funniest movies ever released.
1737;I remember seeing this film as a young adult but it wasn't until several years later that I truly appreciated its humor.
1738;Ease up, relax and laugh a little.
1739;please rate this review if you found it helpful.
1740;A lot has been said about the additional scenes.
1741;blazing saddles is a great slapstick movie that can be enjoyed over and over again.
1742;movie recommended to any who like this genre.
1743;"The Mel Brooks choreography is wonderful when Lili Von Schtup sings ""I'm Tired."""
1744;This movie is filled frame to frame with humor, and no one gets away not insulted (Okay, we'll take the Irish too!)
1745;The cast was perfection, either just over the top, or way over the top Harvey Korman is hilarious as the nefarious Hedley Lamarr.
1746;Cleavon Little is fantastic as he makes fun of his own stereotypes, it is absolutely one of the funniest movies ever made by humans on the planet earth.
1747;This is a classic from the 70's.
1748;Mel Brooks is a genius.
1749;This movie is the mother of all comedy movies today.
1750;This is worth a watch.
1751;a lot better than the TV version though.
1752;best movie ever, the only movie that my two brothers and I agree upon as the best movie ever yay!
1753;Also, it is iconic for its time.
