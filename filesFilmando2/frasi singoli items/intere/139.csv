1;This is probably one of my top 10 movies that I've ever seen.
2;"Frank Sinatra is wonderful in it
3;The movie totally changed the book and made it wonderful.
4;This is a classic, and will be for the rest of time.
5;This is probably my favorite movie of all time.
6;James Jones followed this novel up with The Thin Red Line , but this was his very best work.
7;Fred Zimmerman's direction was extremely brilliant.
8;Good job in the movie.
9;There is no better movie than this one.
10;Undoubtedly considered a classic, this movie won 8 Oscars in 1953, including best film.
11;Prewitt makes friends with Maggio, another private, but is constantly ridden by the other boxers in the company who are all sergeants because they box and want him to help their team win a tournament.
12;But, that is kind of a minor point.
13;I did like the fact that the 'good guys', Maggio and Prewitt, both end up dying and the love affairs don't work out.
14;It is an interesting twist to a love story that makes the story more believable because it isn't a fairy tale.
15;Some of the acting was forced, but overall it was pretty good.
16;Montgomery Clift was particularly good in his role.
17;If you enjoy classic films, you would probably enjoy this one.
18;Sgt. Warden is advised to have some fun by his captain, and this leads to an adventure.
19;On payday the soldiers engage in gambling"
20;There is a private club with hostesses who dance with gentlemen.
21;A new Captain Ross makes changes.
22;There is a surprise and things change.
23;This is a good story but it was simplified from the novel.
24;If a person ever tells you a sad story to gain your sympathy it is very likely to be a confidence trick.
25;winner of 8 academy awards, directed by a hollywood legend (Fred Zinneman), an unrivaled ensemble of actors and a film climax depicting one of this country's most turbulent and horrifying historical events (the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese), are just a few of the factors that make this one of the greatest classics of motion picture history.
26;the best extra is the Zinneman interview.
27;the making of documentary is actually a hyped trailer for the film.
28;The Hollywood box office has thrived on such epic since from about day one.
29;fashion peace before the world, and the American imperium above all, put us all on edge with the permanent war.
30;deserved classic film of the genre, From Here To Eternity.
31;flecked Hawaiian beach above all.
32;"And all to the tune of the bluesy ""Reenlistment Blues"" as background music."
33;If you want to see every day dog soldiers at work and play circa 1940 this is your cinematic stop.
34;Frank Sinatra as a feisty little soldier always getting in trouble, Montgomery Clift at his most beautiful, Burt Lancaster full of energy, Deborah Kerr quietly elegant and also sexy.
35;I have seen this movie at least 5 times over many years and it always entertains and educates me.
36;and helps me realize what great acting really is.
37;I just love this movie!
38;A great cast of actors with Montgomery Clift, Frank Sinatra, Burt Lancaster and Donna Reed.
39;brave soldiers played by Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift .
40;The film has somehow got dated with time, but it still is carried on broad shoulders of Burt Lancaster, whose steaming beach encounter with Deborah Kerr (wife of his superior) remains among the most memorable love scenes ever put on the screen.
41;The talented boxer and bugle.
42;The role of his friend Maggio brought a Best Supporting Oscar to Frank Sinatra, who allegedly got the role thanks to his underworld connections.
43;"Donna Reed (It's A Wonderful Life) won her Oscar for supporting actress as Prewitt's flame Alma, a luxurious prostitute whose only dream is to return home with the money and live a ""decent"" life."
44;The film also got six more Academy Awards (total eight of 13 noms), including Best Picture and Best Director for Fred Zinnemann (High Noon, A Man for All Seasons).
45;The famous scene where Burt Lancaster and Donna Reed embrace themselves on the beach with the waves engulfing upon them is a memorable one.
46;It's among the fewest greatest scenes of all films that will forever stand the test of time.
47;Included are the wonderful performances by Montgomery Clift, Frank Sinatra, and Donna Reed.
48;My opinion of Sinatra's performance has been greatly improved now.
49;He is pretty good as the affable Maggio with remarkable acting skills.
50;What I love is the ominous placement of the pullout of day.
51;At least, my rating of the film is improved from `6' to `9'.
52;All in all, From Here to Eternity has great acting performances and, more importantly, the famous beach scene that will forever remain timeless.
53;This is one of the Greatest films ever made with a brilliant cast headed by a Brilliant Director Fred Zinneman!!
54;The picture is outstanding and sound clean and mono!!!
55;One of them was this book, and I read it because I read just about everything.
56;She's the one in the famous scene about rolling around on the beach at Pearl Harbor shortly before it was bombed.
57;Frank Sinatra is Pvt. Angelo Maggio, Prewitt's best buddy.
58;"donna Reed is Alma ""Lorene"" Burke, who works at a club that in this day and age would be understood to be a whorehouse, but which avoids the suggestion pretty successfully in this film."
59;She dances with the soldiers, talks with them, flirts with them and the club somehow makes money.
60;saw this movie 60 yrs ago it was great then and still is what else can I say great movie
61;From here to eternity is one of my big favorite movies.
62;I bought this great movie for a friend who was turning 60, as it came out the year of her birth.
63;It arrived quickly, and was in perfect condition.
64;Finally found the classic movie.
65;as for the rest of the film well it is believable enough.
66;I love Donna Reed especially in this movie.
67;Her dance hall girl character is sexy and appealing.
68;Very believable in the way it is handled.
69;Lancaster is brilliant to watch as always.
70;This was one of Hollywood's best films.
71;It is still on of the classics of the Golden Years.
72;This classic love storey with a military setting was great.
73;The other actors (Montgomery Clift) and actresses also played a big part in this unforgetable movie.
74;The only thing I would change is the ending to make it happy instead of sad.
75;It took me a long time before I really liked this movie.
76;My wife always loved it, but I did not.
77;You will love this movie and go back and revisit again and again.
78;Although not great in my opinion, it is still a must have and must see for all movie buffs.
79;Love scene in surf with Lancaster and Kerr is amazingly erotic and they never take off their clothes!
80;This movie established Frank Sinatra as a solid actor.
81;Burt Lancaster as always turns in a great performance, Ernest Borgnine is a great bully, Montgomery Clift, Deborah Kerr and Donna Reed all provide great performances.
82;It won the award for best picture and deserved it.
83;Great movie and even better in Blu ray.
84;A study of characters, the Army, the time and the place.
85;In other words, if you are wanting a good drama, you will be satisfied, though saddened.
86;But the story is the star, and the major player's blend the subtle nuances into pure magic.
87;From the very first time I saw this movie, as a child, the most poignant moment, the one that still brings tears to my eyes, is when Pruitt plays Taps after Maggio dies.
88;That rendition stays with you long after the movies over.
89;this was Sinatra's first big dramatic part and it showed.
90;Hollywood, anxious to restore Sinatra to box office dynamite rewarded him with an Oscar for his deer.
91;"John Wayne was much more believable in ""The Quiet Man""."
92;ernest Borgnine turned in a fine performance as the sadistic Stockade guard.
93;If you like good acting, it is worth the price for the performances of Lancaster and Kerr.
94;Just like any movie, it's entertaining.
95;The story is good, but it's just not that hard.
96;The movie illustrates that well.
97;story and actually has some good action in it too.
98;It's a film that is much more frank than most films of its era in its depictions of male camaraderie as well as romantic entanglements.
99;It's the film that featured the Oscar winning dramatic performance of Frank Sinatra and it's the film that concluded with a dramatic recreation of the bombing of Peal Harbor, December 7th.
100;all however the film works beautifully and remains a powerful and memorable film very much worth seeing.
101;It's also a very mature and adult film that features some still quite torrid romances involving an Army officer and a married woman.
102;The Army however is Pruitt's home and he loves it.
103;Burt Lancaster delivers an almost understated performance as Sergeant Warden.
104;He is also involved in a passionate and very dangerous affair with Captain Holmes' wife, Karen who is well played by Deborah Kerr.
105;This remains the most interesting story and one can imagine how controversial and shockingly adult it played to audiences in 1953, because it still holds up even today.You won't confuse From Here to Eternity with a film that was made in the last 20 years, but it's a powerful and surprisingly adult film very much worth seeing.
106;It's also an Oscar winning film that won't make you scratch your head trying to figure out why it won its Oscars.
107;From Here To Eternity is presented in the original 1.37:1 full frame aspect ratio.
108;all a decent but not spectacular audio for a film nearly 50 years old.
109;abundance of extras as the hype might lead you to expect, but there are several worthwhile extras and they are greatly appreciated and will be enjoyed by film buffs.
110;the Making of From Here to Eternity is an interesting two minute puff piece that was produced to further publicize the film in 1953.
111;cOMMENT ON THE COMMENTARY TRACK:The feature length audio commentary is done by the director's son, Tim Zinnemann and one of the film's co. stars Alvin Sargent.
112;christopher Jarmick, is the author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F. Holder a critically acclaimed, steamy suspense thriller.
113;the love scenes were powerful and nobody was buck naked.
114;and all around well done movie.
115;This is a wonderful movie.
116;I have always enjoyed movies set around WWII and this fit the bill.
117;The choice of actors was amazing.
118;No matter how many times I see it, the beach scene is still the best.
119;This is a wonderful movie about love, passion and proving your manhood in the military against all odds.
120;there are many tectures in this movie and it includes great love scenes with Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr.
121;All the characters are so well drawn and the movie is pretty faithful to the book.
122;montgomery Clift (who the producers didn't want but the director stubbornly fought for) is the real star here, giving a wonderfully layered performance as a former boxer who will not join the service team, under any circumstances.
123;He takes it with quiet grace and confidence, sure that he can take anything other than getting back into the ring.
124;Clift's best friend Maggio (Frank Sinatra) is always taking up for him and definitely pays the price later on.
125;Sinatra is wonderful in this Oscar.
126;the romantic angle that matters here is the one between Clift and Donna Reed (who also won an Oscar) as a dance hall girl (yes, that Donna Reed!)
127;Theirs is a truly sweet love, more so because they are both so damaged and vulnerable.
128;"This is really an excellent film
129;I would definitely recommend it if you are a film fan in general or a fan of WWII films in particular.
130;It envisions and shows the things that makes America what it is, and has always been, a great nation that does not give up when tested thru the fire, like in World War II.
131;It is good to go down to the memory lane of filmaking, and remeber the patriots that made this nation what it is today"
132;Frank Sinatra truly deserved the Academy Award he received as the hilarious yet tragic soldier, Maggio.
133;Donna Reed received an Academy Award, too, for her fabulous portrayal as a dance hall girl who wishes to lead a proper life back home in Oregon when she has saved a large bag of money.
134;"Ernest Borgnine is excellent as the vicious James ""Fatso"" Judson, the army stockade leader."
135;"A ""great"" movie about depravity, stubbornness, and lost opportunities."
136;line and acting were superb!
137;A powerful story of the military on Oahu in the days leading up to the attack at Pearl Harbor.
138;A stellar cast give great performances.
139;Conditions are status quo until Private Robert E. Lee Pruitt, played by Montgomery Clift, arrives from the bugler corps.
140;Other marvelous features are the supporting cast providing terrific characters around the main actors, and the production's location at the historic Schofield Barracks on Oahu.
141;It's easy to see why this was Best Picture in 1953.
142;Here, it's Sgt. Warden, tall and handsome, a hardened soldier on the outside to protect his innermost sensitivity.
143;It's a human story of love, honor, humor, and hope.
144;life drama will appreciate this well.
145;loved the Hawaiian shirts, did not know they wore them back then, have a few myself!
146;"recommend for Sinatra's olive dice game and two pretty lei's 
147;My husband loves movies about World War Two and he really enjoyed this one.
148;Great actors and great acting.
149;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
150;Now that is a great cast.
151;I enjoyed this movie but it doesn't live up to it's legendary status.
152;Great performances by DEborah Kerr and Donna Reed.
153;They are all good movies and received in great condition.
154;They make a good additions to my collection.
155;Thank you for very good service.
156;Then there's the wholesome, well.
157;scrubbed Donna Reed as a wholesome, well.
158;offbeat casting enhances the movie immeasurably.
159;The other is First Sergeant Milton Warden, a take.
160;life in the barracks is fraught with adversarial personalities, chief among them Private Angelo Maggio, Prewitt's loudmouthed best friend, and Staff Sergeant """"Fatso"""" Judson, the sadistic stockade warden."""
161;Burt Lancaster is well cast as Warden, and he brings surprising nuance to his character's clandestine encounters with Karen.
162;"set footage and interviews from a documentary entitled ""Fred Zinnemann: As I See It"", and the original theatrical trailer."
163;All though there are important elements of romance in the book, there are more important messages about humanity.
164;This film gets it right.
165;It makes the film very real.
166;There are also a couple subplots in this movie involving actors Frank Sinatra and Donna Reed.
167;the writing in this film is just great.
168;I love this classic film.
169;This film, taken from the James Jones novel, not only tells an interesting story about some not so everyday lives prior to the attack, but its effect on those lives, during and after.
170;All the actors are great.
171;I greatly admire Montgomery Clift, and he is wonderful here.
172;Yes, this was the film that most famously sublimated crashing waves as sexual passion, the 1950's version of raw sex.
173;Oh, the good old days!!
174;Donna Reed won best supporting actress for her sensitive and underplayed role as a prostitute who falls in love with Clift.
175;A great film, which deservedly won Best Picture of 1953.
176;this Black White classic film broke all kinds of barriers for subject matter and character/star representation.
177;This movie certainly had a cast full of famous people, but I have to say it was not my favorite film.
178;All the same there definitely are some good moments.
179;"The screenplay is excellent and in a rarity for the time, there is really no happy ending at all and what I really liked about the film is that it came across as sincere and true to life
180;The acting is also very, very good even for the often underrated Montgomery Clift who never got his due as a great actor not only for this brilliant role but also for his work in """"The Misfits"""" and """"A Place In the Sun""""."""
181;"I thought Donna Reed was even better here than in ""It's a Wonderful Life""."
182;Having lived in Honolulu for a few years I can tell you that black and white doesn't do justice to what must be among the most beautiful settings that you can find in the world for any film let alone this masterpiece.
183;In fact, among the special features is a clip of director Fred Zinnemann's home movies from the set and even that was in colour!
184;"The featurette ""The Making of From Here To Eternity"" was very good as well as the excerpt from ""Fred Zinnemann: As I See It"" which is where we get to see his home movies."
185;The good news is that with the advent of Blu.
186;ray, the powers that be have the opportunity to do a much better restoration job on this great classic.
187;Let's hope they clean up the picture frame.
188;this movie won 8 Oscars in 1953
189;She has really enjoyed watching it over and over again.
190;Enjoyable classic to watch in Black and White.
191;The Scenes of earlly Hawaii were great and the cast and storyline were award winning.
192;(See my review of Moonstruck for more aspect ratio commentary that you'll find very interesting, if this one is interesting to you.
193;I ranted about its full.
194;THAT would keep you coming back to the cinema!
195;OK, this is a fine film and by 1953 standards probably deserving of all the honors.
196;And Burt Lancaster's performance was standout, thus renewing my respect for his work.
197;FROM HERE TO ETERNITY is a classic in many respects combining old school filmmaking with a more realistic narrative and starkness of the 50's.
198;I always thought Montgomery Clift's performance, as Private Prewitt is rather immortal and certainly a classic one.
199;A lot of focus fell upon Frank Sinatra, but I thought his brilliance as an actor came just a few years after this.
200;This is a film you really have to see and return to from time to time.
201;It is a straightforward film where the performances really give the film distinction.
202;But it is a highly memorable film when all is said and done.
203;Burt Lancaster and Ernie Borgnine steal this movie so easily, you wonder why the rest of the cast showed up.
204;It does have its moments, despite the fact that it's laden with 50's sentimentality and the mumbling method style of Monty Cliff.
205;Still, it beats the recent 'Pearl Harbor' hands.
206;Eternity isn't as satisfying as it was in the 50's, but it's still a good ride.
207;"I never got around to watching this film in its entirety until last year
208;it's a seamless movie from beginning to end, and although fans of the book (I haven't read it) deride it for not having been faithful enough to the core of the book, I think it stands alone as a monumental piece of cinema"
209;i recommend it to any writer, as a primer in how to write a classy, lean script that never wastes a line.
210;Received in a timely manner and in great condition.
211;Great story all the way, One of the best films ever made.
212;one of the most smoldering dramas ever filmed.
213;It's more an interesting take on military life before the war.
214;Sinatra is also very good in his award winning performance.
215;The actors, Lancaster and Cliff and all the others do a fantastic job.
216;There are several love stories intertwined with what life was like in the Army before Pearl Harbor.
217;A variety of human emotions through the eyes of a Military installation.
218;This film is so much more than the classic beach scene they play constantly on greatest movie moments clip shows.
219;The romantic beach scene is nice, but the real fireworks come right after, when Warden demands to know how many men she's been with.
220;Deborah Kerr's performance when she answers makes watching the film worthwhile and it's barely begun!The other main plot follows Montgomery Clift as Pruitt, a private and his buddy, Maggio, played by a charismatic Frank Sinatra, who almost steals the whole film.
221;He's a confident, funny drunkard of a solider, an absolute delight to watch.
222;Soon, his work ethic and love for the Army forge a bond between him and Warden.
223;Pruitt also is in love, with Lorene, played by Donna Reed, a social club girl.
224;the depiction of military life and the bond between the men in this movie was really well done.
225;layered, as complex as any in real life.
226;The actors all give amazing performances in this movie, never falling to soap opera hysterics.
227;Little wonder that it took a film from 1953 to do so.
228;i have to say, there are so many fine moments in this film, it really surprises me that the kiss in the water is the one most deeply associated with this movie.
229;"In my opinion, the scene in which Montgomery Clift plays ""Taps"" is a much more striking scene, much more symbolic of the film as a whole."
230;This is a romantic film, but it is so much more than that.
231;A classic truly deserving of the label.
232;I consider it a classic, and one that still is moving to watch.
233;I enjoyed it years ago, and enjoyed seeing it again.
234;I first saw From Here to Eternity at a theatre that shows classical films on the weekends about 20 years ago.
235;I saw it on a Friday and then came back the next day to see it again.
236;It has been said that Sinatra's performance resurrected his career and Burt Lancaster has always been an excellent actor.
237;As well as the conflict and tension percolating in the hearts and minds of the film's main characters.
238;i wait a couple of weeks or maybe a month and then I'm anxious to experience the tension and drama of this terrific film again.
239;It tells the story of the lives and relationships of several characters in the time leading up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour.
240;The film is well cast.
241;Lancaster gives a strong performance as the tough sergeant in love with his superior's wife, and Kerr is equally fine as the frustrated wife who has become famous for her dalliances.
242;Frank Sinatra gives a charismatic performance as Maggio, the soldier with a love of drinking who gets himself into trouble.
243;The dialogue is sharp and mature, the attack scenes are excellent, and there are a number of dramatic, memorable moments in this film.
244;Watch it for the beach scene, for Clift's superlative performance, and for all the qualities one would expect in a top notch film from Hollywood's Golden Era.
245;An excellent period piece that captures the last days just before the start of WWII.
246;The beach scene is always so romantic and it is a timeless film.
247;This is a great movie, and it is even greater after reading the back of the box.
248;"singing role, yet he got the part and won the 1958 ""Best Supporting Actor"" Oscar for his performance."
249;The back of the box has some interesting reading.
250;i would highly recommend seeing this movie.
251;The cast and acting are superb and certainly a tribute to the book.
252;Both the book and movie are classics.
253;if anyone knows the difference between the two (whether it's worth the dramatic price difference) and can make a recommendation, it would be greatly appreciated.
254;First, Jack's next viewing of the film, as he told me personally, was some twenty.
255;"I'm convinced that his memory of what he'd seen in that initial viewing had ""expanded"" over the years, particularly in light of the impact of Superman typecastingon Reeves's career and life."
256;well this film is timeless, great acting, great directing, great production and fantastic movie.
257;It won 8 Academy Awards, 2 for acting, directing and Best Picture , plus 4 others.
258;Some of the scenes are very well known.
259;layered human drama set within the larger canvas of World War II.
260;star cast is uniformly excellent.
261;winning turn as Maggio single.
262;My father is into a lot of the oldies and so i got this for him for Christmas.
263;One of my all time favorites actors, Burt Lancaster is superb.
264;Granted, it's considered the 52nd best film of all time by The American Film Institute and won 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture.
265;From Here to Eternity truly deserves to be in the top 100.
266;Problem is that Captain Holmes, his superior, wants him to box and is willing to do anything to Prewitt to make him box.
267;"Even though it takes place almost entirely on a military base, it's almost blasphemy to classify it as a war movie
268;His performance is probably the best in the film, he adds a lot of emotional depth and humor to the character that was on the page.
269;Lancaster is also fantastic in this powerful, beautiful motion picture.
270;Ordered this movie for my husband because this is one of his favorites.
271;Good value for the money.
272;, which is true, as well as """"From Here to Eternity"""" is a great classic film that was shot and originally released in 1.33:1 aspect ratio."""""""
273;released in the new widescreen format, 1.66, the following year.
274;Montgomery Clift shines here more than ever with his naked vulnerability.
275;STILL a worthy watch, even if it ain't the prettiest, cleanest image (now) available.
276;i acknowledge it as such a delusion now, thanks to our streaming ADD culture.
277;What a time we live in!)
278;This film it up there with The Best Years of Our Lives .
279;Oddly, the best films about WWII told the story of Americans before the war began and after it was over.
280;Excellent classic all the way through!!
281;Loved the war time period and the action in the movie.
282;A true classic with an all star cast.
283;The movie is in great condition and got here two days early!
284;The all star cast from Burt Lancaster to Deborah Kerr, Montgomery Cliff, Frank Sinatra, Earnest Borgnine, Donna Reed, also includes a small talking part for Steve Reeves.
285;term love and the frustrations of army life.
286;Frank Sinatra is the wise guy from New York that gets into big trouble, and Earnest Borgnine the brig's first sergeant.
287;the extra features speak of the search for the right actors, the director, and since it was filmed on a military base, the cooperation of the army.
288;an excellent film worth seeing.
289;Bought this because I hadn't seen it in years and it was just as good as I remembered it.
290;This classic film still has a lot going for it although it seems somewhat dated by today's standards.
291;It won the academy award in 1953 for Best picture, and most of the cast either won or were nominated for Oscars.
292;the story is about the peace time army in 1941, in Hawaii, in the few months before the historic Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
293;In the book there was a detailed account of her prostitution, but the movie glosses over that and makes it seem that all she does is dance with the soldiers.
294;The part is a good one, however, and one that won her an academy award.
295;The part is small but essential to the plot.
296;Sinatra's performance shines with authenticity and really showed he could act.
297;the audience is aware, of course, that all this is taking place in December of 1941, and there is a feeling of knowing something the characters don't .
298;Shot in black and white which dilutes the natural beauty of Hawaii.
299;however, It is a movie worth seeing.
300;And Clift's best friend Frank Sinatra really gets on Ernest Borgnine's nerves, so much so that he beats the living daylights out of him.
301;done movie, with many memorable scenes between Burt and Deborah, Burt and Ernie, and Frank Sinatra making the comeback of the century, crowned by an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.
302;While I can't actually say I like From Here to Eternity , I must respect its achievement as a depiction of the nasty world of the pre WW2 army.
303;With so many World War II movies focusing on the traumas of war, it's fascinating to see one which barely even mentions the war.
304;Finally, Clift struggles to hold everything together and do what's right.
305;life is twisted and tormented, and each character pushes along towards what they want in life.
306;Kerr is upset by her lot in life .
307;it's fascinating to look at this snapshot in time.
308;Great story and certainly a movie to keep in your library.
309;great condition and prompt service.
310;a great love story and without all the vulgarity of todays movies.
311;world War II relief , an anondyne, for a war.
312;Received quickly and in great shape really enjoyed it.
313;Thanks againif we take the time to review then you shouldent tell us how many words to use!
314;march Boy awards: Picture, Director.
315;there's no doubt about it, with a cast of the stature of Montgomery Clift, Burt Lancaster, Deborah Kerr, Frank Sinatra and Donna Reed and a simple, fine, unfussy director like Fred Zinneman who really knows how to bring out tight crisp performances and stage the sequences, From Here to Eternity is a great technical achievement.
316;Clift (Prew) shows that he is more than a pretty boy clothing model with his subtle facial expressions.
317;Deborah Kerr (Karen) sheds her 'saintly Virgin Mary' image (Black Narcissus, Quo Vadis and The King and I) showing that she can play the unholy as well as the holy and does a very good job putting on an American accent.
318;Best of all is Frank Sinatra as the eccentric Maggio.
319;"his comic relief ""I love women tall as trees."""
320;and the drunk scenes are hilarious.
321;fred Zinneman's direction is absolutely flawless and the editing is superb, especially the up and down shots during the invasion when you see the airplane view of the soldiers running this way and that on the lawn like ants.
322;It all boils down to the enjoyment value of the story.
323;She leaves the island with her husband.
324;But that guy WANTED to box with you.
325;From Here to Eternity remains one of the most compelling stories that shows how people function under the pressures of war, a dysfunctional personality and those who are looking for a purpose in life.
326;Fred Zimmerman's direction was supurb and he brought out the best in each of the scenes along with dramatic camera work that shows the actors at their height.
327;Nice to be able to turn back the hands of time for a couple of hours and enjoy the performances of many actors no longer with us today.
328;Also nice to watch a movie that actually tells a story through dialogue and allows the viewer to use his/her imagination instead of having glaring intimate sex scenes and special effects constantly blaring across the screen.
329;this film is hollywood at its finest.
330;while sinatra won an oscar, it is lancaster that really shines.
331;also offers a terrific ending that is not glossy.
332;From Here to Eternity is a Hollywood classic.
333;It may be the finest film ever about the military in peacetime.
334;Judging by the crisp dialog and snappy khaki uniforms, I'm giving the director the benefit of any doubt.
335;"I always thought it fascinating that an Austrian born Director could be at the helm of such classics as ""High Noon"" and FHTE ."
336;Prewitt is a top bugler who isn't allowed to bugle and a top boxer who reuses to box for the company team!
337;Her sensitivity toward Clift produces some of the best scenes in FHTE.
338;"The interplay between Lancaster/Kerr and Clift/Reed caused some huge challenges for the Director in making the bawdy best selling novel ""clean"" for the silver screen in the still conservative, prudish America of 1953."
339;The last two are important: FHTE revived Frank's career.
340;Montgomery Clift makes love to a bugle.
341;Not really, but it is still the greatest film ever.
342;This disc is a high.
343;Of course this movie is great, otherwise it would not have won 8 Oscars.
344;i watched it again yesterday and I liked it, but I came nowhere close to such excitement.
345;All the parts come together magnificently here to make a great classic film.
346;I watched it on T. v. with my wife and it was wonderful.
347;super crisp and sharp,but when I received the Blu Ray it was a Shock.
348;From Here to Eternity won the Best Picture Oscar and it is a movie that still stands up to the test of time.
349;Burt Lancaster is tough to the soldiers but in offguard moments shows he has a strong, caring side.
350;Deborah Kerr and Donna Reed, both cast against type, turn in very admirable performances.
351;the video is superb, lots of grain, good solid blacks.
352;(For those who don't know the movie, it is in superb black and white.
353;The extras are surprisingly slim for a fim like this, but a few of them are excellent.
354;It has a number of people, including the director's son, discussing the making of the film while you are watching it.
355;There are also a few captions that appear that are scene specific.
356;There is an excellent 9.
357;"minute excerpt from ""Fred Zinnemann: As I see It"", and there are some nice color home."
358;It will have you wanting more.
359;And there is an excellent audio commentary by Tim Zinneman and Alvin Sargent.
360;From Here To Eternity is an outstanding adaption of the popular James Jones novel.
361;It's an extremely romantic film that deals with the lives and loves of several soldiers just before the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
362;It is considered one of the most romantic movie scenes ever, and it certainly deserves that title!
363;Deborah Kerr gives what many consider her finest performance as Karen, the woman whose marriage has had no meaning to her for a very long time.
364;She frequently has scandalous affairs with the men in her husband's company.
365;wrenching movie, and it should be seen by all!
366;and the blueray just looks so good, it's like watching it for the very first time.
367;I read the novel first wondering how they could make the transition from paper to film but they did it,and did it beautifully.
368;The cast was superb, especially Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, the chemistry they had on camera is tough to find these days.
369;The movie is a 5 star classic for sure, so this short review of of the Blu.
370;a Few good shorts with a very good but very short behind the scene home movie of the filming, a good audio commentary with pop.
371;For a black and white film, it's a good entry but not in the outstanding category of The Maltese Falcon or Strangers on a Train,
372;Many people do not realize that along with a great performance by Frank Sinatra.
373;we can also see the Great George Reeves in a rare performance.
374;This actually is a Christmas gift for our son who had been stationed at Schofield Barracks prior to deployment.
375;He's lived in Hawaii, and we thought it would be a nice Christmas gift to see the Army and Hawaii in the 1950s.
376;We have seen it ourselves, and it's a classic!
377;This is in the top 10 of my all time favorite films!
378;This is also Deborah Kerr in one of her finest perfomances.
379;Lancaster was also very good in this film.
380;And Sinatra completes this cast of great acting.
381;Well worth seeing again and agian!
382;Truly one of the best movies that Burt Lancaster made, great all star cast and location was perfect.
383;Story line was very well scripted and actors did a great job.
384;this is an ageless classic with a great casts.
385;Frank Sinatra and Earnest Borgnine really standout for their roles.
386;A must see for fans of classic movies and war film collectors.
387;The extras are interesting as well.
388;This is a case of an outstanding movie being adapted from a great book.
389;fROM HERE TO ETERNITY presents a realistic portrait of army life in Hawaii immediately before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
390;An extremely competent supporting cast includes Jack Warden, Philip Ober and Mickey Shaughnessy.
391;burt Lancaster makes a convincing first sergeant.
392;One who is running the show and is full of knowledge about how the army really works.
393;He also has good instincts when it comes time to act as he demonstrates in the showdown with the sadistic Fatso played by Ernest Borgnine.
394;Borgnine himself is exceptional in his most famous impersonation of a villain.
395;frank Sinatra definitely deserves his Oscar in the role of the defiant Maggio.
396;budget production but it still managed to receive five Academy Awards and eight nominations.
397;It is old TV size and not widescreen but the sound and picture is great!
398;A beautiful transfer of one of the greatest movies ever made.
399;The extras give lots of information that enhance the viewing experience.
400;This is one of the great classic war movies.
401;The cast is first rate with Frank Sinatra and Donna Reed leading the way.
402;Nevertheless it's still very good and I would recommend it to others.
403;Now Lancaster is terrific, a soldier's soldier and Deborah Kerr slips into the part of a lonely wife of a louse effortlessly.
404;kerr romance works almost, but the Cliff.
405;She's a dance hostess my a**.
406;"hard fans of ""old Hollywood"" are bound to be disappointed.yet, curiously I just took a peek at the votes and they are overwhelmingly 4 and 5 stars!!!!"
407;(well, it would be nice.
408;"there are (almost) always a few ""delights"" to offer us some respite from the suffocating mediocrity:1."
409;well, I forgot about the 'net nowadays.
410;or even at his best looking, perhaps ten years after the movie, is hard, hard, to believe.4.
411;Perhaps Ernest Borgnine played it best, since I got so involved with his repulsive behavior that I could forget he was acting.5.
412;"this is B. grade CHEAP ""entertainment"" that amazes when you are told that the movie won X. amount of Oscars."
413;Yeah, the story is great, and the acting is top.
414;but, let's be honest, the most memorable element of the film is the romp on the beach between stars Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr.
415;This film deserves its status as a classic if for no other reason than the fact that it pushed the boundaries of what could be depicted in the Hollywood of the early Fifties.
416;Herein is the strength of the film: its round characterization, which is convincing and therefore engaging.
417;If you've ever visited Hawaii, you'll enjoy the vistas, although they're actually few and far between.
418;Still, the conflicts are genuinely configured and the resulting tension is thick and suspenseful.
419;And need I say that the film benefits from the endearing title of the novel on which its crisp screenplay is based?
420;SONY did a great job on this release that includes a cover sleeve with original pressing, multiple poster cards inside and a few bonus features on the disk.
421;Overall this is a great Blu.
422;"Always love Donna Reed
423;the attack is one of the great sequences in War Films.
424;when they succeed in hitting one plane they are delighted by the flavor of war.
425;with this powerful scene all the connecting parts that hold together the characters of the story are permanently altered.
426;The great event reduces the characters' pains and passions.
427;World War II is a force that modified everything.
428;War, in this film, is bigger than people.
429;the highlights of the film are many, but let me mention the best: Clift playing a flamboyant blues in a local beer joint.
430;The blues came rushing out, expelled from his body by the strength of his feelings"
431;He proves himself as an inspiring leader of men when the barracks were under attack.
432;montgomery Clift gives, perhaps, the best performance of his career as the bugler.
433;frank Sinatra is terrific in his rebellious role of Angelo Maggio.
434;He gives a deep and intense characterization, winning an Academy Award.
435;donna Reed is excellent as the charming social woman of the evening.
436;"winner of eight Academy Awards, ""From Here to Eternity"" is a clear indicative of how war comes into collision with the destinies of people, throwing them violently into a turbulent and dangerous situation."
437;The language of the novel was a big departure in popular American fiction, and the movies had not caught up with readers.
438;Hollywood has never staged a realistic fight.
439;Above all the film features superb acting performances and an absorbing screenplay.
440;In addition Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift and Deborah Kerr all received Oscar nominations for their acting in the movie.
441;Holmes' commanding officers observing this from above make the above comment.
442;"rated
443;I was moved the first time I saw this years ago as much as I am now.
444;He was unique, untraditional in many ways.
445;There are so many other great actors in this film too, and the footage of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, from newsreels of other naval battles, is so realistic, so effectively woven into the story.
446;Well worth watching several times over, and never mind the famous, steamy smooching scene on a beach of Honolulu"
447;True gem of a movie.
448;From Here to Eternity is a promising film that has occasional moments of excellent acting .
449;primarily from the enigmatically charming everyman Montgomery Clift .
450;This is the stuff of Peyton Place, and both the novelist, James Jones, and the screenwriter, Daniel Taradash, realize this, so shocking .
451;one struggles to understand the motivations of the characters in this film even as we can accept the morally strong case that Prewitt has for refusing to box on the company team.
452;Though sanitized for Hays Office protection, director Fred Zinnemann and screenwriter Daniel Taradash bring out the best in James Jones' pre.
453;The entire cast is memorable, yet Montgomery Clift's brilliant performance stands out.
454;Among the film's numerous awards, Burnett Guffey earned an Oscar for his atmospheric cinematography.
455;If the movie was about anything, if was about standing up for what you believe is right.
456;The best scenes came at the end, when everyone rallied to the attack on Pearl Harbor.
457;This is such a classic, one of the most beautiful movies of all time.
458;Some movies should never be remade and this one stands perfect as is.
459;The star studded cast and the beautiful script make this movie one of the best movies ever.
460;Montgomery Clift deserved an Oscar for this performance and should get an honorary Oscar for whoever is reading this.
461;This is my all time favorite movie and I highly recommend this to everyone who is a lover of older movies.
462;This production was well written, and well executed.
463;Obviously most other people found it more enjoyable.
464;Is this the best image I've seen on B. ray?
465;ray technology arrived and now I've got 2 very good prints of these great classics.
466;picture track, it's very informative and interesting and it brings interactive information during the commentary with images and graphics, it's more visual than a regular audio commentary, I liked it.
467;So if you love the movie, the B. ray is worth the upgrade.
468;I love the timeless feel and the actors and fact that Mr Cliffe is in this classic doesn't hurt.
469;It was a terrific film when it was new and it still qualifies when I pass it on to my son.
470;The bits I'd seen over the years showed great acting, certainly, but the story seemed too soap opera.
471;The cast is impeccable, from the steely but humane Lancaster to the gleefully sadistic Ernest Borgnine to the lovely and affecting Kerr and Reed.
472;It's not a happy story by any means but it may still give you a sense of joy to watch it.
473;wow how far from the mark can you get.
474;It's place in cinematic history remains secure: Frank Sinatra's Oscar, Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr embracing in the surf, and the Oscar for Best Picture.
475;lives story.Yet the film still has many things going for it.
476;All of the performances are fine: Sinatra reminds viewers just how talented an actor he was in years past, the chemistry between Lancaster and Kerr is still electric, and Clift turns in another low.
477;It's a great movie with great acting.
478;Lots of action and a very good drama.
479;I highly recommend this film for anyone who is a collector!
480;The movie is a classic and one of Deborah Kerr's most provocative rolls.
481;i'm a big fan of her too.
482;I will know better the next time I watch a classic movie.
483;I'll choose the regular full.
484;For me, this is the best of the WW2.
485;level, human interest plot fit together with seamless precision.
486;Burt Lancaster was a gorgeous knockout.
487;Wow, about as raw as it gets.
488;I first saw this film back in the early 1950s and loved it then.
489;To see it now brings back so many good memories of the old army.
490;I recommend it highly for the history of it.
491;"This is a real sickness as we move closer to pure pornography in the name of ""realism."""
492;Was the acting good in the setting, and was it true to its time in story and presentation (given dramatic license).
493;If these are true than it is somewhere from excellent to great.
494;This film is both, most especially in the action between Sinatra and Borgnine.
495;it is VERY fine, but not quite great (watch 12 Angry Men and others).
496;Taps is an eerie tune, that can get to you if done right.
497;From Here to Eternity is considered a classic film, daring for its time in showing the love affairs of some of the characters before Pearl Harbor.
498;what was considered daring in 1953 is everyday in 2013.
499;Still, this film is legend, Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr give great performances, and every movie lover should see this film at least once.
500;series, From Here to Eternity may be toned down to please both the censors and the US Army, whose co. operation was vital to the film, but it's still a superb piece of film.
501;daniel Taradish's screenplay is a masterpiece of snappy construction, perfectly mirrored by Fred Zinnemann's directorial style that brings out both the toughness and the sentiment with a convincing lack of sensationalism.
502;And what a cast: Lancaster a convincing mixture of toughness and emotional vulnerability, a surprisingly sexy Kerr, Donna Reed playing tough against type, Borgnine at his meanest and a wonderful array of character actors.
503;Clift may make an unlikely boxer, but his performance is one of his best, as is that of Sinatra, always under.
504;This is still well worth adding to your collection, though.
505;Some great performances and some scenes marred by incomplete story telling and weird pacing.
506;If you are alive right now and can view it, you should.
507;I'm giving it an extra star for influencing The Clash.
508;The other focusing on Fred Zinneman, the movie's director, is slighlty more interesting.
509;Take a look at Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge on the River Kwai However, I'm glad I got this and recommend it despite my gripes.
510;All I can remember of the movie from 1954/1955 was that it was the best movie I had ever seen.
511;All of those stars, producers, writers, everyone involved, from the movie made it a great movie.
512;happy the movie arrived on time,however,the movie was in SPANISH!!!!!!!!!!!
513;i l wanted them to see one of my favorite movies.
514;I picked this up because it's one of my favorite WWII movies, though it's little light on the war.
515;lord knows in this day.
516;But immerse yourself in the time and place, and it's one of the hottest scenes in a movie of the era.
517;"i think ""the kiss"" tends to overshadow what is otherwise a very rich and gritty movie."
518;An excellent ensemble cast (Sinatra at his finest as an actor) pulls us in to their world and gets us so engrossed in their lives that I think we tend to forget what's about to happen.
519;This a great movie, would watch this movie again.
520;I've done enough writing in my life.
521;This is a fantastic film!
522;"On every level, this is a great film
523;Furthermore, it provides a reasonably critical perspective on the Army that illustrates both the virtues and the vices of servicemembers.
