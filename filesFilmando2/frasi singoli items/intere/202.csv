1;Mildred Pierce a 109 minute black and white film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actress, Michael Curtiz's 1945 noir classic.
2;This film features a great, Oscar.
3;She certainly had a reason to kill her good.
4;With the help of Wally's keen business skills she secures an ideal place to open a restaurant.
5;After Mildred divorces Bert, she is lured in by the handsome Monte's charms.
6;The film is very reflective of 1940s attitudes about independent women who desert the idea of a nuclear family, and how dangerous it could be for them to do that.
7;But she finds a job as a waitress and does real good.
8;Mildred hopes to open her own restaurant, and finds a suitable property.
9;mildred works hard to make her restaurant a success.
10;Mildred's hard work and management made her restaurant a big success, with other locations.
11;"Mildred finds out that Veda is a singer at Wally Faye's bar
12;All I knew was that it was a story about the relationship between a mother and daugther and that Joan Crawford won the Academy Award for her performance.
13;As the credits rolled and I read the name James M. cain I knew I was in for a surprise.
14;Mildred Pierce impressed me so much that I consider it one of the all.
15;But thank goodness for the internet I was able to research the Lana Turner story and found out it happened in 1958.
16;Mildred Pierce is kind of hard to describe.
17;Maybe it's best I don't.
18;I'm not sure """"Pierce"""" is really her best performance."""
19;Back in the 1930s when she was working for MGM Crawford made some truly amazing films.
20;"Actors and actress give one great performance after another and never win an award and when they finally do win it's for a ""lesser"" performance."
21;"I mean, do you mean to tell me ""Scent of A Woman"" is really Al Pacino's best performance?"
22;Mildred Pierce does such a great job creating a noir mood.
23;The more money and power she gets the broader her shoulders are made to look.
24;line: One of the best noir films I've seen.
25;A movie that leaves a lasting impression on the viewer.
26;While I don't think it's Crawford's best performance, it is effective nonetheless.
27;now the name of high.
28;boiler novelist James M. Cain is well.
29;But here is the twist in Mildred Pierce.
30;timing as well) and the Pierces decided to divorce.
31;Mildred decided, very unconventionally for the times, to open a restaurant to keep the wolves from the door (and keep Veda in things, many things, ungratefully accepted).
32;And the callous and very class.
33;As always though in crime noir truth and justice will win out and Veda had to take her fall and will have many a lonely night to think over her errors in some dank California women's prison far from the bright lights of Los Angeles night clubs.
34;Best known for bringing Joan Crawford to an Oscar win, `Mildred Pierce' is a nice slice of contemporary crime noir heaven complete with slick performances, witty dialog and subtle yet engaging direction.
35;It pretty much has everything that one could ask for from a film of this genre, despite the fact that it pretty short of believable.
36;It's beyond entertaining and certainly one of the more satisfying films of the 40's.
37;"She eventually makes good on her savvy business sense and unwavering determination and opens a chain of successful restaurants that launch her into wealth
38;crawford is serviceable as Mildred, although I must say that I found her to be the films weakest link, performance wise.
39;He really understood the style of the 40's film noir, and his enthusiastic and often suggestive delivery really complimented the direction of the film.
40;He just captured my attention from beginning to end.
41;Eve Arden has a few scenes, but she uses them to the full"
42;"Zachary Scott is full of seductive charms, but he also brushes each frame with that snooty presence that screams ""SCOUNDREL""."
43;worthy characters in the history of cinema and yet she was utterly delicious thanks to Blyth.
44;series (with the beloved Kate Winslet no less) and really feel that taking their time and expanding on this film will really create something wonderful, for there is so much here that is merely touched upon that will make for scrumptious viewing.
45;with style, grace and edge, `Mildred Pierce' is most definitely a film I'd recommend to anyone wanting a nice taste of the 40's.
46;i ordered this great movie and it came quickly.
47;now lets get to the point Mildred Pierce the original version starring Jone Crawford is a great film there's just something about classics like these that's timeless and just plane fun to watch.
48;Most films of the '40s and '50s, no matter how excellent, are firmly rooted in a particular time and place.
49;this film is an amazing exception.
50;The women are strong and independent, the dialogue is fresh, intelligent, and unsentimental, and the pace is quick.
51;this is a real gem of a movie that has stood the test of time.
52;She displays a lot of the typical qualities that are fitting of a soap opera star.
53;winning performance, I believe the mink coat complete with shoulder pads did all of the work for her.
54;fetched ideas such as the immediate success of Mildred the entrepreneur.
55;food experience came furnished with a full.
56;"stabbing, guns blazing
57;I've never been a big fan of older movies, but """"Mildred Pierce"""" is one of those rare films that holds my attention from beginning to end."""
58;star best as the title character: an ambitious, hard.
59;working woman willing to do ANYTHING to gain the love and respect of her self.
60;Ann Blyth is sinfully wonderful as uber.
61;snob Veda Pierce, but Joan's Mildred is the one that steals the show.
62;The ending, where Veda gets what she richly deserves (and anyone with an ounce of compassion prays she'll get), is both the most heart.
63;wrenching and satisfying moment of all.
64;Mildred Pierce has quickly become one of my favorite movies of all time.
65;screen demeanor, but as an actress the woman was most definitely in a class all her own.
66;Joan is one of my favorite actresses.
67;I collect classic movies and this one came to me almost completeing my list of Joan Crawford movies that I want.
68;for all the reasons listed elsewhere amongst these reviews , this is a must own 45' masterpiece .
69;the entire cast is outstanding .
70;Great direction by Michael Curtiz, and a top.
71;Joan Crawford delivers a legendary performance.
72;Great script that also works as a murder mystery.
73;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film an 8!
74;Warner has done a wonderful job of restoring this magnificent melodrama, and whatever you think of Crawford, she was rarely given such a marvellous opportunity nor surrounded by so many great talents.
75;Chief among these is director Michael Curtiz who proves yet again why he was one of the great directors of the era.
76;His trade mark roving camera style which made Rick's cafe in CASABLANCA seem a real place that one wants to revisit over and over again, here creates an almost voyeurs view of events in 1940s LA, especially at Monty Berrigan's Beach House, a superb stylised set by the unsung genius of Hollywood Art Directors .
77;Ann Blyth was nominated as Best Supporting Actress and should have won for her stomach.
78;and Zachary Scott is perfectly cast as the rich, slimy Monty Berrigan.
79;Maybe it does water down the novel but it is so richly entertaining, who cares?
80;rival Bette Davis turned it down) and gives a superlative performance that is quintessential Crawford.
81;frame picture restoration is outstanding.
82;The sound track has also been cleaned up, and is a treat for the ear!
83;I second all the positive opinions on this page.
84;"The very entertaining (often in unintentional ways) ""Torch Song"" is another choice movie."
85;I don't have to go to the store, and I love that.
86;if you love old movies this one is one of the best!!
87;This is a classic soaper, and it re.
88;I can't think of a more despicable character than that played by Blyth, the selfishness and meanness of her is incredible.
89;The acting is superb all around, the script (based on the James Cain novel) sizzles.
90;entertaining Hollywood picture, a little ahead of its time.
91;This film is a gem from the Hollywood era.
92;Joan Crawford delivers a terrific performance as Mildred Pierce, a middle.
93;the acting in Mildred Pierce is incredible.
94;Combine great acting with a cracking plot and you'll find that Mildred Pierce is a must.
95;One of the great film noirs of all time.
96;This is another great movie with Joan Crawford.
97;Thought the entire cast did a fantastic job and a great story.
98;The performances are superb, the storyline captivating.
99;it also provides a glimpse into the time period with the cars, smoking, and style of the WW2 era.
100;Since everyone and their brother has reviewed the film, which is possibly the GREATEST example of film noir ever captured, I'll review the Joan special on the flip.
101;the special, narrated by the uberfab Anjelica Huston, is a great way to get to know our beloved Joan.
102;Including rare clips from early films and radio spots, we are taken on a ride of what it was like being Crawford from the early 30s to her death in 1977.
103;"She frankly responded with, ""I told you never to interfere with me and my children and you can just get out."""
104;Joan is so good in this movie, that I once read somewhere that someone commented on how you could actually believe Joan WAS Mildred, that you could actually believe it when she was mixing that cake batter.
105;considered one of the best woman's picture in cinema history, Mildred Pierce is actually a brilliant film noir that works on many levels.
106;What a delight this is!
107;The amazing cast also includes Jack Carson, Lee Patrick, Zachary Scott and Eve Arden as Mildred's wisecracking best friend (in what surprisingly turned out to be her sole Oscar.
108;Bonus features (on the flipside of the disc) are just as good, with the acclaimed feature.
109;A trailer gallery for all of the Crawford/Warner Brothers films is also quite interesting.
110;Great '40 's genre movie of lifestyle from the costumes and scenery .
111;An archaic and rather lengthy film with an unusually detailed storyline.
112;some of which touches on universal themes of human nature.
113;Yet despite her personal flaws, she was an undeniably great actress.
114;I think her personal trauma enabled her to become 1 of the best actresses to ever grace the silver screen.
115;She took from her own fragmented existence and brought the characters she portrayed to life!With that said, Mildred Pierce is a MASTERPIECE!!!
116;A brilliantly portrayed and directed film with an awesome cast.
117;It is 1 of Joan's and hollywood's best films!
118;I'd highly recommend it to anyone that loves classic movies.
119;I found it to be one of the most strongly emotionally.
120;affecting movies I'd ever seen.
121;"i think it's best that the viewer comes to it without any knowledge of the surprising plot, so all I'll say is that it's about a mother who would do ""anything"" for her daughter."
122;Joan Crawford gives one of her greatest performances in this movie.
123;It's one I can watch over and over.
124;A perfect example of how giving a child everything will often bring only heartache .
125;I had to watch this movie for a film class and it was actually a movie that I enjoyed and was entertained by.
126;I love film noir and this is classic, terribly said statement on what happens when you indulge your children too much
127;which she won an Academy Award for best actress in a leading role and movie of the year!
128;and the strong female roles were before their time!
129;compelling perfomances ala film noir.
130;I do absolutely love this movie and Joan Crawford does an amazing job as Mildred, yet I do have one issue.
131;make it she does, stumbling into the restaurant business and making a success of it in spite of the fact that men find her so darned irresistible that she has to stop and peel one off every few steps.
132;time favorites, is her usual wonderful self as Mildred's shrewd secretary and loyal friend.
133;I will let you know when I find them.
134;For a film to be called film noir there needs to be a gritty realism to it.
135;But, because the work is immanently melodramatic, the foregrounding of style over any deeper elements, actually makes the film more enjoyable as a guilty pleasure.
136;And, on that score, Mildred Pierce is terrific.
137;But, it is a film loaded with charm and appeal, and a `who cares if it's over the top?'
138;This is one of my favorite movies!Everything was as it was described.
139;this movie is a great addiction to my movie collection.
140;This gets high points for the fine acting, memorable characters and successful melding pf a film noir with a soap opera.
141;Three people are totally despicable, one is nice and sensible, and two are somewhere in the middle.
142;eve Arden, who provides the humor and common sense consistently.
143;Zachary Scott, ,as Mildred's second husband, a slimy, gold.
144;working, good businesswomen and very devoted mother.
145;Finally, Bruce Bennett, as Mildred's first husband, has common sense regarding the kids, shows forgiveness and loyalty at the end, but cheats on his wife to begin with and walks out.Yeah, as you can see above, it's soapy for a film noir.
146;but it features interesting characters.
147;I watched the rest of the film, glued to the screen.
148;She thouroughly dominated the screen from beginning to end.
149;All three principle female leads got academy award nominations for this film, Crawford won Best Actress, and there's no arguing she deserved it.
150;The film transferred beautifully, with razor.
151;sharp definition and wonderful light and dark areas.
152;This film is true film noir, and the lighting played a major role in the movie.
153;"On the disc flip side, there is a wonderful documentary on Crawford's life called ""Joan Crawford: The Ultimate Movie Star""."
154;worth watching on its own, so to have it included is great.
155;Amazing what the right role, script, and director can do for a strong actor.
156;I watched this film with my 21 year old son who is taking a college film class.
157;Surprising to me, we both enjoyed it.
158;Joan Crawford is a sympathetic character and her acting is excellent.
159;Ann Blyth who plays Veda, in this movie based losely on the novel, steals the show with an outstanding performance and makes the movie work.
160;The print is so clear and sound so good, it is almost like seeing it for the first time.
161;Joan Crawford is excellent, dispelling the myth that she was a movie star, not an actress.
162;The storyline is constantly surprising and the supporting case, from Eve Arden and Anne Blyth to Jack Carson are all excellent.
163;Also included on the disc are some really great trailers from all of Crawford's Warner Brothers movies, dating from 1945.1952, as well as The Women and Baby Jane.
164;This is a movie famous for remaking Joan Crawford's career, but it is a crackerjack piece of early film noir, and from a major studio at that.
165;ish, and really a much better film but who's quibbling.
166;Crawford is great at re.
167;Michael Curtiz sets the tone, along with the professional way Warner Brothers understood how to make middle class look like middle class.
168;And always, always, always the inimitable, sublime Eve Arden, who can do more with a snappy line reading than anyone in history (Christine Baranski must have studied every film she was ever in).
169;"Simply stated: ""Mildred"" is a truly outstanding motion picture experience!!"
170;I was riveted to my seat for the entire 1.
171;The opening shadowy scenes with Joan Crawford and Jack Carson are remarkable!
172;"carson, by the by, is fantastic in ""Mildred""."
173;"also keep your eyes peeled for one of the best ""screen slaps"" I've seen in a while!"
174;"If you've never seen ""Mildred"" before, do yourself a huge favor and do so."
175;Joan Crawford is captivating as she struggles with her life's problems.
176;Still great movies to watch and to have in collection.
177;Joan Crawford is never bad to begin with, but the story/plot in this movie is so detailed and each character seems to come to life.
178;I can't reveal much of the story without the worry of being a spoiler, but it is great story and I loved it!
179;well playboy / social weasel and last, by not least, the ungrateful and social climbing daughter from Hell.
180;Her tart and feisty and incredibly smart.
181;Her eyes showing every emotion, as she takes you along with her on a life half full, half empty.
182;Great acting, very good story, well done production.
183;Great vintage movie which was filmed and directed very well.
184;i loved every minute of it.
185;This is one of my favorite movies from Mrs. Crawford.
186;I saw this movie on TCM but they didnt sell it.
187;i like to use my imagination to guessdress color, car etc. it's amazing to watch joan Crawford's character show such love to her daughter Veda to thepoint of smothering .
188;Last year, I had the pleasure of seeing this movie again on the big screen in our city.
189;This movie is whitty, smart and touches just a little too close to home.
190;It was a most interesting plot and well acted.
191;Mildred Pierce features the best performance of Joan Crawford's career and it bagged her the Oscar for Best Actress in the process.
192;Joan Crawford is astounding as a desperate woman willing to do anything to protect her ungrateful children.
193;The supporting cast are also on top form and the film is a joy to look at, beautifully photographed and fully restored.
194;So many great one liners.
195;she's the only one still alive .
196;She was one of the biggest stars of the 30s and 40s, and AFI rates her #10 on the list of the All Time Greatest Female Stars.
197;Crawford made a career in the 30s playing a working girl who succeeds, so her role in Mildred Pierce was perfect.
198;"She was nominated for an Oscar for her role in this film and won a Laurel for ""The Helen Morgan Story"" (1957)."
199;there is an excellent supporting cast with Jack Carson, Zach Scott, Eve Arden, Bruce Bennett, and Butterfly McQueen.
200;"He's best known for his films with Dennis Morgan (""Shine on, Harvest Moon"", ""Two Guys from Milwaukee"")."
201;funny and sarcastic Eve Arden (1908.90) plays a friend of Crawford.
202;"She was nominated for an Oscar for this film but she's best known for her Emmy winning role as ""Our Miss Brooks"" (1952.6)."
203;director Michael Curtiz (1886.1962) is best known for his 7 films with Errol Flynn.
204;"He was nominated for an Oscar for their first collaboration (""Captain Blood"", 1935), and received 2 more nominations for films with Jimmy Cagney ."
205;"and one win for a film with Bogart (""Casablanca"", 1942)."
206;ernest Haller (1896.1970) provides beautiful black and white photography and tilts toward film noir even if he doesn't embrace it fully.
207;"Between 1935 and 1956 he was nominated for an Oscar 19 times, and won for ""Since You Went Away"" (1944), ""Now Voyager"" (1942), and ""The Informer"" (1935)."
208;"The big Oscar and Golden Globe winner was ""The Lost Weekend"" (Picture, Director, Actor)."
209;"Notable films released that year included film noir classic ""Scarlett Street""."
210;a sincere and generally effective characterization .
211;"the film benefits not only from great direction, photography, and acting, it's one of the few twists on the classic film noir where the female is the hapless hero led down a tragic path, and the ""femme fatale"" is actually a man (Zach Scott)."
212;this classic film noir with a twist benefits from great acting, direction, and photography making it a must see for film fans.
213;And so the story unravels as Mildred tells her story to the police.
214;And is worth watching to the very end!
215;If you are a fan of the classics , this is one of the greatest I've seen.
216;She has two daughters, Veda and Kay.
217;This movie is brilliantly photographed, and Joan Crawford is totally awesome as Mildred.
218;She really plays this character to the extreme.
219;She certainly did deserve the Oscar!
220;The screenplay of this movie is great for it's time, and has some hilarious lines that are delivered dead on by the actor's.
221;This is film noir at it's best.
222;It keeps stopping and pausing.
223;Joan Crawford and Ann Blythe deliver convincing performances in this story of sick relationships.
224;The dialogue is refreshingly terse and Joan Crawford never breaks character.
225;I own the movie on VHS and I can remember vividly the first time I saw it: It was during spring break in 1995.
226;"I watched it on a Saturday during the NCAA Basketball tournament and I can tell you that out of all of the movies that I've seen in my life ""Mildred Pierce"" is the most shocking movie I ever saw."
227;it's the type of story that attracts people of almost all ages because it's real and could have happened anytime, anywhere.
228;Ann Blyth is an excellent Veda.
229;Joan Crawford's Oscar was well deserved.
230;Zachary Scott gave another good performance.
231;There's something to discover about it every time I watch it.
232;minute documentary about Joan, are fantastic.
233;This is wonderful and a super entertaining.
234;It was great fun visiting the 40's.
235;The characters are over the top.
236;She remains motherly and virtuous, as she reallizes that she can be shark at business to keep the funds flowing for Veda's expensive hobbies.
237;this is worth a watch for everyone.
238;It seems like a crowd pleaser.
239;One of Joan Crawford's best movies, you won't be disappointed.
240;A true five star movie with many twist and turns.
241;"Film Noir never had it so good: Mildred Pierce combines the toughness of the Cain novel
242;shadow film noir classic"
243;dealing spirit to make Mildred Pierce a vastly entertaining ride.
244;And if you ever wondered what made Crawford one of the great stars of her era.
245;"Film Noir never had it so good: Mildred Pierce combines the toughness of the Cain novel
246;shadow film noir classic"
247;dealing spirit to make Mildred Pierce a vastly entertaining ride.
248;And if you ever wondered what made Crawford one of the great stars of her era.
249;True Joan style and a classic.
250;This was a great touch and I can't wait to order from them again.
251;Joan Crawford in her well deserved Oscar role.
252;If you have seen the mini series remake do yourself a favour and watch this as it superior in every department.
253;This is a movie classic and I didn't have to pay an arm and a leg to get it!
254;This was quite a sensational movie for its time involving themes of infidelity and incest.
255;Joan Crawford won an Oscar for her tormented performance in this film.
256;As she enters a world of affluence including a glamorous beach house, she finds herself in competition with her daughter for the affections of her scoundrel husband.
257;The lovely Ann Blyth and foppish Zachary Scott play the semi.
258;Michael Curtiz turns in a solid directorial drama.
259;George James Hopkins designed some memorable sets for the beach house and Crawford's business.
260;Composer Max Steiner turns in another of his wonderful scores.
261;Mildred Pierce is one of those great classics we don't see enough of.
262;Second time 'round it was excellent!
263;This movie is Joan Crawford at her very best!
264;The plot and the characters are very believable and the acting is superb!
265;A great movie for anyone who loves not only a top notch movie from Hollywood's heyday but, a movie which has Joan Crawford as the star.
266;This is an interesting mix of women's film and film noir.
267;But what makes it ultimately work is the same kind of dissonance also found in Curtiz' Casablanca, .
268;joan Crawford is, well, Joan Crawford.
269;Her steeliness belies the purported warmth and lovingness of the title character.
270;There are hints that her self.
271;It gets campy in parts, but camp has to have a core of emotional truth if it's going to succeed.
272;mildred Pierce succeeds very well indeed.
273;It is indeed a fascinating amalgam of two wildly divergent styles.
274;As with Casablanca before it, director Michael Curtiz offers a bit of romance, a lot of self.
275;director, screenplay cinematography, costumes, sets etc. are all great.
276;Crawford's top flight performance is enhanced by the terrific supporting cast.
277;Arden is terrific stealing every scene she is in with her looks, deportment and trademark voice.
278;MP is a movie worth seeing again and again.
279;mildred Pierce is an excellent film, pulling you in from the first frame and not letting you go until those two words THE END fade from the screen.
280;Reminiscent of the classic Fred MacMurray/Barbara Stanwyck classic Double Indemnity, the movie keeps you in suspense all the way through, and the final revelation is a real shocker.
281;There are light moments of comedy sprinkled throughout, which are clean, and I won't say anymore, lest I spoil the surprise.
282;forward through the dull bits was a treat.
283;Everything is excellent about this movie, except that I don't like the characters.
284;I most enjoyed the police interrogation scenes.
285;"Correction: actually, I did enjoy the supporting characters: the detectives, Eve Arden, the black maid with the squeaky voice
286;Yes, it's a """"chick flik"""", but it's much more than that."""
287;the real triumph of Mildred Pierce was the script.
288;The original James M. Cain novel was interesting in its own way but unexciting.
289;The device of adding the murder and telling the story in flashbacks is unique to this picture.
290;"the supporting cast is superb: Ann Blythe
291;directed in a slick Film Noir Style by Michael Curtiz (Casablanca).
292;In this instance, unlike in the Crawford bio, the mother Mildred Pierce is pretty much at the mercy of her spoiled daughter Veda.
293;his works translate very well to the screen (for example, """"The Postman Always Rings Twice"""")."""
294;this movie has enough twists and turns for the most discriminating viewer.
295;i was reminded once again that the really good movies entertain.
296;the close experience of the Second World war in a certain way was a crossroad for a huge crowd of directors.
297;Because the story is told so perfectly and the matter in question is so related with everyone of us that all the explored universe of feelings , the proud, the anger and the constance of the main character in a ravishing performance of Mrs. Crawford and the astonishing Anne Blyth, makes that film not only a cult movie but a obligated reference for those who love the art of cinema.
298;There is something surreal about Ms Crawford's life and career and the way they intertwine to make a fascinating but entertaining study.
299;"MILDRED PIERCE the film seems to be a vehicle that Ms Crawford was born to play so uncannily does it seem to mirror her broader experiences 
300;Perhaps, but a terrific melodrama.
301;An excellent and revealing but ultimately sympathetic documentary narrated by Angelica Huston, is included and complements this fine film.
302;What more can be said about this great movie, definitely one of Crawford's best.
303;Great melodrama, and superbly acted by the entire cast.
304;Joan Crawford's turn as the selfless, ambitious single mom is quite convincing, and Ann Blyth's performance as her selfish, spoiled, and unfeeling daughter is truly gut wrenching to watch.
305;Eve Arden is at her scene stealing best as Ida, her restaurant manager.
306;She is truly a joy to watch, and I found myself wishing her role would have been larger.
307;Definitely a worthwhile movie to own for all who love the classics.
308;mildred, like Cora, is a driven woman, bent on commercial success.
309;Crawford rightly earned the Best Actress Oscar for her role as the modern businesswoman, a model of ruthless ambition, making her mark and her way in a traditionally man's world.
310;Mildred Pierce is one of the screen's all.
311;but utter selflessness and altruism that brings down the House of Mildred.
312;like compassion and sacrifice is the one person who holds veto power over her emotions and wallet, her conceited eldest daughter Veda, played by Ann Blyth.
313;She is literally ashamed to face Veda with her workaday persona, and when confronted, makes up a story about being a waitress in order to learn the restaurant business.
314;Mildred Pierce is an all around masterpiece: Ernest Haller's camerawork is classic 1940s noir, but with Jerry Wald's slick production, looks almost five years more modern than its later Warner's counterpart, Howard Hawks' """"The Big Sleep"""" (1946) and looks forward to more great Wald noir with """"Key Largo"""" and """"Dark Passage."""""""
315;Mildred Pierce more than holds its own in the Cain trilogy and is a unique and first.
316;I have seen this movie perhaps 20 times in the last 40 years and still, the impact is there.
317;what an amazing ensemble cast.
318;The beginning is actually the end, but the twists and turns keep you on the edge of your seat.
319;The perennial Joan Crawford delivers an exquisite portrait of an unconditionally devoted mother in this very riveting melodrama.
320;She plays a simple mother that strives to provide the world and its wonders on a gold platter to her daughter, Veda, who turns out spoiled and quite evil.
321;Nevertheless, this is truly a great classic worthy of your attention.
322;To accomplish this, she starts her own business which becomes incredibly successful and she sacrifices herself.
323;Her reward is the most selfish, uncaring, self.
324;centred daughter you'll ever see on the screen.
325;Having said all this, I would still recommend the movie because there is a pretty good mystery in the way the plot is constructed, Eve Arden is great as Joan's wisecracking assistant, and Ann Blyth is excellent (you'll hate her) as Veda, the daughter no one would want.
326;It's a well made movie, and it will probably appeal to a lot of people.
327;Classic movie, well presented, and worth the cost!
328;I loved the story of how a young mother with two children became so successful, but couldn't see clear when it came to the matters of the heart.
329;From start to finish this movie is what classic hollywood is all about a great story,a great plot,and a great cast.
330;this movie was joan crawford at her Academy award winning very best,just an all around great movie if you are a collector(which i am)you have to have this one for your collection folks.
331;I love watching Joan and Bette and Lauren.
332;ish, and noir, and great to watch.
333;Joan Crawford won the Academy Award for Best Actress for this much beloved Michael Curtiz noir film (her first major work for warner's after leaving MGM), but the real reason to see it is Ann Blyth in her great performance as Veda, the monstrously ungrateful daughter.
334;But here she got the role of a lifetime and she never lets it go: usually sugary.
335;This isn't Crawford's best work for Warner's (that would come two years later with POSSESSED), and at times she gives into her habit (as Pauline Kael memorably put it) of looking as if she has toothache when she intends to emote very heavily, but her hairstyle and outfits in this role are iconic, and she's fairly funny when she has to wait tables and issue snappy barking orders to her restaurant's cooks.
336;Lots of fine character actors are about as fun as they ever were in their careers playing some of their most typical roles in this movie: Eve Arden as the heroine's smartmouthed best friend, Zacharty Scott as Mildred's oily lover, Jack Carson as the oafish chump who keeps hitting on Mildred and who gets in trouble for his pains.
337;This is one of the most pleasurable noir films of the period, smartly photographed and expensively staged: it's a real treat.
338;Back at MGM studios, where she had worked for eighteen years, they thought her best performances were behind her when they canned her.
339;Crawford still looks beautiful in this film, a gifted actress at the peak of her talent and body of work.
340;joan Crawford won an Oscar for best actress in a leading role for her part in this film.
341;One of the most iconic and memorable movies from the golden age of Hollywood.
342;I think this has to be the ultimate movie of Joan Crawford's that I've ever loved growing up.
343;"But this is Crawford the Academy Award winner, not the ""Mommie Dearest"" cartoon."
344;Allow for the period and enjoy.
345;"ray it's her defining picture, ""Mildred Pierce."""
346;As soon as it comes out I will be among the first to pre.
347;I ordered it before going to see a live spoof on the movie.
348;This is a classic movie for a reason.
349;I just loved this movie.
350;My mother told me about it quite a few years ago and I finally saw it the other night.
351;What a great story line about a mother's devotion to her children and the evil and greediness from a child.
352;Joan Crawford surely was wonderful in this movie.
353;Here we are treated to Joan in all her gorgeous shoulder.
354;winning performance, but a performance that established a true American icon.
355;In life and in art, Joan will always be one of the true greats.
356;This movie is as good as the James Caine book in every way.
357;The story is compelling and played to perfection by Miss Crawford.
358;Watch it again and also read the book.
359;Both are classics of the finest guality.
360;Crawford resuscitated her fading career with the driven Mildred, a part she was born to play.
361;She gives a great performance in the leading role and definitely deserved to win her Oscar.
362;Watch this classic to see fine acting performances by the whole cast, especially Crawford.
363;Everything in this movie is perfect.
364;If you want to see the biggest spoiled brat daughter in movie history, watch this movie!Crawford went through many incarnations over the years and kept reinventing herself (which is actually a smart thing to do for career survival).
365;She started developing what became her signature look during this time and still looked great.
366;Her drastic change in appearance made her look kind of scary in a way, which got her cast in horror movies, I think.
367;"She developed a ""harder"" look during the '50s, and '60s."
368;In the '20s and '30s she had more of a pleasant, softer, inviting look.
369;I recommend it if you like black and white film noir classics.
370;"sacrificing mother character who works her fingers to the bone for an ungrateful child, ""Mildred Pierce"" is in many ways the quintessential 1940's ""women's picture"" I thought it would be."
371;And it's all based on a classic James M. Cain novel, another happy discovery.
372;These include a terrific collection of trailers of other classic Joan Crawford films, as well as a generous documentary on Ms. Crawford's career, that.
373;I Love Joan Crawford and this was one of her best films ever!
374;I loved her in the women she was a great actress I wish I could have met her!Thanks, Jason
375;She decides that she can make money in the restaurant business since she's been making a profit selling food from home and catering parties.
376;She agrees to pay him back in full within a year.
377;She and Monty start to spend time together and eventually become romantic.
378;The business continues to flourish while her relationship and control with Veda starts to decline.
379;Veda wants more and more from her mother, and will say and do anything to get what she wants.
380;Mildred, in the meantime, takes a vacation and returns resolved to make amends with Veda.
381;She does this solely to appease Veda again and try to gain her love.
382;She has poured everything into pleasing Veda and providing anything she could want, but in the end Veda still wants more.
383;I would rate this film at 4 stars.
384;The original is the best and pulled together some loose ends.
385;Ann Blythe and Eve Arden are excellent supporting actresses as her daughter and friend respectively.
386;goldwyn Mayer, this is the first independent film that Crawford made which won her an Oscar for Best Actress in 1945.
387;This movie is excellent and belongs in the archives of the best pictures made in the mid.
388;Joan Crawford did indeed put forth one of her best performances in this drama.
389;Everyone that watches the movie feels great sorrow for her in the end.
390;series follows the Cain novel closely, but for classic Noir with all its elements, this is a wonderful film.
391;Joan is brilliant, but don't overlook the equally brilliant performance of Anne Blyth, as the world's most horrid daughter.
392;this movie is about Joan's relationship with her children and her climb to be a success because of her children.
393;It's also a great murder mystery.
394;She keeps her job a secret to prevent her self.
395;But Blyth does find out and lets her mother know in one of many successful attempts to humiliate her mother.
396;joan survives and manages to provides for her children.
397;Then Joan forges ahead with even more determination, and makes herself a success, while Blyth continues to, somehow, grow more and more selfish, while Joan tries to keep up with her daughter's greed.
398;Watching Joan build her own successful business is a great part of the movie.
399;Typical Hollywood girl makes good drama.
400;I enjoyed watching this while staying in on a cold Saturday afternoon.
401;Mildred Pierce, the novel, tells the story of the self.
402;Through her honed skills in baking, she makes delightfully tasty cakes and pies, which leads her to the realization that she can become the breadwinner.
403;The cinematic adaptation makes one significant change with the story by changing it from a drama to a thriller, or more precisely to murky genre film.
404;The opening credits emerging across the sand dunes while washed away by the waves of the ocean brought me the notion of life's cyclical pattern.
405;Undoubtedly, the opening smacks the audience with suspense from the first minute, as the perpetrator tosses the gun on top of the rapidly dying man.
406;She steps up on the edge, preparing herself for a plunge when a police office slams the railing with his club.
407;She brushes him off by asking him to leave her alone.
408;Yet, it is within this basic idea, which the films gem rests.
409;They have a long friendship that stem from his affectionate care and interest in her, which has soured over some business deals.
410;Mildred goes into detail to share how her husband was laid.
411;She also shares how she became a successful businesswoman, and how her success continued to grow.
412;Mildred is naturally to blame for Veda's blemishes.
413;mildred Pierce, as a film, employs a brilliant adapted narrative that encourages the audience to contemplate the actions of the main character.
414;It also allows the viewer to contemplate on personal improvement while it provides a fascinatingly dark thriller.
415;The camerawork and the mise.
416;scene help bring out the oppressive and shadowy elements of film noir, which compels the story to feel even more intriguing.
417;On top of this, the cast performs radiantly with Joan Crawford and Ann Blyth providing dazzling performances.
418;Michael Curtiz's direction pulls it all together into a stunningly captivating story that keeps the audience in suspense and questioning the choices of Mildred Pierce.
419;I liked this film a lot more before I read Cain's book, which is subtle and ironic in ways this movie can't match.
420;there are indeed a number of fine performances here.
421;blyth, Arden, and Carson all deliver the goods.
422;"In fact, of the three Cain novels put to film in the '40s, this is the least successful to my eyes and ears
423;Curtiz' fine direction and Steiner's typically solid score lift the film onto a refined plane, and Crawford is in her way perfect here in her many imperfections"
424;Cain's Mildred has so much more intelligence and drive and verve and grace and wit than Crawford can begin to bring to this role, and that made it all feel rather empty for me.
425;"I think in fact that Arden could have done a vastly superior job as Mildred
426;It's a nice little package and must be a delight for huge fans of this film"
427;Though the movie chronicles Mildred's rise to success, spoiled Veda is the motivation and uniquely disturbing character.
428;Mildred is a magnet for lying and cheating intimate friends and family.
429;Though the movie is in black and white, costumes, the cinematography and lighting are spectacular.
430;This is a true classic.
431;"long filmography and documentary reveals her birth name, troubled past, rise to stardom from a dancer through the era of silent films and into the ""talkies,"" her fight to remain relevant in the face of rival stars, immoral life, abuse to her children."
432;She was lovely, amibitious and self sacrificing and only wanted to make something of life and a better life for her children.
433;Mildred Pierce was a good movie.
434;This is probably Joan Crawfords best movie.
435;Its got a great cast and a good story.
436;This was a great movie.
437;If you like classic movies you will love this movie.
438;The original Mildred Pierce is truly a classic.
439;This movie is the finest of its time and class, and Joan Crawford was the best (along with Bette Davis).
440;crawford is a tower of strength in the leading role, and she's given strong support by an exceptional cast, including Blyth (KISMET, THE HELEN MORGAN STORY) as her vicious, mean.
441;Attentive viewers will be amused by some eyebrow.
442;By this stage in his long career, director Michael Curtiz was an old hand at this sort of thing (ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES, CASABLANCA, etc.), and he orchestrates the dramatic highlights with visual aplomb .
443;and the sumptuous production values represent Hollywood craftsmanship at its finest.
444;She plays several types in this film and it works.
445;Though hurt and playing a victim she moves on to be a successful restaurant owner.
446;She is strong and authoritative as the manager of several restaurants.
447;Joan Crawford carries the movie with a standout performance, and the cast as well.
448;What a great cast .
449;Eve Arden with the smart quips, Jack Carsen as likeable know.
450;This is a beautiful, sharp black and white film.
451;I think she won an Academy Award for this.
452;This is one of the best Joan Crawford movies and is terrific to boot.
453;The daughter constantly rejects her and Mildred gives her just about anything she wants including the girl's choice of stepfather.
454;A great woman's part and Joan is terrific in it.
455;Trumps many of her movies at MGM A treat.
456;I always greatly loved this film, even if it is really a terribly sad thing.
457;but even if the beginning seems borrowed from this genre, this is in fact a very powerful .
458;and surprisingly feminist in the best meaning of this term .
459;This is the life story of a woman who in her young years was happy, cheerful and trusting .
460;But far from succumbing she rose again and with courage, wits and iron will she towered over lesser people .
461;Therefore it is hardly surprising, that this story is very powerful .
462;Eve Arden is brilliant as her best friend Ida Corwin, a tough and cynical but very brilliant and ultimately rather likeable gal.
463;i was also delighted to see (and especially HEAR!)
464;"she is here as delightful as in ""Gone with the wind"", where she portrayed Prissy, the harebrained Scarlett's servant."
465;those 33 years of experience are well visible on the screen as not only the actors are led with great mastery but the scenery is also magnificent .
466;I was particularly impressed by his vision of the police station which in some scenes in this film seems almost to be an ancient temple, where truth will finally by established and justice served.
467;I loved Joan Crawford in this film.
468;Joan Crawford was one the the best actresses during her time of acting.
469;This is Joan Crawford at her best in a thoroughly entertaining film.
470;Not only can you see a fabulously restored copy of Joan Crawford's Academy Award winning performance as Mildred Pierce, you also receive the wonderful TCM documentary Joan Crawford, the Ultimate Star The documentary is a in.
471;Featuring interviews and rare footage, it tells a vivid, and poignant story of her life.
472;She even won her only Oscar for it.
473;When she finally throws her husband out, she gets a job as a waitress.
474;Mildred finally learns the restaurant business thanks to her friend.
475;She can now have Mother all to herself and milk her for every cent she has.
476;riches dames Crawford ever played this is the ultimate.
477;James M. Cains' novel had to be toned down for the screen but it still ranks as classic film noir and very sticky soap opera.
478;Ann Blyth is mightily impressive as the evil Veda and matches Crawford scene for scene through all their confrontations.
479;The film is a must see for Crawford, Blyth and the wonderful Eve Arden.
480;You know she had to love it as much as we do.
481;If you are a classic movie lover, you will love Mildred Pierce.
482;It is full of suspense and keeps you guessing.
483;Joan Crawford is great in this movie, it is one that you could watch periodically and still enjoy.
484;Her early career was full of singing and dancing, rarely showing the edginess that came to mark her later films.
485;Before she was forced to leave MGM, most often she played roles that demonstrated a lighter touch.
486;like Veda, she succeeds in coming across as the fun.
487;Veda and Mildred's new husband are the perfect pair: flashy on the outside, empty on the inside, and determined to climb the ladder of success on the other's respective back.
488;It also resides in the way the supporting cast bounces off each other at just the right pitch and the right moment.
489;"Joan morphs into Mildred and the magic of success overcomes both as this film was the one that established Ms. Crawford as ""the real thing"" when she portrays a woman driven by the effects of a difficult childhood into a greedy manipulative woman who due to instinctive insecutity finds achieving happiness a constant challenge."
490;But Mildred Pierce is a true classic in every sense of the word: great story, great acting, wonderful characters, and getting to see Joan Crawford and Ann Blyth trade slaps.
491;Joan is truly at her best here and, with director Michael Curtiz putting a muzzle on her, keeps her overacting to a minimum.
492;class documentary about Joan Crawford's wacky rise to stardom.
493;This movie is truly one of the finest made in the history of American cinema.
494;Mildred then tells that within a while, she becomes an excellent waitress, and is so successful, she ends up opening up a chain of her own eateries.
495;i feel that this movie is one that must be in everyone's movie library.
496;The flip side of the disc contains the documentary about Joan, which is excellent to see.
497;Pick this classic up while you still can.
498;It reflected how a single woman, tries to raise two daughters and give them everything she didn't have.
499;Thus, the viewer must listen and watch intently.
500;One of Joan Crawford's best movies.
501;This melodramatic film noir is one of the most decorated films of the genre, nominated for 6 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and winner of the Best Actress Oscar for Joan Crawford's portrayal of the title character.
502;She is taken to the police station, where she recounts the events of the past few years to an investigating officer.
503;We see, in flashback, her split from her first husband, her preoccupation with providing an aristocratic lifestyle for her eldest daughter, her business success, and eventual marriage to her now.
504;Crawford's depiction of Pierce's ambition and pathological indulgence of her spoiled, selfish daughter Veda (Ann Blyth) is extraordinary.
505;She makes Mildred Pierce one of the most thoroughly captivating characters ever to grace the screen.
506;Crawford's performance is so fascinating that it might be easy to overlook the film's supporting performances.
507;"Truly exceptional performances, writing, and direction by Michael Curtiz (of ""Casablanca"" fame) make ""Mildred Pierce"" a must."
508;It includes interviews with historians, friends and family.
509;It's one of our favorites!
510;This is a great film, I love Joan Crawford in it.
511;This movie is definitely worth the watch, so watch it!
512;joan Crawford deserves the Oscar Award that she won for this 1945 film.
513;Packaging was fine and it arrived earlier than I had anticipated.
514;This movie is a classic and I had never seen it.
515;No wonder it won so many awards.
516;If you'venever seen this movie, I recommend it.
517;It's got twists and turns that you don'tsee coming.
518;AND I love a good juicy story with drama and unexpected plot twists.
519;way point, the enjoyment in the film comes with how the story plays out and exactly who does what to get to the end and what the consequences are.
520;Crawford definitely deserved the Academy Award that she won for this role.
521;acted and has a sharp and well.
522;wonderful portrayal of MILDRED PIERCE.
523;She acts all over the place, earning that Oscar, scene by sumptuous scene!
524;know about the making of this great picture.
525;Joan's status as a film legend and icon is well deserved and if you need to know why, watch this film.
526;She also took home the Best Actress Oscar for this flick.
527;About the transfer: Warner has taken great pains to restore both the picture and sound elements and their attention to detail shows.
528;The visuals are glorious, sharp and in pristine condition.
529;Close ups reveal actor's make up and fine detail in the fabric of their costumes .
530;the transfer is that good!
531;Included on side two is a heartbreaking documentary about the star that perhaps reveals more than one side to Mommy Dearest .
532;Clearly Joan was not mother of the year but she was a marvelous actress and a great talent.
533;class woman who dreams and schemes of attaining a higher status in life for her children.
534;But it still makes for great, sleazy, melodrama.
535;I also enjoyed the performance by Eve Arden, as Mildred's friend and partner in the restaurants.
536;An excellent classic movie with good old fashion acting without all the expletives that the movies of today have.
537;Excellent transaction and received it as promised.
538;this is a fasinating soao opera style movie with some brilliant acting, the leads are overshadowed by crawfords maternal airness yet brewing below confidence and courage.
539;Her spoiled daught is terrific and mildreds friend and co. worker is perfectly comical, on her hate hate hate attitude towards men, look as she goes to bite mildreds banker!!!
540;this was the only oscar (and well deserved) for Crawford, as well as being nominated for 5 other awards, including best picture and two best supporting actresses.
541;Everything of human triumph and tragedy, the essence of the life experience, comes out here, very believably.
542;America's artistic tapestry is the richer for having her acting woven into it.
543;Watch this movie some evening when you damned well deserve the best the silver screen has to offer (and when distractions will be minimal.)
544;She deserved to win the OSCAR for her role as the long suffering wife and mother who does everything she can to better her life so she can provide her evil seed daughter, played beautifully by Ann BLyth, to a better life.
545;She actually underplays alot of her scenes.
546;Eve Arden is her usual wonderfully sassy sidekick.
547;Her lines are so witty and quoteable.
548;I wish I had seen it years ago!
549;It is a great movie.
550;Mildred Pierce is a credit to Joan Crawford's talent and a definite must see!
551;Joan was awarded an Oscar in 1945 for her portrayal of Mildred Pierce, a woman consumed with making her daughters happy, no matter the cost.
552;Michael Curtiz demonstrates Casablanca was not his last masterpiece, doing an outstanding job directing this Warner Brothers film.
553;Soon she can afford piano and dance lessons for Veda and Kay, all the while keeping her place of employment a secret from the girls because she fears Veda's reaction.
554;Mildred's is such a success she soon opens a chain of them.
555;She has made it and Veda will finally be happy!
556;Now she has an even bigger and better home with nice new furnishings.
557;Surely this will satisfy her daughter!
558;i truly enjoyed Mildred Pierce , a film that transports the audience to a world decades in the past.
559;Enjoy this movie every time I watch it.
560;Nothing beats this original classic!
561;placed Mother's love will take you.
562;Curtiz was a genious to realize that you have something unique when you figure out how magnificent and wide Joan Crawford's heartbreak can be when she gets to suffer in deep.
563;Simply, Curtiz uses his leading lady to perhaps her greatest effect.
564;"Her ""Mildred"" is the lumber and nails of this production."
565;Together they chew some of the greatest dialogue ever afforded any actress.
566;Mildred Pierce is a cinematic artichoke with witty, biting and clever layers yielding to a diseased heart of unrequited paternal love.
567;She was already considered a has.
568;been and had been dumped by Mayer's studio and so it was quite a triumph when she won a best actress Oscar for this film.
569;And well deserved it was.
570;It's a great film about a powerful, but flawed woman/mother and what she does to keep her life and her daughters' lives bearable.
571;One of the top 100 films ever, in my opinion, both for the performance and the story it tells.
572;the film is very well paced.
573;The director and actors knew when to linger over interesting parts, and when to move things along.
574;"some good morals to the story about spoiling children
575;There are a lot of people in this film without speaking parts (extras)"
576;There are some things a mother wants and believes she will receive if she is a good mother: to be loved, respected, admired, and appreciated by their daughter.
577;Joan Crawford is nothing short of remarkable, and, for once, the director and producers have done the smart thing and extracted an understated and beautifully.
578;shot performance from La Crawford.
579;The supporting cast, in particular Eve Arden, are a treat, and Max Stein's score is, by now, legendary.
580;minute documentary on Joan which is one of the best movie.
581;It explores all aspects of Joan's life, from the heady flapper years to the alleged child.
582;This was a great film, fast delivery.
583;"The Festival is presenting 18 movies over a two week period, including ""Mildred Pierce"" the 1945 film starring Joan Crawford."
584;Crawford received the Academy Award for best actress for her portrayal of the title character.
585;With the movie and HBO adaptation, Cain's novel gained additional attention.
586;I think the book is an important work of American literature, as evidenced, among other ways, by the adaptations.
587;His novel, Mildred Pierce, is unique in the noir genre because its primary character is a woman and because the emphasis of the book is on understanding a complex individual.
588;Mildred is brought in for questioning and relates her story to the detective in the process of finding the murderer.
589;It is something of a tear jerker in addition to noir.
590;this is still an outstanding movie faithful in broad outline to Cain's book.
591;In its portrayal of Depression era Los Angeles, the movie captures a great deal of the spirit of noir.
592;The black and white photography and the shaded lighting add a great deal to the tension of the film.
593;Mildred is admirable for her hard work and self.
594;She is smart, ambitious, and driven, qualities respected and rewarded in the American ethic.
595;I was grateful to see this movie as part of a noir retrospective in a beautiful theater where it rightfully belongs.
596;Good to have this movie in my collection.
597;Acting is superb all the way around, especially Crawford, Blythe, Arden, Scott, and Carson.
598;Crawford won the oscar that year for best actress.
599;MILDRED PIERCE is a classic film noir with exceptionally fine performances.
600;Joan plays the title role with such dedicated conviction that you feel both angry and empathetic for her character: her daughter Veda (Ann Blyth) has got to be the most ungrateful daughter of all time!
601;Crawford plays the valiant, hardworking, ambitious Mildred who eventually owns a chain of successful restaurants (with the help of a ne'er.
602;well playboy by the name of Monte Berrigan (the unique Zachary Scott).
603;"P. s. I find it rather amusing that a tune heard on the radio during a key love scene comes from a Bette Davis picture: IT CAN'T BE WRONG from NOW, VOYAGER
604;I watched this movie book on a recommendation from a friend.
605;She hears me talk of some things and she thought I could relate.
606;But at least Eve Arden's character is good for a few laughs.
607;It's nice to know one can sometimes start out all over again.
608;This is a great old classic.
609;I've seen it many times and enjoy it every time I watch it.
610;crawford won a richly deserved Oscar for her turn here and no matter how many times you watch this film, you are bound to be impressed by her.
611;Her acting is subtle, superb and her emotions seem genuine and heartfelt.
612;Eve Arden gives comic relief with her witty repartee and Michael Curtiz gets the best performances out of each and every member of the cast.
613;I first saw this film when I was a kid, and I loved it then.
614;Great screenplay, superb characters, well directed.
615;my husband and I really enjoyed the Winslet version, but the original is indeed a good period piece if you like Joan Crawford films.
616;This amazing film holds up unbelievable well.
617;I found myself drawn into the movie as if it were in the theatres now.
618;the transfer is bight and crisp.
619;The other side of this disc is a complete documentary of her life.
620;I mean a complete documentary it's worth.
621;well, it worth more than the movie itself if that's possible.
622;I ordered this movie after seeing """"Mommie Dearest"""", which I would also recommend."""
623;"It has a very interesting story line, particularly in light of the ""Mommie Dearest"" shadow on her relationship with her own adopted daughter."
624;"In the end I would call it a true glimpse of the previous generations' ""chick flick""."
625;This is a story of a very strong willed woman named Mildred Pierce, played very well by Joan Crawford, who decides that she no longer needs her husband to raise her two daughters.

631;I give this film a four out of five stars due to the excellent story and the actors that the director picked for each part seemed perfect.
632;I guess along with better special effects we have also evolved with our acting skills.
633;Joan Crawford is the greatest.
634;Combine her talents with a great script, Michael Curtiz, and a nice supporting cast .
635;and will continue to influence countless film.

638;Always recommend it to friends!
639;thus challenging male power on its two most cherished fronts).
640;An interesting, not always comfortable, blending of 2 distinct genres, `Mildred Pierce` is carried through by the superb performances of its leading cast and some bravura directorial touches, particularly in the Noir sections of the film.
641;winning comeback from being labeled Box Office Poison as exquisitely chronicled in Mommie Dearest, Mildred Pierce is a fine jewel in a noir setting.
642;Alligators have the right idea.

650;"He told her, ""I love you baby.you've got the part""."
651;Mildred Pierce is one of the best films from the 1940's, soap operish at best, but flawless in its cinematography and performances.
652;It's also one of the best in the film noir series that shows a lot of shadows in its scenes, a common occurrence in french films that was brought to American movie making.
653;There are also a series of neat trailers from Joan's Warner Brother's films.
654;Joan Crawford as always plays a fantastic part.

658;"*** This review may contain spoilers ***For those who believe that films must remain 'faithful' to their source material should take a look at the original 1945 film version of 'Mildred Pierce'
659;There's actually no comparison: the 1945 version is wholly entertaining while the recent adaptation will bore you to tears.
660;It's these neat little scenes that add to the overall verisimilitude of the plot.
661;Ann Blyth is brilliant, making the most of the chief supporting players' part, as the evil Veda.
662;Still, Veda's exaggerated (and escalating) misbehavior is what makes the film so enjoyable (there is a catharsis of sorts as the audience gets to 'hiss the villain').
663;The scene is a bit drawn out but provides an explanation for Mildred's continuing attachment to Veda.
664;Meanwhile, Mildred finds success in the restaurant business by opening up a chain of restaurants.
665;Should I mention that Mildred's former supervisor Ida (deliciously played by Eve Arden) is the comic relief with her sassy comments about men.
666;despite the minor pitfalls, 'Mildred Pierce' remains a highly entertaining part noir, part soap opera, that manages to thrill audiences even to this day.
667;Now I can watch one of my favorites anytime I want.
668;It is awesome to watch without having to tivo it to watch.
669;She begins by making pies for neighbors for extra money and struggles as a waitress in a busy downtown Los Angeles restaurant, but soon she scores a breakthrough and starts her own eaterie, which soon develops into a successful chain.
670;A flashback brings the story into the present, revealing the interesting array of characters who inhabit Mildred's life.
671;Eventually she will become romantically involved with Scott and ultimately marries him to satisfy Blyth, a social climber impressed with Scott's pedigree.
672;supplying wisecracking comments throughout is the inimitable Eve Arden, who serves as Crawford's Woman Friday in her restaurant operation.
673;It is Arden who delivers the brilliant script's premiere line when she tartly asserts, """"Veda (Blyth) is living proof that alligators have the right idea."""
674;The film succeeds brilliantly into taking viewers inside the intricate world of a whole constellation of uniquely fascinating characters.
675;The action moves throughout at a brisk pace, reflective of the brilliant Hungarian director Michael Curtiz.
676;, heaps of Crawford trailers for her other movies and also some snapshots of Awards she received for the film.
677;well, it might be worth something in years to come because of this error!
