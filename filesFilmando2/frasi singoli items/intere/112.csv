id;spiegazione
1;Astonishing film from director Michael Powell.
2;carl Boehm delivers a marvellous performance as the troubled photographer giving us a unique insight into the mind of a misanthrope.
3;the transfer by Criterion is quite stunning.
4;Better than most from the era.
5;This movie is about a guy who carries a camera with him everywhere he goes.
6;He also has some unresolved childhood issues.
7;Viewed: 10/12Rate: 910/12: Peeping Tom is an interesting study of voyeurism, but it's not what we really define a real peeping Tom.
8;The idea of the breeding of the freakish traits in him while as a child is probably the most fascinating part of the film.
9;Karlheinz Bhm displays a good, if unconventional, piece of acting.
10;He makes the movie to work.
11;The blind mother, yeah right.
12;The English cinematography is well done.
13;All in all, Peeping Tom is actually the kind of a film Alfred Hitchcock could have directed, but kudos to Michael Powell.
14;boehm gives a performance which is simultaneously naive and frightening.Years ahead of its time, PEEPING TOM remains one of the most chilling British films ever lensed.
15;This pioneering movie is still of interest to horror fans and movie buffs.
16;He's a quiet, seemingly innocent film.
17;While not so shocking today, it still manages to pose some questions about the relationship between movies and their audience.
18;Much of the rest of the symbolism is very heavy.
19;He had a bit part in several James Bond films.
20;I think it is a brilliant psychological thriller.
21;Mark is a great character.
22;I think Peeping Tom was very well ploted, acted, directed and scripted.
23;Virtually nothing about it is captivating.
24;He also hides a dark secret
25;Mark's neighbour Helen (Anna Massey) strikes up a friendship with him, but could her life also be in danger?PEEPING TOM, filmed in glorious blazing Technicolor, is filled with intriguing performances and lots of underlying subtext.
26;Bohm is mesmerizing to watch as the conflicted and tortured Mark, especially when his relationship with the Anna Massey character starts to bloom and he begins to start walking away from his dark and murderous desires.
27;joseph in the beloved Sissi trilogy.
28;Shearer always looked very lovely in Technicolor with her flaming red hair.
29;It has been widely publicized that Michael Powell's PEEPING TOM rivals the masterful filming techniques of the great Alfred Hitchcock, and rightly so.
30;Its characters are brilliantly written and set into play in an imperfect world with a seedy underbelly.
31;Bohm's portrayal of Mark is only slightly offsetting, generally exhibiting a calm and disarming persona, but with very subtle cracks where he compulsively obsesses over his camera and folds when confronted with the truth.
32;What makes the film so uniquely interesting is how the themes of voyeurism infiltrate every aspect of the script.
33;Even the police keep a hidden and watchful eye on our killer, and Vivian finds herself compelled to sneak into Mark's apartment to play the reels which he holds so close to him.
34;I never expect to enjoy or understand the works of the early masters, but PEEPING TOM is just as relevant, darkly genius, and compelling as it was upon its release in 1960.
35;Put this high on the priorities list, this is Horror at its best.
36;His equally innovative, and at the same time most notorious film is the brilliantly perverse PEEPING TOM (1960).
37;Released just a few months before Alfred Hitchcock's similar PSYCHO, Powell's thriller is one of the first, and still considered one of the best to explore the motivations of a psychopath's mind.
38;carl Boehm is superb as the seriously disturbed young man, Mark, and manages to gain our sympathy despite the horrible acts he commits.
39;This is surprising for a color movie, in which the redness of blood could have been exploited the way it was beginning to in Britain's Hammer horror productions of that period.
40;popping color photography is one of PEEPING TOM's enduring strengths giving it the look of a seedy, pulp novel's cover come to life.
41;A film far ahead of its time, PEEPING TOM has steadily gained its worthy reputation as an offbeat, underground classic which, despite its lurid subject matter, exudes a genuine sensitivity.
42;Transferred off a gorgeous 35mm print, the image is razor sharp with beautiful color density and saturation.
43;a disturbing, compelling masterpiece about the sometimes obsessive power of movies, PEEPING TOM is definitely worth a good, long look.
44;This is quite an intriguing story, hailed by critics as the British equivalent of Hitchcock's Psycho.
45;Both would make an outstanding double feature on a stormy night.
46;Martin Scorcese claimed this is one of the greatest films depicting the mechanics of directing.
47;it's the story of Mark, who works behind the scenes at the film studio.
48;He has a strange fascination with the camera, which stems from his childhood.
49;His father had an incessant passion, actually a sadistic passion, with capturing every aspect of his son's life on tape.
50;His dad also enjoyed catching the reactions of the nervous system to fear, especially in children.
51;one thing I really enjoyed about this film was the psychological process the filmmaker uses to accomplish their goals with the actor or actress.
52;I remember hearing about John Singleton making his debut film, Boyz.
53;Silly b#$%ch, wait til he pulls the knife out and we'll see some Oscar worthy acting.
54;peeping Tom is just plain brilliant filmmaking, no doubt about it.
55;As a fan of the Criterion Collection, I was intrigued by the premise of Peeping Tom.
56;the film is bathed in 60's Technicolor, and Criterion's got this one looking delicious.
57;It's as if Michael Powell wanted all the colors as pronounced and accentuated as possible, to give each aspect of each shot the ability to stand on its own.
58;Like The Silence Of The Lambs, it's more of a psychological profiler.
59;That much is made clear to us when we view the movies he presents to Anna Massey in his upstairs screening room: he's been the lifelong subject of his father's experiments on the human reaction to fear.
60;Also included is a fascinating Channel 4 UK documentary providing insight on the life of screenwriter Leo Marks.
61;If you're into films about film, PT presents an interesting and risqu slant on the topic.
62;But if you're into chilling, thought.
63;provoking psychodrama presented in 60's Technicolor, Peeping Tom is one to check out.
64;It gives him a sexual rush to see the fear in their eyes when they realize they are going to be killed.
65;moments, but rather it works on a more cerebral level, letting the audience into the twisted mind of a killer.
66;Peeping Tom has been an incredibly influential film for today's filmmakers, as its influences can be seen in films from Road to Perdition to Red Dragon.
67;I highly recommend it to any fan of film and film history.
68;As you watch Peeping Tom you become a voyeur participant in what he is doing.
69;He finds within himself an attraction that might be love, might be salvation, but which is conflicted.
70;rate actress and in this role she is excellent.
71;She eventually realizes something is wrong with Lewis, but still wants to give him love and help.
72;as usual with Criterion, the film looks great and the extras are worth watching.
73;The extra about Peeping Tom's writer, Leo Marks, is fascinating.
74;But it is still both disturbing and entertaining.
75;He has a secret life as well.
76;But he also has an even bigger secret.
77;his scientist father filmed him constantly while he grew up and subjected him to terror experiments, obsessing the boy with the effects of fear and how photography can capture life, even when it can no longer be lived normally.
78;It's amazing to a modern audience that this could so upset viewers back in 1960.
79;This is strong stuff, especially in the context of the time in which it was made and well worth catching for horror buffs.
80;the concept of the movie is the real winner.
81;Keep an open mind and remember.
82;it is a movie for entertainment!
83;_Peeping Tom_ is a shockingly original film that deals with themes of voyeurism, fear, and childhood trauma in a unique and interesting way.
84;The opening shot reveals the hand.
85;I particularly enjoyed the film.
86;another aspect of this film that sets it apart from many thriller films is the amount of psychological complexity and character that we are treated to.
87;Boehm plays the character splendidly and truly breathes life into the character of an emotionally unstable man with a vivid sense of his own troubles.
88;on top of everything, I enjoyed the way that piano music was woven into the film and I really liked the entire soundtrack.
89;Finally, the ending of the film is absolutely tremendous, weird, and indescribable.
90;the same two reasons I found the film compelling.
91;Well, it isn't the 1960s anymore and you should definitely give this film a look.
92;The best I can say here is that Powell is still a master of color.
93;His use of the color red is interesting, particularly in a horror film where not a drop of blood is spilled.
94;It was also nice to see Moira Shearer in an extended cameo doing an interesting Latin dance.
95;In a day and age where the importance of film in our society grows in leaps and bounds everyday, Michael Powell's devastating and completely unforgettable Peeping Tom levels the most convincing argument that we don't just watch films.
96;When the boy grows up, he carries on his father's work.
97;He decides that the greatest fear experienced comes at the point of death.
98;He also (in a move Hitchcock would envy) forces them to watch their own frightened faces with a small mirror attached to the front of the camera.
99;We see what he sees while filming them, while watching his footage at home, we are (very eerily) immersed into his film.
100;We are right beside him, watching his victims and relishing in their terror.
101;But when she walks into the next room, he places his lips onto the lense of the camera and a look of pure passion crosses his face.
102;It is a film about film and about the experience of a moviegoer.
103;Like Hitchcock's Rear Window it is a truly exhilarating and unnerving experience about sitting in a theater and not only watching what is going on, but living it.
104;in viewing the film you understand the British critics of the time.
105;Its themes go well beyond this simplistic rationalization and are a closer relation to the contemporary films 8mm and Thesis.
106;It is a credit to the younger directors of the 1980's that this filmed was found, restored and is now appreciated for the masterpiece it is.
107;criterion has done a superb job with the original film and the extras add immensely to the appreciation of it.
108;Peeping Tom, which famously opened and closed the same week in Great Britain, proves to be quite a prescient work.
109;Mark's little indie film project concerns a subject he is quite intimate with.
110;a string of unsolved murders, all involving sexually alluring young women.
111;some of us are deliriously happy just to finally get to SEE, much less own, an existing print of this legendary film, period!)
112;, and also features an interesting 1997 BBC documentary about the movie.
113;see for film noir fans and cult movie conisseurs.
114;This film is much debated among British Film enthusiasts, mainly because there's so much in it.
115;This works on more than one level.
116;The film also shows London of the period to good effect.
117;There are good performances all round, but Moira Shearer's portrait of terror stands out.
118;provoking film, fascinating to watch, and very underrated.
119;It may be made in '62 but it's a film with two feet set in the '50s.
120;our villain latches onto our heroine as a mother figure ,which is clearly indicated because he tells her she has moved into his mother's old room.
121;it is amusing that this film is so straight it won't show a drunk woman.
122;The characters in Peeping Tom are more believable than the puppets Hitchcock moves around to create his pure cinema.
123;Sometimes it's sunny and you expect to see mods and rockers on the street.
124;He speaks fluent English, but with a definite German accent.
125;of the subject a little: Peeping Tom is interesting linguistically.
126;How dare they expect us to be glad for the Germans and their economic miracle when we had food rationing for years after the war we won.
127;It is breathtaking combination of voyeurism, eroticism, and horror.
128;Peeping Tom is provocative and very unsettling.
129;The serial killer, a young, shy, attractive and sympathetic man is a victim himself.
130;Powell himself played the father and his young son played young Mark Lewis.
131;I think it also added to the initial shock when the movie was released.
132;Peeping Tom is also the movie about making movies.
133;Mark works as a camera assistant for a film director and dreams about becoming a famous director one day.
134;I can understand the controversy of the subject but how could the sheer brilliance of film.
135;the choice of music, the work of camera, the acting, the dark humor (the guy who looked like Hitchcock was darkly.
136;The resulting movie is strangely layered voyerism: we are made to know we are watching a film about a film about a film and so on
137;The killer, played by handsome young Carl Boehm, is also treated sympathetically, and given the period in which the film was made and released the combination was enough to raise every moral hackle imaginable.
138;Even so, the film developed a mystique, and today many filmmakers and critics, including Sorceses, regard it as an extremely fine film.
139;It certainly has been influential, and whenever film about film about film occurs the title PEEPING TOP is sure to be mentioned.
140;The Criterion edition includes an interesting documentary on writer Leo Marks, a nice commentary, and restores the cuts as much as possible.
141;The visual and sound elements are very good.
142;Its kinda important to the story by revealing his compulsion to kill was uncontrollable.
143;Peeping Tom is a very interesting movie, however it is not for all tastes.
144;Although I recommend that you see it before purchasing it, I recommend that everyone should at least give it a try.
145;Criterion has put together a very good collection of special features for this film, including an interesting documentary, A Very British Psycho.
146;With respect to the reviewer below, I think this masterpiece hits deeper than he has given it credit for.
147;instead, this is a philosophical film, a piece of visual literature that peels off in layers the more you think and the deeper you look.
148;this is a film that reveals a dark side not only to cinema, but to human nature as well.
149;This is a film that carries us through the veiwfinder as we watch a filmmaker get off on violence through the viewfinder.
150;And we enjoy watching him enjoy it.
151;By creating fear, he creates an adrenaline rush in the audience, which is slightly thrilling and immensely profitable.
152;michael Powell, who before directing Peeping Tom had created some of the lushest works of art in the history of cinema, was way ahead of his time with this one.
153;This film will trouble you, as well it should.
154;This one will make you rethink violence and it's place in cinema, and cinema and its place in the world.
155;If you enjoyed A History of Violence, then you will appreciate this unforgettable classic as well.
156;the use of the camera and the script opened the gate to a new world of young directors who still are influenced by this film forty four years after.
157;this film is a cult movie and undoubtedly a film ahead its own time .
158;powell reminds us that Peeping Tom are us too, the viewers every time we seat in front of the screen.
159;When British director Michael Powell and screenwriter Leo Marks collaborated on the 1960 film Peeping Tom, the two really thought they had something special.
160;Well, I wouldn't go that far, but the movie is intriguing considering the date of its release (1960) and the subject matter it fearlessly tackles.
161;He is a Peeping Tom, always gazing into windows or using his camera to spy on the intimate details of other people's lives.
162;At some point in the proceedings, young Mark equated women with his terror fits, and as a full grown man he has decided to conduct his own amateur experiments.
163;In fact, Lewis takes such a shine to Helen that the mere idea of photographing her.
164;No one wants to feel for a murderer of young women, but Powell's movie often gives Boehm's character endearing traits.
165;He gives her this gift not as a means for tricking her into a situation where he can victimize her, but because he likes her, respects her, and wants her to be happy.
166;He captures perfectly the concept of a scared, tormented little boy wrapped in a man's body.
167;Hats off to Criterion as well
168;What you will find is a colorful, quiet movie about a very disturbed young man looking for a way out of his personal darkness.
169;If you want a good suspense film then watch Wait Until Dark.
170;Powell and his son Columba (Bumba) appear in a black/white sequence of the film to good effect.
171;the excellent Supplement, A Very British Psycho (50 mins, 1997), contains of course the hindsights of a number of critics.
172;A cryptography genius, he recounts his activities in British service during WWII.
173;They included writing a unique poem for each agent to memorize for application in encrypting messages.
174;Leo Marks had the voice and aura of a great actor, and indeed was the voice of the Devil in Scorsese's Last Temptation of Christ.
175;Admittedly, all this is quite tangential to Peeping Tom, but makes the Supplement a gem in its own right.
176;Peeping Tom is one of the Criterion Collection's best kept secrets, it seems.
177;i can't remember the last time I saw a psychological study as refined, beautiful, and disturbing as this one.
178;outwardly it is the tale of a youthful killer, Mark Lewis, an unnaturally intense photographer in his spare time and assistant director/cameramanin his daily life.
179;The paradox of this bizarre character is so well done that we can't help but sympathize with him even while he claims victim after victim, recording their facial expressions as they die and adding each one to his documentary.
180;mark takes his father's work one step farther.
181;The paradox of his character is absolutely believable and all the more heartwrenching for it.
182;The ending is a tragedy and comes off that way perfectly.
183;Like many Hitchcock films, we see the inner working and reasoning of a serial killer in such a way as to understand his motivations, and Carl Boehm gives an excellent and subtle personal portrayal of a soul tormented by his own desires.
184;But when you have Moira Shearer giving possibly her best performance, lively and humorous, as one of the murder victims, you have something special, and something deeper.
185;Anna Massey as the spinsterish girl who discovers it all is inspired casting.
186;the purveyors to the public
187;this was also an extremely strong indictment of the idea of casting non.
188;Powell's film uncannily makes the subtle point that a good actor can do a better job with half the effort.
189;in studying human emotions as a subject .
190;Brilliant, and still deeply relevant.
191;Beautifully shot and expertly crafted.
192;Released the same year as Psycho and offering many parallels, it's mystifying that Hitchcock's film was a hit, Powell's a fiasco.
193;A subtly perverse treat for horror and thriller devotees.
194;I want to add my kudos to Criterion for creating a great presentation of a very memorable and provocative film.
195;Thanks to the commentary track by Laura Mulvey and the documentary about Leo Marks included by Criterion, I fully appreciate the subtlety and intellectual depth contained in this film.
196;I'm watching the end of this movie right now, and I can honestly say it stinks!
197;No amount of words can possibly describe the experience you will have with this film upon first viewing.
198;Stop reading reviews and stop ruining the experience: it's worth it.
199;Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) works as an assistant cameraman at a film studio and has trouble appreciating the difference between the real world and what he sees through the lens of a camera.
200;Ultimately, the psychological dimensions of Peeping Tom outweigh the thriller elements and are what make this a noteworthy film.
201;Part of it is that Powell is working in technicolor, with rich colors which work against the horror elements in the film.
202;The primary fear always has been one: the fear of having fear.
203;The movie is a history of this awareness.
204;this movie is a very good film and shows a deep meditation about cinema and fear.
205;He uses a weapon in his tripod to murder women.
206;The reaction by the British critics caused Michael Powell's career to be derailed and criticized for years.
207;They generally considered it to be unworthy of British Cinema and an impolite topic to have been brought to the screen.
208;The extras are very insightful and well worth viewing and listening to.
209;See the trailer before the film and you'll be hooked.
210;If you have never seen Peeping Tom you're in for a very pleasant surprise.
211;This is a cult film that fully lives up to its reputation.
212;It is an exciting, well.
213;Admirers of Hitchcock, especially of his Psycho (released later the same year, 1960) will find many points of comparison.
214;Every aspect of this release is absolutely top.
215;The film transfer is beautifully clear and looks almost new.
216;As for extras, this release is a total knockout: the audio commentary by critic Laura Mulvey is detailed and easy to follow
217;minute documentary A Very British Psycho is so fascinating it can't really be summed up here
218;Peeping Tom should be required viewing for all interested in the possibilities of this art form.
219;The film itself is a fine and daring piece of work detailing the obsession and madness of a young photographer who was horrendously traumatized as a child by his equally obsessed father.
220;He then views the footage in private for self gratification.
221;He's literally making his own pornography.
222;This movie is a heavy statement by a renowned filmmaker who literally put his career on the line to make it.
223;But today, the film survives as a testament to Powell's viewpoint and ideas.
224;And we are the richer for it.
225;For those who do get it , it is a rare treat indeed.
226;Little slower than modern thriller, but well worth the watch!
227;The color scheme, the subject matter, the sexy women .
228;everything those great paperback covers of the fifties offered is delivered bigger than life in this great film.
229;mad and passed his gens to a son murdering himself to a very relief of authorities and society.
230;you are a true fan of film.
231;i guess you can call this a classic, only because of it's age.
232;it is however a decent story that could have been much more.
233;Though it's only 101 min long, there's a ton of material packed in.
234;Together, these two films pioneered the audience incrimination techniques, as well as the archetypal charming, quiet, young man as serial killer that has since become a staple of the genre.
235;You must see this film, and if you do, this is the edition to see.
236;As always (or at least since about Spine No. 50 of the first editions), The Criterion Collection and Janus Films have supervised their own brilliant restoration and transfer of the film.
237;It preserves the original (and slightly exotic) aspect ratio of 1.66:1 and looks marvelous.
238;Of course, as always with the Criterion Collection, the special features are top notch as well, although there could be more.
239;This is just about perfect.
240;pros:+ A great film by a great director.
241;By the Criterion Collection's standards, there are very few special features here.
242;Nobody ever said art had to be in good taste.
243;The best artists have always been insane.
244;I expect they would be nudging and winking at each other enjoying the subtle in.
245;Great artists are always misunderstood.
246;And he's a great actors director, knowing how elicit extreme fear from his actresses, even non.
247;oh well, a small price for the perfect shot.
248;I found it a very striking film, which explores .
249;the voyeur that is, to some extent, in all of us.
250;This opening scene sets the tone for most of the rest of the film, a feeling of seedy desperation.
251;but Mark wants to take his fathers work one step forward, not only is he obsessed with `fear', but he is consumed with the idea of seeing it, of capturing the face of fear with his camera, as if somehow that will bring him the ultimate understanding.
252;There is a second scene in the film that raises a wry grin
253;Helen is an ingenue, an innocent, in every sense of the word.
254;he opens up to her, and in a moment of trust, of empathy, shares with her a glimpse of his tortured childhood, by showing her some the film his father took of HIM, while he carried out his research!
255;Karlheinz Bohm's performance as Mark is wonderful
256;And herein lies the problem with Peeping Tom
257;Peeping Tom (1960), is a unique movie, almost some extraordinary,in the sense of touching upon subjects that at first glance wouldhave only a somewhat limited commercial potential.
258;It also shows a confidence in the economic outcome of thefilm, or impervious to public blowback, from the controversialstory.
259;Those involved are keenly perfectionist throughout, such asin the script, the timeless, modern Miles Davis.
260;that rich women wore pants to look stylish, young anddesirable.
261;the movie builds a mix of suspense, tension with relaxation, in astrange paradox, over 90 mins.
262;PEEPING TOM is an undiscovered gem that deserves its place among cinema's most outstanding achievements.
263;Intense, erotic, suspenseful, PEEPING TOM is truly a gem of a movie.
264;This wonderfully creepy 1960 horror film predates Psycho by about 3 months and predates the slasher film by about 16 years and, in braving new ground which deviated from the Gothic Horror film movement spawned by Hammer Films in 1957, helped move horror from the Gothic castles to the house next door.
265;In to the young man's world, comes a young woman who only wants to understand him and love him, but will she find out his horrible secret before its too late?While lambasted by critics who condemend the film for being The sickets and filthiest film I can remember seeing . . . , Peeping Tom in one of the most interesting horror films of the early 60s.
266;In the interim, though, he made some wonderful Australian films that were, in general, well.
267;received (of these, American audiences are probably best familiar with The Age of Consent, starring James Mason and a young, tantalizing Helen Mirren).
268;He works for a film studio as an assistant cameraman, but is truly of the once.
269;Lewis struggles to keep his relationship with Helen normal while still indulging the seamier side of his nature, with the expected consequences.
270;lewis is a far more sympathetic character than ever was Norman Bates, and thus in many ways Peeping Tom is a superior film to Psycho in its depth of character.
271;with Lewis' inner struggle the center of the action, this might well have made a lot more 100.
272;best lists than it did.
273;see film for those interested in the history of the thriller.
274;PEEPING TOM famously was condemned upon its release in 1960, and has seen ascended to the position of cult favorite.
275;It is the last of Powell's major films that I have seen, and I must say that in comparison with his other films, this does not come off very well.
276;If you are expecting a minor masterpiece, you will be inclined to see it.
277;i believe this is a decent film, even if Powell's weakest major film.
278;carl Boehm, who is the son of the great German conductor Karl Boehm, does a good job in this film, but I wonder a bit about his having been cast.
279;Interesting, yes, but compelling, no.
280;one interesting casting quiddity was the presence of Miles Malleson and Anna Massey in the same film.
281;It is a moderately interesting film with some strong performances told with less than Powell's usual flair.
282;Hopefully in the future we will see a more balanced assessment of this film than dominates today.
283;The entire movie sort of stalks along, gently pulling you to watch.
284;Nothing will disturb you more than the amount at which you will love Karl Boehm and his sweet yet deathly voice.
285;Marks was a codes expert during WWII and is the most fascinating man I've ever heard talk.
286;People deserve good things and Powell's movie deserves as much recognition as possible.
287;Peeping Tom's impact remains resolutely undiminished in the 47 years that has seen it go from reviled and despised horror film, to a classic of British cinema.
288;That we continually open our eyes and eagerly follow Mark's descent into insanity, illustrates perfectly the power of Michael Powell's film.
289;An indispensable addition to every horror fans collection.
290;When director Michael Powell and screenwriter Leo Marks put a sort of metophoric mirror in front of us we are shocked by the distorted vision we see .
291;We actually find ourselves showing sympathy for what we thought to be a monster .
292;It is this twist of perception, shocking for audiences at the time of this movies release, that make this one of the most powerful cinematic expressions of all time.
293;It is also an interesting film to look at .
294;Michael Powell's most controversial, important and artistic achievement, also destroyed his carrer after the ferocious and merciless critics for this at.
295;time outrageous, unbeliavable and shocking classic about the meditation and observation of murder and depraved cruelty.
296;After destroying Powell's reputation, Peeping Tom eventually became a cult classic of the thriller genre, overthrowing standard after standard about any possible concept in post.
297;recomended, ultimate dark masterpiece in psychological thriller, the mind.
