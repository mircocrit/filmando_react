1;Was just wonderful sitting with the family on Christmas Eve laughing so hard together!
2;I loved it, i you are considering getting this i would recommend you to see Shaolin Soccer, both will make you laugh a lot
3;A nice mix of Kill Bill and Hotshots.
4;it seems that Bruce Lee and the Wachowski's have finally met the Anamaniacs.
5;Kung fu Hustle is a fantastically unique bit of coolness.
6;I love the movie but I also love to hear the original actors voice instead of the poor English voice over.
7;I'm a purist in this since and I like to enjoy the movie like I did the first time saw it at the theater with subtitles.
8;Oh well I guess I gotta watch the movie in simulated surround sound.
9;It'struly fantastical and goes over the top and kept me glued tothe screen.
10;They manage to make it fantastic,action packed and halarious.
11;If you like classic wire style kung fu, slap stick humor and old cartoon comedy, you'll love this movie.
12;I saw this movie in the theaters twice and loved it both times.
13;It has a lot of comedy, tight graphics, and even though it does have subtitles you get used to them afterwhile.
14;Definitely one of the best comedy/action moives that have come out recently.
15;I just really all around love this movie.
16;That has got to be my favorite scene.
17;All around if you like awesomely choreographed action scenes, humor, and a little bit of everyting.
18;then you will definately love this movie, even the subtitles.
19;Great movie for kids that are 10, 11.
20;Sorry, but Jackie chan is still number one.
21;I've seen plenty of kung fu movies, old and new, and most of them are pretty far.
22;With that in mind I thought this was a semi.
23;I thought the story and action were very original and intriguing.
24;I thought it was very inventive and probably the most compelling scene of any kung fu movie I've watched.
25;When I watch a comedy I want to laugh.
26;Also not very funny humor.
27;And I loved the ending, where the protagonist and the girl he knew for trying to save got together again, and married each other.
28;I do think they'll be a grand couple.
29;Good thing I gave it a chance to finish.
30;This is the kind of movie you should see if you have nothing else to do(at least in my opinion).
31;This is one of the best films so far this year (2005).
32;this move is so epic!
33;one of the best movies i have ever seen!
34;i cant stop watching it and it makes me laugh every time i watch it!
35;This is a life changing type of movie.
36;Probably one of my favorite movies of all time.
37;i Love this Movie Clear and Authentic a Must See Movie Will Have You Rolling All OVer the Floor .
38;What do you get if you blend a Jackie Chan movie, a Warner Brothers cartoon, the Matrix's wire work, some odd dance numbers involving men carrying axes, and a huge cast of Chinese martial artist actors?
39;In a way, it is.
40;There is a ton of action, in the form of kung fu fights and Matrix.
41;"style wire work that lends a ""much larger than life"" aspect to it all."
42;There is quite a lot of humor (some of it perhaps unintentional) in the less.
43;stellar acting, the Warner Brothers cartoon.
44;i found myself laughing out loud at several parts, and finding it very hard to take my eyes off the screen (kind of like that natural need to look at a train wreck).
45;i'm not sure I can explain why, but I think this may be one of the coolest and most interesting movies I've ever seen.
46;out weird in places, plain silly at times, and yet somehow it all works and becomes a true work of art.
47;My advice for someone watching this for the first time is to pretend it's a cartoon from overseas, played with live human actors.
48;This should put you in the right frame of mind to enjoy it.
49;i had such an incredibly good time watching this that I have to give it about an 8.5 out of 10 (where 10 is excellent).
50;well, we not only watched the end, but when we got done went back and watched parts again and two days later bought a copy.
51;"The movie is best described as the Matrix crossed with ""Dumb and Dumber"" and a Bruce Lee movie mixed in."
52;Somehow it manages to be satirical, silly while being occasionally gripping, artful and even slightly (very slightly.
53;I would actually rate it 4.5 stars.
54;One of the funniest films of the year.
55;"the classic ""bad guy"" makes good scenario is worked to great effect, with state of the art CGI and live action wire work to make an audio visual treat that doesen't take itself too seriously."
56;the battle scenes are excellent, if over the top in places.
57;This works because both the makers and the audience know it is overboard, that is what makes the film such great fun.
58;most action/scifi fans should have their eyes and ears peeled for some subtle and not so subtle homage to the best films in the field.
59;i found it a visually stunning treat, the story is plausibly consistent, given the film has already marked its territory as a comedy.
60;great fun, lavishly made, get it for the comedy and be amazed by the entire package.
61;Now that I have a chance to watch it again recently, I can appreciate what the director did with this movie.
62;Yes, the humor is geared more towards those who are familiar to asian customs, but the actions and the story line are universal.
63;Plus I love the fact that the main heros and villians do not look like the cookie.
64;Check it out and you will love it!Jae
65;The leader of the Axe gang likes dancing around during fights and afterwards.
66;Really funny and fun to watch.
67;Foreign films are not usually my forte but when it's this good it's worth watching in any language.
68;The story follows a young man attempting to earn his way into the number one gang, with hilarious and zany ideas.
69;Before long true Kung Fu masters show up and the martial arts is kicked into high gear and the delightfully ridiculous fights will surely enjoy any fan of unrealistic martial arts.
70;Overall its a good movie.
71;Dolby Digital just in english translate and its sound funny.
72;It is still a great movie.
73;This movie is comedy gold and the martial arts are off the chain.
74;stephen Chow is so funny!!
75;The one is on my top 10 list!!
76;This is a cult classic kung.
77;Very, very funny movie with plenty of dazzling fight scenes and incredible sound!
78;a few new faces who do a fantastic job and ideas that are so unique and refreshing that it puts a smile on your face.
79;You can account some of that success to the fact that American Politics/PC seem to be absent from these films.
80;And that's a good thing, to be sure.
81;But most of it comes from the beauty.
82;But I say just laugh at them and be glad that you have the capacity to enjoy it!So yeah, you can't watch this movie in English.
83;It's worth it times ten to just read the subtitles :)
84;I recommend this movie highly.
85;wow I watched this movie the other night, and I could not stop laughin.
86;Stephen Chow is very funny and riot, if you enjoyed Shaolin Soccer, then you will definitely enjoy Kung Fu Hustle.
87;my favorite scene in this movie was when Stephen Chow and his buddy was sneaking back into the village, and his chubby friend threw a dagger on his back.
88;loved it first time, I liked it this time.
89;The movie itself is excellent and the blu.
90;ray transfer is just perfect.
91;The action scenes are wildly inventive, the comedy guffaw.
92;worthy, some very funny violence(mostly cartoony and nothing you couldn't really show the kids)and the entire thing is filled with some of the most memorable characters you have ever seen.
93;Not to mention probably the finest CGI I've ever seen in a film.
94;i'm a huge Stephen Chow fan and I will recommend all of his films, many of which you can pick up right here on Amazon or on some great Asian film sites(AZNfilms.
95;This film is just as good, if not a smidge better than 'Shaolin Soccer'.
96;kinetic pacing or amazing CGI of either '.
97;hustle', but if you liked them you'll also like this one.
98;I personally think its his funniest film.
99;anyways, from the first frame to the last, 'Kung Fu Hustle' is endlessly inventive, entertaining, mindblowing, hilarious, and wonderful.
100;Its films like this that make going to the theatre exciting again.
101;Imagine a movie with the over the top action stylings of a Jackie Chan film but a funnier script.
102;This is an entirely new category of martial arts film, deserving of its own evaluation apart from spoofs like Kung Pow.
103;But I think that's its odd charm, so I will give it a solid four stars and call it a good pick for a contrarian in a lighter mood.
104;This movie is so visually entertaining you completely forget about the fact that you're reading subtitles.
105;I got into CJ7 and Shaolin Soccer because of this movie in particular.
106;Very entertaining and enjoyed the musical score plus dance scene.
107;Athletic Kung Fu and special effects.
108;I've watched this movie probably half dozen times and each time I am just as engulfed and entertained as the first time.
109;The story line, characters, design and all the components that make this movies were completed to perfection.
110;I very rarely give 5 stars to a movie because my bar is so high but this one definitely deserves it without hesitation.
111;This is a great movie!
112;Funny and fun with lots of great visual.
113;A must see for fans of the genre.
114;I enjoy all types of movies, especially comedy and horror and I have a lot of movies that I enjoy enough to watch again and again.
115;Recommend this exotic and off the chart kung fu action.
116;This movie is exceptional in what the real kung fu masters is all about.
117;its a funny movie for a spoof.
118;great effects,great action, if you like silly movies this ones good.
119;I loved this film from start to end!
120;It's a wonderful, fun family film!
121;A lot of thought and choreography was put into this movie and it paid off.
122;There was humor and satire but also poignancy and drama.
123;Steven Chow knows his stuff.
124;Good movie and soon to be another addition to my personal collection because it is worth seeing more than once.
125;wall movies to appreciate this gem.
126;But if you are, you will love this spoof.
127;Extremely well made, great cinematography, the fight scenes are choreographed superbly (think Matrix crossed with Kill Bill).
128;The humor is to die for.
129;I am a devoted and long time fan of Hong Kong action movies and pleased to report that Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle is the best of the hundreds I have seen since the early 1970's.
130;Chow's film is at once a loving tribute to and canny summary of the past 35 years of Chinese martial art cinema.
131;The film is beautifully shot and cleverly scripted.
132;It contains old school fight choreography along with marvelous wire.
133;The cast, mostly unknowns or lesser players in Chinese cinema, is a pure joy and includes several bona fide kung fu masters in key roles.
134;There is really nothing in Chow's previous films that would hint he is capable of creating such a wonderful entertainment.
135;note 2: As with almost all foreign language films, I recommend watching it in its original language with English subtitles even if an English language track is available.
136;"viewed on a Panasonic 50"" plasma via a Panasonic DMP."
137;This movie has some really funny moments.
138;That whole sequencewas comedic genius.
139;There's some humorous differences betweenthe two.
140;"kickin"" Edition***I still love this movie, and recently came across a 2007 reissue calledthe ""Axe Kickin' Edition""."
141;wise is the 2007 has more graphic blood effects:.
142;the new extras are pretty much run.
143;still, this is a classic comedic movie, either way!
144;It was of epic proportions, as big as The Seven Samurai or The Magnificent Seven.
145;Then a stream of Bruce Lee movies made up the bulk of the good stuff.
146;There were a lot of other good ones and in particular the specialty themes.
147;Bruce Li kept it alive and then Jackie Chan pushed it to new heights.
148;Chan and his directors bring to a new American audience the Chinese sense of humor that made many of the best movies of the past as good as there were.
149;Jet Li makes his pitch at becoming the new Bruce Lee.
150;I've figured out that he's a genius.
151;He's just made the greatest Chinese MA flick ever.
152;this movie is exciting, riotously funny and self.
153;It has size, rhythm, and heart.
154;I'll have to backtrack to catch up and see Shaolin Soccer.
155;this is a fun movie about a cataplier to butterfly story.
156;how a small community comes together to rid themselves of the tyrant.
157;the stunts, dance and special effects are fabulous.
158;this is a great movie.
159;Kung Fu Hustle is a good movie.
160;it's very creative and comparable to a superhero movie.
161;some actors in the movie hold powerful martial art skills.
162;it adds great comedy that's very orignal and even includes dances on a couple scenes.
163;"all I have to say is I liked it , good effects ""for the most part"" and entertaining to watch."
164;This movie is one of the best martial arts movies I have ever seen.
165;The reason it is so exemplary is because of the inverted themes with the hero of the story.
166;the main focus of the story is him, but also the town.
167;All the fighting is beautiful and while it tends to be referenced to other works, it still completely owns them and makes them their own.
168;It is in that powerful moment that this movie is something more than generic, something better than traditional, and something closer to magical.
169;This is a great movie if you like wire fu movies.
170;all I can say is that it is a lot of fun to watch and very much watchable again and again from time to time when you just need a cheering up.
171;I've been to see this movie three times so far, and it gets funnier and more enjoyable with each viewing.
172;I am overwhelmed by the superb action sequences, the comedic timing, and the serious, touching undertones, all of which integrate to produce a truly wonderful experience.
173;loud film full of hijinx and hilarity.
174;What it is, though, is a very enjoyable, amusing film that can be outrageously silly at times, and genuinely heartfelt at others, managing each with a refreshing ease.
175;Also, it is quite a beautiful film, with many of the acrobatics and stunts amazing and surreal.
176;Instead, it stays true to its core and emerges as a fun way to spend an hour and some change watching the hybrid offspring of The Matrix and an old Kung.
177;themed ascension of the aforementioned good guy to power, and the axe.
178;overall, a very enjoyable bit.
179;With its vibrant colors and incredible sound, Kung Fu Hustle is definitly one of the better Blu.
180;ray releases I have seen so far.
181;This movie is like combining Loony Toons with a Chinese Kung Fu movie, and the result is a hilarious movie filled with every Kung Fu clich ever.
182;My 10 year old son and I enjoyed this movie immensely.
183;This movie always makes me laugh.
184;This film, like other Chow films, is goofy yet very entertaining.
185;But that just adds to the fun of the film.
186;I love the very funny slapstick style humor.
187;But if you're like me and you love the cheese, it's worth the $15.
188;This is an excellent film that crosses a few boundaries.
189;It's first and foremost a kung.
190;fu action movie, fused with numerous comedic moments and slapstick, as well as some heartwarming (and heartbreaking) scenes.
191;"fu"", but ""Hustle"" was added to the English name to set it apart for western audiences."
192;The abundant insults and cursing (especially by the landlady) are hilarious if you understand Cantonese.
193;visually, this film is stunning for its representation of 1940's Shanghai, and the transfer to BD does a very good job.
194;Lots of wonderful and clever fight sequences by famed fight choreographer Yuen Wo Ping, as well as some great use of CG to exaggerate the action which draws inevitable comparisons to the Matrix (which used a lot CG and also involved Yuen).
195;wise, there's a fair amount of extra stuff in here for a Blu.
196;The interview, on the other hand, is aimed at western audiences who are completely new to Chow's work and HK cinema.
197;all in all, this is a great BD to have in your collection.
198;this is a very funny video i had seen it be for and enjoyed then ,i would recomend it to everyone
199;The graphics are amazing, the fight scenes are fun, and the movie itself is hilarious.
200;and Brother Sum takes his hatchet right across the top part of his head.
201;around great movie, and even if you don't like it .
202;he is a very good actor rather than just a comedian.
203;He is a kind of genius in a way similar to bruce lee, in ideas.
204;but i dont think the 5.1 sound is making very well in this movie.
205;it is outstanding in many respects,but most of all it's nice to see a movie that is so creative and genuinely funny,funny,funny!It should have been in theaters much longer.
206;steven Chow has captured the light Charlie Chaplin,Buster Keaton,Mack Sennett,Preston Sturges,Howard Hawks and so many other early screwball directors had and even the zaniness of the Warner Brothers Cartoons.
207;what a great time at the movies.
208;This is a great martial arts movie.
209;Great, terrific, amazing, pick your compliment.
210;Wild martial arts, genuinely funny comedy (which is really pretty rare in this genre), and at least one scene that if pure cinematic brilliance.
211;really, one of the most extraordinary moments I've ever seen on film.
212;stephen Chow: keep 'em coming.
213;Arrived on time and was in perfect condition.
214;This is a classic for the collection.
215;Nothing is funnier than classic archetypes portrayed in the most animated way possible, over.
216;The characters, acted perfectly, are written to be likeable, bizarre, and even intrinsically identifiable.
217;But the action, whether it be a gang slaughter at a police station, or a dance scene in the middle of a street, fits well with the wit of the play within the players.
218;Kung Fu Hustle is a film of martial arts mastery, high energy comedy, the twists of the human condition, and certainly a statement of the Haves and Have.
219;Just a wild ride, escapism in its truest form.
220;Funny and engaging, the movie is so fast.
221;paced and beautifully done that you don't even notice that there are subtitles
222;I RARELY hand out the '+' with my A's, so that should say something about how friggin' awesome this movie is.
223;It combines the best of everything you loved about The Matrix, Kill Bill, and Saturday morning cartoons.
224;loud funny throughout the entire movie and the experience of watching it is a wild ride.
225;providing the perfect soundtrack to a perfect movie.
226;this is by far one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a very long time.
227;Got this for my honey and he is SO happy.
228;He loves this movie and has already watched several times.
229;This movie cracks me up each time I see it.
230;If you are a fan of Kung Fu movies and love a little cheeky comedy, then you will love Kung Fu Hustle!!
231;This movie is really funny, and parodies all the stereotypes in the classic Kung Fu Movies.
232;"paced and excellent, probably the best I've seen in a film since ""Hero""."
233;"There are some great characters(i. e., the Landlady
234;, and although it's quite violent in places, it also has its light moments, and humor.
235;powered master of the Buddha's Palm.
236;But hey, it's a movie.
237;perhaps the most unique thing about the film is how our attention is shifted from one protagonist to another.
238;Oh well, whatever gets those critics through those long and lonely nights.
239;unconventional narrative style aside, there are plenty of other reasons to watch such as the eye popping effects and the humor.
240;Ordinarily, I can't stand CGI, but I really love the way it was used here.
241;Chow succeeds in using it in ways that most American filmmakers can't even dream about.
242;This movie is well done.
243;The martial arts are good.
244;i really enjoyed this movie and own it .
245;I bought it INSTEAD of going to the movies and watching it first.
246;At that point I knew this was going to be an interesting film and I was absolutely right.
247;I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of """"Kung Fu Hustle"""" (think Looney Toons meets Kill Bill) and recommend it to anyone who looks for odd, quirky movies that are also smart and creative, yet totally out there."""
248;Stephen Chow's latest movie is his best yet.
249;The real axe gang comes to town and the fun begins.
250;My first experience with Hong Kong producer/director/writer/actor Stephen Chow came when a good friend recommended Shaolin Soccer (2001), a film which I enjoyed a lot primarily due to its kinetic energy and off the wall, mind bending special effects, so when I heard Chow was coming out with another feature, titled Kung Fu Hustle (2004), I was very interested.
251;Well, turns out three residents of Pig Sty Alley are actually powerful, semi.
252;I went with that, letting the rest (the parts that didn't make sense) slide, managing to get through the film quite easily, helped immeasurably along by the virtual non.
253;stop, high flying, kinetic, highly comedic action and crazy go nuts special effects work.
254;One of my favorite parts of the film occurs near the beginning when Sing and his fat friend venture into Pig Sty Alley.
255;There's so much overall nuttiness going on in this film it's hard to describe it, but if you dig on zany Three Stooges antics, you'll probably enjoy this feature.
256;Hardcore film fans may also get a kick out of the film as there's plenty of references to other films, in particular The Shining (1980), The Blues Brothers (1980), and Spider.
257;All in all I thought this film a blast, one worth multiple viewings.
258;All in all a great package for a highly entertaining film, one I'm probably going to watch more than once.
259;"you will LOVE this film IF:1) you enjoy ""outrageously/beautifully choreographed"" martial arts films (ala Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey)2) you are a fan of the Bugs Bunny/Road Runner cartoons3) you have any sense of humor at all4) you love a nice story of ""good triumphs over evil"" and ""the broken heart is mended"" and the ""'diamond in the rough' is FINALLY polished to reveal the true gem"" and etc and etc and so on et al into infinity."
260;it's NOT a Broadway Musical or a martial arts DISCO film), you will witness:1) some of the most interesting AND entertaining characters to ever be compiled into a single film2) some wonderful AND clever sight gags (not to mention the smartly written dialogue)3) gorgeously executed battle sequences4) a DIVERSIFIED (to say the least) group of villians (especially the last one)5) a SUPRISING cast of heroes (well,.
261;aLL of them, really)6) a neat little story complete with a nice heart.
262;This is one fun and strange flick.
263;I think it is best described as Kung Fu meets the Road Runner and The Matrix.
264;It has some wonderful visual effects, a fun story that keeps you guessing, and some downright silly fun along with a kind of violence that is so stylized that you don't really get all that upset.
265;one example of a great visual is when one of our heroes is walking down a dark alley and we see a cat up on a wall.
266;This was a great movie, containing a segment from almost every genre known to man.
267;The best parts for me were the fighting scenes, where the action is choreographed to be almost a dance.
268;Most prominent in this movie is the comedy.
269;that had me laughing all the way through.
270;I would recommend this movie to viewers at least ten and up.
271;It is super clever and funny.
272;i love the price I got it 4 and the shipping time was great thx
273;I've watched it over and over and it just keeps getting better each time.
274;I recommend watching it with English subtitles and IN English.
275;He took the winning formula he perfected with his previous film and elevated it to a more ambitious scale.
276;He also wisely decided to have Sony distribute his movie in North America instead of Miramax who notoriously bungled the release of Soccer.
277;as he did with Shaolin Soccer, Chow uses CGI in very clever ways to express his ideas visually.
278;Kung Fu Hustle is bursting at the seams with one hilarious visual gag after another.
279;Chow understands that the enjoyment in watching his movies is reveling in the visual spectacle of them.
280;His movie has the visual inventiveness of ten movies.
281;It playfully quotes from such diverse movies as Spider.
282;One of the pleasures of watching this movie is to see what film it references next.
283;Meanwhile, Kung Fu Hustle continues to top itself with one breathtaking action sequence after another, each one building up to the penultimate showdown.
284;Chow's movie is so eager to please, such an unabashed celebration of movies that it makes the ones that come out of Hollywood every year look boring and outdated in comparison.
285;They go into detail about the filmmaking process in this informative and engaging track.
286;This is an entertaining and well.
287;Ric Meyers Interview with Stephen Chow is a nice conversation between the two men.
288;He talks about some of the cinematic influences on this movie as he comes across as a very smart and articulate fellow.
289;"also included is an ""Outtakes and Bloopers"" reel that is a very funny collection of blown lines."
290;Stephen Chow wrote, directed, and starred in this entertaining adventure, a cinematic ensemble of interesting and unique characters.
291;I picture wedding parties doing the axe.
292;It's a story with a message, a message about doing what's right, even if that means you are going to take a few lumps, serious lumps!
293;And what makes the movie so much fun is that director Stephen Chow knows when to jump back and forth between the serious and the not.
294;serious scenes in this movie.
295;Stephen Chow is a natural on the movie screen.
296;some of the clashes between the people of the besieged slum and their attackers are so visually stimulating that I shall never forget them.
297;When the two harpists come to kill the defenders of the slum, we are witnesses to some amazing cinematic treasures, as the special effects are top.
298;That unique tactic made the film stand apart from almost anything I have ever seen before.
299;It is a great movie!See ya next review!
300;For the most part, I like my martial arts films to be as realistic as possible, but I have no problem taking a walk on the cinematic wild side, especially when the special effects are as impressive as those in this film.
301;Regardless of its excesses, the martial arts action in the film is something to behold.
302;top visual delights (and it can be almost cartoonish at times), there's also a seriousness to the film.
303;It's all about good vs. evil, self.
304;The extraordinary special effects dominate the film and any viewer's discussion of it, but don't let that fool you into thinking there isn't a substantive story behind all of the flash.
305;Rest assured there are repercussions, as the Two Axe Gang brings in some of the world's most deadly killers to exact revenge .
306;born, kung fu genius .
307;and those are pretty darn rare.
308;and that is most certainly what Kung Fu Hustle does.
309;From a chase right out of Road Runner cartoons to the perfectly ridiculous Toad Style of fighting perfected by the Beast, you'll laugh .
310;but you'll also be in awe at how well the scenes play.
311;As writer, director, and star, Stephen Chow has produced a pure winner capable of entertaining fans across a range of genres.
312;"The fun in watching ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is picking up on the inferences to other films and genres both Eastern and Western."
313;It would also be easy to characterize this film as a parody or a satire of martial arts films but Chow has such an affinity for those films that it holds it's own with them.
314;Chow hits a homerun here wearing the multiple hats of actor, director, and writer.
315;His script is rich with characterization and the story takes enough nifty twists that it would be a disservice to reveal them here.
316;Where he really excels is as a visualist in both action and art direction.
317;, another imaginative sight penetrates the screen.
318;If you have reservations about martial arts films and you must see one this it.
319;This is one of the funniest Japaneese films I have ever seen.
320;Stephen chow is hilarious and the movie is action packed.
321;the story is awesome and so is the acting and the comedy.
322;this is a great film.
323;Once again Stephen Chow has put out another winner.
324;This movie has it all!
325;Interesting characters, laughs and some tear eyed moments, plus the martial arts are excellent!!!
326;I don't believe any movie with violence of any kind is good for children to watch, however this movie is great because of how well they mix the art of kung.
327;For me they utilized digital cinematography with kung.
328;fu choreography and it just worked really well to create a movie that mesmerizes and entertains quite well.
329;Everything preceding that is like the old Looney Tunes cartoons, and the last act is full of delimbings and decapitations, and a ton of blood.
330;I loved the exterior shots and how the cars looked so bright they looked practically computer.
331;Some aspects of the film work well, others work wonderfully, and some work just alright.
332;"One scene in the film reminded me of ""Kill Bill"", and that is the battle sequence where one man faces about 100 guys, and he scares them all away."
333;I have to say that this may be one of the best choreographed, best edited, best spoofing fil so far this year.
334;It's a very good movie.
335;see this film if you feel like watching an entertaining and thoroughly pleasing action.
336;He included this movie knowing that I love the genre and told me that this would most likely be a new favorite.
337;I watched it 2 more times while I was on my business trip and thought it was more brilliant each and everytime.
338;It's funny and heartbreaking and heartwarming and funny and thrilling and funny.
339;But the best part is.
340;The action scenes are well choreographed, but don't look choreographed.
341;My husband and I never get tired of watching, now the kids watch and love it too.
342;This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen!!
343;I recently watched it for the 2nd time after several years and it was as funny as the first time.
344;It is refreshing to see a kung fu movie with lots of humor!!!
345;The action is just slapstick.
346;It's brilliantly done and very witty.
347;I love the deadpan humor and snappy one.
348;I've watched it several times and each viewing reveals another hidden jewel: a subtle joke, double entendre, or a line from some classic film.
349;"kicking
350;The film then moves into its true tale .
351;He does, however, have one talent they need and this talent allows him to join the gang.
352;Our hero eventually comes into his own becoming a hero we can all enjoy .
353;virtue is rewarded and the bad guys suitably punished and all is well with the world.
354;One leaves the film with a lighter step and laughter in your heart .
355;not a bad mood to enjoy!
356;Its martial arts, its Looney Tunes, its awesome!Seriously, you have to see it to understand.
357;kickin Edition, I liked it.
358;This one has it all .
359;many cinematic elements are used in this film, which is Steven Chow's masterpiece, in my humble opinion.
360;The stoy is there, works, and carries through (i. e. it's not just a bunch of slap stick tied together).
361;let your hair down, kick back, and get ready for a few laughs with this very good foreign film.
362;This is definitely a very original film and by the end it does redeem itself somewhat, but the humor is rarely very funny.
363;This is definitely the last Stephen Chow film I will ever see.
364;And the physical comedy employed in the first half of the film .
365;come, on reflection, as something of a shock.
366;The landlord and his wife come forward, revealing their mastery of the martial arts that is almost enough to conquer the Beast .
367;evil dichotomy with a master's touch.
368;And yet on reflection we realize that more than good entertainment is at stake here.
369;The violence is neutralized by the comedy, and yet the characters, who are so well drawn by this talented cast and its director, are taken from us too soon.
370;Kung Fu Hustle plays this crafty game with us: amazing us with special effects.
371;enhanced fight scenes, making us laugh with well timed and conceived comic bits and pratfalls, but in the end leaving us with an odd dissatisfaction, as much with the film as with the genre.
372;hung Fu Hustle comes highly recommended, and we can only hope that its sequel, due out in 2008, lives up to the standards set by this imaginative and unsettling film.
373;Unlike most people I don't think Stephen Chow is a genius, but he is smart.
374;This film has a mix of comedy, adventure, crime caper and martial arts action.
375;Most notably is some nice fight choreography ssections, But Chow takes from fight scenes of Kill Bill vol.
376;Stephen Chow is a genius, and literally does it all .
377;podge of action, comedy, musical, period piece and even romance, to being the star of the show.
378;The Hong Kong style action is awesome and beautifully choreographed.
379;The comedy, albeit slapstick and dependent on high school level humor, nevertheless tickles our collective funny bone (again with the exception of the wifey).
380;Those who liked """"Shaolin Soccer"""" are definitely in for a treat."""
381;ray disc is loaded with content, including a revealing interview with Chow.
382;Much of the blood has been taken out.
383;While this is funny and the action is top notch, it is ultimately a movie about enlightenment, and waking up to the power that lies within us.
384;Kung Fu Hustle was one of those movies I had heard enough about to peak my interest.
385;The special effects are spectacular and the storyline is actually very good.
386;I was more than pleasantly surprised.
387;The characters are believable and the action sequences are among the best I've ever seen in any movie.
388;If this is to become the norm for movies of this genre from foreign contries I see a bright future ahead.
389;this is the biggest blockbuster in Hong Kong history, for good reason.
390;You will definitely be entertained.
391;This is an R. rated film for good reason.
392;Just sit back and enjoy the ride.
393;This is a well written (of you like spoofs) hilarious movie!
394;"I'm also a huge fan of ""Shaun of the Dead""!"
395;"So if you like that type of ""off beat"" humor, you'll love this movie!"
396;"the top"" comedy with TRUE insight, concerning what a REAL ""Master"" can do."
397;I already recommended the movie to a friend who has been doing martial arts his WHOLE life.
398;A fun movie, good special effects.
399;"One of the more interesting ""Kung Fu Comedies"" that I've seen in the last several years."
400;Keeps in line with Stephen Chow and his brand of comedy.
401;This movie has a good balance of action and humor wrapped inside of it.
402;The fight scenes are surprising and well choreographed.
403;"if you are a fan of the director Steven Chow and his movies like ""God of Cookery"" and ""Shaolin Soccer"", you will definately enjoy this movie."
404;If you are a Jackie Chan fan, you'll probably like this movie as well, since it's done in a Buster Keaton/Looney Tunes type style.
405;This is good to keep in mind if you're going to watch it with young children.
406;in addition to this,it also has a good story line and some very heart.
407;I would rate this as one of the best Kung.
408;Plus, you'll laugh until it hurts!
409;A fantastic lesson in comedic storytelling from Chinese cinema.
410;A classic hero story with lots of over the top laughs.
411;That's all fine and good .
412;I love a good laugh as much as the next person .
413;i went into the theater thinking it was going to be a good.
414;I left thinking it was the best movie I had seen all year.
415;This is such a great movie!
416;That made it so much funnier.
417;This is a great movie for someone looking for something completely insane.
418;This movie relies on pure comedy, and some cool effects.
419;I'm a huge fan of comedy kung.
420;fu movies, and this movie hits the target spot on.
421;Stephen Chow's movies are a blast.
422;This is one of our favorite karate movies.
423;One of my favorite movies and it's B. ray!
424;I was so pleasantly surprised and thrilled from the very beginning that I could actually feel the shift in my mood.
425;good movie as we know that term to apply, however it simply lifted my spirits.
426;it has good action too.
427;it aint gonna win an oscar, but it will definitely entertain the heck out of you.
428;Kung Fu Hustle combines some of the best aspects of action and comedy with great results.
429;The action scenes are very well done, but the hilarious plot makes it impossible not to laugh.
430;Everyone knows that one of the most important traits of a kung fu movie is exaggerating human capabilities.
431;I was in stitches!I loved the action, the Kung Fu scenes.
432;A friend recommended this movie to me.
433;It has some of the funniest scenes you will ever see in a movie.
434;The knife throwing scene had me absolutely screaming with laughter.
435;It's honestly hard to describe.
436;It is a kung fu movie and a comedyand a love story and a morality play and a live action cartoon all in one.
437;I have watched it multiple times and each time I've notice something I missed and enjoy the movie just a bit more.
438;This was really a very good movie!
439;It has a lot of great qualities, including a really nice ending.
440;The action sequences are great.
441;Then what a pleasant surprise to meet Sing.
442;"I've always been a fan of Stephen Chow and his uniquely quirky sense of humour and I had watched his earlier films like the ""God of Cookery"" for example and his secret agent spoof but his films always seemed to start and develop well but to always have lame endings in addition to being rather shallow and one."
443;"That is until this great film which balances the same comedy with a very good story of redemption and of how two ""losers"" finally make it good."
444;"in ""Kung Fu Hustle"" we finally get a very good Stephen Chow ending which never fails to bring a tear to my eye each time I watch it."
445;What makes this rise above the usual Stephen Chow outing is the great other story within the story with the flashbacks explaining why the Chow character behaves the way he does as an adult and how he finally finds redemption.
446;this is an excellent Stephen Chow film and it is in my opinion his best to date and this blu.
447;This is the best Kung Fu movie I have ever seen!
448;The choreography and special effects are excellent!
449;The plot is fun, and the characters are hillarious!
450;, the movie so well done, and immersive that you almost forget that you're reading subtitles!
451;I also heard, later, it had same choreography as Kill Bill movies and the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon movie so it was artistically enjoyable while it is constantly trying to make you smile.
452;Kung Fu Hustle is the best martial arts film of the year.
453;I agree, this is Kill Bill meets Looney Tunes.
454;The script is your typical Kung Fu story, but the fight scenes are excellent and I can't say enough and the fantastic special effects.
455;The Lion Scream, The Buddhist Palm, I could just go on and on, this film is amazing.
456;my personal favorite scene of the movie is when the kung fu masters fight the two assassins that play their instruments while tossing swords at their opponents.
457;"I have never seen anything like that in my life on a movie
458;Worth seeing the movie just for that battle sequence alone!
459;If you love martial arts/kung fu movies this is for you!!!!
460;This movie came in perfect condition.
461;I love this movie and if you have not seen it you must watch it.
462;This movie is unique in many ways.
463;the animation and effects are seamless, clever and always enhance the story.
464;Silly and funny as this movie is, there is a compelling back story.
465;Chinese director Chow has delivered a great comedy.
466;This movie is a laugh a minute.
467;Truly for children of ALL ages.
468;Any Stephen chow movie is a great movie.
469;This one is a very funny movie.
470;Thoroughly enjoyable action movie from beginning to end.
471;dance sequence that segues into a Sergio Leone parody with Godfather shadings, you are in for an enjoyable ride.
472;The ghetto set alone, the seed of great martial artists, is very reminiscent of """"Dead End""""/""""Full Metal Jacket' with jarring delight."""
473;wonderful to see good use of mature actors as martial artists.
474;"it also captures the exhilarating wish you find in ""Life Is Beautiful,"" that life can be redemptive and inspirational."
475;It is a wonderful appreciation of Hollywood film work and yet original in many ways.
476;Its awesome imagination elevates its derivative aspects completely.
477;Terrifically entertaining film featuring non.
478;I'm speechless, all I can say is that I will be watching it over and over.
479;I'm not going to verify this, but I believe Stephen Chow created and acted in this film and it is incredible in its humor, its action, and its engaging story.
480;recommended by a friend and I thought this might be just a guys movie but my wife watched it and said it's about as generally entertaining as a movie can get, because if its comedy, romance, drama and action.
481;Anyway, give it a shot, if you like comedy and you can appreciate Kung Fu themes, you'll like it.
482;laws refused to see it in the movies.
483;They were shocked by the beginning, roaring with laughter in the middle and sighing at the end.
484;This movie is one of the better ones, and its Warner Brothers cartoon.
485;esque style of physical humor is astonishingly slapstick and fun.
486;excellent service from this seller, movie came in perfect condition, appropriately packaged, and in a reasonable time frame.
487;I'd seen this movie on TV a couple of times and it kept me rolling with massive laughter.
488;The special effects and Kung Fu action are guaranteed to please the viewer.
489;If you want to laugh your socks off, this is a must.
490;Now, I can watch it and laugh whenever I so desire.
491;One of the funniest movies I`ve seen in a long time, you`ll be watching this one over and over.
492;It rates up there with Mars Attacks in entertainment.
493;I would give you a synopsis but you really need to see this piece of cinema gold to appreciate it.
494;You did a great job!
495;KUNG FU HUSTLE is clearly one of the silliest, funny, genuinely well.
496;It is so very refreshing to lose yourself in this farce knowing that the entire purpose of the film is to entertain.
497;But as in all good comedy there is also a message.
498;name it, the film takes a shot and the shot outdoes the original!
499;The color and cinematography are terrific, the musical score (to which Chow also contributed!)
500;Recommended, even for serious movie aficionados!
501;if you want the lighter side of kung fu, with some great special effects and some funny characters.
502;very funny movie almost slap sick its people makeing fun of something from their culture not making fun of someone elses culture
503;It is entirely silly but just a lot of fun.
504;This film is a rare bird indeed, worthy of all the hype.
505;Fantastic fight scenes and legitimately funny moments are combined in this film to create an incredibly entertaining film.
506;Originality can give the viewer a consciousness expanding experience and Kung Fu Hustle is very original.
507;Its probably the best martial arts film ever made because it has loads of soul and drama and fantasy.
508;i watched it late at night and when I went to bed I had an intense crazy dream!
509;This is how good Kung Fu Hustle is.
510;It is funny, yet serious.
511;Totally recommend it to every body, especially those who love action movies.
512;I've always liked this movie because it's hillarious.
513;Finally found it here for a good price and did not think twice when it came up as a suggestion when browsing through other funny movies.
514;The movie condition was good and have no complaints.
515;I love old skool kung fu movies with the terrible acting but good coordinated fight scenes but I also love the newer more visual effects movies such as Ninja Assasin.
516;Kung Fu hustle is a pretty good kung fu movie with a little added twist of humor here and there.
517;The plot is pretty good the first few fight scenes are pretty damn nice.
518;My only problem with the movie and why I dont give it five stars is because the last fight scene isnt all that great.
519;After the first few fight scenes of the movie I expected something a lot more awesome and intense than what was given.
520;I love this movie, I have watched it with my sister at least a dozen times.
521;This movie is funny, interesting, entertaining and has some touching moments.
522;What I like best about this movie is it is unique.
523;"It is Stephen Chow's follow up to ""Shaolin Soccer"" and is really funny while having from seriously cool action scenes."
524;You will be pleasantly surprised.
525;If you enjoyed the action from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and enjoy silly comedy from slapstick movies, you will like this movie.
526;I never thought he has that big funny bone.
527;Of course Steven Chow is a big funny actor from 90s with lots of his fan all over Asia.
528;But this movie that he made was the big surprise.
529;i think he mastered what makes people laugh in the cinema.
530;And, it is still amazingly funny.
531;the making documentary also give a good insight of the movie.
532;I wish the creative Asian movie should debut directly in USA market.
533;i recommend this movie to all viewers!
534;Kung Fu Hustle is again a wonderful and just plain amazing film from writer/director Stephen Chow.
535;this IS censored and edited.
536;Kung Fu Hustle is the best reviewed wide release film thus far this year, and there is a very good reason for that .
537;it IS the best wide released movie thus far this year.
538;this film is brilliantly original and monstrously entertaining.
539;The movie has smart, sharp comedy with brilliant editing and timing, fantastic action scenes which really give you a sense of scale, power, and grace .
540;and an artistic bent and ambition that actually works.
541;The characters are funny and the performances are outstanding.
542;stephen Chow is not only one of the world's greatest comedy actors, he is also one of the world's greatest comedy directors .
543;actually, he's one of the world's greatest directors period.
544;chow has created his own new style of comedy.
545;He uses the language of film and the techniques of visual storytelling in his comedy better than anybody.
546;The visual language supports and enhances his comedy, and often becomes the very basis and essence of the comedic communication to the audience.
547;"many scenes in this film can be compared to dance numbers, but in truth, the entire film is a ""dance"" of brilliant visual direction ."
548;instead, we go straight into the scene not knowing what the weapon is or what it can do, and he gives us a gorgeous, slowly.
549;"Finally, after this buildup, we get the ""punchline"" in a gorgeous but brutally unforgettable series of quick shots."
550;it's an amazing piece of visual storytelling, and it is not alone in this movie.
551;Nearly every scene is infused with visual storytelling splendor.
552;Chow uses cinematic language to tell a story in an interesting way better than any other director working today.
553;directed film, the filmmaking is as fun to watch as he is as an actor.
554;"Every single shot slides in and out of each other in a visually striking way, but they are not merely there just ""to look cool"" like we get from so many other directors today ."
555;the shots are visually striking for the purpose of using the camera to tell the story.
556;They accomplish a dramatic point that enhances the meaning of the scene and/or story.
557;And realize that you are watching a future film legend in the making while you're there.
558;But whether you care about film history or not, you will certainly have a very fun time watching this movie.
559;I am not as big a fan of kung fu movies as my husband is, but this is a movie we can both enjoy.
560;Kung Fu Hustle is a brilliant parody of western themes and mindblowing Kung Fu action from start to finish.
561;The ambiance made me feel like i was in China again, as the tenement house is realistic and authentic (designed by Stephen Chow) plus the music score is of traditional Chinese opera orchestra.
562;Choreography, sets, costumes and colors are magnificent!
563;The special features are fun and Ric Meyers did a great one on one interview with Stephen Chow, (this is his Masterpiece).
564;You will not believe this (i didn't at first), but this a spiritual movie at a high level.
565;I truly want you to go see this great film, a. s. a. p., but remember, it is so insanely funny it may be hazardous to your health.
566;(Possible treatment for this condition: Breath deeply, count thirty and think of the last Adam Sandler film you saw.
567;You have to think crushing bones and kicking people square in the jaw is, at least in theory, the very nucleus of great comic genius.
568;If any of these pertain to you, then you very well may get the brilliance of this film.
569;this movie, who is written and directed by Stephen Chow, is pretty much a live.
570;action cartoon, but it takes the action very seriously.
571;The action scenes were handled by renowned martial artist Yuen Wo Ping best known for his work on the Matrix trilogy, so you know it's full of imagination, as well as some killer special effects.
572;All the characters are hilarious too, especially the guy who, for some reason has his ass hanging out of his pants through.
573;As well as the man with the shaking man.
574;i haven't laughed this hard in quite a while.
575;This is by far his best work to date.
576;But until then I would highly recommend this movie to any fan of action.
577;So I hope you'll have as much fun as I did watching this movie.
578;The movie is one of the best movies ever made, its one of those movies that you can see over and over again with out being bored.
579;Kung Fu Hustle paints, from a palette consisting of badassitry, comedy (in true Chow fashion) and nostalgic emotion, a unique, exciting, hilarious, heart.
580;felt film that dazzles and entertains from beginning to end.
581;They enter a town and begin to pick on the inhabitants.
582;The artistic ability, cinematography and special effects in the martial arts battles is very artistic and at times it is difficult to find the line between comedic excess, beauty and badassitry.
583;But there is a story here and it is quite nostalgic and beautiful as well.
584;We see Sing quivering between the two sides, the kind.
585;hearted town's people, and the dreaded axe gang's members, until finally he chooses good over evil.
586;Perhaps the most beautiful moment in the film involves Sing executing a particular kung.
587;I will not spoil it for you, suffice to say that it is one of the most awesome scenes I have ever witnessed in Cinema, blending together the aforementioned qualities of comedy, badassitry, beauty and emotion and tying together the entire story quite well.
588;It is the final kung fu scene in the film, and following that, the film wraps everything up quite nicely in a heart.
589;It has immense replay value for me and each time you watch it you seem to catch something new, whether it be a new joke, a new thought, or a new image of beauty and artistry, this film just keeps calling me back again and again.
590;Funny and good get your laugh on like crazy all n all a great family movie go see it for yourself
591;I loved Shaolin Soccer and was really looking forward to this movie, but the plot sucked!
592;Beautiful comedy with terrific kung fu, very nice movie to spend time on watching it by whole family on sunday night
593;If a movie was made for blu ray this is it.
594;Needs more extras but the movie is perfect.
595;overall entertaining, at least on the first watch.
596;It looked like it was going to be a stylish kung fu flick, but quickly realized it was a comedy, and quite a good one at that.
597;The effects and fighting were really impressive.
598;Very funny, extremely silly, surprisingly violent with adult situations and a childrens fairy tale.
599;I liked it enough to watch it twice at the theatre.
600;Though I rarely watch movies twice, especially at the theatre, I knew my kid would love this.
601;So I forked over the wad and enjoyed it again!My eleven year old loved it.
602;Very funny stuff!The story is a combination of Kung Pow (by the way 'Betty' is the landlords husband) and the cartoon called Dragon Ball Z.
603;The fight scenes were amazing to watch.
604;Very clever, energetic, creative, silly and fun.
605;Each battle gets successively better!It really works well because the characters are outlandish and colorful, yet sympathetic and real.
606;For example, one of the heroes is a cigarette.
607;puffing landlady with a special power.
608;It brings the movie full.
609;i guess I should give it five stars.
610;Regardless, I highly recommend this entertaining film.
611;This wonderful comedy in Blu.
612;It's best to watch it in Cantonese with English subtitles, it's then pure genius.
613;I am a fan of anything he has done.
614;the soundtrack to this film is outstanding!!
615;It adds so much to the movie and can stand alone as well.
616;i have the US release soundtrack and the Hong Kong version as well,and they are just terrific!!
617;If you love Kill Bill and Man With The Iron Fist, You've got to see this!!!
618;It's action packed with tons of fighting and comedy!
619;I've seen quite a few of Stephen Chow's films and this is probably my favorite.
620;It combines a good story with some slapstick comedy and some of Stephen Chow's classic deadpan.
621;Very funny and good for the whole family.
622;besides for the the great fight scenes the cgi great but the characters are teffiffic.
623;Stephen Chow is at his best, the movies is easy to follow.
624;I found myself laughing through most of the movie, a strange combination of humor and artistic approaches.
625;notch for picture and sound as well.
626;What a great film,this was one of the suprise imports in the movie theaters,very funny stuff indeed,a very funny kung fu flick with a great story line too,The evil cigarette smoking landlady is very funny and memorable,as well as all the other great elements of this ultra cool film!!!
627;This is a good movie, from every angle.
628;The photography, the brilliant computer graphics, nice (though sometimes too silly or stupid .
629;Stephen Chow is just brilliant.
630;He showed the world that he is not just a comedian, but a great director too.
631;A great entertainer and I do recommend.
632;Except for this: the various fight scenes are truly outstanding.
633;It is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen.
634;I thoroughly enjoyed this flick!
635;The various scenes will having you laughing loudly.
636;This is a GREAT movie, however it is subtitled.
637;This is one of my favorite films.
638;Delivery was quick and it arrived in perfect shape.
639;Being a chow fan myself, I must say this is by far the best work he's done.
640;I was absolutely captivated and immediately at home in this very foreign place.
641;This film is so strangely retro and yet tangible.
642;But when we thought it couldn't get any better, he surprised us with this masterpiece, Kung Fu Hustle.
643;the effects are fierce, and yet organic.
644;The characters are strong, vivid and effective.
645;The imagery and magic of the story and scenery and amazing overwhelmingly inspired soundtrack blend.
646;viewers will find themselves drawn into the fantasy world of Kung Fu with funny, fascinating characters that blow people's mind away.
647;This allows general audiences around the world to get pass the cultural or language barrier and enjoy the atmosphere it's creating.
648;The action scenes are also visually stunning according to the design by famous action designer Yuen Ho Ping (Responsible for Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and The Matrix trilogy).
649;overall I give it 5 stars.
650;It's probably the most entertaining Chinese film to date.
651;This one will sure save a spot for Steven Chow in the history of Asian cinema.
652;In SHAOLIN SOCCER, and again in this movie, he creatively spices up his wacky world with musical numbers, breathtaking fight sequences and just plain fun use of CGI.
653;My whole family loves this movie, and it's tough to get everybody to agree on one movie to watch.
654;There's plenty action and also some comdey>>as my son calles it dark humor.
655;for those of you who enjoy this type of movies I give it a thumbs up!!!
656;fu Hustle is a fun martial arts comedy.
657;With how cartoonish it can be, I guess you can call it a fantasy as well.
658;fu movies you should be entertained by this movie.
659;It has the style of an old black and white movie in some ways.
660;One of the funniset scenes takes place when Stephen Chow challenges some town people to a fight.
661;He wants to prove himself worthy to a badass gang.
662;The movie is great fun and good for a laugh even if the final battle is overly silly and not as funny as it could've been.
663;Although, graphic in some scenes, it is absolutely hilarious and entertaining.
664;My entire family loved it!
665;This is absolutely my favorite movie of all time.
666;Does it have a deep and moving storyline?
667;No, but it is funny, it has plot turns and Stephen Chow is a hoot as our wayward hero.
668;I didn't think it could be done, but it is even better on Blue Ray.
669;I highly recommend this movie to someone who just wants good entertainment that anyone in the family could watch and enjoy.
670;I remember picking it up years ago at Walmart in the $5 bin.
671;But this movie was great.
672;Even with subtitles, it was still kick axe!
673;This is one of the best kung fu movies, ever.
674;If you are a Jackie Chan fan like myself and like comedy in your kung fu, but you still enjoy Jet Li, Ekin Cheng, and Chow Yun Fat fliks with powerful fight scenes and crazy flying around, then this is right up your alley.
675;It's funny without being overly goofy and stupid about it.
676;There's some pretty good CG as in Shaolin Soccer, and Chow makes good use of the CG even in sight gags.
677;But, there's good romance to this story as well, and overall you'll be pleased by the time it ends.
678;Otherwise, take it from me, I'm a Hong Kong and Japanese film fan, and this one is going right next to Shanghai Noon, Gorgeous, and The Duel.
679;It was good, I enjoyed the comedy and the action, though I think there was slightly more action than comedy, it was still a fun movie to see.
680;This movie delivers in all three of those categories.
681;Either way, it's still a great movie.
682;down one of the silliest, funny movies I have ever seen.
683;I would recommended this film to anyone who enjoys this form of entertainment.
684;Stephen Chow has a sense of humor that knows few equals.
685;I loved this film so much that I bought the Blue.
686;For me this is one of the most clever and funny films I'v seen in many years.
687;For all it's cartoonist qualities there are still many touching scenes with emotional depth.
688;"I'v shown this film to many friends, and during viewing once they ""get it"" where this film is coming from it's fun to watch them giggle, guffaw and bust out in laughter."
689;"It's very ""Chinese"" and universal at the same time."
690;"Kung Fu Hustle is funny and a bit absurd, taking from ""The Gangs of New York"" and ""The Untouchables"" just to name a few, but manages to still have enough serious moments to satisfy fighting fans."
691;The blend of animated effects, music, and fighting is what made the movie so enjoyable.
692;The music is just amazing with the drums, violins, and classical instruments.
693;What's hilarious in the movie is how the characters start to dance to a musical piece that is playing in the background.
694;Steven Chow blew the audiences away with this super hit.
695;for those who have'nt seen it yet,it's a treat you simply cannot miss.
696;A very amusing story with off the wall special effects.
697;At times serious and at most crazy hijinks, Kung Fu Hustle is perfect for any action/martial arts/comedy/gangster/hong.
698;This movie is definitely worth the time and money spent.
699;I love it, its a great mood uplifter, but be aware.
700;Best Kung Fu movie ever, hands down.
701;I absolutely loved this movie when it reached the U. s. Saw it for free at a screener and proceded to actually pay to see it four more times!
702;I would really recommend this flick to ANYONE who wants a screamingly funny experience.
703;The two commit a few petty crimes to prove they are worthy criminals.
704;When they enter the tacky slum run by a chainsmoking landlady and her womanizing landlord husband and try to intimidate the slum dwellers, the real hilarity begins.
705;The scenes with the knives and snakes are beyond funny!
706;If Chow accomplishes this feat, he will be accepted into the gang.
707;"In the final scene, the ""world's greatest criminal"" and Chow face off and Chow's chi is ultimately realized."
708;"along the way, the viewer is introduced to a cast of interesting characters including the ""coolie,"" the tailor, the noodles and congee maker, the buck."
709;There are so many comedic surprises in this movie it's easy to watch it numerous times.
710;I own it and it is one of my children and my all time favorites.
711;Kung Fu Hustle is a good movie for the family or anybody.
712;It has its moments of smart and silly comedy, and a good dose of fighting.
713;Good Kung Fu, nice story line, makes me laugh.
714;Not all that many good karate movies and I can watch this over and over :)
715;I love this movie when it is dubbed.
716;i loved this movie since the first time i saw it.
717;Hustle is a very entertaining and humorous take on the hero within genre.
718;It's very pretty visually as well, which is a pleasant surprise.
719;Understated comedy and cool f/x.
720;this is brilliant this movie, the visual effects as well as the twists in the story line keep it action packed, and the humor is well done also.
721;I loved the musical score.
722;it was so well put together!
723;the physical comedy is great, and the acting is superb.
724;And it chops and it slices and it's funny because it's true.
725;The best of a kung fu movie and british comedy.
726;This movie is a delight.
727;i loved it more the second, third .
728;each time I watch it the more I love it.
729;I had heard the reviews but I was hesitant to see a movie with subtitles that seemed to be filled with Kung.
730;What a riot and what a great, great story.
731;Part broadway show, part action spoof, part art.
732;house cinematic genius, this movie is great on so many levels.
733;The story itself is a winner and even when the fight sequences go on a tad too long, stick with it because the payback is awesome.
734;"gang"" thugs and marvel at the digital and real life stunts that are shown."
735;The story begins with a rather serious scene when the entire Crocodile gang is taken out by the dancing, powerful, and notorious Axe Gang.
736;The fight sequences were amazing and like nothing you've ever seen before and the story is gripping.
737;There's one scene where these two assassins use sound waves as a weapon so maybe that helps to show how unique this is.
738;I recommend watching this film in subtitles and not in the English dialogue.
739;The music is great because it adds extra edge and suspense to the film.
740;There's a new director in town and that man is Stephen Chow who brings us an hilarious kung.
741;fu fighting special effects extravaganza of a movie.
742;Not one of the industry's best works.
743;i watched the movie a day after I received the movie and the action scenes were crisp and clear and the soundtrack was excellent.
744;The movie was definitely enjoyable for the family.
745;The fight scenes were well choreographed and it was appropriate for anyone to watch.
746;One moment there will be a complex kung fu ballet, and the next moment two characters are chasing each other down the road like the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote.
747;It's confusing at times, but it's all fun.You'll probably enjoy this flick more the second time you see it, because you'll have figured out who the heroes and villains are, and why they are doing what they are doing.
748;Frequently the cinema world frowns upon slapstick, as it is a simple and unintelligent form of comedy.
749;Slapstick finally finds its true purpose besides smashing pots and pans on top of people's heads, or pulling away chairs from seating people.
750;step further by inventing the new Shaolin Kung Fu style Slapstick, which willfully and intentionally beats up the audience with bellyaching laughter.
751;The magic of cinema will remove the obstacle of time through Chow's creative fantasy approach and deliver a timeless journey into the small Pig Sty Alley where the story's heroes and crooks will converge in an epic comic battle of the kung fu fists and kicks.
752;the action is plentiful in Kung Fu Hustle to which some film critics has uttered dislike, but it is in the large amount of kung fu where the audience will discover an unpolished gem.
753;The difference in Chow's film is mostly cultural, but it also has his own comic martial art touch to it.
754;There are also many spoofs on scenes from other films such as Matrix and some Spaghetti Westerns.
755;Regardless of Kung Fu Hustle's similarities to other stories, Chow achieves an extraordinary film that delivers valuable messages such as forgiveness, honor, and love in the backdrop of a heavy dose of humor.
756;Kung Fu Hustle is a very creative take on the Hollywood martial arts action film.
757;the opening sequences, which played out like a West Side Story musical, gave way to many mind.
758;blowing special effects from the beginning of the film all the way to the end.
759;well written, well acted and expertly directed, I would recommend Kung Fu Hustle to any lover of great film.
760;Funny, great looking movie sets, special effects had me rolling on the floor laughing.
761;There are some nice CGEs and comic touches, but it's hardly belly.
762;"Conclusion: A cinema version of ""having a Chinese"", ."
763;It also has a strange and beautiful love story at it's center.
764;It also gives good Ideas for Halloween.
765;The land lady is the best !!
766;it is the kind of film you can watch6xs and still see something new.
767;This precipitates a great deal of martial arts action.
768;"tradition, but more of a humorous homage along the lines of ""A Mighty Wind,"" where you have to get it right at the same time you are making your comic points."
769;"You might be able to reduce ""Gong fu"" down to a combination of karate and slapstick, but you have to grant that Chow has to get both parts right, which is why this works."
770;The comedy is integrated as well as the wirework, which is why I found this film so utterly enjoyable.
771;The goal is to have fun and it is well met here.
772;the more you know the conventions of the genre the more you can appreciate how Chow's film plays with them, especially with the revenge of the supporting characters mentality that is at play.
773;"One of the reasons I thought ""Spider."
774;"man 2"" was the best comic book superhero movie made to date was because of the match up between Spider."
775;Here we are in the early days of the 21st century and perhaps it is because of the advances in CGI that wirework comes across as still being quite impressive, even the two of them are mixed the way they are here.
776;ping Yuen can come up with that looks good on camera.
777;If it looks good, then do it.
778;This might not be a great film, but it is certainly great fun, so much so that the best thing I can say about it is that people who do not like kung fu movies should enjoy and be impressed by this one.
779;With all the excitement of Crouching Tiger's great visuals, Kung Fu Hussle adds a deal of humour that makes this a much better film.
780;if you love the Coen brothers, or Monty Python,you will love this!
781;I love every part of this movie.
782;The action scenes were just awesome making it the best martial arts movie of the year.
783;Movie also filled with hilarious scenes.
784;Such is the delight of Kung Fu Hustle, a brainchild of Stephen Chow from Hong Kong who wrote, directed and stars in this rather outrageous spoof of martial arts movie.
785;This is the stuff that this 2004 film is made of .
786;a rare piece of clever entertainment.
787;There's the real Axe gang itself.
788;the action never stops and the story plays out with outrageous martial arts scenes enhanced by the use of modern technology, concealed wires, and special effects.
789;kung Fu Hustle is a rare treat.
790;this movie is a sort of unexpected hilarious comedy and action kung fu film.
791;is action/adventure/romance/comedy all in one.
792;see it, watch it, enjoy it and recommend it.
793;having seem Stephen Chow's previous comdey films(hong kong films) i must admitt he's surprises me more as an director with in depth vision eastern traditions and all that is good from the chinese culture than just a comdian actor.
794;Since Shaolin Soccer which i absolutely loved he yet again produced another delightful film.
795;i think he and the director for hero and house of flying dagger stands out of the group of chinese Actor/director trying to break into the western market, their approach is simple and pure almost all elements of the film is eastern, the chinese music, actors, story and action(kung fu), this is an aspect i admire about these actor/director becos its what it is and not purposely packaged for the western market.
796;these films are made to reveal how the eastern world is, its rich chinese cultures and its customs.
797;the script is very well written unfortunately subtitles can never do justice to the original language, there are soo many gags and funny dialogues that just disappear in the subtitles.
798;learn chinesebeing a chinese this film makes me feel good after watching it, its funny and touching not to mention at some stages totally crazy but its all what stephen chow whats to deliver ENTERTAINMENT.
799;stephen Chow i bow to you!
800;This is the funniest movie I have ever seen.
801;But its a MUST see.
802;I loved this movie alot of action combined with comidie, great combination.
803;Highly recommended for Kung fu enthusiast!!!
804;"As that has never happened before, I heartily recommend this movie for anyone who has seen a Bruce Lee, Jet Li, Jackie Chan, or the more ""sophisticated"" Crouching Tiger or Flying Dagger movies."
805;This movie has subtle and slapstick humor (e. g., the unremovable cigarette in the matriarch's mouth), but is quite intelligent, and encompasses good cinematography with subtle effects (such as the visually vibrating heat waves as the bad guys first approach the slum village).
806;Yes, it is cartoonish in parts, but is an intelligent cartoon, if that makes sense.
807;"For those tired of conventional ""by the numbers"" movies turned out on a regular basis, this is a high recommendation."
808;it has more heart to it than most romantic movies and you actually kinda wished it was explored a little more(as opposed to most tacked on love sub.
809;i strongly recommend watching the english.
810;the cgi efx really add an element of fun to the proceedings rather than trying to make eveything seem ultra.
811;but i was even more pleasantly surprised at how much action/fighting there was.
812;and the action choreography is very good as well.
813;work and cgi, there's some actual martial arts fighting with some really good kicks/weapons/hand to hand combat.
814;* i really liked the characters: the two main down.
815;But every little bit helps:.)
816;It's the funniest, movie I have seen for a very very long time.
817;the genius of the movie is how the focus constantly shifts, the references to other classic movies, brilliant camera work, and brilliant action sequences.
818;this is something you NEED to see.
819;ray disc is phenomenal to watch (repeatedly.
820;If you are a fan of Dragonball GT, Inuyasha or Gigantor, you'd love this movie.
821;The charcters are rich and well developed, the special effects are hilarious, and the overall action is great.
822;"Once they submitted and pretended not be enduring it, they quickly surrendered that it was ""surprisingly good"" and ""really entertaining""."
823;His films and this one in particular seem to be a perfect hybrid of martial arts, comedy, and fantasy and comic book movies.
824;This movie is not realistic, it is surreal, in a good way, the action scenes are fast, furious and Kung Fu.
825;"kickin' Edition really kicks AXE minus the ""xe"" and add ""ss""."
826;I am a movie buff and I can honestly say this is one of my favorites of all time.
827;My family loved it also!
828;and what a treat it was!
829;And awesome special effects fighting sequences!!
830;This is one of the funniest and most amusing films/movies i've seen in a long time.
831;So excited to own this now and I can watch it when ever I want!
832;This is one of the most original and fun movies I've ever seen!
833;fu, fantasy, and comedy, and it does all of them in great style.
834;"time favorites
835;Stephen Chow's previous film, Shaolin Soccer, was equally hilarious in its mix of the martial arts and sports genres of film.
836;There's great kung fu scenes in here and funny dialogue, and a great cast of characters with some cool lines and actions.
837;I have to say that my favorite character in the entire movie is the landlady.
838;I would have loved to see the cute deaf girl deliver some kung.
839;The 'Palm of Buddha' was an awesome move, and if it were real, wow!
840;Overall a great and funny movie with the right mix of comedy and action.
841;The actions is great and made to be over done but that's what makes this movie cool.
842;It's like watching a cartoon knowing that real people would never survive half the things that happen to the people in this movie, but we accept it because it is funny to see what happens to them, just like in a cartoon.
843;I didn't care too much for the axe gang dancing around, I thought that was kinda dumb, but I did really enjoy this movie.
844;Not much of a plot, but an excellent movie in all other respects.
845;I would have to say that the music is great in it.
846;Especially the opening credits and the dance sequence.
847;The acting is excellent, and I wonder if some of that might have gotten lost in the dubbed version.
848;finally, my wife also liked this movie.
849;She liked it, I think, because of the lady landlord (who kicks it pretty nicely).
850;She also liked the silly humor (which really brought back memories of old Warner Brothers cartoons).
851;There is also a tiny bit of romance.
852;Hilarious in parts and really cool in others, this movie keeps you interested and entertained till the very end.
853;Every time I watch this kung fu comedy, I laugh :) Very interesting characters!
854;The two kung fu masters are very good until they the landlord and landlady come out to confront them.
855;The Beast brings out the truth about who the landlord and landlady are, but Sing may discover things about himself as well.
856;with interesting kung fu choreography enhanced with computer.
857;generated special effects and humor, """"Kung Fu Hustle"""" is entertaining, but some people may find some parts of it a bit too violent."""
858;If you enjoy kung fu films, then you will probably enjoy this entertaining kung fu fantasy by Stephen Chow.
859;Overall, I rate the film with 4 out of 5 stars.
860;enjoyed by several generations of my family, love the slapstick comedy that the US film makers can't seem to get right
861;it turned out to be a very entertaining movie with many funny scenes and some awesome fight scenes.
862;Not only is the score excellent, but the action is good and refreshinly void of wire.
863;This is definantly something worth seeing if you have not already.
864;I'll stick with some of the better actual martial arts movies and keep an eye open for a GOOD martial arts spoof (I think it finally found them inShaolin SoccerandKung Pow .
865;This is one of the best and most entertaining movies out there.
866;It is really funny at times, but the humor is a bit uneven.
867;The biggest drawback to this film is the subtitles.
868;He has yet to really make a name for himself here in America, but there definately is potential.
869;This is one of the funniest movies ever made.
870;I am a huge martial arts fan and I love comedies.
871;This film has a lot of awesome aspects of Kung Fu while being told with some humor and imagination.
872;This film has a lot of flair and style while telling an amazing story and also keeping true to the Kung Fu traditions in cinema.
873;One of my favorite martial arts films!
874;When I saw this movie in the theatre, I laughed until my stomach hurt.
875;The movie is so ingeniously conceived that there are hilarious surprises throughout.
876;The action sequences, both the real ones and the animated ones, are fun to watch.
877;As do many other Stephen Chow movies, this movie tells the bittersweet (yes, somewhat simplistic) story of a downtrodden person, managing to be entertaining along the way.
878;since the laughs are mostly based on action and surprise, its entertainment value diminishes the second time you watch it.
879;Great film that is hilarious and action packed.
880;if you can ignore that, then the rest of the film is perfect.
881;The love story angle isn't too contrived and the ending is nicely done and cute.
882;just got through watching this film&this is the right type of movie to watch on a Saturday Night with some Popcorn.
883;stephen Chow is the truth.
884;enjoyed the Humor,Directing,scenes,Direction,Acting,etc. this is a Cool Film&Very Fresh.
885;Great film with engaging plot and creative cinematography.
886;identity, culture, confidence, and standing up for what you believe.
887;"This Movie is like a live action ""Anime"" it has humour, awesome characters, and is hugely entertaining."
888;I mean he is the Director, Writer, and Star of the movie.
889;I thought it was nice bringing old school high kicker Bruce LIang out of retirement to play the beast.
890;"What are you preparing to do should be ""What are you prepared to do"", the english subtitle translator should have actually done their job properly and learnt english."
891;overall, a very good blu.
892;This is a great movie.
893;anyone with a decent home theater setup owes it to themselves to get the DTS audio version
894;Great movie one of my favorites.
895;This movie is extremely creative with a great message highly recommended.
896;the movie is awesome, where a chump on the streets becomes a hero, with great martial arts actions you should watch
897;I enjoy this movie a lot and the humor just gets better and better the more I watch it.
898;because this movie is hilarious.
899;i would recommend this movie to anybody.
900;this is the best Chinese movie I have ever seen in my entire life.
901;This movie was unique in that i've never seen anything like it, it was totally hilarious and a must have.
902;See Kill Bill it's way better
903;this movie has the action and the comedy that i love some much it is a beautiful movie and i love it so much
904;A great addition to you video library.
905;With the additional scenes and the ability to pause and rewind, the perfect addition to your kung.
906;It's just a pleasure to watch such unique and extremely funny movie.
907;"This movie was surprisingly stunning
908;It was also like a tribute to all the Kung Fu movies.
909;it's just a pleasure to watch such unique and extremely funny movie.
910;This movie was surprisingly stunning"
911;It was also like a tribute to all the Kung Fu movies.
912;stephen Chow is a born comedian to make comedies.
913;He is the writer, director and lead actor of this movie.
914;He knows exactly how to make a great comedy with his talent.
915;The inspirations and creativity that Stephen put into this movie liberalize the limitation of the comedy.
916;It demonstrated that a comedy can still be funny and enjoyable in a special way.
917;the visual are simply amazing because of its action choreography and cinematography.
918;Every movement of this movie is so refreshing and enjoyable.
919;The art direction and costume design are remarkable.
920;if you want to see an unusual but fantastic comedy, please check this one out.
921;I highly recommend this movie all the comedy fans.
922;This movie was full of joys, surprises and laughter.
923;As a high level martial artist I have to say this is the greatest martial arts movie since the Seven Samurai.
924;Even if you don't like Martial Arts genre films, this movie is the one to see!
925;A landlady and landlord want to run their community in peace and QUIET!
926;Practically every form of martial arts, known and unknown, is represented in the film.
927;"The movie is consistently funny, including the ""Looney Tunes"" action sequences."
928;Kung Fu Hustle is over the top, a spoof and fun to watch.
929;Frankly you don't, you just watch it and enjoy.
930;the knife throwing scene is worth the price of the film alone.
931;One day the gang shows up in a small town .
932;the movie was made in an entertaining style that is satirical of decades of martial.
933;this was so close to being a great movie to me.
934;I really liked it and only have one complaint, and it is minor.
935;One of my favorite elements to the movie was the dancing.
936;It was a perfect element to a martial arts movie.
937;the plot is completely outrageous.
938;This movie is cult classic material.
939;Has a lot of slapstick humor, martial arts, and the villains are quite villainous!
940;This movie is a work of pure comic genius, from an unexpected source!
941;This movie is a HOWL!
942;Aside from the great sight gags, he has also assembled a real soupcon of characters, from Rabbit.
943;"One hilarious scene, while he is still a sleazebag, is when he tries terrorizing a poor community that has managed to avoid the wrath of an evil cabal called the ""Axe Gang"", in order to IMPRESS said gang."
944;He calls on a humble lady farmer and dares her to hit him in the stomach, which she does, doubling him over immediately.
945;"The landlady manages to take them out with her patented ""Lion's Roar"", sending them whee."
946;This is, hands down, the funniest, most enjoyable martial arts movie I've seen so far, and I've seen all of Bruce Lee's major releases!
947;None of these things should detract from the fact that this is a really really funny film.
948;best film since the Gods must be crazy and lock stock and two smoking barrels.
949;The plot is nicely woven together.
950;This is one of my favorite movies, and this edition provides some extra footage, as well as some interesting special features.
951;I would highly recommend this film to anyone who's a fan of kung fu movies or comic books.
952;kung Fu Hustle is a showcase of the sheer potential this man has.
953;I loved the characters, and over the top story.
954;A great use of imagination here.
955;Chow is clearly influenced by the great showman ship and scope of the great musicals and love storys of classic hollywood, along with classic chinese theater.
956;Its a brilliant film in terms of its vision and plays out very well.
957;the audience should be encouraged to use some imagination and keep an open heart while watching this, because its truly a fine piece of work from Stephen Chow, if not his best yet.
958;"i loved his earlier work like ""King Of Comedy"", but those were super low budget."
959;i would say that if you love film, and all that moving pictures offer, then i highly recommend this fantastic film thats filled with laughs, love, some epic moments even, and some unique style of camera work and presentation.
960;stephen Chow's world is like a dream come true.
961;Action packed, hilarious, lovable , inspiring and even powerful.
962;this is one of my all time favorite films.
963;Stephen Chow has done a remarkable job in putting together a film that is stripped down to the essentials necessary to tell a remarkable story with a touch of both comedy and dramatic flair.
964;I have watched this film twice now, and intend to watch it several times more.
965;fu movie, but does it with such flair and panache that it's easy to fall in love with it.
966;This is a comedic Kung Fu movie with some flying / air fighting elements in it, as well as comic book style fighting.
967;although I don't usually like movies with flying style moves (save The Iron Monkey), this movie is actually a decent mix of choreographed ground moves, air moves, and comic book style moves.
968;They did a very good job in blending the moves together seemlessly.
969;as far as the plot goes, it is fairly well done.
970;As I stated earlier, this is a comedy, and the jokes are pretty funny, at least to my immature self.
971;"I watched more than a week of commercials for ""Kung Fu Hustle"" on such TV venues as TBS, and figured I'd go, since I can always use a good laugh and don't mind some action as well."
972;My own experience would rate 3.7 stars.
973;This is a funny take on martial arts movies.
974;I love Jackie Chan, Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee, movies but this is my favorite Kung Fu movie of all time.
975;I saw this movie and it was the best foreign movie I've ever seen!
976;subbies and It was hilarious!!!
977;It stars Stephen Chow (who was in Shaolin Soccer) and it has a great cast!!!!!
978;But this was a great show.
979;But overall, It was a great movie.
980;Great cast, great kung fu, and great comedy.
981;I would definitely recommend this for anyone who likes foreign martial arts movies.
982;It's a crazy story, but oh so funny!!!
983;in my opinion this movie is great.
984;it was very funny and surprisingly this movies martial arts was nothing short of amazing.
985;The only thing I'm going to say is that this is one of funniest movies I've ever seen and after 20 viewings it still cracks me up.
986;toons style comedy and action are great.
987;This film was definitely a surprise to me and my friends.
988;Every once in a while, you stumble across a movie that is surprising in its ability to entertain.
989;Taking both in simultaneously only adds to the hilarity of an already tumultously funny film.
990;What Stephen Chow has managed to do in both SHAOLIN SOCCER and KUNG FU HUSTLE is take the silliness and raise it to the nth degree, creating some of the most marvelous parodies that I have ever seen.
991;Still, the film has a believable period feel despite this.
992;The rest of the film consists of escalations in kung fun mastery as the Axe Gang brings in their own kung fu masters, until the end when one individual proves to be the greatest kung fun master of all.
993;it should be noted that the two most elaborate fight scenes were directed by the great Sammo Hung, the legendary Hong Kong star and director perhaps best known in the United States for his highly underrated television series MARTIAL LAW.
994;i think this film will appeal both to fans of Hong Kong cinema and to fans of the more surreal shaolin films.
995;If you enjoyed CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON or HERO, you would probably enjoy this highly accomplished parody.
996;but hang in there 'till the end and it all comes together!Otherwise good acting, decent script, great cast and decent martial arts.
997;"The stylish and stylized ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is, as its name implies, a goofy martial arts parody done with rare good humor and a keen sense of the absurd."
998;The razor sharp editing and multi.
999;also contribute immeasurably to the surrealistic tone of the film.
1000;"it's true that ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is definitely an acquired taste, and to those who are not aficionados of the art form, much of the movie can seem repetitive and silly."
1001;see for diehard fans of the martial arts.
1002;As a majority of the other reviews state, this is a wonderful movie.
1003;Stephen Chow is a genius, be sure to catch other films he has both directed and starred in, such as Shaolin Soccer.
1004;Watch it in Chinese with English subtitles first!It's one thing to adjust the script so that the voice.
1005;The movie's original Chinese script, which is translated nicely in the English subtitles, is what you were intended to see.
1006;the original Chinese audio is superb, and the actors are wonderful.
1007;The subtitles are simple and easy to follow.
1008;For those of you who have seen and liked Shaolin Soccer, please let me recommend that you also see Kung Fu Hustle.
1009;It has some great comedy in the form of references to Looney Tunes and various pop references scattered throughout the entire movie.
1010;The martial arts and special effects for the movie are top notch as well.
1011;All in all I feel this would make a great addition to any martial arts.
1012;I'll leave IMDB to tell you about the movie.
1013;Awesome movie, highly recommended if you like comedy, action with a bit of musicals and romance mixed in.
1014;I really loved how the greatest warriors in the movies all look like Chinese trailer park denizens lol
1015;This movie is funny, clear and simple.
1016;The actors played their roles' and delivered.
1017;An enjoyable must see movie.
1018;"game showdowns of heroes versus villians, ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is stupendously silly but fun, fun, fun!Directed by Stephen Chow, this movie is a great crowd."
1019;pleasure that captures the logic.
1020;What you get it is a fantastic, quirky movie that is paradoxically trashy and pure fun at the same time.
1021;Knowing what to expect before viewing it should be underway, as it is a movie that not only defies gravity but the reasoning power of a logical brain.
1022;"In other words, not exactly a calibre to be nominated for this year's Oscar's ""Best International Movie"" award, but nonetheless should be and should also win because it is perfection."
1023;star Texas steak, but the most delicious hamburger you'd ever had.
1024;It knows its stupid, but it is earnest, loving and delicate.
1025;This is kind of a film that you should appreciate for what it really is.
1026;top and giddily energized to the max, there is an element of an operatic musical movie during its fight sequences because of the eloquence of the soundtrack and how it accompanies the moves of the characters so rightly, and sprinkles of an engaging and heartfelt, albeit predictable, romance halfway throughout the film.
1027;i've seen alot of kung fu flicks and this one is my new favorite.
1028;there was also alot of comedy which I enjoyed.
1029;If you think he is funny in this movie you'll be surprised at how much more hiliarious he usually is because this is considered one of his more dramatic roles!
1030;"Fans should check out ""God of cookery"" which can easily translate to western audiences."
1031;Royal Tramp and the sequel are classics and my personal favorites although I would recommend those for adventurous viewers.
1032;props also to Yeun Wo Ping for the choreography, the acting is really good and the soundtrack is well put together.
1033;This movie has a very stylish look with vivid colors and surprisingly good CGI.
1034;The subtitles are also very well translated.
1035;i am happy that Stephen Chow is finally getting the recognition that he deserves because he is truly a comedic genius.
1036;And now a great director, writer and producer as well.
1037;keep up the good work Stephen!
1038;Great casting!I loved this movie.
1039;From the perspective of a beginning movie maker (amateur), this movie was breathtaking.
1040;I loved the camera angles, costumes, props, and the action scenes.
1041;This is a really well done movie.
1042;this is also the first movie I watch on my blu.
1043;The image was amazingly clear and crisp.
1044;You'll see a big difference from one format to another (I actually have all three players and did this test on the same Sony Bravia).
1045;in this movie you will find comedy, action, gore (lots of blood, but tastefully and comically done), and just pure entertainment.
1046;The movie is also philosophical, and ends with a touching romantic scene.
1047;Just beautiful!Just as a note for those interested, many actors are fighting high definition.
1048;up, lenses, or touching the image during editing.
1049;I firmly believe Stephen Chow's intention was purely to have fun with this movie.
1050;It could have come off as grandiose and silly but instead it is a spectacle.
1051;fest, thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.
1052;I laughed harder than I had done in a long time.
1053;I loved the dance by the Axe Gang and the general kung fu choreography.
1054;The CGI effects are first rate.
1055;Kung Fu Hustle is the most beautifully crafted of my three favorite Stephen Chow's films .
1056;"Comedy, martial arts and traditional Chinese fairy tale are all rolled up together in Chow's hilarious, inventive and masterfully told tale, ""Kung Fu Hustle."""
1057;If you're not familiar with Stephen Chow's enormous talent, you're in for a big treat.
1058;chow's leads, always played by himself, most resemble Charlie Chapman's characters.
1059;characters that are inept yet endearing and enduring.
1060;When finally faced with evil personified, the hero's true spirit emerges.
1061;this movie is wonderful entertainment for all ages.
1062;Stephen Chow is one of the best filmmakers of today.
1063;He pays equal attention to every aspect of filmmaking .
1064;Every character is unique and distinct.
1065;He works against the expected.
1066;In one very funny chase scene, he uses classical music instead of typically comic music.
1067;I've seen this movie many times and I never cease to marvel at his ingenuity, complexity and originality.
1068;as a bonus, his story is powerfully optimistic.
1069;It shows us that fighting courageously for the good, and to be truly yourself, can elevate you to heights you never dreamed of (really!)
1070;That the least among us may carry hidden greatness.
1071;That together we can win against enormous odds.
1072;That once we understand who we really are, and what we are here to give, love will be ours.
1073;And, last but not least, that we can laugh at ourselves along the way.
1074;great movie, would recommend it to anyone that has not seen it.
1075;This movie is fun and hilarious.
1076;It's a funny martial arts movie.
1077;This movie has a great storyline and plot.
1078;The wardrobe, make up, and sets are very good for a movie of this type.
1079;This is a classic movie to own, and it's great entertainment.
1080;Movies like this are highly unique and rare.
1081;it's a must have and own.
1082;This, like Shaolin Soccer before it, is an absurdly funny movie.
1083;My family and i can watch this movie over and over again.
1084;Makes it very clear and realistic looking when watching on our tv screen.
1085;The original Chinese dialog with English subtitles is much more enjoyable and entertaining than the poorly dubbed English dialog.
1086;the characters are matrial arts superheroes with special powers that have some very well choreographed fight scenes.
1087;The night battle with the musicians is awesome.
1088;There are also sequences that mimic the Matrix.
1089;there are many scenes that imitate the Road Runner and Coyote.
1090;But one of the funniest sequences is how to try to keep a snake from biting you.
1091;The extra footage and behind the scenes and enlightening and provide a fun way to learn how the movie was developed, actors selected, and movie filmed.
1092;The behind the scenes footage is really informative, but the dialog is in Chinese, thank goodness for subtitles.
1093;the classical Chinese string instruments and orchestra really make this movie more authentic to it's 1930's theme.
1094;this movie has something for every one.
1095;land lady, played by Yuen Qie, is hilarious!
1096;If you enjoy martial arts movies and have a sense of humor I think you will love it.
1097;a lot of it is a spoof on action movies and/or the old kung.
1098;That said the fight choreography is excellent.
1099;fu movies on the weekends growing up you will appreciate the movie even more.
1100;Even my wife who is normally into these kinds of movies liked it.
1101;Fun action sequences, and a great story.
1102;"On the recommendation of a friend, I picked up Stephen Chow's ""Kung."
1103;It's a martial arts comedy, he said.
1104;selling a product I've ever come across.
1105;"fu Hustle"" contains the most surprising, you'll."
1106;"some movies, such as Stanley Tucci's ""Big Night,"" just make you smile with their tone and general warmth."
1107;A wonderful addition to the film library.
1108;The action sequences, while a little too often fanciful, were very impressive, even innovative.
1109;Chow is a talented guy.
1110;If you like martial arts/action/weird comedy, you'll love this.
1111;I thought it surpassed Lord of the Rings in action and imaginative and special effects, which I thought was fantastic.
1112;First rate cinematography and direction, slap stick jokes that seem fresh, even some subtle sexy stuff, with out that or the violence seeming gratuitous.
1113;Maybe not for the narrow minded, but this is one of the best movies ever made, in my opinion.
1114;stephen Chow is the master of Kung Fu Comedies.
1115;His distinctive style of absurd/cartoony violence and action sequences are portrayed in a world requiring a bit more suspension of disbelief than might normally be expected, but I assure you it's well worth the minimal effort.
1116;i saw opening the movie with it's original Chinese soundtrack and English subtitles as a pretty ballsy move on the part of the producers and distributors.
1117;i was really praying for this movie to be well received at the box office in the U. s., but I'm sure Stephen Chow will be able to continue making his movies regardless of the outcome.
1118;on director Stephen Chow's genius.
1119;one of the visual storytelling devices that I wanted to comment on was at the end of the film.
1120;The ease with which this final scene plays out is truly brilliant.
1121;All the fights are great to watch.
1122;You love them because you share in there triumph over evil and their struggle in defending their true love.
1123;stephen Chow has taken all of the plots and twisted them lovingly into hilarity.
1124;it is a parody in which it is evident that it was made out of love for the genre.
1125;the camera shots are crazy and the fight scenes are some of the best ever shot.
1126;It will, without a doubt, become a favorite.
1127;it was very good since the special effects were nice.
1128;and i kept laughing from beginning to end.
1129;Stephen Chow's latest movie is his best yet.
1130;This movie is one of the funniest movies that I have recently seen.
1131;The movie is very funny in its own way.
1132;All the residents of town, know martial arts and have some special skills.
1133;Kung Fu Hustle is one of these movies, in my humble opinion this movie is completely beautiful blending many genres, approaching the human condition with a relatable yet light hearted approach.
1134;I honestly love this movie, and yeah it did make me laugh and cry, sometimes at the same time.
1135;I primarly bought this because it has the original Chinese language audio.
1136;A very good movie with lots of action and humor.
1137;funny and cool fight scenes, good philosophy and imagery too.
1138;The best Chinese spaghetti western ever!
1139;It's way offbeat, but it was really funny.
1140;I've watched this several times over and introduced many a friend to it.
1141;Kung Fu Hustle is hilarious!
1142;just give it a chance .
1143;I have a feeling if you have any sense of humor .
1144;this is a movie you will enjoy!
1145;The visuals, the story line (if you're a kung.
1146;This is by far, the most exciting and one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen.
1147;i'm going to give few of my points about how serious this movie is made, behind its funny and cartoonish look.1.
1148;Story line is easy to follow and easy to understand, but actually its structure is more complicate than most people thought.
1149;And the hearty love story pined 3 parts together and gives the ending.
1150;Very clever and well constructed.2.
1151;"For example, when the two musician assassins first tuning their instrument, you notice small things in surrounding start to ""off"", and as the music goes to intense, you realize the potential of its power."
1152;Music in the movie is well composed.
1153;At the beginning of movie, it feels like the Axe Gang are very success and laughing at others.
1154;But when they are defeated by two masters and Brother Sum's hair is on fire in the midle of the film, the music sounds extremely funny like laughing at themselves.
1155;So this is all I want to say.
1156;So leasten to Chinese is better since the camera will guide you most of the time, and the subtitle is easy to read.
1157;fu movie I've ever seen, Kung Fu Hustle is loaded with effects and humor, and stunning fight sequences to boot.
1158;The fight scenes in Hustle are every bit as good as any of those movies, but it has a plot unlike any of those movies.
1159;A plot, in my opinion that is BETTER than any of those movies.Yes, `Hustle' is funny, an amazing accomplishment across the usually insurmountable language and cultural barriers between China and the West (which made Bruce Lee's movies unintentionally funny at the wrong times and for the wrong reasons, and made intended funny scenes fall flat with Western audiences), but also a movie with a great historical message.
1160;The unwitting viewer is receiving a history lesson while being entertained by great plot and action sequences.
1161;The movie is greatly entertaining without being even a tiny bit preachy.
1162;"just your basic Good vs. Evil with a unique twist, plus a great romance to boot!During the first half of the 20th Century, China was run by corrupt regional business magnates, often romanticized as ""warlords"", who headed regional criminal business syndicates, often deceptively described as mere ""gangs""."
1163;Sing, the unlikely hero fantastically played by Stephen Chow, becomes transformed during the course of the movie as the embodiment of Good.
1164;kung Fu Hustle was one of the few movies I've seen that was so damn good I had to watch it several times in a row.
1165;"I was impressed with the many running themes
1166;The english subtitles were easy to read, essentially allowing the viewer to place the setting, and also creating more believable characters.
1167;i recommend this movie to anyone who favors wit, to anyone who likes Matrix.
1168;oh my lord i dont understand not abit of chinese but this movie is to funny.
1169;Its such a unique spin on a parody style kung fu movie.
1170;Its like mortal kombat meets scary movie.
1171;Definitely one of my favorite movies.
1172;For one, it is Stephen Chow's best movie hands down .
1173;Shaolin Soccer and God of Cookery while fun, can NOT hold a candle.
1174;This movie has truly earned the 5 stars given!
1175;Kung Fu (or Kung Fu Hustle as I understand the title is open to debate) is a terrifically fun movie to watch.
1176;The comedy is not quite so prevalent as in Shaolin Soccer and there is a darker side to this movie with more violence, but it is so thoroughly engaging and entertaining that I could watch it over and over and over.
1177;stephen Chow brings the goods"
1178;stop action packed darkly comedic delight.
1179;how movies like this go unnoticed while tripe like Rush Hour gets made ad nauseum is a mystery to me, but if you enjoy this genre, you will love this movie.
1180;The story of an unassuming Kung Fu Master who battles a great evil and finds the love of his life.
1181;this movie will become a classic i'm sure.
1182;it's a really funny movie with excellent special effects.
1183;"classic ""kung fu"" stuff with a little extra!"
1184;With the supporting cast and the high paced action followed by insane thought out story lines this movie is one that you can watch over and over.
1185;This one was just well.
1186;Try Kung Pow Enter the Fist, it's better and the characters talk in English!!!!!
1187;It was recommended to me by a workmate who just loved it.
1188;evaluate your life mission and do some serious soul searching.
1189;This movie isn't expected to be taken seriously, but to watch and feast on it's visual charms, and quirky Asian humor.
1190;Stephen Chow does a great job pulling you in.
1191;The fights are original and exaggerated, which is perfect from the typical fighting found in most action films.
1192;i gotta say, my expectations for this movie were great, but in some ways I felt let down after watching it.
1193;But it's good for what it is.
1194;Gotta love the score for this, too.
1195;If that combination makes you laugh then you will undoubtably love this movie.
1196;It's a wonderful beginning, showing the dichotomy of a ruthless gang that dances like they belong in a musical.
1197;They all have motives, sometimes hidden, and it makes watching them quite humorous.
1198;but what Kung Fu Hustle does best is play with the martial arts conventions.
1199;But unlike some Wuxia films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, they are taken to the extreme as a sort of satire of the genre while at the same time embracing everything wonderful about those films.
1200;The martial arts are spot on, having been done by the wonderful choreographer of The Matrix and Kill Bill Woo.
1201;Yet unlike those films and again in touch with the style of the movie, the action is playful.
1202;In fact, Stephen Chow incorporates a lot of homages to American Cinema with quotes in line with Spider Man and the Matrix and even a sound sampling from the Matrix in a couple scenes.
1203;overall a terrific film that incorporates Oriental cinema with Western cinema.
1204;Brilliantly shot, written and acted, it successfully merges many totally disparate genres into a movie that satirizes, makes homages to, and transcends the martial arts genres.
1205;Absolutely wonderful a must see for all fans.
1206;Got this as a gift for my older boy who had put it on his wish list.
1207;Keep it in its original recorded state for a good laugh!
1208;When the residents of the tenement stand up to fight him, he reveals that he is part of the Axe Gang and signals for help.
1209;Kung Fu Hustle, written and directed by the star, Stephen Chow, is a fun, exhilarating, fast.
1210;paced film, borrowing elements from and paying homage to many other genres.
1211;"Chow is clearly a filmmaker who loves films
1212;Hustle combines all of these elements in a way that is fresh and exciting.
1213;When the opposing sides face off on a dusty road, we are transported from Shanghai to the Wild West.
1214;Of course, we aren't in the Old West and the leader of the Axe Gang uses an axe to prove his point and keep us firmly rooted in the world of kung.
1215;They will do anything to protect their lives and friends.
1216;This leads to a series of amusing, entertaining fights, in which their skills are comically enhanced by special effects.
1217;Chow deftly blends all of these elements together making them appear somehow natural.
1218;Amazing considering all of the special effects, cartoon style action and over the top acting.
1219;In """"Hustle"""", they come together to create a fun, enjoyable film that will hopefully spur filmmakers to come up with more creative ways to tell a story."""
1220;ray version and watched it again and enjoyed it very much.
1221;A good addition to your comedy collection.
1222;It's funny, filled with kung fu style antics and it's even got a love story tucked away in the background for you sappy types.
1223;inlaw was very pleased with this, Him and my Daughter could wait to get home and watch it.
1224;Great movie to add to my ever growing collection.
1225;you have to see this to believe it honestly.
1226;this is the perfect film to demonstrate High def to yr neighbours.
1227;top special effects, the cheesiness, and other nuisances, I enjoyed the film quite a bit.
1228;That would be because the characters were interesting, it was really funny, and I cared about the characters.
1229;A lot of old Kung fu geniuses in the 60s and 70s did a lot more with a lot less in making an effective martial arts movie.
1230;His other movie Shaolin Soccer about the Kung Fu master trying to find a life's purpose and does so by incorperating Kung Fu into Soccer was a good story and quite funny.
1231;I really enjoyed the story a lot more in this installment.
1232;The scenery for the time period was done well and the comedy was not overpowering but just right.
1233;If you've seen some of his other films this one may shock just a little when serious parts occur but this film is nevertheless one that is done quite well and should be given a good review for it.
1234;And look, the film is credited with TWO choreographers .
1235;What he didn't know was, the people are much, much more strong and resourceful than he expected.
1236;You see several references to other films, but the film's greatest merit is not them.
1237;[ACTIONS] For Stephen Chow shows unexpectedly exciting fight sequences between the unique characters .
1238;and Chow is better than Keanu!
1239;but it is the extraordinary supporting actors that really are rivetting.
1240;smoking wife landlady by Yuen Qiu (coming back to screen after almost 30 years) are real scene stealer, always surprising us with their outrageous personalities.
1241;hu star during the 70s, and comes back to movie after 15 year hietus) whose initial appearance as a bald and plump middle.
1242;It is still a comedy, and it is often funny, but perhaps you should see it as an action film .
1243;So, my advice: Don't think, just feel, and enjoy yourself.
1244;The latest movie from the very talented Stephen Chow is really funny, well made and most importantly inspired and unique.
1245;this movie has great CG and a highly stylish look.
1246;The acting from the landlady, landlord, Sing and his sidekick are very good with the landlady stealing almost all her scenes.
1247;The soundtrack is very good as well.
1248;as an English and Cantonese speaker I can say with some confidence that the subtitles are the best that I've seen, capturing the right meaning and tone.
1249;I've been a fan of Stephen Chow ever since I was very young and he still has me rolling now at 21 because he knows what's funny.
1250;This movie gives you a little bit of everything action, laughs, drama and love.
1251;It's worth watching because you have never seen anything like this but most of all because it's good.
1252;For a movie that is in Cantonese, it is absolutley hilarious.
1253;Two misfits, dress up and pretend they are part of the Axe Gang thast run the town.
1254;But one of the misfits does not realize that he is also a Kung Fu master and by the end of the movie he has to fight the ultimate evil, and he uses and becomes the Kung Fu Master that he was destined to become.
1255;A very funny movie, that has a sweet ending.
1256;i bought it as a christmas gift for my son.
1257;Sometimes I laughed so hard it was painful.
1258;The fight scenes with wire work and special effects are very effective.
1259;There is also a thread of childhood friendship which adds a sweet note to the film.
1260;(3) The Land Lord and land lady of this locality are superior kung.
1261;He wants to be part of the axe gang.
1262;a novel and insane comic caper with great special effects.
1263;A movie which makes fun of the kungfu genre and at the same time hieghtens this surreal kung fu experience.
1264;This is definitely one of the better action movies I have seen in a long time.
1265;The comedy in the movie is also worth a watch.
1266;Stephen Chow tells a great story with absolutely amazing special effects.
1267;from the opening sequence, you are drawn to the plot and Stephen's portrayal of his character is first.
1268;His tribute to Bruce lee is evident throughout the film.
1269;this is definitely a MUST WATCH for all!
1270;It did but I was very surprised that they edited certain shots.
1271;If originality means 'unlike anything you've seen', Kung Fu Hustle certainly rates on top of the category.
1272;Against this backdrop, an increasingly powerful, exotic, and inventive array of martial artists line up on either side of the escalating tension between the Axe gang and Sing's slum.
1273;kung Fu Hustle is full of twists and turns, witty satire on martial arts movie, and amazing special effects.
1274;This movie was a combination of The Matrix, Enter the Dragon, and I'm Gonna Get You Sucka.
1275;The makers of this movie are brilliant.
1276;It had a funny plot.
1277;I loved seeing the kung fu fights using modern technology.
1278;This is an outrageously funny parody of every martial arts movie you've ever seen (though none in particular).
1279;If you thought Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a bit over the top, you'll love this movie.
1280;The film is funny at many parts, though the entire plot is serious.
1281;The action is great, and the axe gang is unwittingly similar to the Mr. Smith clones in the matrx.
1282;Overall, great choreorgraphy and special effects on the martial arts.
1283;Nonetheless, the film is still very funny and great parts.
1284;Having seen Stephen Chow gone from goofy TV star in the late '80s, to becoming the king of comedy of Hong Kong with a long list of box office hits since the early '90s, it's great to see him combining jokes, outlandish special effects, and Kung Fu in this film that is by far his most entertaining work, even better than Shaolin Soccer.
1285;This is no doubt Granddaddy Sing's(his nickname) most ambitious movie, since it had already conquered the box office in all Chinese cinemas as well in most Asian countries.
1286;There are some very powerful retired masters of Kung Fu Warriors living as normal residents in The Pig Sty Alley.
1287;As for The Landlady, she can ran like a motorcycle, and her ultimate power is her voice(a skill known as The Lion's Roar).
1288;The Beast was known to be the best of the best in the world of kung fu, and he was in the Assylum because he had defeated everyone already.
1289;They thought they were the best in kung fu, and now they have to face the enemy of a life time.
1290;Who will save them if they failed?Wah Yuen(Landlord) and Qiu Yuen(Landlady) are very good together, and they delivered the laughs and great battle scenes.
1291;Qiu Yuen is actually very striking, espeically when she had the funniest lines and a outrageous personality.
1292;The Lollipop Girl was unerexposed here, and I was expecting to see her practicing some special candy power, but she's just Sing's love interest.
1293;The action direction from renowned martial arts veteran Yuen Woo Ping certainly made the fight scenes over.
1294;Along with a ton of special effects, it's very captivating, even if it looked kind of cartoonish at times.
1295;He's more serious, and his fight scenes have improved a great deal, considered that he's not an action star.
1296;What can i say this a funny, violent , comedy with lots of special effects and raw slum cinematics.
1297;it was bold, very funny and definitely violent, it's not a true classic to me because it lacks true story telling substance however, if you love a movie mainly for entertainment well this might be your bag, i rate it a four stars because it has replay value and it extremely funny, i think it's definetly worth looking at for a change laters folks.
1298;Better fights scenes than The Matrix.
1299;Better attitude than Men in Black.
1300;Better chase scenes than Roadrunner and Coyote.
1301;Better dialog than the Three Stooges.
1302;Went in not knowing what to expect and left a very happy movie goer.
1303;Great special effects and wild imagery.
1304;Have watched it multiple times, since then and it keeps getting better.
1305;Have highly recommended it to others.
1306;My favorite movie of last year.
1307;Kung Fu Hustle is among my favorite films, not because I am a die.
1308;hard fan of Stephen Chow, but because I really liked the wild mix of comedy, adventure, crime caper and martial arts action.
1309;Most notably the excellent fight choreography by legendary Yuen Woo.
1310;"Mr. Poo makes an appearance!Scene 4
1311;The Picture is extremely sharp with solid Black levels.
1312;But the transfer is clean and nice.
1313;audio commentaryCLOSING: Kung Fu Hustle is one of the more entertaining (if not the most fun in 2004) imports.
1314;hitting action while maintaining a profound respect for the spirit of Kung Fu.
1315;One of the most perfect movies ever made, just got a little better.
1316;If you've never seen Kung Fu Hustle, SEE IT!
1317;(Like the Oscar winning """"No Country For Old Men"""" for example)."""
1318;Bottom line, if you like fun and awesomeness you will love Kung Fu Hustle.
1319;While they typically displayed some very enjoyable if goofy martial arts scenes, much of the humor was lost on Western audiences.
1320;The movies probably played very well to the original Asian audiences.
1321;Everybody I saw it with in the theater was laughing their heads off for a majority of the run time.
1322;Suffice if to say, the comedy works with full force.
1323;in addition, the martial arts scenes are fantastic.
1324;"As comical as the movie can be, some of the fight scenes were pure art (the one with the ""instrument"" struck me in particular)."
1325;I found this to be a strength rather than a weakness.
1326;"I was so wrapped up in enjoying every scene as it came
1327;stephen Chow has been funny in the past, but his work has reached a new level.
1328;This is a movie that all audiences should enjoy.
1329;I'm seriously chomping at the bit for a chance to go see it again.
1330;Good mixture of Kung Fu Fighting and comedy.
1331;Some of the funniest concepts and scenes I have ever seen.
1332;Classic schmaltzy KungFu undiscovered master with a devastatingly funny twist!
1333;The version I first viewed was the early pre.
1334;I watch it at least once a year and I still laugh out loud through most of the movie.
1335;I thoroughly enjoy this movie time after time after time after time!
1336;Great fantasy fight scenes, really funny and really well developed comical characters with some really clever twists!
1337;This disk has very good (above average) video transfer, but what really shines is its Chinese uncompressed PCM audio track.
1338;wise, I like the art directions and the special effects.
1339;I love this movie so much!
1340;It's got the typical stephen chow style """"mo lei tao (nonesense)"""" humor that's made him the most popular actor in all of China, and combined with gorgeous kungfu fight scenes, this just screams a good time :."""
1341;The fight scenes are funny, original, and well executed.
1342;This will always be one of my favorite movies because of the mix of two great genres.
1343;It takes you into this bizarre world that is so surreal, sometimes dream sometimes nightmare.
