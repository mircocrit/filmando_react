id;spiegazione
1;I consider this movie to be the best of the Hitchcock masterpieces.
2;It's almost as difficult as choosing my favorite Miles Davis song, but this movie is very well done.
3;The acting is head and shoulders above other suspenseful flicks of that age, and to tell you the truth, I LONG for these type movies these days.
4;This movie makes me VERY aware of the cinematic cues, from lighters to shoes to glasses in the grass, it ALL comes together to form a timeless piece of cinema excellence!
5;but there is so much visually and psychologically to like about this film.
6;The three best visuals for me .
7;for their composition and style .
8;there is a tree beside the curb.
9;the tree and the street and the building are wonderfully haunting in the position of the camera and the light and shadow effect.
10;this is the time in the film when the actor Farley Granger's face is at its maximum of good looks.
11;the effect of light and shadow on his attractive face is very pleasing.
12;the silent, enigmatic great Dane dog waiting at the top of the stairs.
13;since I am a strong fan of the visual beauty and style (if not the themes) of the film version of The Talented Mr. Ripley , it is instructive to watch that film and this one in sequence.
14;but the visual similarities and executions in the two films are extremely interesting to study as well.
15;Strangers on a Train is a film I can watch over and over again.
16;and the music with its jazzy hint of mockery at the implied gay character.
17;all in all, this is an excellent film for repeated viewing, close scrutiny, and multiple enjoyment.
18;[This shows popular entertainment before television.]
19;And Bruno carries out his self.
20;There is humor in the Senator's remarks.
21;There is a funny scene at the tennis club where people's heads move mechanically, except for one man.
22;The watching detectives also see that something funny is going on.
23;There is a surprise here!
24;Ann visits Bruno's mother, but little is accomplished.
25;There is a dramatic finish to the ride, and the truth is discovered at last when it slips from Bruno's hand.You can pick out some faults in this story, but it seems quite good with its mixture of drama, suspense, and humor.
26;Murder by organized crime is seldom solved by the police said Perry Mason.
27;Psycho definitely has its merits, and is one of the greatest films of all.
28;time, but Strangers on a Train, in my opinion, is a much more complete, meaningful film than Psycho was.
29;strangers on a Train has some of the most memorable scenes in the history of cinema.
30;While there are many things that one can think about Bruno's bizarre obsession with Guy, I prefer to view the film just for the classic thrilller that it is.
31;Maybe in future viewings I will analyze the characters' actions in the film on a much deeper level, but I think that it is important that the film is such a great thriller, but also with much deeper meanings that can be explored if the viewer desires to do so.
32;On the other hand, well.
33;done remakes are so rare in Hollywood, that you can count them on one hand.
34;Overall, I think this is one of those films that is simply timeless.
35;Fifty years after it was made, it still works as a film, and it isn't very often that you find a film like this that can stand the test of time in literally every facet of what makes a good film.
36;Entertainment, great acting, great writing, great directing, and meaning will make a good movie, no matter how old it is.
37;Hitchcock is in top form .
38;the elements of intrigue and suspense are heightened leaving the viewer with a sense of tourture as you await the film's climax.
39;The last twenty minutes is a nail biter!
40;From the very first shot of this classic chiller, we are aware we're in the hands of a master.
41;the plot of this Patricia Highsmith novel is well.
42;hitchcock steadily rachets up the tension, aided by a brilliant performance by Robert Walker as Bruno, the creepy psychopath at the heart of the movie.
43;the photography is stunning .
44;It's one of the great scenes in the history of cinema.
45;Anyone who loves movies must see this.
46;And it spawned many interpretations, though none quite so well written.
47;Recommended for those discriminating movie buffs.
48;Terrific suspense, one of Hitchcock's best!
49;The pure tension keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end!
50;One of my favorites, I highly recommend it!!
51;Guy, as a return favor will do away with Bruno's father.
52;Pretty disappointed to have this issue, but this movie is so great!
53;Let's give credit to the brilliant Patricia Highsmith who wrote the book, Strangers on a Train.
54;, etc, and one of the most darkly funny books
55;It is interesting to see how Strangers on a Train was adapted by herself and Chandler for the screen.
56;Farley Granger is a little cleaner than Highsmith's protagonist, but Robert Wagner is the very soul of the character who worms his nasty way into your heart.
57;It was fast paced, a good black and white film.
58;Good twists and turns, acting was a little dramatic.
59;The players were perfect for their roles.
60;Kudos to those who chose the cast.
61;Mr. hitchcock showed his genius as usual in this picture without any use of questionable situations or dialogue.
62;I recommend this film to all suspense buffs.
63;The more commonly viewed American release as well as a slightly longer British version.
64;The print is decent on both, and the movie plot is a classic.
65;Before Norman Bates ever graced the scene, Hitchcock gave us Bruno Anthony with a very real mother fixation!
66;Everyone is wonderful in their roles, especially Robert Walker, and, although she only has a few scenes, a very funny Marion Lorne as his mother.
67;After a slightly slow start, the film becomes very intense.
68;Classic Hitchcock touches are all through this movie.
69;The way Hitch singles out Bruno in the crowd at the tennis match is brilliant!
70;This movie is a must, for no other reason than to see the nail.
71;Gotta be one of my top Hitchcock films.
72;i want to say that when I first saw this movie I really loved it
73;I thought that it was suspenseful and chilling and hit all the right notes.
74;Many could look at this statement and say then why did you give a film like `The Shining' such a high rating?
75;Well, the answer (as I mentioned in my review of the film) is that Kubrick created his very own vision, while still staying true to King's vision.
76;There are many alterations made within this film, liberties taken that drastically shift the intentions of Highsmith's vastly superior novel.
77;the first change I noticed came in the form of Guy's occupation.
78;He is famous, widely known and successful.
79;The fact that Bruno blackmails Guy into following through with their `plan' is much more believable when you consider Guy's situation within the novel.
80;I should have know that Hitchcock would not have wanted to keep Highsmith's original ending, for it just does not feel like something the master of suspense would want to do, but I wish he had, for his talent would have really done something special with Highsmith's intelligent conclusion.
81;the acting is, for the most part, very good and so it does elevate the film for me.
82;Robert Walker was flawless as Bruno, and I hear that his performance is even greater in the uncut version for he is allowed to devour the character to a fuller degree.
83;Ruth Roman and Kasey Rogers have great scene stealing turns here as the two women in Guy's life, and Marion Lorne adds a few layers to Bruno's character as she eats up her portrayal of Bruno's mother.
84;This little known Alfred Hitchcock movie has a chilling plot and on the edge of your seat action.
85;Nevertheless I think this is one of his best.
86;It is a great movie and captures the attention until the very end!
87;This was my first Hitchcock film and I must say, it was pretty good.
88;Strangers on a Train was a good movie, but it certainly wasn't one of Hitchcock's best.
89;A taut story by the brilliant Patricia Highsmith and the gorgeous Farley Granger (his smile will make you melt) directed by the master (even if he was a bit of a sadist).
90;One of the most memorable sociopaths in cinema (and there are a lot of them).
91;A high point in film noir.
92;And the stranger he meets (forget his name) is so perfectly balanced against his comprimised innocence.
93;The villain is highly entertaining in the way that classic baddies are, yet somehow is believable, which is quite a feat when you're playing an over.
94;there are also the classic Hitchcock touches.
95;such as the death scene reflected in the glasses, and a high suspense merry.
96;round (literally) chase scene that is amazing.
97;Listen to the commentary track to hear how that insane scene was filmed.You will watch this one again and again, very much worth purchasing.
98;Guy Haynes is a tennis player with an unfaithful bitch of a wife and a beautiful senator's daughter he intends to marry once his divorce is final.
99;He has a fight with her in the music store where she works, and stalks out.
100;All I will say is watch that merry.
101;I'm partial to Hitchcock, and as I said before, this is one of his best.
102;Has aged really well .
103;still thrilling and suspenseful today.
104;Certainly one of Hitch's best movies.
105;Beautifully shot, with a great premise for suspense, sex.
106;appeal provided by beautiful Ruth Roman.
107;Because of the great premise, you feel like you have to watch it to the end.
108;If you find yourself losing faith in Hitch and doubting his title as the Master of Suspense, i recommend this nice little movie as an antidote.
109;but you'll be able to pick which you like better.
110;This has a premise that's very original.
111;It has an ending that is very destructive and suspenseful.
112;This film also has a lot of style.
113;The scene on the island with the lighter where he looks at the girl's face and holds up the lighter to her it is hauntingly beautiful.
114;Both the US and British versions are essential viewing, and comparison is exciting and challenging.
115;The film is one of Hitchcock's most entertaining and suspensful outings.
116;It offers interest on every level.
117;If you are a Hitchcock fan you must have this in your collection.
118;I loved this movie when it first appeared in theaters and it has lost none of its appeal with the passing years.
119;and snuggle in for an enjoyable movie experience.
120;It is a good story with an original plot conundrum.
121;The opening title is a little soft but from the first scenes thereafter, the contrast of the black and white is very well balanced.
122;This is one of Hitche's films I can watch over and over again.
123;According to Bruno, it's all to be read in the newspapers, especially the gossip concerning Guy's relationship with the daughter of a United States senator, and the ongoing drama with Guy's soon.
124;For his part, Bruno, a rich and spoiled ne'er.
125;What is certain is that Guy, well.
126;the fifties was a decade in which Hitchcock, in my opinion, really flourished.
127;At least it seems that he had a solid string of classics, beginning with Strangers On a Train and lasting through Psycho.
128;It's suspenseful, cleverly written, and wonderfully photographed.
129;Robert Walker easily steals the show as the sly and charming psychopath, Bruno.
130;He's animated, funny, and almost likable when he's not strangling someone, or plotting their demise.
131;As Guy, Farley Granger is stuck in the unenviable shadow of Walker: Guy is a well.
132;She's a steadfast companion for Granger's Guy, and they somehow seem to belong together.
133;And with not much better hair, but a lot more flair and a screen personality to match, Patricia Hitchcock is breezy and fun as Roman's younger sister.
134;She gives a delightful and natural performance as a young woman whose mild flirtation with Bruno encites him to attempt murder.
135;Leo G. Carroll, as the senator, is fine, and it's interesting to note that Marion Lorne (as Bruno's mother) and Laura Elliott (as Guy's ill.
136;for anyone interested in suspense films in general, and Hitchcock, in particular, I highly recommend this film.
137;Hitchcock shows his genius here, he can't help it, and walker gives a great performance, but the plot is very weak, and really must be ignored to enjoy this film.
138;But at least four including Strangers on a Train are excellent.
139;Any fan of classic movies must see this, and for fans of Hitchcock it is a must have.
140;I loved every minute of it.
141;Older movies are really quite good.
142;I've watched a few of Hitchcock's movies and I've loved every one so far.
143;STRANGERS ON A TRAIN is a masterful suspense thriller that displays some of Hitchcock's finest work.
144;layered characters in Bruno, Guy, and each of the side players both through the clever script and his superior use of visual storytelling.
145;Robert Walker and Farley Granger are each fantastic in their respective roles, with Walker demonstrating a calculated fanaticism and Granger playing his innocent and powerless pawn.
146;Miriam's unforgettable death at the hands of Bruno marks the height of STRANGERS' suspense and stylization, and serves as a cinematic milestone.
147;enhancing lighting, to the slow.
148;built tension and great ending.
149;It certainly is worth the one hour and 40 minutes of time it take to watch.
150;It is seamlessly perfect from start to finish.
151;The brilliant character actor Robert Walker, who specialized in villainous roles before his own early death, played Bruno Antony, the villain of this piece.
152;I've read that it is the villain that makes a movie like this work and that is certainly true here.
153;Certainly Bruno is a more fascinating, mesmerizing person than either Guy's sluttish wife or vapid girlfriend.
154;There are so many great scenes in this movie, so many great bit parts, that a viewer could get dizzy listing all of them.
155;I could keep going, the scenes are that good.
156;I listen to old time radio and i am glad that they come out with the movies so you can see the actors and see what they really look like ,on radio you have to guess but that is what makes that so great.
157;A very, very good movie.
158;What makes it so good is the utter credibility of Guy's actions and responses to Bruno's unrelenting push to have him kill his father.
159;That is probably the definition of an exceptional work, that you never tire of it, and that it always tugs at you one way or another.
160;comic relief is supplied by Hitchcock's daughter Patricia, who plays a girl who likes talking about lurid crimes, and thus parodies her father's concern with mystery plots.
161;happy, shoot into a crowd, hit the wrong guy, and show no concern about getting him medical aid .
162;Hitchcock wants us focussed on the merry.
163;Much has been written about this Hitchcock film.
164;this is one of the great masters films that really has to be seen again.
165;just a sample of pure cinema.
166;Hitchcock makes his characters believeable and the quandry of the sympathetic tennis player is well presented.
167;Hitchcock's daughter plays her supporting role with delightfully light and slightly macabre sense of humor.
168;This is a very enjoyable Alfred Hitchcock film.
169;The movie is very stylish and, while not all that suspenseful in my opinion, is well worth your time.
170;Hitchcock's daughter did a wonderful acting job in her father's film.
171;Strangers on a train is among Hitchcock best.
172;The tape is in top condition.
173;All actors and Ruth Roman and her sister in the movie keep you interested.
174;This movie is both sudtle and startling in revealing the underbelly of those attractive people who walk among us harboring malice and death.
175;Grand fun, and the ending will blow you away.
176;Of course, it is great and suspenseful.
177;Very well done and keeps you guessing.
178;I always love looking for his cameo appearance.
179;this is a movie that has great acting and lots of suspense.
180;i highly recommend this movie to any classic movie fans like myself.
181;farley Granger and Robert Walker both give great performances.
182;Alfred Hitchcock loved to plunge ordinary people into extraordinary situations culminating in feverish life or death climaxes, and Strangers On A Train is one of his finest efforts.
183;This film is fantastically atmospheric with a palpable malevolence throughout.
184;It also features unforgettable performances, particularly Robert Walker as Bruno Anthony, a character with a combination of indolence and menace as threatening as any villain ever.
185;There are wonderful trick shots, like the much.
186;discussed strangulation reflected in the glasses.
187;The music, likewise for me, captures the film's aesthetic
188;In an interesting side note, Farley Granger was actually bisexual, while flamboyant Robert Walker was straight and a Mormon.
189;strangers has been universally acclaimed as a classic from its debut.
190;It was nominated by the Academy for Best Black and White cinematography, and Hitchcock was nominated for Best Director by the Directors Guild of America.
191;The point is that she's got the morals and class that Guy's wife lacks, and this contrast works well in the film.
192;strangers is well crafted at every level, and the suspense screams to a stunning climax where Bruno almost succeeds in pinning the blame on Guy before his brutal death.
193;(Norman Bates' mother is pretty good too!)
194;Strangers On A Train, the 1951 black and white film by Alfred Hitchcock, is a damned good movie.
195;strangers On A Train includes many recurring Hitchcockian themes.
196;It's a good screenplay, but, as with many Hitchcock films, it's almost all surface.
197;In this sense Hitchcock's reputation as the ultimate puppetmaster is well earned.
198;But, it certainly is a very good film, by any measure, with some deeper subtexts than the script alone entails.
199;Strangers On A Train is almost a definitive, or archetypal, Hitchcock film in that it has all his film canon's glories and flaws.
200;And it is a darkly comic one at that.
201;Robert Walker is excellent as the chilling nutcase, really convincing giving a fascinating performance that is almost too creepy at times.
202;round where any number of innocent could be killed), this still was an intense, enjoyable thriller, one of Alfred Hitchcock's better films.
203;The other man, Bruno Anthony (a wonderful performance by Robert Walker) is a dangerous psychopath (Guy is unaware of this of course) and during their conversation on the train Bruno explains to Guy that he has planned the perfect murder .
204;Guy has an important tennis tournament to play in and sure enough Bruno turns up in the crowd with his eyes only on Guy.
205;The suspense builds and Guy finally gets away leading to the dramatic conclusion at the fairground when both men are trapped on an out of control speeding carousel.
206;I'm a very clever fellow.
207;Hitchcock's cameo appearance came early on in the film .
208;This meeting takes the viewer on a cinematic train ride filled with twists, turns and dark passages, until the final destination is reached.
209;everything about this movie is brilliant.
210;Along with Rear Window, this film is Hitchcock at his best!
211;One of my favorite Hitchcock flicks!
212;I first saw this film in a theatre about 20 years ago.
213;The glorious black and white cinematography, Warner Brothers trademark bombastic bass sound, Tiompkin's thrilling soundtrack music.
214;Be prepared to watch it several times to catch everything that's happening behind the scenes .
215;Bruno is a very clever fellow.
216;'Strangers on a Train' is Alfred Hitchcock's first American movie and certainly one of his better ones.
217;Guy is somewhat of a celebrity and Bruno seems to know a lot about his turbulent personal life.
218;this movie is a lot of fun, mainly because Robert Walker does such an outstanding job as this devious sociopathic killer.
219;His performance as the cool and calculated murderer masked by his wealthy, refined and well.
220;His persistence of involving himself by in effect blackmailing and stalking his pseudo partner is also well done.
221;Another fine performance is by Marion Lorne who plays Bruno's mother.
222;Her naivet and constant denial of her son's clear psychological problems is a real treasure to watch.
223;There is also some terrific camera work in this movie, clearly due to the creative genius of Alfred Hitchcock.
224;I was slightly unimpressed with the ending, but overall, its a very entertaining movie.
225;The contrast and sharpness are superb for a movie this old.
226;STRANGERS ON A TRAIN is a wonderful thriller.
227;I am always amazed at the amount of suspense and tension that Hitchcock is able to create in each of his movies.
228;What passes for thrillers these days has none of the heart or excitement of his films and this picture is one of his best.
229;Moreover, if you enjoy Patricia Highsmith's novels (or the films that have been made from them), you will love this film.
230;Yet, at the same time, she manages to breathe life into Bruno Anthony (played by Robert Walker).
231;The rest of the film is a game of cat and mouse between Bruno and Guy and the storytelling is absolutely phenomenal.
232;as always, Hitchcock is at the top of his game.
233;I found myself just marveling at the angles and the composition in this film.
234;His use of lighting (and, of course, the absence of lighting) is absolutely perfect.
235;There is also the famous tennis shot, in which the entire audience is flipping their heads back and forth, keeping up with the game.
236;as you can probably tell, I'm a big fan of Hitchcock.
237;It is widely regarded as one of his best films and it should have a broad appeal.
238;Though Hitchcock was a brilliant director and had some truly great movies to his credit, in my opinion after watching everything he has to offer, his suspense thriller 1951 Strangers on a Train is by far his best work.
239;The movie stars Farley Granger
240;and Ruth Roman plays Senator Morton's daughter (Ann)who he is in love with and plans to marry, if and when, he is able to divorce his wife (Miriam).
241;engaging him in a conversation which involves trading murders.
242;So this was Hitchcock's favorite movie that he ever made?
243;It's important to note two things about this edition of Strangers on a Train.
244;The second thing is, to you widescreen buffs out there (including myself) .
245;This is why this film (and you'll be surprised to hear), many, many classic films will never be produced in widescreen.
246;Granger is talented in this role, evoking sympathy from the audience even when he was guilty as sin in Rope.
247;two men meet and strike up a conversation based on Bruno's (Robert Walker in a chilling performance) ability to recognize Guy Haines (Granger) from the tennis court.
248;By the way, the murder of the wife is some of Hitch's best camera work ever, as he shows the choking in the reflection of the woman's eyeglasses.
249;Bruno keeps on him the whole time, threatening to frame him (Bruno has Guy's lighter that he can plant at the scene), so it becomes a race for Guy to prove his innocence.
250;The scene on the merry go round is a classic, even if a bit unrealistic.
251;the characters are great, the story strong and the direction superb.
252;The great suspense films of today owe a debt of gratitude to Strangers on a Train.
253;STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, starring Farley Granger, is a top.
254;notch suspense thriller of the old school.
255;The plot builds with suspense at every possible twist and turn.
256;The characters are intriguing and never dull.
257;i would also recommend Alfred Hitchcock's 1948 little known film ROPE.
258;It also stars Farley Granger in an almost opposite role as well as the great Jimmy Stewart.
259;I'm not a real Hitchcock fan, but this movie by far is my favorite of anything he's done.
260;The story line, suspense and drama is absolutely first rate.
261;If you want to try a Hitchcock film, this one is it.
262;A lesser known Hitchcock film that is really entertaining.
263;One of my favorite Directors, I own many of his Movies.
264;This is a very good movie.
265;A well written,well acted film [Robert Walkers last]Film Noir at it's finest.
266;Excellent character build up,mixed with humor and rapid fire dialog.
267;seeing this film on the big screen, as I have recently, really illuminated Hitchcock's brilliance
268;Farley Granger is handsome and his look is well.
269;walker, however, really carries the show
270;Anne Morton is beautiful, but Miriam oddly has more sensuality, even with the coke.
271;Pat Hitchcock, the director's daughter, also does a good job as Morton's prim little sister who unfortunately resembles Miriam in the killer's eyes.
272;This is one of Hitchcock's best movies, which means it's one of the best movies period.
273;If you love this movie, this is the edition to get.
274;This was presented to us as part of a Hitchcock unit.
275;Even then, I knew this was an extraordinary film.
276;entendre) are fascinating and chilling.
277;STRANGERS has black humor, and psychologically manipulates the audience.
278;guy (Farley Granger), is a handsome, charismatic tennis star who has a chance meeting with Bruno (Robert Walker), a creepy, manipulative man who meets on.
279;as the story unfolds, you will be hooked to the end.

281;known climaxes ever brought to the screen by the legendary Alfred Hitchcock.
282;child is absolutely stunning, and the creepy tension of the story is wonderfully unnerving.
283;Now Guy is the primary suspect in her murder, and he also has Bruno stalking him with demands that Guy kill his dad.
284;alfred Hitchcock had a special knack for coming up with realistic nightmares .
285;Strangers on a Train has that fun scenario, but adds the extra joy of a celebrity stalker who is trying to force the protagonist to commit murder.
286;is absolute perfection as Bruno.
287;also, Patricia Hitchcock is hilarious.
288;Obviously she had this role because her dad was the director, but she is incredibly funny as a murder.
289;honest teenager (From what I hear she pursued it in all directions).
290;Strangers on a Train has a really weird ending that doesn't match what comes before, but the great performance of Robert Walker and the brilliantly tense story make up for it.
291;Strangers on a Train is that rarity, an Alfred Hitchcock film concerning which one talks about an actor's performance almost as much as the director's.
292;The actor, of course, is Robert Walker, presenting his remarkable portrayal of Bruno Anthony, the rich, unstable man who offers the hero Guy Haines a deadly proposition: he'll kill Guy's wife Miriam (played by the interesting Laura Elliott) if Guy will kill Bruno's father.
293;The character seems to overshadow the entire movie, which is appropriate, because Bruno casts a shadow over the easy, affluent world in which he lives.
294;Farley Granger is atheletic enough to be convincing as a tennis champ, but he has a boyishness which makes the vulnerable aspects of the character believable.
295;The film is filled with the touches one associates with Hitchcock.
296;Others are more subtle: After the murder, Bruno approaches Guy outside Guy's apartment house.
297;Then, after he has told Guy about Miriam's death and Guy is absorbing the shock, a police car pulls up in front of Guy's apartment house and Guy himself ducks behind the gate.
298;Hitchcock was a genius, no doubt about it.
299;the film's mood is enhanced by Dimitri Tiomkin's romantically mysterious score.
300;Hitchcock and Tiomkin worked a couple of more times together but never more effectively than in thisdazzling masterpiece.
301;But he IS a very clever fellow.
302;Bruno is an idle gentleman with a great deal of time on his hands and a lot of odd ideas, like driving at night without his headlights at high speeds, and smelling flowers on Mars.
303;He poses one such idea to Guy .
304;fantastic thriller with a great climax and who knew a tennis game could be so suspenceful?
305;and yes, that's Hitchcock's daughter in the role of Babs (and she's great).
306;Funny story is that her father never once mentioned he was filming `Strangers,' but went through proper channels (her agent) and had her audition like a regular actress for the part!
307;Product shipped promptly, wrapped well, but the last four minutes will not play.
308;Strangers on a Train is just as good, even if it does have lesser known stars.
309;Strangers on a Train is very entertaining .
310;it is suspenseful, clever, even humorous (at times), and has some truly memorable sequences.
311;anyhow, this movie is very cleverly made and very exciting.
312;see it soon and enjoy.
313;I had never seen this Hitchcock movie, and I believe it to be one of his best.

320;strangers On A Train is one of Hitchcock's best films even better than a few of the movies in the set like Family Plot and Topaz and Marnie, Strangers On A Train is Hitchcock at his best and a wonderful, tense, original film and deserves to be in any classic movie/Blu.
321;gripping tell of a psycho who wants revenge at any cost.
322;alfred is great and he always keeps you in suspence
323;I really love this movie.
324;Of course, I am a huge Alfred Hitchcock and Robert Walker fan!
325;If you like Hitchcock, this is classic!
326;psychopath who came up with a brilliant idea of committing a perfect murder .
327;While on a train, Bruno introduces himself to a handsome rising tennis star, Guy (Farley Granger) who is going through a rather nasty public divorce with his unfaithful wife Miriam in order to marry the woman he loves, Anne Morton.
328;Guy hates his wife but would he kill Bruno's dominating father if Bruno murders his wife?One of the most discussed and analyzed Hitchcock's films, Strangers on a train is considered one of the most satisfying thrillers ever.
329;It is based on the early novel by the master of the psychological crime thrillers, Patricia Highsmith and it is a great artistic achievement in the thriller genre due to the masterful and creating Hitchcock's directing.
330;Honestly, I think this film may be the most shockingly bizarre of all Hitchcock's films and it is definitely one of his best and perhaps most underrated.
331;The suspense in this film is unnerving.
332;It is interesting how Hitchcock manipulates your loyalties between the two men.
333;Robert Walker's performance is very unsettling, yet the viewer can almost sympathize with him at certain moments.
334;Dimitri Tiomkin's score is haunting yet full of energy as good must outwit evil in the end and it is a constant reminder of how we often can become confused when emotions often take over reason.
335;We've all heard about how many viewers of PSYCHO developed a fear of taking a shower after taking in that film, well, what about the Merry.
336;suspending one's disbelief is something of a must to fully enjoy many.
337;But in point of fact, the internal logic of the film is quite tight.
338;well son of a wealthy father.
339;A darkly comic scene between the diabolical son and his dotty, doting mother (the delightfully daffy Marion Lorne)offers clear evidence that his problems go way beyond youthful excess and alcohol abuse.
340;Even after his murderous tendencies are realized, we are surprised by the extent of his madness.
341;On the face of it, I'd have to say the latter.
342;Real life, everyday people DO sometimes cross paths with sociopaths.
343;Casting Farley Granger as the innocent man caught up in this madman's plot was a pretty clever stroke of intertextual genius on Hitchcock's part.
344;ridden of the two joy.
345;one could write a dissertation on all of Hitchcock's clever touches.
346;His wit and visual style make for many an enjoyable moment.
347;He certainly has that in STRANGERS ON A TRAIN.
348;STRANGERS ON A TRAIN is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie.
349;I like it even more than VERTIGO, which is a movie that I love very much.
350;there are so many wonderful things about this movie.
351;But the thing that I like most is Robert Walker's performance.
352;there are so many wonderful scenes in this movie.
353;The amazing climax at the merry.
354;All in all, this is a perfect movie.
355;This movie is great and the two versions on one disc is a great bonus.
356;So relax SRGRANGER its okay you have the movie in it's original form.
357;constructed film, with good performances (Walker's is the best as the decadent, charming villain Bruno), but it has dated badly.
358;Still, it is fun to watch, but in its case _the viewer is the one in control_, picking up on and considering its symbolism, and nodding at the finer points of the performances .
359;whereas in Psycho, Hitchcock is the one in control
360;One remarkable, bizarre and malicious thriller suspense, this script reminds us that sometimes the guilty are innocent and the innocent are guilty, is characteristically noir, but more specifically Hitchcock's world, a world in which no one, it seems can escape blame .
361;And that's one one of the many virtues of A. h. as director.
362;Since I did it (in 1972) I was sure this picture was among the five best of him and it made me glad to know that the well known video guide entitled Facets stated that Strangers for their criterion, was the best film of that year, evem above From here to the eternity .
363;A syncronization or a happy coincidence?Remade as Once you kiss a stranger and clear inspiration for Danny de Vito in Throw moma from the train .
364;Definitely old time scenery and plot, but enjoyable and full of intrigue.
365;CSI has even mentioned it.
366;Well constructed story, very entertaining.
367;The mystery keeps you interested in the plot.
368;walker is astonishingly good in his role, walking away with the film with a performance that should have been rewarded back then and better remembered today.
369;He's one of Hitchcock's great villains.
370;Neither Granger or Roman registers with much of an impact, while Marion Lorne as Walker's protective mother has a couple of very strong scenes.
371;Patricia Hitchcock, the director's daughter, is very amusing as Roman's sister.
372;pretty much all of the memorable scenes in the film involve Walker.
373;The film's climax is really well done and a lot of fun to watch.
374;There as some great shots (typical for Hitchcock) with some interesting symbolism.
375;The British preview version has a runing time of 1 hour, 42 mins.
376;Mr. Anthony engages into a typical fan conversation, however, he continues to carry on a conversation and starts to become too friendly.
377;did you spot the 7.
378;marion Lorne is best remembered as Aunt Clara in the Bewitched tv series (1964.72).
379;thriller holds up extremely well after fifty years.
380;All twenty kids thought it was GREAT and applauded enthusiastically at the end!
381;This is one of my most favorite movies and wow, Granger stole the movie from Walker.
382;Walker died soon after making this movie, but it was a true classic.
383;I enjoy it every time I see it.
384;This film is definately one of Hitchcock's best!!!
385;But still a must see for Hitchcock fans
386;Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
387;This movie is the best in cinematography, casting, and suspence!there are two endings to this movie the U. s. version and theBritish version.
388;I prefer the British ending version.
389;it has a touch of humor which catches the audience offbalance after watching a suspence climbing murder mysteryfor more than a hour.
390;This is the best work of actorRobert Walker very oscar worthy!
391;He should have one itno doubt!
392;Strangers on a Train is a Hitchcock classic suspense thriller based upon Patricia Highsmith's first novel published in 1950.
393;The filming is full of clever tricks including an initial shot of Hitch himself wrestling a bass fiddle onto a railroad car.
394;robert Walker, though hammy, as deranged Bruno seems more convincing than Farley Granger's Guy, the famous tennis player.
395;Marian Lorne as Bruno's befuddled mother is a delight.
396;Hitchcock uses some of his typical cinematic devices.
397;He has the camera zoom in on Bruno's tie.
398;The lighter in the sewer scene is absorbing.
399;Often Hitchcock telegraphs ideas in this manner.
400;round scene at the end is exciting and done in a Hitchcock style, objects moving at very high speed, an out.
401;movie fans should enjoy this black and white thriller, and it's well worth revisiting.
402;'Stranger's On a Train' is classic Hitchcock.
403;Excitement, suspense, a little romance, great set pieces, this movie has it all.
404;This movie is presented in full screen and stars Farley Granger, Ruth Roman, Robert Walker, and Patricia Hitchcock (Hitchcock's daughter).
405;I thought Pat Hitchcock gave a good performance.
406;She's actually a pretty good actress.
407;In my opinion, this is one of the better Hitchcock movies and is a personal favorite of mine, definitely in my top five.
408;it all adds up to one great movie.
409;The score is pretty good and the acting is great.
410;The script is really good.
411;i highly recommend Strangers On A Train.
412;Strangers on a Train is a well.
413;appreciated but lesser known film than some of Alfred Hitchcock's later works, but it nonetheless remains a remarkable story with an excellent cast.
414;The tale of two men exchanging murders is a brilliant one and it is played out here with full suspense.
415;hitchcock's use of light is as wonderful as ever and the climax on an amusement park carousel, is one of his best.
416;Terror is everywhere during the last few minutes of the film.
417;I highly recommend Strangers on a Train.
418;it's one of Hitchcock's finest.
419;Strangers on a Train(1951) is a great Alfred Hitchcock movie from his Hollywood career in the USA.
420;focals, and Hitchcock adds a nail biter action scene on a broken merry go round.
421;There is some humor in the film.
422;Alfred Hitchcock's real life daughter Patricia Hitchcock co. stars in the film.
423;The music score by Dmitri Tiomkin is really good.
424;The tennis game in the movie was Hitchcock's idea.
425;The second hour of the film is a little bit lighter in tone.
426;The final theatrical cut is tighter and better paced, and contains a much more creative and satisfying ending, appropriately set on a train, that is entirely missing from the preview cut.
427;This one is highly entertaining though, and has some great performances, especially Robert Walker and Patricia Hitchcock.
428;The concept is good and the settings well.
429;It also has a better picture than the US side.
430;This is deffinitely one on Hitchock's most chilling thrillers.
431;The suspense keeps you ready to explode at any moment.
432;The cinematography in the strangling scene is incredibly powerful.
433;see for any Hitchcock fan.
434;Strangers On A Train should be rated as Hitchcock's absolute best.
435;to begin with, it features a perfect performance by Robert Walker, an actor who would be dead within a year after making this great movie.
436;walker had previously played some wonderful roles, but he astounded the world with his acting ability once Strangers On A Train was released.
437;hidden meanings which relate to the dual personality each of us possesses.
438;hitchcock was a true genius, who not only understood both the dark and the bright sides of the human psyche, but who also knew how to depict that understanding by way of film.
439;but, the main reason I watch this film so often is to enjoy the exceptional , perfect performance by Robert Walker.
440;He died much too soon, and we are very fortunate to be able to observe his wonderful talent, preserved in this movie, almost fifty years after his passing.
441;Strangers on a Train is one of my favorite Hitchcock films, for its trademark spellbinding suspense, whimsical touches, and unpredictability.
442;The director's daughter Patricia has a featured role in the film, and he makes one of his silent cameo appearances early on.
443;See if you can spot him!Ruth Roman gives us a sterling performance as the love interest, a smart, attractive senator's daughter who quickly sees to the heart of the matter.
444;Farley Granger is in top form and seethes with malice.
445;The superb supporting cast is flawless.
446;at the conclusion of the film, the merry.
447;Strangers on a Train is Hitchcock at his best.
448;The film itself was suspenseful.
449;HIt had a good plot.
450;Use of everyday items to create terror is still effective.
451;To say that this is one of the better Hitchcock movies is to say that it is an all time great movie.
452;one character dominates the movie and that is Robert Walker's Bruno villain.
453;Walker's performance is just outstanding as the Bruno character can be charming one minute, childish the next and just plain evil the next.
454;Walker excels in all facets of Bruno's psychopathic character and it is one of the great portraits of evil you'll ever see.
455;How it did not even get an Oscar nomination is a mystery to modern viewers.
456;Only Hitchcock could take a simple children
457;This is a great movie that slowly builds suspense and delivers and it is the work of the all time master of that sort of thing.
458;Farley Granger is good, but his character in the book is much more complex.
459;Here, he's just a good guy
460;Robert Walker's performance as Bruno Anthony is marvelous and makes the movie worth watching .
461;Two men meet accidentally on a train, one is a famous tennis player, the other a dissatisfied playboy.
462;Strangers on a Train offers some intelligent cinematography and a clever story that enhances the level of suspense.
463;The film provides a very suspenseful experience that keeps the audience's interest from the beginning to the end.
464;a prominent supporting role by Alfred Hitchock's daughter is a bonus on top of his skillful film direction.
465;movie quote: I still think it would be wonderful to have a man love you so much he'd kill for you.
466;It turns into a plot that you end up gripping a pillow or something, very scary.
467;As a movie buff and ardent fan of Alfred Hitchcock and his movies, I see Strangers on a Train as a defining moment in the first level of Hitchcock's great movie making career.
468;With the plot set, the suspense is bound to flow.
469;This is the lady that Guy Haines is in love with and set to marry, as soon as he is able to get a divorce.
470;Guy Haines certainly has a motive to divorce her, maybe even strangle her.
471;this film is a must see for Alfred Hitchcock lovers and worth viewing over and over.
472;As a film and Hitcock fan, this item is a great addition to my film library.
473;Classic film, very unique and intriguing storyline.
474;The acting of films in that era was so relaxing, simple yet very effective.
475;I love a good thriller and especially one with more than blood to shock .
476;Stories, characters, thrills only with Alfred!
477;Interesting film in black and white .
478;no blood, no swearing, so action packed photography, just a good thriller, a mystery with good acting.
479;We enjoyed it to the end.
480;Sitting on the edge of your seat suspense!!
481;Very cool filmography as well as historic shots of washington and penn station in new york.
482;Strangers On A Train is a classic Hitchcock thriller.
483;Bruno is a psychotic spoiled rich son of a doting mother and demanding father.
484;She sees guy as a ticket to riches and power for herself.
485;hitchcock's film is his signature thriller with complications and a wild merry.
486;round of a suspense filled ride.
487;Made with smooth directing by Alfred Hitchcock(Vertigo, Psycho, The Birds) and an smart screenplay by Raymond Chandler and Czenzi Ormonde.
488;hard fans of Hitchcock`s will love it.
489;This is one of Hitchcock's masterpieces.
490;His direction is right on, and the performance of the evil guy, Robert Walker, is quite bone.
491;This is one of Hitchcock's best.
492;One of Hitchcock's best, this is a fascinating motion picture.
493;the nail biting finale on the carousel is more than enough for one to see this film.
494;hitchock has truly done it again.
495;brilliant camera work, a bravura script, and wonderful performances, not to mention actual atmosphere and beautiful locations.
496;this is a classic, so what are you waiting for???
497;Very entertaining and interesting throughout.
498;It is from his most fertile and successful decade, which saw the likes of Rear Window, Vertigo, North by Northwest and Psycho.
499;hitch takes his favorite main character .
500;One day he meets an eccentric fan named Bruno Antony [Robert Walker] on a train.
501;He has a plan to commit the perfect murder.
502;Strangers on a Train, I think, most closely resembles Rear Window [made three years later] because the relentless suspense and the truly diabolical nature of the story is tempered with a great deal of humor, as if to remind the audience not to take it all too seriously.
503;The musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin is one of his best.
504;The cinematographer, Robert Burks, was nominated for an Oscar.
505;The great mystery writer Raymond Chandler wrote much of the screenplay, which was also worked on by an uncredited Ben Hecht, who often did this for Hitch and others.
506;I viewed it today and what a treat!
507;This is Hitchcock at top form,with all the small details, the little one liners, the unspoken tidbits the camera silently picks up.
508;Farley Granger as Guy and Robert Walker as Bruno are outstanding.
509;Ruth Roman turns an excellent performance as Guy's strong.
510;The director's daughter sparkles as a precocious young girl with a crush on the detective tailing Guy.
511;The director almost always portrays police officers with respect, unlike the authoress.
512;the supporting cast is top notch.
513;The camera work is very quick but first rate and speeds the film to its' conclusion, pardon the pun, like a fast moving train.
514;With the possible exception of Spellbound , which is a very serious movie, I believe this is the great director's best work!
515;A final word:If you have read the book, approach the movie with a wide open mind.
516;Quite simply, it is a riveting thriller that still has the power to make people think.
517;the characterization in this movie is magnificent.
518;Robert Walker does a superb job as Bruno Antony.
519;Hitchcock examines issues that were sccandalous at the time, and Bruno's infatuation for Guy is subtle but clearly evident.
520;The dinner party scene will chill you to the bone!
521;Farley Granger does well at his portrayal of a frightened yet determined individual fighting to clear his name.
522;Patricia Hitchcock is good as the outspoken senators daughter, and Ruth Roman is a calm woman who nevertheless fights to protect the man she loves.
523;Another treat is the lady who portrayed Aunt Clara on Bewitched.
524;if you're looking for a magnificent thriller that also contains believable characters this movie is for you.
525;Happy viewing, and God bless.
526;We watched for about fifteen minuets and moved on.
527;There are numerous movies of that era that we enjoy but this is not one of them.
528;Classic Hitchcock thriller with unusual and quick camera use.
529;Holds up pretty well over time.
530;The acting was great in everyway.
531;A really really great film that hold your attention in all ways.
532;Nearly every human being has experienced a moment in which their emotions have overrun their sense reason and logic and, in a fit of anger, claim that they want to `strangle' or kill someone who has caused them some form of pain or anguish.
533;The pairing of Guy Haines, the dashing all.
534;there are at least five scenes in particular found in this film in which the true cinematic genius of Alfred Hitchcock and his creative dramatic vision shines through brilliantly onto the screen.
535;The first is the sequence in which Bruno follows Guy's wife, Miriam, and her two `boyfriends' into the Tunnel of Love.
536;His shadow is projected onto the wall and from the viewpoint of the audience it appears as though he is overtaking them.
537;Though Hitchcock does not show the actual murder directly, he goes one step further, from an artistic standpoint that is.
538;the third is easily the most recognizable.
539;All, that is, with the exception of one, Bruno Anthony, whose gaze is set unwavering on Guy.
540;He must compete in the match and go on with his usual lifestyle to avoid further suspicion on the part of the police.
541;Bruno arrives in Guy's hometown aboard a train just as Guy's tennis match is taking place.
542;Suddenly, as he is pretentiously tosses it slightly in his right hand, Guy's cigarette lighter, the solitary advantage he holds over Guy's head, drops directly into a sewer drain.
543;round sequence, Hitchcock's crescendo for Strangers on a Train.
544;The scene itself is technologically marvelous, especially given the time period in which it was shot.
545;It's not perfect, by any means, and certainly far from the director's best work, though arguably within the top ten of films made while he was in the United States.
546;Strangers on a Train remains an engaging, first.
547;rate thriller even by today's standards.
548;i wonder if that is Hitchcock's great intension but people have been fascinated by one to another.
549;That can be a trick of making a classic movie?
550;This is one of the best Hitchcock movies, its about two men whose paths cross, and just like Hitchcock, every shot has meaning, including the opening credits where there are criss crossing train tracks.
551;That sets the mood, just watch it, enjoy!
552;face visual and auditory punch.
553;The master of suspense directed only a few films with noir themes, and this is his best.
554;It will appeal to both fans of film noir and of suspense and, for that matter, train movies.
555;well son of a wealthy man who doesn't like him very much.
556;He comments on Guy's personal life, based on gossip he's read in the papers.
557;He insists that Guy have lunch in his cabin.
558;Bruno has an idea for a perfect murder.
559;How do you explain a guy who has traded murders with you without permission?It's a great extended suspense, but Hitchcock's real trick is in his villains.
560;He's made us into perverts.
561;Credit is due Robert Walker and Kasey Rogers for these terrific performances as well.
562;Other guests include film historians Richard Schickel and Robert Osborne, screenwriter Whitfield Cook, Psycho screenwriter Joseph Stefano, actress Kasey Rogers, filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich, and more.
563;The commentary is informative and interesting as far as it goes, but it is more about the adaptation and themes than about the film itself.
564;Subtitles are available for the film in English, French, Spanish.
565;Dubbing is available in French.
566;Strangers on a Train: A Hitchcock Classic (36 min) is a good general documentary.
567;also, interesting to see Hitch's daughter in the movie.
568;This is one my favorite Hitchock movies because it is trully exciting.
569;The level of suspense is amazing.
570;You'd figure with the advanecement of movie techonology Hollywood would be able to create an unequally great suspense movie, but stranger on a train really shows that Hitchock was able to create suspense the best.
571;What a great movie, a classic.
572;I'd recommend it to any Hitchcock fans
573;Strangers was the exception to this tenure, launching the master of suspense on an uninterupted string of chilling cinema classics.
574;When the two accidentally meet on a west bound train they exchange intriguing ideas on how to commit the perfect murder.
575;The reflection of Miriam's silent demise is captured in a reflection inside her horn.
576;The gray scale is impeccably balanced with deep, rich and solid blacks and very clean whites.
577;The audio is mono but equally impressive and very nicely restored.
578;The Bottom Line:An absolutely spiffing thriller with a great performance by Robert Walker as the psychopathic Bruno and one heck of an ending, Strangers on a Train is one of Hitchcock's better pictures.
579;But the transfer to high.
580;this is one of the best Alfred Hitchcock movies ever and the British version is even better than the American version.
581;Both are included in this package.
582;Soon Guy's wife is found strangled.
583;And Bruno wants Guy to carry out his side of the bargain.
584;this terrific suspense film is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most entertaining films.
585;It manages to keep you on the edge of your seat, while at the same time incorporating a lot of humor.
586;Bruno Antony is one of Hitchcock's most interesting villains.
587;In one of the film's most amusing scenes, he invites himself to a cocktail party and tells his half.
588;i especially liked the film's final twenty minutes.
589;Hitchcock builds suspense masterfully as he cross.
590;round, is one of the most brilliantly choreographed scenes ever in a Hitchcock film.
591;this film is worth comparing to another, later Hitchcock film, Frenzy.
592;First I will say this is a classic film that doesn't contain one wasted minute.
593;It's always been one of my favorites and have always shown it to friends as an introduction to these films due to their lack of Hitchcock experience.
594;I have the original release and it has served me well these past years.
595;I MUST be strong and resist the temptation of re.
596;It still holds upIn today's competitive market, but then Hitchcock is!
597;ray, but it is a must.
598;ray discs allows both the final and preview versions of the movie to appear on one disc.
599;tVs it will look the same.
600;It looks nice but not memorable.
601;key in that his portrayal is subtle.
602;You see in the sequence Alfred Hitchcock climbing on the train while carrying an enormous cello in a case.
603;A subtle comparison of the two events tells a lot about the hero and the anti.
604;The out of step Bruno is wonderfully pictured when the heads in the stands at a tennis match go back and forth back and forth following the ball.
605;The movie is well done and fairly interesting, though predictable, but what I really enjoyed was looking at 1940's America, before WW2.
606;If you like that sort of nostalgia, than this movie is for you!
607;this film is a masterpiece with a very unique plot and masterly directed by Alfred Hitchcock.
608;The actors give a excellent perfomance, especially the antihero Bruno.
609;The story shows clearly the psychology of each major character, and keeps moving forward in an unpredictable manner as character plays out his or her part toward the intense conclusion.
610;so it's basically all of Hitchcock's usual fare.
611;I like his much more experimental stuff, where he plays with camera and imagery and narrative and design.
612;Hitchcock fans and there are many, will revere this film.
613;If you don't believe in the plot you can't get drawn into the suspense and suspense is what Hitchcock is all about.
614;Ruth Roman has about as much personality and charm as a stone
615;I love old suspenseful movies like this.
616;it showed movies could be good and suspenseful without gory murder scenes and blood n guts all over the place.
617;ray and thinking that it would be a great viewing experience.
618;I keep believing that a release on blu.
619;I have other black and white movies from the same era that look great in blu.
620;Not sure if I'd call it timeless, but well worth the price for movie buffs and Hitchcock fans.
621;This is definetly a classic Alfred Hitchcock thriller.
622;It has more twist and turns than a good roller coaster.
623;Plus, the classy train traveling is unmatched!
624;Movie is in black and white and is visually exceptional in the blu.
625;The story is an excellent mystery.
626;Really enjoyued it Had seen it as a youngster and thoroughly enjoyed becoming reacauanated with it.
627;Highly recommend it to others.
628;To start off, I should first state that, for the most part, most of Alfred Hitchcocks films are uniformly excellent by any standards.
629;An early 50's masterpiece that has stood the test of time and continues to enthrall viewers.
630;The final carney sequence is probably studied by more film schoolers than any scene from any well constucted film.
631;The real genius here is how the story builds starting with a chance meeting between two strangers.
632;Bruno Anthony (with robust flair deceptive motivation) is played by Robert Walker.
633;Unlike Sam Peckinpah who would make sure you felt every aspect of the killing, Hitch uses shadow and light, with the help of a pair of bifocals.
634;Pat Hitchcock has her greatest screen role in this one and does a good job.
635;from the very interesting concept used in the opening of the film to the spectacular ending, this is a film not to be missed.
636;The commentary is great and the transfer itself is excellent.
637;i would rate Strangers On A Train as one of the top 8 Alfred Hitchcock films.
638;A few interesting twists here and there, but overall I would recommend passing on this one unless you are a big Hitchcock fan.
639;watched this recently (I can't remember how many times I've seen it over the years), I'm reminded again of what a brilliant movie this is.
640;It certainly stands out firmly among Hitchcock's greatest works.
641;The scenes of Lorne and Walker together are priceless.
642;Hitchcock certainly had a thing about mothers.
643;In some ways this stands as the best film Hitchcock ever made.
644;Hitchcock devised a brilliant scenario that could happen to anyone
645;bruno is Hitchcock's finest villain, a beguiling monster who could be anyone anywhere.
646;The McGuffin in the movie is the famous cigarette lighter, which Hitchcock toys with deliciously right through from the first scene to the end.
647;it's all in the mind, you know.
648;An averaging of all the reviewers gives the film 4.5 stars which is, I think, about right.
649;The concept of the film is fascinating.
650;the following movie is certainly interesting and operates on an interesting, if illogical, premise.
651;I really liked this film.
652;It's very entertaining and well worth seeing.
653;Vertigo in my opinion will always be Hitch's best but give credit where its due.
654;This is deffinately an incredible film.
655;cross concept to Bruno's homoerotic attraction to Guy this is in my top 10 and Hitch's 2nd best only next to the great godsend Vertigo .
656;Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train is a fantastic achievement on so many levels.
657;the cast plays perfectly well in this well crafted thriller, and Hitchcock shows off his camera finesse once again.
658;the many themees that run through this are equally satisfying.
659;There's so many other themes in this film.
660;THis film has it all.
661;it's one of the greatest films of all time, and one of Hitchcock's most overlooked.
662;Farley Granger is the earnest, minding.
663;well, who is aware of his issues with his ex.
664;Robert Walker is wonderfully oily, very dangerous, in his soft.
665;Bruno, the effeminate momma's boy and very wealthy, also boards the train.
666;Bruno, who is a bit nuts, offers a suggestion.
667;The perfect murder, he gloats.
668;guy just says, yeah, right Bruno and leaves.
669;great scenes: While everyone else is moving their heads back and forth, back and forth, during a tennis match, Bruno sits in the middle and watches and stares straight ahead at Guy.
670;not as good as Notorious, Psycho or Vertigo, but still a master piece of work.
671;Not just comedy relief, but a pretty decent actress.
672;This is a great film, but that is because it is based on the even greater book (of the same name) by the late, great American author, Patricia Highsmith.
673;You can thank Ms. Highsmith for the well.
674;crafted tension and suspence that was carried over from her book into Hitchcock's movie.
675;Alfred Hitchcock always seems to get the credit for this wonderful story, but it was Patricia Highsmith who created it .
676;Strangers on a Train is, and always will be, all about Patricia Highsmith.
677;Hitchcock fans should be thanking her.
678;it is one of my favorites.
679;'Strangers on a Train', in my opinion, is the quintessential Hitchcock film.
680;perfect acting, music, visuals and pacing.
681;Even the opening scene, where Hitchcock puts the focus on the two main characters shoes, is poignant and clever.
682;round, it is simply pure movie magic.
683;Highly recommended to any film fan.
684;This is a great disc.
685;Not a lot of extras but what is there is wonderful.
686;And two versions of the film is extra enough.
687;Besides the most famous and well known titles of Hitchcock movies, Strangers on a Train is one of the best runner up's.
688;Carefully Hitchcock does for which he is famous: building up suspense in this great and detailed thriller.
689;As with all Hitchcock films, there are enough plot twists to keep the viewer guessing what the outcome will be right up to the famous carousel scene toward the film's climax.
690;Hitchcock, of course, employs excellent camera work, with great scenes in Washington, D. c. (the scene with Walker in front of the Jefferson Memorial is absolutely chilling) and the Forest Hills Tennis Club on Long Island, where we are treated to what a tennis match looked like in the 1950s.
691;This film provided probably the best roles either Granger or Walker ever had, and they do excellent work here.
692;Walker is effectively charming and creepy all at the same time (like Joseph Cotton in Shadow of a Doubt), and Granger is properly shocked and paralyzed by what he perceives to be an impossible series of events placing him and his fiancee in incredible peril.
693;A wonderful film with all the great Hitchcock touches
694;But perhaps the most overlooked beauty of all time has got to be Ruth Roman, who plays Guy's fiance in this movie.
695;robert Walker is excellent, of course.
696;A joking reference to Walker's personal appearance?Laura Elliot is fantastic as Miriam!!!
697;She's truly one of the most dispicable characters Hitchcock ever put to film.
698;Though Elliot is probably an attractive lady under normal circumstances, the thick glasses were an excellent touch, giving her a beady.
699;pat Hitchcock was great in this, too.
700;Very likable as she was in Psycho, and she really does a great job of putting across the terror she feels when Bruno is playing the strangling game.
701;It does work really well when cutting back and forth to the lighter.
702;This is a suspense thriller, not a sports reel!
703;It is a really suspenseful sequence, but it takes a lot of disbelief suspension.
704;He proposes to Guy that they both help each other, with Bruno murdering Guy's cheating wife, and in return Guy killing Bruno's father.
705;The best part of this movie is Robert Walker's portrayal of Bruno, who seems friendly and normal, but just by listening to him talk for more than a couple minutes, you get the feeling he is as far from normal as you can get.
706;His performance reminded me eerily of Kevin Spacey.
707;so for what it's worth, Hitchcock is still the master, but don't let this be your introduction to him if you're new to his body of work, there are many superior choices.
708;notch Hitchcock but it sure is entertaining Hitchcock.
709;stop thrill ride and the tension does not let up until the very end.
710;Mention must also be made of the exciting climax.
711;standing appreciation as a classic.
712;While I wouldn't not have cast Ruth Roman in her role, I really enjoyed Patricia Hitchcock in hers.
713;The mental suspense and imaginery is true Hitchcock.
714;The British version is better with respect to continuity of story line.
715;Robert Walker is fantastic as Bruno: scary, extremely verbose, and weirdly hypnotic.
716;There is an old saying in Hollywood.
717;Even a bad Hitchcock film is better than most films.
718;But when his films are great, they are far superior to other films.
719;Narrative, acting, pacing, technical work all excel in Hitchcock's films and Strangers on A Train, made in 1951, is one of his best effects.
720;guy Haines (Farley Granger), a rising star on the tennis scene, takes a train to Metcalf, New York.
721;Bruno soon reveals he knows a lot about Guy's life, including the story of his wife, Miriam (Kasey Rogers), who still lives in Metcalf and refuses to divorce Guy so he can marry Anne Morton (Ruth Roman), the daughter of a Senator (Leo G. Carroll).
722;Hitchcock based many of his films on books, taking intriguing ideas and changing them to meet his cinematic needs and making them memorable.
723;Strangers is classic Hitchcock featuring many of his trademark touches.
724;As they finally meet, in the lounge car of the train, the camera shifts up and we see the faces of the two main characters for the first time.
725;Bruno quickly proves to be the living embodiment of every gossip columnist, reciting every detail about Guy's life, revealing he is the tennis star's number one fan.
726;What is so brilliant about this relationship is the hint of a threat.
727;From his earliest films, Hitchcock has created suspense by telling the audience more than the central characters.
728;Throughout their conversation, Bruno talks about various theories and plans he has, giving Guy the impression that he is crazy.
729;A rising tennis star and his relationship with Anne, a Senator's daughter, already make him the focus of the gossip columns, he eventually enlists the aid of Anne and her sister, to help prove his innocence.
730;Two police officers begin to tail Guy, throwing a wrench into the works.
731;They eventually meet at the carnival and the police, still suspecting Guy, put their lives and the lives of many others in peril during the exciting climax.
732;if you are even just slightly familiar with Hitchcock's films, you will probably recognize some of the many themes prevalent in his works.
733;Strangers is worthy of discussion in any conversation about Vertigo, Rear Window or Psycho.
734;It has all of the same elements, touches and style of these later acknowledged classics.
735;The American version is the film we have all come to know and love.
736;A few years ago, a preview version of the film was discovered and screened at the British Film Theater.
737;Many of the more veiled allusions to the homosexual nature of the friendship between Bruno and Guy are just slightly more overt, sometimes laughably so, but it gives the film a deeper feeling.
738;Hitchcock was a powerful force in Hollywood and had ways of getting around the censors.
739;The difference between the two films is noticeable and interesting.
740;perhaps most interesting is a documentary called The Hitchcocks on Hitch.
741;Pat Hitchcock O'Connell relates stories of her childhood and working with her father on this film.
742;Naturally, these stories occur many years after Strangers, but they are still interesting.
743;there is also a short interview with director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable) who talks about how great the film is and how it influenced his career.
744;there is also a new interview with Kasey Rogers, who played Miriam Haynes, Bruno's victim.
745;Strangers on a Train is a Hitchcock classic, worthy of being mentioned in the same conversations as the director's more widely recognized classics.
746;It has everything from interesting performances to intriguing killers, from intriguing set pieces to interesting locations.
747;Strangers on a Train (1951) manages to grip the viewer in a chilling fashion, as it depicts symbolism (two of everything), suspense, drama, and the whole thriller aura.
748;The acting is very good for not having an all.
749;star cast, and Hitch's vision is masterfully executed in terms of unraveling a story not too fast or slow.
750;This movie has an abundance of darkness and sheer madness to it.
751;It also surprises me with its boldness for being a movie from a conservative decade of movies (the 1950s).
752;I recommend this movie for those who like thrillers, and those who are fans of Hitchcock, and want to own his best films.
753;I have seen nearly every Hitchcock movie and this is my favorite.
754;Much like all of Hitch's films it features great cinematography, an excellent soundtrack, suspense, action, dark humor, and great directing.
755;star cast like some of Hitch's other films, it still features terrific acting, especially by Farley Granger and Robert Walker.
756;It also features a terrific story, a perfect vehicle for Hitchcock.
757;time great, I highly recommend it.
758;Thanks for the great service.
759;So many movies since have copied this plot, but this is such an original.
760;After Strangers he directed a string of classic films which have rarely been surpassed.
761;The themes that always sprinkled his best work come to the fore in this terrific film.
762;Although the narrative and the film has some minor flaws, they're easy to overlook given the power of this marvelous motion picture.
763;rAY:Warner has done a nice job of transferring this film to Blu.
764;The film looks exceptionally good with a crisp, sharp transfer.
765;The Blu transfer sports strong blacks.
766;This happens in only a couple of brief sequences but, on the whole, the film looks marvelous.
767;audio sounds quite strong with a very nice lossless mono track with dialogue close and clear.
768;On the train back to Washington D. c. guy meets Bruno Antony (the marvelous Robert Walker)a psychopathic killer in the making.
769;Bruno engages Guy in conversation and Guy tells him about his wife.
770;Although this section has no sound and has no titles explain the action (it is explained on the previous edition however), it's a fascinating glimpse into the past.
771;We also hear about the making of the film from Robert Walker's son, Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell, film critic Richard Schickel and others.
772;The picture here is sharper with better clarity and richer blacks, whites and grays than the single disc edition.
773;Again, the picture here is a marked improvement for similar reasons.
774;Evidently when Jack Warner saw Hitchcock's preview version, he agreed with the original ending that Hitchcock had in mind.
775;a great movie just got greater and the fact that this is in a plastic amray case vs. the cardboard snapcases is a marked improvement.
776;Highly recommended for both Hitchcock fans and those interested in learning about the master of suspense.
777;This is definitely a classic movie that is thrilling and exciting.
778;I believe you will find it worthy of addition.
779;A beginning to end masterpiece.
780;Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, has a comic.
781;relief part and directs her dad in his typically amusing cameo appearance.
782;There are many twists and turns without telegraphing what the outcomes will be.
783;Strangers on a Train shows master Alfred Hitchcock at his most delightfully deceptive, keeping audiences on the edges of their seats as he toys with our emotions and keeps us in perpetual suspense down to the final scene in his adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel.
784;The film begins with a highly inventive scene with no dialogue which shows us so much about the two principal players in the drama.
785;He intends to plant it at the amusement park where he had killed Granger's wife to implicate Granger.
786;Once again Hitchcock is tantalyzing his audience by tempting it to root for the villain.
787;round at the amusement park.
788;It was one of the most ingenious scenes Hitchcock ever filmed.
789;the screenplay credit went to Raymond Chandler, the last film credit of the great mystery writer's career.
790;Alfred Hitchcock's daughter Patricia tried out for the part of Ruth Roman's younger sister and was cast by her father, doing a convincing job.
791;One of my favorite Hitchcock films with tons of special features.
792;Great job by all concerned.
793;It isn't typical and yet they made it work and made it so it was halfway believable.
794;When examining the merits of Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train, it is clear that the Master of Suspense crafted another winner.
795;What was remarkable to me, however, was how he did it with such a simple plotline.
796;When Bruno brings up the thought of a criss.
797;in terms of overall plot, the goings are relatively simple here.
798;This is pretty much par for the course with Hitch, as (with a few exceptions) his films' plots are actually pretty standard and containing the tried.
799;He is easily one of the spookiest characters ever put to film.
800;thus, Strangers on a Train is a very good Hitchcock effort.
801;It contains the typical MacGuffin plot device, some very inventive camera work, and a villainous character who just may keep you up at night.
802;Watch with confidence knowing it will captivate you from beginning to end.
803;dial M for Murder has fewer characters, but most are well known actors that play a major role in the film.
