1;To my wonder, the incredibles was a surprisingly good movie.
2;What I definitely liked about it, is the stroy line.
3;Great balance I must say.
4;1hour and 45 minutes of great story line is what it is.
5;I love the pixar movies.
6;the incredibles is especially one of my favorites and great for kids and family.
7;will watch for years to come.
8;it has a great choice of characters and they all fit their parts.
9;it is definatly a family movie to watch on a rainy weekend.
10;the characters are fantastic and the storyline was so original and creative.
11;Still, I liked the other Disney/Pixar films, so I decided to give it a try.
12;Despite being computer animated, the characters are completely believeable and more importantly, likeable.
13;The story is exciting and fast.
14;paced, admirably blending action and humor.
15;This film is perhaps the longest animated feature I have ever seen, yet the minutes just fly by.
16;The animation is absolutely stunning.
17;To me, the animation is what makes it work, and what sets it apart from the James Bond movies I dislike.
18;"Somehow, when the characters are animated, my suspension of disbelief is kicked up several notches and I'm able to enjoy the gadgets and narrow escapes without always sarcastically thinking to myself ""yeah, right!"""
19;The music is very fitting, and the voices superb.
20;"I enjoyed the several ""making of"" documentaries and the added ""Jack."
21;overall, this is a fun, fast.
22;It doesn't get stale, and I'm sure I will continue to enjoy this for many years to come.
23;Finding Nemo and Monster's, Inc. were heartwarming.
24;The storytelling is brisk, strikes the right balance between dark/light and child/adult themes, and hits on superhero themes that would be familiar to both older and younger generations.
25;The characters are relatable individual and as a family, and maybe more than any other of the Pixar films, would be thoroughly enjoyable by teens and adults.
26;jack Attack short is a real hoot, and a very apropos special feature.
27;ray) and the picture was amazing.
28;You can clearly see the advances in digital animation compared to earlier Pixar movies, particularly in the volcano scenes.
29;With upscaling and LED and all the wonderful modern technologies, it looks even more (OK, wait for it.)
30;ray version of the movie and enjoying it even more.
31;My 2.5 year old liked it too.
32;I'm sure we will be watching it again and again.
33;theres the dad who has super strength like the thing from the fantastic four.
34;his wife has powers much like those of mr fantastic from the ff.
35;the daughter can create invisible shields a lot like the invisible girl from the ff.
36;the characters and the portrayal of thier unique abilities is done fantasticly.
37;its really cool for the kiddies and is thankfully free from the poop,fart, and puke humor the kid movies are so prone to these days.
38;I even liked most of the set design.
39;jack than in the main movie itself, I liked that one.
40;"good movie to own, better than many live action ""action"" films."
41;I loved this film because of the James Bond influences , which are in the plot , the music and the atmosphere also .
42;it was funny and quite poignant at times .
43;this is a great little diversion for those looking for a popcorn movie .
44;Damn impressive cartoon technology, but so what?
45;Move it to the fringes where acting isn't so important, like talking animals, science fiction, fantasy, superhero stuff.
46;TERMINATOR II was an awesome use of the technology, but what else is it good for?
47;The Incredibles tells a terrific story, which follows the lives of fallen hero's always itching to get back in the action.
48;It would be so easy for Pixar and Disney to take a mis.
49;The action, the imagination, and the downright quirkiness of the incredibles makes it a near perfect, ambitious flick.
50;The details are astounding, and even with all their strength's the hero's retain a sincere, flawed humanity.
51;see the Incredibles, it's original, that in itself is a virtue.
52;This is a very, very funny film.
53;But this story is really cute!
54;After all of Pixar's other movies, and after seeing the trailer I was excited to see this movie.
55;it looked really nice, and it had some interesting ideas and some funny moments, but the story and characters didn't grab you as much as they did in toy story,finding nemo, and Monsters Inc.
56;Hopefully, Pixar's next outing will be more enjoyable.
57;This was an impressive film.
58;They made a very witty, intelligently clever, powerfully smart adult cartoon.
59;"There is great respect paid to the superheroes of my father's generation as well as a specific intent to downplay the ""cute"" element and keep us glued to our seats with action, suspense, and some of the most ingenious animation to be seen this side of the Mississippi."
60;Each of our characters has their own dilemma, their own style, and their own hurdles that they need to cross, and Brad Bird gives them each their moment to shine.
61;"While he does focus heavily on our ""head of family"" Mr. Incredible, he gives so much attention to detailing the rest of the characters and scenes that you never feel this uneven balance."
62;These are huge issues to cover in a animated film, but Bird succeeds in these three ways:First, he gives the film the time that it deserves.
63;The Incredibles went in a completely new, fresh, and somewhat tangent direction that gave it the power to grow before our eyes.
64;It was an adventure, not just a simple piece of cinema.
65;overall, this was an amazing film to watch, experience, and enjoy.
66;The bold use of colors complimented the sensation of the characters that carried with them similar attributes.
67;Brad Bird skillfully crafted this film that had every possibility of being clich d and overbearingly geared towards children, but instead he took a higher road and gave us this film that will last the test of time due greatly in part to giving us, the adults in the world, an opportunity to indulge and enjoy the power of animated cinema.
68;The characters were beautiful, the story was solid, and the powerful voice acting allowed this film to rank among the top of my PIXAR favorites.
69;I highly recommend this film to anyone that is an avid superhero fan or simply is looking for an adventurous ride into the future of our movie business.
70;That is all I can say .
71;and this one is a favorite every time.
72;Even my husband and I enjoy watching this one!!
73;this is the story of a family who actually care about one another.
74;Their life is complicated by the fact that they all have super.
75;strong, the mother is super.
76;fields, and the son can run super.
77;my favourite character is Edna, the fashion designer who makes super.
78;She looks like a tribute to the famous Edith Head (winner of 8 Oscars for costume design).
79;this is a rare adventure, suitable for children and thoroughly enjoyable for adults.
80;This movie is great on many levels.
81;a family or child can sit down and watch this movie and take something positive from it.
82;All while keeping very fresh and relevant with questions of today.
83;IT does however deal with many of the same concepts that Ayn Rand dealt with in her books, but it does it in a new and interesting way.
84;The Incredibles is just one of the most incredible movie if you don't mind the stupid redundancy.
85;i had good hopes for it, and after Finding Nemo, it was very hard for The Incredibles to follow a film that would ignite such expectations.
86;the film is brilliant, it's a remarkable achievement, and I'm not talking about the animation or the technology, I'm talking about the extreme maturity and intelligence with which the film is narrated, as Nemo, Incredibles has above average character development, it surpases many regular films, and within the genre, it surpases Spider Man.
87;The Incredibles as all Pixar films cover all demographics, Incredibles has something for everyone, and those who don't find it funny, and find it too slow, well, Pixar never set out to do Airplane funny, and making fun of other stuff like Shrek is way too easy, Incredibles has it's share of laughs.
88;The film not only is concerned on being exiting, explosive and entertaining, but that it has a logical and interesting story, with clearly defined characters.
89;on an extra note, the film has a superb use of music, remenisant to James Bond soundtracks, very catchy, and used with incredible skill.
90;I watch this movie several times with my kids.
91;A Triple Crown winner in full stride.
92;Nice cloth and hair and fluids simulation, nice use of lighting, very believable animation that realy brings the character to life.
93;The plot is very original.
94;The incredibles borders on the edge of satire, but they balance it out by showing the human side of the super heroes, something you rarely see in comic books.
95;The dialogue, the action, the humor, the unfolding of the story.
96;esque theme of the movie.
97;This movie is entertaining for kids and adults alike.
98;As a new father, I have given new thought to the kind of movies I watch.
99;So what to watch with my 1 year old son?THE INCREDIBLES is the perfect family movie.
100;It's great on two levels .
101;kid friendly and interesting to adults.
102;I am stunned as an adult at much these two are present in cartoons and children's shows.
103;"Also, Mr. Incredible finds the skeleton of a murdered superhero
104;life"""" suit was hilarious as was the villain's consciousness of the super."""
105;Besides a setting that seemed pulled from a Marvel universe, I also enjoyed some of the elements lifted from non.
106;"I was amused that my wife said ""This reminds me of Austin Powers""
107;seriously, this is good stuff.
108;It relies on fresh writing and an authentic portrayal of family life.
109;This is good family movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family and you will find a way to laugh
110;My kids love the movie, we just needed it for blu.
111;we love this movie, feel good and adult humor.
112;Brad Bird's """"The Incredibles"""" is, I think, the best film ever produced by Pixar, and ranks tight up there with the greatest animated films ever produced or distributed by Pixar's partner, Disney."""
113;based animated film that the whole family will love, and which works as well as (or better than) even the greatest of the classic animated Disney films, this is it.
114;The Incredibles (2004)A clever and fast paced script and good dialoge propel this brilliantly animated feature about a family of superheros under cover posing as normal sedate suburbanites.
115;a girl who can make herself invisible and can create force fields and a son who has super speed and is pissed that he has to keep his power a secret.
116;As you can probably guess, the ruse eventually crumbles and the family must leap into action to save the day.
117;This winner from Pixar is their first to deal with humanoid characters as past efforts have been about toys, fish and avuncular monsters.
118;The Incredibles is a great family movie.
119;It is fun for adults as well as kids.
120;If you love super heros then you will certainly be entertained.
121;I have bought this movie three times, one in a full.
122;I love the pixar movies and this is definitely a great one.
123;Adults will love this one.
124;Exploring the characters' powers is a lot of fun.
125;I really hope they make a sequel, I love this movie!
126;The concept, a jaded superhero working as an insurance broker, longing for the glory days, hooked me from the beginning.
127;"The movie is visually stunning as well
128;Overall, the movie has a tremendous amount to offer to both adults and children, and truly is a wonderful experience for the whole family.
129;It had been a while since I watched in, and I laughed throughout the entire movie.
130;This is a great movie for the family to watch together.
131;I have always loved The Incredibles.
132;This is one of the best Pixar movies ever.
133;I like to watch animated movies and this is a funny movie, it is pretty goofy at times as well.
134;Another twist on the super hero life.
135;It's one of the more memorable animated flicks I've seen.
136;I recommend it for ages five and up.
137;I watched this movies years ago with my kids.
138;It is an old favorite with good family themes and values.
139;It is the best Pixar by far.
140;it's the best pixar movie ever made son!!!!!!!!!!!!
141;The incredibles is at times very funny, and at other moments very family orientated.
142;The antics of this super hero clan can tickle youre funny bone, especially when they are trying their best to blend in with their society.
143;Mr Incredible's attempts to keep his hand in the game, and also his attempts to keep his actions from his wife, make for some great comic moments.
144;The maturing of their kids is heartwarming.
145;But mom and dad pull it together, and love and the good guys win the day.
146;The style of the artwork in this movie was great, as was the concept and its implementation.
147;I really enjoyed this film.
148;This was just one of those animated films that was fun to watch.
149;My daughter liked this one also.
150;This fun animated Superhero movie is one of my favorites!
151;You might call it family oriented, but I say it's a great time, even without the kids watching with you!
152;This is, hands down, my favorite animated film.
153;But more than that, it's one of my favorite movies of all time.
154;Not only is the look gorgeous (at once modern and retro), but it has one of the most emotionally complex storylines of any """"kids"""" movie I've seen ."""
155;dealing with mortality, family dynamics, and more.
156;The filmmakers get a lot of mileage out of an extraordinary family having to deal with ordinary situations, and some of the dialogue to that effect is truly thought.
157;In addition, for comic book geeks, there are some great bits poking fun at the habits of superheroes and supervillians.
158;Watched with the kids in the movies, then again at home about a million times, and I can still find a new thing to laugh.
159;Loved the disfunctionality of the family dynamic.
160;To our surprise, it was a decent show.
161;Wow this was a great movie!
162;I have seen Nemo, Team America, Shrek 1 and 2, Toy Story 1&2, etc.
163;This computer generated cartoon is the best I have ever seen.
164;It's one of the first times that I found myself laughing outloud, along with the rest of the audience.
165;The humor is more for an adult, but I think the kids will enjoy it too.
166;One of my absolute favorite Pixar productions.
167;It has such a unique style from the era of some of the original superhero comics and yet it still feels and looks so new and modern.
168;The story is great and I watch it all the time with my little cousins.
169;The beginning of the movie gives me the feeling that they are trying to find something to do, but then when they get to the middle and to the end of it, it totally rocks.
170;He's wife, Elastic Girl, one of the superhero's, helped him along to be normal, when their own childrens also have superpowers.
171;Throughout the film, they all learned how to be theirselves and proud to be who they are.
172;I love this movie we have seen it many times and it is always fun to watch, both my kids enjoy it.
173;Another huge hit, this genre just keeps getting better and better.
174;these are all stories and films that are engaging enough for adults and still highly entertaining for kids.
175;Loved this movie since it came to theaters.
176;Well, I was really ready to love this movie.
177;But look how many folks really did love this movie .
178;so it must have something, right?
179;What I did think was very well done was the outstanding voice characterizations.
180;Craig Nelson, et al, did a fine job.
181;I especially enjoyed both the art and voice (along with the writing) re Edna Mode.
182;Also, I thought Syndrome was well done.
183;"But I did love ""Finding Nemo."""
184;I watch this movie enough time that I had to have it myself.
185;Loved it from the beginning to the end.
186;Great movie for whole families to watch together.
187;This is my son's favorite movie.
188;The Incredibles is a wonderful movie, and one of my favorites.
189;I look forward to spending time with my kids and adults alike eating popcorn and watching this movie many times over.
190;This is a wonderful movie for the whole family.
191;My husband and I love it as much as the children.
192;There were a couple of things that I thought the film could do with out but in all I really enjoyed it!
193;My 3 year old daughter loves it.
194;I love that I can play it on her TV in her room, or the blu.
195;one was my favorite funny scene .
196;Download speed was good, with one delay which could be attributable to our computer or internet connection.
197;this a great CGI movie.
198;It definitely moves closer to having humans that look completely real.
199;Well slip this into the rotation, it's worth a few dozen views.
200;Funny movie good plot the characters were great all in all I would call it a pretty awesome movie for all
201;This is probably the best Pixar movie, at least right up there with the Toy Story series.
202;It is certainly the best for adult audiences.
203;My kids loved the action too.
204;Its kind of like X. men, where some people are born with special powers, and while some use them for good, others use them for evil.
205;For a while, things are great for them until a bunch of lawsuits against superheroes begin to be filed by people who either did not want to be saved or who were injured while being saved.
206;this movie is incredibly funny.
207;Edna is a fashion designer who did a lot of work for supers back in the day, and her mansion and mannerisms are priceless.
208;the visuals of this film are stunning.
209;I can remember one scene above the ocean, and the water was the most realistic that I've ever seen.
210;see for, well just about anyone!
211;If you liked the previous Pixar films (and who hasn't) I guarantee you will like this.
212;Even if you haven't seen/liked the previous films, you should definitely give this one a try.
213;It's a very fun movie for all ages!
214;Notice how the hair gets most of the attention from the animators!
215;Another great movie that we have watched with our 3 yr old over and over.
216;From the first frame to the last, this is a fun, bright, smart, poppy movie that has a lot to say about superheroes, non.
217;And with a smart, funny script that dares to explore a world of superheroes who can't fit in .
218;but who must fit in (so there's a hint of sweet sadness to the movie, too).
219;modern, with a dash of retro, and everyone will find something to identify with.
220;The soundtrack is perfect .
221;bond score, to complement the fantastic voice talent.
222;The little touches are wonderful .
223;the way Mr. Incredible barely fits into his tiny car, as if all his dreams are shrinking .
224;The extras are equally superb, complementing the movie action to show us what Jack.
225;i sure hope there will be a part 2 at some point.
226;My daughter loves Dash because they have the same amount of energy lol!
227;my 3 year old son loves it.
228;man, woman, and children .
229;and I liked to see the growth in the characters when coming to terms with their talents and gifts.
230;Very good at suckering one into the mindset without realizing they've gone there.
231;Always enjoyable, constantly humorous, and inevitably a must.
232;This movie was entertaining, funny, and charming.
233;CTN was great as Mr. Incredible, making him more than a flat comic.
234;it was made to be upbeat and happy throughout.
235;I've loved this movie ever since it came out.
236;All of the characters are Very well played, the action sequences are excellently shot (made) and the 50's era look made it even better, even though it's a modern movie played out in more or less modern times.
237;Moreover, few films aimed at children (especially Disney films) focus as keenly on adult relationships until the action.
238;but each Pixar/Disney film has used its groundbreaking, still dazzling animation to tell stories reaching back to open.
239;"Whether Woody and Buzz's culture clash in 1995's first ""Toy Story"" film or this title family dealing with changing bodies and lives, Pixar films are often about what happens when you wistfully want your glory days back."
240;bound Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) and dextrous Elastigirl (a nuanced, sexy Holly Hunter) who can balance a family as well as she can hold up a kitchen table.
241;the film allows a middle.
242;"overall, ""The Incredibles"" is yet another success for a company and partnership who rewrote the rules of children's entertainment."
243;"Like the recent ""Spiderman"" films, ""The Incredibles"" finely walks between action audiences demand and the character study making the heroes intriguing, all in what remains the standard for lifelike animation and depth."
244;"Regardless of whether Pixar continues to release films under the Disney banner, you hope at least one more ""Incredible"" adventure awaits."
245;Highly recommended for children and adults.
246;Excellent movie, and the extras were well.
247;done, with commentary that added a lot to the experience.
248;This is a wonderful movie.
249;You almost come away believing that these characters are real.
250;look for the little boy in the tricycle he is hilarious funny.
251;I consider the plot a little bit confusing for kids, but overall this is a fun movie for the family and with a lot of nice effects and funny jokes.
252;Beautifully made from beginning to end.
253;"this is no match for Marlin, Dori and Nemo
254;I have had much better success with Vudu.
255;I bought it without having seen it before because I love the Disney/Pixar movies and I was not disappointed.
256;The movie was great the animation was awesome I highly recommend it.
257;Disc 2 had great special features the Jack.
258;jack cartoon was hilarious, I liked the Boundin' cartoon as well, the bloopers weren't as funny as Toy Story's but I still thought they were funny, the deleted scenes weren't that interesting I really don't think that kids would like them because they are done in storyboard format but adults might find it interesting, the top secret files were so boring, there is also a """"Making of"""" which is like a half an hour long."""
259;This is one that could have a good sequel like Toy Story did.
260;first of all, this movie is incredibly entertaining.
261;The storyline is fantastic, the action and suspense smack of realism, and the characters are endearing.
262;The characters' voices are great, as is each person's role in the film, all the way down to the clueless babysitter.
263;the animation and scene editing are masterfully done.
264;While Pixar has produced several top.
265;notch films, it's possible that this is their best (so far).
266;i encourage you to come along and enjoy the ride.
267;"It's a great one.5 stars all the way!Are you ready to cast aside your ""mild."
268;The incredibles was one of the best movies I have seen ever.
269;I think it is a perfect 10 of a film.
270;The incredibles was one of the best movies I have seen ever.
271;I think it is a perfect 10 of a film.
272;I was apprehensive about this Pixar and found myself taken for a thrill ride.
273;i am the one asking our family if can watch it again!
274;The story is enthralling, the humor is great, and the graphics are beyond their time.
275;This is probably the best super.
276;hero spoof I've ever seen!
277;Anyone who is a fan of Pixar films, will enjoy the offbeat humor and affectionate parody of the superhero genre.
278;It deconstructs and reconstructs common tropes found in superhero comics and family flicks.
279;It's hilarious, has the right amount of realistic drama, and the characters are so wonderful and enjoyable to watch.
280;edgy, funny, and full of heart, this is one film that I will never outgrow.
281;There are two crowds with this movie.
282;Those who think it was OK, and those who think it is brilliant.
283;my thoughts here are strong .
284;It pokes at the genre, and it tells a fantastic story in the process.
285;More than a parody, it has a rich pro.
286;family flavor, folded into a drama about relationships, yet never taking itself too seriously.
287;Soon, a powerful, intelligent enemy bent on becoming a self.
288;Who is this amazing arch enemy?Does my version of the plot tell as well as it works in the movie?
289;the movie soars farther than the average superhero movie because, like Spiderman, it looks into the reality of the kind of personal life a superhero would have.
290;the messages in the movie encourage us to be ourselves, be humble, do the right thing, and, in the case of peril, be courageous.
291;It's smart, funny, deeply emotional, and real.
292;You can see how much tremendous work and love went into it, from the writing all the way to the end.
293;This film looks and sounds great.
294;The story of the Incredible children discovering their talents is a very nice one.
295;That said, the rest of my family adores it, it is great for the older kids and adults, and the special features are amazing, so I am giving it 5 stars anyway.
296;"special features are on Disk Two and include: three very good cartoons
297;The incredibles is one of my favorite Pixar Movies.
298;From Samual Jackson to Craig T. Nelson the voice talent is top notch.
299;The story is pretty unique yet familer.
300;Mind you I am one of the few people who actually really liked the actual real live action Fantastic Four by 20th Century Fox but that being said, even though this film is not technically the FF it is how those films should have been made.
301;Also, they both use that stylized art.
302;cool artsy way AND in a way we all hoped it would be but never was.
303;The usage of cool gadgets, fast futuristic cars and planes and beautiful women.
304;The mood music, especially on the Island was very James Bond.
305;but above everything else The Incredibles is a wonderful, fun film that hits all the right marks.
306;As far as I am concerned its perfect.
307;the story basically focuses on a family of supes that are trying to live a normal life but the dad/husband Mr. Incredible is having a sad time trying to give up the old days of adventure and saving lives by living as a home insurance salesman for a crooked boss but his wife is happy to play house and live normally.
308;what I love about this is how this film addresses something way more serious than one might think.
309;Contrary to his wife who has had three children by this time and is deliriously happy living a life fulfilled life of motherhood and wife.
310;the film eventually tries to come to a happy ending by everyone in question compromising so that every at least gets some of what they want.
311;Of course the actual superheroes vs the bad guys story is really fun and enticing and you will love it I promise!
312;On the basis of the high number of positive reviews, and the reputation of Pixar I bought this for both myself and my 3.
313;It is an adult animated movie, that deals with adult topics.
314;And why on earth do they have a character that speaks French (with subtitles).
315;ironically) from other movies (particlarly James Bond).
316;This movie is one of, if not the, best movies Pixar has done IMO.
317;It's a great balance of good writing, character development, action, drama, and comedy.
318;If you like superhero movies, Disney/Pixar, or just a good story and don't mind if it's animated I recommend getting this very family.
319;This is a movie for the whole family.
320;Fun enough for the kids and hilarious enough for the adults.
321;It's funny, engaging and has a clean sense of humor for the little ones as well as adults .
322;in the true Disney style.
323;I am happy to add it to my family's movie selection.
324;This movie needs more of Edna, It was great and all of the animations are spot on.
325;What's incredible is that its been six years since Pixar made this delightful feature.
326;I totally agree with all the comments so far.
327;This is the best Pixar movie yet!
328;i particularly enjoyed the little references to Emeryville in the film.
329;Remember the opening car chase sequence on San Pablo Ave., well the map on Mr I's in.
330;I guess this latest Pixar triumph really does put Emeryville on the map!
331;See if you can spot the other references.
332;the only down side is that now we have to wait another year before Pixar's final picture with Disney Cars hits the screen.
333;And in case it needs repeating after so many positive reviews, Incredibles is among the best superhero films made and one more beautiful addition to Brad Bird's flawless animation record.
334;Every aspect of the film is a study in the art of nuance.
335;Careful attention to detail contributes to a fast.
336;paced, humorous adventure that not only plays as a straight story, but takes a fun look at the genres of comic book heroes, society's quirks, and the trials of being (super)human.
337;well written, great story, really impressed by this movie.
338;Good for the entire family.
339;Bargain deal at a great price.
340;Bought it during Black Friday at amazing low price with super saver shipping!
341;Teaches the value of family and teamwork.
342;Surprisingly, I found myself actually interested in the darn thing.
343;Since one of my mantras to my kids and grandkids has always been 'family is everything', the INCREDIBLES struck the nail on the head in that department.
344;I found the voices of the characters had so much to do with my enjoyment particularly the mother's.
345;All in all, it's a movie that I enjoyed watching and will probably sit down and watch again.
346;This movie did not captivate me as much as Toy Story or Monster's Inc., but did keep my interest and I did enjoy it.
347;I have found that as I watch many movies dozens of times with my young children, I come to know and love the characters and the story line.
348;What I was so pleased to see was the moral and ethical principals that exude in this film.
349;Committment to marriage and family and celebrating the differences between people .
350;i took our 4 1/2 year old son and he really liked it.
351;He now zips around all the time and wants me to call him Dash.
352;The kids can easily use ,watch, and enjoy.
353;It was very entertaining, my kids loved it.
354;Lots of action and humor and the story line was great too.
355;Pixar has scored again with this film, about a family of superheroes living out in the 'burbs.
356;I loved Batman and Superman as a kid, and this movie conjured up those good old memories for me.
357;It is a pleaser from start to finish.
358;Among Pixar's underrated strengths is the ability to get voices just right.
359;top Bond villian type and being the creepy guy you knew in high school that nobody wanted to be around.
360;the funniest animated character to be invented in forty years.
361;The filmmaker himself, Brad Bird, takes on that voice, and based on these results he's got a second career voicing animated characters if he decides to go that way.
362;being a fan of the old Flash DC comic, I liked the son Dash.
363;the spirit of the movie is captured best in one scene, in which the villian Syndrome starts a solioquey outlining his plan for world domination exactly the way every hackneyed Bond villian has ever done, and then pulls up and says, """"I can't believe it!"""
364;Its Pixar so of course it rocks.
365;My kiddos love this movie and I have been a fan of it when I first watched it when it came out.
366;disc Collector's Edition)~ Maeve Andrews is a really good animated movie.
367;The animation is astounding and the script is very well written.
368;I love the music and it reminds me a lot of the music used for movies such as Superman, Batman and other super hero movies.
369;"There are so many amazing scenes in this movie, like the scene with the ""fat"" Mr. incredible not fitting in the tube, the fight with the robot and many more."
370;This is the best animated movie that I have seen since Finding Nemo and I therefore give it 5 well deserved stars.
371;The way in which the characters are humanised with feelings, humour and surprising reality is brilliant .
372;for me the best part of the film was the undertones of adult humour and realism.
373;There are symbols and subtleties in this film that are great to notice and dissect.
374;Conclusion: Charming, Witty and Innovative but not necessarily just for urchins!
375;Great story, funny when it wants to be, exciting like nothing you've ever seen!
376;Pixar just keeps raising the bar.
377;Has to be one of the best movies I have seen in the past 10 years, no question.
378;"I mean, I loved the ""Toy Story"" movies, and ""Monster's Inc."", but this, this is something else entirely."
379;On a scale of 1 to 10, it is a 12!
380;You are one of the reasons people are still enthusiastic about movies!
381;This movie was no letdown from Pixar Animation Studios, in fact it was one of my favorite films of theirs.
382;The main enjoyable features of this film were that the plot was cleverly devised, the characters were well.
383;Still, The Incredibles was a great movie and is just as much a must.
384;see as all of the other Pixar films for all reasons previously stated and more.
385;Kiddo loves the movie, which is good because I make him watch it all the time.
386;the best thing about it is the multi.
387;Don't get me wrong, the animation is great, but it's no better than Finding Nemo or Shrek.
388;But what makes this animated feature stand out above others is that the storyline has finally got.
389;Enter Mr. Incredible and his family (Elastigirl, his wife, and their special children).
390;"this was a truly enjoyable story for an animated film
391;Quite unusual for a high.
392;He enjoyed the movie and it kept him occupied for part of the trip.
393;After the movie was over we asked him what he liked about it and had a discussion.
394;subtle assistance and coercion, are forced to go underground.
395;He has a family now, his wife (the former hero Elasticgirl) and their 3 kids (a superspeeder boy and an invisible girl teen and.)
396;The superheroes are all easily recognizable tributes to famous marvel and DC characters (Mr. Fantastic, Flash/Quicksilver, Invisible Girl, The Thing, Ice.
397;The story is a fun adventure story, but does have adult themes.
398;Are we really rewarding accomplishment, or just trying to find ways to make it seem so?
399;All in all, a fun movie.
400;Great themes, writing and voice acting along with the Pixar magic animation.
401;IMO, the best childrens movie there is.
402;Can't do it can you?!
403;The animation is excellent but that doesn't come as a real shocker.
404;What does surprise me is that this cartoon actually has a plotline and the characters have personalities that are (at least to some extent) more human than what most real life actors portray.
405;There's lots of action, drama, laughs and of course the animation is fabulous.
406;Definitely worth the price of admission!
407;With all the weird cartoons on now it was great to watch on with my boys that we agreed on.
408;From seeing all these five star reviews here, I thought this was going to be excellent.
409;I thought the animation was great, it looks real and the characters are cute.
410;This could be better, if I'm going to give my honest opinion.
411;this disc plays perfectly on a neighbor's PS3.
412;I think this is the best Pixar movie.
413;Great superhero movie with great powers discovery scenes.
414;I thought that this would be a good movie for my 4 year old, but it is really for much older children
415;great story/plot and incredible/flawless animation.
416;The Incredibles was a fun, and entertaining movie not just for children.
417;Granted it has your textbook happy ending, but lets face it, its a pixar film.
418;I would recommend this movie to anyone of any age.
419;Yet most real super people I know are family people.
420;I got this in the mail early and it was in perfect condition!
421;I definitely recommend :) The movie is great as well!
422;A truly enjoyable movie for anyone who ever enjoyed comic books.
423;i think this is without a doubt the best animated film to take on the task of taking the comic book hero genre into a movie.
424;Numerous touches, small and large, bring back the atmosphere we always imagined as kids.
425;additionally, this is a great movie for all ages to enjoy together.
426;There is plenty of comedy for adults, and enough 'cool factor' for everyone.
427;You'll come to care about the family of Incredibles with their challenges and problems, and revel in the clever ways the writers have the family, and their super powers, come together.
428;the animation is beautiful to behold.
429;i just watched it again recently, and enjoyed it every bit as much as when I first watched it when it came out.
430;Bob is visibly excited about doing hero work.
431;He has friends who are superheroes"
432;He is basically my dad, only with super strength.
433;this movie is full of gem moments.
434;We laugh because it is true.
435;Bob, and his family of superheroes, are human.
436;Even the villian in this movie has quirks and character that we appreciate.
437;bob's central motivation is that he loves hero work.
438;Through the movie, Bob cries at loss, laughs in anticipation, beams with bride, glistens with love, and grins in adventure.
439;pixar continues its tradition of technical, artistic, and positive thematic innovation.
440;This is a great movie if you like action, adventure and animation.
441;My children love it, and so do I.
442;"The Pixar team continues its winning streak with this sharp, snappy, surprisingly adult animated adventure film about a family of former superheroes who cannot fit into ""normal"" society no matter how hard they try."
443;I'm actually surprised that kids stayed with this film long enough to enjoy the fast.
444;"stop action of its second half
445;my only complaint is that Pixar animation always looks slightly creepy when applied to human characters.
446;It's funny, cool and awesome too because boys will like the battles.
447;Awesome family movie for any age.
448;Dash is worth paying attention to.
449;If you're thinking, """"Aah, it's just a family."""
450;it's just anotherToy Story(which is, actually, another wonderful movie).
451;It's an adventure, a thriller, a comedy, and a super.
452;hero action movie all wrapped in one.
453;writer and director Brad Bird's second film (after the also terrificThe Iron Giant), it tells the story of a family of superheroes who .
454;what is so wonderful about this film falls into four categories:1.
455;The story is absolutely splendid: it's everything you could hope for in any adventure movie out there: be it Bond, or Indiana Jones or whatever else you throw up against it.
456;"I can guarantee that there will come a time during your watching of this film when you'll sit back and say, ""Wow!"
457;This really IS an amazing movie!
458;It's simply beautiful to watch: the CGI is as faultless today as it was when it was released a decade ago.
459;The graphics are terrific, full of brilliant colors and well conceived sets and amazing action scenes.3.
460;"There is an abundance of clever humor throughout
461;The makers of this film pull out all the stops when it comes to making this adventure film thrill you as much as it will humor you.
462;It's as hilarious as it is exciting.4.
463;There are lots of great themes at play here: how we dumb ourselves down to please others and force ourselves to accept mediocrity to fit in with others.
464;tHE INCREDIBLES is truth in packaging.
465;it's an incredible film from beginning to end.
466;Here they come, Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Violet and Dash, the greatest animated superhero family ever!
467;stop entertainment that you'll enjoy more and more with each repeat viewing.
468;reminder: Mandatory superhero outfits for everyone!
469;Pixar continually amazes me, always performing well.
470;This, a unique superhero slant, has done just as well as the other Pixar movies, if not better.
471;The characters are fun to watch as the story unfolds, leaving watching and enjoying every minute.
472;one huge extra that is included with the two disc set is small extra called Boundin'.
473;The lyrics, the animation, everything, is just wonderful.
474;As an adult I love watching it and don't mind watching it over and over again.
475;As a child my niece loves it.
476;And my nephew, as a 6 month year old baby, is captivated by it, even laughing out loud at times.
477;Nominated for four Academy Awards, and winner of Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, The Incredibles is one of the best animated films ever produced.
478;A cross between Toy Story, Superman, and Office Space, it provides an endless array of action sequences, visual creativity, and well.
479;Director Brad Bird (who's directed a few episodes of The Simpsons) not only creates a memorable film, but also voices one of the star characters of The Incredibles, Edna Mode.
480;And following in the rich tradition of animated classics such Bambi (1942), Beauty and the Beast (1991), and The Lion King (1994), Walt Disney Pictures teams up once again with Pixar Animation Studios (with whom it collaborated on Finding Nemo) to produce a film both children and adults will love with equal verve and passion.
481;Foremost among the superheroes is Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) who resembles Superman in both strength and style.
482;harbored by the government witness protection program, Mr. Incredible has assumed a new identity .
483;Violet (a shy girl with the ability to turn invisible), Dash (a cocky boy with the ability to run super fast), and Jack Jack (a baby with no as.
484;the Incredibles deserves a spot on anyone's list of the Top 100 films ever made.
485;It really is that good.
486;This attention to the form and detail of the story sets the tone for The Incredibles.
487;Its meticulous blend of sound and visuals, coupled with an utterly hilarious .
488;makes The Incredibles a solid contender for the best film of 2004.
489;This is a MUST SEE!
490;You leave the movie theatre fealing very lighthearted.
491;packed, fun, yet original movie.
492;It has a touching story line and has a good message to say by the end.
493;The film sports a great screenplay, score, stunning animation, and some brilliant voice acting, especially by Oscar winner Holly Hunter.
494;I highly recommend teens to see this and for adults to take their kids.
495;As others have mentioned, this is a welcome respite from the traditional formulaic children's films that are being churned out on a regular basis (summer and winter) like cookies from a cookie cutter.
496;The score in my opinion ranks right up there with those of Trevor Rabin (Remember the Titans and National Treasure just to name a few) and Kennedy Center Honoree John Williams.
497;All the voice actors/actresses fit there characters personalities perfectly, especially """"E""""dna Mode who is a riot as it is but is made even funnier due to the combination of her personality and physical height."""
498;"Interesting fact, the voice of ""E"" is actually done by the film's director Brad Bird."
499;I highly recommend this film.
500;Pixar has already commenced work on its post Disney contract films.
501;I bought this movie because we read the Incredibles story in the 5 minute bed time story book from Disney and he loved that story.
502;He loves the movie even more.
503;It has great lessons about family and love.
504;You have a film that supports your values of family and team.
505;It is the perfect family and also is good for adults too.
506;family film in a long time.
507;filled movie for the whole family.
508;I loved the families stick together theme of the story.
509;My three year old loves it.
510;Another Disney/Pixar collaboration that gives us a genuinely funny movie that teaches us some very important values about family life.
511;up to what becomes to core story of the film is superb as it allows Brad Bird (Writer/Director) to give us a real depiction of family life whilst adding the superhero element to the mix.
512;The characters are something unique and The Incredibles presents a platform in which to give each unique character their own equal spotlight.
513;Before going further into the movie I will give a quick rundown of each character to give you a good perspective of how the chemistry of the characters plays out on screen.
514;He works for a faceless insurance company and although he was forced by the government to go into hiding, he can't resist but be the hero he was in the past.
515;Played by Holly HunterViolet Parr: She's the typical shy teenage girl who has the ability to turn herself invisible and create forcefields using only her mind.
516;Played by Spencer FoxLucius Best/Frozone: This is the best friend of Mr. Incredible and has been since the original super days, he's a man who has the ability to use ice as a weapon or as a way of getting around.
517;All he has to do is fly to a deserted island and destroy the most intelligent and most destructive machine ever created.
518;After a successful first mission, Bob is given many more missions that pay very well, he tells Helen he's received a promotion at work but after becoming suspicious of Bob, Helen manages to find out that Bob had been fired a long time ago.
519;The comedy is something great too as there are parts that the adults can relate to and may, at times find themselves laughing hysterically to.
520;Brilliant film and is something that should be watched by the entire family together.
521;Fans of Pixar and Disney should love this one.
522;Just a fun family oriented movie.
523;The animation is great, and the story and music will keep you watching.
524;My wife and I watched it and we loved it.
525;I'm sure all ages will get a kick out of it.
526;Incredible and their kids as well.
527;It seems like a cross between a James Bond movie and Spiderman, but with a whole family of superheroes.
528;the Pixar animation is excellent.
529;I loved the way they developed the nemesis of Mr. Incredible from his biggest fan.
530;Movie of course was great .
531;This is one of my all time favorite movies for kids cause it teaches how to work together as a family .
532;This movie is lots of family fun.
533;Adults will love it too.
534;Great humor and lots of action!
535;See it again and enjoy it!
536;Fun music and art direction, too!
537;It seems so hard today to find movies that the entire family can watch and enjoy.
538;This movie crosses the gap and is fun for everyone.
539;I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to spend around two hours just enjoying themselves and their family.
540;as a pastor I can take pleasure in being able to recommend this movie to my congregation and not worry that someone may take offense to it.
541;"the guy has a shirt with an I that represents incredible i can do that"" and then i saw it and said to myself ""wow."
542;A very funny and entertaining movie by Disney studios!
543;There are very cool effects and the whole story is very interesting and it makes you wanna see it lots of times, because even if you already saw it you don't get bored of it.
544;The only one thing I have to object is the fact that it's kind of too long, but whatever, and the ending is very good, when Jack Jack discovers that he has the greatest powers in his family.
545;To finish, this movie had a very good reason to be nominated for an Academy Award(R): funny, exciting and original for all ages.
546;, it's so funny, and the documentaries and behind.
547;bonus feature (Disc 2): 5/5!!!
548;It's funny but mostly it's gives you the sense of team work we all try to keep at home.
549;This movie was a cute movie.
550;Both the children and adults enjoyed it and would watch it again.
551;I really enjoyed watching this movie.
552;The artwork and plot were great, and the voice acting was excellent.
553;I highly recommend this one for the family.
554;It has humour and characters that the children can relate to as well as enjoy.
555;paced, funny spoof on other super.
556;"It seems like critics, reviewers, and other ""movie experts"" heralded ""The Incredibles"" as witty and intelligent, and the majority of the movie."
557;I love to watch this movie with my grandchildren, they love it and I do too.
558;This movie was wonderful to watch as a family!
559;This movie will turn out to be a classic!
560;our leading family of supers, at all outward appearances, is a very normal family.
561;The story really kicks into high gear when Syndrome arrives on the scene and the family must bond together to defeat him.
562;the only complaint I might have is that with a running time of almost two hours it's a tad long, but that's easily overlooked as it holds your attention throughout.
563;good job, Pixar, and keep up the good work.
564;This movie was enjoyable, but it did not hold my kids attention as other similar movies have.
565;It is amusing and has a lot of action, so its a good movie for long car rides.
566;I had extremely high expectations for this movie and it just did not live up to them.
567;I thought the movie was cute and it was funny.
568;I would never discourage anyone from seeing this movie, because the people I went with loved it.
569;My Granddaughter's and I love watching this movie.
570;It is so much fun!
571;I think that this is a great movie for all ages!
572;There is some action for action lovers, a great story, and great special features!
573;It doesn't matter if you get full screen or wide screen because they are both the same and it is still a great movie!
574;It has some funny parts and some parts where you are shocked because you had no idea that that was going to happen!
575;There are so many great things on the special features disc too!
576;You can also look up the superhero profiles and read about them and you can hear what they have to say.
577;You can watch an old tv show about Mr. Incredible and you can do a lot more!
578;I give the whole special features disc 5 stars!
579;One of my favorite characters in the movie was Edna Mode, who was really the voice of the director, Brad Bird.
580;It is an incredible movie and there is something in it for everyone!
581;I would really recommend this movie for all ages!
582;This is my favorite movie and I am sure that you will like it!
583;I have liked this movie since I saw it when it came out with a couple friends haha.
584;You are sure to enjoy it with your kids and if your kids are too young to watch super hero movies and you don't want them to hear a lot of cursing and cussing, its a good movie for you.
585;Watch this movie to find out!
586;Still one of the best Disney movies I have seen to this day and I am a very avid Disney watcher.
587;It captures some of the best elements a movie can offer and that is the combination of a great super hero movie with a family element.
588;girl daughter and a baby with many powers will capture not only your heart but your anxiety as you watch them fight together.
589;This is one of Pixar 's best films.
590;So many favorite lines, but the winner is: No capes!
591;I had forgotten how fun this movie was until I watched it with my son!
592;All of my kids absolutely love this movie.
593;animated, ComedyGenre Grade: AFinal Grade: A. this was a great addition to Pixar's wonderful collection of films.
594;While I believe Finding Nemo and even Toy Story were better than this movie, it still had some hilarious moments and great characters, namely Holly Hunter.
595;I will say, however, that this is the most stunning computer animated movie I've ever seen.
596;I would have liked to have seen Samuel Jackson in more of the movie, and I think they could have made their characters a bit more quirky, honestly.
597;i enjoyed watching him watch this classic.
598;No worries about bad language or too much sexism, this one is just good wholesome fun and excitement.
599;This is a very funny movie.
600;The storyline is one of a kind.
601;He made movie that much more enjoyable.
602;We love this movie, my kids love the pixar movies and this one lives up to the disney name.
603;"Entertaining throughout
604;This i a movie that can be watched muliple times!
605;We have watched this with the grandkids twice since Christmas and will continue to watch as a family.
606;the scene where Mr. Incredible lifts the sphere.
607;while someone who is truly incredible."""""""
608;This is vintage, raw, pure Ayn Rand.
609;If you are an Ayn Rand fan, you'll see more Randian refernces throughout this film than you can perhaps count.
610;If you've enjoyed The Fountainhead and/or Atlas Shrugged, you'll find great value in this wonderful little gem of a movie.
611;very, VERY much worthy of your time.
612;My two year old loved it!
613;Disney Pixar films are her absolute favorite movies!
614;I would definitely recommend it for preschoolers as well as adults.
615;I love the family togetherness.
616;It's just a joy to watch and the characters remind me of my siblings.
617;Great for all ages, my nephews love it and so do I.
618;com to continue giving me good service.
619;This is such a fun family movie.
620;It is just great family fun.
621;If you do family movie nights, check it out!
622;Incredibles has incredible art work.
623;My son loves this movie and most cartoons so I will be back!
624;Its fun for all the family.
625;fast forward 15 years.1 group of superheros in particular are the focus,mr incredible,elasticgirl and frozone.
626;absolutely everything works in this and cant wait for the hopefull sequalS/prequalS.
627;Funny enough for grown ups to enjoy but innocent enough that you can let all the family watch.
628;My daughter (8) and I love the movie.
629;The characters however are great and there a fun action sequences.
630;They constantly keep releasing amazing visual and smart written movies.
631;And with this entry, Pixar have made their best movie yet.
632;He goes home every night to his family: His wife Helen, Mrs. Elastic, his son Dash, who can run super fast, his daughter Violet, who can make herself invisible and can create a unbreakable force.
633;He gets captured by his hirer, Buddy.
634;first of all, the graphics in this movie are amazing.
635;Pizar keeps outdoing themselves with every release.
636;This movie was by far their best.
637;The voice talents were very good and believable.
638;I especially like Jackson as Frozone and Craig T. Nelson's booming voice made for a good Mr. Incredible.
639;overall this movie was the best I've seen this year.
640;This movie may even be the best superhero movie that I have ever seen.
641;Everything is just beautifully meshed together to create an almost perfect movie.
642;It is visually stunning, voiced powerfully and very smartly written.
643;"When I watch an animated feature I dont expect great writing so its always a surprise when I watch a movie like ""The Incredibles"" that greatly exceeds my expectations."
644;animated films that were as well written, that were as fun to watch.
645;Family entertainment at its best and also kids love all the action superhero action and fighting and flying stunts it makes them go bonkers
646;Upholds and supports marriage and family.
647;Got the item as described very timely.
648;It was a well done animated film.
649;I must say this movie was entertaining.
650;"It's actually quite funny, when the city is being attacked there are bad guys watching on the news and drinking and one says, ""hey I've got it, each time they run we take a shot""."
651;i could deffinitely enjoy this one a few more times before it goes away to sit, I like it a lot.
652;I commend the writers and animators.
653;They've done some clever things here and this movie deserves some recognition.
654;The tradition of compelling story lines, groundbreaking animation, and moments of sheer comic pleasure have been their trademark since Toy Story.
655;Gorgeous background animation precisely toned to set the mood, whether it's the Art Deco retro or the action packed comic book capers over city skylines and tropical islands, the attention to even the minutia of a backdrop flawlessly compliments the stylized characters.
656;Pixar knows their strengths: when it is impossible to completely and accurately animate human features, they stick with what they know.
657;the Incredibles, while billed as a super hero film, succeeds because it is a super family film.
658;But the point of The Incredibles is that the true super hero story is a domestic one.
659;these themes of family, working together, and discovery of self were all a significant part of Pixar's last release, Finding Nemo.
660;the Incredibles, on the other hand, takes time to relax from the excitement of the broad, universal quests to remind us that it is a personal movie, about people.
661;It works within the basic plot outline, yet from within the broader framework of saving the world, focuses on saving a domestic cause.
662;Mr. and Mrs. Incredibles' struggle in daily suburbia through work, marriage, and children somehow trumps the importance of being worldwide saviors.
663;By the climax of the movie, the audience find themselves more concerned with saving the family that is jeopardy than the world at large.
664;ultimately, good comedy takes a common experience and twists it into something a little extraordinary, like stretching the proportions of a normal looking human into a cartoon character.
665;The Incredibles stretches the normalcy of everyday life into a new level, super charging it with a family of super heroes.
666;The Incredibles is an incredibly original story of superheroes in a world that has come to reject them.
667;Mr. Incredible with his family are in hinding, but his inner erge to be the superhero he used to be gets the best of him.
668;It's entertaining, unique, beautiful and very funny: everything we've come to expect from Pixar.
669;In my opinion it's their best effort yet.
670;In using human characters they've done a remarkable job devoping looks and personalities that fit just right.
671;The basics are that once again the animation was excellent and I thought the story was very clever with the superheroes having to go into hiding and live normal lives.
672;It instantly satisfied my children's need to watch something new!
673;I thought that the Incredibles would finally be the one movie that redeemed the stuido.
674;It was funny, entertaining, interesting, dramatic, etc.
675;The characters were fantastic, and the good superhero/bad superhero plot was great.
676;While I don't have kids, I think older kids (maybe 8 and up) will enjoy this.
677;It's a great a family movie.
678;(My favorite character portrayal: Holly Hunter as Elastigirl.)
679;This movie kept their attention, as well as mine, throughout.
680;My kids love this movie you have to see it with your family.
681;It is more fun then you think it is.
682;This is a great movie .
683;once again fantastic effects by Pixar, nice idea for a movie.
684;I am very happy with it.
685;i must say I am really surprised by this movie, I already expected the kid to like it but I really liked it as well.
686;"The graphics and animation in this movie were very well done
687;Heck even the broccoli on Dash's plate looked good enough to eat.
688;the movie also sounded very good coming out of my out of date but pretty good home theatre system.
689;the actual plot was very good as well and the movie was very well written.
690;It is certainly a movie both kids and adults should love.
691;Its about 2 hours long, but it is able to keep youngins entertained long enough before they get up and start running around.
692;Disney's Pixar is moving up in the world with its new movie, The Incredibles.
693;The show opens with Mr. Incredible, Craig T. Nelson, saving the world again.
694;And, Mr. Incredible is fired along with the rest of the superhero population.
695;But, something happens turning it into a family outing.
696;She does indeed steal the show.
697;This was a pretty good movie.
698;Pixar seems to be getting more sophisticated with each one it makes.
699;You have an interesting story, good plot, fun characters, not a bad show.
700;This deserves at least a one time showing.
701;Movie night with popcorn great.
702;It was enjoyable for everyone in the family, even when my teenage cousins went to see it thinking they were too cool to go to a kiddie movie, they enjoyed it.
703;Apart from the stunning CG .
704;facial expression, light composition, fluid movements, graphic design .
705;etc, The Incredibles sets itself apart with its detailed plot and the meticulously crafted personalities of the main characters.
706;While the young audience will be pleased with the action sequences and sound, the story strikes a deep chord with the middle aged Moms and Dads.
707;Every few minutes, real family issues come up and make The Incredibles family so genuinely human.
708;as entertaining as you can get, this is definitely a must.
709;What's more, it is a piece of art and chicken soup for the adults.
710;The bonus features contain alternate opening scenes, story boards and what a feat the production team had pulled off!
711;This is certainly one of Disney and Pixar's most entertaining animated features to date.
712;Interesting characters and storyline backed by beautifully rendered animation.
713;Highly recommended for both children and adults.
714;In comes Brad Bird, well known for the vastly underrated Iron Giant, he comes and completely thrills while still having it nice enough for the kiddies.
715;bob, 15 years since his glory days, is now a claims worker for an insurance company while Helen is a housewife.
716;So Helen and their 2 kids, Dash and Violet have to go in and help Dad.
717;one thing I like is that it is a kids movie with animation from a company that does kid movies but yet it's got more suspense and big action sequences then the last Spiderman.
718;One scene, the """"100 meter Dash"""" has Pixar calls it, is quite a scene to watch."""
719;Even the humor is there, while not being full of witty puns like previous films, it does have it's nice moments, like when Edna, a superhero costume maker regales Helen of the superheroes whose lives were cut short just because of a cape.
720;the voices are quite nice.
721;And Jason Lee, largely known for his roles in the Jay and Silent Bob films actually does a good job as villain Syndrome.
722;the Incredibles is a sophisticated, eye.
723;The overall movie is so engrossing, I found myself anxiously sitting on the edge of my seat and gleefully laughing at the razor sharp wit and well.
724;i highly recommend this movie for any age movie lover.
725;It's a pleasure to watch something so aesthetically pleasing in a time when Hollywood is putting out a majority of cookie cutter swill, animated or real.
726;Very Funny take on the Superhero genre from Pixar.
727;:) Anyways its a great movie.
728;laden heart, The Incredibles have overtaken those two categories.
729;what I love most about this movie is the way it looks and feels.
730;The CGI is flawless, but what's striking is the James Bond/superspy feel to it (especially Moonraker).
731;It's refreshing to see a superhero.
732;These two points will have you forget that you're watching a superhero movie and while some might say that it's a drawback, I welcome it.
733;Change is a good thing.
734;while it's more violent than Finding Nemo and a little less complex than The Iron Giant, it's still a great movie.
735;We bought this excellent movie when it first came out, and let someone borrow it and it came back damaged.
736;Our family use to watch this movie during family movie night.
737;Now the whole family can watch and enjoy the movie again.
738;i rated this movie a 5 because it's a funny and enjoyable movie for the whole family.
739;Our whole family loves it!
740;Glad to have all of the versions!
741;Great product from a great website!
742;One of my favorite animated movies.
743;The voices for each character was spot on.
744;I hope they do a sequel.
745;Another great computer animated cartoon film by Pixar.
746;This film is truly cool.
747;The characters and its animations are drawn in details in high resolution.
748;If you watch this movie in a big display TV, you'll notice that the colors of the characters and its details are clearly seen.
749;The movement and facial expressions of the characters are so natural and expressive.
750;overall, this is the best computer animated cartoon film I've ever seen!
751;(Previously I said Nemo is the best, but now Nemo is the 2nd.)
752;The action scenes are well done, the interaction of the family is humorous and even touching, and the rest of the characters entertaining.
753;I've previously watched it in the theaters but enjoyed watching it again at home.
754;I just saw this film in high.
755;it looks awesome, as many animated films do now in that format.
756;this was somewhat of a surprise hit when it came out in 2004.
757;Most of the attention was on a competing animated film but this is the one that turned out to be a huge box.
758;Word of mouth helped his immensely.
759;It's what made me check it out, as several friends recommended it.
760;I wound up agreeing with them: it's excellent entertainment.
761;Animated movies have been astounding the past four years and especially now with Blu.
762;as impressive as the visuals and sound are, it's the story that carries this film: a solid combination of humor, drama, suspense, family ties and action.
763;The Incredibles is more than a fabulous animated film, it is simply a Great Movie.
764;It has wonderfully rich characters.
765;It is easy to like Bob and Helen Parr and their children Violet, Dash, and Jack Jack.
766;They are fun as Super Heroes with their own foibles, but seeing them try to live normal lives in the Super Hero Relocation Program is also very funny.
767;bob (Mr. Incredible) and his best buddy Lucius Best (Frozone) try and get their kicks as best they can while maintaining their relocated cover.
768;The way the family gets drawn into the fray is also quite entertaining and is often full of wit and generous touches of humor.
769;the story also lavishes attention on the wonderful Edna E. Mode who is the fashion designer of super hero costumes.
770;the whole cast is great.
771;Craig T. Nelson brings strength, energy, and still gets us to feel real sympathy for Mr. Incredible as Bob.
772;Holly Hunter is great as Helen Parr / Elastigirl.
773;It would be boring to go through each member of the cast, but I found each of them to be superb.
774;the animation is also terrific.
775;The movie is full of great images both big and small.
776;You can pick out wonderful new things during repeated viewings.
777;there is a whole disk of wonderful extras.
778;This is the realization of that magnificent series of voice messages Helen listens to in the limo on the way home to set up the film's denouement.
779;I agree that it didn't need to be in the movie, but it is a wonderful experience all on its own.
780;Love this movie because its a decent family movie that can actually be watched with kids.
781;College kids often enjoy these type of movies more than children!!!
782;Excellent film for all ages.
783;Nice to see some movies we don't have to worry about showing to anyone.
784;Pixar does it again: they are simply today's best studio (better than Disney, better than Dreamworks) at producing great animated films that appeal to the entire family.
785;The Incredibles is destined to become yet another Pixar classic that gets played again and again, years into the future.
786;Almost all kids will instantly identify with Dash, the young boy, and they will be filled with joy as Dash finally gets to use his powers to help save the day.
787;the storyline of The Incredibles is remarkably grown.
788;, which is refreshing to see in a mainstream Hollywood film.
789;old riveted to her seat.
790;My whole family truly enjoyed the film, and can't wait for the next Pixar release.
791;Right at the start I'll say it: I didn't see this at the theaters.
792;This film is yet another winner from Pixar.
793;Those guys get better and better at their craft with each new film.
794;written, the personalities sharply drawn, the dialogue well done.
795;The visuals, as usual for Pixar, are amazing.
796;The special features are great, my favorite being the new short feature 'Jack.
797;Actually, watch the short first then the movie, you'll crack up!
798;Anyway, this film, while not quite as endearing as others in the Pixar canon, is very touching in a more adult way, and seems more geared for the adult audience.
799;Score another solid success for the folks at Pixar!
800;Where Warner Brothers had no idea how to market Bird's first film, Disney had no problem with promoting his new movie and it was a huge hit.
801;The Incredibles is also the first Pixar film with human beings as the central characters, instead of relegated to the margins.
802;They found it with Bird who uses his cartoonish style of caricature to exaggerate a character's physical features and body gestures to make them more identifiable to the audience.
803;packed with a wealth of extra material.
804;All of the animated menus keep in flavour and tone with the look and feel of the movie, which is a really nice touch.
805;The two men constantly praise their hard.
806;working crew for achieving the look and feel that they strove to achieve.
807;Bird touches upon some of the film's themes and plot points in this engaging and informative track.
808;The strengths of caricature vs. realistic art are discussed and it is pointed out that caricature brings out the essence of a character.
809;It shows us what happened between Jack.
810;He does an excellent job talking about each scene.
811;"the ""Behind the Scenes"" section includes a detailed Making of Featurette (and a collection of additional footage) that shows how much time, energy and hard work went into making The Incredibles."
812;This featurette covers all aspects, from story to character design to music and even the customary blooper reel.
813;"Top Secret features a ""vintage"" Mr. Incredible cartoon that is a spot."
814;There are also beautifully designed profiles of all the costumed characters from the movie, even minor ones that are only briefly mentioned.
815;the Incredibles continues Pixar's unprecedented streak of box office and critical successes.
816;It is a refreshing new perspective that features Bird's obsession with the `50s and superheroes.
817;The Incredibles is a near perfect blend of populist sensibilities with an engaging and entertaining story that never condescends to children or alienates adults.
818;This movie is good, considering the movie came before the Fantastic Four movie it was original.
819;unlike Sherk which is clearly a fairy tale, this movies characters live in a real world of insecurities about body image, and unemployment,with children that unexpectedly have adventure forced upon them.
820;disc collectors edition of the incredibles is incredible!
821;The bonus disc is very cool .
822;tells of various involvements regarding the creation of the movie and the movie itself is action.
823;the package arrived in very good condition and in new condition.
824;dropping in scope, creative in execution, and as thrilling as they are beautiful.
825;The characters are wonderful, the animation is superb, and the story is both exciting and funny.
826;This film is a masterpiece.
827;Toy Story and it's sequel are excellent films and I thought that there was no way Pixar could possibly continue creating that level of greatness.
828;While A Bugs Life wasn't one of my favorites, it's still a fantastic film.
829;The ending line in that film is one of my favorite closing moments in cinema.
830;It's simple, heartfelt, and provides a beautiful impression that their world will continue in a positive direction despite the end of the movie(something that kids, the target audience, need to know).
831;Finding Nemo, like all other Pixar films, has a strong family message and it provides us with some beautiful visuals.
832;Again, Pixar built upon it's own accomplishments and provided us with a film that will be heralded as a classic and loved by future generations.
833;As impressed as I am with all of the other Pixar films, and as much as I love them, The Incredibles is better.
834;Well, the story and characters have always been, in my opinion, the heart of a Pixar film.
835;Sure, everything looks amazing and beautiful, but when the audience connects with a character things become more interesting and compelling for the audience.
836;The Incredibles is a real drama.
837;"The characters express more realistic emotions than you might expect from a ""cartoon""."
838;The marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Incredible (aka Mr. and Mrs. Parr) has it's ups and downs.
839;Mrs. Incredible, who is a stay at home mom, is struggling with the kids and her desire to live a normal life and keep the family strong despite their incredible past.
840;They always work to communicate with each other and with the kids.
841;At one point the kids catch them having a very heated argument and they pause, calm themselves, and then take the time to reassure the children.
842;They explain that their argument isn't a good way to express their frustrations, and that they love their children and each other.
843;There's a moment where his mother speaks that truth to him in love, and expresses those exact thoughts.
844;She says it in a way that is honest and firm, but loving.
845;Sure, all of them have amazing abilities, but they're still people and they still have their own flaws.
846;But they communicate with each other.
847;They honestly express their heart in a loving way for the purpose of strengthening their family.
848;His character is a stark contrast to the noble and loving Incredible family.
849;But, they work together to overcome them.
850;It presents a strong family message about love, forgiveness, self.
851;sacrifice, devotion, honesty, compassion, and personal restraint.
852;The story is wonderful and, as in the other Pixar films, is one of the superior elements of the movie.
853;The film is beautiful to behold from the expert handling of light, color, shape, and contour, to the excellent retro.
854;This film is an amazing visual treat because of the astonishing talent driving the technological miracles that Pixar has invented to do what they do.
855;While they sometimes modify existing technologies they also frequently invent their own technologies as they explore new ground in visual storytelling and motion graphics.
856;This is the new impressionism.
857;Everything they show us is designed to provide the audience with a certain feeling about a location and series of events.
858;It's impressionism in motion, and it's beautiful to look at.
859;This film is rated PG for good reason.
860;He is a murderer and takes delight in holding that kind of power over other people.
861;They even create a well orchestrated moment where another one of the bad guys comments on how wrong the villain really is.
862;It's great drama for adults and adolescents, but the littlest of tikes may have trouble with the intense action sequences and powerful dramatic undertones.
863;So, take your family to see this movie.
864;It's a clean, fun, exciting, thrilling, encouraging way to spend two hours with your family.
865;Hard to believe I had not seen this movie before now given the good reviews I've heard over the years.
866;My kids loved it and so did my wife and I.
867;This movie was great, especially the animation.
868;As their first movie that is actually about people rather than animals, monsters, etc, I think they pulled off the human animation perfectly.
869;besides the animation, the movie was great all.
870;One minute, you'll be crying because you're laughing so hard and the next, you'll be at the edge of your seat in suspense.
871;First of all, this is an action movie.
872;The kids and adults love this show!
873;Animated stuff from Pixar is always top notch.
874;A recommended watch for the family.
875;pixar always tops themselves with their movies.
876;"I love the fact that they will actually make ""bloopers"" ."
877;just go the extra effort and work to get the laughs.
878;All the kids love watching it as it's one that they pick on movie night over and over.
879;My wife and I took her 4 year old nephew to see this film and I think that we liked it more than he did.
880;This is so much more than a cartoon, I mean, it was dang near close to being the best film of 2004.
881;What I love so much about this movie is that it's more about family and charactor development than it is about superheros.
882;Then again, the superhero thing is a pretty cool bonus.
883;this is were the real fun begins and the movie turns into an action epic that rivals SpiderMan.
884;Together, with his super family including his kids, The Incredibles save the day.
885;this is a great family film, good for the kids and adults alike.
886;I'm not a father yet, but I can't wait until I am and can watch this movie with my kids.you know, watch something I enjoy too!
887;The Incredibles is a movie that the whole family can enjoy.
888;It is a film that combines just the right mixture of action, suspense, drama, and comedy.
889;The characters are plausible and interesting.
890;holly Hunter plays Helen Parr, former Elastigirl, and she does a great job!
891;Her character made the movie so entertaining that I couldn't imagine the finished product without her.
892;Kudos to Hunter for such an amazing performance!Craig T. Nelson plays Bob Parr, Mr. Incredible, and he does a great job too, though I don't think he was as good as Hunter.
893;Nelson and Hunter worked well together on screen (voices that is).
894;samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee are great voices and parts in this film also.
895;Love love love this movie!
896;So funny, and I love the adult sense of humor in it when I watch it now.
897;It was always one of my favorites as a kid.
898;This is right at the top.
899;It is witty, fun, clever, engaging, and much more.
900;Simply a wonderful film .
901;the first time you see it, the second time you see it, rinse, repeat.
902;pixar film, Pixar shows why they have made millions on their state of the art films.
903;The Incredibles is a movie for everyone, both old and young.
904;It's funny, fast paced and has great voice overs.
905;candy steals the show with amazing imagery and graphics.
906;The story itself is solid and well developed.
907;So I feel very sorry for Disney as any hope for revival left with this excellent film.
908;We had a group party and our 5.5 year olds all the way up to the 12 year olds loved it!
909;I also liked all the characters, though Violet was my personal favorite.
910;There was a lot of humor, the funniest character being the eccentric designer to the superheroes, Edna Mode.
911;was one of a kind, and very sophisticated for a children's movie, though I think most kids would get the gist of it.
912;the tale of a sheep who gets sheered bald once a year and how he learns to deal with that.
913;Boundin' is very cute and kind of funny too.
914;It's one of the few animated movies that both kids and adults can watch and highly enjoy.
915;This is our favorite Pixar flick.
916;We keep hoping they will make a sequel to the movie.
917;So many laugh out loud moments for everyone.
918;i've loved the voice acting in Toy Story 1 and 2 and Finding Nemo in Spanish, and the voice acting in Spanish for movies like Shrek has always been outstanding, and equally enjoyable in either English or Spanish.
919;This movie was delightful treat for my 6 year old.
920;She enjoyed the story family story line as well as the action packed scenes.
921;This movie is great way to captivate the attention of children and adults.
922;My daughter and I enjoyed it thoroughly.
923;my daughter isn't as into this is as her dad, but i still think this is a solid film.
924;A family of superheroes in a world that no longer needs them .
925;Another winner from Pixar that the whole family will love.
926;I enjoyed every minute of this movie, It's great for families to watch and enjoy.
927;took something we are all familiar with and put a fun, new twist on it.
928;And like Toy Story and Shrek, it is a movie that both adults and children throughly enjoy.
929;the movie has everything .
930;a great story line, great dialog, and amazing visuals.
931;the graphics are as good as anything I have ever imagined.
932;This movie carries my highest recommendation.
933;But I feel this movie rises above the rest of the family genre movies.
934;It has a good message about family an is entertaining at the same time for the whole family.
935;Every single one of these characters is hilarious!
936;Edna, the costume designer, Syndrome, the enemy, Frozone, Mr. Incredible's best friend, Mirage, a spy, and more characters!
937;This is a wonderful family movie!
938;It is my 8th and best looking Pixar blu.
939;Thought it kinda dragged a bit at times but once it got going it was very exciting.
940;Very simple and it worked pretty good.
941;the movie truly is Incredible.
942;The movie opens with Mr. Incredible in action, saving the world.
943;Flash forward a dozen years or so.
944;All this changes when an anonymous source calls Mr. Incredible back into action.
945;Even though Bob was fired for lobbing his boss through several cubicle walls, he lies to his family and quietly returns to being a superhero.
946;"Mixing Superman with Family Ties (essentially) is a stroke of genius
947;Bob is nothing short Incredible, and a great family man.
948;He uses his powers for good, and works with the police.
949;He eventually owns up to his mistakes and apologizes.
950;knit and admirable for their devotion to their cause, and each other.
951;They work together as a team, and all use their powers to save the world.
952;Obviously clear themes of good and evil, which are always a plus.
953;(Or something very similar) Great action, great music, great characters.
954;raising in a Pixar film.
955;There was also surprisingly a lot fewer characters in the film.
956;Edna, Bob, Helen, Dash, Violet, Frozone (my favorite Super, and yet we don't see him much at all!)
957;life exposition scenes, are classic in most Pixar films, and absent from this one.
958;The movie is still dazzling and spectacular, and well.
959;There'd better be a sequel.
960;message about animation: """"That's how it SHOULD be done!"""""""
961;Growing up in the 60s with a monthly does of supers in comic book form was a way of life for me.
962;the originality was a step up for computer generated cinema.
963;Sure, there were the requisite good guys and bad guys, all with human qualities and problems, but the emotion of the characters was perfect.
964;It makes you want to go out and be incredible.
965;"For this reason, ""No capes"" was one of my favorite scenes in the film ."
966;Looking down with a laugh and that extra burst was so well executed that that simple short clip deserves an award all by itself.
967;It's possibly the best entertainment of its genre.
968;If all I have to say is that the seller delivered the product as promised in a timely manner, that should be sufficient.
969;also, a few more words, just to make sure Amazon's review.
970;Pixar continues to amaze with each succeeding film they make.
971;"When I saw ""The Incredibles"" in the theatre I was blown away by the films striking visuals which I thought even surpassed their amazing work in ""Finding Nemo""."
972;What intrigued me in a second viewing of the film was the calibre of the writing.
973;Visuals are nice but if you don't have a good story to go with them, so what.
974;writer Brad Bird successfully marries these two elements.
975;The film is more than deserving of the Oscar it received for best animated feature.
976;Inarguably it was one of the better films of 2004.
977;Great for the whole family!
978;simply entertaining and fun for the entire family.
979;We loved it and have watched it many times.
980;this is a great movie.
981;this movie is awesome i love this movie.
982;now mr. incredible is on a mission to regain pepoles faith in superheros.
983;i recommend this movie for eveyone
984;choosing to see this again over Spongebob when it comes out!
985;The story is a lot of fun, and it's funny, how now, as a 30+ year old cubicle dweller, I can relate to Mr. Incredible and his longing for past glories.
986;Pixar's animation is, as always, a real treat.
987;It's amazing how Pixar's characters just come to life, and express more emotional range than a gaggle full of Keanu Reeves.
988;This really is a great family film, and one that adults will be able to enjoy as much as the kids.
989;Your older kids will love it, however, and this is perfect for the adults.
990;It all seemed real because the story is complex, sharp, original, funny, and something to cheer about all at the same time.
991;i loved the voice casting.
992;Craig T. Nelson is heroic sounding Bob Paar/Mr.
993;Holly (Turn to the right!)
994;Hunter is one of my favorite actresses and has a great turn as Elastigirl/Mrs.
995;Another of my favorite small time actors, Wallace Shawn, has a tiny role of Bob's boss at the insurance company.
996;this is probably Pixar's best offering.
997;It looks great, sounds good, has a fun, interesting storyline, and even takes a shot at today's culture, including our somewhat litigious society.
998;It's really a fun popcorn film, and how many animated films can carry that title?
999;A grand slam home run in every sense of the word.
1000;It's refreshing to see fun movies for kids to enjoy and we don't have to worry about.
1001;the additional extras on disc 2 are also well worth a look.
1002;For those who enjoy the process of making movies, there is a storyboard.
1003;"The ""outtakes"", which combine some computer generated goofs like messed up hair and clothes along with intentionally created gaffes, are enjoyable."
1004;There is a section on the superheroes of the story, and a special short about baby Jack.
1005;the Incredibles will find a place in the rotation of movies we watch often, and with the new features in a second dsic, we can only hope for a sequel.
1006;ray version of The Incredibles is stunning.
1007;The colors are rich, and the details are crisp.
1008;The sound also pops as well.
1009;You will have to judge, however, if it is worth the hefty price tag of the Blu.
1010;This is one of the best films I've ever seen, animated or otherwise.
1011;pixar's 2004 animated feature about a super hero and his family who come out of hiding to battle a new villain.
1012;just when Mr. Incredible feels he has hit rock.
1013;Mr. Incredible is successful and looks forward to more exciting assignments.
1014;this is a gem of an animated feature.
1015;Dash and Violet are a joy to watch as they learn how to use their superpowers in the fight against evil, especially Dash's chase sequence when he's pursued by bad guys flying saucer hovercraft.
1016;Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl sorting out their family problems in the midst of this excitement are humorous and all the actors who voice the characters could not have done better.
1017;obviously the ending of this movie leaves options open for a sequel, and while this looks like a promising proposition, Pixar will have to work hard to compliment this feature successfully.
1018;THE INCREDIBLES (forgive the clich ) is just that: absolutely incredible!
1019;the idea behind the plot was truly creativity in action: a super.
1020;"the film also boasts such voices as Holly Hunter and Wallace Shawn (i. e. ""Inconceivable!"""
1021;It's loaded with witty one.
1022;I think it's usually best to let the greats stand alone.
1023;But I would love for there to be an INCREDIBLES 2.
1024;This is my favorite animation movie!
1025;assing by the ladies but its still a good movie.
1026;He asks for it all the time.
1027;The city is full of super heroes who do the work of police and who receive thunderous applause after their life.
1028;Incredible supports the family with an insurance adjuster job, and Helen/Elastigirl struggles to stop sibling squabbles.
1029;taking Dash, and reclusive teenager Violet.
1030;the strength of this movie is the action.
1031;packed plot coupled with witty satire about contemporary American life.
1032;"Small details, such as the ""graduation"" between fourth and fifth grade and the way lawsuits twist the truth, make these otherwise extraordinary people ordinary."
1033;witted adventure movie will delight both kids and adults.
1034;and prepare yourself for some real entertainment.
1035;This is a very cute moving.
1036;packed, thoroughly amusing piece of computer animation, containing the vocal talents of Craig T. nelson as Robert Parr/Mr.
1037;we are introduced to the superheroes as young adults expressing their views, and in one instance, the pitfalls of being a superhero in interviews.
1038;then we see them in action, observing Mr. Incredible's might, Elastagirl's grace and flexibility, and Frozone's lithe ability freeze things, all en route to the wedding of the first two characters.
1039;an amusing touch of realism follows as Mr. Incredible is sued by a man injured when the superhero saves him from a suicide attempt, and then by the survivors of an el train incident.
1040;He and his family suffer because they are denied the right to be the extraordinary people they truly are.
1041;in the meantime, he visits the stylish and eccentric Edna for the refurbishing of his supersuit.

1043;time idol did, and found a better use for his own abilities.
1044;It's a fun story in which to lose onself, and a terrific piece of animation for all ages.
1045;once again, a masterful effort from the crew of Pixar!
1046;"with the first five animated films from Pixar Animation Studios/Walt Disney having great financial success, needless to say, there was a lot of challenges and stress that the crew had to face this time around and to spearhead the project was Brad Bird, the writer and director who has worked on ""The Simpsons"" and ""The Iron Giant"" (and would go on to direct the Pixar animated film, ""Ratatouille""."
1047;First, let me first say that even though this animated film was released back in 2004 and within the improvement of computer animation in the last six years, the film still manages to hold up very well!
1048;In fact, this is probably the best video version to date as the Blu.
1049;ray really shows off the vibrant colors of the film.
1050;hair strands are much more notable, but also the detail of the fabric of the clothing is also much more present and detailed that you can see the actual stitching.
1051;Blacks are inky and deep and the special effects absolutely look awesome.
1052;"In one scene, where Mr. Incredible shows off his new red costume, you can see a little banding but really, this is the best I have seen of ""The Incredibles"" by far."
1053;"I love action films that know how to use the LFE and really make you fel it and in this case, ""The Incredibles"" delivers!"
1054;Literally, the lossless soundtrack delivers in immersive sound that really gives you a feeling of the action that is taking place!
1055;Not only was this lossless soundtrack magnificent, it definitely make a big difference during my viewing and enhanced my love for the film.
1056;Audiophiles will love the lossless soundtrack!As for subtitles, they are in English, French and Spanish.
1057;"sPECIAL FEATURES:""The Incredibles"" comes with the following special features:DISC 1* Director's Commentary ."
1058;depth on the characters, the action, the performance, their powers, animation and more.
1059;Both commentaries are split but definitely worth listening to if you are wanting a career in the industry.
1060;This feature has optional commentary.

1062;An interactive map of the New Nomanison island.
1063;up things that happen in the film that probably would fly over the head of children but make the adults smile.
1064;And the answer to that is YES!
1065;There was a lot of things that happened during the making of this film and you start to realize how much of a challenge these individuals, these departments at Pixar had to face when creating this film.
1066;And it's important to note that at the time when Pixar Animation Studios had films based on toys, insects, animals, etc., to have an all.
1067;"executed made ""The Incredibles"" so entertaining and fun!Peter Travers of Rolling Stone Magazine wrote that ""The Incredibles"" was #6 on his list of the best films of the decade and to tell you the truth, when I think about films that I have watched more than 3.5 times in the last decade, there are not many."
1068;"fi twist to it, ""The Incredibles"" is an exciting film that will continue to entertain generations to come."
1069;"disc Combo Pack"" is an excellent release."
1070;ray disc with the movie and new special features, a second Blu.
1071;This is truly a magnificent release from Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment and fans should be happy with this release, especially with how awesome this film looks on Blu.
1072;ray and its wonderful lossless soundtrack.
1073;ray of the movie itself.
1074;My daughters love this movie.
1075;They are always asking to watch the Super hero movie.
1076;Its even fun for adults to watch.
1077;This film is a masterpiece .
1078;certainly the best cartoon I have ever seen, and one of the very best films in any genre .
1079;The film stars a family of superheroes .
1080;a spoof of the Bond Goldfinger movie.
1081;"It is also fun to contrast the hilarious attempts of the family to blend in (daughter Violet: ""normal ."
1082;Bob longs for the days to be a hero again, and to see him contain himself is just hilarious, and yet sympathetic at the same time.
1083;Its interesting to see them develop in confidence, and learn to use their powers in new ways.
1084;Finally, I enjoyed seeing them learn to work together as a family .
1085;"The ""Jack Jack Attack"" short movie on disk 2 fits in with the main film, and is also hilarious."
1086;style band music also suits the film perfectly .
1087;It could appeal to some kids who have the attention span to follow a story, but I think it has more appeal for adults who can admire creativity and craftsmanship.
1088;I bought the Incredibles movie, 2 Disc Collectors Edition.
1089;Now this is a good show, a wonderful take on the classic superhero plot, doesn't matter what your age range you will enjoy this movie.
1090;The visuals were dizzingly beautiful and the action scenes are exhilerating!
1091;This is may just be my best movie of 2004 and I hate most of what Hollywood spews out.
1092;Love this movie, came quick and plays great plus it was a good price.
1093;Came unwrapped so I knew I got a good deal.
1094;I found it very funny and even my older teenagers (19yr and 14yr) ended up liking it too.
1095;This film, much like Shrek, is proof positive that American animation is coming of age to provide entertainment to both children and adults.
1096;it's a playful foot and holler for all.
1097;This movie is classic animated storytelling at it's best.
1098;It appeals to all ages and I could watch it over and over.
1099;"Pixar's movies are relatively few and far between but when they do come, they are absolutely incredible and that also implies with their sixth animated feature entitled ""The Incredibles"" and while I may find it to not quite be on the level of like ""Monsters Inc."" or ""Finding Nemo"", ""The Incredibles"" is once again another touch down for the animators at the Pixar Studio."
1100;The Incredibles is the fastest paced Pixar animated movie that I've ever seen and like the five Pixar movies before then, this animated feature continues the streak of unparalleled originality that only Pixar seem to generate and bring to the big screen.
1101;"While not on the `wow' scale of ""Monsters Inc."" or ""Finding Nemo"", the animation is great and unparalleled."
1102;Who knows what Pixar will come up with next.
1103;Go and see this movie today!
1104;one such hero, Mr. Incredible, voiced by Craig Nelson, is having a hard time making the adjustment.
1105;He has married another hero, called Elastigirl, and they have raised a family, each of which is possessed of super skills.
1106;This gets them noticed, and before he knows it, Mr. Incredible has a top secret crime fighting job on the side.
1107;this movie definitely deserved the Oscar award for best animated feature.
1108;The animation is top of the line.
1109;The action scenes are exciting, and despite the cartoon appearance, can be breathtaking.
1110;There is an ample amount of good comedy as well.
1111;Its silly without the commentary, but incredibly funny with it.
1112;Also, the files on the various heroes are fun.
1113;this is a great movie for families.
1114;Kids will love the super hero action and some of the silliness.
1115;I highly recommend this movie.
1116;i really enjoyed this movie in the theater, and i was surprised at how much i enjoyed it again at home.
1117;plus, it's got a bonus jack.
1118;jack all of which have special powers.
1119;The story like most cartoons pits good against evil however this story forces the entire family to band together to discover and/or rediscovery their true source of power.
1120;They are REALLY good .
1121;so you may want to watch it with them.
1122;And that is a win.
1123;Although an animated feature, the Incredibles is one that will appeal to all ages.
1124;The story is definitely a whole new spin on the super hero theme that has been over.
1125;The Incredibles is truly a visually stunning animation by the creative team at Pixar.
1126;Behind the excellent visuals is an extremely well.
1127;it mixes elements from yesteryear's superhero stories that we have come to known with modern day relevance to good effect.
1128;minute odd appearance is simply memorable as her motor.
1129;mouth and clever wit are irresistably charming.
1130;a* entertainment for kids and adults alike.
1131;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
1132;It' is a family oriented movie.
1133;One of the best animated films out there.
1134;Fun for the whole family.
1135;It is a good movie with some great action and wonderful animation.
1136;there are some rather intense battle scenes that some of the younger kids might freak out at.
1137;The humor element was subtle but definitely present in this movie.
1138;There are enough elements for the adults (or big kids as I am called) to enjoy.
1139;Pixar Animation Studios is without a doubt the best studio making movies right now.
1140;I love all their films and having to pick one as your favorite is a really tough decision that has to be done with some serious thinking.
1141;Still, as fantastic as every Pixar film is, I've always have had a softer spot for The Incredibles and I have to call it my favorite Pixar film.
1142;since its release in 2004, TI has been one of my favorite films of all time.
1143;The story is excellent, the characters are endearing, it's action packed and has amazing animation.
1144;Brad Bird really created a masterpiece.
1145;TI resonate in so many levels because it's not only a fantastic super hero film, it's also a fantastic film about family, relationships, and a lot more.
1146;The level of sharpness and detail is mesmerizing, colors are bright and blacks are balanced.
1147;A fantastic transfer through and through.
1148;The sound is so clear, so vibrant that you will believe the crashings and the bangings are happening in your living room.
1149;"Also you got a PIP commentary on the excellent short ""Jack."
1150;this two BD set will leave you exhausted because is so full of material about the film that you will become an Incredibles expert.
1151;An excellent set all around.
1152;It's a masterpiece and this new BD set, with amazing picture and sound and hours upon hours of bonus features, it's a must.
1153;however, we love movies, and are eager to go out and see the newest family movie playing in the theater.
1154;'The Incredibles' is a great movie, that is funny, loving and teaches families to stick together.
1155;Shopping at Amazon is a real value.
1156;We loved this movie and we'll tell you why right here.
1157;mom says: This was a great family movie.
1158;Smart and funny with humor that could be appreciated by young and old alike.
1159;Son says: I really liked how the whole Incredibles family worked together at the end, even Jack.
1160;my favorite part was when Jack.
1161;And that's why we loved it!
1162;"The lawsuits that put the ""Supers"" out of business is certainly a real gem and it gives Brad Bird who wrote and directed ""The Incredibles"" some unexplored avenues to try, which he does and it turned out, well ."
1163;Wow, that's enough right there to keep us busy.
1164;SATISFYING FAMILY ISSUES and MUCH MORE:After these elements are set into motion, we have EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS, and it is fascinating to see all the Incredibles' family issues worked out like any other family's, but with many interesting twists.
1165;"jack Attack"" is probably the high point of the features and illustrates what we did not see going on between ""Jack."
1166;"The files about the ""Supers"" are interesting."
1167;If you like to go in for it, you can spend the day with the features alone.
1168;This is the best animated film, in my opinion, and is perfect for all members of the family (of all ages) to connect with in a fun.
1169;"It has all of the entertainment value of ""Toy Story"" or ""Finding Nemo"", but has more appeal for adult audiences in my view."
1170;When this film opened in my area, I had no doubt that I would be seeing the best film of the year, that is original, funny, witty and.
1171;i hope that Disney/Pixar KEEPS UP WITH THAT tradition and releases the best of the best.
1172;although Shrek 2 is a good film, it wasn't heartfelt, but the good thing here is that it wan't aiming to be heartfelt.
1173;ages sense of humor, a masterfully paced storyline, wonderfully rounded characters and genuinely perfect casting, the filmmakers have left little cause for concern.
1174;Spotted throughout with nods, winks and nudges of all shapes and sizes for the dedicated comic book fans that are bound to be in the audience, the plot remains easily.
1175;accessible for those who may have never even seen a funny book.
1176;On top of that, its excellent sense of timing and regular ability to one.
1177;The perfect family film, it's also something I have no shame over watching repeatedly by my lonesome.
1178;Looks even better than I remembered in brilliant Blu.
1179;This movie made my children and I both really excited when it was time to watch.
1180;I love all the scenes and characters.
1181;I really think this is a family fun movie.
1182;Pixar continues to improve their craft with each film and The Incredibles is no exception.
1183;Probably one of the greatest animated films of all time, this film plays great for adults and kids.
1184;The animation is stunning and the music score and characters are pitch perfect in the super entertaining action film packed film.
1185;this is my favorite Pixar film next to WALL E.
1186;Great heroics, comedy, and a message.
1187;all the things a comic should be are brought out in this movie that is at once a tribute and send up of Superheroes.
1188;sadly, the things that make Pixar movies really unique, the extra's, are just not even there.
1189;The little movie with the baby, an event that takes place during the main movie, was funny, but could have been on the end of disk 1.
1190;It will make a pretty coaster.
1191;But, when I finally saw the movie on cable, I had to admit, I actually liked it, a lot!
1192;Super strength (ala DC Comics Superman, Uncle Sam)Ms. Incredible:1.
1193;"after I got over my ""prejudice,"" I found the movie very well done."
1194;This movie is enjoyable for all ages, and for several viewings.
1195;I have seen it before, and I am happy to own it!
1196;This is a wonderful family movie, teaching the value of loyalty and the importance of protecting those you love.
1197;We enjoy watching this together every time!
1198;Pixar Animation can you really say enough about it?
1199;Take it from this 50+ grandmother The Incredibles make for an Incredibly good time!
1200;I really wanted to love this movie, but I found alotof it to be boring.
1201;So many people giving this movie5 stars, is insane!
1202;they always do a great job on the animation, but thestory as usual, not so incredible!
1203;Pixar has again released another fine piece of work for the entire family.
1204;The story is entertaining to both children and adults.
1205;An animated film with great visual and sound effects that actually has (gasp!)
1206;But would be plenty enjoyable for the kids as well, the theme of non.
1207;and lastly but not least, if you like to watch a lot of films like this a good home theater system with a capable subwoofer is a must.
1208;friendly messages and characters in favor of straight.
1209;ahead action and a decidedly adult perspective on the power of family and self.
1210;Combine a smart, heartfelt script that addresses these themes intelligently with of course, the predictably amazing animation, and the result is a startling creation that sharpens the mind as well as dazzles the senses.
1211;Enter Mirage, a mysterious woman who offers Bob an opportunity to resume his former identity on a remote volcanic island.
1212;There, Mr. Incredible meets up with his nemesis, Syndrome, a techno.
1213;archival footage at the beginning, the visual invention is continuously breathtaking all the way to the inevitable ending.
1214;Like all the Pixar films though, the vocal talent is a perfect match for the visuals .
1215;The animation of the humans is obviously stylized but remarkably convincing capturing expressions with surprising subtlety.
1216;The location animation is just as impressive.
1217;First, the direct digital transfer and the Dolby Digital 5.1 EX soundtrack are phenomenal, replicating the in.
1218;theater experience as much as technologically possible.
1219;Bird and producer John Walker provide insightful commentary on an alternate track.
1220;"Disc 2 has two great shorts: ""Jack."
1221;of documentaries, both really intriguing looks at the hugely collaborative effort involved.
1222;But the funniest piece may be the faux.
1223;"ancient cartoon, ""Mr. Incredible and Pals"", which hilariously uses the old live lip."
1224;Great movie and a great package.
1225;Super powers are one of the most used ideas today, and yet the Pixar had to use them.
1226;original, most disgusting, most fatigue piece by Pixar.
1227;This is fun for kids and adults.
1228;and is a great demo scene and good workout for any decent surround system.
1229;decent story line, some definite funny parts, but overall eh so so for us.
1230;I'm glad I was able to SEE what this movie was about.
1231;The story, the characters, the writing.
1232;This is the best superhero movie ever made.
1233;It blends the best aspects of every comic book movie into one full package and perfects each and every one to make a brilliant and exciting superhero movie that I will remember as the best superhero movie ever made, not the worst sequel to Toy Story.
1234;"It's ""fun for the whole family"" with this one."
1235;You heard correctly, it's a full.
1236;"I've been a Pixar fan since ""Toy Story"", and I didn't have any kids at that time."
1237;my son, who is almost 4, was entranced.
1238;Plus, seeing one of them get way out of shape and then whip himself back into shape is one of the funniest parts of the movie.
1239;it did drag a bit, but I felt very much entertained by most parts.
1240;It was an overall good time at the movies.
1241;i recommend it to ages 4 and up.
1242;One of my favorite animated films.
1243;But I also like greek mythology, probably why I love this movie so much.
1244;The whole family loved this movie, 2 year old to 25 year old, great movie, going to watch it over and over
1245;The characters are good, and there is lots of funny stuff going on.
1246;It is one of our favorite movies!
1247;Between this one, Finding Nemo, Toy Story, and Cars my kids are happy campers
1248;I love super heros and it's funny it teaches a lesson to Mr. incredible and Elastagirl,Dash, Violet.
1249;Now, the whole family can enjoy it!
1250;with kids in the house, sometimes takes longer to get through a movie
1251;it's incredibly entertaining even after watching it about 20 times.
1252;My daughter loves it and so do we.
1253;She calls them the Super heroes!
1254;She LOVES it and so do I!
1255;This is a great movie.
1256;My child just loves it.
1257;To me this is a pretty funny animation.
1258;A lot of action too.
1259;I have to say I absolutely loved the film.
1260;Because of lawsuits, Mr. incredible and Elastigirl are forced into retirement.
1261;They live in a quaint suburban home.
1262;I especially liked how they captured the teen angst that Violet was going through.
1263;Pixar continues to impress me with their use of computer graphics with every film they churn out.
1264;as far as animated films goes, Pixar has managed to outclass their rival Dreamworks with the excellent storywriting and impressive use of CGI.
1265;Kudos for Brad Bird for making a movie that people of all ages can enjoy.
1266;Of all the Disney projects that got a continuation, this one is really the most deserving.
1267;Not for anything this incredible picture won de Academy Award for best Animated Picture.
1268;This time all the team at Pixar Studios push themselves to the limit and brought up with this amazing movie.
1269;"All the ""retro"" look of the production design remind us a kind of Sean Conery's 007 sagas."
1270;The scenarios, the direction, all the little and insignificant details are very well created.
1271;excepting that, this is a very cool movie!
1272;It got here really fast and I was able to enjoy it.
1273;This film is simply amazing and is such a joy to watch.
1274;The animation is so fluid,colorful and so first class.
1275;Pixtar made a film which combines not only top notch animation, but a very good story and great action.
1276;At times you your jaw will hit the floor and your mind will be will with such wonderment on how well the film flows and the incredible scenes you are watching on the screen.
1277;You can tell that such care and master craftmanship went into the production of The Incredibles.
1278;Wonder voice overs are provided by Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter and Samuel L. Jackson.
1279;If you are an adult, this film will turn you into a kid again.
1280;So go see it for yourself.
1281;Nothing so special in this story.
1282;When this movie was deliver she loved it
1283;I have watched numerous animated movies with my kids and grand kids but this one is still my favorite.
1284;Good fairy tale about being exceptional (super powers) in a world where you have to hide it from the ordinary people, about how people who idolize their heroes can turn against them, about how a dysfunctional family can become functional by defeating the forces of evil.
1285;As an adult I find it generally upbeat and fun.
1286;Earthquake in a box finally gets a showcase.
1287;Tons of fun for everyone.
1288;Be it a computer animated movie, claymation, hand drawn, it doesn't matter.
1289;If the characters are interesting, and the story is good, you caught my attention.
1290;with that being said, The Incredibles (in my opinion) is the best blu.
1291;first of all its the perfect blend of comedy and action.
1292;The movie was superbly directed, the voice acting is outstanding, the story is captivating, and quite honestly, you just need to watch it to get the full picture.
1293;ray version of this movie is .
1294;There are so many little details (like the family's strands of hair for example) that are enhanced with the abilities of blu.
1295;way decent home theater system, the uncompressed audio of this BD disc will make you feel immersed in the movie.
1296;It is honestly a jaw.
1297;dropping masterpiece by Pixar and Disney, and well worth every.
1298;oriented computer animated feature film, invented and pioneered by Pixar Animation Studios, has seen a great decline in the past couple of years.
1299;Lots of humor and silliness for the kids, with some clever pop.
1300;culture references for adults, lots of talking inanimate objects voiced by recognizable and popular celebrities, a song by a bankable pop star.
1301;Wrap it all up in a bright, shiny package and advertise it on Nickelodeon and network TV and you've got a recipe for success.
1302;It is yet another staggering success for Pixar Animation Studios.
1303;"This is first hinted at by the film's rating
1304;It's a real movie with real heart told with extraordinary skill and style.
1305;Yes, it's also an incredibly fun story about superheroes with lots of stunts, action, giant robots, superpowers and an evil villain.
1306;I found it to be one of the most satisfying, and best, movies of 2004.
1307;It's a great movie that anyone can love and appreciate.
1308;A great story for the whole family.
1309;My wife and I both enjoy a nice super hero family (and friends) triumphing over the bad guy.
1310;Nothing even close to R rated in this.
1311;This movie had something for each member of the family to like.
1312;Pixar has been producing top.
1313;Finding Nemo was a pleasant surprise, and Ellen DeGeneres always gives me a chuckle, but it was a little too kiddy.
1314;Part of what makes Pixar's movies so great is that they're crafted to appeal to just about everyone.
1315;They got the physical comedy and the cute visuals for the kid in diapers and the smart sarcasm for the guy who sits in a cubicle, sips his coffee, and watches Homestar Runner on his computer when the boss isn't looking.
1316;Well, I'm happy to say that Pixar has sealed its place in my moviegoing heart as the premiere animating team of the 21st century after seeing this here picture.
1317;The Incredibles is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
1318;Pixar, you've really outdone yourselves once again.
1319;Besides providing an insightful message on nuclear family togetherness and delivering an incredibly (pun intended) sharp script chock full of satire and inspired pop culture references, """"The Incredibles"""" is an action movie of the best kind, rivaling a few of the sequences in, dare I say it, """"Spider."""
1320;"man 2"", also one of my favorites from 2004."
1321;It's a very clever scene, and gives the film that nostalgic retro feel.
1322;It's also a technological breakthrough.
1323;It's amazing to see how director Brad Bird pulled off incorporating the static from the documentary camera and enabling it to fit with the all.
1324;Anywho, Mr. Incredible works with cool.
1325;ice hero Lucius Best, aka Frozone (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) and super.
1326;Everything is going great, saving the day and all that good stuff, gettin' married and everything, until Mr. Incredible saves a guy who didn't want to be saved, and accidentally causes some excessive damage to Metroville's monorail.
1327;Helen is a housewife and takes care of their three children: superfast 10.
1328;She can turn invisible and make force fields.
1329;Brad Bird, who also voices the hilarious fashion designer for the supers Edna Mode, did a fantastic job on this movie.
1330;"Bird, who also worked as a creative consultant on ""The Simpsons"" in its glory days as well as ""King of the Hill"", knows how to do animated movies."
1331;While there are plenty of things to keep the kids (and adults) happy (the exciting action, the slapstick of Mr. Incredible), I think Bird intended to reach a teen/adult audience with the sharp script, the clever observations of teenage angst and suburban life, the midlife crisis, and the pop culture references.
1332;The characters are in realistic situations and are given 3.
1333;dimensional depth by the great script and cast to make their problems seem all the more believable.
1334;Don't get me wrong, I love zany cartoons just as much as the next guy, but to take cartoon characters and make them believable, even more so than a lot of live.
1335;Michael Giacchino provides the musical score.
1336;"This young, raw talent also composed music for the supercool WWII games ""Medal of Honor"" and ""Call of Duty"", as well as the TV Show ""Alias""."
1337;recorded score is brilliant and Giacchino, like Bird, is a sensational talent that everyone should look out for.
1338;Lets just say it's a family that finally comes together to use their super powers against an evil villan.
1339;Each has a unique power and collectively they complement.
1340;Ordered The Incredibles at a great deal and received it very quick!
1341;Was kept up on status of product and recieved it earlier than was told!
1342;Energetic, visually adventurous and surprisingly edgy, the half.
1343;"director Brad Bird, an outsider, was ""a strong cup of coffee"" to deal with, one Pixar staffer reports with a nervous laugh."
1344;"the docu is backed by an unusual ""more making."
1345;Most of the content is worthwhile and non.
1346;winning CG feature looks sensational in its pure digital.
1347;see extra is the lengthy black.
1348;"Some of the illustrators Bird brought with him reflect on making the transition from traditional (""2."
1349;cool retro score and its old.
1350;"the basic plot has been covered by others here, but my thinking on the film is that it has a lot of the original James Bond films in them
1351;the fact that as an adult I can connect with the film on many levels makes for an enjoyable experience, but the Pixar team has to be given a lot of kudos here as well.
1352;Pixar does a great job with finding the right voices, the right direction, and crafting a smart story that doesn't talk down to the audience.
1353;My son got scared once, and I told him to shut his eyes and it will pass, and he felt much better.
1354;It made me feel like a kid.
1355;The story is funny and so adequate for super.
1356;I loved every bit of it.
1357;I also liked the fact that you could adjust to settings to have the best picture (THX setting).
1358;Me and my girlfriend love to watch this movie from time to time.
1359;It's defiantly a great classic that's great for all ages.
1360;What an incredible animation movie from Pixar.
1361;It is just full of wit, superb settings and animation, an eye for detail, and works at all levels.
1362;It also sends up spy movies almost as extensively.
1363;notch and inspired visuals, the jokes that almost always strike true, and just the wealth of ideas in there.
1364;hour rollercoaster rock'n roll funride that completely overwhelmed us both.
1365;My family and me all watched and love A Bug's Life, Toy Story 1 and 2, Monsters Inc. and Finding Nemo.
1366;They rank well above all other animated movies we've seen, even the traditional but excellent Disney movies.
1367;How Pixar is going to surpass this one with their next movie is beyond me.
1368;And surpass it they will, trust me, because they've been doing this over the years with every new flick they produced.
1369;The sites, scenery, backgrounds, vehicles, costumes, panoramas, shooting angles are all highly original.
1370;All the characters of """"The Incredibles"""" are, as always, phantastic, original, and well."""
1371;I can recommend this supermovie to everybody, kids and adults alike.
1372;As far as I'm concerned, this movie deserves an Oscar nomination.
1373;I may even return to the theater to see it a second time.
1374;"To quote Bill and Ted on this movie: ""Truly excellent, dude !"
1375;Pixar's 'The Incredibles' is beautiful to look at.
1376;It features the studio's signature attention to detail, character design and truly spectacular CGI animation.
1377;we laugh at the antics of the CGI ogre and his donkey, but we fall in love with the performances that Pixar's characters give us in stories that remind us of ourselves as much as entertain us.
1378;It was flooded with so much heart and love that what would have been a great story was drowned in a vat of maudlin sacchrinity.
1379;witty and funny and great take on the superhero thing
1380;I absolutely loved The Incredibles and it stands up to watching again and again.
1381;The animation is fabulous, the characters and their voices are perfect and the movie appeals to everyone from kids to adults.
1382;there are some scary moments, some heartbreaking ones, but this movie is generally a good one for most ages.
1383;up enough to appeal to adults.
1384;Yet, there is plenty of action that kids will enjoy.
1385;The movie pretty much keeps trucking along at a quick pace and is never boring.
1386;The love of this family who come together to save lives, and each other, is wonderful to watch.
1387;"I am not a big fan of animation but along with ""Finding Nemo"" this is the best animated film."
1388;It is smart, campy (darrrrrling) and delivers a great family values message.
1389;It is a funny film that would appeal to all audiences, no matter how old or young you are!
1390;Samuel L. Jackson and all the cast members deliver their voices with enthusiasm and get into their character!
1391;"There is absolutely no doubt that this will win the Oscar for ''best Animated Feature Film"" at the next Academy Awards in that fairly new category."
1392;"It will join ""Finding Nemo"" in a huge blockbuster and legendary animated film!"
1393;I highly recommend this for children of all ages.
1394;One of the movies you will watch over and over again.
1395;Kids loved it, it's a bit noisy for adults but a great story plot.
1396;this movie picks you up immediately and takes you away into its wholesome fantasy until the end.
1397;It is funny for all ages .
1398;I found myself cackling out loud in many parts, it's just so funny and such a fun movie to sit and watch.
1399;The characters are all great!!!
1400;I think it's the best childrens' movie I've seen since one of the Toy Story movies .
1401;This was a gift to my husband he loves this movie.
1402;one of this favorite movies it's a great movie.
1403;This is fun for the whole family, from start to finish.
1404;No matter who you are, yes ever girls, will love this superhero family movie.
1405;well they are so you'll wish you had this to watch prior to seeing the new one
1406;this parady of hero's of what looks like the golden or silver age of comics.
1407;starting off with the Heroic stars of the movie.
1408;with Mr. incredible on the case .
1409;She has force field and invisable capablities.
1410;then in a true team spirit the Family saves the city.
1411;there is one more memeber of the family Jack Jack.
1412;who is a baby and is good for extra comic babysitting releif.
1413;this movie is fun mostly fast paced and shows what real team work can do.
1414;That domestic family dinner scene encapsulates the brilliant charm of the film.
1415;when super strong Mister Incredible and the ever so flexible elastic.
1416;But he secretly yearns for the good old days .
1417;But when Mr. Incredible finds himself trapped, only his family will be able to save him!THE INCREDIBLES is the next wonderful film from PIXAR films, continuing a winning streak from TOY STORY, A BUG'S LIFE, TOY STORY 2, MONSTERS, INC. and FINDING NEMO.
1418;But this is the first film of theirs with an all.
1419;Craig T. Nelson (POLTERGEIST) and Holly Hunter (BROADCAST NEWS) are top drawer as the Parrs.
1420;writer Director Brad Bird (IRON GIANT) pays homage to many superhero films, but the Incredibles cleverly becomes more of a James Bond.
1421;drawer and the musical score is a creative twist on the Bond Sound.
1422;"An entertaining running commentary as well as ""making of"" material for those interested in a look behind the magic."
1423;"A funny ""Blooper"" reel and a short film called JACK."
1424;Out in theatres the same time as THE POLAR EXPRESS, The Incredibles proves to be more powerful than a locomotive.
1425;No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again.
1426;Can we keep it clean for.
1427;"It's a fantastically entertaining animated action film, but there's also a subtext about a sort of American ""Cultural Revolution,"" in which the gifted and talented are forced into menial servitude."
1428;"The father has great strength, to protect his family
1429;And Frozone's ice making super power is just an extension of his incredible cool.
1430;hero lifestyle take a toll on the Incredible family.
1431;Dash wants to use his powers and actually be special.
1432;He wants to trick people into thinking he's a real hero, and ultimately sell technology to the masses that will make everyone super.
1433;One's motivation comes from the heart, and the other's comes from ego.
1434;the result of all this hero bashing is captured in a pretty chilling scene, in light of recent events.
1435;A plane loaded with an intelligent but unfeeling robot is heading toward an American city skyline, with instructions to tear everything apart.
1436;But in the end, the Incredible family combine their powers, becoming even stronger as a team than they were individually.
1437;Brad and the others are impressed, and they whoop and applaud.
1438;That's how you accomplish incredible things, and that's what this movie is about.
1439;even better than I had hoped.
1440;This is truly one of the best cartoons.
1441;i thought the professor was the funniest.
1442;The incredibles attempts a bold move by borrowing its plot from the popular James Bond movie thunderball.
1443;The incredibles has alot of humour that adults will enjoy.
1444;frozone really makes the movie fun, """"Honey where is my super suit?"""""""
1445;"Tell me where my super suit is WOMAN ""This is for the greater good!"""
1446;I am the greatest 'good' you are ever gonna get!
1447;Kids love to quote Edna: You can't!
1448;helen, elastic girl is happy with her mundane life.
1449;I promise I'll slow up!
1450;"I'll only be the best by a tiny bit!"""
1451;Edna was right about capes!
1452;"The Incredibles"" really is a great film for real children and those merely hiding in grownup bodies."
1453;The combination of director Brad Bird and Pixar have created a fun excursion into the world of superheroes, complete with relevant modern.
1454;"Every time other film production companies feel like they are catching up to Pixar, the renowned CG animators make a great leap forward with something like ""Incredibles"", leaving the competition in the dust again."
1455;A dastardly force is about to be unleashed from an uncharted island, and Mr. Incredible and his super family are their to save the world in the nick of time!The direct.
1456;digital transfer is a marvel to behold.
1457;Yes, it won an Academy Award for best animated film, but I really think that should have gone to Shrek 2.
1458;the animation was better and it was much more funny.
1459;Toy Story is still my ultimate favorite cg film.
1460;Great job, I've watched it again and again already.
1461;"And so do my boys 
1462;p and the best part is its only $15, I get frustrated that Disney movies are so expensive so I love that the downloads are only $15
1463;I think it is a great idea but I am not sure that I will download videos again.
1464;This film comes from the classic years when every Pixar film that came out combined top artistry in its animation and profound emotional punch at a point in the film when the viewer isn't expecting it.
1465;Shrek is Love Shrek is Life.
1466;My husband and son went to see this movie at the theatre and came back and described the movie as being """"incredible""""!!!"""
1467;It's wonderfully made, it's a nice, 'clean' family movie, the animation is awesome, all involved in the making of this movie did an outstanding job!
1468;"Plus a whole lot of ""cool"" tossed in for good measure."
1469;"the Incredibles takes the classic elements of the comic book ""good vs evil"" story and adds wry humor, dashing swagger, cool bravado and a jazzy soundtrack that would be well suited for a Sean Connery Bond film."
1470;Just when you think that they have pulled out all the stops Pixar finds a new way to keep you on the edge of your seat in the brillantly paced and rendered action sequences.
1471;the film plays out as cleverly as a spy fiction, as fun as a family film, and as awe inspiring as the original release of Star Wars, with a hip brassy style all its own.
1472;musicThe score is an impressive bit of retro swanky jazz that gives the film that 60's era feel.
1473;The composer, Micheal Giachinno, who has been known for doing television and video game scores captures the throaty brass themes used in 60's era film scores perfectly while keeping the tone fast and fun.
1474;Even more impressively instead of using the modern multi.
1475;channel recording system to mix the individual parts together he recorded all the musicians at once with a single microphone to give it the classic feel.
1476;Brings back the swagger and bravado of heroes of yester.year while bringing new elements forth to make a style that is unique to itself.
1477;This is one movie the whole family enjoys and can watch over and over again.
1478;This disney film is considered a classic.
1479;The Incredibles is a great movie, showing the results of lawsuits driving superheroes into hiding and seclusion, forcing them to live normal lives.
1480;"the special features are OK, the best part being the ""voice recording"" of Universal Man in the Top Secret section of disc 2."
1481;There is a lot of production special footage that I actually liked, but non.
1482;still the best Pixar movie.
1483;cOM have told everything that should be told about THE INCREDIBLES, this awesome animation blockbuster by Pixar and Disney and winner of 2005 Academy Award in its genre.
1484;the plot for the movie is highly smart (a funny couple of retired superheroes with three superhero kids that suddenly face a new assignment to save mankind), the characters are extremely plausible, the voices are terrific and the score is even better.
1485;"one reader wisely wrote that THE INCREDIBLES is ""a real movie with real heart told with extraordinary skill and style""."
1486;"Another said that ""This is a movie that has just about everything: great script, great animation and editing, awesome cast, and even a great soundtrack!"""
1487;tHE INCREDIBLES: lots of superhero fun for the entire family!
1488;Seven year old grandson loved it.
1489;I'd seen The Incredibles in a theatre but still enjoyed it the second time.
1490;"The ""incredible"" skills each has is so wonderfully appropriate to his or her family role."
1491;somewhere between realistic and fall.
1492;during action scenes, characters move fast!
1493;Every thing about it is wonderful, design, characters, plot, soundtrack.
1494;I'm still hoping for a good sequel!
1495;Entertaining fun and humor for both adults and children!
1496;Up to a point , we had liked much of the the film , in varying amounts .
1497;The first time I saw The Incredibles, I laughed loudly in the theater.
1498;This qas a very fun and very funny movie.
1499;Pixar and Disney asked that question and herein lies the premise of part of this movie.
1500;voice casting is just spot on.
1501;It is very entertaining and wish Disney come up with a second movie about this family of heroes.
1502;If you're a comic reader, this film is a must.
1503;"The lawsuits that put the ""Supers"" out of business is certainly a real gem and it gives Brad Bird who wrote and directed ""The Incredibles"" some unexplored avenues to try, which he does and it turned out, well ."
1504;Wow, that's enough right there to keep us busy.
1505;SATISFYING FAMILY ISSUES and MUCH MORE:After these elements are set into motion, we have EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS, and it is fascinating to see all the Incredibles' family issues worked out like any other family's, but with many interesting twists.
1506;"jack Attack"" is probably the high point of the features and illustrates what we did not see going on between ""Jack."
1507;"The files about the ""Supers"" are interesting."
1508;If you like to go in for it, you can spend the day with the features alone.
1509;This is the best animated film, in my opinion, and is perfect for all members of the family (of all ages) to connect with in a fun.
1510;Incredible, yes that is exactly it.
1511;The movie has drama and its action packed its great for kids and adults alike who loves Computer Animation movies and super heroes on spandex :PIts great do not take my word for it and watch it over and over and over again.
1512;a good movie but the girls did not like it much, probably more for boys.
1513;This one was just as unique as the others.
1514;It's a great way for the smaller guy to understand what 'Supers' are all about.
1515;My grandson and I love all the Pixar stories.
1516;I love this movie and recommend it to anyone.
1517;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
1518;Also, it gets better every time I watch it.
1519;It's a perect family film and grownups and children alike will love it.
1520;But, MR. Incredible wants back in the game and wants to be able to fight crime once again.
1521;The movie itself is very funny with some very well made images and characters.
1522;If you want to watch a movie with the whole family, this is in my opinion your best bet.
1523;Everyone will be pleased with this choice as it's exciting, funny, and just really neat.
1524;It is my favorite film and this was the third time I am watching.
1525;A perfect family film with a pinch of super power.
1526;I wish Pixar will do a sequel of this movie.
1527;I watched this movie to finish my summer H. w. i think that this movie is so interesting.
1528;so I want to watch again.
1529;i Oo O jI invited my friend to watch this movie.
1530;I forgot how much I loved this story.
1531;But over all enjoyable for the whole family.
1532;This movie is not only great for the kids, it's a great guys' movie, featuring eternal subplots.
1533;boy, when he was young he had it all: respect, lots of muscles, a cool car, and the freedom to do whatever he wanted.
1534;And then out of the blue comes a beautiful woman who brings the promise of bringing back those lost days.
1535;Now he begins to realize that his family is the most important thing to him.
1536;Can Bob regain his family, and find the freedom and excitement he wants in conjunction with them?
1537;hearted, as many men see themselves.
1538;I loved this movie, and enjoy watching it as much as my kids do!
1539;Best Pixar movie in my opinion.
1540;That's very unusual for any movie on Flixster.
1541;even with that, this movie has excellent plot, creative usage of superhero features and leaves it open for a sequel.
1542;Saw the movie with my son when it first showed and felt the same way when we watched it years later on our flatscreen.
1543;Truly a fun time especially with Edna Mode.
1544;speaking folks in your staff watch the movie before showing it because this time dubbing really killed your excellent movie.
1545;Kids love it I love it :.)
1546;Besides it giving me some piece of mind while they watch this movie I must say I enjoy it as well even though they watched it over 30 times.
1547;For me, the technical finesse of the movie was never in doubt.
1548;what impressed me most is, the creation and characterization of a new superhero family with a touch of realism.
1549;The story writer's imagination is plausible, making the pitch that there are really super families in existence.
1550;With The Incredibles Pixar has created what is arguably one of the greatest family films ever.
1551;It has a broad appeal to every member of the family without being pithy.
1552;the kids fare no better as they try to hide their amazing abilities from their classmates and teachers.
1553;This is one, cool place.
1554;I will trade in my SUV and get a hybrid!
1555;We get our lesson served up with a delicate, yet still profound, touch.
1556;It did a fantastic job at that.
1557;this was the first Pixar picture I watched, and I can see why people rave about their animation.
1558;I thoroughly enjoyed the story.
1559;I will admit that I found it interesting the similarity between the foursome and the Fantastic Four (one stretches, one is super.
1560;strong, and one is invisible with force fields in both quartets).
1561;I can imagine the son of a superman type inheriting super.
1562;But when did facts stand in the way of a good story?The story was very entertaining.
1563;The writing was great to show human people who just happened to have powers.
1564;It made a great jab at bureauracy being no better than criminals.
1565;The characters were great as well.
1566;There is a theme that we are not meant to go about it alone.
1567;In the end, Mr. Incredible learned he was meant to be part of a team, and that team was his family.
1568;We need to realize that this is true of us as well.
1569;i enjoyed the extra features.
1570;Pixar makes the best animated movies ever.
1571;This is one of their best.
1572;I highly recommend this movie to everyone, big and small.
1573;This is a really fun movie to watch with the little ones.
1574;Kept their attention the whole way through, and it was just incredible enough for them and for me!
1575;My kids love this as do I!
1576;Great family movie to watch with some popcorn cuddled up on the couch.
1577;Love this movie did the songs for my high school band four years ago so happy I got this movie
1578;The Incredibles is a terrific and entertaining movie.
1579;"This is my favorite pixar movie
1580;the animation is top notch, and the voice acting is perfect.
1581;brad Bird should be given an award for this movie, it rivals his other great work, The Iron Giant, in greatness.
1582;I hope I hope I hope they make a sequel.
1583;Jus compared toi the other Pixar movies its not as good.
1584;it is a great family movie and the animation is great as Pixar has done so well.
1585;I like this movie because the graphics are great and while the story line is suspenseful its not scary for younger kids to watch.
1586;Ever since their first movie """"Toy Story"""", Pixar has taken America by storm with each new movie they come out with."""
1587;while the movie is not Pixar's best work out of their selection of movies, it certainly does hold a candle among the movies that will be remembered for years to come.
1588;Pixar has proved time and time again they can do great work and this proves it.
1589;The Incredibles is a spectacular masterpiece that could win, straight up, Best Picture of 2004.
1590;Not best *animated* feature, but best picture, period.
1591;"everything Pixar has done so far has been gold, and ""The Incredibles"" just raises the ante further."
1592;"Like its predecessors, ""The Incredibles"" employes Pixar's much."
1593;vaunted CGI in the service of a good artistic vision.
1594;This time, the marriage of the technique and the art is so perfect, so synergistic, that the result is breathtaking.
1595;this movie just nails everything.
1596;"CGI: perfect (check out the hair and fabric)
1597;i could cite hundreds of little things that illustrate the greatness of this film"
1598;And yet, they created a small, almost incidental sequence worthy of Buster Keaton.
1599;masterpiece within the larger masterpiece.
1600;"villian: great
1601;History will be very generous to """"The Incredibles""""."""
1602;"It will be in all the ""Greatest Movie"" lists, up there with the Star Warses and Lawrences of Arabia."
1603;You don't need kids around to greatly enjoy this one!
1604;It made me laugh and it had a message that I can be comfortable with my 7 year old watching.
1605;the animation is, dare I say it, incredible.
1606;The story line is tight and amusing for kids and adults alike.
1607;this is a great value and a great way for families to spend family movie night.
1608;This completely surpassed my expectations.
1609;The emotional aspect that Pixar added to this story made the film.
1610;I think the movie was quite entertaining for young and old alike.
1611;I like the service that Amazon provides.
1612;I will use Amazon more in the future.
1613;As you may have already read in these reviews, almost everyone loves this animation piece.
1614;Then watch the entire movie summed up with a very cheap, but hilarious sock puppet show.
1615;Another great movie for the family.
1616;It is about an animated super hero who has to make changes in his life and the struggle to be a good dad and family man.
1617;Great movie for everyone to watch.
1618;Pixar never ceases to amaze me.
1619;"A lot of movies today are trying to entertain adults as well as children by adding in ""adult"" humor that flys right over the heads of children."
1620;the Incredibles through great plot lines and characters truly makes it a great movie for adults.
1621;the extra disc features are incredible and you will love them.
1622;It is a superhero tale made for kids to love.
1623;My kids all love this movie even the older kids will still watch it with their little brother.
1624;I also happen to find this movie quite entertaining even after having had to watch it approximately one million times :)
1625;Funny characters and playful humor!
1626;Cannot pick a favorite character because they are all funny and charming.
1627;Have shared this movie with family and recommend to all!
1628;I really love this movie.
1629;Now that my kids are getting older, I've introduced them to it and they are riveted.
1630;A good movie for a family movie night.
1631;Comical, but yet had just enough heart and morals to make it a good kid movie.
1632;My children watch it constantly.
1633;My husband and I actually enjoy watching it as well.
1634;My 4 year old (and I) loved the movie.
1635;Lots of funny parts throughout and a part that we had to rewind and watch again (more than once) at the very end.
1636;"Although it won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature (2004), am I the only one who wishes it were in the regular ""Best Picture"" category?I also think this is a better movie for adults than it is for kids."
1637;much better than Finding Nemo or Cars, this is up there with Toy Story 2 as one of Pixar's best.
1638;On of Pixars best,heck,all their movies are superb!!!
1639;I surrendered to it's animated three.
1640;It was engrossing, yea, even awe.
1641;"what is it going to take to entain the ""Y"" generation nowadays."
1642;Reduce the polish and production and do an epic 3 hour ascii movie or something equally canonic.
1643;me, I'm happy as heck about The Incredibles.
1644;It's smart, witty, creative, fun, and even a bit misty.
1645;The writer Brad Bird did an excellent job toying with the superhero and disfunctional family archetypes, and tosses in some terrific social commentary as well.
1646;"Everybody's special, honey ""Which is another way of saying no one is""."
1647;"Elastigirl has one of the best superpower scenes on film (the ""doors"" sequence, you'll know when you see it)."
1648;This truly does transcend age.
1649;few films are able to both satirize yet embody the best conventions of a genre, like this one does with superheroes.
1650;it teases the margins in a creative way (the superhero costume designer), AND it promotes the moral virtues that superhero flicks are supposed to.
1651;A near flawless film that inspires joy, makes you wish you had superpowers.
1652;One of the most poignant moments of the film is when Dash runs across the water, he looks down and starts giggling.
1653;It's just another great film by Pixar.
1654;Looks great and has a great soundtrack.
1655;PG so I'd bring older kids.
1656;I love this movie so mych and its cute.
1657;When he gets a mysterious message from a person that offers him a job that pulls the limits of the governments enforcements.
1658;A complete classic for family time.
1659;we reference this movie all the time and love to watch it with all the kids.
1660;Watched it was my 8 yr old son and we both enjoyed it.
1661;Would recommend as a family movie.
1662;Finding Nemo was about a father and son, Monsters Inc was about two single guys who find a lost child, but this one is about mom and dad and brother and sister who learn to work through there family issues without being too sickening, really, really good.
1663;The Incredibles is a great movie.
1664;"It's fun and funny with ""super."
1665;"heroes"" that are also normal people."
1666;My 4 year old son likes it and so do my wife and myself.
1667;truly a family fun movie.
1668;It is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life.
1669;"I won't spend too much time repeating the praise others here have given the film
1670;style cartoon featuring Mr. Incredible and Frozone (watch it with the commentary!)
1671;Very funny and interesting stuff.
1672;I gave this to a grandson and he really liked it.
1673;This is another great film from Pixar .
1674;thoroughly entertaining for all ages.
1675;I love it mostly because it is about a family trying their best to get a long.
1676;THis one is good though.
1677;Good for my sensitive 6 year old who played Super power games for the next week.
1678;in fact, it shows the film studio is maturing a bit, and branching out.
1679;As stated in several reviews, the animation is terrific .
1680;to really appreciate it, it should be watched on as high a resolution screen as possible.
1681;the better the resolution, the greater the depth.
1682;story telling in this film is very good, again, geared toward an older audience.
1683;i've always been a fan of her books and commentary on NPR, and having her voice Violet was fun.
1684;the special features were adequate for this film .
1685;there was a lot of focus on the making of, but then when you see all the hurdles they jumped through, it gives you a greater appreciation for it.
1686;The entire film is a gigantic exclamation point to those who truly LOVE the entire process of creativity.
1687;It was a good question, and the Director went the extra mile and MADE it happen all in the name of making not just a good movie, but a GREAT movie.
1688;The voices were absolutely PERFECT.
1689;It all came into place on the big screen, and now on my TV as well.
1690;The extra's are great, maybe a little tedius after about 45 minutes, but worthwhile overall.
1691;Oh, and I almost forgot the added extra of 'Jack Jack Attack'.
1692;It was funny and as always, VERY creative and also, it ended all.
1693;Visually just as fun as the storyline, 'The Incredibles' is definitely worth adding to your collection.
1694;Kudos to Director Brad Bird and PIXAR for yet ANOTHER animation triumph!
1695;Here's to continued success in the future.
1696;Many of the themes were adult oriented and would surely fly over the heads of the elementary school crowd.
1697;very clever story and animation, but the younger kids might find it boring.
1698;Funny story line especially enjoyable for a family.
1699;Great one liners for adults not just the funny things for the kids.
1700;I have always been impressed with Steve Jobs and Pixar's work but this is the first time I was just blown away by what I took in with the multi viewing of The Incredibles.
1701;This movie was awe inspiring from begining to end.
1702;From its throw back look and feel to its technologically fantastic special effects.
1703;I was never a big fan of comic book hero's but I would have loved to see The Incredibles in comic book form back in my younger days.
1704;One that didn't die in the begining of the film but really had an impact to the whole story line.
1705;I also enjoyed the fact that it depicted flawed super hero's that were not perfect and made mistakes.
1706;They seemed so real to life and genuine in all the things that happened to them.
1707;I only own one other Pixar movie Finding Nemo but this one hands down is my ultimate favorite yet.
1708;The movie is about an extraordinary family who truly love each other trying to survive in a very ordinary world that beats down on the extraordinary.
1709;The movie has many hilarious scenes, many touching scenes and many real scenes.
1710;My favorite """"real"""" scene is when the Mr. Incredible drives home from work and stops the car."""
1711;The movie brings in the typical super hero stuff, but it has the feel of a Bond film and I think surpasses the genres of both films.
1712;the movie has a lot of extra features.
1713;Sarah is very strange and funny.
1714;There is a sock puppet version of the film.
1715;I don't know if that is an Easter egg or not, but it is funny.
1716;the movie is an excellent movie for the family.
1717;It is exactly what the title says, incredible!
1718;What a great movie for the whole family the kids will love it and so will you!
1719;Even my two daughters, ages 10 and 12 who are not into superhero movies loved The Incredibles.
1720;paced, and great animation make this another great Pixar choice for everyone.
1721;Pixar animation has done it again!
1722;"Following in the footsteps of such classic animated films as ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Toy Story"", this fun."
1723;packed film will be sure to captivate adults and children alike.
1724;Their children Violet, Dash, and baby Jack.
1725;bob takes a job as an insurance adjuster while Helen has set up housekeeping.
1726;helen gets wind of Bob's mysterious journey to the island, and soon she, Violet, and Dash are on the island searching for Bob.
1727;Will Bob, Helen, Dash, and Violet stop him before its too late?This is a spectacular film.
1728;As with the other successful Pixar films in this genre, the animation is excellent, and the story is first rate.
1729;I give this movie my highest recommendation.
1730;It has quickly become our children's favorite film, and we've watched it together several times, and it keeps getting better with each viewing.
1731;Watch this highly entertaining and exciting film from Pixar and enjoy some animated fun and action!
1732;With the superhero craze in full swing, Pixar and Disney (mostly Pixar) are capitalizing on the success with their own version of the Superhero universe.
1733;following the adventures of Mr. Incredible, the movie introduces us to the heroes in their heyday, when the city loved them and counted on them, until an ungrateful `jumper' sues them.
1734;In order to keep this review short, I will say that this movie is more exciting and fun to watch then almost anything else that was released in 2004, with the exception of Spider.
1735;Also, strangely noted, is the James Bond.
1736;The Incredibles is great fun and highly recommended.
1737;a great superhero movie a look into the humanity in superhumans lol i like the sound of that should be on a poster
1738;The Incredibles is a family favorite.
1739;This movie really hits the balance for being fun for all ages.
1740;Fun storyline, fun characters and fun plot.
1741;I bought the four pack because i got for twenty five bucks.
1742;If your children love action hero's they will love the incredables.
1743;Great movie for the whole family!
1744;I give this movie a thumb up!
1745;This movie is one of my family's favorite superhero flicks!
1746;We have really been enjoying it.
1747;It was delivered on time and in good condition.
1748;So, we preordered this with the Disney Store because you get the cool lithographs.
1749;Yes, he is saved by Mr. Incredible.
1750;I personally thought it was a cute movie.
1751;"I love animated films, all kinds, all genres, all styles, meant for any and all ages, with one proviso
1752;I loved this film, No Capes!
1753;One of our family's favorite movies.
1754;Kids love to watch it over again.
1755;This movie has a great plot, great moral value, great color, great dialogue, and great graphics.
1756;As a 33 year old mom, I loved i for both me and my kids.
1757;There's humor that adults will appreciate, but completely appropriate for young audiences.
1758;One of the reasons, besides the story, that I really enjoy this movie is that I love how they designed Elasti.
1759;How cool is it to have a hero that has the same proportions as a real woman (well, to a degree)?
1760;Now along with """"Finding Nemo"""" this is one of the best animated filmed."""
1761;It is smart, funny and delivers a great family values message.
1762;Samuel L. Jackson and all the cast members deliver their voices with enthusiasm and really get into character!This movie is great.
1763;For me this movie is, without ANY doubt, one of the greatest super.
1764;This film displays action sequences that are amazing, creative in execution, and as thrilling as they are beautiful.
1765;This film is a masterpiece.
1766;Toy Story and its sequel are excellent films and I thought that there was no way Pixar could possibly continue creating that level of greatness.
1767;While A Bugs Life wasn't one of my favorites, it's still a fantastic film.
1768;It's simple, heartfelt, and provides a beautiful impression that their world will continue in a positive direction despite the end of the movie (something that kids, the target audience, need to know).
1769;Finding Nemo, like all other Pixar films, has a strong family message and it provides us with some beautiful visuals.
1770;Again, Pixar built upon its own accomplishments and provided us with a film that will be heralded as a classic and loved by future generations.
1771;"As impressed as I am with all of the other Pixar films, and as much as I love them, The ""Incredibles"" is a must have."
1772;It is great, funny, fun and teaches you not to lie to your wife.
1773;The animation is as impressive as I had expected it to be as a Pixar product.
1774;PIXAR has a history of creating great films such as Toy Story, Monsters Inc. and A Bug's Life.
1775;there is some very strong characterization lended by all the voice actors.
1776;even though there is no swearing or any real hardcore violence, it still feels like a movie adults can enjoy.
1777;I think that this is one of the few films that people of all ages can enjoy because there are jokes that are thrown in for all ages.
1778;I am 19 years old and enjoyed it more than many other superhero films.
1779;The second disc also has some great bonus features.
1780;jack attack is actually funnier than the film.
1781;this is one of my favourite family films about a retired super hero who becomes bored with the daily 9.5 and dreams of years past this is great fun for the whole family.
1782;this is a great motion picture about a family of super.
1783;this is a great movie for your whole family or yourself, this is a definite 5 star movie!
1784;Very emotional for a mom and full of energy and laughs for the kids.
1785;My son is so into super heros right now and a movie with a super hero family WHAT???
1786;It's one of the few Disney movies that keeps the family intact and working together.
1787;It is just a fun, feel good family movie.
1788;This blue ray edition is pefect for those who love watching the extras after.
1789;Great interviews and cute extras.
1790;Watching digital animation grow every year is a true delight of mine and with every release Pixar manages to outdo themselves.
1791;It is no longer a replication but a true to life story and it truly shows.
1792;"From the mannerisms to the situations that make you say ""Hey that's my family"" you can see that the filmakers are genuine masters."
1793;the art direction and cinematography are top notch and in my opinion some of the best we saw in 2004.
1794;The sound is just right, and every color jumps off the screen.
1795;This movie is one of the best family movies out there.
1796;My three year old son loves it and so does my 35 year old husband.
1797;Better than Monster Inc. or Finding Nemo.
1798;Ok, this movie is a blast, and maybe I'm biased because the four characters are so much like our family personality.
1799;Edna is hilarious, and Frozone holds his own.
1800;I really like how the movie pokes fun at the comic book genre at the same time that it celebrates it.
1801;I still find myself pulling it out for another good ride of adventure with the Incredibles.
1802;it's definitely a must have .
1803;enjoy the nice reviews as I will sound redundant giving it high fives!
1804;i would definitely see it again and pay to see it.
1805;The difference this time around is that the film concerns people in real.
1806;life, facing the kinds of situations that families do instead of funny toys, talking fish or monsters.
1807;This movie will no doubt leave the children frozen to the tv screen but its not too cartoonish for adults to enjoy as well.
1808;After all, it is Pixar's first PG movie so you could expect it to be a little bit more mature.
1809;Pixar's movies to me posess the magic and entertainment factor that Disney movies used to and where Disney lacks, Pixar knows how to deliver an action.
1810;Fifteen years pass, and The incredible family has grown to 5.
1811;Dash is quicker than lightning, and Violet can disappear and produce force fields.
1812;One day something happens that draws Mr. Incredible back into the biggest mission of his life, as well as the rest of the Incredible family.
1813;As with the other Pixar releases it is packed with extra features.
1814;This includes a blooper reel, several behind.
1815;director of this great movie.
1816;The picture looks great, the audio is available in English, French and Spanish 5.1 EX, and the extras are awesome.
1817;A family movie the kids will love, great animation and story.
1818;the kids will watch a few times, really a cute movie.
1819;Thoroughly enjoy this movie with my grandson!
1820;He laughs out loud at some of the scenes and it a good story to boot!
1821;Disney and Pixar have re.
1822;"created the magic of ""Finding Nemo"" in this delightful family film."
1823;When danger threatens, the family springs into action and saves the day while restoring their faith in each other.
1824;The Incredibles is a heart.
1825;felt tale of family ties and of discovering the glory within those ties.
1826;This short film is a great addition to the over story of The Incredibles.
1827;This is a great animation movie.
1828;I liked it better than Antz and as much as Bugs Life.
1829;The story line is great.
1830;The voices behind the movie was great.
1831;I will watch about once a year.
1832;Great movie to watch with your children and in family, it has great values to take away for yourself and your children.
1833;This one I think might be the most fun though.
1834;The action scenes look fantastic and the comedy is very well done as well.
1835;I love the part when it's explained to Mr. Incredible why super heroes shouldn't wear capes.
1836;in a way though I found it to be like Spy Kids with a family of super heroes instead of a family of spies.
1837;Still though like I said this movie is better than most live.
1838;the Parrs are a family like many of us.
1839;end job, the often thankless work of keeping house, the social awkwardness of adolescence, and the sense of stiffled potential.
1840;this is where the real heart of the story lies.
1841;but in the Parr's family dynamic itself.
1842;Naturally, a movie like this asks us all to suspend disbelief.
1843;That said, I also believe that Brad Bird's approach to the family situations hit the nail on the head with a very believable hammer.
1844;They are as real a family as anything I have ever seen on television or film before.
1845;She's the glue that keeps them all from falling apart.
1846;He's yet another well fleshed out character.
1847;samuel Jackson's Frozone is a fun character that I wish had more screentime, yet his contribution to the story is great as middle.
1848;In many ways, better than many real life actors.
1849;I see Holly Hunter in Helen Parr more than any other voice performance, but I do see some elements of Craig T Nelson in Bob Parr as well.
1850;brad Bird, responsible for one of the most underrated and excellent animated films in history (The Iron Giant), really hits it out of the park.
1851;This still remains my favorite Pixar offering.
1852;and one of my favorite movies of all time.
1853;Interesting tale on what happens to a retired superhero, and how our words/actions can sometimes have unintended consequences.
1854;I absolutly love this movie.
1855;It's rare that a children's movie interests me, but somehow this one stuck out in my mind.
1856;Very cool and fun for the whole family.
1857;Not only is the original movie as good as it was in the theaters, the additional items are as good as or better!
1858;It's for all ages, especially loved by my 3.4 year.
1859;This movie is very well done.
1860;Very imaginative, characters, plot, all well done.
1861;Disney, every now and then puts out really good movies and this is one of them.
1862;I've always loved Pixar's movies.
1863;"Like in a previous review i read, it is nice to get away from the toys and animals for once and deal with ""real"" people."
1864;The Incredibles is definately Pixar's movie by far.
1865;"It beats its ""predecessors"" so."
1866;I love the plot, too.
1867;I've heard reviews that thought this was just ok, but I thought it was outstanding!
1868;I love Pixar movies, and this one is my favorite.
1869;There are some VERY funny parts in this movie, and it is entertaining to the end (which is good because this is the longest Pixar movie yet).
1870;This is extremely enjoyable family fun.
1871;I have watched the short film probably 10 times, and I still think it's hilarious!!
1872;it is really funny and I can really identify with the mother.
1873;but I did enjoy watching it with my daughter.
1874;"Simply put, ""The Incredibles"" is more engaging and entertaining than many of the live action superhero films of the last few years."
1875;The animation is top notch, as we've come to expect from Pixar.
1876;"The writing is clever, with some gentle jabs at political correctness, ""mid."
1877;"life crises"", and our society's lawsuit."
1878;"The characters are as well developed as those in the best live action ""action films"", and the supporting characters (especially Edna Mode) are as engaging and memorable as the leads."
1879;The film contains affectionate nods to everything from superhero and spy films to the Rankin.
1880;confidence are delivered with humor instead of sappy sentimentality.
1881;Bounding is a clever story by Bud Luckey, who's evidently an underrated writer and animator.
1882;This is an extras disc that's actually as worthwhile as the feature film, and it completes a package that's one of the best entertainment values to come along in quite a while.
1883;"Just the old hero in a suit ""NOT"" this was a great story, Funny, Suspenseful,Thrilling, Exciting, Did I say Funny?"
1884;This has been among my favorite movies since it came out.
1885;I my opinion, this movie marked a turning point in family entertainment and will remain a classic for a very long time.
1886;A film by Brad BirdPixar's sixth animated feature is something of a departure for the company.
1887;It also is the first time a Pixar film is completely about human characters.
1888;This time around, the humans are everywhere, so this was a new test of Pixar's talent.
1889;"Time will tell, but ""The Incredibles"" may just be Pixar's best movie."
1890;They fight because they have superpowers and this is their job.
1891;Mr. Incredible (Craig T Nelson) is the best, and most famous, of all the superheroes.
1892;Bob Parr works in insurance while Helen is a stay at home mother.
1893;"this is a Pixar movie, so all of this is animated and since it is a Pixar movie, ""The Icredibles"" pushes the boundaries of what was thought possible in animation."
1894;Simply put: this is a beautiful movie.
1895;There is an exaggerated level of realism, but everything flows and moves perfectly.
1896;"This is, in part, a children's movie so ""The Incredibles"" is a lot of fun to watch."
1897;There is fast paced action which will thrill the kids.
1898;The movie is funny and flashy and bright.
1899;At times it looks just like a Saturday morning cartoon, but if so, it is the best Saturday morning cartoon you are likely to ever see.
1900;There is so much for adults in this movie to enjoy.
1901;From the clever dialogue and discussion of superheroes and super.
1902;"villains to jokes that will go over the head of children, ""The Incredibles"" has something for everyone."
1903;There is action, comedy, adventure, fun, thrills, suspense, and danger.
1904;This is easily one of the best movies of the year.
1905;It just keeps getting better.
1906;pixar continues to set new standards in animation.
1907;Not only do they do a superlative job with their craft, they do a superlative job at entertaining as well.
1908;It's enough to make a superhero weep.
1909;It does not help that he is married to Elastigirl and has kids with super powers.
1910;It does so with delicious fun.
1911;There is plenty here to keep kids amused but there is also plenty that will go right over their heads and amuse the older folks.
1912;loads of fun for young and old, this one will appeal to anyone who is young at heart.
1913;Before that Mr. Incredible and his girlfriend Elastigirl had a great old time fighting crime and evildoers.
1914;He lives with his wife Elastigirl and three kids who also have superpowers that they have to keep hidden.
1915;bob is a very real and believable.
1916;He's a superhero with a lot of human flaws.
1917;the office cubicle scenes are very well.
1918;The scene where the diminutive fashion designer makes him a new costume is funny and clever.
1919;He is lured back into service as a superguy fighting for humanity to stop a menacing force that is out for world destruction.
1920;it congeals into a James Bondish film (remember this is all animated cartoon stuff), an action flick where good guys are fighting the superbad guys on an island.
1921;The Incredibles is truly incredible, and yet, I would caution those who are thinking of bringing their young kids to see it.
1922;The plot is also surprisingly quite mature, since it deals honestly with marital problems while still adhering closely to comic book sensibilities.
1923;Some of the writing is hilarious, especially when Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) and Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) are squabbling about their marriage while trying to stop a madman from launching a rocket containing his latest, deadliest robot.
1924;the story may seem a bit cliched, but it works well thanks not only to excellent writing, but also the acting done by the cast, lead by Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter, with excellent work too from Jason Lee (Syndrome) and Samuel L. Jackson.
1925;without question, this is among the finest animated feature films I have seen in recent memory.
1926;"Pixar has created a near classic, thanks not only to its superb animation, but also the splendid writing, acting and excellent direction from Brad Bird, perhaps best known for his earlier animated film, ""The Iron Giant""."
1927;It is still a film I would recommend to the entire family, but you should be aware of the extensive violence depicted and prepare your young kids accordingly.
1928;This is a fantastic movie!!!
1929;Alright, I saw the previews for this movie and I thought, yeah right, but I did end up seeing it in theaters.
1930;pixar Animation Studios does yet another great job with a brilliantly done animation, but also storyline.
1931;I is highly original, which is one thing that should be valued, especially in cartoon/animation pictures.
1932;i would strongly recommend this piece.
1933;Fun family movie with lots of action.
1934;Each of the characters have their own distinct personalities and abilities, and in the end, they have to work together as a team to survive.

1996;The entire family was able to sit down and we all enjoyed watching it to include the 2 year old who actually sat still long enough to see the movie!TWO THUMBS UP!
1997;this latest animated movie is really one that can't be beat.
1998;graphical detail on characters has been improved from previous movies and some awesome special effects have been added aswell.
1999;The movie takes on the whole super hero genre and raises it to a whole new level, based around a special family whom have special powers all unique as their own, but live in a world where supers walk the streets un noticed and team up to stop evil, the story line isn't exactly that simple but im not gonna give too much away.

2001;Exactly the gift requested by the grandkids.
2002;they loved it and will give more hours of entertainment.

2004;Great way to keep our son entertained off he's iPad .
2005;Very convenient thanks a great deal of much Amazon!
2006;I'm amazed at how well computermation makes animation look.
2007;Fur looks real, water scenes look real, and there's more of a 3.
2008;I'm sure he loves this.
2009;I don't have much to add to all these other rave reviews, so I'll only say this: """"The Incredibles"""" is a terrific movie that wonderfully pays tribute to the great Marvel comics of the 1960's (especially """"Fantastic Four"""") and those early James Bond movies that featured flamboyant villains operating out of lavishly."""
2010;she is quiet we are happy when she is with us!
2011;It's a great movie, it is very good animation and even better scripting.
2012;The Increibles is well worth the money!
2013;A friend and I had to take his little brother and friend to this movie because they wanted to see it.
2014;I was planning to sleep through the whole thing, but right away it caught my attention and my eyes were glued to the screen for the rest of the time.
2015;I would have to say that this is the best movie that I have seen for quite some time, regardless of its intended audiences.
2016;The animation was probably the best I have ever seen, and the plot was very complex, which I love.
2017;Other than that, it's worth every penny, and more.
2018;There is absolutely NO ONE that would find this movie not entertaining.
2019;Far and away my favorite Pixar movie!
2020;The Incredibles is bursting at the seems with personality and the emotion of the creators.
2021;I still think of the scene where Dash starts running from Syndrome's henchmen and get a huge smile on my face.
2022;This movie really is incredible!
2023;Super heroes are real and possess great powers.
2024;Two such heroes are Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl who have gotten married and had kids.
2025;but then Mr. Incredible is contacted to help stop a powerful robot.
2026;The action gives Mr. Incredible a new lease on his self worth and things begin to look up for him.
2027;the story and action are excellent.
2028;Combined with a powerful music score, the film often feels like the best of the James Bond films.
2029;A great cross between the superhero story and the secret agent story this story really moves and has real character development.
2030;The scenes of superheroes trying to be mundane are excellent.
2031;A wonderful cast of voices completes the mix and creates a movie that is fun for most ages.
2032;i watched the short Jack Jack Attack before the main film and I think it works well that way.
2033;Also included is a wonderful little film called Bounding that can be watches over and over again.
2034;From the eerily similar to James Bond score to the voice casting (Samuel L. Jackson!)
2035;to the most excellent dialogue, this a movie to own and watch over and over.

2040;This is the best Family movie out this year!
2041;My three year old is going through a superhero obsession.
2042;He loves all things powerful.
2043;I frankly found it dull and lifeless but my children think it is perfect!
2044;packed as any Bond flick, but had more humor and better characters (apart from Bond himself).
2045;The Incredibles is one of the best superhero movies ever made.
2046;"Watching the surprisingly realistic computer animation, it raises the question, ""Why don't we make ALL our superhero movies this way?"""
2047;"Let's face it, the special effects in ""live."
2048;Will Iceman (of the X. men) ever be able to do something similar in a live.
2049;The whole look of the film is terrific .
2050;capturing the feel, the architecture, and the look of golden.
2051;generated humans to be a bit creepy, but this film is successful because it eschews realism in favor or caricature for its characters.
2052;the story is as funny as any animated feature I've seen: superheroes are forced to retire and adjust to civilian life.
2053;"The funniest character turns out to be a fashion designer who answers the question, ""Where do superheroes get their costumes from?"
2054;The film is much more grown.
2055;The Incredibles, not to be clich , is incredible.
2056;Pixar brings action adventure all into a two hour cartoon.
2057;Highly recommended for all ages.
2058;Technically speaking this is one of the finest of the modern crop of animated films and one of the best of the superhero genre, live actors or not.
2059;In the world as created by Pixar we are treated to amazing levels of visual detail, fluid motion, expert pacing and excellent scripting.
2060;This is a film that will entertain everyone in the family, as long as they are at least five years old.
2061;The voice work is absolutely exemplary, the dynamic soundtrack will test your home theater audio system and the secondary audio tracks are an excellent source of information and entertainment.
2062;The second disc has some nice additions, such as outtakes and a short feature, but it is the wonderfully imagined visual biographies of the heroes of the Incredible world combined with some very funny audio interviews with the featured heroes that stands out.
2063;I most heartily recommend this film to even the most straight laced, purist cinema fans
2064;The movie itself is great.
2065;Great audio and visually outstanding.
2066;I love this movie and i will recommend it to anyone.
2067;Very good for the kids and for the older people.
2068;I thought it was a bit much for my 3 year old.
2069;this one is almost perfect!
2070;The middle child, Dash, is the exact opposite of his sister, as he is a hyperactive kid who definitely lives up to his name with his ability of super.
2071;jack, the baby, his power is to drool on everything and look cute.
2072;Now, Bob finds himself in a fight for not only his life, but also that of his family and friends in the hidden superhero community.
2073;"just when I thought that Pixar couldn't possibly do any better than their classics, ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Toy Story"", those creative gurus go and deliver what is quite possibly their best film to date."
2074;Now, I'll admit I may be a bit more biased towards this movie since it is a superhero themed movie, a subject matter that I enjoy due to my interest in comic books and their movie adaptations, but aside from that I believe that this is a truly well put together piece of cinema that the entire family can sit back and enjoy on multiple levels.
2075;That's the glorious thing about Pixar films, is that they actually strive to contain a little something for everyone to enjoy.
2076;"the story for ""The Incredibles"" is a perfect superhero tale that is so well."
2077;developed that it can easily go toe.
2078;toe with it's live action counterparts, even besting some of them.
2079;Even though it was an animated movie full of comedy and adventure, the story is actually one that would probably be fairly true to life if this was to all take place in the real world.
2080;Which shows the depth that the creative teams at Pixar are willing to take their movies to in order to achieve the most entertaining experience possible for audiences.
2081;another outstanding feature for most Pixar movies is their terrific vocal performances from all of their actors.
2082;A key component to making any successful animated movie is to have the best actors possible to bring these 2.
2083;It's something that Disney has always strived for, and it's nice to see that Pixar is carrying on the tradition in order to continue making excellent family.
2084;The voice actors gathered together for this film all turn in fun, engaging performances bringing each of their characters to life, in such a realistic way that balances perfectly with the beautifully rendered computer generated imagery.
2085;As always the folks at Pixar deliver another awesome looking 3.
2086;d animated film that features CGI that rivals even the biggest live action blockbuster film.
2087;"all of these factors combined together are the prime examples for why Pixar remains the best of the best in animated films of any kind, and their hit film ""The Incredibles"" is no exception."
2088;This was an incredible movie with alot of action and humor.
2089;I am 17 and i work at the movies so i get to see every movie for free and i been working at the movies since july and its worth it.
2090;Holly Hunter is also hot.
2091;This movie managed to include a very strong and intelligent female character without portraying the men as weak or stupid.2.
2092;as you might have guessed from these comments, my opinion is that what really made the movie great is that it was just an outstanding and well.
2093;Despite the fanciful setting (an animated movie about superheroes and villians), this comes across as one of the believable movies I've seen in a long time.
2094;Good story, better than the fantastic four, and wonderful animation.
2095;This is a great family film suitable for all ages.
2096;all Pixar films are 100% good clean fun, so if you have little Jack Jack's or Boo's running around the shop, or if you enjoy a good fun movie get this.
2097;As a huge fan of Pixar films, I went in to this movie with very high hopes and I was not disappointed!
2098;It seems like they continue to set the bar higher and higher with each film.
2099;His wife, formerly known as Elastigirl, is a super mom of their three children .
2100;Violet (who has an invisibility power and the ability to make forcefields), Dash (has super speed), and a toddler named Jack Jack (seems to have no powers).
2101;bob and his best friend, former superhero named Frozone, both miss the old days and when their wives think they are bowling, they're really listening to police scanners and helping keep the city safe.
2102;typical of Pixar, the graphics in The Incredibles are amazing.
2103;Some of the landscapes looked so realistic it was hard to believe they were all created on a computer!
2104;The dialogue was funny and witty as well, able to entertain children and adults alike.
2105;It's not often you see an animated movie that both kids and adults can enjoy, but Pixar seems to hit the mark with all of their films!
2106;It's a definite must see!
2107;This is a movie worthy of purchasing!
2108;It's great for the whole family.
2109;We may love it more than the kids!
2110;Wonderful movie and will keep you and the kids stuck to your seats.
2111;Great acting, action and fun for all.
2112;great movie adults and kids love it,cant wait for #2 i hope they dont wreck it.
2113;The Incredibles is a fun story about a family of super heroes and how they try to integrate back into society once super heroes are outlawed due to lawsuits.
2114;Great characters, a great villian, a great family movie!
2115;I love to find good deals on Collector's Edition Pixar movies.
2116;This movie is clever and a Pixar must have.
2117;The actors who play these characters were chosen perfectly.
2118;Got this as a Valentine's Day gift for my 7.
2119;old son, and he loves it.
2120;It's also fun for adults.
2121;there is everything, it has some pretty funny moments, the villain has a great backstory, the draa is there, the characters are likeable and the story is original, americans acting all american on the superheros, brilliant.
2122;We got this as a previously owned movie through Amazon, and it is actually in good condition.
2123;My daughter loves it and my young son will watch it too.
2124;It's a crowd pleaser and funny enough that I can watch it too.
2125;This movie is cute and I use it as reinforcement for the students in my classroom.
2126;When the children earn a movie this is always the movie they pick.
2127;The characters are well written, extremely funny, acting superb, attention to detail.
2128;everything goes above and beyond the story.
2129;The case was damaged but the movie played well.
2130;My son is 5 and he loves this movie.
2131;he watch it a couple of times a week.
2132;my whole family enjoyed it.
2133;All of my kids like this movie.
2134;My 11 year old twins really love it.
2135;It's a good addition to any Disney collection:)
2136;it was funny, and not just the kids thought so, my husband and I laughed too!
2137;the PG rating was well deserved.
2138;The very end was a little weird (I won't spoil it for ya), but I still felt comfortable letting my children watch it.
2139;I have a four year old son, and anyone else with a toddler knows how that goes.
2140;Entertaining movie for all ages.
2141;Heck I enjoy this movie as much as my grand kids and I'm 55!
2142;This movie is a classic.
2143;The idea of having a family where all the members have superpowers is great!
2144;It works ok since all the rest is so good.
2145;The movie focuses a lot on the importance of families working together and sticking together.
2146;It also has a fantastic message in the middle of it.
2147;That is one of the best messages I've seen in a movie in a long time.
2148;for a cartoon, this movie is funny.
2149;it showed up to my house fairly quickly, and the kids just love watching it.
2150;Well well well, what can I say, another successful Pixar animation movies.
2151;My whole family simply loves it, my son included of course.
2152;My son has been a BIG fan of Toy Story 1 and 2, so much so that he can view both movies over and over again.
2153;And he enjoyed Pixar's other animation movies too like Finding Nemo and A Bug's Life.
2154;This is what I call a successful movie.
2155;I was surprised at how many people saw movie TWICE within first week.
2156;That is a rare tribute to any movie.
2157;i loved the story about normalizing heroes.
2158;This has been done successfully with the first two Batman movies, Daredevil, and most supernally in the Spider.
2159;"It is a bit like Kierkegaard's comments in ""Either/Or"" about people in Shakespeare and the Old Testament actually having emotions."
2160;The Incredibles carries on this tradition, and the final battle involves the whole family working as a team to defeat the enemy.
2161;In some places it was rather tight, as with Mr. Incredible interacts with and eventually creates Syndrome.
2162;For example, Edna Mode (the funniest character in the Pixar catalogue) making all the suits, the interactions with Syndrome, Mr. Incredible, and Sarah Vowell.
2163;the hardest scene involved involving the children.
2164;This is seductive for writers, since it is easier to write, as in Kim Possible and Son Stoppable.
2165;As a superheroine, she is all guts and glory.
2166;Pay attention to the opening interviews, and then the suburban lifestyle they lives.
2167;As a cubical monkey, he does small good things, and his moonlighting as a hero is almost like a college prank.
2168;"As ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" shows, the invisible character can be the most colorful."
2169;She can't be naturally black.
2170;This would be nice foreshadowing, and also establish Mr. Incredible as a tough brick.
2171;the only reason why I am so critical of the Incredible is that I think it is a platonically beautiful idea.
2172;"I love the idea
2173;The franchise is alive, and I hope The Incredibles 2 succeeds.
2174;A very enjoyable movie that underscores the importance of family life and connectedness.
2175;We have watched it multiple times and it continues to be entertaining and poignant.
2176;Our son loves this movie, great for the family.
2177;The Incredibles is one of the best animated movies in a very long time.
2178;It was very interesting to watch, and kept me entertained the whole way through.
2179;I have never been a big fan of superhero movies (Batman, Superman, Spiderman) but found this movie very enjoyable.
2180;It had a very creative storyline, and I really did not expect as much as I got out of this film.
2181;the characters in this movie are played off very well.
2182;The main character, Mr. Incredible, voiced by Craig T. Nelson of Coach, is very good.
2183;His superhuman strength makes him the perfect superhero, and he is very fun to watch.
2184;This tandem makes for a very effective defense of the city, and they enjoy saving it every day.
2185;That is where the real fun comes in.
2186;the Incredibles was very well put together.
2187;The combination of Pixar's amazing ability to create unbelievable movies, and Disney's creativity makes for a fantastic film.
2188;The entire Incredible family makes a great team, with all their super abilities, and it makes for one of the best movies out there in a long time.
2189;As you know, this movie has a lot of action which brings people a lot of excitement there.
2190;Funny and excitement are all in it.
2191;Overall, this is just perfect.
2192;that's me, dragging my feet initially when my wife suggested seeing this movie, and I had something else in mind.
2193;Finally I decided to be a good sport and you know something, sometimes karma wins.
2194;For THE INCREDIBLES turned out to be one of the best movies of the year, and I wasn't alone in laughing, hollering, screaming, and hooting at the """"incredible"""" action on the screen."""
2195;sighs Edna Mode, the tiny, huge.
2196;"All of Pixar's films have been very good in my opinion, but each one seemed to either lean a little to the youngsters(Finding Nemo, Toy Story) or to the older folks(Monsters, Inc.) ""The Incredibles"" manages to dance the line between all demographics and comes across as the perfect mixture of young and old wrapped into one."
2197;It has slapstick, silly humor for the very young, it has adventure and suspense that will knock the socks off of older children and young teens, and it has a brilliant storyline that pulls in the older audience.
2198;we've all wanted to be great at sometime in our lives.
2199;Mr. Incredible and his wife, Elastigirl, are given that chance.
2200;But thanks to a few snakey lawyers and their lawsuits, our heroes are driven into a sort of witness protection program for superheroes.
2201;Unable to deny his need to protect the innocent, Mr. Incredible, along with fellow ex.
2202;superhero, Frozone, secretly helps out those who are in need of a hero.
2203;What follows is a family adventure that encompasses all age groups.
2204;"What amazes me is that she loves to watch the ogres in the ""Lord of the Rings"" films and they don't phase her one bit."
2205;All I can come up with is that she is scared because other children are in harm's way.
2206;Everything is fairly safe, but it holds your attention the entire time.
2207;craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee master the attitude, style, and charisma of their respective characters.
2208;It's amazing how Pixar can manage to take actors and actresses whose stars aren't quite as bright as many others and crank out a great movie.
2209;paced and fun to watch.
2210;"The whole film has that ""comic."
2211;There is suspense, drama, and some sweet moments as well.
2212;This animated feature is for adults.
2213;I laugh at something everytime I watch it and I'm old enough to have grandkids.
2214;e,Nemo, etc.) This is still smart, inventive and tremendous fun, withsome humanity thrown in to boot.
2215;for my money, more entertaining than any of the James Bond or superherofilms of recent vintage which it spoofs (and with more exciting actionbesides!)
2216;all done with terrific animation, clever wordplay, great voice acting,and a nice comment or two about the traps of trying to be 'normal'.
2217;"Itgets all the balances right
2218;ray looks amazing, the extras are fun, and you don'thave to be a kid to love it (my wife and I watched with adultfriends .
2219;we all had a great time).
2220;It was a good value for a great movie.
2221;I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE MOVIE!
2222;Director/writer Brad Bird has truly brought the world a great comedy that resonates with both action and fun.
2223;The art direction is beautidul, the first time Pixar has animated human lead characters, and the voice acting is spot on.
2224;Bird delivers on all levels giving a thrilling plot with plenty of deep and tongue.
2225;Anyone will enjoy this movie, whether you are a weathered comic.
2226;This picture deserves the best original screenplay oscar, hands down.
2227;Successful animated films such as Bug's Life, Finding Nemo, and Toy Story are a number of films that Pixar Studios has made during the last decade.
2228;This time Pixar releases another hit, Incredibles, which brings an important social issue to the silver screen for the whole family to enjoy in witty, fast.
2229;mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) has superhuman strength that he uses to save people and prevent crimes.
2230;out of the blue a woman approaches Bob and informs him that his special talent is needed.
2231;the filmmakers at Pixar bring the audience a terrific cinematic experience through superheroes that are forced into hiding.
2232;These issues are brought to the audience through drama, humor, and suspense, which are depicted through some remarkable computer animation.
2233;The film gives the audience an opportunity to burst out laughing and bite their nails in suspense while leaving the audience with an entertaining experience that will leave some pondering about the issues presented in the film.
2234;My 8 yr old loves it!
2235;My daughter loves this movie.
2236;We had to get it for her and she loved every minute of it.
2237;Not all Disney films can be of the caliber of The Lion King.
2238;I know Lilo and Stitch was a lower budget film, but Lilo is far superior to this one.
2239;So is Mulan, another """"filler"""" film."""
2240;We bought it, and we've watched it once.
2241;Plain silly escapist fun for adults, especially those comic book fans, yet still can hold the attention of the children too.
2242;Plus little kids love it.
2243;This is one of my favorite animated movies of all time .
2244;it's up there with Monsters Inc., A Bug's Life, Ants, and a few others.
2245;I highly recommend it for both adults and kids.
2246;Great for the kids to bed at the time, I was a little of it is one that has the right thing, one on my way home, I was a little while ago and have the ability out
2247;if there's anything we've learned from the folks at Pixar, it's that they know how to make films interesting for adults.
2248;life crisis, the mom wonders about her wayward husband, and the kids pick up on the changes.
2249;"inspired soundtrack is fantastic
2250;Not something I could watch over and over, but it was a very good movie.
2251;Got this for the kids on the Kindle, and they love having it in their library!
2252;Clean language, good message, and constant action make a great combo for the whole family.
2253;Most of the time when I go see a Pixar film I laugh out loud and I laugh out loud hard.
2254;It wasn't REALL BAd but I was somewhat surprised on the amount of it.
2255;She is a wonderful actress but she just wasn't believable as Elastigirl.
2256;I thought he did a pretty damn good job.
2257;Jason Lee, who plays Syndrome, is wonderful.
2258;Then again I would never ever say anything bad about Jason Lee because I think he is one of the best actors that exist in todays pop culture age.
2259;He is a breath of fresh air and bring real life into the movie.
2260;Spencer Foxx who plays Dash also does an excellent job in catching his character.
2261;The animation was wonderful of course though, with Pixar leading the way.
2262;Machine washable, darling, that's a new feature.
2263;She looks like a cross between John Lennon and Edith Head with Buddy Holly glasses, and Brad Bird is a brilliant voice talent.
2264;this is a great social satire.
2265;Ironically the Disney Channel is making great strides.
2266;there's also a heartwarming family togetherness here, making The Incredibles truly incredible.
2267;And did I mention I love Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone?
2268;My son has always loved this movie.
2269;If you are a thoughtful person, this movie will leave you asking these questions.
2270;It will also leave you laughing, the dialogue is hilarious, the characters realistic and believable.
2271;This is a brilliant example of perfect movie.
2272;This was a fantastic film, where is the sequel and how much longer will I have to wait for it to be made
2273;This movie has quickly become a classic in our home.
2274;Aside from amazing animation and a compelling story, this movie promotes good values like family unity, believing in yourself, and always being willing to help those in need.
2275;It's very fun and worth watching .
2276;This one is another good laugh for the whole family.
2277;I enjoyed this movie because of it's unique take on super heroes as they grow old and mature.
2278;Very funny and very clever.
2279;It's a great family movie, exciting enough for the older kids and not too intense for little ones.
2280;Like most Pixar movies there are some jokes that are for the adults and some for kids and most are for both.
2281;It had a great message about being yourself and also about being content with your everyday life.
2282;I love this movie very kid friendly and has a great story line.
2283;I give this movie four stars My three year old son enjoyed it.
2284;My little brother and sister, as well as I loved it!!!!!!!
2285;I bought the VHS movie of The Incredibles and received it in reasonable time and in good condition.
2286;Not many movies have impressed me over the last few years.
2287;overall, it's a great movie.
2288;Plot wise 'The Incredibles' is Pixar's weakest showing so far.
2289;About half way through the film, actually.
2290;Even with all this, 'The Incredibles' features some killer redeeming features in the form of it's characters.
2291;the characters and character interactions are the strongest Pixar has come up with in any film they've done so far.
2292;Superheroes in the real world is not a new idea but it's masterfully well executed in this movie.
2293;visually, the movie is stunning, obviously it's the best Pixar's come up with so far.
2294;The characters in the movie look like living, breathing cartoons (with spectacular looking hair and in very real looking fabrics).
2295;The movie's worth seeing if only for this.
2296;There are LOTS of fighting scenes and guns in this movie.
2297;We thought it would be a good movie for my son since he liked other Pixar movies, but this one made my jaw hit the floor within the first 20 minutes.
2298;Some of the best comic book stories of recent years, such as Frank Miller's """"The Dark Knight Returns"""" and Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' """"Watchmen,"""" have explored the idea of what happens when society decides to get rid of its superheroes."""
2299;familial relationships with Alfred and the latest Robin, the Incredibles are a two.
2300;"on ""Bowling night"" Bob and his best friend Lucius Best a. k. a. Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) sit around and talk about the good old days, and sometimes engage in a little undercover superhero work."
2301;"As Mr. Incredible points out at the start of the film, ""No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again."
2302;"The superpowers of the characters in The Incredibles"" are pretty basic."
2303;"director Brad Bird has parlayed his traditional animation efforts ""Family Dog"" and ""The Iron Giant"" into this computer animated Pixar film."
2304;Bird keeps the rules simple, you accept the premise, and go along for the ride.
2305;the key thing about this ride is that it is both fast paced and creative.
2306;and the jump cut on the car toss scene at the end was very cool as well.
2307;The Incredibles is, of course, a comedy, but it takes itself seriously, which is why it ended up being rated PG and why this one is a keeper for comic book fans of all ages.
2308;I really liked this movie, so I was happy to get it on Blu.
2309;I like that it comes with Blu.
2310;aside from the fact that this is a great movie regardless of your age!
2311;Anybody who enjoys Pixar movies will enjoy this one.
2312;action, suspense, comedy and a good story.
2313;I love the whole retro look of everything in the movie, it's great.

2319;And even better, my wife and I loved it as well.
2320;I love this movie and so do my boys!!
2321;It's good for the whole family.
2322;That's just about the only incredible to this movie.
2323;I give credits to those CGI specialists who spent tremendous amount of time creating such elastic characters and by no means it was an easy feat.
2324;I guess it would be a fun movie for kids.
2325;alone, with grandkids and friends.
2326;Each time, I see or hear something else that makes me laugh or smile.
2327;This is one of the best movies out there for kids and Grandkids alike.
2328;We have all enjoy it!
2329;This movie is great for family night.
2330;It shows life before a family and as a super family!

2341;I viewed this movie twice .
2342;It played perfectly in both locations!l
2343;"This was an ""incredible"" movie!"
2344;My 5 year old son of course missed a lot of the intricate humor, but was enthralled with the overall story and the really wonderful effects.
2345;I found myself laughing out loud at the hilarity and being blown away by the time it must have taken for them to not just put together the great visual effects, but also the clever script!
2346;They actually take you in great detail through all the steps of the production.
2347;There are hours worth of such features, and it's all very interesting!
2348;I live in the UK but bought this edition from the US as it offers a region free four disc alternative to the single disc Disney offer in England.
2349;The Incredibles is fresh, funny, and touching.
2350;The film is so great in all ways that I wish I could give it ten stars.
2351;happy society got out of control, and the government could not afford to settle all the lawsuits against superheroes.

2353;They have three children: Dash, Violet, and Baby Jack.
2354;Mom stays at home, while Dad has become an overweight, depressed insurance adjustor.
2355;The themes in this movie are very valid and very touching.
2356;"Jack questions the importance of going to his son's ""graduation"" from fourth grade."
2357;Jack meets secretly with another superhero, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) to listen to the police scanner and to sneak in and help .
2358;A mysterious woman offers Mr. Incredible a secret mission.
2359;Seeking meaning in his life, Mr. I. seizes the opportunity, while keeping it from his wife.
2360;She has the funniest lines in the movie.
2361;My 2 year old is thoroughly entertained by this movie.
2362;It has a cute plot.
2363;My ever growing collection of Disney movies.
2364;I watched it as soon as I opened the package and laughed my butt off!
2365;It's also got some very tender moments where Bob comes to realize the importance of family and working together.
2366;"I loved this move and I will continue to say ""KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!"""
2367;Also lots of fun for the adults .
2368;enough humor and action for everyone!
2369;and we will continue to watch this one repeatedly.
2370;This movie had one of my friends and I buckled over in laughter for the entire movie.
2371;I loved the plot and the realism of the animation.
2372;It's amazing what can be done with computers.
2373;everyone else has already said it all,so all I can do is highly recommend this film.
2374;i was more than delighted with this movie.
2375;It is a movie that all ages will find incredibly entertaining!
2376;It has a terrific story filled with comedy and thrills to keep everyone happy and engaged.
2377;The animated characters are unique, smart and fun to watch.

2379;the movie starts with the marriage of the Parr's.
2380;Because of rescue gone wrong and lawsuits, the government orders the Parr's to establish new identities and live a normal life as an average family in the suburbs.
2381;Each have their own unique incredible super powers.
2382;"Bob Parr, who was ""Mr. Incredible"" misses his former super hero life and works at night with a former super hero friend, Lucias Best ."
2383;The costume designer, Edna, is a hoot.
2384;developed wacky characters that you immediately smile at.
2385;Bob goes to the Island and is able to stop the first Onmidroid 9000.
2386;She sees a suit repair and knows that he has visited Edna, a top notch designer.
2387;When talking to Edna she finds that Edna not only created Bob's new suit, she has created a new suit for each member of the Parr family.
2388;Mirage turns on her boss, Syndrome, and helps the Parrs to escape and catch up with the Omnidroid heading for Metroville.
2389;It is damaging the city with its ability to learn and fight opponents.
2390;when they return home, Syndrome has discovered the Parr's identity.
2391;Does this mean a sequel?Anyway, an excellent movie in all categories.
2392;This was a great movie.
2393;I have watched this on my own as well because I liked it so much!
2394;The movie was great all on its own, but Incredibles on Blu.
2395;I'd give this movie 3.5 stars, but since I can't, it gets 3.
2396;This is way to much a comic book rip.
2397;girl stretching to make a parachute is funny?
2398;What good is a movie about super.
2399;We had it and lost some years ago, I finally bought it again for my children and my son was so happy!
2400;He loves to watch it, thank you for a wonderful product in Incredible condition!
2401;Family fun, action packed, and full on togetherness for the whole family!
2402;"This is definitely the best looking so far of the Disney/Pixar collaborations, which include ""Toy Story,"" ""Monster's Inc,"" and ""Finding Nemo"" among others."
2403;work superhero trying to raise a family, keep a job, and be a normal part of society.
2404;But his superpowers beckon him to return to the superhero world once more, and this time, he's got the whole family with him.
2405;"The humor has lessened since 2003's ""Finding Nemo"" and in place of it is awesome action that is superbly animated."
2406;"If you like superheroes or cartoons in general, ""The Incredibles"" is definitely a wise choice."
2407;I was absolutely delighted when I saw this at the theatres.
2408;I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but the humor, the plot, the animation, everything was dead.
2409;And, while you're at it, I hope you don't allow them on the playground during recess, because it can get pretty rough out there too.
2410;Action and its fun for the whole family to watch.
2411;They're so great and fun to watch.
2412;The idea of superheroes fighting evil in an animated movies is great.
2413;The sounds, voices, everything about this movie is great.
2414;"A superhero family trying to live ""an ordinary"" life is funny and also unpredictable."
2415;I'm sure most of you will love it.
2416;The Incredibles is a great film.
2417;art CG as well as whimsical yet thrilling story.
2418;For Finding Nemo, the frame was expanded to get the Full.
2419;the short features are amusing.
2420;Also amusing are some of the easter eggs.
2421;The Incredibles,I saw this in the theater and was totally involved in the story line which was hard at times because the animation is so outstanding.
2422;There is also some nice director's commentary.
2423;This is great animation movie for families.
2424;The intelligent and well written script won the writers a best script award and along with the amazing special effects they combine to produce the best animated film in many years.
2425;The action scenes are entertaining as well as spectacular, and after a while you hardly remember you're watching an animated film because the plot and characters seem so realistic and true to life.
2426;Overall a great effort from Pixar and they'll have to work hard to top this one.
2427;they laugh and just enjoy watching this.
2428;It is a nice family movie.
2429;it's also a darn good movie .
2430;so Finding Nemo, and is every bit as good as A Bug's Life and Toy Story.
2431;It is truly a very nice movie for the whole family.
2432;The whole family loves this movie!
2433;take time to watch it!
2434;My kids love this movie!
2435;I definitely recommend it to anyone.
2436;The Incredible make me laugh and cry at the same time good movie for children and adults.
2437;You can always find a reason to be sad but to be happy and laughing is always a good thing.
2438;Great action/adventure movie for children.
2439;This film not only eliminates the traditional cartoon inadequacy, but it does better than live.
2440;action films in conveying the weight of the object being carried by Mr Incredible, or the superspeed thrill Dash experiences.
2441;fields of Violet are real.
2442;add a great story, if a bit dark because of so much reality .
2443;I even enjoyed how the family powers play in their duller lives.
2444;out dash is one of my favorites).
2445;"Like a kid in the movie cries out to Mr. Incredible, as he lifts a car in the air, that's how I felt about the latest movie from Pixar: ""Totally wicked!!"""
2446;With a retro feel and a blend of humor and James Bond.
2447;style action, comes 2004's most anticipated new animated movie.
2448;"From the first frame to the closing titles, ""The Incredibles"" balances incredible animation with a fun and touching story that has something for everyone."
2449;animation highlights almost top the story, making the characters more than believable.
2450;Shots of the characters floating in the sea, perfectly looking low.
2451;And it's all so natural, they make it seem easy!The truth is that there's nothing easy about putting together such a solid movie.
2452;A story that makes you think and laugh, and a technical achievement that is bound to become another classic.
2453;Also, I must say that, contrary to what most people think, the Argentine Spanish version is superior to the other two Spanish dubs AND to the original English soundtrack.
2454;The kids loved it (and well some of the adults did too).
2455;This movie is amazing, i hope they come out with another one.
2456;It has spanish sound so my baby can continue learning spanish, and it fits in his genre right there with superman, and spider man.
2457;This movie has everything it has humor and its an adventure , and its great for kids and adults.
2458;I highly recommend this movie to adults and children alike.
2459;This movie will tell you.
2460;A great movie for small and big children.
2461;forward 15 years, and you get the Parr family.
2462;Violet is a teenage girl who can turn invisible and create force fields.
2463;There's the action, of course.
2464;The people at Pixar did a good job of creating normal family situations for their super hero characters.
2465;Violet and her powers especially are the perfect match.
2466;and that's the great thing about this movie.
2467;Because of the super hero storyline, small kids won't enjoy it as much as previous Pixar offerings.
2468;But the rest of the family will find it highly entertaining.
2469;disc set contains the movie in widescreen with full surround sound.
2470;Transferring directly from the digital source, it looks and sounds great.
2471;There are two great commentaries for this movie, one with director Brad Bird and Producer John Walker .
2472;"jack Attack"" is all new, and features the story of what Jack."
2473;This film is great fun and extremely deserving of its recent Oscar win.
2474;Pixar has another winner on its hands.
2475;I hope their winning streak continues for quite some time to come.
2476;At the time of writing we have little more than the trailer of this film to measure it's merits.
2477;Sure, the premise of a family of super heroes returning to work after a prolonged absence is high.
2478;several months ago, during the fine.
2479;tuning of this film, Pixar announced it's split from Disney.
2480;perform it in every way.
2481;picture deal as well as, important this, control of all of the characters created for the films.
2482;This will be Pixar's sixth film for Disney (with Cars to follow next year) and it's possible that the fruitlessness of working FOR Disney as opposed to WITH them, may have made the folks at Pixar a little less willing to produce top.
2483;also, for your consideration, is the competition.
2484;i hold my hopes high and proud for The Incredibles.
2485;I even bought Treasure Planet!
2486;I just hope they know what they're doing and do it well.
2487;We love gorgeous animation but hate style over content.
2488;Walt knew this and Pixar know this .
2489;my 9 year old loves this movie and you cant find it anywhere so needless to say he was very happy
2490;I will keep this in my collection forever!
2491;This is my all time favorite movie.
2492;It came it perfect shape and played with no clitch.
2493;Great VO performances and a clever take on aging, relevance, and family this movie is a go to film for our family.
2494;Kids love it and my wife and I do too.
2495;I saw this movie because my sister is into animation and computer graphics and I must say I enjoyed it a lot.
2496;the plot is very original, the characters life.
2497;like and the effects are amazing.
2498;The humor is fresh and very appropriate for its rating.
2499;my grand children liked it, my son liked it, and i like it.

2501;( I enjoy those too, even if they are uninteligent.
2502;E. g anyone who thinks the battle of stirling bridge was fought in an open field and won by mooning the opposition can enjoy a mel gibson movie.)
2503;Director Brad Bird nicely mixes the 60's bond pictures with great commentary on being who are and what happens if you don't.
2504;He's great doing the voice work for Edna mode too.
2505;After watching, I was very, VERY pleased with the movie.

2513;Mr. Incredible (now going by the name Mr. Parr) is bored and miserable (to say the least)"
2514;There are quite a few poignant moments here.
2515;"The last hour especially is action packed and very well done!The movie won a second Oscar for sound editing at this year's Academy Awards ceremony
2516;There are two full length commentaries on disc one.
2517;The first track is indeed more personal since the two men had such a close personal relationship"
2518;The interviews with Director Brad Bird are captivating and really informative!
2519;"GRINSomething else that is interesting is the extra ""Vowellet,"" an essay by Sarah Powell, who voices Violet Parr: a great insight regarding Powell's perception of voicing an animated superhero."
2520;This extra includes Frozone and a mute rabbit named Mr. Skipperdoo.
2521;and WE reap the rewards watching it over and over again!
2522;It's a spoof of the superhero genre, as well as a spoof on the audience that found it so amusing.

2528;Will they succeed?The Incredibles does more than provide entertainment and laughs, it also teaches family values.
2529;Like all Pixar movies, there are plenty of laughs for kids and adults along with adult themes that will go over the heads of younger audiences.
2530;All in all, a great family film.
2531;Five stars for being the best animated film of the year.
2532;This was definitely a wonderful movie worth seeing.
2533;It is much better than most other recent popular animated movies of the last half.

2535;The movie has a collection of very unique special effects, not seen anywhere before.
2536;This is a very fun and easy movie to watch.
2537;jack Attack, is an interesting piece that goes over what happened with Jack.
2538;I love this movie even more than my kids.
2539;Mom is great and she doesn't get killed.
2540;What is it with animated movies and Mom always has to die??
2541;"In essence, it is something of a parody of the world of superheroes, and yet it is a parody that somehow seems more indicative of normal human experience than any of those other ""real"" superhero movies do."
2542;Part of the brilliance is that this is done in a family context.
2543;When you see Mrs. Incredible (aka Elastigirl) trying to wrangle her kids around the dinner table with arms that can stretch to ridiculous lengths, you understand that it is a metaphor for what a real mother has to do every day.
2544;The Incredibles is inventive, exciting, funny, and very poignant.
2545;I anxiously await the sequel, which, given the success of this one, is surely to be made.

2550;Like I said, I went into the movie with high expectations.
2551;I enjoyed every minute of this movie, and watched it again the very next day.
2552;It truly is a great movie.
2553;hollywood cartoon, and for that I love it.
2554;It delivers a truely positive message, that you shouldn't accept mediocrity and strive to be your best and do your part.
2555;In the spirit of Ayn Rand, the heros are the most able bodied people in the movie.
2556;They want to use thier raw talent and super skills to help the world, but also to satisfy their own ego.
2557;But in the end, individualism wins out.
2558;A very positive message for these times against a sea of self pity films.
2559;the special features are alot of fun too.
2560;who knows if this movie intended to be a societal satire, but in the end it succeeded in being a great critique and great entertainment.

2573;this story is well written and the characters are more human than a lot of characters who are actually human.
2574;They have emotions and big hearts and they love, make sacrifices, discover truths about each other and themselves, suffer, and feel loss.
2575;They also argue about which is the right turn on the freeway and deal with unruly kids who have strong wills and their own minds about how things should work.
2576;The animation and visuals are glorious and stunning, and the story itself is inspiring, unbeliebably creative, and downright extraordinary.
2577;See it, and you'll be entertained, get charged up, be inspired, and laugh and laugh and laugh.
2578;It is hard to find a good family movie now a days.
2579;This movie is very good and pretty funny.
2580;What a great voice cast!
2581;Kooky, funny, exciting and fun.
2582;Great writing acting and animation.
2583;Very very funny and clean for the kids!
2584;The Incredibles is a movie that adults will enjoy as much as kids.
2585;Together with his wife, the former Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), Mr. Incredible enters a sort of superhero witness protection program.
2586;Mr. Incredible/Bob soon finds himself in the middle of a very sticky situation, and his wife and children have to return to their superhero roots in order to save the day.
2587;i absolutely loved this movie.
2588;It's very funny and original, and all of the characters are fantastic.
2589;In addition to the Incredibles, there's Bob's best friend Lucius Best, the former superhero Frozone, who is voiced by Samuel L. Jackson.
2590;My favorite character is a quirky little woman with big glasses named Edna Mode who designs superhero outfits.
2591;overall, I loved this movie.
2592;The Incredibles is a fun movie that also stresses the importance of family and teamwork.
2593;It was such a good movie!
2594;They are So clever:) what a great look at super Heroes from another perspective.
2595;Edna is terrific as the costume designer!
2596;watching it years from now i loved it.
2597;A movie any kid will enjoy (:
2598;The Incredibles is one the best movie ever.
2599;The bonus features including Jack.
2600;Good all around family fare.
2601;One of the best animated shows.
2602;We have all enjoyed this movie and are glad to own it.
2603;Pixar Animation Studios produced another brilliant and superbly animated film in 2004 entitled """"The Incredibles""""."""
2604;He yearns to relive the good old days of saving people and one night, while he and Lucius are looking for someone to save while listening to a police scanner in a car, they are being watched.
2605;"It is no wonder that ""The Incredibles"" won the Oscars for Best Animated Film and Best Sound Editing, and received Oscar nominations for Best Achievement in Sound and Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen."
2606;"The film's story was one of the best that Pixar has ever produced (ranking right up there with ""Finding Nemo"" from 2003), and I wholeheartedly recommend it."
2607;Overall, I rate it with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.
2608;Many thanks go to the numerous people that helped to create the film.
2609;Honestly I think Brad Bird must be a magician to have crafted something so beautiful and subtlely complex.
2610;I am in awe of this Pixar creation.
2611;Best film they have done so far by a longshot.
2612;Everything about it is perfection.
2613;Entertaining for young ones and adults alike!
2614;I would highly recommend this movie.
2615;What I got was a movie that was good but had a lot of periods where I found myself losing concentration.Yes the movie has its moments.
2616;There is a lot of good adult intended humor thrown in.
2617;the Thing (both super strong).
2618;Pixar and Disney have done it again creating a fun filled adventure for the whole entire family and it plays off like a super hero movie as well.
2619;The characters are enjoyable especially the old lady who creates the super outfits.
2620;A winner of incredible proportions though it's fun and exciting it isnt a masterpiece
2621;the details really make this film.
2622;"Yes, it's a story about a family of superheroes, but it's also about lawsuits, family life, the dangers of capes, midlife crises, ""feel good"" education, and fandom."
2623;This is one of the few joys that it produced.
2624;i especially appreciate the emotional dimensions that the film evokes.
2625;I hope that the success of The Incredibles allows people to discover Brad Bird's other masterpiece.
2626;THE INCREDIBLES will undoubtedly take animation into a whole new realm.
2627;"The animation in this film is unquestionably incredible
2628;The voice actors are superb, from Craig T. Nelson's Mr. Incredible to Brad Bird's amazing Edna Mode"
2629;I for one am interested in who did what, so that's just a hint for future animated films.
2630;So, while I hope we see more imaginative films like this one, I hope Pixar and others don't forget the animated films that AREN'T realistic or lifelike.
2631;we still have a place for them, that I hope the success of THE INCREDIBLES does not diminish.
2632;Nonetheless, THE INCREDIBLES is an incredible achievement.
2633;This is an incredibly well done transfer of a fabulous movie.
2634;In this case, it's the golden age of superheroes in the 1950s.
2635;She struggles to help her incredible children blend in a mediocre world.
2636;and thus Pixar has perfectly captured the American family tropes.
2637;bob hangs out with his buddy, the very cool Lucius Best, AKA Frozone (Samuel Jackson) in a role as an African.
2638;The contrast between this role and Jackson as villain in Untouchables should amuse fans of both films.
2639;He takes on freelance work and finds a new zest for life.
2640;When Bob disappears on one of his missions, it's up to the family to rescue him.
2641;throughout, there are a variety of threads that tweak the superhero genre.
2642;what's amazing about this film is the depth of the characters.
2643;By now it's expected that each animated personality will perfectly embody the mannerisms of the actors who play them.
2644;Syndrome is a masterful interpretation of the actor who voices him, with every mannerism and sideways glance.
2645;Elastigirl manages to come across as strong, vulnerable, protective, fiery, and even playfully kittenish .
2646;Elastigirl, a stay at home mom mind you, has made such an impression that there are several threads discussing her on the Internet.
2647;equally as important is the relationship between the characters.
2648;Mr. Incredible's mettle is repeatedly tested and by overcoming each challenge we understand that he is a genuinely good, if frustrated, father and husband.
2649;And there is a lot of tension (the good kind) between Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, early in their relationship and even years later.
2650;Mr. Incredible shouts that he thinks he knows a faster way.
2651;And for a brief second, despite the fact that the entire family is wearing bright red costumes and possesses superpowers, we understand that this is YOUR family, shouting, arguing, and loving each other.
2652;Pixar consistently creates compelling stories that teach as well as entertain.
2653;The Incredibles is Pixar at the top of their game and should not be missed by anyone who loves superheroes.
2654;The Incredibles is an amazing movie from the folks at Pixar.
2655;Children and adults would enjoy watching this movie together.
2656;The characters are very interesting, I especially enjoyed Edna who is a combination of Q and elite fashion designer with the supercilious attitude to match, great fast moving plot and lots of action and adventure.
2657;One of the great aspects about this movie for adults is the social commentary the movie makes and the influence of the Sean Connery James Bond movies of the 1960s.1.
2658;The movies uses 50s motif from the cars, homes, and furniture.
2659;"teen son Dash that ""Everybody is special""."
2660;"In a wonderful insightful rebuttal Dash responds, ""That makes nobody special"".5."
2661;Much of the music in the movie is strongly influenced by the music from the James Bond movies of the 1960s with the beat and the trumpets playing with the implement in the horn that muffles the sound.7.
2662;The theme of the movie that adults can enjoy is self.
2663;But when he gets to experience real challenges and uses his gifts his attitude changes.
2664;Violet is a shy grungy kid at first but like Dash after experiencing the adventures in the movie she becomes more extroverted and pays more attention to her appearance.9.
2665;The movie shows a loving, traditional suburban family in a good light.
2666;The idea of a superhero family permanently undercover because of lawsuits is neat, to begin with.
2667;"Craig T. Nelson gives a very believable style to ""Bob Parr"" (Mr. Incredible), as does Holly Hunter to Elastigirl."
2668;In fact, the animators managed to give all the characters a high degree of individuality and the scriptwriters included lots and lots of sometimes abstruse references to the world of comic books.
2669;Nice homage to Edith Head, too.
2670;As far as animated movies go, I thought i had seen the best of them with 'Finding Nemo'.
2671;This movie, which captures the internal torture of retired superhero father Mr. Incredible, is proof that even animated comedies about family bonding can include a smartly captivating save.
2672;"The most hilarity comes from baby Jack, who was thought to be a ""normal"" child."
2673;Her annoying voice and quick wit are very humorous which I think help tie the movie together.
2674;Another important theme in this movie is that you can never really give up something you truly love and enjoy.
2675;This idea helps the former superheros stay confident and want to save the world.
2676;Overall I thought it was a very entertaining movie that has good action and humor for an animated movie that is appropriate and enjoyable for the entire family.
2677;There is a message from a person who call herself Mirage and offers Mr. Incredible a job and that would pay him three times his yearly salary.
2678;While Bob is waiting for his next assignment, he works out in a train while Helen is thinking he is at work.
2679;Edna tells Helen to fight for her husband and go and get him.
2680;He wants to know how is on the plane and makes Mr. Incredible listen to a radio transmission.
2681;Syndrome sends out heat seeking missiles to destroy the jet and succeeds in doing so.
2682;Helen leaves the children in a cave and goes to look for Bob.
2683;She finds Bob and the two make a break from the cave and eventually hook up with their children.
2684;Syndrome is able to recapture them and is surprised to learn the Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl are married and got busy, my favorite line in the movie even if I did quote it correctly.
2685;Violet is able to use her force field powers and is able to free the family.
2686;The Incredibles and Frozone fight to destroy the Omnidroid and are successful in doing so.
2687;jack and Elastigirl rescues her son.
2688;The Incredibles is the first Pixar movie to have human only in it.
2689;Also the computer animation is great too.
2690;That way they can still offer their help to the police.
2691;"with ""The Incredibles"", Pixar goes the way of the big studios by making a superhero movie."
2692;Despite some similarity to the Fantastic Four, this idea works pretty well.
2693;It is fun to see the out of shape Mr. Incredible stuff himself into his costume and fight the bad guys.
2694;"The Incredibles is not as good as ""Toy Story"" 1 or 2 or ""Finding Nemo"", but kids and adults alike are sure to enjoy the majic that Pixar brings to the screen."
2695;My entire family love this movie, great for kids and adults alike!
2696;I wish they made more movies like this one!
2697;This movie is great for children, but it is totally awesome for adults.
2698;this movie is great for all ages.
2699;even our four year old loved it, in spite of the favt that she didn't follow the whole story line.
2700;Superman, Daredevil, The X. men, and The Amazing Spider.
2701;book superheroes that have captured the imaginations of not only young children, but those young at heart as well across the world.
2702;dimensional world of the nickel comic.
2703;books, their popularity began to grow and expanded into spectacular franchises that were developed in the areas of television series, movies, and merchandising.
2704;but no matter what the success, there will always be an audience for these fascinating figures.
2705;What is the cause for our fascinating fixation with these individuals and their seamlessly conventional plot.
2706;the story centers on a family of superheroes that try and go about their daily, normal lives as civil citizens while at the same time concealing their extraordinary powers in an effort to blend in with the regular populous.
2707;While at work, Bob dreams of the glory days when he was the world's greatest superhero, known exclusively as Mr. Incredible!
2708;See, that's the amazing thing about Pixar .
2709;cutter storyline, throw in a few dozen loveable characters, mind.
2710;blowing visual work, and pure.
2711;concentrated emotions, unveiling an absolutely genuine and memorable experience at the movies.
2712;but if it worked before, it is certainly worth a second attempt at least.
2713;Craig T. Nelson, best known as for his television series Coach on ABC, fits perfectly into the voice.
2714;Nelson truly puts effort into voicing the emotions of Bob Parr .
2715;This is another prominent area where Pixar excels beyond other studios, namely in choosing figures who are perfect for the leading role, not just because their name would look good on the marquee, but that they effectively move the film forward consistently and thoroughly with their emotional performance.
2716;John Ratzenberger, known exclusively as the lucky charm of the Pixar Animation Studios, is highly underused in this feature.
2717;is the most original and effective creation presented in the film.
2718;Don't take this the wrong way, there are plenty of amusing sequences to be found throughout the feature .
2719;up, we are in eager anticipation to witness what comes next.
2720;The talented artists and animators at Pixar Animation Studios have truly out done themselves this around.
2721;There are moments where you'll believe Syndrome's Island is an actual island .
2722;the palm trees, the ocean water, and the daunting aerial view of the location are astonishing.
2723;There are so few words to accurately describe the feeling you get watching the visuals of this film .
2724;And finally, in all honesty, The Incredibles has to be Disney and Pixar's most adult.
2725;skewed animated feature to date .
2726;but its an entertaining family film that gives every single member of the family something to talk about for weeks, or even months, to come going into the busy holiday season.
2727;old, was enjoying this movie like I was eight again.
2728;"That was cool"" a lot."
2729;visually, The Incredibles is stunning.
2730;"The characters are wonderfully rendered homages to the claymation holiday films of the early 60's (for those who have seen the movie, tell me that ""Syndrome"" and ""Heat."
2731;, and the detail put into everything else is superb.
2732;THAT kind of attention to detail is inspiring.
2733;pixar and Brad Bird have put together an exquisite piece of animated storytelling as well.
2734;ups (as I sometimes claim to be) will find plenty to be entertained by as well.
2735;The mundane moments of Bob and family are perhaps even more hilarious than the mile.
2736;"Wether it is Bob being lectured by his boss or Samuel L. Jackson's ""Frozone"" demanding to know where his wife placed his supersuit, this film literally takes superhuman moments and presents tham as something we can relate to and laugh about."
2737;lots of extras in here as well, including two short films (one completely unrelated to the movie, and one featuring a couple of minor characters from the movie).
2738;"There's also a 1960's style ""Mr. Incredible"" cartoon parody that I roared about, particlarly when Mr. Incredible and Frozone's comments were played."
2739;time favorite fun films, and if you're out there looking for a fun film yourself, I strongly recommend this one.
2740;Clever, cute, and fun, but also action.
2741;Highly recommended for some time to just relax and enjoy.
2742;kids and I love the incredibles!
2743;overall great family movie to watch together.
2744;One of our families favorites.
2745;Movie is a great and destined to be a classic.
2746;I really enjoyed the action&the visual effects a great deal within the context of this film.
2747;"I'd put this film right almost there with ""Shrek"" because of the concepts."
2748;it's a good film&the directing was cool.
2749;It's a great family movie with comedy and action for all ages to enjoy.
2750;Our 6 year old really enjoyed it and we enjoyed showing him one of our favorite movies.
2751;It's good, but it's just a deleted scene.
2752;"making of ""The Incredibles"" featurette:A nice 27 minute featurette but don't expect to see any credit whatsoever paid to the incredible voice talents of Holly Hunter, Craig T. Nelson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Lee, etc."
2753;Lots of fun, not for under 4s as the set.
2754;up takes a while and there's plenty of animated violence, family funny.
2755;Such a good movie, I didn't even mind that too much!
2756;At one time, superheros were everywhere, saving people using their impressive powers.
2757;up, but it is worth it because it gets us to know the family, dysfunctions and all.
2758;Writer Bird gets you in the head of this family of heros, making their eventual plight against syndrome all the more compelling, with the necessary detours of humor, with the funniest in the form of the short and out.
2759;The animation is absolutely breath.
2760;realism, or as real as you can get with a computer animated cartoon.
2761;"popping mix of heart, humor and animation, ""The Incrdibles"" is one of the best films of the year."
2762;The Incredibles is my favorite Pixar film.
2763;This is such an AWESOME movie!
2764;Each time I see it I think it's my absolute favorite Pixar movie.
2765;Every movie is so good though it's a tough call, but I really think this one takes the cake.
2766;I mostly got it so it'd be at the house for me to watch too.
2767;Now, I didn't see The Incredibles when it came out in theatres, nor when it received such high acclaim for reviewers or my friends, nor did I see it after the Oscar nomination.
2768;Yet, I released what I had waited for was worth the wait.
2769;Well, for Mr. Incredible (now spouse of Elastigirl) that pull takes him away from his family of super wife, two super kids, and one normal one.
2770;first of all, I am a fan of the animation style.
2771;The plot, which I hope I summarized with justice, is an exciting one although I could guess a couple of key components.
2772;overall though, it is funny, and out loud so.
2773;So, this film is definitely enjoyable, although I will not go so far, as many have, to rate it as Incredible.
2774;I love this movie for so many reasons.
2775;For my money, this is the best superhero movie ever.
2776;the writing is clever, absurd, and down to earth all at the same time.
2777;These characters have life, and I care about them.
2778;I especially love that it can be funny without having to resort to countless pop culture references that end up dating so many movies in the long run.
2779;but what I really love about this movie and these heroes is that they are heroes.
2780;it's a great message, but it's a message that isn't crammed down our throat.
2781;That's a rare thing in any movie, animated or otherwise.
2782;"Myself, the ""Mom"", my six year old or my two year old."
2783;This movie was hilarious and full of suspense.
2784;I liked that it wasn't predicatable and always was evolving.
2785;I cannot tell you how wonderful this movie is.
2786;Funny movie with a good message.
2787;Great family movie, my kiddos loved it.
2788;This is a great movie for the whole family!
2789;My kids really liked it, even my older kids, ages 13 &10
2790;Great animations throughout this family safe movie.
2791;Filled with so many funny moments and one liners that we have reiterated repeatedly.
2792;My toddler loves this movie it was a must have and a joy to view.
2793;I think she has a fascination with Pixar films.
2794;Such a good family movie!
2795;Clean with a good message!
2796;"winning* creators of ""Finding Nemo"" comes the action."
2797;packed animated adventure about the mundane and incredible lives of a house full of superheroes.
2798;exploding wtih fun and featuring an all.
2799;"jack Attack"" was really good."
2800;"The ""Deleted Scenes"" and ""Alternate Openings"" were good special features."
2801;"Top Secret Files On All The Supers was nice and so was the ""Behind the Scenes"" type of special features."
2802;The Incredibles is every word on the list that means incredible: awesome, excellent, incredible and wicked.
2803;"Every word that means incredible is what I will have to say about ""The Incredibles""."
2804;"The Incredibles is the year's most exciting Disney movie, and it is also the best family film since ""Shrek 2""."
2805;Shrek 2 was an excellent movie.
2806;"I loved ""Shrek 2"" as much as everyone does, but my opinion for an award for the most intellegent animation goes to ""The Incredibles""."
2807;"I thought the story to ""Shrek 2"" was much better than the story to ""The Incredibles"", but I like the animation to ""The Incredibles"" a lot more than I like the animation to ""Shrek 2""."
2808;The Incredibles is like the best superhero movie, best Disney movie ever made and one of the best movies ever made.
2809;"It's like all the superhero movies including ""James Bond"", the ""Spider."
2810;"man"" movies and the ""X. men"" movies
2811;Will Mr. Incredible and his family become part of its growing number of victims?I was pleasantly surprised by """"The Incredibles"""" and it's definitely become one of my favorite animated films!"""
2812;The plot of the movie was original with not only great main characters but fun and interesting secondary characters.
2813;One of my favorites has to be Edna (voice of Brad Bird) who is a quirky fashion diva who makes costumes/suits for superheroes.
2814;the story develops in an interesting way and is paced to keep your attention.
2815;You even keep your eyes glued to the screen during dinnertime at the Parr household just to see what will happen next.
2816;It's a movie the entire family can watch.
2817;It's full of age appropriate action and excitement with a great storyline that is easy for children to follow and enjoy.
2818;This is truly an amazing film with some excellent effects and a superb story.
2819;The Incredibles was a terrific movie.
2820;This movie is just as much fun for adults as it was for my two kids.
2821;Most kids (and kids at heart) also mark out big time for superheroes movies and cartoons SO a Pixar animated Super Hero flick = $$$,$$$.
2822;from there the film takes a humorous twist with all super.
2823;hero for saving lives) and we fast forward to see the super.
2824;we also see that our two main characters Mr. Incredible and Elasti.
2825;When all looks bleak with Mr. Incredible sidelined it takes the combined power of the Incredibles family to save him.
2826;"With the initial Batman vibe as Mr. Incredible makes his way throughout town saving lives and helping people and the later ""Fantastic Four"" and ""Bionic Six"" vibe the movie TOTALLY rocked my world."
2827;the plot villain is masterfully inserted into the film with a legitimate grudge against our hero and is brilliantly weaved in and out of the film.
2828;Awesome writing, character development and continuity from the Pixar gang.
2829;Plus, he's actually a cool (if geeky/dorky) villain.
2830;seeing the kids come out of their shells and display and use their cool powers was awesome.
2831;Pixar's animation gets better and better and most of all the movie's ending seems to leave open the possibilities for a SEQUEL.
2832;hero flicks or toons, you KNOW you'll see this one.
2833;Happily, the Incredibles is just that: incredible, an excellent movie that has no real missteps.
2834;In the opening, a documentary shows Mr. Incredible longing for a normal life while his wife, Elasti.
2835;Dash, the son, resembles the Flash or Quicksilver.
2836;although a Pixar production, this has much more in common with good live.
2837;While taking nothing away from earlier Pixar movies, this is a more mature work and geared to an older audience.
2838;This very maturity makes this not only an incredibly fun movie but also an incredibly good one as well.
2839;I am so impressed with the characters, storyline, graphics, technology.
2840;its gripping as if its a real life people.
2841;I can watch this movie hundered times.
2842;Sometimes I felt like I was in the movie with them, and I ended up seeing it twice!!!
2843;These Pixar films just get better and better.
2844;As well as being funny and action packed, it appeals to all ages and it's really moving in places too!
2845;keep up the good work.
2846;amazing colour, detail and soundtrack for a very funny film for all ages.
2847;year old son picked it up and was happy and talkin up a storm about it and pushing it at me and my wife so we decided to watch it with him.
2848;He liked the opening the scene the most I think because it's so exciting and fast paced, sorta like he is lol.
2849;I'd recommend this as definitely a family movie.
2850;This movie is great, I enjoy it as much he does.
2851;The music makes the movie and everything in the score is awesome.
2852;Fun High screeching trumpets and loud Jazzy brass, It's quite enjoyable since I crack up any time I hear a high screeching trumpet.
2853;I read a review on the soundtrack and it said it's going for that 60's jazz style so I guess it's set in the 60's.
2854;I think they did a good job with designing the characters in this movie.
2855;well I guess that's an okay not so detailed review.
2856;I just thought I'd hit some high spots I enjoyed and point out the fact that my son doesn't have nightmares from watching it everyday 3.4 times a day.
2857;He likes Mr. Incredible the best of course, this is clear.
2858;he thoroughly enjoys the movie even when he's playing with his toys he's still watching it.
2859;"Although I have enjoyed all of the Pixar films, I was kind of ""stand offish"" about this film."
2860;Monsters, Inc. is my favorite of their films.
2861;but, I am pleasantly surprised.
2862;I really enjoyed the characters, Bob and Helen mostly.
2863;as a true Disney fan, I loved the tribute to Frank and Ollie.
2864;over all, a well done film.
2865;thank you for keeping this 2 year old occupied
2866;Many themes that we can all relate to in real our.
2867;Incredibles is Pixar's best to date.
2868;fire souped up Alladin chase.3 laughs.
2869;up movie with enough action to keep pre.
2870;There are pauses in in the action for great dialogue, and some situations (the main superhero in hiding has to become an insurance claims adjuster, which I thought hilarious) will probably blow past kids under 10.
2871;The Incredible kids relate to each other in an authentic way.
2872;is worth the whole movie.
2873;"As she explains to Ms. Incredible, her costume withstands explosions, ""yet breathes like Egyptian cotton!"
2874;The movie takes risks and succeeds.
2875;The animation is a mix of the detail we expect from Pixar blended with 40s/50s comic stylism.
2876;This is the best full.
2877;the action adventure comedy is a all means The Incredibals.
2878;l really enjoyed this movie.
2879;It has a great story and is very well made.
2880;The animation is awesome and the story lots of fun.
2881;A great movie for young and old.
2882;My 3 year old likes it.
2883;The Incredibles is unlike any other Pixar film so far.
2884;The story appeals to a broader age range, making it the best family film in a long time .
2885;possible the best family film ever.
2886;The animation is superb, and shows a level of detail not seen in earlier films.
2887;The sets are retro late 60's/early 70's, as are the costumes and cars.
2888;The film is reminiscent of the great spy films of that era, too (think James Bond as a retired superhero with a family, and living in suburbia.)
2889;"Two underrated characters are ""Edith"" a superhero costume designer who is a tribute to the eight."
2890;"time Oscar winning costume designer Edith Head
2891;This one is a solid 5.
2892;The images were superb, and the story was excelent.
2893;All right,I have looked at my reviews and they stink right now,but i'll try my best on this one.
2894;First off,this movie is for all ages,the whole family will love it!
2895;The makers created a beatiful move with cool graphics.
2896;sound 5/5 The music is more heroic then the Batman movies.
2897;overral: This is a great movie for everybody.
2898;The best animated film I have ever seen, I would probably go as far as to say it is in my top 5 fave films of all time.
2899;Highly entertaining, with excellent animation, great dialogue that kids and adults can all understand and a great cast of voices, The incredibles is one of those movies you can watch over and over again and never get tired of.
2900;Features the wonderful Jason Lee as the voice of the nemesis """"syndrome""""."""
2901;Very happy we have this in the combo pack.
2902;ray we can even watch a movie at home.
2903;I am 62 years old, and still enjoy animated movies.
2904;This is one of my favorites all time adult animated movies.
2905;Great movie!Delivery of the order came in good time.
2906;disc Collector's Edition comes with some interesting extras.
2907;i found the offtakes/blubbers to be in bad taste, but the rest of the extras were worth seeing.
2908;This movie portrays the classic Incredibles tale.
2909;It is one of passion, untapped energy, good versus evil, and the eventually unifying experiences of a struggling family as they learn to work together for good.
2910;This movie is lots of fun and the lines are hilarious!
2911;I love the fact that it is a family of supers.
2912;Highly recommended for children of all ages.
2913;well time humor, great character personalities, and a well written script, and great directing drive this movie to become one of the best animated films ever made.
2914;hero's meet and fall in love and start a family of super.
2915;hero's are band from public view forever, due to liabilities.
2916;hero family comes to the rescue.
2917;In the end everything is right again and our Super.
2918;hero's are once again the Hero's of the day.
2919;This movie is one of the best new comedies out there.
2920;I laughed my butt off.
2921;There is a great blend of action, comedy, and drama.
2922;There is a great part right at the beginning where Mr. Incredible gets a cat out of a tree by uprooting the tree and shaking it till the cat lets go.
2923;There are some really good scenes where the children are figuring out just how they can use their powers to battle evil.
2924;I don't see the problem, but it's fine if you do.
2925;The idea that people with special abilities are special and should be allowed to outshine everyone else is very Ayn Randish and I enjoyed the conflict it created when the characters weren't allowed to be themselves.
2926;Best movie of the year.
2927;This animated is so good and action packed you will forget it is animation and think it is a movie.
2928;My son loves this movie.
2929;We espically love the action sequence when the whole family is fighting the bad guys on the island.
2930;This is a wonderful family movie that adults, as well as children, will like.
2931;I am always up to watch this move!
2932;He loves to watch this movie.
2933;He places the 5 family members into a character match up with our family of 5.
2934;We hope you enjoy this action packed, family tight, fun movie as our family did and still does!
2935;All ages will loves this movie!
2936;This is entertaining for all ages, I enjoy it my daughter and grand daughter all enjoyed it!
2937;Just watch it and let you inner child,geek,innner James Bond/Super MOM rejoice in the pure joy that is THE INCREDIBLES!!!
2938;The kids will love this movie too.
2939;A really enjoyable movie all round .
2940;Art, animation, voice acting, characterizations are all first rate.
2941;A nice idea and brilliant CGI work.
2942;you'll see what I mean), everything is perfectly done.
2943;This movie its great, not only for child but this movie belongs to the new category of all public animated movie.
2944;It's cute enough to be watched for children of all ages and has the lack of violence that put the mark of Disney, but is still very entertained and funny.
2945;, but do it in the context of a clever, knowing, arch and stylish script and cleverly worked screenplay.
2946;it's true: the old Pixar of Monsters, Inc. is back, and better than ever.
2947;"animated, and fresh
2948;When it came out it was pretty darn mind.
2949;minute runtime makes it potentially the lengthiest animated feature of them all.
2950;fighting prime, Bob finds himself sharing a modest home with his wife Helen, and their three children Violet, Dash, and Jack Jack.
2951;He works as an insurance.
2952;What follows is a wild discovery for the former super human that it will take the combined efforts of a super family to save the world from total destruction.
2953;comic affiliated superhero action film.
2954;Sure there's the family slant that's played on a bit more than what's common in most comic hero tales and there's visual clues that make it pretty difficult to pin down an exact time frame that the story is supposed to be taking place but realistically speaking, this is easily on par with some of the live.
2955;in the opinion of many, The Incredibles marks Pixar and Disney's perilous leap toward big kid entertainment what with a PG.
2956;rated and plenty of guns, explosions, and action.
2957;for the most part the formula he brings to the table works with a pretty even balance of domestic drama to offset the crime fighting/ action scenes.
2958;a jazzy soundtrack coupled to super crisp visuals (especially in Hi.
2959;def) makes the flow and tone of the tale extremely easy to fall into.
2960;in all The Incredibles is a highly entertaining piece that still holds up well even half a dozen years after the fact.
2961;I am sure others love it.
2962;I enjoy kid movies and this had a good plot.
2963;It was funny and entertaining.
2964;Particularly enjoyed the babysitter's episode and the dress designer.
2965;The incredibles has a fantastic plot.
2966;And undoubtebly the best charecter, who presented an oscar, is Edna Mode.
2967;This was a fantastic movie.
2968;The visuals were especially amazing.
2969;The story was well written, and this movie greatly deserved the Oscar.
2970;By live action movie standards this movie rates extremely high on my list, I highly recommend this movie.
2971;This will definitely go down in film history as one of the best animated films made.
2972;Great movie for kids and adults alike.
2973;I also consider this a Disney classic.
2974;For me this movie is, without ANY doubt, the greatest super.
2975;hero movie made to date.
2976;This film displays action sequences that are jaw.
2977;dropping in scope, creative in execution, and as thrilling as they are beautiful.
2978;This film is a masterpiece.
2979;Toy Story and it's sequel are excellent films and I thought that there was no way Pixar could possibly continue creating that level of greatness.
2980;While A Bugs Life wasn't one of my favorites, it's still a fantastic film.
2981;The ending line in that film is one of my favorite closing moments in cinema.
2982;It's simple, heartfelt, and provides a beautiful impression that their world will continue in a positive direction despite the end of the movie (something that kids, the target audience, need to know).
2983;Finding Nemo, like all other Pixar films, has a strong family message and it provides us with some beautiful visuals.
2984;Again, Pixar built upon it's own accomplishments and provided us with a film that will be heralded as a classic and loved by future generations.
2985;As impressed as I am with all of the other Pixar films, and as much as I love them, The INCREDIBLES is better.
2986;This film is rated PG for good reason.
2987;He is a murderer and takes delight in holding that kind of power over other people.
2988;Must also recommend the movie, ICE AGE.
2989;This movie does help keep PIXAR as a name brand I can trust when it comes to movies!
2990;I know it's a bad pun but this movie truly is incredible.
2991;This movie was cute, funny, and entertaining.
2992;I will definitely watch this movie again.
2993;Pixar continues to improve and slowly wins me back to the world of animated films.
2994;I liked what I saw and bought the Incredibles and have now watched it many times over.
2995;Brad Bird scores another winner with this one.
2996;I don't know how but Brad Bird seems to be able to convey a sense of caring and connection with his animated characters.
2997;I think it is because he develops his story very well and the story is his main concern.
2998;this superhero family starts with mom and dad superhero.
2999;But like the great American story all things must come to be sued.
3000;Then the fun begins when the world needs the """"supers"""" again."""
3001;Great story, smart humor and just plain funny!
3002;This is one of my favorite Disney movies.
3003;I bought this and I don't even have kids!
3004;my nephew got me to watch this movie about a year ago and i loved it.
3005;thanks for the great service.
3006;The movie came in great shape from the seller and it plays great.
3007;The entire family loves it.
3008;The animation in this movie is just beautiful and sometimes photorealistic.
3009;At times, the animated characters faces look real.
3010;But other than that, this movie is a feast for the eyes.
3011;Very happy with the item discs play great and cover is nice i would say that it is almost like new rather than very good, though
3012;Except this one is funny also.
3013;It was good enough for one.
3014;I now have in my archives one of the greatest animated movies ever.
3015;This is one of those movies that my family and I can watch over and over and over again.
3016;it was in good shape and played perfectly.
3017;A good fun movie that anyone could watch a few times.
3018;SOme movies you see once and that is it, this one you can watch once in a while and still like it.
3019;With two more movies to go under the wrath of Disney, Pixar Studios comes out with their best yet in The Incredibles.
3020;bound superhero who loves the hero life.
3021;Our happy hero couple now have three kids: Dash, who has the power of great speed, Violet, who has the same powers as the Invisible Girl in the Fantastic Four, and Jack Jack, whose powers are unknown until the end of the movie.
3022;after getting fired from his regular job, Mr. Incredible finds a contract job in which he can use his super powers.
3023;Brad Bird, the director, has done an amazing job with the movie.
3024;i can easily say that this movie is worth both the matinee and night time movie prices.
3025;have fun and don't forget to leave the cape at home.
3026;I guarantee that most people will forget this is animated for large stretches because of how interesting the characters are AND how well they are developed.
3027;Two methods are used to accomplish this brilliantly.
3028;One is the great interplay and dialogue which is typically confrontational between close friends and family members as well as between the heroes and villians.
3029;"This, I believe, is key to the success of every great story from ""Lord of the Rings"" to ""Star Wars (IV,V,VI)"" to ""Harry Potter""."
3030;secondly, the plot is superior among animated movies.
3031;"I admit I liked ""Toy Story I and II"" as well as great Japanese stuff like ""Spirited Away"", but although they are spectactularly animated they're still kid movies."
3032;This flick has a great complex superhero plot which has several great surprises and twists and isn't revealed to the audience all at once.
3033;The suspense continues until the very end which ends on an uplifting family note and ties off all the subplots for each character beautifully.
3034;lastly, the comedic aspect is superb.
3035;theme this movie will draw in even those most critical of this budding genre of computer.
3036;"aided animation by, once again, the film's ability to suspend the audience's realization that these aren't ""real people""."
3037;"The overcoming of personal obstacles which characterizes the best of superhero movies is front and center in this movie, but unlike Batman and Spiderman, the family aspect gives the movie a kind of ""everyman"" applicability that the average film."
3038;It has the whole family making quotes and references.
3039;is Violet, and he is Dash.
3040;It is a very entertaining movie for kids and grown.
3041;They try their best to live normal lives.
3042;She says she neeeds his help as Mr. Incredible, to save them.
3043;But will she find him in time?This movie is great for all ages and is definitely recomended!
3044;there was a great amount of action in the film, which did keep me entertained.
3045;And there were a few moments were I chuckled a bit (Mr. Incredible is very hilarious at times).
3046;So, this movie is worth it.
3047;so, the rocky ride ends after the comedy, action, and adventure start to kick.
3048;But, it's still a fun family film, and I would recommend it.
3049;There are plenty of reviews on this movie.
3050;It's my favorite Pixar movie and that's all I really have to say about it.
3051;It was very well done, must have been thousands of hours of work by a top notch team.
3052;It was as entertaining as a movie can get, excellent for all ages.
3053;all the bugaboos of modern PC are hit, from a sue.
3054;"happy public, to enforced mediocrity ""Everyone is special which means nobody is."
3055;Add to that action, comedy and you have a real winner.
3056;class animated film about a superhero and his family who are forced to seek the anonymity of a government witness protection program to escape a rash of lawsuits orchestrated by their enemies.
3057;This is hardest on the children as they play with youngsters at school and on the athletic field.
3058;By now Mr. Incredible is older and fatter but he still proves equal to the challenge.
3059;The rest of the movie is filled with excitement and comical moments as Mr. Incredible finds himself in a tight spot from which only his family can rescue him.
3060;The cast is headed by Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter.
3061;Oscars were won for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year and Best Achievement in Sound Editing.
3062;In addition, THE INCREDIBLES won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Animated Film.
3063;And if there is ever a chance to share my opinion, even if it's not perfect, I'll be more than happy to share with anyone on AMAZON.
3064;And on top of that, we even watched the many special features that are also part of the 2 Disc Collection.
3065;"Several years after the ""end"" of their lives as crime fighters, both of them move from the city and into the burbs to live a more normal life with their three children."
3066;You will find yourself amazed at how well these stories are written and how you will find yourself enjoying this movie as much as your kids!Bob gets to the island for his secret mission, one that was delivered to him in the most amazing way.
3067;He learns that his mission is basically to save all of the world and he'll need to recruit some help.
3068;Even if you're not much into the whole superhero scene, you'll find enough exciting and interesting graphics and animations to keep you bright.
3069;disc Widescreen Edition would make a great gift, especially for those neighbor friends who seemed overwhelmed and need a small break from the kids!
3070;Enjoy this great flick and feel free to laugh as much as your children do.
3071;It's okay to feel like a 5 year old again!Break out the popcorn and enjoy the film!
3072;And thanks for taking the time to read my short description of an animated film that our entire family enjoyed.
3073;"And I have to say, aside from the ""Balant."
3074;"we are then introduced to older personas of Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl's lives as a married couple with two children named ""Violet"" (whom possess the power to create force fields and become invisible."
3075;The concept of a woman sewing and creating the super.
3076;Pixar and Disney is probably the first to put the idea to use on screen.
3077;"The voice acting is great, however, there are some hiccups and oddness with some characters
3078;moments, leaving you with a giddy feeling (Flash .
3079;I enjoyed this movie for the most part despite its lagging storyline, halfcocked characters and would.
3080;be dramatic moments in between all the comedy and action.
3081;I loved this film, it has a great message about the importance of being a good father, wchich is rare in the media these days.
3082;It is intense at times and has some adult action in it.
3083;I don't want to give away the plot so all I will say is the effects are awesome, the storyline is great!
3084;It's funny, adventurous and down right hilarious!
3085;Best scenes are with Edna Mode.
3086;The story line is brilliant.
3087;The movie is one of Pixar's best.
3088;My 9 month old grandson was transfixed by the movie, and really seemed to enjoy it.
3089;Something has always bothered me about Pixar movies: Have you ever noticed how there seems to be SOME somewhat questionable moral aspect of the cast or the storyline?
3090;a. homosexual actor Tom Hanks and former cocaine dealer Tim Allen portraying the main heroes of this tale aimed primarily at families and kids.
3091;a character that could burst into flame at will!
3092;For some reason, the """"Comics Code Authority"""" has always seen fit to attach it's seal to this book as well, though it would seem that the book should be a classic target for sanctions!"""
3093;That out of the way, the rest of this movie is a blast!
3094;"The Pixar animators have a real way with animating their female characters: Jessie was the best thing about ""Toy Story 2"" and Helen Parr, Edna Mode and Mirage are three of the best things about this film."
3095;Helen is protrayed as a strong, resourceful lady who is nonetheless cute as a bug's ear, and endearing.
3096;E, kind of an apparel.
3097;"based ""Q"" for the superhero community and she is funny as the demanding, perfectionist costumer."
3098;The voice and the insane thought processes of the character are done beautfully, as is the crazed permanent expression on the character's face.
3099;the sibling rivalry between the characters Dash and Violet Parr, Mr. and Mrs. Incredible's progeny, is comical, epsecially in a scene at the dinner table, and Elastigirl's affection for them and her husband is priceless.
3100;Incredible is good too, portraying him as a gentle, but strong father figure that nobody in the family is going to walk all over.
3101;"action animated characters in the style of George Pal's ""Puppetoons"" than CGI."
3102;but if you feel pretty confident your family is sane.
3103;We love pixar and the movie is lots of fun.
3104;Not all the bonus features are great but it is still a wonderful selection
3105;my kids love this movie.
3106;they watch it over and over, and it is a must have for road trips.
3107;This is one of those movies I had to go to because one of my family members didn't want to see the movie that I wanted to see.
3108;So entertaining that I actually enjoyed watching it.
3109;This was probably the most entertaining animated movie that I have ever seen.
3110;Most enjoyable when watching with the younger kids who see them truly as superheroes.
3111;Adults will enjoy the humor aimed at them regarding the troubles a superhero faces when his services are no longer required and he must get a normal job to support his family like the rest of us mere mortals.
3112;Not much, this movie has it all: action, adventure, humor, good guys, bad guys, sidekicks, explosions, superpowers and all around family fun.
3113;ray experience truly stands out.
3114;the movie itself also rates 5.
3115;stars, and is an entertainer for the entire family .
3116;I found the scenes between Elastigirl and Edna to be the most amusing!
3117;jack Attack in the extra features was good footage.
3118;"ray and we must bring the crew back and film them bantering with each other""."
3119;This animated feature presents the most human performance by CGI characters so far.
3120;Animated characters that can appeal to you emotionally signifies the vast improvements in both technique and technology.
3121;It is these life experiences that make 'THE INCREDIBLES' (so aptly named) rise above the ordinary.
3122;This flick will be remembered for its amazing voice characterisations and the flawless animation depicting the action and emotion withequal panache.
3123;Craig T. Nelson is unforgettable as Mr. Incredible and so is Holly Hunter as Elasti.
3124;Edna Mode is a highlight and probably one of the funniest pokes at the fashion world (Zoolander is probably the best).
3125;syndrome and Dash are enthusiastically voiced and give the characters a lot of life.
3126;It has tremendous repeat value and the bonus featuresare worth exploring more than once.
3127;Get this one right now !
3128;I took my kids to see this film this weekend, and I was truely surprised.
3129;instead, this a true superhero movie.
3130;Don't let the basic plot fool you, there is plenty of action, suspense, humor, and even (gasp!)
3131;Its an outstanding film in all respects, and gets my highest possible recommendation.
3132;"Everything about ""The Incredibles"" is incredible."
3133;Thenew Pixar film just released this weekend is a previewof things to come from the animation annals ofHollywood.
3134;"If you were entertained by such ""Pixar""flicks as ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Toy Story"", ""A Bug'sLife"" and ""Finding Nemo"", this one is better."
3135;animation has reached new heights.
3136;"I really don'twant to give away any of the plot, other than thisfilm is so entertaining you will walk away feeling apart of the ""Incredible"" family."
3137;The casting issuperb with the voices of Holly Hunter, Samuel L. jackson, and Craig T. Nelson.
3138;The special effectswill amaze you.
3139;This one is destinedto be a classic.
3140;"It is truly a ""feel good""movie."
3141;The characters were hilarious, and quite memorable.
3142;"The animation was ""incredible"", and there was a lot of hard work and creativity put into this funny, cute, well."
3143;Edna is definately one of my favorite characters, even if she's only shown a few times.
3144;if you liked Shrek, Shrek 2, Finding Nemo, or Shark Tale, you'll enjoy this movie!
3145;first off One of Pixar's benefits is using animation to create worlds unlike any other, and they did it so with The Incredibles despite the fact this movie could have been live action.
3146;The animation is more simple compared to some of their other movies, but it's slick, sometimes simple comic book style (looks similar to Team Fortress, whatever style that's supposed to be) makes it's lounge.
3147;The use of Googie architecture is a big plus because I love that style, and slick effects and cool gadgets galore make their way into the world of the Incredibles.
3148;influenced score further adds to it's slickness.
3149;incredibles once again gets some great voice talents (including Tarantino's most frequent collaborator.
3150;All of these characters are likable, and while I don't feel they are as likable as some of Pixar's other movies (I wish there was a dog exactly like Dug), they still add for some very relatable situations.
3151;But then again, it's enjoyable because it's straightforward satire, and nothing else.
3152;Kind of like Faces (John Cassavetes who most of you have probably never heard of) but the characters actually fix their family life and it ends on a much more positive note.
3153;It may not ring home with me as it does with the middle age people (Brad Bird himself based it off of his experience, so I don't think this movie was made to pander), but it's funny and understandable even to a person who doesn't have the full gist of what it's like to be middle age.
3154;There are some very witty moments in here, the capes scene is classic, and I just love Edna Mode's gleeful passion of her costumes during the scene where she shows her new decided costumes, while Helen just stares with mixed feelings, having no idea how to react to something on display.
3155;The concept of superheroes being sued is very clever, and this movie is, to sum it up short, fun.
3156;Incredibles is great fun as an action movie, while not violent, but creative as well.
3157;for a PG movie, The Incredibles has some really entertaining action scenes, proving that you don't need gore and Bay style intensity to make a good action movie.
3158;The Incredibles delivers great action sequences, creative and varied, even topped off with sound design that was rightfully awarded at The Academy Awards.
3159;I love both of those movies, but the Incredibles really has some of the most entertaining, creative, and even easy to follow action sequences in recent memory.
3160;Incredibles is not quite incredible, but it's still yet another winner from Pixar.
3161;this movie gets it right!
3162;for the price you get the right amount of Value!If you are a fan of this movie get this version!!!
3163;i'm 22 and I probably enjoyed it as much as any kid would, Pixar keeps bringing the great movies.
3164;"You really feel gripped by the story and the lives of ""The Incredibles""This movie is a must see, plenty of funny parts, lots of action and good characters."
3165;The humor is brilliant, the animation is spectacular, the script is witty and sharp, the plot is engaging and suspenseful, and the emotional payoff is very satisfying.
3166;"the vocal talent, particularly from Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter, is stellar.you really empathize with these characters and forget that they are not actually ""real."""
3167;There is a bit of intense action here, which is where the PG rating comes in.
3168;However, most children above the age of 10 should be able to handle it, and they will love the film.
3169;wise, it's a sonic boom.
3170;a rich, full, clean sound that roars like a rocket ride.
3171;"jack Attack"" is a treasure."
3172;It's all done in the same snappy, smart comedic mode that makes the feature itself so excellent.
3173;grab a bucket of popcorn, nestle on a comfy couch, and enjoy.
3174;And my kids loved this movie so much that' they watched it twice!
3175;A small omnidroid will appear in the upper right corner.
3176;If you scroll to this picture, you will find an additional extra feature.
3177;You can also choose him for an additional extra feature.
3178;My kids' favorite characters in this movie are Dash and Jack.
3179;Maybe I am a mother, so I love to see cool and cute little kids.
3180;The movie is good, but I feel it is for adults, teens and pre.
3181;I just came back from seeing `The Incredibles' and must say that it is one of the best movies that I have watched this year!
3182;The people at Pixar have succeeded again in making a unique movie that is entertaining for both kids as well as adults.
3183;director Brad Bird (who also directed WB's `The Iron Giant' which is another amazing movie!)
3184;Will they be accepted as superheroes again?Combining various elements of various superheroes like The Fantastic Four and X. men, this amusing story provides us with adventure (an immediate scene that comes to mind is when Dash and Violet try to save themselves in the jungle), comedy (the character of Edna Mode was hilarious!)
3185;, suspense and a moral, which is basically what everyone looks for in a good movie.
3186;The special effects and CGI for this movie is amazing.
3187;"Hey, the CGI is not enough though
3188;It still looked fresh and humorous.
3189;I would really welcome it sequel.
3190;I would recommend other to watch this movie.
3191;Once again Pixar has come up with a winner to add to its already impressive stable.
3192;In short everything is done right and everyone in the whole family should find something to like about this film.
3193;Obviously this would be an excellent film to sequel as we watch the kids grow up and such.
3194;I still can't help but feel that Pixar, now once again going its own way without Disney backing it, has got some more room to grow.
3195;Other then that it's a very captivating movie and what's more, its adult.
3196;I was on the edge of my seat.
3197;The cgi is flawless but I prefer the more 'human' design of the characters from shrek 2 rather then the caricature.
3198;This movie is a fantastically written.
3199;The characters are well developed and the animation is very well done.
3200;We watched this movie with the grand.
3201;It not only entertained the kids.
3202;but my wife and I enjoyed it also.
3203;A good classic cartoon hero movie.
3204;This is an all time great family movie.
3205;Had to add this movie to my grand kids collection, they love it.
3206;THis movie is Pixar's BEST movie.
3207;Great Animation, storyline,and It's funny as hell.
3208;first, the voice acting is outrageous.
3209;secondly, The Incredibles is pretty much an animated version of The Fantastic Four with Iceman in the sense that they have the same powers as them.
3210;I honestly don't know what that was about.
3211;Also, the soundtrack (played mostly by Gordon Goodwin's band :]) fits right in.
3212;'The Incredibles' does Pixar's creative team proud once more, blending literally jaw.
3213;dropping CGI animations with excellent voice talent, huge production values, a hefty dose of humour, and most importantly, an excellent storyline.
3214;Dad works in Insurance, Mom stays at home with the kids.
3215;and in the grand traditions of dual identities, action and adventure, and double.
3216;the animation is beautiful .
3217;deformed characters move with a grace and fluidity that makes their cartoony world believable, and water and flame effects surpass even those seen in 'Finding Nemo'.
3218;who can say what the latter 'Batman' movies might have been if they'd had this sort of creative impetus behind the camera?Vocal talent comes in the shape of Craig T. Nelson as lovable and impulsive Mr. Incredible, Holly Hunter as his frustrated wife Elastigirl, and Brad Bird's absolutely hilarious turn as superhero designer.
3219;couturier Edna Mode is some of the best characterisation Pixar's ever given us.
3220;with such wonderful source material as this, a movie of a lesser storyline could have been catapulted into the ranks of animation greats, but thankfully Pixar scores on this front, too, and via a series of quirky events and clever, more mature themes (legal battles and infidelity .
3221;The Incredibles, together with """"Finding Nemo"""", """"Shrek 1 and 2"""", """"Madagascar"""" and the """"Spy Kids"""" series, certainly mark a turning point in terms of animated moviemaking."""
3222;it is just plainly great.
3223;But everything will change for Mr. Incredible and his family when an interesting business proposal will ultimately make him wear his superhero suit again for an exciting new job.
3224;my kids just love this movie (and so do I!)
3225;This is a great movie that promotes family unity.
3226;the reason I so liked this movie was the idea of family, and how the writer of this movie envisons how a family should be.
3227;There's enough humor for the adults, and plenty of action for the kids.
3228;hearing Coach (Craig T Nelson) as the Dad, and Holly Hunter as his wife.
3229;And Samuel Jacksone as Frozone is just amazing.
3230;This is a very cute movie that was suitable for the whole family (even Grandma).
3231;They had some very clever writers.
3232;This is cute and really funny in spots.
3233;A good movie that could have, no should have been better.
3234;I love this movie, but I like to see movies without any complications.
3235;The film is a must to see to all ages, and with the whole family.
3236;The director put bits and parts of the every day of a family.
3237;husbands can relate with Mr. Incredible, as wife, boys and girls.
3238;the superpowers are very well choosen.
3239;Love the truth in Every Hero needs to live in the truth of his passion.
3240;Another great film by Disney/Pixar!
3241;But this movie surprised me.
3242;This one is about a lamb who gets sheared every year but manages to keep his chin up with the advice of a Jack.
3243;There is also the new Star Wars Episode III trailer at the beginning.
3244;Story, action, animation, everything was terrific.
3245;One of the best animated flicks made to date.
3246;The movie, as you can read in all the thorough reviews, was excellent.
3247;i found most of the extra features to be rather boring.
3248;but the movie is excellent.
3249;"The Incredibles are one of my favorite Disney Pixar animated films, and I don't know if it is because of Craig T. Nelson from ""Coach"" and his chemistry with Holly Hunter and Samuel L. Jackson or Skippy here, ""Who is not affiliated with me!"""
3250;Besides his incredible obesity developed after 15 years of undercover work and listening to the police scanners just made the film great.
3251;When the mad inventor Syndrome (Jason Lee) seeks revenge on Mr. Incredible and other superheroes, this amazing family unites to save the day.
3252;Its clever storyline is certainly amusing.
3253;The Incredibles contains some great humor, enormous excitement, stunning CG animation and memorable characters like eccentric fashion designer Edna Mode.
3254;animated film also features the voice talents of Samuel L. Jackson as super cool hero Frozone.
3255;disney continues to deliver first.
3256;sharp video transfer with rich detailed colors and flawless sharpness.
3257;eX sound is truly excellent.
3258;Among special features, this fully.
3259;"loaded edition includes two audio commentaries with director Brad Bird and production crew, several deleted scenes, an alternate opening, fun outtakes, an informative ""Making of The Incredibles"" featurette and the amusing ""Jack."
3260;Overall 'The Incredibles' is a really good movie.
3261;it is human character based and has a true action storyline.
3262;As with most of Pixar movies, the CG is pretty good and the casting is well above average.
3263;Holly Hunter was perfect for Elastigirl.
3264;But Craig T. Nelson, Sarah Vowel and Wallace Shawn do very good jobs too.
3265;but the story is the driving feature that would make for a great live action movie .
3266;The CG makes it more on par with something like a James Bond/Raiders of the Lost Ark adventure.
3267;Even the music is very Bond.
3268;It definitely got better as the movie went along.
3269;As always, there are elements for both younger and older audiences.
3270;I'm sure you've heard this is a great movie .
3271;The storyline is great, characters are wonderful, comedic timing is perfect .
3272;rating, which means the action and storyline is more exciting than something you'd find in a G. rated movie.
3273;"depth footage of actually animating the film, whereas this is more of how the film was ""produced"" and ""managed""."
3274;this is something worth owning.
3275;Finally, a kid friendly movie with enough adult tongue in cheek to keep one interested.
3276;Fun show with memorable catch phrases.
3277;Craig T. Nelson was a blast, Samuel Jackson was clearly charged up, Holly Hunter shows her funny side, and creator Brad Bird is terrific as Edna.
3278;The visuals are typically stunning, groundbreaking work from Pixar.
3279;The glossy '50s era sensibilities mixed with modern is just perfect for computer generated films.
3280;Pixar, better than anyone, seems to develop stories that just suit the form.
3281;remember how perfect TOY STORY seemed?!
3282;I haven't watched every single one yet, but just the few I've seen were worth numerous laughs.
3283;And BOUNDIN', the delightful short that played prior to the movie during its theatrical release is a joy, particularly for youngsters.
3284;It's the kind of little film that just lifts your spirits right away.
3285;"The cartoon you can ""enjoy"" on its own."
3286;Other bits are fun too, and I'm sure the making of featurette will be of interest.
3287;But you really should have this delightful movie and its delightful supplements in your collection.
3288;marvelously entertaining from start to finish, it's full of delightful laughter, great action, and really awesome animation!
3289;i fully recommend it for you wether you are alone, or have a family.
3290;it's a wonderful entertainment that's watchable over and over again.
3291;bravos to pixar and disney for coming forth with with one of the truly best pictures of the year!
3292;it is in fact, one of those movies that adults will enjoy as much as the kids.
3293;My kids Love the video thanks you very much hope to do business with you again.
3294;He and his wife, the former Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), have moved to the suburbs and are trying to raise their family.
3295;Until, that is, he receives a secret message saying that his powers are needed.
3296;it's a fun movie, the kind of thing you expect from Pixar.
3297;lots of action, witty dialogue, visual gags, a good time to be had by all.
3298;But then, go and read the trivia page over at IMDB and marvel at the number of in.
3299;I have watched this cartoon movie 3.4 times in my life and still love it each time.
3300;"Unlike other superhero movies, the heros in this story are primarily from the same family
3301;It also sticks fairly close to a storyline that is easy to follow and is entertaining.
3302;I absolutely loved THE IRON GIANT, but while Brad Bird certainly has done well in making animated films, Miyazaki still is widely regarded as the greatest feature length animator of all time.
3303;Beware of friends bringing you advice!
3304;I still love them all, but after having seen this my question is: What were they thinking of?
3305;This was just a super, super film, taking a variety of established genres and taking them to the next level.
3306;The story in this film is not bad, but where it excels is in the creation and delineation of great characters.
3307;I thought the way the individual characters were """"drawn"""" was particularly inspired, from Bob with his miniscule legs and gargantuan torso, to the ultra."""
3308;And the voice acting was great!
3309;Too often actors who are not particularly well suited for particular roles are cast in animated films, but the casting here was absolutely inspired.
3310;It is no surprise that Holly Hunter did the same for Helen, but their choosing Sarah Vowell (best known for her history.
3311;She has a spectacularly unique voice, and was perfect for making Violet seem believable.
3312;Samuel L. Jackson is great as Frozone, but that is a given.
3313;the score was way above average for this kind of film, and obviously a great deal of trouble was taken over it.
3314;Michael Giacchino's work is familiar to anyone who has seen ALIAS or LOST, but while on those shows he works largely a la Mark Snow almost entirely with synthesizers, for THE INCREDIBLES he went with a big, brassy jazz orchestra, and this really gives the whole production a James Bond kind of sound.
3315;i really recommend this one in a big way.
3316;And it taught me a lesson: you can't always count on your friends in matters of taste.
3317;Made by Disney in Assocation with Pixar Films comes an incredible (pardon the pun) moviewith Mr. Incredible (extra strong man) and his wife (elastic woman) and the kid (who runs asfast as the flash) and their daughter who's invisible and can project force fields (hhhmmmm sound familiar??)
3318;I give this movie two big thumbs up!
3319;My son really likes this movie and has watched it many times.
3320;I think it it pretty cool myself.
3321;It also arrived fast and in great condition.
3322;It was a great movie.
3323;"It presents the family like we persieve it:the father is the one we so much depend upon
3324;It is great to watch this movie again.
3325;What a great lesson on good and evil.
3326;My girls and I loved this movie and watched it over and over again.
3327;It has action and a wonderful story line.
3328;What a great concept for a movie.
3329;Some of the characters are unforgettable (top of that list is the costume designer).
3330;There's no doubt that this is a very good movie for the entire family.
3331;Then one day, one of my monitors was not connected and I decided to watch a Disney Digital film and it played.
3332;If you have Disney digital movies on your computer and you have a dual.
3333;as the movie opens, we see the family in full fighting regalia, battling criminals, rescuing the innocent, and earning accolades from the city's grateful citizenry.
3334;When Paul finds himself in a spot from which even the great Mr. Incredible is not able to extricate himself, it's Helen and the kiddies to the rescue and the adventure really begins.
3335;ranging and eclectic as it is in, say, the """"Toy Story"""" or """"Shrek"""" movies, the film still manages to generate a goodly number of laughs, primarily through the clever domestication of its superhero figures."""
3336;But, rest assured, the time.
3337;honored themes of family unity and being true to oneself get plenty of play as well.
3338;there's first rate voiceover work from Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter and Wallace Shawn et.
3339;But that deficiency is more than made up for in the beautifully streamlined, high.
3340;tech look of the film which seems both state.
3341;"The Incredibles is a little less ingenious than the ""Shrek"" movies, but it has a beauty and charm all its own."
3342;Fantastic animation, characters and story.
3343;One of my favorite Pixar films The Incredibles does a fun job of portraying a family of superhero's.
3344;Great movie for the kiddos.
3345;I even love watching it with them.
3346;I really enjoyed the character interviews as well as the bloopers.
3347;Incredibles works on so many levels .
3348;it's both an adventure and a parody of adventures, with Pixar's famed animation being capable of seamlessly jumping from one extreme to the other, and bringing out the high.
3349;spirited comic novel has found its way into a fim that is completely unlike it in tone.
3350;aniamted world, this is a story that can pick and choose when it will thrill or just go for the easy laugh.
3351;This just an excellent, fun, entertaining movie.
3352;Man, I hope they do another one.
3353;This is the way animated superheroes should be done.
3354;Action packed, interesting, good story with characters you can relate to.
3355;i've seen it a number of times and it really holds up to repeated viewings.
3356;I really enjoyed this movie.
3357;Pixar time and time again puts forth animated feature films that are more than a quick gag.
3358;There's something to entertain at every age level and keep you wanting to see it again and again with your family or alone by yourself.
3359;My son had his friends over and really wanted to watch this one.
3360;as an avid animation fan, I humbly thank Pixar for this masterful work.
3361;Awesome and fun and INCREDIBLE movie to watch with your kids and grandchildren.
3362;They loved and we watched it a couple times in a row.
3363;This is such a fun family movie.
3364;jack at the end when he gets his powers!
3365;my family loves this film and we will watch it again, but next time we will forward past the ending scene with Syndrome and Jack.
3366;Her tears and sleepless nights caused me to mark this down.
3367;:( Great film, I would just recommend keeping the remote handy, and paying attention to your children's faces.
3368;This is an awesome family movie that we will probably watch multiple times overt the coming years.
3369;Enough action to appease thrill seekers, family oriented for feel good viewers, good laughs and a happy ending!
3370;If you answered yes drop everything and go see this movie now.
3371;Everything you've ever loved about superheroes is addressed in this film, from secret identities to the danger of wearing a cape.
3372;Add to the mix an amazingly complex family drama and you have the absolute best film of the year.
3373;of course events unfold to bring all of the Incredibles super powers to light, and for this to occur you need to introduce the mad genius villain, Syndrome (Jason Lee).
3374;A former superhero fan with an enormous chip on his shoulder Syndrome is like every James Bond baddie rolled into one.
3375;His gadgets are unique, insanely cool, and above all extremely deadly.
3376;The action sequences are positively synapse blowing.
3377;The script is Oscar worthy in its ability to seamlessly weave domestic drama and comic book daring.
3378;i can't imagine this film not being successful but I hope it destroys box office records and mends the wound that has Pixar and Disney going their separate ways.
3379;"This movie could possibly be my favorite movie of all time and it's difficult to top Star Wars 
3380;The action is great and fast paced, it has a very good plot and as funny as it may sound the characters are believable and enjoyable.
3381;Shrek 2 is the sequel to the 2001 blockbuster.
3382;Along the way Shrek meets a pint sized hit man, Puss in Boots which is the best addition to the series.
3383;The characters are more likable since we have come to know them since their arrival, and the story (even though it is basically the same as the original) works better the second time around.
3384;shrek 2 is charming and visually pleasing.
3385;It will be a children's movie that will be remembered, and the characters of Shrek will continue to be pop culture icons of the 21st Century.
3386;I recommend this to any fan of the series or people who enjoy the genre or parodies in general.
3387;Nice family movie to watch.
3388;Would recommend this to anyone with lots of kids who like action.
3389;Oh my GOD, this is the funniest freaking cartoon ever!
3390;Must see the funny little fashion designer lady, she is so hilarious.
3391;The Incredibles would have to be one of the best movies I've ever seen.
3392;bob Parr aka Mr. Incredible is one of the greatest super heroes around.
3393;He saves lives, stops burglaries and is an all.
3394;But one day he gets sued for saving someone's life.
3395;out of all the characters Dash would have to be my favorite character because some of the things he said just cracked me up and he has a very cool power, super speed is definitely a power that I would want.
3396;the animation in the film is top class but we can't really expect any less from the crew at Pixar who is easily the best at making animation movies.
3397;having said that, I found The Incredibles to be quite entertaining.
3398;The """"good guys"""" had flaws, and the """"bad guy"""" had a good back."""
3399;I bought this movie for my husband!
3400;While on vacation we had a chance to see it because my daughter brought it to the cabin.
3401;"Also funny is the shorts ""Jack."
3402;The animation in this film is so fine.
3403;It is an incredible movie with many fun things for all ages.
3404;I gave this as a gift and the recipient loves it.
3405;Good story, exceptional animation and very entertaining according to him.
3406;This is the best Pixar movie in my opinion and I have probably watched it over 10 times and Im in my 20's!
3407;"Great for the whole family 
3408;Great action movie for this kids.
3409;My son loves this movie.
3410;I recommend for any child or family.
3411;Most of us have high expectations for Pixar studios after the amazing movies they have given us.
3412;The Incredibles is literally one of my favorite films.
3413;It has action, adventure, humour, good themes, good characters.
3414;It is a superhero story, but the super heroes are believable as human characters.
3415;The family theme running through it resonates with me, as does the whole blending in vs. being extraordinary thing.
3416;It is a great film to watch with friends, family or strangers.
3417;I have a little boy and now I have the chance to enjoy this type of movies.
3418;The incredibles has a plot, and the graphics are amazing!My son loved it ( and so did it)
3419;I am very happy with the disc.
3420;The movie was such big fun for kids and adults!
3421;It is great for family movie night.
3422;it is one of those movies that never gets old, good action and humor.
3423;Great movie for the kids and the adults.
3424;Great action packed kids movie, perfect for my son's iPad during car rides.
3425;A must if you have kids!
3426;It has lots of action and also very funny.
3427;My 3 year old loves it and always requests to watch it!
3428;well, while their jobs may be normal, their children are not.
3429;Violet has invisibility and force field capability, and Dash had super speed powers.
3430;the Incredibles is not just a kid's movie, it's great for the entire family.
3431;I thought at first it would be too tame and too lame to watch, but I was delightfully surprised to discover how captivating and well done the movie is.
3432;Don't be afraid to pick it up and watch it, the humor is sharp and witty and the plot is clever and absorbing.
3433;Highly entertaining with a hilarious ending, The Incredibles is a movie everyone can love.
3434;Pixar always comes up with creative and unique themes.
3435;Incredibles may be their best movie to date.
3436;There's something for every age, and it's clever, charming, touching.
3437;There was so much detail I want to see it again and again.
3438;i'm a fan of the James Bond adventures and comic book heros, and this movie takes plenty of ammunition from these, while adding new ideas to each.
3439;It's the kind of movie that sets you up, wanting more.
3440;One of my favorite movies.
3441;Good for kids and adults.
3442;This is one of my favorite Pixar movies of all time.
3443;I keep hoping they will come up with a sequel one day.
3444;Its a shame cause it sounds great looks great works well except the face plate screen not working.
3445;Brad Bird's """"The Incredibles"""" serves up additional proof (as if any was needed) that the good folks at Pixar are the most consistent filmmaking team in the business."""
3446;"the plot of ""The Incredibles"" is well."
3447;a family of superheroes are denied the right to exercise their talents by our litigious society .
3448;"the ""supers'"" fall from grace is the subject of a wonderful opening sequence."
3449;one of the strongest themes of the movie is the undeniable power of a person's need to achieve their full potential.
3450;Allied with old chum Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), the Incredibles put up a tremendous fight against Syndrome and his colossus .
3451;a delight for fans of all ages.
3452;Most kids will absolutely adore this movie, of course, as will most adults.
3453;"two animated shorts, ""Boundin',"" which is an enchanting poem about a vain sheep and a wise jackalope, as well as a snippet of a parallel story from the movie involving a hilarious babysitter are sure to delight."
3454;"cartoon featuring Mr. Incredible and Frozone in more ""primitive"" times, and this extra is even more enjoyable when the commentary track is employed."
3455;well thought out storyline, Great Characters, great entertainment.
3456;The animation is incredible .
3457;great for adults and kids.
3458;This is one of those rare stories that can be enjoyed from an adult or a child's perspective.
3459;"I keep hoping (and, believe me, this is rare) that a second one will be produced
3460;My grand niece and nephew added this to their wish list.
3461;I do enjoy watching it with him.
3462;I believe """"The Incredibles"""" deserves at least four stars."""
3463;This movie is funny, creative, and sends a powerful message not only about the importance of family bonds but also about the importance of developing one's individual talents.
3464;after years of serving the world, the Supers (people with extraordinary powers) are hounded by the public and become subjects of various law suits.
3465;His wife is the former Elastigirl, and their kids, as it turns out, were born with powers that they have to suppress to fit in with their more average classmates.
3466;Every time you view it you see something new.
3467;The Incredibles is a computer animated film by Pixar about a retired super hero family living normal lives.
3468;They have a family together with 3 kids, all with their own special abilities.
3469;She is one of the few who knows that he is a super.
3470;He gladly accepts the challenge from Mirage and thinks of this as an opportunity to enjoy life and become a super again.
3471;He successfully accomplishes this difficult task and then continues on accepting more missions that Mirage offers him.
3472;furthermore, at the end of the film Mr. Incredible has his super suit on under his regular attire.
3473;This new enemy arises at the end of the film and Mr. Incredible and his family are prepared with their masks and suits on ready to take on whoever is there to disturb the peace.
3474;this is a great film so watch it for yourself if you have not seen it already.
3475;It is bound to be the best computer animated film you will ever watch.
3476;And bring your family, they'll enjoy it too.
3477;easily one of the most genuine CG animated films ever made!
3478;From the incredible vocal performances by Craig T. Nelson(Mr. incredible)and Samuel L. Jackson(Frozone)to the ingenius animation by Pixar Studios,you know you are in for a fantastic adventure with.
3479;bob is enjoyed,until he finds out that he is actually testing out a robot that a villian named Sydrome(Jason Lee)is using to destroy the city,kill all the supers,and then try to look like a hero by trying to stop the robot himself.
3480;just me,this is one incredible motion picture that will become a classic in the next couple of years!
3481;I must confess i loved this movie, it is very well conceived.
3482;The computer animation is amazing and the dialogue is very funny.
3483;I laughed my a** off at the Edith Head character, it was genius to channel her for this movie, she was the beginning and the end for movie fashion in her time.
3484;This movie represents one of the rare instances when adults will enjoy a kids movie at least as much if not more than the children it is intended for.
3485;Highly recommended on so many levels.
3486;Great adult and kid humor without overuse of innuendos and double entendres.
3487;Characters were each funny in very real people ways.
3488;the film's production values are topnotch.
3489;The CGI is slick yet life.
3490;like, and the imagination behind some of the superheroic ruses is uncanny.
3491;the humor is sharp even when it flirts with comic book conventions without insulting them.
3492;There's a funny montage of superhero mishaps that illustrate her point.
3493;busting, heartwarming tale, as perfect a family film as any in the last decade.
3494;Great price, movie and worth having on hand for children to watch with their family!
3495;Pixar's The Incredibles looked so good in the trailer I anxiously looked forward to going to the theatre to see it on the big screen.
3496;"Having seen the movie on my 12.1""computer screen, The Incredibles is the best superhero movie ever made period."
3497;It deserved the Oscar it won for best animated feature.
3498;His original story about superheroes has a huge heart and soul that will put a smile on your face.
3499;In every frame you can feel his passion and enthusiasm towards telling the story of Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible, a man who just wants to help people.
3500;Both of those events will have a major impact on his future.
3501;The suicide jumper sues Mr. Incredible and wins.
3502;I love the scenes in the burning building and in the jewelry store!Bob's passion for helping people is his greatest strength and his Achilles heel.
3503;The kids stow away and that's when the movie really starts getting good.
3504;girl is on the movie the thrilling action sequences on Syndrome's island builds into a bigger more intense one until the end of the movie.
3505;"the art design captures the iconic qualities of the classic superhero costume and the era of the 1960's where the ""silver age"" of comics started."
3506;Keeping things simple costume wise makes you focus on the characters' faces where most of the action truly is.
3507;the computer animation is the best I've seen in a movie.
3508;Facial expressions and movements not only look real, they feel real.
3509;These computer generated characters showed more emotion in their faces than the actors in most real movies today.
3510;The island environments look so real you want to step out on the beach!
3511;The entire staff of Pixar should give themselves a big round of applause.
3512;the voice over acting here is actually better than the real acting in most feature films.
3513;Craig T. Nelson gives a great voice over performance as the confident Mr. Incredible.
3514;Holly Hunter is solid as the stretched out mom, Elasti.
3515;Sarah Vowell captures Violet's shyness perfectly.
3516;"The commentary and ""making of"" feature shows you how passionate everyone was during the creation of this film I love the cheesy Mr. Incredible cartoon on Disc 2."
3517;It's even funnier with the over.
3518;the top commentary from Mr. I and Frozone.
3519;Boundin' is a great stand alone film.
3520;The Violet essay is interesting.
3521;After experiencing a year of numerous live.
3522;"It just needs someone passionate like Brad Bird with an ""incredible"" amount of heart to tell the story onscreen."
3523;If you've got kids in the house you'll be playing this one so much you'll definitely go through a couple of machines!
3524;good animation movie and sound effects character animation also is good but my personal opinion story is not good and not a amazing animation it's overall ok
3525;This movie is really good I don't think it's better than finding nemo.
3526;"If you like action, suspense, humor, great effects, wonderful characters and an outstanding story
3527;we have a very evil villian and an adorable baby who is full of surprises.
3528;top movie and one that the entire family will enjoy watching together.
3529;My kids are young( both under two) but this is one of my favorite movies, and I'm an adult!
3530;So a young chap wants to be a hero and save the world, but is always shunned away by Mr. Incredible.
3531;This is such a great movie.
3532;Pixar did an amazing job creating this one.
3533;Great show especially for kids.
3534;funny movie, all ages can view it.
3535;Disney consistently puts out movies for all agesClean good fun without the sex and murder that others are putting out there.
3536;There's a little too much violence and teasing for my taste, but on the whole, a film the whole family can enjoy.
3537;Fun movie for the kids.
3538;All, the extra footage made it even more valuable to me.
3539;Pixar made a great movie with this release and I'm so glad to now have it in my collection.
3540;The Incredibles is one of the best superhero movies ever made.
3541;It has so many excellent scenes, and excellent moments, that I can watch it over again and again, and enjoy it each and every time!
3542;This is well worth getting, especially if you can pick it up cheap.
3543;the film itself is great for people of all ages.
3544;hand will love the superhero fights and the exciting set.
3545;i haven't watched the extras yet but they look interesting and combined with the main film will give you hours and hours of entertainment.
3546;The plot and characterization are actually interesting and adults will find the movie at least somewhat fun and entertaining.
3547;Kids loved to watch this movie on Christmas Day such a great adventure!!!
3548;Another in the long line of excellent Pixar/Disney Animation projects that began with Toy Story.
3549;This one directed by Brad Bird who also did the excellent """"Iron Giant""""."""
3550;The Incredibles is an excellent story of a family gifted with Super Powers who much adjust to a world where their gifts must be hidden.
3551;When he finds he's working for the forces of evil he's captured and must be rescued by his super powered family.
3552;I liked the movie, especially the brand of humor, but somehow it was not as good as I thought it would be.
3553;"I know it's ""just a cartoon"", but it's still a feature length film and as this form of entertainment comes more into its own, more will be expected of it."
3554;I love this movie, my 2 year old is not impressed.
3555;It does have scary moments.
3556;It does have great animation from the Emeryville, California based studio.
3557;by using some well known superheroes.
3558;But it's still a very entertaining film that's well worth owning.
3559;The Incredibles has a fun story concept and great execution.
3560;The characters are strong and well.
3561;It's fun for kids, and adults will enjoy it even more.
3562;Highly recommended!I love the dialog between Frozone and his wife that start with Where is my super suit?
3563;This is a fun family movie that will appeal to many ages.
3564;I enjoyed some references to other superhero movies.
3565;After a slew of lawsuits from people who didn't ask to be saved though, these brave men and women with amazing gifts are asked to leave behind their 'super hero life' and adjust to living a 'normal' life instead.
3566;the characters in this movie come alive.
3567;I laughed out loud at Karli and Enda (NO CAPES!)
3568;and laughed at Dash tricking his teacher with a tack.
3569;there are a few scenes that I think would scare kids but other than that, this movie is entertaining, well done and fun to watch.
3570;This is one of the few movies I can watch repeatedly.
3571;It contains humor and amusing pop culture references to entertain kid and adult audiences, and the retro animation style is great.
3572;age is so funny and familiar.
3573;The writing is consistently very smart and the voice.
3574;Mr. Incredible is now working in insurance while his wife Helen (Elastigirl) stays home with the kids.
3575;There are three children: Dash who can run faster than the speed of light, Violet who can make herself invisible and create forcefields, and Jack.
3576;He slumps at his desk knowing he was meant to be doing something more meaningful.
3577;This is what makes this movie so great.
3578;robert and Lucius aka Frozone try to relive the glory days through a police scanner, and this leads to a job for Mr. Incredible, which he does succesfully, after which Robert becomes a much better husband and father (another very human characteristic, when we are happy with our work, we are happy with other parts of our lives as well).
3579;All of this leads to a confrontation with a boy that Mr. Incredible shunned when he was still a superhero, and some really great visual action ensues, and all of the players get involved.
3580;This movie was made for adults and comic book geeks as it contains many references to superheroes and comic book movies.
3581;It is truly fun for the whole family.
3582;my son DEMANDED to see it again.
3583;But, Amazon saved the day and I was able to click and stream for my son to watch the movie again!
3584;One of my favorite movies (even though i was an adult when it came out) and bought it now so my kids can enjoy it as well.
3585;When Mr. Incredible gets the opportunity to be a superhero again, he jumps at the chance.
3586;Now, it's up to the Incredibles to save him from the terrible Buddy PineI enjoyed this movie a lot because it is very humorous, and some parts were absolutely hilarious.
3587;One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, animated or not.
3588;Yes one of those times I was home alone!
3589;I enjoyed this movie when it first came out and I have always wanted to get my hands on a copy for my own collection.
3590;I was delighted that it was such great condition and it had shipped within a reasonable amount of time.
3591;Everyone should already know that this is one of the best animated movies out there.
3592;I love Happy Feet also, but i think it comes in second to the Incredibles because the Incredibles isnt as long as Happy Feet so children of all ages will love it without getting sleepy near to the end.
3593;Adults will absolutely love this movie too because the jokes are made to entertain people of all ages.
3594;The Incredibles is the best kid's movie ever.
3595;My boys watch it every day and it is such a great movie that I don't mind.
3596;I am amazed at how many people thought this was a great movie.
3597;My kids liked it, but every adult I spoke with thought this movie bombed.
3598;Those were a delight to young and old alike.
3599;I love Amazon Instant video and this is a great one to add to the collection.
3600;Highly recommended for children of all ages.
3601;My first experience with this movie floored me.
3602;dazzle is a well, conceived, sensitively written story that has family values at its heart.
3603;Mr. I joins the chase, and a pleasing mix of action and hilarity ensues.
3604;Flash forward ten years, and our hero, his wife Helen (Holly Hunter, another nice voice performance), and their three kids are trying to live normal lives.
3605;the visual look of this movie is heavily stylized, reflecting what Bird calls 'a vision of the future looking ahead from the 60's.'
3606;Michael Giacchino's score puts a great retro spin on the whole story, adding hot jazz riffs to some wonderful orchestral colors.
3607;The cast and animators manage to evoke some real emotion throughout.
3608;This is a slick superhero tale, but with heart and depth of feeling.
3609;For my money, this is easily as good as, and in most cases better than, most so. called super hero films.
3610;I've said it before, and I'll say it again: The best stuff on television and in film nowadays comes in animated form.
3611;"While it borrows heavily in atmosphere from James Bond and other 60s spy movies (as well as ""The Return of the Jedi"" and other sci."
3612;"fi action flicks), ""The Incredibles"" is a rollicking good time in its own right . . . and is a better James Bond movie than any produced in the past 20 years."
3613;"but ""The Incredibles"" pulsates with such energy and imagination that it's easy to overlook its faults."
3614;"The computer animation in ""The Incredibles"" is solid, and the images and score manage to evoke Bonds like ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""The Man with the Golden Gun,"" as well as productions like ""Forbidden Planet,"" ""Johnny Quest,"" and even the Walt Disney spaceflight shows."
3615;True, there is some surprising violence, and this is another vehicle aimed at children that seems to want to teach them that only white people and the occasional black sidekick (here Samuel L. Jackson instead of Eddie Murphy or Chris Tucker) exist in the world, but it's a fun ride.
3616;I do hope those responsible produce a sequel, if one with a bit more diversity.
3617;It must be heartbreaking to cut scenes into which the film makers have poured so much love and effort, both of which are evident here.
3618;The silliness is great, but when they get into territory that ought to move us .
3619;and they do appear to be trying to move us, the feeling is one of detachment.
3620;the other reviewers have done a wonderful job of hailing the film's many strengths.
3621;is it possible to get a humble, brown hair and dark eyed hero in a starring role?
3622;This is one of the best animated films I've ever seen.
3623;The transfer is marvelous, and it's great to be able to stop and see things that were going by too fast when playing at full speed.
3624;The making of stuff, the alternate sequences that got storyboarded, the two shorts that are new for the disc, it's all great.
3625;i enjoyed everything on both discs, and will watch them both again and again.
3626;This is one of my favorite movies ever, but this review is supposed to be about the Blu.
3627;ray (you can read reviews about the movie anywhere), so here's the deal: It's a great package.
3628;This is a great value for the money.
3629;The Incredibles is easily the best movie to come out of this year or any other year for that matter.
3630;The animation is top notch.
3631;The voice casting is perfect.
3632;And the humor comes fast and furious.
3633;Pixar is outdone itself once again.
3634;Do yourself a favor and see this film.
3635;There is nothing like a Pixar/Disney movie for Blu Ray It looks so good!
3636;As a kid I loved to read comic books, mostly from Marvel and DC Comics.
3637;I noticed a lot of reviewers accusing Pixar of plagiarism.
3638;There are just so many types of super powers to go around.
3639;All in all, it was one great film.
3640;"Take it from someone who has been reading comics to one degree or another for almost 50 years, this movie brings back the awe and emotions that are the ""drug"" for comic readers."
3641;an aditional plus is the internal conflicts that make the Parrs seem like a real family, with all of their conflicts .
3642;only to discover, finally, that family is the most important adventure.
3643;century aesthetic, with more entertaining characters to boot.
3644;My favorite Pixar film by far!
3645;That said, each one is highly anticipated and almost guarantees success at the box office.
3646;It's the most popular genre.
3647;Christopher Nolan elevated the genre to a new level with Batman Begins and the hugely popular Dark Knight.
3648;He also makes it seem possible that they can do what they do.
3649;the Incredibles uses a similar technique and puts the characters in today's world.
3650;Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl marry and have three children.
3651;Violet can become invisible and make force shields, while her brother, Dash, runs at an incredible speed.
3652;He succeeds, but almost dies in the process.
3653;the movie is full of invention.
3654;The family members are particularly good at combining their skills and there's a lot of humor in the film.
3655;Some of it is quite subtle and best appreciated by adults, but there's plenty for the kids too.
3656;packed story filled with explosions and battles.
3657;the conclusion is satisfying and paves the way for a sequel should Pixar ever decide to make one.
3658;This is a movie that has the potential to appeal to viewers of any age and it's a lot of fun.
3659;expires Aug. 7)Disney titles look wonderful on Blu.
3660;The studio pulls out all the stops once again to deliver a package that any fan of the movie will be delighted with.
3661;"With movies like Shrek and Shark's Tale, Hollywood's goal with animated movies lately seems to be how far filmmakers can push the envelope in terms of weaving adult humor and sexuality into ""family"" films."
3662;I'm pleased to report that (as another reviewer likewise mentioned) this film restored my faith in family animated films.
3663;everything about this film was well done.
3664;The plot, the music, the art direction, the animation, the casting of Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, and Samuel L. Jackson, and of course the acting.
3665;Nobody in the family seems truly happy and Mr. Incredible trudges off to work each day in a funk.
3666;the GOOD:1) The plot is genuinely fun and wholesome as a fragmented family learns to love and appreciate one another again while working as a team.2) The artwork is absolutely fabulous .
3667;it has a 60s James Bond feel to it that I loved.
3668;It perfectly complemented the visual aspect of the movie.
3669;I have a decent home theater system and the movie sounds superb .
3670;both music and sound effects.4) The language was wholesome throughout .
3671;There was plenty of visual and verbal humor here .
3672;outstanding writing.5) The animation iself was absolutely superb.
3673;The music, acting, script, and production values all contribute to a first.
3674;The voices matched the characters perfectly.
3675;I particularly liked the disaffected teen voice of Violet and the guy who did Syndrome.
3676;Both are unknowns but were perfect for the parts.
3677;Nelson, Hunter, and Jackson are perfect as well.
3678;jack, and Syndrome all look similar to one another.
3679;He perfectly nails the snobbish, cultured elite fashionista thing.
3680;In my opinion, The Incredibles is even better and is their best effort to date.
3681;jack when they leave him with a babysitter and he displays his budding superpowers.
3682;It has to be one of the best family films ever produced .
3683;I enjoy watching it every 6 months or so.
3684;If you've never seen the movie, watch it.
3685;If you are like 99.999% of the population, you'll love it too.
3686;I came to this film with many doubts .
3687;i loved Marvel comics as a youngster and this movie was full of the kind of wonderful superhero imagery I'd loved so much, but presented in such a sophisticated way that at no point did it feel 'beneath' me.
3688;The animation was superb .
3689;So what made it so good?
3690;"The characters 'acted', they weren't just cartoon people going through the motions
3691;super hero stunts, etc .
3692;were inventive, never predictable"
3693;This is a movie that has obviously been crafted with immense love, dedication, and patience, culminating in a creation that truly deserves all the accolades it has received since its release.
3694;this is the best movie I've seen this year, possibly even for a couple of years.
3695;the animation is a work of art and is going to be enjoyed for a long time in the history of animated films.
3696;"Unlike other animation films that gradually fade away from memory ""The Incredibles"" is one that is still worthy of being watched even after so many others have been released after its release."
3697;It has plenty of fantastic action.
3698;The most amazing concept is this movie is in its similarity to real life situations (hero.
3699;best Animated film of the year Oscar was a deserving award for the movie.
3700;"Great work from Brad Bird and eagerly awaiting his next titled ""Ratatouille""."
3701;This is the best movie I have ever seen.
3702;It animated my soul, my love life, and my spirits.
3703;The delightful and refreshing The Incredibles blends both together for me .
3704;I have, however, seen every Pixar film and loved them all.
3705;they've got zip on Pixar!Getting back to my review of this film, all I can say is The Incredibles is a winner on all levels.
3706;Animation is top notch (increasingly better with each film), voice acting (and the casting selection) is superb, cinematography (even though it's digital) is exceptional, and the score (especially with The Incredibles) is a perfect fit.
3707;the premise is a fitting portrait of today's world.
3708;just sit back and delight in the masterfully crafted film by Brad Bird (The Iron Giant) known as The Incredibles.
3709;The visuals and story is captivating and well written.
3710;I loved this movie and so did my daughter.
3711;Its was funny, family friendly and madr you feel good.
3712;This is my kids favorite movie, it keeps them very entertained no matter how many times they've seen it.
3713;There is lying in the movie and so I address it every time it comes up so that the kids know its not okay to lie.
3714;They love this movie, it never gets old for them.
3715;Sure, they get best animated film every once in a while, but each new release by this outfit is truly a timeless gem.
3716;the Incredibles is the quintessential Pixar film: tight, entertaining plot, beautiful animation, great characters, and a moral of the story that many pictures don't have these days (especially films by Pixar's main competition Dreamworks Animation).
3717;When I heard there was a director for this picture, I thought it was odd, but when you see it come together as a work of art and you compare it to other, less.
3718;polished films, you know why.
3719;not only should this have won best picture of the year, it should be recognized as one of the best pictures of all time.
3720;It such an amazing movie that I had to watch for a confirmation project, and it really does have a deeper meaning.
3721;I can watch this movie with my kids and have a wonderful time.
3722;It one of the movies I would recommend to my friends with kids.
3723;The animation and effects are stunning, the plot is fresh, and this is a great movie overall.
3724;My 3 and 5 year old kids love it .
3725;Definitely my favorite recent animated film .
3726;I love a great story line and this movie had it all!
3727;Foreshadowing made the viewing especially entertaining for me because nothing was just for the viewing!
3728;The whole thing was a big love.
3729;It did not fool me but it probably will you.
3730;hero movie that I had my son watch.
3731;He loved it and it was fun to see him so excited.
3732;Great intro movie for a little boy into the world of super.
3733;My son loves Dash and has adopted the movie as a result.
3734;Our family thoroughly enjoyed this on the big screen.
3735;A good movie has things that you can pick up on each time you watch the movie.
3736;This movie is so cute.
3737;A movie you got to get!
3738;Just an all around great family movie.
3739;We loved it in the theater and wanted to share it with out children.
3740;Yeah it got Animated Feature Film but it deserved both.
3741;it has the perfect combination of adult and children's humor.
3742;this is a great family movie!
3743;i really hope Pixar sequels it.
3744;I will be honest, I'm 30 and I was blew away in the theater, I was expecting that kindda comic action fun from this picture and somehow it still managed to top my expectation, its just incredible.
3745;I love the fact every member in the family really got its own characteristic, not only because they all have special talent but they all have their own personality and here is the briliant part of the director, he managed so well to line up all the elements so well so amazing and that asemble this incredibly fast pace action journey.
3746;I cant really remember when was the last time I had such satisfactory on picture that contain so much on both action and funny elements.
3747;The Incredibles is a fantastic movie!
3748;she loves it and I got a fantastic deal here on Amazon!
3749;he loves all toy story movies.
3750;he is 14 months just starting to understand and love.
3751;It's nice to be able to watch a movie with the whole family This movie is great.
3752;I have watched it with my kids many many times and still enjoy it.
3753;The story is well written and has funny parts as well as lots of action.
3754;It is one of the few movies for kids that is fun for adults too.
3755;Even my teenage daughter likes to watch it with us.
3756;The Incredibles is one of our all time favorite movies.
3757;but let's spend a bit of obligatory time talking about the technical marvel.
3758;These days, technically marvelous movies are a dime a dozen.
3759;That said, the computer graphics are wonderful given their level of detail.
3760;Simply making the characters' hair look as realistic as it does is an amazing accomplishment, considering how difficult that is with a computer.
3761;Instead, we have the realistic hair, muscles under skin that move properly, sunlight filtering through trees in the jungle, and so much more.
3762;The attention to detail really is amazing.
3763;none of it is photorealistic, however, and that actually works to this movie's advantage.
3764;"sixties look that, when combined with the heavy brass music, brings to mind a lot of the old Sean Connery ""James Bond"" flicks."
3765;"And in line with the Bond movies, ""The Incredibles"" is a first."
3766;The action alone, and the lessons the heroes learn about themselves and their powers, is more than enough to make this an enjoyable movie.
3767;"but on top of everything else, ""The Incredibles"" is also mixed with a generous helping of Woody Allen."
3768;life angst, and here is where the thematic part comes in.
3769;"If you take away the fun and the action, there is still a lot to think about, giving The Incredibles"" a whole new dimension to enjoy."
3770;This is a great movie for people who like to think and ask questions.
3771;In the manner of all the best thought.
3772;Between the themes, the issues the characters all deal with, and the action, there is a great deal of depth.
3773;The ending of the movie is really satisfying on all those levels, resolving everything for the characters without resolving everything for the viewer.
3774;This is a movie for action fans and thinkers alike.
3775;Also, there are a lot of behind.
3776;Great extras on disc 2Cons:.
3777;I loved this move when I saw it in the theaters years ago.
3778;the storyline is very simple.
3779;The Incredibles is a great family film that shouldn't be missed.
3780;this is also, and surprisingly, one of those films that you should see on the big screen and not on home video.
3781;everyone knows what a superhero is.
3782;jack, the youngest family member with powers that are, well, mixed to say the least.
3783;so Fantastic Five and a ho.
3784;hum life, with Mr. incredible yearning for the hero fighting days of old, Helen reminding him to live in and get used to the now, and breaking up the regular fighting between Violet and Dash, if they could just catch either one of them.
3785;"But, it was well worth the pay off (the film will probably be the big movie for the Xmas season right along with ""The Polar Express"")."
3786;"The Incredibles is basically, bits of the Marvel Comic ""The Fantastic Four"" with a dash of Disney, with PIXAR animation and humor."
3787;All of the characters are great and well thought.
3788;the animation is top notch with new advances that leap off the screen (especially, during the action sequences).
3789;As an adult seeing this for the first time with my kids i found it hillarious.
3790;"Give me a good rating, please!The Incredibles: Family MattersThe Incredibles
3791;This is an excellent animated flick.
3792;It keeps both of our grandkids occupied, and they ask to watch it frequently.
3793;The Incredibles is one of the best Pixar movies to date.
3794;paced action movie, with a strong family values at the core.
3795;This is a great movie that will not disappoint, and shows that having a strong family and working together is stronger than having all the superpowers in the world!
3796;This kept my 4 year old entertained.
3797;This movie, is action packed with each action sequence out.
3798;shining the last, also filled with some humor, and creativity!!!
3799;in this action packed adventure, that is a combination of the """"Fantastic Four"""", """"James Bond"""", """"Indiana Jones"""", all combined into this masterpiece!!!"""
3800;It is actually hard to believe Disney and Pixar were able to make something this good!!!
3801;Their children: Dash with super speed, and Violet with powers and invisiblity and creting force fields,.
3802;This is cinametic gold along with hours of great material, and eye candy for the whole family!!!
3803;This film will become an instant classic, and a gem in your collection.
3804;"Yet, I myself like ""The Fantastic Four"" better, nevertheless still a great film!!!"
3805;Great concept, kudos to Disney!!!
3806;In my opinion this is the very best Pixar film.
3807;For my kids they love this movie they are two and three years old .
3808;I find this to be a really great movie for the whole family.
3809;Good plot, clean fun and hope they make a sequel.
3810;Just go out and see this movie, it's really cool.
3811;If you love entertaining and highly creative movies, go and see this.
3812;If you have a pulse and breathing, you got to go and see this.
3813;Great movie, and great concept.
3814;Way to go Pixar, they have done it again.
3815;Also, Pixar does it again by providing us with some of the best characterization in Hollywood today.
3816;They understand what really drives a story forward, and they keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.
3817;Kids and adults can both enjoy it.
3818;There are a lot of jokes for adults as well.
3819;This is so good, I'll probably see it a few times in the theater.
3820;Bob spends his day behind a desk at an insurance company and Helen stays at home.
3821;He soon receives a mysterious offer and jumps at the chance to use his powers again.
3822;The Incredibles is easily one of the most appropriately named films to be made in a long time.
3823;The newest film from Pixar combines human characters with the same attention to detail that has made all of their previous films so memorable.
3824;"written and directed by Brad Bird, the director of ""The Iron Giant"", a thoroughly underrated traditionally animated film released some years ago by Warner Bros., has found the perfect home for his talents, ""The Incredibles"" represents the perfect marriage of director and studio."
3825;Bird has been working on this project for a number of years, even before he started working with Pixar.
3826;"My friend Shannon described the film to someone as a ""great action film that's animated""."
3827;It clearly shows in every frame of the film.
3828;the film deftly blends comedy, edge of your seat suspense, great visuals, bright, colorful animation and great voice acting.
3829;the scenes of the Parr family living in suburbia are truly funny.
3830;Violet and Dash are portrayed in a very realistic way.
3831;But if they have to help each other, they do and this shows that they really care about one another.
3832;"Deftly combining elements of filmed superhero movies, James Bond adventures and action films, ""The Incredibles"" creates an amazing backdrop to tell an involving, exciting story."
3833;many of the action sequences are set in buildings and landscapes clearly inspired by the James Bond films of the 60s.
3834;This provides a nice, unique and fun visual reference for the adults, to keep their attention.
3835;"the action scenes are visually stunning, especially a scene referred to as the ""100 Yard Dash""."
3836;Jack and Lucius talk about `monologueing', a trait they came across many times as Supers.
3837;all of the voice actors are spot on.
3838;"Craig T. Nelson (TV's ""Coach"") does a great job of capturing the boredom of everyman working a humdrum life and the unabashed excitement at doing something he is truly excited about."
3839;Holly Hunter is great as Helen and Elastigirl.
3840;Her lilting Southern drawl provides her character with an innocence that masks her toughness.
3841;The two child actors capture the moods and attitudes of children growing up.
3842;Jason Lee is also great as the crazed Buddy and Syndrome, the villain, perfectly capturing the glee of the more over the top villains from other films.
3843;Samuel L. Jackson's role as Lucius and Frozone is also very effective.
3844;"the animation in any Pixar film is top notch, and ""The Incredibles"" is no exception."
3845;As mentioned before, this is the first Pixar film with an all `human' cast'.
3846;The attention to detail on each of the characters is amazing.
3847;He looks good, but he looks animated.
3848;"There are many details which still appear `cartoonish', but these are intentional, for the sake of laughter
3849;His previous film """"The Iron Giant"""" is a very effective, sweet."""
3850;natured homage to the sci.
3851;The widescreen version of the film is clear, bright and colorful.
3852;Of course, since the film was created in computers, the transfer is naturally going to be more brilliant than a traditional film transfer.
3853;in the film, there is a moment in which Helen calls home to check on the babysitter watching Jack Jack, the baby.
3854;It is a funny scene.
3855;It is fun to watch the footage, but when a character, from the film, makes an appearance at the end of the short, it sort of gives away the real origin of this footage.
3856;It's a great idea to create new shorts featuring these characters, as Disney did with Roger Rabbit.
3857;the `early' animated short, with commentary by Mr. Incredible and Frozone, is interesting, but odd.
3858;The Incredibles is yet another top.
3859;notch addition to the Pixar library and yet another top.
3860;I absolutely love this movie.
3861;This was an amazing movie that I would gladly watch over and over again and not be upset if my kids asked to play it again!
3862;Its a good,albeit supersized, illustration of a family overcoming their individual problems by coming together to help one another.
3863;Kids love it, adults love it, everyone is happy.
3864;And instant is great, played perfectly on multiple devices.
3865;Really brings out the sound better on this already great movie!
3866;Now they to have a sequel movie to make me happy.
3867;This is one of my top 3 favorite animated movies of all time.
3868;I can watch it over and over again and I'm 43.
3869;Of course, my fears were unfounded as this film is genius and is perhaps my favorite of the entire Pixar catalog.
3870;Pixar films excel because they're storytellers first, animators second.
3871;the stories in Pixar films are contained, but limitless in their appeal.
3872;"In film and television, there's the concept of the ""fourth wall"" which is the viewer."
3873;aware for their own good.
3874;"Shark Tale hits you over the head with so many ""stars"" that it has to show them in ads to convince people to see the film."
3875;There is a difference between acting and just reading lines.
3876;the story draws you in, makes you engage with the film and truly brings magic back to cinema screens.
3877;"This film is fluid, but tight
3878;You forget after a while that this is animation, which is as high a compliment as animated films deserve.
3879;the Incredibles is a film that is lush with colors, swells with emotion, and scored with the right touch of relaxed swing to convey the era when superheroes captured the dreams of a generation.
3880;As a film, it puts regular features to shame with all of the elements of classic movie.
3881;Truly worthy of the Oscar presented to Brad Bird two nights ago, this film perfectly encapsulates why Pixar is the leader in the animated film industry.
3882;The film is fantasic and incredibly delightful to watch.
3883;I actually took my kid to see it , opening weekend.
3884;My son was amazed and harldy moved from his seat , as the film rolled.
3885;That in itself, speaks volumes , because he's only 22 months old.
3886;I think that one of the most amazing and impressive things about this film is that it's desined not only for kids , but for everyone.
3887;It's got that Bugs Bunny , touch.
3888;The touch that moves the kids and imagination in all of us.
3889;It not only has phenominal cgi , but """"The Incredibles"""" , has one of the best written scripts, of most of films, released this year."""
3890;I was highly impressed with the charactor breakdowns and the energetic pace, that I plan on seeing it again.
3891;The Incredibles , earns it's title and places the level of cgi entertainment, even higher , for future filmmakers.
3892;but in making entertaining and unforgettable films , altogether.
3893;Definately a film , that you'll want to catch , while it's still in theaters !!
3894;"Bottom line: "" The Incredibles"" is the best you're gonna get ."
3895;though I'm sure it has something to do with Hollywood politics.
3896;There's so much more to this film than kiddie.
3897;"human strength"" when necessary
3898;This film has something to say about the triumph of mediocrity over true greatness.
3899;an epidemic in our world, I fear.
3900;It's a film of brilliant creativity, edgy humor and abundant heart.
3901;The animation was exciting, realistic, and yet bright and exciting (pleasing both children and adults).
3902;The humor was intelligent, and multi.
3903;layered enough to please a wide age range.
3904;The plot was """"incredible"""" and fantasy."""
3905;like, yet realistic enough that if super powered people existed, we could imagine it playing out this way.
3906;the whole Syndrome character was a huge plus!
3907;His identity was the perfect surprise.
3908;Hindsight is beautiful for surprises in cinema!Bottom.
3909;line: Four stars for a solid story, well.
3910;I'm reserving my fifth star for an animated film thatincludes powerful commentary and appeals to my pre.
3911;As Syndrome said 'You have to admit this is cool!'
3912;i found out how much detail and perspective it had taken to make a movie that everybody admits is cool.
3913;the Incredibles is a fabulously fun movie, that I found creative and hilarioFor a long time, Super heroes have been asked to put down their powers due to problems with the public society or mortals, as they like to say.
3914;i found the ending a little abrupt, especially when it ended on the best part.
3915;jack really was a super hero!The Incredibles is a fun and wild movie that will send u jogging in excitement.
3916;for once, an exciting movie has finally came up!
3917;welcome to the new age of heroes, who aren't perfect!Also adding .
3918;This and Monster House are probably my two favorite kid films of all time!
3919;I have loved this movie since when I first saw it in theaters.
3920;On the surface the movie is a fun adventure story with a conflict between good and evil (good wins).
3921;When everyone is special, no one is.
3922;I think this is something we need to hear today and I'm glad Pixar had the guts to say it.
3923;The movie defines each character well (except JackJack who is after all a baby) and you believe they are real.
3924;It strikes a nice balance of dramatic and humorous, the story is well paced and the plot delightfully unexpected.
3925;I received this in perfect condition just as described and I.
3926;A timely manner as promised.
3927;An engaging, witty story with a good message about family and being true to yourself.
3928;Highly recommended for all ages!
3929;This is a funny film filled with creative unique mind blowing twists and turns.
3930;Nothing beats a Pixar film for a good laugh when you need it.
3931;I am happy with the product.
3932;The Incredibles is a fun look at heros similar to the ones we all grew up with.
3933;This is one of those movies that is so good you hope the DON'T make a sequel.
3934;A sequel would only cheapen this originally funny film.
3935;After all, there really is nothing to add to this imaginative piece of art.
3936;a famous superhero in her own right.
3937;This movie is a class act and a lot of fun to watch.
3938;Taking the best of The fatastic Four with a pinch of The Watchmen( also a dash of real life problems ), Brad Bird and company take a well known concept and fully make it their own.
3939;the audio track is amazing( English 5.1 DTS.
3940;There's also a dolby digital track for the french and spanish audio as well as a English 2.0 dvs, I briefly heard the french track out of curiosity and so far it's on par with the english one.
3941;The round table with BIrd in co was informative in that it's a frank discussion on the trials they went through putting pen/pencil to paper through being told by a disney executive that it sucks.
3942;This was my daughters favorite movie.
3943;"the film centers around Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), who is one of a group of ""supers"", heroes that live among the human populace who use their powers to save the world."
3944;Once the family are reunited it will take the ultimate team effort, including close family friend Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) to take down Syndrome and his evil plans and prove that heroism is a family affair.
3945;"this film is definitely loaded with a lot of extras for those who want it, including an exclusive animated short, ""Jack."
3946;well, I won't give it away but it links up to something that our little one does at the end of the movie.
3947;"Will ""Cars"" and ""Chicken Little"", both of which have trailers in the film and are expected to be the final 2 projects for the Disney/Pixar team, give them a perfect 8 for 8 hit streak?"
3948;I always go to watch a Pixar movie with my eyes squinted.
3949;I'll admit that I thought it drug a little bit in the middle, but by the end of the movie, I was absolutely thrilled.
3950;When the family finally started using their super powers, it became a whole new movie and I really enjoyed it.
3951;My favorite scenes were the ones where the Mom was using her powers.
3952;They were the most creative and technically amazing.
3953;A great movie that sucks you in and makes you enjoy it!
3954;I've always loved this movie.
3955;and even more now that my daughter is old enough to watch this and enjoy it with the wife and me.
3956;Probably the best animated film I've ever laid eyes upon!
3957;The graphics were amazing(especially the detail in the wet hair)!
3958;That's it, they proved it again, with this incredibly enjoyable film.
3959;It is technically superb, but the most amusing part of the film is 'The Incredibles,' the superhero/heroine family that MUST live like ordinary people.
3960;They were respected, always saving the day for the people of the town.
3961;He has now his own family, and each of them has his/her special powers though they are all forbidden to use them.
3962;but one day a message arrives: 'Mr. Incredible: You're needed.'
3963;Interesting characters, amusing humor, stylish designs, and exciting actions are all there.
3964;"But the most impressive is the film's techinical aspect
3965;the voice cast include Craig T Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson, and Jason Lee.
3966;The story gets a little conventional in the second half, but that is rather a wise choice for this kind of adventure film which is made for family viewing.
3967;Watch it, and enjoy yourself.
3968;The Incredibles is one of the best animated films ever made.
3969;The characters are compelling and the animation is absolutely out of this world!
3970;I found that I really did care about the family by the movie's end.
3971;All of the violence is very comic bookish and most children may not pick up the implications of the implied events.
3972;Still, a child with a quick mind easily could.
3973;still, this is a great movie that is entertaining for adults and older children.
3974;He's got a wonderful wife, three beautiful kids, and a nice home in the suburbs.
3975;Bob is actually a superhero: Mr. Incredible.
3976;He's fired, but a mysterious stranger offers Bob to opportunity to be Mr. Incredible again and Bob jumps at the chance.
3977;Eventually his wife, who happens to be Elastigirl, and kids come to the rescue and it's up to the Incredible family to save the world.
3978;simply put, THE INCREDIBLES are simply incredible.
3979;THE INCREDIBLES is one of the best of Pixar's hits.
3980;The voice talents perfectly cast with Craig T. Nelson voicing Mr. Incredible and Holly Hunter voicing his wife Elastigirl and Samuel L. Jackson as Increcible's best friend, Lucius Best.
3981;tHE INCREDIBLES contains a great deal of action and some mild violence.
3982;Like FINDING NEMO before it, THE INCREDIBLES is an amazing story of family love.
3983;It's also a reflection on temperance"
3984;Previous to THE INCREDIBLES, Bird was best known for the animated film, THE IRON GIANT.
3985;In the movie there are clear influences from several great action films of the past, including STAR WARS.
3986;the animated short included with the major feature is entitled BOUND.
3987;It's a story told in ballad about a proud sheep who is humbled after his first sheering, but is given a new look on life by a wise jackalope.
3988;Thank goodness there are jackalopes.
3989;overall, THE INCREDIBLES is a great family movie.
3990;I love Disney and Pixar but this has to be one of the best ones yet.
3991;I got this for my daughter as a Christmas gift.
3992;This movie gets better with age.
3993;It's my favorite Pixar movie, which puts it pretty high on my list of favorite movies overall.
3994;If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a huge favor and just watch it.
3995;They totally RIP OFF the Fantastic Four, but it is amusing.
3996;Dad has The Thing powers minus the rock thing, Mom has Mr. Fanastic powers, The Girl has The invisable girl powers, the son is the Flash, and the baby is The Human Torch with extras.
3997;So if you can get around the total super power rip off it is a good movie.
3998;The INCREDIBLES is perhaps the first animated feature that I loved as much as any of my live action favorites like SPIDERMAN, X. mEN or even LORD OF THE RINGS.
3999;the script is flawless and the characters have more depth and longevity than a Woody Allen film.
4000;It has to be one of the funniest shorts in animation history.
4001;this is one of my favorite movies of all time.
4002;This is a decent film.
4003;It has a good story line.
4004;Superheros and villains, of course the good guys win.
4005;who band together to fight a rival driven by hysterical envy appeals to you, then please just see it.
4006;just as we celebrate Walt Disney as a visionary in hand.
4007;drawn animation, I boldly predict that Pixar Studios will someday receive equal acclaim for combining computer.
4008;based animation with bold, exciting, and subversive storytelling.
4009;This latest example of their genius.
4010;But there's the rub: 'The Incredibles' is so, well, incredible that it *had* to be animated and computer use plays beautifully to its strengths (superhuman feats, wildly improbable action sets).
4011;May 'The Incredibles' inspire a rich liturgy.
4012;The movie was well done and the extras were very nice.
4013;I like the widescreen format as you get a true movie feel.
4014;i recommend the movie for the entire family.
4015;But this incredible animated film proves us wrong!
4016;Who would have thought that an animated film could be this creative, original, and just so darn good!
4017;The plot is just perfect.
4018;the characters are just superb, the animation and special effects.
4019;Check it out, its one of the best animated films ever, great for kids and adults!
4020;I think that next to the Lion King, this is an excellent cartoon movie.
4021;I bought this movie because I was able to get it cheap.
4022;When I received it a couple days later I was eager to watch the movie and wow was it good for a kids movie.
4023;My kids enjoyed every minute of it I wish they would make a sequel.
4024;The best part of the movie I think is the humor.
4025;Your always laughing because the things they do are just rediculous.
4026;This movie is a favorite in our house.
4027;The bonus features were a real treat for my husband and me as well.
4028;so, with hope, I bought the blu.
4029;This is a cute hero movie.
4030;Any family will love seeing this.
4031;Especially people dreaming of reliving their glory days .
4032;I could pick up an issue of the Fantastic Four and get more character, better use of perfectly useful powers, an infinitely superior villain and more humor.
4033;I'm not sure if anyone in the theatre laughed once at this movie, except maybe a little girl in the row behind.
4034;the main characters of the movie are a married couple accidentally introducing their male and female children to a world of action and advanced technology.
4035;"Except things like ""Interesting characters""."
4036;"Pixar's ""Finding Nemo"" had a wonderfully unabashed pro."
4037;The Incredibles has a fantastic, unashamed pro.
4038;Our son has watched the movie at least two times per day since it has arrived so hope this one lasts longer than the original.
4039;Maybe I just like James Bond type movies, with all the gadgets and exotic locations .
4040;but this movie really worked on me, and it was great!Director Brad Bird has brought together all these elements, plus good writing, funny dialog, and enough suspense and surprise to keep you on the edge of your seat.
4041;If you're into the visual elements, your eyes will have a feast.
4042;Now that I think of it, so will your ears because, besides the music, the sound effects are awesome.
4043;What's really incredible is that you feel like the physical objects in this movie are real.
4044;It looks and moves like a real .
4045;And yet, I would love to take their place in some of those high tech environments .
4046;something else that disappoints a bit: Syndrome.
4047;Which is probably true of most of this film.
4048;It is definitely a spoof .
4049;If you're a kid at heart, you'll be taking a lot of it more seriously than you think.
4050;all the characters are memorable, but I've got to say, besides Mr. Incredible, my favorite is Baby Jack.
4051;That's why the movie is so darn funny and so entertaining.
4052;But in many ways it is better, and certainly holds its own with the other offerings of the Pixar team.
4053;Those guys, themselves, seem pretty incredible to me.
4054;It's rare that a movie lives up to its title.
4055;The Incredibles does precisely that by combining the excitement of the 60's Bond films, superhero epics and the dysfunctional American family.
4056;"Taking place in a world drawn from the 60's (and how we viewed the future then), ""The Incredibles"" allows Brad Bird (""The Iron Giant"") to pursue his unique vision as a film director."
4057;His style energizes the Pixar approach to animation allowing the studio to rival the more manic energy of Dreamworks while staying true to the character driven stories that make Pixar's films unique.
4058;"another ""Super"" transfer from Disney and Pixar, the Academy Award winning ""The Incredibles"" really was one of the highlights of last year."
4059;The bright, vivid cartoon colors and sharp images create a convincing world for this family of superheroes.
4060;This is an example of perfectly capturing the original theatrical experience as close as possible and transferring it to the home environment.
4061;It's just as funny as the feature.
4062;This cartoon also has a tongue.
4063;"The second ""Making of"" featurette is composed of smaller parts provide information about the making of this great movie from conception to alternate storylines and the final product."
4064;You'll understand why it takes a couple of years to create a film of this caliber.
4065;Story Supervisor Mark Andrews shows us the storyboarding process and we see how he and director/writer Bird interact.
4066;It's actually pretty funny and entertaining.
4067;"Making of The Incredibles and ""More Making of The Incredibles"" gives us a glimpse into the creation of the various characters with the animators discussing the difficulty in making the characters come alive."
4068;"The ""Music"" portion of this 40 minute ""featurette"" is the most fascinating more me as the composer managed to recall the classic spy themes of the 60's and 70's without imitating them."
4069;Brad Bird himself did the voice for Edna and it's pretty funny to hear the voice and see the character.
4070;Clearly the character combines Yoko Ono with Bette Midler and costume designer Edith Head and also manages to steal the film in every scene she's in.
4071;Bill Wise one of the technical supervisors discusses how difficult it was to create the characters for the crowd scenes.
4072;All sorts of fascinating bits from Bird and producer Walker crop up throughout the commentary from influences to visual tributes to other movies and mediums.
4073;The amount of detail and types of motions are much, much more complex and forced the animators to develop new techniques and new software to make those moves realistic.
4074;"a great American film (not just a great animated film), ""The Incredibles"" got the deserved recognition with an oscar."
4075;It's the best, most intense and original CGI animated cartoons produced to date.
4076;It's also helped Pixar reinvent itself yet again by NOT duplicating previous successes.
4077;"Bird demonstrated his special talents in the film ""The Iron Giant"" and he continues to break new ground in storytelling."
4078;Packed with a second disc of great extras, you'll learn more than you ever wanted to know about the making of this classic film.
4079;Here's hoping Bird will continue to break new ground and help keep Pixar fresh.
4080;I bought this movie for my son.
4081;He will bring it to me to watch and will not move until it's over!
4082;My son loves this movie from the time he was 4 months old he's now 7 the flashing colors and music.
4083;and Dash the super fast kid.
4084;Even now he says Oh The Incredibles, I love that movie .
4085;The Incredibles will make you laugh and laugh for days.
4086;I've seen most Pixar productions and they've all been fair, if not a bit too family.
4087;I LOVE the glorious art direction, the sheer DETAIL, the frenetic action sequences are dazzling and had me gasping for air, the casting (especially the always wonderful Holly Hunter), the inventiveness and creativity.
4088;"The feared ""family"" themes ."
4089;gives yet ANOTHER great performance.
4090;It's presented in 2.40:1 widescreen, which is a perfect choice.
4091;"It is so cool to see animated features being given the ""scope"" treatment ."
4092;And after you make it past such somber topics, you'll wonder how on earth they made the hair so realistic.
4093;i'm not an animated movie kind of girl, but this one was particularly good.
4094;A simple story it was, but a very well told one.
4095;This was rated G so I thought I would be suitable for young children.
4096;Definitely the top animation company so far this mullinium, PIXAR is ready to deliver another of it's extraordinary films with its highly acclaimed excellent sense of (clean) humor!Aside from their amazing humorous story.
4097;telling techniques PIXAR is also at the top of its trade with its stunning animation and special effects.
4098;Fianally the new realm of computer animation that has been feared for nearly a decade is being conquered with excellent style!This is definitely going to be the top film of the year for me and at least the top animated film of the year for many!
4099;One of the best in my book looking for part 2 to come out one day soon now I hope
4100;I thought this was Pixar's best movie.
4101;It had comedy, action, interesting characters, and great visuals.
4102;"Imagine blending ""Finding Nemo"" with ""True Lies"" and your favorite superhero comics."
4103;This is a good clean cartoon to watch on family night.
4104;Just enjoy it, get some popcorn and root for the home team.
4105;Not only is it (vastly) technically superior to the CGI offerings from other studios (and a significant improvement even on Pixar's previous offerings), but it again proves that Pixar understands what makes a great film .
4106;The characters have believable personalities, legitimate problems, and interact in plausible ways.
4107;The previews were all of the funny stuff.
4108;fiction and fantasy stories as if they were character.
4109;This is good, because it makes for engaging and believable story.
4110;But it also means the villains have to be much nastier .
4111;"Real characters need ""real"" threats (qv, ""A Bug's Life"")."
4112;I finally found this moving and my 4 (now 5) year old loves it.
4113;Fun super hero action without getting my son scared.
4114;This was easily one of the top 3 films of the year.
4115;Everything about this movie is perfect.
4116;The perfect visual effects, the score was amazing, Brad Bird directed this perfectly and was the voice of the funny Edna (who stole the show at parts in my opinion).
4117;Craig T. Nelson was the voice of the main character Bob and boy was he perfect for the role of our hero among all of the.
4118;The supporting cast was great with great actors and actresses along the lines of Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson, and Jason Lee.
4119;Just shows you don't need all big names to make a good film.
4120;Well if you are smart enough to know the type of humor than you would have known how funny that the movie actually was.
4121;this film is perfect for any age at all.
4122;This film is smart, witty, fun and is just a great film.
4123;I hope you all do the same.
4124;life crisis, the call comes from a mysterious source, and .
4125;well, a lot happens, but you'll see that for yourself.
4126;the older children, Dash and Violet, are good characters, but a lot more could have been done with them.
4127;Violet, especially, is at an early teen age that can be very complicated, but breezes through it with surprising ease.
4128;I like the Incredible kids, but I would have liked more development of both characters.
4129;This is good, silly fun.
4130;It has characters worth caring about, and enough in it to be worth seeing again.
4131;the Incredibles is a movie about a super hero that is forced into retirement but, alas, his heart is still with saving the world from danger.
4132;along the way Mr. Incredible has 3 incredible children who, of course, all have unique superpowers.
4133;Mr. Incredible inevitably gets drawn into peril, gets a new hero suit, and goes off to save the world against a very evil villain.
4134;Mr. Incredible's family joins him in this adventure, and the world is restored to happiness.
4135;the Incredibles is a movie for all ages.
4136;The humor is actually humorous, and I found myself laughing out loud many times.
4137;In general the movie is immersive, flows very well, and makes 90 minutes seem like 30.
4138;Thanks for the commentary Brad Bird!
4139;Pixar does another wonderful job with this subject.
4140;"Telling the excellent to ""run as fast as you can"" even if to deliberately come in a ""close second"" is what it takes for us to reach collective excellence."
4141;Super strength should be used.
4142;jack attack is a must!)
4143;Using super powers will just come naturally to you .
4144;special note on the benefit of watching the extras included in the double disk set: what a fantastic way to learn about the development of something like this!
4145;You can see growth and improvement.
4146;"Such insight into the mind of an artist is well worth watching the movie and then the ""Outtakes""."
4147;"You gotta see the ""Jack Jack Attack""."
4148;It is 4 minutes plus of pure delight!
4149;Another great piece is gettting to know the person behind the voice of Violet.
4150;She is a real superhero!
4151;or more than usual special features, something unique!
4152;absolutely beautiful picture and sound.
4153;Everyone seems to enjoy this one .
4154;So glad I finally got the blu.
4155;I got home from work one day recently after the kids had bought this at WAL.
4156;This is the epitome of good, family.
4157;GREAT animation, sound, and surprisingly thoughtful dialogue.
4158;I got the showtime, and while I had the paper open, I decided to look at the reviews.
4159;I had time, so I went to the movie.
4160;15 years later you meet up with Mr. and Mrs. Incredible again with Mr. Incredible an insurance salesman.
4161;He accepts and tells Elastigirl he's going on a business trip.
4162;I thought it was better than all of the live action superhero movies that I've seen.
4163;I liked it many times more than Spiderman, and I liked spiderman a lot.
4164;Superheroes are one of my favorite group of characters.
4165;I like the reality that this movie brings to what it would be like to be a true superhero.
4166;Also, I like that the family has real problems and works through them.
4167;This movie is a must for any family, or fan of super heroes.
4168;this is a great family movie!!
4169;I loved this movie in English.
4170;Nonetheless, it is still a nice one to have.
4171;But other than that, the discs work fine.
4172;The Incredibles deserves every accolade it has received.
4173;life crisis has NEVER been this entertaining.
4174;All the characters showed great courage, and I think it translates to the children watching the movie better than in more recent G. and PG.
4175;This movie is a good movie for 2 to Adult years my husband and my son both love this movie.
4176;I've seen this title several times with my daughter and i catch something new EVERY time!
4177;Lots of fun for the family.
4178;This is one of Disney's best.
4179;My kids and I love this movie.
4180;"in terms of action and adventure, the ""Incredibles"" is as good as any previous Disney effort."
4181;It is full of color and spectacle and will have the kids hooked within minutes.
4182;In this aspect, it is a very successful endeavor.
4183;I love this movie, it's incredible how this film can be so vaguely dark while retaining its childish glamour and style to appeal to all parties.
