I:8466;1;"I had only ever seen ""It Happened One Night"" once before, and that was about 20 years ago, in film class at junior college."
I:8466;2;It Happened One Night is an immortal film classic because *everything* about this 1934 screwball comedy (about a beautiful heiress on the run, and the handsome reporter who follows her) works perfectly: the wonderful lead performances of Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert (whose chemistry and comic sensibilitites are a joy to watch), great performances too from the whole supporting cast (no matter how small the roles), Frank Capra's very.
I:8466;3;assured direction, and Robert Riskin's hilarious, clever script.
I:8466;4;"pleasing moments throughout this film: the ""Walls Of Jericho"", the ""hitchhiking"" scene, the sing."
I:8466;5;It Happened One Night proved to be a box.
I:8466;6;"office smash, and it swept all the top Oscar categories in 1935, and deservedly so: Best Picture, Actor, Actress, Director and Screenplay (a feat that would not be matched for 40 years until ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" came along in 1975)."
I:8466;7;and I have finally bought it at last!
I:8466;8;Adapted for radio, certain modifications were made to the script, and the story was trimmed down to just under an hour, but it's still great fun, and it's wonderful to hear Gable and Colbert whooping it up as this classic comedy couple once more.
I:8466;9;It was only when the film was finally released, became adored by audiences all over, and they put that Best Actress Oscar in Colbert's hand, that she finally realised how wrong she had been.
I:8466;10;It Happened One Night is truly one of the great comedy classics of cinema history, a genuine crowd.
I:8466;11;pleaser that anyone can enjoy.
I:8466;12;In short music to make them sing, laugh, jitter.
I:8466;13;Film, as those elegant filled matinee theaters of the 1930s testified to, could help as well.
I:8466;14;the plotline here is pretty conventional.
I:8466;15;So our gal is a marked woman.
I:8466;16;All he wants is an exclusive story.
I:8466;17;Fun, fun, fun story and Actors!
I:8466;18;She was really excited to get to watch it.
I:8466;19;I have seen it on the TV several times and it has always been one of my favorite movies.
I:8466;20;I watched this because a friend recommend it to me on youtube.
I:8466;21;Loved it so much i bought it through amazon.
I:8466;22;It is such a good movie.
I:8466;23;Recommend it to anyone who likes old romantic comedies.
I:8466;24;A delightful little comedy, it's easy to see why `It Happened One Night' is still loved, even today.
I:8466;25;I can't say that I for one agree with its landing on AFI's `Top 100 Films of All Time', but I can agree with the fact that this sweetly charming (if not standard and clich d) tale of love found in all the wrong places is easy to swallow, easy to enjoy and very easy to recommend.
I:8466;26;what is really nice about this film is the undeniable chemistry between Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert.
I:8466;27;I am a huge fan of both these faces (especially Colbert, who is stunningly superb in everything I've seen her in) and this film truly showcases their undeniable charm and screen presence.
I:8466;28;This makes their transition from opposites to equals rather effortless and completely believable.
I:8466;29;"director Frank Capra really was a masterful director in his day, snapping out masterpiece after masterpiece
I:8466;30;Once Ellie hooks up with Peter, and Gable and Colbert establish their relationship, the film picks up quite a bit and actually soars, but it gets off to a slow start for me.
I:8466;31;It feels fresh here, despite it's overexposure in recent cinema, because of the actors take on the film.
I:8466;32;Gable and Colbert (as well as Capra) picked up Oscar's for this film (the film won everything it was nominated for, which included Picture, Director, Screenplay, Actor and Actress) and I am delighted since comedies very rarely get recognition from Oscar.
I:8466;33;Gable is beyond brilliant here and would most likely be my personal preference for the Oscar as well, but without seeing many films from this year I can't say that I'd go with this particular film in every category.
I:8466;34;it's not perfect, but it is very likable and I recommend this one without hesitation.
I:8466;35;Loved the fast talk and witty play.
I:8466;36;A screwball comedy at it's best!
I:8466;37;Gable is great (as always?)
I:8466;38;She has a range of emotions second to none (watch her in Drums Along the Mohawk).
I:8466;39;Another great, Willam Powell in Her Man Godfrey and The Thin Man series with another great Myrna Loy.
I:8466;40;There is no best, just all these films are great.
I:8466;41;The story line, the characters (even our pal Shapely) are all so great.2.
I:8466;42;I know to expect that mistakes may happen, but the company put it right so quickly that I had to say thanks and let everyone know!
I:8466;43;A match made in Hollywood heaven.
I:8466;44;The script and acting made this movie Oscar Gold.
I:8466;45;Listen to the radio play of the movie and be transported to 1934.
I:8466;46;This is unique for any great movie.
I:8466;47;It is because he was that good of an actor.
I:8466;48;The Best Picture winner of 1934, It Happened One Night, is very much buoyed by Clark Gable's presence.
I:8466;49;Her co. star makes her to look good.
I:8466;50;This was a picture during the Depression era, so it's hard to believe it garnered acclaim.
I:8466;51;Billed as a comedy, I found It Happened One Night to be mostly flat, but the pace is quite lively nevertheless.
I:8466;52;The funniest and best scene of the film is when Peter Warne pretends that he is a gangster, telling the nosy passenger to scram and stay quiet for good.
I:8466;53;All in all, It Happened One Night is just an okay picture, the film that Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, Oscar winners, had disliked to be part of.
I:8466;54;This is a Frank Capra film, so of course Ellie and Peter fall in love.
I:8466;55;And since it's a Capra film, you know that eventually Ellie and Peter end up married to each other.
I:8466;56;There are some very cute slightly sexy humor here, and I don't think I appreciated it.
I:8466;57;Great classic movie the way they used to be made.
I:8466;58;This movie is one laugh after another with a great story.
I:8466;59;You've probably read the story from other reviewers, so I won't remind you, but I just thought the plot was very clever and the humor just has to make you laugh.
I:8466;60;I really didn't like Clark Gable before I saw this movie, but my opinion of him improved after seeing this movie.
I:8466;61;I even got my mom to see this and she loved it as well!
I:8466;62;I never thought that a comedy from the 1930's would still be funny decades later.
I:8466;63;Clark Gable is a great actor and really makes the movie what it is.
I:8466;64;I would recommend this movie to all!
I:8466;65;75 years after its initial release, this film is still a pleasure to watch.
I:8466;66;It's as funny and charming today as it was back in 1934, when it won Best Picture and several other Academy Awards.
I:8466;67;This is probably the first really great romantic comedy ever made, just a few years after the silent picture era.
I:8466;68;What makes this film stand out (like most great films) is the writing brought to life with great performances.
I:8466;69;funny, real, briskly paced, authentic.
I:8466;70;both turned in the best performances of their careers in this movie.
I:8466;71;rate romantic comedy loaded with funny and memorable scenes.
I:8466;72;Funny, authentic, and entertaining from beginning to end.
I:8466;73;The scene where the mother collapses on the bus next to her son is very touching without being over.
I:8466;74;"top and reminds us that this is the depression
I:8466;75;camp to the shower also gives a glimpse of real life at the time while being funny too.
I:8466;76;In that regard, you can tell this is a 1934 film.
I:8466;77;Still as fresh and delightful as ever.
I:8466;78;One of the funniest of the screwball comedies and the ultimate battle of the sexes (and of the classes) comedy.
I:8466;79;"A priceless comedy that hasn't aged one bit, it also features two of the silver screen's greatest stars
I:8466;80;Filled with lots of memorable scenes with Colbert and Gable's amusing verbal riffs in between.
I:8466;81;The most memorable are the 'walls of Jericho'.
I:8466;82;hiking travails that ends with the unforgettable image of Colbert using her legs to get a ride proving once and for all that 'the limb is mightier than the thumb'.
I:8466;83;Claudette Colbert has always had and innocent sexiness to her personality and it is never more evident than here, she is one of the 'cutest' of all the female screen legends.
I:8466;84;Clark Gable is also excellent and his strong cinematic presence is greatly appreciated, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role.
I:8466;85;Probably the first great romantic comedy and still one of the best.
I:8466;86;Also famous for being the first picture to win 'the top 5' Oscars which are best picture, director, actor, actress and screenplay.
I:8466;87;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film a 10!
I:8466;88;ColbertSo many wonderful film classics over the decades have imitated this one that some of the bloom has worn off this groundbreaking Capra masterwork.
I:8466;89;It remains a wildly charming and entertaining film, however, and one of the best romantic comedies in the history of film.
I:8466;90;Robert Riskin's screenplay offers a blend of humor and romance buoyed by the performances of Clark Gable and the incomparable Claudette Colbert.
I:8466;91;But once he figures out who she really is, he has her over a barrel, and uses his leverage to travel with her and get a story that will put him right back on top.
I:8466;92;What follows has become sort of a formula for films in this genre, but as with most things, the original holds the most charm.
I:8466;93;Gable is hilarious giving a play by play lecture on how he undresses, and another on how to dunk a donut.
I:8466;94;His one on hitching a ride backfires, however, when it's Colbert's shapely legs which stops traffic.
I:8466;95;backer arguement that climaxes with Gable giving Colbert a spank as her carries her across the water is the best moment between them.
I:8466;96;as they get closer to their destination, Ellie crosses the walls and confesses her love for Peter.
I:8466;97;A bill for 39.60 and a father who knows what's best for his daughter culminates in an audience pleasing ending.
I:8466;98;This is a marvelous piece of celluloid whose luster has only changed from glossy to satin with the passage of time.
I:8466;99;The cover art looks the same but is in color this time, making an attractive display for film buffs.
I:8466;100;A must see film for anyone who loves the movies.
I:8466;101;One of the truly smash hits of the Depression '30s.
I:8466;102;The whole movie is extremely enjoyable: Gable is brash and sexy and Colbert spoiled, but not rotten about it.
I:8466;103;On the road they have all kinds of adventures, many of them classic (the Walls of Jericho, singing on the bus, the husband.
I:8466;104;Its appeal is with the characters: all are down.
I:8466;105;"class people (even the ""good"" rich people have middle."
I:8466;106;It won all the major Oscars .
I:8466;107;no better than if you'd bought it from a bootlegger at a swap.
I:8466;108;It deserves better treatment, and will no doubt get it eventually.
I:8466;109;improved version when it becomes available.
I:8466;110;Claudette and Clark really do make an awesome duo in this classic film.
I:8466;111;Good to watch multiple times.
I:8466;112;"In another review I called ""Pillow Talk"" one of the seminal films in the development of romantic comedies as we know, understand, and love them."
I:8466;113;It Happened one Night is its predecessor and partner.
I:8466;114;production, and a charming, funny, and moving story unfolded.
I:8466;115;It is absolutely worth it.
I:8466;116;hearted comedy doesn't age a bit is overstating the matter, but the overwhelming influence wrought by the success of the film makes it worth noting.
I:8466;117;Still, the age of the film is both part of its charm and part of its burden.
I:8466;118;era travel and mores are fascinating, but I cringed at the multiple references to light violence as the cure to one character's spoiled nature.
I:8466;119;She gets away with it because she manages to give full weight to the character.
I:8466;120;Both actors are fascinating to watch.
I:8466;121;everybody has their favorite scenes.
I:8466;122;Following that with the sweet gloating on Colbert's face after she's managed to hitch a ride for them.
I:8466;123;i'm no fan of Capra, but he acquits himself okay here, staging some scenes rather cleverly, and, I think.
I:8466;124;It is a testament to his abilities that so many of the sketches placed throughout the movie have become ingrained in popular culture.
I:8466;125;In casting extras, every face is magnificent, every small role has the potential to leap out and be as startling as Smooth.
I:8466;126;Standing by the side of the road she demurely pulls up the hem of her dress just enough to reveal her calf, immediately bringing a passing car to a sudden halt.
I:8466;127;"When you talk about the Golden Age"" of cinema one of the first films that have to come to mind is the '33 classic 'It Happened One Night' directed by Frank Capra and starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert."
I:8466;128;the chemistry between these two Hollywood legends is magical, the script enchanting and the supporting cast superb.
I:8466;129;It will make you laugh, it will make you cry.
I:8466;130;Simply one of the greatest comedy romances of all.
I:8466;131;I saw this in a class I was taking on film and absolutely loved it!
I:8466;132;It's a cute movie for anyone who likes romantic comedies.
I:8466;133;hearted gem last night for the first time.
I:8466;134;extras are interesting, especially the Lux Theatre radio broadcast (1939) with Claudette and Clark reprising their film roles.
I:8466;135;of documentary is also interesting.
I:8466;136;Over 70 years old and I laughed the entire time I was watching this wonderful movie.
I:8466;137;Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are one of the best on.
I:8466;138;see movie for any lover of great comedies and classics.
I:8466;139;This is a thoroughly delightful picture, with fantastic values in every department.
I:8466;140;Clark Gable is just right as the tough.
I:8466;141;This thourghly entertaining film set the vogue for the many screw.
I:8466;142;It was the first of it's kind and possibly the best.
I:8466;143;And much of it's success was due I think to the performance of Clark Gable, playing a alcoholic reporter with an eye for a good story.
I:8466;144;This so delights his cronies that they carry him away shoulder.
I:8466;145;But through a whole series of misadventures during which he consistently demonstrates he is on her side, he eventually wins her over and she agrees to give him the story he needs.
I:8466;146;with individuals poping up to do their own thing: the ride they hitch from a boisterous and deceptively friendly car.
I:8466;147;park they instantly transform themselves into a long.
I:8466;148;IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is still regarded as one of the best comedies ever made, thanks to the superb performances of Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable and the faultless direction of Frank Capra.
I:8466;149;iT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT scooped all five major catergories at the 1934 Academy Awards, winning Best Picture, Best Actor (Clark Gable), Best Actress (Claudette Colbert), Best Screenplay (Robert Riskin) and Best Director (Frank Capra).
I:8466;150;I love old black and white movies and this is one of my alltime favorites.
I:8466;151;I should have bought it years.
I:8466;152;Amazon again came up trumps.
I:8466;153;While it is a relatively thin comedy, the way it was put together was impeccable.
I:8466;154;It is simply wonderful entertainment.
I:8466;155;I confess to liking old films very much.
I:8466;156;One of the many reasons for doing so is that so many of them were character driven and dialogue rich and had human actors playing parts and reacting with each other.
I:8466;157;I don't mind the occasional computer generated and special effects heavy piece of nonsense, but I really do love films about people.
I:8466;158;Whatever one may say about the old Hollywood and its contract players and star system it certainly produced some commanding screen presences.
I:8466;159;The interaction here between Clark and Claudette is wonderfully watchable.
I:8466;160;Excellent movie for those who enjoy the classics.
I:8466;161;It's nice to go back and enjoy a good movie the way they use to make them.
I:8466;162;For those who enjoy the old classic movies and actors this is one where you will enjoy from start to the finish.
I:8466;163;In modern times with the foul language and unbelievable plots this flick is fun to watch even thought you know the ending corny.
I:8466;164;Anyone who loves classics should get this movie.
I:8466;165;Full of great humor and laughs!
I:8466;166;It Happened One Night is an iconic 1930s screwball comedy with all the graces of the Golden Age of Hollywood, which should be pursued by any classic film junkie.
I:8466;167;Directed by Frank Capra, this film captures the glorious fast.
I:8466;168;talking wit of a leading lady, Claudette Colbert, as well as the dependability, strength and humor of Clark Gable as the leading man who knows his every move but seems to comedically fuss them all up.
I:8466;169;"For a charming and clever film, ""It Happened One Night"" takes you back to a time when movies were reels of gold."
I:8466;170;Frank Capra used his tried and true formula with humor to make one of the best romantic comedies of the 1930's.
I:8466;171;Let the war games begin as Colbert and Gable engage in the sophisticated and very funny running banter that makes the movie so appealing.
I:8466;172;her flight via the bus, and other forms of travel, is the vehicle for moving the couple and the plot along as their relationship develops.
I:8466;173;What follows are a number of classic comic scenes which, of course, ineluctably lead to true love.
I:8466;174;What is usually missing from that clip is the whole hilarious build up, brilliantly done by Gable as he demonstrates the tried and true ways of thumbing a ride.
I:8466;175;He does a wonderful job of setting his large male thumb, and ego, up for the big take.
I:8466;176;down that Colbert's lovely leg produces.
I:8466;177;The request for the toy horn is a fittingly excellent double entendre for the d nouement.
I:8466;178;After all adversities that King Westley and her father pose are overcome by true love the newly.
I:8466;179;This is the stuff of good film.
I:8466;180;Throughout his career Capra truly evinced an idealism in his movies that is hard to picture in our time.
I:8466;181;"It is amazing that he was able to preserve that idealism right through to his last movie in 1961, fittingly titled ""A Pocketful of Miracles."""
I:8466;182;I've now watched it two nights in row and it's great.
I:8466;183;Claudette and that guy look great on screen together.
I:8466;184;I really apreciate the character development, and Claudette Colbert is just so fine.
I:8466;185;I think I'll watch it again and again and again, untill my mind is blasted.
I:8466;186;The combination of Clark Gables' charm and Claudette Colberts' comedy genius is a thing of greatness.
I:8466;187;Never has a bus ride been so fun their chemistry was magnetic and is perhaps one of the best romantic comedies of all time.
I:8466;188;This legendary film was a mix of serious comedy about two people on a train one a reporter looking for the next big story and the other a priveliged daughter of a wealthy bank who is trying to escape to live her own life.
I:8466;189;What starts out as a stern conversation leads to a whirlwind romance with comedy from beginning to end.
I:8466;190;handedly uplift Columbia Pictures from Poverty Row and was the first picture to win the Oscar Grand Slam, Best Picture, Actor, Actress, Screenplay and Director!
I:8466;191;The dialogue is great, the photography, the actors (especially the actors) are all unique and really stand out in this film.
I:8466;192;And Dunkin' Donuts still sells a decent OLD FASHIONED donut that will let you relive Clark Gable's tutorial.
I:8466;193;One of the great movies of that time in my opinion.
I:8466;194;It is a very rare thing when a light.
I:8466;195;hearted comedy, something that is quintessentially the stuff of a `good movie,' breaches into that territory where the term `good film' can also be applied, but Frank Capra's 1934 film It Happened One Night may be an exception.
I:8466;196;This is all the more interesting because the 1930s, with their still newly developed sound technology, were still a transition period, of sorts, with the over the top hammy expressionistic acting of the silent films still dominating more than the more subtle naturalism of later film eras.
I:8466;197;Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Lead Actor, and Best Lead Actress, is credited with being the first `screwball comedy,' a subgenre of the romantic comedy, that flourished during the Great Depression and World War Two years.
I:8466;198;Another aspect of this film, which makes it relevant today, is the brisk pace at which it was filmed, acted, and even edited.
I:8466;199;with a portrayal of a Stepin Fetchit like black railroad character, but that's a minor cavil in an otherwise great comedy, and possibly great film.
I:8466;200;But what makes a man great, especially an artist, is the degree to which those times claw at him, and the percentage of times a man of his time becomes a man for all times.
I:8466;201;The same is true for his art, and this artist and his film pass both of those bars.
I:8466;202;those two make this fun to watch.
I:8466;203;I enjoyed it, however, much more on the first viewing than subsequent ones.
I:8466;204;with Gable and Colbert trading barbs .
I:8466;205;Gable has the best lines an is the most fun to watch but Colbert can hold her own.
I:8466;206;ish and cute, although most of her closeups are done with a fuzzy lens, another habit of filmmakers of that era had with female stars.
I:8466;207;one of the film world's most famous scenes is in this movie: the hitch.
I:8466;208;That is still one of the great comedic scenes in movie history.
I:8466;209;"overall, this is still one of the best comedies of ""The Golden Age,"" even with its faults."
I:8466;210;Times were hard in 1934 and this light hearted piece of nut cake hit the spot.
I:8466;211;It is one of the very few films even nominated and one of only two that won have won all five of the big Oscars: Best Pictures, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Screenplay).
I:8466;212;All films follow certain standard storylines, but the best ones draw you into their story enough that you stop looking at how it fulfills the requirements of its plot.
I:8466;213;This one combines the duck out of water with a road picture and provides a nice touch of confused romance along the way.
I:8466;214;Claudette Colbert plays Ellie Andrews, the sheltered, spoiled, and impetuous daughter of a very wealthy and very powerful father who has plans for her life.
I:8466;215;"But he recognizes Ellie Andrews and decides to travel with her and see what kind of a story he can get from her journey to seek her ""true love""."
I:8466;216;There are many adventures along the way that set up opportunities for gags, for the rich girl to get her comeuppance and realize that the world is full of wonderful people outside her social class.
I:8466;217;this is a delightful movie and holds up well more than 70 years later.
I:8466;218;I think the whole family can enjoy it quite nicely.
I:8466;219;No one thought the picture had a chance, but after it did well and won all those awards, it suddenly found many prophets who had predicted in its success and a large host of people who had contributed to its success.
I:8466;220;Bringing Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable together with a fabulous supporting cast and an equally great script and director lends itself to being the greatest comedy ever.
I:8466;221;This timeless screwball comedy is without a doubt one of Frank Capra's finest efforts, despite the low budget he had to work with.
I:8466;222;Also, Clark Gable won a much.
I:8466;223;deserved best actor oscar, and the film also won best picture, best director, and best screenplay awards.
I:8466;224;obviously, the movie made a huge impact back in 1934, and after more than 70 years it's still entertaining people all over the world!
I:8466;225;The sharp and witty dialogue is so hilarious and the casting couldn't have been better.
I:8466;226;"This is also the earliest performance of Ward Bond I've ever seen (he plays the officer who says, ""Oh yeah?"""
I:8466;227;The bonus features include a 10.
I:8466;228;This classic is highly recommended for all fans of screwball comedies.
I:8466;229;It Happened One Night is an excellent comedy released in 1934.
I:8466;230;It garnered five Oscars, including Best Picture.
I:8466;231;Its unique laughter attracting style remains entertaining, regardless how many viewings.
I:8466;232;Its love story theme remains funny and serious in the perfect scenes.
I:8466;233;Its many twists and turns keeps audiences interested in what will happen next, from Ellie's escape from her father and fiance to Ellie meeting Peter to the two slowly falling in love.
I:8466;234;Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert earned an Oscar for their lead roles.
I:8466;235;Both brilliant actors offer their own comedy and serious theme, which adds more flavor.
I:8466;236;Regardless if they express greed, love, rejection, happiness, or anger, their every moment is flawless.
I:8466;237;It Happened One Night is a great classic film for those looking for unique humor.
I:8466;238;This will surely continue pleasing audiences for many more years.
I:8466;239;Naturally, romance follows, but it's a bumpy and hugely entertaining road to get there.
I:8466;240;this is an absolutely wonderful film.
I:8466;241;Gable and Colbert have wonderful chemistry and are both hilarious and touching.
I:8466;242;The rest of the cast is excellent as well.
I:8466;243;The wisecracking between characters is sharp and well.
I:8466;244;"written (by screenwriter Robert Riskin)
I:8466;245;loud moments during this film.
I:8466;246;It's also pretty racy and suggestive for its time, with a genuinely affecting climax.
I:8466;247;Another level of interest is added by the careful attention that director Frank Capra pays to the depression.
I:8466;248;This adds a fascinating sociological dimension.
I:8466;249;Clark Gabel and Claudette Colbert won oscars for their portrayals of a couple brought togther on a bus.
I:8466;250;Additionally, the movie won the best picture award.
I:8466;251;In this well made romantic comedy, Colbert, although a spoiled society girl, has spunk in getting away from her father and she shows lots of charm.
I:8466;252;if you are very observant, you will see a very familiar face in the movie.
I:8466;253;There is the famous hitch hiking scene in which Colbert shows Gabel how to stop a car.
I:8466;254;this oscar winning movie is an absolute delight.
I:8466;255;Maybe most romantic comedies have become trite, but for this, the original, the Academy Award is well deserved
I:8466;256;but anything Claudette Colbert will always please me.
I:8466;257;It was the first film to win all 5 major Academy Awards and I would like to see why
I:8466;258;Ellen Andrews (Claudette Colbert) is a rich, young woman who escapes from her father to be with her husband in New York.
I:8466;259;On the train on her way, she meets a charming newspaper reporter, Peter Warne (Clark Gable).
I:8466;260;a hilarious and romantic movie, It Happened One Night is one of the best classics ever.
I:8466;261;The writing, the acting .
I:8466;262;everything about it is excellent.
I:8466;263;You know a movie is something special when nearly seventy years since it's release, it is still as cherished as ever!
I:8466;264;I adore this movie, the story line is wonderful, the chemistry between Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert and the filming techniques really draw you in.
I:8466;265;Some romance movies are timeless.
I:8466;266;the movie's video and audio has been digitally remastered and the special features was very nice to see.
I:8466;267;Remembers segment, the trailers, vintage advertising and the original live radio broadcast is an even added bonus.
I:8466;268;As well as the commentary by Frank Capra's son.
I:8466;269;what I found quite interesting is to learn the behavior by our two main thespians behind.
I:8466;270;otherwise it's a great movie classic that people should see!
I:8466;271;This was a delightful Movie.
I:8466;272;I am a huge Clark Gable fan.
I:8466;273;I enjoyed it from start to finish.
I:8466;274;It was truly a wonderful, fun, happy, delightful film.
I:8466;275;Thank you for having it in your selection.
I:8466;276;The Haye's Code, most likely in force, was compromised to see a skirt hitched thigh high with that perfect gam and ensuing end result, hilarious!I kept seeing Julia Roberts in Runaway Bride in the final scene with her wedding train flowing through the meadows to an escape vehicle.
I:8466;277;There is something about the classic acting styles of the actors in the older films that bring to life the stories and unfolding dramas.
I:8466;278;You will be riveted to the screen, sharing in the intense emotions and laughs.
I:8466;279;This is a perfect film, up their with WIZARD OF OZ.
I:8466;280;It's all been written about many times, so I'll just add that it's like a piece of music .
I:8466;281;It still holds up after all this time, and Clark Gable is as sexy as ever with those pervasive dimples and ironic grin.
I:8466;282;"The chemistry between Gable and Colbert makes this movie hum, and compared to the drek we get today both in our ""stars"" and the scripts, it is a stellar piece of art."
I:8466;283;The characterization in this movie is some of the best I've ever seen.
I:8466;284;And that's all I'll reveal here.
I:8466;285;You'll just have to take my word for it: the plot moves along swiftly, the dialogue is inventive and at times wildly funny, and the performances are first.
I:8466;286;rate, including those of the second.
I:8466;287;The chemistry between Gable and Colbert reminds me of that between Bogart and Katherine Hepburn in The African Queen .
I:8466;288;But the trip, for both of these classics, is worth far more than the fare, whatever you paid!
I:8466;289;"It Happened One Night (Frank Capra, 1934, 105')This movie set the pace for the ""screwball"" comedy, the witty and romantic clash of temperaments between a man and a woman mismatched in both personality and social position, a type of movie often associated with Katherine Hepburn in such classics as Bringing Up Baby (1938) and The Philadelphia Story (1940), among others."
I:8466;290;it Happened One Night made an immediate impact on the public.
I:8466;291;the early awareness of the characters signals the greater context of the story, which resides in a country awash in economic desperation, whether it's shown through Ellie's aversion to eating raw carrots or at an auto.
I:8466;292;wise Peter is what makes up most of the laughs, for instance, the memorable hitchhiking and doughnut.
I:8466;293;Considering how the two stars were forced to make the film, both show themselves in top form.
I:8466;294;driven image without upending it, while Claudette Colbert brings her particularly effervescent style to Ellie.
I:8466;295;an unforced sexiness permeates the scenes between Gable and Colbert which makes some of the more preposterous story turns more bearable, starting with why Ellie's marital predicament is front.
I:8466;296;Kudos to Joseph Walker's luminescent cinematography, especially during the moonlit haystack scene, and to costume designer Robert Kalloch for Ellie's knockout diaphanous wedding gown in the finale.
I:8466;297;It is also one of the best screwball comedies ever made (actually, I think it is one of the best comedies ever made, in general)!
I:8466;298;Both Colbert and Gable give excellent performances, and the dialogue between the two characters is really sweet and funny.
I:8466;299;It Happened One Night is a perfect example of the kind of movies that have pretty much disappeared today: movies with captivating and original plots, good dialogue, and great acting .
I:8466;300;This is quite funny and very entertaining.
I:8466;301;Clark Gable is at his best and Miss Colbert is awesome in the roll she plays.
I:8466;302;Although it was made in the late 30's, the movie is so beautifully done that it never feels dated.
I:8466;303;The chemistry and interactions between Gable and Colbert are enchanting.
I:8466;304;70 years later, this movie still holds up beautifully.
I:8466;305;It's funny, smart, and, man!
I:8466;306;this ones recommended for everyone .
I:8466;307;It hasn't aged, and it'll always be a good time.
I:8466;308;I loved it so much Clark Gable is a classic and he is great in anything.
I:8466;309;This screwball comedy keeps you laughing through the entire film.
I:8466;310;This movie is far yet my favorite of Clark Gable's.
I:8466;311;I liked the way he portrays a drunkin' news reporter, yelling at his boss over the telephone while his drunkin friends cheered him on.
I:8466;312;I also liked what he said when claudette colbert was standing up over him on the bus as it started to leave the station.
I:8466;313;"The bus moved and jerked her back
I:8466;314;He told her, Next time you drop in bring your folks.
I:8466;315;It's a comedy, and a romance that everyone in the family could enjoy.
I:8466;316;o. k. both, Casablanca and Gone with the Wind are great movies, but this one tops both as a classic, Frank Capra's first acknowledged masterpiece which won all of the important Academy Awards (5) for the first time.
I:8466;317;The acting and the scenario is so natural and believable, especially the relationship that develops between the characters played by Gable and Colbert.
I:8466;318;It Happen One Night won the top 5 Oscars of 1934.
I:8466;319;Best Picture, Best Director .
I:8466;320;Frank Capra, Best Actor .
I:8466;321;Clark Gable, Best Actress .
I:8466;322;This is one of the best screwball comedies ever.
I:8466;323;As events unfurl situations occur they become involved the rest is cinematic history.
I:8466;324;The extras, including a radio broadcast show with Gable and Colbert one of the best movie commentaries by Frank Capra Jr. (Frank Sr's, son)are added treats to enjoy.
I:8466;325;this is a great way to enjoy the Hollywood of the 30's and the stellar cast performing perfectly.
I:8466;326;Gable and Colbert both do well in this film and Capra gives us another light classic.
I:8466;327;It Happened One Night is one of those timeless classic comedies you can go back to after watching.
I:8466;328;It is fitting that this film took home many Academy Awards, being that it has memorable scenes, two major stars who deliver (Claudette Colbert, Clark Gable), well.
I:8466;329;timed comedy and witty dialog, and, of course, a romantic edge between a mismatched couple.
I:8466;330;He has his own agenda.
I:8466;331;"First, the scene where Peter confronts Ellen, saying he had her ""pegged as a brat"" and ""snob"" from the start is important to the changing of Ellen's character."
I:8466;332;"Second, the famous ""hitchhiking"" scene is classic."
I:8466;333;One of the most memorable scenes in all film, this moment really displays Peter's cockiness.
I:8466;334;It pretty much defines the difference of personality between the two characters.
I:8466;335;I thought the road trip part of the film was the best (the first hour or so), but that maybe the film lost a little luster towards the end.
I:8466;336;still, for what it's worth, this is a wonderful film, one of those that you can watch if you are in the mood of romantic comedy.
I:8466;337;It really displays the talents of Clark and Colbert, who have fantastic chemistry, and the exceptional direction from Frank Capra.
I:8466;338;Feel good movie good for all ages although senior citizens will certainly appreciate the time period.
I:8466;339;As in It's a Wonderful Life.
I:8466;340;"wise, this is a good movie except that when you consider that this was up against ""The Thin Man"" in the same categories save Best Actress, I find it hard to believe that this movie is the better screwball romance of the two."
I:8466;341;"Firstly, the jokes are more frequent and are less dated sounding and I found myself laughing at them although I was born more than 3 decades later and overall ""The Thin Man"" moves along at a good pace making it for me the true Best Picture of 1934."
I:8466;342;"as the second best movie of 1934, this movie has a few good things going for it although to call it the best ever screwball romantic comedy would be ridiculous as there are many better ones such as ""My Girl Friday"" and ""The Philadelphia Story"" just to name a couple let alone ""The Thin Man"", as it does have a pretty good screenplay and both Gable and Claudette have a good on."
I:8466;343;This is a great classic movie.
I:8466;344;It's very entertaining and funny.
I:8466;345;My teen who did not understand why I enjoy black and white classics is now a huge fan of them.
I:8466;346;This movie is his new favorite.
I:8466;347;A DELIGHTFUL FILM FOR ALL!
I:8466;348;This Frank Capra film is timeless!
I:8466;349;This first romantic comedy (they called them screwball comedies then) won 5 Academy Awards in 1934.
I:8466;350;best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Screenplay.
I:8466;351;It is still funny and cute even though it is 70+ years old.
I:8466;352;love scene without showing any sex.
I:8466;353;my favorite movie of all times.
I:8466;354;i bought this one for myself and will enjoy it for years to come.
I:8466;355;to me, the ultimate classic.
I:8466;356;in 1934 that a much beloved comedy would take home all five major awards.
I:8466;357;musical film to devote to the performance of a single ditty.
I:8466;358;important dialogue or some visually compelling action, whatever it takes to move the plot along.
I:8466;359;clark and Claudette make for a rare comedic team.
I:8466;360;She had worked with Capra before, and the two hadn't gotten along: but after winning the Oscar, she publicly expressed her gratitude to the director for seeing the project through.
I:8466;361;"iT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is one of the classic ""screwball comedies,"" a genre which occasionally revived in contemporary cinema (usually in a very self."
I:8466;362;This is another great Frank Capra film about a well.
I:8466;363;While you can predict what happens, it's still enjoyable for the dialog and the acting/directing.
I:8466;364;It's a classic because it is so good, and that definitely applies to this movie.
I:8466;365;Funny, romantic, sweet, with a wonderful happy ending.
I:8466;366;One of Clark Gable's best performances, in my opinion.
I:8466;367;My fiancee was completely surprised to receive her most favorite movie.
I:8466;368;I am a very happy customer.
I:8466;369;2 of the classic actors enjoy it and love it recommend it would like to have it in color .
I:8466;370;This is a piece of art.
I:8466;371;The freshness of the Colbert and Gable is a treasure to behold.
I:8466;372;"the dialogue is smart and witty and even the 30s slang ""Oh yeah???????????"""
I:8466;373;and its like is used to great advantage in the film.
I:8466;374;This is one of the rare cases when EVERYTHING in a film works.
I:8466;375;Its stars, Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable, won Oscars for Best Actress and Best Actor.
I:8466;376;Its director Frank Capra took home Best Director.
I:8466;377;Colbert as Ellie Anderson, the spoiled rich girl with the pencil eyebrows, is perfect, as is Clark Gable, the gruff newspaper man Peter Warne with the pencil.
I:8466;378;There is one funny scene after another.
I:8466;379;And everybody loves a wedding even if we have a runaway bride, something that would be done again and again in future films.
I:8466;380;But you can do that in old movies.
I:8466;381;It Happened One Night may have been a pleasant diversion in the difficult year it was released.
I:8466;382;This famous film plays hard thanks to the wonderful handle camera the powerful direction of Capra , the fine cast and a jiggy script .
I:8466;383;Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable are simply engaged and the script will reveal very funny and smart situations .
I:8466;384;stunning classic made with broad gusto .
I:8466;385;It's extremely romantic with memorable scenes and characters.
I:8466;386;This movie is a real GEM.
I:8466;387;What happens along the way is precious.
I:8466;388;A wonderful, interesting look at life in the early 30's, as well.
I:8466;389;This film deserves a frame.
I:8466;390;Thank goodness everything that went on in front of the lens is pure gold!Even though so much has changed from the time period in which this gem was filmed, romance and men and women have actually changed very little.
I:8466;391;Watch it alone or, even better, with the one you love.
I:8466;392;IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT belongs in every true movie fan's collection.
I:8466;393;This is a classic old movie that was made in 1934.
I:8466;394;It's interesting in this movie to see how things have and haven't changed.
I:8466;395;Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert do an excellent job in this movie and this movie is well worth seeing!!
I:8466;396;An all time great flick!
I:8466;397;well the foxy and the hound.
I:8466;398;the film has one of the best wedding.
I:8466;399;It Happened One Night has aged very well, and it remains as funny and sexy as when it first premiered in 1934.
I:8466;400;Colbert and especially Gable are in top form, displaying a terrific chemistry in Frank Capra's comedy.
I:8466;401;The scenes I enjoyed are the same as everyone else .
I:8466;402;the walls of Jericho and Colbert's method for hitch.
I:8466;403;Give credit to Capra, writer Robert Riskin, and of course, the star combination.
I:8466;404;I always liked this movie besides it had won academy awards.
I:8466;405;This classic film is SO AMAZINGLY FUNNY!!!
I:8466;406;the two stars are great in their Oscar.
I:8466;407;Let's just say this, though: the dad is really funny and entertaining!!!
I:8466;408;I totally recommend this movie to anyone!!!
I:8466;409;One of the very first great Romantic comedies.
I:8466;410;I saw this move on TCM, with my stepmom and she loves it.
I:8466;411;So I ordered it for her and had it shipped to her house.
I:8466;412;BTW I am not a classic movie fan but this story is well told and acted.
I:8466;413;This one is a must for any old movie buff.
I:8466;414;gable is great but colbert steals the show.
I:8466;415;a very funny film which lacks the stilted conservativeness of the 40's and 50's.
I:8466;416;Very funny movie, love Clark Gable, wish it was in color, but that's ok.
I:8466;417;Would recommend to older persons who would appreciate good acting and great movie.
I:8466;418;I don't claim be a movie expert, but this is the best film I have ever seen.
I:8466;419;and boy was it worth it!
I:8466;420;He has a wonderfully relaxed style and doesn't just sound as if he's reading from a prepared script.
I:8466;421;The disc also includes trailers, cast lists, some beautifully illustrated posters and also a Frank Capra Jr introduction.
I:8466;422;This really is an extremely impressive package of Frank Capra's masterpiece.
I:8466;423;The script is clever, the leads have wonderful synergy and spot.
I:8466;424;how well can 1934 comedy translate into the modern day?
I:8466;425;The answer is: Very well!
I:8466;426;This movie set up the structure of every romantic comedy to follow in the last 70 years: two characters who dislike one another are thrown together by circumstances, much hilarious in.
I:8466;427;This movie invented the formula, and never have I seen it work better.
I:8466;428;this is a comedic tour de force.
I:8466;429;I saw it in a movie theater and everyone was laughing out loud at the physical comedy, the witty banter, the situational irony, the over.
I:8466;430;This is a masterpiece of comedy not to be missed!
I:8466;431;This is the greatest movie ever!
I:8466;432;Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are amazing together, and the story only brings it out more!
I:8466;433;The movie swept the Oscars for a production of 1934 vintage, and of all the movies made in this era, this one seems to stand up today as best.
I:8466;434;"The opening credits are absolutely childish
I:8466;435;"no, the chemistry between the budding lovers is just fine, thank you
I:8466;436;My sister and her husband requested this movie.
I:8466;437;thanx for delivering it in a timely manner.
I:8466;438;smart reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable).
I:8466;439;They end up traveling together as Warne hopes to get a great story, and Ellie needs his worldly help.
I:8466;440;She was summoned from a train station to pick up her Academy Award.
I:8466;441;But sShe got best actress and the film won best picture.
I:8466;442;Clark Gable had a great time making it.
I:8466;443;It is a fun movie from start to finish with a most pleasing ending.
I:8466;444;shared the movie with a young friend who likes classic film (does not mind B and W) and he also liked it a lot.
I:8466;445;Thus, it appeals to some, at least, of a new generation.
I:8466;446;It's romantic, witty, sophisticated .
I:8466;447;A near perfect blend of script, direction, and performance, it deservedly swept the top five 1934 Academy Awards.
I:8466;448;in a revival theatre, on satellite, and on VHS .
I:8466;449;I especially enjoyed the advertising archive section, which included color reproductions of the original one.
I:8466;450;sheet posters and lobby cards.
I:8466;451;Academy Award film with such good acting by Clark Gable and Claudet Colbert.
I:8466;452;Very entertaining from start to finish!A film one enjoys seeing over again.
I:8466;453;See for yourself how it all plays out!
I:8466;454;capra, Gable, and Colbert at the top of their form.
I:8466;455;"product came in perfect condition
I:8466;456;Frank Capra's sublime romantic comedy swept the 1934 Oscars, and it's still easy to understand why.
I:8466;457;Few seventy year old movies hold up like this one.
I:8466;458;Colbert makes a charming, deft comedienne (check out that hitch.
I:8466;459;, and Gable was never more appealing, winning his only Oscar for this role.
I:8466;460;Hail to the walls of Jericho!
I:8466;461;Still love the banter between Clark Gable and Claudia Corbett.
I:8466;462;Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert had such great chemistry.
I:8466;463;It Happened One Night was the first film to win all 5 major Academy Awards in 1934 and holds a spot on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (#35), yet remains unseen by many.
I:8466;464;For a movie I had little faith in when I began watching it, I realized that this is a film that deserves being in the top 100 and is a film that is really hard not to enjoy.
I:8466;465;It actually is a pretty funny movie.
I:8466;466;"It's directed by Frank Capra, one of the most acclaimed director's of all time, and I like this film better than his ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" which places higher on A. f. i.'S Top 100."
I:8466;467;Gable and Colbert have great screen chemistry and look like they enjoyed making the film together (although movie lore says Colbert hated every second of it).
I:8466;468;Here, it's just a very funny moment.
I:8466;469;I really love old black and white movies, and this one got so many awards I figured I'd love it.
I:8466;470;*It Happened One Night* is the archetype of the romantic comedy form.
I:8466;471;It gets better: director Frank Capra paints a broad canvas of American life in the Depression.
I:8466;472;It's rare that an old studio picture like this, especially a romantic comedy, gets so much FRESH AIR.
I:8466;473;The cinematography is matches the bold conception.
I:8466;474;Colbert learns a lot about life during her exile with Gable, away from her castle in the air and on the road.
I:8466;475;(Oh, it's also an archetypal ROAD movie, as well.)
I:8466;476;Most importantly, she learns what it takes to be in Real Love, and finds, to her surprise and our delight, that she HAS what it takes.
I:8466;477;I have loved this movie forever.
I:8466;478;Of course, sparks fly between the two of them as they fall in love.
I:8466;479;this is a terrifically funny movie that tells a great story.
I:8466;480;Along the way, the movie offers up a snapshot of 1934 American life that is true and vanished.
I:8466;481;Even cool 19 year old boys who only relate to the Sopranos love this movie.
I:8466;482;It Happened One Night is one my favorite films.
I:8466;483;Arrived on time and in great condition.
I:8466;484;Commentary by Capra, Jr gives a surprising insight as to how a great movie could have rocky foundations.
I:8466;485;I was extremely happy to find this movie for such a good price as it is one of my all.
I:8466;486;A classic movie all should see.
I:8466;487;Frank Capra was a genius of a director.
I:8466;488;Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were probably in the best comedy of their careers thanks to Capra.
I:8466;489;It was delivered in a timely fashion and have no complaints.
I:8466;490;The classics are classic for a reason.
I:8466;491;This is Claudette Colbert's signature comedy movie, in fact she won an Academy award for it.
I:8466;492;It is actually sometimes while watching it hard to believe how old the movie is because it is still extremely fresh and entertaining.
I:8466;493;I've loved this movie ever since I saw it as a kid on the Turner Classic Movies channel.
I:8466;494;A romantic comedy that's not raunchy and is actually funny!
I:8466;495;Truely a classic movie that any film fan, and definitely any Clark Gable fan, should own.
I:8466;496;I enjoy it every time I see it.
I:8466;497;Light, cute, and lots of fun .
I:8466;498;The charisma of the characters and the banter are as fresh and amusing today as when the movie was first made.
I:8466;499;What a great film !
I:8466;500;The chemistry and dialogue that exists between Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable is amazingly BRILLIANT and FUNNY!
I:8466;501;"This is the type of black and white film that can be watched forever and ever and never seem ""dated"" and out of touch w/recent times: after all, its been almost 7O years since this movie was made and it still ranks up there w/ some of the best comedies of today!"
I:8466;502;I wasn't even born when the movie was made but I enjoyed it so much, I wanted to watch it again and again!
I:8466;503;If that doesn't convince you, this video won 5 Oscars: Best Actor (GABLE), Best Actress (COLBERT), Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay!!
I:8466;504;Claudette Colbert plays Ellie Andrews, a rich, spoiled heiress running away from her family.
I:8466;505;smart reporter Peter Warne, played by the handsome Clark Gable.
I:8466;506;Ellie is definitely NOT street.
I:8466;507;It was a smash hit and won many Oscars.
I:8466;508;The frantic father offers a huge money reward to the person who can find her.
I:8466;509;It deserves all the accolades that it has received.
I:8466;510;If you have not yet seen this motion picture, do yourself a favor and do so.
I:8466;511;I ordered this movie as a gift because I remember liking it.
I:8466;512;It's a light, funny, classic screwball comedy.
I:8466;513;I thought my brother and his wife would like it for a night when they just wanted something fun to enjoy.
I:8466;514;Shipping was fast, great condition.
I:8466;515;I think this is a great film for everyone who loves Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert.
I:8466;516;Every New Year's Eve we watch this movie.
I:8466;517;It's just plain fun, and what's not to like about Clark Gable.
I:8466;518;We both the love the movie and I found it.
I:8466;519;She loved the Christmas present!
I:8466;520;It Happened One Night was just superb and one of my most favorite romantic comedies of all time.
I:8466;521;It is smart and charming from beginning to end.
I:8466;522;Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert have this amazing chemistry throughout the film that draws you into the story and connects you to the characters.
I:8466;523;Frank Capra is a master in bringing this story to the screen.
I:8466;524;I laughed, cried and just couldn't tear myself away until I finished watching it.
I:8466;525;It's amazing how this 1930s film can still capture my heart every time I see it.
I:8466;526;Everything is perfect in the this movie the jokes don't tire, they are funny every time.
I:8466;527;The charm of the movie is immense.
I:8466;528;It arrived very quickly and in excellent condition.
I:8466;529;Both my 16 year old son and I sat very entertained for the entire movie.
I:8466;530;Gave it to my daughter in law and she loved it!
I:8466;531;Anyone who is a classic movie buff, or who are fans of Clark Gable or Claudette Cobert would truly love this romantic comedy!
I:8466;532;I have watched it several times since and always enjoy it.
I:8466;533;It is literally one of my favorites now.
I:8466;534;coms I find them wicked stupid followed by bad acting, but I must disagree with this film I absolutely enjoyed it
I:8466;535;It was also brand new.
I:8466;536;clark gable is hilarious playing off of his co. star.
I:8466;537;"In spite of 60 plus years of ""romantic comedies"" which have followed ""It Happened One Night,"" it remains fresh and laugh."
I:8466;538;"Clark Gable is at his most charming as the scheming newspaper reporter who hopes to get the inside scoop on the ""brat,"" played beautifully by Claudette Colbert, who is on the run from her millionaire father."
I:8466;539;Columbia Classics has done a wonderful job of presenting the best print we can probably expect 60 years on.
I:8466;540;This is truly a great movie.
I:8466;541;bang hollywood goodies to make a great movie.
I:8466;542;Actually, I think Gable is his best in his early films.
I:8466;543;He is a brash know.
I:8466;544;The hitch hiking scene is so good, I put it on my phone.
I:8466;545;When I need cheering up, I watch it.
I:8466;546;There are parts of the movie that are absurd, but it all works so well.
I:8466;547;This was one of those sleepers that ended up winning all the oscars.
I:8466;548;After nearly 80 years, it still wins fans.
I:8466;549;This movie is utterly fantastic!
I:8466;550;Smart, funny, and engaging from start to finish, with terrific performances from Gable and Colbert.
I:8466;551;A classic from director Frank Capra.
I:8466;552;This is my favorite Clark Gable performance: tough and smart on the outside, but a difficult.
I:8466;553;reach tender side, even though he wears his integrity and honesty on his sleeve.
I:8466;554;Colbert is perfect as the classy ditz who's actually witty and intelligent, but she just hasn't gotten out much due to her over.
I:8466;555;These endearing and unforgettable characters will win you over.
I:8466;556;Word of mouth spread the news that this was a film of import and fun.
I:8466;557;It garnered a slew of Oscars including Best Picture, Best Actor for Clark Gable and Best Actress for Claudette Colbert.
I:8466;558;critics of IHON justly call it a magnificent early example of a screwball comedy, and it is surely that, but repeated viewings imbue it with a series of social and economic subtexts that the contemporary audience could relate to.
I:8466;559;The chemistry between Gable and Colbert is so strong that one wonders why they never paired up again.
I:8466;560;Yet,IHON is more than a screwball comedy that permits the lovers to dash in and out of improbable situations.
I:8466;561;If director Capra proves anything it is that true magic does not vary to fit changing economic or social climates.
I:8466;562;IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is truly one of the all time great moments in film history.
I:8466;563;Rich girl always gets what she want and goes through great lengths to get it.
I:8466;564;Transfer was fine as far as I remember (I watched it a month ago), and the set of special features is good, with an interview and a commentary by Frank Capra Jr., as well as subtitles in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai.
I:8466;565;Won 5 Academy awards in 1934: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Screenplay.
I:8466;566;Great comedy of two great actors .
I:8466;567;This is a great classic movie.
I:8466;568;It is funny and fresh change from modern day romantic comedies.
I:8466;569;It is a good story about a girl growing up and finding herself.
I:8466;570;Its a good comedy that family of all ages can enjoy.
I:8466;571;Comedy and romance, this is one gem you won't want to miss!
I:8466;572;Price can't be beat and have enjoyed watching it several times.
I:8466;573;Clark Gable is excellent, and also Claudette Colbert.
I:8466;574;It is one of the best films of the thirtie's.
I:8466;575;I would recommend this film to film lovers who are into comedy.
I:8466;576;This classic is still very funny.
I:8466;577;The chemistry between Gable and Colbert is great.
I:8466;578;This is quite an impressive movie for one made in 1934!
I:8466;579;Lots of clever and edgy stuff.
I:8466;580;This can easily be enjoyed by anyone of any age.
I:8466;581;In It Happened One Night, Frank Capra invented the screen romantic comedy as we know it.
I:8466;582;girl story from the mid.1930s on owes a debt to this graceful, witty, pleasing story of a runaway heiress and a wisecracking reporter who uncovers her secret.
I:8466;583;"his celebration of spontaneity, charity and common friendliness
I:8466;584;talking masculinity and Claudette Colbert's sassy yet wistful delicacy are utterly perfect for this movie, and add immeasurably to its enchanting spell.
I:8466;585;This was the first movie to make a clean sweep of the Best Picture, Director, Actor and Actress Oscars, and it was eminently deserving of that honor.
I:8466;586;Even today the movie seems modern and freshly minted, and it connects better with audiences than any other film of its era.
I:8466;587;I love old movies and this s an oldie.
I:8466;588;Classic actors and a lovely story.
I:8466;589;I remembered loving it then, so I bought it now to see it again.
I:8466;590;It was every bit as good this time, if not better.
I:8466;591;I love it when he sings in the car!
I:8466;592;I love this movie so much!
I:8466;593;this is a very funny movie!
I:8466;594;This is one of the great classic movies, featuring the incomparable Clark Gable, and the irrepressible Claudette Colbert.
I:8466;595;Wonderful comedy with snappy dialogue, clearly.
I:8466;596;drawn characters, and a funny plot that could only be from that special era of movie.
I:8466;597;Claudette Corber is such a great actress
I:8466;598;It is worth the dimmer pictures just to get to see these oldies and watch teenagers appreciate real movies without all the R stuff!
I:8466;599;I was happy to have that happened.
I:8466;600;Although it is in black and white, I enjoyed the film.
I:8466;601;Director Frank Capra's original road trip movie gives us some real gems, not the least of which is watching Ellie hoist her skirt up to passer.
I:8466;602;bys on the open road in order to secure suitable transportation.
I:8466;603;There is some aliasing and shimmering, as well as an almost total loss of fine details during many of the scenes taking place at night.
I:8466;604;The one extra worth mentioning is Frank Capra Jr.
I:8466;605;a snippet in which the son of the director talks about his father and the movie.
I:8466;606;trying to stay ahead of the authorities and away from public transportation, the couple jump from one adventure to another, falling in love on the way.
I:8466;607;Along with Casablanca and a few others, this is a perfect film.
I:8466;608;There's a little bit of everything, but most of all, it's a delightful comedy with just enough double.
I:8466;609;entendre to keep the censors on their toes.
I:8466;610;This is Gable at his height and Colbert at her most enchanting.
I:8466;611;"Just watch it
I:8466;612;It's hard to think of C. g. in a comedy as he is such a powerful man.
I:8466;613;Very enjoyable and good to have in my library.
I:8466;614;I chose this movie because the one I had stopped working right at the end.
I:8466;615;the price was right and we got to see one of the best comedy classics made.
I:8466;616;My elderly mother likes the old movies.
I:8466;617;She loves this one and has played it several times already.
I:8466;618;"The Bottom Line:The first of three films to win the Big 5 Oscars (in addition to One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest and Silence of the Lambs), It Happened One Night is a quick and charming romantic comedy with an assured Clark Gable and a sweet Claudette Colbert in the leads
I:8466;619;And most of the runner.
I:8466;620;ups for oldest film are 1930's screwball comedies inspired by the success of this seminal film which made a clean sweep of the 1934 Academy Awards.
I:8466;621;The genre has held up over the years because these are small human stories with themes that are still relevant.
I:8466;622;"the main reason ""It Happened One Night"" worked then and still works today is the accidental pairing of Colbert and Gable, who provide an amazing chemistry under Frank Capra's direction."
I:8466;623;"Cohn told Capra: ""That French broad likes money"" and Capra finally got her on board with an offer of $50,000 (double her usual price) and a guarantee that production would only last 28 days."
I:8466;624;"the film had a lot else going for it
I:8466;625;while the script is not really successful in convincingly illustrating the process of their falling in love (one minute they are just friends and the next they are in love), Capra is able to sell it with a simple connection process between these two characters which is at work throughout the film.
I:8466;626;"As another reviewer has written: ""Far from lovey."
I:8466;627;dovey, the dialogue is witty, sharp and occasionally heartless.
I:8466;628;"It's also clever, funny and a bit risqu (for 1934)"" ."
I:8466;629;During their three days and nights together Colbert convincingly gives us a character who matures from a spoiled rich girl to a responsible adult, motivated by a desire to improve her companion's opinion of her.
I:8466;630;Gable shows real star presence, playing a confident, charming, and resourceful gentleman.
I:8466;631;By the end their sudden love is credible because they have demonstrated that they are both exactly what the other is looking for in a partner.
I:8466;632;The script is great and the stars do it justice.
I:8466;633;It is fun, and funny, and immediate.
I:8466;634;capra, Gable, and Colbert all at their best.
I:8466;635;This is a must see if you like the old comedies.
I:8466;636;Claudette and Clark are at top game in this classic.
I:8466;637;This is a great Frank Capra film.
I:8466;638;Gable is fantastic and so is his leading lady, who was a bigger star than he was at the time.
I:8466;639;copy is clean and looks much better than others that I had seen.
I:8466;640;I have watched it several times and enjoy having this classic in my collection.
I:8466;641;pleaser, it became the runaway hit of 1934 and swept all four major Oscar categories: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Actress .
I:8466;642;an achievement unmatched for over 40 years.
I:8466;643;"It also won for Best Adapted Screenplay, taken as it was from a short story called ""Night Bus to New York."""
I:8466;644;She is helped in a cross.
I:8466;645;"The sly Connolly is terrific as Ellen's father, and watch for Ward Bond, who played Bert the cop in It's a Wonderful Life, and Alan Hale, Sr., whose son played the Skipper on the ""Gilligan's Island"" TV series, in minor roles."
I:8466;646;This is one of those classics that everyone should see.
I:8466;647;My favorite from the great director, Frank Capra, a fast moving, wittyand well written example of the best from Hollywood's Golden Age.
I:8466;648;The sheer display of high end craft of movie making is exhilarating to watch.
I:8466;649;aT the 1935 Academy Awards it swept for five Oscars for its two stars,best picture of 1934, best director and screenwriter.
I:8466;650;Despite its ageit holds up very well, a terrific study in character, dialogue, good story telling and spot.
I:8466;651;This is a little movie, but so sweet, and back in the day it surprised Colbert + Gable when it won awards.
I:8466;652;It's interesting to look back on the post.
I:8466;653;Going to live with relatives, migrating North to look for work.
I:8466;654;Nowadays the interior of a Greyhound is pretty intimidating.
I:8466;655;Also interesting that the U. s. was still so very green.
I:8466;656;A big, clean haystack will do nicely.
I:8466;657;This one is draped with vines and edged by huge trees.
I:8466;658;In fact, fields and huge trees figure largely in the landscape of One Night .
I:8466;659;The story is great, as are the actors, and I particularly liked the editor of Gable's paper.
I:8466;660;I highly recommend this movie.
I:8466;661;Simply one of the best romantic comedies of all time!
I:8466;662;Gable and Colbert have great chemistry and Frank Capra directed a masterpiece!
I:8466;663;You will simply love this film and watch it over and over again.
I:8466;664;"(so cute)If you can make it through the ""flying trapeze"" song you will be well rewarded."
I:8466;665;loud moments that catch you completely unawares.
I:8466;666;Like the time Peter gives Ellie a good smack.
I:8466;667;Don't know why, but it is quite funny.
I:8466;668;Another reviewer made this sound like abuse, but it really is just funny.
I:8466;669;It will really capture your attention.
I:8466;670;I feel like a kid in the candy store.
I:8466;671;This film has no heavy moral ambiguity but it still has a wonderful portrayal of the human condition in America.
I:8466;672;She learns a little humility and he learns that even the rich and spoiled can be sincere as well as fall in love with a regular Joe.
I:8466;673;This is such a delightful pairing that it's amazing that I've never seen them paired again in other movies.
I:8466;674;Marvelous chemestry exists between them and they are the perfect foil for each other's hard.
I:8466;675;headed assuptions about the other.
I:8466;676;This movie is also a wonderful slice of director Frank Capra's gift for revealing genuine scenes of Americans and Americana.
I:8466;677;Our strengths and our faults ride side by side throughout the odyssey from Miami to New York.
I:8466;678;The strengths win out with a few personal compromises leading to revelations along the way.
I:8466;679;I caught myself smiling by the movie's end.
I:8466;680;It is fun seeing Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert at their ages when the movie was made.
I:8466;681;My wife loves the old movies and this is a great one.
I:8466;682;My views and appreciation of Golden Age films, (espeically black.
I:8466;683;They reviewed it again, but under closer inspection.
I:8466;684;During the following year (in 1935), the film was nominated and had swept the top five major Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay.
I:8466;685;the movie is a true classic, endeared by generations of filmgoers and influencing much of what we see in today's romantic comedies.
I:8466;686;both of whom deliver stellar performances in this film.
I:8466;687;The sparring between these two legendary actors is priceless!Overall, it's a highly recommended film.
I:8466;688;Frank Capra's directing is superb, the cast is terrific, and the crisp, witty dialogue certainly makes this one of the best films ever!
I:8466;689;Without any question, this is one of the classic comedies of film history.
I:8466;690;The performances in this film are among the finest comic roles in the history of film.
I:8466;691;Most of Clark Gable's fame rests on his many hard hitting dramas and action films, but he was amazingly as effective here in a pure comedy as in any of his other films.
I:8466;692;there are as many classic scenes in this film as any you can think of.
I:8466;693;We remember these scenes because they are funny, well.
I:8466;694;Without any question, one of the great films.
I:8466;695;The fact that the movie won the four most important Oscars.
I:8466;696;best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Director.
I:8466;697;Part of the reason is the fact that the movie embodies some very disturbing attitudes towards women.
I:8466;698;He pretty much treats her as if she were a doll.
I:8466;699;He tells her to shut up, and she shuts up.
I:8466;700;In other words, the films reflects social ideas that are part of a world that no longer exists.
I:8466;701;Absolutely a feel good movie.
I:8466;702;It will have you laughing most of the time.
I:8466;703;Great story line and wonderful acting!!
I:8466;704;Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable make a wonderfully romantic couple.
I:8466;705;They are sweet one moment and fightin gin the next.
I:8466;706;It has comedy, drama, romance, and a good storyline.
I:8466;707;Really good, classic, and funny.
I:8466;708;It's a pleasant romantic comedy, with two very attractive leading characters.
I:8466;709;But what the heck the whole is entertaining if you don't think much about anything.
I:8466;710;This movie is a relief from the in.your.
I:8466;711;face sexuality of today's films with its wit and subtle sensuality.
I:8466;712;Clark Gable is a charming fast.
I:8466;713;talker, and Colbert presents the perfect picture of a spoiled heiress.
I:8466;714;It has most definitely withstood the test of time!
I:8466;715;This is a wonderful classic you must have!
I:8466;716;"Highly recommend you also get Jean Arthur's films ""You can't take it with you"" and ""The more the merrier""."
I:8466;717;A real classic romantic comedy for all ages.
I:8466;718;A very enjoyable romantic comedy with an unusual role for Clark Gable, who normally had played great romantic leading man, here plays a drunk, cigar.
I:8466;719;Stop!Peter struggles with his emotions, and when she tells him that she loves him, he tells her callously to go back to bed.
I:8466;720;The train trailing off as she runs to the escape car with hundreds of guests and reporters following her is amazing.
I:8466;721;bottom Line: Funny and at times heartbreaking, the story is a bit dated but at the same time great to see two actors with such chemistry and quick wit.
I:8466;722;this film is now one of my favorite Capra films, along with Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and It's a Wonderful Life.
I:8466;723;A thoroughly entertaining and beautifully acted battle of the sexes comedy classic.
I:8466;724;Gable, who was on suspension from Metro won for best actor.
I:8466;725;It was also the best picture, and Capra won as best director.
I:8466;726;The movie is actually noted for the fact that men's undershirt sales dwindled considerably when Gable revealed his bare chest!
I:8466;727;Although the film has a rather faded, dated air, it remains highly entertaining and strangely magical.
I:8466;728;I have high hopes for the yet.
I:8466;729;"Gable is usual terrific self as Pete Warne to which Ellie says ""Your ego is colassal"" to which Pete replies good naturedly ""Yeah."
I:8466;730;The mock fight scene is terrific as is the classic hitchhiking bit.
I:8466;731;The storyline of the movie is a cute romantic comedy.
I:8466;732;It's still fresh and funny as it was back then.
I:8466;733;I've heard it was a bit of improvisation by the actors, and it's delightful.
I:8466;734;well, you have to see it to believe it.
I:8466;735;will always consider it among my other classic movies .
I:8466;736;This is one of the best movies ever made.
I:8466;737;there are so many good lines.
I:8466;738;The chemistry between Gable and Colbert is strong.
I:8466;739;Pure classic entertainment for the whole family.
I:8466;740;Clark and Claudette make the perfect odd pair thrown together in unusual circumstances and do so much with it.
I:8466;741;Our family laughed so hard at the various scenes, especially at Gables' tirades about Claudette being a rich spoiled brat.
I:8466;742;The whole movie was done so well that each character was completely believable.
I:8466;743;This movie is a must.
I:8466;744;similar to many films at the time, but this one stands the test of time better then most, the witty dialogue is still cunning and smart.
I:8466;745;The story takes off in funny and memorable predicaments for this unlikely couple.
I:8466;746;Both Ellie and Peter are fiercely independent with their personal goals on the line and yet they are forced to completely depend on each other.
I:8466;747;In the meantime, an array of colorful characters including Ellie's father bent on annulling her phony marriage, help make this film a wonderful screwball comedy.
I:8466;748;This Frank Capra film is the original road trip story packed with a fast paced dialogue by Robert Riskin who won the oscar for best screenplay.
I:8466;749;Gable and Colbert also deliver great performances that garnered both of them Academy awards!
I:8466;750;It happened one Night is sheer joy to watch and director Frank Capra is at his best.
I:8466;751;This is a classic scene and a turning point in the story for the two sparring characters who are falling in love.
I:8466;752;It Happened One Night is the first film to win 5 Academy awards including Best Picture.
I:8466;753;"It was released on January 1st, 1934 and after 80 years, ""It Happened One Night"" is still fresh, funny and a classic screwball comedy!"
I:8466;754;I've watched this movie in one of my classes, and I loved it so much that I wanted to own it.
I:8466;755;This movie has very good humor that isn't like it is today.
I:8466;756;Frank Capra made so many immortal and Oscar.
I:8466;757;winning screen classics in the 1930s.
I:8466;758;and classics that really hold up well today even as they speak to Depression America's unemployed working class.
I:8466;759;For starters, it swept the Academy Awards in 1934.
I:8466;760;picture, Capra as Director, Clark Gable as Actor, Claudette Colbert as Actress, and Robert Riskin for Screenplay.
I:8466;761;arranged wedding by her father (Walter Connolly).
I:8466;762;At the same time, Gable's Peter Warne is an unemployed and wise.
I:8466;763;As in all great 1930's screwball romantic comedies, the dialogue is fast paced and the two leads will fall in love.
I:8466;764;a masterpiece of a screwball comedy was created in only a few shooting weeks.
I:8466;765;Imagine the 1934 Academy Awards when EVERYONE won an Oscar!There are so many great scenes here.
I:8466;766;She runs to her side of the room, and he laughs good.
I:8466;767;A bus accident forces Peter and Ellie to hike through a gorgeously photographed moonlit forest and stream.
I:8466;768;It remains funny and memorable after seventy years, as does the whole film.
I:8466;769;Both characters are defiantly independent, so IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT really seems fresh and alive as its principal duo fall in love.
I:8466;770;Films of this type always did, which is why they are still so much fun.
I:8466;771;IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is an immortal and wonderful screen classic.
I:8466;772;This 1934 classic has it all: great writing, direction, stars, character actors, cinematography, you name it.
I:8466;773;luck newspaperman Peter Warren, Gable is at his best.
I:8466;774;Her character is tough, yet vulnerable, spoiled, but lovable, sexy and innocent, and incredibly appealing.
I:8466;775;Filled with classics scenes that are laugh.
I:8466;776;loud funny, this film is balanced by many poignant (Capraesque) scenes as well.
I:8466;777;rate (there's never a dull moment), and the chemistry between the two leads is wonderful.
I:8466;778;But my favorite has to be the bus ride sing.
I:8466;779;"a. long where everyone joins in to sing ""The Man on the Flying Trapeze""
I:8466;780;After almost 70 years, It Happened One Night is as fresh as ever.
I:8466;781;"She is more than set decoration
I:8466;782;A film that truly deserved every Academy Award it received, It Happened One Night is a movie that will live on forever.
I:8466;783;The ending is preposterous but quite satisfying!A classic movie that holds up reasonably well so many years later.
I:8466;784;screen chemistry has the ability to turn a good film into something special.
I:8466;785;Whoever came up with the idea of pairing Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert together in this production certainly earned his or her paycheck.
I:8466;786;rich girl Ellie Andrews (Colbert) runs away from her father so that she can be with her one true love, King Westley (Jameson Thomas).
I:8466;787;It Happened One Night is effectively funny and romantic at the same time.
I:8466;788;way situations Ellie and Peter find themselves involved in is screwball comedy at its finest and the love that develops between them is Hollywood magic at its most charming.
I:8466;789;Colbert and Gable show why they were two of the biggest stars of their era and the chemistry they display on screen still is magnetic to this very day.
I:8466;790;It Happened One Night is also a fascinating cultural text due to its suggestive sexual overtones and its vivid depiction of a woman who is determined to take matters into her own hands when the situation calls for it.
I:8466;791;Both of these aspects are especially noteworthy when one considers the period in which the film was made.
I:8466;792;After all, when you speak of pure cinematic bliss, you speak of scenes like the one where Ellie flashes her thigh to stop an approaching car .
I:8466;793;truly one of the greatest moments ever recorded on film.
I:8466;794;I truly enjoyed this movie and have added it to the few that I keep and watch again.
I:8466;795;It's a very good movie,the kind that is no longer made.
I:8466;796;It's amazing to think that the movie is over 70 years old and is still just as fresh and enjoyable.
I:8466;797;IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is a picture with a fascinating cinematic history (no one except Frank Capra wanted to make it, Gable and Colbert included, and no one thought it would hit or win Oscars, any Oscars .
I:8466;798;It's also one of the few films I've ever seen that is literally without a single dull moment in it .
I:8466;799;surely a rarity, even in the most expensive films (and this one cost all of $375,000 to make in 1934).
I:8466;800;the spoiled runaway heiress who finds true love with the down.
I:8466;801;", Gable, after evading the question, finally answers, ""Yes!"
I:8466;802;Gable's performance here is simply his very best after GONE WITH THE WIND.
I:8466;803;"actor Oscar that year
I:8466;804;He's funny and playful and tender and strong .
I:8466;805;but they will get more than their fill of his very potent charm in this picture.
I:8466;806;colbert plays a fairly thankless part with great elegance and sophistication.
I:8466;807;While acting spoiled and bored and rebellious, she's also charming, funny and perfectly unimpressed with Gable's antics .
I:8466;808;right up to the moment when she realizes she's in love with him.
I:8466;809;all the supporting players (all studio actors) are wonderful, too, even in this essentially two.
I:8466;810;And the roles of Colbert's father and Gable's editor were beautifully filled.
I:8466;811;"No one phoned in their work on this movie
I:8466;812;iT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT, after seventy years, is as fresh and funny as though it were made yesterday .
I:8466;813;IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT will be funny in this century and the next century and every century where men and women meet and fall in love.
I:8466;814;won several Oscars that year.
I:8466;815;Since my husband and I are late seventies, we enjoy the slower pace of comedy in the older movies.
I:8466;816;Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were at there best,I thought, in this comedy.
I:8466;817;the pacing of incidents seems to be the right timing for us.
I:8466;818;This is a wonderful old movie ~ I've watched it several times, and each time I enjoy the subtle nuances, as well as the very obvious nuances, in this sweet romantic movie.
I:8466;819;i'm a huge fan of Clark Gable, and Claudette Colbert is perfect in this part!
I:8466;820;What a sweet, cute funny movie.
I:8466;821;Clean and creative and that is why it is still popular 80 yrs later~
I:8466;822;A must have for any movie library, especially given the awards it won.
I:8466;823;One of the few movies I could watch daily.
I:8466;824;This 1934 comedy is the best love story every released by Hollywood.
I:8466;825;Clark Gable gives one of the greatest performances of his career as a loveable newspaper reporter who helps a runaway heiress(Claudette Colbert) who is trying to escape from an unhappy home life.
I:8466;826;This is one of the most famous movies ever made.
I:8466;827;Everything about this film is perfect.
I:8466;828;You will not find a movie that will entertain you more.
I:8466;829;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:8466;830;The characters are extremely interesting and the movie will amaze you.
I:8466;831;I am sorry but there are very few movies today as good as the ones of yesteryear and this one is supreme!
I:8466;832;"Before Clark Gable frankly didn't give a dawm, he was paired up with lovely Claudette Colbert in the legendary Oscar winning delight ""It Happened One Night"" Winner of Best Actor for the legendary Clark Gable and Best Actress for legendary Claudette Colbert, Best director Frank Capra and Best Picture of 1934."
I:8466;833;It's a fun, delightful and charming romantic comedy, Gable is marvelous and Colbert is irresitable.
I:8466;834;One of the all time greatest american films, # 35 on AFI's list.
I:8466;835;They make a perfect screen couple in the romantic comical fashion.
I:8466;836;Seeing it as the story of his career Warne pursues, but watching her proves difficult given how out of place she is in the depression gripped United States, since she comes from a wealthy family.
I:8466;837;it Happened One Night is clearly the inspiration to many future romantic comedies.
I:8466;838;"Instead of a career ending flop, It Happened One Night would be the first film to get ""The Big Five"" at the Academy Awards (Best Writing, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Picture)."
I:8466;839;This is a great movie!!
I:8466;840;nice for a light happy and funny movie that the whole family can enjoy and watch together!We watched it outside with a large screen with 30 family members and it was great fun!!
I:8466;841;Yes, this film is the one with the famous hitchhiking scene!
I:8466;842;An old black and white movie which is one of the best movies Clark Gable ever made.
I:8466;843;Claudette Colbert is the perfect co. star in this tale of two people who are drawn together under zany circumstances.
I:8466;844;From dislike of each other to falling in love, it's sure to be a love story you will be glad you saw.
I:8466;845;My Mom loves this movie.
I:8466;846;I haven't seen it myself, but my Mon says that this edition was clean, sharp and easily watchable.
I:8466;847;A very simple story written for another time that will cause you to laugh, cry, and, if you're very lucky, remember the way it should be and the way it was.
I:8466;848;A romantic comedy starring greats from another generation, Gable and Colbert.
I:8466;849;This movie took the Oscar home, and more than a couple.
I:8466;850;Every bit the classic it is built to be.
I:8466;851;Gable and Colbert are amazing.
I:8466;852;Clark Gable is at his best, and funniest, as the wise.
I:8466;853;smart New York journalist who stumbles upon the spoiled and precocious Claudette Colbert, a rich kid on the run from her millionnaire father and an unwanted bridegroom.
I:8466;854;Together, Gable and Colbert have the chemistry to make this witty comedy triumph.
I:8466;855;On the contrary, every moment breathes raw sexuality, and eyebrows will be raised more than once, despite the lack of explicit sexual content.
I:8466;856;In an age of cinema when sexual humour is often nothing more than sheer crudity, It Happened One Night is an inspiredly hilarious, masterfully executed and supremely adult sex comedy that knows the difference between humour and vulgarity.
