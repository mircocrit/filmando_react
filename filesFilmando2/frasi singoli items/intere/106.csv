1;Bit rate ranges from high 4's to high 7's.
2;the audio is good too.
3;This isn't the movie you whip out to impress the friends with your setup, but it is very balanced for the feature.
4;:)I've only given a small glance at the extras, but all of them are fairly intriguing, with the Theramin one being a full on lesson on how to best play it.
5;The directors commentary is full of informative facts regarding the production's following reality and how it strays from it for embellishment's sake.
6;The behind the scenes aspect is worth the price, though.
7;Many of you have already written great reviews and have covered a lot of ground.
8;For me the aspect that truly shines in the movie is Johnny Depp's performance.
9;as the greatest film about making movies.
10;I finally got around to seeing this movie recently and found it quite remarkable.
11;An oddball prone to dressing in womens' clothing, Wood is fertile ground for the always.
12;interesting Johnny Depp, who endows his character with great enthusiasm and likeability in spite of his eccentricity.
13;Landau won a deserved Oscar for his effort as the pathetic one.
14;time star, which is alternatingly funny and poignant.
15;One also senses cutting satire behind the story: when Landau's character enters rehab, he remarks that he is the first celebrity to do so, and his comment about there being no such thing as bad press is especially meaningful when a hotel heiress becomes famous for taped romantic escapades.
16;Burton keeps the material interesting and resists the urge to go over the top, and the result is the perfect biopic.
17;I got my movie in the mail way before I expected to get it!
18;It is in great condition.
19;Great movie with an outstanding cast.
20;Just brought back great memories.
21;When this film was released theatrically, a friend and I went to see it because the television ads made it look like a funny film.
22;I'm not sure what my friend thought of the film, but I loved it.
23;It tells the true story (with at least one exception) of Ed Wood .
24;But he comes across as an endearing character due to his enthusiasm and likable persona.
25;this is a great film, especially for Halloween (due to Wood's monster/alien themes).
26;Oh, and the exception mentioned above: in real life, Ed Wood did not meet Orson Welles.
27;Forgot how award winning this movie is and it's award winning too but mostly the most award winning that I know
28;I forgot how much I enjoyed early collaborations between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton.
29;Ed Wood, on the other hand, shows are good they can be when they are both are their best.
30;Easily one of Burton's very best movies and frequently overlooked because of its small scale.
31;His innocence and ineptitude are both touching and persuasive, gradually he builds his team of like.
32;fiends, homosexuals, hucksters, and has.
33;Together they embark upon one crack.
34;the whole thing is just so much fun, and so endearing.
35;Much has been said about Martin Landau's portrayal of Bella Lugosi and he deserves it, it's dazzling.
36;many great supporting performances, especially Patricia Arquette who is infinitely more appealing than her sister.
37;But Burton so clearly loves his characters, and sympathizes with them, that the audience does as well.
38;(another Pop Culture Bad yet great movie!)
39;And before I get started on this review I wanted to give a shout out to my readers (I always check the number] and I wanted to say Thank You!
40;but I've been writing what I want since High school, and I'm still just as happy!
41;but I thought that was one of the funnier parts in the movie.
42;and I did see Dr. Jekle and Mrs. Hide when I was a teenager and it was ALOT of fun!
43;I also liked Landau as Bela Lugosi (an actor I've always liked since I was a kid.
44;And here's the last part of my review that goes with earlier in the movie.
45;where others want to have a normal life I HAVE to have mine be Weird, but I also want my wonderful husband, and our awesome friends and family!
46;Good movie and great acting.
47;Actors played their roles perfectly.
48;He is a versatile actor.
49;His portrayal of the Worst Director of All Time is funny and poignant at the same time.
50;Martin Landau won an Oscar for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi.
51;It is a very fun ride.
52;This movie is very good, if a little difficult to take because it's pretty frenetic, but that's true to how Ed Wood really was.
53;Johnny Depp is his usual brilliant self as Ed Wood.
54;(I know, this surprised me too.)
55;If you are a fan of Ed Wood's loveable trashterpiece films, then this is for you.
56;Johnny Depp does an amazing job in captivating the supreme shlockmeister's overall enthusiasm over what he was doing, which ends up making him look sane while the others who try to talk sense into him come off as dream destroyers.
57;The relationship between young Ed and old Bela Lugosi is quite touching.
58;It's taken me a while, but I can finally agree that Johnny Depp is one of our finest working actors.
59;Now that I've been able to explore his earlier work I can truly understand why the world in general loves him so much.
60;Looking at it all I thought to myself `really, this is who they love'?
61;then a few months ago I saw `Edward Scissorhands' and I was smitten with Johnny's performance.
62;There was this rawness about him, this genuine charm and appeal.
63;Quite honestly I feel that this may be not only Depp's grandest performance, but it may be his best film (and Burton's best respectively).
64;dressing director longing to follow in the footsteps of Orson Welles.
65;His plays are critical flops and his ideas and methods are a bit strange and unconventional, but after a chance meeting with famed actor Bela Lugosi, Wood finally has an edge.
66;Tim Burton and his cast really capture the spirit of 50's film
67;The performances by the entire cast are rich with charisma and charm, especially that of Depp and Landau.
68;Johnny Depp embodies Wood's deep.
69;He had a vision, and even if it was diluted with incompetence it was his vision and he was going to see it come to cultivation.
70;His portrayal of a washed up actor longing to be as loved as he once was is as heartbreaking as it is amusing.
71;Landau won that well deserved Oscar (I personally would have went with Samuel L. Jackson, but Landau is a very close second for me) and truly shines brightly in this very impressive film.
72;the rest of the cast is magic as well, everyone from Sarah Jessica Parker to the always amazing Bill Murray to Jeffrey Jones and Patricia Arquette making an impression on the viewer.
73;like Edward D. Wood Jr., Tim Burton has a vision, and what I appreciate about Burton is that he always stays true to his vision.
74;Sure he was no Welles (one of the greatest cinematic minds of all time) but his story is inspiring, intriguing and extremely entertaining.
75;This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and reading about the extras, it was worht the wait.
76;This is Tim Burton's best movie.
77;It certainly was Martin Landau's finest moment.
78;Bill Murray was at the peak of his sardonic best, pre.
79;Johnny Depp gave a performance that was at once funny and sad.
80;dimensional movie that one suspects started off only as a comedic biography but ended up as one of the best movies of the 90s.
81;A highly entertaining mix of movie.
82;Johnny Depp was terrific and so was Martin Landau.
83;OMG was she soooo sexy.
84;Patricia Arquette was really cute and I liked her character a lot.
85;An often overlooked classic Depp/Burton collaboration.
86;Amazing cast, with great performances by Bill Murray, Martin Landau, Jeffrey Jones, and many others.
87;I mean, really, you have to admire someone who approaches his craft with so much grit and determination and so little talent.
88;it takes an A. grade cast to bring to life this story of Z. grade moviemaking.
89;Johnny Depp delivers a performance of fire in the title role, giving us a lot of insight into the character that Ed Wood was.
90;winning performance) doesn't just portray Bela Lugosi.
91;appreciate too, the film's most memorable line.
92;This is the one I'll be remembered for.
93;You may have never heard about the cineast Edward Wood, Jr, but if you love cinema, this film is made for you.
94;Tim Burton is a great moviemaker and in this picture he is as good as he has never been.
95;He does not hides his adimiration for Ed, and what he brings to screen is a passionate story made by someone who loves it.
96;the cast is nothing but great.
97;Vincent D'Onofrio is as great as usual surprising everyone playing Orson Welles (In a key scene Burton puts together both the worst and the best director chatting in a bar ).
98;And, Martin Landau is so good as Bela Lugosi that one might think he is 'possessed' by Lugosi himself.
99;all in all, it is a great film.
100;It's amazing to see Wood's adventures in order to finish .
101;Another unusual feat in the film is that it's the first of its kind when it comes to making a movie about any movie director.
102;Batman and Edward Scissorhands come to my mind.
103;But this time, Ed Wood is a constant enjoyment from start to finish and probably the only picture I can enjoy from the hands of Tim Burton.
104;Johnny Depp gives one of his best performances of his career in Ed Wood, and I hadn't notice this first time I saw Ed Wood.
105;But the heart of the film is Martin Landau's performance as Bela Lugosi.
106;The heartfelt manner of Martin Landau brings sympathy to his character, and how Bela Lugosi was reduced, a la Sunset Boulevard, from an iconic horror film character to a dope addict is beautifully portrayed in Ed Wood.
107;Questions to whether Ed Wood took advantage of Bela Lugosi for his seemingly star power or was merely helping out by giving him a life to breathe aren't answered in Ed Wood very clearly, but it's a good two.
108;I loved the supporting players especially Jeffrey Jones and Bill Murray.
109;right manner as if he was reading from the large white cards.
110;One beautiful scene, where Ed Wood is sitting during the premiere of Plan 9 from Outer Space, he boldly says, This is the one.
111;This is the one I'll be remembered for.
112;I love Johnny Depp's reaction when his eyes lights up as if he had discovered plutonium or when he goes, Cut!
113;Another great scene, although it never happened during Ed Wood's life, was when he met the great Orson Welles, and the dialogue about his work concerning Citizen Kane and Touch of Evil couldn't be any truer.
114;white pictures were extremely rare to produce during 1990's, the cinematography of Ed Wood is strikingly attractive and easily compares with films from 1950's and before.
115;All in all, Ed Wood is a great film about failure but without any embarrassment
116;Johnny Depp probably gave one of his finest performances in Ed Wood.
117;That was a really good effort from his character.
118;Hands down, the best of the film was Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi.
119;That was the most heartfelt character of the film, and he stole every scene of the film and had the best lines too.
120;He actually made a nice, endearing picture while keeping the elements intact throughout.
121;Undoubtedly, his creativity is there, but he must learn how to not lose the audience at the end like he did with Batman and Mars Attack!
122;All in all, Ed Wood is worth watching for many reasons, but the biggest of all is Martin Landau's winning performance.
123;Johnny Depp loves to take the off.
124;acted and just downright goofy at times, it's totally enjoyable for people who like something a little on the dark side.
125;One of my favorite Depp flicks.
126;One of my all time favorite movies.
127;Director Tim Burton really outdoes himself with this brilliant film about the worst filmmaker ever.
128;But, in his own mind, he thought he was really making great cinematic art.
129;But Good old Ed, god bless his heart, thought he was making 'Gone With The Wind' every time.
130;Martin Landau is on hand delivering a jaw droppingly brilliant performance of old horror star Bela Lugosi.
131;One of the best performances I've ever seen.
132;Bill Murray gives one of his best performances ever as Bunny Breckinridge, an actor of Ed's looking to having a sex change.
133;Landau's own daughter, Juliet Landau, has a part.
134;The film was shot in glorious black and white, and it was a brilliant move on Burton's part.
135;It really adds to the feel of the time and the movies Ed made.
136;He is definitley one of the best actors of our generation.
137;His interpretation of Wood is upbeat and hilarious.
138;Even in the bad times, he still shows Ed having a sunny outlook.
139;This is one great film that did not get great box office returns.
140;I'm telling you right now : this is a great movie to be treasured.
141;The universally acclaimed schlock film director receives an admirable film treatment courtesy of director Tim Burton.
142;What would have been easy to lampoon instead becomes one of the silver screen's most memorable biographies.
143;Burton's sly but conventional interpretation of Hollywood's most unconventional moviemaker provides us with necessary elucidation of this enigmatic legend.
144;This sequence of the film is perhaps the most memorable because of the diametrically opposite forces involved.
145;'Ed Wood' also has one of the best supporting casts you will ever see in a Hollywood film.
146;First I would like to say, that I actually bought this film on a whim.
147;So, as I am writing this review, the film is just finishing and I found it stunning.
148;Johnny Depp gives an exceptional performance as Wood, who after constant disencouragement, does not give up his cause to produce his films.
149;Although it is somewhat of a comedy, it is touching and tender.
150;Although not for all tastes, this film will delight most all who view it.
151;This is a Tim Burton movie about an eccentric B. movie director who loved to wear women's clothing and is now famous for making some of the WORST movies of all time.
152;All of the performances are stellar, and most importantly Johnny Depp's performance as Ed Wood is amazing and manages to carry the whole movie.
153;His inspiring enthusiasm and quirky attitude are a marvel to watch.
154;Also, while the rest of the cast is good, Johnny Depp is almost overshadowed by Martin Landau in an absolutely STUNNING performance as Bella Lugosi.
155;The acting and writing is engaging, and the set design and deliberate black.
156;white color scheme for the whole movie give it a very unique flavor and shows a lot of respect for the black.
157;This is easily my favorite Tim Burton movie, and a really good movie overall that I think everyone should watch.
158;This black and white film by Tim Burton is based on the life (well, principally the 50s career) of Edward D. Wood Jr, the sci.
159;But it still comes across as a Tim Burton film .
160;well, I pretty much forgot it was him at all, he's so convincing as Bela Lugosi!
161;Tim Burton's masterpiece Ed Wood was to be released on February 10th, chock full of special features including commentary.
162;This is Tim Burton saying that no matter how many people don't care about B. horror pictures, he does, and showing us that there can be poetry in them.
163;Ed Wood is a bio.
164;life B. hollywood director Edward D Wood Jr, done in the style of one of his pictures .
165;It has the expression of a comedy .
166;yes, we're asked to laugh at Wood's haphazard way of making pictures, and we can laugh about how terrible the pictures are, but beneath the comedy a great truth is found, and a message Tim Burton is passionate about is expressed.
167;The heart of Ed Wood is really in the character of washed.
168;up Dracula star Bela Lugosi (played to a tee and rewarded with an Oscar, by Martin Landau).
169;This theme of the cruel way Hollywood forgets its greatest talents is also why the name Orson Welles keeps cropping up.
170;It is this determination to succeed, and persist in your work no matter what others think of it that makes Ed Wood (thanks to a terrific fun performance from Johnny Depp) such an important and admirable character.
171;Wood gave him the chance to be in pictures again, symbolising the appreciation of great works, not recent moneymakers.
172;Burton and Martin Landau give the legend of Bela Lugosi his last great performance, turning him into the tragic figure to end all tragic figures.
173;His performance of his I have no home speech set to stirring, haunting music, on the steps of the hospital .
174;all have the tone of appreciating a legend, giving Lugosi his due, saying who gives a [woop] if Hollywood doesn't remember, we remember.
175;Ed Wood has to be one of the most unique and enjoyable films I've ever seen.
176;It includes exceptional performances by Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Martin Landau.
177;In the title role, Depp is amazing and I'm not exaggerating in the least.
178;He made his reputation with us non.
179;as for Martin Landau, who plays Bela Lugosi, his performance practically steals the film from the effervescent Depp.
180;This great character actor certainly deserved his Oscar for this one.
181;This was also the first, and last, time that I enjoyed the work of Sarah Jessica Parker.
182;Lisa Marie is quite sexy as Vampira and more enticing than you could imagine.
183;Ed Wood a man with an endless supply of optimism and it wholly exists for no discernible reason.
184;In his own way, he is an honorable man as he stands by his friends regardless of the cost.
185;His devotion to the has.
186;this film is hilarious at times, especially the scene involving the opening party for Bride of the Monster, which I replayed twice.
187;In summation, it's sweet, full of spirit, and joyful which makes it incredibly easy to recommend.
188;that's just how it is!
189;the moral, if you're going to live, by all means live extravagantly!
190;handedly toted the note for a select studio in town, for years.
191;the story of Ed Wood is the story of Hollywood, itself.
192;and Ed Wood's gift in the end was either his fearlessness or his abject ignorance.
193;johhny Depp brought Ed Wood to life, and credit to Johnny for seeing the infinite possibilties in the script, and Ed's character.
194;the most redeeming feature of the movie was Johnny Depp's absolute sincerity and respect for his character and for the character of Bela Lugosi.
195;see Ed Wood soon.You will be reminded that movies are ultimately about people and their stories, not just special effects, though that was above all else, Ed Wood's preferred domain!
196;ED WOOD is a pure joy to watch, especially for the Ed Wood movie fanatic!
197;Depp embodies the Woodian persona, breathing wild.
198;eyed life into the maestro!
199;This movie is awesome and should be studied in every film school in the world because it tells the story of one man pursuing his dream despite every roadblock in front of him!
200;This is the kind of movie that I like to see Tim Burton make: small budget, artsy, dark, hilarious.
201;Bill Murray also has a very entertaining small role.
202;addicted Bela Legosi, winning an Oscar in 1994 for Best Supporting Actor.
203;Mr Wood, was one of the great film makers of the 20th century.
204;by not working with in the studio systems he was able to make movies that had great appeal his the the only thing that stood in his way was lack of money but he over came and made some classic films the are much loved and enjoyed today.
205;This film pays tribute to this man and I hope inspires youto see his film.
206;This movie is very good.
207;The actors are great, Martin Landau got an Academy Award for playing the old, sick Bela Lugosi.
208;The movie feels very real and it is a fascinating story.
209;inventor, musician, artist, writer .
210;Imagine yourself dedicated to your craft, day after day and year after year putting out what you consider to be your best work in a field that you love only to find, at the end of your life, that you have failed in every way measurable and imaginable.
211;johnny Depp gives a great performance as Ed Wood as he was in the 1950's, starting with his friendship with Bela Lugosi and ending with the premiere of his best remembered film Plan Nine from Outer Space and his elopement with Kathy, who remained his wife for twenty years until his death.
212;At this point in his life Ed's enthusiasm for his work is irrepressible.
213;The genuine friendship between Lugosi (Martin Landau) and Wood is one of the more touching parts of the film.
214;Landau's portrayal of Lugosi is phenomenal.
215;the extra features on this tenth anniversary edition are really pretty good.
216;Tim Burton takes a most affectionate look at oddball director Ed Wood in this movie, and there's much to recommend it.
217;It's shot in lustrous black.
218;There are some absolutely remarkable performances: Johnny Depp gets to show off his formidable acting range yet again, Martin Landau absolutely CHANNELS Bela Lugosi .
219;and in one pleasantly surprising scene Vincent D'Onofrio plays Orson Wells to startling effect.
220;Perhaps what I like most about this film is how Ed Wood is depicted as a director or insurmountable enthusiasm: No matter what pitfalls or tragedies bedevil the production of his films, he maintains a charming optimism that makes him impossible to dislike.
221;And he looks good in angora, too.
222;Despite his best efforts, Ed Wood's name has become synonymous with terrible filmmaking, but now, Tim Burton gives the quirky and ambitious director his moment in the spotlight!
223;ED WOOD is both sad and uplifting, and shows the best and worst sides that Hollywood and stardom have to offer.
224;On top of everything else, his love for angora sweaters and cross.
225;If enthusiasm had only equaled talent, Ed Wood may have become the world's greatest director, and Tim Burton is sure to show it throughout this heartwarming tragedy.
226;johnny Depp stars as Ed Wood in a stylized but highly entertaining exaggeration of the character.
227;He delivers many subtle nuances to the role that make him pitifully naive and endearing at the same time.
228;Depp is joined by a talented cast, including Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette as his two love interests, Jeffrey Jones and Bill Murray as his kooky cohorts, and Martin Landau in an Academy Award.
229;winning performance as the tattered old Bela Lugosi, with whom Wood would share a close friendship throughout his final years.
230;Landau is fully deserving of all critical praise, as he is impeccable in the role and completely indistinguishable from the real.
231;Wood and Lugosi have many common bonds that draw them together, particularly in that they have strong motivations and inspiration, but that they are each critically flawed in numerous ways.
232;the characters are drawn together in a colorful story as Wood brainlessly cons investors into supporting his artless productions.
233;Burton capitalizes on the most outrageous moments of Wood's career, but equally balances the silly humor with dramatic lulls to link the film with reality.
234;Sounds crazy, but Ed Wood is a wacky, sweet, and endearing movie propelled by the incomparable genius of Johnny Depp.
235;It would be easy to make Ed Wood into some kind of lunatic, but through the master touch of Mr. Depp and the skillful direction of Tim Burton, the viewer comes to understand and even empathize with Ed.
236;This movie also has an excellent supporting cast including Bill Murray, Sarah Jessica Parker, and a brilliant portrayal of Bela Lugosi by Martin Landau.
237;The friendship between Bela and Ed is a sweet, endearing thread that is woven throughout the movie.
238;It will easily become one of your favorites!
239;Ed Wood is the very interesting story of the, considered by most, Worst Director Of All Time.
240;It also tells of his struggles to get his movies made.
241;This guy was driven and is really entertaining to watch.
242;It's interesting to see how accurate the crew of Ed Wood was at re.
243;There must have been something very appealing to Tim Burton about the career of film.
244;Making a film about the supposedly worst film director certainly would allow considerable artistic license, for which Burton excels.
245;In this regard , as well as the entertainment value, the film is a great success.
246;Wood had to make considerable compromises due to lack of funds and living in a network of social influence and human frailty, but it is still possible to retain the artistic vision within these confines, in fact that is one criteria for the judgment of the artist
247;It is as fair to judge this film based upon what it says about the artistic process as it is to judge the film based upon its entertainment value.
248;In my opinion, both are very high in this film.
249;switching to a review of the entertainment value, it must be said that the performances of the main characters were superb, the art direction and attention to detail, and the soundtrack by Howard Shore were all excellent.
250;Johnny Depp has the ability to show on his face the ambiguities going on in his mind as he as to compromise, repeatedly, his artistic vision and the constraints placed upon him.
251;overall this is an underestimated film that is both entertaining and acts as a sly commentary on the artistic process.
252;As Ed Wood, Depp touchingly portrays a man who is amazingly unaware of his own breath.
253;Strangely enough, that strikes me as being truly heroic admirable.
254;He has played some off.
255;But unlike the pirate flick, this movie leaves feeling truly touched and moved by the subject matter.
256;Ed Wood is such a gloriously brilliant film.
257;It's the perfect meshing of the unique talents of director Tim Burton and an almost surreal Hollywood story that probably needed to be told.
258;most of what you see in Ed Wood is true, and if Burton bends the tale for his own sensibilities, well, I doubt Mr. Wood is turning in his grave.
259;burton, whose love of old horror films is well documented, was the perfect man to make this movie.
260;The casting choices, most notably Johnny Depp as Mr. Wood, Martin Landau as a decrepit Bela Lugosi and Bill Murray as John Breckinridge, are inspired.
261;burton, filming in black and white with a great eye for detail, has produced a heartfelt anthem to not only the wonder of filmmaking, but to lost souls wishing to create but lacking the gift to do so.
262;Ed Wood is a tribute to sad failures within an unforgiving industry.
263;It's a haunting snapshot, as profound as a Shakespeare tragedy.
264;Burton has given them their fairy tale of glory.
265;Much of our time is spent exploring the relationship between Wood and Bela Lugosi.
266;The plan works perfectly which is great news for Wood and not so great news for everybody else.
267;Burton also uses this film to discuss the idea of directorial control of a film.
268;All of these were excellent films that took risks and challenged the audience.
269;It is a comedic look at the life of the man who's become oficially known as the Worst Director Ever, Edward D. Wood jr.
270;To watch Depp in Edward Scissorhands, then Ed Wood will really give you a feel for how great an actor he is.
271;Martin Landau's protrayal of an aging Lugosi is spellbinding, one of the best of his career.
272;First of all, I will tell you that I was raised in Hollywood in the 1950s and our upstairs neighbor really was the Great Criswell depicted in this film.
273;so I should be more critical than anyone concerning this movie's authenticity, and it is a perfect depiction in my view.
274;This masterpiece by film maker Tim Burton is not only a sensitive, funny and wonderous portrait of Ed Wood, Jr. and his pals, but also a loving tribute to the spirit of the last Great Days of Old Hollywood.
275;The performances by Johnny Depp and the supporting cast is perfection.
276;Visually, this appropriately black and white film takes on the look of those low budget films Ed and many others were making at the time.
277;Even the opening credits AND Howard Shore's INCREDIBLE music score feels accurate to the time and is a joy to hear.
278;enough that he won the Oscar for his performance in this film.
279;this wonderful film HAS BEEN on my personal TOP 10 Greatest Movies of All Time list since I first saw it 10 years ago.
280;I've been a long time fan of Plan 9 From Outer Space, but I never got the chance to see this film.
281;It was entertaining to just see how out of his mind Ed Wood really was .
282;especially when he directs Bela Lugosi (played wonderfully by Martin Landau) to start pulling the Octopus' legs over himself, making it supposedly look like he is being attacked by it.
283;Of course it looks ridiculous, and that's what's great about it.
284;i also liked how this film was not only Ed Wood's life story, but also Bela Lugosi's.
285;I'm a big fan of him too, and it was cool to see the friendship between Wood and Lugosi develop and to see that Ed Wood generally cared for him.
286;i loved the atmosphere created in this film.
287;It totally reflected the time period that Ed Wood's films came out in.
288;And they really got the whole feel of his films down perfectly when we saw him filming them in the movie.
289;And of course the fact that the whole movie was filmed in black and white helps a great deal.
290;the movie was very entertaining overall.
291;I think any audience can enjoy it.
292;the special features are ok.
293;I enjoyed the one on how they made the music.
294;But it did fit in with the style of Ed Wood.
295;Everything else is fairly interesting, and worth a look.
296;is both accurately and poignantly done.
297;Shot in glorious black and white, Ed Wood is a bio.
298;pic that covers Wood's attempts at cinematic greatness.
299;Much of the film depicts the wonderful friendship that Wood established with the fading film star, Bela Lugosi.
300;Burton shows Lugosi in a sympathetic way and actor Martin Landeau is flawless in portrayal of one of Hollywood's early horror stars.
301;(Landeau won an Academy Award for his performance, by the way.)
302;In addition to Johnny Depp's great performance as Wood, other stars make great contributions to the picture.
303;all in all, this is a wonderful film that flows throughout with very few dull spots.
304;It is heartwarming and uplifting to watch Depp show the undying spirit that Ed Wood had for his films and how his next big break is right around the corner (in his mind, anyway).
305;It is hard to describe a movie that has so much humor yet you feel great empathy for its characters.
306;Ed Wood, played by Johnny Depp is living in a world of disillusion and he thinks his films are classics in the making, although nothing could be further from the truth.
307;The same holds true with the Bela Lugosi character played flawlessly by Martin Landau.
308;He gets caught up in this world of B movies and thinks he is part of creating great art, not realizing Ed Wood is a hacker director.
309;His morphine addiction is portrayed very harrowingly and shows a great conflict in the perfect movie world in Ed Wood's mind.
310;Ed Wood is a gloriously atmospheric, black and white love letter to cinema.
311;Tim Burton understands that for the devoted cineaste, the best moments in life have often been spent in a darkened movie theatre being enveloped by a film and becoming one with the environment it creates for two hours.
312;Watching a movie is a form of escape from the harsh realities of the real world and Ed Wood argues that making films can also do the same thing.
313;No one understands and appreciates this devotion to cinema more than Burton.
314;, his films are lovingly crafted homages to the horror and science fiction B. movies that the director enjoyed in his childhood.
315;With Ed Wood, Burton indulges this obsession completely by telling the story of a man who loved to create and watch movies.
316;The Theremin is a look at this unique musical instrument whose signature sound was used in countless science fiction and horror films over the years.
317;Making Bela examines how Rick Baker transformed Martin Landau into Bela Lugosi.
318;The actor talks about his take on Lugosi while Baker speaks about how he got the gig and his approach to Landau's make.
319;He also talks about how he achieved the retro `50s look and his goal of aping the flat look of Wood's movies.
320;Landau introduces the commentary and all of its participants affecting Bela Lugosi's accent and voice, which is a nice touch and gets one in the spirit of the movie.
321;This is an excellent commentary with a lot of detail and insights.
322;finally, there are five deleted scenes that include an insightful bit where Ed has dinner with Tor and his family.
323;Best of all is Bill Murray singing Que Sera Sera with a mariachi band.
324;It went on to win two Academy Awards (one for Landau's performance and one for Rick Baker's make.
325;The movie has also become a favourite of film buffs everywhere, which is rather fitting considering that this is exactly its target audience.
326;I'm a huge fan of Tim Burton films .
327;every one of them has been entertaining in it's own quirky way, and he really seems to know how to bring out the best performances from actors that generally don't impress me a great deal.
328;This is what I love about Burton films, you get so engrossed in the worlds he creates you forget you're watching actors.
329;And the fact that this was based on real life events made this film even more engaging.
330;He is a truly entertaining director.
331;If you love movies AT ALL, you have to see this film.
332;This is probably one of the best films Tim Burton has directed, and one of the best roles ever played by both Johnny Depp (as Ed Wood) and Martin Landau (as Bela Lugosi).
333;Depp in a dress is hilarious, he had all Ed Wood's mannerisms down !
334;The supporting cast was great as well, but Landau was absorbed into his role as Bela Lugosi.
335;Just a masterful work he did.
336;Absolutly the best film ever made!
337;A love letter to filmmakering without any of the spite and cynicism that Hollywood seems to thrive on.
338;The performances in this movie are all 5.
339;Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood and does a wonderful job in the role, but Martin Landau stole the show with his portrayal of Bela Lugosi.
340;I forgot I was watching a black and white movie.
341;Ed Wood struggles and struggles and you keep hoping he will make it big, but you know in the back of your mind that he is never going to.
342;In many ways I would say that it is a wonderful tribute to a man who never gave up on his dream.
343;His persistence and his lack of ability to never make a really good movie has earned him a unique place in movie history.
344;Perhaps not the way he wanted to be remembered, but he is remembered and maybe in the end that's all anyone can really hope for.
345;It is, therefore, somewhat ironic that Ed Wood's life should make such a wonderful movie.
346;ed Wood was also known for something other than being a terrible director: he loved to wear women's clothing.
347;That sense of irrepressible good cheer was Wood's most endearing feature.
348;No matter what happened to him, good or bad, he always took it with a smile.
349;This included his movies, as well.
350;The most unexpected things could occur in a scene and his response would be the same: It's perfect!
351;As good as those aspects of the film are, though.
352;and they are very good.
353;they aren't what makes Ed Wood so special.
354;Seemingly out of nowhere, the most touching part of the film is the friendship that develops between Wood and decrepit former horror film star, Bela Lugosi.
355;Ed loves and reveres him.
356;He gives him work in his movies and tries to take care of him as best he can.
357;Their scenes together are what make this movie so good.
358;throughout his career, director Tim Burton has consistently made remarkable films on the oddest topics imaginable.
359;A definite gamble, but he makes it work.
360;the acting is uniformly good.
361;Johnny Depp is excellent as Wood, doing maybe his best work in film so far.
362;Landau gives the performance of a lifetime, a haunting portrayal of this once great man.
363;Landau's work alone is enough to recommend Ed Wood.
364;Throw in Vincent D'Onofrio's uncanny cameo as a young Orson Welles, and you end up with one of the best films of 1994.
365;This strange but charming movie combines the unique talents of director Tim Burton, star Johnny Depp and co. star Martin Landau to tell the story of Ed Wood, the 50's B. movie director of such now cult classics as Glen or Glenda and Plan 9 From Outer Space, both considered to be among the worst movies of all time.
366;budget productions, all the time being a true friend in every sense of the word.
367;the world of the movie seems to be set in one of Wood's productions.
368;Not many people saw this movie on its first release, but like Wood's pictures, it's become a cult classic, but because it's so good, not because it's so bad it's good.
369;great customor service the exchange i had to do was prompt and recived it by christmas this movie came from lotsa movie
370;ED WOOD is a fascinating film in regards that a truly talented and original filmmaker such as Tim Burton would choose such an inept .
371;this is by far Burton's best work.
372;Shot in crisp black and white, this has actors turning in career best performances.
373;Johnny Depp is perfect as the infamously terrible filmmaker, redeemed only by his will and optimism and an iron ignorance of his own failures.
374;Despite this, Depp's Ed Wood is so likeable that we root for him and his quest for his ever elusive `success'.
375;This is the best performance I have seen him in, and does more to support the theory of Murray as a substantial actor as well as a celebrated comedy actor.
376;One of the greatest talents ever in the history of movies meets Orson Welles!
377;Ed Wood NEVER made a good movie in his life, so how could they make a good movie about his life.
378;The writing, directing and acting are magnificent.
379;This movie is a laugh riot, border line farce you would think, till you understand THAT WAS Wood!!
380;Depp shows he is one of the best actors of today, Martin Landau demonstrate in his later years just was a true craftsman he is.
381;He is funny, sharp and makes you feel so much for the sad actor that faced this bitter end.
382;While this isn't an exceptional movie, it is really interesting and well done.
383;This may be my favorite character Johnny Depp plays ever.
384;Kind of a mix between Hunter Thompson in Fear and Loathing and Edward Scissorhands.
385;It's very funny, but in that general kind of way, not slap stick or outrageous.
386;And its a unique subject matter, and is nostalgic of old movies and film making.
387;Also, Martin Landau's portrayl of Bela Lugosi is great, I don't know how true to life it is, but its a great character regardless.
388;His portrayal of Bela Lugosi is uncanny.
389;the rest of the cast of misfit movie makers is hilarious and sad all at once.
390;i enjoy all the other quirky characters, too, but it's Landau who (in my view) steals the show.
391;i kind of enjoy (and envy) how Ed Wood was always happy, no matter what goes wrong
392;The rumor going around as to why this title has been delayed is so Touchstone Pictures could capitalize on possible wins at this year's Oscars by two of the film's actors: Johnny Depp and Bill Murray.
393;Therefore, the studio can market the film as featuring Oscar Winners Johnny Depp and Bill Murray!
394;Nevertheless, Ed Wood still stands as Tim Burton's greatest film.
395;Perhaps, it's worth the wait.
396;Ed Wood is as funny, and touching, a film as I have ever seen.
397;Johnny Depp shows great skill as the title character
398;After all, the man was voted the Worst Director of All Time, and his masterpiece.
399;Whether or not Wood was a good director (and he wasn't), he lived his life as he wanted to live it and he found more success than most of us ever will.
400;I think that Ed Wood is a testament to the power of believing in yourself, and never giving up on your dreams no matter the odds you face.
401;Lots of people have commented on the genius performance of Martin Landau.
402;The other roles, bigger and smaller, all come off.
403;Excellent casting, filling the roles up with big.
404;wrestler George the Animal Steele is inspired.
405;One of Burton's best films.
406;One of Depp's best films.
407;That said, it took a director of Tim Burton's calibre and an actor as quirky as Johnny Depp to make ED WOOD the delight it is.
408;And Martin Landau, as the washed up Bela Lugosi, is amazing.
409;(On another note, doing the film is black and white was a perfect way to capture the feel of the time, the place, and.
410;Good like a spaceman on his way home.
411;He look back at his spaceship.
412;Yes it is a very comical reflection of Mr. Wood's life, but there is also a real sense of tragedy involved so it's a drama as well.
413;It definitely has the feel of film noir though because of being shot in black and white.
414;I think this movie succeeds since it strikes a balance of all the former mentioned aspects.
415;Arising from Hollywood Babylon, from the depths of evocative cinematic arcana, here we remember Edward D. Wood Jr., one of the most underrated actors, producers, directors of all time.
416;Herein, he is portrayed as a pathos.
417;Lugosi actually took quite a liking to her, even remarking on her ample cleavage.
418;He eventually confesses his penchant at the local spookhouse for dressing in women's clothing, opting to get that out of the way before progressing with the relationship, and she accepts him nonetheless.
419;One of the most humorous lines in the film consists of his friend 'Bunny Breckinridge' {Bill Murray}, who said How do you do it?
420;The black and white format really manages to place one in Noir Hollywood, enhancng the overall storyline in certain classic style.
421;received mainstream filmmaker, the heart of the story is the touching friendship between Ed and Bela Lugosi.
422;excellently acted, written, directed, photographed, and scored, Tim Burton's ED WOOD is certainly the auteur's best, personal works next to VINCENT and EDWARD SCISSORHANDS: all the stories of misunderstood outsiders.
423;Ed Wood is a fascinating figure .
424;and director Tim Burton clearly has a lot of respect for that love.
425;Ed Wood follows the director during the, um, best part of his career, as well as his friendship with the fallen horror actor Bela Lugosi.
426;This is one of the best films that Burton has ever made .
427;a slightly cartoonish tale about an optimistic, energetic man who wouldn't let anything stand in his way.
428;seems to be going well at first, especially since Ed has found love with Kathy (Rosanna Arquette).
429;Ed Wood is a strangely touching movie, especially since it focuses on the early part of Wood's career, before he spiraled into alcoholism and weird porn.
430;This Wood is an enthusiastic optimist who believes deeply in his artistic goals.
431;And his unlikely friendship with Lugosi forms the heart and soul of the movie .
432;There are a lot of hilarious moments (You must be double.
433;And you must be Hungarian), particularly when we see Wood's big picture method of filmmaking.
434;time best performances here as Wood .
435;eyed, eternally optimistic creature who adores film and wants to make glorious schlock himself.
436;There's just something very endearing about his innocent depiction of Wood, and it makes you root for him even though his movies are notoriously bad.
437;but Depp is frequently eclipsed by Martin Landau, who gives a truly heartbreaking performance as Bela Lugosi .
438;and the brilliant performances by Depp and Landau make it a truly beautiful experience.
439;This may not be acceptable to the general public, but a certain director from the 50's named Ed Wood found it to be a likable philosophy.
440;i'm going to be honest right now: I have never seen ANY of Ed Wood's films.
441;Well, I saw the movie straight through, and I found it to be an effective biography.
442;The film itself is shot in beautiful black and white, and the recreations of Ed's sets (as well as 50's Hollywood) seem completely accurate.
443;Johnny Depp and Martin Landau are believable and memorable as Ed Wood and Belo Lugosi.
444;Sarah Jessica Parker, Jeffrey Jones, Bill Murray, George Steele, and everyone else in the film give brilliant performances.
445;As a fan of Tim Burton, I have taken a liking of this movie pretty fast.
446;Maybe it'll grow on me some more after repeated viewing, but for now, I will say that it is one of Burton's greatest, as well as Johnny Depp's.
447;This is an odd one, but it's a piece of his work that goes to show his talents can excell in any job he's given.
448;An easily digestable movie about an unknown Hollywood director that I completely recommend.
449;Depp is typically Depp, quirky and lovable at the same time.
450;He makes it seem easy.
451;I even liked SJP in this movie and that's a rare feat for me.
452;an amusing and touching movie.
453;Ed Wood (1994) is Tim Burton's best all.
454;He followed it up with such disasters as Bride of the Monster, Night of the Ghouls and his masterpiece (so to speak), Plan 9 from Outer Space.
455;He's just so happy to be making movies that he doesn't care that they're awful.
456;He wanted to be a writer.
457;In a way, he succeeded.
458;wood is played magnificently by Johnny Depp.
459;I believe this is Depp's best performance.
460;He is wonderful as the passionate, relentlessly optimistic Ed Wood.
461;He deserved it as much as anyone that year.
462;deserved supporting actor Oscar for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi.
463;Landau's performance is so good that you'd swear Lugosi returned from the grave to appear in the movie.
464;Ed Wood is generally regarded as a comedy, and while it is very funny, it does have many dramatic moments as well.
465;Depp and Landau have some really great, touching scenes together in the movie.
466;Wood was Lugosi's only friend in the latter years of his life and their friendship is at the heart of the movie.
467;The photography and production design are top notch.
468;white photography immensely enhances the old.
469;this is a great movie that is so frequently overlooked among all the great movies that came out in 1994.
470;Anyone who loves cult movies, or just movies in general should see Ed Wood.
471;It's an offbeat, unusual masterpiece that tells a fascinating story about a man who made up for his lack of talent with an abundance of passion.
472;Ed Wood's life was better suited to a movie than he was as a director!
473;Johnny Depp is hilarious as Ed and really plays the part extraordinarily well.
474;Oh Bela, Bela's not dead  indeed!Bill Murray is fantastic in his role.
475;As ever, he has the best lines in this movie.
476;One of the best roles I've seen him inI've seen this film .
477;it must be about nearly 7 or 8 times and it's so funny that some of the lines in it are implanted in my head.
478;This is a great story about a very peculiar director/producer in Hollywood a long time ago.
479;I think Johnny Depp and everybody in it did such a great acting job.
480;But one thing has always set Wood above the pack, and that was his own unshakable faith in his talent.
481;and although this Tim Burton film takes a slew of liberties with the facts of Wood's life and career, it does a remarkable job of capturing them as Wood likely saw them through the filter of his own outrageous ego.
482;the film has two tremendous assets: the performers and its visual style.
483;Johnny Depp leads the cast in the title role, and it is a virtuoso performance, for he entices us to like a man whose self.
484;blindness would normally lead an audience to reject him out of hand
485;as with Wood himself, the film plays fast and loose with the facts of Lugosi's life, but it nonetheless captures something very essential about both Lugosi and the Hollywood that destroyed him, something very elemental that transcends the weird comedy of the piece.
486;dah actor Bunny Breckinridge
487;in terms of visual style, Tim Burton nails the very look of an Ed Wood film in glittering black and white.
488;but working with a budget that Wood never dreamed of he merges it with a series of classic Hollywood idioms that lift the style out of Wood's unfortunately flat style and into the realm of high art.
489;In both look and direction, I strongly feel that this is Burton's single finest film to date.
490;And it is also a film that will register most clearly with those who have actually seen the films on which the movie focuses, so it may not appeal to the uninitiated.
491;But for those who have the right eye, it is a remarkable film.
492;Wickedly funny, unexpectedly touching, extremely memorable.
493;Of course, this is one of the funniest films of the last decade, but what makes it truely outstanding are the more serious aspects, such as the undeniable love to the movie industry.
494;But what makes me give it the whole pack?
495;This film is what seems to be a sea full of fishes that simply are giving the best performances of the whole lives.
496;I mean, just look at the stunning role that Martin Landau does as Bela Lugosi, or the the sheer realistically stunning enthusiasm Johnny Depp has managed to put up.
497;So, what I want you to remember is, that this film is not only great fun, but also a true masterpiece about friendship, respect and love for movies.
498;Everyone interseted in movies should see this film instead of all the sugared tirbutes about the great filmmakers, because even though Ed Wood didn't have the gifts, he had something that every director should always have
499;Tim Burton is truly a genius and an amazing director.
500;Any fan of his should see this film.
501;Not only is it based on a true story of director Ed Wood, but the way the story was written and filmed brings a classic and humorous way to film making.
502;Great film and a MUST see!
503;This movie was so cool!
504;After seeing this movie I became the biggest Ed Wood fan.
505;up and shivered our timbers, Johnny Depp played the infamous Ed Wood, the Worst Director Ever (though his films are undoubtedly entertaining), in frequent collaborator Tim Burton's 1993 biopic.
506;The film is definitely one of both Burton's and Depp's best films, as both show great talent here and care for the subject matter.
507;the film chronicles Wood's many adventures in Hollywood: meeting the incomparable Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau, who won a well.
508;In the end, we care for Ed and really admire his undying devotion to his films and friends, and we realize that he can't really be the worst director ever if he has that much imagination and spunk (hear that, Michael Bay?)
509;the film really has an affection for everyone, and it is that ongoing sense of lightheartedness that makes the film work so much.
510;A very offbeat movie indeed.
511;The oddball characters that Martin Landau and Bill Murray play are quite entertaining as well.
512;The black and white setting works well with the mood of the film.
513;Although the formula tires just a little bit towards the end, the overall impression is a good one.
514;Depp captures the spirit of Ed Wood like no one else ever could.
515;Martin Landau's Bela is perfect
516;Not only is Johnny Depp great in the title roll, but Martin Landau really captures the pathos of the late Bela Lugosi.
517;This movie made me become a B, C, and D movie buff overnight.
518;This movie is long, but it's decent.
519;It's more of a tribute than anything.
520;I'd recommend it, and Johnny Depp is the best part of this film.
521;Martin Landau shines in his magnificent portrayal of Bela Lugosi at the end of his career.
522;A touching tribute to the guy that made the worst movies of all time.
523;This is one of the best biopics I've seen.
524;Tim Burton captures the look and feel of the 1950's perfectly.
525;Johnny Depp is excellent in his role as Wood.
526;Martin Landau is superb as the once.
527;great horror star Bela Lugosi.
528;all in all, this is a great movie about the making of three very terrible movies.
529;Ed Wood's films are truly wretched, but yet, they are memorable.
530;As for the actual film Ed Wood, it's beautifully shot, and the performances here are first rate, with Johnny Depp giving another amazing performance in arguably the most diverse career in Hollywood history.
531;Is there any role that Depp can't play?Landau deserved the Academy Award he got for playing Bela Lugosi, and the rest of the cast is excellent as well.
532;A great film about a wonderfully awful director.
533;Those of us who enjoy Mystery Science Theatre 3000 have already had the chance to enjoy two of Ed Wood's films, one of which, Bride of the Monster, forms a large part of this film.
534;it's clear that Ed Wood was a very odd, very nice, utterly incompetent director.
535;for what it's worth, the screen name I use here (and everywhere) comes from Ed Wood.
536;My next review will be better!
537;johnny Depp is just perfect in this role, Ed Wood would be proud !
538;Johnny Deep gave one of his best preformances in this hilarious and somewhat sad satire about a non.
539;The remarkable thing about this movie is not just quick biopic about a person as said by his collegues, but Johnny Depp actually potrays perfectly the role of Ed Wood at play.
540;How he spoke to actors, his craft, and every thing that shed a bit of light on what Ed Wood was thinking when directing his so. called 'masterpiece.
541;I was easily ammused by the black.
542;the acting was top notch, both from Depp and supporting actor, Bill Murray.
543;I wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made, but it is one of the best i've seen simply because it goes even deeper into Hollywood and exploits the glitz and glamour for what it is.
544;What an amazing, lyrical homage from Tim Burton.
545;But in Wood's mind, played with sincerity and humor by Johnny Depp, he is a true artist because he actually believes that his films are good.
546;A refreshing breeze of naivete in today's world of hyper.
547;and Martin Landau's Bela Lugosi is by turns invigorating and touching as the horror icon made human, and one of the first Hollywood has.
548;excellent performances by all
549;Howard Shore once again delivers an astonishingly poetic and moving musical score, proving that he is one of the most versatile and gifted composers since John Williams.
550;This film, though a comedy, is an excellent bio.
551;His relationship with the aging, virtually forgotten Bela Lugosi is deeply explored, as are his relationships with the family of actors that he employed.
552;Other notable performances are had by Bill Murray and Sarah Jessica Parker.
553;It is a comedy tinged with sadness and triumph, a true film, not just a movie.
554;Bravo to Tim Burton for creating such a masterpiece.
555;have for any movie buff's video library, as it displays the inner workings not only of the actors, but of old.
556;Tim Burton's Ed Wood never hit it big at the box office but has now become a cult favorite, much like its eponymous subject.
557;martin Landau deservedly won an Oscar for his fantastic performance of drug.
558;bill Murray as the flamboyant Bunny steals every scene he's in.
559;the rest of the cast turn in solid performances, with the exception of the typical wooden performance by Sarah Jessica Parker.
560;the Special Edition offers some bonus extras, the most interesting being The Making Of Bela, which goes into detail about the makeup used to transform Martin Landau into Bela.
561;what a fascinating film this was and Depp is fantastically entertaining and funny.
562;I think mere words can't describe his character's childlike enthusiasm and willingness as a director to keep making films.
563;The man who played Dracula was amazing and he said something which I will carry to grave as something that helps understand women so much.
564;I knew it was a fantastic film right then.
565;I recommend being patient with this film.
566;got it because it was a Johnny Depp movie.
567;ED WOOD is a magical piece of moviemaking .
568;a beautiful motion picture fable about a man who made motion picture trash.
569;The production design, performances etc make this an all.
570;Tim Burton really does a good job on directing this movie about Ed Wood.
571;Even if you are not familar with Ed Wood, you will find this movie very enjoyable.
572;What makes this movie even more humourous is the history behind it.
573;The movie is in black and white, which adds to the authenticity.
574;Johnny Depp plays the role well.
575;He achieved with the role of his lifetime that coveted State of art.
576;Instead, we're treated to a more rounded and sympathetic view of the infamous director
577;a lot of the credit must obviously go to Johnny Depp, who infuses Wood with an infectious energy and optimism.
578;Likewise, Martin Landau provides a memorable performance as the ageing, washed.
579;up Bela Lugosi, giving him a real presence and sense of dignity.
580;There are some excellent supporting roles too, with Bill Murray, Patricia Arquette, and Sarah Jessica Parker turning in strong performances.
581;tim Burton really nails the look and feel of the film.
582;white cinematography, Burton really brings out the spirit of Wood in things such as Criswell.
583;You get the sense that Burton is genuinely fascinated with his subject, and that he does have respect for Wood's dedication and independence, if not his talent.
584;`Ed Wood' is an inspired take on Wood and his films, and a very memorable one.
585;This is an excellent, under.
586;rated film that ticks all the boxes: memorable performances, fantastic energy, great direction, and most importantly, an unexpected empathy with its subject.
587;This is one of my most favorite movies.
588;Filmed in glorious black and white, it's so film noir.
589;Campy humor, Bill Murray being the drama queen with classic one liners like, Oh what does that old queen know?
590;There are so many wonderful things in this movie that it's unbelievable.
591;Also, the soundtrack is fantastic.
592;It's just one of those movies that you just have to own.
593;You just gotta have this movie.
594;WAIT, PULL THE STRING, PULL THE STRING!
595;This film has been regarded by many as Tim Burton's best film.
596;one for makeup, and the other one for Martin Landau's grand and touching performance of horror great Bela Lugosi.
597;One of the few people willing to give Lugosi a break was Ed Wood.
598;The performances are very enthusiastic.
599;a funny and sad script that is, for the most part, historically accurate.
600;The film is shot in a historically correct black.
601;white, and the actors, headed by the artistically courageous Johnny Depp, bear an uncanny resemblance to their real.
602;The fact that this wonderful looking and sounding film was not nominated for its score, cinematography or art direction is another mystery.
603;If you haven't seen this film, see it.
604;Tim Burton is a genius.
605;Ed Wood just got another fan!
606;His biopic of the worst director who ever lived (not really: MST 3000 viewers know Coleman Francis is really the worst) captures the period of feel of the 1950s with Stefan Czapsky's moody and crisp cinematography and Howard Shore's excellent tongue.
607;Burton portrays Wood very sympathetically through Johnny Depp's earnest acting: His message is that Wood was an unrecognized genius.
608;Not just the facial mannerisms, the accent, the bombastic acting, are right on, but so is the spirit.
609;Landau literally pours every bit of himself into the role.
610;It's one of the few times the Academy gave the Oscar to the right guy, and Landau deserved it not just for this sterling performance, but for decades of impeccable acting, from North by Northwest, to Tucker and Crimes and Misdemeanors.
611;Ed Wood has just the right light touch for most of its subject matter, which makes it a bonafide popcorn flick.
612;Burton's portrayal of the friendship between Wood and Lugosi was very touching without being sappy.
613;Doubtlessly the most underrated and misunderstood movie in this brilliant director's career .
614;Ed Wood is one of Tim Burton's best movies, right up there with his four timeless masterpieces .
615;it was composed by Howard Shore (`The Lord Of The Rings') instead of Tim's regular partner since the beginning, the brilliant Danny Elfman.
616;It's a camp masterpiece, and essential for Burton fans.
617;And in his skilled hands, the rather messy storyline makes for a wonderful comedy that is absolutely hilarious .
618;but also, at times, touching.
619;his incredible ambition even at the face of repeating failure (.
620;Well, my next one will be even better!)
621;, his childish enthusiasm, his absolute assurance in his `vision' (his wonderful dialogue with Orson Wells) and lack of patience to get it done with (he does one take for every shoot) and his fondness for women's clothing make him a unique and lovely character, and in Johnny's hands he is brought back to life.
622;the rest of the cast is also wonderful, and a great deal effort was put into choosing actors as similar as possible to the real people they're portraying.
623;Best of all is of course the wonderful Martin Landau who does fantastic job as horror superstar Bela Lugosi.
624;wrestler George `The Animal' Steele as Tor Johnson and Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller, as well as all the rest, are terrific.
625;I recommend seeing at least one of Ed Wood's films (preferably `Bride of the Monster' or `Plan 9 from Outer Space') before watching Ed Wood, and that would give you a much better perspective at the film and the characters.
626;It was a good movie that I loved.
627;Tim Burton's style of directing is great.
628;When Burton and Depp partner up, the result is magical and this is no exception.
629;Burton has succeeded in creating a fantastical caricature of the world of Ed Wood, a man whose dream is to make movies.
630;top performance serves to further convey the exuberance and enthusiasm that Wood felt for his desired vocation.
631;And Martin Landau's depiction of the aging and nearly forgotten Bela Lugosi provides some of the funniest moments of the film, as well as the most heart.
632;often overlooked in the library of Tim Burton's work, this film deserves much more respect and appreciation than it has received.
633;In 1994, I was so excited when I heard that Tim Burton was directing a movie based on the Angora happy filmmaking extraordinaire, Ed Wood.
634;But, I was also an aspiring filmmaker and his story was legendary.
635;I highly recommend this movie, as it serves as my Citizen Kane along with the documentary The Haunted World of Ed Wood Jr made just two years after in 1996.
636;The one motivation I will provide, comes from the immortal words of Bela, Pull the strings!
637;Others to whom I have recommended it, who I think will flip for it, find it strange or incomprehensible.
638;Nobody holds up a LAUGHTER!
639;my favorite scene has to be: The cast arriving for the premiere of an earlier Ed Wood film (before Plan 9), at a theater in a very, very rough part of town.
640;played by Martin Landau, who deserved every ounce of that Oscar statue, he might as well have been channeling Lugosi's spirit, his portrayal is uncanny .
641;has a complex relationship with Ed Wood (Johnny Depp).
642;On the one hand, Ed has a genuine love and appreciation of Lugosi's work, at a time when the rest of Hollywood has written Lugosi off.
643;The two of them grow to become true friends and colleagues, with much mutual respect, and Ed cares for an ailing Lugosi and helps him overcome a debilitating drug addiction.
644;On the other hand, all of these positive vibes between the two have a twist added, one that colors their relationship as actor and director, which is that Ed Wood is a total idiot.
645;Whenever I am with a community theater cast, gathered around our review in the local paper, I always think of Ed Wood's girlfriend Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker) looking up from the newspaper to ask, Do I really have a face like a horse?
646;The casting is superb, and the whole atmosphere of the film is perfect right from the word go, with The Great Criswell (Jeffrey Jones) rising from the coffin to deliver his classic, wonderfully overacted introductory remarks, followed by Howard Shore's brilliantly weird opening title music with the funky bongos and the eerily wailing theremin.
647;this totally, wonderfully, brilliant film .
648;will explain it all to you!Johnny Depp is great as Ed Wood, but Martin Landau steals every scene he is in as Bela Lugosi.
649;For true film buffs the Extras are beyond belief.
650;Lets hope that this new release lives up to the first one.
651;Martin Landau's performance (as Bela Lugosi) alone makes this movie great and worth repeat viewings.
652;Add to this Johnny Depp, who is always fantastic, and tons of minor characters played by a collection of colorful actors and actresses, and you get an entertaining, never dull film.
653;The movie is in black and white which turned out to be a perfect choice.
654;The monochrome gives it the atmosphere and feel necessary for the engaging story of the oft.
655;Tim Burton's love for Ed Wood is evident and Johnny Depp's performance makes the viewer love him as well.
656;If you are a Johnny Depp fan this is quite a film to see him hold his role as this complicated real life character Ed Wood.
657;supporting cast Martin Landau and Sarah Jessica Parker and others truly hold up their roles too.
658;but each time i watched a new section i got more deeply pulled in to the characters.
659;I enjoyed everything, from the acting down to the musical score (fans of Dracula will notice that movie's opening theme plays in several scenes).
660;Johnny Depp is a hoot as Ed Wood, and Martin Landau absolutely shines as Bela Lugosi.
661;he certainly deserved the Ocsar he won for the role.
662;the film is by turns hilarious and sad.
663;There are loads of great one.
664;and put a star in it, then you've got something!)
665;and other endearingly funny moments.
666;Landau's portrayal of Lugosi provides most of the pathos, showing us the tragic decline of a man who tried his best to work until the very end.
667;Tim Burton has done a wonderul job with both in this movie.
668;after biopic film about him as well.
669;When he hears for an offer from producer George Weiss (Mike Starr) to join in the production of a gender change film, I Changed My Sex!
670;, Ed decides to take the offer because he likes to don women disguises with pretty much any women's garments, which is hilarious!
671;He meets his childhood Idol Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) and they become friends and Bela joins in the movie.
672;He changed the title of the film to Glen or Glenda with Bela beginning the film with his famous line Pull the String!
673;Filming starts, but is put on hold.
674;As a result of Ed's transvestism and circle of friends, He and Dolores break up after the wrap party.
675;Wells encourages Ed to follow his dreams, finish the movie in his vision, and take action against the producers.
676;This great, underrated, and sought.
677;after movie shows a certain charm to Ed Wood's career.
678;He made his movies super.
679;It is another outstanding film by Tim Burton that rivals Edward Scizzorhands among others.
680;It is really funny and features a message to pursue your dreams and that in terms of movie.
681;white style enhances the mood like one of those early movies from the 40's and 50's and it worked out surprisingly well.
682;It is worth it to learn about one of the underdogs of film history.
683;He makes Ed Wood look like James Cameron!
684;After seeing this movie when I was a kid I was inspired to make home.
685;in the movie Ed Wood is an aspiring film maker living during either the 1940s or 1950s, and he's got the spirit but not the talent.
686;johnny Depp's performance in this movie is awesome.
687;He's really funny in the movie and acting in strange films seems to be his talent.
688;Martin Landau is great as Bela Lugosi.
689;He reveals what exactly was so funny about Bela Lugosi's performance in Glen and Glenda.
690;Martin Landau won an academy award for his performance and rightly so.
691;Bill Murray is also hilarious.
692;The movie Ed Wood is better than any movie that Ed Wood made, and not only that, it is a magnificent movie.
693;I really dont get this i think that Ed Wood is one of the best movies i have watched in a long time.
694;This is one of Tim Burton's best films.
695;So well done and acted on many levels.
696;This is one of my favorite movies.
697;Depp is great as Ed Wood, the B. movie director who exclaims Perfect!
698;martin Landau is utterly convincing as Bela Lugosi, the rest of the cast is perfect, and there's a gigantic rubber octopus as well as Bill Murray as the ruler of the galaxy.
699;This movie is a semi bio picture about the legendary director Ed Wood.
700;Mr. Wood has achieved almost cult status in recent years due to the incredible ineptitude of his films and Tim Burton sets out to explore the man and his movies.
701;Martin Landau gives a powerhouse performance as the Hungarian (Hey!!
702;This suitably quirky, beautifully acted homage to real.
703;And Landau's crabby performance as the ailing, morphine.
704;addled Lugosi won him an Oscar.
705;This is a great movie about the worst director of all time.
706;Martin Landau won best supporting actor of 1994 for his portral of Bella Lagosi.
707;I highly recomend this great biopic.
708;This movie is funny and one you have to see, Tim Burton did a wonderful job as usual with some amazing actors by his side.
709;up comedy, and the film does have comic moments.
710;The friendship between Ed and Bela, and the relationship between Ed and Kathy, was really quite touching.
711;Ed Wood gathered about himself a collection of misfits, called them his friends (and meant it), and did his darn best to make movies.
712;I will say that I liked it, that I think it has been criminally ignored (at least 'till now), and that everyone involved did a great job.
713;I would like to thank L. Phillips, from the Movie discussion forum, for suggesting this film to me.
714;If you're an aspiring filmmaker, you'll probably find them interesting.
715;And this movie is excellent.
716;some of my favorite quotes:1.
717;My favorite quote from the film.
718;There is something remarkably infectious about a man who has a powerful vision, minimal talent, but refuses to give up fighting.
719;burton's direction was perfect, and his recreation of Plan 9 from Outer Space was absolutely hysterical.
720;johnny Depp proved, yet again, his impressive depth as an actor.
721;It conveyed Wood's optimism, as well as his blindness.
722;The Oscar he won for Best Supporting Actor was perhaps one of the most deserving in recent history.
723;Others have already said what's so fantastic about this movie, so I wont say much.
724;it's definitely one of my favorite Tim Burton movies, one of my favorite Johnny Depp movies, and just one of my favorite movies in general.
725;But for any fans of Ed Wood, Johnny Depp, Tim Burton, or just cooky films in general, I highly recommend this movie.
726;This is one of the best American movies of the last 50 years, and certainly one of the very best comedies.
727;granted, the film has been created on Wierdland's back lot .
728;it appears, nevertheless, that comparing Burton's wonderful BATMAN and all his other exciting apparitions, this effort comes off best.
729;It's a category worthy of a book, or even a library or two.
730;And ED WOOD is certainly in that genre.
731;savant of cinema who managed, somehow, to rise to the negative celebrity of The Worst Director Of All Time cult status.
732;fit into the category of American non.
733;costumes, sets, cars and props, but language.
734;The construction of the movie, scene by scene is good, but the dialogue is fabulous!
735;Ultimately, the credit for that little bit of extra something that makes this movie so unbelievably fine, belongs to the writers.
736;OK, but whatever the movie appears to be about, the real meaning is layered: it is an expression of Faith
737;And it exhibits a truly religious faith on one's ability to make Magic.
738;I think this is a really enjoyable movie its very well cast and has a great sense of humor.
739;Depp is great in this movie.
740;Ed Wood takes us back to a time when cinema was made purely for the love of the filmmaking process and makes you feel like you were really there with the Great Ed One Take Wood Jr.
741;I love Tim Burton for this gift of a movie that truly recreates this golden age of HollyWeird a time when Cinema was still art.
742;and it is one of Johnny Depp's best 3 performances to date followed by a flawless cast.
743;Tim Burton's Ed Wood, a surreal bio.
744;pic is one of the most entertaining, inspiring, and funny bio.
745;No wonder really since it's directed by one of the best directors around and written by two of the best bio.
746;It's also got an amazing cast of actors, including Oscar nominee Johnny Depp (Best Actor, 'Finding Neverland'), Oscar winner Martin Landau (Best Supporting Actor, 'Ed Wood'), Sarah Jessica Parker ('Failure to Launch'), Patricia Arquette ('True Romance'), Jeffrey Jones ('Deadwood'), and Oscar nominee Bill Murray(Best Actor, 'Lost in Translation').
747;The movie is kind of close to Ed's heart, because Ed likes to dress in woman's clothes.
748;It's campy and stupid
749;Ed Wood was an interesting, and quirky, guy.
750;which Tim Burton makes perfectly clear here and Depp does a great job bringing Wood to life.
751;Martin Landau gives his finest performance as Bela Lugosi, he disappears behind the persona.
752;Another thing I liked about the film was that it shows us the bright time in Ed Wood's life, through his first film to his masterpiece.
753;This movie is, in the end, a loving tribute to B movies that is over.
754;As I said, the movie is very funny.
755;Especially, Landau who gets some of the best lines as Lugosi.
756;This film is the incredible and entertaining tale of the worst director of all time, which is what makes his work so fantastic.
757;With an all star cast, great writing, and superb directing, this film is sure to both engage and inform film fans.
758;I give this film 4 stars.
759;Ed Wood, with the possible exception of Batman, is Tim Burton's best film.
760;It's a very funny chronicle of the life of the titular transvestite Z. grade film director, focusing on his films with Bela Lugosi ( Plan 9, Bride of the Monster, Glen or Glenda ).
761;Johnny Depp is hilarious as Wood, and Martin Landau is absolutely astonishing as Bela Lugosi, who provides the emotional core that seperates this from most of Burton's work.
762;In addition, the black and white photography is beautiful, and evokes the essence of the period in which Wood's awful movies were made.
763;The image is sharp with hardly any scratches.
764;luckily, the disc is packed with extras.
765;A theatrical trailer and a memorable music video round out the extras.
766;co. uk or Play(Region 2) For my money this is Tim B's best film.
767;It makes the film now flow like chiffon!
768;And a LOT of the new scenes are dealing with or have Landau as Lugosi in them and he is simply brilliant and earned that Oscar.
769;If you like Ed Wood you MUST HAVE this Special Edition!
770;i have loved this film for years and i feel that it's overlooked.
771;the movie is both comic yet sad at times.
772;i recommend it to any burton fan.
773;It's an odd movie, but a well made one.
774;It has that classic black and white movie feel that it strives to achieve while still being on a much more modern topic.
775;The acting is pretty great in this movie.
776;Johnny Depp has always been good though, so I guess it should be no surprise.
777;This is great on two levels.
778;Ed Wood and the terrific job Tim Burton does in portarying a group of very odd people.
779;Tim Burton's 1994 comedy, Ed Wood is a really great film, about an absolutely terrible, film.
780;like fascination with this man and his art.
781;Tim Burton's movie Ed Wood looks at a short, yet very creative period in Wood's life (during the 1950's) in which he created such cinematic non.
782;artist, who is truely inspired to make his dreams and visions come true.
783;z film epics, financed and made.
784;The film shows how the star.
785;Director, Tim Burton has made a really great film about creativity, inspiration and making one's dreams come true.
786;A good example of this is the gentle humor the film bestows apon Ed Wood's unabashedly positive view of his own transvestism and obsession with angora sweaters.
787;The whole cast of the movie is fantastic in their protrayal of these quirky characters.
788;Johnny Depp holds the film together in his great vision of the title character.
789;Kudos also for wonderful, comic acting turns held by both Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones as Wood's proudly eccentric show biz friends.
790;they made me giggle every time they were on screen.
791;But the real scene stealer is actor Martin Landau's mesmerizing protrayal of Bela Lugosi.
792;Finally, mention should be made of Cinematographer, Stephan Czapsky's beautiful, black and white photograpy, which really invokes the old time horror movies of yesteryear.
793;The picture is crystal clear and the sound is well done.
794;This movie is an interesting and humorus look at how we are inspired to create no matter how inept the outcome turns out.
795;Now that I have seen it again for the first time, I immediately went out and bought Wood's box set.
796;Depp is perfect as cross dressing Wood.
797;And my personal favorite: Watch for Murray's speech about his trip to Mexico.
798;pic about the worst director in the history of Hollywood would be one of the best movies ever.
799;Credit Tim Burton and an incredible cast, Johnny Depp and Martin Landeau as Ed Wood and his hero Bela Lugosi have such an incredible chemistry and bond onscreen that is the heart and soul of this film.
800;It's outright hilarious at times, moving and so believable.
801;Bill Murray and Sarah Jessica Parker also shine but the relationship between the faded Lugosi and aspiring Wood makes it so real.
802;regardless, this is the best of Tim Burton's movies that I've seen (about 4 others).
803;I think his work is generally too gloomy and dark, but this was a great movie.
804;beat characters, a good story, and best of all, a recreation of portions of Plan Nine From Outer Space, Ed's infamous really.
805;well acted, funny, and interesting characters from start to finish.
806;Ed Wood (Johnny Depp), is a positive film enthusiast without strong skills in story telling, yet driven to tell the audience his story.
807;Ed's stories display little interest in perfection as they openly display imperfections which eliminate the magically believable moment.
808;In filmmaking Ed might have received an F as he was awarded worst director ever, but as a human he should get an A. Tim Burton decided to film Ed Wood in black and white which vividly enhances the contrast in Ed's character.
809;In addition, the performance by the cast is outstanding as they add phony mood to the film, but it works like magic in this brilliant story.
810;This is Tim Burton's best film and it's a testament to his character and vision that he was willing able to use the credibility he earned in Hollywood after producing such films as Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Beetle Juice and Batman Returns to take a dramatic left turn and produce a biopic about Edward D. Woods Jr., surely one of the worst directors ever (although Michael Bay manages to come close).
811;Johnny Depp plays Wood and his performance is a work of genius, you watch this film and realize that if Wood had had half as much talent as he did enthusiasm he'd be lauded as one of the greats.
812;Depp and Burton have a perfect synergy in this film.
813;The portrayal of the friendship between Wood and Bela Lugosi (played by Martin Landau, who won an Oscar for the role) is brilliant, tender and touching.
814;The film also has a fantastic score by Howard Shore that is worth listening to by itself and which meshes perfectly with the film.
815;they could have included a special doc on the man himself, etc. granted, Martin Landau (and the entire supporting cast) is terrific.
816;Depp does fine, but the writers really should have included more of the story.
817;burton and his writers give you a fairly decent and dignified version of Ed Wood's life, although it may contain more than just a pinch of sugar.
818;i have to recommend it.
819;Some of us, very few of us, will always love that aboutyou.
820;print and anamorphic transfer keep the film's beautiful black.
821;the chief attraction among the extras is the informative and entertaining commentary audio with Tim Burton, Martin Landau, writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, cinematographer Stefan Czapsky, and costume designer Colleen Atwood.
822;All participants contribute well as they chronicle the project from its inception through its development and shooting.
823;Burton and the writers laud Depp's performance.
824;We get Landau's thoughts on characterization, plus good summaries on the casting and the unexpected technical challenges posed by shooting a modern film in black.
825;go oddity uses Howard Shore's main title music straight up and gives it to a Vampira.
826;It's scored with Shore's title theme.
827;rah built in, this one's a welcome change from the usual over.
828;THE THEREMIN Composer Howard Shore gives us a primer on his score and how he used the fascinating 1920s electronic instrument that provided the ghostly oooo.
829;ooo vibe of so many 1950s sci.
830;Theremin expert Mark Segal demonstrates how the instrument is played by moving your hands through the space between two metal rods.
831;MAKING BELA Here's a tribute to Lugosi from Ed Wood's two Oscar.
832;amusing animated menus and the theatrical trailer are here too.
833;Johnny Depp stars as Ed Wood, arguably the worst movie director of all time, in this amusing and at times, touching story of Ed's career in the fifties.
834;Ed was an unparalleled optimist, enamored with movie.
835;fi movies and loved it.
836;depp is extremely likable and sympathetic as the effervescent Wood.
837;His quirky, driven personality and penchant for wearing angora sweaters seem entirely believable.
838;Landau won a Best Supporting Oscar for his portrayal of the washed.
839;up Lugosi
840;Watching Ed throw together a whole movie in a few days is hilarious.
841;this is a sweet, amusing, lightweight tale about a fascinating Hollywood character that may inspire you to see some of his movies.
842;Yes, these are my top 3 movies of all time, and Ed Wood had to be pretty awesome movie to get up there.
843;It's the simpler route to striking an emotional chord among audience members.
844;And Ed Wood is one of the rare, non.
845;It shows the success that sprouts from self.
846;And yet Ed Wood still manages to be an inspiration!So it's easy to call a happy movie cliche.
847;Especially a happy movie with an old.
848;fashioned directorial style (like the scene about Dolores' angora sweaters.
849;But it has deep themes of friendship and it really questions society itself.
850;Plus Johnny Depp is hot.
851;He turns it into a unique comedy, and his chemistry with Burton is nowhere more evident.
852;this movie is funny as hell, time after time, and the scene in the swamp is legendarily hilarious.
853;Landau turns in a bravura turn as Lugosi, and his zeal after getting his swamp fix is somehow one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
854;In any case, here it is, ready to be a bigger cult classic as the decades go by.
855;the extras are great, especially if you are a fan of either Tim Burton or Johnny Depp.
856;bill Murray is great in this film.
857;Johnny Depp always brings a fresh and bold aura to any setting Ed Wood is no exception.
858;This is especially interesting for the movie/history buffs.
859;Quite a stunning film about Ed Wood, who I was honestly unaware of in Hollywood history.
860;Great performances, great characters, story.
861;line was generally good for a biography type piece.
862;What is interesting is that you can still see Johnny when he takes on his roles like they ARE him, yet they aren't like him.
863;Difficult to explain this feeling but this movie truly made me see that.
864;truly great performances by the other magnificent actors too.
865;Bill Murray held his natural sense.
866;humor without acting like he has one, didn't even recognize Vincent D'Onofrio as Orsen Wells, and admired Bela aka Landeu's perfromance tremendously(sp?)
867;Great Johnny Depp film !
868;This is one of the funniest well acted movie I've ever seen, much better than some movies that are out now.
869;'Ed Wood' is clearly Tim Burton's best film.
870;Though it was little seen in it's first release I can clearly recommend it to those who'd like to know more about the Worst filmmaker of all time.
871;Johnny Depp turns in a great performance as the titular director as does the rest of the cast and you'll see why Martin Landau won for Supporting Actor, he becomes Bela Lugosi Rick Baker and Ve Neill's makeup for him transforms him you see Lugosi and not Landau.
872;Brilliantly shot in black and white it's a great transfer to Blu.
873;Well, I finally got around to seeing this movie.
874;I was in fact amazed by how entertaining it was, and how poignant.
875;Martin Landau was brilliant
876;Tim Burton had a knack for picking a perfect cast for Ed Wood.
877;Johnny Depp was good as Ed Wood, the eager film, director,writer,actor.
878;Martin Landau won a well deserved Oscar for his role as Bela Lugosi.
879;I found it touching to see how Ed befriended Bela Lugosi toward the end of that actor's life.
880;tim Burton is good at those off the beaten path movies.
881;this one is a good one.
882;this is a great film.
883;its also johnny depp's best performance ever (in the title role).
884;martin landau won an oscar for his performance as bela logousi, he even bet samuel l. jackson in pulp fiction.
885;If you are a Johnny Depp fan, this is a good one to see how far his range goes yet again.
886;Martin L. is genius in this.
887;Ed Wood, was Tim Burton's best for sure.
888;I enjoyed it from the beginning, which is an introduction like they made in cheap scary movies of these years to the great ending where they tell us everything that happened to the characters after the Plan 9 From Outer Space Premiere.
889;it was funny and touching and I'll never see Edward D. Wood Jr. the same way.
890;He was nice and positive and happy most of the time, and he enjoyed his movies, he really thought his films were great.
891;He is just the opposite of Orson Welles, who made Citizen Kane, the best American film.
892;It represents the story of Edward D. Wood Jr. the best way we could imagine.
893;The fact that the film was in black and white was another good point too.
894;It was funny, smart, and it was not laughing at anyone, even with the main character (the worst director of all time) and that was a good surprise.
895;The kind of film you have to watch over and over again.
896;Not the best film I've seen, but quite a good piece of entertainment.
897;but I realized he played in good films and in this one he did a very good job.
898;Watch it at all costs.
899;i didn't find it in the three first videos I went to, but I finally found it and enjoyed it.
900;and its ofcourse has got Johnny Depp, which makes it all the better
901;this is a very entertaining movie about an unlikely subject: the career of the most decidedly inept movie maker of all time, Ed Wood.
902;Wood may have not been much of a film maker, but the story of his turbulent life with its inevitable ups and downs and never ending stream of resounding cinematic flops made a far better movie than anything Wood managed in Tim Burton's capable hands.
903;although the movie plays fast and loose with some of the facts of Wood's life, it captures the spirit of his life in a way that perhaps the unvarnished truth couldn't.
904;Landau won an Academy award for his performance, and Depp is great as the deluded Wood who just refuses to accept defeat, who comes off as optimistic, charming, and likable in Depp's portrayal, despite the fact that his underfunded and destitute Z movie studio is constantly threatening to collapse around him.
905;the script is clever and contains some very funny one.
906;The cinematography, done in black and white (just like Wood's films), adds a realistic period touch.
907;The musical score is also a nice touch and adds to the film's ambience and mood.
908;Overall a fine film and one that should stand the test of time.
909;As you may notice I did quote Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi in Ed Wood, Tim Burton's masterpiece.
910;ed Wood, tim burton's tribute to this un.
911;i say it: Tim's Best Movie is Ed Wood.
912;why?It's fuuny and it's deep, it makes you think about Hollywood's Studios.
913;it's like a behind scenes look inside Hollywood.
914;i've seen it all!It's quite a good special release, with surprisng bonus features.
915;An splendid doccumentary on how mr Martin Landau prepared for the characterization of Bela Lugosi.
916;i'm glad it's finally here!See you.
917;well, it was a real hoot.
918;The film opened just like a real Ed Wood film, only this film was really interesting to watch .
919;Martin Landau steals the show .
920;for which he won an Academy Award.
921;Martin Landau is the best and his scene stealing makes the movie all that much better.
922;It was worth the wait.
923;I love Tim Burton's movies, that is, all but two.
924;minute feature on cross dressing, which director Tim Burton wanted removed.
925;it's good to have it back again, and this time in the much.
926;the Burton/Depp team hits another home run here, with outstanding performances by the entire cast, especially Martin Landau's Oscar.
927;winning supporting role as Bela Lugosi and Sarah Jessica Parker's star turn as Ed Wood's love interest, Dolores.
928;this is a story that is ultimately as touching as it it quirky and crazy.
929;For those who are fond of Grade Z movies, ED WOOD strikes a remarkably resonant note.
930;Johnny Depp as Ed Wood is convincing as a man whose cinematic vision was obvious only to himself.
931;Depp's interpretation of Wood's monomania for getting the scene filmed in one take captures the inner essence of a man whose own life was run on the same basis.
932;dressing, but the real humor lies in Woods' ability to get his backers to laugh while he convinces them to bankroll his various film projects.
933;Depp is surrounded by terrific supporting help.
934;Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi deservedly won an academy award for supporting actor.
935;The scene in which Depp and Landau reminisce about Lugosi's previous triumphs on screen are both touching and powerful.
936;As Landau speaks, he reaches out with his scrawny fingers in a come hither way that eerily brings to mind Lugosi's penchant for attracting his next victim.
937;Bill Murray and Sarah Jessica Parker are also effective.
938;What makes ED WOOD the superb movie that it is, is Burton's own loving penchant for presenting people who can succeed on their own terms, despite a society that seems determined to thwart their every move.
939;Touchstone has released the technical details on the director's cut for one of my favorite movies ever (that's right, Director's Cut)!
940;this movie is hilarious and inspiring and in fact inspired me to want to become a film.
941;The black and white is perfect for this film, Martin Landua and Johnny Depp give great performances, some scenes are just flat.
942;The featurettes are all solid.
943;Well I finally did and happy because of it.
944;The acting, the story, the cinematography, the music, the sets, the characters, I loved everything about it.
945;The performance from Johnny Depp is phenomenal and confident, but it doesn't stop there.
946;All of the side characters are brilliantly portrayed, my favorite being Bill Murray.
947;And of course Martin Landau's Oscar nominated portrayal of Bela Lugosi is equally heartbreaking and inspiring, proof that sometimes the Academy knows what they're doing.
948;All of the classic Burton elements are here, but in a very subtle fashion that doesn't get in the way of the story.
949;They're so subtle that I had to keep reminding myself throughout the film that it was directed by Tim Burton.
950;It may not be his most original film in the visual sense, but it really is his best film in terms of just overall impact.
951;Although Ed Wood may have the been the worst filmmaker of all time, he sure was an original who loved his work and loved his life.
952;It will leave you inspired and smiling.
953;good acting, good cinematography,funny lines but darnit if Ed Wood didn't make some CLUNKERS in his time.
954;one right after the other.
955;one of my all time favorite Johnny Depp movies.
956;nicely done in black in white about a director, Ed Wood(superbly and awesomely played by Johnny Depp), who is one of the worst directors ever and he gets to work with Bela Lugosi(a great performance by Martin Landau).
957;full of other wonderful cast members with Sarah Jessica Parker, Bill Murray and Juliet Landau(Drusilla on Buffy The Vampire Slayer and who is also Martin Landau's daughter).
958;fun from start to finish.
959;It is Oscar Winner Martin Landau whose performance as Bela Lugosi truly embodies what this movie is all about.
960;Unquestionably good moviemaking, but not necessarily good entertainment.
961;I don't get what is so great about this movie.
962;I LOVE Johnny Depp and I had to force myself to finish this movie.
963;After all, most of the movies I enjoy the most are movies that are panned viciously by said critics.
964;for once, I agreed with the screen snobs and enjoyed this movie just as much as the ones normally dismissed by the critics.
965;johnny Depp is brilliant as the ever optimistic, supremely untalented Ed Wood.
966;It is strange to contemplate the irony that it took such a top notch director, cast and writer to honor someone like Ed.
967;By turns hilariously profane and poignantly troubled, Landau earned his Oscar for this part.
968;In a wacky B. movie Hollywood of the mid 1950's, Johnny Depp is Ed Wood, a young, goofy optimist who dreams of directing movies.
969;A sweet, gentle (and probably fictionalized) bond forms between Wood and Lugosi.
970;johnny Depp is so brilliant in this role, he really captures Wood's naive optimism.
971;Landau easily steals the movie, having won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this role.
972;What ultimately makes this film a masterpiece is the impeccable reproduction and costume design of the 1950s, as well as the crisp black.
973;It really transports you back to those clean.
974;the entire cast is incredible.
975;The music score by Howard Shore is perfect for its period, making much use of the theremin.
976;If you love 1950s B. movies, this film will double as a documentary of how those silly films were made back then, the film functions quite well as a time warp.
977;Ed Wood may be trying to tell a story of how it FEELS to be in the middle of the 1950s more than anything else, and that's what draws so many to the film over and over again.
978;Like American Graffiti, Stand By Me, and Peggy Sue Got Married, this film perfectly captures the images, sounds and attitudes of the era it idealizes.
979;There are also commentary tracks as well.
980;Ed Wood may be both Johnny Depp and Tim Burton's finest hour in the film biz!
981;pic about legendary B. movie icon Ed Wood is marvelously done from every aspect of the craft.
982;However, Mr. Wood's life story is highly intriguing
983;even better we have this film!
984;This is a deeply personal film by Tim Burton, and so he has put a great deal of time and trouble into making it.
985;the acting is superb, the story engaging, and the 'feel' of the movie is unequalled in modern cinema.
986;It makes you feel so much for Ed Wood Jnr.
987;this movie has such a sweetness about it.
988;Ed is such a kind hearted sympathetic guy that you can't help but root for him all the way and cringe when he gets a setback.
989;the film had so many touching moments.
990;johnny was a perfect Ed.
991;I think he captured him perfectly and gave an honest fair portrait of him.
992;another great thing about the movie is it had that total 1950s creepy atmosphere which I absolutely love.
993;One of my favorite Tim Burton films.
994;The story about movie writer and director Ed Wood has all the eccentricities of a Burton movie but is moving and shot beautifully in black and white.
995;He brings such depth to Wood that you root for him all through the film and want him to succeed at what he loves to do .
996;Martin Landau is extraordinary as Bella Lugosi and Wood and he form a wonderful friendship based on knowing the flaws in each other at the same time realizing their tremendous success as artists.
997;This is a very good movie.
998;a great biographical story of Ed Wood.
999;Great performance of all actors and actresses.
1000;Johnny Depp performance is very good.
1001;This movie plays as both a drama and a dark comedy, mixing these elements together really work in this movie and it will have you seriously focused on a scene one second and grinning the next.
1002;This is one of Johnny Depp's earlier roles and it shows that even over 10 years ago this guy was and still is something special.
1003;Every movie I have seen him in he completely changes his look, accent, and mannerisms.
1004;Many of Ed Wood's closest friends said that Depp nailed the part, but Landau got most of the attention and even an Oscar win for his part as Bela Lugosi.
1005;Everything in this movie from the music to the acting is pitch perfect.
1006;This movie is really about a guy who actually knows the meaning of friendship.
1007;the movie is also funnier than heck.
1008;so maybe I'm romanticizing a bit, but it still made quite an impact.
1009;cleverly written, lovingly directed, stylishly shot, actedwith empathy, scored and designed with tasteful camp, ED WOODis a virtual paen to Hollywoodism (whatever the hell THAT is!)
1010;And Tim Burton hits all the right notes flawlessly (for a change).
1011;meaning REAL American movies .
1012;then you should be a fan of this movie, regardless of what you think of Ed Wood's stuff.
1013;was good enough for an Oscar for Landau, so why are we still waiting?
1014;Master of the weird and wonderful (see Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice) Burton shows a remarkable amount of compassion, relating Burton's career up to the premiere of his fabled worst movie, Plan 9 From Outer Space.
1015;His earnestness lifts the movie from what could easily have been made something far more depressing given Ed Wood's spectacular failure with regards to his career.
1016;winning performance, is very impressive indeed as Bela Lugosi, playing his extreme patheticism and drug addiction in a brave and unflattering light.
1017;The rest of the cast are good also, including the novelty of seeing Sarah Jessica Parker as Wood's girlfriend.
1018;Juliet Landau (Buffy The Vampire Slayer's Drusilla) puts in a good turn as one of Wood's leading actresses.
1019;It might not be Burton's most accessible or even most enjoyable picture, but it stands as something of a standout in the genre of the biopic.
1020;It's strange, magnificent, on a grand.
1021;scale, in short exactly what how you can imagine Wood wanting his life to be committed to film.
1022;Too bad because it is one of the best films ever made, with incredible performances by Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, and Bill Murray.
1023;All I can say about this movie is that it is AWESOME.
1024;One of Burton's Best because it's the opposite of his big films yet he still Burton.
1025;A must see and must have!
1026;The team that made this movie is phenomenal and did a tremendous job making this film.
1027;Absolutely brilliant film on the bizarre and quirky cross.
1028;dressing filmmaker Ed Wood, played with boyish enthusiasm by JOHNNY DEPP in one of his most offbeat roles.
1029;He's the anchor who grounds the film in all its believable foolishness.
1030;but it's the caring relationship between Depp and Landau that defines the comic genius of the film and gives it heart.
1031;Both are extremely moving and adept at showing the respect and regard they had for each other when their world seemed to be falling apart.
1032;a near perfect recreation of the '50s Hollywood scene with its low budget studio settings, wisely photographed in the manner of most of the Lugosi thrillers.
1033;Entertaining and genuinely funny, moving and absorbing all the way through.
1034;summing up: One of Tim Burton's best directing jobs.
1035;Anyways these special features are good too.
1036;It's also the first time you see this film in widescreen.
1037;This film can interest you in Ed Wood Jr, I have looked at his films and laughed very very hard.
1038;He is the best at making bad films.
1039;Trust me he is the king at making bad films and this film is very funny.
1040;In black and white and with a deliberately cheesy B. movie soundtrack, this filmvery stylishly recreates the Ed Wood experience on his own terms.
1041;Johnny Depp'sfixed smile and pencil.
1042;Martin Landau gives a great performance as Bela Lugosi, with a very sadnarrative of what happens to actors when their time or genre or character meme hasrun its course.
1043;Very entertaining, but not a little troublingas well.
1044;Continues to hold up over the years due to first rate character acting by a talented cast.
1045;Landau's reaction to the mention of Karloff is one of the best rants ever filmed.
1046;This movie is a highly enjoyable film featuring one of Johnny Depp's best performances.
1047;The supporting cast is excellent as well particulary Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi.
1048;Bill Murray also puts in a hilarious performance as well.
1049;A great cast in an unlikely film about B film master Ed Wood.
1050;The topic may seem a strange one but it sure turned out to be pure movie magic in the end.
1051;I thoroughly enjoyed this look into the life of Ed Wood.
1052;The thing he did best was present this aura that Wood thought everything he did was genius, even though it wasn't.
1053;martin Landau was awarded an Oscar for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi, and that's deservedly so.
1054;Of course I was much younger, but the voice, the facial expression, the movements
1055;This is my absolute favourite film.
1056;It is sweet, funny, sad and uplifting.
1057;The entire ensemble give it their all in this film which is marvelously acted and directed.
1058;I loved it and recommend it to anyone who cares about real, but flawed people.
1059;stream film to begin with.
1060;I know I will have all eyes up for me to say it's a love story (?)
1061;But I have no better way to title this movie.
1062;The fact that he was himself and true to himself.
1063;He stood by the truth.
1064;The fact that he was true to his wife who left him.
1065;He stood for what he was.
1066;With such beautiful script, acting directing how can it be over looked.
1067;Have I been the lucky one, you bet!
1068;For starters call it a comedy with a heart of emotion which still does not justify the movie.
1069;This slow paced comedy might not be for everybody, but film buffs will love it.
1070;Tim Burton brings us this true story, two Oscar winner, about a film director/transvestite who is widely regarded by critics everywhere as the worst filmmaker of all time.
1071;Along the way they manage to pick up the most unusual of characters to help them with their productions.
1072;its wicked good fun, downright hilarious at times and the acting is on top form.
1073;As an actor, Johnny Depp is so talented it is sometimes surreal to watch him do his work.
1074;I recently discovered Ed Wood and it has already become one of my favorite movies of all time.
1075;Legendary actor, Martin Landau, gives a stellar performance as Bela Lugosi.
1076;Martin Landau gives one of the best performances in the history of American cinema.
1077;Landau pulls off the performance beautifully.
1078;Johnny Depp is his usual brilliant self as the ever.
1079;Another very pleasant surprise in this film are the two comic villains in the wood production company: George The Animal Steele as Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson, and Lisa Marie as Vampira, a 1950's Elvira.
1080;They both add a great deal of charm to this film and they both look stunningly similar to the characters that they play.
1081;bottom line: the performances are spectacular, the direction is flawless, and the story is true.you can't make this stuff up.
1082;I like to think of this film as both a comedy of circumstance about Ed Wood, but most of all a tribute to a man who was proud to be in pictures.
1083;My favorite Johnny Depp movie, Ed Wood is a hilarious and (kind of) touching tribute to arguably the worst dramatic director of all time, but a man who stumbled into producing great comedies.
1084;The supporting cast holds up their end, with Martin Landau, in particular, doing a great Bela Lugosi.
1085;Loved the performance by Martin Landau by far.
1086;This is a story about blind enthusiasm, not talent, and it is told with unlimited talent by Tim Burton.
1087;I would only like to stress that this is a story of the heart.
1088;what keeps me coming back to this film is the friendship that develops through the arc of the story between Bela Lugosi and Ed Wood.
1089;It's the heart and soul of the experience.
1090;This is a great movie, very funny, Johnny Deep did a great job, and of corse its a Tim Burton movie.
1091;I watched Ed Wood with my father last summer and we both enjoyed it thoroughly.
1092;It is one of those movies that is brilliant both conceptually and dramatically.
1093;Johnny Depp is always wonderful, and the sense of humor of the film was refreshingly sophisticated (much too rare in contemporary films.)
1094;We laughed so hard we cried.
1095;This is my appeal to the powers that be .
1096;Ed Wood is a portrayl of all of the above, which makes this biopic very appealing.
1097;ed Wood's life could easily by split in many parts.
1098;His homelife, his relationship with Bela, the colorful people he encountered during this time period,and the making of his movies are all portrayed on screen.
1099;Unless your part of the Golden Rasberry Awards, you'll probably end up liking Ed Wood in the movie.
1100;It's also very funny, with outlandish situations to go along with his so bad it's good aura.
1101;What also makes the movie is the way he interacts with many of the people, which often ends in hilarity, with some wit to go with it.
1102;Bela is also hilarious, especially when he gets ticked off after hearing someone compare him to Boris Karloff.
1103;the cast and director really shine.
1104;The cast, with the offbeat Johnny Depp, very hot Patrica Arquette (though she was hotter in True Romance), Bill Murray as a tranny, Sarah Jessica Parker (she's.
1105;she's, okay, she's not as impressive as the others), and Martin Landau.
1106;Actually really well deserved, unlike the best picture of 1994 (REPRESENT!
1107;These characters are really well portrayed, letting you get involved in the life of Ed Wood and the many people who were around with him.
1108;Tim Burton's style of directing (shot in black and white) is suberb, and many artistic flourishes abound.
1109;The other academy award winner, for best makeup, was well deserved, particulary because it made Landau a great recreation of an old Bela Lugosi.
1110;It adds some kind of an insight to the filmmaking process, or something, or at least some humor in it.
1111;Sure, Ed Wood isn't exactly a knockout (hence why it doesn't get five stars), but Ed Wood is easily my favorite biopic, with a topic that you just can't get enough of, and entertaining with some great laughs.
1112;Tim Burton style really cements the movie and makes it a full on fine movie.
1113;Ed Wood is my favorite Tim Burton film as well as my favorite Johnny Depp film of all time, the film where Depp gives his finest performance.
1114;a most convincing portrayal of the man behind such classics as Plan 9 From Outer Space.
1115;All the actors are convincing in their roles as members of director Wood's crew and cast.
1116;delightful in their weirdness and their committment to making it work.
1117;Wood surrounds himself with a crew of misfits and other Hollywood rejects, all of whom are absolutely hilarious.
1118;Wood himself fits right in due to his habit of dressing up in woman's clothing.
1119;The highlight is undoubtedly Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi
1120;The relationship between Lugosi and Wood is quite touching.
1121;The greatest strength of this movie is all the wonderful quirky characters who help Wood make his movies.
1122;floor way, but with a richer and deeper humor that stays with you.
1123;Depp simply shines as Ed Wood, arguably the tiredest director of all time.
1124;while the movie itself is a fun homage to the horrible director, Tim Burton elevates the project by presenting a very touching relationship between the director and actor, Bela Lugosi, brilliantly realized by Martin Landau who more than deserved his supporting actor Oscar for his performance here.
1125;the supporting cast of characters are all superb and this will be a movie that ranks right up there with Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow as shining examples of the pairing of Depp and Burton.
1126;there were MANY very amusing and amazing scenes that were edited out of the original VHS.
1127;It's easy to see why this film is an Oscar winner
1128;Ed Wood isn't for the chronically uptight, but, if you are cool (at all) you will dig it.
1129;Is a wonderfoul movie with a great performance of Jhonny Deep and Martin Landau.
1130;this is another master piece of Tim Burton.
1131;Now that independent film has taken over, and studios are more willing to back them, I think Ed Wood was around at the wrong time.
1132;His simplicity is so endearing, as projected by Johnny Depp (one of our more unappreciated actors).
1133;I find that I put on Plan 9 or Bride of the Monster for sheer entertainment more than most others.
1134;Tim Burton's very loving tribute to the misunderstood Ed becomes a loving dislay of hope, courage and confidence.
1135;Anyone who wants a dream may find it
1136;This came out the same year as Forrest Gump, which seemed to take over the Oscars, but this film has the distinction of winning 100% of it's nominations: only 2, the wonderful make.
1137;up, and Martin Landau's exceptional performance as Bela Lugosi.
1138;Depp is so much fun
1139;bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones are customarily hammy, which is appropriate for the characters.
1140;Especially great is a small cameo from Vincent d'Onofrio as Orson Welles, Ed's all.
1141;This film is nothing but fun, and the black and white photography is totally appropriate.
1142;Tim Burton's wonderful film will dispell that myth.
1143;Ed Wood is as endearing a character as Hollywood ever produced and has the added advantage of being a real life movie maker.
1144;In this wonderful biographical look at Tinsel Towns' most earnest admirer and aspiring film maker Johnny Depp nails the innocent drive that made Ed Wood so well liked by those who knew in their hearts he was a terrible film maker but a noble human being.
1145;depp is astonishing in the scope he gives our simple friend and yet never moves out of the two.
1146;He should undoubtedly have won an Oscar for this role hand in hand with Martin Landau's revelatory turn as Bela Lugosi who lent his gravitas to Ed's ultimate achievement and became his best bud in the process.
1147;This hand in hand turn by two actors is unmatched in any film I've ever seen.
1148;a supporting cast from heaven and script that is both witty yet enlightening toward its subject and superb black and white cinematography will make this a classic to endure and it will be much more appreciated in the future than it ever was in its own time.
1149;it's great fun and you learn something about people, hollywood, and making movies.
1150;But mostly you learn to never give up no matter how great the odds against you.
1151;So many Tim Burton movies have great ideas and beautiful visuals, but somehow go a little flat in the telling.
1152;For example, BIG FISH had some great things to look at, along with a some fun performances.
1153;Burton is the master of visual flair, but he sometimes lets the fun of a good story get forgotten in all the fussiness.
1154;It's one of his best two or three films (I'm thinking EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and the new CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY belong up there too.)
1155;He's got the help of telling a story packed with off.
1156;wall (but real) characters, just like he loves.
1157;Ed Wood, universally acknowledged as the worst director ever, is brilliantly played by Depp.
1158;dressing and Angora sweaters affected his art.
1159;But mostly we see his funny and very touching relationship with Bela Lugosi, a sad old man passed the end of his career and near the end of his life.
1160;unlike so many Burton films, we actually feel real pain and emotion from the brilliant Martin Landau as Lugosi.
1161;Lugosi is enfeebled, but his mind is always lively enough to appreciate what a wretch he has become.
1162;but eventually we see that Wood truly sees Lugosi as a friend too.
1163;Their scenes together are always interesting.
1164;and Landau steals every moment of the film he's in.
1165;His Oscar win was richly deserved.
1166;if you're a fan of Woods' bad movies, you'll really like the incredibly faithful reproductions of scenes from his films, particularly PLAN 9.
1167;depp is very good in the film.
1168;He's a huge bundle of energy and vocal tics.
1169;It's a very mannered performance.
1170;the supporting cast is very good.
1171;Bill Murray is droll, and also has the single best line in the movie.
1172;Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette are quite fine.
1173;the film, in lovely black and white, is a humdinger.
1174;It gives you all the context you need!
1175;The Lugosi special is neat.
1176;A loving tribute to Bela Lugosi and fifties Sci.
1177;fi, I liked thim movie even more the second time.
1178;The first time, I laughed along with everyone.
1179;landau is perfect in a very sympathetic portrayal of Bela Lugosi.
1180;It's amazing how Burton and Landau were able to, quite literally, resurrect Lugosi from the grave.
1181;If you like Lugosi, you'll LOVE this movie.
1182;And that's what makes this such a great film.
1183;the music is utterly fantastic.
1184;That is high praise indeed, but I think the reason Ed won was because of his naive commitment to his work.
1185;in this film, shot in perfectly suited black and white, Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood in the greatest performance of his career.
1186;Depp shines as the eccentric director, and truly brings the character to life in a way that genuinely makes the audience like and appreciate Ed.
1187;The other towering figure in the movie is that of Martin Landau (who deservedly won an Oscar for this performance) as Ed's friend Bela Lugosi, the great man of gothic horror films.
1188;Landau is mesmerizing as Lugosi, and people familiar with Wood's films will be amazed by the uncanny accuracy of his performance.
1189;Through the relationship of these two men, the audience really comes to appreciate Wood's fundamental humanity.
1190;Rarely has there ever been another biopic performance as accurate or powerful.
1191;The sets throughout the film are absolutely perfect, and the interesting thing is how Director Tim Burton made the Wood sets look perfectly shoddy, without making them into a parody.
1192;The lighting and makeup are also perfect (Rick Baker also won an Oscar for makeup) and greatly enhance the period feel of the film.
1193;tim Burton will always have a special place in my heart for thoughtfully casting original Wood regulars Paul Marco, Conrad Brooks and Gregory Walcott in small roles.
1194;That was a greatly appreciated and gentlemanly touch.
1195;There are several making of features (one featuring Johnny Depp in drag in a meat packing plant), the original trailer, commentary from several principals of the film, and a delightful (and extremely strange) music video, directed by, of all people, Toni Basil.
1196;this is a great movie, and from what I have read about Wood, is generally quite accurate.
1197;The entire supporting cast is fabulous (particularly Bill Murray), and they truly manage to capture the essence of the Ed Wood experience.
1198;This is suitable for all audiences except young children.
1199;I recommend this film without any reservations.
1200;This film is at times hilarious, sad, moving, and fascinating.
1201;It is a unique ensemble, from his girlfriend Dorothy (later a successful pop songwriter) and a washed.
1202;knowns who are nonetheless utterly captivating.
1203;the emotional center of the film is the friendship he builds with Lugosi, who is played to perfection by Martin Landau in perhaps the finest performance of his career.
1204;The ride is truly great fun, yet pathetic and full of pathos.
1205;The acting in this in uniformly first rate.
1206;tim Burton is quite a presence in our house, mostly from the kids' side.
1207;This is the first film of his that I liked better than the kids, whose empathy for Wood often held back their laughs.
1208;This is a Must See for anyone who is a Johnny Depp fan .
1209;it contains an excellent cast of characters including Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi and Sarah Jessica Parker as Poodle.
1210;This is a sensitive film about human fallibility amazingly done up in the guise of a comedy.
1211;Johnny Depp's Ed Wood's is terrific.
1212;I have just finished watching 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', Wood's masterpiece.
1213;top jokes, it actually is good.
1214;Seldom has an actor owned a role as thoroughly as this one.
1215;Ever since i saw Ed Wood in October 1994, I was in love with this film!The opening credits which are very creative help set the moodas the film unfolds.
1216;The acting is superb by a great cast ,starring Johnny Depp as Ed, Sara JessicaParker as Ed's girl friend Delores.
1217;the funny Jeffery Jones as the great Chriswell, the hilarious Bill Murray as Bunny!
1218;and the wonderful Patricia Arquette as Kathy Ed's future wife to be.
1219;Tim Burton's best(yet OOP) film casts Burton favorite Depp and the Mission Impossible great Landau(in his best performance).
1220;It makes Wood's already hilarious image and makes it funnier with the image of brilliance they portray him with.
1221;Ed Wood, Jr. is more beloved than reviled as the creative mind behind such grade.
1222;
1223;proclaimed seer, Criswell, are a hoot) and incapable of seeing his own sheer lunacy.
1224;with the first film marking his collaboration with the then well.
1225;Director Tim Burton stocks the film with a well.
1226;In other moments, the film hints at other real.
1227;mostly evangelicals conned into thinking they were financing a religious picture and slowly realize Ed's true caliber as a film maker.
1228;Plunging ahead, the film works to the climax of Ed's career.
1229;An interesting view into the life of ED Wood, the director, who in 1980, was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award as Worst Director of All Time.
1230;i enjoyed this movie, and had to watch it again.
1231;Ed Wood is quite simply Tim Burton's best film.
1232;It's a loving portrayal of the man who wanted more than anything to make it in Hollywood.
1233;Jeffery Jones is also great as Criswell, and is clearly having a lot of fun in the introduction.
1234;Overall, just a great film.
1235;It knows when to go for laughs and when to go for tears, and it's certainly better than anything Wood himself could have done.
1236;Whatever deficiencies Burton's biopic may have as a film are readily compensated for by a subject matter, script, and style so cinematically evocative that the viewer is apt to sense he's seeing many other films at the same time.
1237;Burton captures the fanaticism in every true movie fan, the sheer exhilaration experienced by the lover of movies of every artistic level, the driven exhuberance and enthusiasm that unite the best directors and their audiences.
1238;All visions are worth fighting for, Welles counsels Wood, who takes the advice to heart.
1239;Sharp enough to know the greatness of Kane even in the fifties and smart enough to quote Coleridge's definition of imaginative art as the willing suspension of disbelief, Wood remains oblivious to the fact that his movies are fooling no one.
1240;beat make him a creative and spiritual descendant of Ed Wood.
1241;And Ed, like every great director from Eisenstein to Burton himself, understands the very essence of cinema.
1242;It's not about the reality documented by the camera: it's about the creative, imaginative, inventive mixing and matching of strips of celluloid.
1243;He's energetic, relentless, generous, but never exacting.
1244;making a kind of free.
1245;spirited, carefree vision that disciplined film.
1246;my only reservation about Burton's impressive tribute is the casting of Johnny Depp as Ed Wood.
1247;Depp is a skilled, off.
1248;a common, familiar theme throughout our culture.
1249;As close to perfection as this American life allows.
1250;Anyone alive fifty years ago, who got pulled into the black.
1251;Depp's Ed Wood is a friendly old freak who has every hopeful twitch of the hopeful Fifties vamping on the edge of the age of anxiety.
1252;Mainly because it is his best acting performance to date.
1253;He is amazing in this.
1254;How could you not love anything with Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Sarah Jessica Parker and Ms. Arquette.
1255;geen whiz, you've got yourself a classic.
1256;Aside from the brilliant character Depp creates of Ed Wood, I love the portrayal of Bella Lugosi by Martin Landau.
1257;i saw the mid.90s biopic, Ed Wood and have always wanted to watch it!
1258;Still, Johnny Depp adds depth to his portrayal of the maligned director, his tendency to dress up in women's clothes and his close friendship with Bela Lugosi, whose last performance was in a Wood film.
1259;despite the silliness of the film and its doubtful accuracy, I liked several things about it.
1260;The portrayal by Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi was great.
1261;mouthed yet lovable washed up actor doing his thing, Martin had down so well as to win a Best Supporting Actor Oscar!The actual production of the production of Plan 9 from Outer Space was great.
1262;Rick Baker also was interviewed and gushed how he always wanted to do make.
1263;up on a movie like this and actually would have done it for free.
1264;But if he wanted to portray a strong friendship and both actors going for their dreams, then he achieved a nice piece of cinema.
1265;8.0To begin, it's a well.
1266;It's a damn well made mov, created when Burton had finished his personal Batman Returns, this one on the life of Edward Wood Junior, the worst director ever.
1267;In a way, the message is given by Vincent D'Onofrio in a delicious cameo as Orson Welles.
1268;as Ed, Johny Depp goes quite well, as well as Sarah Jessica Parker as the girlfriend who leaves him, Bill Murray (ultrafunny!)
1269;, Patricia Arquette (very sweet), Lisa Marie Juliet Landau and Jeffrey Jones as the omnipresent Criswell.
1270;Impossible not to sympathise with him, he even won the Oscar (which is quite rare in a Tim Burton mov).
1271;overall, this is a quite entertaining doc mov, and a interesting change on the director's career, that will please fans and nonfans.
1272;I caree about the characters and laughed good.
1273;Also found Ed Wood's life to be interesting.
1274;tempered and enjoyable film which is one of my favorites among Burton's oeuvre.
1275;shot beautifully in moody black and white, the film centers on Wood's most prolific period, when he relentlessly churned out one movie after the next, from his 1953 beyond.
1276;Paying a final tribute to this idiosyncratic director, Burton opts to portray Wood and his misfit menagerie in an overexaggeratedly sympathetic way, not to depict the darker side of his life.
1277;optimistic disposition against all kinds of professional and personal setbacks
1278;the film is hilarious and witty from beginning to end, especially the recreation of certain scenes from Wood's original work (e. g. Lugosi's fight with a flaccid rubber octopus puppet and graveyard scene of Plan 9 From Outer Space) are hysterically funny.
1279;The relationship and chemistry between Wood and Lugosi is the emotional core of the film.
1280;Johnny Depp gives a sympathetic and charismatic portrayal of Wood.
1281;But, this is Martin Landau who really steals the show, and he is the glue that holds the movie together.
1282;His performance is dazzling, conveying the ego, pathos, pride and real dignity of the former horror hero Bela Lugosi.
1283;This is the role which won him Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and he really deserved it.
1284;to me, Ed Wood shows that life is not merely about success, fame or money
1285;Burton portrays Wood as a winner, because he dared to make films yet he had absolutely no gift when it comes to filmmaking.
1286;the wonderful irony of the film is that it won two Oscars with the name Ed Wood written on it :))
1287;Makes you appreciate Ed Wood.
1288;I have seen this movie and absolutely love it.
1289;It is an awesome performance by Johnny Depp and Martin Landau.
1290;This is unfair to toy with customers.
1291;dressing filmmaker could be so enjoyable.
1292;Martin Landau won a much deserved best supporting actor Oscar for his flawless portrayal of Lagosi in this film.
1293;The timing is right on cue and the acting superb.
1294;Knowing that the story is true makes it that much more funny.
1295;and it's definitely watchable more than once.
1296;Rarely have I enjoyed a modern release film as much as Tim Burton's Ed Wood.
1297;like Plan 9 from Outer Space, Bride of the Monster and the unforgettable Glen or Glenda is here used beautifully to recreate 1950's Hollywood as we will never see it again.
1298;Burton's recreation of the production of Plan 9' in particular is memorable with minute attention to detail in making everthing just as it was when this classic' was first made.
1299;what really impressed me however more than anything else was the great affection with which this film was created and secondly by the towering performances of almost all performers involved.
1300;Indeed in this film as portrayed by the wonderful Johnny Depp, Wood comes across as extremely likeable and a fun person to know and work with.
1301;johnny Depp is absolutely awesome as Ed Wood in what I believe is his best performance.
1302;He is wonderfully believable, energetic and funny in the role and I feel this great acting skill that he possesses explains why in my opinion he is one of the most talented and exciting performers in modern Hollywood.
1303;Martin Landau shines in a magnificent performance as the fading and tragic Bela Lugosi who in the last period of his unhappy life made a connection with Ed Wood which forever bought him immortality (some would say infamy!!)
1304;He richly deserved his Oscar for his portayal of Lugosi who comes across as tragic and highly amusing at the same time.
1305;Landau's scenes with Wood are in particular poignant and beautifully done whether they are the scenes of the two of them sitting watching Lugosi's White Zombie together on Halloween or where Wood is helping Lugosi with his drug rehabilitation.
1306;Johnny Depp and Martin Landau's screen chemistry is there for all to see, two remarkable performers in roles perfectly suited to their talents.
1307;They will all have you alternatively laughing, crying and cheering them on.
1308;Each performer is made to look rather eerily like their predessor and for that alone the film is wonderful.
1309;so many wonderful recreated scenes come to mind such as Vampira's late night TV show, Bela Lugosi's hilarious fight scene with a deflated Octopus which will have you laughing out loud, Woods memorable directing style where That was great, cut, print!!
1310;lets move on to the next scene takes on new meanings, and lastly the lengthy recreation of the awful Plan 9 From Outer Space production which is the highlight of this film and will have you laughing till you drop.
1311;These make this film of Ed Wood so remarkable.
1312;johnny Depp of course is the whole centre and spirit of this film and rarely have I liked a performance as much as his in this film.
1313;Johnny Depp is arguably one of the best actors of our time.
1314;The combination of the two make for a terrific movie.
1315;The supporting cast of characters depicts Woods' friends and movie cohorts to a T.
1316;Vampira inspired a young woman to create a character called Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.
1317;The supporting cast is great.
1318;If you like movies by Tim Burton with Johnny Depp, then this is a must see!
1319;Great movie, very funny, and gives good insight on what it was like then to make movies.
1320;This movie might come across as a parody, but it is actually a labor of love.
1321;Filmed entirely in black and white it both mirrors Wood's own work and draws humor from it.
1322;The result is one of my favorite films of all time.
1323;burton splits that finest hair between tragedy and comedy in a manner that is somehow both satirical and loving.
1324;In the end either way, it always brings tears to my eyes
1325;This is the first film I have seen even pertaining to Ed Wood.
1326;A very loving recreation and recollection of a young mans vision to produce, direct, and star in movies.
1327;Martin Landau was excellent as the aged Bela Lugosi whom Wood befriends.
1328;A very heartbreaking picture in which Landau shows how Lugosi becomes a shadow of his former self.
1329;Highly recommended to Wood and Lugosi fans.
1330;Edward D. Wood Jr. certainly had the enthusiasm, if not the talent, to become a film director.
1331;Burton has made a film that is essentially a love letter to the mad genuis that was Ed Wood.
1332;Strong supporting turns by Bill Murray, Jeffrey Jones, George The Animal Steele, Lisa Marie, and Martin Landau in a brilliant performance as Bela Lugosi also help to make the film shine.
1333;All the performers help to faithfully re.
1334;create a simpler era of filmmaking when fly.
1335;Watching Depp play Ed Wood proves to be an insightful venture as we start to realize that Wood's substandard output wasn't due to any lack of trying.
1336;He never reached this goal but his determined spirit to get there created a unique legacy for him in the annals of cinema.
1337;in my opinion, this is one of the best acting performances for Johnny Depp.
1338;He fits perfectly into this character, Ed Wood.
1339;i saw this movie one night, and loved it.
1340;It is quirky, funny, sad, and totally interesting.
1341;Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi is Incredible!
1342;I believe he may have won an Oscar for his role.
1343;There are many celebrities in this film and they all do a great job.
1344;The movie is sometimes a little sad but mostly very, very, funny.
1345;It's also an interesting story about the life of filmmaker Ed Wood Jr.
1346;Best bit of camp and real life ever .
1347;Johnny Depp is our Best American actor.
1348;if you want to see an amazing portrayal of Bela Lugosi by Martin Landau .
1349;quite simply, Ed Wood was an outsider artist, whose medium was film.
1350;in 1994 Tim Burton was the perfect artist to bring Ed's story to the screen.
1351;Burton, recognizing a fellow auteur and genuine oddball, treated Wood, not with derision, but with the respect he deserved.
1352;esque journey in craoyla colors.
1353;The success of that film lead to bigger successes.
1354;Both of those films starred Burton's greatest collaborator, Michael Keaton.
1355;Edward Sissorhands (1990) was a beautifully elegiac, quirky, flawed film.
1356;Batman Returns (1992) was a more personal vision of the Dark Knight in which Charles Dickens yuletide season goes straight to a superhero burlesque hell.
1357;That film remains, to this day, the greatest film incarnation of a comic book character.
1358;Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp are hopelessly polished when compared to the likes of genuine, internalized eccentrics such as Paul Reubens, Lisa Marie and Michael Keaton.
1359;Those two directors were able to draw much more wistful, more nuanced, fully fleshed out performances from Depp.
1360;The renegade spirit was still in full force and Burton had the cast, crew and enthusiasm to do it justice.
1361;Much has been written about Martin Landau's performance, and the accolades are deserving.
1362;Landau would top both of these films, giving the performance of his life, as Lugosi in Ed Wood.
1363;the film itself is, naturally, a mix of fact and fiction.
1364;The world they share together is as unique and special to them as the island of misfit toys is to a Charlie in the Box.
1365;She is right, of course and, thankfully, banishes herself from the Woodian universe to forever disappear in that thick as peanut butter fog of deserved suburban obscurity.
1366;half a century has passed since the premiere of Plan 9 From Outer Space and we are still discussing it and its creator.
1367;Ed Wood briefly was able to inject himself into a few special films, before he began to drown in his rejection.
1368;With Plan 9 From outer Space and Glen or Glenda, Ed Wood and his art are totally inseparable.
1369;Ed Wood's films are art.
1370;Tim Burton pays Wood the highest compliment by following suit.
1371;tim Burton will be remembered, as well, for that period.
1372;the time of Burton's most honest and individual films.
1373;in which he still was able to connect with the misfits and had the ability and clout to make Hollywood and audiences connect as well.
1374;Undoubtedly, Burton will continue to make a plethora of commercial successes
1375;What a pleasant surprise this movie turned out to be .
1376;Much better than I expected, and I expected a lot.
1377;presenting the Ed Wood story in glorious black.
1378;white certainly gives it a more authentic feel, but even more than that, Johnny Depp's performance as Mr. Edward D. Wood Jr. is top.
1379;But this wonderfully produced Ed Wood biography changed my entire outlook completely.
1380;popular yet more controversial transvestite.
1381;definitely worth taking a look at .
1382;which is the main reason I'd encourage anyone over the age of 18 to see this funny and touching biography of one of the worst writer/producer/directors of all time.
1383;But I do it because I like them that much!
1384;This movie deserves every star it gets.
1385;This is another one of those movies that is practically flawless.
1386;This is not only an homage to Ed Wood, but an incredibly entertaining and well casted movie.
1387;Johnny Depp is amazing as Ed Wood and Sarah Jessica Parker is the prettiest I've ever seen her.
1388;the movie begins just before Ed makes his first movie while he is a theater director.
1389;When cross dressing Wood sees that a film about a sex change operation is about to be made, he knows he's the man for the job.
1390;The shock of learning about her husband's transvestitism along with the fact that he has put their lives up on the screen has his girlfriend fuming.
1391;Ed does this and is incredibly rewarded in the end.
1392;Maybe in the future, Depp and cast will do a zany remake.
1393;His enthusiasm is played well by Johnny Depp and he never lets up, just as Ed would have.
1394;Depp is really powerful as Ed Wood.
1395;Let's close this subject right at the start.
1396;these are Z movies and what Wood was able to do on such a limit is really amazing.
1397;while Depp was fantastic, the best performance of the film goes to Martin Landau with his haunting performance of horror legend Bela Lugosi.
1398;Not only did he capture Lugosi's look but also the voice and mannerisms as well.
1399;Landau really captures this, particularly in the scene where he is in the water wrestling with a rubber octopus.
1400;Absolutely histerical!Thank God Tim Burton knew that Wood, while hardly a genius, was a man with unique ideas and skills and brought his story to the screen.
1401;This is one of my favorite movies, Johnny Depp as Ed Wood what a character part!
1402;You've got to give Johnny a lot of credit with this movie, dressing up in woman's clothes and loving it.
1403;Johnny Depp is always taking the unusual parts in movies.
1404;The whole cast was great.
1405;well, that may be pushing it.
1406;It's based on the book, a series of interviews of Ed's friends and associates called something like Nightmares of Ecstacy .
1407;true, the acting was superb.
1408;And Martin did with the academy award for the role, and deserved it!
1409;A buddy of mine broke into explosive laughter when Bela blew up after one of Ed's buddies suggested that he'd played second fiddle to Karloff in one of their earlier flicks.
1410;I thought Sarah Jessica Parker was great too, though I don't normally like her that much.
1411;I think this is far, far more entertaining.
1412;I think it should be considered a classic, in effect an historical documeent.
1413;She was thrilled to receive this for Christmas.
1414;This is Johnny Depps greatest film performance .
1415;this is a another good deal from Amazon for the price.
1416;The blu ray print is fantastic.
1417;It's done in humorous .
1418;the one Tim Burton film you must see!
1419;I've seen Ed Wood about four times and it is one of my favorites.
1420;It's one of those movies that makes you feel so good to be alive.
1421;He finds the most creative ways to solve problems, imagine getting the curch to finance a horror movie!
1422;Famed director Tim Burton directed Johnny Depp in their second collaration, the biographical Oscar winning triumph
1423;Martin Landau brilliantly and terrifyingly portrays the legendary Bela Lugosi, which got him the oscar for best supporting actor.
1424;One of the most extrodonary biographical films among Chaplin, the Aviator and Cinderella Man Johnny Depp's second best film after Pirates of the Caribbean Everyone is very good.
1425;Great picture to watch, came before time, what else can i say johnny depp knows how to pick his movies!
1426;haha I wouldn't sit through it with people who are not exactly pro gay but i mean i loved the movie!
1427;As sometimes happens to biopics, the story is somewhat straightforward and simple.
1428;Landau and Depp are brilliant as Bela Lugosi and Ed Wood.
1429;This movie, about Ed Wood, the director/actor/screen writer is very interesting and of course strange and odd (how could it not be with Tim Burton involved!?)
1430;Now I want to know more about Ed Wood and see some of his movies.
1431;The acting is excellent in this movie and the scenes are wonderfully filmed.
1432;This movie is a real treat for movie buffs and I recommend seeing it.
1433;In this movie you can see why.
1434;All in all this was an interesting movie, especially if you like to know more about Hollywood and the people who have worked there.
1435;Watch it soon and enjoy!
1436;Ed Wood is a classic about a man with a vision.
1437;What's great about Ed Wood is you can actually see how everyone bought into his nutty movie ideas.
1438;It's as much about the friendship and bond between these two men as it is the challenges Wood faced.
1439;It's touching, funny, tragic and dramatic all the best elements for an entertaining and memorable movie.
1440;So, in one of the funniest scenes cut from the movie, part of Wood's cast climbs over the studio fence in the middle of the night.
1441;the entire cast gives a great performance particularly Academy Award Winner Martin Landau as Lugosi.
1442;A brilliant performance that pays tribute to Lugosi and adds humanity to the film, Landau was rightly recognized for with the Oscar and, in a sense, Lugosi was honored as well.
1443;this special edition comes with a number of great featurettes including one that discusses that elusive and popular instrument for science fiction and horror films the teremin.
1444;There's also a discussion from make up ace Rick Baker about his make up design for Landau to transform into Lugosi and how he literally did the film as a labor of love.
1445;scenes footage hosted by Johnny Depp is, at times, hilarious particularly the footage with Depp in drag.
1446;Pie Plates Over Hollywood provides both a nice perspective on Wood, his passion for films and Burton's desire to make the film.
1447;There's also trailers, a music video and a marvelous commentary track by Burton, Landau, writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski as well as other crew members.
1448;The deleted scenes are also pretty darn good and it's clear most were only cut for pacing.
1449;Evidently he felt it wasn't appropriate and poked a bit too much fun at Wood (at least that's what I've heard).
1450;Ed Wood was clearly a somewhat weird man, and this celluloid look at his life is, well, pretty weird.
1451;Well, I promise the next one will be better.
1452;time movie, Ed Wood was able to attract a pretty accomplished cast, and the performances reflect that.
1453;In the tile role, Depp perfectly captures Wood's hopeless optimism and enthusiasm, wearing a perpetual happy smirk even when uttering lines like I like to dress in women's clothing (the scene where Ed appears in drag to reveal his fetish to his girlfriend is absolutely hilarious).
1454;Sarah Jessica Parker is also excellent as Ed's girlfriend Dolores, who tries to stand by her man until she concludes that he and his cronies are wasting your lives making s**t!
1455;The most memorable performance of the movie, though, definitely comes from Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, a washed.
1456;Landau does an amazing job of capturing the tragic essence of his character, who was both pathetic and good.
1457;the movie, fittingly enough, ends with the making and premiere of Wood's defining movie, the stupendously and brilliantly horrible Plan 9 from Outer Space.
1458;Marty Landau portrayed Bela Lugosi and won an Oscar for it.
1459;I knew Maila Nurmi in real life.
1460;And George the Animal Steele, a professional wrestler, played the bald actor made famous in horror movies.
1461;johnny depp once again shows his versatility and depth as an actor of great skill.
1462;martin laneou's performance as lagosi is so perfect i thought at times i was watching bela himself.
1463;this film is total entertainment at it's best.
1464;great performances and brilliant direction as usual from tim burton.
1465;Very interesting study of a person who without a lot of money still chased a dream he was passoniate about.
1466;the answers can be found in this film.
1467;and it is sure to make you LAUGH too!
1468;pretty much sums it up!I felt sympathy for Ed, who seemed like a nice person honestly trying to make a living and doing his best to make something good.
1469;This movie is a tragic, quirky tale about a nice, generous guy who didn't have the money or support to make good movies.
1470;One thing Ed had was heart and although his movies are considered awful, in some ways they are brilliant too.
1471;but Ed's movies are so bad they're good and that is a rare thing!Johnny Depp is amazing in this role.
1472;The movie honors Ed and Johnny is very believable.
1473;Ed Wood will be remembered for making bad movies and this movie is a great homage to him.
1474;If you are a fan of Ed Wood movies you will love this!
