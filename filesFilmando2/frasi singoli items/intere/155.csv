1;Wanted to watch because I just read the book, of course the book is much better but I would still recommend the movie.
2;a mistake?Anyways, besides the movie there's the obligatory 'this is how we made this and we had so much fun making it' featurette, named 'Misery Loves Company'.
3;We get to hear from James Caan, the always lovely and talented Kathy Bates, director Rob Reiner and so on.
4;in addition, there is a SERIES of featurettes discussing 'stalking' which I will list because they are fun to watch:.
5;"also good is the ""Diagnosing Annie Wilkes"" featurette where a psychiatrist explains that Annie was:."
6;tHE MOVIEI love Stephen King, I've read a lot of his work and watched nearly all King.
7;Thanks to Kathy Bates (Oscar for best actress) incredible performance, Caan's showing that he can act and inspired work from director Reiner and photography wizard Sonnenfeld, Misery is one of those few movies that you can watch again and again and never get tired of it.
8;I do watch it every couple of years and, thanks to the Blu edition now, I will enjoy watching the movie even more.
9;rATING THIS EDITIONThis Misery earns high grades for the Blu version.

14;Based on Stephan King's novel and directed by Rob Reiner this thriller will have you shaking in your boots.
15;"Bates is truly terrifying as ""the fan"" no wonder she won the Oscar!"
16;Definitely one to watch, I highly recommend it!
17;pretty good movie, but it definitely not the book.
18;Always been a huge Kathy bates fan.
19;You actually get to see how great of an actress that she is in this movie.
20;Great acting and good story!
21;This was a great movie and one for the personal library.
22;It features a classic mustang, great cinematography that leads you like a page turner.
23;this is another great to come from Steven King.
24;Totally recommend it to people to watch!
25;This is so well written.
26;It really keeps you on the edge of your seat!
27;Kathy Bates plays an obsessed psycho fan very well!
28;You will be on the edge of your seat when you watch this thriller.
29;I ordered this movie for my mother.
30;It is a great movie to watch and Kathy Bates plays a great role in this film.
31;He tells his agent,the ever.
32;stylish Lauren Bacall,that he's going to take a breather in Colorado.

38;The ending will keep you guessing.
39;It's always a chilling experience to watch this movie and I've watched it many times thru the years.
40;Hard to believe that they can take a classic and make it even more chilling!
41;This is one of the best movies I have seen in my life.
42;It is very intense and for anyone who likes Drama movies THIS ONE IS FOR YOU.
43;He gets better each day and finally Annie decides she wants him to stay.
44;I highly recommend this movie for mature viewers and once you finally see this Masterpiece you might understand what I mean when I say She wants him to stay .
45;Not a film I consider a horror movie, more a psychological thriller, `Misery' has got to be one of the most effective psychological thrillers to date.
46;This is thanks in large part to the dynamic Oscar winning (and deserving) performance by the legendary Kathy Bates.
47;In fact, this performance is so dynamic, so convincing that when I first saw this film I was scared sleepless for months it felt (I was merely ten when I saw this movie the first time).
48;Now that I am older I can appreciate this film much more, and while it still manages to deliver chills to my spine I'm not hiding my face in the pillow either.
49;Annie just so happens to be Paul's biggest fan, eccentric as she is, and so he offers to let her read his novel before anyone else has the opportunity.
50;What ensues is a mental game of cat and mouse that is so brilliantly crafted it will have the audience at the edge of their seats.
51;the acting is just brilliant here, Kathy Bates living up to all the hype surrounding her performance.
52;Annie Wilkes truly is one of the best, if not the best female villain created for the big screen and Kathy Bates' delivery is iconic.
53;This is really Bates' movie though, but it's her chemistry with Caan that helps elevate her performance to superiority.
54;The supporting players are also great, especially that of Richard Farnsworth.
55;Rob Reiner also deserves some praise for his superb direction here.
56;He takes Goldman's screenplay (of course adapted from King's masterful novel) and takes off with it.
57;Bates' execution is flawless and continues to add layers to this complex character.
58;`Misery' is one of those rare gems that gets better with time and will never go out of style.
59;I highly recommend this masterpiece to anyone looking for a good thrill, some good performances and overall one heck of a great movie.
60;In my opinion Stephen King has a lot of very remarkable talent.
61;Kathy Bates and James Caan certainly brought the movie to life.
62;They were the perfect actors for the part.
63;there was a lot of talent in this movie.
64;She would yell, and do anything.
65;She did anything to keep him there.
66;I enjoyed this movie as a child and as an adult.
67;She brought Annie Wilkes to life.
68;The actors turned a simple story into a fantastic movie.
69;One of my favorites and Kathy Bates is outstanding in this movie.
70;This morning as part of my annual October Fright Film Fest I saw what may be director Rob Reiner's best movie, MISERY (1990), with Oscar.
71;Recieved this really quickly in the mail, very happy and satisfied customer.
72;This film holds up well.
73;It's both suspenseful and funny, and Bates' Oscar.
74;winning performance is still fun to watch.
75;One of the best psychological thrillers ever made, Misery is a tride and true adaption of the classic Steven King bestseller, white .

77;winning role), who claims she's his number one fan.
78;breaking sequence), and Paul becomes suspicous of her past.
79;From here on it's a tense battle between cat and mouse.
80;Misery appeared to be one of the most thrilling and gripping chillers I've ever seen.
81;The story is so simple you begin to believe it's quite possible.
82;This one in particular, could very well happen.
83;If ever a movie has made me feel as trapped as its protagonist does, Misery stands right up there.
84;"It was an effort just to sit through it
I:21793;85;James Caan and especially Kathy Bates deliver truly spectacular performances as popular (and, to his grudge, commercialised) writer Paul Sheldon and his psychotic """"number one fan"""" Annie Wilkes."""
86;The movie has a justified reputation as a two.
87;actor film, as the twisted relationship the characters share is what makes the movie so memorable.
88;"kind recluse who lives for his novels about female romance hero ""Misery""."
89;She forces him to revive Misery, with a novel written just for her.
90;bates deservedly won an Oscar for her portrayal as the unhinged Annie, who appears on the surface to be the epitome of kindness but is really a ticking time bomb that'll go off, messily, at the least effort.
91;James Caan's performance is wonderful as well as the trapped writer trying his utmost to escape.
92;full of suspense as Sheldon puts his cunning mind to use in how to escape from Annie.
93;what's probably the most frightening of all is how the character of Annie Wilkes shifts from psychotically raged to sweet and giggling, from her loving mother attitude to the devil in a woman's guise.
94;Make no mistake, Misery is a psychological drama of the best degree.
95;It's excellently written and acted, and it'll keep your heart racing to the finish.
96;I liked this movie and was looking to add a blu ray movie to my collection.
97;I read on the net that this is a great blu ray movie and the critics were right.
98;If you are looking for a great looking blu ray movie get this one.
99;I first figure out if I like the movie, then does it look good in blu ray.
100;The portrayal of the toil that this fellow goes through, and the mental outbursts of the woman are better than in the book.
101;A good movie to watch.
102;In reading a little about the movie, this role somewhat revitalized James Caan's career and he delivered a good performance.
103;"Still, I would recommend it to others
I:21793;104;I'm your number one fan.
I:21793;105;She has one little demand .
I:21793;106;And she has ways of making him do her bidding that grow ever more dangerous.
I:21793;107;What is so impressive about this film is that the writers took their time and let the tension slowly build until we learn that Annie is just another madwoman on a mission.
I:21793;108;she beats and coaxes and jostles and tortures and pampers the writer as he begins his odious task.
I:21793;109;A terrific fight and great ending to a movie that remained close to the spirit of the book.
I:21793;110;I love, love, love Kathy Bates in this movie.
I:21793;111;When it was playing in theaters, I was about 14, and I managed to see it at least three times.
I:21793;112;Rob Reiner's direction is competent.
I:21793;113;James Caan's acting is surprisingly subdued.
I:21793;114;but, my God, Kathy Bates is brilliant, playing Annie as someone quirky, scary and even funny.
I:21793;115;Through these scenes, Bates actually builds sympathy for Annie's character, her loneliness, her """"morality"""" and her need to love a fictional character."""
116;kathy Bates has been uniformly great in films ever since this one, but this one is my favorite of hers.
117;I enjoyed this movie from start to finish.
118;Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) is one of the best horror / thriller icons since Hitchcock's Norman Bates, right up there w/ Dr. Lecter!
119;The relationship between captor and captive is hellish, humorous, and increasingly twisted, as Paul tries to stay alive.
120;This is one of best movies made from a Stephen King book.
121;Katy Bates is great (also is great in Deloris Clabourne)and so is James Caan.
122;Misery is one of the best, creepiest films out there.
123;A classic Stephen King story that becomes a nail.
124;Best thing about this film is that it is a very plausible story!
125;Both Cann and Bates exectute their roles in this film flawlessly.
126;Misery Chastain will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish, I promise you.
127;This movie is a pure classic.
128;It has excellent acting, and edge.
129;seat story, AND it's based on a book by Stephen King.
130;While she starts out as an excentric heroine, she gradually becomes one of the most terrifying beings ever to grace the screen.
131;invented slang is so hilarious, it'll have you quoting it for life.
132;the most eerie thing about this movie is how every act of evil performed by Bates is (in her mind) an act of love.
133;"She really cares for her ""special guest"", and wants him to feel the same way."
134;That's all she really wants.
135;There is a reference to this movie's most frightening sequences.
136;This movie is packed full of mean.
137;In my experience, James Caan and Kathy Bates best film.
138;Intense and at times funny .
139;That's why I bought it.
140;"Annie Wilkes, his ""number one fan"", and former nurse."
141;and it captures the isolation of the setting of the movie, she's the best .
142;I had never seen her before and really loved her speech.
143;So I made it a point to be sure and watch Misery as soon as it hit cable.
144;Kathy's performance is what I liked best about the movie.
145;I really loved the dark humor, the silly words Annie Wilkes said such as oogie and cockadoodie and the mood swings from happy to mad, mad to happy and the line Did I do good?
146;And telling him that she loved him after she hobbled him with the sledgehammer.
147;Misery will always be my favorite Kathy Bates' movie.
148;Of course, with any movie she is in, the more scenes she has, the better I like the movie.
149;I always laugh at that part especially when she slams the ream of paper on his legs when she calls him Mr. Man!
150;A part that was well deserving of a Golden Globe and an Oscar!
151;Great Movie, One of the best 90's movies you can have!!
152;I have loved Misery since the first time I watched it.
153;Great adaptation of the novel.
154;Bates and Caan are masterful.
155;Annie, as it turns out, is the world's biggest Misery fan, or should I say the world's biggest deranged fan.
156;I promise that you will be sitting on the edge of your seat for this entire movie, and there will be times that you will not be able to watch.
157;"kathy Bates deservedly won an Oscar for her portrayal of the devoted ""Misery"" fan."
158;Her swing from one emotion to another is believable, and terrifyingly real.
159;She does a tremendous job of making her character seem like your average next door neighbor, then like your worst nightmare.
160;James Caan is perfect as the writer held captive in the home of this obviously unbalanced woman.
161;He portrays a breadth of emotion as he tries to cope with his captivity.
162;(I also love the casting of Richard Farnsworth as the local sheriff.
163;Rob Reiner's direction is terrific and always keeps the action moving even in the most intricate of scenes.
164;You can see that he let's both Caan and Bates play their respective roles, and move the film along like the consummate professionals they are.
165;The screenplay adapted from King's novel is superb, and makes this movie a suspense classic.
166;Of all of the Stephen King novels that have been turned into big screen features, this one is very true to the book, which is what gives it its intensity.
167;I bet it will still shock you.
168;The story is Hitchcockian in its simplicity.
169;Paul Sheldon, a successful writer of gothic/historical romances, is celebrating.
170;The game of cat and mouse he must play with Annie will have you on the edge of your seat.
171;Rob Reiner keeps the suspense building and William Goldman's script is a delight (although the intimate insider look at a writer's creative process that King's novel had sadly cannot be communicated visually).
172;An essential in any King fans cinema library.
173;The story works alot better without most of the gore.
174;This was the first of Stephen King's novels that I ever read, and I thought it was EXCELLENT, but I didn't become his number one fan!
175;This was one of the few films which proved that a film adaptation of a novel can be good.
176;this was meant to be a cautionary tale of the perils of fame and fortune, but it is also a tale of cat and mouse mind games.
177;I understood the story line and what was happening real quick and found the film (in every aspect) wonderful.
178;It looked so real, and was somehow even grosser than seeing someone get eaten by zombies or ripped up by a predator or alien or dinosaur of whatever.
179;Great adaptation, but missing so much suspense provided in the novel.
180;Kathy Bates is excellent and James Caan is credible as the helpless victim.
181;Kathy Bates really plays a great nut case.
182;Seen this movie a million times and love it each and every time I watch it.
183;In Misery, we find ourselves faced with a cat.
184;What d'ya know, a nice woman is walking in the middle of the blizzard and happens to find him!
185;"Annie Wilks is actually Paul's ""number one fan"" and now nurse, and after she finds that Paul has killed Misery, is on a rampage to get her back."
186;"Forcing Paul to write another Misery novel and setting fire to the story he was taking to his literay agent (due to its ""vulgar language"") she is beginning to make sure that Paul is remaining the ""perfect"" writer he has always been, and to stay in the ""cockadoodie house forever!"""
187;This book is one of King's finest, and will leave your stomach in your throat.
188;This is another one of my favorite movies.
189;Now I have it for my personal selection.
190;Thanks for all of your help.
191;This is by far one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's books that I have seen.
192;The characaters certainly bring the haunting book to life in a way that makes you want to go back and read the book all over again.
193;kathy Bates is superb in this role that shows just how devoted some readers and fans can be.
194;What makes `Misery' so brilliant is the chemistry between Kathy Bates and James Caan, and while their relationship is all about lack of chemistry they work so well together everything seems natural, everything seems real.
195;She insists that he writes her his masterpiece in dedication to her for saving his life.
196;it's Bates performance that makes this a memorable film, genuinely thrilling and believable, and as the film progresses we see so many layers to her character, showing us what on the outset could be perceived as pure insanity but upon further study is more sheer depravation and loneliness.
197;I'm ecstatic that she won the Oscar for this.
198;I've never read King's novel, but I'm anxious to do so.
199;I'm sure it's just as good if not better than this movie, but this movie stands alone as a true cinematic masterpiece.
200;Misery is an exceedingly good adaptation of the original novel by Stephen King.
201;The novel features one of King's most tightly.
202;wound, increasingly suspenseful tales, and this movie faithfully brings the novel to life on the big screen.
203;"Paul Sheldon, America's best selling writer, creator of Misery Chastain and chronicler of her romantic and human struggles and successes, has just finished writing a ""serious"" novel he hopes will give him the stature he desires."
204;Her performance as this complicated, mentally disturbed super.
205;fan broods over this entire movie, making it the riveting thriller it is.
206;Lauren Bacall, in what is an overlooked but rather amazing casting coup, lends her talents to the movie in the role of Sheldon's literary agent, while Richard Farnsworth and perennial King favorite Frances Sternhagen round out a truly excellent cast.
207;King had a special affection for this particular story, and he was not going to allow a second.
208;rate adaptation of it to come to the big screen.
209;The hobbling scene is memorable to say the least, and another incident toward the end introduces a little blood to the film, but overall this is a movie that all lovers of suspense and human drama can appreciate.
210;There are a lot of bad movies based on terrific Stephen King stories and novels, but this movie captures the powerful magic of the original novel as effectively as any King movie ever has.
211;capped mountains, James Caan and Kathy Bates battle wits as a popular romance novelist and his obsessed fan in this wonderful adaptation of Stephen King's novel.
212;MISERY achieves everything it sets out to achieve, proving once again that Stephen King is a master of writing suspenseful, entertaining tales that both chill and delight.
213;Rob Reiner transfers King's talent beautifully to the big screen and the film manages to pull.
214;biting suspense, King has managed to write a writer into his story, giving the film a bit of autobiographical realism and intrigue.
215;Caan is perfect as the tortured writer, but Kathy Bates takes the cake.
216;One just never knows when she is going to snap and I found myself on the edge of my seat in every scene that she is in.
217;"In this vein, the ""battle"" between the smart writer and the dim."
218;While DEATHTRAP may keep you guessing, MISERY keeps you on the edge of your seat.
219;overall, MISERY is pure entertainment and a pleasure to watch.
220;Stephen King has delivered yet another classic to both literature and film and all of the elements are here to make it last.
221;I highly recommend it if you like murder, mystery, and suspense.
222;It has a great making of doc and 2 of the best trailers, EVER.
223;An acting tour de force for stars James Caan and Kathy Bates and a triumph for director Rob Reiner.
224;Caan's air of quiet desperation is also well.
225;William Goldman's script also deserves mention: the characters behave intelligently, so it is enjoyable to watch the cat.
226;This is a prime example.
227;Fox has now delivered a superb 16:9 transfer that totally blows away the older disc.
228;The bonuses are plenty, entertaining, and informative.
229;The packaging is nice too, and looks like a hardcover book.
230;it is easy to recommend purchasing this disc by Fox.
231;The transfer is acceptable, with a good level of detail, although this is offset by a high degree of film grain.
232;This detracts slightly from the suspense of the film.
233;greater contrast generally suits the psychological thriller genre well.
234;But if you do not already own it and find it for a good price (as I did), then it is worth it.
235;Otherwise, I recommend this movie for a few good scares.
236;If you like Kathy Bates movies, this is one of the good ones that she was in.
237;this movie is a classic.
238;great acting and story line.
239;Kathy Bates is unbelievable good in her role as Annie.
240;James Caan is also excellent in this film.
241;This is one suspense drama that really keeps you on the edge of your seat.
242;One of my favorite movies of all times.
243;this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.
244;it has a great story line and makes you wonder.
245;Its a great mind thriller.
246;Ms. Bates does an excellent job playing an obsessed fan and kidnapper.
247;overall the film is great and alot of fun but wish amazon would fix the glitches
248;First and foremost, the movie must be commended on one thing: its striking resemblance to the plot of the novel.
249;The film has captured all the intensity and suspense King wished to convey and so much more.
250;Another commendable aspect of the movie are its two lead actors.
251;Caan gives a very notable performance, but it is Bates who fills the screen with the true terror of the film, and her performance won a much.
252;The suspense of this film never stops moving, and one will soon find themself totally immersed in the plot from beginning to end.
253;This is one of the best Stephen King film adaptions ever!
254;Kathy Bates gives an unforgettable performance in her portrayal of Annie Wilkes.
255;She walks a very, very fine line here.
256;giving just the right amount of humor to her character but not enough to make her performance over.
257;Kathy Bates is one of the finest actresses we have today and she's not given enough credit for her varied work.
258;James Caan is terrific as the bed.
259;Little does Caan's character know that Annie was stalking him and that she is his 'number one fan' and will do anything to keep him under her power.
260;This movie is such a great thriller.
261;Kathy Bates is a talented actress and is great in this role!This is a movie that you should have in your collection.
262;I love it, even though it had me mad, scare and sad.
263;I had a friend who watched it with me and she enjoyed it also.
264;I love the book and the movie!
265;Misery is one of my favorite novels from Stephen King.
266;misery is a great film adaptation thanks to the source material, Rob Reiner's direction and the fantastic performances of Kathy Bates and James Caan.
267;Bates is perfect as the psycothic Annie Wilkes and is a pleasure to watch her transform from a nursing lady into a maniacal person.
268;James Caan is equally impressive in a role that demanded him to be in bed long periods of time.
269;The movie is tense, scary, dramatic and also funny and that's what make it a classic thriller.
270;tones and detail is clean and sharp.
271;A great transfer through and through.
272;Every sound is crisp and crystal clear.
273;closing Thoughts:Misery remains a classic of horror thanks to the amazing novel that comes from and the excellent cast and crew that went to make the picture.
274;ray features excellent picture and sound.
275;ray comes very highly recommended!!
276;I really loved this movie.
277;Yes, this movie really has the right title and he lived through it in this movie.
278;Good acting on both parts.
279;This is one of the three Stephen King books that actually turned into a good movie.
280;Kathy Bates is fabulous as a crazy fan who thinks she knows the author intimately and holds him hostage and tortures him.
281;James Caan does a wonderful acting job as well.
282;Anyone with even a tiny dose of fame knows that sometimes people can interpret some really strange things from what you say or write.
283;A repeat for me but was still a good movie, if you have not seen it you are missing out on a really good movie
284;For those viewers that have seen the central horror scene in this movie the following interpretation asks you to experience it in a new way.
285;If you're not familiar with it I hope to help you see it twice the first time.
286;At first Paul Sheldon is quite grateful for Annie's efforts to save him.
287;This type of pathology is most vividly represented in one of the most famous horror scenes in recent cinema.
288;"She proceeds to explain the operation of ""hobbling"" the native workers that were caught stealing."
289;The intriguing questions that this scene raises changes the nature of some of the visual symbols in the film.
290;In addition, along with the added information that the original novel provides the two main characters become more significant than stalker and stalked, torturer and tortured.
291;"i feed you, I clean you, I dress you."""
292;This is made particularly vivid in a scene in the novel where he may potentially be rescued by a cop.
293;The music of Miles Davis has taught me to listen for the use of creative silences.
294;The analytical strategy of discerning profound absence is being applied here to understand the willful omission of key references found in King's novel.
295;I've watched this movie atleast 5 times since its release,it's great!
296;James Caan is also great.
297;This have got to be one of the best movies of the century, I don't care what anybody says,.
298;it has everything a great thrillers needs,.
299;suspense, horror, great acting, a psycho woman who is obsessed whith the character heroine of a book and wants the writer to give her the perfect ending,.
300;she wants a Happy ending,.
301;One of the best thrillers I have seen.
302;Kathy Bates performance is great.
303;I would see it again with no doubt.
304;I enjoy watching being I have gotten some movie scenes.
305;Before seeing this movie, I had also read the book.
306;In this movie, Bates does an excellent job of changing her facial expressions from loving to raging mad within seconds.
307;i also loved how she could dish out the most insanely cruel punishments, but act like a wise schoolteacher while doing it.
308;with the attitude that this is for his own good.
309;bates was giving her A. game here and Caan seemed kind of lethargic.
310;But in the movie, she simply shoots this character with a gun.
311;this movie gets an excellent tranfer,i enjoy it a lot,gets a little bit grainy but dont bother.
312;its clear ,is a decent transfer.
313;i dont have to talk about the Movie cause everybody knows its one of the best Movies with Kathy Bates i just want to say that i was so surpriced about the BD wounderful picture very dood sound the Movie company did a very good job to make this Blu Ray and iam glad that i got it here from amazon.
314;"I'll tell you why ""Misery"" is my favorite movie of all time."
315;they took a great novel (written by one of my favorite authors) and decided to make a movie about it.
316;They decided to have James Caan (my favorite actor) and Kathy Bates (my favorite actress) star in it.
317;Rarely does anybody suit a role so perfectly.
318;She plays the role just perfectly.
319;Aside from the whimsical scenes between the local sherrif (the late Richard Farnsworth) and his wife (Frances Sternhagen), this film will keep you on the edge of your seat.
320;I HIGHLY recommend this film.
321;Excellent movie, I consider this one of the classics.
322;Kathy Bates was so believable in her acting as was James Caan, two great actors.
323;I loved this movie Kathy Bates was really a fanatic.
324;James Caan was great also.
325;Would recommend this movie to anyone.
326;She claims that she is Paul's #1 fan, and she just about proves it to the extreme.
327;And you know that she'll do anything to make it happen.
328;And BOY did she deserve the Oscar for Best Actress!
329;James Caan is also brilliant as the helpless writer who finds himself in Annie's dangerous little world.
330;Director Rob Reiner has done a wonderful job with this movie, and even though I have never read the original novel by Stephen King, I'm sure it's a great adaptation.
331;This is one heck of a psychological thriller, and I easily recommend it to anyone who loves Stephen King and thrillers in general.
332;Great discount given by Amazon.
333;This is one of the best Stephen king adaptations (aside from Carrie and Christine and the shinning).
334;you get both for the price of one with this package.
335;It's filmed in a clean, simple yet effective manner to deliver the perfect claustrophobic horror atmosphere and Kathy Bates gives one of the greatest performances on screen.
336;One of the best Stephen King film adaptations.
337;known actress before this film was released, but her portrayal here won her an Academy Award and put her on the A. list of leading ladies, and quite deservedly so.
338;dimensional actors can pull off these days!
339;James Caan is superb no matter what he does, so this film is a perfect fit for ALL the talents involved, from King and Reiner to the talented co. stars.
340;Kathy Bates is top class in my books!
341;"I promise, you will not be disappointed and After just one viewing, you will add yourself to the list of ""number 1 fans."""
342;I made a valiant attempt to watch this movie.
343;The movie, though timid compared to the novel, stands up with Mr. King's best work.
344;Kathy Bates (Dolores Clairborne)makes Annie Wilkes a frightening reality and James Caan (Alien Nation) brings out his best performance in years in a deeply disturbed film.
345;A movie to be view a second time.
346;Mr. Caan and Ms Bates are real talent.
347;I loved this movie!One of my favorites.
348;It will definitely hold your attention to the very end.
349;This is, by far, the best Stephen King movie of all time!
350;I love this movie so much.
351;We are given perfect performances by James Caan and Kathy Bates.
352;Kathy's terrific in this and shedefinitely deserved an oscar.
353;Kathy Bates won the 1990 Best Actress Academy Award for her outstanding performance in this movie.
354;In addition, James Caan was excellent in this movie as the object of Kathy Bates' psychotic obsession.
355;This is a great movie .
356;It is a suspenseful thriller.
357;The storyline is fantastic because, even though it is very scary and not predictable, the viewer has the feeling that the events in the movie could really happen.
358;A movie thatdoes the book justice.
359;Based on Stephen King's novel, Misery, this film is frightening and funny at the same time.
360;caan and Bates both delivered a great display of acting.
361;A great movie in every aspect.
362;"Ridiculously well made and acted
I:21793;363;What a start to a career!
I:21793;364;Simply phenomenal, yet also disturbing, portrayal of the number one fan .
I:21793;365;when her favorite writer .
I:21793;366;so in these circumstances, she will experience a mesmerizing cross of encountered feelings: admiration and power"
367;gripping and suspenseful script admirably played by Kathy Bates and James Caan: two giants actors who knew how to lead this film to a secure port.
368;This movie is perfect for a late night thriller.
369;I'm only thirteen and I loved it.
370;So go and watch it you dirty birdy!
371;( watch the movie and you'll understand!)
372;The film has many edge.
373;Thrillers don't come much better than this and this now is a fine classic.
374;After I finished reading it, I absolutely loved it.
375;I took a trip to the Hollywood Video and picked up the movie right away.
376;The three characters partially make up for incredibly minor characters in the book (though the literary agent is mentioned).
377;I watched this for one reason, and one reason only: to see Kathy Bates's Oscar winning performance.
378;Not only is Ms. Bates brilliant, James Caan is superb, and the direction.
379;Excellent cinematography, as well as a great score.
380;Both Stephen King and Rob Reiner have lost much of their charm for me in the past fifteen years, but in 1990 they were still in top enough form to create this masterpiece.
381;Having struck gold in 1986 with his memorable adaptation of King's Stand By Me, Reiner made another attempt at the works of the successful suspense artist, and brought along for the task screenwriter William Goldman, with whom he worked before on the film version of Goldman's own novel The Princess Bride (Goldman would later adapt King twice more, somewhat less successfully, with Hearts In Atlantis and Dreamcatcher).
382;"king's writing is clearly at its best when he keeps the supernatural to a minimum
I:21793;383;Not only does King keep things frighteningly realistic in this story .
I:21793;384;not, of course, that he was actually kidnapped by a crazed fan, but King's experiences with over zealous fans of his work clearly seeps into the story, and like in The Shining, King writes best when he writes about writers.
I:21793;385;adapter Goldman (whose credits also include Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid, All The President's Men and Marathon Man) did a fantastic job of translating the book into the big screen.
I:21793;386;as good a job as Reiner, Goldman and Caan did, this film clearly belongs to Hollywood newcomer Kathy Bates, who won a much deserved Oscar for the role of Annie Wilkes (over old.
I:21793;387;Annie Wilkes remains one of the most memorable villains in cinema history, and for good reasons.
I:21793;388;Caan is excellent in his part, and praise should also go to supporting actors Lauren Bacall and Richard Farnsworth (The Straight Story), but Bates steals the show from all of them.
I:21793;389;thanks to Kathy Bates' masterful performance and Rob Reiner's wonderful direction, Misery is one of the most powerful and frightening thrillers in cinema history.
I:21793;390;It's a strong, realistic horror film that doesn't let go.
I:21793;391;A modern classic and highly recommended.
I:21793;392;It's not quite as good as I remember, but I still enjoyed seeing it again after all these years
I:21793;393;Taken from the Stephen King novel by the same name, Misery is a very gripping and entertaining movie which holds your interest the entire time.
I:21793;394;There are moments of humor and horror.
I:21793;395;Kathy Bates is the star here, and she was royally rewarded for her performance by winning an Oscar.
I:21793;396;i've always been intrigued by the differences between movies and the books they originate from.
I:21793;397;m. paul has written 8 Misery novelsB.
I:21793;398;b. annie trips over the typewriter and hits her head on the edge of the mantel.
I:21793;399;bottom Line: Both movie and book are good.
I:21793;400;I think anyone that loves a suspense movie this is a great movie for you.
I:21793;401;I loved the talent in the movie which made the movie seem more realistic.
I:21793;402;Stephen King's novel Misery is perhaps one of the most well.
I:21793;403;Directed by the brilliant Rob Reiner, Misery can easily be one of the 90's greatest movies.
I:21793;404;This film is overall great from begging to end.
I:21793;405;It's one of the best adapted books to screen movies.
I:21793;406;It's one of the best suspense movies out there and has one of the best villians ever.
I:21793;407;Kathy Bates is great and she deserved her oscer and all the other actors do a great job.
I:21793;408;The story is very suspensfull and will have you on the edge of your seat.
I:21793;409;I saw this film recently and loved it.
I:21793;410;The acting is great and the plot is suspenseful and often chilling.
I:21793;411;Kathy Bates gives a convincing performance as the obsessed fan of writer James Caans romantic novels.
I:21793;412;One of Stephen Kings more successful adaptations.
I:21793;413;I had almost forgotten how much I enjoyed this movie when it first appeared.
I:21793;414;Kathy Bates gave a phenomenal performance, enough so that I think James Caan might still have nightmares about it.
I:21793;415;I don't know what special features were included on earlier editions, but the Collector's Edition has some very interesting interviews.
I:21793;416;and thanks to Stephen King for sharing Misery with the world.)
I:21793;417;I remember seeing this movie with my mom at a theater when i was about thirteen years old.
I:21793;418;we were both captivated by the storyline and Kathy Bates' brilliant performance.
I:21793;419;There were even a few points in the movie that made us laugh.
I:21793;420;if you like a great suspenseful movie, then this is the movie for you!
I:21793;421;Misery is a fantastic book/movie that will take you to the edge of your seat, over and over again.
I:21793;422;Brilliant actors in every scene and even a few laughs for this suspenseful thriller.
I:21793;423;It is a guaranteed hit!
I:21793;424;she is excellent as Annie Wilkes.
I:21793;425;A true to book telling of the classic Stephen King novel.
I:21793;426;Misery is one of the best in the horror/suspense genre.
I:21793;427;Usually the book is so good and the movie is sub par, but this one is the exception.
I:21793;428;exceptional thriller which anyone would enjoy.
I:21793;429;I completely recommend Misery especially if you are a Steven King fan.
I:21793;430;The widescreen version offered here is non.
I:21793;431;but James Caan and Kathy Bates manage to give great performances: They are the ones who make the movie.
I:21793;432;this movie is entertaining like most of King's early works.
I:21793;433;A classic movie and in true bliss high def.
I:21793;434;story is superb and acting is fantastic.
I:21793;435;James Caan, Richard Farnsworth, and Kathy Bates star in this thrilling adaptation of Stephen King's excellent novel.
I:21793;436;Caan stars as Paul Sheldon, a very successful author of the """"Misery Chastain"""" series of books."""
437;"As Paul is beginning to convalesce, Annie reveals that she is his ""number one fan"", and has read every book in the Misery series several times over."
438;She also has authgraphed pictures of Paul throughout her house.
439;annie also managed to retrieve Paul's manuscript from the wreckage, and she begs Paul to let her read it.
440;Paul now realizes that Annie is insane and the only way for him to survive is to give in to her wishes and write a new novel which brings Misery back to life.
441;paul continues to work on his new novel and as he writes, he's realizing that he's creating his best work yet.
442;Will Paul be able to escape?
443;Will the sheriff uncover the truth about Annie before its too late?This is an excellent movie.
444;The plot is thrilling and will keep you on edge throughout the movie.
445;James Caan and Richard Farnsworth give solid performances, but Kathy Bates is truly the star of this film.
446;"Her portrayal of the obsessed ""number one fan"" is impeccable."
447;She won the Academy Award for her performance in this movie.
448;I highly recommend this thrilling and suspenseful film.
449;In this classic adaption of the Stephen King bestseller, we come across Paul Sheldon, a famed writer of romance novels.
450;kathy Bates gives the performance of a lifetime as the unforgettable Annie Wilkes, and James Cahn gives an equally strong performance.
451;One of the best Stephen King adaptions to date, Misery is a film that you will not soon forget.
452;Kathy Bates is awesome in this movie.
453;i love the hobbling scene.
454;one of her best roles she has played.
455;When I first read Misery, I was in love!
456;I was more than pleased with the movie.
457;Even if there were some changes in the movie, (the hobbling scene, the rat scene, and the lawnmower scene), I still enjoyed it very much.
458;I would recommend this to any Stephen King fan out there.
459;Not to mention the price is absolutely wonderful.
460;The special feature's are great, they offer more than most special features do.
461;dOODIE' hair on Annie's head!
462;Shared this classic thriller with my 16.
463;A classic with great acting by James Caan and Kathy Bates.
464;It stars Kathy Bates, who does a phenomenal acting job.
465;This movie is full of suspense and you will want to watch it over and over again when it ends.
466;It is a classic which keeps you on the edge ofyour seat.
467;I also love the part during the high.
468;She would have done this to anyone!
469;kathy Bates very rightfully won the Academy Award for her portrayal of this whack.
470;she adds incredible depth to this movie.
471;like pinchers if you will, to stay sustained in it's place, but it was moving and rocking about, so those crab.
472;As for the actual quailty of the movie, adaptated from Stephen King's 1987 best.
473;selling novel, Misery, about a famous writer being hostaged by his insane 'number one.
474;"but if you want something much better, a better adaptated Stephen King film, a better directed, a better casted, a better edited and cutted, a more scarier, a generally more faithful and more justifying and plain better horror film(either adaptated from one of King's novels or not)I recommend ""Carrie"" directed by Brian De Palma(most well."
475;She's also his number 1# fan as she puts it.
476;james Caan and Kathy Bates are fantastic when they carry most of the movie by themselves.
477;Kathy Bates nails her part though and is no wonder she won best actress.
478;I mean this is one of the best king adaptions.
479;What follows is a movie based on a story written by Stephen King that will make your hair stand up.
480;This movie was portrayed expertly by both James Caan and Kathy Bates.
481;Kathy Bates performance will simply horrify you.
482;this is a very good movie and you will simply enjoy it.
483;It is violent and shocking, as are many things based on Stephen King novels, but the storyline and acting is superb.
484;This movie is excellent no complaints what so ever.
485;the acting is great, the scene is great the plot is great.
486;this movie is suspensful and realistically frightening.
487;It worth the money to watch it again!
488;2 great actors become a masterpiece!
489;Stephen King is a master.
490;If you enjoy this movie I would certainly suggest you get the book also which is even better, and a lot more grusome!
491;Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is a very successful writer of romance and thriller novels, one snowy night he crashes his car and a lonely woman named Annie (Kathy Bates) rescues him and provides shelter for him.
492;She happens to be Sheldon's biggest fan and would do anything to be with him as her wish has come true, even though she's a bit on the psychoctic side as she wants him to do a novel based on her wish.
493;a twisted and brilliant modern horror thriller classic that is quite faithful to Stephen King's suspense novel and is adapted by William Goldman and directed by Rob Reiner.
494;The film co. stars legendary Lauren Becall, this movie is one of the greatest cinematic horror and psychological thrillers ever!
495;in fact, Ms. Bates got an oscar for best actress for the memorable role of Annie.
496;This is a truly unforgettable movie with such disturbing moments like the sledgehammer sequence, great acting and dark atmosphere.
497;this movie got to me, and still does get me.
498;Definitely a must see movie.
499;I particularly enjoy one scene in Misery, in which the crazed fan of a successful author switches from kind, gentle woman to crazy lunatic after she reads his latest novel in his line of Misery books, about an inspirational woman from the 1800s.
500;Right here lies the strength in Misery : its ability to take a good novel and turn it into a great film, by deep characters with waves of emotions and excellent lines of dialogue.
501;Everything is nice and dandy at first.
502;Annie is a nice enough person.
503;She tells him the roads are closed and the telephone lines are down, but she will take him to town when they clear up.
504;She says she has called Paul's agent and has told his agent where he is.
505;She is nice one second, a lunatic the next.
506;And the best thing about this is how well Kathy Bates carries the character.
507;The fan, thinking, in the fan's deranged mind, that they are serving God?So King wrote about this idea, and Rob Reiner turned it into a film a coupl'a years later.
508;I personally enjoy the film a bit more than the novel.
509;She completely evelops her character.
510;She easily switches her moods as if there is an on and off switch.
511;"Misery is at times humorous, at times amusing, at times scary, and at times truly appalling
I:21793;512;In fact, I can imagine Rob Reiner scrolling through King's novel, fascinated by every page, wanting to turn it into a blockbuster film with big stars and big thrills.
I:21793;513;And I can see him smiling.
I:21793;514;The most realistic horror movie I have every seen.
I:21793;515;Excellent Acting, Superb Directing, Good everything.
I:21793;516;Bates deserved the Oscar for this film.
I:21793;517;I read the book and in this rare case the movie was better then the book.
I:21793;518;my fourth favorite movie of all times.
I:21793;519;Cathy Bates is such an amazing actress in this movie.
I:21793;520;I love this movie it is so good I could watch it every day for the rest of my life.
I:21793;521;One that will resurrect a character that Annie loves but that Paul had killed in his latest book.
I:21793;522;Paul's struggles with Annie to survive, write the book, keep his sanity, and escape are what form the core of the story.
I:21793;523;Misery is the rare exception that proves the rule because this is a taut, suspenseful movie.
I:21793;524;Kathy Bates won an Oscar for her portrayal of Annie Wilkes and she deserved it.
I:21793;525;Richard Farnsworth also has a nice supporting role in the movie as the town sheriff even if it is an addition to the book.
I:21793;526;misery is a riveting movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you squirm at the same time.
I:21793;527;As sadistic as this version of Annie is, the violence has actually been toned down from the book, but it's extremely intense all the same.
I:21793;528;This is not a gore splashed slasher film, but the tension between Annie and Paul is sky high and there is one scene, in particular, that is tough to watch.
I:21793;529;I don't recommend this for the faint of heart, but anyone else should dive in and enjoy one of the very best adaptations of the modern master of horror.
I:21793;530;I think this is my favourite movie from the master Stephen King, and the Kathy Bates performance is superb.
I:21793;531;A great movie with a phenomenal cast.
I:21793;532;especially the Academy Award winning performance of Kathy Bates.
I:21793;533;It was a pleasure to stream this gem on Amazon Instant video.
I:21793;534;worthy performance is what completely ruins it.
I:21793;535;Yet, it annoys me that so many people who saw the movie are surprised and wide.
I:21793;536;eyed by the fact that a true sociopath would look just like you and I, and would act like everything was normal as s/he performed the most evil deeds imaginable.
I:21793;537;there's probably one on your block and one in your workplace.
I:21793;538;In the book he's so real that it felt like really being there.
I:21793;539;And in the book King is brilliant as he takes Sheldon through the whole gamut of emotions we would expect from someone who's been in a serious car crash, kidnapped from the crash while critically injured, and held prisoner by someone who verbally, physically, and psychologically tortures them in isolation for six months.
I:21793;540;Half a minute later he's good as new a la your favorite cartoon character.
I:21793;541;Miraculously his emotions are still rock solid.
I:21793;542;to see a performance by Bates that's excellent through the whole movie, I recommend """"Fried Green Tomatoes."""""""
543;"To see a good one by Caan, I recommend ""The Godfather."""
544;Misery was a good 4 to 5 star Steven King story which I enjoyed very much.
545;It concerned stalkers and fameous writers and must, therefore, be a subject close to Mr. Kings heart.
546;we also briefly stopped in front of Mr. Kings home to take a photo.
547;except for getting a flat and getting lost while looking for some of these filming locations it was a great trip and I would recommend it to all fans of Steven King.
548;All actors do a great job and the movie itself was very entertaining.
549;By this, I mean this is truly a gem that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat from beginning to the very end.
550;Kathy Bates and James Caan perfectly captured King's macabre horror in this film and played it out beautifully.
551;The progressing development of Annie Wilkes' character was masterful.
552;My mom loves this movie.
553;My mother has passed the love of this movie onto my daughter so both of them will delight in owning this movie.
554;This movie is really a good movie to watch.
555;I remember seeing this movie several years ago and I still enjoyed every bit of this movie even today.
556;This crazy woman who claims she was his number one fan was an acting performance which was fascinating to watch.
557;I would recommend this movie.
558;Misery fits snug into the first category.
559;I saw this film some years ago when I was younger and I remembered liking it.
560;I was pleased initially, but even more pleased after I watched it.
561;My heart was racing pretty much this entire movie until it was over.
562;I really liked the film's feeling of isolation with a complete psycho.
563;They play off their characters finely and memorably.
564;A fine addition to the collection.
565;This movie is so incredible!!
566;James Caan is excellent in it as well.
567;This is a classic scary movie that everyone should see at least once.
568;Classic Stephen king just cleaned up and upscaled for modern technology.
569;Misery is a psychopathicaly suspenseful film filled with laughs, jumps, and wonders.
570;This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time.
571;Yes, I know that's the best part of the entire movie but I still cannot look at it.
572;So, Paul is ordered to redo the entire book to Anne's liking.
573;*Misery* remains to be a classic as it is still a good nail.
574;It can be a little long for some people but it is worth it all.
575;I still think this is the best of Kathy Bates.
576;This is a classic thriller.
577;Kathy Bates is one of my favorite actresses and this movie is one of the reasons.
578;She is absolutely incredible in it.
579;James Caan does a great job as well.
580;By now pretty much everybody knows the rule that the best movies made from Stephen King novels do not put his name above the title and do not trumpet the fact in the trailer.
581;Meanwhile he has just finished a new novel about the slums in which he grew up that he hopes will establish his reputation as a serious writer.
582;He even lets Annie read his new manuscript, a privilege reserved for his editor, agent, and anybody who saves his life.
583;the original novel had a great irony in that under Annie's stern editorial guidance Paul is rather mortified to find the new Misery novel he is writing is the best thing he has ever done.
584;But with William Goldman's script the novel he is writing is but a small part of the game of cat and mouse between Annie and Paul.
585;this film represented the second time King created a female character who would be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, the difference being that Kathy Bates won for Misery whereas Sissy Spacek did not for Carrie.
586;Misery is a relatively simple and rather intimate horror film.
587;This time King's monster is a human being and that makes Annie Wilkes one of the scariest, especially as she is played by Bates.
588;I will be ordering again soon.
589;Many turns in this great movie and there are twists and turns to keep you on your toes as it unfolds.
590;Stephen King is an awesome screen writter.
591;ALl his movies are suspenseful and leave you wanting to see the next movie by Stephen King.
592;Like Stanley Kubrick's version of the Stephen King novel, The Shining , Misery is a good movie but the general feel of it, is that it wasn't created with the book in mind.
593;personality aspect of her character is spookily realistic, as anyone who has studied various mental illnesses will know.
594;(Note: the anticlimax of this movie was great, too.
595;This is simply a fantastic psychological thriller that everyone will enjoy.
596;It is based on the best selling book by Stephen King and really does do it justice.
597;kathy Bates' performance as the crazed Annie Wilkes is absolutely stunning and really gives the film that 5* rating.
598;She deserved the oscar!Not only is this film scary, its fun in a strange way.
599;This is pure cinema and entertainment in its highest possible form!
600;Watch it, you'll be pleased you did.
601;I love this movie, Ive watched it over and over again,I love any thing that Kathy Bates plays in,shes an awesome actress.
602;This is a great movie based on a Stephen King book.
603;it is worth watching more than once in my opinion
604;Need I Say More!This Is a Must See!
605;It is one of those really good movies thateveryone should have in their cabinet.
606;A good one to watch every once in a while.
607;One of myfave Stephen King movies for sure.
608;I love this movie,one of Stephen Kings best.
609;It's just such a fun move to watchand it's Katy Bates at her best.
610;Full of surprising suspense and not overdone You'll think about it fordays after you see it.
611;"Really great movie that's good for its ageI used to own Misery but lost it
I:21793;612;I have always felt the underappreciated film, """"Misery"""", from King's novel of the same name, was akin to some of the best of his films (and so many of the films made from his novels are drek!)"""
613;And Caan turns in a worthy performance.
614;There's a background story going on about the sheriff, his wife and Sheldon's publicist trying to find him.
615;It's well kept in the background and necessary to inject realism into what is happening to Paul.
616;how Annie and Paul revenge themselves on each other is something you will recoil from, as you watch the film.
617;bates is stunning in her role, won every award in filmmaking for it, and has gone on to be our most memorable character actress.
618;godfather career with this) also contributed heavily to the very real life tragedy of the stalking/obsessive phenomena that famous people sometimes have to live with.
619;There are also a lot of bloopers in the film, most of which I think Reiner left in as sort of a signpost to see who would pick up on them.
620;and the film is chock full of memorable quotes, that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.
621;"I leave you with one, from Bates as Annie, at the height of her madness:""Oh, This whole house is going to be full of romance, OOOH, I am going to put on my Liberace records."
622;Add it to your collection, it's a memorable thriller.
623;It was well directed, acted, and written.
624;Love Stephen King novels and the book was great.
625;Watched again and it's still as good as ever.
626;Bates and Caan are excellent and the characters captivating.
627;The story is so simple yet so unbelievable!
628;Kathy Bates' performance still rings as Oscar worthy to this day.
629;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
630;This is the best adoption from a book ever done.
631;Kathy Bates is simply remarkable in her mood swings.
632;She makes you live the life of Paul Sheldon himself.
633;But when a movie contains only two actors and the setting for the entire movie is one house, and the movie is this good, you know you have something special.
634;But anyway, Misery is one of the top 20 movies ever made.
635;This movie is excellent in its portrayal of the pain of real life.
636;It had me on the edge of my seat.
637;I'm an inspiring writer and it even made me reconsider being one since there are so many craziest out there.
638;They loved it and for me, it was a good movie all over again.
639;The acting is superb, of course.
640;Kathy Bates won an academy award for her part.
641;This is an astonishing, well researched and very fair documentary.
642;ray I own!As for the movie itself, it's sheer genius.
643;One of the best suspense movie ever.
644;I love the part where she is shaking the pitcher with his urine while talking to him.
645;this movies is one of her best, she plays a suicidal ex.
646;a must see, I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!
647;Kathy Bates was excellent in Misery as was James Caan.
648;Kept you on the edge of your seat as to the outcome.
649;As always, Stephen King stories hit the mark.
650;I have always loved this movie for its real.
651;The director, Rob Reiner, and screenwriter, William Goldman with King riding shotgun, have kept King's story close to the truth of his actual writing.
652;I saw, Misery a year ago and it was good.
653;Then read, parts of the book interesting Kathy Bates did a good job.
654;It's another Stephen King mystery thriller.
655;And so unfolds a suspenseful, intriguing, story line.
656;stephen King is a superb mystery thriller writer.
657;I strongly recommend that every viewer who likes mysteries watch this movie over and over and over again like I have done.
658;I like this movie so much that I give it five stars.
659;This is one of the greatest movies ever made in the history of American cinema.
660;"A couple of days later, Paul wakes up and sees himself in Annie's home, and he realizes that she is his ""Number 1 Fan"", and proves it by having all of Paul's published Misery archives of the Misery character."
661;When the sheriff leaves, Paul makes a noise to distract the sheriff, sheriff walks back in, sees Paul downstairs in the cellar and gets shot by Annie's double barrel shotgun!
662;"The hobbling scene earlier in the film is scary to watch, and you almost feel the intense pain that Paul feels when Annie uses her strength to smash his ankles on that log
I:21793;663;Before she hobbles his feet, she also took away what I call his """"freedom key"""", which was one of her bobby pins from her hair."""
664;The real showdown comes at the end of the movie when Paul and Annie are fighting.
665;I am a huge fan of this movie and of Kathy Bates.
666;She is a great and excellent actress and she truly deserved her Oscar for her role as Annie Wilkes.
667;This movie was filled with twist and shocking moments.
668;Overall the movie is faithful to the spirit of the book despite several changes.
669;Kathy Bates made an absolutely top.
670;She went perfectly between the role of sweet and concerned nurse/caretaker to the psychotic, obsessed fan.
671;This movie is a definite treat for any Kathy Bates fans, but James Caan also does a great job.
672;Both of them carried the story rather well, especially considering that these two are pretty much the only people in the film aside a few bit players.
673;The book also has a much better ending to it.
674;But the Lauren person who played Anne Wilkes did an awesome job of it.
675;MISERY is one of the best Stephen King adaptations captured on film.
676;Under the assured direction of Rob Reiner, the movie presents a chilling study of an obsessive.
677;"Kathy Bates won an Oscar for her impeccable portrayal of Annie Wilkes, author Paul Sheldon's ""number one fan."""
678;While Bates is certainly riveting, James Caan is remarkable as well in his role as the victimized author.
679;Lauren Bacall, Richard Farnsworth and Frances Sternhagen are quite good in their small roles as well.
680;MISERY is a suspenseful and witty thriller, and stands as one of King's best.
681;the story is this: Paul is a very successful writer of the Misery novels.
682;now, he must write to save his life!The directing and screenplay of this film was very well done.
683;I also really liked the music in it, which reminded me of Psycho.
684;Kathy Bates is truly remarkable at playing a psychotic fan with nothing to lose.
685;all in all, this was a great thriller that kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time.
686;If you're a Stephen King fan, or you just like a good thriller that never lets go, Misery will do just the job for you.
687;I saw this movie last night and I think that it deserves all of the attention it gets.
688;The actors are simply amazing and I hope my review is of some help.
689;Excellent award winning suspense film based on the master story teller's, Stephen King's, novel!
690;In my opinion The Shining is the greatest of all Stephen King adaptations and then Misery.
691;There are actually a lot of similarities between Misery and The Shining.
692;There both about writers, in secluded locations, who are deserted at some point due to a snow storm.
693;Both Bates and Nicholson have a way with tools, whether it be an axe or a sledge hammer, and with these tools they have cut and hobbled their way into our memories and into film history.
694;kathy Bates is the star of this film and deserves her Oscar win as the at times lovable Annie Wilkes, the obsessed fan of author Paul Sheldon played by James Caan.
695;"The ""shining"" beacon of this film is without a doubt Kathy Bates who for me is one of the most memorable and witty villains of modern horror film up there with Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter."
696;With that said Caan is there like a dance partner for Bates every step of the way, he is like John Stockton to her Karl Malone always ready to assist her in enhancing the dark comedy throughout with his reactions by facial expression or perfect delivery of his lines.
697;"I will tell you ""what I understand!"""
698;I do everything to try and make you happy.
699;I feed you, I clean you, I dress you, and what thanks do I get?
700;JACK: Now, we're going to make a new rule.
701;ANNIE: I thought you were good Jack.
702;this is a must for any horror fan to add to their collection.
703;It is already a classic and is the type of horror that gives you that warm, glad to be inside, tucked into bed feeling if you can avoid getting hobbled.
704;a great watch for Halloween.
705;This movie holds up over the years.
706;The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.
707;overall, this is a movie worth seeing, but I think that people who never read the book will enjoy the movie a bit more.
708;Sweet one minute, over the edge the next.
709;Kathy Bates' performance is realistic and convincing.
710;"This movie will not keep you on the edge of your seat
I:21793;711;You want to run while you legs are still in working order!
I:21793;712;This movie was very good.
I:21793;713;I have seen many stephan king """"book to movie"""" adaptations and this is definitely one of the better ones."""
714;I recommend this movie to anyone Looking for a good thrill movie.
715;And the fact that he had to patronize her to keep her happy, and humor her outbursts was even more intense because you never knew what she would do next.
716;The story was brilliantly written and it's the kind of scenario that is like a worste nightmare.
717;Rob Reiner directed it perfectly, and an especially nice touch was when annie flipped out over the paper preference and the classical music kept getting faster and faster when she got more and more angry while yelling WHAT'S THE MATTER?
718;Obviously indicating that she overreacts and is a raving lunatic.
719;It's sick stuff but it's great!
720;Paul Sheldon, played by James Caan, who in the movie is the best.
721;When she sees he is breathing again, she carries him to her house and begins pumping medicine into his body.
722;While he is exploring the house he finds the packages of pills, and he takes one pack back to his room.
723;In it is real sickness of when she murdered many people including her family members, and of when she is behind bars.
724;And she found his key and his knife.
725;She does so and Paul gets prepared.
726;paul Sheldon (James Caan) is a successful romance novelist.
727;His famous heroine is Misery Chastain.
728;He always goes away to write his books and he has just finished his final Misery book.
729;Also lucky for Paul, Annie has been able to set his broken bones and dress his wounds.
730;"annie is his ""number one fan."""
731;She has read all of his Misery books.
732;annie keeps the bed ridden Paul hostage until he rewrites the novel with a happy ending.
733;This creates a high risk chess game between Paul and Annie.
734;this is a great suspense thriller.
735;cathy Bates won the Oscar for this and she deserved it.
736;the supporting cast is three great performers .
737;'Misery' is every bit as unforgettable as you would expect of Stephen King's better books.
738;In it we see James Caan as the author on a particularly successful franchise of books about a woman called Misery.
739;The film is actually based on a real.
740;It talks about the way in which fans can all too literally trap their idols under through their heightened expectations.
741;Secondly, the acting too is superb.
742;Kathy Bates gives the performance of her career, with James Caan just as good as her frustrated captive.
743;The tension between the two is wonderfully paced and you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat in many scenes.
744;there are countless highlights here but the end battle is brilliant.
745;This is a high tension thriller that will keep you on the edge from beginning to end!
746;Bates is incredible in her role as the Nut from Hell!
747;Excellent movie and another example that wearing a cross on your neck doesn't make you a good person.you can see that on Law and Order a lot, too many freaks out there whose faith clouded up their minds.
748;She is SUCH an extrordinary actress, and I feel that she totally deserved an academy award for her performance.
749;James Caan also portrayed his character stupendoulsy, drawing you into the movie, making you forget that it is indeed a movie.
750;I highly recommend it to ANYONE who is ready for a good thriller/horror.
751;If you are a fan of psychological thrillers, you must see this movie!
752;Kathy Bates received the Best Actress Oscar for her performance in this movie in 1991.
753;Anyone who watches this movie will watch it more than once just to catch all the hilarious comments Annie makes.
754;Read Butterfly Collector and you'll realize that Stephen King basically ripped it off, changed a few details, and gave it a happy ending.
755;misery is good but the best is sweet hostage.
756;everybody i show sweet hostage to says its the best movie they ever saw.
757;Misery is one of those rare horror films where we get every component that makes a movie perfect.
758;The acting is sensational, the plot line comes from the greatest Horror writer of all time and works very well, the production is good in general, and the suspense is mind boggling and terrifying.
759;He is discovered and saved by a fan of his, named Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates).
760;What he doesn't know is that her love for his work goes even beyond extreme obsession, and she holds an unbreakable bond to the lead character in the series, Misery Chastain.
761;this film is put together with perfection, incorporating the small, necessary details from the novel into the film, while wisely leaving out the unnecessary ones.
762;Kathy Bates gives a remarkable performance as Annie Wilkes, and was rightfully so honoured winning Best Actress at the Academy Awards in 1990.
763;James Caan also delivers his character role exceptionally well, playing the suttle, shy and quick thinking Paul Sheldon.
764;The minor characters, most notably the Sheriff do a great job adding to the plotline and making the film a thrill to watch.
765;The story flows along very nicely, and there lies not a dull moment.
766;The climax is truly stunning and captivating and will leave you in complete surprise.
767;i would definitely have to recommend this film to all who love horror films, readers of Stephen King, or anyone who wants to see a true film of suspense and terror.
768;I also highly recommend reading the novel, as it does carry some significant differences to the film, and is just as suspenseful and exciting as the film.
769;This is one of the best horror movies ever made.
770;The direction by Rob Reiner is just right, well.
771;paced, and makes its way with superb unpredictibility.
772;Caan gives one of his very best performances.
773;When Caan's character finds the solution to his problems, the premise is believable, the resolution deeply satisfying.
774;bates, however, is an astonishing actress.
775;This is a bravura performance, one of cinema's best, that was fully deserving of the highest honors in acting awards.
776;But the suspense is high!!!
777;Kathy Bates acting ability at it's best.
778;cop subplot and focusing on the claustrophobia of Annie Wilkes' house, but it's still a compelling horror film the way it is.
779;This is a very good looking Blu.
780;ray along with being a very good movie.
781;A good addition to your collection.
782;It is also one of his best books and although this is a great movie, you should READ MISERY.
783;This is a classic movie.
784;It's not the most sparkly and entertaining by today's standards, but it's suspenseful and fun.
785;A little gross but still a good movie from a Stephen King book.
786;We have a purely psychological horror movie with drama undertones and an exceptional cast.
787;She sets up a writing area for him and forces him to resurrect her beloved character.
788;annie Wilkes, played by Kathy Bates, won an academy award for best actress.
789;This role really brought her to the attention of the public.
790;Paul Sheldon, played by James Caan, was convincing.
791;These two are the main characters but we also see a sheriff and his wife for some parts.
792;one thing funny to watch is Annie's dialogue.
793;You silly bird and other quotes are priceless.
794;She has a big pot bellied pet pig (named Misery of course), and we see such a complex person here that we can't help but clap for the scriptwriter.
795;we also get to witness some psychological warfare going on and the battle of an intelligent mind versus a loony one.
796;the climax is a brilliant wrap.
797;overall a great movie that keeps the heart pumping and the mind working, while holding the gore at bay.
798;love her character portrayal in this movie .
799;Rob Reiner's 1990 adaption of Stephen King's Misery is a film that works for various reasons, a few of which I will touch on here.
800;The most obvious reason is of course the Oscar winning performance of Kathy Bates, as nut job Annie Wilkes.
801;Just like some kind of childlike innocent, her admiration of him is of the most idealistic variety, and seems to be platonic and almsot spiritually based.
802;Every action Annie Wilkes takes is to abstain from the unavoidable culmination of their eventual coitus, thus when the act of sex finally happens, it is explosive, volatile, and violent, it shatters her delusional bubble.
803;since sex is arguably the main reason we are alive, and is possibly what holds the candle to our very creative energy, it is hard not to see this film play out in this more subversive way.
804;I feel that both Kathy Bates and Rob Reiner captured this aspect of both Annie Wilkes and the film perfectly and deliberately.
805;the others aspect of this film to point out is the concise stream.
806;lined direction by Rob Reiner which makes viewing this film such a pleasure.
807;Each scene is just the right size and has just the right amount of spice to keep things moving, seemingly without effort.
808;Very Mild language and plenty of suspense.
809;mind kind of a person.
810;Her character has plenty of the creep factor but still enough of a fictional element to make this film more fun than terrifying.
811;You will still be able to sleep at night, but hearing the words, I'm your biggest fan may make you want to keep one eye open just to be on the safe side.
812;A must see for all movie fans.
813;This movie has been a favorite of mine for a long time.
814;Kathy Bates performance is ofcourse exceptional everything about her character is comical to me especially her impression of Misery her sow.
815;Misery was an excellent movie and great movie to share with my grandsons.
816;Kept them on the edge of the couch for the whole evening.
817;Very intense, suspenseful film that has quite a good story to it.
818;It does remind me some of 'the fan' but much more of an edge of your seat atmosphere.
819;the movie was in perfect condition when i got it and i just finished reading the book so i thought that since the book was so good, i would watch the movie again.
820;the movie is so good i actually bought it.
821;I have always loved this horror.
822;thriller classic starring James Caan as the popular romance novelist, Paul Sheldon, and Kathy Bates as his nurse and self.
823;"proclaimed ""number one fan"", Annie Wilkes."
824;Paul also realizes that she is keeping him a prisoner in her isolated house.
825;The performances and plot are very convincing, and Kathy Bates even won the best actress oscar for her amazing realistic performance.
826;This is the kind of movie that makes you rue ever having disregarded the friend who's been telling you for years you need to see it .
827;When she does that with his feet (hobbling) ,I can feel the pain right along with with Paul (James Caan).
828;This has to be one of Kathy Bates finest movies and she does an outstanding prefomance .
829;there is some superb acting here in this classic film.
830;Not just from Kathy Bates, whose performance is stunning, but also, James Caan does very well as Paul Sheldon.
831;"There is also a very good performance from ""Buster"" (no idea of the actors name)."
832;the suspense here is unbelieveable, you can practically taste it.
833;I've yet to read the book (although i do own it) and if it is anywhere near as good as this film, i will love it.
834;it is a very powerful film, and there are some moments from it that will stay with me forver (for example, the sledgehammer incident)> the way Bates character is slowly exposed as a psycopath is very, very, well done.
835;the ending is very good, showing Paul Sheldon using his brain.
836;Misery is by far one of my favorite movies.
837;a must've for any one into suspense and who loves S. king's books movies.
838;A very good look into how people can change over time.
839;This was my first Stephen King movie to see and he does a fantastic job with suspense.
840;great performances by Ms. Bates and Mr. Caan.
841;there is a hilarious moment during their final battle.
842;Hit A and B repeat for a few spasms of laughter.
843;I tend to enjoy things a little more inspiring.
844;Download was easy and reliable though.
845;This is one of the classics.
846;It's a great movie, with a great cast.
847;Where he gets hobbled: is my favorite part.
848;GREAT adaptation of a great book.
849;james Caan and Kathy Bates are amazing!
850;This is a must see!
851;director Rob Reiner's adaptation of Stephen King's novel is an eerie tale of obsessiveness and isolation.
852;The film features an excellent turn by Caan and an Oscar.
853;watch MISERY for a load of suspense and thrills that will have you begging for more.
854;This is a great thriller and shouldn't be missed by any Stephen King fan.
855;He's a great writer and Rob Reiner is an awesome director.
856;The acting is also extremly great.
857;i hope my review was helpful to you!
858;When he manned the filmed adaptation of Stephen King's great 1987 best.
859;(1989), showed that he could also direct a suspenseful thriller.
860;He did a terrific job.
861;one Fan Annie Wilkes, MISERY is perfectly cast and is one of the few truly successful Stephen King film adapatations.
862;Indeed, in some ways it is even better than the book!
863;It keeps the dark, cynical humor and concentrates more on the psychological cat.
864;better yet, Reiner focuses on the character.
865;driven psychological horror and suspense, which draws you in right from the beginning and never lets up.
866;James Caan strikes the right note for his portrayal of the bedridden Paul Sheldon.
867;ever filmic starring role, became the perfect embodiment of the Annie Wilkes that Stephen King had created in his novel, and as a result, deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress in 1990 (unusual for a Horror/Suspense film).
868;paced, the dialogue priceless, the claustrophobic cinematography excellent.
869;MISERY is one of the very best Stephen King adaptations, and was one of the best films of 1990.
870;"The biggest tip offs to her unstability is, of course, her outrageous temper tantrums, and her incredible sense of possesion for the things ""she loves."
871;note, as it is in the book, transforms a simple but compelling tale of obsession into a dynamic exploration into madness, much like PSYCHO.
872;I loved the relative simplicity of this movie, which, by virtue of its claustrophic plot, rarely leaves Annie's house, and there are moments that actually had me writhing in my seat.
873;Rob Reiner wisely leaves the movie mostly in the hands of his two big pros, and they are up to the challenge.
874;James Caan is a perfect foil for Annie's affections/brutality .
875;his age and flashing wit work well in the role of Paul Sheldon, an author with his own artistic baggage, but it is Bates who commands the movie from beginning to end.
876;Finally a special edition of Misery!
877;Kathy Bates won a much deserved Best Actress Oscar for her performance.
878;This is one of Stephen King's best and while there are a few humorous moments most notably through Kathy's dialogue, the horror and suspense never fizzle in any way.
879;This is one of the best horror/suspense pictures out there and should be in any fans collection for multiple viewings.
880;James Caan plays Paul Sheldon very well and the small supporting cast (especially the recently deceased Richard Farnsworth as the sheriff) make this an enjoyable adaptation of the brilliant novel.
881;the exploration of human psychosis is the key element here, and no one since Anthony Perkins in Psycho has brought a more convincing and somewhat sympathetic mad character to life.
882;Kathy Bates definitely deserved her Oscar for the role.
883;Rob Reiner's direction is spectacular and all in all this is one of the best suspense films ever made.
884;And also one of the best film versions of a Stephen King work.
885;An essential film for all!
886;( I'm your number one fan! )
887;Misery is a perfect Stephen King adaptation.
888;my God, is she a tour de force of hilarious creepiness.
889;His performance is absolutely pivitol.
890;and he delivers one of his best.
891;His reactions to Bates' character are perfect.
892;Each subtle expression a glimpse of rage and terror.
893;However, with this dark gem, and the earlier wonderful Stand By Me , he has shown an understanding, like few others, of the essence of what's great about a good Stephen King story.
894;With both films, he crafted memorable classics, beloved by both film geeks and King fanatics alike.
895;god, I love you! )
896;This is a great Thriller.
897;They give you the trailer though.
898;definitely worth the price I paid and then some.
899;Misery, based on a Stephen King novel of the same name, is the second film adaptation of Stephen King's work to be directed by Rob Reiner, who also directed the classic 1986 Comedy.
900;drama Stand by Me, based on King's personal favorite work, The Body.
901;This is a tense, thrilling, and finely crafted film that even has hints of dark comedy thrown in from time to time, mostly revolving around the sometimes awkward and sometimes disturbing conversations between Paul Sheldon (James Caan), and Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates).
902;Seeing Bates playing a complete psycho was certainly interesting and a bit fun, if I may be so bold.
903;In fact, she reminded me a bit of Sandra Bernhard's character Masha from the disturbingly hilarious black comedy The King of Comedy.
904;She has a definite air of unpredictability about her, and you never know how she'll respond to a certain situation, making her perhaps one of the most frightening villains in cinematic history, right up there with Hannibal Lecter, Patrick Bateman, and Johan Liebert from the manga/anime series Monster.
905;Kathy Bates put on a real good performance here, I will say that, perhaps one of the best of her career, and certainly superior to her role as Dolores Claiborne in the other Stephen King adaptation she starred in.
906;Great Film but no masterpiece due to the fact that there was a bit too much unintentional humor in some scenes.
907;Thanks for reading and have a nice day.
908;spot on in my mind and the casting was perfect), but they left out so many crucial scenes and changed details that overall, killed the suspense and failed to portray Annie's true insanity.
909;they could have easily added more of the book.
910;In the book, the suspense builds as you slowly realize how psychotic this woman is, but this movie jumps from happy and nice woman to crazy murderer in a blink of the eye.
911;In the book, cops visit more times than in the movie, which really builds suspense .
912;Having the Sheriff put that together was clever, and it did add some spooky to the movie.
913;my order came on time and it was nicely put together.
914;i ordered 15 items plus movies and honestly I was soooo impressed.
915;i will be ordering again and again and again lol
916;I mean, it's a classic.
917;I've seen it several times, but it still keeps me on edge.
918;Love, love, love I'm ur number 1 fan , Kathy Bates did her thing in the movie and so did James Caan
919;It keeps you on the edge wondering what she is going to do next.
920;Such a well acted and excellent film!
921;Kathy Bates is phenomenal in this film, and James Caan was well cast as the tormented writer.
922;I always thought this movie would make a great play.
923;After reading the book Misery (yes, Stephen King delivers again!)
924;Great show that does the book justice.
925;Cathy Bates and James Caan give great performances.
926;A well known bookwriter gets into a car crash and is rescued by his biggest fan.
927;No horror here but good suspense.
928;This is one of the better book to movie adaptations I have seen.
929;This is one of the sweeter Stephen King adaptions,I mustsay.
930;At one point he even pauses for a few moments then chimes in, Sorry, this dialogue is just so well written .
931;new Interviews: Pretty much picture perfect.
932;Interesting stories from the set and years later.
933;This is my favorite movie!
934;annie is back the next day, cheerful as ever.
935;kathy Bates deservedly won an oscar for her role as Annie Wilkes.
936;She is one of the scariest figures thought up by Stephen King, the one who wrote the book the movie is based on.
937;i recommend this movie to anyone.
938;A great movie to watch!
939;And it's a good thing too, because that was one of the best King novels.
940;When he awakens he's in the midst of Annie Wilkes (played by Oscar winner Kathy Bates), who claims to be his number one fan.
941;"*From the book*""She has a lot of ways to spur him on."
942;misery is an incredible film.

947;This is a device that flawlessly conceals the fiery malice lurking beneath her charismatic shell.
948;Bates won an Oscar for Best Actress for her disquieting and methodical portrayal and, along with her recognition from the Academy, unknowingly attained a special place in Stephen King's heart paired with another starring role in his next adaptation titled Dolores Claiborne (see my review on that).
949;caan is an interesting choice for the abducted author, his fear and rage believable, although this wasn't difficult to portray with somebody as brilliantly convincing as Bates on the job.

951;His determination and hopelessness are evident in his mobile face, and he makes for a great protagonist in this eerie tale.
952;Lauren Bacall makes a relaxed cameo as Sheldon's editor who prods him about abruptly ending his enduring literary series.
953;most surprising was the direction by Rob Reiner, the architect of such zany comedies When Harry Met Sally , Throw Momma From The Train and The First Wives Club .
954;This is not his usual schtick and it's nice to see him venturing forth into unexplored territory.
955;and you will see the remarkable similarities.
956;There is an exception to be made for this one, however, and her name is Kathy Bates.
957;Misery provides suspense as well as freaky stuff as James Caan and Kathy Bates play exciting roles.

972;this is definitely one of my steven king favorites.
973;Kathy Bate and James Caan were excellent choices for the starring roles.
974;They brought depth and roundness to the characters.

977;It was a great read.
978;Everything from the acting, writing, and the directing is superb.

980;"based on Stephen King's novel of the same name, ""Misery"" is about a deranged woman keeping a man locked in her house against his will."

989;Kathy Bates and James Caan gave phenomenal performances, both wereconsistently into their character through out the movie.
990;Plus of course the climactic finale of the movie.
991;i hugely recommend this film, fun to watch with your friends when you've got nothing to do.
992;Some parts of the film with the sound of tires going threw the snow and the amazing shots depicting life in a small town in the mountains, made me feel like I was there.
993;Caan is a brilliant writer who has an accident on a slippery road (Hi, Pet Sematary) and Bates comes to his aid.
994;Excellently remarkable performance by Bates gives the term psycho a new face and scares the viewer into painless convulsions without impressive special effects or a stupidly thawed level.
995;and I mean that as a compliment.
996;Perhaps Mr. King didn't intend it so, but as a Christian myself, I found it to be so.
997;Deny food to the soul, and it will eat anything, no matter how junky it is.
998;i think it's premature for me to dub this Stephen King's best work, especially as I have never read the book, but man oh man.
999;This is a very good film based on the story by Stephen King.
1000;Kathy Bates is very convincing as the psychotic nurse who's loneliness and isolation and 'misery' draws her into a deep obsession with a fictional character penned by a discontented pulp fiction writer.
1001;this is a very worthy film version of what was an excellent novel (perhaps King's best), because most of the film is restricted to a single location and uses a tiny number of characters, very strong acting performances were essential in order for it to work.
1002;achieves in her role here) in the film.
1003;fashioned entertainment from the master, himself.
1004;There comes along only once in a lifetime an actress as talented and as magnificent as Kathy Bates.
1005;she is just plain brilliant!
1006;This film, along with DELORIS CLAIBORNE (also starring Ms. Bates), are probably the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel to the screen to date.
1007;The direction, by one of my favorites.
1008;rob Reiner, is impecably paced for the suspense and humor that it contains.
1009;James Caan, another actor I have loved since BRIAN'S SONG and THE GODFATHER, is equally great as the long.
1010;force of horror, humor, and pathos.
1011;Combing these two great performers was a work of genius.
1012;Kathy Bates and James Caan are the best at it.
1013;A movie with both a plot, directing, definitive surprise.

1024;a perfect example depicting the deeply psychotic nature of women.
1025;It is a such a VISCERAL experience watching this, so involving!
1026;A good movie and a collectible through amazon.
1027;Considering most of the film takes place in a bedroom, you're going to need a pretty good script to keep such a concept alive and interesting.
1028;In fact, two of the times I saw this movie were back.
1029;in addition to Rob Reiner's great directing, we have the talented acting of James Kahn and Kathy Bates, both of whom portray their characters quite realistically and believably.
1030;The realism of their acting is partially what makes this movie so frightening, because James Kahn and Kathy Bates make it seem like this sort of things could actually happen, which is a powerful tool in horror movies.
1031;recommended horror movie for those that want to see an excellent, entertaining and nerve.
1032;wracking work of horror genius, especially if you're interested in seeing the realistic side of horror movies.
1033;Thanks for the time, and peace.
1034;A very sharp picture transfer on this edition, and some great features including interviews with stars and production crew, as well as audio commentaries (if you go for that).
1035;misery is a fine film with the right ingredients to make it a true suspense thriller.
