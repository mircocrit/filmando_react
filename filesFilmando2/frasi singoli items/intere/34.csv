1;Cool Hand Luke is one of my favorite movies, and the best movie Newman has made to date.
2;Everyone who has seen it seems to love it.
3;He puts on a fantastic performance here.
4;In the end it is a kind of stalemate where both win and both lose.
5;One of the best movies ever made.
6;Cool Hand Luke is a great movie.
7;i love the whole movie from opening to ending.
8;i get upset when i ask someone if they have seen this movie and they say: never heard of it i love the entire cast, and each time i view it, it's like the first for me
9;One of the best movies ever.
10;Probably a defining character role for Newman.
11;I hope, even when we have a much more equitable society than we do now, we still have free spirits like Cool Hand Luke (played, and played well with just enough 1960s sneer and `devil take the hinter post' bravado by the late Paul Newman).
12;loved, growing up kid part, not the wise, too wise, before his age part that made him cynical, not the world.
13;winner George Kennedy and you have a volatile mix.
14;Yet Luke still keeps doing it.
15;Great story good photography, and an excellent performance by George Kennedy.
16;This movie is a classic must watch.
17;watch to see the rest!
18;I always wanted to see it again.
19;It was a fast and entertaining 2 plus hours.
20;Loved the whole movie from beginning to end.
21;i know I will watch it over and over again.
22;This is a great Paul Newman classic.
23;It is a great movie to watch again and again.
24;This is a classic movie that I enjoyed very much.
25;It's one you'll watch over and over.
26;YOu must love Paul Newman, he really is cool.
27;This movie was a favorite of mine to watch with my father when I was young, and it is every bit as good now that I am an adult.
28;It is a great watch!
29;One of Paul Newman's best performances, and truly one of his best films (I still don't know why I didn't nominate this in Best Picture for my personal awards)
30;With powerful acting and one of the most poignant and powerfully moving endings of it's time, `Cool Hand Luke' is not just a staple for avid Newman fans, but this is a film for anyone who loves film
31;He's strong willed and very independent, qualities that don't mesh well with prison life.
32;the films ending is really where the heart of the film lies, and where the characters that have been being developed become full and real and most impressionable.
33;it's a pure and brutally honest depiction of our subconscious yearnings.
34;the acting is a huge highlight here, and Paul Newman further cements himself as one of the finest actors to ever work in Hollywood (I've been known to confess him as my favorite actor of all time).
35;Newman creates a perfect faade for Luke, a faux sense of security, which only adds to his eventual breakdown.
36;George Kennedy was amazing as Dragline, a truly inspired performance.
37;He's witty when needed, gruff when needed and even charming (he is the true definition of `buddy' here).
38;so, like I said, this is a marvelous film and is one that I highly recommend to any and everyone I talk to.
39;My husband and I watch movies every weekend and that one is scheduled this weekend to watch.
40;I look forward to seeing it.
41;Cool Hand Luke is his favorite movie.
42;It worked great and we really enjoyed it.
43;This is our first experience with our new Blue Ray.
44;i would recommend this movie to a variety of people, especially those who like Paul Neuman.
45;written and carried out very well,He brings a lot of laughs and in the end the system he is trying to break,kills him
46;This is deader than a three.
47;Newman delivers one of his finest performances in Cool Hand Luke, with a great supporting cast including George Kennedy and Strother Martin.
48;establishment role is perfect for Newman.
49;This movie is full of memorable scene after memorable scene.
50;The fight scene b/n Newman and Kennedy is also unforgettable.
51;Timeless classic never gets old, even after numerous viewings.
52;What can I say about Cool Hand Luke except that it is one of the most entertaining and memorable movies ever made, as well as one of Paul Newman's best acting performances.
53;This movie is full of great lines and great scenes and is a must see for any Paul Newman and/or movie fan.
54;Cool Hand Luke belongs in every movie buff's collection and is a movie you will want to watch over and over again.
55;There was a sharp difference in both films.
56;Anyway, I loved the story, the prison life, and the subplots including the tanned woman and the 50 eggs contest.
57;I can easily think of greater classic films in the same genre such as ever.
58;lastingly awesome Papillon, The Great Escape, and The Shawshank Redemption.
59;Nothing is as good as it seems the first time you watch it.
60;I'm only 19 and have taken a real shine to older films, Cool Hand Luke is one of my favorites.
61;This film has all the right elements drama,comedy,irony, intelligence,escapism.
62;This movie is also very engaging and makes you think, which I love.
63;I love this old classic.
64;I'm not one to enjoy seeing movies a second time, but have watched this many times over the years and love it each time.
65;Hands down one of the best Paul Newman films ever.
66;Great movie and it arrive on time.
67;good to do business with.
68;This movie can be a great conversation starter for how well or not so well America has adapted to her people over the last 50 years, unlike other countries in the 21st century!
69;Paul Newman is one of a kind.
70;YES SIR, BOSS!One of Paul Newman's best roles.
71;Great cast and it depicted the old South the way it was back then.
72;Paul Newman is just great in this film.
73;I think you will be glued to your seat.
74;Great film I've always loved.
75;The blue ray does it justice.
76;First saw this wonderful movie in 1967, and it keeps coming back to me.
77;There are so many memorable scenes and character actors, I could go on for an hour.
78;I really do feel this is Newman's greatest movie.
79;George Kennedy deservedly won an oscar for his lovable lug, Dragline .
80;Even to this day, my buddy and I still quote this movie all the time in everyday life.
81;A great star performance for Newman, who plays his part to the hilt.
82;George Kennedy as his prison crony is also excellent (he won an Academy Award).
83;Definitely in my top ten of all time.
84;Newman really rocked in the 60s with Hud and Cool Hand Luke.
85;This film is great fun and has some memorable dialouge.
86;Hud is such a likable character you can't help but root for him as do the other inmates when Hud wins their respect.
87;eating scene is of course now ingrained in our memory!It is also fun to notice all the bit parts that a lot of familiar faces had in this picture(Wayne Rogers,Dennis Hopper,Harry Dean Stanton,Ralph Waite).
88;this movie is a regular world shaker.
89;Released in '69, 'Cool Hand Luke' is in my opinion Paul Newman's signature film and one of the great classic films of all.
90;Everything worked together perfectly in this movie
91;There are so many well known faces in this film and so many great, quotable lines you'll never forget.
92;what makes 'Cool Hand Luke' so memorable is the fact that it's a story within a story.
93;A great film on so many levels.
94;george Kennedy received a well deserved Oscar for his supporting role, but it really should have won many more.
95;Newman is magnificent and Martin Strother once again proves himself to be one of the greatest character actors of his generation.
96;This is my favorite Paul Newman movie.
97;He's so great in it, and there are so many memorable moments and lines.
98;If you are a man you are almost guaranteed to like this movie.
99;this is a must have movie if you got a pair.
100;Think it is an awesome movie.
101;Great American classic, I have loved this movie for a long time and blu.
102;One of Paul Newman's best roles.
103;Great story and many great lines in this one.
104;If you've never seen it I highly recommend it.
105;The blue ray disc is very good.
106;One of Paul Newmans best at his best.
107;Certainly the best of it's kind
108;Can watch this movie 20 times, just as good, every time.
109;One of rare few movies that feeds a person's spirit.
110;It has superb actors and love the story line.
111;Because Luke was a loved rebel by all even though he was killed in the end.
112;It was a great choice, I love Paul Newman movies.
113;dad for Christmas and it arrived just in time!
114;He'd been asking about it for a while and it was a nice surprise.
115;I know that he watched it and was very pleased.
116;There will always be a place in my heart and on my salad for Paul Newman.
117;Play it cool, like Luke .
118;Any girl with legs and a body like that has got to be named Lucille!
119;*Includes roadwork, digging, a carwash, a cardgame, a egg eating, three escapes, and lots of Paul Newman smiles.
120;the best prison movie to date, better than Stephen King's Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile.
121;One of the best movies of all time.
122;My favorite movie right up there with Fight Club.
123;This movie ranks as one of my TOP FIVE of all time.
124;No one can eat 50 eggs!
125;Some of the best lines in this flick ever.
126;I can't say enough about this movie, I could easily talk about it forever.
127;The ensemble cast, the storyline, the prison, the road gang, the heat, that song about the plastic Jesus.
128;he is the typical rebel , yet he has a certain aura around that people love.
129;the movie from beginning to end, is one of the entertaining and powerful movies by newman.
130;throughout the movie, we see luke's exploits including his status as cool hand which basically says that he can do anything.
131;there is no better scene that shows this that luke's bet that can he eat 50 eggs in one hour.
132;this scene is terrific and humorous to watch, time and time again.
133;dragline's love of luke is evident through the whole movie.
134;then of course, this oscar worthy film has the memorable tunes and lines that all audiences all familiar with: what we got here is a familiar to communicate is paul newman, legendary and household line that critics and audiences remember.
135;paul newman was nominated for best actor for this film, but didn't win.
136;Cool Hand Luke stands as one of the American movies ever made.
137;It also represents an intelligent and popular fellow who all through his life had one bad situation after another, yet like Greg points Ah Luke, always had that great smile.
138;Taken from a novel by Donn Pearce and directed by Stuart Rosenberg this film is a bonified classic.
139;One of my all time favorites!
140;wWII South, is one of my top ten favorite movies.
141;Simply put, this is just about a perfect movie.
142;But the car washing scene is pretty classic, too (even if the woman looks more 60s than the rest of the movie).
143;The script is fantastic, the locations are evocative of the time and place, and the actors all put in great performances.
144;The cast is so good that Joe Don Baker and Dennis Hopper appear, though only on the margins.
145;And as for this movie's star, well, Paul Newman gives his best performance as Luke, who epitomizes the American rebel.
146;Think James Dean goes to prison and you have Cool Hand Luke.
147;He looks a lot younger.
148;For me, this is Newman's best movie, a great story about a man's self.
149;The movie is good from start to finish.
150;I've seen this movie quite a few times but I decided it was worth owning.
151;If you haven't seen this movie, you should!
152;My Daughter is into film, and she loves these old movies, she has enjoyed watching Paul Newman and his acting.
153;There are many classic lines and great filming especially for its time.
154;This is the perfect `60s movie.
155;authoritarian without being strident, a serious drama with whimsy, gritty and violent with a sexy side (who can forget the car wash scene?)
156;The guards and the warden are the high priests and the Romans.
157;but we have some great fun along the way.
158;It is a classic and enjoyable film that is a touchstone for many who were young when they first saw it in 1967.
159;This is one of the greatest movies of all times.
160;Paul Newman in his late prime heads a memorable ensemble cast of prison characters including Harry Dean Stanton, Anthony Zerbe and noteably George Kennedy in his Oscar winning role as dragline.
161;in glorious black and white.
162;This movie of course has one of the all time great quotes to it, if you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about.
163;Paul Newman plays a convict who is sent to prison to work on a chain gang and he doesn't make too many friends at first but earns respect soon.
164;really good story to it, some funny parts, good action, some drama, just really an overall enjoyable movie to watch.
165;I watch it anytime I see it on one of the older movie channel's like Turner Classic or AMC.
166;I saw this movie a long time ago and just ordered it to watch any time, you will love Paul Newman cause he is just a super good actor.
167;easily one of the best movies ever
168;great movie with a lot of big stars in various roles.
169;definitely shows the will to push on in any environment.
170;it was a film from my younger days, which i know i will enjoy watching again!!
171;It was received in good order and well packed and on time!!
172;This is my all time favorite movie.
173;In perhaps six viewings, I'm still struck by the tight editing and perfect casting.
174;The music and bit parts working as one.
175;There is a lot of humor in what is in essence a chain.
176;Just when you think you have it figured out, it twists a bit.
177;The writing and screenplay are first rate.
178;They are both well liked and admired.
179;It's that essence of taking advantage of a moment in time.
180;Paul Newman's mother also won as best supporting actress and I see a resemblence to stories I've heard about Bill's mother.
181;George Kennedy won as best supporting actor in a good.
182;This is one of Newman's many landmark performances.
183;The look on his face when he delivers his final line says volumes.
184;George Kennedy deservedly took home the Oscar as Luke's initial adversary and finally his acolyte.
185;Excellent movie to watch and enjoy.
186;Paul is great along with his supporting actors.
187;Paul Newman brilliantly portrays Luke, a former war.
188;trodden prisoners who elevate Luke to the status of hero for doing only what comes naturally to him.
189;Misunderstood by both groups, he is truly a man who just can't fit in anywhere.
190;The cast is full of familiar faces at the beginnings of their careers.
191;He dominates the film from start to finish .
192;with strong supporting roles from all the actors, who have gone on to great work themselves.
193;The movie is funny, sad, poignant, rebellious, and somewhat inspiring in terms of what the human spirit is capable of.
194;With that said, Newman's character is made heroic for all the wrong reasons.
195;It is a great movie and Paul Newman made it great.
196;PAul Newman was great in this show.
197;Movie on Prime looked real sharp and sound was good, I think this movie was made a the high of Newman's career!
198;It is without a doubt one of the best of all time.
199;The guards are done just right.
200;the second best thing is the dialogue: Like The Godfather, Star Trek II, Resoirovir Dogs, and Jaws, Cool Hand Luke has several scenes which you'll easily memorize in their entirety.
201;other elements: Boss Godfrey, The Man With No Eyes who doesn't say one word during the movie and who is one of the most chilling characters in a movie ever
202;eating contest, and Luke's excellent final monologue.
203;He's a Rebel Without A Clue.
204;If he'd been born about 15.20 years later he could have made a good hippie.
205;IMHO, this film accomplishes what One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest tried to do and does it much, much, better.
206;one final small note: The Lalo Schifrin score is great particularly during the tarring the road scene.
207;Anyone who grew up in NYC in the 70s will instantly realize it as the theme to Channel 7 Eyewitness News!
208;One of the best Paul Newman movies ever made.
209;Newman is so harasmatic and likeable in this film that you can't helpbut root for him every step of the way.
210;George Kennedy is great too!
211;suffice it to say, this is an absolute classic.
212;What can I say other than this is one of the 5 greatest movies ever made.
213;I remember seeing this movie when I was younger.
214;A real story with depth like someone put real thought into it.
215;I remember this film vividly because when I first saw it, it was at a cinema in Paris.
216;the handsome movie star with beautiful blue eyes with a classical face.
217;This is a great classic movie.
218;Inspiring and Paul Newman is easy on the eyes.
219;Still great films, but as with Xerox facsimilies, the original is superior to the copies.
220;Arrived in great shcpe ant timely shipment.
221;I saw this at the Drive In theatre and my now wife and I still laugh about sleeping through this.
222;But I know one thing: COOL HAND LUKE definitely ranks in the upper stratosphere of his career.
223;and he has the audience in the palm of his hand.Yes, this is a prison flick, yet it's unique in that the setting is a rural prison in the Deep South that is stark and brutal and the inmates labor under a sweltering sun as a chain gang, their images reflected in the sunglasses of a rifle.
224;The film is all at once humorous, compelling, menacing, and poignant
225;Playing Cool Hand Luke, Newman is completely likeable as he meanders through his role and bucks the system
226;newman is supported by a topnotch cast, led by a grinning, good ol' boy George Kennedy as his enthusiastic sidekick.
227;I enjoyed brief appearances by so many actors who went on to have exemplary careers, including Wayne Rogers, Dennis Hopper, Ralph Waite, and Joe Don Baker (in an uncredited role).
228;COOL HAND LUKE is exceptional cinema and entertainment
229;She said: Love it .
230;Was so excited to get on Blue ray But not happy when watching, played on new 46 in Samsung LED with surrondsound Great picture Very POOR Sound.
231;Paul Newman is my hero.
232;If you love Paul Newman movies than this is a must to add to your library.
233;You will recognize the big name stars in it and also the debut of some.
234;I love that immortal line in this movie right at the beginning.
235;Then he starts beating up the prisoners.
236;There is a certain hilarious black humour about this unforgettable scene.
237;Luke is named for his coolness when he wins a cool hand of poker and he sets the standard for all the would.
238;be Cool heroes that have come after him.
239;It means in German
240;My favorite Newman movie a super classic !!!
241;True Blue American Paul Newman.
242;Hands down one of the great classics.
243;You can watch this over and over and still enjoy it as if it was your first.
244;Newman is almost always good because he was a man of integrity, which fits his character Luke perfectly.
245;Here he plays his standard 60s outsider again, and he's attractive in many ways, and the men come to idolize him.
246;Sure there are some cool lines, and some good ole boy dialog, and even some pretty sunrises (filmed in Stockton CA not Georgia).
247;time favorite films since I was about fifteen is now on Blu.
248;A classic for a reason.
249;Definitely a man's movie, but I really liked it too.
250;The rebel inside you will aplaud.
251;In Cool Hand Luke, he is almost flawless as Luke.
252;Not only is Newman spectacular here, but the rest of the cast pull it off nicely.
253;George Kennedy gives an unforgettable performance as Dragline, who slowly supports Luke during the film.
254;Strother Martin is compelling, even humorous, as the Captain.
255;That quote has become one of the most memorable of all time, and has been referenced and parodied in many films and TV shows.
256;Jo Van Fleet as Luke's mother is something to look forward to: she sees what her son has become, but still knows that she has done the best for him.
257;And finally, a young Dennis Hopper as Babalugats is minor, but it's a treat for those who admire the actor.
258;Great cast, led by Paul Newman, George Kennedy, J. d. Cannon and of course Strother Martin.
259;but like many great films (among which I count this one), its a simple film.
260;To those who suggest this film is much ado about nothing, I commend the wisdom of Luke himself, who had the best line of the film: Sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand.
261;He has had so many spectacularly great roles and performances to his credit that it's hard to choose just one.
262;And one of his best has to have been COOL HAND LUKE, that classic 1967 prison drama that was one of the defining films of that turbulent time and helped cement Newman's reputation.
263;winning performance), takes an almost instant dislike to him until he engages Newman in a boxing match in which Newman's Luke doesn't quit even when he's down.
264;Just about the finest prison genre movie there has ever been, COOL HAND LUKE is directed in sterling fasion by Stuart Rosenberg, and features a perfect Americana score by Lalo Schifrin.
265;Filmed almost completely on location in Stockton, California, and featuring many memorable scenes, including the famous egg.
266;Got as a gift for sister in law and just loved it she was tickled to get it .
267;it turned out to be a great gift for a friend who has seen the movie and loves it.
268;it was the perfect choice
269;I have always loved this movie since I was a kid.
270;Truly a story for the ages.
271;I first saw it on the Sunday Late Show and it stayed with me.
272;deserved Oscar as Dragline, and I don't think Newman was even nominated.
273;I have to admit Newman puts up excellent performance in Cool Hand Luke.
274;Cool Hand Luke is a classic movie and I remember being very impressed with it in the first run in the late 60s.
275;it's a rather depressing movie with a couple very funny and uplifting parts that are so good it makes watching the whole movie very worthwhile.
276;One is the spot when the working prison gang passes by a scantly clad young lady washing a car and doing everything possible to attract the attention of the workers.
277;the sound and photography are excellent.
278;Paul Newman is outstanding and George Kennedy is the best I've ever seen him in any roll.
279;It's an excellent, if somewhat depressing story and makes for wonderful entertainment.
280;What a great story, exceptional acting and beautifully shot.
281;True grit, not a happy.
282;This is a MUST see film.
283;One of the better movies ever directed and key actors that made it so believeable.
284;I bought this as a gift for my Uncle and he was very satisfied!
285;Newman and Strother Martin are a classic team in this great movie!
286;This is one of the best Paul Newman films.
287;He demonstrates his abilites and range of character traites in this film.
288;A great film, with a great story.
289;If you like Paul Newman, you can't help but love 'Cool Hand Luke'.
290;Definitely, a classic
291;and one of my favorite films of all time.
292;My heartfelt condolences to Paul Newman's family, at his passing 9.26.08.
293;I thought it was a very good movie and I would like to own it.
294;If you haven't seen this movie, see it today!
295;One of the few truly perfect movies ever made.
296;Great cast, incredible chemistry, amazing flow, Newman in his prime, Strother Martin at his bizarre best.
297;I enjoyed this movie when it first came out and have seen it several times.
298;Some of it seems so real, it can make you sweat even watching at home in your air.
299;a relatively unsensationalized portrayal of Southern so. called 'justice'.
300;I have seen it multiple times and it remains enjoyable!
301;Paul Newman is cool in this role.
302;Now go watch it and you will be complete.
303;It is great to see Paul Newman at his best in a movie released in 1967 which was filmed about 38 years ago.
304;This is one of the movies that made him so famous.
305;He finds himself in a very strict, brutal and crushing prison system.
306;The story is about his incredible bravery as he tries in spirit and in actuality to battle back from being brutalized by the guards.
307;Definitely one in my list of Top 100 movies of all time.
308;Paul Newman's best (and coolest) role ever!
309;The performances are nuanced and powerful, the on.
310;location shooting resonates with heat and oppression, and the story and characters exude archetypal impact.
311;headed noncomformist, Newman's Luke is purposefully cast as a savior figure.
312;A perennial loser who seems to have no purpose in Life since winning several medals in World War II.
313;Highly recommended for fans of Paul Newman and George Kennedy.
314;Always a good watchLove how the plot develops and the rest of the cast all play there personal roleThe ending is fantastic real COOL
315;This is a great movie.
316;This was a Christmas gift from my kids to their father.
317;It has always been his favorite movie so I'm sure he loves it.
318;This is my favorite movie.
319;It is one of the ultimate male.
320;defining movies of all time.
321;It has action, humor, tragedy, and drama.
322;In other words, one who puts forth real effort is deserving of respect whether or not they come out on top or first place.
323;The 50 egg challenge is great.
324;The story is magnificent as are the many great lines: Still shakin' it, Boss!
325;This movie was oned of the greatest.
326;It had great acting, a great story, and an amazing presentation.
327;Newman was at his best as was George Kennedy.
328;Everyone played their parts well.
329;One of the defining roles in Paul Newman's career in which he plays a likable convict put in prison for breaking into parking meters.
330;Luke evolves into a position of respect among the inmates, they look upon him as a leader though it's a role he doesn't want.
331;He's constantly bucking the system which keeps him in trouble with the warden and guards.
332;The acting in this movie is outstanding elicited by the director Stuart Rosenberg who wasn't and never will be one of Hollywood's better known directors.
333;George Kennedy won a very deserving Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his role.
334;do yourself a favor and get this movie, one of the best prison movies ever done by Hollywood!
335;Excellent acting, tragic story line, and a view as to how things once were.
336;It will always remain my top movie.
337;Paul Newman does an exceptional acting job as Cool Hand Luke and by the end of the movie he emerges to Hero for standing up to The Man.
338;This has got to be the best of the best (in my opinion) of Newman's works.
339;The movie forces the mind to flow between tragic, hilarious, despair, horror, fear, defeat, victory, etc. in a constant wave of smooth velvet.
340;Cool Hand Luke is a timeless classic that depicts humanity at it's worst and it's best in the most caustic of atmospheres.
341;A classic, must have for any movie collection.
342;Paul Newman is at his best in this movie.
343;Paul Newman played the role to perfection also.
344;This 1967 movie holds up well after all these years.
345;Although George Kennedy won a much deserved Oscar for his role as Dragline, Paul Newman should have gotten one as well for he is as good in this film as any he has made.
346;The critics I believe have underestimated his acting ability, probably in part because of his good looks.
347;this film is still very entertaining and much worth your viewing time.
348;He's not, he's a great actor.
349;A group of people are lined up on one side of the screen while observing the action on the other side.
350;The admirable epic vein, expressed as bold courage, the seminal resistance forged by the most abominable infra human conditions, would experience a certain delay in the Fifties due, perhaps the wounds were too recent to allow the soul, the memory and the artistic vein could describe with demolishing realism the unsaid horrors.
351;Paul Newman gave one of his most arresting performances in the screen (after The Hustler, to my mind) and George Kennedy is splendid too with this fabulous script.
352;this is by far, the masterpiece of Stuart Rosenberg.
353;Had to watch this movie in english class and i thought it was going to suck, but it was actually a classic and i would defintly recommend watching it if you havent seen it before
354;Perhaps one of the best movies of all time.
355;Paul Newman is at his best as a rebellious and charasmatic member of a southern chain gang.
356;Along with the religious aspect of the movie, the story is a remarkable tale of one man's fight against society and its harsh laws.
357;I personally loved this movie.
358;The story is interesting, with a minimum of twists and turns.
359;This movie is entertainment at its best.
360;He is as his name implies.
361;Now, what I sincerely love about this movie is that Luke is an excellent guy, he is calm and clear.
362;He is, in the end a human, but a human with a better vision for what he wants his life to be.
363;Expect no happy ending, just watch, please.
364;It is just one of those good old classic movies.
365;Paul Newman is one of the greatest actors there was!
366;This movie is a classic and a pleasure to watch.
367;I looked for the movie I wanted to watch, clicked on it and sat back and just enjoyed.
368;This movie has so many classic scenes!
369;From the 50 eggs to the shaking of the tree to the digging and filling of the ditch, this movie carries weight.
370;If you have not yet seen this movie, you should make time and do so in the immediate future.
371;Get your mind right and watch this movie.
372;What we have here is.1 fine movie.
373;The colors (particularly the blues) are striking and gorgeous.
374;This movie is an absolute classic!!!
375;One of the great men in chains films!!!
376;The great cast includes Paul Newman,George Kennedy(in his oscar winning role!)
377;,Wayne Rogers,Strother Martin,Joe Don Baker,Ralph Waite,and many other classic character actors!!!
378;One of the most poignant performances Paul Newman ever gave was in this brilliant film, Cool Hand Luke from 1967.
379;His strong will, humor, and smile make him such a likable character.
380;Even though the time period is set in the 1940s, one may feel that he/she is viewing a 1960s presentation due to its camera transition scenes, music, and themes of the time period (post.
381;all in all, this is a very enjoyable film.
382;This masterpiece is one not to be missed by those who are interested in the criminal justice system as well as the conflicts of the mid.20th century.
383;bought this movie for my boyfriend for christmas and you should've seen his face when he opened it!!
384;I order this classic movie in Blu.
385;ray format and it was like watching it for the 1st time!
386;Whereas Papillon was looking for freedom from incarceration, Cool Hand Luke is looking for freedom of spirit.
387;He also realizes that he is a symbol to the rest of the inmates.
388;luke represents the American spirit.
389;He has had enough of rules and regulations and just wants to be.
390;this is a great movie, and I highly recommend seeing it.
391;For any Paul Newman fan this is a must, you will recognize many stars and after all of these years younger fans will recognize iconic catch phrases such as what we have here is a failure to communicate.
392;This is by far one of the greatest movies of all times.
393;Paul Newman is amazing, the ultimate rebel.
394;One of the good old classics a must watch.
395;paul newman became one of my favorite actors.
396;just a great movie for anyone i belive
397;This is classic American cinema not to be missed.
398;hero movies, a reaction to the cotton.
399;candy goodness of movies during the 1950's and the McCarthy era.
400;newman is absolutely at the top of his game as Luke, a war hero turned petty criminal who is sent off to a Southern prison camp.
401;Full of religious symbolism and themes, this drama shows the strength of man and his relationship to God.
402;This is the type of movie that gets under your skin and stays there.
403;As a member of a younger generation, I was also excited to see the original source for many quotes which have become part of American culture.
404;Not for kids or a date, but a great movie.
405;A classic movie if ever there was one.
406;Paul Newman is of course the standout performer in this celebrated movie, but the entire cast is terrific.
407;it's more of a meditative film than an uplifting or dazzling one, but it moves along crisply with interesting plot twists.
408;It also rewards multiple viewings with a lot of subtleties that are easily missed on the first viewing.
409;ray technology sometimes doesn't add much to an older film, but here it really works .
410;I have enjoyed watching this movie, over and over again.
411;Some really classic lines and scenes.
412;Paul Newman does an outstanding job.
413;This is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time.
414;The story is both tragic and beautiful.
415;It's very moving and also includes some of the most unforgetable dialogue of any movie ever made.
416;Agreat movie that shown the talents of really good actors.
417;It is one of the best films ever made.
418;It is a part of American Cinema history.
419;One of my favorite movies by one of the classiest Hollywood leading men, EVER!
420;this was a gift for my husband.
421;ray version is more pronounced as far as sharpness to the picture and the sound clarity is perfect.
422;ray Cool Hand Luke is MONO!!!!!
423;One great movie, but don't waste your money on the Blu.
424;The story is filled with mixed emotions including humor.
425;The theme keeps you guessing as does the ending.
426;It is an absorbing story.
427;packed with powerful lessons for doing your work and living your life.
428;Luke's determination to eat 50 eggs is a beautiful metaphor for persevering your way to achievement of your goals.
429;scene to illustrate what a profound impact a change of attitude can have on how we do our work.
430;It is a true classic and a movie you will want to see over and over again.
431;The acting, directing, writing, score, etc. is top notch.
432;Am I the only person out there who constantly poses this question .
433;And if ever there was a role in which Newman was born to play, this was it!
434;It's definitely one of his finest performances ever.
435;The man has charm oozing out of every pore in his body.
436;along with the outstanding, understated work of Mr. Newman, this film also contains several wonderful performances by a fine supporting cast .
437;George Kennedy (Best Supporting Actor Winner as Dragline), Strother Martin, Robert Donner, Morgan Woodward, Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Harry Dean Stanton, Dennis Hopper and Jo Van Fleet as Luke's mother Arletta.
438;By the way, the scene in which Luke confronts his dying mother Arletta is one of my favorites of all.
439;It redefines the word POIGNANT and I can almost guaranty it will melt your heart.
440;there are so many famous lines and scenes in this movie that make this film completely unforgettable.
441;For those of you who haven't seen it yet, you are in for a treat.
442;I still remember the first time I saw this film and how much I enjoyed it.
443;If you are reading this, it's time to see what good movies are all about.
444;The acting, the story, the message.
445;I always find that there's something hypnotic in the classic films of the late 60s/early 70s, and Cool Hand Luke is no exception.
446;Story and plot aside for a moment, the filmmaking style of this movie is pretty brilliant on its own.
447;The photography is beautiful and uses minimalist landscapes of sparse props, etc, and compositions that are always interesting and well.
448;The story is straight forward but always engaging.
449;handed, but it resonates beautifully with the story and gives the film a lot of its charm.
450;And speaking of charm, Paul Newman is aloof yet magnetic, delivering a performance that will enlighten people unfamiliar with him and his place in the Hollywood firmament.
451;Many classic phrases were born from this movie.
452;don't know about critical reviews but it was always a winner since the first time I saw it!
453;Luke is a work that transformed Newman from movie star to anti.
454;His Luke is two things at once: a loser whose drunkenness lands him on a chain gang, but also a tough individualist equipped with personal courage and a defiant spirit.
455;notch support comes from Martin as Luke's wormy nemesis, and Kennedy, who won an Oscar for his turn as Luke's loyal pal, Dragline.
456;this is one hell of a great movie.
457;It has so many great parts in it.
458;You are really feeling for Luke in that scene.
459;this is really one the best movies around.
460;It also ranks extremely high on what I call the Rewatchability Scale.
461;Everytime is like the first time.
462;I am so happy to finally own a copy of this classic.
463;You can't help but break out in a sweat watching this!
464;Paul Newman really makes it watchable and his portrayal of Luke makes you keep watching.
465;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
466;It's amazing that it was made in 1967!
467;It shows that great acting and great writing are all that is needed for a great movie.
468;A person could go their whole life through without realizing what a genius actor Paul Newman was, but this film will stand forever as a tour.
469;A performance for the ages.
470;everyone involved with this film was a perfect choice, and the commentary on the deluxe disc is very informative.
471;i hadnt seen this in a long time and i was surprised how much more i liked it than i remembered.
472;is a great movie, but I remembered Joy Harmon being prettier.
473;Luke is a good flick, solid cast,a young Hooper,George Kennedy,Paul Newman.
474;hippie which I see as part of the establishment especially in hollywood.
475;All men at some time in their life want to be Cool Hand Luke.
476;Paul Newman sparkles as the blue.
477;He is amiable enough at the beginning, not looking for much out of people, just drifting along, but his charm and his take.
478;Soon he's making up challenges for himself, like the unforgettable 50 eggs in an hour scene, presumably out of boredom.
479;With a great performance by a diverse cast and quotable scene after remarkable scene after much imitated scene, Cool Hank Luke is a gem of a movie.
480;Great performances by Kennedy and Newman.
481;A must see for everyone.
482;Paul Newman truly is cool in this role.
483;and he eats 50 eggs!
484;Cool Hand Luke is a Classic.
485;I enjoy this movie, and watch it every couple years, I guess.
486;ray disc, but of a classic movie.
487;paul Newman's Luke stands as one of the finest roles ever played.
488;He's easygoing and likable, but has a stubborn streak a mile long.
489;And he gets along just fine until his mother dies.
490;this is a powerful, moving film.
491;It's one that you never forget, and will want to watch again and again, if just to see that Luke smile.
492;Watched with my son for his Film Lit class.
493;I discovered so much more to the movie than when I watched 30 years ago.
494;I absolutely love this movie and had of course seen it many times over the years.
495;I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good movie, this is an American classic.
496;This was a gift and I wasn't happy.
497;Paul Newman is great in this role as is the rest of the cast
498;The movie is very tragic, likely to trigger a powerful identification in the rebel personality type.
499;he never quite pulls the jail break, because it's just a movie.
500;in real life it can be done
501;Paul Numan at his very best in a fun southern road gang prisoner film with lots of interesting twists.
502;Both he and I think it's one of the coolest movies ever made.
503;Cool Hand Luke is a well.
504;acted and directed, the movie was oscar.
505;nominated for Best Actor (Newman), writing and music.
506;George Kennedy won a best supporting actor as Dragline, the leader of the prisoners.
507;The photography is great, too.
508;some say it is Newman's best role.
509;the movie has one of the most famous quotes in all cinema history.
510;What we've got here is.
511;The two end up in a fight where Luke refuses to give up and earns the respect of the other inmates for his toughness.
512;One day Luke finds out that his mother has died and he suffers immensely from the close loss of his dear mom.
513;Cool Hand Luke is a brilliant film experience with some very interesting shots and lines.
514;It is one of his favorite movies of all time and it was shipped really fast!
515;Great movie and great price.
516;I tried to clean it and do what I could but it is defective.
517;I am usually very pleased with Amazon, this time I was not.
518;Once you review the movie, you own it!
519;Paul Newman is amazing as always, and it's fun to see so many people who ended up being famous later on.
520;Great Movie, A Must See.
521;Cool hand Luke Is awesome.
522;This was my First Time seeing this movie, and Loved every minute of it.
523;I am the proud owner of this American Classic film on Blu.
524;This is one of the great, old films from the sixties.
525;A visual and emotional masterpiece that managed to capture both critical and commercial success, proving its appeal to a wide range of audiences.
526;This is an old Hollywood movie but with some new Hollywood themes and ideas.
527;This is the basic story but the film itself is more about a man who is destined always to be a loner.
528;They never really fit in, at least not for long, but are always very interesting.
529;He has a certain air of intelligence around him and a little cockiness too.
530;He eventually gains the prisoner's respect and eventually becomes a sort of God in their eyes through stuff he does (including a savvy poker move and one crazy egg.
531;He is a loner again at this point.
532;acting wise this is Paul Newman's best work to date.
533;He is one of my personal favourites and had delivered outstanding roles in The Hustler, Hud and Nobody's Fool but this tops them all.
534;His finest moment in the film comes when he sings for his dead mother.
535;The rest of the cast is great with George Kennedy in an Oscar winning role as a prisoner and Strother Martin as the prison warden (What we've got here is a failure to communicate).
536;this is a very underrated film that deserves a look from anybody who loves movies.
537;one of Newman's best performances as far as i'm concerned.
538;the supporting cast is also very good.
539;It and it alone.yes over The Graduate, a fine 60s film in its own right, but not definitive.
540;can serve as an excellent defiition of the 60s.
541;people constantly refer to Newman's character Luke as a rebel.
542;He's perfectly willing to follow sensible, reasonale orders and just 'get along'.
543;injustices we know well and all(?)
544;By being beaten but refusing to give up he wins the fight and everyone's respect.
545;hero, both strong players explored here with much religious symbolism, the film is just as relevant today as 40+ years ago.
546;The aftermath of the escape scenes lead to a much.
547;This is a movie that will make you think.
548;I saw it as a teen in 67 and it helped change my life.
549;Society is again in great need of hearing it's message.
550;provoking and profound, with excellent, sometimes experimental cinematography and a brilliant screenplay deserving of an Oscar itself (it and the novel both written by a former chain gang member), an all.
551;star ensemble supporting cast and the seamless Oscar.
552;deserving performances of Newman and Kennedy, it will stand for all times as one of the best and most important movies ever made.
553;Paul Newman is and has always been one of my favorite actors.
554;He was one of the best looking men I ever saw!!
555;This is a Must have Paul Newman film.
556;If you like Paul Newman and his early years, you will love this movie!
557;He became a legend, at least, in their minds.
558;But Luke is cool, very cool.
559;Soon he gains the respect of his fellow prisoners and becomes a leader himself.
560;He's the lovable maverick that we all admire.
561;performances are excellent, especially that of George Kennedy, cast as Luke's buddy.
562;A youthful Dennis Hopper has a small part also.
563;Best of all though is the one scene with Jo Van Fleet, cast as Luke's mother, who comes to visit him in prison.
564;She smokes cigarettes constantly and is full of wisdom and grit and gumption.
565;She talks about how she just can't be like a female dog who don't recognize her pups after they've grown and tells Luke that his old man wasn't much for sticking around but he sure did make her laugh.
566;She laughs then and gets into a fit of coughing.
567;Not only is Paul Newman awesome he is extra awesome as cool hand luke.
568;More people born in the 80's on need to see this movie.
569;Great story,like the character a loner rule bender and strong willed.
570;Hope the industry keeps putting more of the great movies on Blu.
571;Great movie history.You young brats should be so lucky to have one this good made in your lifetime.
572;the cast are : Paul Newman as Luke Jackson Cool Hand Luke .
573;a GP rated movie with a good picture 16/9 as for the sound only English Digital 1.0 so you need to turn the volume up than again depends on the type of Amp Receiver o TV approx 126 minutes , Cool Hand Luke still a Pretty Cool Movie for a Great Price .
574;My husband loves this movie and this was handy because we no longer have the western cable channels.
575;happy husband happy shopping for me
576;Unmitigated psychological abuse meets up with wild heroism in the character of a complex, but silly convict, Luke Jackson (Paul Newman).
577;For the Newman fan and fans of great movies.
578;Also this arrived on time as promised, enjoy!
579;Cool Hand Luke may be Paul Newman's best performance, although that's hard to say because he worked and worked well for a very long time.
580;Whether it is or not, the film itself is incredible.
581;For those willing to deal with characters that are very, very flawed, yet interesting, Luke is an excellent choice.
582;Paul is great, Kennedy was great, the entire cast was good.
583;This is my favorite Paul Newman Movie.
584;this is a timeless classic, I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!
585;This is my favorite Paul Newman movie and one of my favorite movies of all time.
586;Paul was a clever character and he provided great entertainment to all who watch this movie.
587;It was a gift did not watch it but my son in law loved it very much.
588;Personally this is my favorite Paul Newman movie and that's saying a lot as I love them all.
589;The movie was brand new and I've watched it twice since receiving it.
590;Originally released in the cinema in late 1967, like most people, I came across the fantastic Cool Hand Luke on a piddly little television set at home, sometime in the mid Seventies.
591;And like most folk, I've loved it and its indomitable spirit ever since.
592;and to see it all cleaned up and pucker like this .
593;and on a juicy big plasma screen too .
594;is a treat few movie fans will be able to resist.
595;it's almost a case of spot the famous face now .
596;and all of it with a top screenplay by DONN PEARCE and FRANK PIERSON and complimented by a cool LALO SCHIFFRIN soundtrack.
597;but the real treat for lifetime fans of the film is the PRINT.
598;it's absolutely gorgeous to look at.
599;most of the action takes place in the blistering heat of a Florida prison and its daily work details, so there's a sort of heat haze over every outdoor shot, but the clarity of the restored print is still fantastic.
600;there are so many great scenes:.
601;is probably one of the sexiest and most delicious scenes ever put to film (George Kennedy calls her Lucille).
602;Strother Martin's famous lines about communication when one of the prisoners gets shirty, the mirror shades of Boss reflecting everything from the birds he shoots to approaching trucks, the boisterous and loaded card games, the egg.
603;Cool Hand Luke on Blu Ray is a triumph.
604;ray version of this movie is incredible, blu.
605;ray has the ability to capture the colours and yes even the sweat.
606;I highly recommend purchasing this classic Paul Newman movie.
607;Paul Newman portrays Lucas Jackson, an iconic film anti.
608;hero, in this classic film.
609;He speaks no words from behind his mirror sunglasses, but has a rifle brought to him every so often so that he can demonstrate his sharp.
610;Dragline and the other prisoners live a pretty vivid fantasy life.
611;She is just some innocent, beautiful girl who didn't know what she was doin' while she postured her curvy side for the men.
612;Oh, she knew what she was doing, and she loved every minute of it, Luke states plainly, bursting the fantasy balloon of the other prisoners.
613;He gradually earns the respect of the other prisoners, and one of the best scenes of the film occurs at a poker game where Dragline finally comes to respect Luke and gives him his nickname.
614;paul Newman has seldom been better.
615;In my opinion, one of the best films made.
616;You a natural born world shaker, Luke.
617;A classic, dateless Paul Newman movie.
618;com always gets me what I want .
619;Let alone the great supporting cast.
620;It is a classic and has been watched over and over again.
621;I love Paul Newman, this is my favorite of his movies, God he was so handsome.
622;He was thrilled with it.
623;Recommend to anyone who enjoys a good movie but especially to the people who work with the baby boomer generation (and don't always understand their jokes/quotes)!
624;That's how great this cast is, and Paul Newman leads it with aplomb, his handsome charm a mask for what a fine actor he was.
625;Instead, the film has a brightly.
626;lit look, and the actors have a pretty sweatiness about them that is almost more Calvin Klein ad than gritty prison film.
627;Cool Hand Luke is a fine entertainment but far from a great film.
628;A classic by any definition!
629;And Blu ray just brings out the best in the movie!
630;Paul Newman stars in this American classic as one of film's greatest anti.
631;As far as the Blu Ray, it's solid, and a great bargain at this low price point.
632;And a solid 4 star Blu Ray disc.
633;The cast is great, the plot is simple, and the story really tells itself.
634;The acting and directing in this movie is outstanding.
635;I love this movie so much and Paul Newman is my favorite actor!
636;Anyway, this is a great old movie and I really enjoyed it on my iPad!
637;This movie is anything but cool.
638;The setting is realistic and harsh.
639;There's many a scene of sweat and overheating men.
640;He's the figure of composure
641;He's spiritually and mentally invincible, and eventually it leads to his ultimate fate.
642;cool Hand Luke is a marvelous film.
643;It's one fourth romantic, three fourths gritty reality.
644;Paul Newman and the gorgeous cinematography are the romance.
645;Newman nearly carries the film.
646;Here's this movie star, a charismatic leading man who liberally uses his smile to get himself through scenes, but he immerses himself into his character.
647;I think Luke is one of the greatest, most complex male characters to grace the screen, and Newman is really the only actor who could ever do him justice.
648;He IS Luke, he is this renegade rebel, this charming dapper Dan, and this tragic everyman.
649;Newman's supporting cast is superb, in one of the best acted films I've ever seen.
650;George Kennedy is incredible as the only sizable supporting character, though the rest of the cast do their utmost to fit their roles, especially the various sinister and slimy wardens, and they do it beautifully.
651;This is one of those films with incredible dialogue.
652;It embraces wit and logic, a lovely razor sharpness, and a down to earth realism.
653;Without us knowing it paints an environment, it paints a setting.
654;It's a movie with certain faintly stylized points and flourishes, with a bit of a Southern storytelling air and lilt to it, and a definite love for fun.
655;But it's intense, from the acting, to plot twists and character developements, to minor action sequences (a movie populated by inmates and movie stars has to have some excitement), it has incredible depth in it's subtle symbolism and it's layered messages and it's performances with their emotional tapestries.
656;this is drama at it's finest.
657;It is a complex intriguing film that can get under your skin in it's rawness, but can still entertain you, and send you into that dreamy mesmerized state of being in awe of a film and the characters portrayed in it.
658;Classic old school movie that kept you entertained and involved.
659;It is a movie that really created suspense by character development.
660;heroes all the way to classic filmdom in this late '60s gem.
661;Many good young actors .
662;including, my favorite, Harry Dean Stanton, billed as Dean Stanton.
663;Cool Hand Luke is just great, classic viewing entertainment.
664;frame, That classic frame, right then and there we automatically know we're dealing with a man who's head.
665;There's this feeling that's he's always got something up his sleeve for them.
666;Because his legacy carries on.
667;You gotta love Luke for who he is.
668;He's going to keep going.
669;I adore this movie and am very happy to finally own a copy of my own so I may watch over and over again
670;as had been said before, this movie is brilliant if you like great acting, great cinematography and editing, and wonderful scripting.
671;beyond that stuff, it is supremely entertaining.
672;I've seen this movie many times and caught it on TV again this weekend, only reminding me what a classic it is, easily among the best of all time.
673;That spirit, though, is as much his strength as it is his burden.
674;it could easily be regarded as Newman's best acting.
675;in short . . . a classic, definitely in my personal top ten of all time.
676;This movie still holds up after all these years.
677;Great performances by all, and of course, Paul Newman.
678;Cool Hand Luke was adapted from the novel by Don Pearce, who spent some time on a Florida chain gang and based his leading character, Lucas Jackson, one.
679;third on himself, and the rest is fiction.
680;A big, boisterous inmate nicknamed Dragline (George Kennedy) at first sees Luke as a challenge to his position, but soon comes to admire Luke's daring and stubbornness.
681;He's one of many notable character actors in the film's large supporting cast.
682;Cool Hand Luke harkens back to the prison films of the 1930s, also produced by Warner Brothers, in its social conscience message and antihero protagonist.
683;Cool Hand Luke is beautifully shot by cinematographer Conrad Hall, who would win an Academy Award much later for another Newman film, Road to Perdition (2002).
684;one thing that characterizes films with enduring greatness is that they invite more than one reading of the material.
685;Cool Hand Luke is a character study of Lucas Jackson, a man whose stubbornness is less a conviction than it is self.
686;He talks about the making of the film, its anti.
687;authoritarian themes, characters, sets, and takes us through the film.
688;Paul Newman is Cool to the Bone as is George Kennedy.
689;This is a great film.
690;Paul Newman was a great actor, and this film will be enjoyed for years to come.
691;Cool Hand Luke fits into an elite group of movies (along with The Outlaw Josey Wales, Shawshank Redemption, and Jaws) that have the ability to draw you in no matter how many times you've seen them.
692;cool Hand Luke is a story about a hard headed good ol' boy that just can't seem to deal very well with authority.
693;George Kennedy gives an excellent performance as Dragline, the chain.
694;cool Hand Luke is a funny, suspensful, dramatic, emotional ride that has timeless appeal.
695;This is one of the best movie's that Paul Newman maded and I just had to have it.
696;I have others but I love this one the most.
697;Definitely ranks as one of Newman's best fillms.
698;This movie has many memorable moments.
699;Cool Hand Luke features Paul Newman delivering one of his finest performances.
700;Cool Hand Luke is about a man who will not give up his values for anything.
701;this is my favorite movie.
702;Every shot is like a beautifully composed photograph.
703;The cast talk about how Paul really led everyone to give their best performance.
704;George Kennedy was his finest and ironically their characters started out not liking one another.
705;Just do yourself favor and watch it.
706;The moral message is just as relevant today as it was in the 50's.
707;If you haven't seen it, then see it .
708;The one that all the guys talk about.
709;This is a great Paul Newman movie.
710;I'm so glad I got it.
711;It seemed a little sluggish to me, but, it kept me entertained at the same time.
712;Every actor in this movie does an excellent job, this is one of the few movies that I can't criticize any of the acting.
713;In my opinion, everyone should see this movie at least once in their lives if not just to become well.
714;A stellar cast supports Paul Newman's brilliant performance as a hopelessly non.
715;My favorite Paul Newman movie.
716;One of the few movies I can watch anytime.
717;I am generally not a fan of older movies, but this was a good one!
718;Paul Newman is great in this role.
719;I haven't watched the movie in over 20 years, and it was great to re.
720;bought one for a friend to have.
721;This is a must see and must own movie.
722;I was satisfied with this product, with possibly one exception.
723;This is a great movie.
724;A transformation that morphed the male ideal to one of feminine beauty.
725;They did so at their own risk. . . refusing to follow the safe, well.
726;And our love of Luke is sealed.
727;frame of him laughing at life: her struggles, her injustices, her seeming insistence that we conform, or else.
728;and that is also why we loved Paul Newman.
729;We are so rooting for Luke to connect with his mother, to escape the chain gang, to achieve the miraculous feat of eating 50 eggs.
730;one of the quintessential American males of his times.
731;He was a natural born world.
732;i love this movie, it is an american classic.
733;so many great small actors that get little recignition from the main stream HOLLYWOOD.
734;SO MANY great lines that we remember as kids growing up.
735;this movie was made on a modest budget, but looks very complex on the big screen.
736;you will enjoy this movie if you like a vision of the old south, a big piece of americana.
737;Just amazing tail about cool hand luke.
738;Whoever has seen this film surely remembers that line .
739;He's played in many times since, always well, but never better than in this movie.
740;Invite your teenagers to watch it with you.
741;Butch and Sundance is one of my FAVORITE films of all time.
742;Therefore Newman's classic role here can only make it just beneath it.
743;This movie is a classic.
744;This was one that I knew would be good without being interested in its type yet.
745;There are wonderful reviews of this film and all well.
746;ray transfer
747;Cool Hand Luke is one of those heavy.
748;Paul Newman is excellent as always and the sole reason for watching this film.
749;There is a special documentary called A Natural.
750;Being rated G it's good for the whole family and holds tons of moral stories for you.
751;This is the essential Paul Newman movie.
752;Luke is the perfect Everyman
753;He finds the best in every situation.
754;Combining these two elements is difficult, but Newman perfects the combination and creates one of the best movies of all time.
755;it is amazing how may movie careers this movie started.
756;Even if you never saw Paul Newman in another role, you would conclude from his magnificent portrayal of the enigmatic title character (arrested and imprisoned for a minor act of property destruction in the deep South of the early 60's, who defies authority and eventually, like Christ, dies for his sins) that he is one of the great actors of our age.
757;George Kennedy is similarly wonderful as the de facto head of the jailhouse gang who at first exclude but then come to embrace Newman.
758;Get it, watch it, appreciate it.
759;One of my favorite movies of the 1960's is Cool Hand Luke which, I believe, is an opinion I share with many others.
760;It took place in a Southern prison farm and it starred Paul Newman in the title role.
761;He really is the personification of cool at a time we all thought we knew the real meaning of the term.
762;the story is a rather simple one
763;There's more to the story but the ending is a bittersweet one that needn't be spoiled for the first.
764;this is a movie that stays with you for a long time.
765;It's one that most of us who saw it once have seen it a number of other times as well.
766;One of our regular family outings back then.
767;Whoever came up with this story had nothing better to do.
768;I loved seeing Paul Newman again in this movie.
769;he actually showed acting talent in this picture.
770;it is both funny and sad.
771;I am a film buff and this movie is a must for like me.
772;even more so that it is on Blu Ray, nicely restored.
773;hopefully, more of these classic movies will be restored to Blu Ray.
774;Older movie but still a classic one to watch.
775;Of course we love Paul Newman.
776;Good family movie showing the rough past life.
777;One of the reasons that the late 60s/early 70s was such a powerful era in filmmaking is the emergence of the anti.
778;This is symbolized greatly in `Cool Hand Luke'.
779;It is because of this and his persuasive charm that the other prisoners (played remarkably well by Kennedy and a host of others to include Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Dennis Hopper and one of the actors who played a crewmember on `Alien') live vicariously through him.
780;This is my favorite line from the is excellent movie.
781;My collection is better for having it.
782;It was a wonderful movie back in the day, and still interests and fascinate those who have not learned the true history of the depression.
783;This movie is a must have for anyone that is a big, or small fan of Paul Newman.
784;George Kennedy is equally as great and keeps the movie going.
785;I give this classic 5 stars.
786;He enjoyed it thoroughly, as did I.
787;It had been several decades since I last saw it, but it makes such an impact that it seemed familiar as we watched.
788;There are plenty of thorough reviews here, so I won't add much to the verbiage.
789;will just say that if you've never seen this movie, it's well worth the investment.
790;Would recommend to others any time if asked.
791;this is one of the best movies ever made, paul newman has a spectacular performance as luke, and the supporting cast around him is superb.
792;Classic movie for all time and all ages.
793;It has a fantastic story line.
794;with Paul Newman and supporting actors in it.
795;hero 'born to lose,' but a man full of pride and dignity.
796;Cool Hand Luke resumes Newman's career as another rebel, a non.
797;conformist, a perfect hero who beats the system wherever.
798;Resources of his true command of his technical acting are breathtaking in their impact.
799;newman is again a cynical loner, but he's also charming, and everything is calculated to involve us with him
800;Luke engages our sympathy not because he is economically deprived or the product of an unhappy home, but because for him the act of rebellion is its own justification: he's the perfect sixties hero.
801;Luke is severely beaten but keeps fighting, and this.
802;wins him the men's respect.
803;Their admiration grows when he proves he can eat 50 hard.
804;But the men need a hero, and Dragline perpetuates the myth, telling them that he had that Luke smile to the very end.
805;newman's performance is among his best, and Luke is one of his definitive studies of non conformism.
806;As in Hombre, he underplays, but in a loose, relaxed, cool manner.
807;He's affecting in a wide range of moods: quiet detachment, wry contempt, raw courage, exhaustion, exuberance, gentleness, anger, resignation.
808;but Newman performs them with quiet conviction.
809;It's one of the most moving scenes in all of Newman's work.
810;paralleled to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Cool Hand Luke is a character study, which works beautifully, very well.
811;made with sense of graphic imagery and cinema view, a good.
812;looking film with superb photography in Color, extremely good as an entertainment.
813;All time best movie ever.
814;The cool nuances throughout the movie make it the best classic.
815;This film has become a cult classicand therefore definitely deserves *5* stars as he really immerses himself intoplaying Cool Hand Luke.
816;Would recommend anyone to watch.
817;One of Paul Newman's best movies no doubt.
818;Just causing people to laugh at you.
819;uplifting story but Luke cannot seem to get this notion through his head.
820;this one is probably a realistic portrayal of 1950s era prison life.
821;This is a great movie, but in Blu.
822;ray it is even better.
823;Probably one of the finest movies I have ever seen.
824;Paul Newman, George Kennedy and a cast of very young upcoming stars!
825;Wayne Rogers, Dennis Hopper, Joe Don Baker and Harry Dean Stanton add to a motion picture that say's, drop everything and watch!
826;This movie has got to have some of the most sweat I have ever seen.
827;Paul Newman is an incredible actor.
828;If you enjoy a great story line with wonderful actors this is the one.
829;One of the best movies you can ever see.
830;Paul Newman is great in this and i suggest blu ray so clear
831;Cool Hand Luke does his manual labor with zeal and Cool Hand Luke takes insane bets.
832;This makes for a much more realistic movie and a much more likable character.
833;Dean's character is much younger in age and in spirit.
834;cool Hand Luke is a popular film because the character is one that people can relate to and respect immensely.
835;If anyone has known someone similar, one can relate to this statement.
836;ray, with new special features.
837;There will be a making.
838;shaker: Making Cool Hand Luke, which the press release describes as an in.
839;depth look at the creation of an uncompromising classic.
840;It's played as part comedy, part gritty drama.
841;care attitude and escapades make him an icon among his fellow prisoners, until he is brought to abject desperation, ultimately rising again and falling to become a legend.
842;the film is famous for a hard.
843;The title character's nickname comes from another quote, made after he bluffs to win at poker: sometimes nothin' can be a real cool hand, a quote that has ironic punch in the context of the movie as a whole.
844;Newman was nominated for an Oscar, and George Kennedy won one for his supporting role.
845;Strother Martin is unforgettable as the twisted prison captain.
846;i enjoy this movie, but I've never completely loved it the way many do.
847;But it is a classic, with memorable characters, scenes, and storyline.
848;I'd probably give it four or four and a half stars, but I'll round up for the new special features, which I look forward to.
849;It was a wonderful experience for me, and this film, in particular, has meant much to me over the years.
850;Fantastic film if you like stories of extreme individualism with anti.
851;I appreciate it for many reasons.
852;I've had others join the list, LA Confidential among them, but it's still an impressive, thoughtful, subtle movie that I enjoy watching and rewatching.
853;It's COol Hand Luke and the picture is the best ever.
854;Also a few decent extras.
855;My favorite movie of all time.
856;If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it.
857;I love a good prison flick, and this one Really Delivers.
858;the film is a classic these days, with a great ensemble cast, and Newman as the anti.
859;And Newman is a New Arrival who earns everyones respect quickly.
860;The films follows the everyday life of these men in a small prison, and has everything you need in a prison movie.
861;The story is very basic, but like a lot of the classics, they do a lot with very little.
862;But this is nicely understated, so it does not give the film too heavy of a feeling or make it overly sappy.
863;the film also has a nice featurette in the special features which I quite like.
864;It's about a half hour, and has lots of cast and crew interviews.
865;I really like features like this, and it is done very well.
866;if you like classics, Paul Newman movies, Prison movies or just Good films, you check this out.
867;A terrific film that gets better with age.
868;It becomes more relevant and rewarding as the years go by, and it's earned it's status as a classic American movie.
869;release with interviews, commentary, relevant documentaries and perhaps the screenplay.
870;still, this is an okay transfer and the mono sound is clear enough.
871;once in prison, Luke joins a chain gang.
872;All goes well and, despite a rough start, the inmates begin to like him.
873;He even makes a friend in the form of Dragline, an illiterate man played by George Kennedy.
874;He is a loner who considers rules and regulations, as he puts it in the scene with the famous Night in the Box speech, nothin' worth listenin' to.
875;then there is the climactic scene with Lukein a church.
876;Luke refuses, and ironically gets shot.
877;Luke dislikes the need of his fellow inmates to latch onto him so tightly.
878;Luke dislikes rules, becoming a non.
879;This is a fantastic movie!
880;Paul Newman is always a winner and the rest of the cast is excellent as well.
881;Bought from Amazon US and I took a gamble on it.
882;what a fantastic story, just amazing and I then understood why I was a rebel of some sort who wanted more from Life and was willing to work for it.
883;the punch shots in your face, cinema at its best and we are talking the 1960 era here.
884;the acting was fantastic, looks like they all had fun making this one.
885;the movie story justs move on with great directing to a point in a cinema you will never leave your seat for a snack or the bathroom.
886;look at the sweat coming off the guys on blu ray, amazing.
887;the whole blu ray experiance is a must for such a great movie that has probably faded in the history of great movies.
888;have some iced cool drinks on hand also as this will make you feel hot.
889;cinemas world wide should have a day when they show epics on a grand scale to give the younger generation a chance to see movie making at its best without the usual digital imposed scenes that we see now.
890;I would recommend this to everyone who hasn't seen it and encourage those who have to see it again.
891;It is a great movie
892;Warden Struther Martin is oft quoted by young American men and some English teachers (Lesson 1: Now ah can be a nice guy, or ah can be one real meeeaaan sumbitch!
893;Lesson 2: You got to git yer mind right!
894;I love Paul Newman, and I love a lot of his movies.
895;If you've ever heard that phrase and wonder where it came from, it came from this classic movie.
896;acre for his own good.
897;luke can play the game and survive if he wants, but he'd rather keep his dignity.
898;out adds to the appeal of the character and the film.
899;Lots of funny moments, but lots more tragic and poignant moments.
900;p Oscar nominations galore and scenes you'll never forget.
901;The old ones were and always will The Best!
902;I enjoyed it again very much and I am sure you will as well.
903;stifling rules
904;For those who still enjoy this type of inspirational story of individualism, check out Sometimes a Great Notion .
905;excellent casting and acting (George Kennedy won best supporting actor Oscar for his role).
906;Cool Hand Luke is the story of a unique individual who gains a following among the inmates while serving time in a Southern prison for a drunken act of vandalism.
907;in his first few days at the prison, Luke manages to antagonize all three with his willfulness.
908;in time, Luke's spirit, which refuses to be chained by the conformity of prison life, and his selflessness, which causes him to sacrifice himself in order to entertain and educate his fellow inmates, make him a figure of admiration and affection within their ranks.
909;He escapes and is captured, and then escapes again.
910;we might deduce that Luke has died, since Dragline shares his memories of him, triumphant in defeat, with his fellow inmates.
911;Paul Newman stars as Luke along with a marvellous cast in a prison gang film set in the deep south.
912;Quite a few others will leave an impression on you as well.
913;most famously Mission Impossible) superbly atmospheric music as well.
914;My favorite Paul Newman movie.
915;He is 100% badass and charming as Luke.
916;It is in my top 10 favorite movies of all time
917;Paul Newman is riveting as the title character.
918;George Kennedy deserved his supporting Oscar.
919;The screenplay is probably the best thing about this movie.
920;There are so many great lines that come from this movie.
921;Overall, this is great movie making!!
922;he loved it ,he had been looking for this movie in stores.
923;To call `Cool Hand Luke' a classic is a vast understatement.
924;This has an amazing performance from Paul Newman as Luke, a loner who refuses to bow to the might of authority, whether it be in society or in the prison he is sent to.
925;He manages to inspire his fellow inmates with his humour and quiet dignity in the face of the warders cruelty and you can't help but connect with his character.
926;This has many memorable scenes and the egg eating scene is wonderfully funny and yet others scenes are especially poignant and emotional.
927;The direction is pretty good, if a little dated and stylised, but this only adds to the character and classic nature of the film on offer.
928;The supporting cast are very good in this film and the entire ensemble elevate this film from being merely good to being great.
929;This also has an excellent 'making of' documentary included on the extras.
930;Having heard a lot about this film over the years and never having seen it I am delighted I finally have and I can honestly see what all the fuss is about.
931;This has style, a great story, many famous lines and scenes and a wonderful anti establishment feel that makes you feel mildly rebellious just by watching it.
932;Mr Newman was excellent in this movie.
933;This movie is a favorite of our family.
934;Luke lives in a tiny southern town.
935;And he gets himself sentenced to a chain.
936;The Captain, with the help of the monstrous guards, makes it his mission to break Luke's spirit.
937;paul Newman is amazing in his role as Luke.
938;George Kennedy plays Luke's burly inmate pal, Dragline, with consummate skill.
939;Jo Van Fleet, gives a wonderfully poignant performance, as Luke's dying mother, Arleta.
940;in summation, Cool Hand Luke will always remain a classic of American cinema, for generations to come.
941;What is it about Cool Hand Luke that is so moving?
942;Well, it starts with Paul Newman's performance.
943;Lucas Jackson is one of the most psychologically complex characters in the history of cinema, and Newman, criminally denied the Oscar for this film, makes him seem larger.
944;Everything that comes out of his mouth is a revelation.
945;Suffice it to say that this is the movie that makes George Kennedy, of all people, seem noble.
946;G. Gordon Liddy, eat your heart out.
947;Then I bought Cool Hand Luke, and heard the P. man (that's Paul Newman, kids .
948;Cool Hand Luke is the ORIGINAL prison.
949;And it belongs in your library.
950;One of the best movies ever.
951;the spiritual predecessor of Cool Hand Luke from the decade prior.
952;Defiant to the end, Luke eventually forces a final confrontation between himself and the system he so despises.
953;Cool Hand Luke is merely a serviceable vehicle for Newman.
954;He turns in his usual stellar performance but the film is just one set piece after another interspersed with some occasional witty dialogue.
955;The film does have some high.
956;co. stars George Kennedy and Strother Martin are great and Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton and Wayne Rogers ably fill their smaller supporting roles.
957;Also, the interplay between Luke and his mother (Jo Van Fleet) is genuinely touching and helps to add tremendous emotional depth to Luke's character.
958;Great to add to my collection Thank you.
959;paul Newman, who was simply one good looking fellow, plays the part of an aimless war veteran who finds himself doing two years on a chain.
960;The release year of this film reflects it's content .
961;hero
962;It is difficult to find a movie that has all the elements of Cool Hand Luke, i. e., great screenplay, superb acting, great directing, and a wonderful musical score.
963;The friendship that develops between the character Dragline , beautifully played by George Kennedy, and Luke is wonderful to experience, as is Luke's constant search for God.
964;the movie is full of humor, for example the famous egg.
965;I think that is what has made it so appealing over the years.
966;i greatly appreciate the efforts of Director Stuart Rosenberg, Actor Paul Newman who gave, what I consider to be, the finest performance of his career, George Kennedy for his Academy Award winning performance, and composer Lalo Schifrin who wrote the beautiful musical score.
967;All who worked on this movie deserve great credit, because they created, what I consider to be, the greatest movie ever made.
968;ray remake of the original movie and it's well done.
969;One of Paul Newman's greatest roles.
970;Wonderful script and memorable characters.
971;Without a doubt, its a favorite movie for whole family.

977;Cool Hand Luke is the story of a good man's triumph against an oppressive environment and a social hierarchy.
978;It's definitely one of my top 10.
979;Cool Hand Luke, is outstanding.
980;Great cast of characters, as well as incredible acting.
981;Paul Newman gives a stellar performance.
982;Even when he told the truth about the fake photo and the final escape (you've got to watch it for context), they turn it into something that will support their hero fantasy.
983;Paul Newman embodied the role perfectly, this might be his most beloved role of his career probably even more than Butch Cassidy and Fast Eddie Felson.
984;Paul Newman exhibited great range as an actor, he got to be this really intense guy and then play the cool guy and then he's got to be really quietly moving without making any big acting dramatics.
985;He is truly one of the best actors.
986;there are lots of great moments particularly the now famous and infamous egg.
987;Strother Martin is great as the Captain .

996;allusions, which show that this film operates somewhere in the realm of myth and allegory.
997;It can be slow going, but there are some real pleasures.
998;His role is interesting and (as the Judas figure) crucial, but as always he overplays it.
999;(But there is one good fight scene between Newman and Kennedy.)
1000;A poignant exploration of Man and his relationship to God, Cool Hand Luke is also an excellent, entertaining movie.
1001;Paul Newman is at his peak both physically and as an actor portraying Luke Jackson, a man who is at odds with the authoritarian structure of life in general.
1002;Luke was obviously the hope of his family, and was the apple of his mother's eye.
1003;the movie is beautiful to look at.
1004;It is entertaining to play spot the future star during the prison barracks scenes (look fast for Dennis Hopper and Wayne Rogers).
1005;The final traffic light winks to red and you know that Luke was just standin' in the rain talkin' to myself.
1006;That's an idea worth thinking about no matter what your religious convictions.
1007;paul Newman plays the title character with the cool, easy going grace the part calls for.
1008;As in his brutal fight with Dragline (George Kennedy), Luke is fighting with a hand full of nuthin .
1009;He is to the prisoners.
1010;He is viewed as a mythic hero by the other prisoners.

1022;At first, Luke is disliked by many of his fellow inmates, but with time he comes to earn their respect.
1023;This is a great movie about a rebel who refuses to give in to authority no matter what the consequences.
1024;Highly recommended if you have not seen it.
1025;paul Newman gives one of his best performances as Lucas Jackson, a rebellious prisoner on a chain gang who refuses to give up or be beaten down by authority.
1026;George Kennedy won a Best Supporting Oscar for his role as Dragline, a fellow member of the chain gang who becomes Luke's friend.
1027;Strother Martin is excellent as the Captain, the warden of the facility who delivers the communication line.
1028;scene part, Jo Van Fleet is perfect as Arletta, Luke's dying mother.
