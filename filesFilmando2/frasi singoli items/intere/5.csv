id;spiegazione
1;Francis Ford Coppola using Vietnam as the setting for a loose adaptation of Joseph Conrad's modernist literary masterpiece Heart of Darkness was brilliant.
2;It rocks my world to this day.
3;I love some foreign films, but for me America has produced most of the greatest films.
4;Regardless of how ya feel about that, however, everything from the making of the film and about the film itself is interesting (See the excellent doc Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse for the ultimate making.
5;of, behind the scenes film).
6;*The script is compelling and suspenseful and contains some of the most memorable lines in recent film history.
7;*The setting is perfect and the story is based on a classic of literature.
8;*Great music in this picture too!
9;The use of The Door's The End at the beginning is incredible.
10;(I still love the film after having read Jameson's review, but he scores some points.)
11;Great war scenes at a bridge, on the river, on a beach, and in a village.
12;now that i think of it I really enjoyed the book, its contents are as deep you want them to be.
13;The indistinctness and complexity of Conrad's writing, coupled with his ability to mask and distract the reader make finding out and understanding the true meaning of his sentences a rather deceitful process.
14;this film portrays the book in a way in which very few have done before, never a film was capable of showing emotions in the way A. n does.
15;Coppola's controversial VietNam film is not only one of the many highlights from the last great decade of American filmmaking, but is one of my all time favorite films.
16;It's a work of demented genius.
17;It's one great scene after another: from the greatest opening scene in cinema history(a fire bomb attack scored to the Doors The End )to the famous Wagnerian helicopter assault to the bizzare USO show in the middle of nowhere and right up to its nightmarish dreamy conclusion this is a grand act of filmmaking on an insane level.
18;This is one of the few films I can watch endlessly.
19;The original is long enough as it is.
20;It's nice to be able to own this classic.
21;I think it's the best film of my lifetime and everytime I watch it I gain something new.
22;It's time to make a new film.
23;Darkness, madness and hallucinatory images of Hell pervade this stunning, mind.
24;blowing film set in the Vietnam War.
25;Herein Francis Ford Coppola has rendered a beautifully surreal work of art.
26;It has been studied, discussed, and pondered over
27;Undeniably, APOCALYPSE NOW has always packed a powerful punch, and nearly a quarter of a century of time has only served to intensify its transcendent force.
28;His trek down that river is an utterly absorbing, terrifyingly bizarre odyssey marked with all sorts of surreal, often nightmarish encounters.
29;the most memorable of which is Robert Duvall's Lt. Kilgore, a surfing fanatical, riotously brash helicopter commander who takes Willard and his men on a riveting aerial assault in a hot area.
30;Duvall's performance earned him an Oscar nomination.
31;the REDUX version also includes an exquisitely ethereal encounter with the French at a rubber plantation in the midst of the jungle.
32;Willard and his remaining men have dinner with the Frenchmen, and the conversation essentially courses through the many sundry themes of the movie entire.
33;It is here that The Doors' ominous opening number, The End, gains its relevance.
34;the performances in this amazing motion picture are simply tour de forces in every single aspect of the art of acting.
35;Then there's Brando, who, no matter who he is or what he's doing, cuts an unabashedly amazing figure on the screen.
36;not even such spectacular epics as ''Platoon'' and Kubrick's ''Full Metal Jacket,'' which I admit are utterly breathtaking films.
37;But ''Apocalypse Now'' is clearly a rare gem among all of them, and I'm glad I took the chance on it!This ''Redux'' version supposedly answers some ambiguous questions that had always baffled the old fans who were familiar with the original release, and upon learning what these scenes were makes me wonder why studio executive types always have to insist on carving away extremely important segments of film just to meet some arbitrary ''time restraints.''
38;Only one other film has had such a profound effect on me, and that was Orson Welles' ''Citizen Kane,'' which I had first seen only a few years ago as part of a special anniversary theatrical re.
39;Everyone should see this film at least once!
40;This movie, is quite simply one of the best movies ever made, but don't watch it as a historical view of the Vietnam War.
41;The original of this move is by far superior to the redux version.
42;He is a serious professional assassin whose inner life consists of missions.
43;The whole mission is a journey deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness, deeper into chaos, deeper into the jungle.
44;Then suddenly they are at a very beautiful and comfortable French Plantation with excellent French food, wine, and cognac.
45;Then a beautiful French lady, who smokes a huge thick cigar, takes Willard up to a beautiful bed room and lights an opium pipe for him and then closes a mosquito net around him while he relaxes in a comfortable bed.
46;the editor saved this film the first time.
47;I have always loved this movie for the actors, subject matter, and music.
48;I did not like the original cut, but APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX is one of the best films ever made, and the best movie about Vietnam.
49;the original, because the French Plantation scene was cut, lacked an intellectual edge.
50;But restoration also makes the film flow.
51;After I finished watching, I realized the film was more spiritual with the restored scenes included.
52;Everyone should experience this film.
53;A great adaptation of Joseph Conrad's Heart ofDarkness.
54;This film is so powerful on many levels
55;Truly one of the classic films of all time.
56;If anything, it goes to show you how a great director like Coppola was smart enough to take this out of the original in order to leave a more powerful message in the ending than simple mass destruction.
57;This is one of the few films that I would classify as not just an amazing motion picture but great art as well.
58;I too feel its one of Coppola's three masterpieces (including Godfather 1 and 2), which are among the greatest films of all time.
59;It was also rewarding to finally see the extra footage which I've heard about for so long .
60;it in fact, detracts from the film.
61;Contrary to some of these reviews, the original made perfect sense.
62;This is a prime example.
63;but as bonus footage as a special feature.
64;This movie, set in a vietnam jungle, is an adaption of the timeless Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad.
65;for 1979 it is a great movie, and though many of the combat scenes were unrealistic, and a lot of content was dark and indecipherable, Apocalypse Now brought about a lot of newer war movies, and brings about the message that Conrad attempted to convey much earlier.
66;What a great transfer of a fantastic and classic film.
67;This transfer is crystal clear and beautiful with only a little bit of visual noise, but it simply looks amazing, especially for it's age.
68;this movie should only be viewed in widescreen!
69;The real triumph however is the 5.1 soundtrack.
70;balanced, sharp and not overpowering.
71;Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece not because of anything specific.
72;The power of the film endures because it is so visceral and unlike anything else we expect.
73;The best part is, the end result came largely by accident and even a bit of insanity.
74;The original was memorable because it defies natural dramatic conventions.
75;There are some nice scenes with the Playboy bunnies, which are funny on their own, but seem really out of place and out of tone with the more nebulous theatrical cut.
76;The film is still beautiful looking, but I'm not a fan.
77;He is a modern day Caravaggio and Apocalypse Now is his magnum visual opus.
78;ray does great justice to his perfection in most areas.
79;70s era wide angle lens distortions are easily visible.
80;Contrast and colors are powerful, if occasionally unnaturally crushed.
81;Bottom line, this is a nice release, and appropriate for a 70s era film, but not a stunner.
82;on the sound side, the mix is crisp and fluid.
83;This is a good one to crank up as it makes efficient use of surround speakers.
84;I understand why people consider Apocalypse Now a great film.
85;From a cinematic perspective, it's a powerful, even riveting piece of work.
86;From there, it descended into a piece of self.
87;Those dramatic shots of Brando in darkness, dramatically raising his face to the light!
88;Sheen dramatically emerging out of the river, face blackened!
89;An art film that mocks its subjects, annihilates a literary classic, and turns the Vietnam War experience into a circus freak show.
90;It's a great price for both versions of the film.
91;So much for the director's vision.
92;the Vietnam War, acid trips, and a great time is what this movie consists of.
93;Beautifully directed and acted, this film shows the kinds of mental challenges faced by men at war.
94;On top of that is one of the best war scenes in movies of all time.
95;Absolutely beautiful video captivates all viewers and Dolby Digital remastered surround sound envelops the listeners, taking them far into Vietnam and Cambodia.
96;All I can say is that if one collects films or likes films in any way, he or she should have this set immediately.
97;it is studied by students in film schools world wide,and movie buffs like myself.
98;This was and will always be a masterpiece, some people say that now the film was ruined.
99;What more can you ask, plus the film is amazing, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the story, the actors, the acting, everything.
100;The picture and audio were fine until about an hour and 15 minutes into the hi.
101;I asked for and received a full refund.
102;Having made films in hollywood for over 12 years I can with reasonable confidence make commentary on a brilliant film.
103;The metaphor of this story and the way it was made represent the duality of good and evil and how crossing the bridge, or getting off the boat take you into insanity.
104;Just grab a bottle of JD (or what ever you drink) and a pack of smokes and enjoy this one alone.
105;Special recommendation: learn to love those little black bars on the screen they show you the whole picture.
106;There are two major new segments and new little bits that help to understand better the surreal story of the film.
107;The little bits of scenes are great and sure make the movie more pleasant.
108;Absolutely recommendable to every one who loves the classic movies.
109;Starring Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Fredric Forrest, Larry Fishbourne, and Dennis Hopper, Apocalypse Now trades Conrad's African setting for the then.
110;the film's premise is deceptively simple.
111;surfer) points out, Charlie controls the mouth of the river.
112;Still, Kilgore agrees to escort Willard and his PBR for two reasons: he loves a good battle, and the location is ideal for surfing.
113;In a terrifying yet oddly exhilarating sequence, we see Kilgore's Huey armada sweeping in on the seaside village with the morning sun behind them and Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries blaring from their loudspeakers.
114;winning (The Godfather Parts I and II) director turned to the Philippine Army, which lent its Hueys and other toys to the production.
115;It's also well known that Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack during filming.
116;According to Dale Pollock's 1983 biography Skywalking: The Life and Films of George Lucas, the concept of the journey to Kurtz via a boat was Lucas'.
117;(If you look closely, though, you'll see a visual homage to Coppola's friend and protege: the intelligence officer played by Harrison Ford wears a name tag with the name Lucas on his fatigues jacket.)
118;I completely acknowledge and admit that this movie is great in many ways, but my enjoyment of it only extends to pretty good.
119;The Valkyries scene is great and it's always incredibly tense, but some of the imagery just doesn't jive with me.
120;Francis Ford Coppola's engaging Vietnam war story is considered to be one of the greatest films ever made.
121;While I'm not sure about that,I am sure of the fact that I do enjoy watching this movie.
122;Wonderful performances through out the cast(Martin Sheen is excellent in his role.
123;Also the supporting players like,Robert Duvall,and Marlon Brando)!
124;The highlights here are the truly outstanding cimatography by Vittorio Storaro(A Bertolucci regular).
125;Brando's horror soliloquy is up there with some of the grestest moments ever filmed.
126;This is a must for movie lovers.
127;Apocalypse Now is Francis Ford Copella's visually stunning retelling of Joseph Conrad's anti.
128;I would also recommend Hearts of Darkness, the documentary about the filming of Apocalypse Now and the effect it had on both cast and crew.
129;According to the sources, the audio was greatly cleaned up, especially at the first of the movie.
130;I remember seeing the original at the theater in around 1979 (?)
131;the audio is vastly superior.
132;the meh comes from all the added footage.
133;Redux is interesting to watch, just because it's there, but I prefer the original cut.
134;This is my favourite movie of all time and I was really looking forward to the release of this box set.
135;I watched this movie long time ago, i was looking for it i could not find it any where thanks to amazon, i got it and i give it to my friend to watch it too and they love it.
136;And yes, I'm including Spielberg's 1941 in my consideration.
137;The original version of Apocalypse Now is probably my second favorite movie of all time.
138;the reason why this is getting such great reviews is because people think that they finally understand the film with all the extra scenes added in.
139;These extra scenes have made a wonderful film into a straight.
140;forward summer action picture where things blow up real good.
141;Would recommend for war history lovers and those looking for understanding of the underlying issues still affecting us today.
142;I've seen the longer version but found the original to be the best of the two.
143;It portrays the Vietnam war in stunning and very accurate fashion, it's a graphic movie, not for all viewers.
144;This is a must see for all war buffs and fans.
145;So get the popcorn out and enjoy!
146;I've seen Apocalypse Now a number of times and own the original.
147;See it this way and you'll be grateful for the experience.
148;(There are certainly a few decent lines in the dinner scene, but the digression overall takes the viewer out of the central movie plot and out of the visceral experience of moving up river.)
149;If this is the best Coppola Co. can come up with from 20 years reflection and 150 hours of source footage, this is more evidence than anyone needs that the original is a masterpiece that should be left alone.
150;One of the timeless movies, I have watched that feels like you were part of the insanity during the conflict.
151;I always loved this movie but vhs didnt do it justice.
152;Can someone please enlighten me on this one
153;yes, it is long, but even the long drawn out parts are very well done, and draw the viewer in.
154;I loved Brando in this movie.
155;This is an amazing film and highly recommended.
156;Wonderful piece which defines cinema.
157;the movie is a bumpy ride and does stay true to the tone and theme developed in the novel.
158;If you haven't seen this movie before or it's been awhile, it'll be a pleasure.
159;Very few movies leave me with a sense of awe and deference to the makers of the film.
160;This aspect could also prove important for understanding the situation the film depicts.
161;This movie is quite simply a masterpiece.
162;It is worthy of any and all praise it receives.
163;Apocalypse Now ranks as one of the very few movies that is a must see for everyone.
164;Always a classic and a pleasure to rewatch.
165;Soundtrack, direction and the actors all come together in this masterpiece.
166;this is a good question.You have to agree with Kurtz (brando)This film will hit you right in the face,right where it hurts.
167;I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
168;But still, for any true fan, this new set is excellent.
169;it City, make sure you see the bonus extra disc sticker on the packaging.
170;But I do have a multi.
171;But other than that, there's hours of good stuff here for the greatest film ever made and for any true fan, this is a refreshing edition to the Apocalypse Now lore and the price of $12.99 really is a piece of wisdom from Coppola, who unlike other directors, such as Ridley Scott, are hosing fans for as much as they can milk them for when special editions come out.
172;Because you either fight or surf!
173;The films title alone, `Apocalypse Now', is synonymous with classic
174;All the praise and admiration that has been heaped upon this film over the years has embedded in us the very idea that it must be `that' great.
175;I love the whole `swords.
176;My perspective on the genre changed a bit when I witnessed Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece `Full Metal Jacket', a film that is truly astonishing, but understandably very `love it or hate it'.
177;One is brought into the mentality of one ravaged by war, and the mental and emotional deterioration is overwhelming
178;the film, to me, is shot much like a wartime film noir, with Martin Sheen narrating the film, filling in the complete story for the audience.
179;Frances Ford Coppola is a fantastic director who savagely moves from location to location, painting a horrific picture (`the horror') that stimulates our senses and engages our minds.
180;The script is brilliantly crafted in a way that engages you from start to finish, never bogging us down and boring us in any way but always keeping our interest.
181;Robert Duvall (who was nominated for an Oscar) is extremely memorable as Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore.
182;He truly captures the man that was Kilgore and emulates a human passion on the screen.
183;There are many reports about the issues Coppola had working with Brando (his excessive weight gain, his drinking problems, his apathetic attitude and his not knowing of his lines) but when all is said and done Brando pulled out a passionate and devastatingly haunting performance as the renegade Kurtz.
184;Coppola's masterpiece is a film not to be missed for it relays a message that is all to real.
185;Seriously, it's a good film, but having watched the Deer Hunter the night before, I found it a bit tame.
186;The plot is easy to follow: a soldier is requested to track down a top.
187;I'm not a big fan of the redux, but the special features are amazing.
188;There is a whole show on the music.
189;I'm not much on Vietnam War films, but Apocalypse Now was a great one, and Redux was even better.
190;The sound and the picture is excellent.
191;I was surprised, the first time I saw it, about how many people were in it.
192;But until then, Redux will still be better than the original.
193;Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is a pure example of method filmmaking.
194;It is the true craftmanship of an essential filmmaker.
195;The art direction, editing and sound effects are partially a small fragment which makes this film classical and memorable.
196;What drives the integrity and semblance of the film is the storyline, acting and inner message.
197;Not many directors have the ambition or the true courage to establish such a well.
198;What is most interesting is that an American filmmaker spoke his style and the style of the film's collaborators through the continuance of the film.
199;the plot is fairly simple and brief, adapted by Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness.
200;Throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences.
201;The most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks.
202;Throughout the sequence we hear Wagner's 'Ride Of The Valkyries'.
203;The starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie
204;this film has its famous moment, some better to be kept quiet about until they come through the screen.
205;He was right to the date.
206;It is really jaw dropping.
207;ray must truly have been a labour of love.
208;The documentary Hearts of Darkness is a must.
209;see and is enthralling from start to finish.
210;ray format to date this would be one of the 'must' owns.
211;Absolute classic tale of the vietnam war.
212;a unique mix of reality with just the right amount of fictional dimension.
213;Great scenery, terrific sound trac, excellent acting.
214;It was strange, disturbing, violent, seemingly immoral, and guess what, i loved it.
215;Everything from Martin sheen's inner monologue, to the films striking cinematography to its intense plotting works cohesively to bring this films intensity and brillianceIn a large sense, it is an extremely artistic film.
216;The entire movie is immensely visual and surreal.
217;The camera gets everything from sweeping shots of helicopters flying over the Vietnamese landscape to ominous close.
218;another striking component to the film is its foreboding soundtrack.
219;the sensual aspects a film can only take you so far unless the subject matter holds your attention as well.
220;apocalypse Now is an extremely representational film.
221;Apocalypse Now does its job phenomenally and holds your attention long after the film is over.
222;even when you have paid your $80 fee for the year they can still charge you.
223;He went to see it in the theater way back in the day.
224;The movie stands up wonderfully .
225;indeed, it is even better than I remembered.
226;It's a hoot to see Harrison Ford in a bit part, and Martin Sheen's character surely provides rich back.
227;story for Jed Bartlett, rather the way John Wayne's previous roles made True Grit so persuasive.
228;just one reservation: the Redux version is slower, due to self.
229;This is one of my favorite movies.
230;That was so expressive, it totally illustrated the situation and got you in a right mood.
231;And your trance is supported throughout the whole movie by excellent music, beautiful long frames and a caravan of endless, seemingly pointless and seemingly dull scenes.
232;And the longer the movie the more effect it has on you.
233;Coppola's creative energy poured out on me right from the screen.
234;That's why I think Coppola fully demonstrated his immense talent in this picture making it (the picture) one of the best war and anti.
235;It's definately hard to watch, but if you try really well, you'll be rewarded with an unforgettable (but not always pleasant) journey to the places you've probably never been to.
236;martin Sheen and Marlon Brando are superb, just awesome, besides here you can meet outstanding Robert Duvall, Harrison Ford, hard.
237;it just thrills me when I read about how many obstacles and difficulties the makers of Apocalypse Now had while filming.
238;It's his huge merit Apocalypse Now finally saw the light of day.
239;I have owned this since the VCR came out, I thought I had the ultimate on Laser Disk .
240;everything is so clean and clear .
241;The directing, photography and music are great.
242;This movie is timeless and can be enjoyed for many more years.
243;In many ways we lost a generation somewhere out there in that dark jungle, and this movie remains amazingly topical and fresh to those of us of a certain age .
244;I know first hand what air mobile means and how innovative it felt at the time.
245;Every year I go down to the wall a touch the names of soldiers and friends and classmates.
246;i've seen this movie numerous times and never noticed.
247;Apocalypse was never a realistic movie, but more a fever dream, delirious and poetic and weird.
248;if you see the documentary Coppola's wife made about the actual filming of Apocalypse now, you see the young Francis dissatisfied with the French Plantation and accordingly cutting it.
249;I'll keep the older flick and let this one pass.
250;Both acted like they had something to prove to the world, which they don't.
251;Both are great actors in their own respective ways but this movie did not do them justice.
252;The symbolism,and metaphors throughtout film are so well done, you truly appreciate the wizardry of Coppola.
253;Apocalypse now is one of my favorite films of all time and one of the most powerful.
254;we finally can see it properly in home theatres.
255;It is a modern understanding of Conrad's Heart of Darkness, preserving every bit of the darkness and intent of the original novel to demonstrate once again what lies deep within the souls of men and the jungles of our hearts.
256;This seems to be my only qualm though, as the case may have it, because otherwise I enjoyed the characters.
257;There is this, however: if what you enjoyed most about the original was its unique atmosphere of bad.
258;one thing is about ANR is superior, though: the new Technicolor print of the movie is absolutely gorgeous, pretty much convincing me that this is the most beautifully.
259;shot color film of the last 50 years.
260;see making of documentary HEARTS OF DARKNESS.
261;Its great it has both versions, the only problem is that the extended version is a little bit long.
262;rays that provides a wealth of information on the making of a film.
263;Orson Welles' radio broadcast of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (the film's source material) is included in full.
264;There are new interviews with John Milius and Coppola as well.
265;it's a handsomely mounted set.
266;But if you've always wanted the best home video version of this masterpiece, get it.
267;This is the best war movie of all time.
268;The original cut was great because, outside of the perfection of its cinematography and sound (Vittorio Storaro and Walter Murch are geniuses), it worked so well as an allegorical journey straight into the center of the insanity of war.
269;Still, additions aside, the movie is still filled with amazing moments and it's hard to complain about the chance to see it all in a theater.
270;This version is okay but the director's cut is better in theme.
271;The entire VietnNam era is, for many of us, the defining moment of our generation.
272;Coppola has caught the essence of the zeitgeist to perfection.
273;In this one instance, this fictionalized history.
274;It seemed perfectly logical to me, in a Lewis Carroll sort of way.
275;I can still see Lyndon Johnson's face on Huntley.
276;immolation clearly in my mind.
277;it's good to see a war movie portraying things as they were perceived by the entire generation.
278;I would recommend viewing both of these films back to back.
279;I am a big fan of Apocalypse Now, and watched it when it first came to the theaters back in the late 70's.
280;There are many films endings and variations of this film, which makes it the more interesting, I also got the Redux version with the additional scenes, which makes the movie even more stranger, but I have to say, this special edition is excellent due in part to the commentary by Francis Ford Coppola.
281;I know the movie by heart, but it is nice to know the inner workings and stories that come straight from the Director himself.
282;If your a fan of this movie, it is worth getting this edition.
283;I bought it, because in Europe we wont get this fantastic set of film.
284;fantastic Sound (where do you get a 5.1 Version of Ride of the Valkyries) and the Picture looks amazing.
285;a movie for people easily impressed by shadows and lies.
286;The whole movie makes you wait for some huge revelation.
287;One of the best movies made about Viet Nam.
288;It will be enjoyed for many more years to come.
289;A classic of the vietnam war genre.
290;It was a joy to spend more time with the ensemble of memorable characters populating this film, from the shockingly violent portrayal by Martin Sheen as the young captain sent as an assassin on a mission to terminate a renegade Colonel's command with extreme prejudice, to Robert Duvall's stunning performance as a gung.
291;And so we venture as Sheen and the crew of his patrol boat take a journey up the river into the heart of darkness.
292;This is a ride well worth taking, and an even more unforgettable movie in its new and extended re.
293;It's good to see that after 20 years, this film can still engender so much passion and controversy.
294;breaking documentary Hearts of Darkness about the making of Apocalypse Now with location shots and the pure hell of putting a masterpiece together.
295;sized plasma TV will have you weeping for a two.
296;This is a look at the real inner dimensions of our lives.
297;I know there's room Paramont and Zoetrope!But I'm going to talk about what is here, and with the exception of the whole changing discs things(don't mind it on the extended cuts of The Lord of the Rings movies however) this is an excellent collection for fans of this flawed masterpiece.
298;The movies look great and the sound is excellent.
299;All the extras are great and informative and show even more behind the scenes mayhem that went into making this movie.
300;Add to that, the packaging here is great and fits the movie perfectly.
301;if you like this film, in either of it's versions, you will more than likely dig this package.
302;for people who are new to this film then this is the edition you should get.
303;a dissapointing but still worthwhile collection.
304;I bought the full dossier version about 5 years ago and hoped for 2 years that this will come out on blu ray.
305;To properly understand this awesome movie one must first read Heart of Darkness.
306;and after that the movie can truly be enjoyed.
307;This is one of the best movies of all time by one one of the best directors, with one of the best actors, and based one of the best books of all time.
308;Any movie lover worth their salt will have seen this movie.
309;The Redux version adds 49 minutes to the original movie, among them, the dinner scene with the French.
310;The movie also leads us to The Hollow Men by T. s. Eliot, a great poem Wurtzs (Brando) is reading at the end of the movie.
311;In the middle of the movie, in one of the best scenes in movie history .
312;A lot of references between the movie, literature, and music (good Rock tracks by The Doors, etc.) that make this movie a great asset of the American culture.
313;I am torn between a good or excellent rating and a modest one.
314;One of the best assets of this movie is Martin Sheen, who is absolutely great and carries his character in a mesmerizing way.
315;I honestly think I need to watch this movie several more times, to completely understand it.
316;this edition comes with both versions of the film, both the original masterpiece and the inferior.
317;This is undoubtedly the best the film has ever looked.
318;The audio is similarly excellent.
319;the included documentary is a big plus for fans, as previously it was only available separately.
320;given the wonderful transfer, the abundance of extras, and the rather nice packaging I would not hesitate to call this this best available version of the film and an absolute must.
321;The helicopter scenes are amazingly shot, it comes together superbly.
322;apocalypse Now touches on elements of this war which Platoon did not, and is an excellent abstractual depiction.
323;This is a visionary film.
324;everyone's performances in this movie are incredible.
325;Sheen is brilliant in the lead role.
326;Duvall, Brando, and Fishburne are equally impressive, but it is Hopper who gives the final section of the movie its bizarre manic state.
327;It's a hard movie to watch but definatley a true cinimatic masterpiece.
328;This set has EVERYTHING a fan of this movie could ask for .
329;have companion movie) got treated to that.
330;Other than that, Coppola's commentary is fantastic and so are his conversations with Martin Sheen and John Millius.
331;I've seen it before, and needless to say that it adds such a broader perspective to the film.
332;It adds little to the story, and detracts more than it helps.
333;The guy who did the editing on the cutting room floor was a genius.
334;Though seeing the French Plantation scene was a bit interesting.
335;It's still a great movie though.
336;Toss in some songs from the 60's era (The Best of the Doors.
337;scale war movie that ranks among the best movies of all.
338;Martin Sheen has the role of a lifetime as Captain Willard, and he does deliver a credible performance.
339;Robert Duvall creates a brilliant character
340;Grandly majestic war sequences are awe.
341;Simply masterful filmmaking from Coppola.
342;Extras: Laurence Fishburne and Harrison Ford in small roles, also spot Francis Ford Coppola in a cameo.
343;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film a 10!
344;It was good seeing Mr. Sheen in action although it probably took him in the wrong direction for future movies.
345;I love this movie, I can watch over and over.
346;This movie was made true to life.
347;The original Apocalypse Now was a darkly themed masterpiece about the horrors of war and the battle for ones sanity.
348;It is also a masterpiece directed by one of the greatest directors of all time.
349;the original movie was extremly focused and intense and the additional scenes took away from that aspect.
350;Part of the genious of the original is the tension between Willard and the crew, and it is all but lost here.
351;but saying that, it's still Apocalypse Now, and it's still a visual stunning and mostly well acted movie.
352;How about one with both cuts of the film, alternate takes, the academy awarding winning making of documentary, some comentary, interviews with the cast members and so and so forth.
353;Although it was a sad time in American History, I thought the movie was well done and interesting to watch.
354;The thing about this movie is that it's definately an auteur adult film.
355;The sound was absolutely incredible!
356;But then all of the great movies in my opinion are a bit abstract.
357;That's what makes them stand up over time and allows one to watch them again and again.you get something new just about every time.
358;I watched it, thought it was decent, and moved on.
359;It didn't really strike me as a masterpiece of filmmaking.
360;But last night I really saw the greatness in this movie and its concepts.
361;Now maybe my movie appreciation is greater now that I'm moving into the art and business of making films.
362;it's a taste you acquire and learn to appreciate as an adult.
363;And movies to me seem to be something that you appreciate the subtleties of more and more as you mature.
364;I loved the fun of Star Wars when I was a kid.
365;I then appreciated it for its movie making as a young adult.
366;And now I get the more spiritual and moral values of the movie.
367;Combine all of those things and you have a masterpiece movie that you can watch over and over throughout your life.
368;I seen this movie many times but the Redux version is possibly as good as it gets.
369;Furthermore the dialogue is astounding and is very successful in exploring the atavistic tendancies of man that was a part of not only Conrad's work but the Vietnam War as well.
370;Sheen puts in a great performance as do Harrison Ford and Dennis Hopper in supporting rolls.
371;The film is topped with great performances my Martin Sheen and Robert Duvall.
372;The other actors in the film are also great.
373;The cinematography is excellent and the great transfer does not dissapoint.
374;The sound is pretty good, but it could've used a little more bass.
375;Overall it's a disc well worth purchasing.
376;About the most powerful, gripping, and engrossing war film ever.
377;during these moments I could almost feel the intense heat and smell the jungle.
378;I have yet to be able to finish the film.
379;I was 11 when this movie was released (1979), and over the years I pretty much forgot about it.
380;now, this movie was entertaining, but it certainly wasn't ground breaking.
381;The music was odd
382;Definitely one of the best transfers I've experienced.
383;Advice is to spend a few extra dollars and get the original.
384;what can I say its a legendary movie.
385;Must have movie that is wonderful every time
386;Amazon customer service is great.
387;ray disc in the package plays fine.3.
388;ray discs in my collection, and all play fine, repeatedly.
389;Apocalypse Now plays fine on this player.
390;This is one of the greatest films ever made.
391;When I first saw it, i was blown away by how excellent it is.
392;Other reviewers seem to think that this version is worse than the original, but come on, thius is a frickin good film.
393;more of a psychological tour de force.
394;Yes, perhaps the frecnh plantation scene does go on a little to long, but as I say, there is no perfect film.
395;Great performances, especially from robert duvall, expertly staged battle scenes and a very atmospheric tone make this one of my all time favorites
396;Nobody makes films like this anymore.
397;If you haven't seen this yet, see it.
398;So many classic scenes, so many classic lines, and such a powerful film.
399;I am sure you all know this is one of the greatest films ever made.
400;Some really great extras .
401;I really liked the Dolby stuff.
402;A must for any lover of great sound.
403;It was good but it is even better now.
404;Shocking, futuristic and realistic at the same time.
405;Few movies have matched this over the years and it is now a part of my family's home video collection(thank you Amazon.
406;Notwithstanding some of the epic scenes that highlight this film, perhaps my favorite scene is the dinner brief.
407;This subtle work of art revolves largely around Harrison Ford
408;Best war movie another favorite war time movie my husband loves.
409;there are a handful of truly great Vietnam war films, and they generally each cover their own ground.
410;Full Metal Jacket is kind of the exception in that it covers ground the other three all do separately.
411;scale effect on the psyche of a veteran.
412;It might, overall, be the most terrifying and compelling of them all.
413;It's epic, punctuated by scene after scene which turns dark and twisted, and the protagonist is self.
414;compelled, moving forward into hell without knowing why.
415;This is a picture that includes epic scenes filmed on the grandest scale possible(Helo attack with Wagner blarring, for example) and scenes in which are so quiet and contemplative you wonder if this was not just some elongated music video.
416;this is an adventure of visual and auditory imagery that tells its own plot.You go on the journey up the Mekong Delta with the crewmembers of the plastic patrol boat.
417;the soundcrew and cinematography crew won well.
418;the new widescreen special edition is even better.
419;(Film has been remastered and must be viewed with surround to appreciate!)
420;Use of The Doors in opening and ending scenes probably introduced a new generation to the genius of Jim Morrison as well!This is a brilliant piece of cinema and was well worth what Coppola went through to get it off the ground!
421;Fantastic excitement breath takingKeep you on the eadge of you seat,the color spectrum and sound are great you'll love it.
422;While the fighting is still going on, he orders a couple of his soldiers to either surf or fight , being that he is a huge fan of surfing.
423;It is from Duvall's character that we get the immortal line, I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
424;This scene, which makes no sense in the context of a typical war movie, makes perfect sense in this film.
425;Copolla never makes either clear, but rather leaves that to the imagination of the viewer.
426;There are bodies everywhere .
427;All in all, an extremely powerful and moving film, although rather slow.
428;Regardless of which version you see, Apocalypse Now, is a brilliantly flawed piece of filmaking that has more power than anything released in Hollowood the last decade or so (Saving Private Ryan being the only possible exception).
429;The performances by Martin Sheen and Robert Duvall are among the best of their careers while Marlon Brando's weird entry into the film's last half hour are contrversial and unlike anything seen before or since.
430;that siad, the Redux version both adds to and detracts from the movie itself.
431;The additional footage is going to be of most interest to big fans of the film (like me).
432;It is still better and you still see more than in full frame pan&scan.
433;It is still a masterpiece movie and the additional scenes are needed.
434;It makes the film feel more complete.
435;Sporting a Lord Of The Flies theme, Apocalypse Now is an unforgettable film every movie buff should see at least once.
436;fascinated with the Darwinian nature of the world around them.
437;Will Willard successfully carry out his mission, or will Kurtz have the last say?
438;Apocalypse Now leaves its audience in the grips of smothering suspense in anticipation of the final outcome.
439;His reputation as a master of the big screen is solidified following a career which boasted of such masterful films as The Godfather (also a Francis Ford Coppola production).
440;In addition, Brando's performance is complimented by a younger Martin Sheen who does well with an extremely complicated role.
441;And notable brief appearances by Harrison Ford (Colonel Lucas) and Dennis Hopper (a photojournalist) help to make Apocalypse Now a cult classic among those who study the careers of Hollywood stars.
442;Many reputable critics rank the film in their top 100 of all.
443;time, and the film is certain to provoke emotions in one direction or another.
444;class director, great writing, and an all.
445;star cast, Apocalypse Now is a film that lives up to its hype.
446;This film has a special meaning for me.
447;a canoe trip took us to the set of Apocalypse Now.
448;i will only say that this is a fantastically well made movie, it is incrediblyentertaining and it's worth seeing just on those bases.
449;but it's a complex story that merits a lot more analysis than I'm qualified tospeak to.
450;short story: I'm simple minded enough to love a truly great movie like thiseven on its simplest terms.
451;If so, that might make a good movie.
452;Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece that every civilized person must see.
453;There are scenes from the movie, and phrases spoken in the movie, that have entered our popular language.
454;This is a move that must be seen again after a few years as it grows better with time, like a fine madeira.
455;I had forgotten how good this movie is, with a fantastic cast.
456;Apocalypse now is a good look at the Vietnam war.
457;The trip up river is a rollercoaster of emotions.
458;Playing ride of the valkryes during the attack on the village was one of the best uses of classical music since 2001.
459;The dialouge between Kurtz and Willard is the best Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando ever did.
460;This movie is a thriller i recomand it.
461;Vittorio Storaro, the acclaimed cinematographer of this and many other films, has, in recent years, gone on a crusade to advocate 2.00:1 as the most desirable widescreen ratio.
462;Most of this story is believable.
463;Good blue ray print and sound.
464;This is a top notch, classic war movie that captures the duality and extremes of human nature unlike any other.
465;This one ranks up in my top 5 all time favorites.
466;Few know that this movie is actually based on the Heart of Darkness, a novel by Joseph Conrad.
467;Excellent picture and sound, with great extras.
468;Also, these are classic film characters.
469;It 's possible to not enjoy the genre of war movies and still love Apocalypse Now, since what it's really about is the human mind.
470;Coppola takes the viewer into a dreamlike state to evoke how the mind might cope with prolonged trauma.
471;The cinematography and script are top.
472;I liked how surreal the film is, especially the surfing references.
473;One of the best movies of all times.
474;The madness of war is rising from the beginning to the end .
475;brilliant actors, Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen.
476;We all know how important Apocalypse Now is to the history of film, a true masterpiece.
477;This is more than just a movie.
478;This was a war crimes movie but I've always lovedwatching it.
479;Apocalypse Now is a film that stays with you.
480;These actors play the roles perfectly, and really get the point across.
481;The first, some of the finest war scenes in any type of media, ever.
482;The second, a psychological trip into Kurtz's mind.
483;the script is really the shining point of this movie.
484;Waltz's speech will chill you to the bone, and every word Sheen's character speak seems real, and something that his character will say.
485;Martin Sheen, in his absolute finest performance, is a captain sent by his higher ups in the army to kill the renegade Colonel Kurtz who it can no longer control.
486;He is magnificently played by Marlon Brando in a performance equal to his in Streetcar and Last Tango.
487;Every performance in this film is top notch though from Robert Duvall as the surfing obsessed commander who bases his every Vietnam mission on where it is best for his men to surf to Dennis Hopper who is based with Kurtz and has equally lost his mind plus a score of others.
488;The soundtrack is magnificent and Jim Morrison's Doors' performance of The End suits this film to a tee.
489;The cinematographer won the Oscar for his efforts and deservedly so.
490;The action is over the top, the characters are colorful, and the plot line just bizarre enough.
491;I found Apocalypse Now Redux to be an excellent reintroduction to a film that I have not seen in over 20 years.
492;the story is the classic story of Ulysses and his sailors encountering adventure after adventure
493;the most telling lines in the film is the description Kurtz gives of the mission to give polio vaccine to a village of South Vietnamese sympathizers.
494;chief from Louisiana has maturity and common sense and it is symbolic that he has his head cut off.
495;When Ho Chi Minh, an expert on the United States Constitution, ask Secretary Dulles for help driving out the French so that the Vietnames could have freedom and democracy, the Secretary of State sided with the French to maintain a balance of power in Europe becuase of fear of Stalin.
496;This series of events is discussed tangentially at the French family's dinner table.
497;first of all, the packaging is creative.
498;Simply put, it's a nice box.
499;overall, this is a great film that deserves to be watched all the way through continuously.
500;It took an act of genius on Copolla's part to identify the psychological parallels between Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness and the American experience in Vietnam.
501;At first, Kurtz wept, but then he came to see the sheer genius of it.
502;To prove his point, Kurtz fled to the jungle and began fighting the Viet Kong with a comparable degree of horror and ruthlessness.
503;I know that critics liked this movie about Viet Nam, but I have to disagree.
504;If they wanted to know what Viet Nam was like, I would recommend Oliver Stone's 'Platoon,' because that was as close to my experience of Viet Nam that I have seen.
505;Apocalypse Now has the most powerful opening moments I've ever seen in cinema, perfectly setting the next 180 minutes' grim delirious tone.
506;When I experienced it again in a theater after twenty.
507;throughout the film, it's amazing how anarchic Coppola presents the behavior of the young soldiers.
508;the cinematography, editing, acting (including a fifteen.year old Laurence Fishburne and a pre.
509;rehab Dennis Hopper) are all just amazing.
510;All in all i'd say this is a perfect product.
511;I enjoyed the movie and found it to be an accurate representation of river combat.
512;Born out of creative chaos
513;a. kind film remains, powerful, exciting, horrifying and intensely beautiful.
514;Both the original an Redux versions are included along with some amazing extras, not the least of which being the feature length Documentary Hearts of Darkness A Filmmakers Apocalypse.
515;I had seen the movie 20 years back, at a much impressionable age.
516;The story recreates an epic mission to the nether world, the one that resides in the heart of every man.
517;In a way Kurtz's world replicates the very heart of darkness that he has run away from.
518;Marlon Brando's cameo has immortalised Kurtz as one of the most memorable cinematic characters of all time.
519;What is more, Sheen harbours a streak of respect for his target, whom he approaches with a sense of awe and uncertainty.
520;The scale and intensity of its narration make the movie unforgettable.
521;The surrealistic world of Kurtz's community shocks the viewer with its dangling deadbodies, filth, haunting music and the shades of darkness.
522;there is talk of reviving the movie in a bigger, better and more disturbing avatar.
523;New footage will be added, including a rejuvenated 'playboy plamate' scene.
524;Before Oliver Stone and Stanley Kubrick tackled the subject of the Vietnam War in two controversial movies that were brought to worldwide acclaim, veteran filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola (fresh from his success in The Godfather) brought to the cinema screens a powerful, controversial film about Vietnam, and the madness that followed with it.
525;Since its debut in 1979, Coppola's Apocalypse Now has gone on to become a classic film and one of two accurate descriptions of the Vietnam Conflict.
526;as Coppola has stated, It is sexier, funnier, more bizarre, more romantic, and is more politically intriguing.
527;It also lets the audience feel the immediacy, the insanity, the brutality, the exhilaration, the sensuousness, the horror, the hypocracy, and the moral dilemma of America's most surreal, losing, and nightmarish war.
528;It also certainly more enjoyable than reading Sarah Dailey's one dimesional column pieces in The Louisville Cardinal.
529;marlon Brando, Martin Sheen, Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall, and all of the other actors do a remarkable job in the roles they were given.
530;The extra scenes that are placed back into the film, fit seamlessly and add an extra dimension to the plot.
531;As always, Brando does a remarkable performance.
532;By making Kurtz a tragic figure, Brando is able to make a very good argument as to how the war should be fought and how to resolve the conflict.
533;Sheen also gives an excellent performance as Willard, who is given the regretful task of killing such a brilliant, if not deranged man.
534;if you enjoy war movies, subjects about the turbulent '60's, and Vietnam, you will enjoy this remarkable, if not explosive masterpiece of violent art.
535;It will also make you think and realize that if you don't make friends out of horror and mortal terror, you will be in a serious and uncompromising situation.
536;Very informative interviews with Coppola and how they pieced it together were my favorite parts.
537;This is about the best your'e going to get.
538;video and sound was great reinforces my opinion as the best vietnam movie ever made hands down
539;So I really liked this movie, but it ask a lot of abstract questions that you have to be ready to think about if you really want to understand the movie.
540;Filmmakers felt they had the freedom to do whatever they wanted to then, and movies like this were the result.
541;Visually awesome and Still transfixing.
542;The actors are just spectacular.
543;It's extremely common for a director to release a new version of the film saying it was the intended version rather than the one everyone got to see.
544;So in he must go into enemy lines, meet some people and make it to his destination and finish his mission.
545;The fact that it looks remarkable as it is is either perfectionism, stubbornness, talent and vision or all of it.
546;looking back on the entire thing, it's funny that a lot of the classic memorable scenes are actually during the first hour.
547;with extreme prejudice line, it's all within that first hour of the film.
548;One of the all time epic films.
549;This is a magnificent film.
550;Hard to watch, but great.
551;The added footage to the classic Coppola movie make the movie unfold into a darker and stranger area than previously.
552;You will be aware that you are watching a significantly longer version than previously, but it is a good thing in this case.
553;this cut surpasses the previous the other movie, a feat I did not think was possible.
554;There are great interviews with the actors and filmakers, all looking back on the production with the benefit of hindsight.
555;And you get a great booklet with a number of memos from the set which are very interesting.
556;Not to mention it is a very good Blu Ray transfer.
557;This is one of my personal favorite movies of all time.
558;Apocalypse Now is the flawed masterpiece that broke Coppola.
559;Hallucinatory and mesmerizing, it's basically an analysis of the American involvement in the Vietnam War on LSD, if you will.
560;What the Redux does is restore about 1 hour of footage cut from the original 1979 release.
561;First off, I must say that I enjoy both versions of this movie very much (although I still prefer the original.
562;It has a interesting packaging design, but what it contains is a major dissapointment.
563;This is the lamest presentation of any movie I have ever seen.
564;1 star just cause the films are good (well and the fact I have to give it at least one) The Horror, The Horror.
565;Well, I've watched this movie for about 30 years now and it's still almost as interesting as when I first saw it.
566;It is definitely one of the most unique films ever made.
567;Sheen is fantastic in here, especially with his narration, which runs throughout.
568;the other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of memorable scenes, ones I have never forgotten.
569;I'm pretty sure everyone would share that opinion
570;Pick another movie to enjoy.
571;In this most sad of year's for movie going, the best film I saw was the re.
572;This is simply a masterpiece that must be experienced by all true movie lover's.
573;selve's to make film's with the power and in.
574;A classic thought provoking film.
575;the extra features about the movie were pretty educational and if you like this kind of film, its a must for any fan.
576;Great movie but I could not play it on my Oppo blu.
577;that being said, Coppola's commentary for the movies is actually quite good.
578;The Redux commentary is essentially the same but with new comments over the added footage.
579;in the film, Kurtz reads excerpts from T. s. Eliot's poem, The Hollow Men and this extra features Brando's reading of the entire poem with all kinds of unused footage.
580;A second featurette takes a look at the sound design work on the haunting helicopter sound at the beginning of the movie.
581;The original temp track featured songs by The Doors but it was too obvious and so a synthesized score was created with Coppola recruiting the top five artists in the world of this kind of music.
582;In conclusion, the final mix is explored.
583;PBR Street Gang features interviews with the actors who played the crew of the boat that takes Willard to Kurtz for the release of the Redux version.
584;All of the actors praise Coppola's knack for allowing them to feel comfortable enough to improvise and immerse themselves in their respective characters.
585;finally, there is The Color Palette of Apocalypse Now that examines the Technicolor process that gave the film its vivid look.
586;The theatrical version is perfect and excellently paced.
587;I really do not like this movie, but the teacher considers this to be a great work of art.
588;Coppola's masterpiece Apocalypse Now is cited as one of the finest pieces of movie.
589;The scene wherein a village is attacked by a fleet of helicopters is probably the greatest action sequence ever recorded on film.
590;With regard to performance's Martin Sheen gives a career best shot at the Marlow figure of the film Captain Willard.
591;Robert Duvall delievers one of the most memorable lines in film history with a confidence gained from his Godfather experiences I love the smell of Neapalm in the morning.
592;Equally memorable is Denis Hopper's crazed photo.
593;Good movie with new scenes.
594;worth a view, sit back and enjoy.
595;Now every Vietnamese person is the enemy, and families are being shot down.
596;The ironic purpose of the battle was so that the commanding officer and his buddies could surf the beach, and now the strong blast of the napalm has ruined the waves.Yes, this is a scene from Francis Ford Coppola's epic film, Apocalypse Now.
597;A movie based on the book Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad, which centers around Marlow, a sailor, and his journey up the Congo River to meet Kurtz, reputed to be an idealistic man of great abilities.
598;captain Willard travels in a patrol boat with four other soldiers: Chief, the navigator and commander of the boat, Clean, a seventeen year old rock and roller, Chef, a middle.
599;Each character represents the kinds of soldiers found in Vietnam.
600;He meets Kurtz's savage army and finally Kurtz himself.
601;In my eyes, Apocalypse is one the most amazing visual experiences in the world not only because of its groundbreaking perception of the Vietnam War but also because of its incredible cinematography that brings the movie to life.
602;Apocalypse Now is a movie that everyone must watch at least once in their lifetime to fully appreciate Francis Ford Coppola's work.
603;The acting is superb, mainly Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall.
604;Along the way, he meets up with the crew of the boat that is taking him upriver, and also meets a very interesting Robert Duvall, who is a military officer that orders some men to fight, and others to surf.
605;Apocalypse Now shows how horrible war really is, and gets to be rather intense.
606;It is the darkest war movie that I've seen, and I definitely recommend it if you like a well.
607;I will save you a synopsis of this film .
608;discussed French plantation sequence has been restored and included.
609;A movie this good deserves a full package of extras.
610;scenes story, and I would have loved to have seen this story represented in this disc.
611;I would definitely recommend to watch.
612;released, due to its malingering influence on an ever.
613;growing audience, covering two generations.
614;I am absolutely floored in disbelief!I wish I could convey to all the readers of this review the incredible memories and fantastic sights, sounds, and smells of the day.
615;day experience of working on such a bizarre film in an even more bizarre and remote part of the world.

617;winning actors (Brando and Duvall) on an academy award.
618;winning movie, my show biz career never really caught fire like so many of the other actors whose futures that film so greatly enhanced, especially Marty Sheen's.
619;If anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to answer them at liberty.
620;Amazon, has a hold on my money for 6 weeks.
621;I cant sell items until I can get paid.
622;Captain Willard's journey upriver into the heart of darkness to Terminate the command of the insane Colonel Kurtz is a cinematic legend, and with good reason.
623;I have to say that even though I had seen Apocalypse Now many times before, Redux hammered home a point I had never really considered: In addition to being just a visually gorgeous piece of work, it's also the BIGGEST film I've ever seen.
624;The scope and depth of the film are just amazing, especially considering that everything you're seeing on screen REALLY HAPPENED.
625;He actually had to stage all of those epic sequences right there in the jungle.
626;there are absolutely NO extras, and Apocalype Now is a film that cries out for better treatment.
627;The original film is a masterpiece.
628;I would recommend this movie ONLY to film students.
629;The original film was surreal, but, hey, to any G. i. in Vietnam, everyday reality was surreal.
630;It takes the best part of the whole Playboy idea and destroys it.
631;The original Apocalypse Now is a five.
632;star landmark in the history of film.
633;I received exactly what I wanted and expected.
634;The book about William Sprague was great because he is my uncle.
635;edited his original masterpiece, inserting 49 minutes of additional footage and, though interesting as history, it is debatable as to if the extra scenes actually add to the film in general.
636;sure, the bonus footage of Robert Duvall's surf and napalm.
637;lovin' Colonel Kilgore is a welcome addition, as are some additional scenes of interplay between the soldiers and a monologue by Brando's character, Colonel Kurtz.
638;Others (an additional encounter with Playboy bunnies, the legendary French plantation sequence) are much less welcome, not only softening the film's grip of terror, but making it seem about twice as long as the 202.
639;Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece of filmaking and no film like it will ever be made again.
640;I was completely blown away by this film even at that innocent age and it burned a lasting impression into me like napalm.
641;Not only is it the most Complete document of the film ever seen but is a fascinating look at how the film was narratively improvised and constructed during production and in the editing room and would make an extraodinary archival examination in tandem with Eleanor Coppola's amazing 1991 documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmaker's Apocalypse which is the most candid look into the making of a film ever documented.
642;Apocalypse Now is certainly one of my favorite movies of all time, and the redux is still a great movie, but the original cut is much, much better.
643;time legendary favorite movie characters into a dork.
644;It is brilliant filming that takes one quickly past his expectation of seeing a 'war movie' and into the psychedelic mind of Coppola.
645;i waited many years to see this film.
646;now, fresh from a much.
647;'The War', as many of us refer non.
648;adjectivally to the Vietnam conflict, serves that purpose well.
649;it it still arguable that America's involvement there made sense.
650;That, says Coppola with good lineage ancient and modern, is just one thing.
651;visually stunningthe human drama in waran exploration of the human conditionhearts of darkness is fascinatinggive it a crack!
652;Despite the redundancies of Redux this is still a great film.
653;This remains an important and rewarding film, but next time I think I'll watch the original cut.
654;Quite possibly the greatest film of all time, APOCALYPSE NOW was sniggered at in pre.
655;for all the trouble Coppola had bringing his masterpiece to the screen (documented in a fantastic documentary, HEARTS OF DARKNESS) including star Martin Sheen having a heart attack and the Marco's continually repossessing helicopters to fight Philipine rebels, the final product is an amazing amalgom of war film, psychological introspection, and updating of Heart Of Darkness.
656;This film works on every level.
657;This is the classic revelation about the disorder and underside of the Vietnam war, and is a must see for the veteran and / or new generation of students of the conflict.
658;One of the most well filmed movies I have ever seen in any category.
659;clock television news footage of combat
660;For me, APOCALYPSE NOW captures brilliantly the mood of the time of the Vietnam War.
661;It captures the feelings I used to get reading about Me.
662;It reminds me of W. d. Ehrhart's brilliant memoir VIETNAM.
663;And it truly is faithful to the spirit and structure of Conrad's river.
664;APOCALYPSE NOW preserves the spirit of that horror.
665;This is a good movie with some of Hollywoods best actors and is a good script.
666;I found it riviting and exhasting.
667;The clarity of the widescreen is breath taking.
668;IT is worth picking up just for the scenes with the young Robert Duvall.
669;I just simply love the movie.
670;Does a good job of trying to capture the madness that surrounded the Vietnam war.
671;Another movie to my worthy collection, the sound formats are well mixed.
672;Visually stunning cinematography and incredible direction from Coppola himself.
673;Apocalypse is still as powerful as ever but some of the added scenes break the frenetic rythm of the original.
674;some of the scenes help us to see Captian Willard as the auto.
675;i would have loved to give this one a 5 stars review.
676;I bought this from the U. k. because the version we had over here was in a word s**t, the packaging is a great extra in the form of a folder and the fact that it features both versions of the films plus commentaries from thw always informative Coppola plus some great extras.
677;throughly worth the money I shed out on it.
678;The added scenes help round out the story filling in important elements.
679;Martin Sheen is excellent
680;Add it to your collection and give the original to a friend.
681;this film is a masterpiece of filmwork.
682;the acting is superb, (we get to see a young lawrence fishbourne)
683;also this film does well to relate to the book upon which it is losely based, heart of darkness.
684;the intensity of both the book and the movie correlate well.
685;i recommend to those who have seen the movie to read the book by joseph conrad and compare the two Kurtz characters.
686;My wait for this was worth it!
687;One of the best films about Vietnam the way it was.
688;I would rate this edition among the top three.
689;I prefer peace much better, but I have to say knowing what I've known about the Vietnam period and the 60's.
690;This one had it all and a great story line to top it all off with.
691;any picture where an actor actually got sick devoted to his craft and continued to perform is well worth this film being the best.
692;clearly one of the top 5 movies in this world
693;I have the older version of this movie but this new version with extra is much better.
694;I love this movie, Martin Sheen is incredible n it.
695;I like both the original and the Redux version, the French plantation scene included.
696;And I have now watched the Redux version in whole and in part on many occasions.
697;if we do it this way, the dinner scene is quite good.
698;There is some great camera work at the table: the family staying together (all the empty chairs signifying fatalities), the accordion player living in the past of Dien Bien Phu and the French political chit chat.
699;Then of course there is the lady: strong drugs and string booze to bolster her up, and the strangely erotic bedroom scene.
700;If all this is looked on as an extra, as a second movie, it is good.
701;i also think Kilgore is also fleshed out nicely a little more, though this might be just increased familiarity with the movie.
702;The movie is great except that this version includes the scenes that didnt make it to the screen movie and there was a reason for that!
703;otherwise its still a great movie classic.
704;This is an excellent and darkly beautiful film.
705;Robert Duvall comes close to stealing the show with his blood.
706;guts character, Colonel Bill Kilgore, the Cavalry commander.
707;Sheen's internal narration, set against a haunting musical score, holds the film together and is beautifully delivered.
708;It is the definitive scene of the Conrad work, and might have been of this movie.
709;By depriving the film of the confrontation between Willard and Kurtz's widow, Coppola threw away Conrad's central vision of the conflict between savagery and civilization, truth and lies, moral courage and hypocrisy.
710;And you can imagine the effect it has.
711;so this is the plot: a quest to a forbidden land with fantastic adventures along the way providing us with a view of the war from a gunboat.
712;In one of the most memorable lines in all of filmdom, Duvall declares, I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
713;And yet there is always the mission, and so upstream Willard goes.
714;A photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) turned worshipful admirer of the Colonel gives you water, lights a cigarette and puts it in your mouth.
715;the head of the soldier who would call the strike is delivered to you on a banana leaf.
716;It is a great epic of mystery and beauty, a fantastic picture of the war, part brutal reality, part imagined enchantment with fascinating characters indelibly spun out by one of the greatest of all film makers.
717;By all means see this for Francis Ford Coppola, one of the few directors who could be considered a genius.
718;just an odd twist on a controversial era that has had a huge amount of films made about it.
719;I enjoyed the movie yet can't say I will be sitting on pins and needles wanting to see it again.
720;In fact, the movie is awe.
721;Watch it with a group of people and see if it does not arouse dissenting opinions among them.
722;The novel is a masterpiece of concise prose
723;those who share in Hollywood's professed hatred of war will probably find this film meaningful.
724;it takes you from the beginning to the end without breath.
725;See the Milgram experiment you will understand Apocalypse Now better.
726;other than that very enjoyable.
727;I enjoyed the original scenes and the new footage, but I was ready for the movie to be over before it finished.
728;point and finally saw the conclusion of the movie.
729;This is an excellent movie and the Redux in Blu.
730;The new scene with the Playboy Bunnies was, well, worth a second look, and there is no doubt that Cupolla erred when he cut the act with the French Plantation owner, it lent so much to the overall understanding of the time, however all in all when the credits roll I don't think you have gained much over the original.
731;good camera and framing work, however.
732;Thank you for requesting review.
733;even Francis Coppola is ambivalent about his masterpiece
734;And then came Redux, with an entirely new set of modifications.
735;i was surprised, frankly .
736;and when you so obviously funnel a story toward its ending from minute 1, there is an obligation to provide an ending with more definition, more imagery, more everything than Coppola has given us so far.
737;coppola calls Redux the definitive version, but let's hope not.
738;but for now, we must be happy with what we have .
739;and this packaged set allows us to do that better than we ever have before.
740;This is a great presentation of one of the greatest films to ever come out of Hollywood.
741;The set includes both versions of the film and an additional disk with special features all in a special package simulating a file dossier.
742;And I bought it on Amazon Used.
743;The story line was smooth and without the cut and paste of the theatre version.
744;This film is the best to come out of the Vietnam war.
745;I recommend it highly to anyone who served, or who wants to understand the futility of allowing politics dictate how a war should be fought.
746;This is probably one of the best war movies I've ever seen, for a lot of reasons, but what stands out in my mind most is the narration by Martin Sheen throughout the movie, and the Doors music which is used to compliment various scenes.
747;There was obviously a lot of thought put into how this movie was done.
748;You can watch this movie several times and still appreciate how much attention to detail was put into it.
749;Theres a lot going on in Apocalypse Now.
750;On a purely wow level theres the Valkyrie.
751;like helicopter attack, the terrifically scripted narration, great camera work, sound, production, acting etc etc.
752;It's flawed but this is outweighed by excellent multi.
753;The film is an account of the way this occurs.
754;Lance, the surfer, chef, Mr. clean, the kid from the Bronx and chief, the boat's skipper.
755;This last story is the back drop for the whole film.
756;The opening sequence is really the conclusion of the story, hence 'The End' song by the Doors.
757;As much as in the book the symbolism of the journey on a river to its source is brilliantly done on film.
758;As a journey into a persons self to discover truth in what appears like a bottomless pit, is well parralleled in pictures, as it is in words.
759;Both book and film are modern masterpieces.
760;Francis Ford Coppola had already solidified his place in movie history with The Godfather and its sequel, but here he put heart and soul into a film that has few peers.
761;This story set in Vietnam is most definitely surreal, and the climax will be discussed forever, much the same way people will forever discuss 2001 or, more recently, Being John Malkovich.
762;Watch it with friends and provide your own commentary.
763;It's the kind of film that invites such and makes it even more interesting.
764;Wow, it blows the mind, even today.
765;line, characters, and scenary is wild.
766;The thing is, if you liked the original, you'll like this.
767;The added scenes with the French colonialists alone make this version worth owning.
768;I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
769;He ended making a masterpiece and one of the best war films ever made.
770;This was his last truly great film that will make him be remembered forever.
771;Never again he had achieved the level of success that he had on the 70s with his four films (The Godfather, The Conversation, The Godfather part II and Apocalypse Now) but that's fine because this four films are among the finest of cinema history.
772;i have to say that this film is outstanding in every regard.
773;The locations are superb, the acting is amazing and the story is truly one of a kind.
774;Dialogue is profound, funny, thoughtful and simply really good.
775;Apocalypse Now is an exciting, often frightening ride that is require viewing for everyone.
776;A classic materpiece through and through.
777;apocalypse Now was released by Lionsgate with new transfers supervised by Coppola himself and the release is a spectacular one.
778;The definition, the clarity, the detail, the crispness are awesome.
779;Skin tones are really well defined and not at all artificial.
780;An excellent transfer that rivals the ones produced for the Godfather films (and those are also excellent).
781;The sound is really well distributed and all sound effects are really crisp.
782;bonus Features:Lionsgate released AN in two presentations: a two.
783;New to this release is an interview with John Milius and Coppola and a conversation between Martin Sheen and Coppola.
784;Filmed by Eleanor Coppola during the production of the film, this documentary is one of the finest ever produced.
785;This documentary should be seen by every film student and fans of the film everywhere.
786;this package also includes a nice collector's booklet with annotations by Coppola.
787;closing thoughts:Apocalypse Now is a classic film that is a must.
788;own and deserves a top spot in any film library.
789;With an outstanding restoration, 2 versions of the film and hours upon hours of bonus material including the excellent documentary Hearts of Darness, this set is one of the best Blu.
790;ray releases ever and is highly recommended for everyone.
791;It really would help to have commentary on this as the making of the film obviously is legendary and it would flesh out the Heart of Darkness documentary well.
792;Brando reading Time Magazine is also quite interesting.
793;So take it as an interesting exercise and enjoy it for what it is .
794;monumental filmmaking interspaced with a lot of problems.
795;Apocalypse Now is a movie that takes you on a journey through the human mind while taking you through a journey down a river.
796;The movie stars Brando, Sheen, Larry Fishbourne, Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall, and Dennis Hopper.
797;It's a movie that will change the way you think.
798;It is interesting to read the numerous positive reviews of Apocalypse Now, and certainly it will be to see reactions to this Review.
799;the best Vietnam War film ever.
800;If you evaluate the cinematic qualities of the film .
801;Other than that, and in terms of truth and realism, surrealistic about covers it.
802;This film is no better than a 1 on the scale of realism.
803;Redux is the definitive version and the Kindle Fire H. d. product is amazing
804;This is a genuine masterpiece of filmmaking.
805;Each scene in Apocalypse is like a surreal moving picture, a water color in motion.
806;In the end Stararo does to jungle settings in Apocalypse what Freddie Young did to sand dunes in Lawrence of Arabia, bring them to life in a beautiful and unexpected way.
807;This is a powerful and intense movie, that relentlessly shows the pain of war and the evil of man.
808;This is one of the most memorable and well thought.
809;It contained everything that a truly great movie needs, powerful acting(which was helped by Sheen and Brando, and all the members of the Street Gang pt boat), amazing camera shots and colors, humor, emotion, and a killer song to almost tell the story itself, The End.
810;But I'll also admit, I can readily appreciate when a war movie is great.
811;Some of the shots in this movie were epic in themselves.
812;I have seen a lot of movies and a lot of very good and great cinematic sequences .
813;This movie had scene after scene of just great imagery .
814;The greatest thing, to me, was how the further they got into the heart of the darkness, the more corrupt and 'disfunctioned' things became.
815;a great thing was, it wasn't overly grotesque .
816;It also made me think that these scenes are a great 'WTF is going on' moment.
817;Just running into these French 'settlers' in the middle of an Asian country / confrontation added to how top notch the movie is.
818;This movie is great, all around.
819;i have a very strict top 10 movies on my list .
820;Has anybody expected to see a high.
821;as well as being an important movie about the vietnam war, it gives the viewer a vivid look at the war and its consequences as well as its effects on people and their culture.
822;'Apocalypse Now' skillfully sidesteps both of these potential pitfalls to bring a war movie of true originality.
823;'Apocalypse Now' is infused with a black humour that adds an extra dimension.
824;martin Sheen's portrayal of Captain Willard is a compelling one.
825;His intense, brooding acting style is an exact match for the persona of the renegade Colonel Kurtz.
826;light scene inside his temple is possibly unsurpassed by any other in film in terms of intensity and impact.
827;I feel that most people who take the time to enjoy it will come to the same conclusion.
828;The movie is 5 Stars and the Redux version is worth seeing.
829;This is one of the few movies since The Abyss where where the extra movie footage adds to the movie.
830;Fantastic vision of the war zone and its depiction of who was the real enemy.
831;This is a great film but there is a general problem with the Blue Ray version of this film.
832;Of course this is a fantastic film.
833;Apocalypse means revelation, and in one of the internet dictionaries I found a beautiful definition to what happened to Colonel Kurtz: something revealed, especially a dramatic disclosure of something not previuosly known or realized.
834;I see Apocalyse Now as a shock of deep internal beliefs with reality.
835;This haunting, emotional and visual experience was a movie masterpiece.
836;Pretty good but took a while to get to it.
837;Made the good guys look incompetent a little too much I thought but some of the sequences were good and I took it at face value.
838;Apocalypse Now is such a huge film (original or Redux) that having a brief moment to go get a drink or perhaps use the restroom is a good thing.
839;The colors are bold and vibrant.
840;The sound is just as good.
841;the menus are easy to navigate, and the special features are very good.
842;Redux runs a bit long, but still an amazing must see movie.
843;Absolutely one of the best movies ever filmed.
844;Love the cast of actors in this movie and the action is awesome.
845;Good movie to watch and enjoy after a busy day
846;Originally it was going to be The Godfather, which is as special as it gets, but I just happened to finish this, and I guess one Coppola.
847;brando masterpiece is as good as the other.
848;It was, of course, in a theatre, and while I liked it, it didn't move me in a manner that I felt it should.
849;Just about everything is rich in vibrant colors that just pop my eyes out.
850;Even the scenes that should be dark, like the final ones where we finally see Marlon Brando, are beautifully done.
851;The most famous one is where he meets a colonel, played by Robert Duvall, who attacks a village mostly because the waves for surfing are to his liking.
852;We also see a sort.
853;The insanity builds with each encounter, and increases even more when he finally gets to his destination.
854;While some of the shorter scenes help flesh out characters, two major scenes take up most of the extra time.
855;however, once again, the visual clarity of the film, and the fact that it's a masterpiece make the whole thing worth seeing in this format.
856;Wow, what a great movie.
857;It holds value to it while at the same time taking on a at sometime comical mood, and at others a creepy mood.
858;A great movie overall, the scenery is GREAT!
859;The explosions are awsome and the footage is beautiful, trust me, you'll love this movie.
860;The sound track is amazing as well, with music by The Doors and Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead, and it can be edgy or ethereal.
861;Both the original cut and the Redux are great, but I like Redux a lot better.
862;We quote the movie on a regular basis as well.Young Martin Sheen is amazing.
863;Robert Duvall is iconic in his role as Colonel Kilgore.
864;rated for his 2 days on the set.
865;apocalypse Now Redux has a well.
866;deserved, significant place in our modern culture.
867;written descriptions and insight on it.
868;This movie is definitely worth owning and watching often.
869;The film itself is true art, an exploration of the thin line that seperates genius from the insane.
870;but is so well done that some may find it a bit of a letdown when another stunning action sequence doesn't materialize.
871;those are some the most emotionally intense moments I've ever seen put to film.
872;apocalypse Now is based loosley upon the Joseph Conrad novella, Heart of Darkness, which should encourage you to dig a bit deeper into the film to witness the awsome power and scope of the journey Captain Willard takes with his intrepid river boat companions.
873;I think it's safe to say that this is one powerful motion picture.
874;Whenever filmbuffs compile a list of the best films of the Vietnam era, Apocalypse Now usually ends up between the 1 and 5 placing.
875;Budget problems, cast becoming as insane as their characters, and Coppola, well, trying to cope with it all.
876;Still, for it's time of 1979, the film turned out to be an amazing visual as well as audio expierence (it's actually the first film to be premiered in the then new 5.1 audio sound).
877;Thus Apocalypse Now Redux was born.
878;The new scenes, most notably the encounter with the French family and their rubber plantation still standing tall within the war.
879;All the newly added footage blended perfectly with the original, and makes Redux worthy of any upgrade.
880;on to the Dossier release itself, it's mighty impressive.
881;After fifteen or so years of Hollywood cheating special effects with CGI, the once amazingly impressive scenes of the beach attack ending with the Napalm bombing, while still visually stunning, now seems commonplace in action film.
882;But younger generations should understand that that scene is actually happening, those are real helicopters in the air and those explosions are really burning, not something most of today's CGI.
883;era movie quite like it.
884;Though at times it reaches levels of almost black.
885;top photographer), it still remains as one of most pivotal cinematic points of the 1970's.
886;Much like another reviewer, I give Redux three stars because of the fact that Apocalypse Now is such a great movie.
887;The original moved at a great pace, hitting all the sweet spots on the way to Kurtz's compound.
888;I liked that Chef ached for the girls during USO.
889;The performances here are outstanding, if shocking at times, and the film gives a (once again) very dark glimpse into grim, ugly and gory realities of war and the descent into madness that often accompanies the realization that the war one is fighting for isn't just or just isn't making sense.
890;I'm loving the movie still haven't finished it yet but overall it's great.
891;But after a while it starts to blend in and flow.
892;Kind of like adding a couple new movements to a familiar symphony.
893;And even nightmares have oddly funny moments.
894;the plantation scene was nice because it explained where Clean's body went, along with giving the historical context of the colonialist line of march in SE Asia.
895;This was the last pleasant interlude of the dream.
896;stealing were comic relief, and both scenes were pretty much expendable.
897;by far the best addition was Brando's deadpan.
898;While the little kids posing and taunting the emaciated Willard added a perfectly macabre touch.
899;This is an important scene, one of the most important in the entire film and I don't know why it got cut from the original.
900;Of course, there are many scenes that stay with you long after you see them here and that is the mark of a classic.
901;all in all, this is a true masterpiece and a landmark achievement.
902;And this just may be the final, if not best.
903;The movie itself is great, but read the other reviews to find out more.
904;A good classic movie and good rendition of the Vietnam war.
905;this film is a masterpiece.
906;I myself liked the first one also, and think that maybe the extra scenes should've been in a disc as extra features.
907;the world reknown Godfather trilogy director, here brings us into a psychological battle of the vietnam war.
908;Both versions are excellent films, and it really is up to the viewer which is best, not which is good.
909;Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I apologize for not going into greater detail.
910;I can honestly say that I put Apocalypse Now at the top of my list of best movies of all time, and this Blu ray edition really does justice to it.
911;First off, having both the theatrical version (my preferred version) and the Redux version in one set is amazing.
912;Then, adding to that the extras like the making of documentary, you get quite a fantastic set here.
913;And then, add the amazing picture and sound you get from the blu.
914;ray conversion, and you have a perfect set.
915;I whole heartedly recommend this for anyone appreciates inspired film making!
916;And it has Martin Sheen, in Vietnam, and they play Wagner.
917;My ongoing fascination with the original Apocalypse Now was born many years ago and always held a very special place in my heart as a movie that so efficiently conveyed the inner darkness of man and the absurdity of how we often perceive what we 'think' is moral in extrenuous situations.
918;my final beef is what I feel is the dramatic change of the genre and story.
919;Got the delivery in good time.
920;It is a classic and probably would have ended up owning it anyway.
921;the case is espcially nice with the seal and everything, looks very original.
922;Francis Ford Coppola delivers one of the year's best commentaries in the double.
923;I wanted to make it as a great big Hollywood movie, Coppola says.
924;I wanted it to have the biggest picture .
925;The detailed and powerful 5.1 audio carpet.
926;paramount exposes itself to friendly fire with the set's title .
927;The set does deliver a robust selection of extra features, mostly new short films dealing with the production and postproduction.
928;The best is an indie.
929;Coppola has done it again.
930;Original is a must see for all.
931;If you thought Apocalypse Now was good, wait 'til you see the Copolla's longer cut.
932;This is one of the best movies of all time.
933;loving colonel (Robert Duvall), watch a USO show, and witness as well as take part in senseless killing.
934;This is one of Francis Ford Coppola's most famous films and it truly was a labor of love since it took a long time to complete.
935;Although their parts may seem minimal, Brando, Duvall, Dennis Hopper, and even Harrison Ford contribute.
936;Because I read the source novel, I could appreciate the film in that sense but The Godfather is a better film in my opinion.
937;I was surprised that the description described it as used but in great shape.
938;movie was well donegood cast,acting,directionsomewhat believablegood action sceneshighlighted the absurditiesof war at the timehighlighted domestic war protests
939;time favorite movie (2001 is number 1), but also the highly interesting documentary HEARTS OF DARKNESS by Francis Coppola's wife, countless extras, and a beautiful booklet.
940;Just as wonderful the 10th time as the first it is a classic I am sure that I will watch it many more times in my life
941;For me, a future Director's Cut will always be the better version because that is the version the director always wanted you to see but because of various reasons usually beyond their control at the time they had to settle which could range from budget to timing/length to censorship issues etc.
942;Having seen both versions I can safely say that Redux is the best because the Director has full leeway to tell the story he had always wanted to tell even if it means that this is now a more than 3 hour long movie which for me I didn't even feel the length because it was so good, so powerful and so absorbing and after Platoon is the best anti.
943;war movie ever made and is a masterpiece of film direction.
944;this film certainly rewards patient and repeated viewing and like any classic you pick up more from it and appreciate it even more every time you see it.
945;The casting is excellent with unforgettable performances by Sheen, Duval and even Brando and it's amazing that Sheen didn't even get an Oscar nomination.
946;While I can concede the Best Supporting Actor Oscar to Melvyn Douglas for his brilliant performance in Being There and Peter Sellers should have won the Best Actor award that year too I find it incredible that Apocalypse Now didn't win the Best Film and Best Director awards.
947;And my appreciation for just how well this movie was filmed and put together is dramatically enhanced
948;edited, but the characters made a bigger impression on me, the visuals made a bigger impression, and the story made a bigger impact on me.
949;But regardless, I think this is an amazing film.
950;Wow, what a fantastic film.
951;The symbolic journey up the river is like an escalator ride into the deepest levels of Willard's own tormented soul.
952;The history of the film is as fascinating as the characters who comprise the film (both on and off screen), as is also true of the subject matter .
953;while the director, Francis Ford Coppola, will be remembered for his involvement in many major films (such as American Grafitti, the Godfather series), this film will most likely be the most enduring not only of his works, but also of American war films.
954;this is a film full of stars in minor roles .
955;Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall (whose line 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning' is perhaps the quintessential quotable.
956;From the relentless trip up river to the blowing of the bridge and the air strikes, everything seems both real and unreal, as is often reported about actual combat from experienced soldiers.
957;The film was also nominated for best film, best supporting actor (Duvall), and director (among other categories), and won numerous awards around the world in other venues.
958;the inspiration from Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' is clear .
959;to watch this film is not to understand the war, but perhaps one will appreciate it better.
960;Apocalypse Now is an excellent film if you love military movies.
961;I'm a retired Air Force person that loves the Vietnam era, so if you love military movies you'll love this one.
962;The story line is great
963;All the sequences are interesting (and the scenes with the French Colonials most particularly so) but they do not change the tone or clarify the intent of the film.
964;Needless to say the film is about American pain with the indigenous population mostly featureless.
965;'Apocalypse Now' has been voted into the top 100 best films ever made presumably by people to whom thinking is no doubt an optional extra.
966;The Redux is good for the harsh reality of the situation.
967;One of the most extraordinary misjudgements of cinematic history was to award the 'Best Film' Oscar of 79/80, not to APOCALYPSE NOW, but to KRAMER VS. KRAMER.
968;As many have said, Apocalypse is not just one of the greatest war movies of all time, it is one of the greatest of all movies, and has stood the test of the past 23 years very well.
969;If nothing else, you can enjoy it as a marvellous druggy trip through fantastic cinematography and music.
970;i believe Coppola was absolutely right in releasing the 'short' version back in 1979.
971;working the whole movie 20 years on.
972;The film has even more grandeur than the original.
973;the love theme is truly dire.
974;Apocalypse Now is often hailed as a modern classic, and I thoroughly agree that some of the segments within it are brilliant, in particular, the Ride of the Valkyrie scene.
975;The cinematography in this film is some of the best you will ever see and it's no surprise that Apocalypse Now won the Best Cinematography Oscar.
976;It is this fact that makes me question the wisdom of inserting the extra 49 minutes of footage into the film.
977;Ladies and gentlemen sometimes a great movie needs nothing more than a re.
978;release movies after 20+ years like they sis with fantasia.
979;It seems to me that the directors have a death wish on there hands and want so destroy there greatest works!
980;Let the greats remain great and ACOCALYPSE NOW is best apreciated in it's origional form!
981;The Great movies of all time are great becuse of origionality and beauty they have origionaly.
982;It's chock full of memorable performances from Martin Sheen's Willard who becomes fascinated with his target and shares more in common with him than he'd like to admit, through to Brando's towering presence as the rarely seen, shadow enshrouded god of war who has tired of the hypocritical rules of engagement.
983;It has so many haunting, nightmarish images and the whole film is absolutely stunning to look at from beginning to end.
984;The first time I'm seen it since viewing the ill.
985;form approach but it is certainly the most creative and provocative war film ever made.
986;I love the way the original movie ended.
987;I have yet to find a copy that incorporates this original ending in the end of the film.
988;I wanted a collector's movie and I found it in it.
989;It satisfied fully my expectations.
990;This one is from long ago but it is still a great movie if you like movies about the nature of the human condition during a time of war and conflict.
991;I enjoyed this move back in the day when it first came out, ordered it to reflect of the ole days of Vietnam era.
992;In 1979, a more distinct and harrowing account of agony surfaced into the mainstream of American entertainment.
993;finally, it was touching to see the desperate longing for home which these soliders craved.
994;Nowhere in the film can this be best portrayed than the scene in which American showgirls were transported to the military base complemented by the rock and roll music of that time.
995;Perhaps Willard expressed the emotions best when he stated, .
996;One final note: the breathtaking cinematographic effects lended a realistic portrayal of the war and presented an irony.
997;Truly, Francis Ford Coppolla's exceptional masterpiece deserved the eight Academy nominations and the two the film won, for it exemplifies the inordinates of heaven and hell, and the dire consequences which occur when the fine line which divides the two is crossed.
998;The added 49 minutes of footage to Apocalypse Now helps to develope the characters more and give a better feeling to the movie.
999;this makes the crews descendance into insanity more remarkable later on and more pronounced.
1000;It also shows a more caring side to Willard and makes his character more real.
1001;in all, Apocalypse Now redux makes a movie which almost fits, work perfectly.
1002;Apocalypse Now is firmly and rightly established as one of the great masterpieces of the art of cinema, and of the war genre in particular.
1003;Nothing more can be said to add value to the copious and deserved praise it has received as a great piece of movie.
1004;making, and great acting by numerous players.
1005;This is as good as it gets .
1006;The set includes the original theatrical release and Redux, as well as Eleanor Coppola and Fax Bahr's excellent documentary about the making of the film, Hearts of Darkness.
1007;ray release is a treasure of an update.
1008;this release is a must for the collector and movie buff, and it will be a special treat for anyone coming to this film and its associated material for the first time.
1009;Francis hits it right on with the additional footage.
1010;line and characters are more developed and makes the original now seem like a rush up the river.
1011;I saw it when it came out and honestly watching it today brought much more meaning for it.
1012;star rating if only they would have included the superb documentary Hearts Of Darkness, which is as good as the film itself, really.
1013;I give this movie 10 stars.
1014;A classic movie about life in the Vietnam conflict on the river as a PBR patrolman.
1015;One of the best war flicks I've ever seen.
1016;Quit complaining, it's still a good movie.
1017;While Apocalypse Now is nto the greatest war movie, it is one of the greatest thought.
1018;chilling scenes unfold before your eyes and you sit and ponder as to what is the signigicance of waht you are seeing.
1019;This movie contains perhaps the greatest quote ever about the fate of the human race .
1020;Having seen this movie (in various versions) a number of times, it is one of, I believe, the top ten movies ever produced.
1021;Aside from Brando's performance (which speaks for itself), DuVall and Sheen were perfectly cast for their respective parts.
1022;If you've been born after 1990, do yourself a favor and watch this classic.
1023;Just watch it, beginning to end.
1024;It is beautiful, gritty, heart wrenching, and poignant.
1025;I still love the smell of napalm in the morning!
1026;As far as war movies go this ranks up there as one of the best.
1027;They billed Brando and Sheen but the biggest star was Robert Duvall!
1028;The acting was brilliant, Martin Sheen was amazing, The way this movie turns up river is truly incredible.
1029;this is one long movie, the cinematography is breath taking, there were so many great young actors whom I've seen grow since I saw this movie in college.
1030;the narrative was really amazing, all in all, not a bad experience.
1031;it was worth seeing again and for first time viewers there is some really beautiful cinematography.
1032;The added scenes were very cool.
1033;Highly recommend for those who loved this classic.
1034;Great war period drama/action thriller that was a huge sucess in the box office.
1035;Best lineup of hollywood star actors, award winning director and a huge winning movie worldwide.
1036;If you like films about the Vietnam War for the action and tension, you'll probably love the first half.
1037;it's essentially an examination of external and internal human conflicts: among peoples and within ourselves.
1038;'I was very curious about the extra footage, having heard about it in 'Hearts of Darkness'.
1039;And I at first found the French plantation episode, while ghostly and mysterious, definitely intrusive and unnecessary.
1040;The set up and conclusion of a dream sequence, perhaps?
1041;An imaginary Vietnam where Willard can find warm food, clean clothes, opium and sex?
1042;It's certainly better than his reality.
1043;but I'm very pleased with the restorationa and transfer.
1044;The entire work has given me more food for thought on one of the most complex American films.
1045;The entire film is a journey witnessed from first person played by the said soldier.
1046;Considering this was made in 1979, I must commend the director for such an epic visual journey, some scenes were deranged and completely out of proportion.
1047;Coppola's addition of footage fills out the story.
1048;The Director's cut is always better than what they had to release originally.
1049;Definitely one of the best Vietnam war movies out there.
1050;It is more about the psychological trama of the Vienam war which I liked.
1051;This is definitely not for the younger kids out there and it is pretty intense.
1052;It is one of those classic movies everyone has to see at least once.
1053;Just an overall great movie.
1054;Still, it's a great movie worth seeing on the wide screen, but don't expect cinemagraphic satori.
1055;They simply broke the lines with the real world and literally decided to navigate in the great madness universe and nothing else seems concern .
1056;duvall has never been best in any previous or next role like this one .
1057;And the life has in itself much more imagination than all of all us .
1058;the final dialogue with Kurtz in middle of a excellent shadow light game lights is made with the supreme perfection .
1059;wurtz supported for the horror existential made his own rules and in the middle of the jungle only the strong survives , so the law concerns more with the surviving concepts than any other law .
1060;Hopper as the photographer is superb too , but I have certain discrepancies with his character .
1061;coppola is perfect with this anthological and emblematic movie .
1062;He made the most powerful film about the poetic meaning of what Vietnam became .
1063;and I underline the adjective poetic , and not prose , due the fact the poetry and the myth are twins .
1064;please try to acquire the uncut version and you will make the entire round to this sublime masterpiece.
1065;Most of it I just found wierd.
1066;The acting and screenplay was absolutely superb but nonetheless I just did not connect with anyone in the film.
1067;hard that find this movie one of the greatest ever.
1068;inforce what you thought of the original film.
1069;'Apocalypse Now' is a polarising movie, and has its fair share of nay.
1070;So if you didn't like the original, I doubt an extra hour or so of new footage is going to convince you.
1071;But for those who regard the original as a slightly flawed masterpiece (like me), 'Redux' is fantastic.
1072;the added scenes also provide several important character moments.
1073;I was particularly pleased to see a greater focus on Kurtz as well, and the more detailed exploration of his ideas gives Marlon Brando's eccentric performance a context that it didn't necessarily have in the original.
1074;driven Director's Cuts and Definitive Versions, `Redux' is the real deal.
1075;New footage plus a subtle change in perspective makes this the definitive version of `Apocalypse Now'.
1076;While it probably won't do anything to convince the doubters, I strongly recommend newcomers and fans of the original seek this out.
1077;At $19.99 , this is a great bargain for a great film with a lot of nice extras but calling this edition which includes both the original theatrical cut and the inferior Redux is a complete misnomer.
1078;Simply put, I regard this picture as the greatest movie of all time.
1079;I have many favorites old and new, but this movie still is as hypnotic now in 2010 as it was in August 1979 when I saw it in the theaters.
1080;the original theatrical version remains the best way to see this picture for me.
1081;And including HEARTS OF DARKNESS in the 3.
1082;cave for a weekend and watch what a true genus can do with film.
1083;I respect his decision and feel the ending is better because of it.
1084;The original is one of the best movies about the Vietnam war.
1085;It captures bits and pieces of what it was like being in country.
1086;This is the kind of movie that is purely a dillusion on what happened in Vietnam.
1087;The original cut of this film is one of the most beautiful, and disturbing, pieces of cinema ever made.
1088;In fact, they take away from the film's power.
1089;How powerful that scene was in the original film.
1090;it continues with an argument about Lance surfing, with Duke and Sheen's character arguing about the safety of this (didn't they do this earlier?)
1091;(Unless, of course, you're after the thrill of some nice boobies.)
1092;I give it one star because of this.
1093;I'll stick with the 1979 cut, thanks .
1094;it's a far superior film.
1095;Sheen gives a stellar performance.
1096;War and the human psyche as masterfully filmed by Coppola.
1097;He did it to the classic Godfather and he does it again to Viet Nam.
1098;A Very good movie, well dispatched in time.
1099;This is my favorite film of all time.
1100;this conflict is wrought deeply in the character of the passionately insane Col. Walter Kurtz, written on the fly for and played with mind boggling intensity and stubbornness by Marlon Brando.
1101;one which any of us are fully capable of making, it must be remembered.
1102;in my favorite, of few I have ever liked, use of voice.
1103;He is already on the razor's edge himself, but still retains the sensibility of the Western observer, enough so that he can walk back and forth across the fuzzy line and bring us his reports, in our language, of what he sees over there on the other side.
1104;in my opinion, every frame and every moment of this film is perfect.
1105;The drama is balanced with humor, the terror with warmth, the sentimentality with horror.
1106;close details contrast beautifully with the big picture, the very big picture we are awash in.
1107;The film itself, as any great work of art will do, took control of itself and demanded that its mere human interpreters go where it required.
1108;The result speaks for itself, and luckily the principals all survived the process.
1109;It is a marvelous capstone to the young rebel Brando's waning career, and I don't know what else Sheen ever did, but this film alone is all he ever needed to do to earn and keep my respect.
1110;it of course makes a great, if rather long, double feature with the grunt's eye view of the war, Platoon, starring Marty's kid Charlie.
1111;I just watched Apocalypse Now and I'm aware that I'm not going to bring anything new or original to the analysis of the content so let me just get my impression out of the way and movie on: this is an amazing movie.
1112;There is value to knowing that what we're seeing exists in some fashion even if it's a model on a table at ILM.
1113;Apocalypse Now has so many shots that are crammed with detail.
1114;It's a much more uniquely magical feeling than anything constructed in the digital universe.
1115;The movie is gorgeously shot.
1116;The Redux edition has gone through a technicolor process that has created a deeply saturated look for the entire film.
1117;The imagery in the films opening act is crisp and bright.
1118;The movie is pitch perfect and though it's very long, the passaging of time was unnoticeable for me.
1119;The voyage into the dark hearts of men proceeds beautifully, until at about just over halfway through there's a new addition.
1120;Willard then gets high with one of the women who tells him he has two side: one that loves and one that hates.
1121;And that iceberg was France.
1122;What matters is it's one of the most well assembled, completely engrossing stories about the darker facets of man's inner natures and could have occurred at any point in history.
1123;Definitely one of my favorite films.
1124;but genius, as I have discovered over the years, is really in the eye of the beholder.
1125;out travesties are often trumped up as more than they seem via technical proficiency, big explosions, big.
1126;dollar names, and other such glitter.
1127;Vietnam (and in that, the darkness of the human soul) is seen, captured, exposed through Martin Sheen's murderously world.
1128;from a technical standpoint, Apocalypse Now is sheer brilliance.
1129;Acting, cinematography, editing, sound, use of color, dialogue, juxtaposition of the light and dark .
1130;all contribute to the overall build of tension, one that precisely mirrors Conrad's own literary achievement.
1131;redux, in all its harrowing glory, is incredible material, well worth the time invested.
1132;I wanted to get a better perspective on it now at 60 yrs, I am able to understand the movie.
1133;I think that the title of the movie fits the story Coppola is telling.
1134;dark perspective, what it can do to people Apocalypse Now is a success.
1135;To me the word apocalypse gives me a notion of something so big, so strong that it cannot be stopped.
1136;And now, it's been at least ten years since I last viewed it, the movie still captivated me.
1137;This is by far one of Coppola's best movies he has made over his directing carrer.
1138;Martin Sheen does an amazing preformance as a soilder with a very hard choice to make at the end of the movie.
1139;Brando's preformance was also amazing you could sense the pain within his words because of everything he went threw in the war and toll it took on the character he was acting as.
1140;But if you don't own this movie yet, though enjoy war movies this is one of the best war movies made so far in film history.
1141;Show me something that fills up my screen.
1142;ray is an ABSOLUTE must!
1143;In other words this man is so faithful to the mission he has received that his ethics are suspended, his intellectual positions are pushed aside.
1144;He works on a delegation of perspective.
1145;But the real lesson about human nature in war comes with Colonel Kurtz.
1146;All means are then made acceptable, even if not palatable, by the concrete effectiveness of them.
1147;As Jim Morrison sings at the beginning : All the children are insane .
1148;Amazing lossless audio, very active and strong, and almost perfect video: stable image even in fade.
1149;ins, intact grain, great color balance and no visible edge enhacement.
1150;Wonderful package and lots and lots of additional material.
1151;What's so wonderful is the fact that this film, like many others back in the day, makes you think.
1152;To me that's the whole point of viewing a movie.
1153;This film makes you question our sanity as a nation.
1154;this is great to see the rest of the movie.
1155;It is better in its 1979 format.
1156;I well understand Coppola's desire to tinker with his movie.
1157;Either way, Apocalpse Now remains a classic work, quite arguably the best Vietnam War movie ever made.
1158;But the cinematography was really good, though.
1159;Added scenes were amazing and added a lot to the story.
1160;One of the best war movies ever made, Apocalypse Now chronicles Lt. Willard's travels upriver through Vietnam and into Cambodia to assasinate a renegade Colonel.
1161;coppola's film is a master of the seemingly incongruous.
1162;In the middle of a bloody attack is a Lt. Colonel who loves surfing.
1163;Out of the darkness comes the brightly lit Du Long bridge.
1164;Amid the destruction and madness at the conclusion of the film is a poetry.
1165;quoting colonel and a grungy.
1166;even on the surface this is a very good film.
1167;Also, these are classic film characters.
1168;The setting of the movie is deceptive since it 's possible to not enjoy the genre of war movies and still love Apocalypse Now.
1169;What it's really about is the human mind.
1170;Coppola takes the viewer into a dreamlike state to evoke how the mind might cope with prolonged trauma.
1171;I enjoyed this film a lot.
1172;Great dialogue and a great story.
1173;I highly recommend this film.
1174;It is an experience to watch.
1175;It is a more vivid verson of Citizen Kane.
1176;This movie is simply amazing.
1177;A must for any movie buff
1178;I read somewhere that Coppola considered the French characters to be ghosts.
1179;If the film had concluded without Willard ever finding Kurtz, this movie would still have made its mark as one of the great movies about war and its effect on human nature.
1180;Seemed like a lot of artistic filler.
1181;It was kinda fun to see all of those old actors though.
1182;This film is the darker side to Francis Ford Coppola and it won him a armload of Oscars for this winning Masterpiece about the Vietnam war.
1183;The special effects were more than 'superb' for its time and still today.
1184;From the mentally scarring images to the Oscar worthy performances, Coppola does a superb job in making this, (even though he almost went insane to try to make everything perfect) and out of insanity comes Apocalypse Now.
1185;The cast includes: Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Harrison Ford, Lawrence Fishbourne, and Dennis Hopper.
1186;If you're addicted to war films like me, then you should love this.
1187;One of the best Vietnam war movies out and its almost 30 years old!
1188;His performance is that good.
1189;This is because there is so much passion behind this movie.
1190;This movie is more watchable and less violent than movies like Platoon and Saving Private Ryan.
1191;Apocalypse Now tells the story more comfortably, and yet it's still powerful and you get the same out of it.
1192;Thank you, Francis Ford Coppola, for this masterpiece.
1193;It truly is one of the best filmmaking docs ever.
1194;i am a huge fan of documentaries, and the fact that Hearts can only be had by finding a used VHS copy off of Ebay is just tragic.
1195;Movie is amazing, if you haven't seen it, go see it.
1196;I haven't had time to watch the Redux or heart of darkness yet, but I am sure they will be great.
1197;packaging is great, comes with a booklet.
1198;If you love Apocalypse now, this is the set to get.
1199;Obviously, this is a great movie.
1200;I loved and was blown away by the original.
1201;Still a great movie
1202;It's good on several levels: it's mysterious and tough.
1203;And, best of all, the bedroom scene is brilliantly, beautifully sexy.
1204;Unlike the other sex scenes, this one is great.
1205;it's true in almost every creative form: writing, photography, film, cooking, etc.
1206;What most people need more than anything else is a good editor.
1207;Cut out the dross so the gem can shine.
1208;It's true here as well.
1209;Apocalypse Now is a true triumph of film with unnerving, haunting performances from Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen.
1210;Coppola's direction is nothing short of breathtaking.
1211;The most memorable character, besides Col. Kurtz, is Kilgore played by Robert Duvall to sheer perfection.
1212;This is classic stuff and a masterpiece of the cinema.
1213;What I did was utilize the special features in between watching part 1 and part 2 of Apocalypse Now Redux and it made my viewing of the movie much more enjoyable.
1214;That was my favorite documentary from all the special features included which also included interviews with many of the actors including Lawrence Fishburne on his experience making Apocalypse Now.
1215;it was a great wast of time.
1216;All I can do is encourage you, if you haven't already, to SEE THIS MOVIE!
1217;The book upon which it was based, Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is also well worth a look if you have seen the film and would like further insight into the themes.
1218;then, by all means, see this cut.
1219;There's great expansion to all of the characters, particularly Lance and Willard.
1220;If while watching the original, you noticed a somewhat abrupt change in these two, you'll find the explanation in these added scenes.
1221;the movie is worthy of 10 stars!)
1222;Really enjoyed this movie, after hearing about it for years, finally gave it a viewing.
1223;Definitely a classic and worth the watch.
1224;The film's portrayal of war as madness often mirrored the problems involved in filming an epic about America's involvement in the Vietnam conflict.
1225;Apocalypse Now in any form is a must see picture.
1226;captain Willard has plenty of time to ponder the enigmatic Kurtz during the trip.
1227;It is Duvall's character that utters the immortal line I love the smell of napalm in the morning as he urges his men to surf the ocean waves in a combat zone.
1228;The final showdown between Kurtz and Willard is not only the most powerful sequence in the film
1229;My favorite line in the film?
1230;This masterful adaptation of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is an intriguing look into the mind confronted with madness.
1231;Willard tells us, the story is about his journey as well as about Marlon Brando's Col. Kurtz.
1232;the scenes Coppola gives us are unnerving.
1233;this is an intense film, and I highly recommend it.
1234;I loved it then and love it now.
1235;Best movie of its Era.
1236;I love the scene where the helicopters are coming off the water into the Vietnamese village, the beating of the chopper blades was so intense!!!
1237;Now, call me not avant garde enough to appreciate the subtle nuances of the Redux if you want to, but I feel that the extended version detracts, instead of adds, to this masterpiece.
1238;What made the character so chilling in the original cut was him impartiality to the crew of the boat and to his mission.
1239;This moment of levity actually makes him appear more human, not the machine that the original movie cast him as.
1240;I was completely happy being unaware of that part of the movie.
1241;The French exist but for our good graces today.
1242;Sorry to interject my political views.
1243;Redux is still better than No View.
1244;Francis Ford Coppola has proven his consistancy in producing films that keep the viewer on the edge of their seats.
1245;Coppola, although twisted, has one of the best imaginations and styles that has ever occupied the director's chair.
1246;This 1979 classic movie shows that Coppola's films are here to stay.
1247;He creates characters that are well developed.
1248;His imagination contributes to the vividly creative characters he has portrayed in his films.
1249;There are few movies that I believe exhibit sheer brilliance.
1250;Apocalypse Now is an absolutely brilliant movie about the travels of Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) who is given a classified assignment to track down a rogue Colonel, Col. Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando) in Cambodia.
1251;Throughout the journey to Cambodia, there are scenes that show the incongruous nature of the war.
1252;This film is my favorite movie.
1253;The edition is perfect if you want it get this version.
1254;The previous version was great had both cuts of the film and alot of special features.
1255;And both cut of the film with a fantastic digital transfer, perfect!
1256;It also includes the fantastic doccumentary heart of darkness witch tells you about the very bad things that happend on set.
1257;Marlon Brando is excellent as Col. Kurtz and I can't think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence.
1258;Sheen, as Willard, is fantastic in here also, especially his narration, which runs throughout.
1259;It's one of the best narrations, if not the best, I have ever heard in a movie.
1260;My favorite character in the movie has to be Robert Duvall's Lt. Colonel Kilgore who Hoorah!
1261;Before this film I never pictured Duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly it's my favorite of his parts to date.
1262;He simply nailed his character, which is one of the best in the entire film, as the gung.
1263;Maybe a little over the top but he portrayed that role very well.
1264;the plot is a fairly simple one and it doesn't take too much brainpower to figure out what's going on.
1265;But it's the journey of the film that is really its heart and also the dire situations of war itself.
1266;All three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the Vietnam War.
1267;In the end, `Apocalypse Now' (1979) is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status it's been given.
1268;It's is one of the most ambitious films ever made and a great ending for a golden decade of American cinema.
1269;Compare this with the original, which deserves more stars than are in the night sky, and you'll understand why there are editors.
1270;Extra scenes in Redux are interesting but not necessary to overall story.
1271;In other news the sountrack is fabulous including the doors to Wagner
1272;Terrific viewing on my large screen TV Theater room.
1273;I mean this movie was released in 1978 and the piture and sound is amazing.
1274;For example, The French Plantaton scene, Cleans funeral, and a 20 minute conversation between Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen.
1275;The cast is great and the acting is well done.
1276;A nice image to add to the cover might be the King of Hearts (the suicide king) with the red heart made black.
1277;I really enjoyed the Walter Murch interviews as I love the sound of this film.
1278;Of course, the story (original version) is a classic.
1279;The DTS audio is great until it drops.
1280;The Complete Dossier includes both the original and the 2001 Redux of one of the greatest films ever made.
1281;Apocalypse Now is a giant in every respect.
1282;This movie IS a moralistic movie.
1283;This movie IS a surrealistic movie.
1284;This is a period of time in which artist moved from drawing pictures which are truths .
1285;to pictures which they believe to be true.
1286;Had Cappola truly desired each and everyone one of you to interpret his movie and have each and everyone of you force their ideas on eachother , he would not have made it.
1287;cappola has created such a movie that you, the reviewers can each relate to it in your own fashion.
1288;a second tier of thought and intellect brings the reviewers to examine the movie at the moralistic point of view.
1289;the media is right there to film it.
1290;It seems as thought there is a fight between good and evil .
1291;He brings out from the white eyes compared to the black camo faces to the man with the gun as Cpt.
1292;This movie was made to evoke the imagination of the mind .
1293;I'm just lucky to have a great english teacher to help me figure that out.
1294;It's got Harrison Ford in the beginning of his carreer, an incredible cameo appearance by Dennis Hopper, amazing cinematography.
1295;Everyone who loves this film, also loves Hearts of Darkness.
1296;I know a couple of people who even like the doc better than the film itself.
1297;For us movie geeks it would be nice to have both aspect ratios on the same disc.
1298;still a great movie though.
1299;one years later, this is still such compelling and beautifully executed film.
1300;My friend really loves this movie it is his favorite of all movies.
1301;And he has seen it several times.
1302;first and foremost, if you haven't read Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, do yourself a favor and pick it up.
1303;In my opinion Coppola was astute enough to recognize that Heart of Darkness was well ahead of its time, and that, moreover, it proved an apt metaphor for the Vietnam conflict.
1304;secondly, Apocalypse Now is a powerful anti.
1305;war film, but it is also an intelligent one.
1306;Coppola clearly understands that a human being can hate what they are doing, but love what is being done to them at the same time.
1307;This is a subtle theme of the movie, but a very powerful one, if you are interested in exploring it further, I would highly recommend My War Gone By, I Miss It So by Loyd, and Dispatches by Herr.
1308;The film has been cleaned and scrubbed such that it is absolutely brilliant to watch.
1309;as for the added scenes, they were generally excellent.
1310;I particularly enjoyed the extra footage of Col. Kilgore, and especially an added scene with the Playboy Bunnies: I don't won't to give away the details, but it really paints a remarkable portrait of the dehumanizing nature of the war.
1311;It is the definitive study of this movie, and provides remarkable insight into the often painful creation of this film.
1312;ultimately, these are small complaints about a brilliant movie.
1313;It is a brilliant movie that I find myself drawn to repeatedly and that always leaves me thinking.
1314;If you are already familiar with the film, you must treat yourself to this definitive edition.
1315;i judge only the cinematic merits of this great film.
1316;One day, two uniformed men show up at his room
1317;he looks over Kurtz's dossier: top of his class, Korea, Airborne
1318;Chef, a machinist and saucier from New Orleans
1319;mate and 17 year old African American male from the South Bronx
1320;willard and his crew rendezvous with Bill Kilgore (Robert Duvall), a gung.
1321;He closes his eyes and swells his bare chest.
1322;I love the smell of napalm in the morning, he crows.
1323;As the patrol boat moves up the Nung River, Willard walks in Kurtz's shoes and sees what Kurtz saw.
1324;The animals on the boat become anxious.
1325;the men on the patrol boat receive their mail.
1326;Clean is sprawled at the back of the boat.
1327;as a film, Coppola's Apocalypse Now has the same flavor as Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.
1328;In one decade, he made three films that are among the best films ever made.
1329;Apocalypse Now is one of the great films of the last century.
1330;The transfer is quite good and the added scenes are interesting (but I see why they were left out of the original cut).
1331;Coppolla's epic is actually two films.
1332;is an absolutely unforgettable piece of moviemaking.
1333;Coppolla at his most brilliant.
1334;the Vietnam War being a perfect metaphor for the journey into the heart of darkness.
1335;And Kurtz is a more powerful Evil One in the original version, not much more than a shadow.
1336;So he integrated an extra 50 minutes into the movie, to make it more unusual.
1337;If anything, the extra scenes in Redux lighten the film's mood.
1338;Now, if you ask me, that's more unusual than a bunch of French people arguing politics at the dinner table!
1339;I think the Redux is fine, a five.
1340;It expands on the broader themes of Apocalypse Now, but at the same time lessens the impact of the movie itself.
1341;And that's the main difference between the two versions: the original is much more disturbing.
1342;But don't fret, the way this shift is portrayed is a beautiful thing to witness, as is the irony of their endeavor .
1343;I hope it wasn't really this bad, but I got to believe it could have been.
1344;Very plausible, that is the scary part.
1345;in EnglishSurrealistic war movies have their own demented beauty far beyond the cry of battle, as fully demonstrated in Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic masterpiece Apocalpyse Now.
1346;Once again we are dropped into the jungle, as with your best commando movies.
1347;Either way, it's an epic, mesmerizing acid.
1348;Grand spectacle, augmented by brilliant use of music.
1349;Acting is superb, from Sheen, Duvall and Hopper in particular.
1350;The picture is off course unique, the last 30 minutes of the movie is Marlon Brando, meaning he is the movie!
1351;This movie is so intense that you cannot leave your sit till it`s over.
1352;If you started, then you will finish it.
1353;Whereas Saving Private Ryan was gritty realism, Apocalypse Now is urbane surrealism.
1354;The whole movie has this elusive, mysterious narrative style to it.
1355;It's also kind of neat to watch this movie drift into this gung.
1356;You have to see this movie at least once in your lifetime!
1357;Whenever a director's cut edition of a movie is released, regardless of the scope or level of success the movie enjoyed originally, the first question that should automatically come to mind is If the 'extra footage' was so important, why was it slashed in the first place?
1358;Apocalypse Now as it was originally released was an absolute masterpiece of a movie.
1359;unsound (yet spectacularly and embarrassingly successful).
1360;the exception, I feel, is the French Plantation scene.
1361;This actually gives a sense of history that the casual filmviewer unfamiliar with the history of Vietnam may find interesting.
1362;I was impressed with it then, and I'm still impressed with this extraordinary movie.
1363;Both movies are noir satires, dark comedies, surrealistic treks, depicting a mad and crazy world, with laughs and jokes throughout .
1364;in between the blood, gore, and destruction.You know which movie won the Academy Award in 1979 for Best Movie of the year, and beat Apocalypse Now?
1365;You guessed it, that masterpiece of cinema Kramer vs. Kramer.
1366;Apocalypse Now is a cinematic masterpiece, a tour de force, just like Dr Strangelove IMO.
1367;Honestly, I prefer the original.
1368;Apocalypse Now is one of my favorite movies.
1369;LTC Kilgore, at the end of his scene, transformed into a mockery of himself, which the original cutting spared us.
1370;In the original, we saw enough of the bunnies.
1371;The French Plantation owners were perhaps the single additional scene worth consideration.
1372;It opened up a possibility for Willard, an opportunity for redemption, perhaps peace, after his mission.
1373;the point is, the original was near perfect, every moment driving us up the river.
1374;Redux, is important for aficionados, only to complete their understanding of Copolla's masterpiece, but in this particular case, I think he got the editing right the first time.
1375;I find it a great chore to sit through.
1376;Ultimate classic film, no doubt!
1377;You should watch this film, certainly.
1378;I have seen a countless number of times and I guarantee I will view several more.
1379;I liked it then and I still do.
1380;Helicopters whiz by, The Doors sound amazing.
1381;The wide screen image is clean and crisp with very little digital reminants.
1382;This proves that older titles can be updated for today's technology.
1383;this is a must for all movie fans.
1384;After a literature class where heart of Darkness was discussed this movie makes so much more sense.
1385;A movie ahead of it's time.
1386;This is an interesting film for its portrayal of the insanity of GIs in Vietnam in the late 60s.
1387;perhaps the best scenes in the film (and why I bothered to watch it) are the air cav scenes, where Robert Duvall delivers his famous napalm line, although the activities of the air cavalry are a bit far.
1388;Other excellent, and mostly realistic scenes, are when Sheen's boat takes shore fire and when his boat encounters a Viet sampan and inspects it.
1389;Both scenes accurately show the chaos and fear GIs experienced in Vietnam.
1390;it might be worth your time, especially the Duvall scenes.
1391;A classic film of its era.
1392;It is on every must see list as well it should be.
1393;the essence and artistic merit of APOCALYPSE NOW are embodied in its surrealism.
1394;They are best left on the cutting room floor.
1395;four of the very best combat films in my memory?
1396;But it is mesmerizing to watch.
1397;The acting was superb, and the Philippines are always a delight to see and visit.
1398;The music, the eery scenery and lighting added to the drama.
1399;I am happy thatMartin Sheen recovered and survived, and we got to see him as the President in the TV series.
1400;Definitely a war movie worth seeing again.
1401;anyone who has seen any of Francis Ford Coppola's films knows that they are almost always great.
1402;But, besides The Godfather Trilogy, this is most certainly Coppola's masterpiece.
1403;As he makes the journey to find Kurtz, Willard encountersa chopper pilot who loves to surf(Robert Duvall), among other things.
1404;the pacing of this film is perfect.
1405;all in all, this is the best movie about the Vietnam War ever.
1406;the sound is great and the visuals have been greatly improved.
1407;If you are truly a fan of great films stop reading about this one and go see it!
1408;Coppolla's Apocalypse Now Redux is a real gem.
1409;the basic story flows vividly yet mysteriously up the river into the dark jungle.
1410;edited the entire film from scratch.
1411;The film is set during the Vietnam War, but it is more about the dark side of human nature, and also how those in power often try to twist and distort the truth to fit meet their own ends.
1412;See the film and decide for yourself.
1413;It is interesting to watch the profound transformation that Capt. Willard (Sheen's character) undergoes.
1414;the panoramic shots are more spectacular (of course this was my first time seeing it on the big screen so I'm sure that makes a difference).
1415;some of the battle scenes are more realistic, allowing us to see the face of human suffering, not just the awe of exploding napalm bombs.
1416;the scenes at Kurtz's compound are more visually dazzling, and also a bit more shocking and graphic (some may feel this is gratuitous
1417;moral of the story:Evil is rooted in lies
1418;coppolla makes a cameo appearance as a wartime journalist in the filmApocalypse Now Redux is a cinematic masterpiece.
1419;well worth the journey upriver.
1420;I thought this film to be the finest work from Coppolla ever.
1421;From the very beginning with Sheen's husky intro and the Doors playing in with the napalm horizon to his whacked out dance and fantastic fan edit, to the very end, I loved this film.
1422;He certainly could be talking about his native country as well as his creation perfectly captures the glorious imperfections that is the United States.
1423;Like a true work of art, this film is unique and one of a kind.
1424;Coppola's film reaches the hallmark of many great works of art.
1425;this is much like the world's image of America as a country.
1426;All one has to do is look at the foreign press to realize we are viewed in such devisive terms.
1427;in that respect, the only other film that comes close to NOW is in fact, Kubrick's 2001.
1428;Whereas I find Kubrick's film to be distant and cold, Coppola's film is the opposite: immediate and captivating.
1429;although not a perfect film, APOCALYPSE NOW is a great film.
1430;It is the quintessential American Movie.
1431;Aside from slick packaging, and despite the Act 1/Act 2 split over 2 discs, I enjoyed the redux marker feature in this set (don't think it's on blu version).
1432;This allows viewer to watch Redux version that has pop.
1433;Apocalypse Now is a brilliant and riveting Vietnam War film that captures the American attitude towards The Vietnam War beautifully.
1434;The opening and credits are amazing.
1435;The second half is good but not equivalent and turns more to the journey of Martin Sheen and plot of the story.
1436;I was very happy to find that this edition also includes Apocalypse Redux and the extra disc contains a bunch of special features.
1437;It is truly a masterpiece and the movie has never looked and sounded better.
1438;a true classic,and one of the greatest films in history.
1439;there are excellent performances by Martin Sheen,Robert Duvall,but Brando in his 15 minutes is the best.
1440;river in the heart of Cambodia.
1441;winning cinematography and great performances this film is a hit.
1442;like when one of the playmate's is having sex with one of the crew men sha talks about the animals she has in the helicopter.
1443;star cast (Brando, Sheen, Duvall, Hopper, Fishburne, Ford) it is the wildest of war rides and is most definitely among the top 50 greatest films of all time.
1444;Wonderfull picture and sound at hand with director.
1445;but interesting to see what hit the floor from the original.
1446;Not much else can be said for this film, it is a masterpiece.
1447;One of my all time favorite films of all time for sure.
1448;Both films look and sound amazing on Blu ray.
1449;finally!While I certainly will enjoy having the player to watch many other great movies, I have spent over $1000 upgrading my system to include a top.
1450;This review is purely from a cinematic point of view, not a movie of the times review.
1451;i heard a lot of history behind this film, depicting it to be a fantastic portrayal of the Vietnam War.
1452;Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job capturing the atmosphere of war.
1453;The characters, the sets, the tone
1454;The choice of direction for the main character was great.
1455;Combined, all the factors capture an understanding of what Vietnam did to the soldiers on the ground.
1456;As for the cast, Dennis Hopper was an excellent choice for the drug addicted photojournalist.
1457;He was very surprised with his new copy.
1458;I loved the service as I was kept informed by shipping notices, and speedy delivery.
1459;Thanks once again for such positive service.
1460;ray Full Disclosure box set.
1461;apocalypse now is a great movie.
1462;It is probably the best Vietnam War movie ever made.
1463;Despite the original being filmed in the 1970s, the movie holds up incredibly well.
1464;I highly recommend watching it if you are a fan of the anti.
1465;There is a psychological aspect to the film, making it much more surreal than other Vietnam War flicks like Full Metal Jacket.
1466;this box set itself is good.
1467;I bought it for $20, and it is worth it.
1468;APOCALYPSE NOW is a brilliant movie, and it is brilliant on many levels.
1469;Sentences like: I love the smell of Napalm in the morning .
1470;are so memorable, and so metaphorically powerful, that they will remain with you for a lifetime.
1471;Based on Joseph Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS, APOCALYPSE NOW uses exceptional cinematography, music, plot, and acting to convey the ambience and ideas of Conrad's novel.
1472;technically, this movie is outstanding.
1473;bit color display, and every scene was perfect.
1474;Its music, by THE DOORS, fits precisely with this movie's goals.
1475;You succeeded Francis
1476;A mind that has broken in two and is now in shock with the world of men and has established himself as an enlightened being.
1477;now Coppola masterfully carries the audience deeper and deeper into the jungle as we venture into the heart of darkness.
1478;The film is a masterpiece, a must own for any film enthusiast as well as the casual movie goer.
1479;Coppola himself almost went mad during the filming of this movie, and it's easy to see why.
1480;The script is strongly influenced by Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness, probably my favorite piece of literature.
1481;Our main character journeys into the heart of darkness and through this journey comes rebirth and enlightenment as well as risk and sacrifice.
1482;the story is amazing, chilling, and haunting.
1483;The acting is some of the best captured on film, and the film's structure is flawless.
1484;I seriously mean that this a perfect film if there is such a thing.
1485;From the opening scene of the whooshing helicopter to the final words of Colonel Kurtz, the film is brilliant.
1486;Color is used strongly throughout the film to express changes in tone, and you as an audience member will be amazed by the stunning and beautiful cinematography.
1487;Apocalypse Now is part of our pop culture.
1488;Redux sees 49 additional footage added to the original, and the result is a more complete feeling to the overall picture.
1489;The picture is perfect, absolutely perfect.
1490;The transfers where enhanced to enrich the picture and the color and my god they are beautiful.
1491;aUDIO: As for sound, well, holy cow!
1492;The Dolby 5.1 mix is amazing!
1493;The disc is technically flawless.
1494;sPECIAL FEATURES: The set is also packed with a great wealth of bonus features.
1495;The commentary by Coppola is amazing to listen to.
1496;This disc is a must own for any up and coming filmmakers because these special features are specifically aimed towards film students and technical junkies.
1497;There is also a Redux marker that signals which scenes were added into the new cut of the film.
1498;Both movies are split across both discs, and so are the special features.
1499;The only thing people are complaining about is the absence of Hearts Of Darkness, which is an extensive 'making of' documentary considered to be the best 'making of' ever produced.
1500;some of the most powerful images in cinema are displayed in this film.
1501;or the helicopter attack on a Viet Cong village, which is stunning in its scope and ferocity.
1502;or the final haunting shot of the film, with the words the horror.
1503;the original APOCALYPSE is a masterpiece, and REDUX is just a interesting alternate version that is frequently boring and doesn't have the same impact as the original.
1504;I give Apocalypse Now only 4 stars because the original has commentary, while Redux includes additional footage.
1505;Needless to say, it was an astounding evening!
1506;Another memorable NYC evening, kinda like the New year's Eve rock performances at The Filmore East.
1507;priced and handsomely packaged edition.
1508;Every character in it is amazing.
1509;Just knowing what went on during the filming of this is enough to astonish, without even watching the film itself.
1510;Depending on your criteria for what makes a film great, you could argue with my assessment that this is one of the top films of the 1970s.
1511;What sets the film apart are the memorable scenes from the film .
1512;golden nuggets of cinematography, screenplay, and sound.
1513;And it is precisely those elements that stand out in one of the finest transfers for Blu.
1514;The helicopter scene with Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries blaring down on the locals, the Playboy Bunny sequence, and some of the final scenes inside Kurtz's compound are a few examples of scenes rich in detail, color, and contrast.
1515;ray one of the best ever, the audio will simply knock you out of your chairs.
1516;An upgrade worth the investment.
1517;Coppola's film commentary just in itself makes this 3 disc set well worth the cost.
1518;The original version remains my prefered favorite version especially in Blue Ray.
1519;This is by far one of the best movies about Viet Nam although it is no where near accurate, I don't think is was supposed to be.
1520;It is very entertaining and full of action and a lot of stars.
1521;classic CoppolaNo other Vietnam movie comes close
1522;I looked forward to this release so I could experience again the thrill I got from not only watching a great movie but also hearing the terrific score led by the inimitable vocals of Jim Morrison and the Doors.
1523;Give me back the thrill of the original: it was far more cogent and powerful
1524;But this brings the story into the realm of living memory.
1525;Though it's violent, it's never gratuitous, so I can recommend it to pacifists.
1526;dominated, it doesn't glorify masculinity, so I can recommend it to feminists.
1527;Though it's old, it remains timely, so I can recommend it to young adults.
1528;And though I love it, it's both profound and universal, so I can recommend it to you.
1529;Nominated for all the top Oscars, it won for sound and cinematography, the BAFTA award for best director and supporting actor (Duvall), and a Golden Globe for directing, supporting actor (Duvall) and score.
1530;the film is notable for several things .
1531;it was the first movie with 5.1 sound, it originally had no opening or closing credits, it has several unforgettable scenes, including a spectacular opening made only through sheer luck (a strip of trash film accidentally picked up and looked at by FFC) and the famous air.
1532;cavalry helicopter attack with the Ride of the Valkyries music blasting lead by Robert Duvall and his band of surfers, some top.
1533;rated quotes (I love the smell of napalm in the morning and It smells like.
1534;star cast including Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando, Harrison Ford, Laurence Fishburne, Fredrick Forrest and Dennis Hopper.
1535;it's big, it's impressive, and it's reasonably priced with lots of extras.
1536;I love the smell of napalm in the morning Robert Duvall at his best ever.
1537;But the real story is the bonus extras which are numerous and in.
1538;depth on a great range of topics that will be of interest to filmmakers, musicians, Apocalypse Now nerds, even ordinary civilian film fans.
1539;The film soundtrack is studied in detail, as is the post production in general.
1540;The greatest addition is Coppola's very informative audio commentaries (both versions) which are frank and heartfelt.
1541;i can't think of a movie I've enjoyed more in the last year .
1542;and I watch a LOT of movies.
1543;For me, this epic has grown on me over the years and gets better with repeated viewings
1544;with a heftier price tag, of course).
1545;the remixed Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is excellent.
1546;(It is an anamorphic picture.)
1547;I love the film and it's great cast, action scenes and music.
1548;I too am an avid fan of this realistic, engrossing film.
1549;The intensity, rawness, grittiness have all been removed.
1550;It's about spirit, energy, and emotion.
1551;still the film maintains a sort of gritty realism never captured in any other war movie.
1552;It all makes sense in the end if you paid good attention to the overall scope of the story.
1553;Just be sure you watch it more than once.
1554;that way this amazingly amazing movie could get its properness.
1555;prebirth human beings, not yet exposed to the horrors of the acid culture (definitely displayed in this movie) have seen this movie.
1556;i fully enjoyed this movie, mostly due to the fact that this is something to watch over and over again while twisted on weird chemicals , as Thompson would put it.
1557;This movie is a great classic at least that's what I was told by my teenage son.
1558;I enjoyed having the Collector's Edition with alternate endings, and scenes that were not in the original movie, which are only available with this special edition.
1559;This was a gift for my teenage son who was facinated by this movie when he saw it on TV.
1560;I finally was told that this movie was retired, imagine my surprise!
1561;I got this movie pack for a very reasonable price from a seller who shipped this item very fast and in great condition.
1562;My son would recommend the movie and I would recommend the seller of this item.
1563;Both were great in their own way!
1564;Everything is perfect with this item, one of the best war movies of all time.
1565;tale in hell!How can such a movie exist, that combines a cinema experience and shocking atmosphere this good, and still be a war movie?Its not malicious like Deer Hunter, our coarse like Platoon.
1566;The pure skill is mind.
1567;I saw this movie several years ago for the first time and didn't pay attention to it, but now that I've seen it when I am more mature and I realize this is genius!
1568;Francis Ford Coppola outdid himself with this masterful work of art.
1569;Marlon Brando was brilliant in the short amount of screen time he had.
1570;He identified the role so well that you can practically feel the same way he feels about what happens in his mission.
1571;what stands out is how Apocalypse Now is Francis Ford Coppola's labor of love.
1572;if you are a fan of cinema, and you own a Blu.
1573;I always loved Apocalypse Now but I believe the directors cut is superior.
1574;i remember seeing the documentary Hearts of Darkness and always wanting to see the sceens that were cut from in their entirety.
1575;Beautiful, breathtaking and brilliant, Apocalypse Now shattered any doubts we had about the insanity of Vietnam and continues to do so until this very day.
1576;Quite simply, one of the greatest war films of all time, comparable to Platoon and Saving Private Ryan.
1577;this modern day take of Joseph Conrad's brilliant book Heart of Darkness shows us Francis Ford Coppola's vision of hell.
1578;Where one man, who attacks a particular town for great surfing, is considered sane, while another, who kills a few people, is deemed insane.
1579;The film is terrifying, exciting, satiric and thought provoking all at once.
1580;It takes all sorts of elements of war (insanity, violence), plus absolutely beautiful imagery and throws it all into a pot until it seems so overloaded it will explode.
1581;The film centers on Willard and his thoughts and views on the whole mission.
1582;He is in a boat with four other men, although most of them are just kids.
1583;the acting in this movie is among the best ever, with Robert Duvall as Killgore being the best in the movie.
1584;In the greatest scene in the movie he attacks a Vietnamese village with helicopters and the main reason: the beach there has six.
1585;foot high peaks that go both ways
1586;The scenes as they go up the river are so creepily beautiful that you find yourself gasping in amazement and waiting in anticipation for what the river is going to reveal next.
1587;One of Francis's best, along with The Godfather 1 and 2 and The Conversation.
1588;All of the images are vibrant with colour and clarity.
1589;There is nothing I can say about this brilliant film that has not been said before.
1590;The scrpt and the cast were superb.
1591;Probably the two best films about that misunderstood painful part of America's history is Apocalypse and Full Metal Jacket.
1592;Good wars
1593;This is an extraordinary movie and somewhere, it should be required reading (observing) for classes in high school.
1594;the best thing about Apocalypse that jumps right there in your face, is that it is so disturbing.
1595;Apocalypse Now is a brilliant film, but the question here is whether Apocalypse Now Redux is an improvement on the original.
1596;A Director's Cut is usually validated by the studio's insistence on the original vision of the film being altered, and that is not the case with Francis Ford Coppola and Apocalypse Now.
1597;climactic, although I certainly appreciate it better today than I did the first time through.
1598;You can always better appreciate the film by seeing the road's not taken, especially since Apocalypse Now Redux proves that all of the cuts improved the film.
1599;Apocalypse Now is a powerful film, but not as great as the sales promotion would have it.
1600;reliance on lavish set craft visually detracts from the psychological and moral tension the screenplay presents.
1601;If you're capable of critical thought you see the elephantine irony right there: assassination deployed to create a sound military situation.
1602;In this light this film actually succeeds in asking the important question.
1603;I found Apocalypse Now excellent.
1604;It's behind the scenes about what really did go on sometimes in vietnam (setting up to kill commanders) The music in the background fits the time perfectly and Francis Ford Coppola is excellent.
1605;Apocalypse Now is one of my favorite war movies and is just as powerful now as it was at its release.
1606;an intelligent, well respected colonel who has tipped over into the edge of madness.
1607;The blast of napalm on the trees.
1608;I really love this movie can watch it over and over again Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando you cant get any better than that
1609;I love this movie, and thought I'd check out this version before I bought it for my collection.
1610;selection menu, which is nice.
1611;apocalypse Now is a great movie.
1612;This IS one of the best films every made (period).
1613;A testament to the art of film / filmmaking!
1614;I had never seen this movie before so seeing it was like going to a theater , i loved it !
1615;It is a film about everything.
1616;It is there it's greatness.
1617;This movie (along with Dark City) is one that people like to say is a masterpiece with complex,inspiring messages.
1618;ray and I was looking forward to giving it to him for Christmas!
1619;The blue ray was/is excellent.
1620;my husband loves it and I give it 5 stars.
1621;Francis Ford Coppola'a Apocalypse Now is one of the best war movies ive ever seen.
1622;the movie is an excellent voyage voyage into the minds of people in war.
1623;martin sheen as captain willard is simply brilliant.
1624;Marlon Brando is no great shakes .
1625;this is a martin sheen movie all the way and he carries it off tremendously aided by the brilliant cinematography and directorial style of the inimitable coppola, who knows how to shock the viewer with his terrific exploration of the shades of grey.
1626;apocalypse now is a masterpiece in showing the mental trauma of war.
1627;the chracters are tremendously believable and original.
1628;the other standout features in the movie are its chilling dialogs and the terrific soundtrack to the movie .
1629;coppola uses popular classic rock songs from the sixties to terrific effect, the songs highlight the scenes and add a tremendous aural backdrop to the visual scenes.
1630;its hard to discuss the movie without taking away its impact, suffice it to say that this is a movie that will stay with you for a long time.
1631;one of the greatest movies of alltime.
1632;Finally, this film gets the treatment it deserves.
1633;Whether you prefer the original theatrical version (without the French plantation sequence) or Apocalypse Now Redux, which included that sequence plus additional scenes, you'll really enjoy seeing them in high.
1634;The film transfers are just stunning .
1635;A. n. (Apocalypse Now) has to be one of the most wonderfully eccentric efforts among the great movies.
1636;A. n. is a magnificent, sprawling, dark, brooding, and intensely personal vision of a movie that people probably either love or hate, but whatever its ultimate fate, it stands as one of the great movies of its decade.
1637;Intense and horrific and yet, believable.
1638;Then the scene where the very sexy women are entertaining the male troops.
1639;Great actor Robert Duval's performance is the best acting in the whole film.
1640;astonishing film,great performances,the story of Nam,''the end''was or is like that.
1641;This film is extremely good, and is absoultely recommended for ANY war/drama film fan.
1642;Still, that doesn't and can't affect this grand masterpiece, and it is one of Francis Ford Coppola's best films.
1643;this film is a perfect example of demonstrating that war is madness.
1644;An outstanding film that is not to be missed.
1645;I have to admit that when I saw this movie in the theater years ago I didn't like it because I didn't understand it, but watching it this time I realize what an excellent movie it is.
1646;the Original has always been one of my all time favorite films.
1647;The true definition of a masterpiece.
1648;This is the best movie I've EVER seen (all 300 times).
1649;By reworking his original film, Francis Ford Coppola takes a good film with flaws and turns it into a major work of art.
1650;the river journey is now complete
1651;The Roach tells Willard he knows who is command, with a knowing smile of insanity.
1652;Kurtz is savage, powerful, and insane.
1653;this is a work of art, a masterpiece of cinema, and redemption of Francis Ford Coppola's career.
1654;Apocalypse Now Redux achieves the mythic resonance that Coppola and co. writer John Milius tried for in 1979.
1655;possibly the second greatest American film after Citizen Kane, now, in my humble, humble opinion.
1656;For the price that this pack is going for I think it represents really good value and entertainment.
1657;releases with extra footage are worthwhile.
1658;I enjoyed all the extra detail.
1659;i. e., the emotional tug.
1660;war between the real and surreal, which from what I've read is a pretty darn accurate portrayal of the historical event for many .
1661;A fun look back in time to us old guys who were there back in the day
1662;indoctrinated American public readily imagines is an accurate representation of the average soldier in Vietnam.
1663;Because leftist filmmakers and writers whose basic anti.
1664;up Somali look like a level.
1665;headed and competent soldier WOULD jump at the chance to vilify the American soldiers who fought competently and bravely in the Vietnam war.
1666;I've only seen the redux version so far but it's truly amazing.
1667;great use of surround and the conversion to blu ray is well done.
1668;released with additional footage, I looked forward till it came out.
1669;I can say that APOCALYPSE NOW is one of the greatest movies ever made, and with the additional footage that we now have, the movie is even better.
1670;The additional sceens with Robert Duvall makes his looney character even loonier and thats a good thing.
1671;The additional scenes on the boat were also good we got a better look into the charecters, something we missed in the original.
1672;If you think weirdness for its own sake is cool, by all means.
1673;If, on the other hand, you look for something redeeming, moving, uplifting, or meaningful in a movie (or a book or a play or a poem), then move along
1674;vietnam represents a complex era in American history.
1675;one thing is for sure: a hip, anti.
1676;very hard to follow but great actors in it
1677;Glad they redid the film Thank you
1678;It was clearly the right decision.
1679;the obvious companion piece to this is the documentary of the making of the film by Coppola's wife, Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse .
1680;It's a fascinating piece even if you haven't seen Apocalypse Now.
1681;there are a couple of goodies on the disc, including an alternate stand.
1682;It is a world unlike anything that we will ever experience in our lives.
1683;This is the portrait that is painted for us by Francis Ford Coppola in his 1979 masterpiece, Apocalypse Now.
1684;In Willard's narration at the beginning of the movie, he tells us I wanted a mission, and for my sins I got one.
1685;coppola's film also benefited heavily from the genius that he showed in selecting his music and sound.
1686;In fact, Apocalypse Now won an Academy Award for Best Sound and a Golden Globe for Best Original Score.
1687;This award was well deserved as Apocalypse Now used many aspects of cinematography and mise.
1688;scene in order to create so many wonderful and thoroughly memorable scenes.
1689;This scene was beautifully done as the camera was kept at water level to see Willard slowly rising, not unlike an alligator, to the surface in pursuit of his prey.
1690;i really loved this movie.
1691;Apacalypse Now was already a great movie, with 49 minutes of additional footage, how can you go wrong?
1692;I watched it again in class because our teacher thought watching the video would help the class understand the book, but for me it was the other way around .
1693;the book shed new light on the film.
1694;One of the central themes is that man exists with a black heart beating inside, and in the right (or rather horribly wrong) situation, it can be allowed to burst forth and unleash the hellish consequences of giving into our primal nature.
1695;The brilliant cinematography captures the Jungian essence of such a journey
1696;read the original masterpiece which inspired this film.
1697;Put both together, the book and the movie, and you will have one of the most unsettling, most terrifying, and most deeply profound experiences to be had in cinema.
1698;rating: 4 1/2 stars of five.
1699;The horror, the horror is one of the greatest scenes of animated films, ever.
1700;marlon Brando at his best.
1701;we once wathced it in AP Contemporary English class and compared it to Greek philosophy.
1702;The notable additions are the comical and sexy material that was deleted.
1703;i watched it last night and will watch it again.
1704;Apocalypse Now is by far better than platoon.
1705;Vietnam War has inspired many films, ranging from excellent to abominable.
1706;in my opinion there are three outstanding: Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979), Oliver Stone's Platoon (1986) and Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket (1987).
1707;nevertheless is a powerful and compelling movie.
1708;in my opinion, it reflects what the Nam world stands for in the American's collective imagination.
1709;images are overwhelming
1710;a film that exceeds its subject and entered a sort of all times Hall of Fame.
1711;coppola's two Godfather pictures come to mind.
1712;Add to the mix several mannered performances, heavy.
1713;Full Metal Jacket does a far superior job of capturing the horror and moral ambivalence of the Viet Nam soldier's experience.
1714;The original is better than the redux which I also like.
1715;It is nice to have both versions of the films in one place in such cool.
1716;The extras are good and worth at least one viewing.
1717;I enjoyed hearing how the version of The End used at the film's opening was something that the sound team discovered while going through the Door's archived recordings.
1718;This movie, based on Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness, begins with a specific mission.
1719;Along the way, the insanity of war is felt everywhere and is reflected in many of the characters
1720;Brand new and a great price.
1721;This is an amazing story that can still make my hair stand on end.
1722;The sequences with the French colonialists, the Playboy bunnies, and the stolen surf boards define these themes more clearly and the film's conclusion materializes much more clearly than in the originally released version of this great movie.
1723;It does not have extensive special features but the video and sound transfers are very good.
1724;The menus are clear and easy to navigate.
1725;This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
1726;THe acting and casting in this movie was spot on.
1727;This is one of the best movies of all time in my mind.
1728;This is simply one of the greatest movies ever made.
1729;If you have never experienced it, it is a must.
1730;Still even this cut is better than most films out there.
1731;Good to see out of interest sake, but will always watch the original release for satisfaction.
1732;Great movie in any case, one the best war movies every made.
1733;this is great from start to finish.
1734;Excellent service arrived ahead of schedule.
1735;It gets under your skin and you will refer to it whenever the subject of waging war arises.
1736;These are arguably the best performances by Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall.
1737;Truly one of the ten best of all time, and perhaps even better than The Godfather, and I don't say that lightly.
1738;Say what you will about this movie, the Vietnam war or war in general, this movie still ranks high in my book of American film.
1739;Each time I watched it I was a little older and I always picked up some new insight that helped my appreciation of what Coppola wanted the viewer to see and understand.
1740;This Redux version won't disappoint!
1741;I absulotly love this movie.
1742;This movie was required for my son's film appreciation class at UNCG.
1743;Quick service and the movie arrived in perfect condition.
1744;I love this movie and it looks great on Blu.
1745;Seeing Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, and Marlon Brando in a movie made over 30 years ago looking like they filmed it last year (it was that well re.
1746;mastered) was a truly mind.
1747;The movie itself is well done, but the content will make you sick.
1748;In my humble opinion APOCALYPSE NOW is one of the ten greatest films of all time, and the re.
1749;HEARTS OF DARKNESS: A FILMMAKER'S APOCALYPSE, Eleanor Coppola's brilliant documentary on the filming of APOCALYPSE NOW.3.
1750;This is a masterpiece
1751;Sheen is spectacular and despite all the hoopla Coppola refeived for this, it is was not enough and is still worthy decades later.
1752;If you have, take the time and watch again.
1753;add to your collection if your into classic cinema.
1754;The original release is one of my all time favorites, and perhaps the better film.
1755;This version is historically interesting.
1756;Loved it and will watch it many times in the future.
1757;The images are beuatiful and I like the expanded version even better.
1758;I like the french plantation scene as well.
1759;Having the doors song the end , which is one of my favorites, also adds to the mystical atmosphere of the film.
1760;this is filmmaking at it's best.
1761;This movie is one amazing feat.
1762;Aside from the insanity that was involved during the making of this film, the movie looks amazing.
1763;Each scene is memorable and filmed with such expertise.
1764;The extras are nice, but what is really great is the movie itself.
1765;One of the most powerful films ever made, it is also one that is a marvel to watch again and again.
1766;This is one of the best movies ever made.
1767;I'm one of the few Vietnam vets who actually liked Apocalypse Now.
1768;The added scenes increase the unreality of the movie without enhancing it's deeper qualities.
1769;and those of us who were there are bound to resent that.
1770;For example, in the original we see the villagers living a nice peaceful life right before Kilgore's battalion attacks.
1771;In the background, we see the North Vietnamese flag flying in the square.
1772;Using Heart of Darkness to portray the human impact of war was brilliant, even if the attempt failed in the original.
1773;This movie dramatizing why we should never get involved in long drawn out wars (Afghanistan) and provides some great lines like I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
1774;One of my fav movies!
1775;what a great price and deal for a great 3.
1776;Very happy and highly recommend!!
1777;Apocolypse Now is one of the greatest war movies of all time.
1778;It is realistic, and suspensful, and has a beleavable plot, and great special effects.
1779;in all its iterations, I can say that Apocalypse Now Redux is the most complete and satisfying version.
1780;Great to see Lawrence Fishburne in one of his early roles, as well as Sheen and Brando both at the top of their games as they fill their roles.
1781;There's also a quick glimpse of a young Harrison Ford, along with a great interlude with Robert Duvall as a Hell.
1782;please let me know when it will be.
1783;Apocalypse Now is, put simply, is a masterpiece.
1784;no better film has ever been made about the complexity of the human soul, and many of the moments in Apocalypse Now.
1785;the horror, have all become touchstone moviegoing and cultural items.
1786;one would think a masterpiece like that wouldn't need a touchup, but now comes Apocalpyse Now Redux, with over 45 minutes of new footage, a reworked (and very good) soundtrack, and a gorgeous new image transfer.
1787;For those of us who never got the opportunity to see this movie in a theater when it was first released, this new version is as technically good as it gets.
1788;In fact, the extra length and scenes in Redux make the film seem more ponderous and self.
1789;The sequence is interesting, and sometimes thought provoking.
1790;there is a lengthy discussion of the French Vietnam experience, some references to Willard's dual nature, and some stunning cinematography.
1791;And while this stuff is interesting, Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece, and when something's right, you usually don't improve it by fiddling around.
1792;Redux brings to mind Paul Thomas Anderson's comments about some of the scenes he deleted from Boogie Nights.
1793;those thoughts rang so true when I watched the new material in Redux.
1794;And for those of us who treasure this film, the extras are quite interesting.
1795;The documentary is brilliant, and it's a must.
1796;see for anyone who loves Apocalypse Now.
1797;It was good to see both versions of the film.
1798;Learned a lot just listening to Coppola's voice.
1799;What a great look back.
1800;Both from an early acting view and a historical perspective.
1801;The original Apocalypse Now was a phenomenal movie .
1802;Apocalypse Now is a very interesting ride.
1803;I think this is Martin Sheen's best role and performance that I have of him.
1804;The crewmates that he is with for most of the movie are all fun characters for the most part.
1805;The biggest action scene of the whole movie was near the beginning.
1806;i love the look of the film.
1807;The few action scenes there were I enjoyed.
1808;I also like the atmosphere throughout most the film.
1809;overall Apocalypse Now Redux is a good movie and, to be honest, one of my favorite war movies.
1810;this movie brings back alot of memories.
1811;not true for this movie, it was great when i was younger and just as great twenty some years later.
1812;Keep up the great selection.
1813;francis Ford Coppola,At the height of his creative genuis, and with films like The Conversation, Godfather 1 2 to his credit, he was considered to be one of the few directors/auteurs,one responsible for enriching American Cinema and lifting it to new artistic heights to this day2.
1814;he was paid millions to appear just for a short time at the end of the movie, and he is worth every single penny/cent and more.
1815;Forget his speech in the opening of Godfather, as great and classic as it is, the 'Horror' speech still gives me a chill down my spine, one of the most haunting speeches in cinema history.3.
1816;vietnamWith Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now is the best film that dealt with the Vietnam war, and how it slowly affected the hearts and minds of some of its soldiers, pushing them into the darkest recesses of the human soul.4.
1817;actorsMartin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest, Dennis Hopper, Larry Fishburn,all giving 100% and more for Coppola.6.
1818;the making of Apocalypse Now, appropriately named 'Heart Of Darkness' is the most interesting making of documentary ever filmed.
1819;Done by Coppola's wife Eleanor, it brilliantly manages to be personal yet detached and objective, and captures in intimate details the creative process and the difficulties that it encountered with the heart attack (Martin Sheen), near nervous breakdown (Coppola),and logistic problems (with Phillipines army).8.
1820;musicWith a combination of classical and original score, the music expresses and complements perfectly each scene.
1821;movie LibraryIf you are serious about starting a movie collection or enhancing your present one, then Apocalypse Now is what a 'movie collection' is meant for, a rich and rare film, the product of a time when directors and actors had personal visions great talent, and the free hand to translate it on screen and share it with cinema lovers worldwide.
1822;The extended version contains many changes in addition to the added scenes.
1823;The primary ones for me are the extended cut of the Playmates visit including one where the boat stops during a rainstorm and a few members of the crew get to visit.
1824;Capt. Willard hooks up with one of the daughters of the family patriarch.
1825;There are other scenes as well.
1826;Either version will make a lifelong impact if you love movies and for me, ranks with the best ever.
1827;will to be able to achieve beyond what normal people could do.
1828;the original portrayed that perfectly.
1829;Sheen even gets another chance to get laid here.
1830;It's much easier to appreciate this movie now that I can see what's going on in the shot.
1831;Documentary materials interesting and refreshingly honest, special features and behind the scenes were entertaining.
1832;Apocalypse Now has been a favorite of mine for years.
1833;I've loved both the original theatrical cut, as well as the redux version.
1834;I've also always wanted the companion documentary hearts of darkness.
1835;Some are new, including a great sit.
1836;They just casually chat about making the movie, and look back 30 years together.
1837;The commentary is great too (all 3 films have it).
1838;It is worth every penny.
1839;This is Conrad's allegory of life itself .
1840;coppola's direction is at peak form.
1841;It assaults you with one unforgettable moment after another.
1842;Apocalypse is the rare film that combines a deaply disturbing story with decent action and entertainment.
1843;Even before I read Conrad's Heart of Darkness, I was impressed with the dark themes this film explored.
1844;After reading the book, the movie went from great to fantastic.
1845;A must see for everyone!
1846;good tale of good and evil.
1847;A good reminder of what absolute power will do to mankind.
1848;an intense performance by Sheen gives us our path through this maze of a film.
1849;After more than 20 years since its theatrical release we can finally see Coppola's vision of Vietnam as it was meant to be seen.
1850;Regardless of what one thinks of that war, Coppola's vision will stand out as one of the most intense and thoughtprovoking exploarations into the spectacle of war ever produced.
1851;This movie should make you open your eyes in ways never imagined.
1852;Great dialogue and great actors makes this movie a must have!
1853;This film is just the greatest film I have ever seen in my life.
1854;By the year 1979, cinema had evolved much.
1855;The difference is this: one is for survival.
1856;The other is for fun.
1857;This was a gift to someone and they like it very much.
1858;This might be the greatest film since Citizen Kane.
1859;Perhaps the Brando segments are a bit too out there for many viewers, but when the whole film is taken as a meditation on several themes is fits perfectly.
1860;Every technical aspect of this film of the highest order.
1861;If there was ever a better photographed film I have yet to see it.
1862;The sound design is light years ahead of anything before it.
1863;The acting, often overlooked, contains one of the best uses of narration in film history.
1864;It was the original movie that so impressed me and still does.
1865;It's the original that I have in my collection.
1866;this is a must see film, and that is not saying that you will like it, or consider it worthy of the four stars I give it.
1867;It is a must see film so that you're aware of it.
1868;The picture and sound are about as close to perfection as you will get.
1869;If you've heard about what's in the it, there is genuinely no need to see it.
1870;Coppola is relying on the fact that Hearts of Darkness got good initial reviews and and has ever since remained relatively unseen and sought after (which means that most of us will only have second hand knowledge of it) and hence that we will not anticipate how much of a non.
1871;extended director's cut (which I prefer), and, perhaps best of all, the incredible documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse.
1872;the documentary is absolutely stunning, and to finally have it included alongside the film .
1873;Watching the movie essentially fall apart and then finally come together to win some of the most coveted awards in the industry is awe.
1874;October is on its way, and with it, a Blu.
1875;Trying to find something worth watching.
1876;I searched IMDB top 100 and Apocalypse Now was recommended.
1877;The photography and screenplay are magnificent, and clever use is made of colour and shadows.
1878;I will watch this classic movie many more times in the future!
1879;Visually, 'Apocalypse Now' is one of, if not the, most incredible films I have ever seen.
1880;Cinematically it is undoubtedly a masterpiece.
1881;The pacing of the movie is remarkable.
1882;Every character is fascinating and unsettling.
1883;Sheen and Brando are extraordinary in their disturbing roles, as is Robert Duvall as the lieutenant colonel who is at one with the war.
1884;as Willard sails up the river, each place is slightly more surreal and wild than the last.
1885;The final part of the movie is set apart in a mystical space.
1886;Coppola delivers a masterpiece of filmmaking.
1887;And knowing this about myself, I prefer this movie's original version.
1888;nam before we ever got there.
1889;Kinda fun scene, but again, not really doing anything for the movie.
1890;All other special features are good to excellent.
1891;I can tell you that I watched various films about the Vietnam War, Platoon, Full metal Jacket, and what I believe came closest to the way it wasWas, We were Soldiers.
1892;this is one of the most remarkable movies put to film.
1893;francis ford is one of the most ingenous film directors of all time.
1894;when producing the movie he felt that it would be the first movie to win the noble peace prize.
1895;it is a must for any film student.
1896;widescreen shows how this true art should be seen.
1897;this to me is the most inspirational noncomprmising picture ever highly recommended by an avid movie goer.
1898;This is one great movie, of those times and the US involvement in Vietnam.
1899;I see this film as a sort of Reunion of all those I served with.
1900;Only when a work of art leaves room for ambiguity enabling subjective interpretation, can it really be personalized and only if the creativity of the artist allows you to subtly imbibe his fecund thought, do you get to feel comfortable with it genuinely.
1901;If it happens to be a movie, you'd call it a memorable success if you get to identify with one aspect of it.
1902;The way Willard had given up on redemption and presented a realistic and disaffected notion toward duty, is philosophically a mile above any of the major protagonists I've ever seen in modern cinema.
1903;First time I watched this, the thing I liked the most was Robert Duvall's brilliant performance of surf.
1904;never happened, but the film got pretty interesting.
1905;the helicopter attack with the Wagner classical music is one of the most beautifully filmed scenes I've seen.
1906;if you want to experience 3 1/2 hours of some brilliant cinematography, great helicopter attacks, the amazing Marlon Brando with his face painted green and especially Robert Duvall giving cinema one of the coolest movie characters ever.
1907;cut with haunting imagery to the theme.
1908;tune of the The End by The Doors and is pretty much a prelude of what is come.
1909;Overall this is an excellent piece of cinema and must be seen in widescreen to enjoy the rich imagery and the full scope of the production and presentation.
1910;His character is very memorable and the fight scenes are shockingly realistic including a very real napalm strike on a huge forest.
1911;It is a huge performance from Brando that is both haunting and soul searching.
1912;There also is an outstanding performance by Denis Hopper, a photojournalist who is with the cult and babbles on about how God.
1913;the movie is loosely based on the book Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad and is an essential film for anyone's collection.
1914;I have enjoyed both versions and will stick with the REDUX version since this is what the film director, Francis Ford Coppola, wanted us to see.
1915;There is a lot of realism in the film that comes from a shoot that had tremendous problems along the way including sets that where swept away in floods and Martin Sheen having an heart attack in the process from all the work stress.
1916;If you can get your hands on the documentary making of this film Hearts of Darkness then do so because it is one of the best documentaries about filmmaking ever made.
1917;There is even a still photograph showing Coppola with a gun pointed to his own head.
1918;this is probably the best Vietnam war movie but it is a lot more than just that.
1919;A modern masterpiece of epic proportions.
1920;Marlon Brando fit his crazy part perfectly.
1921;5.1), you will see and hear the movie in a whole new way.
1922;This was always one of my favorite movies and this experience has taken it to a new level.
1923;When I went to see this version during its theatrical release, I was stoked about finally getting to see the great Apocalypse Now, a flick I've always loved, on the big screen (the original came out when I was only 5:.)
1924;They even taint the rest of the movie, completely disrupting the surreal, frightening flow of the original and transforming the movie's previously trance.
1925;in many cases, their imperfections are part of their greatness, but that's another discussion.)
1926;it seriously detracts from the experience.
1927;Go for the original, which Amazon is good enough to still have available.
1928;without a doubt, Coppola's Apocalyse Now is a brilliant movie.
1929;This is an epic Vietnam Movie starring robert duval and MarlinBrando a movie that all should watch very informal view of GIs in country!
1930;Realistic, drammatic, perfect in every aspect: this film, from the director Francis Ford Coppola, is a true section of the American conflict in Vietnam!
1931;So next I wanted to shop for some movies that have been important to me over the years, and Apocalypse Now was certainly one of those.
1932;friendly price, this was a no.
1933;So the set arrived a few weeks ago and I finally had time to digest most of this.
1934;Apocalypse Now: Full Disclosure (3 Blue.
1935;I went to see Redux in the theatre, and now for the first time saw it again.
1936;It simply confirms that the original 1979 version remains the superior one, at least for me.
1937;But it's nice to get the option to make that decision.
1938;That said, I don't know how many times I've seen Apocalypse Now over the years (I was 19 when it was released in 1979), and it still remains a towering achievement by Francis Ford Coppola.
1939;There are so many classic scenes in this movie!
1940;For me the 1 hour conversation between Coppola and Martin Sheen (from 2010) is the most enjoyable item in here, for the sheer entertainment value as both these guys are telling one great story after another.
1941;The conversation between Coppola and Milius is pretty good too.
1942;This set is a delight from start to finish, and very happy to have this.
1943;One of the best films on the Vietnam War.
1944;Charlie Sheen gave a great performance here along with of course, Marlon Brando.
1945;Other actors in this movie include Dennis Hopper, Lawrence Fishburne (see if you can spot him), Harrison Ford (see you if you can spot him too), and Robert Duval, remembered for his one.
1946;liner I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
1947;The scenes are simply spectacular
1948;The story is simply haunting.
1949;This is a great movie.
1950;A lot of the other Vietnam movies that followed it adapted a lot of the formulas done in this movie.
1951;What makes this disk special are the extras.
1952;Walter Murch on Sound Design, Francis Ford on the music and narration design, and the supervising editor Richard Marks on just what goes on in those dark rooms away from the set, are all invaluable insights into filmmaking by an inspired creative team.
1953;Apocalypse now is by far one of the greatest movies ever made.
1954;I have'nt seen the redux but the cut movie is good enough.
1955;the film opens with Sheen in Saigon having a deppresion[and an amazing heart attack scene in his hotel room], and waiting for his next mission.
1956;which follows is an amazing display of action scenes, some amazing performances by Sheen, Brando and once again, the notion that war really is hell.
1957;The insane colonel is played well by Brando, and his little hide.
1958;out is incredibly dark and spooky, a world turned completely upside down.
1959;This movie is one of the best told stories of Vietnam and one man'spersonal journey, as he signs on to take a special mission regardinga rogue officer who has taken on godlike persona in a remotecompound in Cambodia.
1960;At this point Coppola was still interested in directing epic, groundbreaking movies, and this may have been the last great movie in which Brando appeared.
1961;Martin Sheen did an excellent job too.
1962;Another appealing aspect of the story is the transformation of Joseph Conrad's classic novel, Heart of Darkness, into the modern, southeast Asian wartime setting.
1963;Dennis Hopper also has a cool part.
1964;Quite a bit more footage than the original cut.
1965;I could speculate, but I'd love to know what drugs were actually being smoked when this decision was reached.
1966;I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.
1967;this movie requires intelligence to piece together Coppola's masterpiece.
1968;even the way the Door's The End weaves throughout the movie deserves 5 stars.
1969;Very good movie a classic.
1970;Stands up to the test of time and is still good today.
1971;This movie has inscribed itself in the hearts and minds of a generation.
1972;From infamous phrases like napalm in the morning to the masterful incorporation of the stunning psychedelia of The End.
1973;The buildup of suspense during the 11 minute symphony by the Doors is truly incredible.
1974;One thousand words could not even approach the length required to describe the thrill, the horror, the joy, the madness of this work.
1975;Truly a lifetime acheivement, this is a gem that will be treasured for generations to come.
1976;depth and sourcing for a beach to do a perfect surfing literally, the fling with the Playboy bunnies literally, the boat.
1977;Again, this is something of what I consider a modern classic and it definitely withstands the test of time well.
1978;That was great, also the fact that Francis coppola gave a scene by scene analysis.
1979;This film is a brilliantly artistic adaptation of The Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad.
1980;Like others have said, read the book, watch the movie, and learn something.
1981;Also I highly recommend you see the film about making Apocalypse Now called Hearts Of Darkness.
1982;And it's an OK movie.
1983;It's done better in Catch.22, but this is an OK restatement of the same ideas.
1984;war statement, Apocalypse Now is quite possibly one of the best movies of all time.
1985;the movie's heart and soul is not in its plot though, but its intense characters.
1986;Kurtz is a genuine madman, whose blown mind allows him to both read poetry to himself aloud, and decapitate innocents to prove a point.
1987;graphic, Apocalypse Now is an essential movie for anyone to see.
1988;It is truly a message of what humans under specific circumstances are capable of, and the effect war has on the psyche.
1989;i firmly believe in preserving the director's original vision, and this is why I've chosen to review the Redux edition.
1990;This is the movie that started the outrage with cruelty to animals on movie sets such as when they were flying the cow out of the Vietnamese village.
1991;Martin Sheen, Brando and Duvall were excellent in this.
1992;It is refreshing to watch a good movie from the 70's.
1993;In putting together his director's cut of Apocalypse Now, director Francis Ford Coppola has created a masterpiece.
1994;It may even be the best war film of all time.
1995;Full of beautifully photographed scenes matched with precision by a great soundtrack (the opening scene alone is worth seeing the film), it's hard not to get caught up in the movie.
1996;This is just as much a quest film as a war film, and the additional scenes help this incredibly.
1997;but despite this, the film still manages to be incredibly powerful.
1998;It tops my list of favorite war films I've seen, and could very well be the best in history.
1999;I'd recommend the product any day and not only to any apocalypse now fan but also to any fan of coppola's work.
2000;it is an essential addition to my movie library.
2001;This is a blend of realism and surrealism.
2002;Francis Coppola renders stories with his signature vision.
2003;I hold our Veterans in the highest esteem there is and I thank them daily for keeping our country safe.
2004;A classic gem about the Vietnam era.
2005;Military industrial complex meets Heart of Darkness.
2006;This show shows how insane humanity can be.
2007;But the bigger message is what can be accomplished when one is completely committed to a cause without reservation.
2008;But it must have gotten lostBased on the Joseph Conrad novel 'The Heart Of Darkness', Apocalypse Now ranks as one of the greatest movies of all time, totally stamped on our pop.
2009;this is the 2nd time i have watched this movie and i have enjoyed it both times , will most likely watch it again in the future
2010;Well, it has been said that Apocaclypse Now is one of the all time greatest war movies ever made.
2011;It has also been said that it may be one of the greatest movies ever made.
2012;Well, I believe that to be true as well.
2013;edited and extended REDUX version, you can pretty much chalk that one up indeed one of the greatest movies ever made.
2014;It expands on character development and restores some scenes, such as the French Plantation scene and the Playboy Bunny medivac camp scene.
2015;Can someone please enlighten me on this one.
2016;Well, that's kind of funny.
2017;I thought Apocalypse Now was a must.
2018;see film and the words on the box made this version sound like it was an ever greater masterpiece than the original, so I gave it a try.
2019;This kind of movie is for the fans who like both David Lynch and Showgirls.
2020;This movie had a tremendous impact on me as a teenager and still gives me goose bumps every time I watch it.
2021;It looks great on Blu.
2022;It was worth the wait.
2023;great movie and great edition.
2024;powerful acting turns by the entire cast including Marlon Brando,Martin Sheen,Robert Duvall and Dennis Hopper.
2025;francis Coppola makes an absorbing and beautiful film that often crackles with intensity.
2026;a top five favorite of mine.
2027;a true journey to the heart of one man`s darkness and whatever awaits beyond the end of the glow of a dying candle`s flame.
2028;one of the best films of all time.
2029;I like that they have the extended movie and the regular movie.
2030;The added special features taught me a lot about the making of the movie and the music selections.
2031;After all these years it is a good movie to own.
2032;I could see how it had influenced many film makers to come.
2033;In particular I saw many scenes that Ridley Scott's Blade Runner kind of grabbed from this movie.
2034;The original cut always felt incomplete.
2035;The new footage has helped give the film breathing room which was much needed.
2036;At the same time, the new footage also helps strengthen some of the films themes.
2037;Coppola and editor Walter Murch created an entirely new cut of the film using the original negatives.
2038;The film has also been beautifully restored using Technicolor dye.
2039;transfer prints, giving the film the Technicolor look of movies from the 40's and 50's.
2040;The colors are vibrant, rich, lush and blacks and truly black.
2041;Apocalypse Now was always one of the most beautifully photographed films and this new transfer helps justify that.
2042;The remasterd sound is also spectacular.
2043;Murch has done an excellent job of putting the audience in the jungle.
2044;the first bit a new footage was an extension of the last scene with Robert Duvall's character, Lt. Kilgore.
2045;This is a nice little touch showing the cause and the effect of the US's actions
2046;This was another nice addition.
2047;The scene also helped reinforce the relationship Willard has with the men on the boat
2048;I thought it was great how Coppola showed how dirty sex had become.
2049;the last big addition I'll talk about is the infamous French Plantation scene.
2050;There's some great imagery in there, like the small shredded American flag which is used.
2051;By that time in the film, they are so far up the river that the Army's and American values have vanished
2052;The ending actually reflects this fairly well.
2053;Redux is an extraordinary film.
2054;This is my favorite Vietnam War film, though it is more of an anti.
2055;The characters and soundtrack are all likeable and eccentric, and some humor is thrown in at times.
2056;The director's cut adds a lot of previously.
2057;unseen footage, most of which adds to the film's side stories and character backgrounds.
2058;Overall a very powerful visual depiction of the chaos and confusion of war.
2059;This film is a wonderful representation of the US and their failed policies and procedures in Vietnam.
2060;This iis what made the film so realistic.
2061;More than a war movie , Its still a great movie experience most of the time with outstanding photography.
2062;It's well made and the photography and cinematography are first class though.
2063;The Redux version with its 49 minutes of additional material is valuable as a further meditation by Coppola and Murch on their original work.
2064;Both it and the original are great films, so there is no need to be picky.
2065;After viewing the original when it was released in 1979, I had been back from the war for twelve years.
2066;intellectual/showoff mind game by the producer.
2067;I was, however, in awe of Martin Sheen's role, as I was with his son, Charlie's, in Platoon, a much simpler tale.
2068;A heart felt movie with drama.
2069;lot of good actors in it, and very young Laurence fishbourne.
2070;i picked up the 2 disc version at Costco today and it loaded fine.
2071;The films look ridiculously good and finally in the theatrical aspect ratio of 2:35 which gives greater beauty to many scenes.
2072;I truly enjoyed the one hour John Milius chat with Coppola as well as the one with Sheen and other bonus features on disc 2.
2073;The opening scene is one of the best, it really set the tone for the rest of the movie.
2074;The movie is now over 3 hours long but worthy of every moment.
2075;One of the first major studio releases that I remember dealing with the Vietnam war.
2076;Martin Sheen's character lives it, he knows what it means to be unsound , he knows the wild mind of the Brando character.
2077;The additional minutes made the story a little more interesting.
2078;a must see movie if you have seen the regular one.
2079;another 1960's viet nam movie but the stars in the show made it special.
2080;It was great to see all these guyswhen they were young.
2081;I just watched the original version (NOT redux) last night and it looked great.
2082;This is pretty strong and thoughtprovoking stuff, stuff I'm able to appreciate more now since I'm 20 years older and hopefully more matured.
2083;it is this multilayered approach to the subject which make Apocalypse Now an alltime classic and which sets it aside from the others.
2084;happy Kilgore, all the way to Marlon Brando's jungle god, Colonel Kurtz.
2085;This movie is more than a collection of dramatic deaths, heroic triumphs, and inevitable victory.
2086;beside the visceral disgust and terror you will feel, the amazement at the sounds and color, or the rich characters in the movie, it will leave you with the most profound sense of disillusionment and terror possible from a movie.
2087;This is one of those rare and elusive movies that actually makes you re.
2088;evaluate how you look at the world.
2089;The best way to sum the film (as uneloquent as it is) is whoah.
2090;What makes Apocalypse Now so special?
2091;You finish the movie with the realization that you truly have no idea.
2092;definately one of the most brilliant films ever made.
2093;nine percent of the time, the director is right (anyone who's seen both the theatrical release and directors' cut versions of Profondo Rosso knows exactly what I'm getting at, and it's hard to argue with the superiority of directors'.
2094;The two climactic episodes in the film, those with Kilgore and Kurtz, are lengthened nicely
2095;used (as he seemed to be in the original cut
2096;this is a great movie.
2097;And it makes a good point about the insanity of war and the hypocrisy of claiming its murderous consequences can be subject to some code of fairness or that Kurtz is violating any rules.
2098;But the movie comes off as a simple.
2099;got the movie in good time , played it , looked and sounded very good . . . put it on the shelf with my other discs . . . these latter discs play as well as some blu.
2100;rays . . . thank you
2101;We still can visualise a lot of scenes.
2102;A must for anybody who loves the movies.
2103;Still, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and, for that reason, Apocalypse Now Redux gets my four stars.
2104;I saw the original version of this when it came out and remembered it vividly, but came away feeling ambivalent.
2105;The war sequence on entering Cambodia was amazingly evocative and absurdist, close to Michael Herr's brilliant impressionistic take on the Vietnam War.
2106;on the one hand, the story is good, far better in my opinion than the Conrad novella.
2107;great soldier that has gone AWOL and created an independent killing force somewhere in Cambodia.
2108;the solider's journey to Kurtz represents a kind of rebirth, finding his humanity as he absorbs the story of what happened to this man reputed to be a sincere humanitarian and true leader.
2109;It is on the journey that the film works best, with absolutely brilliant performances by first.
2110;There is Duvall's napalm lover, a super macho surfing enthusiast who loves to fight and never questions his road to victory.
2111;I found it completely believable and disorienting, truly original.
2112;I am very glad that I own this version and will watch it many times.
2113;Finally, the new music score was jarring for me, feeling unnaturally grafted onto a work that was finely tuned in the original.
2114;this is one of those auteur films from the last truly experimental era of Hollywood.
2115;recommended, in spite of its flaws.
2116;Both versions of the movie are great.
2117;The supporting cast is also strong, notably Robert Duvall(Lt. Colonel Kilgore) who received an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Frederic Forrest (Chef), Albert Hall(Chief), Samuel Bottoms(Lance), Laurence Fishburne (Clean), Dennis Hopper (photo.
2118;Vittorio Storaro's cinematography is stunning, earning him an Academy Award for it.
2119;In 1980 the film won an Oscar for Best Cinematography and Best Sound.
2120;As a result, the motion picture can now be seen as the epic masterpiece it is.
2121;Starting with pure aesthetics, the cinematography and sound are both absolutely stunning.
2122;The audio and visual segues are daring genius.
2123;The editing is taut and masterfully timed.
2124;Taking this movie completely out of any intellectual or literary context, it is simply a lush, indulgent, visceral tour.
2125;The opening sequence is worth the price of the movie all by itself.
2126;then there are the literary, intellectual, and philosophical aspects.
2127;Nominated for eight Academy Awards and unquestionably one of the truly great films, this masterpiece from director Francis Ford Coppola arrives in stunning high definition for the first time.
2128;ray) includes the original theatrical edition, the Redux edition (Coppola's longer cut) and the startling documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse by Coppola's wife Eleanor.
2129;This unflinching look at the chaotic, calamitous circumstances of the Apocalypse shoot is probably the best making.
2130;additional features include a 48.
2131;In my opinion, one of the greatest films ever.
2132;A truely enthralling look at a war that was never completely understood.
2133;A game with intangable costs
2134;Apocalypse Now is a cinematic masterpiece.
2135;The characters in the movie are unforgettable and flawlessly portrayed by an unparalleled cast.
2136;I remember when I was with Special Forces.
2137;And I want to remember it.
2138;Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure.
2139;print for the last decade), The Complete Dossier is a great value for the price.
2140;Coppola's commentary is entertaining and filled with little insights you won't hear elsewhere.
2141;I enjoyed the additional scenes but I did not like the revised ending.
2142;Apocalypse Now Redux is proof of how skillfully the footage was edited to produce the (in my opinion) better original theatrical version.
2143;ray it was all that I had expected a very good investment
2144;I gave Apocalypse Now 3 stars based on Robert Duval's wonderful performance, alone.
2145;He captures the wild and reckless nature of certain officers in Vietnam, perfectly.
2146;The war is a beach party in La Jolla.
2147;'I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
2148;Skull Rack and Hummingbird God.
2149;It's a very good war movie with a out of control commanding officer.
2150;One of the best movies I've seen about Vietnam with a differant view.
2151;us, the jungle scenes and the bombing secuences are my favorites.
2152;to see Marlon Brando and hear his lines makes you think may be this man is not crazy, may be he is the product of his perfect militar career.
2153;It is a story of one man's journey into the heart of darkness (however you may interpret that) and it just happens to be set in Cambodia.
2154;Whether or not it makes any sense (I have yet to figure it out), it's still a beautiful picture.
2155;I can honestly say it's one of the few films that I've enjoyed simply for the visual/sonic aspects.
2156;very goring to the soul.
2157;If a film can be elevated to such levels of greatness as the renowned operas of past, this one can do it.
2158;the most ominous poisonous effect of war is best exemplified by Martin Sheen's beginning narrative.
2159;the drugs are there, the razor thin nerves and eventual tragic mistakes are there, all with masterful strokes of smoke, light and music produced by a crack team of analog effects specialists.
2160;Still great after all these years.
2161;First off, yes the original is probably my favorite movie.
2162;i thought the original was a long movie.
2163;but now that i've seen redux i have a profound respect for the editor of the original.
2164;and probably the most anticipated new scene is one with Brando.
2165;but a far cry from the amazing performance in the original.
2166;It does a nice job of showing how his moods change is all.
2167;But the thing is, it does show Brando's entire body.
2168;In the original he was just about the only character that was well established: you knew exacly who he was and what he wanted to do.
2169;out the superflous scenes to make the movie flow better.Yes the Redux has it's values to afficianadios,and fans but this is a much better punchy version IMHO.
2170;bTW I have seen the 3.5 hr workprint version and it is a masterpiece but only for real movie buffs who enjoy unused scenes &the pure genious of the camera work, set design, music score and unused characters like Scot Glen (who shot himself ??)
2171;Even Brando's pudgy USA soundstage poetic ramblings are pure magic.
2172;Redux is what the film was originally intended to be, but like many great films that go into theaters, they have to be cut for the masses to enjoy it.
2173;And as always, your opinion on which version is better is more important than mine or Francis's.
2174;Much of it is on the film's sound, including the music.
2175;but besides that, this Dossier is a must for any Apocalypse Now fans.
2176;It's got it all in 2 discs.
2177;(You do have to change discs for both versions, but this provides a much.
2178;This may not be the Complete collection but it is an incredible movie that I can't discourage you to have.
2179;For those looking to see as much of Apocalypse Now that you can, definitely pick this up.
2180;It's worth the price of Coppola's commentary alone.
2181;the two disc set includes Coppola's commentary, a video introduction, plenty of deleted scenes, and a few other featurettes that are tottally worth it.
2182;Being that Apolcalypse Now is probably my favorite movie of all time, I already own both the original version and the Redux.
2183;I bought this as a gift.
2184;Not only is it nice to have both versions in one package, but the bonus features are cool as well.
2185;I checked out this classic film for the very first time and I was totally mesmerized with the dark character study of a war film.
2186;notch, the story very moving, and the settings of the film very wonderful.
2187;Apocalypse Now is one of those films where it will stay with you for a very long time after the ending of the film.
2188;I think this movie is a masterpiece of cinematography.
2189;The movie does a faithful job explaining the journey of one man into the heart of darkness.
2190;If you understand the philosophy of the original movie you will definitely appreciate this movie, otherwise you might just think this makes an already long movie drag out even more.
2191;The additional footage of the French plantation is a priceless additional as it truly conveys the ultimate futility of war as cryptically shares with us certain facts of the Vietnam War not readily known by the public and easily misunderstood as conjecture by historians.
2192;It gives us a unique perspective into the French story as they were occupiers of this selfsame land before we were and were driven out with equal determination.
2193;All in all a masterpiece of a psychological thriller whose true horror is heard again when one reflects eerily of the situation in Iraq today, for mans causes and ideologies may vary, but the motives always seem to stay the same.
2194;however, I found the added Playboy scene worthy.
2195;Coppola makes great movies and great wine to boot!
2196;This was very good Redux.
2197;Interesting view on war and the high ranking officials.
2198;The expanded version is still good but the original is a masterpiece.
2199;The original is one of the best movies ever made, if it ain't broke don't fix it!
2200;i originally was going to return it but it was so neat i kept it.
2201;Once a masterpiece of film, every frame worthy of a spot in the Louvre, is now just another.
2202;The is the best pick for all Apocalypse Now fans, whether they be new ones, old ones, or are simply rediscovering this classic historical fictional account of the Vietnam War.
2203;This scene is so good that I must have watched it a dozen times.
2204;It is indeed a long film, but every minute is well done and fascinating.
2205;I love the smell of napalm in the morning: that gasoline smell.
2206;There are two of you: one that loves, and one that kills.
2207;Always thought provoking and interesting.
2208;This movie was recommended by a friend.
2209;From the very begining, it grabbed my attention and continued throughout the movie.
2210;I would recommend to adult friends.
2211;Marlon Brando is one of my favorite actors.
2212;I would recommend this to anyone who saw the theater version.
2213;There's also a work print version flying around, and Francis Ford Coppola even said it himself that the raw, raw footage went for over 5 hours long and added.
2214;i got this for $9, but I never thought WHY it was marked.
2215;functioning velcro to help keep the contents inside.
2216;The disc came fast, and is in perfect condition!
2217;one word another word yet another word and more words just to say that Apocalyse Now is a great film.
2218;More words more words and yet more words.
2219;Just an amazing treatment of a classic story by screenwriter John Millius and director Francis Ford Coppola.
2220;The middle, while important and still good, does not live up to the standards set by the other scenes (unless you count the French Plantation Scenes in Redux ).
2221;It is nice to see that some studios understand that when they re.
2222;There was a good reason that Coppola cut scenes like the French Plantation in the original film.
2223;The movie starts well and gets the viewer interested and then brings your hopes to rock bottom.
2224;A film that takes some persistence and stamina to sit through with Coppola's masterpiece lengthened, unnecessarily in my opinion, to make the point of what was happening with America during the Vietnam conflict.
2225;cinematography is excellent, best I've ever seen.
2226;The lighting, mood, music, fog, all to excellent control and results.
2227;Hearts of Darkness: a Filmmaker's Apocalypse is brilliant.
2228;Watching the production slumber into 200 or so days of principal photography gives you more appreciation for what Francis Ford Coppola had to go through.
2229;i love the idea of a two.
2230;there is nothing better than watching back to back Hearts of Darkness/Apocalypse Now double feature.
2231;It is just so great order this product right now.
2232;I had never seen the movie so my wife took me to it because it is an important film.
2233;edit with 49 minutes of additional footage, Apocalypse Now Redux (2001) is a mesmerizing journey through the chaos of the Vietnam War .
2234;Coppola's passion and financial gamble is a rarity in today's cinema.
2235;Apocalypse Now Redux remains a textbook example of accomplished filmmaking with its innovative sound, location cinematography and stream.
2236;Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper deliver classic portrayals.
2237;A masterpiece of sight and sound.
2238;I have always enjoyed this movie.
2239;then came the VCR, and I promptly added this movie to my collection, because over the years, I had come to appreciate the finer points of the movie, rather than just the obvious stuff.
2240;Hard to believe, but true.
2241;if you own the original, look into this.
2242;It's almost a perfect movie.
2243;That said, you have to be in the right mind set to really appreciate this movie.
2244;Apocalypse Now is one of the great films of American cinema.
2245;The picture is simply gorgeous and the remastered 5.1 Dolby Digital sound makes the battles more realistic and the jungle more eerie.
2246;add a richness to the film.
2247;This is a great movie.
2248;Today it is still one of the best War Movies around and a must own for any Guy Movie collection.
2249;The opening sequences are stunningly atmospheric .
2250;over narration is another successful ingredient of the film.
2251;MARLON BRANDO is superb as Colonel Kurtz.
2252;Robert Duvall gives one of the BEST PERFORMANCES of his career.
2253;Apocalypse Now is one the greatest movies ever.
2254;The movie is an epic in its storytelling and cinematography and captures the surreal nature of war.
2255;What was once a perfect film in every aspect has been butchered by it's own makers.
2256;Hearts of Darkness is a must see for any lover of film.
2257;The packaging design is beautiful as well.
2258;Apocalypse Now is a screen masterpiece.
2259;The cinematography is outstanding, and along with the suppurb lighting, Coppola's story telling abilites shine through.
2260;He's finally brought to headquarters to receive his next mission, and after it, he wouldn't want another one.
2261;It was a real choice mission as he put it.
2262;Their experiences along the way is what makes the movie as great as it is in my opinion.
2263;He first visits the famous Captain Kilgore(portrayed by Robert Duvall) where he speaks the very popular quote, I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
2264;Its definetly a must see and I've heard it is the most realistic depiction of Vietnam.
2265;This is without a doubt, Francis Ford Coppola's true masterpiece.
2266;The critics liked it, but I didn't.
2267;Famous actors, but not a great movie.
2268;To see Apocalypse Now (in any version) on the big screen is a true experience unto itself.
2269;some of the deletes scenes on the bonus features section should have included in the new version.
2270;Brings so much of the crazy reality of the time to the screen.
2271;So many strong performances by big name actors.
2272;Maybe it is the best war movie ever.
2273;Francis Ford Coppola spent almost 3 years making this film and it was well worth it.
2274;The all star cast in this film rocks!
2275;Everytime I watch this film, I wind up mimicing the characters.
2276;(I love the smell of Napalm in the morning.)
2277;It is the greatest movie ever made!
2278;Love the movie both of versions of them.
2279;But the movie is great!!
2280;of documentaries, interesting and informative commentaries, interviews, deleted scenes and various other interesting bits (a video of Marlon Brando reciting T. s. Eliot and Orson Welles reciting Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness on old timey radio).
2281;the movies themselves are really great.
2282;I don't love the Redux but it works (I think the French Plantation scenes hammer a specific point home in a movie that works best being a little more.
2283;And I think it's fair to say that this is one of the few films to do justice to Joseph Conrad's novella, Heart of Darkness.
2284;feature with The Shining and There Will Be Blood.
2285;basically, I recommend this blu.
2286;It's one of the best and most complete sets since the 5.
2287;seen footage and interviews), illuminating commentary from Francis Coppola, and an excellent package.
2288;As for the disc change that is required to view the entire film, this seems to be done to ensure a high.
2289;Each movie is spilt between two discs!
2290;I have to say I am very pleased with this 2.
2291;first of all, the packaging is wonderful and creative.
2292;the picture quailty is amazing, the movie still has the same yellow/orange glow to it.
2293;the sound quailty is also amazing, the part where it sounds the best is when the officers inform Willard about his mission, the sound makes it feel like you ARE in the room.
2294;special Features are great, we get a bunch of Behind The Scenes featurettes, a commentary by Francis Ford Coppola and tons more.
2295;apocolypse now is a unique adaptation of conrad's novel 'heart of darkness'.
2296;it features excellent direction and editing along with a cast of some of the greatest movie stars of our time.
2297;It is all in all one of the most unique movie experiences of all time.
2298;Very good movie, full of symbolism as Sheen's character travels deeper and deeper up the river and into world of insanity where only the insane are the truly sane.
2299;So this film, as a matter of fact, is Vietnam, more from a psychological standpoint than a physical one.
2300;As he gets closer and closer to his objective, he becomes more and more obsessed with Kurtz.
2301;Like I said, the film is much more of a psychological metaphor.
2302;Psychological or not, Apocalypse Now Redux truly is an unforgettable viewing experience.
2303;Sound and picture are both pretty good.
2304;It is by far the better movie, and I would easily give it five stars.
2305;naturally, I was chomping at the bit to see the expanded movie.
2306;And it is interesting, of course, to see all the scenes that were left out.
2307;But the first cut is the product of the vision of the man who made the first two Godfather films, while the new cut seems to reflect the judgment of the man who made the third Godfather movie and Jack.
2308;I mean no disrespect to Mr. Coppola, and I continue to hope that he will yet make a movie that can compare to his towering achievements of the 70's.
2309;I'm sure that many of you will disagree with me.
2310;But I truly believe that you'll have a better chance of recognizing that this is one of the greatest films ever if you see it as Coppola originally conceived it.
2311;the 153 minute original and REDUX.
2312;But the transfers are magnificent, probably supervised by Coppola and sound designer/head editor Walter Murch.
2313;And maybe spectacular cinematographer Vittorio Storaro.
2314;screen photography, seemingly at a 1.85 ratio and not 2.35 scope, has brilliant color beyond what I saw in a theater.
2315;So watch the movies again without the commentary!What has been added to REDUX to make it what I personally agree with Coppola is a more rich and complex movie dramatically?
2316;it is great that the original 1979 film still exists intact for purists who find nothing wrong with it.
2317;It is a journey into fog and madness, more and more surreal, until they reach the deep jungle compound of Brando's madman Kurtz.
2318;Even on home video alone in a bedroom, this is a very strong and powerful movie experience.
2319;I think both films are masterpieces that Coppola can be very proud of.
2320;And I still think Sheen should have gotten top billing and an Oscar nomination in 1979.
2321;There is a cast member reunion, a featurette on the lush song score and instrumental score by Carmine and Francis Coppola, Brando reading all of THE HOLLOW MEN (he actually is very fine and chilling in this Joseph Conrad role that is basically a glorified cameo), a lost scene, and additional cutting room floor scenes for those who can't get enough at even 202 minutes.
2322;I also think Conrad and his admirers would be fascinated by it.
2323;And of course the music Wagner> What a great use of!But the most interesting statement is Every time I am in the jungle all I can think about is home, And when I am at home all I can think about is being back in the jungel WOW!>
2324;Apocalypse Now is definitely one of those films that people either get or don't.
2325;I am with the crowd that considers it one of the great film achievements of the 20th century.
2326;The color saturation is fantastic.
2327;Completely sealed, original edition and is a great addition to the original issue.
2328;dimensional story about the Vietnam war with Conrad's Heart of Darkness as the theme.
2329;A truly outstanding film by any standards, and in the wake of so many articulate reviews it's hard to add much, beyond giving it further well.
2330;i have always considered AN to be a true Art Movie in the classical sense, and the combination of inspired direction, production, casting, cinematography, screenplay, you name it, almost puts this movie out on its own.Yet there were a few questionables even in this work of genius.
2331;Still, it makes for a good movie.
2332;Overall, it succeeds mightily, and remains one of the best Vietnam movies yet made, and one full of memorable characters.
2333;The superb Duvall played the role of a lifetime as Kilgore, and he was just about dead on .
2334;most of the guys still wear their Stetsons to this day.
2335;if you have never seen this movie, you are in for an incredible experience.
2336;for much of the film, the smaller ratio actually serves as an improvement, by increasing the visual impact of the scene on your home TV.
2337;But in some of the best scenes ever put to film .
2338;Because whenever you view a movie at home instead of in a theater, you are making a compromise, especially with as big and as bold a movie as Apocalypse Now Redux.
2339;The additional scenes are fascinating, and really fill out the story.
2340;(Most people don't like the French scene, because it does seem out of place, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.)
2341;By the way, if you are one of those weirdo purists who doesn't like the extra scenes, fine.
2342;If ever there was a movie lending itself to another disc or two full of extras, this is it.
2343;Heck, there is even a documentary made about this movie!
2344;(Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse, by Coppola's wife).
2345;I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
2346;robert Duvall is amazing as Col. Kilgore, the commander that you new would make it though without a scratch.
2347;It's a piece of historical social commentary on the non.
2348;It shows us as opposed to making us feel the central idea by seeing a tight story propelled by the choices of the characters.
2349;Sure the scenery is memorable and the situations weird and unforgettable, but so is a National Geographic article.
2350;it certainly was moving, but the story line itself become insane and a horror.
2351;it is still good entertainment with bonus horror and insanity.
2352;Dennis Hopper plays a brilliant bit part as the photojournalist
2353;along with Coppola, John Milius has written a brilliant a subtle screenplay about the horror of war, the whole film works well although it is renowned for the multitude of problems while filming.
2354;The best movie ever made regarding the Viet Nam war.
2355;The film captures the horror young men had to endure
2356;Great Vietnam version of Heart of Darkness.
2357;Martin Sheen did a good job with his portrayal of the Captain charged with exterminating Kurtz with extreme prejudice.
2358;Col. Kurtz actually represented the hubris American political power going rogue.
2359;marlon Brando plays a superb role as Col. Kurtz.
2360;Crawling, slithering, along the edge of a straight razor.
2361;Nevertheless, one of the most exhaustive inquiries into the status of the conflict yet compiled offers considerable evidence that the weight of US power two.
2362;Even so, he is sufficiently impressed with the findings and sufficiently anxious to make their conclusions known to permit experts who have been working on it to talk about it in general terms.
2363;The image and audio transfer are quite good but the additional footage (while enjoyable to watch) did not add anything to the overall film.
2364;I am absolutely baffled at how one of the most incredible movies ever made can continue to get such bizarre treatment.
2365;To this day it remains the most powerful movie experience I ever had.
2366;while all that stuff is interesting in and of itself, here it just serves to degrade the masterpiece that came out in 1979.
2367;It was all part of the creative process .
2368;Just watch the life .
2369;and in this case the life of this masterpiece is the movie that came out in 1979.
2370;Stop prying into its birthing process!
2371;People went on and on about the French plantation scene for years and how it was so great.
2372;The only thing watching all this 'extra stuff has done is highlight how much of a miracle it was that they came out with such a brilliant movie when they had so much film to get lost in!)
2373;He never made another great movie after AN.
2374;It just came out and was its brilliant self.
2375;It worked brilliantly on an epic scale.
2376;As the Vietnam War fades into the past, a fresh look at war movies may be due, with the Apocalypse Now Redux an excellent candidate.
2377;What was a superior original movie is still a superior movie with the additional footage.
2378;The arguments that it is a somewhat better film are reasonable, as are the arguments that the footage adds little value and perhaps harms the flow.
2379;The story can be viewed simply as being about the nastiness of war.
2380;Enjoy the lesson, which you already knew anyway, and the flow and how Coppola develops the theme.
2381;top scenes, and is there a more over.
2382;top moment in movie history than Kilgore, napalm, and surfing?
2383;The contrast with the deadly serious scenes is astounding, yet they still come together in a model of anything goes.
2384;And Apocalypse Now is a true classic that will be watched decades hence.
2385;Overall very good will watch again.
2386;As a kid I remember hearing about Apocalypse Now and thinking that it was some sort of dark and forbidden territory for a war movie.
2387;i watched the original a number of times and it was entertaining as compact, action packed and surreal.
2388;But I always heard stories about The French Plantation Scene and The Bunny Scene.
2389;And now we have his whole vision.
2390;But the humor makes it all the more surreal.
2391;It gives his vision much more majesty and breathing room.
2392;It was also what most of the viewers wanted to see all along with the long rumored forbidden scenes.
2393;It really is a great film*****
2394;scenes documentary feature is legendary.
2395;I'm a huge fan of Coppola's vision.
2396;The added Duvall scenes: At first I thought it was brilliant.
2397;I actually laughed my ass off.
2398;I found it very funny.2.)
2399;I found those to be creepy and added an interesting view of Kurtz's control over the villageThats it as I remember them.
2400;This is the second best vietnam war movie of all time.
2401;Now this movie is a true blu ray.
2402;The picture is 5/5 and audio is 5/5.
2403;Every scene is classic and memorable.
2404;Beautiful impressive cinematography and landscapes do not make up for the lack of human interaction in the movie.
2405;Underlying the entire film seems to be the philosophy of the glory of violence, Coppola seems to be asking us to admire Kurts's spirit of independance, his credentials as a philosopher a prophet and a pioneer.
2406;One scene i admired was the utterly surreal stripshow performed by the three US dancing girls for the leering soldiers deep in Vietnam territory, sums up the sheer insanity of the period and this sums up the one area in which this film might be explained and praised .
2407;This is easily the best Vietnam film and the greatest war film ever.
2408;Marlon Brando offers an intimidating and overpowering performance.
2409;The impact he exerts in the film is profound, even though his face remains in shadow for the most of the duration of his appearance.
2410;A classic of the now outdated genre of Vietnam films.
2411;I watch this movie whenever I feel depressed (and have a lot of extra time on my hands!)
2412;After having read over 100 of the previous reviews (many of them fascinating.
2413;I suppose it would have served the movie best to have this extra footage as deleted scenes, and added the documentary as part of a special features package.
2414;Commentary should be included as well.
2415;As far as Sheen's performance that another reviewer ragged on, it's masterful.
2416;He looks great, his voiceovers make a huge difference on the film's impact, and his acting has never been better.
2417;What also makes it so powerful is that these depictions are allowed to breath, so the viewer has plenty of time to let the impact sink in.
2418;Lastly, I highly recommend (as some other reviewers have) the documentary on 'Apocalypse Now'.
2419;Made by Coppola's wife, and released in the 90s, it's as mesmerizing as the movie, sometimes more so.
2420;while hardly a classic, the film is a textbook example of how a great deal of money and simply gorgeous photography and creative editing can cover up a very simple fact.
2421;is really a comedy almost a satire that while makes fun of the American military also presents the viewer with a superb Duvall as the extremely competent Air Calvary Commander Kilgore who.
2422;is a great soldier in the American tradition.
2423;Kilgore's segment also contains one of the best sustained battle sequences of the 1970s.
2424;It is quite exhilarating and completely negates the Commie prop intentions.
2425;will be betrayed by those who should be his allies.
2426;an interesting runaway train of a film.
2427;nice to see Commie prop being the one that gets subverted for a change.
2428;Apocalypse Now is a superb film.
2429;The cinematography is amazing and the acting and direction is great and very believable.
2430;It's very good all the way through .
2431;It's very surreal and eerie though, it really is a good ending, it's just .
2432;in fact, you most definitely should, it's a fantastic movie.
2433;Even so, Apocalypse Now is, in my opinion one of the best war movies ever.
2434;If you like Vietnam war films then watch this, it's amazing.
2435;Every actor is great, the directing has sparks of genious mixed with shots that are subpar.
2436;But this is an excellent movie, and really not much about the Vietnam War.
2437;A little hard to follow at times and but a great movie and a bonafied classic.
2438;Lots of classic lines and memorable performances.
2439;whup' of a helicopter's propellers is audible over a black screen, which slowly reveals a lush, exotic forest.
2440;well that's one story anyway.
2441;In fact he produced a masterpiece
2442;Aided by the great editor and sound designer Walter Murch, and the glorious cinematography of Vittorio Storaro, Coppola made Apocalypse Now less of a typical war movie and more of a hallucinogenic trip down the river of a young man's mind and soul.
2443;To see Kilgore standing tall, admiring the waves, while all those around him duck to avoid the flying bullets and explosions, is to witness one of modern cinema's most memorable characterizations.
2444;Kilgore is blessed with some of the film's most memorable lines .
2445;and is at the center of 'Apocalypse Now''s greatest sequence.
2446;The helicopter attack, accompanied by Wagner's 'The Ride of the Valkyries', is one of the most incredible pieces of filmmaking in history.
2447;Spectacular, horrific and undeniably thrilling, the attack is masterfully orchestrated by Coppola and is even more satisfying in these days of CGI and digital fakery.
2448;Willard and his crew slowly make their way up the river to confront Kurtz, and the anticipation of Brando's appearance grows.
2449;It turns Kurtz into mythical figure, and Brando's portrayal suits the character of Kurtz, a man drunk on power, broken by warfare.
2450;Some of this footage was welcome (More Duvall, more Brando, the Playboy bunnies), while the long, politically motivated French plantation sequence adds little to the film and detracts from the film's narrative.
2451;Apocalypse Now was a film made by people out of their minds, with the odds stacked against them, and the film reflected that background .
2452;it's what made it so special.
2453;Nevertheless, Apocalypse Now is a film that everyone should see in some form, a true masterpiece which reveals new layers and aspects with each repeat viewing.
2454;Will we ever see the like of it again?
2455;The film is the ultimate apotheosis of 70's filmmaking .
2456;In it's own unique and magnificent way, Apocalypse Now reflects the madness, intensity and the horror, the horror of warfare.
2457;An exceptional war film in every sense, it pulsates with artistic ambition.
2458;It reaches for truth, struggles for greatness.
2459;It adds many layers of history and nuance and understanding.
2460;The original film brilliantly alternated between dreamlike and nightmarish meditations on the nature of war, but I always wanted to see the epic breadth and depth this story deserved.
2461;Obviously, even with the TOTALLY CRAPPY AND UNNECESSARY added footage, this is STILL a good movie, maybe even a very good one.
2462;The one I saw back in 1979 in the theater, third row center, the images and power and perfect editing and sound and fury and music making me PAY in theaters a couple dozen times at least to see.
2463;This itself was awful, as I found that the original theatrical release with the final credits put to explosive fire and bombing was just so cool and appropriate to the film experience as a whole.
2464;edited version of the film coming out, I first thought, how can one improve on almost total film perfection?
2465;I finally saw this version, THIS VERSION, and was highly hopeful.
2466;bombing ending eliminated (as it was with the VHS tape I still own and enjoy from time to time), but eeeee.
2467;all in all, after viewing the original (and my VHS tape, which eliminated the theatrical ending), as this was the best film I'd ever seen, I was most interested in seeing this Redux version.
2468;mates steal Killgore's prized surfboard.
2469;hearted killer he really is).
2470;while I could live with and accept the minor changes as mentioned above, and while they are pretty cool to see, the TWO MAIN extended scenes mentioned above, simply do NOT WORK.
2471;The two added extended scenes in Redux really detract greatly from the overall experience of what I still consider the best film of all time.
2472;the original Apocalypse Now is still, in my warped view, the greatest movie the Hollywood studio system ever came up with.
2473;The Redux version interrupts the flow and virtually perfect, shot by shot, scene by scene excellence, and anyone searching for the best and certainly most excellent version of this film will reject Redux and go for the original.
2474;redux version you are able to.
2475;It's cool to see the extra scenes, but they don't add enough to the movie to justify themselves.
2476;The film has a mythic status and I wanted to finally experience the film.
2477;Infrequently, a film director creates a film based on material they passionately believe in.
2478;When this happens, every frame of the film reflects this passion.
2479;It creates a riveting experience for the viewer.
2480;Apocalypse Now is one of a handful of films in which this happens.
2481;about eight or nine years ago, Francis Ford Coppola presented a new print of the film at the SF International Film Festival, on a big screen, in the original Roadshow presentation he intended.
2482;The film is not supposed to be pleasant, but I did come away with a greater admiration of the skill of the filmmakers.
2483;Coppola, the actors, Vittorio Storraro, Walter Murch, Dean Tavoularis and others poured their heart and soul into the film.
2484;The film is a great work of art.
2485;martin Sheen is outstanding as Willard.
2486;Brando is riveting as Kurtz.
2487;the film depicts Willard's journey, up the river, to his goal, Kurtz.
2488;This scene is interesting more for the fact that it is pretty much the only time a female is present in the film.
2489;the film is memorable from the beginning depiction of Willard's memories, a helicopter flying through his subconscious as he watches a ceiling fan spin lazily to his final confrontation with Kurtz.
2490;A small bit segment has been added to the scenes involving Kilgore and his men.
2491;When Willard and his crew meetv them again, they interact, adding more depth to their characters.
2492;It is also most notable for the nudity involved.
2493;Naturally, they offer Willard and his crew a place to rest and eat.
2494;If anything, the additional scenes detract slightly from the power of the original vision.
2495;'Redux' brings to life the greatest war story of this generation in a completely new perspective.
2496;'Redux' adds nearly an hour of extra footage which gives more depth to the already epic film.
2497;The French Plantation sequence (nearly 30 minutes long) is the real highlight of the new footage.
2498;This is an elaborate series of scenes with completely new faces (including Aurore Clemente).
2499;The extended sequence of scenes with Kurtz at the end is an additional highlight on 'Redux' along with a haunting new soundtrack.
2500;The result is as magnificent today as it was 20 years ago.
2501;The cinematography is unmatched and the attention to detail is witnessed in every scene.
2502;Apocalypse Now directed by Francis Ford Coppola reminds us to do the most important task, that is to take the long difficult journey inward.
2503;In the end Willard answers the ultimate question, how is he going to be while on earth.
2504;The great accomplishment of so many is to work at jobs that are killing them long enough to receive a pension.
2505;Willard finds these African .
2506;The child that our soldiers share candy with today could plant an explosive devise next week.
2507;Coppola has SPLIT the film into two halves, Part One of the '79 and '01 versions being on the first disc, and Part Two on the other.
2508;in my opinion the original cut worked really well, but the new footage adds in a worthwhile way.
2509;there is a filling out of character and historical situation with the new footage.
2510;i think it makes a strong difference to have the french plantation scene because it brings women into the film in more than just the playboy bunny way.
2511;fuel sequence, as far as i'm concerned, makes the bizarreness of the whole heart.
2512;darkness world all the stronger by moving directly into the realm of sex/women as a commodity.
2513;those kids and kurtz peering down through those jagged wholes in the sweat box make a stunning and unique image in a film full of stunning and unique images.
2514;fantastic shifts between the doors, and this running electronic score that fades in and out from machine.
2515;Beautiful video and audio, it took a long time for this to show up but the wait was worth it.
2516;I have always been a huge fan of the original Apocolypse Now.
2517;The most notable change for me was the insanity of every scene.
2518;the added scenes added a dimension to this film that seemed almost implied before.
2519;Coppolla once again demonstrates his genius not only by removing them initially to maintain a more reasonable length, but in having the confidence that the true movie goer would finally be prepared for the insane onslaught laid before them.
2520;To call Francis Ford Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW one of the greatest films ever made is a major understatement.
2521;, it's an unforgettable journey into the darkest reaches of the human heart.
2522;It's unquestionably the greatest and most horrifying film made about the Vietnam War
2523;Some could even argue that APOCALYPSE NOW is the greatest film of all time.
2524;brilliant man who has gone insane and set himself up as a God and the leader of a Vietnamese tribe.
2525;The story behind the film is legendary
2526;legendary documentary entitled HEARTS OF DARKNESS: A FILMMAKER'S APOCALYPSE.
2527;Filming ran for an incredible 16 months, and editing lasted for roughly two years.
2528;the film is a masterpiece.
2529;Chef points out that the woman is still alive.
2530;As he begins hauling her on the ship, Willard walks over and shoots her in the heart.
2531;as far as filmmaking goes, APOCALYPSE NOW is perfection.
2532;There's excellent acting from all involved
2533;in another wonderful role, this time as a photojournalist .
2534;Vittorio Storaro's cinematography is nothing short of spectacular.
2535;APOCALYPSE NOW also features what may be the greatest lighting in film history, particularly toward the end of the film.
2536;It's a chilling, brilliant voyage from start to finish.
2537;hard fans will enjoy, and notice exactly where the 49 minutes have been added.
2538;The film will go down as an 'art' classic, this is understandable.
2539;The brief action scenes are full of bright lighting and artistic takes (some bullets fly with red trails, yellow trails, completely unrealistic but stylish).
2540;The famous bombing scene with Duvall and the helicopters is shot wounderfully, classical music booming, bright coloured flares and bizzare flourescent explosions.
2541;Capped off with the famous line of ah, I love the smell of napalm in the morning!
2542;The plot is very simple, Martin Sheen must find Marlon Brando who is a highly skilled, highly intelligent man who has simply gone mad due to the war.
2543;The film takes a deep plunge into both man's minds, and it's intiguing to say the least.
2544;the story and theme are complex and the cinematography from Vittorio Storarrro is magnificent.
2545;its a multi layered film similiar to the Oddysey in its layers .
2546;Martin Sheens best performance of his career
2547;This is simply a fantastic movie.
2548;It's eerie and dark, and a bit twisted.
2549;As far as war movies go, it's a good one.
2550;This movie is still just as good as when I first saw it many years ago.
2551;Good storyline and performances by Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall with a little bit of humor blended into the war action and drama.
2552;Crawling, slithering across the edge of straightrazor and surviving.
2553;Your mission objective is simple enough, go up the river, locate Kurtz, and terminate with extreme prejudice.
2554;His mission is simple enough, going up the river and finding his prey of a man, or at least that's how it seems.
2555;to which the film makes it clear that it pays a great deal of homage, it is about the madness of the events set into motion engulfing this one small figure and the futility of many of the actions/interactions located along the way.
2556;The stellar casting accents this further, letting forces like a young Larry Fishburne and an equally young Harrison Ford play side by side with the Sheens and Brandos as they showcase a diversity of talents.
2557;This example is one of the best I've seen, showing its viewers the wonders involved in the art of making a very dramatic example of what warring encompasses.
2558;It also has some interesting extras, including the comparisons to Conrad's Heart of Darkness, letting someone that hasn't been inducted into the work taste some of the symbology buried within those pages.
2559;sure, the themes are more clearly expressed here, for instance the sex.
2560;also, the added amount of Willard's voice over, where the background of Kurtz and Willard's growing sympathy towards Kurtz are more clearly explained.
2561;daylight) chases away a considerable ammount of Kurtz's mystery.
2562;true, Coppola has now made his point clear.
2563;But I wonder which one would be a more powerful film.
2564;Francis Ford Coppola's ground breaking vietnam epic has engrained itself in American culture for many reasons.
2565;The moment the film opens with the sound of helicopter blades buzzing in the backround and THe End (music by the DOORS) playing wimsically, the audience knows they are in for a journey.
2566;The pilgramage that Sheen makes leads him to a symbolic, haunting, emotionally tugging finale that, while somewhat too cerebral makes for a chilling end and reality.
2567;Look for an oscar nominated performance by Robert Duvall and his now infamous Ride of the Valkyries scene.
2568;This film was nominated for best picture, won two academy awards and was ranked #29 on the AFI's top 100 list.
2569;Marlon Brando Robert Duvall are amazing as always.
2570;All the added scenes do is make a long movie even longer.
2571;Got this movie after looking on line for it, had good reviews so I ordered it.
2572;Came in good time just before fathers day and when we went to watch it, wont play because it says cant play movie in region one, only in region two.
2573;Would of been nice to know this before I ordered it.
2574;The cinematography alone is unseen.
2575;Add Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen and you've got a classic.
2576;This is a definite, must.
2577;If you enjoyed this film in the theater and and the VHS version of this film, you'll enjoy this version.
2578;Can anyone really believe that Francis Ford Coppola wanted this film to be an unmercifully drole three stooges comedy?Was it only the editor's work that formed a soul.
2579;When I first saw the original, I thought:here's finally a movie for Vietnam vets.
2580;happy when they stop the sampan?
2581;these questions and more are answered in this greatly expanded version of what's now my favorite movie.
2582;journalist and Colby and even give us the very interesting Monkey Sampan).
2583;anyway, this is a considerable improvement on an already great movie.
2584;A truly great, magnificent film that permanently expanded the war genre.
2585;I love the smell of naplam in the morning.
2586;I'll take my Apocalypse standard classic light, thank you very much.
2587;This is my favorite film of all time.
2588;There are very good reasons for the orginal edit.
2589;Instead, when I played it on blue.
2590;In fact, I'm pretty dang sure that's what I saw.
2591;I wonder if the director wimped out?Other than all that, this is a great movie, and having it at what I consider great resolution makes it worthwhile.
2592;Godfather director and great cast.
2593;I thought Coppola could reflect on the film and release an improved version with the extra footage.
2594;While I really liked Redux, I absolutely loved the original version.
2595;i don't think Redux is worth your time.
2596;Some people will say you should watch both or treat them as independent movies.
2597;I found that the parts that I liked in Redux were from the original version and the parts that I didn't like were only in Redux.
2598;Sheen, Brando, Duvall, Hopper and the others are excellent here in an anti.
2599;The actors do a superb job under Coppola's direction, and the film lets you see the destruction of war without being too preachy.
2600;Much to my delight there was so much micromanagement of this film.
2601;This 1979 film looks great.
2602;and the inclusion of both versions of the film was a nice perk.
2603;The best Vietnam movie from the best director of his generation.
2604;so to that end, Cappola brings a trip up the African Congo into the 20th century with a US Navy river boat in Viet Nam.
2605;the restored scenes add quite alot to the movie, but the price paid is in seat time.
2606;Some do little to enhance the story, but some give fascinating glimpses into the environment and the characters that live in it.
2607;The extras are good and the additional scenes don't really detract from the overall production.
2608;Great video for the price.
2609;The seller was very professional and provided rapid shipping for the item.
2610;Would recommend the sell to anyone seeking used videos.
2611;Keep up the good work.
2612;One of those movies that is a must have in your stack.
2613;I recommend this movie to everyone old enough to understand it.
2614;The bulk of the original special features are carried over to this edition as well.
2615;we also get a lovely 48 page soft cover book with behind.
2616;Apocalpyse Now would be Coppola's truly last great film (although he would make some exceptional ones in its wake)and proved to almost be his own personal apocalpyse where the director began to question the wisdom of making the film in the first place.
2617;I made a cool music vid about my favorite War movie .
2618;The best War movie made .
2619;Excellent image, incredible sound, original theatrical aspect ratio, and some of the most interesting special features I've seen in a collectors set in a very long time.
2620;That's the best part of the movie.
2621;it's a classic and I sometimes found myself shaking my head in disbelief or laughing at it.
2622;still, when he struck out to kill, his speed was impressive enough to just make the illusion hold.
2623;watching Laurence fishburne groove is also a treat.
2624;watching him do mick jagger is even better!
2625;He showed me something interesting.
2626;Francis Ford Coppola recently,along with editor Walter Murch,has created a new version of Apocalypse Now, with restored new footage.
2627;Having seen Redux on a theater screen I can attest to the superior composition employed by Vittorio Storaro.
2628;That sequence is absolutely a miracle to behold, especially with the superb sound mix.
2629;a masterpiece be handled with utter disrespect, and by his own hands no less.
2630;It's an amazing composition, but it is CHOPPED AWAY.
2631;It's a brief, but striking example of widescreen framing.
2632;Instead, Coppolla made one of the best war films of all time.
2633;There are also a number of unforgettable characters who play only bit roles: Robert Duvall as the hilarious Captain Kilgore who blows up an entire Vietnamese village just to surf, Dennis Hopper playing a spacy American photo.
2634;Everybody on Willard's boat is portrayed marvelously by such actors as Lawrence Fishburne, who was only 17 while this film was being made.
2635;Even Sheen provides a strong performance as the lead, although he can't help the fact that some of his narrations seem to take themselves too seriously.
2636;For the most part, though, this movie was very well.
2637;It was an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's early 20th Century book, Heart of Darkness.
2638;For an even better experience than Apocalypse Now, special recommendation goes to Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse, which is a documentary about the struggles of making this movie, shot by Coppolla's wife.
2639;Thats right, soldiers in this film go surfing.
2640;Many Intense scenes depicting killings in many ways!
2641;We all know that whether or not you like it, Apocalypse Now is a landmark film.
2642;At times I think its been slightly overrated, but it's one I would show to a film class.
2643;I liked the way Kilgore's character exited the film the first time.
2644;The movie is a classic, and the box set is beautiful.
2645;A must own for fans.
2646;This is a great movie.
2647;i think Martin Sheen and Marlin Brando,Robert Duvall did a fine job acting.
2648;ray issue are both superb.
2649;Coppola filmed some scenes that look and sound amazing in blu.
2650;It will make you appreciate the film even more.
2651;Awesome job by Charley Sheen both acting and narrating.
2652;Viewing it that way, and the scenes of what it was like on the river, are immensely realistic.
2653;The original Apocalypse Now stands as a great movie that I'd give 5 stars.
2654;the added footage of the surfing sequence was good the helicopter playing a recording of Duvall on a loop imploring Lance to return his surfboard is priceless.
2655;This superb rendering of the underbelly of the Vietnam War and the juxtaposition of both moral and political forces is worth the watch.
2656;Lots to think about in this movie.
2657;This is one of my favorite films of all time.
2658;The image and sound were incredible.
2659;For the most part the added scenes work really well, but the color balance for the film, even the original scenes, was all over the place.
2660;At least the sound is consistently excellent.
2661;Coppola's friend George Lucas could undoubtedly supervise a flagship transfer of this extraordinary movie.
2662;a solid five star movie, with compelling extras.
2663;What I am going to tell you is why this movie is so great, and why you need to watch it.
2664;Because if you distill it to the very bare bones, it is a journey.
2665;But those three hours are filled with scenes that keep you glued to your seat.
2666;Some people complained about the levity that was added to the film, but I actually think this was a great move.
2667;It made the people on the boat feel like real human beings and made you care for the characters even more.
2668;The reason I call this movie a horror, is because most of what is depicted in the film could happen in real life.
2669;What can you say about one of the greatest Vietnam Movies ever made, 5 stars is an understatement!This movie draws you in and believe me when they say Don't ever get off the F*$&ing
2670;It's the best Vietnam War movie I've seen.
2671;I watch every couple of years as it's that good.
2672;to be honest, I was told it was a great movie, so I tried watching it 3 times to be exact.
2673;But it was well made and engrossing.
2674;The original Apocalypse Now is an awe.
2675;inspiring masterpiece, there's no doubt
2676;Memorable scenes abound, starting with the blow.your.
2677;Speaking of Sheen, people overlook the fact that he carries the film and does so brilliantly.
2678;His haunting narration is one of the most effective narrations in cinematic history and hooks the viewer into the nightmare.
2679;And he is still in the field commanding troops.
2680;operating out there beyond the parameters and restrictions typically linked to my work.
2681;Naturally any fan of the original film MUST see Redux to view this extra footage.
2682;In the original there's a water.
2683;but he made the right decision to omit the board.
2684;theft scene and place the water.
2685;In fact, they ruin Kilgore's perfect swan song in the original.
2686;Needless to say, Coppola made the right choices in his original 1979 edit of the film.
2687;Apocalypse Now is a 10/10 picture
2688;Claiming that Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is the greatest movie ever would seem to be a bold statement to anyone not acquanted with the movie.
2689;Sure, a movie probably won't change your life as much as say, reading Les Miserables , or For Whom the Bell Tolls , but it will definitely make an impression on you at the very least.
2690;In addition, it is directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the director of the Godfather Trilogy, and many other excellent movies.
2691;And the soundtrack is composed by Carmine Coppola, and features Jim Morrison's The End (a rendition of The End that will almost certainly leave a lasting impression !)
2692;despite all the difficulties in producing the films, both rank, along with The Godfather Saga, among the greatest films of recent years.
2693;This film was nominated for both Best Picture and Directing.
2694;this is an epic tale of a man (Willard) with a mission to kill an ex.
2695;The film is very well made, and can be analyzed for hours.
2696;Being in a distant land away from home, away from loved ones, needing to kill.
2697;See this film, for the inspiration, and epic story telling it contains.
2698;There are so many memorable characters, and moments.
2699;If you like war films, you have to see this, and anyone who likes an interesting story would enjoy this.
2700;But beware this film contains strong themes of horror and insanity.
