I:8888;1;Better than I thought it would end up being.
I:8888;2;love this movie and this version looks excellent on my television.
I:8888;3;It's rare that I give a movie 5 stars, but if there were ever a film to deserve one, it's this one.
I:8888;4;This film was up against What's Love Got to Do With It and won.
I:8888;5;He was able to feel her music and understood that she was inextricably linked to the piano.
I:8888;6;Personally, I thought Keitel was extremely masculine and sexy in this movie (and no, not because of the frontal nudity).
I:8888;7;It was all rough and tumble, rugged male sensuality and I loved it.
I:8888;8;I find it refreshing that this movie presented the characters as not being all good or all bad.
I:8888;9;The movie as a whole is very profoundly crafted.
I:8888;10;It creates a mood and stays on your mind much after the movie is over!
I:8888;11;A must see for those interested in getting a lasting experience!
I:8888;12;I highly recommend this movie.
I:8888;13;This film greets us with that suggestion, as such, and guessing is one thing compared to another: not proof.
I:8888;14;There is no right way to enjoy this film, only let it soak into you.
I:8888;15;If you love this film you'll surely enjoy the way the songs melt into you from the skin up.
I:8888;16;A neighbor offers to bring it up, in return for some lesons, and a love triangle develops.
I:8888;17;this movie has a very original story line, good characters, and very good acting that bring up the best in the movie.
I:8888;18;The soundtrack is terrific, and combines very well with this movie since this is Ada's voice and her only way to express herself, even if she is miosunderstood by the surrounding society.
I:8888;19;This movie is especially worth watching for all music lovers out there!
I:8888;20;Don't get me wrong, I loved it but it is Cinderella 100%
I:8888;21;Interesting but not a favorite.
I:8888;22;The acting was superb however~!
I:8888;23;Anna was amazing in this piece of work.
I:8888;24;This provocative and powerful story is like a fairytale for adults.
I:8888;25;The characters despair and passion, and the extraordinary beauty captured by the camera all contribute to the haunting intimacy of this film.
I:8888;26;It's by far my favorite movie.
I:8888;27;HiNice and interesting drama , but the best part is Holly Hunter naked, long scene, a rare appearance for this actress.
I:8888;28;she had a talent for accents even at that young age.
I:8888;29;Great performances by all actors involved, and a dark, beautiful tale of forbidden love, raw passion, jealousy, wanting, contrasting cultures and personalities.
I:8888;30;"The story is tender and sweet one moment, a psychological thriller the next
I:8888;31;This was a great film.
I:8888;32;One of the best movies I have seen yet.
I:8888;33;Harvey Keitel does great with his intense character.
I:8888;34;Over all I think it has a good story line and rather good character development.
I:8888;35;This is a movie definatly for those of us that are a bit more artistic and passionate about it.
I:8888;36;This movie was amazing and I would recommend this to anyone who would enjoy something that has drama, a bit of romance (in the sexual sense.
I:8888;37;She gives it up because she now has a man?
I:8888;38;Generally, I love moody, period pieces, but I disliked this film initially and disliked it again when I decided to give it a second try in 2007.
I:8888;39;sympathetic character is Sam Neill's.
I:8888;40;After a tough journey she arrives in a strange land, and the only thing that matters to her besides her daughter is her piano, which allows her to express her feelings.
I:8888;41;But her woodheaded husband leaves it on the beach.
I:8888;42;the actors, the direction, the music are simply outstanding, and if The Piano hadn't been released in the same year as Schindler's List, it certainly would have gained more Oscars.
I:8888;43;just the end will have you discuss for ages .
I:8888;44;I remember reading this extensive review for it lauding it as one of the most deeply moving and touching films of the 20th century.
I:8888;45;It took me until early this year before I actually got around to seeing it, and I must say that after a slew of repeat viewings I can honestly understand why that review held this film on such a pedestal.
I:8888;46;There are many actions and resulting consequences that seem out of place of character and even may be frustration (and most definitely startling) but when one takes the time to really break this film down there is so much explanation to be found within the subtleties in each frame that one is brought to a whole other understanding of the film.
I:8888;47;Through her mind's voice she tells us that she has been offered in marriage to farmer Alisdair Stewart and so she travels with her young daughter Flora and her beloved piano by boat to meet him.
I:8888;48;She soon finds herself being led to her new home, her piano being left behind on the beach.
I:8888;49;That label gravely shortchanges what writer/director Jan Campion has accomplished with this cinematic masterpiece.
I:8888;50;all of the four central characters are seeking a form of redemption or gratification for their lives.
I:8888;51;Her jealousy gives way to foolishness, and her foolishness places her mother in harms way.
I:8888;52;the performances by the entire cast are flawless and really elevate this beautiful film.
I:8888;53;Both Holly Hunter and Anna Paquin earned those Oscar's, both giving riveting performances and crawling deep within the psyche of their characters.
I:8888;54;Without saying but a few words Hunter is able to speak volumes, her voice being heard on every frame.
I:8888;55;Harvey Keitel is amazing as George, restrained and tempered and believable as a lover, which is not something I was sure he could pull off.
I:8888;56;Sam Neill, though, is the real male standout.
I:8888;57;jan Campion must receive the bulk of the credit though, for her construction of this film is majestic to say the least.
I:8888;58;She truly captures the heart of each character, weaving the audience into each frame and leaving us begging for more.
I:8888;59;"The cinematography is gripping and magnetic, each frame gently settling down on the images below
I:8888;60;There are few films this important, and truly few films this glorious.
I:8888;61;Everything is top notch, from the delicate script to the effortless acting to the serene camera work.
I:8888;62;"`The Piano' is a cinematic wonder that is unrivaled, a film that truly defines the very word
I:8888;63;and the story is about a mute woman where two man are interested in her and one of the man finally won her heart through her beloved piano.
I:8888;64;imagine entertainment for film/movie the Da Vinci Code.
I:8888;65;An amazing, overwhelming film that really manages to grab your attention right from the beginning.
I:8888;66;Holly Hunter manages to express a lot with her eyes, she performs with extreme vigor, passion and flamboyancy, you can't take your eyes off her, every moment she manages to convey something or the other to the viewer, Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel are excellent.
I:8888;67;The film starts with a normal slow pace but gets very dark and bold slowly.
I:8888;68;The score is beautiful, the chemistry between every co. star is excellent in the film, the film doesn't emphasize on romance or just passionate tales, there is much more than that as the film gets very bold in terms of human sexuality and can be disturbing to the viewer at times.
I:8888;69;Moreover, the film is a pure example of neat acting and direction, beautiful locations and a priceless Piano score makes the film worthwhile.
I:8888;70;This has always been one of my favorite movies.
I:8888;71;I was so looking forward to see this movie because it featured some of my favorite actors.
I:8888;72;first of all this movie isn't at all difficult to comprehend, a Maori guy blackmails a mute, married woman to have sex with him just so she can get her most beloved possession, her piano back.
I:8888;73;Usually I have no problem with it at all and I can feel the love.
I:8888;74;There was NO chemistry, just erotism.
I:8888;75;the music, the music of the piano theme was beautiful.
I:8888;76;Also, the whole Maori situation made me have NO respect for their culture, unlike other movie involved natives have.
I:8888;77;The acting is superb though!
I:8888;78;They are the Oscar winners that used sign language in a film.
I:8888;79;And remember the moment that Ada wrote a love note on the piano key?
I:8888;80;Holly Hunter does a superior job at her part.
I:8888;81;I've always liked Sam Neill's work, and Harvey Keitel fits his part so well.
I:8888;82;And a great surprise end!
I:8888;83;If you like to read maybe you should read this book, for fiery romance, erotic excitement and a good story.
I:8888;84;This is a brilliant movie.
I:8888;85;While not a 'chick flick' it does look at things from a woman's point of view but that is what makes it more intense, romantic, poetic and moving.
I:8888;86;like cinematography and score make the New Zeland coast and jungles come alive.
I:8888;87;Beautiful ensemble acting by the 4 leads especially Anna Paquina and Holly Hunter.
I:8888;88;Sam Neill is also great as the husband who slowly goes insane, and Harvey Keitel surprised me in this un.
I:8888;89;typical role for him, he's always been a great actor and this is proof of it.
I:8888;90;Beautifully filmed poetic scenes and a special 'women's touch' courtesy of Jane Campion.
I:8888;91;From a scale of 1.10 I give this movie a 9!
I:8888;92;This is an excellenct movie for adults.
I:8888;93;It is a love story with tons of romance, beautiful scenery, and the story behind the movie is a great one.
I:8888;94;The star of this film is a grand piano which Ada brought from Scotland to New Zealand, along with her young daughter, Flora, as she arrives for an arranged marriage.
I:8888;95;She speaks through her musical talent as she makes that piano speak as no classical pianist could do any better.
I:8888;96;It could have been Yanni there playing by the sea, it was so beautiful.
I:8888;97;Little Flora loved to make up stories about her absent father, that he had been a great German composer and died after being struck by lightning.
I:8888;98;Getting the piano moved to the home of George Baines, who was illiterate but bought the piano at a price which changed all of their lives.
I:8888;99;Was it worth the price?
I:8888;100;"When she heard that George was leaving the island, she send her ""thank you"" for the piano, the ""C"" note out of the piano."
I:8888;101;Stewart sets her free because he loved her.
I:8888;102;headed determined woman who lost her reason to live, let the past go and reconfigured her future with the man she loved.
I:8888;103;This movie won an Academy Award.
I:8888;104;Holly Hunter did a fantastic acting job, though I could have done without the nude scenes.
I:8888;105;I enjoyed it even more the second time around.
I:8888;106;It is a very emotional and riveting story of a chosen husband by her father and another man that enters her life because of her piano.
I:8888;107;One of the best movies of all times.
I:8888;108;A love story of the strangest sort, but one I continue to watch over and over and never tire of it.
I:8888;109;This is an excellent film.
I:8888;110;The cinematography and the setting is quite beautiful.
I:8888;111;The theme song is unforgettable.
I:8888;112;The actors all did a wonderful job.
I:8888;113;I have loved The Piano since I saw it in the theater in 1993.
I:8888;114;ray and the results are wonderful.
I:8888;115;the stereo sound mix has excellent clarity with dialogue and sound effects.
I:8888;116;i highly recommend the blu.
I:8888;117;Her one solace is a piano, which she plays well.
I:8888;118;But he wants something from her in return .
I:8888;119;As a heroine, Hunter is more a freak and social outcast.
I:8888;120;The movie is poetic and sensual, but at the expense of all reason.
I:8888;121;This is a hauntingly somber movie, and that's precisely why I enjoyed it so much.
I:8888;122;there were some brilliant performances in this movie.
I:8888;123;Though Anna Paquin's character only plays a small part in moving the story along, her screen presence is extraordinary.
I:8888;124;She was one of the youngest actors to ever win the Academy Award, and her Oscar was much deserved.
I:8888;125;Holly Hunter also won an Oscar for this movie, and it, too, was well deserved, especially considering the fact that she didn't utter a single word for the entire movie.
I:8888;126;The tantrums that he throws are very realistic and incredibly compelling.
I:8888;127;also worthy of mention is the movie's incredible art direction and cinematography.
I:8888;128;But you can draw your own conclusion.
I:8888;129;This is an excellent movie, and I highly recommend seeing it.
I:8888;130;I have seen this film many times, and love it more with each viewing.
I:8888;131;A friend suggested I try this movie.
I:8888;132;i found it on Amazon of course.
I:8888;133;loved it!Very few words needed to convey a ton of emotions.
I:8888;134;I loved Holly Hunter in Saving Grace , so I went searching for movies in which she starred.
I:8888;135;He has dozens of men working for him, but leaves the piano on the beach in the surf because he can't be bothered, it seems.
I:8888;136;During this we see Harvey Keitel graphically nude and Holly Hunter topless.
I:8888;137;Add endless overcast skies (wonderfully filmed, however) and finally we see Holly Hunter's character basically choosing to go overboard from a canoe.
I:8888;138;Interesting, not what I expected.
I:8888;139;"movies were created I imagine, for us ordinary folk to escape for a couple of hours
I:8888;140;I believe The Piano provided us that service.
I:8888;141;He is very patient with her till the end when he breaks in anger.
I:8888;142;They shared the enjoyment of each others bodies.
I:8888;143;she was very good, but one little girl doesn't a great movie make!
I:8888;144;But if you're an artist (singer, dancer, painter, musician, etc.), your adultery rises to heights of spiritual poetry!
I:8888;145;"I have to begin by stressing that ""The Piano"" is a really well."
I:8888;146;Now, after quite some wait, this magnificent film is available in its Blu.
I:8888;147;And what a delight to the eyes it is!Holly Hunter plays Ada McGrath, a mute woman who moved to New Zealand, with Flora (Anna Paquin), her young daughter.
I:8888;148;This breaks Ada's heart, for the piano is her most valued material possession.
I:8888;149;Enter George Baines (Harvey Keitel), one of Alistair's workers at the plantation, who goes to the beach, picks the piano, carries it with some guys through the jungle, and takes it to his house.
I:8888;150;This action makes Ada happy, but George takes advantage of the situation, by telling her that she can have the piano back if she teaches him how to play it.
I:8888;151;The Piano is a beautiful movie to watch.
I:8888;152;"It has lush cinematography by Stuart Dryburgh
I:8888;153;her charm is just mesmerizing.
I:8888;154;(Australia / New Zealand, France, 1993, color, 120 min).
I:8888;155;Good love story, acting wasn't the tightest.
I:8888;156;A piano as metaphor for repressed emotions .
I:8888;157;The Piano is beautifully eerie where less is more.
I:8888;158;It is dark yet sexy.
I:8888;159;The Piano won the Palme D'Or at Cannes, making Jane Campion the first woman ever to win the prestigious award.
I:8888;160;She also captured an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay at the 1993 Oscars, while also being nominated for Best Director.
I:8888;161;Holly Hunter and Anna Paquin both won Oscars as well, and it was also nominated for Best Picture, Costumes, Editing, and Cinematography.
I:8888;162;So good luck to my female friends in the competition.

I:8888;165;He sees that the piano is the key to her heart, so he has it tuned and signs up for piano lessons, a thin pretext to try and seduce her.
I:8888;166;I don't want to spoil the ending, but you can see that we are headed for a showdown.
I:8888;167;"though the director had a not very well hidden agenda, and was a bit heavy handed with the symbolism, it succeeds as art due to the excellent performances by Hunter and Pacquin, who both won Oscars
I:8888;168;She is the second youngest person ever to win an Oscar, and she totally deserved it.
I:8888;169;Her character was very complex and nuanced, yet she never missed a beat.
I:8888;170;flora: One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere.
I:8888;171;Pacquin, being 11, had little trouble acting like a child, but her uncommon sophistication was quite rare and very uncommon indeed.
I:8888;172;Edna, the protagonist, is the wife of a successful businessman, L once.
I:8888;173;She meets Robert Lebrun, who is the son of the woman who manages the cottages on Grand Isle, and begins to fall passionately in love with him.
I:8888;174;what I find interesting is that both the novel, The Awakening, and The Piano were met with the same kind of criticism.
I:8888;175;Yet, The Piano won three Oscars, and was nominated for five others.
I:8888;176;ada: George has fashioned me a metal finger tip, I am quite the town freak which satisfies!
I:8888;177;these 2 words is enough to explain that how a piano film idea could be really interesting than the others.

I:8888;180;especially since he denies her, her beloved piano.
I:8888;181;This sets off a chain of events, as the piano is the key to unlocking Ada's heart.
I:8888;182;and his superb acting I might add.
I:8888;183;"even in the buff
I:8888;184;Many of them I give credit to in fact, since they saved Ada from the sea.
I:8888;185;as a fellow pianist, I found the piano music as beautiful as the piano itself.
I:8888;186;So, if it was a happy ending for George, Ada, and Flora, yippee!
I:8888;187;It's beautifully shot, realistically grubby and the violence is not at hair out of place for the period or for modern New Zealand (on a spiritual if not Once Were Warriors level).
I:8888;188;Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel, Sam Neill and Anna Paquin were all stupendous.
I:8888;189;campion here presents us with a wonderfully expatriate view of New Zealand as it was, and to her credit, uncovers many of the dirty secrets in the NZ psyche.

I:8888;192;us set of understandings of NZ both past and present that you can find in any pub or wine bar in any part of the country on a Friday night.
I:8888;193;this historical elision is actually important because it provides a way for white people to be the sole group at the center of the movie and ignores the fundamental inter.
I:8888;194;It is the quintessential Euro.
I:8888;195;What this movie shamelessly replicates is a Kiplingesque story of plucky European triumph over the native landscape (and the Philistine colonists as well to be sure .
I:8888;196;Holly Hunter's character finds true love in a restored genteel setting without any thought to the costs paid by the native people.
I:8888;197;I liked this movie because it shows how love can occur without words.
I:8888;198;It also has beautiful piano music.
I:8888;199;I also liked Holly Hunter she is such a good actress.
I:8888;200;Try it you'll like it.
I:8888;201;"I think Jane Campion, the director of the excellent ""Angel at My Table"", to be an important director, and this her finest work."
I:8888;202;It was the first movie that I had ever seen, and lord knows I have seen thousands, that I thought of as a truly great work of art.
I:8888;203;Up until that time, 1993, the best movie I had ever seen, and now, in 2006, I would still have to think hard to come up with a better one.
I:8888;204;The score must almost be considered an additional character, it was so haunting and memorable.
I:8888;205;"And like this year's ""Brokeback Mountain"", a story of repressed emotions."
I:8888;206;Jane Campion is extremely talented .
I:8888;207;she uses lush colors, beautiful natural scenery and a 19th century New Zealand ambience to make a very entertaining film.
I:8888;208;The main protagonists are depicted in depth .
I:8888;209;the heroine, Aida's psyche is revealed fully to the audience.
I:8888;210;What I find particularly impressive is that Campion not only directed the movie, but also wrote the story.
I:8888;211;I enjoy PERIOD films so, with a writer/director and cast, such as these, I KNEW I would NOT be disappointed.
I:8888;212;I believe over half of the film's staff were female as well.
I:8888;213;Anna Paquin, Harvey Keitel, Holly Hunter and the rest of the Staff are PHENOMENAL!!!
I:8888;214;She plays a piano and disses this guy she is arranged to marry.
I:8888;215;old film must surely be well.
I:8888;216;known, let me say that The Piano, one of my favorite movies, is a unique production whose makers went out of their way to truly give it the appearance of the mid.
I:8888;217;It strolls forward with an anti.
I:8888;218;modern slowness in order to accentuate the unspoiled scenery of New Zealand, and successfully bring certain moments to prominence with a pace that matches that of the pre.
I:8888;219;The plot of The Piano is highly unusual, even unique.
I:8888;220;For filmmakers to have accomplished the release of a tale concerning a woman of the 1800's, who went from Scotland to the most remote of British colonies in order to marry a stranger, for this woman to be one whose self.
I:8888;221;imposed muteness is compensated by her lovely playing of a piano.
I:8888;222;i'm daunted by the courage of those who brought The Piano into reality.
I:8888;223;For the wealth of feeling in its story, for its setting, for its cast and for its sheer brave inimitability, it is a fine motion picture.
I:8888;224;This was a very interesting movie.
I:8888;225;The ending had an interesting twist.
I:8888;226;I owned this movie in VHS.
I:8888;227;This is a great story, centering around Ada, a woman that is mute and her daughter played by the talented Anna Paquin (now an X Men heroine).
I:8888;228;Holly Hunter and Anna Paquin won Oscars for their roles and Harvey Keitel gives a performance that is Oscar worthy as well.
I:8888;229;The music, the scenery and the acting all blend together perfectly making a movie that is appealing to all your senses.
I:8888;230;A very good film and well worth adding to your collection.
I:8888;231;It received several Oscar nominations, including Best Picture.
I:8888;232;The plot of a mute woman, Ada, whose only form of expression is through her piano was written beautifully.
I:8888;233;Jane Campion's Oscar winning efforts express her highly creative outlook in film.
I:8888;234;It combines drama, mystery, and romance.
I:8888;235;It reminds the audience of the danger that certain characters are in, regardless of what they say or do.
I:8888;236;The cinematography and the editing wonderfully contribute to this effect.
I:8888;237;the art design proves that the artists researched the European styles of the 1800's.
I:8888;238;The costumes were equally wonderfully crafted.
I:8888;239;Every detail on the set contributes to the movie plot, adding its necessary theme.
I:8888;240;every actor performs their roles beautifully.
I:8888;241;Holly Hunter's Best Actress Oscar winning role, Ada, was highly emotional.
I:8888;242;Only one other performer has won the Oscar for a lead role for playing a mute person(Marlee Matlin, 1986).
I:8888;243;She never holds back a drop of heart and soul through her character.
I:8888;244;This is her best role in her career.
I:8888;245;Anna Paquin's Best Supporting Actress Oscar winning role, Ada's daughter Flora, is amazing.
I:8888;246;This made her the second youngest Oscar winner for acting efforts(age 11).
I:8888;247;No words can describe how amazing and how underrated she is.
I:8888;248;Her European accent is as flawless as her acting.
I:8888;249;Harvey Keitel offers his own mystery theme in his Oscar nominated role as Ada's gothic non.
I:8888;250;Sam Neill's role as Ada's wife is brilliant.
I:8888;251;His character's rage scenes are perfect.
I:8888;252;All other actors, major or minor, also perform their roles wonderfully.
I:8888;253;The Piano offers an amazing roller coaster ride, though some scenes may become highly depressing.
I:8888;254;This offers high emotions that forces the audience to feel what that characters are feeling.
I:8888;255;Many viewers will be entertained throughout.
I:8888;256;Many have watched this ten times, and they continue to discover new, interesting details.
I:8888;257;The Piano will be a classic in the upcoming years.
I:8888;258;This is simply the best movie I have ever seen.
I:8888;259;Special thanks to the man who made this movie absolutely astonishing, Michael Nyman.
I:8888;260;This movie contains the very best love scene and single scene, possibly best ending as well in the world.
I:8888;261;First of all,I saw this movie recently again (albeit, grudgingly) and still did not like the subject of the film, but I do have to say that the acting was excellent and I give Jane Campion credit for presenting this story on screen in a unique and stylized way.
I:8888;262;It's nice to know that times have progressed.
I:8888;263;excellent performance by Hunter and supportive actors .
I:8888;264;a deep and touching drama .
I:8888;265;compelling love story as well .
I:8888;266;explores the world of music and deafness in times past .
I:8888;267;compelling to watch matched by a warm ending .
I:8888;268;Holly Hunter's performance was great and surprisinngly, it ended just like I wanted it too.
I:8888;269;I just watched it on video (rather reluctantly) and I loved it.
I:8888;270;And the joy of expression that can come when one person really touches another.
I:8888;271;Fabulous photography, very surprising and enlightening movie about how women once (and probably still have to) endure in order to survive.
I:8888;272;however a wonderful story about survival, the 'chance' of life and how love and life can be found again.
I:8888;273;A great movie to watch with other women and then discuss .
I:8888;274;This is a powerful movie with a superb cast.
I:8888;275;If you want to feel good watch the older movies.
I:8888;276;It has an unusual story to it.
I:8888;277;I received the video in a timely manner, and it was just what I wanted.
I:8888;278;It was in great condition and an asset to my video library.
I:8888;279;Thank you and it was a pleasure doing business with you.
I:8888;280;When I first saw this film several years ago, I was disturbed by it.
I:8888;281;she had no choice to marry Mr. Stewart, so she simply has to make the best of it.
I:8888;282;She is amazing in it!Ada's daughter often translates and is a spokesperson for her mother.
I:8888;283;She can be adorable, but also wickedly precocious.
I:8888;284;some really beautiful shots are in this next scene.
I:8888;285;Baines may be illiterate, and less cultured than her, but this man is realizing that he has found a beatiful gem in Ada.
I:8888;286;From that time on, he realizes that he must have her heart.
I:8888;287;with which she played the piano.
I:8888;288;this film shows what humanity is capable of sinking to, and then perhaps rising from slightly.
I:8888;289;But who cares!Some reviews say it is beautiful.
I:8888;290;Despite never having heard of this film before, it was excellent.
I:8888;291;Plot, screenplay, and acting were deserving of it's awards.
I:8888;292;I can see why Holly Hunter won an Oscar for this movie.
I:8888;293;it's a brillant movie.You have to see this.
I:8888;294;I was impressed all around by this beautiful and delightful film.
I:8888;295;The scenery is dazzling, as is the acting, particularly Holly Hunter's.
I:8888;296;The film is at many angles about the human condition, determination, and the depths of human passion, all said through a chapter in the life of a woman, young and a mother as well, whose love for a piano recognizes no boundaries.
I:8888;297;Holly Hunter gets hotter with each passing year.
I:8888;298;Now she radiates sex appeal.
I:8888;299;Should be in the 100 best American films list of the IFT.
I:8888;300;I'll stay mute for this.
I:8888;301;"and rapt as well, who would have thought Harvey Keitel could be sooo seductive
I:8888;302;This is one of the most interesting, beautiful, 'out .
I:8888;303;A few years passed, I traveled to New Zealand and even visited Karekare beach where many scenes from the film were made.
I:8888;304;Holly Hunter won an Oscar for her performance, and although I am sure her role as the mute woman was challenging (and she was very expressive), I did not find her role the most interesting.
I:8888;305;More interesting were the roles of the excellent Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel.
I:8888;306;native who falls in love with Hunter's character is clever and sometimes heartbreaking.
I:8888;307;He goes to outstanding lengths to spend time with Hunter, and eventually he gets what he wants.
I:8888;308;Keitel encourages the music while Neill silences it.
I:8888;309;She gives one of the piano keys to her young daughter (played by Anna Paquin, who won an Oscar for her role) to take to Keitel.
I:8888;310;"(The gorgeous soundtrack to the film has a song ""I Clipped Your Wing"" which alludes to this scene."
I:8888;311;The story is both tragic and human, but it is also hopeful and imbued with enlightened performances from all the actors.
I:8888;312;I saw this movie years ago, and it's one that I always remember when I see it, and I've rewatched it more than once.
I:8888;313;It's intense, sensual, violent, dark and memorable.
I:8888;314;Watching it again last night, I realized once more what a wonderful movie it is.
I:8888;315;rich in symbolism, character, excellent acting, and a story so deep and beautiful it won't leave your brain.
I:8888;316;It is a beautiful instrument and from the start of the movie we can see that Ada loves it.
I:8888;317;It is clear she is leaving a part of herself behind.
I:8888;318;it is Bains, the neighbor and friend of Ada's husband who finally grasps the significance of the piano.
I:8888;319;At Ada's insistance, he takes her and her daughter back to the beach so she can play her beloved piano and 'speak' for the first time in days.
I:8888;320;She actually smiles and her movments lose their stiffness and become flowing as she lets the music move through her, saying things impossible to express through words.
I:8888;321;He stays on the beach and listens to Ada play most of the day.
I:8888;322;There is another interesting piece of symbolism at the end of this scene where Ada walks in the wet sand, leaving her footprints behind.
I:8888;323;forshadowing the end of the film in which the three of them will form a family.
I:8888;324;after hearing Ada play, Bains is captivated by her.
I:8888;325;she gradually begins to see him in another light.
I:8888;326;to bring the elusive and aloof woman down to his level so he can love her and give her a chance to love him.
I:8888;327;Throughout the movie it is clear that Bains is deeply moved by every aspect of Ada.
I:8888;328;And it is clear that he understands the significance of the piano because he treats it as an extension of Ada herself.
I:8888;329;In one evocative scene, he takes off his clothes and uses them to polish the richly carved wood of the instrument after Ada has gone.
I:8888;330;He touches the piano with reverence and love, using the same gestures that he later uses with Ada herself when he caresses her body.
I:8888;331;everything soft and feminine and when she does finally yield to Bains with her whole heart, the differnces between them combine to make a deeply sensual scene.
I:8888;332;it is in the love scene that we first see the beginning of the end of the piano.
I:8888;333;Now that Bains has unlocked her voice, we can see that the piano is going to become obsolete.
I:8888;334;And in fact, at the end of the film when she and her daughter are leaving via canoe with Bains, Ada orders that it be pushed overboard.
I:8888;335;She struggles free at the last moment as much to her own surprise.
I:8888;336;She is surprised that her will has chosen to live rather than to die with the piano which now symbolises the stagnant life she is leaving behind.
I:8888;337;at the end of the film we see Ada learning to speak.
I:8888;338;She has grown from a cold, silent woman to a warm and loving one, the change fostered by Bains' love and understanding.
I:8888;339;He has helped her find her true voice and let go of her past though in her dreams she still sees herself tied to the piano which rests at the bottom of the ocean.
I:8888;340;the Piano is a moving and beautiful film, one of my top five favorties of all time.
I:8888;341;absolutely WORTH NOTHING except momentary shock.
I:8888;342;we even fast forwarded it through the love.
I:8888;343;I will never watch it again or recommend it.
I:8888;344;The Piano is a outstanding picture.
I:8888;345;That's a very rare thing in the movies.
I:8888;346;Holly Hunter is unreasonably good here, this is not just a great performance, this is a total embodiment.
I:8888;347;All the actors here, leading and supporting, are flawless.
I:8888;348;All that Campion has done here, from the look of the film, to the setting, and the music, everything all around, this is an experience.
I:8888;349;The Piano is a film I am always recommending, ever since I first saw it.
I:8888;350;Good acting and storyline just a bit of a strange story line and not what I care to watch.
I:8888;351;Loved the beautiful scenery of New Zealand.
I:8888;352;The actors was fantastic, romantic and exotic.
I:8888;353;i have never seen a movie that has had such a profound effect on the people who view it, myself included.
I:8888;354;It is the kind that makes you gasp and keeps you motionless.
I:8888;355;it is much more than that, it is also a story about Ada's love for her Piano.
I:8888;356;The love for her tool to speak.
I:8888;357;the casting for the movie is perfect.
I:8888;358;She simply FEELS, and we can easily see what she is feeling without her showing us.
I:8888;359;Her Academy Award was well deserved.
I:8888;360;anna Paquin, who also recieved an Academy Award for her performance as Ada's mischivous but angleic daughter, is brilliant.
I:8888;361;but Keitel plays his character with warmth, and immediatly you know that Bains knows what he is doing, and you trust him.
I:8888;362;the real supporting cast would also have to be the cinematography and the music.
I:8888;363;Both contribute an intensity to the film that is priceless.
I:8888;364;"Saw it when it first came out and it has worn well
I:8888;365;flic and only good for one viewing.
I:8888;366;The movie is totally engrossing right from the very start to the end.
I:8888;367;Holly Hunter is very effective in giving life to the mute female character.
I:8888;368;She is truly deserving for the Oscar.
I:8888;369;This movie shows the beauty of New Zealand in the midst of a love triangle made rich by actors Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel, Sam Neill and a very young Anna Paquin.
I:8888;370;Even though Steven Spielberg released his magnum opus of Schindler's List in 1993 and walked away with the director's Oscar that year, Jane Campion became only the second woman in Academy history to be nominated for her superior achievement in direction of her work, The Piano, and was perhaps more deserving of the prestigious honor.
I:8888;371;in numerous ways, Campion's direction is more inventive than those who were nominated that year, and more passionate.
I:8888;372;The instrument of the piano and its songs come to serve as the soul of the heroine, Ada McGrath.
I:8888;373;present in the film, the emotion literally drips from every frame of the film.
I:8888;374;This is where Campion most brilliantly succeeds.
I:8888;375;The love which does flow from Ada is a turbulent force, and explores an eroticism not regularly shown in film, nor in a woman, nor in a woman of the late 19th century.
I:8888;376;the film is complimented brilliantly by the superb acting of Oscar winners Holly Hunter and Anna Paquin, along with Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill.
I:8888;377;The sweeping score by Michael Nyman is otherworldly yet soothingly familiar as the compositions lull the viewer into Ada's world and mind.
I:8888;378;This is as flawless as a film can be.
I:8888;379;The Piano is a profound, intelligent, and stunning film.
I:8888;380;see for devoted musicians or anyone with a passion for life.
I:8888;381;The score by Michael Nyman helps make The Piano sound as good as it looks.
I:8888;382;Outstanding performances by a precocious Anna Paquin and an intriguing Holly Hunter.
I:8888;383;This is the kind of movie that will leave you pensive, emotional, and inspired.
I:8888;384;It does, however have a few redeeming qualities, such as the beautiful music and very beautiful scenery, for the setting.
I:8888;385;THE PIANO is a very unusual, enigmatic and haunting film.
I:8888;386;A piano, which Ada has brought with her, is her only means of expression.
I:8888;387;Her looks are riveting and disturbing.
I:8888;388;As the film progresses we see that the primary characters are truly misunderstood from what our initial impressions had ascertained them to be.
I:8888;389;This is an exceptional film that you have to watch and listen to closely because of its very subtle nature that envelops your senses.
I:8888;390;The characters and the actors that portray them are brilliantly presented.
I:8888;391;Stuart Dryburgh's cinematography is equally important because the images on the screen take on a life and spirit of their own in this haunting film.
I:8888;392;One of my all time favorite movies.
I:8888;393;easy to see why Hunter and Paquin won Oscars for their performances.
I:8888;394;Sam Neill was also good as the man who married Hunter as his mail.
I:8888;395;"Harvey Keitel is also excellent as the man who truly got to know Ada(Hunter) and understood her love for her piano, an instrument that gave her a ""voice"" to express her feelings."
I:8888;396;The New Zealand location was excellent, along with the Maori cultural influences.
I:8888;397;Very raw emotions are displayed from beginning to end.
I:8888;398;Like most artsy films, The Piano is a visual experience.
I:8888;399;And, because it's an artsy film, it will be hard for me to explain why I liked it so much.
I:8888;400;As previously stated, the visual aspect of the film is mesmerizing and amazing: it's a great experience.
I:8888;401;"She does what she wants
I:8888;402;As long as that continues to be true, she is still in control of her life, and that makes her a strong character.
I:8888;403;performances are strong as well, especially Anna Paquin's character.
I:8888;404;Holly Hunter as the proud, passionate Ada, Harvey Keitel as the desiring neightbor, and Sam Neil as the sadly pathetic yet pitiable husband, round off the rest of the powerful cast in this powerful movie.
I:8888;405;The content of this film has neither been accomplished so beautifully nor will it ever be!
I:8888;406;If I could offer 10 stars, I would!
I:8888;407;Ms. Hunter's and Mr. Keitel's characters are unique at the very least!
I:8888;408;The uniqueness of some of the scenes definitely stand out in my mind even to this day.
I:8888;409;Hauntingly wonderful would best describe how it left me feeling.
I:8888;410;Enjoy and savour the scenes!
I:8888;411;unlike other criticisms, though, I think the print is actually very good.
I:8888;412;The color is great and the sound is great.
I:8888;413;"ray is far from perfect
I:8888;414;Beautiful movie in all respects.
I:8888;415;One of my all time favorites.
I:8888;416;In my movie archives of must see.
I:8888;417;The piano is my favorite instrument .
I:8888;418;The musical literature has been widely generous with it.
I:8888;419;Since Bach to Mozart , and from Beethoven to Shostakovich , the piano has proved with all the deserved respect to the rest of the instruments the unbeatable king.
I:8888;420;and that special profile that incorporean majesty given through the pianissimos and crescendos makes of it a perfect caleidoscope of sensations and auditive fragancies according the tonal color .
I:8888;421;the piano is one the supreme films of the nineties .
I:8888;422;Conceived as a tribute for the female soul , the movie explores deep laberynths in the soul of a married but unsatisfied woman who only through the music she is friendly about her inners demons and obviously hidden desires .
I:8888;423;the decisive argument for developing a poetic and dazzling script where Holy Hunter plays a superb role and Harvey Keitel shows his unexhaustive actoral powers.
I:8888;424;The locations are really sumptuous with the precise light quantity and the marvelous landscapes working out as an additional actor .
I:8888;425;The dark forest , the unbeatable , the exquisite close ups and one superb script .
I:8888;426;Anna Paquin steals the show and excels among all these giants actors .
I:8888;427;sublime is one common characteristic of the masterpieces .
I:8888;428;This is a very substantial film that delves into the power of exploiting the weakness of a poor marriage by ardent potential lover.
I:8888;429;"This is a highly eroticlove story that developes the charactors and allows you to care for them
I:8888;430;I love everything about this movie.
I:8888;431;The cinematography, the casting, the acting.
I:8888;432;Holly Hunter is very good in this movie.
I:8888;433;Few films of the 90's come close to this one.
I:8888;434;It stars Holly Hunter in a performance which earned her the Oscar and the Best Actress prize at Cannes among many other awards.
I:8888;435;The film is very intelligent and never exploitive.
I:8888;436;The performances are top notch, from Sam Neill to Harvey Keitel to Academy Award winner Anna Paquin, who gives one of the best performances when it comes to a child's acting.
I:8888;437;This film shows how music can become the strongest side of a personality when a woman who cannot talk expresses herself on the keys of a piano : she plays music to live inside herself and to be in harmony with the world and particularly her daughter.
I:8888;438;Married from a distance by her family to an unknown man, she finds he is absolutely negative about the piano, her piano, that will stay on the beach.
I:8888;439;But a neighbor will get the piano, let her play, though his attraction and interest is obviously sexual.
I:8888;440;She will yield to his desire because the piano, the music are bridges between them.
I:8888;441;She has met the man she loves and that love came from her music and her piano.
I:8888;442;What makes it a great film is that it is situated in New Zealand, though the woman's family is English.
I:8888;443;In other words he is a born dominator and has not heard of the ecocultural dimension of life : it is true he lives at the beginning of the colonization of New Zealand and his attitude is that of a colonial settler.
I:8888;444;It is this slow and precise description of the main characters of the film and their relations to the local population that makes the film interesting, not to speak of the acting which is excellent, and has to be so in those constantly refrained and dominated feelings that are at stake.
I:8888;445;What a triumphant piece of pure art !
I:8888;446;Having always loved art movies, The Piano impressed me at a very young age.
I:8888;447;Gifted actors like Holly Hunter and Anna Paquin lights up the screen in a perfect mother and daughter pair.
I:8888;448;Wonderful performance by Harvey Keitel !
I:8888;449;Hunter and Paquin deserves every ounce of their Oscar gold !
I:8888;450;The Piano is an undoubted winner and bound to be cherished by dozens of generations to come.
I:8888;451;I discovered this movie after watching Sophie's Choice and I must say, its a beautiful movie.
I:8888;452;Perfect for watching with your sweetheart.
I:8888;453;This movie will take you through a lot of emotions.
I:8888;454;I will not give anything away, but the acting is outstanding and moving, the story is unpredictable and thought provoking.
I:8888;455;When I had watched this film it literally blew me away: the acting, photography, location, and the music.
I:8888;456;Holly Hunter was spectacular and Anna Paquin well deserved the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1993.
I:8888;457;I recommed this film to anyone, if you are the individual who believes nothing of cinema: Watch it once.
I:8888;458;I watched this movie because of the great reviews.
I:8888;459;I felt this movie was a very good movie, if you like literary type pictures.
I:8888;460;Warriors, a modern day portrait of the Maori, was by far one of the bst films that I've ever had the pleasure to watch.
I:8888;461;I have force fed it to a number of friends and the reaction is either gut.
I:8888;462;It is allegorical, romantic and harsh and beautiful and lovely to listen to and Holly Hunter considers it some of her best work.
I:8888;463;The music and acting are incredible!
I:8888;464;Of course, Holly Hunter won and Oscar .
I:8888;465;The storyline keeps you interested all the way through.
I:8888;466;"But, at least I realize now what Henry Clay said about 170 years ago: ""I'd rather be right than President""."
I:8888;467;The Piano has always been one of my favorite films.
I:8888;468;a story of passion, creative expression, desire, physical and emotional imprisonment, and a LOVE so powerful that it poetically transcends both life and death.
I:8888;469;I'm actually at a loss for words to describe how deeply moving I found this film to be.
I:8888;470;truly a wonderful and powerful film.
I:8888;471;It's in my top ten of all time, and I highly recommend it.
I:8888;472;The story was good and kept my attention.
I:8888;473;"Set in the 19th century, Jane Campion's brilliant period tale ""The Piano"" was rightly lauded in 1993 for its eccentric storyline and otherworldly, dreamlike atmosphere."
I:8888;474;Despite never uttering a word, Oscar winner Hunter exudes intelligence and determination as the rebellious Ada, along with a repressed yet combustible sensuality.
I:8888;475;Anna Paquin is a marvel in her debut, exemplifying the mix of spunk and knowingness that made her a sought.
I:8888;476;"Visually ravishing and exquisite, ""The Piano"" is Campion's visually poetic ode to our unspoken emotions."
I:8888;477;I deeply appreciate the beautiful and intense reviews of this amazing film.
I:8888;478;It has a tragic, beautiful story, acting worthy of the potential of the super people in the cast, and great cinematography.
I:8888;479;"Any guy with ""size issues"" will NOT need to see this, especially with his lady!Otherwise, has something for everyone"
I:8888;480;I know this film was embraced virtually all who saw it and my wife and I were excited to see it based on the reviews and word of mouth buzz, but my we came close to walking out on this film.
I:8888;481;Despite it's obvious popular success, it's hard to see what's so great about it.
I:8888;482;Holly Hunter's portrayal is is achingly painful and Harvey Keitel once again provides a powerful performance.
I:8888;483;Sam Neil is great but the movie is stolen by Holly and Harvey
I:8888;484;"Visually stunning
I:8888;485;this is one of my favorite dramas, ever!
I:8888;486;"Jane Campion's ""The Piano"" does what many truly great films do: It inspires fascinating discussion and provokes mixed reactions."
I:8888;487;the story centers around Ada (Holly Hunter in an Oscar.
I:8888;488;winning performance) and her daughter, Flora (Anna Paquin.
I:8888;489;who also won an Oscar for her extraordinary performance).
I:8888;490;ada's piano, abandoned on the barren New Zealand beach, captures the sense of what 19th century colonial life might have been like for too many women.
I:8888;491;Ada comes to life again as she, at last, gets to play.
I:8888;492;during first of these lessons, Ada strikes her own bargain with Baines, whom she still considers a boor: She will trade sexual favors to earn back her piano, one key at a time.
I:8888;493;campion has filled her movie with haunting piano music (actually played by Hunter) and intriguing imagery.
I:8888;494;I can only see it as a perfect lesson for a sado.
I:8888;495;I saw it once many years ago and I will never do it again.
I:8888;496;How far will you go to get something back (in this case a piano) you love so much.
I:8888;497;outstanding acting and an intruiging beautiful story.
I:8888;498;Very happy I finally found it.
I:8888;499;For a woman of few words, she send a very powerful message.
I:8888;500;All of the actors were so sincere, and yes, the story was familiar, but, it was told and shown in a very unique way.
I:8888;501;My hat is off to Harvey Kietel, one of our most underrated actors in the business today, he was at his best.
I:8888;502;Holly, always good, Anna played her bratty daughter well.
I:8888;503;It's the greatest movie I ever saw.
I:8888;504;This movie is a fantastic piece of work.
I:8888;505;Keitel is great as usual, as is Holly Hunter, who despite not speaking throughout much of the movie, turns in an outstanding performance.
I:8888;506;The young girl is truly great as an actress, and Sam Neill has found the weaknesses and grace of a complex villain .
I:8888;507;The movie earned every bit of acclaim it has received, and then some.
I:8888;508;This is a wonderful movie.
I:8888;509;I really enjoyed watching it and I thought that the silence added more character and made the film even more interesting and emotional.
I:8888;510;The scenes in this movie are very well put together and I thought that their organization helped me understand the film better.
I:8888;511;The ending of the movie is wonderful.
I:8888;512;This story captures sensuality, desire, and love in a very adult movie.
I:8888;513;old Anna Paquin won Best Supporting Actress for playing her spunky daughter.
I:8888;514;this is an unusual and erotic tale with unlikely lovers finding each other in an inhospitable place.
I:8888;515;It is such a unique story and so well made I just love it.
I:8888;516;I thought Harvey Keitel was so convincing that he loved this woman, I cried.
I:8888;517;Then with the beautiful music added, it is one of my favorite movies.
I:8888;518;It is one of the most unique, truly deep, thought provoking, awe.
I:8888;519;inspiring, movies I've seen in a while.
I:8888;520;I was enraptured by the music, the crashing waves, and the amazing synergy between the players.
I:8888;521;Those gangster/tough guy roles just don't even touch this man's talent.
I:8888;522;George Baines is intense, tender, passionate, a total jerk .
I:8888;523;but underneath the gruff exterior lies the heart of a prince.
I:8888;524;It's a risky role and it works for him.
I:8888;525;holly Hunter was spectacular, as usual, but in this film the fast.
I:8888;526;"energy woman you came to know in ""Broadcast News"" or ""Texas Cheerleader Murdering Mom"" must dig deep."
I:8888;527;And one can see clearly that no one is more surprised by her emerging emotions and unfolding events than she.
I:8888;528;and of course, the Piano, the center of it all, Ada's voice, the music in this movie is so moving and expressive, so perfect for each scene.
I:8888;529;achingly beautiful, devastatingly real and dream.
I:8888;530;This movie is a little off the beaten bath, contains strong sexual content, material and nudity.
I:8888;531;It was very moving and excellent acting.
I:8888;532;a story of forbidden love.
I:8888;533;Beautiful romantic story about a hearing mute woman and her arraigned marriage to a cold New Zealander and his friend whom she falls in love with.
I:8888;534;Great view of the 1800's.
I:8888;535;She allows herself to be married off to a man in New Zealand who she evidnetly doesn't like, again we are never told why.
I:8888;536;Playing the piano was an essential female accomplishment in those days, every middle.
I:8888;537;class household had a piano.
I:8888;538;What kind of a woman uses her own daughter as a go.
I:8888;539;I've never thought of Harvey Keitel as sexy or attractive, but he pleasantly surprised me in this over 20.
I:8888;540;She mysteriously stopped talking as a child and uses the piano to communicate her moods and thoughts.
I:8888;541;it's a beautifully filmed, intelligent, erotic, fairy tale.
I:8888;542;like story that has a happy ending (spoiler alert).
I:8888;543;Holly Hunter (Ada, the mute love interest) is a good actress but most of the scenes were eyes darting back and forth.
I:8888;544;she gets a new one later.
I:8888;545;i have seen it several times and am touched every time.
I:8888;546;The Piano is one of my favorite films and living in Quebec I had a hard time finding the widescreen version of the film.
I:8888;547;production it is an outrage to see such a beautiful film with dust all over it.
I:8888;548;although considered wide is actually a 3:4 image letterboxed .
I:8888;549;meaning that you will have a lot fewer lines of image than you would have if it had been transferred anamorphic .
I:8888;550;If you prefer pristine images and great sound .
I:8888;551;The performances of all of the main characters were excellent.
I:8888;552;what a talent, both as an actress and as a pianist!
I:8888;553;it's the kind of movie that leaves the viewer with haunting feelings days after.
I:8888;554;The story is excellent and intriguing and the actors bring out the characters beautifully.
I:8888;555;Holly Hunter, who won an Oscar for this role, does very well in a role that requires no lines.
I:8888;556;She acts with her face and with her body and the her silence transcends the normal realm of communication.
I:8888;557;man, struck the perfect balance between his macho masculinity and the true depths of George Baines.
I:8888;558;Jane Campion's directing is beautiful and the whole film reflects that.
I:8888;559;Best movie ever, no doubt!
I:8888;560;Even a child so talented, she worth an Academy Award!
I:8888;561;I love, love, love this movie.
I:8888;562;It is my favorite movie of all time.
I:8888;563;It's kind of a strange, melancholy kind of setting with some unusual twists and turns.
I:8888;564;A person who watches this movie without an understanding of the thoughts and emotions of a musician will not ever comprehend the numerous layers of emotion that this movie presents.
I:8888;565;( The playing is beautifully played by Holly Hunter) One man understands these feelings while another does not have a clue about what the piano means to the woman.
I:8888;566;I understand that totally because my words will never describe how wonderful this movie is.
I:8888;567;I am an aspiring interpreter ASL and this movement was intriguing in every presentation.
I:8888;568;Will you have a play as well.
I:8888;569;Harvey Keitel astounds with a notable dramatic performance where he's not a thug.
I:8888;570;Deserving of every award it received.
I:8888;571;I was enthralled that this always handsome and appealing man was cast as such a hard to like character .
I:8888;572;great tension in his presence.
I:8888;573;An ambitious undertaking for any actor, yet her 'script' interpretation soared through her eyes, her face, her hands and her musical delivery of the score.
I:8888;574;She absolutely devoured this role.
I:8888;575;The story line is somewhat interesting and good acting, just had a hard time staying awake
I:8888;576;The Piano is a heavy drama that is filled with splendid performances and an awesome score.
I:8888;577;Holly Hunter deservedly received the Oscar for her convincing portrayal of Ada.
I:8888;578;Ada floating above her piano at the bottom of the dark and silent sea is quite haunting and peaceful to see.
I:8888;579;I enjoyed Campion's effective imagery, which was often striking, and the performances, but the central theme of this film .
I:8888;580;enjoy the imagery, but take the message with a grain of salt.
I:8888;581;Even the master print will show that.
I:8888;582;This Drama is not a winning one in my book.
I:8888;583;I have seen this movie many times, and nothing moves and inspires me more than The Piano.
I:8888;584;Such drama, love, lust, and emotion.
I:8888;585;It was outstanding in 93 and it is still a moving film.
I:8888;586;That Piano was definitely one of the best films of 1993.
I:8888;587;The performances from the cast were spellbinding.
I:8888;588;Holly Hunter certainly deserved the Best Actress Ocsar she earned for this performance.
I:8888;589;Even though she doesn't speak a work throughout the entire movie, l got every emotion from her hands, face and her playing of the piano.
I:8888;590;Which leads my into the film's dramatic score which was both haunting and dream.
I:8888;591;That is quite the feat in itself if you ask me.
I:8888;592;Anna Paquin would go one to win the Oscar for best supporting actress at only the tender age of 11.
I:8888;593;I highly recommend this tale of love, sex, betrayal and consequences.
I:8888;594;One of the best movies I have ever seen is Jane Campion's The Piano.
I:8888;595;At first she detests the idea, as she has everything since she moves to the island.
I:8888;596;overs, this is her finest performance ever, winning her the Best Actress Oscar for 1993.
I:8888;597;Anna Paquin also takes an Oscar for Best Suporting Actress.
I:8888;598;The film also won an Oscar for Jane Campion's screen play, and was nominated for Best Picture of the year as well as several others.
I:8888;599;Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel were equally impressive for their roles as well.
I:8888;600;Michael Nyman's music is beautiful with its lovely saxophone melodies and a piano theme song that Hunter actually plays.
I:8888;601;it is perfect in many ways and is a movie that should be in everyones well.
I:8888;602;It is one of those movies that you will want to watch at night all snug in your bed with some popcorn.
I:8888;603;It is just that good.
I:8888;604;One of the best love stories ever viewed.
I:8888;605;I have certainly made the best decision.
I:8888;606;Anyone who is an incurable romantic such as myself will also find pleasure in this colorful, exotic and extremely human story.
I:8888;607;The characters are of ordinary individuals but from another time and culture but the truth revealed is universal in any time, language or people.
I:8888;608;If you are seeking entertainment, romance, exotic beauty and an escape to another era, then this movie will delight you and you will be left wanting more but satisfied that you had partaken in the experience.
I:8888;609;The wild nature of New Zealand in the period portrayed is so evocative.
I:8888;610;Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel are amazing together.
I:8888;611;anna Pacquin, as a child, gives an Oscar winning portrayal as Holly's daughter.
I:8888;612;"repeat, nothing, positive about her at all except that she does a fantastic Harpo Marx imitation
I:8888;613;The story was very human and kept my interest.
I:8888;614;I would recommend it to some of my friends, if they are open minded.
I:8888;615;Oh well, that's how it is.
I:8888;616;Its only saving grace is the beutiful cinematography of New Zealand's untamed wilderness and a strong performance by Harvey Keitel.
I:8888;617;Spare yourselves the irritation: watch a Discovery special on New Zealand, put it on mute, and listen to Chopin or Schubert and you'll have a much better movie that you can also properly title The Piano .
I:8888;618;This movie has touched my soul.
I:8888;619;I cannot tell exactly why, but I 've seen it 4 times, and still want to see it again.
I:8888;620;she has such strong expressions in the melodies she played, and her eyes, her movement.
I:8888;621;This is a good movie, It will be remembered .
I:8888;622;You have to be a special kind of person for you to benefit from this movie.
I:8888;623;The acting is marvous, the story is the best, the acting in this movie makes it all come together.
I:8888;624;the instrument that conveys her emotions and passion.
I:8888;625;It is much deeper than that.
I:8888;626;It is actually the symbol for Ada's sexuality.
I:8888;627;But then, she realizes, Baines' love is pure and sincere.
I:8888;628;flora was able to see through her mother's guile precisely because she has an innocent heart, still not comprehending a woman's power over men.
I:8888;629;except the love, if there was ever love.
I:8888;630;Thank God it is fiction!
I:8888;631;I now see Harvey Keitel and Holly Hunter in a new light.
I:8888;632;The movie was beautiful and stirring in so many ways.
I:8888;633;While dream like, there is an great realness to the beautiful love that develops in a non.
I:8888;634;I have to own this movie so that I can periodically view this special story.
I:8888;635;"It's a kind of ""classic"" movie."
I:8888;636;The story is intense and delicate at the same time.
I:8888;637;Great interpretation from well known actors.
I:8888;638;Great music also, of course!
I:8888;639;my favorite movie of all time .
I:8888;640;Her muteness seems to have widened her already wide eyes, and raw New Zealand fills them, and us, with wonder.
I:8888;641;The movie is one of the must watch movies and you should definitely watch it.
I:8888;642;I loved this movie so much.
I:8888;643;this is one of the ugliest movies I have ever viewed., Nothing of beauty in it whatsoever.
I:8888;644;I found no enjoyment in watching it at all.
I:8888;645;This movie in my estimation in no way is the equal of The Pianist, which is a superlatively exceptional movie.
I:8888;646;I agree with all the interesting and insightful comments that people have offered about this astonishing film.
I:8888;647;One of the rare masterpieces of American Cinema, The Piano stands among the most memorable movies I've ever seen.
I:8888;648;A fortunate cast with Paquin.
I:8888;649;keitel, an intriguing original screenplay combined with brilliant director's work are bringing this movie towards the peak of artistic cinematography.
I:8888;650;The image of human greatness it suggested will stay in my mind as long as I live.
I:8888;651;Beautiful and brilliant are the words that come to my mind for this movie.
I:8888;652;The music still haunts me.
I:8888;653;The ocean, the music, the rain and the forest, one does feel it all.
I:8888;654;The movie is an amazing emotional rollercoaster ride.
I:8888;655;This movie by a women director explores women's perspective in relationships in such a musical, passionate, beautiful fassion that it takes your breath away.
I:8888;656;The cold woman is unlocked by the gentle, strong, primitive man, dumping the piano overboard symbollizes her ability to talk again, to respond sexually.
I:8888;657;awakening in her the desire to love and the passion to embrace life again.
I:8888;658;"imposed exile is an interesting psychological twist
I:8888;659;"But regardless of the ""controversial"" aspects of the story: ""THE PIANO"" remains a completely original, gorgeously filmed work that is brought to life by a first."
I:8888;660;"rate cast
I:8888;661;NUDITY/SEXUAL REFERENCES: about 11 scenes including full.
I:8888;662;"cONTENT RATING: Although a great film from a humanistic/psychological viewpoint: the fact remains that ""THE PIANO"" has some very shocking scenes of nudity and raw, simulated sex."
I:8888;663;grinding, and slurping away: it's safe to say that most Spirit.
I:8888;664;aCADEMY AWARDS: Best Actress (Holly Hunter), Best Supporting Actress (Anna Paquin), Best Original Screenplay (Jane Campion)ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS: Best Picture, Best Director (Jane Campion), Best Cinematography (Stuart Dryburgh), Best Editing (Veronika Jenet), Best Costume Design (Janet Patterson)GOLDEN GLOBES: Best Actress (Holly Hunter)GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINATIONS: Best Picture, Best Director (Jane Campion), Best Supporting Actress (Anna Paquin), Best Original Score (Michael Nyman), Best Screenplay (Jane Campion)
I:8888;665;A film of circumstance and deeply held passions.
I:8888;666;A passion for music and her piano is what keeps a mute woman sane and music is how she expresses herself.
I:8888;667;Jane Campion wrote, ( Academy Award for Best Screenplay), and directed, (nominated for Best Director), this fine film which was nominated for Best Picture.
I:8888;668;Holly Hunter gives a moving, Academy Award winning Best Actress performance as Ada, the mute pianist whose father has arranged for her to marry a man from the remote New Zealand wilderness that she has never met.
I:8888;669;The outstanding performances are what make this movie.
I:8888;670;Harvey Keitel did a spot on Scottish accent with a strong, passionate performance.
I:8888;671;Sam Neill gives a strong performance as the suffering husband.
I:8888;672;The stunning cinematography completes the package for this truly amazing film.
I:8888;673;"One more comment, the movie is rated R for ""moments of extremely graphic sexuality."""
I:8888;674;i loved many things about this movie.
I:8888;675;the story itself, the scenery and cinematography, the all.
I:8888;676;but my favorite part was to see Harvey Kietel shine in something other than a gangster movie.
I:8888;677;Kietel is one of the great underappreciated actors of his generation.
I:8888;678;In some ways this was a tough movie to watch, but it definitely holds your interest.
I:8888;679;The acting is very good, with each of the three main characters (Holly, Sam and Harvey) really creating their character.
I:8888;680;So she leaves England for New Zealand with her 8 year old daughter and her most prized possession, a piano.
I:8888;681;Then right after they get to their new home, Sam leaves for a while to take care of some of his business.
I:8888;682;after a little while in the house where she lives, Holly gets Harvey Keitel to take her back to the beach and she spends the day playing the piano.
I:8888;683;The best part of the movie is seeing Holly's her beautiful body.
I:8888;684;there are a few scenes that are tough to watch, but at least the movie ends reasonably well.
I:8888;685;I liked the unusual love story between Baines and Ada, but found the story of the movie odd.
I:8888;686;What a complete masterpiece of film art!
I:8888;687;I just saw this for the first time in a film class I'm taking.
I:8888;688;While I wish I saw it in a high.
I:8888;689;end projection system presented it very beautifully.
I:8888;690;The cinematography is truly wonderful.
I:8888;691;up, costumes and casting were exquisite, as well.
I:8888;692;love] scenes look like a live recreation of an actual Michelangelo painting.
I:8888;693;well everything is just lovely.
I:8888;694;The movie is a lovely illustration of how the power of music can be used to communicate, and or feed the soul.
I:8888;695;After viewing this film more than a few times, I asked myself why I enjoy this film so much.
I:8888;696;pacquin and Hunter's chemistry and acting are impecable and the film deserves a positive review for this reason alone.
I:8888;697;"The ironic line that delivers it all perfectly for me is when Sam Neil(Stewart)in trying to locate his wife asks Anna Pacquin(Flora)where her mother has gone, The frustrated little girl, who has learned too much about adult relationships yells ""TO HELL!"""
I:8888;698;She clearly emerged from her cultural heritage to become one of the world's premiere female directors.
I:8888;699;campion's films typically have a treacherous terrain of searing emotional intensity.
I:8888;700;Her work signifies a break with the tragic, the Gothic and the sentimental.
I:8888;701;her exquisite film which won three Academy Awards including one for Campion's screenplay, is not about sex, but about passion.
I:8888;702;jane challenges the viewer on many levels.
I:8888;703;Her film (literary inspired from 'Wuthering Heights') explores new territory in the delicious handling of female sexuality and pleasure with the ecstasy of a loving relationship.
I:8888;704;in one scene Ada, with tears of anger, hits Baines hard across the face, as if she has spoken words of love.
I:8888;705;With each new breath, with every moment that their eyes remain locked together, the promise of intimacy is confirmed and reconfirmed and detailed.
I:8888;706;Campion's scenes shows Baines' face crumpling with the exquisite pain of his pleasure.
I:8888;707;Ada moving his head to her chest, and Baines struggling through her dress anxious to touch her skin.
I:8888;708;nominated for eight Academy Awards, the film tells the story of Ada, a strong willful 19th.
I:8888;709;campion manages to chose a cast to suit her purpose and style.
I:8888;710;language translated by her young daughter Flora, and through her beloved piano which happens to be the prime source of her expression.
I:8888;711;She takes great delight in feeling her fingers on her piano's keys.
I:8888;712;He seems satisfied to watch.
I:8888;713;He finds himself edging irresistibly closer, magnetically drawn to the spectacle.
I:8888;714;baines enjoys her fingers moving on the keys and the small details of motion on her face.
I:8888;715;Twice he closes his eyes and breathes deeply.
I:8888;716;He is experiencing a strange sense of appreciation and lust.
I:8888;717;He is jealous of it.
I:8888;718;His attention finally focuses on her neck as it bends further or closer to the piano.
I:8888;719;Ada's long white neck proves irresistible.
I:8888;720;There's a way you can have your piano back.
I:8888;721;'Anna Paquin has been proclaimed one of the best child acting roles ever.
I:8888;722;She gives a subtle and complex performance as the very cute little girl torn between her mother and stepfather.
I:8888;723;Her complex portrayal of Flora won her the Best Supporting Actress.
I:8888;724;sam Neill plays the intense, moralistic and very.
I:8888;725;There are sounds inside which are worrying him.
I:8888;726;jane Campion creates an unusual film, poetic and lyrical, complimented by a beautiful cinematography of the haunting woods, which by many critics has been named as a masterpiece.
I:8888;727;She is the first female director to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes.
I:8888;728;This is a great movie.
I:8888;729;provoking, this is a great pick.
I:8888;730;This is the first film I have seen with Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel.
I:8888;731;They both gave good performances, and the movie itself was strange but likeable.
I:8888;732;Anna Pacquin and Sam Neil also gave great performances.
I:8888;733;The cinematography was good and the setting was a cool, dark, but beautiful place.
I:8888;734;I recommend this for romantic buffs, and people who love to watch great performances.
I:8888;735;Listening to her voice, being moved by it, is the key to the entire film.
I:8888;736;one of the several engaging themes is that of who is on center stage at any given time.
I:8888;737;one endangering her sense of self while simultaneously using and liberating her, the other denying her self.
I:8888;738;it's a very fine movie for those of a mind to listen.
I:8888;739;Outstanding movie, and the academy award the little girl won for it was well deserved.
I:8888;740;Watched this for the first time a few weeks ago as I am a huge Sam Neill fan.
I:8888;741;Excellent film about the complexity of a widow (who is mute) who becomes a new bride and who cannot relate to her new husband.
I:8888;742;She learns over time to relate to her male neighbor who requests piano lessons from her.
I:8888;743;developed period film set in New Zealand with striking photography and plot.
I:8888;744;The usual fare is the interactions between two urbanites with huge polished smiles stuck to their faces.
I:8888;745;They enter a relationship which is loud, giddy, and giggly.
I:8888;746;but here, just once, the quiet, patient, and tender man emerges with the lady.
I:8888;747;i found this to be an incredibly beautiful story and as if that alone wasn't good enough, I also greatly enjoyed the cinematography and the music.
I:8888;748;This is one of those films that I find guilty of being incredibly good on all counts.
I:8888;749;and a final note about male nudity: Yes it is in this film.
I:8888;750;It was interesting in seeing how many places the piano had been and who was playing the piano.
I:8888;751;If anyone is an Anna Paquin fan, it is great to see her as an extremely talented and adorable young girl.
I:8888;752;The costuming was lovely, the style, tone, message and imagery were certainly striking.
I:8888;753;and all of these things cause me to give this highly acclaimed movie three stars.
I:8888;754;The young daughter is probably the most authentic and well.
I:8888;755;acted of all of the characters.
I:8888;756;I deeply respect what the creators of this story were attempting to convey.
I:8888;757;The acting is very good as is the story.
I:8888;758;A great mix of emotions are protrayed and the music is haunting.
I:8888;759;This film gets three stars because it clearly was a wonderful movie for a lot of people .
I:8888;760;including a lot of reviewers here.
I:8888;761;The acting was fine and the movie beautiful, but the story itself left me with the taste of bile in my mouth.
I:8888;762;This is a great movie.
I:8888;763;I'm all about honestly, loyalty, and love for the right reasons so this movie was a complete disappointment to me.
I:8888;764;I own this movie and have watched it many times and have cried many times.
I:8888;765;the passion of the raging storm and the passions raging inside of the actors.
I:8888;766;Which, i believe were very well portrayed by all of the cast.
I:8888;767;I'm sure you've guessed by now that i am a very passionate person and i have a love of music, as well.
I:8888;768;This movied touched me tremendously.
I:8888;769;it portrayed passion to the extreme.
I:8888;770;It was lovely and beautiful in the way it was portrayed.
I:8888;771;If you want to understand the true measure of a persons' loves.
I:8888;772;then i highly recommend owning this movie!!
I:8888;773;This is the best film.
I:8888;774;And the music is so nice.
I:8888;775;If you play piano your self this is the one too see.
I:8888;776;One of the most beautiful and moving films I've ever seen.
I:8888;777;The screenplay, acting, and cinematography make is so.
I:8888;778;and this is one of the things this incredible movie teaches us.
I:8888;779;The Piano is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8888;780;Holly Hunter is brilliant as Ada, the mute (by choice) victim of an arranged marriage.
I:8888;781;Her facial expressions and physical movements express more than words could ever say.
I:8888;782;In fact, I found that once I become aware of watching her gestures, I began watching the expressions of other characters in the movie also.
I:8888;783;The music in the film is beautiful and is Ada's true voice .
I:8888;784;The Piano is a wonderous combination of music, scenery and symbolism.
I:8888;785;It's like a dream sequence.
I:8888;786;The filming of 2 major scenes of violence is exquisite.
I:8888;787;i highly recommend this film.
I:8888;788;Very well acted, it's an excellent movie.
I:8888;789;Paquin shows promise of great things to come as the daughter.
I:8888;790;in the end this is a tale of the redemption of the human spirit as Ada (Hunter) learns to love and trust a man again (albeit not her own husband), her husband finally learns the difference between family and property, and Baines finds his longings fulfilled through his ability to sacrifice satisfaction of his own needs for the safety and happiness of the woman he loves.
I:8888;791;fine performances by all involved, including the supporting cast of transplanted UK eccentrics who give just the right comic touch to a very weighty story.
I:8888;792;a triumph of a film, the ending of which is slightly Chaucrian when Baines learns that the best way to have your way with a woman is to let her have her way first.
I:8888;793;Ada, a voluntary mute since childhood, has always expressed herself through her beloved piano.
I:8888;794;Great cinematography, music, and acting all around.

I:8888;796;She is headstrong and knows what she wants.
I:8888;797;The Piano is truly a hypnotic film.

I:8888;799;Stewart's neighbor George Baines then brings it to his house after much of Ada's pleading and lets Ada play it in exchange for sexual favors.
I:8888;800;this is an extremely intriguing, beautiful, unique romantic drama that all interested in film should definitely check out.
I:8888;801;It is one of my all time favorite movies.

I:8888;803;the writter, the director, and especially Holly Hunter as the mute, talented, beholden, controlled, and emotionally outraged women, produced the most interesting, and emotional portrayal of these human contensions I've ever experienced in print, or film.
I:8888;804;Unfortunatly I've seen these dynamics in life, as most of us have if we are honest.
I:8888;805;the films climax will be one of the most intense of your life, I promise.
