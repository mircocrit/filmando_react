1;Can an extremely realistic portrayal of a football game, directed by no less an icon than Oliver Stone, ever match the sheer joy of an actual NFL game?
2;But I do know this is a very cool movie.
3;It's a good movie, with especially fine performances by Al Pacino (of course) and Jamie Foxx.
4;Plus, many NFL stars for those of us who would notice that sort of thing.
5;ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is more than just one of the best movies made about professional sports, it's the latest installment in Stone's mythic quest to understand the big questions in human relationships, especially between men.
6;Stone portrays these aspects with a female owner, whose character is well.
7;up coach to second wind is the most poignant part of the film.
8;Jim Brown adds authenticity and old school values.
9;margret gives a great cameo performance, one that most wives and girlfriends of football fanatics would understand.
10;the cinematography, however, is brilliant, and also draws on Stone's ground.
11;Like the head cam on Monday Night Football, his jaring, real.
12;time shots capture the variations in speed and calculation that is football, but also conveys the bone.
13;but, Stone also gives his bloodsport a moral underpining.
14;killers, the corporate and media politics, this movie makes football fun.
15;This movie is for fans, and their loved ones, perhaps looking for a reason to understand the allure of football.
16;How does that affect the acting and the intense screenplay and perfectly written script.
17;The plot is a prefect example of the struggles that the modern day NFL goes through.
18;Jamie Foxx, LL Cool J, James Woods, Cameron Diaz, and the legendary Al Pacino all star in this movie and do an excellent job.
19;It's damn crazy when you see how far into the play they really go.
20;Watch the movie and you will see what Im talking about.
21;Just watch how real these hits are.
22;in general, with the huge cast of stars, the great filming style, and the feeling you get of being inside the plays after watching one of the awesome games, this movie gets a 5 stars.
23;In fact I give it 6.
24;And to add on to that, the special features in this film are awesome.
25;OLIVER STONE by now has treated every theme possible about the AMERICAN institutions.
26;aNY GIVEN SUNDAY is a fair movie about that marvelous AMERICAN institution called football.
27;the usual four letter words are present
28;one of the pleasant surprize of this film is the performance of CAMERON DIAZ as the team's owner.
29;I saw this movie at the theater, and my boyfriend wanted to see this so I was nice and saw it with him.
30;It was about love, friendship, and of course football.
31;For the people that do not enjoy football and for people who do enjoy football either way you will like this.
32;It has its moments also where it is also funny.
33;a very technically gifted filmmaker, and this movie is typical of the intensity his work is known for.
34;To say that I enjoyed it wouldn't be quite right, because it's hard to say you enjoy something so reeking with cynicism, but it was nice to see a first.
35;rate cast (and fun football cameos) go through their paces.
36;field injury that was most likely cut because of making the audience laugh at it's raw outrageousness.
37;Oliver Stone lends his directorial prowess to turn an otherwise massively overdone genre into an outstanding movie.
38;The camera work is incredible, and the editing is very well done.
39;And the characters are larger than life, in a way that is believably realistic.
40;In particular, Jamie Foxx's evolution from a timid and shy bench warmer to prima donna star is very well done, and is a particularly effective acting performance on his part.
41;It isn't necessarily a movie for everyone, but I loved it.
42;The actors were great, the story was facinating, and the ending might have been cliched, but I enjoyed it
43;countless football movies have done it better and this Oliver Stone film steals from them all.
44;dimensional offspring of 1000 other roles.
45;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
46;Well put together, the acting excellent and convincing.
47;Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx, Cameron Diaz all very good and fitting in their roles, I didn't foster a big attachment to Dennis Quaid's character, but he was still good.
48;The speach Al Pacino makes in the locker room inch by inch was very moving and adds tremendous feeling that the characters individually are all feeling at that time.
49;This movie would appear the most honest in comment about the American NFL sport and the people who play it.
50;This film actually has a plot, and it's carried out in detail.
51;This film is actually about something.
52;The characters are as large as Roman titans, and very sexy.
53;Myself, I really don't watch sports, but I thought this was a good movie and worth the money.
54;the camerawork is really good.
55;I also enjoyed the montages, reminding me of John Frankenheimer's Grand Prix Cinerama spectacle.
56;Al Pacino is another phenomenon in this movie, and he has one of the best climactic speeches I've seen in some time.
57;Dennis Quaid is good as a Dan Marino.
58;type famous and aged quarterback, and James Woods and Cameron Diaz are really good.
59;The game of American Football is, in many ways, a perfect movie sport.
60;First of all, the game progresses in fits and starts, giving plenty of opportunity for dramatic buildup and suspense.
61;Third, and probably most important, football is a sport that closely resembles an ancient battlefield
62;oliver Stone's ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is certainly an action film.
63;It throws you right on the field in the very first sequence and keeps you there for a good forty minutes of it's near 3 hours.
64;On top of that there's quarterbacks Jamie Foxx and Dennis Quade, Jim Brown, L. l. Cool J, Matthew Modine, and Ann.
65;margaret in a wonderful cameo.
66;now, don't get me wrong, ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is full of fun touches.
67;The performances are uniformly terrific and the action is often spectacular.
68;Of course, all sports films rely on a certain amount of clich 
69;Pacino looks great, not a day over fifty!
70;Heston's influential cameos in the film led Stone to compare the game of football with Greek gladiators by inserting clips of Ben Hur into the film.
71;although much of the film is injected, much like a chicken on a poultry farm, with booming Rap music, clips of LL Cool J, and fictitious commercials to break up the monotony of the nearly three hour movie, the film somehow manages to have a flow.
72;Along with the thought that they manage to stay with the film between all the out takes and multiple conflicts between characters.
73;This film is definitely for a more masculine audience, as women seem to take the back seat and are viewed only as trophies.
74;The reason why Gladiator won an Oscar it was because it was a historical epic, set in the Rman Empire, so that impresses people.
75;The music in the background, constantly there, draws me back again and again.
76;james Woods steals the scenes he's in .
77;LT was amazing, especially in the Steamroom scene .
78;The quarterback, Willie Beaman, played by a comedian was non.
79;Willie is constantly feuding with his coach and just about everyone else.
80;She felt that this Miami team had belonged to her dead father, and she should call the plays.
81;In high school, I saw maybe two of those Cecil played as the extra.
82;So, there are sports in my family.
83;and the red flag on the field added interest.
84;It makes all the difference between winning and losing, living and dying.
85;This was a good movie for its time and well.
86;While this may not be considered a classic, it is a movie I enjoyed very much.
87;It was fun to watch this again.
88;It is a good sports movie and I like sports movies.
89;stylized, but the performance from Jamie Foxx and Al Pacino are outstanding.
90;It's frankly one of the best football movies ever made.
91;He Holds his own in scenes with Al Pacino and Dennis Quaid
92;for the first Two hours of the films Three hour running time, Oliver Stone shows us something we haven't seen before, Behind the Scenes of the NFL.
93;We see the Crooked Doctors, filling the injured players up with drugs to keep them playing.
94;still, if you can forgive these fairly Large Misgivings, there are Great Performances to enjoy.
95;Well, actually, Great Actors to enjoy.
96;Al Pacino, James Woods, Dennis Quaid, Cameron Diaz and Matthew Modine give performances that vary from Brilliant to Bad.
97;Al and James do what is required of them, they Yell a lot and look Fierce.
98;Dennis Quaid gives one of the Better performances, he looks Young and Tough enough to be playing the game, but also Old and Weathered enough to be wanting Out of it all.
99;(What happened to him after Full Metal Jacket) Charlton Heston's Cameo is a great moment, he proves why he is such a legend with about 2 minutes of Screen time.
100;(Oliver Stone's cameo as a Commentator is pretty good to)Jamie Foxx and LL Cool J steal the rug from under the Big named stars and both give Star.
101;The modern day gladiator drama that is football explodes on the screen in all the digital surround glory that is Oliver Stone.
102;Try to spot all of the real.
103;life football hereos such as Johnny Unitas, Jim Brown, LT, and Barry Switzer.
104;One of the few real football movies out there along with Friday Night Lights and some others.
105;Great acting by both the famous actors to the legends of football.
106;Of course Oliver Stone takes some liberties with his film and one should take that into consideration before viewing.
107;But, If you love football then its a must see, if you love good acting I also suggest it.
108;This was truly an excellent film.
109;This movie is Oliver Stone's best since Platoon.
110;moving and dizzying cinemaphotography fits the high adrenaline atmosphere of the professional football world well.
111;The film is also perfectly cast.
112;Pacino gives life to the head coach, and Cameron Diaz's clearly most intense role as the team's owner is believeable.
113;Jamie Foxx has a breakthrough dramatic role as the new hotshot quarterback, whose ritualistic vomiting adds humor to the movie.
114;LL Cool J, also puts through a convincing performance as the team's running back.
115;An outstanding cast, that features Charlton Heston as the football comissioner, and Ann.
116;This is possibly the best sports movie ever made.
117;OK, now i love this movie.
118;I saw it in the movie theater, loved every minute of it.
119;along with every other cool movie i've seen lately.
120;I really enjoyed the movie.
121;It was very entertaining and had a Plot that was easy to follow and understand.
122;I may tend to go for romantic comedies, but I really enjoy watching Al Pacino in action.
123;I can see why movie stars lobby to work with him ~~ he's that good.
124;Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid and Cameron Diaz all were excellent in this movie as well.
125;this is more than a football movie.
126;It shows the depth and range of human emotions tied to a dream.
127;There are some funny moments.
128;It's well worth your time to watch it!
129;There are many better football films out there.
130;I hate football so it was terrible news to hear that a favorite writer and director, Oliver Stone, had made a football movie.
131;As bad, it also featured one of my favorite actors, Al Pacino.
132;Similar to Stone's taking us into the Vietnam War at grunt level, in this film he lets us experience football right out on the field with the players.
133;Cameron Diaz is the very vital yet ruthless team owner.
134;She inherited the team from her father and is going to make it work come hell or high water.
135;As usual, Stone makes the movie a multimedia event and it is cleverly intercut throughout with every medium of expression known in the arts, in absolutely seamless fashion.
136;My husband is not a football watcher either but he adored this movie and would give it a 5, I'm sure.
137;If you are a big football fan, you will probably give it a 5 too.
138;Oliver Stone may be the most overrated director of our generation.
139;They makes some of the best recordings and could give all other sports filmworks a run for their money.
140;She has real veins of steel in this movie and goes toe to toe with Pacino and gives as well as she gets.
141;Their relationship is very stormy and a delight to watch them both.
142;, but he begins to shine and nearly wins his first game for them.
143;Jamie Foxx's performance steals this movie away from all the other high profile actors.
144;He has this intensity that I never saw on his stupid Jamie Foxx show and he has the tools to become a great actor.
145;Just look at his fire at a dinner meeting he has with Pacino.
146;The relationship with Beaman is all politically driven and the pressures on Rooney are intense (especially from his wife, played with icyness by Lauren Holly).
147;Mandrake, apart of the system and paid handsomely for it, is more than happy to oblige.
148;hop and Metallica really intensifies the adrenaline in the picture.
149;i`m an Al Pacino fan and the first reason I wanted to see this movie was him.
150;my second reason of watching this movie was my love to the sport movies.
151;i`ve seen lots of football movies but I have never seen another movie that shows football and the football players` life conditions,the way they live,their fears and their wills so truely and pure.
152;still this is the best football movie ever made.
153;Excellent movie about the determination of people to do what they are meant to and to work as a team to achieve greatness.
154;Stone is clearly a man who understands and loves professional football.
155;There are many scenes of pure elegance and artistry.
156;All the actors and actresses gave strong, believable performances, especially Pacino, Foxx, LT, and Diaz.
157;With touches reminding me of Scorsese, Kubrick, and Tarantino, Any Given Sunday is one of Stone's best.
158;Oliver Stone should be ashamed of himself.
159;It was for a professional purpose and use and the opportunity to be able to receive it at a discounted price as well as with the speed of receipt was important to me.
160;Oliver Stone takes another sharp turn!
161;As the movie progresses, Beamen gets the taste of the real football world
162;Losing his extremely beautiful girlfriend in the process, played by Lela Rochon.
163;What I liked about it was the little humor that was in it every once in a while.
164;The movie continued as the credits rolled by (perfect example would be Wild Things), and I had to admit, the ending was pretty good!
165;winner:Al Pacino) has sacrificed his wife and his children for a Career.
166;margret, LL Cool J, John Mc Ginley and Lauren Holly.
167;This is a familiar film but it`s has energy and some scenes of exciting Football Scenes.
168;I consider myself an admirer of both Stone and Pacino's work.
169;I also consider myslef a knowledgeable football fan, who has played the game at a competitive level.
170;North Dallas Forty was an exceptional picture that finally exposed the horrors of pro football.
171;Jaime Foxx, steals the show as quaterback Willie Beamon, an unambitous third stringer who steps into the starter role and has to deal with the fame of being a starting quaterback
172;Pacino as a football coach didn't really work for me the entire time but I still liked the movie.
173;Oliver Stone likes beating up the people who decide to watchhis movies.
174;There are triple and quadruple angles on charging football players, shots from inside football helmets, crane shots, steadicam shots, and lots of tracking and hand held shots.
175;there are huge booming bangs and mini.
176;why?To excite, titilate, entertain, overwhelm and bulldoze an audience into thinking it's watching an important Oliver Stone movie of course.
177;Lots of characters to introduce us to.
178;Now pardon me while I add some elements to this shot.
179;whelmed with all this stuff, all this detail.
180;there are some great shots in this movie.
181;Well it doesn't lie there exactly because we are always cutting, the camera is always moving.
182;He manipulates every single aspect of what we are watching.
183;Rarely is a shot held for move than a few seconds.
184;He keeps moving but it's over the same territory over and over and over again.
185;Once, twice, three and four times we see similar types of shots of crowds, fans, coaches, players, refs, cheerleaders, people in the press box.
186;but as a prelude to every game we see, even to one of the practices.
187;And of course when a game becomes more important than just a game it means the participants must sacrifice everything real.
188;A very in your face type of movie.
189;i love the idea of a football movie taking the role of more of an action movie, as opposed to a football movie.
190;I think everyone needs a bit of pure action fun every once in a while, and that's what this movie provides.
191;what it all boils down to is a very fun movie that I find myself watching time and time again.
192;On the other hand, Steamin' Willie Beamen (played perfectly by Jamie Foxx) is one of the better characters ever in a sports flick.
193;acts quite a bit (he's been doing that a lot lately), but it's balanced out by great supporting performances and a stellar soundtrack.
194;You can always count on Oliver Stone to have something interesting to say.
195;When his starting quarterback gets hurt (Quaid), Pacino looks to Willy Beaman, played by a surprisingly good Jaime Foxx.
196;cut editing (brilliant during game scenes, excessive in others), to its run time (two and a half plus hours), this modern day gladiator movie balloons with bigness.
197;And by the movie's end, redemption comes all too neatly during the final game (In mythic fashion, the team visits the dragon's lair to battle the Dallas Knights. )
198;If you're a fan of Oliver Stone or a fan of football, Any Given Sunday is worth a look.
199;like watching a real game.
200;I just know that this was a damn good movie.
201;It was interesting from beginning to end.
202;When I saw it in the theatre I didn't want to get up to go to the restroom and once I bought it I had to watch it right away.
203;i thought the action was amazing.
204;i'm a football fan and I enjoyed the hits, the sounds, the views from the players.
205;well I guess that shows how much I enjoyed it because I never noticed that it was any longer than any other film because I was into it from beginning to end.
206;i thought that Jamie Foxx gave a wonderful and believable performance in his role as Willie Beamon.
207;LL Cool J looked like he fit right in with the rest of the cast and I enjoyed the antics of so many of the other characters.
208;LT Taylors performance was great and I had no clue Bill Bellamy had any athletic skills.
209;i found every aspect of the film enjoyable and I have watched it over and over again.
210;If you like lots of on the field action, lots of hits, lots of contact and great acting from the likes of Al Pacino, you will love this film.
211;Any Given Sunday keeps the unmistakable style of Oliver Stone, especially seen in Natural Born Killers, transporting it this time in the new, agitated, full of events world of american football.
212;By his style of play, spectacular, but not caring about the tactics and the schemes, he wins the heart of the fans, but enters in the disgrace of the coach.
213;And he does it in style, with an exceptional movie.
214;Because it's not a movie necessarily about football, but about team spirit, about friendships, joys or troubles, a film with strong characters played by really special actors.
215;A film that will keep your interest at high levels, despite its long runtime, by the fabulous style of Stone, but also by the story, full of events dictated by interests or the rush for money, that many times dims freindships or any bit of morality.
216;You will discover a dirty world, full of interests and passions, far of the beauty observed from outside.
217;Al Pacino is a character caught between the desire of winning every match no matter what and the friendship that ties him with old Rooney, who injures himself at the beginning.
218;Beaman is a young football player, selfish, insensitive, but with an extraordinary talent.
219;He shows us again, one more time, his great talent.
220;By his awesome way of filming, that reminds us of NBK, the fast paced, incredibly real dialogues, or last, but not least, the full of significance inserts with what he feasted our eyes and mind also in NBK, you actually feel that you are a part of this world, that you are really inside it.
221;And the inserts have a special meaning again, especially in the scene of the dialogue between Foxx and Pacino, maybe the best and most significant of the whole movie.
222;A movie added to his impressive collection of masterpieces, of the most varied and original director of our times.
223;to me this was a great movie, i think they should make more movies like this i love sports movies and especially inspirational sports movies its wonderful movie i hope many love it like i do
224;Co. written and directed by Oliver Stone.
225;It shows the true events of a common professional football team.
226;It shows of how friends can turn against each other in the case of greed and it shows things such as the players and coaches opinions of the mass media.
227;It is right there with the play and every sound made and movement is right with you and it shows everyone what it is really like.
228;Pacino does another very convincing and emotional role and Jamie Foxx does fairly decent in one of his non.
229;But, if you understand it's depth and truancy of the sports world, you'll enjoy this.
230;We watch as overpampered football heroes go about their daily lives with such regular routines as chainsawing team mates sports cars and dabbling in sex and drugs.
231;short but informative documentary and for that reason and the game coverage combined with Pacino I give this movie three stars.
232;I saw this movie when it first came out and I must tell you that I think this is a great football movie it has great action and great acting by Jamie Foxx, LL Cool J and Al Pacino.
233;So if you are in the mood for a great football movie then watch this film.
234;Greatest football movie since Varisty Blues.
235;eventually it settled down into a film that we actually enjoy watching.
236;The colors and action is great and a story line even somehow developed.
237;make sure you watch the whole film to catch the end after some of the credits have rolled.
238;The movie's best scene, (I'll admit, my hair stood up on the back of my neck) is Pacino's pep talk right before they take the field in the last game.
239;I love football movies and this is one of the best.
240;This is a movie for guys but a few sportiness women can enjoy this too.
241;Very graphic in some spots.
242;very graphic look at football.
243;i thought the movie was pretty well done and very well acted.
244;It was a great movie and the convenience of watching it at home with just a flick of a button was so nice.
245;Always reminds me its time for some football.
246;All wonderful actors, wonderful storyline and overall a kick start for one of the best sports in the world!
247;Any Given Sunday is a film that everyone love if you're a football fan or not.
248;Oliver Stone direction of the games and actors is some of the best since North Dallas Forty.
249;The cinematography by Andrezj Bartchowizk is very good also.
250;Any Given Sunday has all the elements of a riveting ensemble.
251;the cast is terrific with many good actors.
252;He was so good he should have been nominated for best supporting actor that year.
253;willie Beaman starts off horribly, but gradually improves and becomes the team's star player.
254;But the success goes to his head, and gets under Pacino's skin.
255;But he is winning the games, and (almost) everyone watching likes Beaman, forcing Al Pacino to reevaluate the way he coaches, if winning is more important than teamwork and playing hard.
256;when it comes to the football sequences, the cinemtography is wonderful, this is where Oliver Stone shows his true talent.
257;You feel like you are on the field, especially with the digital sound and great picture that accompanies this disc.
258;LL Cool J also has a music video, and the trailer is also in the bonus feature section.
259;This is my all time favorite movie!
260;It is always moving, giving you insight to the game of Football and of Life.
261;Great acting: Al Pacino delivers a wonderful performance and all the actors play their parts excellent.
262;I do not even like Football, but this movie was great.
263;the film itself is one of my favorite sports films.
264;The film is unapologetic and the characters are raw and fearless.
265;the film is edgy, and hot, visually.
266;Cameron Diaz, Al Pacino and the rest are perfect for this fast.
267;paced film, and their performances are believable and as well cast.
268;definitely worth the upgrade if you're a fan of this flick!
269;Top notch for any movie fan regardless of a favorite genre.
270;i love watching every single actors other movies so, this was a real treat.
271;Oliver Stone has done a masterful job capturing football in it raw essence, while still appealing to the modern pop.
272;Any Given Sunday tops all other sports movies by telling a great story with jsut enough punch to keep auiences interested for the entire 2 1/2 hours.
273;The rich cinema images and bone.
274;crunching sounds are as necessary as they are exciting.
275;football fans should steer clear of this one, but for the rest, Stone has created an brilliant, very exciting cliche.
276;finally, grunting and groaning actually does occur during a game.
277;motion is best used sparingly.
278;This is perhaps one of Oliver Stone's finest directional masterieces recently.
279;but this is just sensational.
280;The script is well crafted, the acting very genuine and the action is vibrant.
281;Having first watched this movie on board an aeroplane, I was anxious to see it again with the full ensemble of home cinema magic and it really paid off.
282;Apart from the movie being excellent, there's enough extra stuff amongst special features to keep you entertained even more.
283;(I recommend the special edition region 1 or region w disc).
284;I may not a film critic but I do appreciate superlative entertainment especially when directed by a genius.
285;This one goes off the scale of Oliver Stone's experimental film.
286;Al Pacino delivers a splendid performance of a driven, obsessed football coach (aren't they all driven obsessed?)
287;the best sports movies end up not being about sports at all, but life.
288;The soliloquy delivered by Jamie Foxx concerning how young men are ripped off by both college and the pro's is alone worth the price of admission.
289;One of Stone's better works .
290;and for a director of his caliber that is truly saying something.
291;ray player, but good deal for a blu.
292;Oliver Stone is a maniac, his movies are stylistic funhouses which showcase just how far one can push film as a stylistic medium.
293;The cast is uniformly excellent, Al Pacino isn't disappointing as he rarely if ever is.
294;Cameron Diaz is amazing as the team owner who can more than act head on with Pacino.
295;Jamie Foxx is very convincing as an arrogant player who begins to reform as the season winds on.
296;All in all, if you have seen this movie, odds are you knew it was directed by Oliver Stone.
297;It is stylistic overkill, but it fits the material so it's successful, the only time style overcomes a story is when the story doesn't warrant the style.
298;Enter the 3rd string guy.
299;and he starts to shine.
300;In the Insider, he is a passionate 60 Minutes producer who convinces Jeffrey Wigand to be a whistlerblower on tobacco companies.
301;It was an interesting look at football and its place in American society.
302;But to see that it warrants this kind of attention is a fascinating thought.
303;It is interesting to see Pacino as a coach who appears to be in the twilight of his coaching career.
304;This has an interesting directorial style, probably because it was directed by Oliver Stone.
305;you can always count on him for something at least a little out of the ordinary.
306;A good, solid film, but by far not the best film Pacino has done nor is it the best film about football.
307;The situation is so tense inside for everyone: the coach (Al Pacino) who often has to face the actual owner's team (Cameron Diaz).
308;He is Willie Beamen, the star who now appears in front page of all sport magazines.
309;i enjoyed it so much because of everything: the exceptional cast, the plot, the marvellous direction.
310;In addition, I liked so the performance by the actors.
311;It shows us the hardness and the inconveniences of football, but also how satisfying is to win.
312;I love sports and sports flicks.
313;With Any Given Sunday, Stone has created his most ambitious tribute to his own megalomania.
314;This film is a classic example of excessive style negating substance.
315;A good director uses innovative technique to enhance the telling of the story.
316;hip the hip generation of directors by providing a staccato progression of weird angles, extreme close.
317;Ironically, Stone failed to learn the lesson learned by Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx) in the story
318;it is a pity, because buried beneath all this decadent directorial tripe, there was a good sports story and some terrific acting.
319;al Pacino gave a great performance as the legendary coach past his prime, who let his pride stand in the way of the team's success.
320;Cameron Diaz rose above her accustomed quirky lightweight roles to deliver a stunning performance as the hard.
321;this film had a great cast and a solid story that was marred by a narcissistic director who rendered it annoying to watch.
322;It's a shame, because I love sports stories and I never got a chance to enjoy this one.
323;however,look closer at an ambitious exploration of pride,greed and passion.
324;like football scenes,Any Given Sunday certainly makes an impression,nomatter what way you look at it.
325;defiently a must for Al Pacino and Oliver Stone fans,whose similiarly over the top and manic ways of expressing themselves blend like a fiery dream.
326;jamie Foxx also stars in his first great performance as a 'serious' actor.
327;The result was a movie trying to show the truth about football ( only money counts, athletes playing injured, evil doctors, arrogant stars, etc, etc )and mescling it with the tradition of the game ( a game of men, of gladiators, the best Sunday entertainment you can have, etc).
328;All in all, a good distraction.
329;speed performance as a 3!
330;I think this may actually be my favorite Oliver Stone movie.
331;Other movies he's done have greater scattered moments throughout, but I always wind up feeling that his pounding/bigger.
332;Any Given Sunday, however, is a football movie.
333;not a brilliant movie, it's true, but certainly a good one.
334;Lots of great performances, pounding rain, grunting, growling, smashing into each other.
335;with a fair bit of thematic content tossed in as well.
336;I received this package far faster than I anticipated!
337;a little graphic on sexuality but love team spirit.
338;Best part is when they are carrying lawrence taylor offthe field and he smiles and says BE CAREFULL , DON'T DROP ME , I'M A MILLION DOLLAR MAN .
339;Oliver Stone has a talent for telling the raw nature of events in his stories and this one is no exception.
340;I had trouble finding a storyline because of the frenzied editing and vibrant soundtrack.
341;Any Given Sunday starts out as an insightful look into the world of professional football.
342;The movie begins very well by dropping us right into the middle of a game.
343;The camera work here is excellent (as it is in most of the movie) and we are able to both follow the action of the game and feel the intensity of the players.
344;But the aspect of most interest is the behind the scenes look it gives us.
345;By the end, it is a movie we have all seen before: the old root for the good.
346;That said, the movie is an exciting ride and well worth watching.
347;It's too easy to take pot shots at Oliver Stone, his filmmaking style, his excessive use of . . . well, pretty much everything.
348;Criticisms of Stone's clich 's pretty much have become the realm of clich themselves.
349;I'm a sports fan (a fairly rabid one at that) and I loved this film, warts and all.
350;His style serves a vision of the All American game as few others before him have.
351;He here captures the feeling of the business of football with ferocious artistic integrity and vision, if not necessarily with the accuracy some fan's may wish.
352;Not a move goer but I enjoy this movie.
353;Would watch it again with friends .
354;I am not a football fan but I enjoyed this movie.
355;I would recommend this movie.
356;Like the players in American football, Oliver Stone's had his ups and downs.
357;Any Given Sunday is actually one of the director's most accessible works and resonates more with Stone's earlier and mid period work like Wall Street than it does with his work on US presidents.
358;as with most of his best tales, Any Given Sunday presents a battlefield of morality.
359;With a star cast that's easy on the eye .
360;Nonetheless, for Stone fans, this is undeniably enjoyable and engaging stuff.
361;The medical ethic is carved in relief between a brief but intense dialogue between Mathew Modine and James Woods.
362;the mesmerizing performance of Jammie Fox proved his recent Award was not a mere product of the coincidence.
363;Dennis Quaid is perfect as Cap and Cameron Diaz is simply arresting as the one sight heiress and widow of this team, legacy of her father.
364;may be there awesome scenes that can wound your susceptibility, but this is one the fundamental characteristics of the artistic personality of Oliver Stone.
365;I'm a big fan of football movies.
366;The opening sequence takes us to the field during a late.
367;And for me to actually care about the outcome it might to throw at least one likable character in the mix.
368;pacino is great and lots of great football action.
369;awesome pro cameos as well.
370;great great movie for sports fan
371;This is one of the best movies ever.
372;It has so many truths of life and how people act to those truths.
373;good performances from Pacino and Jamie Foxx, good soundtrack as well.
374;I'm very much a football fan.
375;I think this was a good view of the professional game of football.
376;Definitely the greatest football movie ever, one of my MOST FAVORITE movies ever!
377;well, maybe not curling, but one of the most interesting sports to make a movie of is football.
378;This mostly impart because of the acting and writing.
379;Al Pacino does a brilliant job of portraying head coach, Tony D'Amato and John C. McGinley, a great character actor, as his biggest critic.
380;One moment she is screaming at Al, the next sympathetic, so she didn't come off as bad as I think was planned.
381;Where is the commentary?Even though I have complained about almost every aspect of this movie, the saving grace is the incredible football scenes.
382;For a three hour movie to catch my attention and hold it, it must be very engrossing from start to finish.
383;This movie is interesting from start to somewhere decidedly south of finish.
384;Diaz does a good job at being the snotty brat .
385;Luckily for them, acting takes a back seat here to camera angles, music and flash.
386;i really, really liked this movie.
387;as my husband said reflectively, about two thirds of the way through, lying next to me on our bed, totally engrossed by this solidly directed, well acted, well written diorama of our all american pastime, I could watch this all night.
388;this imbalance in their parts in this ensemble piece is more than made up for by another stellar performance by the incredible Al Pacino, who just keeps getting better and better as he gets older and older.
389;And Jamie Foxx more than meets his challenge, playing with incredible class and finesse the young, up(chuck) and coming athlete of the day who needs to learn the big lesson that we stand united, or we lose.
390;There is a reason it's called a team .
391;Cameron Diaz is as wicked as the wicked witch in Snow White and you just have to love her for the gusto with which she plays this one dimensional part.
392;this movie is a love letter to football, the great American pastime.
393;As directed by Oliver Stone, it has a lot going for it.
394;I thought it was really fun, it kept me awake even though it was long, and I recommend it to anyone, even those of you who, like me, are doing things other than watching football.
395;While admiring his talent, I've hated most other Oliver Stone movies, but in this case the film maker and his subject are perfectly matched.
396;top style, was born to make THE definitive movie about pro football, and this is it.
397;Pacino's Inches speech is the best macho film speech since the opening scene of Patton.
398;nFL logos and team names are distracting, but it's otherwise as good as a pro football film can get.
399;Director, Oliver Stone does a great job of showing you the eye.
400;Oliver Stone does a terrific job of devolping characters and creating a common bond between the many obstacles the team has to overcome.
401;He has done it again with Any Given Sunday, a technical and dramatic masterpiece.
402;But here, Stone delivers a stimulating account of inside the NFL, and the boys that play the game.
403;I was very impressed with the photographic clips of the game action, and the scintillating sound effects of the noise of the game.
404;Here again, the visuals are stunning.
405;She's tough, and believable in the roll.
406;i really liked this movie, including a great plt twist at the end.
407;Pacino was good, but not great.
408;i do give it 2 stars however due to the fact that the directing was excellent, and the cinematography was very well done.
409;Oliver Stone did the best he could do with this movie, but he should stick to what he's good at.
410;It then settled into a comedic and enjoyable experience.
411;Excellent casting and script with in.your.
412;face camera shots that kept my interest.
413;This one is definitely worth having in my collection!
414;Oliver Stone's look at the world of professional football is a masterpiece.
415;The film serves as a vision of contemporary Americans, our gridiron gladiators, their family life, their money.
416;The franitic camera movement and music gives the film the tone and pace of a real professional football game.
417;the film features great performances by Al Pacino as the coach (without the usual WHOO HAA!
418;comer Jamie Foxx gives a suprisingly brilliant performance as the young quarterback who wants to be a star.
419;And what is really important to you as you grow older.
420;Great football movie, but better insight into what makes us tick when you suddenly get $/fame thrown at you.
421;He doubts his ability to still perform, but thanks to his wife, who is more concerned with her own prestige than her husband's heath, he gives it one more go.
422;if you can find any seeing as that exceeds their life expectancy.
423;It's still an entertaining movie that I recommend, but it could have been historic.
424;i was hooked from the very first scene.
425;I did like it more than some of my football fan friends.
426;He, Jim Brown, LT (who actually was perfect for this film), and Dick Butkus just didn't fit the mold.
427;One of the better movies of its' genre.
428;Well directed with great filming, giving us an inside look at the seamy side of Pro Football
429;Great story about the day to day lives of a football team and the rise and fall of a young quaterback and redemption.
430;Great movie for sports fans.
431;But Pacino is still great.
432;If you like American Football, you will enjoy this movie.
433;At over 2 1/2 hours it never slows down, and there's a really good cast including Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Ann.
434;Any Given SundayScore: 56/100What a great looking film: Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid and Oliver Stone, together.
435;It's simply remarkable that this turned out to be a below.
436;Such a good cast, such a good director and such a good trailer.
437;any Given Sunday made a decent amount of money at the box office and movie.
438;Oliver Stone's decision to go completely technical is sometimes acceptable, but to be honest, he needs to desperately measure up his game some time soon.
439;i really loved this film!Al Pacino was the original attraction in this film for me.
440;side of watching this great actor, who seems at home in any role, seemed do.
441;football fan, the game footage was awesome in it's visuals.
442;effort, loyalty, old versus new ideas, and reflections on life's choices in the retrospection of middle.
443;The acting of Jamie Foxx was a pleasant surprise, indeed all the actors kept the movie moving and interesting, or perhaps that was the direction of Oliver Stone.
444;Perhaps in making not his BEST film, he finally made one that even his nonfans could enjoy.
445;My husband really enjoyed this movie.
446;Isn't this a great way to watch movies.
447;in the comfort of your own home!
448;North Dallas Forty still reigns as most entertaining, realistic, and well.
449;done movie about professional football.
450;all in all, Any Given Sunday is a watchable and entertaining movie.
451;this is natural born killers .
452;I do, however, love movies about sports such as Hoosiers , The Cutting Edge , and Vision Quest so I took a chance on De Niro being in this movie and was mesmerized by him and the rest of the cast including football hero Jim Brown, Cameron Diaz, Mathew Modine, Dennis Quad, and Jamie Foxx (who knew he could act?
453;As a woman, the shower and locker room sequences were enough to watch but the rest of the movie proved to be true Oliver Stone.
454;excellent soundtrack, sound effects, personal drama and FOOTBALL!
455;I was thoroughly pleased and went on to watch the movie about 3 more times.
456;This is truly the best sports movie I have ever scene.
457;Something for everyone, especially us girls.
458;This movie has all the right pieces .
459;hitting action, a bit of philosophy and wisdom.
460;for some reason, it seems like the movie should've been able to thrive on just a few of these elements alone: Al Pacino and Camron Diaz play very memorable characters.
461;mouthed football coach, while Camron Diaz, the new team.
462;owner, is a young and stylish, forward.
463;The two actors are great, and when they're both on.
464;screen, they have a sort of dissonance that has the potential to drive a great film.
465;The football scenes are shot and edited with the sort of intensity that you might see in Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan when they're invading the beach.
466;in the end, the movie doesn't even really capture the excitement of football.
467;Every now and then, a scene will address the strategy of the game.
468;But overall, you never really see what makes Al Pacino such a great coach.
469;eyed, latching on to every word.
470;This is a character consistent for not caring about anyone's opinion on football.
471;Given how vicious she is in general, how aggressive every interaction between them appears, and the adrenaline of the moment, the sudden shift in tone just didn't convince me.
472;There are other things various fans and critics mention, and I will address some of those as well, but the rest can be labeled as directorial decisions.
473;now for the good stuff, which there is a lot more of.
474;That one short back and forth between he and Tony painted a clear picture of a cyclical problem, with both sides responsible for self.
475;It is some wonderful character development done very efficiently.
476;It was a wonderful scene, and possibly the best camera work in the movie.
477;I agree completely, and I think this is intentional.
478;Lawrence Taylor was wonderful, even if he was pretty much playing Lawrence Taylor.
479;He added a lot of humor and real flavor.
480;Again, Diaz could have been better, but for the most part I enjoyed her performance, and she sold the character perfectly in her reaction to Charleton Heston's accusation.
481;I hope this review helps you see something more in this movie and I am hoping to hear any comments you might have, as this is my first significant review.
482;Any Given Sunday is about the Miami Sharks football team and their struggle to make it to the top.
483;Still, after a few games he finds his stride and becomes the team's golden boy.
484;Cameron Diaz is my favorite character because she's so incredibly fierce that I can't believe she gets away with treating the people she does without any consequences.
485;One of the most hilarious moments of the film involves a commercial he films for MetRx complete with his own song, My name is Willie (Beamen), make sure to look out for it.
486;Overall, the cast is stellar and the direction is superb.
487;Any Given Sunday is a must.
488;see for anyone who enjoys sports movies that are fast.
489;I love this movie, so happy I was able to find it on blueray!
490;He's a Natural Born Director and a wonderful storyteller.
491;Sure it's nice to see and hear, but after that game, it means nothing.
492;So is true for this film.
493;I love his works and I can't leave out this one.
494;type production: big and loud music, pretty sexy girls, drugs, and football.
495;Seen that, done it twice, go on.
496;That sums up Al Pacino's performance and character.
497;A movie worth owning, no.
498;An Oliver Stone achievement, not worth mentioning.
499;A very entertaining Cult Classic with a brilliant (and surprising) cast of real and ficticious players.
500;Great soundtrack, crazy cinematography and editing but it all works to evoke the madness surrounding the world of The Player and The Coaches often turmultuous relationships!
501;Al Pacino delivers in this action/drama about football.
502;It shows how much a man loves football and the greatness it takes to be a player and a coatch.
503;This was truly a great movie.
504;I liked Any Given Sunday and I am not even a football fan but, once I got pass the football aspect of the movie I really enjoyed it.
505;North Dallas Forty is still the best football movie made to date, but I have to admit I am somewhat surprised that this film was not more impressive.
506;Then again, I liked Willie Beamon's game ritual (and the way it becomes taken as a sure sign of good things to come)
507;But at least that scene makes up for all the scenery chewing and maudlin reflections Pacino has to do throughout the rest of the movie.
508;Very good to open the weekend with.
509;hubby liked he is always looking for something adventurous to read or watch and this kept him busy for quite a while.
510;This Oliver Stone film goes behind the scenes of big time football and delves into it all .
511;large seductive lifestyle of big money.
512;Not only did the story keep me glued to the screen for its full 157 minutes, but all the performances were excellent.
513;al Pacino, as the coach, was outstanding.
514;That's a tall order for a actor and he does it masterfully.
515;the rest of the cast is full of star power.
516;life mythic tale of modern.
517;day gladiators who push themselves past the line of good sense for fame, fortune, money and glory and the corporate interests and media hype that keep it all together.
518;i loved this video completely and give it a high recommendation.
519;This is an absolute classic sports movie.
520;I'd happily watch this movie a couple of times per year, and definitely before any major tournament.
521;The plot and the story line were great.
522;Al Pacino is passionate as a veteren coach whose passed over when the team owner dies in favor of the surviving daughter.
523;Like many of Stone's films, thisis intense and full of detail while getting into lots of the characters lives and motivations.
524;This has been one of my favorite films from first seeing it in the theater.
525;Holds up well over time.
526;Soundtrack is amazing and chilling.
527;on the plus side, the locker room pep talk speeches were well written and inspiring.
528;Al Pacino as always was fantastic as a Vince Lombardi type of coach.
529;Oliver Stone didnt exactly win with this one, but in my mind, its a solid movie.
530;struggles and competition in general.
531;Oliver Stone has penned a brilliant script and woven a tight and subtle story here for the discerning audience.
532;the viewer will have to carefully observe the subtle interplay between various people to really appreciate what is going on in their minds and how each person changes as the movie progresses.
533;the editing is just top.
534;rate, the quick cuts and sharp angles to capture the excitement on the field is just terrific, but it might be a bit of an eye.
535;another outstanding highlight is the music, very very apt and and adding to the mood in each scene.
536;on the whole, a top class movie.
537;Although I am not a big fan of team sports, I basically enjoyed this film despite its flaws.
538;Cameron Diaz turns in a good performance as the team owner and I like Pacino as an actor pretty much no matter what he does on screen.
539;any pro football fan knows that this, right off the bat, is Stone taking liberties in this real football story.
540;Aside from James Woods and a few funny qutotes from his mouth, and one great shouting match between Diaz and Pacino, there is nothing to enjoy here.
541;Loud, raucous, and at times indecipherable, Any Given Sunday is director Oliver Stone's best movie in years.
542;This incisive look at a pro football team undergoing a make or break period is, in my opinion, the best picture about the game ever made.
543;The team is on a losing streak and really need a win.
544;Christina's deceased father founded the team, and D'Amato has led it to many victorious seasons in his thirty years as coach.
545;She can't get top dollar for a losing team.
546;By the next game, D'Amato has worked his magic on Beaman, who turns out to be a great football player after all.
547;there is much more to Any Given Sunday's story, but it is the movie's drive and the great acting that make it so good.
548;Nobody can play a man in the twilight of his glory better than Al Pacino.
549;Cameron Diaz is so good as the heartless Christina that she's almost scary.
550;Jamie Foxx gives a career making performance as Willie Beaman, while LL Cool J is first.
551;The idea is to put the viewer on the field with the players, and Oliver Stone achieved this.
552;These scenes are so intense that I came away feeling a bit bruised myself.
553;What Stone does is to portray the players as modern day gladiators.
554;What I got was a near two and a half hour incredible experince that really demonstrated the talent of Diaz, Foxx and Cool J.
555;The movie was sucessfull in keeping you interested throughout, and Stone really captures the drama of football very well.
556;Along with a great soundtrack, the movie really shines as one of the best football flicks to date.
557;Pacino's before the big game speech in this is also incredibly well written, and he sells it with the perfect amount of emotion.
558;Oliver gives ego a new meaning!
559;Cut about half of the movie out (including ALL scenes with Mr. Stone) and a watchable movie could be there though that is also questionable.
560;It's fast and furious as it should be and Jamie Foxx is outstanding
561;I spent an entertaining 2 and 1/2 hours watching this movie, and I am no football fan.
562;The performances of many of the actors are simply wonderful, especially Jamie Foxx (who knew?)
563;Excellent action scenes and well.
564;I really do love this movie.
565;Foxx and Pacino are great, and Pacino's speech near the end is absolutely fantastic.
566;It also is an interesting look at football culture.
567;I thought this movie was really fun to watch at the moment, because Colin Kaepernick is somewhat similar to Willie Beamen in terms of how he has kind of randomly and quickly ascended to football stardom.
568;Great movie to watch on a weekend with little football.
569;In fact, I would say the football shown in this movie will probably be more exciting than the football played at the Pro Bowl.
570;It was great to revisit this classic.
571;Stone does a masterful job of rendering caricatures to realistic, if some times slightly cliched, characters.
572;I was really curious to see this film because i saw some previous Stone's movies wich i liked and also because i like a lot sport movies, i'm thinking of Tin Cup and Bull Durham.
573;Admittedly, I have always found Oliver Stone's films to be entertaining.
574;And, truth be known, I was curious to see what Stone thought about the state of professional football, albeit via his mythical Miami Sharks.
575;the verdict is that I really liked this film.
576;Call it a guilty pleasure if you must, but I really enjoyed this movie.
577;The screenplay is structured around some interesting and engaging characters, providing good insights into their individual experiences with the team.
578;The cast is first rate and there are plenty of good performances.
579;From the owner's box, to the training room, at home with the wife and kids, and off the field with all of its complications, this movie does a memorable job of showing all sides of the world of professional football.
580;I even liked the movie soundtrack with its catchy tunes.
581;No offense to the other reviewers, but Heston is perfect as the power.
582;James Woods is great as the veteran team physician who has seen too much.
583;Jim Brown and LT give accurate and believable performances in their respective roles.
584;I also found the parallels between the film's plot line and the present day soap opera going on with my beloved Cowboys to be kind of spooky.
585;this movie is not a classic but there is a lot about it that holds up in repeated viewings.
586;dog world of the professional athletics is portrayed in some admittedly predictable scenes, but there are some nice surprises as well.
587;The ending to this movie is, for me, its truest moment.
588;If you can do the same thing, my guess is that you will really enjoy this movie.
589;There is a lot more about it that works than most of these reviews would lead you to believe.
590;A stellar cast, great script, and capable director.
591;the cast is the true strength of this movie.
592;Obviously Pacino is excellent as the coach on the bubble who is struggling to hold his team and his life together at the same time.
593;Cameron Diaz is given her first opportunity to show that she can ACT in this movie, and she plays the role perfectly.
594;Dennis Quaid is his usual reliable self as a Marino/Young who is nearing the end of a fantastic career.
595;the downside to the film is the artsy.
596;moving style that Stone chose to film in, and big headaches are the only result.
597;otherwise, it's an engaging script with a cleaver ending.
598;Probably will appeal to sports fans more than anyone else, but it's still a good football movie.
599;but if you ever poured your heart out into anything, if you ever fought for something through pain, disillusion and disappointment, if you ever put on cleats, or skates or basketball shoes or anything to go out with a bunch of guys and win a game this movie will touch you deeply.
600;If you can do that the film will be a rewarding emotional experience .
601;it is easiest to understand the movie if you were ever involved in competitive sports but trust Pacino when he says that the game of football is just like life .
602;Try exploring the parallels between football and life .
603;Love jamie foxx in this move and the other actors but I do feel that jamie foxx is the one that really made this movie pretty good
604;most of The Acting is Overrated.
605;the Football Scenes are cool.
606;should have been a Better film.
607;He made a totally believable coach.
608;Gives you a side of football you don't get to see.
609;Meanwhile, the coach finds himself constantly at battle with the team owner's money and power hungry daughter intent on moving the team out.
610;worthy performance, Al Pacino was awesome as the coach, Cameron Diaz was daringly pleasing and LL Cool J was hip.
611;Oliver Stone's cinematic obsession with portrayting American culture as a Vietnam battleground continues with this exhausting study of their national sport.
612;telling conventions in favour of flashy cutting, trippy camerawork and a barrage of electic musical snippets, this is a game of two halves.
613;face American football footage is hypnotic, thrilling, scary and technically astounding, the off.
614;the first half hour of the film is almost a mini masterpiece.
615;When Rooney receives a major injury, Beaman is thrust into the spotlight and begins to show his potential.
616;As his quarterback skills improve and the team seems destined for a play.
617;there's a handful of other subplots too, which you could probably write yourself and the fine supporting cast .
618;Pacino is energetic as usual, even if he is in shouty auto.
619;This is possibly the shortest two and a half hour movie I have ever seen.
620;Excellent characters and acting and a fast moving story make this the surprise of the year for me.
621;The whole film is a visual spectacular(on field and off field) with Stones creative cutting keeping everything lively throughout.
622;There is one shot of Elizabeth Berkley however that is rather revealing(best shot in the film actually) oh yeah!
623;In fact all I know about the game is that there is a ball that must be moved from one end of a rectangular field to the other.
624;The movie is about an old coach (Al Pacino) whose love of the game has blinded him to life's real pleasures, an injured QB (Quaid) who is easily manipulated by others to continue playing even if it is detrimental to his health.
625;this movie is exciting even for those, like me, who aren't too interested in football.
626;overall, this was a great movie.
627;I'd recommend it to anyone who likes drama.
628;This was a great movie.
629;The cast is awesome and of course the Hypernetic film editing.
630;I really enjoyed the intercuts that they had in this movie.
631;great movie, even if you do not know american football.
632;well, if you do know american football, it's even greater.
633;I really enjoyed this film even though I am not a football fan and have only watched a few games in my whole life, it is obvious Stone is a real fan and made this as his love letter to the sport.
634;It is fun trying to pick out all the real football stars who have cameos in this film, and even Charlton Heston!!!
635;Pacino's speech about the tradition of football to the young Jamie Foxx is quite inspiring.
636;Lawrence Taylor is a lot of fun to watch.
637;The Bottom Line:Any Given Sunday, Oliver Stone's vision of football as populated by he.
638;This movie Any Given Sunday is a great movie it has full contact in it and all the football scenes are hard hitting combat
639;i did NOT enjoy the cinematography.
640;The two stars are for the decent preformances.
641;Pretty much the whole cast was good.
642;I've seen the movie and loved it.
643;Pacino's speech about inches, was amazing.
644;One of my all time favorite NFL Movies.
645;Oliver Stone did a great job on this one!
646;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
647;All you need to know about this movie is:Immensely talented cast (except for the always.
648;But, with all the tension between the struggling football team, it seems to fit inside you quite well.
649;the football scenes are very well made, especially the sound editing.
650;It's almost as if you feel the players tackling right in front of you!I was rather skeptical with Al Pacino playing a once again ahrdbeat character and Jaimee Foxx playing one of the lead roles, but surprisingly, both were excellent, with Pacino's performance Oscar.
651;And on any given sunday, you may win, and you may lose.
652;Any Given Sunday is Oliver Stone's expose of football, and more importantly the lives of the men that experience it.
653;This movie proved to me that Lawrence Taylor can act, as he has the most powerful scene in the movie in the shower room.
654;The only extras are a documentary, a trailer, and a music video.
655;There is also some extra footage thrown in.
656;If you got a nice sound system, you will feel like you're right in the game, with every hit and crunch.
657;superb act by the greatest Al Pacino.
658;superb job by Stone by putting together such an amazing cast.
659;movie is good enough to watch again periodically so enjoy and let this be enough words to make it publishable
660;AL Pacino, Cameron Diaz, and Jamie Foxx are excellent in this movie.
661;this is in my top 5.
662;As my title indicates, I'm not the biggest football fan
663;That, along with the movie's entertaining musical soundtrack, makes this film a must.
664;in regards to the acting, Any Given Sunday shows a variety of talent, experience, along with stars.
665;His performance as brash, young, third.
666;quarterback Willie Beaman, brought into the limelight after injuries sustained by veteran Dennis Quaid, is the perfect showcase for the actor's emerging skills.
667;It is no wonder that Foxx won an Oscar this year and he deserved a nomination for AGS.
668;cameron Diaz, as the general manager of the fictional Miami Sharks, is quite good as a woman in charge of a male.
669;She holds her own with the more seasoned performers that populate this dynamic film.
670;quaid gives another underrated performance as the washed.
671;up quarterback with one more good game to play.
672;James Woods, one of the best character actors today, delivers another flawless job as the seedy team doctor.
673;Matthew Modine, L. l. Cool J, and Aaron Eckhart match him in other supporting roles.
674;though her role is small, Lauren Holly gets some points for her performance as Quaid's supportive and determined wife.
675;football legends Jim Brown and Lawrence Taylor are effective in their roles of assistant coach and veteran linesman, respectively.
676;As a tribute to the actor, as well as providing a fitting comparison between football's modern.
677;day gladiators to those of ancient times, a montage of scenes from Ben.
678;but the movie belongs to Al Pacino, an actor of unparalleled talent that immerses himself in the role of the old school coach that must make deal with a changing sports world and the traditions that he holds so dearly.
679;When he experiences joy, that feeling is shared by all.
680;oliver Stone is a great story teller.
681;Either with a satirical film about excessive violence with Natural Born Killers , or with one of the best movies about The Vietnm War with Platoon .
682;He is the workaholic, and old.
683;Last, is Jaimie Foxx: he does an outstanding job of playing the rising star.
684;He takes the game to his head, and makes enemies.
685;He does a good job playing the emotions of his character.
686;He was a great casting contribution to this all.
687;there are a lot of quick roles played by big time actors.
688;a very enjoyable movie, something to watch any given Sunday (no pun intended).
689;Football as a metaphor for life
690;But understand that by decent I mean that this movie was, if nothing else, a professional endeavor that was packaged and delivered in a way you would expect from the star.
691;One of the best, if not, the best football movie of all time.
692;From the young quaterback caught up in his own hype to the two veterans battling with age to the coach that everybody believes the game has passed.
693;Good Actors,Awesome Drama and Smashmouth Football Action.
694;Al Pacino shouted in the last play of the final game.
695;The feelings that a real player experiences were shown quite well in this film.
696;This film shows how it is.
697;If you want pure entertainment, see The Longest Yard.
698;If you want some real football, see this. . . if you've lived it, see it.
699;Shows the story of how football can be behind the lines.
700;Any Given Sunday was a fair football movie that could have been a great sports film if skillfully edited to a more reasonable 2 hour length.
701;Aside from its bladder busting 157 minute endurance, it was a fairly entertaining study of modern day football not too far removed in attitude and tone from North Dallas Forty.
702;But times as they say are a changing and Stone addressed the new economic realities of creative stadium financing, a new breed of athlete acutely aware of lucrative endorsement possibilities that go hand in hand with success on the gridiron, and Stone played the race card to some clever advantage.
703;Comedian Jamie Foxx was wonderful in his dramatic turn as a third string quarterback who suddenly finds himself the object of media and public attention as surprise replacement to Cap Rooney, the injured, aging star of the Miami Sharks, nicely defined by Dennis Quaid.
704;margret, Lauren Holly, Charlton Heston as the Commissioner, and Clifton Davis as a shrewd big city mayor.
705;On the whole I'd say this was an entertaining and sometimes provocative glimpse into the world of professional sports and big time American pop culture on any given Sunday afternoon.
706;Director Oliver Stone always has people who represent a point of view first, and are characters second.
707;I enjoyed some of the more minor characters a bit more.
708;some of the young football players were really well done.
709;And Dennis Quaid is properly seedy, kinda the anti.
710;perfect ensemble cast, forget gorgeous (if overdone) cinematography, forget perfect sound.
711;The true star of Any Given Sunday is the incredible choreography.
712;A good deal of this movie takes place on the gridiron itself as twenty.
713;football fan like myself (don't know any football fans who have seen it yet, so can't comment), but even while flinching at the sound of a body hitting the ground after being battered by two even bigger bodies in midair, it's still visually stunning.
714;Beamen ignores the playbook, calls his own plays, and turns the team around.
715;The woman is a flaming, gold.
716;This leads me to believe that switching Diaz and Holly would have been in the best interests of the film
717;But you play with what you got.
718;caliber performance, but Foxx shows he's more than capable of playing a dramatic role and playing it well.
719;He's helped by a minor cast and a bunch of football.
720;but it's nice to see it applied to something nonpolitical for the first time since his highly.
721;banned Rock and Roll Part Two gets a few bars early on.
722;excellent filmmaking, especially when held up against the last seventeen years of Oliver Stone's career.
723;Oliver Stone returns with Any Given Sunday, which is probably the best football movie ever made.
724;Stone, using his usual visual brilliance and complex writing style, creates a movie that is fun but effective, intelligent and sometimes thoughtful.
725;What Stone does is make a movie about football where the characters are just as important as the action going on in the field.
726;This is Stone's best film since Nixon.
727;He's usually known for political, provocative and satirical masterpieces like JFK, Natural Born Killers, Nixon and Talk Radio, but here he examines the sports industry and perfectly exploits how football has become some sort of religion in our society.
728;He also examines the elements of the athlete and what an athlete goes through in life.
729;He doesn't just show us a game, he takes us INTO a game.
730;The performances are superb as well, especially Al Pacino who burns the screen with a fury.
731;The camera work as always is superb as is always the case with Stone.
732;The screenplay surprisingly has it's meditative moments and complex ideas and an entertaining plot.
733;Owner is concerned with television ratings, possibly moving the franchise .
734;By this time, though, Coach has accepted Young Hot Shot's unruly methods and allows him to just go for it, and they of course, win the game.
735;Football is the most complex game on the planet .
736;The movie is edited like a commercial .
737;i do not recommend this film, especially if you love football and are hoping for a good sports movie.
738;Now that I have made that disclaimer, I have to say that this is an extremely good movie.
739;The writing, camera work and acting are all first rate.
740;The sound editing is particularly first rate, enhancing the on screen action immeasurably.
741;The plot is intricate, yet never boring as Pacino struggles for personal redemption and a new start while reigning in Foxx, and Foxx struggles with all authority, most particularly the coaching staff.
742;an excellent supporting cast rounds out the production, notably Dennis Quaid as an aging quarterback, a one time nemesis of Foxx, and James Woods as a slimy team doctor in a role that only he could execute this flawlessly.
743;With the exception of those quibbles, the movie is a very well made, very human movie that most mature audiences (even us non sports lovers) will like.
744;Unlike Jerry Maguire, which found a way to appeal to a broad segment of the movie going public, Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday pretty much requires that one be a hardcore aficionado of professional football to really appreciate it.
745;Not only does Foxx give by far and away the finest, most intensely dramatic performance of the film, but also his character provides the few moments of really solid insightful drama in the entire movie.
746;chilling blizzards, this entire summer.
747;Part of the beauty of the sport lies in seeing the players' movements as all of a piece.
748;Any Given Sunday is definitely a long haul and it does offer a few moments of effective drama scattered along the way.
749;Although the movie is somewhat predictable (except the ending in the credits), it is entertaining to watch.
750;The best I can say for it is that it's not nearly as worthless as Natural Born Killers.
751;recommended for the fan or non fan alike.
752;Oliver Stone is a fine movie director although his recent offerings have been paltry, including this one.
753;field action is captured perfectly.
754;Al Pacino brings a wearied cynicism to his role as Coach D'Amato and is excellent as usual.
755;moving despite the football action, though.
756;unless you are a football fan, stay well away.
757;Both pictures are great, but they provide the viewer with a snapshot of pro.
758;Any Given Sunday , at almost three hours running time, is easily Oliver Stone's best picture since Born on the 4th of July .
759;They both turn in fine performances, but it is the performance of comedian Jamie Foxx as an egotistical young quarterback that makes this all work.
760;Jim Brown is excellent as of the team's assistant coaches and Pacino's old friend.
761;In addition, there are a number of fine performances from L. L. Cool J., Lawrence Taylor, James Woods, Matthew Modine, Clifton Davis, Ann.
762;Look for former Oklahoma and Dallas Cowboy coach Barry Switzer in a cameo role as well as one of my favorite character actors, John C. McGinley, as a full.
763;the action in this movie is good, and juxtaposed against the rap music background really makes it seem almost frenetic at times, even the slo.
764;Anyone thinking of viewing this picture would do well to ignore the scathing remarks of both Amazon.
765;It is a good picture, and one of Stone's best.
766;I thought this was a well acted, written, and directed movie, but what is it with the cuss words?
767;The language aside this is a very good movie.
768;The football scenes are shot in a way that make you feel like you are in the stadium and you can feel every hit happening.
769;the best part of the movie happens during the credits (I will not spill the beans!)
770;Somebody somewhere tried very hard to make a landmark, unforgettable movie that glorifies football and places it in a completely abstract light.
771;up in one of the crowd scenes.
772;The thesis, football as a symbol of the decline of a bygone age of honor and teamwork, is compelling enough to carry a film.
773;Any Given Sunday kicks off with throbbing action and razor.
774;sharp editing to achieve this goal.
775;These are all football films with varying degrees of success (except ROUGHNESS), but Oliver Stone, in his usual over the top way, throws a dizzying, mind.
776;splitting film at us, much like the sport itself.
777;This is why I liked it.
778;oliver Stone began a wicked spell of filmmaking with JFK, evident in its editing style.
779;Nothing is new here with ANY GIVEN SUNDAY.
780;Football is a battlefield Stone chooses to depict and depict it he does.
781;It is a maniacal celebration of the game.
782;The scenes on the field are the ones I cherished.
783;no one has ever put such energy into football scenes in a film before.
784;He definitely had some good consultants.
785;There are some comical cameos .
786;Lawrence Taylor can actually act a teeny bit and Jim Brown shares the film's best off the field scene with Pacino in a bar.
787;They are filmed and cut with such raw intensity, you feel like playing afterwards.
788;Yes, and this surprised me considering how unconventional Stone usually is.
789;serious dramas being made lately, what sets this film apart is its incompetence.
790;(And keep the kiddees away, this film borders on being x. rated.)
791;An Oliver Stone film about american football.
792;mmm what a good film that would make.
793;Any way Pacino is in one of his best performances yet and personally I could not fault with wonderfully crafted masterpeice
794;An overall good football movie that shows the true grit behind the game and management of it.
795;Nothing good comes without a fight.
796;touch with the modern game, he resigns his job only to take another with an expansion team.
797;and her efforts to do that put her in hot water with the commissioner (a nice cameo by Charlton Heston, seen earlier in the movie on Tony's TV in the Ben.
798;it's touching to see a fading star in a movie in which the fading of stars (and their fading earning power) is something the movie dwells on.
799;There's a powerful scene in which Lavay schools the cocky young quarterback, and it all sounds quite high.
800;There's a funny scene in which Tony starts to talk to the high end girl who's servicing him about starting an ongoing relationship with him.
801;She assumes that he means a business relationship .
802;It was nice to see Ann.
803;margaret, aging very gracefully, as Diaz's alcoholic mother, but her part is one.
804;he conveys his pride, his fear, his loyalty, and his courage, and the scene where his wife upbraids him when he talks about retirement is the most humanly involving in the movie.
805;This one is a classic.
806;The video transfer was a B at best.
807;The sauna scene towards the end of the film had a great deal of video noise which you might not see due to the steam but it was most definitely there.
808;this is a fine movie, have always liked it and still do, but the Blu Ray provides little, if any, improvement over the original release.
809;That is exactly what I got.
810;and a whole lot more!
811;This film dives deeper into the lives of the players and the people who run the business up in the offices.
812;It is a very thorough film, and is very entertaining to watch.
813;The editing is perfect and the cinematography puts us in the game itself!
814;Al Pacino and Jamie Foxx give stellar performances, as do the rest of the wonderful cast.
815;It shows that these actors have a lot of range in their work.
816;I was surprised to see Elizabeth Berkley in the cast.
817;Randy Quaid gives one of his best performances here as the teams number one player who is suffering from and injury and is homebound.
818;Among Oliver Stone's work includes Any Given Sunday (1999), as good and realistic a sports movie as has ever been made.
819;top performance by Al Pacino as a veteran pro football coach who can still motivate his over.
820;Among Oliver Stone's work includes Any Given Sunday (1999), as good and realistic a sports movie as has ever been made.
821;top performance by Al Pacino as a veteran pro football coach who can still motivate his over.
822;I love how they show how fleeting success and fame can be.
823;Al Pacino at his gritty best.
824;Anyway, besides that, I think this is one of the best sports movies I've ever seen, and Lawrence Taylor is really the most exciting character to watch, knowing his story making the movie even more interesting.
825;Superb football sequences really keep your interest in the film.
826;It was also a pleasant surprise to see that Stone didn't try to politicize football or turn the film into a racial commentary.
827;There were many other good performances .
828;Matthew Modine, Jamie Foxx, James Woods (played the perfect jerk yet again), and the list goes on.
829;This is a really good movie with an excellent cast, but there are quite a few things in this that are definitely NOT young male friendly!
830;For us big boys and girls though, really good with a great twist (sorry, no spoiler alert here 
831;As you'll read here this film draws mixed emotions from many here who have seen it.
832;overall this was a very entertaining film and could be enjoyed provided you accept these weaknesses in the plot and instead enjoy the film for what I believe it's intention was
833;If not taken seriously, it's a fun film.
834;Though I respect most of the all.
835;star rating is the very violent and unrealistically entertaining football game sequences.
836;oliver Stone should've definitely passed on this movie.
837;He is one of the greatest movie veterans of our time, and I would be less assertive if someone else had directed this.
838;Note to Oliver and Al, next time, read the script.
839;There are some interesting camera angles, innovative football shots and a good performance by Al Pacino, but that's about it.
840;I didn't absolutely hate this, but giving it five stars as some have, is completely astonishing.
841;There were some decent performances from some big.
842;This is definitely a breakout performance for him, and probably the best film work he's ever done.
843;It's a very intriguing idea.
844;despite all those problems I still give this movie three stars.
845;Because it's pretty exciting, that's why.
846;It's a highly kinetic film based on a highly kinetic topic.
847;Perhaps someone with a bit more football knowledge than Oliver Stone obviously has.
848;His stunning performance over several games is so outstanding and fresh it seems to augur a new era in the history of this Miami franchise, and forces aging coach Tony D'Amato to reevaluate his time.
849;tested values and strategies and begin to confront the fact that the game, as well as post.
850;Wild and outrageous, Any Given Sunday gives you a glimpses into an athletic world not too far from the real thing.
851;This movie proved to be a very enjoyable experience.
852;All of The performances in this film are top of the line.
853;Great charcter developement and powerful cast.
854;Coach Switzer is just one of the many famous folk suiting up in Oliver Stone's quasi.
855;The many cameos make this movie fun.
856;Perhaps it's a modern football.
857;I found Pacino's locker room pep talk more inspiring than Win one for the Gipper!
858;every time discovering something more!
859;I had high expectations for this movie and I love sports so usually I'll let some things slide.
860;One of the best movies ever I don't get tired of watching that movie great actors a never gets old watching any giving Sunday
861;I have watched it many times and affirm that it really gets one ready for some football .
862;stories, all woven into the tapestry of professional football.
863;You will see the good and bad in people, and you will see a team forged from all levels of physical, psychological and emotional combat.
864;Oliver Stone orchestrates a music.
865;like, surreal production in which the football action is explosive, crystal clear and totally believable.
866;You are drawn into each of the evolving tales, seeing new things every time you watch this movie.
867;up, tattoed freaks of nature perform astounding feats of physical prowess?
868;any Given Sunday has a lot to recommend it.
869;It's got a sweet Hollywood budget, a cast loaded to the brim with talent (and no sign of Keanu Reeves, thankfully
870;In following the turbulent last quarter of a season in the life of the (fictional) Miami Sharks of the (fictional) AFFA, the movie combines an operatic scope with an almost fanatical attention to detail and loads of heavy philosophy for a film whose best moments (whether on the field or not) are as hard.
871;hitting as anything you'll see in a real game.
872;Sure, the movie trots out an endless series of hackneyed plot devices and stock characters, but Stone manages to breathe life into all of them.
873;At times it seems as though Stone just tried to take the themes and conflicts that made Platoon such an artistic triumph and graft them onto a football movie.
874;The movie goes for an outsized, epic feel at almost all times, with varying degrees of success.
875;at turns frenetic and painfully slow, Stone's camerawork makes for perhaps the best cinematic representation yet of the intensity and ferocity of pro football, and the movie's grasp of the game's strategical minutiae is a sign of a director who's done his homework.
876;At any rate, while certainly not without its flaws, Any Given Sunday is one immensely enjoyable movie, especially for the football nut.
877;The hero won the Championship two years ago now the want him to go!
878;let's start with Al, a paisan.
879;A nation turns its lonely eyes to your lonely eyes.
880;There you are, holding forth on this, that or the other.
881;stone, as director, co. writer and bit actor in the movie, wants it both ways.
882;that it uses up bodies and spirits .
883;the spectacular hits, the macho strutting, the caveman sexuality.
884;Ok, fine, that being the case, then why doesn't he offer us in On Any Given Sunday, any meaningful, insightful, first.
885;getting back to On Any Given Sunmday, the funniest part of the movie, albeit completley unintentional, is the quick.
886;Oh, please, Lord have mercy!
887;(And, please note: I'm an agnostic.)
888;as previously noted, the movie is packed with talented craftsman, Stone and Pacino included among them.
889;(And those are the *good* parts of the movie!
890;An occurence that's yet to happen.
891;enough, Oliver, with these nanosecond, wink.
892;cuts, Oliver, I couldn't keep up .
893;Better yet, know what, read the book by the same name.
894;Breath deeply, take a tranquilizer, study the way Vittorio DeSica used his camera.
895;or what 'americans' think of as a great life.
896;These vehicle flicks can, from time to time, be well.
897;for a basic plot summary, Sunday focuses on the Sharks, a pro football team coach by Al Pacino.
898;lL Cool J showing he can act as well as rap.
899;the ONLY bright spot of this experience is the epic speech given by Pacino's character before the film's climax.
