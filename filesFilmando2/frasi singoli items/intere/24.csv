id;spiegazione
1;Although afflicted with terribly commericial sensibilities, James Cameron certainly always gives 100%, and this is an action movie you can enjoy without compromising your intelligence.
2;but for me, this is simply one of the best films.
3;Alien's is one of the most refreshing action film's that I've seen in a long time.
4;It has all of the pieces needed to create a dazzling example of fine form and just plain slick wizadry.
5;She goes on one condition: They don't go to study the Alien's (if there are Alien's), or to capture an Alien, but to kill them.
6;"Bill Paxton is (unintentionally) hilarious as one of the soldier's, and has some of the more memorable quotes from the film:""Game over man, Game over!"""
7;Also, an absolutely touching relationship is developed between Ripley and a young girl survivor.
8;He says this is the best, and I'm pretty ready to agree with him.
9;I bought this recently because it is one of my favorites.
10;This is the Director's Cut, Dolby, Special Edition, THX, with Widescreen.
11;"It was directed and written by James Cameron
12;Michael Biehn (by far my favorite movie with him in it).
13;It looks great, the filming is spectacular, and you really cannot tell that the movie is 25 years old.
14;Huge science fiction fans, this was the first time my kids (3 teenagers) saw the movie and they loved it.
15;Really fun if you like horror, science fiction and intense creature films.
16;One of my favorite movies.
17;Performances are great and effects used don't overshadow what's happening in each scene.
18;A rare really good sequel!
19;This film is leaps and bounds above the original!!
20;In terms of action: Cameron turns the landscape into a giant connect four game board of catch between the crew members and the Aliens.
21;Her physical nature make Hamilton In T2 look lie lara Flyn Boyle.
22;This is the perfect action film with some of the most meomorable dialogue if film history.
23;Aliens will probably appeal to a wider audience than the original Alien.
24;It is slightly more optimistic and much more spectcular.
25;The special edition version adds to the first release, by giving the characters a little more depth and the continuity of the plot has been improved.
26;Sigourney Weaver does a great job of developing her character through the series becoming one of the most real movie characters I have ever seen.
27;I know I'm basically repeating what most of the other reviewers have already said about this film, but it is fantastic.
28;written, great cast, great characters, suspensful, action.
29;This is one of those rare sequels that surpases the original.
30;paced horror film (but a good movie nonetheless).
31;The film's whole visual and audio style make it utterly engrossing.
32;Sigourney Weaver delivers possibly one of the most convincing performances I have ever seen in a movie.
33;There are few sequels that are as good or even better than the first movie, and """"Aliens"""" is a great sequel."""
34;Once again she has to battle against the space creatures and an ambitious Company, which is ready to sacrifice human lives in order to get a powerful weapon (the monsters).
35;Aliens is the kind of film that you can watch over and over again and you will always discover something new.
36;"If you liked the first ""Alien"" movie, then the sequel ""Aliens"" is a must."
37;this Collector's Edition is stunning, the additional material is excellent, you can sit for hours watching the bonus disc.
38;"There are special features for almost every area in ""Aliens"": music, visual effects, casting, the making of the creatures, interviews, picture galleries, well, it's a lot of worthy material."
39;But on the other hand, the new version adds more scenes.
40;Anyway, if you like this movie, this Collector's edition is a must.
41;This movie has a combination of everything: Sci.
42;In fact, I consider it a legendary movie of the 20th century.
43;Aliens, the second of the series, is hands down the best yet.
44;i found that the extras were very insightful, with the design and creation of the Alien and the rest of the props .
45;gives you a better perspective on what goes into the making of the movie and it literally justifies the budget spent on it.
46;This is so far my favorite of the Alien series.
47;The fight scenes were really cool, intense, and wicked stellar, the Alien's themselves were scarier, nastier, and more vicious and bloodthirsty than ever before(as well as bigger and stronger!)
48;I loved the team that Ripley and Newt made(I love it when I see girlpower, being a female lover) and I thought the other soldiers were wicked awesome, especially with a large gun in their hands, be it flame.
49;Oh, and to you who love to curse, this movie had a lot more language than the first one!
50;Anyway, this is the second best space monster movie I have ever seen next to Predator 2, and I recommend it to all who like or love bloody and action packed science fiction movies.
51;"An excellent sequal to the first ""Alien"" movie, involving one of my favorite directors James Cameron."
52;"Aliens is literally explosive, not only does it have the same creepy aspects as the first Alien movie did, but ""Aliens"" is also an action packed spontanious combustion which never lets up!"
53;It was the perfect action adventure movie for the summer and it's the perfect action adventure now for someone who's seen it 1 million times or someone who's never seen it.
54;The acting is top notch for an ensemble cast of only one person that was a big star which was Sigourney Weaver.
55;Aliens special edition is a longer movie than the theatrical release and it's worth the 20 minutes that you have to watch the movie for.
56;What was cut from the theatrical version really did not impact the overall story but with the added material in the special edition you get a much more rounded movie.
57;As I said before the acting is top notch especially the character Newt.
58;She and Ripley played by Sigourney Reaver are what really makes the movie the interaction and especially the end of the movie.
59;Everything holds up in the movie and it should of been nominated for an Oscar for wasn't James Cameron didn't brilliant job of turning a war movie in an action adventure movie and putting them together into a seamless product.
60;Enjoy aliens and I highly recommend the sequels to it have a good day.
61;I love the scares, the one.
62;liners and the Never Say Die attitude of the stars makes for a great movie.
63;One of the best action movies ever made!
64;James Cameron and Weaver at the top of their game.
65;I'm a proud female and I was always taught that the main duties of women include cooking, making sure the family is content, making clothes and avoiding the work force.
66;Glad to see the restored intro scene where Newt's family rediscovers the aliens (the hard way), because I always enjoy Carrie Henn's scenes.
67;The first Alien was very unique, although it was more of a horror/sci.
68;Aliens, made in 1986, is action all the way!Ripley returns in this fantastic thriller, with a great supporting cast which includes Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn, Lance Hendriksen, and Paul Reiser.
69;Ridley Scott was smart not to show too much of the Alien, instead leaving its menace up to the viewer's imagination.
70;The alien spacecraft is a masterful piece of design concocted by H. R. Giger, and looks appropriately otherworldly lurking in the ominous background of the alien landscape.
71;Like its predecessor the film is a triumph of industry design and technology.
72;The film starts to look like one of those shooting games you play on the internet.
73;the most impressive thing about Aliens is the confrontation Ripley has with the queen alien.
74;Its movements are impressive considering it was probably moved with electric motors.
75;The final battle is impressively mounted and the Alien is dispatched.
76;I prefer the more subtle approach of Scott, than Cameron's more action orientated direction.
77;This is a classic movie and holds up very well.
78;Aliens is still a great ride and doesn't constantly remind the viewer that it is 25+ years old.
79;It's fantastic, but this version takes something away from the original.
80;for an action movie, this is also pretty suspensful.
81;In Aliens, there is a large cast, as well as an entire army of aliens.
82;The acting is great throughout the movie in terms of character development and dynamics.
83;Aliens is more than just an action film in a sci.
84;the special edition adds a 15.
85;minute scene with Newt and her family going on a field trip in an all.
86;This is one of his favorite movies, so he was happy to have another copy.
87;The alien series is one of the best sci.
88;If you haven't seen them I recommend it.
89;The whole series is the best sci.
90;If anyone has a suggestion respond to this review please.
91;it's a classic in the true sense of the word.
92;that tells you something right there.
93;Cameron's excellent film is now made even better by adding fundamental elements that make more of an emotional connection to Ripley.
94;"As Cameron says in the introduction (at least there's one on my quadrilogy set) ""this is the ride we intended you to take"" and what a far more richer ride it is."
95;"I absolutley loved Ridley Scott's 1979 classic ""Alien"", and hoped I'd love fellow cinematic genius James Cameron's 1986 sequel ""Aliens"" just as much."
96;"After all, the general consensus seems to be that ""Aliens"" is just as good, if not better, than ""Alien""."
97;"It turns that ""Aliens"" is indeed even better than the first one."
98;her family, her friends, everything.
99;It is soon discovered that Ripley was right about their being life on these lands, but this time the beast is far greater than what she faced previously.
100;"Blessed with the same courage and vulnerability as Ripley, the two form a bond that shows Ripley's soft side, and also shows how much of a badass she can be (the scene in which the alien is about to devour Newt when Ripley comes out in the steel body suit and bellows, ""get away from her, you b*tch"" has since become a classic)."
101;"i still absolutley love ""Alien"", but ""Aliens"" is by far my favorite of the two."
102;"With more chills, thrills and suspense than the first one, ""Aliens"" is a film you can never get sick of watching."
103;ALIENS in a perfect example of how a sequel should be made.
104;This movie has it all, top notch special effects, a thrilling story that never lets up once it kicks into high gear, and beautifully fleshed out cast of characters.
105;The might and firepower of the marines is outmatched by the resourceful aliens.
106;Ripley and a handful of survivors must struggle to survive and wipe out the alien onslaught before they can return to Earth.
107;if you are a fan of ALIEN then you will love ALIENS.
108;It is every bit as good as the original which is rare for a sequel.
109;I prefer part one,but this one is decent enough to see it,i mean if you've seen part 1 then might as well see part two,i didn't give it 5 stars because it seemed low budget at times especially on the special effects
110;"fi/action movie
111;The """"Special Edition"""" manages to remove (by adding scenes, ironically) most of the thrills and mystery."""
112;rather than letting the audience ponder them on their own and feel engaged in the storytelling.
113;If nothing else, it's interesting as a lesson in the invaluable contribution of editors to the art of filmmaking.
114;This is one is a must have movie for any new BD player.
115;In 1979 they created a movie that stunned people and changed the way we looked at space.
116;Great movie with superb casting.
117;This will go down as one of the most fun to watch sci.
118;Sigourney Weaver is tough as nails and the space marines all fun to watch!
119;People say that Terminator 2: Judgement Day was James Cameron's best film that didn't involve a big ass boat sinking, but this sequel to Ridley Scott's Alien shows the master at work.
120;The game Starcraft even has some of its design influenced by Cameron's film.
121;the acting by Weaver as Ripley and to a certain degree of Michael Biehn as Cpl. Hicks keeps the film from becoming all action and style, but no substance.
122;the action sequences doesn't let up one bit once it starts and this is where Cameron does his best work.
123;Aliens is pretty much an old.
124;cameron also took the concept of the alien and gave it more character and life.
125;In the original film, Scott's alien pretty much acted as some extraterrestrial boogeyman.
126;aliens qualifies as one of the best scifi.
127;I still think Scott's Alien is a much superior film overall, but for sheer rollercoaster fun Cameron's sequel is a close second.
128;My personal favorite movie is Aliens, followed by Alien at a close second.
129;Everything about this movie is perfect, from the acting, to the dialogue, to the special effects.
130;I highly recommend you watch this movie.
131;This makes a great movie even better (IMO)!
132;Great action scenes, great special effects(for the time) and great pacing.
133;You already seen the alien so it makes sense to put you face to face with it.
134;"So, we finally get a bigger picture of who the ""company"" really is, and what they will do to secure said alien."
135;What that means to us action fans is a lot, and I mean LOT, of firepower.
136;The action scenes are a delightful mixture of frenetic helmet camera shots and pretty good solid camera work.
137;fi fans, we have wonderfully detailed aliens here.
138;I loved how this movie played out.
139;The sequel has more aliens, terror, and heart.
140;pounding sequences than the original.
141;It's safe to say that Aliens encompasses Alien in every way possible, and the special effects work is spectacularly good.
142;Having Michael Biehn on board was the final nail on that thought, and he did a great job as usual.
143;Sigourney Weaver made an impression as the first female hero of Alien, but it's Aliens where she makes a indelible mark as the ultimate female hero.
144;There is a nice touch in the relationship between Biehn's Hicks and Ripley as he shows respect for her opinions and makes it count.
145;She was really awesome in Aliens, but it's Sigourney Weaver who takes the Top Dog award.
146;I could say, in other words, Aliens starts at the hour mark, and what I saw is brilliant.
147;"Of course, there is the old adage that ""Sequels suck,"" but Aliens is a rare film that is superior to its predecessor."
148;Aliens, The Terminator, The Abyss, and The Titanic have James Cameron a legend in special effects business because he is able to harness the power of CGI and use it blend in naturally with other certain elements and still deliver a very slick picture.
149;All in all, Aliens is among the best in the game and is one helluva flick.
150;I have always loved this movie.
151;I'm in my 30's now and I finally can fully love and understand this movie.
152;"smoking ""Sarge"", the comic relief wiseass, the hardcore street."
153;i will say that a few actors manage to create semblance of character and rise above the material (Michael Biehn as Private Hicks, Paul Reiser as company man Burke, and Lance Henriksen as android Bishop).
154;I remember going to see Aliens at the Movies back in High School.
155;I loved it soo much that I went out and bought the book and came across parts in the book, that of course were not in the movie.
156;Aliens Special Edition puts those parts back in and completely restores this movie to greatness.
157;The added scenes are everywhere in the Movie.
158;I won't try and spoil it for you but give you what you will see.
159;unlike the original and wonderful ALIEN, where the characters at least advanced the story, ALIENS introduces us to a cast of Hollywood.
160;Weaver's performance as Ripley is excellent and the writers manage to remain true to her character by giving her interesting things to say.
161;With decent special effects, nice editing and a story line that is basically intriguing, ALIENS is an entertaining popcorn movie despite its many weaknesses.
162;if you're the type of person who loves action movies simply for the flying bullets and cool special effects, I suspect you'll love ALIENS.
163;provoking, well written, classic science fiction films more in line with the original ALIEN, I think you'll be disappointed with this effort.
164;this is a clssic sci fi movie.
165;watching it on blu ray makes it even better.
166;As good as Alien was Aliens a little better.
167;Aliens also has a spot on my classic movie list.
168;The result is an extremly action packed film!!!!
169;Weaver even recived a best actress nomination.
170;Aliens was a great movie.
171;the music, story and special effects, not to mention the characters, provide what I believe to be incredible depth.
172;The special edition with it's extra footage (showing the discovery of the alien craft) adds so much more to the film and ensures that those who have not seen or remember Alien, will enjoy it.
173;you will see, hear and feel what it's like to punch it out of a reactor about to go critical.
174;This is among the best action movies ever made.
175;It has a great pace, once the action starts it never stops it only gets better.
176;Sigourney Weiver delivers a great performance as Ripley that ranks among the best conceived and most believable character in any sci/fi movie.
177;Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen are also great.
178;duty Action, but will also engross fans of sci/fi and suspense.
179;Probably James Cameron's best movie.
180;From a scale of 1.10 I give this movie a 9!
181;There are some extended scenes for the movie that actually add some depth to the characters.
182;This is a great movie that has classic Cameron action sequences and special effects, but also a frantic and claustrophobic atmosphere.
183;All of the acting is well done, namely Sigourney Weaver, Paul Reiser, Bill Paxton, and the little kid.
184;In case you were wondering, most of the restored footage has to do with the colonists early on and some pretty cool sentry machine guns about 2/3 through.
185;The key to its lasting appeal is found in its terrific design.
186;By doing so we feel like we are participants in this adrenaline pumping flick.
187;It ultimately emerges as one of the greatest creature features ever to hit the screen.
188;The Special Edition added a lot to the story.
189;I enjoyed this movie very much.
190;For any fan of the Aliens movies, or for any fan of good ole action flicks with its share of kokes, this is the movie for you.
191;fi/horror films of the 1950's (The Thing from Another World immediately comes to mind), Aliens is a classic sci.
192;Not nearly as scary as the Ridley Scott classic, it is nonetheless a superior movie.
193;And Aliens is by far the best action movie I have ever seen!It is very rare that one movie succeeds in combining action, thrills, emotions, and even a little humor with an exciting story, a well.
194;written script, good acting and very successful special effects.
195;fiction action film follows Ripley as she returns to the planet where she first encountered her first Alien creature.
196;Although, there are moments where things are intensely frightening.
197;Like the product review states, it's one of those rare cases when the sequel outdoes the original.
198;While the majority of the masses out there will mention The Terminator as being Cameron's claim to fame, I honestly believe this movie was.
199;overall, even though the original will hold a special place in my heart, Aliens is the best movie out of the bunch.
200;I'm a big fan of Special Editions.
201;The Special Edition for James Cameron's masterpiece of outer space terror, Aliens, is definitely worth the money.
202;All of the scenes restored here by Cameron actually prove to be vital in understanding the characters more, as well as getting a glimpse of the true relentless savagry of the xenomorphs.
203;handedly fought and won against 57 year prior.
204;adventure movie in a decade that defined the modern action.
205;so, what about =this= particular edition?For me, the extra 17 minutes underscored how tight and well.
206;freezing and the idea that she told her daughter she would be home in less than a year, what I was really impressed with was exactly how good a job the actors did conveying their bond =without= the exposition.
207;The seventeen minutes that were edited came from all over the film in tiny bits, so that very often you have to double.
208;The clarity of the picture and the depth of sound does justice to the original theatrical experience.
209;The first Aliens movie was my favorite and it was good to find it in this format.
210;It was delivered right on schedule and plays fine.
211;They also in no way help to understand the Alien creatures' objectives and intelligence.
212;and yet, the story is so told so well that these implausabilities do not interfere with our enjoyment of the movie until the third or fourth viewing.
213;This, of course, is one sign of a great movie to own, in that it yields new pleasures after the first viewing, even if those pleasures involve picking holes in the fabric of the world woven by Herr Cameron and his colleagues.
214;the aliens' total otherness can then be added to the fact that humans can literally be domestic animals to them.
215;and, it's possible that `Aliens' sets some kind of record in the swing of the situation between peril and expectation of relief.
216;Others have noted, and I agree that the intensity of this part of the movie is made even more gripping in that the situation puts a little girl in mortal danger.
217;I interpret this as an extremely successful application of the moviemaker's art.
218;The new added scenes range from interesting to breathtaking.
219;The creatures look amazingly icky!
220;The sound is 5.1 perfection.
221;The Cameron interview is very good (who is that interviewing him?
222;"The first movie in this series generated scares and some thrills
223;You can enjoy the movie without this information, but it is helpful, rounds out the narrative, and is good to see, at long last.
224;There is only a little collateral information, but the effects stuff is interesting, especially as a window into the past, where a big snazzy sci.
225;this is one of those rare scifi/horror movies that can take itself serious and get away with it.
226;it has so many great actors in it and they do a marvelous job of taking you where no person has gone before,introduce you to some genuinely terrifying aliens and get you off the planet again in one piece.
227;the special effects are out of this world(pardon the pun),the acting is for real.
228;it also has a wonderful special section which gives a slide show and a couple of short videos showing you the production procedure.
229;there is also a very nice section with still pictures of the cast and crew and also alot of background on the creation of the minatures used and even the making of the alien queen.
230;Very interesting stuff,especially for an Aliens fan.
231;And in a word it's brilliant.
232;The Behind the scenes and the Design Photographs are very revealing.
233;It does lack a commentary track but the interview with Cameron is a good alternative.
234;The picture and sound clarity are amazing.
235;Probably the crispest picture I've seen.
236;Great classic with tons of action and suspense.
237;I received this the 2nd day it was expected to come.
238;Special Features and deleted scenes are included and the menu's are very interesting, showing facts about the film such as weapons, armor, vehicles, the marines.
239;I myself is a aliens fan.
240;aliens is arguably one of the best sci.
241;intelligently written and superbly acted, it is one fast.
242;the rest is superb sci.
243;office truimph and critical success.
244;A classic film in my opinion.
245;it was nice to have the extended version that included the deleted scenes.
246;the extras and commentary were informative and interesting.
247;This film is always a treat to watch.
248;Whereas the first film was suspenseful and quite serious, this sequel is a wild ride filled with hot action and laughs.
249;liners to be enjoyed by all.
250;My favorite character just has to be Vasquez!
251;Aliens is the best of the four part series.
252;Sigourney Weaver and Bill Paxton make the movie the greatness that it is.
253;Alien was great, and so were the other two.
254;I would have to say, that Aliens takes the cake as the best of the series.
255;It always makes me mad to see how they get it.
256;And as Hudson would say, That's it man!
257;It's game over man, it's game over!
258;Having greatly enjoyed and admired Ridley Scott's superb Alien , there are some unsatisfying points about its sequel Aliens that deserve comment, especially considering the gratuitous and exaggerated praise that has been heaped upon it by the many.
259;This new Ripley is bristling with hostility and spite, and has no continuity with the character Ridley Scott gave us.
260;She reminds me of people who joyfully kill any snake, spider, or other animal they encounter that happens to earn its living by predation.
261;Alienation (how about that) is the new theme of the series.
262;Almost universally embraced and applauded by critics and audiences alike, Aliens is emblematic of how scifi films, once so enjoyable, have become monotonous exercises in technical effects and politically correct scripting.
263;For sequels, Alien deserved better.
264;Most people personally choose this as their favorite in the """"Alien"""" series."""
265;The APC, guns everywhere, flame throwers, movement sensor guns, and of course lots of focus on the movement detectors.
266;These really help build the movie and add a lot to the setting.
267;overall, this movie is a must see.
268;"Do yourself a favor and see the original ""Alien"" movie before seeing this."
269;The story is pretty simple and everyone should know it.
270;he knows how to make a movie for the action lover .
271;and make it good he does.
272;and has some great extras .
273;"When Ridley Scott released the monster of ""Alien"" back in 1979 a new legend was formed."
274;She soon discovers many new things about the creatures and soon finds herself battling survival with the group of marines.
275;A pretty cool storyline I think, and for an action sci.
276;"I haven't seen dropships in earlier movies, so this seems to be one of the very innovative and new ideas that ""Aliens"" brought to the genre of Sci."
277;The Smartgun makes its first appearance in this film, along with the Pulse Rifle.
278;"Smartguns are able to track and ""lock"" onto targets and also have advanced target."
279;the Aliens are kept strongly to the original design and the Queen is a very impressive specimen.
280;Cameron shows his genius as a director by keeping action realistic (in most cases) and his creation of mood and atmosphere through landscapes, lighting, characters, weapons and storyline.
281;"You really have to see ""Aliens"" to truly understand how truly revolutionary and incredible it is."
282;the movie is a refreshing Sci.
283;fi Action that is extremely innovative, dark and creative.
284;"Cameron has successfully expanded on the ""Alien"" franchise and has made a truly interesting and exciting movie."
285;The conflict between Ripley and The Queen near the end is certainly a highlight.
286;What kind of action is better, honestly?
287;"Aliens is a classic that joins the ranks of ""Alien"" as a classic Sci."
288;we're everywhere, and you never know when we may latch onto your face and plant eggs in your body.
289;Aliens gets a full 100% in my book.
290;"Today the storyline may not be highly original, but the creation of atmospheres, action, good acting, tension and creativity makes ""Aliens"" a true Sci."
291;Aliens was one heck of a cool movie!
292;The Action was very good, although you never really saw the Aliens actually kill a human very much!
293;The suspense was not as good as the first, but it still keeps you on the edge of your seat.
294;The absolute best Alien movie out there.
295;This is truly a classic and it looks amazing on blu ray.
296;If you've never seen this movie then what are you waiting for, the price is cheap and it is one of the best movie's of all time.
297;"as collector of good series movie
298;This movie is probably by far the most action with heroine packed, Marine.
299;By far my favorite even if I absolutely loved the first movie and truly enjoyed most the others.
300;This is a great follow up to the original classic.
301;The sound is incredible, and as others have mentioned the picture with the exception of some grain is perfect.
302;It got to the point I wanted the Aliens to get her just so shut her up.
303;I ordered this from Amazon so I knew it would be a great product and be here in 2 days.
304;fi movie, but still, it's AWESOME!
305;Better than the original, that's for sure.
306;Everything about this movie is pure greatness.
307;also there is a THX transfer that is magnificent and the anamorphic widescreen is a treat to watch.
308;fi/action movie in the tradition of Predator, Aliens is a superior choice.
309;Is the marginal return worth it, I ask.
310;i was told the extra footage is essential to understanding the movie.
311;There is also extra footage that better links Burke to the Station's initial demise.
312;do it, it's worth it.

317;It seemed like the film improved as I got further into it.
318;Flesh surfaces look rather good.
319;In 1979, the most terrifying film in Science Fiction history, known as ALIEN, was considered to be one of the best films ever made.
320;ALIENS was the sequel for James Cameron and it still carries the most terrifying edge as the first had done.
321;Floating around in space, Ripley is found and is taken to a medical health center, making sure that she is okay.
322;There at least 20 combats.
323;Bishop is a harmless droid, who is friendly with everybody.
324;She finds Newt and they head out on their way, but they run into the queen alien.
325;Bishop is fine, for his damages can be easily repaired.
326;if you enjoyed ALIEN, then you'll love its amazing sequel, ALIENS.
327;Featuring more scares, more hi.
328;This has to be the best of the Alien films!
329;The action is intense and scary and unlike many science fiction movies, the personalities of the characters are as important as the futuristic aspects.
330;The extra footage allows us to see the colonists as people with lives and concerns, so we care more about them than their role as infection fodder.
331;Some of the additional film gives us background on Ripley and her life.
332;This explains her emotional state and why she forms an immediate maternal bond with Newt.
333;Excellent film, great performances, great direction and fantastic design.
334;This is the best movie ever made.
335;This should have won an oscar award!
336;ray] (which you really should watch first) and, while I really like the first one, this is actually a more enjoyable movie.
337;The Alien movies are generally well done, exciting, and well acted, making them stand out from others in the genre.
338;This installment has slightly less of the creepy feel of the first movie, but makes up for it with strong character development and action.
339;The special effects are very good, even somewhat subtle and contribute to the realistic, industrial feel of the settings.
340;"this is one of those movies I can watch whenever it comes on and we occasionally have an ""Alien"" marathon once a year or so where we watch all of the movies in row over a weekend."
341;This was my favorite movie of the series!!!!!!!!!!
342;I highly recommend this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
343;Yes, it's great, and yes, it has aged well.
344;"ray ""seeing it again for the first time"" factor."
345;If you have a surround system, the audio clarity is amazing.
346;And even better, the fact that both Alien and Aliens are available on Blu.
347;It's got pace, action, intelligence and character, and then of course there're all those damn bugs.
348;Like its wonderful first cousin the James Wong TV series Space: Above and Beyond , this movie is first and foremost about people and warfare.
349;The creepy atmosphere, the cool technology and the faceless alien enemies just help to focus things a little more intensely.
350;In particular, I must admit to a huge soft spot for the cigar.
351;also does oily corporate guy Carter Burke really well.
352;line near the end of the film) in favor of professionalism, fear and just wanting to keep you and your mates alive.
353;They are a fascinating combination of insect, bondage outfit and carnivorous beast.
354;They are at once hugely scary and also visually compelling.
355;One of my fellow Aliens addicts pointed out that they are, in fact (at least in this film) sexy in the way that extreme danger is also sexy.
356;That combined with the horror of the way they reproduce and the ferocity with which they attack, and you have the perfect late 20th century non.
357;Better still, get your local movie art house to show it on the big screen.
358;Aliens: the Special Edition is a glaring example of this.
359;If you're a purist, steer clear of this one.
360;Really awesome and gives a more modern approach to the 25 year old movie.
361;The features are great, allowing the commentary to be toggled on and off during certain parts of the movie.
362;One of the most memorable lines from this modern day classic.
363;Director Cameron added an extra 17, or so, minutes of additional footage .
364;the video is crisp and the full vision of the Aliens' environment can be viewed.
365;The sound in the movie theatres made this movie one of the scariest action films of all time .
366;now we can enjoy the sound of the Aliens in our own home.
367;you may catch yourself look behind you to see if you can spot that Alien you just heard!)
368;It is always interesting to hear and see the movie being created.
369;ripley's character is expanded and Sigourney Weaver's performance is even better in this film than the first one.
370;It's more action than horror or science fiction but an exhilarating roller coaster ride of a film with deservedly award winning special effects.
371;the 17 minutes of additional footage in the special edition slows things down a little bit, but gives us important details which improves the over.
372;Aliens was the best one out of all four, I think.
373;Aliens was really cool because everyone was panicing which gave the film more suspense to it.
374;I own 1.3 of the Alien movies, but I love Aliens!
375;The facehugger scenes were great in it expecially.
376;i'm quite upset as this is such a great film.
377;This is one of the best sci fi films I've ever seen.
378;It's got tension, gore, excellent setpieces and some brilliant lines.
379;It's a superb film that can be watched over and over again.
380;Aliens is in my 10 Top all time favorite Science Fiction movies.
381;As he is the consumate Producer/Director as you can see from his other fine movies, Titanic and other sci fi movies.
382;bill paxton gives his best preformance ever!if you love action,aliens,gore,and comedy, you'll absolutly love this!
383;It is an awesome sci.
384;Sigourney Weaver lights up the screen with her stirring performance as Ripley.
385;I really love the final showdown with the Alien Queen.
386;There are good special effects, great action sequences, great acting and some pretty thrilling moments.
387;Because this is the real Aliens .
388;"the sequel, ""Aliens"" is nothing short of terrific."
389;Director James Cameron, of Terminator fame, does an incredible job with special effects, story telling, and character development.
390;For a film made in 1986, it is definitely up to par with todays action films.
391;The end sequence of Ripley vs. the Queen is excellent and I still get an adrenaline rush.
392;Additional features are interesting and include an interview with James Cameron.
393;Aliens is a rare sequel that to me is better than it's original and like I mentioned, in my top 5 films ever.
394;The film certainly gets your blood pumping.
395;ALIENS is my favorite movie of all times.
396;it has great actors,no fake looking things and is just too cool.
397;fi shocker delivered as promised, via up and coming director James Cameron.
398;I even managed to scope out some momentary nude cheesecake inside a marine's locker never noticed before.
399;That was great advertising .
400;timers an appreciation of just how far digital technology has enhanced a movie that was made a quarter of a century ago.
401;if you thought Aliens was a satisfying sequel back in the day, wait until you see it now.
402;This movie is definately the best in the series!It has even better effects and a more complex story.
403;another great thing is how cool the Alien queen looks!This movie has way more action then the first one and has a great climax.
404;the acting is also really great and has a few familiar stars in it besides Sigourney Weaver.
405;congrats to James Cameron for this great Sci.
406;Plus, Cameron's film shows more of the aliens in motion, and their agile leaping and lightning.
407;quick striking movements are fundamentally unsettling.
408;The marines' overconfident bravado proves to be their undoing.
409;I always thought it made for a more well.
410;But even with the extraneous footage, this film is top.
411;But it's a darn good one.
412;'Aliens' is a great film with thrills and intense action.
413;The srory is great and has great little twists.
414;The first is great too.
415;The acting is graet and the special effects are awsome.
416;Aliens is an awsome film wich will always be a classic.
417;James Cameron easily brings probably his best movie of his career to the screen while making the franchise a world wide million dollar hit.
418;This comes with great action sequences, nerve wrecking tension and special effects with fantastic performances by Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton as well as boasting a lot more action than the original Alien which is still a fantastic movie.
419;The theatrical version gives you the 1986 classic original and is great fun.
420;But the extended is far more entertaining with making a difference of about 17 minutes with more story and character design and of course more action.
421;This is an action adventure with some comedic and dramatic elements that make a cohesive and well.
422;The script is actually pretty great.
423;Lot of decent actors in here and though you might catch a corny line here or there the whole film is very well made.
424;Looks like a new film to me.
425;A slightly cooler push to the color timing results in a nice mood for this film.
426;well, you could ask for a completely recut Alien 3 with Fincher on board and new CGI.
427;That would really make the trilogy something neat.
428;It's best for most fans to forget the last two ever existed.
429;two classics have been redone and we can be thankful they took the time to do it right.
430;Aliens is my favorite of the Alien movies.
431;The added scenes add so much to the plot.
432;up to Ridley Scott's Alien is regarded as one of the few sequels that can actually hold its own with the original.
433;Obviously if you are a huge fan of the movie, you'll probably prefer this version.
434;The audio commentary brings a lot of insight into the film as everyone from director Cameron to special FX wizard Stan Winston contribute their memories.
435;Sigourney Weaver is noticeably absent but the entertaining members of the ensemble cast including Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, and Lance Henriksen make up for it with some hilarious stories and fond memories from the set.
436;Aliens was one of my favorite films for a long time.
437;I was always a fan of the new characters, especially Michael Biehn's Corporal Hicks and Bill Paxton's cocky but sometimes cowardly Hudson.
438;While I am far from one of the bigger Jim Cameron fans, I give him a great deal of credit for molding such an epic science fiction masterpiece.
439;The movie has survived the test of time very well though Cameron will be the first to complain about the picture's grainy feeling.
440;It's Worth Your Hard Earned Money.
441;I thought this sequel to Alien was a very good.
442;Usually when you have a sequel it does not compare to the first but this by far was a great movie.
443;I do recommend the Directors cut of this movie.
444;I also had nothing better to do that evening.
445;aliens is a worthy sequel to the original because nothing was compromised.
446;The story held true to the original and many questions were answered in Aliens that were not in the first one.
447;So well produced and transferred in real letterbox format.
448;it added more dimension to Ripley.
449;in all, Aliens is an excellent addition to any sci.
450;cool behind the scenes stuff, trailers, star bios, ect.
451;Worth the money for the extras alone!!
452;It was cool seeing the restored footage again.
453;As with the extra footage cut out of Terminator 2, Cameron had really good reasons to cut the extra bits out of the movie.
454;The second and last truly good Aliens movie.
455;Lots of good action, aliens, a great cast and of course I can't leave out the one and only Hudson.
456;He makes this movie for me.
457;Delivered on time, well packed, good condition, I just love this people and the movie too, it is funny and sentimental and action too.
458;This is the best sci.
459;It isn't no where near as dark as the first one and had a great script to back it up.
460;Segourney Weaver gives an outstanding performance along with Micheal Bein, Bill Paxton and Paul Rieser.
461;The scene where Ripley takes on the Mother Alien is thrilling on the edge of your seat entertainment.
462;Never really cared for S. Weaver, but Aliens has enough strong points to bring it to the top.
463;But if you are going to see one of the Alien movies.
464;now, this special edition director's cut comes out, and I usually don't like my favorite movies tampered with.
465;This is very worthy stuff.
466;One of my favorite movies ever in this genre.
467;This is better because it got extra features and scenes I have ever seen.
468;I bought used and discs and picture were perfect.
469;Great acting, award winning graphics and effects.
470;if you want science fiction, action, drama, suspense, comedy (a little) and to learn how a film SHOULD be made, this is the quintessential juggernaut of motion picture making.
471;The movie is just as incredible as it ever was.
472;perfect sequel that separated itself enough from the original to stand on its own merits.
473;ray transfer is the best I have seen so far (of course, I still have to open my Alien BD).
474;The clarity and depth of the image is stunning.
475;The image is rich and inky and just.
476;watched the LOTR Extended Edition BDs, I can say without hesitation that the picture on Aliens is superior in every way.
477;sound is also tremendous, though my set.
478;overall, watching Aliens again on BD was a thrilling experience, almost like watching it for the first time.
479;But Bishop is my favorite character played by Lance Henriksen who would later star in the grim horror film that I really love Pumpkinhead 1988.
480;Some say the film has a little to much action but there is still horror and suspense there which is why this is the best sequel of the franchise and I despise parts 3 and 4.
481;I love this film almost more than the original.
482;great copy, no problems with the disk.
483;Enjoyed seeing it again and again.
484;"While I will always appreciate ""Alien"" for the masterpiece that it is, ""Aliens"" is just more fun to watch."
485;Everything about it is thrilling, fast.
486;paced, with entertaining yet strong acting, and of course great monster action.
487;"The extended edition (aka ""The Director's Cut"") adds many great new scenes, mostly with the marines ."
488;Weaver, of course, does a splendid job, but I have to say that a very young Bill Paxton steals the show whenver he's on screen .
489;Hudson is a great character and really makes you laugh when you need to, and be fearful when you need to.
490;"Alien will always be the scariest of the series, but ""Alien"" is more clearly a horror flick."
491;"Aliens, with it's focus not just on the creatures but on the innovative vision of ""space marines,"" is more of a space adventure but with horror elements."
492;And it is a stand.
493;All in all, one of the best Sci Fi/horror movies ever .
494;we all know the story,and the disc is the extended cut which adds to the story even more.
495;Lots of action / FX with good comic relief by Bill Paxton.
496;Anyway, I guess it added to the suspense.
497;Now, she's Lt. Ripley, and she's now playing a determined marine soldier.
498;Her acting is amazing throughout the movie, especially the bonding with the young girl, Newt and the emotional aftermath from the horrifying experience in The Nostromo.
499;Such level of acting deserving earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress.
500;besides Sigourney Weaver's amazing feats, James Cameron's directing is amazing.
501;He led the entire cast and crew to their fullest potentials in creating his creative and original ideas.
502;He proves on Aliens that he is the master directing and producing science.
503;the visual effects and the sound effects are amazing!
504;The sound effect technicians deserving won an Oscar for their efforts.
505;The aliens and the eggs look very scary in credit of the great make.
506;The queen alien is the most amazing.
507;the plot was written wonderfully.
508;Few writers can master continuing the flow between one movie to its sequel.
509;Every line contains heave substance, keeping the audience's eyes wide open anxiously awaiting for the next scene.
510;The twists and turns between dramatic scenes and action scenes offer added watching pleasure.
511;There are many unforgettable quotes that the audience may continue repeating for days after watching the movie.
512;Aliens is one of the best movie sequels released in movie history.
513;Few others succeed this feat.
514;It offers added action versus the original.
515;The two movies, plus Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection offers the audience an explosive experience.
516;nice touch putting mike bihen in this one!
517;the reference to Cyberdyne systems first scene by lance henrickson was very cool.
518;makes her a perfect take.
519;bug hunt is about the funniest thing in the movie.
520;james cameron did a good job w these guys.
521;The picture is very sharp in some places, but grainy in others, expecially when the background becomes dark.
522;GREAT action movie, and one of my favorite Sci Fi movies.
523;James Cameron directed one of the most exciting and fascinating SF action adventure films ever made in Aliens.
524;The grisly antagonists drive the action with such relentless power that the screen seems to come alive with their swarming malice.
525;If you haven't seen it, see it.
526;If you've seen it already, see it again and tune into the finer cinematic touches that make the danger so palpable, especially the sound.
527;Aliens, from 1986, is that rarity in Hollywood, the successful sequel.
528;"Where ""Alien"" was largely a gothic horror flick, packed with suspense, ""Aliens"" is an action adventure, loaded with thrills."
529;She gets stripped of her command, demoted, and humiliated.
530;He wants Ripley to return to the alien planet.
531;the movie starts with a thrill a minute and works its way up.
532;Just more ugly critters, some of the best monsters ever designed, by the way, and more action.
533;It was the right route to take.
534;This is one film in either version that will definitely keep you awake.
535;As with the first film, I have to give it a 9/10.
536;But can this master of eye.
537;neck speed and featuring spectacular (and i mean SPECTACULAR) special effects, ALIENS manages to blend the science.
538;fiction film with the traditional shoot.
539;up with such ease and skill that the pace never drags a bit.
540;and the audience never gets a chance to breath.
541;Her impressive performance gained her an Oscar nod.
542;The rest of the cast sparkles as well with Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Al Matthews, and Jenette Goldstein as members of the gung.
543;This version of a classic sci.
544;fi action movie is the perfect example of a special edition version done right.
545;It adds small, key scenes throughout the movie adding to the emotional attachments to certain characters and better developing the plot.
546;If you liked Aliens in its original version, you'll LOVE the Special Edition.
547;fi/action movie of all time.
548;They aren't technologically groundbreaking, but they convey the atmosphere of the movie perfectly.
549;I was, and still am, extremely impressed with them.
550;I still have a soft spot for the original.
551;This movie is just as good now as it was then.
552;Viewing it again (I don't think I've seen it in almost 10 years) gives new appreciation.
553;I'm not sure if this was due primarily to technical issues or Cameron's direction, but I think the movie is much more powerful this way.
554;The aliens are sinister and organic, always scurrying in the periphery just before their attack.
555;fi action fans appreciate that they are watching a film that is worth being called One of the best action films ever made.
556;packed with explosive special effects and action scenes that will make the screen explode,Aliens is too much not to be remembered.
557;Stands the test of time, one of my top two sci.
558;The extra 17 minutes of the director's cut just adds more to the original movie version.
559;James Cameron proves that the sequel can be better than the original, and does so in spectacular style.
560;The history of the xenomorphs is fleshed out properly and the weapons and action sequences are absolutely stunning.
561;it is packed with action, cool effects, and convincing acting.
562;I enjoyed the first ALIEN movie, but not on as many levels as I enjoyed the sequel.
563;apart from the further development of Ripley's character, we got to learn more about the aliens themselves, and their insect mentalities, which was executed beautifully with the inclusion of a very convincing 'queen' alien.
564;this is james cameron's second best film, next to the terminator (not T2).
565;and the extra 17 minutes are excellent and add a great amount of understanding to the story, especially as to why ripley is so fond of newt, having not had a chance to see her own daughter grow up, she now has a chance with newt.
566;There are many differences between the first and second film, I think this is worth taking time to explain.
567;Aliens develops the characters and gets on with itself, making sequences long when it needs to, and making things pick up the pace when needed.
568;Using quick cut aways, and delicate camrea angles, Cameron makes the Aliens convincing, and scary.
569;almost everything in the film is perfect, and is definitely a must.
570;It has a lot of interesting information about how the movie was made and also gives us the selection of the two versions of the film.
571;One of the best films in Sci.
572;James Cameron does so much with so few resources and the acting is phenomenal.
573;This is worth every cent with out it, but if its there, we should know how to access it.
574;If you know how to do it, please let me know.
575;Cameron's breakneck pacing and a thunderous score by James Horner plus a good supporting cast led by Cameron regulars such as Michael Biehm and Paxton make this a memorable outing but I took off one star because of the two, I still prefer the first one.
576;the first in the series, as the best, as far as excitement goes, this has got to be it.
577;See the way the marines deploy, their firepower, the way they look .
578;Keeps you on your toes.
579;Aliens is one of the few films that can top the orinigal.
580;James Cameron upped the action and the scares for a sequel that still holds up today.
581;I loved the film Alien, but I thought that it's sequel, Aliens,was a more fun film.
582;But I always feltthe sequel was more fun, with tons of action and characterdepth.
583;My only complaint is that the picture/sound is notas good as it could be.
584;He already has the first Alien movie.
585;This is one of his favorite movies.
586;The added scenes that were replaced add even more depth to the character of Ellen Ripley and Sigourney was, shall I say, Awesome in these.
587;Ridley Scott's Alien is one of the Sci Fi/Horror genre's greatest films ever.
588;It set new standards at the time and has been a major influence on many films that have followed.
589;Being a fan of the original made me have very grave doubts indeed about just how good a sequel could be, let alone approach the standards of the original.
590;Aliens is simply that rare animal, a sequel that is better than the original.
591;along the way, Ripley takes an orphaned girl under her wing and their growing mother/daughter relationship is convincing against the backgound of what is going on, and becomes an integral part of the film's plot.
592;aliens is one of James Cameron's very best films.
593;It is an exhilerating ride from start to finish.
594;a must see film which I recommend very highly, indeed.
595;"Already a contender for the status of a legendary classic James Cameron's 1986 classic sequel to ""Alien"" entitled ""Aliens"" is a grand leap forward from the Ridley Scott original and adding a whole new dimension to the Alien saga while maintaining the thrills that made the original such a great movie."
596;57 years later after being the only survivor of the encounter with the alien creature, Ripley is found and rescued by a deep space crew and revived.
597;Ellen Ripley discovers that her greatest nightmare to date has come true.
598;The alien species is thriving well and killed all of the colonists except for one which is a little girl named Rebecca `Newt' Jordan who survived for over a year alone hiding in the complex ventilation systems of the buildings.
599;this sequel is arguably one of the greatest sequels ever made even to this day in so many ways.
600;The storyline is powerful and brilliant.
601;I really love the way that this movie builds up in suspense in the first half and then is almost non.
602;the characters are very well defined and show enormous personality.
603;First off James Cameron was the perfect choice for directing this movie.
604;The special effects are stunningly amazing, brilliant and rich in detail and don't look dated at all and this is taking into account that CGI didn't exist back at that point in time.
605;the aliens in this movie looked so much more realistic and far more terrifying than the one in the first one.
606;The Alien queen is the best alien creature out of all four of the entries in the saga and the egg.
607;I loved the way all of the equipment and the weapons that the Space Marine crew had looked like.
608;the acting by the entire cast is incredible.
609;James Cameron's work on making the characters really honest and vivid paid off on here.
610;Ellen Ripley is the greatest action movie heroine of all time.
611;"Of all of the movies I've seen Sigourney Weaver star in, ""Aliens"" remains her best role to date as of writing this review."
612;Her acting on here is legendary and Ripley acting as a surrogate mother to the sole survivor of the colony Newt is powerful.
613;Starring in her only movie role, Carrie Henn at only around ten years is the best kind role of any movie I've ever seen.
614;Newt in a way is very chilling to watch and even scary sometimes considering how she survives for so long in the colony alone with the aliens lurking around.
615;Michael Biehn as Corporal Hicks is amazing as well.
616;Paul Reiser as the traitorous Burke is great as well.
617;Although nowhere near as prevalent, Jeanette Goldstein is an awesome riot as the fiery.
618;Watching her in this movie is so much fun and she shows lots of spunk and attitude.
619;The original version benefits from both improvements.
620;One scene in the extended edition warrants seeing the 1991 edition as it really expands on Ripley's checkered past.
621;the second disc is also a treasure to gain a hold of as well.
622;One of my favorite bonus features is seeing how they made all of the awesome sets especially with the alien queen and how they made it look so realistic when Ripley shoots the grenades at the egg.
623;The one with the human robot that Ripley uses to battle the alien is also really spectacular and how they filmed it was really worth seeing.
624;The second disc also contains great commentary by the cast and crew of the making of this set and how they look back on it today.
625;It's really funny to watch.
626;There are hours of other features on here that are worth seeing.
627;this movie had a lot to live up to considering the great scales of its predecessor but it not only did that but it surpass it to become what is arguably the greatest sequel of all time.
628;"This is likely one of my favorite sequels of all time alongside ""Terminator 2"" which was also directed by James Cameron."
629;Note that Ridley made another of the 10 or 15 best sci.
630;fi movies ever made, Blade Runner.
631;This James Cameron (and who is more fitting to follow Ridley Scott in this sci.
632;"techno thriller is every bit as gruesome good as its predecessor
633;Yeah, this is one fun flick.
634;(Weaver is, once again, fantastic.)
635;She teams up with a hearty band of space marines (Hoo.
636;and returns to the planet where all the fun first began.
637;The supporting cast is great, including Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, Paul Reiser, and a young Bill Paxton as a wide.
638;Cameron delivers suspense, special effects, and heart.
639;pounding action by the boatload, including an ingenious battle between Ripley (inside a hydraulic lift) and the queen alien that's every bit of sensational.
640;This move began my love for alien monster movies (well Alien actually but this is better).
641;All you need for a great Horror Masterpiece!
642;The spine tingling film Alien had viewers squirming in their seats and jumping out of them as they watched an alien beast terrorize a spaceship.
643;Aliens brings you back to the planet where it all started, but fifty years in the future.
644;i love how this movie slowly builds"
645;And when the fighting finally breaks out, the action flows nonstop.
646;You really feel for all the characters and sympathize with them, and they act like real humans would.
647;"The acting is great
648;The character of Bishop was acted wonderfully.
649;He's an android who always seems like he has something hiding up his sleeve.
650;i really must complement this film's special effects also.
651;The aliens look very real and very menacing.
652;The set design was great, all the way from the spaceship's mess hall to the corridors of the colony.
653;the ending to the film is genius, but it leaves you wanting more of a conclusion.
654;James Cameron has combined the elements of suspense and fear with intense action sequences taking the viewers on one hell of a ride.
655;James Cameron takes over Ridley Scott's position from the first Alien, and makes a sequal just as worthy as the original.
656;while this particular edition contains both the theatrical release and the special addition of the film, I prefer watching the special addition.
657;in addition to the marine firepower concept added to this film, there are other things that have expanded from the first Alien.
658;My favorite is the introduction of the alien queen, who can be seen again in Alien:Resurrection and AVP.
659;This is my favorite film featuring the queen.
660;its difficult to say if you are a fan of the original Alien that you will love this sequal, but it is a great sequal that brings huge new ideas to the franchise.
661;If you want to see lots of menacing creatures getting wiped by a group of marines (and marines getting wiped by them) this is possibly the best film ever made to showcase that.
662;this time she has a unit of Colonial Marines.
663;This is probably my favorite movie of all time.
664;The characters are done remarkably well.
665;The art is spiffy as well.
666;The weapons, vehicles, gear, and environments are downright believable for near.
667;The battle scenes are well done, and the aliens themselves.
668;This has gotta rank up there with """"Die Hard"""" as one of the greatest action movies of all time."""
669;Although the Director's cut fleshes out some much needed detail it is inferiour in photography and style to the other three.
670;James Cameron is a maker of expensive enjoyable B movies.
671;Best Sequel ever in my opinion.
672;It took many years later for Alien 2 or as it was labeled Aliens to come out, but the wait was worth it.
673;it how this movie should always be seen!
674;fun thrill ride when it came out, and it's even better in a dark room now!
675;The best of the BUNCH.
676;gun chaos, it still manages to feel akin to its predecessor via more than a monster suit and lead actress.
677;While Aliens doesn't take as much time to appreciate the sights, they're still around, and they remain excellent examples of on.
678;spinningly cheeseball, the film is still a success.
679;How much of that is due to its young director's touch, rather than the power of the galaxy that had been established in the original, is open for debate.
680;Excellent adaptation of this movie to Blu.
681;The audio was excellent, and takes full advantage of a surround system with subwoofer.
682;and Bishop goes so fast between each finger that it's hilarious.
683;"The Special Edition I give 4 just because, once we get through the ""extra"" footage, most of which is early on, the movie still rocks."
684;I got my wife to watch the first one, and she loved it (and does not like horror), this one was equally well recieved, and she marvelled at the difference between them.
685;This movie is action packed scary and amazing for a movie in it's time(1986).
686;fi this movie is amazing.
687;I recommend this movie to fans of Alien or sci.
688;Aliens is one of the best movies out there!
689;Better in my view than the first.
690;There is an adoption theme going on here, and the producers seemed to have to mark Weaver as heterosexual for some silly reason.
691;But it has some of the scariest, tense, and utterly chilling scenes in US film making.
692;It may not be the first one but it is a very good sequil anyway.
693;Every scene is my favorite scene.
694;the action is great the marines are tough!
695;Each character was well portrayed and Bill Paxton is the comedic relief~!
696;seat cinema at it's finest.
697;and a few others that will make you do a double.
698;the visual effects are astounding.
699;(I can finally read what is written on Ferro's helmet!)
700;fi film I always enjoyed, film grain in areas but otherwise great.
701;top,root for the good guy style writing.
702;Aliens is a example that it could be done.
703;from the opeaning sceen you are held in compelling suspence that last the whole 2 and half hours without it ever letting up.
704;Sigourney Weaver deilevers a fantastic performance.
705;fi/action flick without the heart and soul of the original.
706;Few characters stand out or are memorable.
707;What propelled this film forward was the imminent sense of danger and breakneck speed of all the action sequences.
708;I like this movie, but I love the first.
709;I always thought Aliens was an excellent movie, a great combination of action and sci.
710;I feel that this is a Special edition that is even better than the original.
711;james Cameron's 1986 sequel to the classic Ridley Scott 1979 original Alien movie is impressive in so many ways.
712;this movie is absolutely amazing to the tenth power!!
713;The acting is absolutely incredible, the story is perfect, the sets are amazing, EVERYTHING is near perfection!
714;The special effects are really excellent as well.
715;I consider this movie excellent and was very pleased to be able to watch it.
716;One thing that I like about James Cameron is that he does something that we see very little of.
717;And what's surprising is this: IT WORKS!
718;Before I saw Aliens, I was a huge fan of the movie Predator.
719;I still think that's a good movie, but I like Aliens just as much and even better in some respects.
720;For one, I thought that the storyline was very tightly woven.
721;That battle between machine and alien at the end is breathtaking.
722;Cameron also succeeded in setting the atmosphere.
723;I found it very reminiscent of the atmosphere in The Terminator.
724;There are some very good action scenes in this movie as well as some good one.
725;So excited this movie is on blu.
726;One of John Cameron' s greatest, scariest movies.
727;"Sigourney Weaver triumphantly returns as Ripley in James Cameron's ""ALIENS."""
728;"ALIENS is 1,000,000 times better than ""ALIEN"" and is filled with marveolus punch lines and scares!"
729;James Cameron really serves up a treat!
730;All of these actors are brought together for a wonderful movie that will have you on the enge of your seat til the very end.
731;The extra footage adds to the movie.
732;(Review based on director's cut version) Aliens is the only true masterpiece in the entire Alien series as it not only sustains nerve wracking tension and explosive action, but also takes time to develop the characters and create dramatic depth.
733;aliens takes place 57 years after the original.
734;She is found by a salvage crew and tells her story to company officials.
735;the aspect of Aliens that most everybody loves this film for is the action.
736;Most of it doesn't actually begin until the last 45 minutes of the film but it's truly exciting, tense, and non.
737;Particularly, the best sequences are when the aliens chase the remaining humans into small tunnels and when Ripley arms herself to the max and rescues Newt.
738;Director James Cameron established himself as a true action auteur with this film and it's easy to see why he's so revered by legions of fans.
739;there's a deep dramatic depth in this film along with character development.
740;There's three very interesting relationships that develops from Ripley to Newt, Hicks, and Bishop.
741;After the death of her daughter, Ripley finds solace and comfort with Newt, who also likes Ripley's company.
742;Another relationship that develops is between Ripley and Hicks.
743;It's all quite subtle but it's actually very fun to watch.
744;The other interesting development is between Ripley and Bishop.
745;She dislikes Bishop at first but it's easy to tell she admires him by the end.
746;all the performances in this film come off strong.
747;Weaver is the best as she creates a strong and take charge heroine.
748;Her character is a lot more complex than what is portrayed in Alien.
749;Michael Biehn is very good as Corporal Hicks, a brave but far from gung.
750;Also delivering good performances are Carrie Henn, Lance Henrikson, Bill Paxton, and Jenette Goldstein.
751;But he's actually quite caring and is perhaps the most trustworthy of the entire marine crew.
752;once again, like the first movie, the special effects are excellent.
753;also noteworthy is a fine musical score from James Horner.
754;paced, and fits the tone of the film just fine.
755;if you have never seen any films in the Alien series, I would recommend you begin with Alien, a pretty good and decent (though not spectacular) horror space opera.
756;This is a brilliant film by James Cameron, who seems to have a natural talent for making some of the humans worse than the Aliens.
757;The cinematography is top notch, the script is outstanding, the characters are so real you think you know them, and the emotional adrenaline refues, in most places, to let you get up and pee.
758;Even years later it outshines as a good scfi action strong female lead film.
759;James Cameron knows how to entertain and Sigourney Weaver is a tough cookie.
760;Of the Alien trilogy (if you don't count Resurrection), this is by far the best of them.
761;James Cameron presents a seamless unfolding of Ellen Ripley's second harrowing encounter with the species that is out to consume every human it finds on planet LV.426.
762;Sigourney Weaver gave a wonderful performance in the first film and tops it in the second as she struggles between the aftereffects of her first encounter and the rapidly unraveling circumstances of the second encounter.
763;It's made more interesting by the relationship that develops between Ripley and a young girl (Carrie Henn) who manages to survive the aliens' decimation of her family and colony.
764;Visually stunning but with just enough haziness in the alien scenes to give viewers the freedom to engage their imaginations in the experience.
765;The script is classic Cameron.
766;The ensemble cast is right on point.
767;Editing and scoring fit like hand in glove.
768;Aliens is an extraordinary film.
769;The effects are still impressive, which is the one area that concerned me.
770;in this CGI world, I found this film even more impressive.
771;It felt authentic, whereas Prometheus felt like CGI and never felt quite real to me, even though I admit I like that film.
772;But Aliens works so well because the danger is palpable.
773;sigourney Weaver is just as good here as she is in Alien (both are Oscar worthy performances).
774;And Bishop and Burke are both very well played by Henriksen and Reiser.
775;i also liked James Horner's score, even though I understand it was not a fun working relationship between him and Cameron.
776;Aliens is one of them.
777;It remains one of the scariest, intelligent, hold.
778;"But, for a movie to be truly terrifying, to the point that the audience is ""involved"", well."
779;Sigourney Weaver is incredible as Ripley, in this sequel which is far superior to any in the series.
780;"Her ""Rambo"" like, but still feminine turn in this role was as unique then, as now, for female roles, and is totally convincing."
781;The supporting cast are all equally believable, Paul Reiser especially so as the definitive corporate slime.
782;"Aside from Weavers ""Ripley"", I found the character of Vasquez, the super."
783;testosterones the men and monsters, to be one of the most memorable characters in this film, or any of it's kind, and her performance gives Weaver a run for her money.
784;The unique, eerie music scored for this film only increases the sense of foreboding which never let's up.
785;There are many memorable scenes, the climactic to.
786;"death battle between Ripley and the ""Queen"" alien, as Ripley defends the life of the orphaned little girl, being one of the most memorable, and, for my vote, the most awe."
787;inspiring in motion picture history.
788;This is a film that will impress even non.
789;fi/horror fans, with its' intelligence, story, and, oft.
790;"All together, they make one of the most memorable movie experiences, that transcends its' ""genre"", and is ,simply , one of the best movies of the last 20 years."
791;You knew then it was an immediate classic, and it has remained so.
792;"Although it lacks the atmospheric dark ambience of the original (""Alien""), it more than makes up for it by way of suspense and action."
793;This is probably the best one of the series.
794;A film is edited to become a better than originally set.
795;Very touching and it didn't interfere with the depth or mystery later.
796;wearing a bold face for such a simple thing.
797;A cute insecurity of hers.
798;They've known each other by their last names, and now it gets more personal.
799;and Hicks gives his first name with a smile, like telling her in a kind way not to be shy about it.
800;He's awesome and always full of verbal volume.
801;Drake would have done a knockout job too!ALIENS is the best movie I'll ever own.
802;Aliens is one of James Cameron's finest, and one of the best movies ever made.
803;This film is a wonderful blend of sci fi, horror, action, comedy and drama, seamlessly combined to make one near perfect movie.
804;the film is also unique in that it is far superior to its original, Alien, which itself was a good sci fi horror movie.
805;It's rarity for a sequel to surpass the original.
806;the film is perfectly cast, well acted, with great set design and special effects, a perfectly fitting musical score and an excellent plot.
807;Its especially fun on a movie like this to see the extra scenes, cause its a little more of the story you were never told.
808;Alien was an interesting contrast to Star Wars.
809;Alien had a lot of good hard nosed reality to it.
810;Alien saw a group of people fight and die due to human weaknesses and strengths.
811;they shifted from the miner's hard life to the Marines and succeeded in watching a non.
812;Aliens also had an interesting survivor in a little eight year old girl Nute.
813;She also led the Marines in how to survive the aliens, for a little while at least.
814;bill Paxton from Terminator gives another great performance of a punk.
815;He's absolutelly hillarious in both Terminator and Aliens!
816;Michael Bien also comes from Terminator to give another good performance to fight off something bigger than a human.
817;Another James Cameron find and favorite was introduced in Aliens, Jenette Goldstein.
818;"She also later appreas in Terminator 2 and Titanic!No movie or book is perfect
819;There's not much to find fault with the move though"
820;aliens got more action and all the stuff on the space and the aliens are really well done for the year when it was created.
821;this movie is as classic as the first classic one!!!!!
822;This movie is absolutely fantastic for blu.
823;I had loved this movie since I was twelve.
824;So it was very nice to see the additional footage added to help flesh out an already excellent movie.
825;Well its the best science fiction movie in my book anyway.
826;The technical and special effects aspects of this movie have made it a classic.
827;The acting and story is also great.
828;There is just something about this movie that amazes me.
829;James Cameron is a true visionary.
830;It is more atmospheric and mysterious and really sets the tone for the series.
831;Aliens is an exciting, more action packed, thrill ride, and it is really fun to watch.
832;he is an interesting character and what a great actor.
833;The last 35 minutes of the film is the best part and is done amazingly well special effects wise.
834;The special effects in this film are almost all practical effects (not cgi) and they look completely believable!
835;An excellent sequel, but, still, the first film is definitely the best in the series.
836;And the movie on the whole is pretty rad.
837;James Cameron brings his movie magic to this series and makes it explode into something that is unspeakably excellent.
838;It has action and a great story, the two things that I always go for.
839;All of the actors are really good and improved over those who were in the previous.
840;Ok, I've said I love this movie before, but that's not what I'm here about.
841;"The Nostromo is named after his book, called, well, Nostromo 
842;The only good things about it is Bill Paxton is fun to watch and there are a few neat special effects.
843;Do yourself a favor and watch the original Alien, again if you have to.
844;One of the world's BEST ever science fiction alien movies.
845;James Cameron directed it, so the characters, screen play, and set are all excellent.
846;We'll keep this one simple:.
847;'Aliens' is the greatest action movie of all.
848;It's one of the more unremittingly intense movies of all.
849;'Aliens' is an absolute masterpiece of practical special effects.
850;The combination of all the disparate elements may not be completely seamless, but it's surprisingly close, and a helluva lot more convincing than the total CGI films inflicted on us so much nowadays.
851;jerk opposed to CGI people.
852;it's got some atypically memorable good characters and acting for an action/sci.
853;Yeah, many of them are kinda cliched, but they're good well.
854;Weaver really comes into her own as Ripley, making her quite a bit more interesting and likable than she was the first time around while still basically seeming like the same person.
855;Furthermore, Michael Biehn and Lance Henricksen give their definitive performances.
856;For years, I seen the movie, Aliens.
857;I am happy because now, I can enjoy Aliens in English and in Spanish!
858;I loved this movie in the theater.
859;I bring this up to point ut how engrossing the film was.
860;The extra scenes increased the character development,and made this movie even better than before.
861;Intriguing characters and the action and suspense never lets up!
862;deserved Best Actress Oscar nomination.
863;james Cameron masterfully choreographs a decent into the bowels of a planet taken over by a demon monster and her brood (and there are many of them in this one).
864;The movie is an emotional roller coaster ride and at the same time, a well.
865;The special edition has 17 minutes of restored footage.
866;The best film in Alien series.
867;And also the best film in sci.
868;All the Alien fans, like me must have it.
869;There's special effects too (in which case DID win the Oscar for that category) which are simply stunning for its time.
870;A notorious perfectionist, he has remarkably turned the aliens into a frightening revelation, and let's not forget to credit the design of those horrendous creatures to H. r. Giger.
871;One of the themes of this movie that some people probably overlook is that of feminism.
872;i have to say, though, being a guy and all, I loved watching the marines, their camaraderie, tough.
873;guy attitude, especially Hudson right before he goes down, that alone is a treat to watch!It's amazing that Cameron infuses such a powerful theme (never mess with mama) and yet is able to create such a enjoyable masterpiece that I never get tired of watching.
874;Aliens is the sequel to the incredible masterpiece, """"Alien,"""" and what a sequel it is."""
875;This sequel doesn't have the same feeling as the first one, but it is, without doubt, a superb action film.
876;although it is expensive, this set contains both the original and the special editions, the latter of which is considered to be the definitive one, and a large number of special features to browse through.
877;"the story line stays very true to the original, displaying excellently the frail and tormented mind of Ripley, who, upon being picked up 57 years after the events of ""Alien,"" tells her story to ""The Company"" and, seeing as the ship, and the alien, have been destroyed, is regarded with disbelief and is stripped of her pilot's license."
878;fi heroine, it was also the first sci.
879;"fi film to garner a ""best actress/actor"" nomination at the oscars."
880;"Although not as suspenseful as the original, ""Aliens"" loyaly continues the ""Alien"" story with commendations all around."
881;This was the best of the alien trilogy.
882;It has awsome action, great plot, and fabulous acting.
883;To me, this is the best of the 4 movies.
884;I have always liked this film and enjoy watching it time and time again.
885;ray is pretty good, with some minor grain throughout.
886;For me it is definitely worth having.
887;I prefer the extended version myself.
888;I'm sure you will like it.
889;That's my best guess as there are a few laserdisc type pixel sparkles early on in the movie.
890;The 80s have a special corner on classic films that will survive the ages, and Aliens is one that sets the highest bar for science fiction!
891;"It was really great to see the actors all these years later, including Carrie ""Newt"" Henn all grown up."
892;It's pretty rare to find a commentary that's almost more entertaining than the movie itself, but this absolutely is.
893;I'm a creator and a dreamer and a writer and a gamer who appreciates art for what it is, and for what it is meant to be.
894;"the psychological impact and emotional punch of this movie is (or can be) strong
895;At its core, it's just what I said it is: an R. rated sci.
896;but one that certainly packs a wallop of (good) baggage along for the ride.
897;like Blade Runner (1982) before it, Aliens (1986) was a highly influential film whose impact resonates to this day in Hollywood and in world cinema.
898;shocked) trooper, the motion detector and the high.
899;I think Bungie was simply paying tribute to an influential film.
900;on), then you will enjoy Aliens.
901;James Cameron (also of Terminator (1984), Titanic (1998), and Avatar (2009) fame) made one of his best with Aliens"
902;Aliens is one of the all.
903;"time great ""monster from outer space"" movies, in my opinion, so I picked this Blu."
904;Better than Ridley Scott's original, and I don't say that about many sequels.
905;Beautifully shot with wonderfully dark and claustrophobic cinematography.
906;Sigourney Weaver's performance is sublime, and you can tell she takes her craft very seriously.
907;James Cameron's direction is taut and soaked in adrenalin.
908;"It's nice that there are two versions of the movie to choose from
909;There's a lot of grain in many places.
910;The deleted scenes are always fun to watch, and gets you playing the """"what if"""" game ."""
911;The isolated James Horner scores are nice to listen to, though.
912;overall, a great movie and a solid product.
913;If your main motivation is just purchasing the movie and not worrying about a lot of extras (as it was for me), this will do you nicely.
914;Serious fans of the franchise may well wish to invest in theAlien Anthology [Blu.
915;ray], which has a lot more supporting material.
916;The film opens with a salvage crew opening up the shuttle and finding her and the cat!
917;what follows from there is one of the best and most intense Sci.
918;I found that the THX and 5.1 Surround worked quite well for this film.
919;The seventeen minutes of the restored footage for this film is quite seamlessly added to film and serves extremely well in enhancing the experience of this movie.
920;highly recommended for fans of Sigourney Weaver, science Fiction, and good action movies.
921;disc 1 allows you to play both the theatrical release of the movie as well as the Special Edition.
922;The Special Edition also lets you toggle the Special Edition markers that display on screen when you are viewing deleted material.
923;"of"" featurette featuring interviews with a lot of the people involved in the film."
924;It also includes pictures, additional footage, and the original script.
925;The extras are very interesting to anyone who is interested in the process of filmmaking and the opinions of the actors and crew who were involved in the process.
926;millions of people watched this movie and are still in love with it (like me).
927;Aliens, plural, takes us forward some years from Alien, singular.
928;A rescued Newt (young girl), Ripley and her new best friend, Bishop, eventually make it out only to .
929;This has to be one of the best action movies ever!
930;Even though this movie came out in 1986 this movie holds up suprisingly well.
931;This is without a shadow of a doubt one of the best sci.
932;Like the 1st movie as well, I this is one of those classic hits that I always upgrade to a new viewing format after it's been release.
933;at least once I have the means of playing said new format, and I was stoked to finally get this and the first Alien movie on Blu.
934;The 2 combined, also, make for a great mini marathon.
935;There are awesome movies folks, and if you enjoy good sci.
936;the best out of the trilogy.
937;the portrayal of the Colonial Space Marines was by far the most realistic depiction of grunts I've ever seen,and was right on the money.
938;i've read that a Director's Cut is in the works and will show the cocooning of Apone Deitrich.
939;Aliens is in my opinion a lot better than the original and is one of my top sci.
940;this movie is so great because the aliens are actually really realistic.
941;This was made 19 years ago and it's still a freaky movie with some terrifying aliens.
942;I mean they are wonderfully made.
943;The ending is awesome with some fantastic action scenes.
944;James Cameron takes Ridley Scott's Alien and totally runs with it turning everything up to 11!
945;Nothing against the original, but Aliens is so good I can't stop watching it every time I see it on TV.
946;weaver, Biehn, Paxton, et al, do teriffic jobs in their roles.
947;The behind the scenes footage is a wonderful addition, as well as the still photos.
948;Even the interactive menu is well thought out and very cool.
949;I've watched it many times and still enjoy it.
950;I just love the Aliens series.
951;what a concept and beautiful ,believe able cinematography!lets have some more of these.
952;please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.Yeah, this is a great one.
953;The first one was great, this is even better.
954;Except no, this was also very, very powerful.
955;Its the sets, the actiing, and the flow of this movie that puts it in a class with raiders and empire.
956;The special effects won an acadamy award, Sigourney Weaver was nominated for best actress, and the script was flawless.
957;Everything about this film was superior!
958;That should tell you how phenomenal it is!
959;i also enjoyed the relationship between Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and Newt (Carrie Henn).
960;Paul Reiser and Michael Biehn also shone in this picture.
961;When a sequel is so many times better than the original, it's hard to believe that the first was so exciting and pioneering.
962;James Cameron, fresh from his groundbreaking Terminator, proves he was no one.
963;hit wonder by maintaining the perfect balance of action, suspense and sub.
964;Bill Paxton plays Hudson, the wimpiest but most likable Marine ever in movies.
965;cameron assaults us with so many shocks and stingers and keeps us on the edge of our seats for well over two hours.

967;The props (and there's a ton of them) are all great.

974;All the alien movies are epic sci.
975;fi masterpieces,with plenty of action and very good storyline and acting.
976;I can't believe anybody would bag on the first Alien movie, Aliens is so excellent, but the first movie is incredible.
977;Alien V has potential, as long as it includes the Alien home planet, we'll see if it ever makes it out.
978;i also don't understand why they waited so long to make a sequel since the first one was such a huge hit.
979;Aliens along with Terminator 2 is a sequel that far surpasses the original.
980;Everything about this movie is amazing, once the suspense starts the movie becomes almost unbearable, it is so intense that you almost can't stand it.
981;It's ironic that both Aliens and Terminator 2 are both directed by the great director James Cameron.
982;If you enjoy science fiction and fantasy movies then you will most certainly enjoy this one.
983;james Cameron's script really captures the mood and he creates a fine ensemble of characters played by competent actors such as Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton.
984;Even Weaver's character Ripley is still relatively fresh and interesting at this point in the series.
985;The film trades a lot of the quiet, chilling suspense of the original Alien for gun.
986;clever and original plot, this is arguably Cameron's best film.
987;if you liked the first Alien movie, this one is a must.
988;Prepare your heart for some thrill and get ready to have some FUN!
989;Alien was a brilliantly claustrophobic film, a haunted house in space, so to speak.
990;the movie opens with a silent spaceship, the escape.
991;Such is the way this billiant movie is set up.
992;There are gradually more and more signs of hostile action until the first contact with the aliens, after which its all white.
993;The characters are all flawlessly portrayed, evoking real feeling from the audience.
994;The action seqences are all wonderfully choreographed and edited, the aliens fierce and gruesome, the future technology practical and engaging, the music brilliant.
995;Be sure to watch the Special Edition, as it adds even more human element (another well.
996;handled factor I beleive I forgot to mention) and some really neat action sequences.

1009;This is the one you want!
1010;Since I was a young lad, I enjoyed this movie start to finish.
1011;Anyways, watching the film as a child I was intrigued by the action scenes and the amazing suspence.
1012;Now I watch it for the same reasons aforementioned, but also enjoy it for it's originality and symbolism.
1013;The entire movie is like a tribute to his experinces in Vietnam.
1014;I enjoy every minute of this film now as I try to compare it to Vietnam (call me a freak please).
1015;The effects still look good apart from the shuttle craft flying, which they could easily clean up for the 20th anniversary edition.
1016;for me, it was a good old fashioned suspense film that integrated Science Fiction and the military quite nicely.
1017;The result was a tight story that moved well, despite the fact that the theatrical version was over two hours long.
1018;It also featured a new twist in the casting of a woman (Sigourney Weaver) as the reluctant hero Ellen Ripley.
1019;"Paul Reiser is completely convincing as the consumate company man, and we even get a cameo from ""Jonesy"" the cat from the first movie."
1020;excellent movie that won't dissapoint you and leave you drained from the suspense.
1021;As a result, his entry into the Alien franchise ramps up the action.
1022;With that in mind the bullets and explosions rain freely down on the creatures of Aliens pumping an action thrill into the proceedings.

1032;all that said, Aliens still continues to fascinate, even after 15 years.
1033;Thats what makes me return to it every so often.
1034;The extra 17 minutes of footage fill in pieces of the plot and make the movie have a better more rounded plot.
1035;I remember seeing broadcasts of Aliens years ago with at least some of the extra footage and being amazed.
1036;They're signifcant and make for great viewing.
1037;Aliens Special Edition is definitely a cut above Aliens which, I personally consider, the best of the series.
1038;If you love alien you will really love aliens.
1039;Not only will you be treated to the mind.
1040;blowing force of this incredible science fiction masterpiece, you'll also be able to see new scenes which add to the action and create much more depth to the film.
1041;James Cameron develops the original idea with a new class of alien, a fitting nemesis for Ripley as she and the remaining Marines, along with a girl named Newt and a treacherous Company executive, fight to survive.
1042;The special effects are superb, the sets are intricate and impressive, especially the cruiser's interior and the atmosphere processor turned alien lair.
1043;The aliens are truly frightening and convincing, especially the queen.
1044;Awesome performances are given by Sigourney Weaver as the confident leader type Ripley, Michael Biehn as the cool.
1045;headed marine Hicks, Lance Henriksen as the synthetic.
1046;Aliens is easily the best film in the four.

1056;We always waited till the second feature started before leaving, letting traffic clear out.
1057;Little did we know that we had stumbled into a great movie.
1058;This is one of the great SciFi.
1059;My son bought it for a gift and they liked it.
1060;The movie was packaged well and we received it lightning quick without any problems.
1061;Aliens is that rarest of movies: .
1062;"A sequel which surpasses a popular original
1063;the Special Edition includes about 20 minutes of additional footage to this classic popcorn flick.
1064;Powered by a superb cast including Biehn, Paxton, Lars Henrikson, Paul Reiser, and Sigourney Weaver, Cameron accomplishes his mission.
1065;grab a copy of this incredible movie by any means necessary, but when you watch it, do yourself a favor.
1066;Titanic was very good as well, but who would've thought that the genius behind that massive ship was also the genius behind the second Alien movie?
1067;I'm rather new to the Alien saga, but I love them all the same.
1068;Of all four, my favorite is this one, Aliens.
1069;I love it because Ripley makes friends with the little girl Newt.
1070;That's so rare in some of the mainstream sci.
1071;And dog gone it, it's refreshing, is all.
1072;There's Jones the cat, safely out of danger from the aliens.
1073;But these alien movies, and specifically this alien movie, does interest me because all the characters seem genuine.
1074;It was the most memorable part of the whole movie.
1075;In the Special Edition, they edited this out.
1076;cameron had an interesting take on the film.
1077;the movie is good at taking you away though and putting you in the moment.
1078;Coupled with one of the sexiest and toughest female leads ever and you have a great flick.
1079;One of the best add.
1080;often copied and never equaled, Aliens was the epitome of what the great films of the 80's were good at minus the abundance of CGI now drenched over movies cut from the same cloth.
1081;It's like seeing it for the first time.
1082;This has got to be one of my all time favorite movies.
1083;Its a great movie and it will always be great.
1084;The story is interesting and it picks up from where alien left off but this time its war.
1085;this movies got some great creatures in it, the queen alien it one of the coolest monsters in any movie, and the aliens got a new look from the orgininal.
1086;I recommend getting the normal version, which is an awesome movie.

1095;When I was a kid, it just blew my mind to see this movie.
1096;It is an """"ok"""" movie at best."""
1097;The extended scenes are nice too.
1098;Especially love the motion sensor gun scene.
1099;This was the first film he did that told me that he was something special.
1100;No, Terminator's incredible, but the Hollywood landscape is full of one.

1102;Others that come to mind like this are Michael Jackson, Muhammad Ali, Michael Jordan, the late Steve Jobs.

1108;Cgi looks good because it's hyper.
1109;aliens is Cameron unleashed,to date, his 2nd best (and most original) action film behind the original Terminator.
1110;I prefer the special edition to the theatrical version.
1111;The added scenes add even greater depth to Ripley's character and her maternal relationship with the orphan girl, Newt.
1112;Still one of my favorite action films.
1113;I clearly remember going to the theatre to see this some 20 years ago.
1114;I also remember being very skeptical that this movie could top the original.
1115;The original was a classic, great cinematography, a superb cast, and absolutely terrifying.
1116;well they came out with a BADA$$ sequel!!!
1117;It has it all: Great creature design ( a la Giger ), great weapons ( the pulse rifle, smart guns, the drop ship ), kick.
1118;cheek ( the Marine banter always make me laugh, especially Hicks ).
1119;This also is one of the most influentual sci.
1120;As with the first in the franchise, this second film is a sci.
1121;"Exceeded my expectations, even though this sequel is a number of years newer than the original film in the ""Alien"" Franchise with better cinema technology for filming, special effects and sound."
1122;it's very good they were able to get a reluctant Sigourney Weaver back seven years later to do the sequel.
1123;"back as a ""double feature"" works very well."
1124;Its seven Academy Award (Oscar) nominations . . . winning two . . . are a testament to the screenplay, direction, cinematography, special effects, and acting . . . and very unusual for a film in the horror/sci.
1125;Special effects are realistic with reasonable credibility (remember: this is a sci.
1126;those who enjoyed the first film will, without any doubt, enjoy this sequel.
1127;As this film leaves things open at the end, the third provides definite closure if one chooses to end it there.
1128;motherly affection for the little girl to name only one thing.

1131;The outstanding cast isexcellent: Sigourney Weaver was so superb in her role that shewas garnered an oscar nomination for best actress, Bill Paxtondelivers a comediac performance as Hudson (Game Over Man), Michael Biehn is awesome as Hicks, Lance Henriksen is brilliantas humane android Bishop, Carrie Henn is sweet as little girlNewt, and Paul Reiser surprises you with what kind of characterhe actually is (you won't symphatsize with him here).
1132;If youwant a film with exciting thrills, awesome action.
1133;"happy grunts against a teeming nest of truly frightening monsters, ""Aliens"" benefits from its superb small cast."
1134;This film despite being so action packed that you can hardly catch your breath is a great social statement about the value, toughness, and leadership potential of women.
1135;Emotionally scarred from her initial encounter with the Alien species she agrees to accompany a team of space Marines (ooooohrah!)
1136;hits the fan the true leader emerges.
1137;but even despite that take no prisoners attitude she displays perhaps her strongest character trait of all, that natural maternal instinct for an orphaned little girl.
1138;There's a great lesson to be learned from that.
1139;Because at it's best it's one of the great action flicks.
1140;james Cameron does a remarkable job of creating an environment which seems remote, eerily foreboding, and frightening.
1141;bill Paxton is the perfect back talking, wise .
1142;a CLASSIC MUST SEE FILM!
1143;This is a great action movie.
1144;It is a great exciting movie, not really as scary as I expected.
1145;The tone was better, and the creatures were scary looking.
1146;fan of either sci fi or the Alien saga.
1147;This movie is just a great movie.
1148;It has great acting, great plot, great character development, great suspense, and great action.
1149;The film visually looks spectacular, it's shot very close to the action and is very emotionally gripping.
1150;You can enjoy Aliens without having seen Alien, and I think that is very important.
1151;fi and action will love Aliens.
1152;I can't say enough about this movie, Sigourney Weaver is great, Carrie Henn as Newt unbelievably believable, Michael Biehn is great as Hicks, and Paul Reiser works his performance beautifully.
1153;Bill Paxton is just Bill Paxton, you can't expect more or less from him.
1154;This is my favorite movie of all time, and it has been since I was very young.
1155;The Special Edition is also wonderful.
1156;Tremendous sequel that has it all: entirely believable characters, gripping action, multiple levels of meaning and solid story.
1157;The blending of humour and tragedy is perfect, and the squad of Colonial Marines are the best depiction of a military unit yet seen on screen.
1158;This film was made before digital effects got a stranglehold on Hollywood, and the models of the Sulaco, the Dropship and the APC are beautifully integrated into the sounstage and location setups.
1159;The cinematography, production design and wardrobe all help this film to achieve its deserved cult status.
1160;Certainly the best of its kind ever made
1161;It is a good movie for those who like action, surprise, violence, and seeing creepy aliens get killed (as well as pop up and crawl around).
1162;bill Paxton is great as the Marine most full of bravado before the action starts and the one to fall to pieces after the first contact.
1163;Sigourney Weaver is a good actress and adds gravitas to the movie.
1164;It was nice to watch in wide screen.
1165;well, i kinda enjoyed this, but as with its progenitor, i found nothing exciting or innovative or tense.
1166;The events and timing were pretty believable, for that universe.
1167;Watched on recommendation from a friend.
1168;James Cameron's Aliens(1986) is a great film and a great sequel!
1169;It does justice to Alien(1979) and it's also an action packed spectacle.
1170;"Cartoons have poked fun of ""Hudson""."
1171;The film is solid on a technical and artistic level.
1172;Movie critic Roger Ebert claims he enjoyed the film, but it took him a while to calm down after watching it.
1173;Aliens spawned a line of action figures and the critically reviled XBox game Aliens Colonial Marines.
1174;I played an Aliens arcade game at a county fair when I was 9 years old.
1175;Aliens is a classic sci.
1176;This movie finally shows me of the revenge from the aliens after mankind has taken them for experiments and their intelligence.
1177;this movie is a masterpiece one of the best science fiction movies very made in my opinion.
1178;For me this movie surpasses the original while remaining loyal to it.
1179;The blu ray is well done it looks good and sounds good it also includes both versions of the movie.
1180;In this sequel(James Cameron did unfortunately), Aliens is longer,More action packed than suspenseful.
1181;Lance Henriksen does a great job.
1182;I enjoyed the movie,although not as much as ALIEN.
1183;It has it all a great story, good acting and a whole lot of future MARINE weapons.
1184;This movie will always be one the best ever made.
1185;"Funny interaction like Hudson ""Hey Vasquez do you ever get mistaken for a man?"""
1186;Funny stuff like Bisop with the knife.
1187;There is this 1 colonist that is still alive and when that Chestburster comes out Sigourney Weaver just sells it.
1188;Great score by James Horner.
1189;This was Sigourney Weaver's best perfomance by far she was even nominated for an Academy Award.
1190;Michael biehn was great shamer he never got to be a big star.
1191;Bill Paxton was great almost stole the show for me.
1192;Paul Reiser was good as the corperate suit.
1193;This was a terrific action flick with a great plot and tremendous actors .
1194;"it's a classic, even better than the first ""Alien."
1195;political message this movie sends.
1196;And the diplomatic effort was absolutely non.
1197;After the first attack on the Nostromo, everyone should have simply turned the page and moved on.
1198;"It's a true curse to always want things to work out when watching the ""art"" of film."
1199;so, imagine if you will, how much of a pleasure this sequel to ALIEN was.
1200;it was actually the last film I ever paid to see at the theater more than once.
1201;It's truly that good, one of the best action films ever made.
1202;plots to those better suited to flesh them out, but rest assured, they are superb on many levels.)
1203;What makes a film classic.
1204;in whatever genre, (in my opinion) is does it still stand up as watchable today?ALIENS does.
1205;Cameron made a masterpiece (hey, I don't know the guy) in a series that was deep.
1206;I like Alien better overall but Aliens no doubt has the better action sequences.
1207;"After achieving huge critical and box office success with 1979's ""Alien"", it is surprising that 20th Century Fox didn't rush a sequel into production, although at the time sequels were not so quick to arrive after their predecessors, but still the property was hot and the decision would have made them a lot of money."
1208;packed thrill ride with a little bit of horror thrown into the mix.
1209;The special effects work in this one was better than the original (as it should be considering advancements made during the 7 year gap between films), but the best part about the effects for this movie was the practical effects work that was done to create the massive alien creature known as the Queen.
1210;The effects for that alien is some of the best practical effects seen in almost any movie, and the final fight between the Queen and Ripley is incredibly fun to watch.
1211;"The success of ""Aliens"", coupled with that of the first film brought even more acclaim for actress Sigourney Weaver, who solidified her place in the pantheon of great action heroes (or heroines), and even garnered her an Oscar nomination for her work in this film."
1212;Aliens is rated R for violence and language.
1213;"ray of Aliens on my 55"" flatscreen last night and it looked absolutely incredible."
1214;Every edition I've had simply gets better and better.
1215;It's vivid, sharp, and beautifully remastered.
1216;The picture and sound are stunning, and the color is near perfect.
1217;Definitely the definitive version of Aliens and is what was meant to be seen.
1218;Here we get a thrilling action film that still retains the gothic horror that Ridley Scott so vividly created in Alien.
1219;sigourney Weaver got an Oscar nomination for her reprisal as Ellen Ripley.
1220;She gives the character a wonderful sense of strength, compassion and depth.
1221;The music score by James Horner is among his best, as he captures the the suspense and action sequences perfectly.
1222;the special effects and production design are first rate.
1223;Stan Winston slightly changed the look of the Alien creature, but his Alien Queen is a amazing work of art.
1224;The film recaptures the eerie and claustiphobic settings, this time within a ravaged colony complex that is teeming with an Alien hive.
1225;James Cameron who also wrote the story, stayed true to the original material yet created a thrilling action film that has heart to it (Ripley and Newt's relationship)This Special Edition includes scenes that were left out of the original theatrical release.
1226;The pace of the film starts off slowly (it always did) and continues to build up as the film reaches its thrilling climax.
1227;All of the restored scenes do add something to the storyline.
1228;Aliens is a classic in its own right.
1229;This is a great movie!
1230;I remember going to the theatre 20yrs ago to it it and I enjoy it as much now as I did then.
1231;I would recommend this movie to anyone who will enjoy a classic sci.
1232;The extra time added in this edition make it a better overall movie, though everyone may not agree with me.
1233;Bill Paxton is just awesome and hilarious as the scared little private who gauges, unlike many other overly confident soldiers, just how dangerous the creatures really are.
1234;love this movie, has excellent replay value.
1235;in addition to purchasing, have seen it many times on television, each time just as enjoyable.
1236;In any event, would've loved to see on the big screen.
1237;I believe Jim Cameron's ALIENS to be the best sci.
1238;fi film since the original ALIEN and the result of a well thought out script and a demanding eye by a director who knew precisely what he wanted and seldom settled for anything less.
1239;Although there is much memorable about subsequent ALIEN films, this one is probably the best overall.
1240;it had a great action story, good cast, costumes, creative mechanical props, creature effects, artistically designed sets and a sweeping musical score.
1241;I also enjoyed the longer editors cut and the additional footage and wouldn't have minded the extra time in the theater had they included it.
1242;i agree with the director that the film should have included the additional 30 minutes or so of footage.
1243;Among other things it would have explained Ripley's counterproductive behavior during her legal hearing after learning of her daughter's death, and her instant taking to and wonderful mothering of Newt under fire (besides the fact that she was a woman outfitted with those maternal instincts).
1244;"the Alien Queen deserves a ""well done"" for being original, very frightening and a plausible mother for the original film creature."
1245;Gigor's Alien design still stands for me as the most frightening vision in sci.
1246;FATHER, the voice of the military space station from Alien 4, seemed to demonstrate elements of AI and awareness.
1247;Simply said, this was a great film without the extra 17 mins.
1248;When a director comes back and adds 17 mins to create a special edition, with only a few exceptions, he creates a work which is FAR INFERIOR to the original.
1249;The 17 extra mins added to this film are aboslute film killers.
1250;I think it was a decent sequel in one of the strongest sci.
1251;Sigourney Weaver is even better in this smash hit sequel to Alien.
1252;so,she and a group of high.
1253;it all leads up to Ripley's showdown with the Queen,and possibly her last.
1254;this is the best in the series.
1255;I realize Ridley Scott's first 'ALIEN' movie will always be cherished for what is the introduction of a great movie franchise.
1256;sigourney Weaver is in top form.
1257;well casted as well were the Marines deployed for the 'bug hunt'.
1258;He gets to deliver the lines all actors with a grudge dream about.
1259;But Carrie was flawless as the displaced survivor and her interacion with Sigourney very believable.
1260;if you are a collector and need at least one 'horror' or 'action' flick in your library, 'ALIENS' will satisfy both conditions with style and content.
1261;Aliens is the shining star of this series.
1262;James Cameron produced a masterpiece which succeeds on multiple levels.
1263;knuckled, edge of your seat excitement.
1264;The scenes with the colonial Marines preparing to descend to planet LV.417 are superb and build the tension.
1265;sigourney Weaver as Ripley excels as the on.
1266;A terrific supporting cast too.
1267;a masterpiece that survives multiple viewings 22 years after it was first released!
1268;same plot, updated to excellent and set the new standard.
1269;aliens takes the new story one step further.
1270;special effects run rampant, but fit into the story well enough to make all of it believable.
1271;The plot is excellent and intricate, involving military expenditure of human lives in lieu of the ultimate weapon.
1272;classic good vs. evil is always the plot.
1273;One that can be watched over and over and still hold a thrill or two.
1274;Great movie suspensful, entertaining, and action packed!
1275;James Cameron's awareness of what happens in the darkness of a theater while the light is flickering on the silver screen is tremendous.
1276;Aliens, the sequel to Alien (1979), displays his cinematic skills of directing a fast.
1277;The special effects are brilliant as the alien life forms seem alive and ready to kill anything in their path.
1278;scene brings the film an authentic atmosphere which is essential for the films success as weapons, environment, and space crafts elevate the cinematic experience.
1279;Last, but not least, the performances of the cast is terrific as there is a wide range of characters that offer intrigue and further suspense as Aliens in the end turns out to be an excellent film that offers some truly harrowing shocks.
1280;Aliens is the best sequel ever made in my opinion.
1281;This movie had it all, more aliens lots of gung ho soldiers and a cute little girl who shames Paxton with her courage.
1282;"A good title would be called ""Aliens Genocide."""
1283;Go with the Home planet idea.
1284;Aliens is by far the best out of the four.
1285;Sigorny Weaver is my favorite acctress.
1286;I have (and will continue to see!!)
1287;But by far her best role ever was Lt. Elen Ripley!!!
1288;The Alien movie series is by far, in my terms, the best Sci.
1289;I love the Alien franchise, the first two are the best though.
1290;Almost everybody I know who's seen this movie loved it.
1291;But I have to be honest.
1292;"In my opinion, Scott's ""behind you"" approach to Alien works better than James Cameron's modus operandi: ""blast everything into outer space""."
1293;regardless, it's a great thrill ride, adorned with menacing Aliens (hats off to Stan Winston, the special effects are brilliant) and an equally menacing Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver got an Oscar nomination for the role).
1294;This is a brilliant release of Aliens supervised by James Cameron, and includes the original theatrical release and the 1991 special edition release.
1295;If like me you missed the original cinematic release, this will be an orgy of detail that is sure to delight!The soundtrack has been beautifully mastered for this release and really is excellent.
1296;all in all, a concise release with all the useful extras, presented very well.
1297;Even if you've not seen the first movie, Alien you'll still be able to enjoy this film to the fullest.
1298;That was of course by the design of the producers and this films superb director, James Cameron.
1299;Few sequels ever out do or exceed the accomplishments of their predecessors but Aliens can certainly be counted among those select few!
1300;With an exceptional script and an extremely talented cast, James Cameron crafted one of the best films to have ever graced the silver screen and the home theater screen.
1301;few films raise the blood pressure such as this one does as James Cameron and crew crafted a film that excels in all points, from intense suspense to breakneck pace in action.
1302;"What's even better is that this film bears many viewings
1303;Aliens of course stars Sigourney Weaver in the role that has made her a household name and her performance for this film is extraordinary to say the least.
1304;Chief among the Cameron cronies (meant in a nice way of course) are Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen and Jenette Goldstein who all perform brilliantly in this film and can be found in many of his other exceptional films.
1305;Also of note in Aliens is the dramatic role for Paul Reiser, a genre he's long since abandoned for comedy but his performance is quite memorable.
1306;director James Cameron also wrote the script for Aliens along with David Giler and Walter Hill, all of which deserve all of the accolades they've received and continue to receive for their work on this incredible film.
1307;Few directors capture the imagination as he does.
1308;Of note also is James Horner, who was responsible for the score and the work he did on this film turned out to be quite exceptional, as is usual, whenever his name appears in the credits, the film is usually a huge success.
1309;just a note on the Space Marines featured in this extraordinary film, from a present day soldier's point of view.
1310;The film opens with a salvage crew opening up the shuttle and finding her and the cat!
1311;what follows from there is one of the best and most intense Sci.
1312;I found that the THX and 5.1 Surround worked quite well for this film.
1313;The seventeen minutes of the restored footage for this film is quite seamlessly added to film and serves extremely well in enhancing the experience of this movie.
1314;I loved the movie Alien but this one by far is way better.
1315;I liked how instead of having just the Aliens' trailer, it had ALL the Alien trailers as well which is very rare these days.
1316;The photos were cool to look at and I loved how they described all the marines' equiptment.
1317;I have a huge thing for marines and even thought they all died (except for Hix played by Micheal Bean) I still loved the movie.
1318;I loved how Bill Paxton played Corporal Hudson, the nerdy/bad boy electronics expert.
1319;They all did a great job as portraying the marine look and attitude.
1320;And I thought the equiptment looked pretty darn convincing and cool at the same time.
1321;the special effects were not only great at the time of it's release but are still good today.
1322;The crew did an excellent job with the aliens, the marine spaceship and dropship.
1323;i also loved James Horner's musical soundtrack.
1324;He did an excellent job in Terminator 2, True Lies and The Last of the Mohicans however I think this was one of his best mastpieces.
1325;He deserved an oscar for this one.
1326;I mean Pual Riser was the corporate bad guy, that's pretty cool and unexpected.
1327;the suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat and you will root for the marines.
1328;And it was very tame gore and language wise as compared to other suspense movies.
1329;That made me very impressed.
1330;The film overall is just perfect and I believe this is James Cameron's best film.
1331;Not to mention the queen storyline is just freaking brilliant.
1332;One of the best lines in cinematic history.
1333;The first half of this film is like the first one.
1334;But then the second part kicks in, and the action never lets up.
1335;Everything about the film is better.
1336;The effects, the action and of course, the Aliens.
1337;They are more convincing this time around, due to a great blend of animatronics and puppetering, and as a result we are allowed to see more of them.
1338;also, this film introduces us to the Alien Queen.
1339;So this is HIS film, in every sense of the word.
1340;the acting is great, but the film can slow down at times, which does hamper your viewing pleasure.
1341;The additional seventeen minutes are good, though.
1342;I thought that they made the film better.
1343;What do you get when you combine pulp horror fiction with first.
1344;rate acting, direction, editing and production values?
1345;budget and hugely successful """"The Terminator,"""" neatly applied the dripping, claustrophobic atmosphere of the original with Reagan."""
1346;confident Marine Co. eds and a ladder.
1347;There are a number of key performances that make this movie a genre classic.
1348;Apart from Weaver's Ripley, the most unforgettable is Pvt. Hudson, (Bill Paxton).
1349;"in a world ruled by honesty and justice, Sigourney Weaver would have walked away with an Oscar for her performance in ""Aliens."""
1350;She packs talent and energy into every frame.
1351;"Weaver is not just a great actress
1352;Every time It came on TV, i made it a point to watch it.
1353;Alien is far more cerebral than that.
1354;aliens has more comic relief and being directed by James Cameron is even more so about strong female leads.
1355;I told her, before we see it, I told her about Alien and how Prometheus was loosely based on the original alien series.
1356;But, she is a trooper and will watch and read things I suggest (One great thing about my kid).
1357;She never moved, peeped or blinked.
1358;So, THEN, I Amazon primed Aliens for her and she was thrilled with it She thought it was the best one (As does the rest of the world)Then, we Primed Prometheus.
1359;i guess you can say that Alien and Aliens are timeless movies to me in the same boat as Gone with the wind and Wizard of Oz.
1360;Good enough for generations to enjoy
1361;This film was always good.
1362;Of the Alien movies, this one is my favorite.
1363;Who ever came up with the design of this creature sure has some talent.
1364;The picture is widescreen, the aspect ratio is correct, the sound (and the sound design) is powerful on the disc.
1365;The original Alien was a horror film of the highest shock caliber, not much of a story but certainly an inventive and memorable freak.
1366;Overall I think that Aliens looks great!

1374;great movie that i enjoy watching again and again.

1376;I ordered this to add to my collection and was very pleased.
1377;Loved the behind the scenes footage and the extra 17 minutes of restored footage.
1378;Just what a movie collector likes.
1379;Thanks a lot to amazon.
1380;This movie is best watched in a darkened room with theater sound, and lots of bass.
1381;"top action, ""Aliens"" is it."
1382;"Both movies helped to create a new science fiction monster genre
1383;beyond my complaints, this movie is one continuous and excellent roller.
1384;The Marine landing looks realistic.
1385;The Marine landing craft is amazing.
1386;The surprise after the second landing craft returns to the orbiting spaceship was good and gives a viewer one last high before the movie ends.
1387;I think this is the perfect movie.
1388;I first saw Aliens when it came out in the theater, and I have loved it ever since.
1389;The successors to this one, that's another story.
1390;It serves as a great example of a sci.
1391;That's because it has a compelling story, great characters and awesome action.
1392;I doubt those movies will be very interesting 25 years from now!
1393;Special effects are awesome on all of them, tension and momentum are high and acting is good.
1394;It's the original vision of James Cameron's intense sci.

1401;This sequel may be even better than the original.
1402;There's more pure action in this movie but I think the original was able to build the suspense without action much longer.
1403;for a pure action flick this is probably still the better movie.
1404;I've heard some people say this is the greatest action movie ever.
1405;sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Paul Rieser, and Bill Paxton all do excellent jobs in their roles and make the characters memorable and interesting.
1406;this is a great movie and it's a shame the that series took such dramatic turn for the worse after it.

1417;It pivots around solid action with great characters, pretty well fleshed out, and it is also well.

1427;This is probably one of the best classic Sci.
1428;chapter 6: LV.426This new scene has new characters in it, and it shows the families at LV.426 working.
1429;In many ways this is my favorite Aliens film.
1430;the story itself is excellent.
1431;The film is full of a lot of action, considerably more human interest than Alien did, and an excellent level of acting for an action film.
1432;Even where the action is predictable it's still great fun to watch.
1433;I found the special edition of the film is even better than the theatrical release .
1434;good to the last bite.
1435;Another of my top ten movies.
1436;This is much more action sci.
1437;Sigourney Weaver is a badass heroine.
1438;The first was good and the other sequels were well dodgy, but this is pure class.
1439;wise, this film builds to a briliiant climax.
1440;When the survivors are left in the medical lab and the motion trackers detect the aliens coming closer it is heart pounding.
1441;The performances are also top notch .
1442;Bill Paxton is amazing as the once tough then very nervy marine.
1443;Almost as good as the first and Bill Paxton's character really clinches the deal!
1444;I got readings front and behind!There is little doubt what my personal favorite movie of 1986 is, and if you're reading this it should be pretty obvious.
1445;In its essence Alien was a haunted house in space, whereas Aliens was an action thriller, with both thriving on the one thing that scares us most .
1446;In Aliens Cameron ups the ante.
1447;Newt, wake up, we're in trouble!
1448;Cameron also makes good use of lighting in the film wherein he changes the look of his sets simply by changing his light sources.
1449;Most importantly the pace of the film is unrelenting, and I personally feel this is his best work.
1450;What is striking about this film is its technical brilliance which lends itself to every aspect of the movie.
1451;sets, special effects, characters, and atmosphere.
1452;I also wish he would return to this style of film making, because the Aliens/Terminator stuff is what he's best at.
1453;Alien and Aliens are two of the most thrilling action films ever made, and Aliens serves as one of a SMALL number of films in which a sequel comes close to the success of the original.
1454;with Ms. Weaver's Ellen Ripley along as technical advisor.
1455;Where Alien takes an hour or so to introduce the cast and the menace of the creature, Aliens benefits from us already knowing about the outer.
1456;well, my skin crawled a little.
1457;My favorite action/adventure/warfare movie ever.
1458;Great movie, even better on blu!Sounds great, looks amazing.
1459;makes the suspense even tighter!
1460;So happy when my expectations are exceeded.
1461;The result is just a perfect combination of get even action and suspense.
1462;And it's a really serious fight.
1463;It complements and honors the original.
1464;The gap between ALIEN (1979) and ALIENS (1986) is the same gap between a very scary film of suspense and an infinitely scarier film whose suspense is heightened by slam.
1465;Weaver's Ripley was strong without being dominant.
1466;For the first half of the movie, she is quiet, allowing others to grab the spotlight.
1467;Paul Reiser, as Burke, is portrayed as one of many characters who manage to impress the audience with their unique personalities.
1468;There is a great deal of witty dialogue among the marines that is strangely appropriate for each occasion, much of which has entered the lexicon of movie dialogue immortality.
1469;Ripley's maternal instincts kick in and play off surprisingly well in a daring move made by director James Cameron.
1470;ALIENS is the very nearly perfect blend of action, suspense, powerful acting, and witty dialogue, all of which add up to a movie that was richly deserving of the various awards it either won or for which it was nominated.
1471;the price was right and shipping was really fast.
1472;some great things about this movie:1) The setting and effects!
1473;I know a movie rocks when it was made in the mid 80's and still has the best effects in a scifi / action fusion movie I've ever seen.
1474;The colony is also completely convincing, as are sets like the Medlab and the Alien Hive in Sublevel 3.2) The action!
1475;Then we have a nice fancy dropship accident (once again, how'd they make that look so cool??)
1476;I mean, look at how cool Drake is .
1477;You also feel more empathy for Newt after seeing her family, and Ripley gains more character depth.
1478;I gotta say I loved 'em.
1479;this is a respectable, well.
1480;disc two is an exhaustive documentary on the 'making of' that covers pretty much any and every aspect of the film that fans could possibly want to know.
1481;One of the best science fiction and or horror films ever made.
1482;James Cameron made an absolute masterpiece with this sequel to Ridley Scott's equal classic Alien .
1483;The collector's edition has enough to keep you busy and engulfed in the world of Aliens for multiple viewings.
1484;Great box cover art and the special features are essential for any true fan of the film to watch.
1485;Okay, maybe not essential but it's well worth the money!
1486;the ALIENS menus are great: Point.
1487;The Behind The Scenes footage is incredible.
1488;taped test of the Queen done with a hilarious tech assistant standing in for Sigourney Weaver.
1489;i found the transfer of the movie well done.
1490;This movie is a masterpiece of intelligent shoot.
1491;At an inquest, officials disbelieve her story and suspend her space officer license, because she destroyed the huge valuable Nostromo ship.
1492;She has to get a blue.
1493;this is first and foremost an action film.
1494;The aliens are portrayed much more realistically than in the first film, and there are a lot of them.
1495;We get to see powerful weapon gadgets.
1496;We get to see the new and improved android.
1497;We get to see a cool drop.
1498;She shows her leadership skills, her intellgence and her battle skills.
1499;Weaver in all these aspects displays a supreme range of emotions.
1500;She is a hero for the ages.
1501;female showdown at the film's explosive conclusion is a classic.
1502;The aliens look and move realistically.
1503;this is one my favorite films of all time.
1504;Just to give you an idea of my perspective, I also love Blade Runner, Starship Troopers, District 9, Lord of the Rings, Gladiator, Rome (TV series), Spartacus Blood/Sand/Arena, Serenity, Dune (TV miniseries), Black Hawk Down, .
1505;Aliens, the best sci fi action movie ever!!!
1506;The cast is the best,the plot actually sticks to the whole story,and the marines were badass or, state of the badass art I should say.
1507;Everything about the movie was great!Having the extra 17 minutes doesnt really make a big difference.
1508;Although the first movie is a classic, the second is the best of the quartet, and the third and fourth .
1509;well, the less said about them the better.
1510;Excellent!Moreover, the sound and video transfer is top.
1511;After being rescued, she is told the two great pieces of news that will rock her world forever: her daughter has died, and the planet she escaped from, has now been colonised.
1512;I still dislike the first one.
1513;But then I disliked the first Harry Potter book!
1514;So long as I persevere it's fine.
1515;They're likeable, you want them to survive, and they also have better back stories.
1516;But by expanding her role, and showing her maternal instinct with the little girl who's found alive on the planet, it works a whole lot better, and makes her likeable.
1517;bringing in the James Cameron standards, Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton, also works for me.
1518;After working with Cameron on many of his films, you can understand why they make a good team on screen, as Cameron really does bring out the best in Paxton.
1519;carrie Henn, as the mysterious little girl, left behind on the planet to fend for herself, is a shining star in this movie, and it's a shame it was her first and only film role.
1520;It has an outstanding cast and director, and for me, was definitely the superior of the Alien movies so far.
1521;Definitely worth seeing, if like me, you weren't that keen on the original.
1522;Sigourney Weaver is the only really good cast member of this movie.
1523;The original was a work of art.
1524;the special effects are very nice.
1525;worthy acting and poor editing.
1526;But the original was a masterwork.
1527;I love the Alien series, and this is probably my favorite one of the series.
1528;It's a little bit older of a movie, but still a great film to watch today.
1529;There are some very graphic scenes of the alien's craft.
1530;the special effects are also very good.
1531;She has a classical showdown with the alien.
1532;This is a very good movie that you will enjoy watching.
1533;the action is nonstop and the movie is veryexciting.
1534;This will be one that you will always remember.
1535;I really enjoyed the movie and I'm definitely ready for the game, Aliens colonial marines.
1536;The first 3 films in the alien series are all amazing in their own way.
1537;But possibly the best popcorn action flick ever.
1538;I highly recommend the original theatrical release.
1539;The special effects in this film TOTALLY hold up today and i'll tell you why.
1540;The commentary is interesting , but mainly for the fact of how bitter James Cameron sounds about Alien 3.
1541;And unlike you I found it kind of funny and poetically realistic that the characters that had so much effort put into their survival in your action extravaganza were simply killed off in the first scene of Alien 3.
1542;Their in lies the beautiful tone of the film.
1543;For the most part I have liked most Sci.
1544;aliens [the trilogy]not having seen the fourth, is fast becoming a classic.
1545;ridley, in her bvd's must have tickled many a guy's imagination.
1546;Lance made Bishop come alive.
1547;the little girl's mannerism were endearing .
1548;will be watching it again in the future.
1549;the movie is for entertainment.
1550;This is great for any fan of the original theatrical release of Aliens.
1551;I appreciate having the full picture of what happened before the Marines arrived, and also having more info on Ripley's life.
1552;I went to see it in the theater twice!
1553;Well, you do not even see an alien for the first hour of the film and you are still on the edge of your seat!
1554;The exciting conclusion culminates in the unthinkable: hand.
1555;hand combat between Ripley and the Queen Alien!
1556;Plus, one of the great hero laughging in the face of danger lines of all.
1557;Great ensemble cast of space marines, at least until they get the crap knocked out of them!
1558;And the special effects are mostly guys in alien suits and a whole lot of jump cuts!
1559;No matter how many times you see ALIENS, you can never really appreciate James Cameron's thrille, which is certainly the best of the Aliens trilogy and one hell of a movie in its own right.
1560;This time around, just catch the nuances of Sigourney Weaver's Oscar.
1561;nominated performance as Ellen Ripley.
1562;Weaver shares her fear, her anger, her helplessness, her love for Newt, her unflinching courage in facing the queen Alien!
1563;key performance as the kind marine, Hicks.
1564;Biehn who starred in the first TERMINATOR plays his role with quiet strength and he elicits the few smiles Ripley manages.
1565;Considering this movie was done before the advent of CGI, the special effects are awesome, and Cameron's tense pacing brilliant.
1566;Grim, gritty future worlds are James Cameron's specialty, and _Aliens_ is a great example of how good he can make that kind of film.
1567;No scene in the film is a visual pleasure .
1568;dominated area, of course, is incredibly creepy.
1569;the script is quite well written, and everyone does at least a workmanlike job in the acting department.
1570;Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn, and Paul Reiser put in good turns, and Sigourney Weaver shines as always.
1571;Lance Henriksen is particularly memorable as the eager.
1572;This is one of the best action films ever, and an excellent popcorn movie.
1573;Not quite as good as the first one, but still a great movie.
1574;This looks brandnew and the extras are good, it's everything a blu ray should be and of course this is one of the best sci fi movies of all time.
1575;THe story of a crew fighting aliens is brilliant and the cast is A list.
1576;I have them all and I can say that others need to take notice on the blu ray done correctly that this one represents.
1577;The extra footage placed into this collectors edition far surpasses any version previously released on the market.
1578;All the effort that went into the technical detail for the behind.
1579;This movie is so great I can't even stand the fact that I'm typing instead of watching it.
1580;There is never a dull moment and the ending is quite a treat, since you would be 100% satisfied if it ended after the planet blows up!
1581;By learning that Ripley had a daughter, the relationship between her and Newt is much stronger.
1582;I love it so much, and if you don't, you are a bad person.
1583;All of the great bonuses are only available in the big Blu.
1584;As for the movie, it's fantastic.
1585;Aliens is one of those few.
1586;Space marines, a swarm of drones, a Queen, everything they added to this movie, added to the Alien myth, was a perfect addition, crafting a piece of artwork that has stood the test of time, just like the first Alien.
1587;note: Bill Paxton who plays a marine (Bug Hunt man!)
1588;I love this movie and my prime membership.
1589;Sigourney Weaver is great in this movie.
1590;This was rated best sequel of the year, and the 3rd scariest movie ever and I totally agree with them.
1591;It is a mix of marine comedy, suspense, sci.
1592;"I am a Major fan of the ""Alien"" series and this is the best."
1593;(I think the first 2 movies are excellent, third being OK, and resurrection is pretty bad, but if you are a fan you should still see it).
1594;I just bought the Blu Ray of Aliens and thought I would give a quick review.
1595;Without a doubt, this is one of the best Blu Ray Releases Ever!
1596;Specifically when they are inside the complex.
1597;Of course the space scences are mind blowing as well.
1598;This just goes to show that when the studio takes the time to totally remaster and do the transfer right, the results are stunning!
1599;My player is really sensitive to any flaws in the transfer.
1600;ray well it just looks fantasic on my TV.
1601;I tried it in a Sony player and it works great.
1602;If your a real fan of this movie it may be worth picking it up.
1603;This second installment takes the original to the next level.
1604;Enjoyed the action sequence involving the military and the surroundings set in the future.
1605;This one is the best of the series.
1606;"ALIENS: a mix of horror, sci fi and action
1607;he loves the Director's cut.
1608;a definate classic in this home.
1609;Director, JAMES CAMERON (Titanic, Terminator 2, True Lies) is the greatest director ever!
1610;This movie is thrilling with its scares, perfect with its action and spontanious with its acting and directing!
1611;ALIENS is an unforgettable classic SCI.
1612;Take my word for it, the movie is great!
1613;This movie was already one of my favorite movies of all time.
1614;With the additional footage that showed Newt and her family being the ones finding the alien ship and bringing it back to the colony just ties everything together.
1615;Her brother hates that she always wins a game they play because she is small enough to fit in the air ducts and no one was able to get up there to find her.
1616;The biggest add on provides more of a back story for the character Newt, the young girl Ripley essentially adopts.
1617;under director James Cameron this great sci.
1618;fi classic builds on the wonderful horror film, """"Alien,"""" that preceded it."""
1619;Much more action oriented, especially the last 35 minutes which may be the most exciting ever filmed.
1620;Sigourney Weaver's Ripley character is fully developed here and she manages to show both a tender side and one kick.
1621;And when they do show up, it is in great numbers.
1622;"Without question ""Aliens"" remains one of the great action/horror films of all time and this longer version is the one to watch."
1623;the Blu ray transfer is beautiful to look at.
1624;ups on the faces of various characters.
1625;Skin pores, eye color, clothing stains all vibrant and clear.
1626;The musical scores intensifies the emotions in such manner that your heart will literally pound.
1627;This one is my favorite in the Alien series, the first Alien is my second favorite, then Ressurection, and finally Alien 3.
1628;The new version has great color and sound remastering, and the new footage is great too.
1629;The Director's Cut also shows Newt's family on the colony before the Aliens invade it, showing Newt's dad with a face hugger attached to it which led to the doom of the colony.
1630;It purposefully retains the film's grain .
1631;the audio is superb .
1632;one of the best mixes for any movie.
1633;It is clear, impactful, dynamic, and engaging.
1634;Sigourney Weaver deserved an Oscar for this role, she played the gamut of emotions and proved she is an actress for the 21st Century.
1635;The pace, pitch and power of this film is faster and gritter than the original, but it would have to be when the Space Marines take center stage!James Cameron added a number of pluses to this film which give all the leads depth.
1636;even Lance Hendriksen's performance as a synthetic human is both warm, yet chilling.
1637;Newt is a treasure, in funny, innocent ways she provides a counterbalance to the tough adults surrounding her.
1638;I love this movie but watching it in Blu.
1639;Coming back to it after all this time it's surprising to note that it is a proper science.
1640;the technology seems real, the glimses of futuristic society seem genuine, and it hasn't dated in the slightest.
1641;flashy cinematography featuring acres of monochrome lighting, an epic length, a fetish for technology, and Bill Paxton.
1642;Sigourney Weaver makes a perfect action heroine, being tough but recognisably human .
1643;obvious romance with the brave, injured Lieutenant Hicks is handled extremely well, too .
1644;braggardy marine looks forward to getting home from the wars, and the moment he does so you just know that he is marked for death), but they work, and the acting is uniformly solid.
1645;The music deserves a mention, too .
1646;it uses a couple of cues from Jerry Goldsmith's 'Alien' music, and James Horner's alternately ambient, Wagnerian score was so good that he used bits for a decade or more afterwards.
1647;surprisingly, the 'extra bits' are quite sparce .
1648;The complex is also full of Aliens and theirs no way to escape.
1649;She gets betrayed when Burke one of her teammates tries to use her and Newt as hosts to get an Alien past quarintine.
1650;'Aliens' is definitely one of those rare cases where the sequel is heaps better than the original.
1651;The first in the series was undoubtedly seminal .
1652;but this uses all the ingredients of the first film and emphasises them tenfold.
1653;If this appears clich d then it's a great credit to director/writer James Cameron that he adds just about every element possible to make this not only completely credible but also scary, exciting and even human.
1654;cameron replaces one alien with a whole colony, good special effects with better special effects and a bigger cast that's every bit as impressive as the original crew from 'Alien'.
1655;She epitomised the female action hero, perhaps even the action hero, with her role as Agent Ripley.
1656;It is this that will hold the interest of many and it's a rare action movie that can keep you on the edge of your seat one moment and then feel intensely for a lost little girl, who thankfully is a very good actress.
1657;in short, this is a real classic of its genre and comes highly recommended even to those who aren't a fan of the action flick.
1658;Aliens is widely acknowledged as the greatest sequel ever made.
1659;fi action film Aliens, the original Alien broke new ground with it's suspenseful depiction of a single deadly, vicious alien, who had been born, hatched, actually from the host body .
1660;Many of the cast of Aliens, made a name for themselves in this movie.
1661;"dom, like : ""That's it man, game over man, game over!"
1662;Aliens is one of my favorite films ever and has to be among the greatest movies ever made.
1663;It's a film that I want to see again and again, because it provides a thrilling plot with terrific storytelling.
1664;But I did see it again, and things changed.
1665;It's a freaky, suspenseful flick the first time around, after that it's just enjoyable.
1666;So I have to say this is the best Aliens film out there and I don't recommend the others, except maybe the first.
1667;She learns that the world in which the alien she had encountered came from has been colonized by colonists.
1668;ripley's character is unbelievabley real.
1669;But she envelopes the character Ripley so well, it's the perfect role for her.
1670;Ripley is the female version of John Wayne: no nonsense, do it herself, take charge kind of person.
1671;"But Ripley's female ""machoism"" works because it's believable, and that's because she's a great actress.You have other characters like Bien who plays Hicks, one of the few marines that get along with Ripley."
1672;"And Hudson, played by Bill Paxton, a whiner who uses the ""F"" word in almost every sentence."
1673;A great mix of characters who all bring conflict to both the plot and each other.
1674;What makes it great is that it's a pioneer of a film.
1675;But Aliens is a success because it combines these two genres into one movie and creates realistic, and comprehensible events within this unrealistic storyline.
1676;In other words, it makes the unreal suddenly real to us all.
1677;This is the mark of a truely good movie, especially if it is sci.
1678;this is accomplished by good acting as well as great directing.
1679;It is also accomplished when the intensity of the plot never fades, it keeps you on your toes, and this is done by giving multiple problems for the characters of the films to solve.
1680;Great storytelling, with believable characters, with the aid of intensity through compelling problems.
1681;It's a film that will amaze you, terrify you, and entertain you like no other.
1682;imagining of the Alien mythos.
1683;As one of the greatest horror films ever made, Aliens couldn't possibly have been an acceptable follow.
1684;Luckily, the very smart decision was made to turn Aliens into an action.
1685;thriller film, and it succeeds.
1686;In Alien, the real star of the show was the Nostromo.
1687;In Aliens, the aliens themselves are the stars.
1688;The special effects are magnificent.
1689;The queen alien is perhaps one of the most majestic and terrifying creatures ever to appear in a film.
1690;the action is intense, the various moments of anticipation are nerve.
1691;wracking, the special effects are eye.
1692;Overall, this is a solid and entertaining film, and one of the few instances where a sequel actually manages to be decent.
1693;Personally, I think James Cameron is a better director than Ridley Scott: his style is excellent, portraying the action in a very active and up.
1694;close manner while being creative.
1695;The special effects and aliens are also better.
1696;This is a good thing, rather than make the same movie Ridley Scott did, James Cameron, goes all out in this explosive action Sci.
1697;Great FX slow pacing and slam bang action make this one heck of a thrill ride!The creature design has been tweaked in this sequel and we get to see more of it and we get to see more of them!
1698;"The Queen is a site to behold and the finale is probably the best ""Cat Fight"" in film history!"
1699;I rate the film 4 1/2 stars only because the length could have been trimmed a little and Bill Paxton is the most whiniest marine I've even seen, even though he delivers some of the best lines in the movie.
1700;The box set is the way to go!
1701;Out of all the alien films this is the best.
1702;The purist will say Alien but there heart will say Aliens
1703;Like others have said, this is actually one of those sequels that is good and well done.
1704;I also liked the fact that the Alien species was further revealed, especially that wickedly.
1705;Overall, this movie rocked and the special edition transfer was great along with the sound.
1706;The action flowed nicely and I was glued to my seat waiting to see what happens next.
1707;Cameron does a solid job of directing here and the tension was almost as good as the first film.
1708;I was not impressed the first time I saw it but I found myself drawn to it, and watched it a few more times before finally admitting that it grew on me.
1709;It is probably the finest film of its type.
1710;In terms of style and characters, the first film is marginally better, but overall Aliens is just perfect.
1711;Probably James Cameron's best work!
1712;James Horner dark score has always been provoking.
1713;That's plenty to look at.
1714;Aliens is definitely the best, the only movie that really sets the mood!
1715;if you have watched the first alien movie and you like it, you will simply love this movie.
1716;great plot and good special effects for movie.
1717;The reactions I kept hearing from the crowd were amazing and now twentysomething years later it still is one of the best Sci.
1718;"The feature length ""making of"" documentary was very entertaining and informative from, casting, to set construction, to special effects and creature design it had it all."
1719;But, to delve into character development and script writing what it took to bring James Cameron's vision to the screen, that's the good stuff.
1720;Aliens, the sequel to Alien, is the best of the Alien quadrilogy, and is one of the most influential science fiction movies ever made.
1721;"In a three way tie with ""Bladerunner,"" and ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back,"" for best science fiction film ever made, Aliens is a thrill ride with some of the most chilling visuals of any horror/science fiction film."
1722;Lt. Ripley is also one of the most memorable characters in any sci.
1723;Aliens is so good, I can almost forgive Sigourney Weaver for her recent, ridiculously cheesy Direct TV commercial.
1724;Personally I prefer this movie to Alien, where alien is more of a horror flick, this movie has more action and holds very true to the story line of the first Alien movie.
1725;fi movies this is a must see.
1726;I ordered this movie, as I hadn't seen in in quite a long time.
1727;Even after more than 20 years, this movie has still got it.
1728;It is a science fiction classic, and stil stands out as a great movie even after all of these years.
1729;If you've never seen it, I recommend purshasing it in this format.
1730;ho space marines and an array of incredible armoury.
1731;Yet there is a wealth of exceptionally sharp dialogue maintained throughout the film, including during the first hour, and once the action begins in earnest, the claustrophobia returns with a vengeance and many spine.
1732;And finally, there's Sigourney Weaver, in the performance of her career as Ellen Ripley.
1733;score, production design and special effects are solid, and arguably timeless.
1734;They should appeal to teenagers of both today and yesteryear.
1735;"ho battles
1736;The first Alien movie was great as we all know, but its sequel was even better and remains one of the finest sci.
1737;Sigourney Weaver was even nominated for an Academy Award for this, that alone tells you how good she is, as for the supporting cast, including Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Paul Reiser, and Lance Henriksen all give knockout performances as well.
1738;The special effects and creature effects are still decent by todays standards, and the 17 minutes of deleted footage only add more to the film's greatness.
1739;The 1970's first Alien movie had a more solid storyline feeling.
1740;If you're a sci fi buff you're gonna love this movie.
1741;There's action, drama, monsters, weapons, Marines, humor, space ships, action, an android, bigger monsters, did I say there was action?
1742;But that's about all that is interesting about this sequel.
1743;Not only is it a great movie but the extras in it are great, all the way from the multiple trailers to the additional footage.
1744;this happens to be one of my favorite movies that I can watch over and over again.
1745;It has a lot of action, good coheisive storyline and if you pay attention you can even catch a hint of a little romance.
1746;THis movie is great in every way.
1747;From the excellent acting from Micheal Beihn and Sigourney Weaver, to the special effects and the directing.
1748;Even the scenes created a feeling of atmosphere, making a great movie even better.
1749;tread from Alien, a great film.
1750;The added scenes are interesting, but absolutely nothing the average fan can't live without.
1751;Out of all the 'Alien' films to be released, this second sequel is by far the best in terms of story line, direction, and non.
1752;Arriving on the planet, our characters find the colony transformed into an alien hive with the colonists as breeding hosts.
1753;Will they succeed?This is by far the best of the franchise.
1754;Cameron was still fresh with concepts from 'Terminator' and applied them very well in this sci.
1755;fi horror/action film for everyone to enjoy.
1756;fi movies I now watch I see how many references/rip.
1757;The fact that 14 years later it is still the best, most effective, and without a doubt the scariest alien genre film produced for the screen makes it my favorite film.
1758;in James (best visual effects Oscar) Cameron's epic sequel to the 1979 classic Aliens, Lt. Ripley returns, frozen, 57 years later to Gateway Station orbiting earth.
1759;They revoke her flight status, effectively ruining her career.
1760;After a bit of technical know.
1761;how is utilized the colonists are located and they discover the terrifying truth.
1762;On top of that it is revealed that Burke has double.
1763;Almost the entire last half of this film is pure action, and some of the best ever put on film.
1764;real, and that's what's scary.
1765;important knowledge made it possible to film this movie with only six costumes (you'll be amazed when you realize this as you watch), and made it possible to create creatures so believable there hasn't been an original alien design since.
1766;transporting us to another world, this film makes us forget we are in our comfortable homes with a warm sweater and buttery popcorn.
1767;Instead we feel the panic of the terrified marines as countless aliens leap and screech, it makes us feel the pure adrenaline.
1768;notable performances include Sigourney Weaver, who was nominated for best actress.
1769;the film was nominated by the Academy or won in the following categories: Best Actress, Art Direction, Film Editing, Score, Sound, Sound Effects Editing and of course .
1770;I have loved this movie since I first saw it in 1996.
1771;Its one of the few movies that are actually better then the first.
1772;If you pause that scene at the moment when he grabs her you can see the rest of Bishops body coming out from the floor of the ship.
1773;beside that it was a great movie.
1774;Classic, the pace is just right.
1775;fi and special effects I love all the Original Alien movies.
1776;moving long movies (over 150 minutes if you watch the director's cut, which you should) ever made, Aliens takes time to develop interesting and believable characters and then runs them through a gauntlet of intense sci.
1777;fi action, with special effects that still convince today and a Vietnam allegory for those who wish to look"
1778;The Marines with their barrack's humor are a refreshing change from the characters we met before but there is still an underlying sense of unease, I mean it's ALIENS for goodness sake and we know that at some point the jocularity is going to come to an end.
1779;in the second half of this film James Cameron manages to mix high action with intense suspense, a feat very few directors before him or since have been able to pull off as deftly.
1780;there a few surprises in ALIENS, all unexpected and striking yet meshing seamlessly with the rest of the film and as with ALIEN, it is rife with metaphors and subtext delivered with a carefully restrained hand rendering it enjoyable by all, in a sweaty, heart pounding, teeth gritting kind of way.
1781;It had some elements of the thriller, like the original, but with an action/adventure angle to it.
1782;The director's cut is wonderful.
1783;It's just a few extra minutes of footage, but it really adds a lot of depth to the story.
1784;But its pace can outclass many top actions.
1785;First, there is some extra footage, which is good.
1786;it is definitely the best of the series in North America.
1787;It's funny that I went and saw Aliens when it originally came out and all but forgotten much about it since I haven't seen much of the movie since then.
1788;Great stuff, but there was no sound!
1789;Aliens is one of those few movies that is better than the original and pretty much tops the horror/sci.
1790;It also has several great action set pieces to boot all hammered around within some impressive nerve.
1791;wrecking suspense conjured up its legendary director .
1792;the premise for this movie is set 75 years after the original.
1793;She discovers that the planet she once visited which contained the alien is now home to some sort of human colony.
1794;go see the most scariest action film of all time.
1795;Grate sounds an vision a classic must see for all sci.
1796;Aliens is an almost perfect movie.
1797;It is so much fun in so many ways.
1798;Wanting to see this extended version for so Many years.
1799;video collectors edition is perfect for my collection.
1800;With the high profit margin of the original Alien, it was inevitable that Fox would release a sequel.
1801;Aliens is a film chocked full of big guns, big machines, big language, and even bigger deaths.
1802;let it be said that Aliens is an amazing, inspiring flick .
1803;charged with big guns, nearly non.
1804;stop action, incredible casting, breathtaking cinematography, one of the best music scores ever made, freaky as hell creatures, a great plot .
1805;She's a bit hardened around the edges this time around, and as always only adds to the film, never taking away.
1806;Michael Biehn is the sexy and likeable Cpl. Dwayne Hicks, I'm pleased with him the whole way through.
1807;The rest of the cast includes Paul Reiser as Burke (an unlikable character but a fantastic actor), Bill Paxton as private Hudson to add large doses of humor and up the suspense level .
1808;have to love this guy .
1809;The score was so sensational that ever since it has been used in other movies and trailers.
1810;The scene where the soldiers have first gone out to investigate is both tragic and unforgettable.
1811;Definitely watch with the lights out!I found part one more frightening, while two tended to rely more on being action.
1812;Many people compare the films but they really should stand on their own.
1813;Alien and Aliens are both one.
1814;a. kind and every movie goer should give them a chance.
1815;It is promised that her pilot's license will be reinstated is she goes.
1816;Aliens is one of my all time favorite movies and has to be one of the best action / Sci.
1817;"From top to bottom, screen play, acting, characters, action and special effects ""Aliens"" Does not disappoint."
1818;the Good: Great acting all around and great characters as well.
1819;One of my favorite characters is Hudson played by Bill Paxton.
1820;Aliens plays it straight from beginning to end and it works spectacularly.
1821;The soundtrack and sound effect were also an irreplaceable aspect and helped to carry the story and acting to the next level.
1822;overall: One of the greatest actions movies made to date and if you haven't viewed this get to the video store and check it out!
1823;They are great, timeless movies.
1824;"fi/action classic surpasses the original ""Alien"" by far, although the two cannot be compared."
1825;Oh, yeah, she'll be traveling along with a squad of space marines.
1826;And Ripley is determined to stop him.
1827;Aliens boats amazing special effects, along with James Horner's intriuging score.
1828;Also, Weaver's acting has improved greatly since the first film, and she delivers one of her strongest performances.
1829;female fight scene at the end is worth seeing twice.
1830;"all in all, ""Aliens"" is a classic sci."
1831;fi/action movie, with plenty to offer in entertainment.
1832;If you like creature features, this is one of the best.
1833;For many people, Aliens is one of the greatest film experiences of the entire 1980's, with its grand climatic design, powerful action sequences, and visually stunning special effects, it's easy to understand the appeal this film has on the masses.
1834;My oppinions may not be the most popular around, but hopefully they will make an interesting read.
1835;It is here that she is salvaged, and for a New York minute, there is actual mystery to the story.
1836;that's funny, because neither did I.
1837;There is an interesting comment from Sigourney Weaver on the disc two making of features, in which she states that James Cameron is a big believer in gun control.
1838;proud to be a Spunkmeyer.
1839;Independently targeting particle beam tactical smart missles.
1840;"Sigourney Weaver is an actress that stands nearly 6'1"", with legs all the way up to her shoulders, and yet, somehow, someway, he manages to make her look dumpy in her only panty clad moment in the entire picture."
1841;What is so comical about this flirtation sequence, is that it revolves around Hicks weapon.
1842;Ripley You started this, show me everything.
1843;There are a few gripes, most notably the fact that the alien could grow so big so fast without a food source, but at least it remains mysterious, and most of the characters have motivations that are hidden.
1844;It is also a film that manages to stay suspenseful, not only for what it decides to show, but just as importantly for what it doesn't show.
1845;In this way, the original let the audience members fill in the blanks with their own imagination.
1846;Lastly, part four in the franchise I rate as a 2, an have only bothered to watch that installment one time.
1847;So anyway, I popped the disc into my player and enjoyed the menu graphics.
1848;simple, yet attractive with easy navigation.
1849;I knew I was in for a treat.
1850;The picture looked terrific, with rich blacks and saturated colors.
1851;Fine detail and a clean transfer made this film a pleasure to watch.
1852;The surround elements are wonderful and the stereo separation is quite pleasing and realistic.
1853;Having THX certification is almost a sure guarantee that your audio experience will be the best it can be.
1854;The disc also includes the usual stuff.
1855;The scenes fit flawlessly into the original cut, and if you are like me, you'll appreciate trying to recognize the scenes and enjoying the restored footage.
1856;i found the scenes quite enjoyable.
1857;The original was wonderful, but as usual, James Camerons need to thrill us all comes through loud and clear in this sequel.
1858;First the extra's add a lot of information for the people who love a little history with their movie collection.
1859;This is a must for everyone.
1860;I just bought the Alien trilogy and began watching them starting with the first film.
1861;The original Alien was just as good as I remembered from my childhood days.
1862;The atmosphere and suspense is simply unmatched by this, the second movie.
1863;I, for one, will take the original film any day over this one.
1864;It's my husband's favorite movie.
1865;"My sons, who are now in the mid to later teens, have attached themselves to the Aliens thing due to this movie and the first original ""Alien""."
1866;fi flick in a class by itself that holds up to todays computer generated stuff in spades.
1867;Well done, well acted and action and tension filled.
1868;Alien #1 has superb photography, combined with a rather weak story line, where the characters makejust about every possible mistake they can to ensure disaster.
1869;Your prototypical space suburban family goes treasure hunting, finds the Alien spaceship and repeatsevery mistake in Alien #1 .
1870;The rest of the movie is chock full ofMarine caricatures .
1871;"My all time favorite ""scary movie""The remastering is phenomenal, and the directors cut is the only way to watch it."
1872;Crisp, clear, and for the most part, timeless.
1873;The actors are amazing, the acting is amazing, the effects for there time are amazing!
1874;This is the best of all of the Alien movies.
1875;While this is a sequel is a complete disconnect from the original.
1876;It is completely larger than life.
1877;This is my favorite of all the Alien related flicks.
1878;Alien number one is no1, and that's my opinion because of the much better actors (and probably director too).
1879;Alien (1) feautered great actors, and the movie is far more mysterious .
1880;"and the fact that you don't see it so much (the way you see THEM so many times in Aliens) makes the movie even more scary (and ironically it is a much, much more ""effective"" effect (and a lot easier to ""create"" I guess)."
1881;but don't get me wrong, the movie is good .
1882;watch the original instead .
1883;and of course : are you a fan?
1884;one of the best sequals in movies of all freakin time.
1885;also if you love alien and aliens check predator out.
1886;the 1st predator with arnold shwarzennager and carl weathers was just excellent.
1887;any way aliens was fun bad ass and just a freakin classic one of the all time great movies
1888;One of the best action sci.
1889;It's still smart, the characters still resonate and there are only a few moments that have become hokey over the years.
1890;I can see this one a few times a year.
1891;After nearly 30 years this movie still looks good.
1892;There are some scenes where the movie shows its age but overall still a really good movie.
1893;Ripley comes back with the cat that made it through the first film, and is pronounced negligent for destroying the company ship.
1894;Ripley takes the little girl under her wing and soon they have a strong bond of friendship.
1895;Add betrayal, friendship, a spark of sexual attraction, not to mention the action pack sequences and this film packs a powerful and gripping punch.
1896;Aliens was a terrific, terrifying, and somewhat relentless action thriller.
1897;But the extra footage tinkers with the movie's fundamental workings, damaging it severely in the process.
1898;Invariably, they select the best movies for this kind of vandalism, because they they can milk them for a quick buck.
1899;Create something good in Hollywood and everyone and his brother will fight to stick a finger in it.
1900;the bottom line: Aliens is a gripping, terrifying, classic action thriller.
1901;duper Aliens Director's Cut with Added Footage and Hand.
1902;painted Periwinkles is also a pretty good movie.
1903;She carried the film from start to finish, displaying a complicated set of emotions .
1904;She took on new ground and did so with an indelible virtuosity.
1905;Accolades and awards should go to those who are most deserving despite the genre.
1906;The only complaint I have with this outstanding film is the portrayl of the Marines.
1907;Yeah, right!Anyway, the film is still great and totally worth owning.
1908;Let me begin by saying, I'm a huge fan of the first two movies in the series, specifically Alien.
1909;I loved the nail biting suspense of not knowing what the creature looked like or where it was, or even what it could do.
1910;Almost from the beginning we have aliens and gunshots to keep us entertained and at the edge of our seat.
1911;This scene also gives more background on Newt.
1912;At one time I saw on TV a behind the scenes special that was very interesting and informative, this seemed to be a chopped down and edited version of that.
1913;incase you haven't seen the movie, the acting is believable, somewhat above what you would expect in an action adventure film.
1914;Some of the lines are a bit forced but nothing takes away from the viewer's enjoyment of the film.
1915;The script is interesting and easy to follow, I have to admit that the added in footage did help explain several of the questions I had in the original version of the movie.
1916;the special FX are awesome and totally believable except for one awful blue screen shot at the end.
1917;All of the creatures are realistic and frightening.
1918;The action scenes are fluid and exciting to watch.
1919;If you're not the type to run out and replace your VCR collection as soon as the new format arrives, you probably appreciate a slightly clever ploy to spring for a new version of a classic.
1920;I remember watching the credits roll with the powerful soundtrack that kept the heart pounding as the last of the text disappeared.
1921;successive viewings have not spoiled enjoyment of this finely crafted script and its special effects.
1922;Rubber suits, scale models and puppetry have never been used to such great effect.
1923;"The scenes involving the ""drop ship"" are stunning."
1924;few pauses and a lot of action pace this relentless story.
1925;Bill Paxton's Hudson, who provides comedic relief, describes the array of weaponry they bring.
1926;rate performance in the escape ahead of the massing aliens.
1927;cameron's tip of the hat to Hitchcock is one the best moments in cinematic history.
1928;The final battle with the queen alien is a masterpiece of action filming.
1929;This has got to be the scariest movie I've ever seen.
1930;The setting is perfect, and the fact that you don't know who's going to die next has you sitting on the edge of your seat.
1931;This movie is not about gore at all, it has a great story line and some great actors.
1932;The marines, for example Hudson has a great sense of humour and seems unafraid of anything until he sees the Aliens.
1933;There is a tremendous character growth to all those who come face to face with the Aliens and it really shows in the movie.
1934;My favorite character has got to be Hicks, calm under pressure, brave, keeps his head.
1935;and this could very well be the best movie ever made too.
1936;I agree that for a sheer thrill rush , Aliens is hard to beat.
1937;Subtlety, the strength of Scott's movie, always works better than an all.
1938;The latter is so believable as a Latina that one would think she hailed from Puerto Rico.
1939;fi category, a nomination for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar may have been bestowed upon Goldstein.
1940;Everyone knows that The Academy only has a fondness for costume dramas or period pieces .
1941;The special edition of the film adds a 17 minute segment tying the overruning of Hadley's Hope colony up to the alien derelict.
1942;Sigourney Weaver and Michael Biehn complement each other perfectly as Lt. Ripley and Cpl. Hicks respectively.
1943;Excellent direction from James Cameron tops the movie off and leaves you constantly watching and begging for more.
1944;Superb film for all viewers.
1945;The Scott film was good, especially at the end.
1946;But this one, it captures the fear and intensity of close quarters combat like nothing else.
1947;I will disagree with most of you on one point, though.
1948;The first Director's Cut version was the best, in my opinion.
1949;packed, in your face, frenzy.
1950;He took a good tale of terror, a vile, redoubtable villain and really shook up the mix.
1951;Also there is some clever dialogue.
1952;Thank you for the great service and quick delivery.
1953;Even before this special edition hit the market Aliens was one of my favorite sci.
1954;The first 3 ALIEN movies are brilliant!!!
1955;the first movie is a total classic, and this 2nd part ALIENS is on the same high level!
1956;As the first, the special effects are amazing for it's time.
1957;the planet, the spaceship, the aliens are all really well done.
1958;Such a big difference in clarity of picture and sound.
1959;ray makes this move even better if that is possible!
1960;Sigourney Weaver returns to face her fears in the surprising Sci.
1961;When communications with the colonists are lost, Ripley joins a tough team of high.
1962;Aliens is an exceptional action.
1963;Director James Cameron adds much excitement in this sequel.
1964;Its engaging story delivers some top.
1965;notch thrills and great suspense.
1966;The movie features some exhilirating action sequences and award.
1967;winning special effects by FX creator Stan Winston.
1968;Sigourney Weaver delivers a strong heroic performance.
1969;Aliens had a successful run in theaters and won two Academy Awards (Sound Effects Editing and Visual Effects).
1970;Aliens Collector's Edition is a very impressive highly.
1971;The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is surely amazing with some great surround effects.
1972;fi action thriller, Aliens, is well deservedly held as one of the greatest action films ever made.
1973;There are some great scenes involving guns and big mechanical suits, but I would still argue that the strongest aspect of this film is its thrilling suspense (and 80's vibe.
1974;What I would call it, besides science fiction and action, is one of the best horror films involving aliens that I have ever seen.
1975;There were a few scenes that got my heart racing.
1976;I got to know every crew member's personality, and that's a big plus.
1977;Not to mention the actors did a fine job at bringing the characters to life.
1978;Sigourney Weaver is a damn fine lead ad Ellen Ripley, finally back home only fifty.
1979;she's tough, yet very complex.
1980;The supporting cast was very good as well.
1981;I was glad to see he and Cameron working together two years after their success with The Terminator.
1982;Bill Paxton was also a pleasant surprise as an annoying meathead named Private Hudson.
1983;Something else important that I have not mentioned is the cool factor that Aliens has.
1984;the score was terrific as well.
1985;The music is one of the most important aspects of a horror movie, well every genre really, but horror even more.
1986;He has quite the track record for classics in the genre.
1987;Now for the transfer of this iconic classic.
1988;The restoration was very well done, and Aliens looks and sounds ever better than expected.
1989;"There's fun to be had in ""Aliens,"" but that's about it."
1990;time great creature effects, even by today's standards) has the ability to widen your eyes.
1991;When Ripley first encounters her in her lair, the movie finally rallies it's ability to chill.
1992;She shows you that her survival is no accident: she possesses an inner strength that the others do not.
1993;She's a cog in a machine.
1994;Even though it is 30 years old, it is still the best alien movie ever!!
1995;It still makes you jump.
1996;I think this is the best of the series of Alien movies.
1997;The addition of the new scenes add to the film help some of the continuity.
1998;They also freshen it up almost make it a new movie.
1999;Having the digital 5.1 sountrack available is great although, at least on my system, you have to remember to select it from the menu.
2000;I remember seeing the sentry guns scene.
2001;Aliens: The Director's Cut (James Cameron, 1986)Back in the day, when both the Alien franchise and James Cameron were good, the two got teamed up on the first sequel to Ridley Scott's classic.
2002;(Which is, in my mind, still James Cameron's best movie.)
2003;And most of that is worthwhile.
2004;(Though it was nice to see another shot of the derelict spaceship from the original film.)
2005;Definitely more action packed if you like lots of gunplay.
2006;The wise cracks by Bill Paxton are priceless and Michael Bien does another great job of playing the strong silent type who helps Sigourney out of a few tight spots.
2007;This is another excellent movie and the Special Edition brings back some addition scenes like the classic gun sentry episode when the Aliens mass their final attack.
2008;Aliens 3 was pretty weak, but I also recommend Alien Resurrection.
2009;The best of the four movies by far.
2010;Great ride throughout and very well done.
2011;ALIENS was one of my most favorite films in the early 90s.
2012;I saw this film on video like around the year of 1997 and I simply loved this film.
2013;It is the best in the series.
2014;The queen looked superb in this film.
2015;I have the vhs versian of this magnificent film.
2016;WHy need the legacy, aliens special edition,wide screen edition,Collecters edition,all THOSE DAMN EDITIONS!
2017;I saw some of the stuff in the quadrilidy at a friends house and it is SUPERB.
2018;Aliens is probably one of the best movies ofthe 1980's as well as one of the best moviesever made!Sigourney Weaver gave a great performanceas Ellen Ripley, the other cast membersgave great, memorable performances aswell and the settings, SFX, script,characters, etc are just plain greatto watch.
2019;It is indeed|scary to watch at times but also fun and thrillingas well.
2020;all in all, a timeless masterpiece, a true classicin not only acting, directing, producing but alsofilmmaking in general and a great action packed film.
2021;I also think that the actors in the original were more believable in their parts.
2022;There are multiple reasons for this.
2023;Second, the pace is much faster and intense than in the first.
2024;Indeed, this is one of the tensest films ever made.
2025;But primarily, ALIENS is the best in the series because the character of Ripley has developed into the best female action role in the history of film.
2026;When she does so, she emerges as the greatest female action character ever.
2027;Her sheer courage in doing what she has to do to not only to save herself but the young girl who is the sole survivor on the planet drives her to undertake some amazing feats of courage.
2028;Her will drives the film forward, and there are few more extraordinary moments in Sci.
2029;"there are so many other excellent things in this film: the great supporting cast, with Lance Hendrickson portraying one of the best androids I can remember seeing in film
2030;And has there ever been a greater movie monster than the Alien Queen?The Aliens series is one of the very best, but of those films, this one is the best of the bunch.
2031;the menus and special features are great and the transfer rocks both sound and video!
2032;probably the best sequeal ever made?
2033;This probably will stay the 80s best sci.
2034;I have to agree with the others that sing the praises of this very well.
2035;The stories are great, the cast is fantastic, the acting is compelling, the effects are dazzling.
2036;I think that it updates the attitude along with the years, which the movie Starship Troopers did not (Starship Troopers was just too 1940's) The marines in this movie are an absolute delight and it is to the writer/director's credit that the characters were as rich and developed as they were.
2037;Just one more example of Cameron's devotion to detail on all levels.
2038;Not as heavy intellectually as Blade Runner, but good, rollicking fun, very well rendered.
2039;Weaver is the bomb and the cast is incredible in this one especially Bill Paxton.
2040;The best of the three and way ahead of its time again.
2041;Many great one liners and tons of action throughout.
2042;James Cameron directs an excellent follow.
2043;Aliens is a suspenseful, action.
2044;packed gore fest that had garnered a well deserved 7 Academy Award nominations, including a Best Actress nod to Sigourney Weaver.
2045;Weaver is excellent as Ripley, but the visual effects steal the show.
2046;Aliens was a great film,when you compare it with Rambo 2,Terminator and Terminator 2.
2047;i enjoyed it when thirteen years old and saw it in a cinema.
2048;the film score by James Horner is topnotch and I think is his best.
2049;if anything he did well he painted women marines the equal of men and kept a female hero.
2050;The whole point as to what makes the Alien series so good, is that each time it is done by a great director.
2051;The interest in film is so high right now, but not many people see it as an art form.
2052;I bet the people who are seeing Aliens for the first time, in this format, will be really surprised to here.
2053;It is fine however, that this version came out now, for everyone who has absorbed it the last 15 years, to give us a fresh look on a classic.
2054;Its fine to watch this now, but this is how movies are being presented to audiences in the theaters today.
2055;See this movie, only if you know the first one.
2056;Give the original to a friend who hasn't seen it.
2057;Cameron knew exactly what he was doing, and he made a masterpiece.
2058;The Queen is such an amazing addition to the series, and of course, the Colonial Marines.
2059;they're all such incredible characters, and you remember all of them.
2060;Sigourney Weaver is so intense while Bill Paxton nearly steals the show when he should've been annoying as hell, and Michael Biehn gives every scene weight.
2061;Everybody plays their roles just right.
2062;The effects are top notch, the dialogue is great and memorable, the directing is clean and clear, and the music is brilliant.
2063;It is one of those movies I can watch over and over again as years go by.
2064;Aliens is one of the three best sequels ever made, behind only Empire Strikes Back and Terminator 2: Judgement Day in my opinion.
2065;Aliens manages to get going in the first 25 minutes where as Alien in the first 45 minutes .
2066;this movie is far more intense then the first.
2067;escaping her freighter, she's found drifting in space for nearly 60 years.
2068;Thawed out of coldsleep , her memories of the alien terror are fresh while she lacks any friends or family with which to lean against.
2069;the camera stays smooth, and the action is choreographed so that we always know what's going on (assuming we can bear to look at the screen).
2070;Between the awesome visual effects and the speed of the action, you'll need to see this widescreen .
2071;fi fright fest, is also populated with interesting characters and a twist on the original plot that makes it almost irresistable .
2072;I loved the grand scale and the mother.
2073;The special effects are outstanding, and the thrills keep coming, more and more and more till you think you just can't take anymore, and then there are more.
2074;Sigourney Weaver proves she can take on anyone .
2075;Perfect popcorn movie, and a great one to own .
2076;The first 'Alien' movie was a smash hit and very original, spinning many movies off.
2077;'Aliens (2)' attempts to hold to the original direction, and complements 'Alien' well.
2078;with a good dose of suspense .
2079;then you would certainly enjoy this movie.
2080;engrossing movie which is bound to please any sci.
2081;Bandwith was totally fine on my plasma and never had issues before.
2082;It's got everything you want.
2083;Plus you get to hear one of the best one liners in a movie.
2084;The first Alien and this movie are the best of the series.
2085;If you haven't seen this movie yet do yourself a favor and check it out.
2086;I recommend this disc for sci.
2087;wrenching, terrifying film Alien comes the impressive (and quite possibly superior) sequel Aliens.
2088;It is a chilling game of cat.
2089;James Horner delivers an ominous score, and the visual effects are amazing.
2090;7 impressive Academy Award nominations, including Weaver as Best Actress, Best Art Direction, Best Film Editing, and Best Original Score.
2091;I bought the movie for my Daughter.
2092;It's best to check your brain at the door before viewing this one.
2093;I like it"
2094;The alien queen is unforgettable.
2095;The mother theme is done well.
2096;Sigourney Weaver nails it, as usual.
2097;"I'd like to say that James Cameron might be a bit embarrassed by this a little bit by now, but ""Avatar"" is proof positive that his love affair with guns and the military is still going strong."
2098;wall action with the occasional bits of terror and suspense.
2099;also, this is the only Alien movie sullied by a happy ending, making a jarring shift of tone from the other three films.
2100;Oh, gee, look, the happy, valiant standard nuclear family survives, complete with pieces of their best robot pal to play with.
2101;(Yeah, I know, he's an android.)
2102;One of the halmarks of the Alien franchise is the use of talented, upstart new director .
2103;With an excellent ensemble (Bill Paxton, Lance Hendrickson) that actually matched the original, the sequel actually worked well.
2104;fi favorite from almost 30 yrs ago has aged remarkably well.
2105;Aliens, the second movie in the series, is one of my favorite movies, especially in this genre.
2106;I've watched it numerous times over the years.
2107;I highly recommend this movie.
2108;Aliens looks excellent on Blu.
2109;The picture is exceedingly sharp and the sound is excellent.
2110;Does not hold the level of tension that the first film created,but still,a very good sequel.
2111;A good transfer from Fox,but not excellent,i did notice some scenes where grain was evident.
2112;Aliens has always been my favorite movie in the whole quadlogy, for the overall exciting plot (it may sometimes be cheesy) and great special effects.
2113;It's a rarely good (in this case great) change from such a brilliant, suspensful movie like Alien, to a fast paced gun.
2114;"It works, don't ask me why, but it does
2115;Overall, this is one of the best movies ever made, and I would request it to any sci.
2116;Aliens is easily the best in the whole quadrilogy.
2117;all which add up to be a great movie.
2118;Sigourney Weaver deserved an oscar for her wonderful reprise as Ripley.
2119;And Carrie Henn,Newt,acted amazing for a child her age and melted the audience's hearts in the process.
2120;if you enjoyed Alien, and love a good action movie, Aliens is for you.
2121;I love the movie and the service , the movie looks great on blue ray.
2122;thanks a. gain,steven keep up the good work.
2123;There is one film that best represents this sci.
2124;and the scene with Bishop playing with the knife, just one fine scene in this amazing sci.
2125;I recommend any one who respects good sci.
2126;most people call this the best film in the series and that is so true.
2127;this film has better acting(with amazing performances from Carrie Henn,Michael Bein,Bill Paxton,and a Oscar nominated performance by Sigourney Weaver),the action scenes are better,and the aliens look alot better.
2128;overall,a better film than it's predecessor!!!!
2129;This is by far and away the best of the Alien films: it is frankly one of the best sci fi movies of all time, it is simply perfect.
2130;The creature is the coolest ever created in the sci fi genre and Weaver rocks are the protagonist anti hero, Ripley.
2131;Highly recommend"
2132;This was a gift and was well received.
2133;The picture is greately improves fron the VHS.
2134;Also the sound track is much better.
2135;this is an awesome movie, and now it has 17 min of new footage that shed allot of light into many scenes that had some holes in them before.
2136;This is truly one of the best sci.
2137;It's action packed and full of great moments that will have you watching them again and again.
2138;If you haven't seen this movie you are really missing out and, should watch it since it's one of the films that have become legend in our society.
2139;"the special features are also well worth watching and are full of interesting details for the ""Alien"" fans."
2140;I honestly loved this one more than the first.
2141;Much more action packed and I really liked Bishop in this movie.
2142;This does have the 1991 special edition, the one you want to watch.
2143;The added footage explores Ripleys motherhood.
2144;She is sad about losing her daughter and we feel a strong bond with her and the child Newt.
2145;the strong bond of a mother protecting her young.
2146;This is the best film in the series, which is saying something.
2147;Aliens is a classic tale of a reluctant hero.
2148;the directing is flawless, contrasting an isolated Ripley against the goofy camaraderie of the Marines.
2149;Everyone in the film is fantastic, from the ones who die without knowing what hit 'em to the terrified, bitter and stressed grunts left standing.
2150;The best part is the end when the credits roll.
2151;This is my favorite Alien movie!
2152;Everything is fast and clean with plenty of action and suspense!
2153;I may be biased because I grew up with this movie but I highly recommend it.
2154;25+ years later and it is still a great movie.
2155;liners are classic throughout the movie.
2156;Looks great on the Plasma and the surround sound is excellent.
2157;This was a fantastic film.
2158;As with the first film, the special effects are excellent.
2159;overall this was a spectacullar film, and one of the best sequals I have ever seen.
2160;Aliens is perhaps the best Action/Sci.
2161;that was some intense movie making and holds true to today.
2162;aliens Director James Cameron is perhaps one of the best writer/director/producers in the business.
2163;He is the master of bringing realism to fantasyland.
2164;disk Alien series (Alien, Aliens, Alien3 and Alien 4.
2165;Aliens is without a doubt one of the best action/sci.
2166;esque type of the first film, and it's done extremely well, engrossing you (for the most part) from the first scene, to the very last.
2167;the best thing about this film is the script,and with the new extended special edition we get more into Ellen Ripley's character.
2168;"Keep in mind it's still great for its time and the drabby ""sloppyness"" of the film somewhat helps it at times."
2169;I myself find Aliens very riveting and entertaining.
2170;The trilogy is a classic saga that can run with other great trilogys such as Indiana Jones and The Lord of the Rings, and Aliens definietly does the trilogy great justice.
2171;The movie kicks serious .
2172;"james serves up the action with a good helping of cheese, thanks in large part to Bill ""We're all gonna die"" Paxton and the rest of his cliched 'elite soldier' comrades."
2173;this is a modern classic, a standard setting film, and a must.
2174;A collectors edition that deserves the title.
2175;of course this is the ultimate movie .
2176;James Cameron creates an incredible spectacle which compliments perfectly Ridley Scott's original masterpiece.
2177;Perhaps even better than the original.
2178;this was directed by James Cameron after his success with `Terminator' and if you are familiar with this film the directional style will be very familiar, but it's a style that works very well for the sci.
2179;This is also the film we see Ripley become the badass she has to be to survive the aliens.
2180;this is an excellent sequel to the original film and whilst it is louder and with more action, it adds to the story very well indeed and compliments the original perfectly.
2181;Some say this is the best film in the series and it is definitely a very credible, exciting film, with a great plotline.
2182;As I sat there watching Aliens earlier today, I found myself liking Aliens more and more, and as time went on I found myself liking Aliens better than Alien.
2183;Now I know why Sigourney Weaver was nominated for best actress of that year.
2184;The tranfer was crystal clear and amazing.
2185;It also comes with the 1986 theatrical version and the 1991 special edition.
2186;This is One of the best films of the '80s so I strongly think you should watch this film.
2187;Not nearly as good as the original released version.
2188;I waited many years for a director's cut of Aliens.
2189;Ever since they shown a lot of the extra footage on a televised release (and cutting out some good original footage in the process) I have wanted this.
2190;For one it has an old interview with James Cameron on what the concept of Aliens was to be like.
2191;Very interesting to see him how he was back in the 80's.
2192;Something the Collector's Edition only gives you a glimpse of.
2193;The extra footage really enchances the story line and gives you a lot of background on Newt, her family, and what happened on LB7.
2194;The extras are good but not overwhelming.
2195;Question: What good is the color Teal?
2196;What great work of art has ever had a predominate Teal cast?
2197;I must be one of the few people that, while finding 'director's cuts' interesting, still prefer to have the original theatrical release of a film.
2198;Now I have the theatrical release of Aliens I'm a happy man.
2199;I liked the tighter pace and even one less piercing scream from Newt is a bonus in my book.
2200;Aliens is just bigger .
2201;"bigger weapons, more crew members, more and bigger aliens, big explosions, bigger gore
2202;And people talk about the first one taking so long to get started, but what about this one!
2203;Except this time they're not nearly characterized so well .
2204;Nobody takes her seriously"
2205;I liked the first one's terseness and that thing's running around in here with us atmosphere along with the way it was put together so much more.
2206;But Aliens is a decent action movie for gore lovers.
2207;This is the sequel to the 1979 hit Alien , and it's even better than the original, which is rare in the movie industry.
2208;The actors are terrific, and the sets and special effects are extremely impressive.
2209;The special edition has a few scenes cut from the original release.
2210;The aliens looked a lot more realistic in this one which helped add to the believability of the film.
2211;The original holds up a bit better because suspense will always hold up where action sequences will be outdone with new technology.
2212;T2 Judgement Day, and Aliens.
2213;Still, this moive is the one to beat!
2214;Aliens is indeed one of those rare sequals that surpasses the original.
2215;This movie is so intense, exciting, unsettling, and exhausting.
2216;thriller with a lot of depth and heart to it.
2217;What really grabed me most in this film was the relationship between Ripley [Sigourney Weaver] and the little girl Newt [Carrie Henn, who gives an excellent performance for a young kid].
2218;These are characters we come to know and care about, something that is rare in action or sci.
2219;Supporting characters are also fantasic, my favorite being Hudson, played by Bill Paxton with sarcasm, guts, and energy.
2220;The extra 17 minutes of footage in this Special Edition help develop the plot and characters more.
2221;These added scenes help the movie rather than hurt it.
2222;I recommend you get this Special Edition of this great action/sci.
2223;To set the record straight: this movie is great action sci.
2224;fi, highly entertaining and very good looking.
2225;the main difference between the two is that while Aliens is a great film, Alien is totally a work of art in every level: in cinema, production and art design, visually and musically.
2226;Alien musical score stands alone as an indivual masterpiece, something I cannot say about the good James Horner score.
2227;"a movie is not better than other only because one has great action sequences and the other not: Alien is more for the patient, a much more cerebral movie that builds the suspense just like anything on Hitchcock's
2228;Aliens is a good excuse to show bullets blasting aliens, that's it.
2229;The Special Effects are incredible.
2230;There are movies and there are movies.
2231;The best movies are those that can transcend time.
2232;Aliens is, but whether you can watch it several times in a week, that's up for debate.
2233;personally, this is my favorite Aliens movie.
2234;Either way, THIS Aliens was a nice sequel.
2235;It also laid the foundation for many other film makers and movies and in a way, it really created a whole new genre.
2236;I love the idea of a group of soldiers who aren't scared to shoot the `monsters'.
2237;this particular movie moves forward the whole sci.
2238;His creations are celebrated by fans all over.
2239;Star Trek or Star Wars (or even the other 2 Alien movies that came after) are better suited.
2240;The Special Edition, which I am assuming is like the Director's Cut, adds more scenes and helps flesh things out.
2241;aliens is a classic in it's own right.
2242;For the price it is at, it's a great deal for an excellent movie.
2243;But, I'll put an exception for Sigourney Weaver, my female Rambo heroine with a mother instinct and motherly love.
2244;The female Rambo manages to save the girl and destroys a lot of eggs with her fire machine gun.
2245;Of course, in the end she succeeded in saving the girl and Michael Biehn who was out with injury and the upper half of the humanoid who said to her, """"Not bad for a human""""."""
2246;james Cameron, the director of this film and numerous other box office hits schi.
2247;fi's cleverly arranges the introduction of an instrument at the beginning that functions as a life saving weapon at the end.
2248;Sigourney gives her best in this one.
2249;But don't miss this one, it's action packed and with a good story.
2250;Aliens has been one of my favorite movies since it's original release.
2251;James Cameron created a masterpiece of a sequel that I will always enjoy watching.
2252;Those 17 minutes helped the movie in every way.
2253;I enjoyed the extra footage in Aliens as it helped explain why Ripley was so attatched to Newt and willing to go against the Queen for her.
2254;I encourage others to ignore the negative comments about the Director's Cut and enjoy a more proper version of this film.
2255;Aliens tastefully mixes fright and suspense with great action.
2256;I truly enjoy the very brief glimpses of the aliens throughout the early parts of the film.
2257;I feel that adds to the over.
2258;all terror they inspire when they appear because you want to stare and absorb their shadowed appearance but Cameron brilliantly disallows that.
2259;As with The Abyss and Terminator 2 Director's Cuts, I am pleased James Cameron takes the time to develop worth.
2260;He is indeed a thorough director and Aliens is a fine example of this.
2261;My highest recommendation is awarded to this sequel.
2262;But let me tell you, when I finally saw it, I wanted to kick myself for wasting so much time!First, I felt that the dialogue was real and genuine .
2263;The interactions between the characters, their dialogue, even their expressions are all beautifully written and acted.
2264;Giger's designs (he created the alien body prototype in the first movie) are just as breathtaking, frightening, and surreal in this sequel as they were in the original, and the alien queen is a masterpiece!
2265;The setting is also well done .
2266;the landscape of LV.426 (the planet that Ripley and the team of marines go to investigate) is haunting and dark, giving it a real feeling of alienness.
2267;She is, to my mind the strongest female character in this genre to date, and yet she does retain a measure of femininity.
2268;Also, Ripleys romantic bond with Hicks (one of the Marines) is there, but is done in a nice subtle way that doesnt ditract from the sci.
2269;having the extra 18 or so minutes was a wonderful thing for me, having seen both the TV and regular video versions MANY times.
2270;See it, for me, for yourself, for posterity.
2271;I have to agree with most of the 5 star reviews, Aliens is a great, classic science fiction film.
2272;"Unfortuantely, Cameron's ""Special Edition"" takes a masterpiece and messes it up."
2273;"For example, the ""restored"" opening sequence of the space miners makes literal what we simply imagined in the original."
2274;climactic sequence featuring gattling guns.
2275;I loved this movie back in the day and now I finally have it to watch when in home chillin
2276;Simply put, Aliens is one of the best films of any genre to ever be released.
2277;"I wouldn't go so far as to say it ""far surpassed"" the original, but it is certainly a worthy successor to the sci."
2278;The characters are still both lovable and believable, and Ripley, the series' heroine, gains a whole new, interesting dimension with the film's examination of her maternal instincts.
2279;In any case, Alien and Aliens are by far the best of the Alien saga.
2280;see for fans of action, horror, science fiction, or movies in general.
2281;This film came out to much deserved acclaim in 1986.
2282;It is, to say the least, an 1980's centerpiece and masterpiece.
2283;It holds the rare honor of cult classic supremacy and also won numerous awards as well.
2284;It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including a Best Actress nomination for Sigourney Weaver.
2285;It won in the categories of Sound Effects Editing and Visual Effects.
2286;Aliens succeeds on every level.
2287;Alien, an outstanding film, was much more psychological.
2288;This is an all out action movie extravaganza.
2289;You can clearly see that James Cameron was perfecting his action movie craft.
2290;Aliens is in my honest opinion the best offering which the action genre has ever produced, it can hold it's own when compared with the very best movies of the eighties.
2291;the character of Ripley is given a very strong willful interpretation by Sigourney Weaver, her performance here when contrasted with the more demure and warm roles she has played reveal her to be an actress with some range.
2292;The secondary characters in the movie were likewise, well constructed and interpreted.
2293;The main villain in the movie, the character Burke, is very well acted by the actor who plays him, this guy comes across as oily and psychotic as.
2294;Amother good performance was that of the young girl.
2295;As the tension builds and the body count rises, there are enough twists and changes to keep it extremely tense and entertaining.
2296;sorry), even the little girl is portrayed as having more courage than one whining scared marine.
2297;The movie was brilliant as compared to any other horror or action movie I've ever seen.
2298;packed, but it was also rather political, and very dramatic.
2299;I'll have to tell you though that this movie :gasp: will actually make you think!
2300;The movie Aliens itself has grown to become one of my most loved movies along with Star Wars (God thank you for George Lucas), but I remember seeing Aliens when I was only seven or eight years old in '97 or '98 on video and thinking it was the best movie ever created, ive seen Aliens at least fifteen times.
2301;The collectors edition comes with a seperate disc for interviews and features which are actually quite interesting, I watched them all, and the original movie and the new edition.
2302;It has so much great stuff in it that it's hard to explain it all in a review .
2303;It is quite plausible, and very good for a sci.
2304;fi story, setting up an excellent sequel to the first movie.
2305;The characters are lovable and believable, from the gruff Apone to the tough but lovable Hicks and Vasquez and the cowardly Carter, and of course Ripley.
2306;She was nominated for best actress for this, with good cause.
2307;Newt is excellent as well.
2308;Also the sets, and the movie's style are fantastic (as in all the Alien movies).
2309;Another highlight is the special effects .
2310;they still stand up today, and this movie came out in 1986.
2311;The aliens are very menacing and organic.
2312;this movie is great all the way through.
2313;It is very suspenseful and exciting, but definitely not at the cost of a good story, as is sometimes the case.
2314;The ending is gripping and terrifying.
2315;fi movie, it's a fantastic movie, period.
2316;This is the version with the extra dialog, softening her up a bit.
2317;It was actually kind of good because it made her transformation all the more logical.
2318;The movie is rip roaring great on all levels.
2319;The bugs are on screen much more than in Alien, and the momma bug is a sight to see.
2320;"The two momma figures battling it out over their progeny (sort of) is truly great (""leave her alone, you beotch!"""
2321;Special effects are good, Sigourney Weaver is good, Bill Paxton as the coward is excellent, livening things up a bit.
2322;rate now, 15 years later.
2323;as with any James Cameron ( The Terminator and Titanic ) production, his films are always of epic proportion.
2324;Cameron not only wants to tell a story, but uses many long cuts and extended versions of scenes to draw the audience in and does a fine job of keeping them on their toes.
2325;Aliens , the sequel to the 1979 hit Alien , might be his best example.
2326;then he brings on an onslaught of thunderous action sequences, riveting special effects extravaganzas, grisly nightmare scenes, and a kick.
2327;Aliens succeeds for many reasons: the supporting cast, including Michael Biehn as a quiet, yet resourceful commanding officer, Bill Paxton as a smart.
2328;as well as being a sequel that is informative and stylish enough that it can be enjoyed by those who either did not see the original film or even did not like it.
2329;and the sequel takes full advantage in a spellbinding nightmare scene and a few takes with Henn as she is able to show her caring, non.
2330;Rivals Terminator 2: Judgement Day as his best action film.
2331;James Cameron's Aliens is a great film long before his 'Titanic' venture.
2332;It was the best of any Sci.
2333;fi movie up to that time and for decades beyond.
2334;I have seen both hundreds of times, they are great works of cinema.
2335;Aliens, is one of my favorite films.
2336;it is a sequel, but it's a good sequel.
2337;It has all the screams and edge.
2338;seat excitement of Alien1 and arguably more due to the number of monsters.
2339;There's plently of action throughout most of the film.2.
2340;It's a story of survival.
2341;Survival stories tug at the core of human existence.
2342;In that regard, you can't help but be interested at least.
2343;The players look inside themselves, realize their faults and concentrate on their strengths to support the team.
2344;One overriding theme in the film is the charactors' loyalty to eachother.
2345;This loyalty is contrasted in the company representative charactor and his fate sends a chilling message to viewers about this behavior.4.
2346;I enjoy films that have what I call, classic lines .
2347;Jaws is one lone classic line.
2348;I personally enjoyed the sergeant's lines about the corps when they are waking up.
2349;Bill Paxton, who I find utterly obnoxious in most of his rolls, has a few good ones.
2350;This film was made in good old 1980's before all that modern behavior became acceptable in our living rooms.6.
2351;To her credit, the scene with Sig operating the loader against the creature is both exciting and believable.
2352;All in all, the extra footage makes the movie even better.
2353;Otherwise, apart from the aforementioned plot flaw, Aliens is a great movie and one of my favorites.
2354;have loved it for years.
2355;Good for a thriller, enjoy it.
2356;My idea of a good late night edge of your seat classic thriller a plus of this movie from the others is the fact that now there is more than just one type of alien and there all nasty but the queen is the best of them all.
2357;This movie is a must have to any alien fan and my personal favorite of all the ALIENS films.
2358;ray player, this is the first official movie I saw on blu.
2359;ray disc and player, since they are so new to me.
2360;Aliens is the best of the Alien series of films, it is one of the greatest action films ever made, and it is, along with The Terminator and The Abyss, one of the defining films of James Cameron's early career.
2361;Both are excellent films, and for the picture to be truly appreciated, both are essential.
2362;the special features are equally worthwhile, most especially the commentary and introduction by Cameron.
2363;ass action I was about to experience.
2364;If you have seen it, rest assured it got the royal treatment on Blu.
2365;It's one of my favorite movies ever, and it's one of the best Blu.
2366;James Cameron had some pretty big shoes to fill when he set out to do a sequel to one of the most hauntingly beautiful films of all time.
2367;The best part of the Alien series is how easy they are to write about.
2368;For many, this is the greatest.
2369;A few fairly amusing people, and I do like Bishop, but I have to say I was shocked when Michael Biehn survived because I had never noticed that he was there previously.
2370;James Cameron also provides us his typically great dialogue, such as Get away from her, you *****!
2371;This was the most fun of the original trilogy.
2372;Aliens is the perfect Sci.
2373;The directors cut is a longer than the original and has a lot more scenes.
2374;The marines transport is destroyed by the Aliens and with it most of their ammunition.
2375;The action scenes are convincing and heart renching.
2376;And of course the film is significant in having a female lead who has a real role instead of being a love interest.
2377;probably the best science fiction film made and one of the better films in any catagory.
2378;great film alitle better than the first great action gore weaver is exelent her best movie everrrrrr see it better than the first alitle 5 stars worth getting james cameron is brillent.
2379;Aliens is the masterful work of James Cameron and I believe that it actually surpasses the original Alien in action, suspense, sound, and special effects, but not in claustriphobia.
2380;The extra footage that some of these reviewers are complaining about is great.
2381;They are saying that it is not essential, of course it is not essential or else it would have been in the original movie, the extra footage is more of a gift to fans of James Cameron and the Alien series who want to see James Cameron's original dream.
2382;I think the extra footage is great and completes James Cameron's masterpiece.
2383;I recommend all of the Alien movies but this one is the best.
2384;I love this movie, not just because it's a kick ass thrilling sci.
2385;fi movie, which it is, but for the universal human themes it presents.
2386;She's scared spitless, but has to suck it up and do it anyway.
2387;faceted strengths of the female lead character.
2388;Quite simply, this has to be one the best Sci.
2389;Cruising with Ridley Scott as he explores the darker side of terra.
2390;forming and seeing, for the first time, what this actually encompasses has some great, character.
2391;Personally, seeing Newt's family before as they introduce our Xeno.
2392;hero to those juicy colonist daughters definitely gives her more oomph.
2393;Combining this with newly revised scenes recounting the tales of Ripley's daughter, some nice pictures of the equipment used on that wonderful wasteland of a planet, and the almighty autoguns gives the viewer something that lacked with other released versions.
2394;It gives them a clearer window to see everyone's favorite extraterrestrial (with explanations given on Alien ecology that were left out of the Alien that explain the breeding cycle and the roles of the drone) as they fight the good fight against that consuming human blight.
2395;i think Aliens is one of the best sci.
2396;The additional footage in the latter half while not bad did make it seem not as fast paced and exciting as the original version.
2397;I just want one of my favorite movies ever back.
2398;"Aliens is the near perfect sequel to the original ""Alien"" movie."
2399;Much of the credit for its excellence must go to James Cameron, who both wrote the screenplay, and also directed, what is generally acknowledged as a classic in the genre.
2400;Full of twists and turns, Aliens holds your attention to the very end.
2401;this film firmly established the character Ripley as a science fiction icon, and helped define the female action hero.
2402;Like the original, Aliens has a good supporting cast, though perhaps not as distinguished.
2403;Young actress Carrie Henn is wonderful as Newt.
2404;"And Lance Hendrickson is Bishop, a ""synthetic"" you can trust."
2405;the special effects hold up rather well, though most of exterior scenes of the planet, buildings, vehicles and ships look a bit dated.
2406;The background provides insight into Ripley's relationship with Newt.
2407;Also included is an interview with James Cameron, which provides information about the film and also the man.
2408;Aliens SE, while not replete with extras, does provide a completed version of this terrific film.
2409;"Nobody believed her story about the ""Aliens"" being on the planet LV.426."
2410;Excellent sequel matches the brilliance of the first movie.
2411;i have seen aliens special edition about 50 times and i never get tired of it, the action the excitment it keeps you on your toes thoughout the whole movie.
2412;the performances awsome, i can't recommend this movie enough, now i got to go watch it again!
2413;The action scenes are very well shot, and the film, as a whole, is acted out very well.
2414;It's almost as good as the first one.
2415;Blu ray is the best way to watch this movie, the clarity shows things I never saw before.
2416;Alien and Aliens are two of the best science.
2417;Aliens is the successful sequel to Ridley Scott's classic Alien, and sets the tone for a multitude of future science fiction films.
2418;Moving away from the horror genre of Alien, Aliens is a pretty straightforward action film, full of violence and colorful dialogue, which certainly won't disappoint most viewers.
2419;Ripley must step up to the challenge and confront her fears once again.
2420;aliens is probably my favorite film in the series, due to high levels of action, colorful characters, and memorable scenes, but do I think it's better than Alien?
2421;This creature crawled, and moved across the Nostromo with great elegance, and was always able to catch its victims by surprise, often showing an advanced level of intelligence.
2422;packed sequel most of these aspects of the species are lost.
2423;okay, critic time is over, and I must say that the hive structure does work out very nicely in this film, and the aliens look great, especially the queen.
2424;"The action is very well shot
2425;this is my favorite film in the franchise, and it is that way for most viewers, but I can't bring myself to say it is on par with the greatness of Scott's Alien.
2426;I will always love Aliens, and will never deny it as my favorite film in this series, but Alien was a film that ultimately had everything needed to become a classic.
2427;i give Aliens a strong 5/5
2428;Aliens is a thrill ride that almost never lets up.
2429;It's one of my top five movies of all time.
2430;Sigourney Weaver, as Ripley, is just perfect.
2431;In fact, she's so good in this movie She simply could not repeat such a great performance in the other Alien movies.
2432;Aliens is as good as a movie gets.
2433;Aliens is a classic movie that will be with you for years and you will find yourself watching it over and over again.
2434;this collection contains an amazing amount of extras along with the directors cut of the movie.
2435;it is fantastic to watch.
2436;I love this series from the first movie to the last one.
2437;this edition has some nice added scenes.
2438;great movie and I highly recommend it to sci.
2439;This movie has more spaces to move into.
2440;The extra scenes have two very damaging effects on the film.
2441;first, the character of Ripley is changed in some subtle yet important ways.
2442;While this may provide a little more depth to the character, it detracts from her image as an independent, hardened, and cunning survivor.
2443;the second problem with the Special Edition is much greater in scope and effect on the movie.
2444;The Theater version of Aliens was such a successful movie because it delivered unrelenting suspense.
2445;in contrast, the Special Edition eliminates most of that suspense.
2446;all in all, this is still a fantastic movie with superb acting, incredible special effects, and heartstopping action.
2447;this version of Aliens is actually pretty interesting to watch.
2448;It provides a lot of interesting extra perspectives on the characters.
2449;If you are trying to convince someone that Aliens is a classic spine.
2450;ray edition of """"Aliens"""" features a stunning looking transfer."""
2451;Yes, it does still have film grain (well, it should.
2452;it was shot on film and removing the grain using digital noise reduction would also remove much of the fine detail).
2453;Fox has done a masterful job of transferring this for its Blu.
2454;the original theatrical cut as well as the extended version.
2455;ray looks exceptionally good in its presentation here.
2456;Audio sounds positively stunning at times with a nice immersive mix of the soundtrack (for a film of its time).
2457;cameron did the smart thing with Aliens.
2458;He adapted it and made it work for this terrific 5 star sequel.
2459;special Features:The big difference is the commentary track from Cameron and various cast and crew members.
2460;This is kind of a slice and dice commentary.
2461;It's a terrific commentary track and there isn't a lot of dead space so clearly this approach will work for most fans of the film.
2462;If you wanted to hear Cameron the entire time, well you're out of luck.
2463;It actually enhances the feel and look of the film capturing the Vietnam era references that Cameron was making with the film.
2464;all in all a terrific version of the movie.
2465;Aliens is probably the coolest, most exciting action film ever.
2466;The action sequences are adrenaline.
2467;These characters are so cool, you could watch them forever.
2468;i love this damn movie.
2469;packed, fun, suspenseful, and even scary sometimes.
2470;Sometimes I think Aliens is a little overrated, but it's still great fun!
2471;fantastic Sci Fi horror film, good guys die, the menace is real, scared the crap out of me back in the day, loved this movie, love the attention to detail, the technical aspects, the honesty of it.
2472;this one is the best out of the Alien franchise, I'm more of a Predator fan.
2473;This is one of my top ten favorite movies of all time!What I liked was:1.
2474;The action was hardcore and fun!
2475;I loved the many weapons and devices used in the movie(the pulse rifles, the smart guns, the motion trackers, etc.)4.
2476;The alien queen gets my vote as one of the coolest alien creaturesever created!
2477;Ripley showed how strong of a woman she was!
2478;All the new actors (Micheal Beihn, Mark Rolston, Bill Paxton, etc.)were excellent editions to the alien universe!
2479;I loved all the special edition parts that were put back into the movie!Overall, this movie is a must.
2480;see in my book!My grade: A+ or five stars!
2481;cause I loathed the first one so much, but was pleasantly surprised.
2482;EVERYONE is a great actress or actor.
2483;Even the kid is a great actress.
2484;Paxton has some great one liners.
2485;"Almost as if there are two movies in Resurrection
2486;This is classic 80's movie magic.
2487;The story is one of James Cameron's finest works.
2488;This action horror hybrid will keep you on the edge of your seat.
2489;hard fans of this movie.
2490;as in the first movie of the series, it all starts quietly.
2491;forming colony on the planet she first encountered the alien.
2492;(Again, the Director's cut has added scenes here, where heavily armed robot sentries keep the Aliens at bay at the compound perimeter.)
2493;ripley's stand off with the Alien Queen is one of the great images in modern SF and you'll be gripping your seat with tension long before the ending.
2494;sigourney Weaver carries this movie, dusting off her action heroine credentials once more, and is ably assisted by Michael Beihn and Lance Henrickson.
2495;it's the monster that's the important thing, and the special effects people can take great credit from this movie .
2496;the Aliens are among the best screen creatures ever created and the Queen is a work of art, like some warped dinosaur skeleton painted in high gloss black and brought to life to stalk our nightmares.
2497;whereas Ridley Scott made a great SF movie in """"Alien"""", Cameron has made a great action movie."""
2498;The last hour of this film contains enough tension, emotion and excitement to leave you rung out by the end.
2499;i recommend you watch it on a big screen with the volume turned up to eleven and let it take you away for a while.
2500;This extended version slightly improves the film .
2501;*The last half hour has to be one of the most.
2502;exciting in movie history, with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in.
2503;Again, a great movie, no complaints!
2504;Thanks so much for offering this online to watch!
2505;I talk about the Amazon Instant Video to my friends all the time, and having the alien series on here helps back it!
2506;My favorite comment: It was the first and most successful blending of the Sci.
2507;"She has a small army with her this time
2508;There's also a cute little girl to bring out Ripley's maternal side, for those moments between the shootups and the splatter.
2509;for once, the sequel is as good as the first .
2510;and the first was great.
2511;This is a fitting successor to """"Alien,"""" which may still be the best scary."""
2512;mentioned opinion that ALIENS is an improvement over ALIEN, I still enjoy ALIENS immensely, moreso in this format.
2513;First of all, I feel the film's special effects (in parts) are much more successful on a small screen , esp.
2514;screen effects with actors in front of explosions or fires.
2515;Third, the added scenes, in ALMOST every instance, add to the experience, and strengthen the film's powerful motherhood and loss theme.
2516;They also help to make the setting more fully.
2517;While I maintain my feeling that the film gets excessively gorey and gooey towards the end, and that the menace of the aliens is minimized by there being so many that are killed, this still is bravura film.
