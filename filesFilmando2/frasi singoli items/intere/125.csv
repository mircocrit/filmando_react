1;but the results of Lola's run vary incredibly.
2;"a third feature is the ""red scenes"" in between the main stories."
3;regardless, they serve to increase the peculiarity of this film.
4;Potente (who also contributes vocals to the soundtrack) is a highly accomplished actor .
5;and is capable of almost every emotion in the book here.
6;Bleibtreu, in what is a relatively small role, proves Potente's equal and it is surely only a matter of time before he too appears in a major Hollywood film.
7;They do, however, acquit themselves adequately.
8;Lola is, after all is said and done, Tykwer's film.
9;Tykwer has a wicked sense of humour in places, the toughs driving the car and the sunglasses.
10;wearing nun always provoke laughs.
11;The dialogue between Manni and Lola about Manni's feelings for her is also very well.
12;written, both in the German and the subtitled English.
13;"one of the most effective scenes is the opening one, a blurred shot of a crowd of people with a voiceover asking questions like ""where are we coming from?"""
14;Tykwer certainly has something to say, and the general consensus is that it deals with the random nature of modern life and also with the question of fate versus pre.
15;One thing is for sure, this film is best viewed with friends and family as you will need someone to discuss the issues raised with.
16;Rgeardless of the philosophical bent of the film, it is an action.
17;packed masterpiece well worth seeing.
18;This movie combines almost hilarious pure luck with amazing risk.
19;taking in a wonderful and thrilling film!Taking place in a run.
20;i HIGHLY recommend this to anyone, especially all you Germany lovers out there!
21;This is without a doubt one of the all time best films I have ever seen.
22;Cartoon animation, interesting polaroid segments, and a relentless techno soundtrack are added in a desperate attempt to keep the viewer interested in watching Lola run all over town.
23;Its a movie that get you from the begining also the music its great .
24;its a great way to see how life can change for any reason.
25;this movie was great just as I remembered it, even better since it was dubbed in English.
26;paced and set to a throbbing techno soundtrack, Run Lola Run is shot in the energetic style in which music videos are filmed.
27;Run Lola Run is one of the most original films I've ever seen, and Franka Potente is incredibly sexy in it.
28;Five stars don't even serve this masterpiece justice.
29;Run Lola Run is certainly one of the better films out of Germany lately.
30;The included music video is pretty cool as well.
31;This is one of the freshest films to appear in years.
32;amongst the best touches are the snapshot life histories of people Lola bumps (sometimes literally) into.
33;Run Lola Run (Lola Rennt) is one of the best European Alternative films to come out of the past decade.
34;Directed and written by the great Tom Tykwer and starring Franka Potente (born exactly 10 years after me) this film starts out with a clock.
35;You sense you are about to go on a time trip, and soon you're in the race against time.
36;garde cinematography mixed perfectly with cartoon animation focuses on Lola, a red.
37;haired high energy time vortex.
38;She has 20 minutes to come up with 100,000 marks all in the name of love.
39;a great soundtrack drives it all and the whole film fits together perfectly.
40;"Also captures the Berlin (I think that's where it is) atmosphere great
I:9914;41;It left me on the edge of my seat the whole time and it has a triple bonus with three endings.
I:9914;42;i liked it so much that i went and got it immediately after I saw it.
I:9914;43;The way they show Lola running is really inspiring and because of that I love running now!
I:9914;44;The names of the characters and the characters themselves are really cool and unique.
I:9914;45;Mannie is really cute and Lola's hair is so cool!
I:9914;46;They are both amazing actors.
I:9914;47;The movie is soo great!
I:9914;48;I reccomend you watch it with subtitles so that you can hear emotion and the german language.
I:9914;49;The beginning is really fascinating and the animation is unique.
I:9914;50;This movie will stay with you always!
I:9914;51;The film is just amazing!
I:9914;52;See it, you will not be disappointed!
I:9914;53;It's plot was simple, that made up for its wonderful essance though.
I:9914;54;The fact that there wasn't a whole lot of acting gave it a unique and likeable sentiment.
I:9914;55;I see too many people going to see crap and liking it, but every year I also find something out there that brings back my faith in talented filmmakers making good movies.
I:9914;56;Run LOLA RUN is a really incredible film.
I:9914;57;While not preying on petty emotions and cheap plot devices to involve the audience director Tykwer relies on something more important, he gives his film a vitality I rarely see in American film.
I:9914;58;I love this movie and I try to get everyone I know to see it.
I:9914;59;Just keep going and be true to yourself all the way."""""""
60;Watching an European film shows an abismal difference when compared with Hollywoodesque movies.
61;This one is fast paced, exciting and surprising.
62;I really liked this movie.
63;Visually, it is a very beautiful movie.
64;The characters, even the minor ones, are intriguing.
65;The plot is exciting and revolutionary.
66;And finally, the soundtrack is wicked awesome.
67;franka Potente is an amazing actress,there is more evidence of this in the Bourne Identity.
68;She has lots of charisma and pulls you into the movie.
69;applause to the Germans, you've come up with a really good one here!
70;Run Lola Run is one of my all time favorite movies ever!
71;The imagery, music and story all fit together so well.
72;It is excellent the way they show you how one little thing can change your future.
73;When I watched this movie the first time, I thought Great, Groundhogs Day revisited.
74;But when a little art and thought goes into it, instead of humor, it makes for a great film.
75;I could go on forever about this movie, but the music is an added bonus to this great feature!
76;This is a whole new experience in film.
77;It's brilliant, innovative, and so much fun !
78;Fast paced, with a great pulsating score, it plays with time and shows you how a few seconds can change your life.
79;the editing is a marvel, as well as the cinematography.
80;(Love the ambulance/glass shot !)
81;This incredible movie will still interest you after many viewings.
82;I thought it was good, I was considering on wether or not I should rate it a 5 or a 4.
83;but after I saw it I liked it.
84;There are twists and turns in this movie as Lola races to protect the destiny of her lover.
85;This is an amazing film.
86;I also highly recommend the soundtrack (which is even better if you drive a German car).
87;This is a great film to watch over and over again.
88;It's also really good to show to a friend whose never seen it before.
89;Tom Tykwer has truly proven himself as the filmmaker to watch.
90;"day masterpiece
I:9914;91;In no way do I mean that in a negative way, I mean not to intend that the film is of a lower standard with lower production values, rather that the film is a beautifully mastered technical film that uses every filmmaking technique in the book.
I:9914;92;It is refreshing to see a film like this in the midst of the commercialised, dry.
I:9914;93;cut, 'traditional' filmmaking that we see on the silver screen so regularly.
I:9914;94;as stated before, the film attempts to use a wide range of filmmaking techniques to help get the director's meaning and vision across to the audience.
I:9914;95;He also likes to emphasise that time is against Lola during the film.
I:9914;96;This can be seen when a young woman walks past and Lola asks her for the time, the next shot shows a much older woman answering her question, hence showing the importance of time.
I:9914;97;franka Potente gave a good performance as Lola.
I:9914;98;Yet, it is hard to say that she was fantastic, because it is a role that requires a great deal of physical acting and we didn't get to know a lot about Lola, hence the film wasn't overly.
I:9914;99;The real standout performance from my point of view came from Moritz Bleibtreii.
I:9914;100;He actually took on a quite challenging role and pulls it off successfully.
I:9914;101;He achieves his objective of getting the audience to feel sympathy for the position that he is in.
I:9914;102;run Lola Run is without a doubt, one of the best technical films ever made.
I:9914;103;A profound, exciting, new age masterpiece that has well and truly left its mark on the film industry.
I:9914;104;It's my very favorite foreign film and I love having it as part of my movie collection.
I:9914;105;All I can say is """"Wow."""""""
106;And now, after having seen it at least 10 times, I still love it just as much as I did the first time.
107;I've seen this movie so many times, I swear I can speak fluent German!
108;It quickly became one my favorite movies of all time.
109;First off, the greatest part of the film is Franka Potente.
110;She makes Lola a believable heroine, and she makes you want to dye your own hair flaming red.
111;She's tough and fearless, and will do anything for the love of her life.
112;And, I will be the first to admit, it's not a deep movie, but it's fun.
113;paced, exhilerating and just wonderful, and if you haven't seen it yet, please do .
114;it even appeals to anyone who has never seen a foreign film before.
115;there are a few movies that will hit you right, and Run Lola Run had me jumping up, dancing, and yelling at the T. v. needless to say that this movie did hit me right.
116;because of this film, I have become a fan of Tom Tykwer, and the lovely Franka Potente.
117;Tom Tykwer is a interesting directer.
118;"Winter Sleepers is good for its kind of movie, I really enjoyed it
I:9914;119;She can act, sing, and speek three to four languages.
I:9914;120;YES, She was just wonderfull in it.
I:9914;121;I would very much like other people see this movie, because Run Lola Run is a great movie to see again and again.
I:9914;122;A cool 'Goundhog Day' meets 'Sprockets'.
I:9914;123;this movie is great for smart people, u halve to watch it closley and pay attention to every detail or otherwise it would just seem like a bunch of running, if you dont pay attention you'll get lost.
I:9914;124;Well, you certainly will after seeing this movie.
I:9914;125;'Run Lola Run', a German movie, is fantastically made and keeps your heart beating rapidly down to the last second of it.
I:9914;126;Dare to watch it and a race is waiting for you.
I:9914;127;So the film is made in both 2.0 and 5.1 for both English and German.
I:9914;128;It's amazing how many films don't do this.
I:9914;129;But Run Lola Run's 5.1 sound is excellent.
I:9914;130;I'd imagine you'd have to be a fan of the techno beats in Run Lola Run to really appreciate it, but if you're at least a little bit into the music, you'll love being right in the middle of the sound as it does take advantage of the rear speakers quite a bit.
I:9914;131;The English 5.1 sounds just fine, but the German is clearly better.
I:9914;132;the special features are good, but not great.
I:9914;133;The commentary with director Tykwer and Potente is better than most.
I:9914;134;the commentary gives you some insight as to how films are made on the other side of the pond.
I:9914;135;The music video is neat, but I can't imagine watching it more than a couple of times.
I:9914;136;This film made my heart stop.
I:9914;137;I subconsciously held my breath in parts, for fear of disturbing its incredible movement and beauty.
I:9914;138;What an innovative succession of events!
I:9914;139;Just when you think it's over, Lola stuns you again.
I:9914;140;There are some movies which you need to see more than once to really know how much you liked it.
I:9914;141;Sometimes there is so much going on that seeing it for the second time ties it together for you.
I:9914;142;Every person I have turned on to this movie loved it!
I:9914;143;I suggest you see it twice at least.
I:9914;144;this turned out to be a great decision.
I:9914;145;lola is an amazing chacter, who is very easy to empathize with.
I:9914;146;the use of flash forward still frames gives you a glimpse into these character's changed lives, and does so effectively while not slowing down the movie.
I:9914;147;My favorite of these is a scene with Lola and Manie where they have a """"how do you know you love me"""" conversation that establishes the depth of their relationship without being over the top or weakening the characters."""
148;personal recomendation: watch the german version with subtitles, it's the best way to get a real feel for the characters and their reactions.
149;This film is in constant motion, only stopping to let us catch our breath before it begins moving again, faster and faster.
150;i enjoyed Franka Potente's performance a great deal.
151;She really displays a large amount of intensity, both emotionaly and physically.
152;This is one of the most original movies I have seen in quite some time.
153;The performances are very good, the filming style is great, the plot and all its twists are completely original, and the rapid.
154;Once I saw it, I experienced true movie bliss.
155;It's a fast paced high adrenaline joy ride.
156;Franka Potente shines as the gorgeous Lola, who has 20 minutes to save her boyfriend.
157;The movie plays in actual time and unfolds beautifully.
158;Often the lyrics just made me laugh.
159;I love experimental film, collaging styles and testing waters .
160;The running was never exciting, and it is FAR from action.
161;based as the heart pounding music makes it appear to be.
162;It was way overdrawn and it got to be slavish to watch her going and going.
163;I won't get into the details why this movie should be considered a great movie.
164;Yet we all prefer the happy ending over the other two stories.
165;to hope and have faith for the best.
166;And when the movie ends, we're left with the happy ending feeling, even though that's only one third of what's portrayed here.
167;I've thought of Lola Run ever since seeing it for the first time, in 1998.
168;It's my favorite movie in the world.
169;It convincingly proves that every action you take creates a ripple effect which affects the whole world.
170;So owning this movie is a must because you'll want to keep replaying the quick series of photographs which show their possible futures, depending on the time of day she brushes past them.
171;Brilliant acting and incredible filming.
172;Great music and cartoony special effects.
173;All I can say is God help us if there are more alternate twists and endings !
174;actress Franka Potente's character Lola has an uncanny resemblance to Fonda's character as well.
175;i, too, enjoy looking at foreign films for their originality and freshness.
176;It may be intentional to give it that European artistic and gritty nuance.
177;Otherwise, this is one independent foreign film I can do without.
178;I always appreciate the foreign cinema.
179;Belonging to a family of people who appreciate films, I knew the major classics of the German Expressionist period and the Sternberg.
180;Except for this, the film was very good.
181;"The film is successful at adapting a certain aura of contemporary German society, the same side that, like many of us Americans, watch a lot of daytime television
I:9914;182;this is a movie you can watch again and again and discover new things every time.
I:9914;183;She's the girlfriend in Bourne Identity.
I:9914;184;She's great in this movie!
I:9914;185;She has bright orange/red hair and punk clothing which offer a disassociative affect for the viewer, allowing them to critique the mainstream heroine and the priorities of Hollywood to alter her into a commodity rather than a true hero.
I:9914;186;She also has superhuman ability, first to alter outcomes (chaos theory) and second, to see into the future (snapshots).
I:9914;187;This also offers the viewer a chance to disassociate with her because she is unlike the viewer"
188;"This is a main point because this allows the viewer to critique the ""damsel in distress"" role that females normally play."
189;a genuine hero who is motivated to succeed so much so that she risks her life in three episodes/ tries.
190;She tried, tried again, and then succeeded.
191;This film is fun because it challenges society to co. produce instead of just take in a film.
192;brilliant Pulp Fiction by Tarantino.
193;Run Lola Run in many aspects tops both these movies in its ability to take an incredibly simple plot and turn it into an exgtravaganza of motion, sound and film.
194;run Lola Run is a brilliant combination of a very talented cast, extremely creative writing and masterful video and sound editing, which results in one of the greatest masterpieces in modern moviemaking history.
195;we also get a glimpse into random characters' lives through a sequence of camera snapshots, sometimes in a humorous way, all interweaving into the main theme which is the stage and play that we're all part of and how sequences of events change the outcome of the end of the play.
196;A silent scene at the casino provides a tribute to Apocalypse Now.
197;The 3 tries plot may have been inspired by Fritz Lang's 1922 Der Mude Tod, etc. regardless if you recognize these tributes, Run Lola Run is a captivating movie where every frame and every note of sound seem to be perfectly orchestrated by a maestro who is conducting this fast paced, brilliant symphony.
198;film making at its best!
199;On top of that, it is wildly entertaining showing the hot fashion and music of this Berlin crowd.
200;A true classic in the making and well worth the dough.
201;Lola rennt (original title) is an enormously entertaining fun ride that starts at full speed and never lets up.
202;The film can do this by telling the same story three times.
203;This gives the film some weight in the intelectual arena as well and makes it more than a technical triumph.
204;The cast is another plus.
205;Franka Potente is now something of a star in Germany, as is director Tom Tykwer.
206;Lola is a picture that succeeds in being entertaining and thought.
207;This has to be one of my favorites!
208;Rarely do we see the portrayal of a complex concept done so beautifully, in a movie!
209;This is all about using intense focus and trance to change a timeline.
210;Lola runs and runs (the art direction is stunning), putting herself into a trance state which allows her to accomplish her mission.
211;It is a brilliant example of how the mind can be used to change a timeline in a moment.
212;This film is beautifully art directed in the finest flavor of European filmmaking.
213;Whether one has an understanding of quantum physics or not, it is entertaining and thought provoking.
214;I managed to catch it at the cinema in Seattle a couple of months back and I was blown away by its originality and general awesomeness.
215;The structure the director uses to present Lola's hectic adventures is really original .
216;I won't spoil it by giving the plot(s) away, but the end result is an excellent film.
217;The soundtrack is very cool too .
218;I thought this was a terriffic movie, the techno soundtrack really adds to the cutting edge, urban feel of the movie.
219;If you havent already, see it now.
220;A little, comparatively low budget film, its director Tom Tykwer (with his meaningful, if not literal, film debut) and strangely intriguing star (Franke Potente) draw you into a world of possibilties, 3 possible possibilities to be exact.
221;The viewer is taken along with Lola to experience her choices, even the most subtle, and how they affect not only the outcome but also the world around her.
222;run Lola Run is definitely a star film of 1999.
223;Some were skeptical, but they all loved it.
224;truly a one of a kind movie and it certainly does Not need to be remade.
225;Lola was also the inspiration for my cat's name.
226;It was/is a perfect fit.
227;even if you don't usually like foreign films I think you should give this one a look.
228;Though if you become a Franka Potente fan because of it and want more then please steer clear of one of her other films The Princess and the Warrior.
229;this film lends its self well to Blu.
230;paced, innovative and extremely entertaining German film features an inspired techno soundtrack and great use of editing, camera and sound to tell the story of Lola (Franka Potente) who must figure a way to get 100,000 marks in 20 minutes.
231;This is the excellent premise that shoots off an extremely clever and modern piece of foreign cinema.
232;Great performance, great story, kinetic pace, excellent techno soundtrack and attentive direction make this film and it's filmmaker one of the most promising things to come out of Germany in the 90's.
233;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film an 8!
234;Turn on your TV and buckle up for an exhilarating 80.
235;Give Tykwer another 20 minutes and he'll do it again.
236;Tykwer does, and does it brilliantly.
237;one newspaper reviewer, after seeing this film, said that Tom Tykwer is the most promising German director since Rainer Fassbinder.
238;related people, or being in the right place at the right time, can influence one's fate.
239;"But ""Run, Lola, Run"" is brilliant."
240;One of the best films I have seen in a long time.
241;Wonderfully directed (great angles great colours), realistically acted (all the characters are so beliveable) and a brilliant and simple story.
242;I thought that I would be one of a few that liked it but look at all the stars.
243;Run Lola Run is an interesting film about a girl and her boyfriend and their struggles to survive the most grueling twenty minutes of their lives.
244;Manni is always watching over Lola, making sure that she gets to him on time.
245;She acts under pressure and runs everywhere she goes just to keep Manni safe.
246;Manni is depending on Lola to be the hero of the day and show up with what he needs.
247;She'll rob her father's bank, she'll help rob a grocery store, and she'll take big risks in a casino just to save Manni.
248;I bought the film as i enjoy foreign films (hollywoods handling of films is quite typical so foreign films add the something extra).
249;i loved it but the kids groaned at times when they had to see the same scene repeated 3 times with difference.
250;It was memorable and loved the direction and raciness
251;So many people here have said so many great things about this startlingly original and innovative film that I'll just simply echo it all.
252;, to the flawless performances by all concerned, this is not just the best foreign film of the year, but simply must be included in anybody's Top Ten.
253;For myself, I'd say it's easily among the top 25 of this decade.
254;Yes, it's that exciting, amazing, and original.
255;Was a lot of fun to watch with all its twists, turns and the games it played with time.
256;RUN LOLA RUN uses this technique in a way that I never thought possible, by giving us a story w/ heart and soul at blazing speed!
257;LOLA (Franka Potente from ANATOMY and CREEP) is a warm, emotional woman w/ a fast mind.
258;A great movie, fast, moving, totally capturing.
259;It makes you think, it makes you dance, it makes your heart beat faster, and most important of all it makes you realize how important a second of lifetime can be and how it can change everything.
260;This film follows three potential outcomes for this situation, and it does it in a smart, entertaining fashion.
261;still, this is a highly entertaining film and well worth picking up .
262;Run Lola Run is an intense suspense film.
263;The soundtrack is also amazing adding for an even larger on.
264;RUN LOLA RUN is one of those films that actually delivers what it promises.
265;In this case, a heart.
266;filled flick with an excellent soundtrack, and plenty of artistic weirdness to boot.
267;He takes the viewer on a journey of existentialism thanks to the unusual abilities of its main character, Lola.
268;dipped redhead with a high.
269;And she has the ability to change her future.
270;But I'd often heard people comment on Run Lola Run and how great it was, so I decided to check it out.
271;And I'm glad I did!
272;enhanced Lola, and her portrayal is believable, beautiful, and bizarre.
273;In short, a great combination.
274;i loved, too, the incorporation of overlapping animation, something I enjoyed in the movie THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS.
275;connections within connections is the main theme here, but one that is brought to life by a vivid script and excellent camera work (the dizzying slow.
276;i mentioned earlier the great soundtrack and that the director contributed his own voice and songs to it.
277;this is another foreign film gem, and one that won't take up much of your time.
278;But it's one you'll be glad you visited.
279;so profound reaction: Deep, man, .
280;conscious attempts to portray a strong (and hiply alternative!)
281;female character: You go, gRRL!
282;The charm of this movie is completely lost on me.
283;The characters in Run Lola Run are soul.
284;before things it wants you to think about.)
285;heartedly enjoyed was when Lola's rake.
286;That's really a shame because Run Lola Run is definitley one of the best movies of the year.
287;From a cinematic point of view Lola is one of the most creative and energetic films that I have ever seen.
288;Run Lola Run is just bubbling with creative ideas and really is a stunning ride.
289;Lola is also extremely funny in many parts especially when the film briefly delves into the future's of various small characters.
290;this is a perfect little film that stands up to repeated viewings.
291;It is smart, entertaining and is something that is completely unique.
292;One of the most entertaining films I have seen in a very long time.
293;Visually a remarkable film that never lets up for one minute.
294;Watch it a ye shall enjoy.
295;That's really a shame because Run Lola Run is definitley one of the best movies of the year.
296;"From a cinematic point of view ""Lola"" is one of the most creative and energetic films that I have ever seen."
297;The only reason this movie gets two stars is for it's look and the excellent way the movie was shot.
298;I like the Hollywood movies better.
299;this is an excellent, amazing, artistic gem that I want to get two of, just so that if I lose one, then I'll have a backup!
300;This is the best foreign example of the new wave of unconventioanal movies that include the likes of The Matrix and Go.
301;The premise sounds kind of dumb, but the execution is phenomenal.
302;In the great tradition of Bill Murray in Groundhog Day, Lola is given multiple chances to get things right.
303;This film speaks volumes about the potential that each human being has to change their life and the lives of others.
304;In some movies, the simplest plots produce the most complex and interesting story lines.
305;Through the simple and seemingly silly premise, the characters bring up very interesting questions about love, family, society, and human needs.
306;Like the other movies I have listed, I recommend this one full heartedly to anyone who is looking for a unique film.
307;A heart racing, pulse surging and foot stomping ride of a movie that is adventurous in its filming and reverberating in its effects.
308;This is an amazing movie.
309;I highly recommend it and enjoy watching it again and again.
310;I mean, yeah she looks cool and they do drugs, yay.
311;I dont think they connected the groundhog day feeling of it all together that well.
312;this movie is simply the best i have ever seen.
313;i am very into film, but this is simply great because of its wonderful story line, a great art direction, and wonderful camera work.
314;Being simple of mind I just sat back and enjoyed this movie as an entertaining comedy.
315;I say that watching Lola run is fun.
316;endings in Clue , but fun nonetheless.
317;sided, one side being full.
318;the acting, directing, and pacing are all perfect!
319;Watching this with the volume up is a surreal experience.
320;The most original directing I have seen in years.
321;One of the best soundtracks in film history.
322;The next time you watch this (and believe me, you will want to watch it over and over), just listen to the music, and watch the visuals .
323;Franka Potente is one of the most mezmerizing women I have ever seen on screen.
324;In the hands of Franka Potente and Tom Tykwer, it is absolutely riveting.
325;for all these reasons and more, see this movie.
326;I love this movie so much, and I've probably seen it well over 10 times, but at the same time it's hard to describe WHY I love it.
327;I believe it's the best movie I've ever seen.
328;Even though it's a subtitle movie it's easy to follow.
329;It's filled with adventure and suspense.
330;I'm sure everyone has had that feeling of deja.
331;well,that's basically what the movie is about!
332;It's unpredictable and it's worth watching!
333;We see how very small increments of time can make vital changes to the opportunities and chances one has in life, including whether one will even continue living!
334;Lola has some very dramatic encounters with her father, a banking executive, in these 3 versions of her running.
335;Lola was well received by those who had not seen it before.
336;The music is great as it keeps time with the action.
337;usually I don't care for foreign films, but I'll watch this one over and over again!
338;From all the other reviews, you'll see this is an exiting slice of Euro Cinema.
339;It's clever, funny and moving, and it's use of photographs to show the future of various minor characters is like nothing I've seen before.
340;I know subtitles can be a pain but it's worth the effort to hear Lola's real voice, when she isn't running that is!
341;This is one of the BEST movies I've ever seen I saw it last fall and I still remember it.
342;This is my absolute favorite movie.
343;I first saw this on the Bravo channel and was intrigued by the concept.
344;This movie was extremely refreshing in comparison to all but a few American movies today.
345;I loved all of the characters in this movie and the idea and reality of someone's fate being affected by time and the smallest actions of others is genius of the director.
346;This film is a landmark in all modern cinema.
347;Bought it as a present for someone and it was quite successful in pleasing him.
348;Watch this movie and find out!After seeing this movie I had to say, Wow!
349;The plot is not complicated but the way it is presented is thought provoking and riveting.
350;The imagery and color are vibrant, crisp, and rich all at the same time.
351;this is the kind of movie that will start popping up in film studies and philosopy classes!
352;We all know that Germans make great stuff.
353;Franka Potente (Bourne Identity) is just amazing in this film, one of her best roles in my opinion.
354;The storyline will have you hooked from the very beginning, and the ending just blew me away!
355;It was such a fun film to watch, you'll get in on the excitement as well!
356;The teaser for this film is that, every second of every day, you come across a choice that can change your life.
357;tykwer has crafted a film that focuses very much on fate, not just determining one's own, but also having it determined by other people and events, both predictable and unpredictable.
358;directed new style movie from Germany.
359;Awesome heavy German dance music .
360;Available in both English dubbed, and original German format with subtitles.
361;She's beautiful, and built like a rock.
362;Previous to this film, my favorite movie of all time was The Fifth Element.
363;I feel grateful to have seen this wonderful masterpiece.
364;I have watched many foreign movies, this would have to be one of the very best I have ever seen.
365;The music is fast and suits the movie perfectly.
366;Overall, its well written, funny, spine.
367;The most frenetic and energized movie since Pulp Fiction.
368;Tom Tykwer's German import features a potent Franka Potente as Lola, a young woman with 20 minutes to come up with big money to save her boyfriend's life.
369;The film, a technical marvel, spins this tale in real.
370;I've loved it since the first time I saw it.
371;but it's still a wonderful film.
372;This film is a refreshing and euphoric look at 20 minutes in Lola and Mannis' life.
373;If you do not try to overanalyze this film, you will enjoy it.
374;The key here is to sit back, relax, and absorb yourself in this fantastic piece of work.
375;It's a great movie, among my top 10.
376;Oh yeah, watch the German version with English Text.
377;I notice a lot of films who use wild filmmaking techniques to cover up the lack of substance in the film.
378;"This was not meant to be some tearjerking drama
I:9914;379;That is until the film jettisoned that idea and it becomes more energetic and it works better.
I:9914;380;Yeah we want to win at Roulette but screaming over recommended decibel levels.
I:9914;381;But other than that, she's as solid with everyone else pulling in respectable performances.
I:9914;382;kick opening and you'll find a good example to kill an hour and 20 minutes.
I:9914;383;20 minutes may not seem like much, and you may wonder how can a 20 minute section of time take nearly an hour and a half, but it does, and it does it very well.
I:9914;384;I highly recommend this film.
I:9914;385;An outstanding piece of work in any language.
I:9914;386;It is one of the few orginial movies I have seen in years.
I:9914;387;In this is category, Run Lola Run is one of the best.
I:9914;388;it's in German and the hero is female.
I:9914;389;None of this should throw you off: all of this creates one of my favorite films ever.
I:9914;390;the deeply talented and charming Franke Potente needs to do more films.
I:9914;391;This movie has got to be one of the best, if not the best out there.
I:9914;392;Love the movie, but this Blu.
I:9914;393;garde flick """"Run Lola Run"""" is a hectic action fantasy filmed with some unusual cinematography in the streets of Berlin."""
394;Two things make this a very good movie .
395;well made and extremely well acted by Franka Potente (Lola).
396;The music is fantastic, if you like electronica and techno you'll love it, and the action is fast.
397;Franka makes the movie work however, she completely sells you on the urgency of her situation, she is great to watch.
398;you really have to be a detailed fan to really enjoy it (a interview with them would have been cooler).
399;I loved it again when I watched it after I bought it.
400;She mentally goes through everyone she knows and decides on her father, who works at a bank.
401;all the while, there is this terrific electronic music playing in the background, not so that it's annoying, but enough to add to the feel of speed that the film has.
402;All in all, a superb film and one that I think anyone interested in avant.
403;garde cinema with a high energy level would enjoy.
404;This is one of the more inventive movies of the last 10 years, I would think.
405;ray edition, by the way, is terrific and worth the money.
406;that may sound too repetitive or boring for those who haven't seen this, but it is anything but overplayed thanks to the innovative camera.
407;"franke Potente, who has since gone on to become better known around the world from the ""Bourne"" films, is the centerpiece of this film and very, very interesting."
408;The looks of shock on her face, her flaming red hair and wild general appearance and the crazy things that happen to her are always fun to watch and hear.
409;added to the unique cinematography, which includes tricks here and there, is a pulsating electronic soundtrack that brings added life to this already kinetic, involving film.
410;I'll leave for you to discover how it turns out the third time.
411;Between these action sequences are surprisingly effective hallucinatory dialogues between Lola and Manni, and you develop a sense of their relationship.
412;This kind of gimmick has been used before (the most recent that I've seen being Groundhog Day), but this is the most enjoyable rendition I've seen.
413;consistent and the actors are so convincing.
414;With bright red hair flapping in the breeze, arms pumping, you can't help but admire the energy she has, even while faintly disbelieving that a smoker could maintain such a pace for 20 minutes.
415;There are some neat gems in the commenary, explaining things that would be familiar to German moviegoers (the identities of certain actors, for instance) but not to American ones.
416;It's a credit to the filmaker that the film is so universal that it can be enjoyed by any audience.
417;The movie is a truly spellbinding flick, well worth seeing and owning.
418;It's fast paced, fun and well worth every cent!
419;Run Lola Run completely blew my mind away.
420;Every time I see it I get excited and taken to another level by watching it.
421;It deals with life, love, the choices we make and most especially chance.
422;One of the most interesting features of Run Lola Run is that whenever Lola interacts with another character, picture flashes are shown of their future because of their split.
423;there is a connected flow to the movie.
424;If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend it.
425;It's fast paced with a great techno soundtrack.
426;It will keep you on the edge of your seat with its captivating story line and built.
427;And once the techno starts, so does the action.
428;"The first two stories are great and well executed
I:9914;429;this movie has several great qualities: the directing, the visual appeal, the interesting story, the incredible music (which adds to the feeling of urgency) and Franka Potente (Lola).
I:9914;430;Franka is very convincing as Lola and pulls off the endless running scenes looking like she could have been in the Olympics.
I:9914;431;And even if you don't, you'll still love this movie.
I:9914;432;This movie had a killer soundtrack that just added to the wonderful character of Lola.
I:9914;433;Lola was portrayed by the excellent Franka Potente, who with wild flaming red hair captures your attention, and leaves you on edge through the entire movie.
I:9914;434;1' in there for good measure.
I:9914;435;She has twenty minutes to do so and what makes this film unique is that it is very time conscious.
I:9914;436;She makes a few attempts, and each one explores cause and affect in a strange way, showing the outcomes of everyone involved and all whom Lola interacts with until the film ends unexpectedly.
I:9914;437;the camera style here is great, fast paced and edgy, and it keeps you glued to the screen until the credits begin to roll.
I:9914;438;I was also very impressed with the acting on the parts of the two leads, Franka Potente in particular who embraced her character with pure panic and conveyed a very convincing and realistic portrayal of a woman fighting for the life of her lover.
I:9914;439;cranking, video, film, black and white, color) but eventually settles into its own beautiful pace and never lets up.
I:9914;440;Potente delivers an excellent performance as the frantic redhead, running running running (for what seems to be a quarter of the film), her bright mane of flames crackling behind her as she sets the streets afire in her single.
I:9914;441;with all this rushing, it's a small miracle that director/writer Tom Tykwer is able to build these characters as well as he does.
I:9914;442;Even more amazing, though, is that in under 80 minutes they become one of the most believable on.
I:9914;443;screen romantic couples of the year, enough to make this one of the year's best films.
I:9914;444;this disk is surely worth picking up for cinema fans.
I:9914;445;Run Lola Run is absolutly one of the best movies i have seen.
I:9914;446;The art concepts and character is amazing.
I:9914;447;The actors are also some of the best actors i have seen, and it depicts german city culture/underground very well.
I:9914;448;Without a doubt this is the best movie released in 1999.
I:9914;449;Kurosawa uses Rashomon to explore how truth is in the eye of the beholder, while Run Lola Run, with its breathless pace, uses a video game conceit to illustrate a metaphysical debate along the lines of if a butterfly flaps its wings in China, will it rain in New York.
I:9914;450;Something that should be able to satisfy both art.
I:9914;451;An example is the blonde woman walking with the baby carriage.
I:9914;452;another interesting aspect is Lola's piercing glass.
I:9914;453;franka Potente's Lola really lifts the film up, her bright vermilion hair, cyan tank top, and blue jeans nearly mirroring the primary colours of light.
I:9914;454;She gives credibility in a character who is so much more with it than her boyfriend, whose over.
I:9914;455;An interesting piece of cinema from Germany, great in style and structure.
I:9914;456;Franka Potente gives an incredible performance, her talents as visible as her bright pink hair.
I:9914;457;the strengths of this movie are its unique vision, stunning cinematography, and pulse.
I:9914;458;run, Lola, Run does much to show us how our decisions impact both ourselves and those around us, even strangers, in a big, big way.
I:9914;459;Irony abounds here, just as in life.
I:9914;460;The visual presentation of this film is just stunning, combining all sorts of illustrative elements.
I:9914;461;The whole movie is also infused with a powerful, beating soundtrack (a significant portion of which is provided by Franka Potente herself) that never allows the viewer to take a breath"
462;Voted the best film by the audience at the Sundance Film Festival of 1999, Run, Lola, Run is a visionary piece of cinematic art that every lover of good movies should see.
463;'Run Lola Run' was very interesting, and is a great movie if you're in a philosophical mood!
464;This is one of the most creative and exciting films I have seen.
465;No complaints about the film, any fan of cinema will appreciate the camera shots, soundtrack, action, and humor.
466;Catch this superb German film before Hollywood decides to remake it (and believe me, they will).
467;This is cinema in its purest, most kinetic form.
468;The attention to detail is stunning, and every little image and incident is relevant to the taut plotting.
469;A wonderfully choreographed study of time and space.
470;what we have is a kind of Sliding Doors (or Fowles' French Lieutenant's Woman) meets Pulp Fiction with all the energy and modernity of Trainspotting, mixing drama, tragedy and dark humour.
471;This movie is purely amazing!
472;The plot is wonderful, that acting is superb and the soundtrack is fantastic!
473;Not only that, but the film used is perfect and the mix of blak and white and also film was wicked!!
474;i highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants real intensity and really good acting to the point where it seems like your in the movie!
475;Run Lola Run is a fun, fast paced, and uniquely styled movie.
476;fascinating to watch and insightful into how much each of us can ultimately (and unknowingly) affect each others lives.
477;the soundtrack to the movie is excellent and maintains the fast pace of the movie superbly.
478;i liked the start of each of the three sequences when Lola starts running down the hall of her house.
479;analogous to a wind vortex spinning off the edge of an airplanes wing and affecting passing bird .
480;sets the stage nicely for the scenes to follow.
481;run Lola Run is an excellent cause and effect movie.
482;It is just a fun ride, great visuals, music, and a little food for thought along the way.
483;the movie is best watched in the original language (German) with subtitles turned on as necessary.
484;Yet the fate of Lola and her boyfriend, Manni, always seem to be the same.
485;This is a rewarding film whether you or in the mood to ponder such issues or just to be entertained.
486;The best film of 1999 in my opinion.
487;It made me think, it held me spellbound, it leaped off the screen, and it was totally fresh.
488;This is the best action movie I've ever seen.
489;If you can appreciate cinematography like a fast.
490;paced music video, you will absolutely love this film .
491;by the way, I teach German and thought it appropriate to write the review in German.
492;Basically I loved the movie because of its originality and fun.
493;It still sets my heart to pounding and makes my breath catch.
494;Since the first time I saw it i was hooked.
495;That way you can really tell what they feel through their voices.
496;Run, Lola, Run is actually interesting.
497;After the second try, again the movie goes back to the beginning and the movie finally ends with a happy medium, after 2 shots at one extreme or the other.
498;The techno background music helps with the excitement of the plot.
499;I promise you, you will regret it if you pass it over!
500;this is a great film.
501;i think it is very creative.
502;And yet, this film is so much more than that.
503;stakes sprint, and it keeps the viewer as breathless as Lola herself.
504;slick, but director Twyker adeptly portrays both the desperate and the sweet in this story, with brilliant cinematography that takes this film to a high level.
505;As the depth of Lola's and Manni's relationship is revealed, the character form the heart of this surprising, thought.
506;watch this more than once.
507;I give this film 5 stars.
508;This and The Princess and the Warrior are in my top 10 all time favorites.
509;during the movie the song What a Difference a Day Makes is played both to create atmosphere and to send a message.
510;One of the main points of the movie is to show what a difference precious seconds can make.
511;p. s. hopefully this sheds some light for the 1 star reviewers as well, but I doubt it.
512;Franka Potente is wonderful in this film.
513;The direction is superb and the driving score is very cool.
514;there are three keys to the success of this remarkable German language film (with English subtitles): originality of conception, crisp direction and editing, and two attractive stars to play the leads.
515;She is smitten with Manni, handsome young man played by Moritz Bleibtreu, who forgot to keep his grip on a bag containing 100,000 Deutsche marks belonging to his mobster boss.
516;She says no wait, she can come up with something.
517;She looks at the clock.
518;Truffaut used a sustained shot of his young hero running to convey an uplifting sense of freedom amid action.
519;It worked for Truffaut and it works for Tykwer.
520;Franka, running in nicely fitted pants and tank top (with her white lace bra strap discretely showing) really is a delight to watch.
521;There is a kind of effortless release, without any straining of our lungs.
522;what Tykwer does with time is even more interesting.
523;I'm also reminded of the brilliant American film, Memento (2000) directed by Christopher Nolan in the way some of the events are played over again.
524;"It might also be said that this movie is the ""many worlds"" interpretation of quantum mechanics brought to cinema."
525;That the man in the ambulance regains a steady heart beat because she holds his hand is something this old guy can believe.
526;"The ""throbbing techno score"" is haunting and there are some nice action sequences."
527;This is the kind of (R. rated, however) movie you can see with your teenaged son, although he would probably prefer to see it with his buds.
528;Color, composition, story soundtrack combine to make this an A+ film.
529;There's allot of hype about the flick, how great the movie is, how mind blowing the music is, blah blah blah.
530;Instead, I went out and bought it because I was curious.
531;I'll give it credit for being original.
532;I'll give it credit for knotting up all the details.
533;I'll give it credit for energy, as it had a lot.
534;The music, house music, which you can find in most new age independent films.
535;Watch it in German with the subtitles, because the English dub is so over.
536;You'll enjoy it more in German, as I did.
537;This is a fast paced, high energy film.
538;Interesting plot and 3 surprise endings.
539;(Side note:It's nice to see Germany from a everyday person's perspective and not a travel brochure.)
540;Run Lola Run is sheer brilliance from start to finish, never letting your attention drift from the action on the screen.
541;From the pounding techno soundtrack to the incredible camera angles and effects, the film is a wild ride to say the least.
542;blowing part of the movie is the alternate endings that show the various ways Lola must try to come up with the money.
543;i was wondering how the filmmakers would stretch this film out to feature length, considering the plot begins and ends in 20 minutes, but they have done a masterful job of it.
544;Simply put, Run Lola Run is not to be missed, it is one of the best foreign films you will ever see!
545;but now to the legions of good points.
546;The commentaries by Tom Tykwer and Franka Potente are righteously involving, both director and star eloquent and affectionate about the film.
547;(It's especially amusing to note that they seem reluctant to acknowledge that they are dating.)
548;Thumbs up to the commentary tracks.
549;run Lola Run was an enjoyable experience for me at the theatre and, much to my surprise, has grown on me since.
550;Potente's lead performance is Oscar.
551;worthy, emotional at just the right moments and comic and spunky at others.
552;Moritz Bleibtreu is wonderful as the bumbling Manny, and the script is a great innovation.
553;video stylings sometimes detract from the story, but as a whole, it's like a whole new way of seeing the world and, technical innovations aside, the movie is fun, comedically superb, and involving on a human level, a rarity for such a technically oriented film.
554;"This movie is great entertainment that has not much to do with the high budget Hollywood flicks
I:9914;555;Franka Potente does an excellent job with her character.
I:9914;556;She is garishly attired, with the stop sign red hair that marks the film, defying Hollywood as she trundles along the streets in each of the three segments.
I:9914;557;The relationship between Lola and Manni thematizes the their gender roles, and it is of note in which run the movie is ended, and how it seemingly reaffirms the status quo.
I:9914;558;in summary, the film is immensely entertaining and services an articulation of a deeper understanding of time and space and the ways in which humans react within said partitioning of being.
I:9914;559;And that's where the real strength lies here.
I:9914;560;Despite the imaginative camera angles and Quentin Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie storyline, the real focus of the movie is the interaction with the regular Joe, and the ultimate result of that interaction.
I:9914;561;But like they say, hindsight is 20 / 20 and everybody's the world's finest director from their couch (or, in this case, from behind their monitors).
I:9914;562;Some transitions are awkward, but the characters are there in full force, and the possibly.
I:9914;563;complicated plot is handled to perfection.
I:9914;564;Go for German with the subtitles, and enjoy the original vocal inflections in all their glory.You also get a feature.
I:9914;565;This one's a real goldmine, if you're into insightful audio commentary, as the two reveal bits and pieces the uneducated eye would have blown past without a second thought.
I:9914;566;finally, there are the prerequisite Theatrical Trailers, which are nothing extraordinary, and a music video from the picture's phenomenal soundtrack.
I:9914;567;mostly just Potente mouthing along to the words of one of the few songs with a vocal track, screaming, and looking a bit bizarre without the bright red hair.
I:9914;568;Run Lola Run (Lola Rennt auf Deutsch) is an artsy film that some people might not get when they first watch it.
I:9914;569;It is an interesting film, and I would recommend watching it in the original German rather than the English dubbed version.
I:9914;570;He kicks it into the sky.
I:9914;571;well, Tom Tykwer certainly knows how to get our attention.
I:9914;572;octane, colourful world of """"Run Lola Run"""" ."""
573;a wild action/romance that studies the ripple effect of our lives, and the changes we can make in the name of love.
574;Run Lola Run (Lola Rennt) was what propelled Tom Tykwer to international fame.
575;though no less striking visually .
576;"this movie is striking not only for its speed, but the sweet romance and the lesson about the old ""butterfly's wings"" adage."
577;But the world of Lola is filled with brilliant rave colours .
578;That momentary contact is enough to change their lives .
579;and Tykwer's style is a spicy mix .
580;but even aside from Tykwer's artistic flair, it's a great movie .
581;And periodically, we see some sweet red.
582;franka Potente does a solid job as Lola, an ordinary punky girl who loves Manni more than anything, and must find the RIGHT way out of their shared dilemma.
583;Run Lola Run is a kinetic, vibrant, and a romantic little look at how a moment can change your life.
584;Run Lola Run is a visually stunning film.
585;The film is set to the backdrop of Berlin which the director shoots beautifully.
586;The idea is fresh and unique and the effect is achieved quite well.
587;The soundtrack is apporpriate, and the scenes well coreographed.
588;this is definetely one of the best movies of 1999.
589;Run Lola Run is a superb movie putting Germany back on the map of exquisite filmmaking countries.
590;i hope to see more great exports soon!
591;"ray
I:9914;592;Yes, the techo music gets annoying but it's a really good movie.
I:9914;593;You'll see lots of recurring themes of this in the near future.
I:9914;594;How everything you do, regardless of how small, has some impact on the rest of the world.
I:9914;595;It's beautiful in it's insanity.
I:9914;596;This is one of the most interesting and excitingly gripping movie I know.
I:9914;597;paced film with an unusual narrative structure is an edgy, witty exploration of cause.
I:9914;598;effect, coincidence, and the proliferation of meaning.
I:9914;599;Just see it and enjoy!
I:9914;600;Needless to say, I jumped in with both feet and landed safely into a film I thought was pretty cool.
I:9914;601;I started with subtitles but this is a very visual film.
I:9914;602;So, it was more important to watch the action than hear the actor's actual German voices.
I:9914;603;After that scene it got better.
I:9914;604;still managed to be unique.
I:9914;605;I'm not even going to tell you how this is presented because that's half the fun.
I:9914;606;I thought this made it more fun.
I:9914;607;The acting was at least adequate, the story was unique enough and it actually had some exciting visual dynamics without going over the top.
I:9914;608;They were actually visually exciting and accentuated the entire concept of the film.
I:9914;609;It was almost like """"Schoolhouse Rock"""" meets """"Lizzy Maguire"""" meets """"The Simpson's"""""
610;Anyway, I actually liked these somewhat crude but stylish interludes.
611;It is actually a riveting film that has lots of action and only a little violence (mostly running, duh!)
612;If you like unique story telling with good production values and fair acting this might satisfy you.
613;I recommend watching with the dubbing due to the visual nature of the film.
614;The originality and freshness, that you maybe find in some independent features in North America.
615;But I found a more interesting and original argument.
616;This is like going to the gym, now that you run with her, your heart ends beating like hers, because of the action and plot of this excellent movie.
617;watching each run and trying to spot the differences and their effects.
618;this actress literally RUNS for about half the movie, she's in great shape!
619;It was the perfect fusion of form and function.
620;They were all intertwined so perfectly that I found myself drawn in more than I've found with almost any other movie.
621;this movie is driven by a pulsating, drving beat.
622;The metaphysical ramifications are astounding.
623;One small change can alter the entire course of history.
624;It never lets you down and is always engaging.
625;It also has very red hair.
626;And the price was excellent as well.
627;RUN LOLA RUN is one of those movies you can literally watch again and again and again.
628;paced action/editing, you have a terrific movie with gritty, realistic characters and action that won't stop!Franka Potente is a star in the making.
629;She's soon to be seen with Johnny Depp in the film BLOW.
630;Very interesting to learn how difficult it was for the actors to portray key scenes numerous times and still maintain the tension and fear so important to carrying the storyline.
631;There's something about some of those European action movies.
632;run Lola Run or Lola Rennt is one of the best movies like that.
633;Lola (Franka Potente) is running for the life of her boyfriend and for their life together, to save everything she holds important in life.
634;I had heard of this movie and wanted to see it.
635;i donated this movie to goodwill.
636;"There was a lot of action
I:9914;637;It maintained a great element of surprise.
I:9914;638;What was also interesting about this movie is that it had an implicit sense of comedy.
I:9914;639;Franka Potente gives a riveting performance and her screams can shatter glass.
I:9914;640;With it, it is defying imagination.
I:9914;641;So, in the spirit of Groundhog Day, she keeps repeating the day over and over again until she gets it right.
I:9914;642;But unlike Groundhog Day, this indie film has an edgy style, mixed with a punkish Lola and cartoonish pop culture animation.
I:9914;643;Wild, exciting, spectacular indie foreign film!
I:9914;644;I dont think I can actually say enough about this movie to tell you how fantastic and perfectly grand it was to watch.
I:9914;645;I bought the movie just off the basis of my friends reviews, and now the movie is on my top ten list of the best movies I have seen.
I:9914;646;The cinematography, the plot, the music, the actors.
I:9914;647;this movie is like art.
I:9914;648;planned scenes and very sofisticated camera shots makes it a very beautiful movie.
I:9914;649;Two thumbs up for the music selection.
I:9914;650;This piece is truly original and should be watched again and again.
I:9914;651;The director of this film is a genious because of its cast and technical qualities.
I:9914;652;Watch this film.you will like it.
I:9914;653;this movie, although shorter then most, manages to pack pure excitemnet into almost every second.
I:9914;654;What unfolds is pure genius.
I:9914;655;The concept and the direction in which the movie goes is fairly ingenious and the combination of the soundtrack and the visuals makes for a fast paced roller coaster ride.
I:9914;656;Lola is as brilliant as her bright red hair and the turn of events will leave you shocked.
I:9914;657;Watch this movie, because I liked it so much, I wound up owning it.
I:9914;658;And trust me, if you like to go clubbing, you will love the music.
I:9914;659;I mean, it's bloody amazing.
I:9914;660;there is absolutely NOTHING to this film, yet it somehow manages to be utterly compelling.
I:9914;661;But for the most part it's pure action, and it works.
I:9914;662;The soundtrack's perfectly done also.
I:9914;663;It was thrilling, visually appealing, wonderfully crafted, and pitch perfect techno score.
I:9914;664;This movie is so much ahead of its time and definitely a one of a kind.
I:9914;665;RUN LOLA RUN is a masterpiece in editing.
I:9914;666;lenght feature film, and yet the entire time you feel as if you're flying through it.
I:9914;667;The quick cuts and camera shot selection is superb, and fit perfectly with the techno.
I:9914;668;Oh yeah, and the story line is amazing too!
I:9914;669;One of my favorites to come out of Europe.
I:9914;670;this movie is an interesting take on public perception with a heavy emphasis on the Butterfly effect.
I:9914;671;The feelings are mutal from the woman, yet, three times we get a glimpse into her three possible futures.
I:9914;672;Yet, it's a worthwhile movie taking on a curious angle on how in some form or another our actions affect others just in the nature of our being.
I:9914;673;language film I've gone to see in the theatre, and it certainly didn't shy me away from seeing more.
I:9914;674;Tom Tykwer's unique writing and direction made this bizarre, pulse.
I:9914;675;the music and images make this a truly beautiful movie to witness, and it's so far held up to repeat viewings without boring me in the least.
I:9914;676;And even if you don't, see this one .
I:9914;677;it's certain to surprise you.
I:9914;678;This German film is a fascinating exposition in how events in our lives that my seem trivial can actually have a huge effect in the long run.
I:9914;679;I enjoy such subtlety, as it allows me to watch the film more than once and see new things each time.
I:9914;680;beyond the philosophy and creativity of the storyline, this film is also very well shot.
I:9914;681;Bright colors and eye candy fill the 80 minute showing, complimented with heart.
I:9914;682;The love story is stereotyped.
I:9914;683;Odd in a way, since I love this movie.
I:9914;684;tom Tykwer's LOLA is, in many ways, an extremely self.
I:9914;685;Endings are seldom neat and always subject to change.
I:9914;686;LOLA lets the viewer in on the secret.
I:9914;687;There could be something depressingly Sisyphean about Lola's desperate 20 minute run, except that the camerawork, the editing and the music are so faced paced and compelling that it's easy to forget the desperate situaion Lola and boyfriend Manni find themselves in and just enjoy the ride.
I:9914;688;After individual segments in which, first, Lola dies and, then, Manni does, we are primed and fully entitled to the fairytale happy ending the third segment brings.
I:9914;689;It is the exhilaration, the downright glee of possibility that keeps us engrossed in this hyperkinetic PoMo fairytale.
I:9914;690;But no sooner, does he break from the action than he picks right back up on it again.
I:9914;691;By contrast, RUN LOLA RUN is almost sweetly Romantic.
I:9914;692;Fictions, like the real life that informs them, have infinite possibilities.
I:9914;693;Third time's a charm for Lola and Manni.
I:9914;694;It is very philosophical and also exciting movie.
I:9914;695;friend Monni and she manage to arrange it.
I:9914;696;The style of the movie is fresh and its basic concept is nice.
I:9914;697;To people who dissatisfy with the movie of just acrobatic action and seek for philosophical implication, I recommend this movie!
I:9914;698;lola is sweet, worldly and young and so is her boyfriend.
I:9914;699;The story, or idea, is told in a fast paced, rock video style narrative, part light humor, part sharp suspense, with lightning strike synonymous time frames of the same characters and situations, projecting Lola's stressed mental state of adrenaline rushed physical endurance and high powered decision making.
I:9914;700;But it does, as happily as an adult, lust rewarding fairy tale.
I:9914;701;Like a modern day 'Diana and the Golden Apples', our heroine radiates stamina and endurance and beauty as she runs down yet another crooked path.
I:9914;702;You'll shed those few extra pounds yet.
I:9914;703;A great action movie, not too much violence and not predictable.
I:9914;704;the use of cartoons takes much away from the story.
I:9914;705;It's packed with urgent, kinetic moments.
I:9914;706;It ambushes you with an unusual plot twist a third into it.
I:9914;707;It won the 1999 Sundance Film Festival Audience Award and plenty of other awards, so it can shout that from the rooftops.
I:9914;708;It right away establishes the two leads and the story's central conflict.
I:9914;709;One third thru the film, when things seem at its bleakest, maybe she'll surprise you.
I:9914;710;artsy yet unpretentious, visually arresting and generating a frenetic energy, RUN LOLA RUN exhilarates.
I:9914;711;Few foreign movies that I have seen even come close to a movie such as this masterpiece.
I:9914;712;I got to watch it in German and then again in English.
I:9914;713;I must say the German language version sounds much better, but it's still quite interesting in English.
I:9914;714;I loved how they portrayed a woman (Lola) as a sort of Sorcerer type person who could change events until they worked out for her.
I:9914;715;You will enjoy the multiple angles shots .
I:9914;716;I saw this film twice at the theater, a real rarity for me.
I:9914;717;The two lead actors make this film.
I:9914;718;On a scale of 1.10 it is definitely a 10!
I:9914;719;Oh, they speak in perfect English, so don't worry about reading subtitles!
I:9914;720;paced, it has a great soundtrack and it's worthy of some respect.
I:9914;721;Plus, I think Franka Potente is remarkably sexy in this movie.
I:9914;722;And for fans of the soundtrack there's a music video for the single.
I:9914;723;What can you say about this creative and exciting movie?I was enthralled from the start.
I:9914;724;i ordered the cool soudtrack also.
I:9914;725;Its a good thing for him that he has a strong woman behind him.
I:9914;726;With her fire engine red hair, Lola is so powerful that she breaks glass when she screams, she can heal the dying, and she won't even let the movie end until everything in her life is right.
I:9914;727;this film is refreshingly feminist foward, in that the leading actor is a woman who is in flux and must save the day .
I:9914;728;This edge of your seat, heart stopping adventure draws you in by letting you know that it could be you up there running to help your boy/girlfriend.
I:9914;729;Also, this film puts the ART back in Arthouse with its punk rock style, its multiple outcomes and a 'choose your own adventure' ending style.
I:9914;730;director Tykwer has fashioned a massively impressive, music video styled film that also stops long enough to enrich each character, adding layers as the story is revisited.
I:9914;731;He also relentlessly toys with the medium, including giving flash.
I:9914;732;despite these things, this movie has one additional thing: Heart.
I:9914;733;This is a great movie.
I:9914;734;It is best viewed in German with (or if you can without) the English subtitles"
735;and the next I watch it, it will still be good.
736;this is not the perfect film, however it is engagingly inventive and intelligent.
737;which is part of it's magic, it doesn't pander to what audiences want, it gives the audience what it needs: creativity.
738;If you haven't seen this, treat yourself and get it.
739;For not generally being a fan of foreign films with subtitles, this was fantastic.
740;This movie literally took my breath away.
741;The editing is brilliant and the cinematography is amazing.
742;Run Lola Run (Lola Rennt) is quite possibly the most unique and innovative movie I have ever seen.
743;Superb acting,superb filming and a fast paced story set to a pumping techno soundtrack keeps you utmost attention and leaves you begging for more!
744;This movie is in german with your choice of english or french subtitles, but the movie is so well done you won't even care it's not in english.
745;This is a must own.
746;paced, amazing soundtrack, beautiful, touching premise, this movie had it all.
747;lola is a super hero.
748;This is a very fun movie with good acting and an entertaining soundtrack.
749;The director plays with time and chance with some very entertaining outcomes.
750;Well, this is the type of movie you can watch a few times and get something new from it each time you view it.
751;All in all I give it a very strong 4 stars ****.
752;Loved this movie when I first saw it and decided it should become part of my permanent video library.
753;Highly recommended for those who love non.
754;This movie keeps you going from beginning to end.
755;Usually resulting in the viewing of brilliant fare like Run Lola Run.
756;"The story in this film is filled with more thought than ten ""blockbusters"" could provide you with."
757;If you like this film check out Monsoon Wedding, The Devils Backbone, Best In Show, The Professional and East West to name a few.
758;even though critics reported it was the best German movie ever.
759;Very fast paced and exciting, but a great sense of character development for such a short movie.
760;This is one you will want to watch over and over again.
761;Very well done, and the music is great.
762;It's very fast paced, extremely clever premise, great soundtrack.
763;I am recommending it to everyone I know.
764;It's one of those movies that you want everyone to see so you can talk about it!
765;This one demonstrates how fate and split second timing can make all the difference in the outcome of any event.
766;although the final outcome was a bit of a reach, I forgave that tiny misstep because the movie as a whole was exciting and extremely original.
767;Run Lola Run is perhaps one of the best films to come out of Germany.
768;Although very artisticly done, it can appeal to many audiences with its wonderful mix of humor, drama, and violence.
769;fire programming, replete with jump cuts and other fast editing techniques, eventually found a home in the moviemaking business.
770;Throw in a cut every few seconds, the reasoning must have went, and it gives the audience the impression that the action is more immediate and exciting.
771;"The first ""Matrix"" film comes to mind as an example of a movie that successfully fused the new editing with traditional film practices."
772;"the plot of ""Run Lola Run"" is surprisingly simple."
773;Run Lola Run uses everything from animation to fast editing to a thundering soundtrack in order to create a sense of dire urgency, and it works spectacularly.
774;A woman pushing a baby stroller and a lady walking down the hallway in the bank are just two examples of this interesting technique.
775;The inclusion of intriguing concepts like this and others highlights the fickle connections between each living person on the planet.
776;If the movie's existential ponderings prove too much for you, you can sit back and enjoy Franka Potente's performance as the grungy, red headed Lola.
777;She's a real hoot, with a voice capable of shattering glass when she screams.
778;Because the script needs that bag of money out of Manni's hands, that's why.
779;"Yet despite a few logical problems, ""Run Lola Run"" is a heck of a film everyone can enjoy."
780;I thoroughly enjoy movies that handle their multidimensionality with casual grace.
781;Run Lola Run is in every way wonderful without in any way seeming to try.
782;The plot is engaging, fast paced, well written, and packed with enough detail to bring you back again and again.
783;While a viewer might easily enjoy the film simoply on the basis of the staccato story line, it might also be savored for its thorough and precise treatment of Nietzche's concept of eternal return.
784;A co. worker suggested I watch Run Lola Run, claiming it was the best film he'd ever seen.
785;This movie was fast paced and fun.
786;The movie takes us through the twists and turns of everyday life.
787;This movie has excellent cinematography with a story that is as strong as the filming and the acting.
788;tom Tykwer does an excellent job at showing us what cause and effect really means.
789;He shows Lola bumping into people on her way to Manni, and how life for that individual turns out with a show of photographs.
790;tom Tykwer keeps you visually stimulated, as well as audibly intrigued with the background tech music.
791;the acting by Franka Potente is great.
792;She actively portrays a girlfriend distressed that her boyfriend may be killed, yet determined to do what she can to prevent this.
793;moritz Bleibtreu also does a great job being a not.
794;He does a great job portraying how desperate his character is when he calls Lola.
795;So, as you may wonder, as I did, how can a feature.
796;It is one of the best movies out at this time, and you will want to see this, as you know Hollywood will be doing a re.
797;make on this in the future!
798;The movie is awesome and gets really interesting.
799;And, I loved Lola's hair.
800;Run Lola Run is a creative, exciting, heart.
801;thumping movie that I've watched again and again!
802;style score, and through the jerky camera work and rapid shot sequences.
803;among the many interesting features of the movie is the use of the flash.
804;It is touches like this, which make this film a cinematic masterpiece and a contemporary classic.
805;Americans are really funny with their prudery.
806;A fantastic, hip, and energized look at a young woman (Lola, of course) who must raise 100,000 DM in 20 minutes before her boyfriend Manni, who has to answer to a gangster about a large sum of money that he mistakenly left on a train.
807;inspired opening credits, using a striking mixture of incredible lighting, quick editing, and animation to give a unique feel to late 90s Berlin (it is also a somewhat more optimistic picture of Berlin than the Berlin of Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, which the film alludes to in its opening moments).
808;"All of the characters emerge into full people through each ""scenario."""
809;Lola's flaming red hair will help you keep focused on her running when the camera segues to its aerial shots.
810;Action, adventure, romance, comedy and drama all with a great soundtrack!
811;This is one of the greatest films to have come out of Germany in a long time (subjectively speaking of course).
812;It is a unique film with a unique feel to it, and it is also one of the more daring films of the '90s .
813;I had to watch this film for a German Cinema class that I am taking and I have to say that this is one of the most interesting films we have watched.
814;This movie is unlike anything you've ever seen or will ever see again.
815;Its the only movie I've seen that I can say I notice something new each and every time I watch it.
816;Its one of the few movies I've ever seen that can combine action and suspense with an intelligent plot.
817;I should mention I love foreign movies and I don't mind subtitles.
818;I thank my lucky stars for voiceovers on this visual masterpiece!
819;Interesting to say the least.
820;Beautiful to watch to say more.
821;I guarantee that anyone and their mother will love this film.
822;And watch it more than once, because it's the little things.
823;It is placement of scenery and the quick flash.
824;I will say no more than that this movie deserves more than the five stars I was able to give it!
825;It looks and sounds great in Blu.
826;known foreign film, but it certainly had a TON of buzz in film and pop.
827;The film is an exploration in how changing just one tiny thing in your life can have an effect on the entire grand scheme of things.
828;"The Ashton Kutcher film, ""The Butterfly Effect"" explored this same motif, but with far less captivating and enjoyable results."
829;this film works on many levels.
830;It's easy to understand but also has a depth to it that will have you talking about it with your friends for a long time.
831;I watched it in a college film class, but it would also be enjoyable to the general film enthusiast.
832;To me this is the most romantic movie in a while,The love between Mani and Lola is very sweet the movie is also the most original in a while
833;You must see this film with a loud sound system.
834;run Lola Run is high impact on every level.
835;The music and thumping of the tech music soundtrack serves as the score, the beating of the main character's heart, and the tick.
836;The visuals are a marvel, making use of filmed scenes as well as scenes shot on video and later transfered to film for a muted look.
837;See how the fates of peripheral but essential characters in the film change from scenario to scenario in these sudden moments of flash frames.
838;He denies Lola any help and reveals to her the affair without remorse.
839;"Lola is killed in one scenario, watches Manni get killed in another, but succeeds in the third because she ""surrenders"" to the almighty while praying and running with her eyes closed through busy Berlin."
840;She wins on that number twice in a row, a miracle.
841;She walks away with over 100,000 dm.
842;lola is put into service for the almighty when she gets into an ambulance (red ambulance) and holds hands with a heart.
843;"Manni ""surrenders"" as well, giving his gun to the bum in exchange for the money."
844;THis is a masterpiece of fate, divine intervention, trying to take matters into our own hands, punishing the wicked and saving sinners.
845;The theme of all the elements being used to facilitate either a disaster or salvation is so comprehensive and well.
846;This is even a good film for a youth group for teens at a church!
847;Yes it's in German and yes you will have to read subtitles.
848;This movie is one of the more stylish movies I have ever seen.
849;and unlike other movies that try to be stylish, this one has an orignal concept and is very very interesting and well written.
850;It's easy to follow and just a great fast paced movie.
851;she goes thru the day 3x.
852;all in all a good movie.
853;I loved the movie, largely due to the incredible music.
854;It is refreshing to hear an intelligent director and actor discuss the movie as it unfolds instead of a monologue from some hack who says This was real cool.
855;Actor X is awesome to work with.
856;The movie itself is fast paced and stylistically stunning, and it holds up to multiple viewings.
857;Interesting time shift concept for a movie.
858;This film is one of the best films I have seen, in many ways, you can't describe it, but it is fast.
859;This movie is so innovative.
860;paced and tense for the entire time.
861;You really have to pay attention during the movie and suspend disbelief for a while to really enjoy this one.
862;The picture is great, and the sound is outstanding (the film has a good heavy soundtrack).
863;The extras on the disc aren't too exciting, but it is nice to have both German/English language tracks as well as English/French/None subtitles.
864;i highly recommend this movie.
865;This is a beautiful film.
866;This movie will always have you asking What next!
867;Even if you don't understand a lick of German (and we don't), the subtitled one allows you to better gauge the emotions of the original performance.
868;fact, rarely, if ever, can match the impact of the original.
869;last week, I watched it again with a friend .
870;"the woman sneers and calls Lola a name, and then the film offers about a dozen ""snapshots"" of the events that follow in the woman's life."
871;(Something involving the government taking her children.
872;This is one of the best films I have seen.
873;The commontary is superb and explanes one what the signifigance of one of the quotes that opens the film.
874;I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves film.
875;between the pursuits are some drama scenes with Manni and Lola talking that are decent but the film really shines during the running scenes.
876;pounding German techno soundtrack during most of the movie which does get the adrenaline pumping and I personally enjoyed looking at Franka as she's quite stunning and gives a good performance here (though she would go on to do better movies after this).
877;this flick is a perfect example though of style over substance and the 81 minute running time is just right as any more would've made the experience tiring in my opinion.
878;***1/2 out of 4 stars, simply as a fun experience.
879;This is a great, fast.
880;Run Lola Run has style and energy, and I really did have a blast watching it.
881;the music, the photography, the editing.
882;one of the great things about it is that it stands up very well to repeat viewing.
883;watching it the second time was just as rewarding, possibly even more so, as the first.
884;This is one of the best films I have seen in a great long while.
885;The cinematography is groundbreaking, the storyline is impossible to predict, and the sidelines to the story are great .
886;That they ended up seeing it in America, in German with English subtitles, made it a bit surreal for them.
887;But still, an outstanding film all the way around.
888;This is an edge of your sit thriller.
889;the relentless pounding tempo, reinforced with the running and music score.
890;"the film, ""Sliding Doors"", also broached this subject, and I liked that film even better than this, ranking it 5 stars, but ""Run Lola Run"" was darn good, too."
891;This movie is pure genius and as such will not appeal to everyone.
892;The driving force of this movie is choices.
893;Her mind races for solutions even as her feet race across the city.
894;She interacts with a number of characters.
895;There are two pauses in the film where Lola and her boyfriend are discussing important issues.
896;While these at first seem strange ways of dividing the film's three separate sections, they give great insight into the characters.
897;What new paths can occur.
898;All in all, it is simply brilliant.
899;And that doesn't even mention the inventive direction and terrific performances.
900;"In ""Run Lola Run"" she gives a great performance as a sexy young woman trying to save her boyfriend's life by searching for 100,000 Marks in a twenty minute span."
901;so European manner, the film is a combination of techno and artistic brilliance, leaving the viewer entranced.
902;Though the animation part still leaves me puzzled, I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in European/techno films and/or anyone fascinated by Franka Potente.
903;This movie is quite riveting, so much so, that it tempts the viewer to lose sight completely of the fact that nobody in this movie is even close to being a sympathetic figure.
904;hypocrisy of modern family life 3.
905;All I can say is that a good movie requires a few things first and foremost: an engaging story and some interesting characters.
906;The whole thing is just brilliant.
907;editing is incredible in this film.
908;Franka Potente not only captures amazing emotion, she is able to catch the viewer's imagination.
909;the music is really wonderful, complimenting the movie without being intrusive.
910;1)This is really the best film I have seen in quite a while.
911;2)I can't remember the last time I had this kind of fun watching a film.
912;The camera work was great.
913;Usually, I'm not fond of subtitled movies, but I really liked this one.
914;well thats the whole plot.
915;it starts out with this wild cartoon and then turns into the real life which it is the most of the movie.
916;The excitment and action (not explosives) is great.
917;It has a good plot and the way the movie was put together is new and vibrant.
918;The music supports the film very well also.
919;i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to talk about doing stuff but doesnt because then you can dream you are Lola on this journey but you never really would be!
920;I actually understood most of the movie!
921;The basic plot of the movie doesn't revolve around the dialogue, but having seen it later with English subtitles was a much richer experience.
922;(As an aside, it's AWESOME workout music!)
923;"techno music ( alone worth the viewing) and forget the subtitles
I:9914;924;Lola runs with one purpose in mind .
I:9914;925;It tells us love must act, not think!
I:9914;926;Franka P. is totally awesome!
I:9914;927;She should be eligible to compete for track events in Sydney :) This film is creative, innovative and totally rockin'!
I:9914;928;The soundtrack is awesome too, good to exercise to, but do not drive to it!
I:9914;929;I thought this product was awsome, a classic, cheaply priced, and I recieved item way before the delivery date.
I:9914;930;This movie was creative (although it was in subtitles), and equally unique from any of the other movies I found over the internet.
I:9914;931;which she does in order to save the man she loves, and at considerable risk to herself.
I:9914;932;She races because she is determined that she can do the impossible.
I:9914;933;with her orange hair, green pants and blue top.
I:9914;934;Lola's race through Berlin proves HER love.
I:9914;935;LOLA RENNT, continually surprising us with possiblities multiple race.
I:9914;936;stop, emotional romp that captured the gamut of emotions from A to Z!
I:9914;937;I can tell whether a movie is truly excellent if it can make me cheer for the characters.
I:9914;938;Lola has one hefty set of lungs which she regularly uses to her advantage, and I would have screamed along with her.
I:9914;939;One important aspect of this movie was definitely the soundtrack.
I:9914;940;The driving rhythms of the techno beat really added a certain nuance to the movie.
I:9914;941;Another very important part of the movie was the inclusion of excerpts from Charles Ives' The Unanswered Question, a monumental piece of classical music.
I:9914;942;It added a very nice existential touch to the movie, referring to the unanswered question of life.
I:9914;943;evaluate themselves and each other, finding out what is most important to both of them.
I:9914;944;Franka Potente is superb, enough said, and Moritz Bleibtreu is effective as well, portraying a confused and desperate man caught in a bad situation.
I:9914;945;Wonderful acting, wonderful dialogue, wonderful action, and wonderful music combine for a wonderful movie!
I:9914;946;One of the most fun movies to watch, ever!!!
I:9914;947;It's really clever in the new approach it takes to time mixing (as seen in sliding doors, memento, etc.).
I:9914;948;Four thumbs up (my feet got excited and decided to jump in).
I:9914;949;yeah, yah, everyone says that about their favourite movies.
I:9914;950;but this movie is truly spectacular (even my spoiled north american teenage male friend loved it).
I:9914;951;if he can love a movie, it's gotta be really good.
I:9914;952;the film's fast pace and great beat won the hearts of directors around the world and sparked a new genre in movie making.
I:9914;953;franka potente (my massive crush), is so excellent as the spunki, german heroine, lola.
I:9914;954;the story tells of two lovers, who are very much in love.
I:9914;955;beat, has some nice camera work and a few impressive images, I could not develop any interest in any of the characters.
I:9914;956;i give the movie two stars for effort and concept, but I advise you to.
I:9914;957;Run Lola Run is sort of like a work of art, as far as movies go.
I:9914;958;Lola is sexy in a strange kind of way with her red hair and everything.
I:9914;959;This movie is worth owning just to look at Lola!
I:9914;960;All in all it is a good movie and I recommend it for anyones collection.
I:9914;961;The soundtrack is good as well.
I:9914;962;This is a brilliant film.
I:9914;963;Anyway this is a very clever story that takes place in real time.
I:9914;964;HMMM, you will have to see the film.
I:9914;965;It is easily worth the money
I:9914;966;That's right: point the camera at them and let them show that they can act.
I:9914;967;Tony Scott does it, Tarantino does it, Robert Rodriguez does it.
I:9914;968;If I want my brain to ache I'll take a rollercoaster ride.
I:9914;969;This is one of those movies that make you think.
I:9914;970;It makes you wonder and ponder that one question.
I:9914;971;The other point that this movie makes is that and I quote Lola """"With love you can do anything""""."""
972;She makes a good point and that is what this whole movie is about.
973;Finally the last point is that the soundtrack is so friggin good.
974;It has the best techno beat that I have heard since Blade came out.
975;This film was brought to my attention during English class.
976;Run Lola Run is an exciting, upbeat movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
977;Each scenario contains events that are particular to that version of the story.
978;Techno sounds blare in the background, forcing you to keep up with the scenes smearing by.
979;It was very enjoyable and addictive.
980;"Each time I watch the film I see something new
I:9914;981;This movie is a real eye opener.
I:9914;982;There are three scenarios of what can/could happen, and it's an eye opener because it shows how easily your life can change in a matter of minutes.
I:9914;983;One of my favorite films!
I:9914;984;I love it's energy and it's just plain fun to watch.
I:9914;985;It has great replay value as I've shown it to family and friends who've all been impressed by it.
I:9914;986;You can literally sense the excitement the director must have had making this film.
I:9914;987;I like how it shows how one person, one star.
I:9914;988;The original German audio with English subtitles is so much better.
I:9914;989;The film evokes humor, excitment, and mabye a tear in a few scenes.
I:9914;990;A great all around film, fast.
I:9914;991;One repeating theme is the movie's comparison to the """"investment projects"""" of Hollywood."""
992;That Hollywood has the best technique, stars, cinematography, $s, and gimmicks is all true.
993;'I found it to be a smart movie, smarter than most created on the West Coast, provocative, out of the box, with an eye towards embracing 'the what if we make just one change' question.
994;It's no wonder it has become an international cult film with an enormous truly diverse following.
995;It's not deep , ingenious, brilliant, or anything else that I've heard it called.
996;The funny part is that they weren't great concepts the first time I saw them in other films.
997;This was a very interesting movie.
998;What this movie was telling me, that if you listen with deeper understanding, you will get it right the first time.
999;Run, Lola, Run, starring Franka Potente as the flaming redhead Lola, is guaranteed classic cult film status for years to come.
1000;Lola lights up the screen in this German film which features creative cinematography and near.
1001;perfect editing, combining cinema verit and animation.
1002;"Tom Tykwer shows brilliance as the film's director
I:9914;1003;I recommend that viewers watch this film in the German version, with the English subtitles, because it is very easy to understand the film this way and adds to its authenticity.
I:9914;1004;Overall, this is definitely one of those films that gets better each time you watch it, a totally original, undiscovered treasure.
I:9914;1005;Because as pure entertainmentit works!
I:9914;1006;I rank this movie with Wings of Desire and Das Boot among the top German movies.
I:9914;1007;By force of will, Lola shows us how deep a love can be.
I:9914;1008;Lola was filling and satisfying in 81 mins.
I:9914;1009;From an audio/visual standpoint, this is eaisly one of the best movies ever.
I:9914;1010;The way the images and sounds tell the story is captivating, really making you experience the pressure of the situation that Lola is faced with (and the pressure all of us feel sometimes when faced with the choices of life).
I:9914;1011;Run, Lola, Run does a beautiful job of illustating the potential importance of every choice we are presented with.
I:9914;1012;This, I believe, was the director's goal, and he certainly succeeded.
I:9914;1013;Concocted with a particularly 90s gunpowder mix of comic books, electronica, video games, animation, and MTV, this film explodes onto the screen with color, fury, and, surprisingly, intelligence.
I:9914;1014;the basic plot here is simple.
I:9914;1015;The genius is having the plot twist back upon itself, stealing the video game convention starting the story over when Lola fails several times and giving her another chance to pull the task off.
I:9914;1016;This should be a cute but shallow gimmick"
1017;a exciting collage of media, Run Lola Run offers extreme entertainment with hints of unsuspected substance.
1018;Works great on my computer.
1019;I loved this movie .
1020;lectures, beautifully scored (enthralling score), acted at 110% energy and commitment by the two protagonists, a supremely women.
1021;positive story, a gripping fast.
1022;paced plot, suspense, fear, and a lot of sweat.
1023;This is one of the most inventing and entertaining films I have seen.
1024;Fast, funny, exciting and filled with meaning.
1025;to my surprise, the movie got better.
1026;manni was entrusted with a wonderful opportunity in life, the opportunity to complete a drug deal and give the proceeds to the boss.
1027;This will help him climb the ladder of success in crime.
1028;She swears she will help him.
1029;He gives her a narrow time frame to show up and help him, because he is on a narrow time schedule himself, due to meet up with the drug boss.
1030;next thing you know, the happy couple is in bed together, and alive.
1031;once again, the happy couple are alive and well, despite the ending to episode two, and they are in bed having another philosophical discussion.
1032;This time it is Manni with the questions.
1033;The question seems to be, umm, that life gives you the opportunity to interact with your environment, and it's up to you how it all comes out.
1034;But mommy helps him and loves him anyway.
1035;Thank you for that wonderful bit of philosophy.
1036;'Run Lola Run' was one of the best movies of 1999, IMHO.
1037;The creativity behind everything from the plot twists, to the music (the soundtrack, by the way, is fantastic!)
1038;ins, to the soccer analogy absolutely blew me away!
1039;"This movie is pure fun and excitement
I:9914;1040;Run Lola Run is a superb movie.
I:9914;1041;It's pretty much one of those movies you MUST see in your lifetime.
I:9914;1042;It's simply an amazing movie that everyone knows about.
I:9914;1043;there are many cool aspects to the movie: first, franka potente has awesome hair and is a really good actress, very convincing.
I:9914;1044;third, the characters are all pretty well developed and although most of it is her running (awesome that a movie title actually reflects what's going to happen in the movie for once), whenever faced with a character, you are really drawn deeper into their personality.
I:9914;1045;movies with subtitles are easy to get into.
I:9914;1046;subtitles are actually pretty great because they allow you to hear the movie how it should be heard, but still be able to understand it.
I:9914;1047;they are MUCH better than voice.
I:9914;1048;This is clearly one of the most creative films I have ever seen.
I:9914;1049;It was a huge hit at the 1998 Toronto Film Festival and at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival and well deserves every award it won.
I:9914;1050;In German, with English subtitles, this is a wild and exciting fast.
I:9914;1051;Starring Franka Potente as Lola, her unique screen presence defined by her strong body, engaging tattoos and raggedy orange hair, she has a mere 20 minutes to get a large amount of money to her boyfriend so that he won't be killed by the mob.
I:9914;1052;Instead of just showing us one of Lola's approaches, the film gives us three choices, and packs a strong punch with its theme of fate and destiny and how one tiny little move can effect not only the main characters, but also everyone around them.
I:9914;1053;You can literally pick your own ending, each one packed with excitement and ironies.
I:9914;1054;The soundtrack is perfect to accompany all the running, and the director, Tom Tykwer, uses a great mix of animation, still photography, slow motion and some very unusual camera shots.
I:9914;1055;The story and the characters were foremost and the audience is held captive, their hearts beating, as they join Lola in her run.
I:9914;1056;I even thought the plot was amazing.
I:9914;1057;The musical score was perfect for this movie.
I:9914;1058;I saw this movie in one of my classes and I was glade I did because it is a great movie.
I:9914;1059;Would recommend this movie to everyone.
I:9914;1060;thumping, high adrenaline romp of a wild ride.
I:9914;1061;like method, Lola is able to re.
I:9914;1062;It is the variant results that make the scenes so fascinating.
I:9914;1063;Not only is this girl running with everything she's got, the director strafes you with fast.
I:9914;1064;Each person she comes across causes us to catch a small but interesting glimpse into the effects we all unknowingly have upon each other.
I:9914;1065;And, remarkably, for as little time you get with the lesser characters (her mother, father, people in the street), you are able to develop a much broader characterization and even a better understanding of who Lola is .
I:9914;1066;But, all in all, I think 'Run Lola Run' is a very enjoyable film, and is visually pleasing as well as refreshingly original, story.
I:9914;1067;one of my all time favorite movies.
I:9914;1068;I love the switch off in time frame and added cartoon scenes.
I:9914;1069;Manni is working his way into a criminal organization, yet we can see that he is a genuinely good guy.
I:9914;1070;A bum steals the bag.
I:9914;1071;He wants to rob the store across the way.
I:9914;1072;Family and human relationships are portrayed excellently in this film.
I:9914;1073;That is up to the viewer.
I:9914;1074;Some of it's outstanding features are it's wild cinematography, flashy editing and high.
I:9914;1075;lola is a young hip punk with some serious bright.
I:9914;1076;riveting, heart pounding, flashy concept film!
I:9914;1077;Good thing it's """"kaput"""" at the end of this month."""
1078;I enjoy foreign films and alternative camera work.
1079;I especially liked the snapshots depicting the and then lives of the passerbys that Lola encounters.
1080;A fresh, simple story line with a pulsing soundtrack (in which the director and Franka sing) make this movie one of the most exciting I've seen in a long time.
1081;In addition, the director uses some excellent techniques.
1082;I really liked Sliding Doors, but this movie is much better.
1083;I went out of my way to see it for the second time after first seeing it years ago.
1084;Run Lola run is a movie full of startling movements of camera, bright cinematogrophy and a wonderful soundtrack to follow it all up.
1085;Very worth watching, very worthy of all the great reviews it has gotten.
1086;This director has done a new movie, Winter Sleepers which is also wonderful.
1087;This is a good movie for learning German, since phrases are repeated from scenario to scenario.
1088;As for the plot:Supposedly, the third and final scenario is the true one.
1089;The first two scenarios, in which Lola or Manni resorts to robbery and Manni or Lola is injured, are actually the more likely ones.
1090;Perhaps RUN LOLA RUN is poking fun at how neatly things usually turn out in movies.
1091;It's exciting, innovative, visually perfect, and accompanied by terrific music.
1092;The characters are appealing and interesting.
1093;Run Lola Run is as good as it gets.
1094;coaster ride that twists, turns, and boggles the mind with its remarkable profoundness!
1095;style from the outside, it actually has a profound message behind its unusual exterior.
1096;Plus it's got one of the most heart.
1097;racing soundtracks I've heard in a long time.
1098;This is probably my favorite movie.
1099;This movie will appeal most to people between the ages of 12 and 25.
1100;But you have to look beyond that in order to appreciate this movie.
1101;The most exciting, pulse pounding, loud and thrilling movie I have ever seen.
1102;Of course, he knows his cool and devoted girlfriend, Lola, will figure out a way to get ahold of the money.
1103;slick film, shot like a music video.
1104;I liked Lola because she faces the problem head.
1105;The movie is a pleasure to watch, with none of the heavy.
1106;About once or twice a year a movie comes along that renews movie lover's faith in the genre and keeps them going to the theatre hoping to relive the experience.
1107;The only thing that comes close to it visually are the post Wall Street Oliver Stone movies and none of them are as entertaining as this.
1108;The music is great in the way it matches both the fast paced moments and the slower ones in which the characters are sharing their thoughts.
1109;Part of the originality lies in the unlikeliest of heroines Lola.
1110;The director Tykwer however, seems gifted in his ability to show only that which is essential and present it in a way that makes you not only care about Lola but makes you root her on as well.
1111;It's this magic engineered by Tykwer that makes this film not only one of the best foreign pictures of the year but one of the best pictures of the year period.
1112;Let's face it, this movie rocks !
1113;No question about it,this is the best foreign film ever made.
1114;Run Lola Run is the hippest, most original thriller since The Matrix.
1115;remember how everyone, including myself, was so amazed by the fact that 1999's hit The Blair Witch Project cost so little to make?
1116;The other side of the coin is that they have learned to be exceptionally inventive.
1117;industrial music is a key to the enjoyment of the movie, but these sounds are universal.
1118;In a plot device so clever you will simply have to see it for yourself, Lola gets not one but three tries of twenty minutes each to successfully complete her task.
1119;All of them are startling and unexpected.
1120;the acting is uniformly excellent, from the two leads down to the smallest roles.
1121;As Lola, Franica Potente has an intensity and an energy level that is almost exhausting.
1122;Moritz Bleibtreu is perfect as Manni.
1123;He is utterly believable as a guy who gets himself in a situation which is at once scary, because if the consequences and hilarious, because it is caused by the silliest of mistakes.
1124;writer and director Tom Tykwer is a major new force behind the camera.
1125;Like many Europeans before him, the success of this movie may lure him to the bright lights and big budgets of Hollywood.
1126;Even if he refuses the call, which might be a wise decision, his is the kind of inventive moviemaking that will be copied over and over again anyway.
1127;Herr Tykwer's cinematic tricks are well worth repeating.
1128;Run Lola Run is a German import film with an edge.
1129;Run Lola Run is funny and fast.
1130;paced, driven by its techno soundtrack.
1131;thriller will keep you entertained.
1132;Run Lola run is a good movie.
1133;franka Potente looks very good with all that red hair.
1134;she is the best of the film, you can also see it in BLOW and in ANATOMY.
1135;the movie in very interesting and enterteining, it diserves a SEVEN +.
1136;This is a great one!
1137;My high school classmates loved it (which surprised me).
1138;come on people, it's just a fun film.
1139;(I'm talking to you 1 and 2 star reviewers!)
1140;SOME PEOPLE LOVED THE SOUNDTRACK!
1141;It is my absolute favorite movie.
1142;Every aspect, from the and then shots to the main character herself, make this movie outstanding.
1143;"what makes this movie great, in my opinion, is how they use their obviously small budget to its greatest end, and it manages to successfully ask the question ""how do the choices I make influence or impact those around me""If you like unconventional movies, you will really enjoy this one."
1144;What makes this film great is basically the hip, stylistic camera work.
1145;It had the style of a short film but was carried wonderfully into a simple yet engrossing feature length film.
1146;This is a very well done german film with a great soundtrack that shouldn't be missed.
1147;This film is dificult to describe and do it justice.
1148;I found myself surprised to find it a refreshing story of love and comitment.
1149;Among the see of poor, sappy, shortsighted love stories this is an original, well paced impecibly directed, acted, etc. film that demonstrates the main characters devotion to the man she loves.
1150;A must have for anyone who loves good cinema, foreign films, love stories, suspense, or just a plain good flick.
1151;filled with fast paced camera work blended together with the racing of Franka Potente's movement.
1152;a must see for anyone.
1153;one of the best movies of 1999
1154;Run Lola Run has achieved a sort of cult status since its arrival from Germany, and in its style alone, it's easy to see why: this is one fast.
1155;speed story, with a likeable, punk heroine (Franka Potente), very cool animation, and a good soundtrack.
1156;On all of those levels, Run Lola Run works well.
1157;Run Lola Run definitely wins on its style points, but on those points alone.
1158;This is a little gem of a movie which tells its tale with economy and verve.
1159;The other reviews give you a plot breakdown, but I will mention a few things I really like.
1160;titled version, and it works great.
1161;I do have a thing for most things German, so I like hearing the language.
1162;Also a fine soundtrack in this film!
1163;It really adds to the experience imho.
1164;"Plus I enjoyed the little ""snapshot"" stills that Twyker throws in along the way."
1165;Just go along for the ride and enjoy the sights and sound.
1166;In my opinion this is a real good way to spend an hour and a half.
1167;Run Lola run is a foreign film (German with English subtitles) that has much mainstream appeal.
1168;In another running she merely brushes past the woman and the woman ends up winning the lottery and lives happily ever after.
1169;Love the id a of the movie.
1170;I'ts good that the director has done the music to.
1171;if you have DTS this is a must.
1172;every body that hates the perfect symphonies of Hollywood this is a must.
1173;If you don't think this movie was deep I think you may have to take a closer look.
1174;On top of that this film is truly cinematic (unlike most made these days) and has a driving techno soundtrack.
1175;Both cast and script were perfect.
1176;The movie kept you on the edge of your seat, not knowing what to expect.
1177;I wanted to see what that was all about and I did.
1178;Like Tarantino, Run lola run, breaks all the rules of filmmaking and delivers an amazing narrative.
1179;a film that must be on anybody's lists of movies to see.
1180;Mostly we see Lola traversing a German city, going from one building to another, across one scenic plaza after another, running at full speed.
1181;Its wonderful filmmaking but very poor story.
1182;Many people have referred to 'Lola's' d j vu narrative structure, and compared it with such films as Sliding Doors and Groundhog Day.
1183;She wills the spectacular (photo.
1184;"I enjoyed the cartoon
I:9914;1185;And it was so fun, and kinetic, and riveting.
I:9914;1186;In Short: One of the year's very best films .
I:9914;1187;Run Lola Run is a wildly stylish German thriller that takes the visual thrills that were presented in this year's Go and takes that kind of energy down to the essentials.
I:9914;1188;faster and faster, with an incredibly surreal and wonderful style cutting the pieces together.
I:9914;1189;When Lola bumps into someone, we see (via snapshots) what happened to that person after she bumped into them.
I:9914;1190;Potente makes a fantastic lead actress .
I:9914;1191;there is an urgency in every word, every emotion, that makes us want her to win in the end.
I:9914;1192;it's a rush of energy unlike anything in film in the past couple of years, and I think it's really one of the best films of 1999.
I:9914;1193;a fantastic looking anamorphic transfer letterboxed at 1.85:1 that has wonderfully clear images and displays excellent detail.
I:9914;1194;The movie has a fairly pale color palette, with the exception a flare of bright color that pops up, mainly of Lola's bright red hair, which looks vibrant and rich as she speeds throughout the city.
I:9914;1195;Although the movie flies by, the picture is sharp enough to appreciate the architecture of Berlin, even if only for a passing moment.
I:9914;1196;this is an incredibly clear and sharp looking image with no shimmering or other similar problems.
I:9914;1197;Aside from maybe one or two very tiny marks on the print, this is a beautiful looking transfer.
I:9914;1198;frame edition is also included on the flip side.
I:9914;1199;sOUND One of the main elements of the movie is the pounding techno soundtrack and it's also the main highlight of the sound mix, coming through wonderfully, sounding intense and dynamic, with good bass.
I:9914;1200;There's also some very good uses of the surrounds on occasion.
I:9914;1201;Both the German and English sound mixes are included and I found it kind of interesting to watch the English version and watch the subtitles to see what the original version is.
I:9914;1202;Again, the music is really the highlight and it really powers the movie along.
I:9914;1203;animated menus that are easy to navigate.
I:9914;1204;What I enjoyed most about listening to it was how much fun the two seemed to be having discussing the movie and how energetically they offered comments about the picture.
I:9914;1205;It's really quite an interesting commentary and as I finished up watching the movie itself for the first time I was particularly excited to hear the two talk about how they made a lot of the movie.
I:9914;1206;Although the commentary has a fairly relaxed feel, the two manage to discuss much of what I was looking for .
I:9914;1207;the director offers a lot of particularly fascinating notes, mainly amount how a lot of the film's visual effects and camera tricks were achieved.
I:9914;1208;He also talks about the importance of music in the picture and how the concepts for the film's music were brought to life.
I:9914;1209;She also points out, along with the director, a lot of the German actors who star in the picture and their history.
I:9914;1210;In fact, I found a lot of the tidbits that were pointed out about the various actors to be quite interesting.
I:9914;1211;again, I really liked this commentary.
I:9914;1212;The two are energetic and sound like they're having fun talking about the picture.
I:9914;1213;This is my first time seeing the movie and I really found it highly enjoyable .
I:9914;1214;final Thoughts A must see.
I:9914;1215;In my German class, one boy brought this movie in.
I:9914;1216;It is very well done, and interesting.
I:9914;1217;The extra reward is the viewer gets to see the ripple effects of how that difference in timing affects all the future life events of everyone who comes into contact with Lola for the briefest of moments or who already has a past connection to her.
I:9914;1218;Each time I picked up more engaging details and and it progressively increased my enjoyment even more.
I:9914;1219;For a lower budget film I thought it was very clever, extremely well executed and Franka P. gave an amazing performance .
I:9914;1220;I was amazed of how intense this film is.
I:9914;1221;The camera angles are great and the music just makes it more exciting.
I:9914;1222;All you need to know is that the movie packs a punch of feminine power and 3 endings that will make anyone happy.
I:9914;1223;All in all this movie is brilliant peice gives everyone a thrill with bright colors, a beautiful plot, and incredible music.
I:9914;1224;This movie explores the variations that affect our day.
I:9914;1225;But, when life is on the line, one small change can have a profound impact on the following decisions, events, and coincidents.
I:9914;1226;This movie may worth a watch, not much more.
I:9914;1227;I first saw this film in a film class in college and from that point on I knew I had to have it.
I:9914;1228;It probably isn't one of the best films out there, but it is worth the watch.
I:9914;1229;This film from German director Twyker is a real treat.
I:9914;1230;pounding techno soundtrack (with Franka Potente who plays Lola on vocals), stunning visuals and a fast story that you really get caught up in.
I:9914;1231;All of this makes for a very flashy movie that will completely draw you in.
I:9914;1232;Plus there's some extraordinary acting from the two main characters that makes you really care for their plight.
I:9914;1233;And film that can achieve that has to be recognised.
I:9914;1234;There are also some highly interesting scenes in between each story in which the young couple discuss love, the future and other such topics.
I:9914;1235;It's little wonder that this was so highly acclaimed, and is likely to become a cult classic in years to come.
I:9914;1236;lets get this straight this is a great movieI first went to see this film at a special screening at our universities cinema and i did have some doubts about it before hand.
I:9914;1237;wrenching, Lola is definitely one of the best films of 1999.
I:9914;1238;Creative, exciting and fresh, it has the viewer in tense expectation all throughout the 80 minutes.
I:9914;1239;In my humble opinion this is the best movie I have ever seen that was able to illustrate how each day our smallest deterances and decisions and those of others, can re.
I:9914;1240;I was completely surprised and impressed by this film.
I:9914;1241;It's very exciting and that excitement is complimented by a pounding techno beat.
I:9914;1242;I think anyone can enjoy this film because it's filled with so many things that make movies great: love, sex, suspense, pain, and triumph!
I:9914;1243;It's creative and fun, but a bit overrated by people.
I:9914;1244;It's powerful soundtrack, the brilliant photography, witty direction and above all, fine pieces of acting, combines together to deliver a masterpiece.
I:9914;1245;The director does a brilliant work of explaining how every action shapes the future in a cleverly crafted movie with a very apt soundtrack.
I:9914;1246;It never drags even for a moment, provides the viewer with food for thought, while at the same time produce a brilliant work of visualizaion and above all, a novel and absorbing unpredictable storyline.
I:9914;1247;Combining animation, snapshots, vibrant colored film, with video and black and white sequences, Tom Twyker tells an exciting action adventure love story, that marked a new era of German and world cinema.
I:9914;1248;The intensity, the colors, the music, all brought together in an avant.
I:9914;1249;garde style that combines classical storytelling techniques with MTV.
I:9914;1250;era edits, is unique and exhilarating.
I:9914;1251;It's like a music video and video game and fairy tale and art film, all rolled into one.
I:9914;1252;It's likeLast Year at Marienbadon speed, where the intellectual intrigue and excitement is matched by real and visceral thrills.
I:9914;1253;brow entertainment, poetry and sport, art and action.
I:9914;1254;In my mind, the film succeeds tremendously.
I:9914;1255;The acting throughout is strong, but Franka Potente channels Lola with a combination of fierce determination and vulnerability that is fascinating to watch.
I:9914;1256;the opening scene establishes the philosophical dimensions of the story, with a light touch.
I:9914;1257;Images of anonymous humanity, with emphasis on a seemingly random few individuals here and there, are accompanied by a narrator.
I:9914;1258;Human beings ask endless questions, and every answer provokes new questions.
I:9914;1259;Beyond that: it's all theory.
I:9914;1260;Twyker employs a unique approach to non.
I:9914;1261;I've seen it several, and get something new each viewing.
I:9914;1262;It's like the spiral that serves as a primary visual motif throughout the film, the circle that turns back upon itself with a difference each time.
I:9914;1263;I get that feeling every time I watch this film.
I:9914;1264;that every act is important and has its effect.
I:9914;1265;Hollywood movies on the other hand, will stick to one scenario, showing you how events would occur in one perspective.
I:9914;1266;Most Hollywood movies leave you with the typical happy ending, all questions answered.
I:9914;1267;The whole reason writers write is to force you to examine a theme.
I:9914;1268;The movie gathers a wide fan base because of its unique plot setup, its hefty and intricate use of symbolism, and its ability to leave the audience in a deep state of inquiry.
I:9914;1269;I recommend that anyone seventeen years and older go see this movie (the movie is rated """"R"""")."""
1270;If you want to get the most out of this movie watch it as many times as you can.
1271;Tykwer created a cinematic monster when he shot Run Lola Run.
1272;Tykwer had limitless possibilities with this media, and made full use of the surreal capabilities of his camera.
1273;The simple intense dialogue grounds this film in its setting and the thumping techno beats of the soundtrack keeps the viewers heart racing.
1274;This film is not only useful for modern German cultural studies, it is ideal for the German language classroom.
1275;Entertaining and heart wrenching, this film stands the test of time.
1276;This has to be one of the finest foreign action films I have ever seen.
1277;Kudos to the Germans on making this a fast paced, edge of your seat fantasy.
1278;Run Lola Run was a great illustration of how life is about decision making.
1279;The director Tom Tykwer did a great job at writing and directing this film.
1280;The title Run Lola Run is the perfect name for this incredible movie.
1281;This movie is very unique in its own ways.
1282;Franka is perfect as Lola, AND she sings the title track.
1283;Awesome movie with a great take on time travel and what ifs .
1284;Run Lola Run is a great movie by the director of Cloud Atlas
1285;But Lola is a movie that everyone should see.
1286;The film is essentially simple in plot and in message, yet it is nonetheless riviting and thought provoking.
1287;It is a pleasant change of pace from the run.
1288;Time is the real protaganist in the film and is always in the forefront.
1289;Then I'll start going to techno clubs and raves and develop an addiction to ecstasy.
1290;But the voice over actors were quite good.
1291;Just do yourself a favor.
1292;Timely delivery, good condition, great film.
1293;but it's fast paced, fun, and challenging.
1294;This is an amazing movie and the musical score is fantastic!
1295;The story is really captivating and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
1296;(But only in German with subtitles) A beautiful young woman (Potente) must save her boyfriend from thugs by coming up with 100,000 dollars.
1297;angle camera shots, animation and dazzling editing.
1298;"I borrowed this movie from my friend to kill some time at work and though he had explain the plot
I:9914;1299;Espeically how well the music is cordniated with the film.
I:9914;1300;The speical features include a great video"
1301;If you liked the books that you can choose the outcome like go to page 8 or 16 you'll love this movie.
1302;It's a great movie that enforces the law of nature that every action has a reaction and every step in life that we take affects the next.
1303;I really enjoyed this film.
1304;so you can actually watch the film instead of trying to watch and read at the same time.
1305;It's the kind of movie I like to show to friends.
1306;Great movie, short and fun to watch.
1307;this is definately one of the most original movies i've seen.
1308;what really shines in this movie is not the plot, but the way the plot is told.
1309;last but not least, it's visually stunning: camera moves are great, fastly cut on a techno track that adapts to the action, showing sadness or hope.
1310;to sum it up, this is kind of a music clip that evolved to a movie.
1311;Twyker is also fascinated with point of view, showing us (the audience) relationships between characters that don't even know each other.
1312;paced shot selection to create a technician's paradise.
1313;This is the film for you if you like an action flick as well as something that will stimulate your gray cells.
1314;This is an awsome german flick with an even better soundtrack.
1315;a real independent film favourite, the best way to describe it is this: Pulp Fiction meets Trainspotting meets Groundhog Day.
1316;You get the action of Pulp Fiction, the sound and feel of Trainspotting, and the daily reliving of Ground Hog Day.
1317;Great movie and a welcome change from the regular list of choices.
1318;Simple, and easy to watch, even for non.
1319;A nice look at the random nature of life, and how one event can change many others.
1320;Soundtrack is top notch as well.
1321;beat during most of the film kept my body moving in rythym with the beat.
1322;The subtle songs in the background by the star (Franka Potente) fit perfectly in the scenes in which they were inserted.
1323;Their insight into the challenges of filming on a tight budget and trying to get permission to film in varous parts of Berlin was entertaining.
1324;Best part number 2 was the music video by Franka.
1325;He did an amazing job of creating an unrelenting drive that doesn't let up until the final shot.
1326;The movie is full of stunning pans and great color contrasts.
1327;And I decided to give it a try.
1328;I hope Lola gives him the boot!
1329;"I hope she'll do something brilliant""."
1330;Can't we be brilliant and creative?No.
1331;daddy (by far the most fascinating character in this film) gives her the boot (hurray!)
1332;She helps him and (guess what?!?!?)
1333;so this can be a feature film) where the two lovers are talking.
1334;I really enjoyed this film.
1335;I received it for about $7 including shipping.
1336;Good acting, Great story, and wonderful direction.
1337;You'll enjoy the ride each time.
1338;The acting is flawless .
1339;every supporting actor strikes the perfect note.
1340;I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone that is human.
1341;"Completely absorbing and hypnotising
I:9914;1342;I think that the music kept this movie moving.
I:9914;1343;I see the picture as an accompaniment to the soundtrack.
I:9914;1344;Both will get you drunk, and how you get there is up to you .
I:9914;1345;It was a good movie, though not great, but there was a certain amount of formula to it .
I:9914;1346;This is all well and good, and it makes for a fun movie .
I:9914;1347;but nobody will ever confuse it with a really classic comedy like It Happened One Night.
I:9914;1348;It has a definite sense of humor about itself, and even seems to parody itself at certain points.
I:9914;1349;Franka Potente is amazing in the title role .
I:9914;1350;she's a very good actor, and handles the physically demanding role with ease.
I:9914;1351;the film itself, both in terms of script and direction, is highly imaginative .
I:9914;1352;intellectual, as one of the other reviewers suggested, to appreciate it.
I:9914;1353;There are lots of lovely touches throughout .
I:9914;1354;These are some of the movie's best moments, and they really add to the pulsing rhythms of the main story.
I:9914;1355;These moments make you laugh, but the laughter is of a decidedly nervous variety, because you sense that such tremendous passion will lead Lola to trouble (as if it hasn't already, considering what her unreasoning love for Manni has led her into!)
I:9914;1356;It does a lot of its work with a sly.
I:9914;1357;a. nod feel that is amusing (and as I said above, there are moments of self.
I:9914;1358;parody that are very good), but this playful tone at times almost upends the story's more serious aspects.
I:9914;1359;I wholeheartedly reccommend it to you, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
I:9914;1360;The pace (despite the cartoons) will keep you watching: it never lets up.
I:9914;1361;Luckily I caught this one on IFC today.
I:9914;1362;One fun ride from beginning to end, end, end.
I:9914;1363;Will it be a joyous or fatal decision?
I:9914;1364;Every moment is fleeting and life really is a roll on the roulette table, so enjoy it to the fullest.
I:9914;1365;Great filmmaking has nothing to do with big budgets.
I:9914;1366;It starts with the script.
I:9914;1367;we watch all films through the perspective of the narrator.
I:9914;1368;The narrator in this film never speaks, but you extra stuff is told from the eye of the camera that I liked.
I:9914;1369;Sure, it is nice to watch Lola running through out the movie but I had higher expectations.
I:9914;1370;Yea it has an interesting twist, but it gets real painful after a while.
I:9914;1371;If you love it, god bless.
I:9914;1372;This film was simply amazing.
I:9914;1373;The suspense is both surreal and totally real.
I:9914;1374;The techno soundtrack is a seemless part of the story.
I:9914;1375;Lola is both sexy and liberating.
I:9914;1376;A truely stunning german film.
I:9914;1377;I believe the movie does well because of the premise of the Movie.
I:9914;1378;Run Lola Run is the result of a great experiment in film.
I:9914;1379;Despite little characterization, scattered dialogue and a very basic plot, it fully succeeds in its intentions.
I:9914;1380;The pulsating techno soundtrack perfectly connects with the beautiful images of Lola running, trying to beat destiny.
I:9914;1381;There's just something about the urgency in her eyes and the gracefulness with which she runs that won't let you take your eyes away from her.
I:9914;1382;It's just a very small, short film (an 80 minute running time) that perfectly captures its subject.
I:9914;1383;This one is definitely recommended, even for those that normally may avoid foreign language films.
I:9914;1384;This is a great german movie.
I:9914;1385;What you don't know is that this flick is one of the best of the year.
I:9914;1386;The plot is very good, and moves so rapidly that it's sometimes blinding to keep up with the subtitles.
I:9914;1387;Most of all I think this flick will impress many because of the balance it attains in all things.
I:9914;1388;It's got a great soundtrack, good stars (Lola is pretty cute), and great plot to keep you hooked and it's visually stunning.
I:9914;1389;I hope to one day accomplish the feat that has been created through this movie, a high energy movie that can relate to anyone and jumps across many cultural barriers in the process.
I:9914;1390;This is the best foreign movie of the year, hands down.
I:9914;1391;Action packed, hilarious, and downright rockin !
I:9914;1392;Do yourself a favor and pick this one up as soon as possible !
I:9914;1393;I had gotten the idea that it would probably be of more interest to young adults but I can attest that us older folks can enjoy it too.
I:9914;1394;Run, Lola, Run is a movie that shows us a lot of stories within the stories and a lot of alternate scenarios.
I:9914;1395;I liked the variables and I thought that the movie was quite unique in that regard.
I:9914;1396;The movie shows us 3 possible scenarios.
I:9914;1397;Even Lola and her boyfriend didn't really move me, though they looked like a lovely couple.
I:9914;1398;Give this guy a Nobel Prize!
I:9914;1399;You go about your life doing things the way you see fit.
I:9914;1400;Besides being a strange but most interesting movie, the music is just great
I:9914;1401;Fast paced and intense Run Lola Run is exactly what you would expect of film with its title.
I:9914;1402;A great length and great soundtrack for techno lovers Run Lola Run is a must see.
I:9914;1403;When I started watching it, I was so into it!
I:9914;1404;I recommend this to just about anyone who likes unpredictable movies!
I:9914;1405;The photography, directing, acting and plot are attention.
I:9914;1406;It's a great watch on the treadmill and the score is a good jogging or skiing iPod addition.
I:9914;1407;If you like fast paced or off the wall movies, you'll thoroughly enjoy Lola.
I:9914;1408;Lola is a cool, the action is riveting, the music is great, the acting is wonderful and the filming is clever.
I:9914;1409;lass he finds the money, he's as good asfried.
I:9914;1410;barely!Not quite as good as Der Clown or StraightShooter, among german import films, but Potenteis worth a look despite that dumb tatoo on herbelly!
I:9914;1411;Lola is an amazing story of just how far we will go, and how hard we will try for those we love.
I:9914;1412;The film is constantly in motion, as Lola has 20 minutes to get 100,000 DM$ or her boyfriend Manny's life will be in jeopardy.
I:9914;1413;The 81 minute film covers these twenty minutes, and does so in a very interesting way.
I:9914;1414;I became so immersed in the film, that I began to forget the characters were speaking in German.
I:9914;1415;There is also an English dub available, but the German sountrack is superior.
I:9914;1416;Definitely worth the price of admission.
I:9914;1417;For people who do not speak German, this film will still provide action and entertainment.
I:9914;1418;Take one plot multiply three possible outcomes, and you have the wonderful innovative Run Lola Run.
I:9914;1419;Each version of the plot will have you on the edge of your seat as Lola runs through the city to save her criminal boyfriend.
I:9914;1420;god jazzed watching this movie.
I:9914;1421;And yet, while the film is """"artful,"""" I thought it was a perfect blending of a filmmaking style with a story."""
1422;but the best part of all is Franke Potente, the star of the film.
1423;and she was the best cast part of the film.
1424;she seemed real, smart, sexy, foreign and fully.
1425;In RUN LOLA RUN, she shows why an American director casting a big.
1426;Red/pink hair sailing wildly behind.
1427;Her face is a masterpiece.
1428;She's very young, and in over her head.
1429;It's a riveting performance in a film full of fun ideas.
1430;But Lola's ferocity is an undeniable magnet.
1431;"it's rated ""R,"" mostly for some strong language, and for some unsavory scenes with the father and mistress."
1432;but I suggested it to my 17 year old son, and he loved it.
1433;He's showing it to his friends.
1434;Francois Truffaut, the great Frech director once said, I demand that a film express either the joy of making cinema or the agony of making cinema.
1435;It is judged on how it is about what it is about.
1436;Each new version of the story makes us think about the past actions of its characters while, at the same time, revealing something new about them.
1437;special, of course, is its style.
1438;In a way, this is the perfect movie to end the century.
1439;Furthermore, the director uses music the same way Scorsese, Tarantino, and Kenneth Anger do.
1440;is by a filmaker who is in love with filmaking.
1441;Tom Tykwer's direction and writing turned out a fantastic film that is pure action.
1442;This is a foreign film but its concept and style are close to home.
1443;Using the universal appeal of driving beats, as well as techno tunes and fast action photography this film is one that immediately grabs hold of teens and young adults and older people too!
1444;Franka Potente is powerful in this film.
1445;She is aesthetically pleasing (as always) and really makes the film enjoyable to watch.
1446;stylistically this movie is shot a lot like a music video and is more emotionally stimulating than is an intellectual one.
1447;its adrenalizing driving feel is refreshing especially considering it is a foreign film.
1448;So often foreign films are intellectual or just quaint.
1449;But overall, the heavy use of high energy volume fast action shots, aggressive dialogue against a relatively austere urban German backdrop that accentuates the action makes this such a fun film to watch.
1450;beware when watching this movie you will probably want to do some cardio and this makes a great one to watch while on the treadmill if you have such a set up.
1451;This movie is pumped with energy and is a great point of entry into foreign film.
1452;It is one that is highly accessible very stimulating and good for a wide audience.
1453;I highly recommend you see this one: Its style pushed the envelope of what a film can be and is truly a masterpiece.
1454;the story is propelled by a brilliant pulse.
1455;dance soundtrack produced in part by the director.
1456;The movie, as a whole, works, hurling the audience towards the mutable, uncertain conclusion.
1457;Fortunately, the art shines through this detracting artifact and the film still rates a five.
1458;This is my favorite all.
1459;It is enjoyable on many levels.
1460;I also enjoy the many Lola Rennt message boards on the net.
1461;Great,Great,Great from beginning to end.
1462;Very clever, fast paced razzle.
1463;"Tom Tykwer's ""Run Lola Run"" is an extremely exciting, entertaining film to watch."
1464;I first saw the film 7 years ago, and it's now a lot of fun to re.
1465;watch it and see how much of the German I can understand.
1466;This film stands out not only as a great foreign film, but as an excellent action/adventure film as well.
1467;Besides the brilliant and highly athletic performance from Franka Potente, who has since gone one to make many well.
1468;"known films in the U. s., ""Run Lola Run"" also boasts excellent editing, a great visual style and of course, a really catchy German techno soundtrack."
1469;Every brief part has an important element in the film's plot.
1470;Yet the resolution that she arrives at is itself quite a twist.
1471;The music is fantastic and captures the essence of intrigue.
1472;And the plot leaves you thinking those deep thoughts for some time.
1473;And I don't even like foreign films!
1474;What a wonderful contemporary film.
1475;I can honestly say that this film was entertaining and exciting for both the film.
1476;The film itself is wonderfully designed in both the story and the way the film was shot as well.
1477;"ray is breathtaking
I:9914;1478;the plot was an interesting look on the decisions that people make every day and how those impact others that they encounter.
I:9914;1479;film DesignThe cinematography and montage design of the film was excellent.
I:9914;1480;The shots were beautifully designed, taking some long shots with amazing colors that pop right off of the screen on the Blu.
I:9914;1481;ray is functional and themed appropiately with the film.
I:9914;1482;Also good to note that the Blu.
I:9914;1483;ray has a great commentary with Franka and the director.
I:9914;1484;Her hair is bright red, she's loud, and is imbued with superhuman powers.
I:9914;1485;out for thirty minutes, she also is able to make it accross Berlin in this amount of time, and appears briefly as a cartoon character.
I:9914;1486;Mani comments upon her appearance, leaving Lola once again in the role of the surveyed.
I:9914;1487;The film closes with this thought and is emphasized by the shot of Mani and Lola interlocking hands.
I:9914;1488;Creating life and movement outside the box in a way that someone else can easily interpret and appreciate is masterful.
I:9914;1489;Visually, the film could not be better, capturing both action and intense emotional moments with unmatched creativity.
I:9914;1490;Along with expert camera work, editing and superb acting, this film becomes a roller coaster ride for the senses.
I:9914;1491;A work of art, it deserves more than 5 stars.
I:9914;1492;It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it was still a breath of fresh air compared to what Hollywood churns out.
I:9914;1493;This movie is very fast.
I:9914;1494;The acting and plot is pretty good along with the music.
I:9914;1495;I just watched this movie for a History of Cinema class, and I must say that it is one of the best movies that I have ever seen in my life.
I:9914;1496;Don't let the fact that it is a German movie throw you off"
1497;"run Lola Run is an great example of the New Wave style of movie making
I:9914;1498;The slightest, smallest thing can change the path of our lives completely"
1499;Any fan of action films must watch this movie!
1500;I must also say the the amazing techno music accompanies the action supurbly.
1501;Everything is edited around the music, and the results are awesome.
1502;She was amazing in those movies, but she is at her best here.
1503;She perfectly mixes action and drama, and is often very humerous as well.
1504;She helps to make this movie the great cinematic masterpiece that it is.
1505;It is a terrific film, and you will be rivited from beginning to end.
1506;it is possible to zone out with the European techno soundtrack, but it is also a film which (if you actually pay attention to it) allows you to explore the subtle clues hidden throughout, which reveal the film's weighty, philosophical themes.
1507;I highly recommend you see this film.
1508;run lola run or lola rennt in german was a great movie about time and how much difference 1 second can make and oh how true it is for anyone who has expierenced fate in there life.
1509;it has a great soundtrack of both mixing of german techno and other forms to the american what a difference a day makes the movie flows well and there is no slow down time it is a great movie.
1510;the acting is good and make sure you get it in the german form with subtitles movies are not meant to be translated into other languages are dubbed it ruins movies.
1511;with the changing of scene to scene to scene you are surprised how great this movie mushes together and how much they really connect each time she runs is a whole new story which this movie pioneered all in all a perfect film great directing acting and sound there is nothing wrong with this movie.
1512;It's a surreal film in a lot of ways.
1513;But I digress!Hitchcock has always said that rather than having a bunch of talking heads in a film, that one should use the cinema as a way of communicating (or words to that effect) and Lola definitely delivers.
1514;first, Lola actually has a power or two.
1515;There is some animation in here too as well as some cool electronic music to keep us moving.
1516;Makes a bike thief become a bum.
1517;in the third one, when all parties are more or less behaving themselves and are doing good for others, things turn out the best.
1518;I chose the English and it went quite smoothly.
1519;Understandable why this film won the Audience Award at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival.
1520;It was real fast paced, the actress was sexy and interesting to look at, the camera angles were cool, the director employed just a hint of animation, the production was artsy yet gutsy, there were cool plot twists and manipulations and the story was good.
1521;Most of all, with all of this innovative filmmaking, the ending was satisfying.
1522;i give this a big thumbs up!
1523;As it turns out, this is an outstanding film!
1524;I think that the style of music definitely contributed to the fast paced nature of the film, but I thought more could have been done in terms of changing the music up here and there to give a more climactic effect at certain points.
1525;man and dude wheres my car, and actually provide the world with intellectually and visually stimulating entertainment.
1526;paced film with a philosophical message.
1527;This is all done at a breathless pace filled with dark humor.
1528;"After watching Lola Rennt for the fifth time, its safe to say that this is an excellently written
I:9914;1529;All of these aspects of the movie come together, fit perfectly, work perfectly together to make a excellent movie.
I:9914;1530;the story itself, simple enough, is helped out by the use of symbolism thoughout the movie.
I:9914;1531;It really is something you must see for yourself.
I:9914;1532;This is a fun artsy movie.
I:9914;1533;My first experience of seeing a movie created in a non conventional way.
I:9914;1534;It has a beginning,middle, and end that is easy to follow but edited and shot in a non conventional way.
I:9914;1535;The director shoots the same scenes over and over showing the audience what a split second in timing ca make to the final outcome.
I:9914;1536;The film is upbeat (good music) and editing superb.
I:9914;1537;it's a great movie, every unique.
I:9914;1538;Run Lola Run is Groundhog Day done right.
I:9914;1539;This film is a modern.
I:9914;1540;powerful Lola meets has their fates changed by the encounter.
I:9914;1541;I think the tragicomic effects of Lola are absolutely hilarious!The movie is very fast.
I:9914;1542;frame photography, creating a perfect panacea for the tv generation.
I:9914;1543;And let's face it, most of us belong to that generation, even if we've traded in our tellies for the Internet.
I:9914;1544;Within 10 minutes, I was captivated and amazed at this film.
I:9914;1545;It works on so many levels.
I:9914;1546;It is totally European in its script, filming and overall look and feel.
I:9914;1547;this is a moralistic tale, yet it gets the message across that the split.
I:9914;1548;But the film has fun doing it.
I:9914;1549;This aspect only adds to its appeal as one of its many attributes is to give us a glimpse into the European mindset, at times familiar but still distinct enough to generate interest.
I:9914;1550;If she wasn't in great physical shape at the beginning of filming, she most assuredly was at its finish!
I:9914;1551;Moralistic and entertaining at the same time, it reminds us that we are ultimately in charge of our destinies.
I:9914;1552;the theme is doozy but interesting .
I:9914;1553;ironic, creative, and simply riveting .
I:9914;1554;driven kid who actually thinks MTV is a music television and Jewel a poet, then you'll surely dislike it.
I:9914;1555;The mere fact that this movie is considered to be thought provoking may be a testament to the reality that perhaps we are not thinking much.
I:9914;1556;Kurosawa's Acclaimed 'Rushmon' is the original inspiration for both.
I:9914;1557;Franka Potente gives a stunning performance.
I:9914;1558;It is the most fast paced movie I have ever seen, and a unique way of showing things.
I:9914;1559;The soundtrack is great, and the pace is one of the best ever.
I:9914;1560;film, it does not seem rushed, it seems like Lola did everything she could and you as well as her are satisfied.
I:9914;1561;Run Lola Run is a magnificent movie set in modern day Germany.
I:9914;1562;It is easily one of the best foreign films I have ever seen.
I:9914;1563;It is entertaining and thoughtful and constantly keeps you visually engaged.
I:9914;1564;As things change so do their fates, momentarily touched by her presence running by.
I:9914;1565;The film is a visual display of Tykwer's collaboration of camera, music, and story creating a display of cinematic emotion.
I:9914;1566;But surprisingly, at the end of the story, the female role is present and given to Lola as we see that Manni did not need her after all.
I:9914;1567;the pumping soundtrack drives the film along nicely, the two leads are both very good, and the film is quickly set.
I:9914;1568;the twists of fate, are amusing and quirky, and you cant help but finish the film with a grin on your face.
I:9914;1569;run Lola Run is imaginative, mesmerizing, and take.your.
I:9914;1570;The amazing visuals work perfectly with an outstanding soundtrack and a highly engaging storyline to create a truly exquisite film experience.
I:9914;1571;blowing originality with twists and turns that take your breath away, Tom Tykwer has written and directed a tornado of a film that will haunt you for a long time after you experience RUN LOLA RUN.
I:9914;1572;Truly original and completely inventive, RUN LOLA RUN is a classic!
I:9914;1573;Another of my favorite movies, Run Lola Run (or, Lola Rennt in German) has all the right stuff: amazing (and real) sets, a throbbing techno soundtrack, an extremely interwoven and complex story line, and the death of the title character within the first thirty minutes!
I:9914;1574;To me, this movie is fine example of quantum causality .
I:9914;1575;An instant classic, I would recommend it to anyone.
I:9914;1576;If you find enjoyment in watching something new, plot twists rarely seen before, see this movie.
I:9914;1577;But if your enjoyment in movies comes from emotion and passion, feeling the characters and experiencing the story with your mind AND your heart, this movie isn't for you.
I:9914;1578;It is quirky, but that appealed to me.
I:9914;1579;I found the diversions interesting.
I:9914;1580;I found it a new way to look at a film without feeling like it was an """"ART"""" film."""
1581;I thought Franka Potente and Tom Tykwer give great added information to the movie.
1582;A friend of mine watched this and HATED the fact that it went over the same story three times.
1583;"seat adventure
I:9914;1584;Its not the greatest storyline in the world and the characters in the movie have the amazing capacity to do the most stupid, impulsive things without thinking first, but I must say that I enjoyed the whole movie from start to end and watched it twice, first by myself then with my husband.
I:9914;1585;The soundtrack is the style of authentic German trance.
I:9914;1586;which pleased my husband a great deal because he's a German trance.
I:9914;1587;A unique, thrilling, true rollercoaster ride, Run Lola Run is one of the more striking films you'll ever see.
I:9914;1588;This movie is all about kinetic motion, and Franka Potente is perfectly cast as the heroine.
I:9914;1589;Not only does she have a strong personality, a strikingly pretty yet odd face, and a nice mane of shocking orange hair, but her powerful thighs and glutes, constantly pumping and propelling her through the streets towards her.
I:9914;1590;The Polaroid flashbacks of random people on the street are also very memorable.
I:9914;1591;This movie by Tom Twyker (Cloud Atlas) was truly amazing.
I:9914;1592;It's fast paced, well shot, interesting storyline, and good acting.
I:9914;1593;There are also an interesting subplot for those wanting more depth than just an action drama.
I:9914;1594;A very creative, smart, hip, and stylish film.
I:9914;1595;The soundtrack is excellent (if you like techno).
I:9914;1596;paul Sartre preferred the movie above all other art forms because of this medium's ability to express temporal movement.
I:9914;1597;accessible, knowable universe is up for grabs"
1598;With minimal dialogue, this is a philosophically astute piece of work.
1599;The movie met my only workable definition of good art : I left the experience wanting to carry on with the artists' creation.
1600;one of the best movies I've seen.
1601;This is a stunning film.
1602;the film style matches the frenetic intensity of the impending deadline.
1603;The music and cinematic style create an energy such that the viewer doesn't simply view but experiences the heart pounding exhaustion of the race against time.
1604;it is a film that lays before you the immensity of opportunity that exists in every one of our moments, if only we are alive to see them.
1605;i found the name of this film scribbled on the back of a piece of paper deep in a jacket pocket.
1606;Tom Tykwer`s Run Lola Run is a breath of fresh air.
1607;There is so much creativity and vision in this small film that it stands alone against the overblown star vehicles the major studios keep forcing upon us.
1608;It is a film brimming with energy and inspiration and a powerful salvo against Hollywood conventionalism.
1609;It is a metaphysical examination of how the choices we make will affect us forever and how the actions of others can profoundly influence the circumstances of our lives.
1610;Yet, on a more simplistic level, it is also an energetic display of filmmaking at its most creative.
1611;With a pulsating soundtrack and a bravura performance by Potente to complement his boundless creativity, Tykwer succeeds in creating a truly original work.
1612;so you see her running to her bf and all the people/events that happen to her in the 15 minutes she has to get to her bf to stop him.
1613;the first time you watch this movie it is interesting and keeps your attention.
1614;anyway it has some good techno music if you have never heard of the soundtrack before.
1615;I had never seen it but heard about, bought it anyway and watched it and loved it!
1616;A well done ground hog day type movie.
1617;A very well done movie, that keeps up the interest all the way through.
1618;Good movie, a heart pumping punky kinda movie, with fun techno music to thread it all together, and fantastic acting!This is a movie for independent film lovers, for sure.
1619;watch that version if you want a good laugh.
1620;With all the hungry, talented musicians in the world, I would think this film maker could have found one that could provide decent music.
1621;The theme of this movie is primarily philosophical.
1622;One miniscule change will gernerally lead to huge differences.
1623;I found the music very good and the vocals complemented it nicely.
1624;The important thing is how well it works with the visual imagery and I found it did that very well.
1625;the final theme is the plot, which keeps you interested.
1626;I recommend this movie to people who like unique, thought provoking, fun filled movies.
1627;This is an awesome movie.
1628;Franka Potente is quite hot and such a good actress.
1629;Her story in this film is so powerful and believeable.
1630;The soundtrack is also amazing and should be checked out as well.
1631;One of my favorite movies ever.
1632;hollywood movie, short and concentrated.
1633;Visuallu brilliant,excellent story perfectly cast nuff said.
1634;What can't one say about this it is truly brilliant.
1635;visually stunning the dialogue was witty yet still thought provocking and the movie was paced perfectly.
1636;i recomend this to all ages
1637;I saw this movie on a listmania list and noted the high ratings, so I bought it and I'm glad I did.
1638;Its unique format mixes media styles and throws in a few quirky twists just for kicks.
1639;Certainly got my money's worth
1640;Best action movie i've ever seen!
1641;Both are original and thrilling.
1642;See it immediately because time is running out (you'll know why after you see it)!
1643;The mythic and archetypal meanings hit you right in the face: POW!
1644;It is a living legominism of higher art, embodying the three octaves of the enneagram in a way that REALLY makes you see how one .
1645;can actually CHANGE THE FUTURE!
1646;The scenes where Lola and her boyfriend are relaxing in bed, intimately discussing their relationship, are very moving.
1647;The viewer instanly realizes just how much these two people truly love and care for one another.
1648;I was moved in a big way.
1649;This one is a true classic!
1650;Very inventive movie and reminds me of Kieslowski, without the Catholic baggage, in that we see how randmom life isand how small encounters and slight changes in timing can significantly alter one's life and others (without our even being aware of it).
1651;this is an interesting ( but not new ) idea to think about, yet it is cleverly presented in an aesthetically pleasing manner in this film.
1652;This movie has all the elements of a classic cult film.
1653;A must see for all independent film lovers.
1654;This movie was my best of the year.
1655;The plot is not very deep but the idea is interesting.
1656;This film is full of energy and never stops for a minute.
1657;the basis of the plot is fairly simple.
1658;as Lola desperately searches for ways to raise the cash there is a grinding techno beat soundtrack which pulsates with energy.
1659;Lola herself is played by an actress with total charisma and screen prescence.
1660;The film also uses animated sequences and still photography and is quite inovative in style.
1661;One of the more interesting and dynamic films in years.
1662;This is a classic that never gets old.
1663;The 3 alternate scenarios make the story interesting and shows how life can turn on a dime.
1664;I'm going to keep this short and sweet: Run Lola, Run is one of the best movies I've ever seen!
1665;No other movie combines plot, perfect casting, action, soundtrack, and high energy with such perfection.
1666;The immediacy of the threat faced by Lola and Mannie keeps you engrossed by their every move.
1667;The way I see it there is absolutely no reason for anybody not to see this movie.
1668;Some have remarked on the originality of the film's concept.
1669;What makes it novel, perhaps, is that it's applied to a non.
1670;From the opening sequence, we are completely at the mercy of Twyker's powerful vision.
1671;Tykwer has crafted a genuine story here, with a great moral center.
1672;Tykwer, instead, uses so many techniques, so well.
1673;edited together, that the characters are largely defined visually before you even know what's happening.
1674;It's extremely intriguing to hear scenes relived from both sides of the camera.
1675;More interestingly, though, Tykwer's explanation of how he pulled off his vision is something that will energize even the most casual filmmaker.
1676;This is the greatest film out of Germany.
1677;This film is already making it's way to the top of my favorite films ever list.
1678;Kudos to Tom Twyker, he has done it again.
1679;i promise you, you have never seen a better piece of German Cinema ever!
1680;Best movie of the year!
1681;The star, Franka Potente, who also played the girlfriend in The Bourne Identity, is amazing.
1682;the comic relief in the 'cartoon' segments makes this movie lots of fun to watch as well.
1683;"This movie is stunning and is a 'must see' for all thinking movie buffs as well as people who enjoy pondering the wonders of ""what if?"""
1684;Every now and then, a great foreign film makes its way across the pond.
1685;Run Lola Run is a masterpiece.
1686;Combine the look of Madonna's Ray of Light music video, and the inter.
1687;The soundtrack fits the film like a glove, doing for Lola what say, a John Williams soundtrack does for a Spielberg film.
1688;paced gimmick, has turned to be a signature work of the unique new voice in the thriller genre.
1689;Tom Twyker continues to make great suspense flicks.
1690;I dare say he's developed into a great stylist in fullest command of his craft.
1691;A Hitchcock in the making for our generation.
1692;Run Lola Run is a fun, intense flick.
1693;He checks at the next station, but it's gone!
1694;The first person she thinks of, for help, is her father, a bank manager.
1695;But will he help?Manni's life is on the line.
1696;His boss is a dangerous man, who once headbutted Manni, for simply keeping a carton of cigarettes!Run Lola Run is full of unexpected twists.
1697;it's fun movie, i got goosebumps the first time I saw it.
1698;Moritz Bleibtreu, is wonderful as Manni, who is QUITE believable in his portrayal as a desperate man.
1699;And Franka Potenteis FANTASTIC, she seems very likable personally.
1700;And as Lola, with her punk hairdo, dyed a brilliant fire.
1701;Her attitude, and her energy!
1702;it has some deeper meaning.
1703;It's about true love, destiny and determination.
1704;with it's unique directional techniques and adventuresome plot, it's truly unique and very exhilerating!
1705;is scored with some excellent techno music (partly composed by Tom Tykwer!)
1706;And Franka lends her voice to a couple songs!
1707;The beats will get your adrenaline pumping, you'll want to get up and run with Lola.
1708;The video features scenes from the film, some NEW scenes of Lola running and also shows some fun sequences of Franka singing!
1709;written and directed by TOM TYKWER!
1710;great for even the people that gripe about reading subtitles.
1711;Very good pick for a movie night with discussion.
1712;Lola, with her flaming, bright red hair and tender, spunky, and clever wit, makes this film one of the most unforgettable and exciting foreign films that I've ever seen.
1713;For such a simple plot, the film is pure creativity and originality to its fullest.
1714;enacted in a clever, spontaneous, and yes, even believable way.
1715;That's what makes this film so fun and entertaining.
1716;She has a heart and plenty of spunk that makes her a character worth watching, not just a pretty face to look at.
1717;I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to watch a fun and entertaining movie that has a bit of a twist, a sense of a humor, and some touchy moments.
1718;And I loved the music as well (the soundtrack is also a keeper!)
1719;The music played an essential role to the story.
1720;I can go on and on about it, but just watch it and see for yourselves.
1721;And I strongly recommend the subtitled version.
1722;Subtitled version of the movie gives you better , much better understanding of it .
1723;this film starts from very begining with particular speed already in it , as soon , as you peak it up .
1724;A bag with 100.000 marks gone .
1725;And she has to start it again.
1726;untill she get it right .
1727;( I wish , the real life will give us as many chances .
1728;cinematography on highest level !
1729;Speed of the movie keeps you on adrenalin level of reality .
1730;I found myself on the feet few time .
1731;I fell completely in love with this brilliant artistic film from the first moment that I laid eyes on it.
1732;It is a film rich with color, sound, creativity, and non.
1733;The cool thing about this movie is that we not only see what happens as Lola scrambles to get the money, but we see it happen three times.
1734;Each time Lola's 20 minutes are up, we start fresh with a few things learned and try all over again.
1735;What is admirable about Lola is her strong determination to succeed and conquer the obstacles.
1736;She fights for what she believes, for what she trusts, and for what she loves.
1737;stealer and being a lottery winner.
1738;The plot may have been simple but the acting was solid, charismatic and charming.
1739;"The film is so captivating in every aspect
I:9914;1740;To keep it simple, Run Lola Run is a roller coaster ride of a movie with adrenaline pumping speed .
I:9914;1741;But the main parts of the story was good.
I:9914;1742;well, great idea for a script.
I:9914;1743;paced movie with intelligent social commentary.
I:9914;1744;Not only is this movie an adrenaline rush, but it's also a visual delight.
I:9914;1745;the actors are clearly talented, particularly the two leads.
I:9914;1746;Somehow, Potente and Bleibtreu make is incredibly easy to see why Lola would risk so much for her boyfriend.
I:9914;1747;From the opening credits where a swinging pendulum sets the pace, we hear a clock ticking, the beat of the music starts, and this movie never stops with its frenetic and frantic pace.
I:9914;1748;Then your heart is still racing from the experience and you want to see it again.
I:9914;1749;The story hit's you repeatedly and builds without repetition.
I:9914;1750;She's also hip and fit with red hair flying in the wind, a tight blue top revels a white bra underneath and her tight green pants flair at the bottom over black boots, definitely not running shoes.
I:9914;1751;It's so original that I would recommend it to literally anybody who is willing to suspend his or her belief in a liner world.
I:9914;1752;If you liked the Matrix you love this movie.
I:9914;1753;The soundtrack is just as good too!
I:9914;1754;One of the most absorbingly exciting Films I have seen in a long time.
I:9914;1755;This movie is a completely original and well structured piece of work.
I:9914;1756;The movie then shows us three alternate and equally entertaining results to the situation.
I:9914;1757;one of the more interesting innovation was the fact that the movie shows us how the lives of seemingly insignificant characters are affected by their run.
I:9914;1758;the movie had style to spare and enough substance so that's why I liked it very much.
I:9914;1759;This is one of my favorite movies, and if you haven't seen it yet, do so.
I:9914;1760;It's a highly energized, inventive movie about fate, love, and coincidence (a theme so many directors have embraced recently).
