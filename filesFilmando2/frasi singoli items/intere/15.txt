I:8615;1;Not only is this a thoroughly brilliant motion picture with many famous sequences, but it's perhaps the least disturbing and most entertaining of Hitchcock's films.
I:8615;2;kilter coolness, and one scene after another demonstrates the powers of the master artist Hitchcock in complete command of his medium.
I:8615;3;The Ernest Lehman script is outstanding.
I:8615;4;Even the Saul Bass title sequence is iconic, to employ a now.
I:8615;5;The pic hurtles into motion with amazing swiftness, through a Byzantine sequence of events which sweep Grant into a world of narrative he does not comprehend, directed by a group of mysterious government agents who contemplate his fate like Olympian gods.
I:8615;6;for the viewer who wants an introduction to what makes Hitchcock tick, and yet what makes the cinema a collaborative medium.
I:8615;7;And although the plot is complex, it's so much so that it approaches the comically inscrutable, and the minimal doses of violence and Hitchcockian neuroses make this, as the phrase goes, fine family viewing.
I:8615;8;North by Northwest (1959) is one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest films, and I think it's his most sophisticated, sharp, classy thriller.
I:8615;9;It's actually very light and comedic, not dark and serious, which makes it very entertaining.
I:8615;10;"It's considered the fourth most thrilling film of all time on AFI's ""100 Years.100 Movies"" list, and it very much deserves it."
I:8615;11;James Mason perfectly plays the villain, Philip Vandamm.
I:8615;12;this has to be Hitch's most entertaining film with top.
I:8615;13;It also has a fast pace, great Hitchcockian humor, an amazing plot, wonderful sets, and witty dialouge.
I:8615;14;the special features here are absolutely incredible.
I:8615;15;The Disc 2 is special features galore.
I:8615;16;"It comes with a 1 1/2 hour documentary ""Cary Grant: A Class Apart"", which chronicles Cary Grant's life and legendary film career, all the way to his death."
I:8615;17;"The other 2 special features are about the making of the film: ""North by Northwest: One for the Ages"" and ""Destination Hitchcock: The Making of North by Northwest."
I:8615;18;The rest are production photos and theatrical trailers, which are pretty fun to see.
I:8615;19;North by Northwest is no doubt one of Hitch's best films, and some even consider it his best.
I:8615;20;It definitely is one of my favorites.
I:8615;21;It has everything that a Hitchcock film should have: suspense, humor, sharp acting/actors, witty dialouge, and a classic MacGuffin.
I:8615;22;If you haven't seen this, you have to see it NOW!
I:8615;23;This movie is considered a classic, and I can see why.
I:8615;24;It has a few twists and turns and keeps you entertained.
I:8615;25;The characters are interesting and I overall enjoyed it.
I:8615;26;I was skeptical at first as I haven't watched many classics but was soon sucked into the plot and was highly entertained!
I:8615;27;Now this is the classic thriller and I think that because of this adventure they started the James Bond series.
I:8615;28;I hope you have a large enough screen to enjoy this.
I:8615;29;Especially the incredible scenes with Grant running away from a diving airplane.
I:8615;30;The bottom line is, if you like the movie youwill be vey happy with the Blu Ray.
I:8615;31;sharpness could be a little better but still good.
I:8615;32;Add this one to your collection.
I:8615;33;I have seen this move so many times and am in love with it more and more each time!
I:8615;34;The movie is visually stunning and simply a great rainy day afternoon classic!
I:8615;35;I got this as a gift for my boyfriend.
I:8615;36;He likes it so that makes me happy!three more words
I:8615;37;This provides an entertaining interlude until Roger stops for the police and is arrested by Sgt. Emil Klinger.
I:8615;38;The film shows travel on the famous New York Central railroad to Chicago, a bit of history long gone.
I:8615;39;Roger meets a woman, Eve Kendall, who helps and befriends him.
I:8615;40;There is something mysterious about Eve.
I:8615;41;Note how Hitchcock was able to create suspense and tension from ordinary life.
I:8615;42;There is yet another meeting with Van Dam, Leonard, and Eve.
I:8615;43;"Eve shoots Roger, who is carried away by the ""Professor""."
I:8615;44;And so the film has a happy ending, if forced.
I:8615;45;Cary Grant is great as the non.
I:8615;46;watch it and you will see what I mean.
I:8615;47;Surprisingly I enjoyed this film immensly!
I:8615;48;I ordered this movie along with a couple other classic movies all from Amazon.
I:8615;49;All movies were great and in perfect condition.
I:8615;50;(Carey Grant)This movie has it all.
I:8615;51;A great (original) script by Ernest Lehman.
I:8615;52;Martin Landau and even more chilling villain and in his strongest performance in a supporting role.
I:8615;53;Carey Grant, always debonair, the very picture of suave, in the best role he ever had.
I:8615;54;And the best filmmaker ever: Alfred Hitchcock.
I:8615;55;A chase in a cornfield by a bi.
I:8615;56;plane, which is one of the most famous chase scenes.
I:8615;57;The Hitchcock film to end all Hitchcock films.
I:8615;58;You do get some colorful stories about Hitch and the making of this movie, and at one point Lehman goes into detail about the writing of the script.
I:8615;59;Its not the best commentary Ive seen, but worthwhile.
I:8615;60;But if you want to see just how effective Hermanns score is, there is no better way to do it.
I:8615;61;north By Northwest is one of my favorite movies and one of the best movies ever made.
I:8615;62;Being able to watch timeless classics makes Amazon Prime worth every penny.
I:8615;63;Every element in North is done to perfection Hitchcock is at his most self indulgent and that is a good thing in this case.
I:8615;64;The film begins with a hilarious situation playing on Grant's under comedic timing and never stops or slows down.
I:8615;65;The injokes are plenty between Mason and Landau's characters less than subtle sexual interest in each other.
I:8615;66;suspense,comedy relief and unexpected things happening from real one to the end.
I:8615;67;i still remember the thrill of watching it for the very first time at the CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY's repertory theater.
I:8615;68;hITCHCOCK's direction,LEHMAN's script and HERRMANN's music blend perfectly.
I:8615;69;"among my favorite scenes:MASON slapping LANDAU because he missed his assignment
I:8615;70;It has suspense, drama, comedy through out this marvelous Hitchcock Classic.
I:8615;71;after seeing it for sale on Amazon for [price], and with all those extras such as: a commentary, theatrical trailers, a documentary, a photo gallery, an audio track showcasing the score and a tv spot, i immediately ordered it.
I:8615;72;the visuals were magnificent and astounding.
I:8615;73;leave it to Alfred Hitchcock to come up with such a brilliant bit of motion.
I:8615;74;Eva Marie Saint plays his love interest Eve Kendall, and yes, the final train.
I:8615;75;By the way, the tailored gray, ventless, three.
I:8615;76;"The mag gushed that the suit was ""arguably the most legendary in the history of American cinema."
I:8615;77;"That final scene was actually filmed on a studio replica of Mt. Rushmore
I:8615;78;"Warner Home Video has done us all a welcome pleasure by meticulously restoring and remastering the flick, scanning the original VistaVision production elements in 8K resolution so, they promise, ""the resulting presentation reveals a depth of field and clarity never before possible, only serving to heighten every thrill."

I:8615;85;I also appreciated the fact that this was a movie that I could watch with my whole family.
I:8615;86;My boyfriend is really enjoying older movies now, thanks to CG's wit and wonderful acting!
I:8615;87;romantic thriller with just enough comedy to give room to take a breath.
I:8615;88;The finale is the ultimate cliffhanger.
I:8615;89;This is Hitchcock on all 8 cylinders.
I:8615;90;This is my favorite movie with Cary Grant in it.

I:8615;92;Great movie and a great price too!
I:8615;93;This is an all time favorite at our house and we don't get tired of watching it.
I:8615;94;Big fans of Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint as they do a great job with their parts.
I:8615;95;Pretty much enjoy anything Hitchcock.
I:8615;96;He knew what he was doing and he did it well.
I:8615;97;Every time I watch this movie, it always thrills me.
I:8615;98;Keeps you interested until the very end.
I:8615;99;It is,of course, a great movie that they cannot seem to make anymore.
I:8615;100;I enjoyed this old movie.
I:8615;101;Recommend for family as well.
I:8615;102;Lots of suspense plus romance.
I:8615;103;One of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movies.
I:8615;104;And the romance was believable.
I:8615;105;But the chemistry in North by Northwest was good between Grant and Eva Marie Saint.
I:8615;106;the story line was fun.
I:8615;107;This is one of Grant's better ones.
I:8615;108;And one of Hitchcock's better ones, too.
I:8615;109;The bad guys were excellent as well.
I:8615;110;Shared another Hitchcock classic with my son.
I:8615;111;He has really enjoyed the high suspense, humor, twisting plots, and flawless performances of Cary Grant and his fellow cast members.
I:8615;112;Such a stylish, fun, and suspenseful film.
I:8615;113;Great suspense throughout, wonderful dialogue, and a great murder mystery with a Cold War twist.
I:8615;114;This is one of my favorite Hitchcock films.
I:8615;115;That sequence alone is worth watching the movie for.
I:8615;116;Although released in 1958, this story of mistaken identity, romance and interesting plot twists deserves its reputation as a classic Hitchcock thriller and is still fun to see and enjoy.
I:8615;117;North by Northwest is a classic suspense film by Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense, with a great cast.
I:8615;118;North by Northwest is a fantastic movie.
I:8615;119;"And Cary Grant is so easy on the eyes 
I:8615;120;I would recommend this movie to everyone!!!
I:8615;121;The climactic scene on the face of Mt Rushmore takes on a campy feel.
I:8615;122;having said that, Cary Grant still provides the classy screen presence with the right touch of humor that makes him memorable.
I:8615;123;if you haven't seen it, it is a must see for Hitchcock fans.

I:8615;126;This is a good classic to watch.
I:8615;127;Great acting and great story line.
I:8615;128;I've seen this several times worth the watch
I:8615;129;This is another great, timeless, movie that Hitchcock so brilliantly put together.
I:8615;130;Considered by some, Hitchcock's greatest work, Cary Grant is brilliant in the film as a man stuck with a bad case of mistaken identity (Don't you hate it when that happens).
I:8615;131;Several scenes use wonderful camera angles and cuts to enhance the feeling of suspense.
I:8615;132;the movie also has some very memorable characters, such as Cary Grant's character, Thornhill, Eva St. Marie's Eva Kendall, and my favorite, the evil Leonard played by Martin Landau (He is so creepy in this).
I:8615;133;From opening to the ending scene, this movie will hold you all the way.
I:8615;134;So sit back and enjoy the ride.
I:8615;135;Every signature feature of his films is here.
I:8615;136;The Hitchcock cameo, the innocent man, the high angle shot, the beautiful, icy blonde, the bossy mom, etc.
I:8615;137;This is my favorite Hitchcock film ever.
I:8615;138;It has Great suspense, and is still is one of the greatest thrillers of all time.

I:8615;146;I understand that the colour in this film is meant to be vivid,Colour is important in other Hitchcock films such as, Marnie, which I think is far better than N by NW.
I:8615;147;In one scene Rodger (Grant) and Eve (Saint) are walking along the train platform and the love music is on, then the shot switches to the villians and the music doesn't change could this mean that there is something romantic going on between them?
I:8615;148;They definitely took their time restoring this.

I:8615;159;Absurd, absolutely and definitely riveting.
I:8615;160;fifty years after its initial release, 'North by Northwest' remains one of Hollywood's most stylish, slick, entertaining, and expertly crafted thrillers, but it's perhaps best known for two brilliantly executed suspense scenes.

I:8615;216;James Mason is amazing as the sinister Phillip Vandamm and Eva Marie Saint is stellar as Roger's love interest Eve.

I:8615;228;A Fabulous thriller with first rate actors!!
I:8615;229;I thoroughly enjoyed this fun and adventurous film.
I:8615;230;Watch it, you'll love it
I:8615;231;Cary Grant films are an absolute treasure and I have collected many of them.
I:8615;232;He is one of the best actors Hollywood ever had.
I:8615;233;I enjoy watching his films.
I:8615;234;"Cary Grant is his usual suave, drop dead gorgeous self, but is almost playing a parody of the ""Cary Grant"" type."
I:8615;235;The greatest part of North by Northwest, however, is the trademark Hitchcockian suspense.
I:8615;236;No matter how many times I have seen this film, it still brings me to the edge of my seat!
I:8615;237;NORTH BY NORTHWEST is by far my favorite Hitchcock thriller.
I:8615;238;It's a genuine nail biter throughout, with several excellent action sequences, a wonderful cast, superb story and a climax that remains 50 years later one of the greatest of all time!
I:8615;239;It is indeed an extremely enjoyable movie, and the rapid cutting at the end, leading to the erotic train going through the tunnel, is one of the most brilliant visual conceptions of all filmdom.
I:8615;240;Improbable end but a good piece of entertainment.
I:8615;241;With a strong cast, a sparkling script and possibly the greatest film sequence ivolving an airplane, this one is definitely a keeper.

I:8615;244;From nearly being killed by a cropduster to the sequence at the stitlt house those chilling final moments on Mount Rushmore, every moment keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:8615;245;The period betweeen 1958 and 1963 was perhaps the most productive time in Alfred Hitchcock's career.
I:8615;246;"In those five years, he made what are arguably his four greatest films: ""Vertigo"", ""North By Northwest"", ""Pyscho"" and ""The Birds""."
I:8615;247;It's hard tp pick which one of those films is THE best, but I think those are his four best films.
I:8615;248;To elude from harm, he enlists the help of beautiful counterspy Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).
I:8615;249;This leads to an unforgettable climax atop Mount Rushmore.
I:8615;250;Cary Grant's performance in this film may well be the best of his career.
I:8615;251;Hitchcock's work behind the camera is very creative.
I:8615;252;His directing for the crop duster scene is, shot for shot, perfect.
I:8615;253;The featurette is highly enjoyable, as the commentary by screenwriter Ernest Lehman, who recently passed on.
I:8615;254;Bear with me while I simply point out the following:This is an Alfred Hitchcock movie.
I:8615;255;Hitchcock is regarded by many as the best movie.
I:8615;256;Furthermore, NBNW is is not just any Hitchcock movie, it's generally considered one of his best.
I:8615;257;the story begins with a classic case of mistaken identity in which our hero (played by Cary Grant) gets caught up in a case of international espionage.
I:8615;258;The cast is excellent, several of the scenes are among the most memorable in cinematic history, the background scenery is often spectacular, and the music builds on the story's shifting moods extremely well.
I:8615;259;nBNW is a genuine Hollywood classic.
I:8615;260;category of the 100 greatest movie thrillers.
I:8615;261;alfred Hitchcock made a slew of great movies.
I:8615;262;One of Hitchcock's most famous works.
I:8615;263;I give it four stars not due to any faults of its own, it is a fine film.
I:8615;264;Alfred Hitchcock, Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, an irrisistable combo in my opinion.
I:8615;265;I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good murder mystery.
I:8615;266;Of all of the Hitchcock films I've seen, North by Northwest is the most enjoyable.
I:8615;267;Cary Grant is in top form and delivers some hilarious lines.
I:8615;268;The innocent man, the cross country chase, the crop duster, Mount Rushmore and the train going through the tunnel.
I:8615;269;Vertigo might be his best film, but North by Northwest is the most fun to watch again and again.
I:8615;270;I am young guy, and I could not ever imagine that a very old movie can be so interesting and touching.
I:8615;271;I love a good Alfred Hitchcock thriller.
I:8615;272;There is nothing like the master at the top of his game!
I:8615;273;Kind of fun to see a movie from this era .
I:8615;274;enjoy the film on 2 levels .
I:8615;275;a trip back in time combined with a great cast and plot.
I:8615;276;"He narrowly escapes death as a result, bringing to my mind the words of wise old King Solomon:""Do not lust in your heart after her beautyor let her captivate you with her eyes,for the prostitute reduces you to a loaf of bread,and the adulteress preys upon your very life."
I:8615;277;4 points for an otherwise exciting and well crafted film.
I:8615;278;Always know the ending but still thrills and entertains.
I:8615;279;Hitchcock was undoubtably the best director of Suspense movies
I:8615;280;Cary Grant certainly was sexy when he was young!
I:8615;281;Actually, as I recall he was also pretty sexy when he got old, too . . . this is one of Hitchcock's best films.
I:8615;282;And you will recognize a lot of other faces, too.
I:8615;283;Instead, he does one of the best chase down a mountain road scenes I have ever seen.
I:8615;284;It's the real owner of the house.
I:8615;285;There are some marvelously complex plot developments, culminating in one of the most intriguing scenes in movie history, where several people climb down (and fall from) the giant heads of Mount Rushmore.
I:8615;286;This is a real classic of the unexpected twist and twist again.
I:8615;287;Good movie made better by updated viewing abilities.
I:8615;288;He is still handsome and fun to watch.
I:8615;289;Nice taking a step back in time.
I:8615;290;Still good watching after all these years.
I:8615;291;First saw it as a teenager in 1959 or 1960 at Radio City Music Hall in N.Y. It's still great!
I:8615;292;This movie may make you a Cary Grant fan.
I:8615;293;Great suspense with a lot of humor.
I:8615;294;Even if you have seen it's nice to see it again.
I:8615;295;A classic movie that I can watch again and again.
I:8615;296;This is a gift to someone who was born in 1990 and missed some of these great movies growing up.
I:8615;297;This movie continues to entertain with suspense, humor and a clever plot.
I:8615;298;This is Hitchcock at his best and the Blu.
I:8615;299;ray makes this an eye.
I:8615;300;Cary Grant is as debonair as he is handsome, while James Mason is sinister to the max.
I:8615;301;This movie is just as good today as it was years ago.
I:8615;302;"Suspenseful, funny, sexy, exciting, it works perfectly on so many levels that the film just gets better and better with repeated viewings!The story is really quite simple
I:8615;303;Along the way, Grant is ridiculed by his mother (Jesse Royce Landis, who is hilarious, if actually YOUNGER than Grant!)
I:8615;304;, chased across a cornfield by a lethal cropduster (in one of the greatest scenes in film history!)
I:8615;305;, while Bernard Herrman's unforgettable music punctuates each scene!Yes, the film has it's faults and a few technical gaffes, but for sheer excitement and fun, you can't top 'North By Northwest'!
I:8615;306;Hitchcock and Grant both considered this to be one of their favorite films, and you'll fall in love with it, too!
I:8615;307;A classic Hitchcock film for those that like his style.
I:8615;308;Beautiful visuals as this story traveled the country.
I:8615;309;I hold this to be Alfred Hitchcock's finest film, but to say that rather shortchanges the British genius as it happens to be one of the greatest movies of all time.
I:8615;310;"North by Northwest is what I would call ""old school cool,"" and there has never been, before or since, a more charming or likeable actor than Cary Grant."
I:8615;311;This marks the third time I've seen it and I found it just as fulfilling as the two before it.
I:8615;312;james Mason was an amazing actor and I'd place him just below Olivier on the talent meter.
I:8615;313;It makes the movie just as much a romance as a thriller.
I:8615;314;The dialogue between Grant and Saint is absolutely precious, particularly when they meet on the train and speak in the dining car.
I:8615;315;"And my favorite:""Men like you don't believe in marriage."""
I:8615;316;"the entire movie is shot in the ""man alone"" motif as Grant, ala Gary Cooper, stands up to forces far superior than himself."
I:8615;317;This advertising executive is quite successful in outpacing East German (presumably) agents and the police who are out to hang him.
I:8615;318;This has become a classic Alfred Hitchcock film, with film score by Bernard Herrmann.
I:8615;319;The page boy is paging George Kaplan so Roger is mistaken for Kaplan (a shorter man with dandruff) and the fun begins.
I:8615;320;"Made just in between Hitchcock's best films
I:8615;321;'North By Northwest' is more lighthearted and fun than those films, less psychologically oriented and more glossy good old fashioned entertainment.
I:8615;322;Hitchcock took the 'innocent man on the run' dilemma he practically invented in 'The 39 Steps' and then further explored in 'Saboteur, but perfected in this classic film.
I:8615;323;In one of the definitive Cary Grant roles, Grant was in peak form and at his most charming.
I:8615;324;Endlessly entertaining and sprinkled with wit and intrigue, one of the classic screen entertainments.
I:8615;325;"This time Eva Marie Saint is the 'icy blonde' a look that obviously appealed to Hitchcock and a lot of actresses are living proof of that
I:8615;326;There is an incredibly sexy (and long) kissing sequence that could compare with the one Grand and Ingrid Bergman had in Hitch's 'Notorious', while not as tense or as unbearably sexy it's still as memorable.
I:8615;327;James Mason is excellent as the villainous Phillip Vandamme and this is one rare occasion when his voice does not seem distracting in fact it kind of fits appropriately.
I:8615;328;Filled with many memorable scenes like the assassination in the UN, Cary Grant trying to drive a car while drunk and of course the now classic crop.
I:8615;329;dusting sequence that is pure Hitchcock genius all the way.
I:8615;330;The cliffhanger ending on Mount Rushmore is incredibly suspenseful and equally memorable.
I:8615;331;One of the most constantly entertaining films of all time, Hitchcock at his peak and at his most charming.
I:8615;332;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film a 10!
I:8615;333;I have always enjoyed Cary Grant movies and I love the way of Alfred Hitchcock makes his movies, it keeps you guessing thru the whole movie.
I:8615;334;The movie arrived in a short period of time and in good condition.
I:8615;335;anyone who is a Cary Grant fan would be happy to have this in their collection.
I:8615;336;It still conjures up the excitement and thrills I experienced those many years ago.
I:8615;337;I enjoyed watching this move.
I:8615;338;Its a very good old classic.
I:8615;339;No special effects just great acting and easy to follow story line.
I:8615;340;this flick is one classic that everyone who loves a good thriller, one without a lot of blood and gore .
I:8615;341;well you will have to see this for yourself .
I:8615;342;it is one classic that the less you know, the more you'll enjoy it.
I:8615;343;I've seen this movie several times over the years, and it is still a classic!
I:8615;344;While Northwest By Northwest isn't necessarily mentioned in the short list of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces, it may well be the single most entertaining .
I:8615;345;in turns exciting, funny, stylish, sexy and intelligent.
I:8615;346;and defined the modern spy thriller as a roller.
I:8615;347;Alfred Hitchcock may be know for such classics as Psycho and Notourious, but his best picture by far is the action thriller North By Northwest.
I:8615;348;He has a good job, he has two divorces and a loyal secretary.
I:8615;349;this witty film had all the makings of a classic: a big time actor, a stunning leading lady, and Alfred Hitchcock.
I:8615;350;the two greatest scences, as expected, were the cropdusting scene and the Mount Rushmore scene.
I:8615;351;Big time stars from the golden age of movie making.
I:8615;352;A Hitchcock classic that the whole family will like.
I:8615;353;Filled with drama, laced with comedy, shot with some beautiful scenery and a good plot too.
I:8615;354;One of the great classic movies directed by Alfred Hitchcock.
I:8615;355;great condition and everyone should have this classic before they don't print it anymore.you children's children will still love it!
I:8615;356;Some suspense movies you see just once, and once you know how it ends, never see it again.
I:8615;357;I have seen it countless times and know the whole script/lines (almost) by heart, yet I am sure I will see it again and again in the future.
I:8615;358;This is the mark of a truly GREAT film.
I:8615;359;Coincidentally, Cary Grant gets up from his table at the same time to make a phone call to his mother.
I:8615;360;The cast is outstanding: Eva Marie Saint, Leo G. Carroll (perfectly droll in this role), Martin Landau in an early appearance, and of course, the menacing, but ever so sophisticated, bad guy, James Mason.
I:8615;361;The two English accents in this film give it a special panache and international intrigueness (is that a word?)
I:8615;362;, that just adds to the fun.
I:8615;363;The script by Ernest Lehman and the sensationally suspenseful music by Bernard Hermann just add to the the edge of your seat suspense.
I:8615;364;and last but not least, Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense, has definitely not directed a better film.
I:8615;365;Cary Grant standing by the side of the road in his gray suit in the middle of the prairie is one of the great shots in film history.
I:8615;366;"It's Hitchcock, for heaven's sake
I:8615;367;Classics are classics for a reason: they stand the test of time.
I:8615;368;NORTH BY NORTHWEST is about the best film Alfred Hitchcock ever made.
I:8615;369;The original master recordings of the score were recorded in stereo and have been mixed nicely along with the foley tracks to create the first true stereo version of this film.
I:8615;370;The picture is sharp and clean and is formatted correctly.
I:8615;371;A huge improvement of the previous widescreen laserdisc release.
I:8615;372;Try watching the two versions in sync side by side and you'll be appalled at the differences.
I:8615;373;on the plus side, there is an isolated music track in which all foley and dialogue is eliminated and you can enjoy the great Bernard Herrmann score.
I:8615;374;If you haven't seen it lately, watch it again.
I:8615;375;If you've never seen it, this is must.
I:8615;376;great movie night of a great classic .
I:8615;377;but has quite a bit of action and I find myself looking for SubtleHitchcock in the movie as he is always in them.
I:8615;378;just a good movie to watch
I:8615;379;Grant has such savoir faire.
I:8615;380;So this is the great North by Northwest by the great Hitchcock?
I:8615;381;One of the best Alfred Hitchcock Movies ever made.
I:8615;382;Suspenseful, funny, romantic and thrilling all in one.
I:8615;383;For an older movie, it was still well done and kept you wondering what was going to happen to Cary Grant next.
I:8615;384;Cary Grant is amusing and charming throughout.
I:8615;385;The tension builds considerably, especially during the last challenge needed for survival.
I:8615;386;The predicaments he faces are amusing, thanks to his droll responses to other characters.
I:8615;387;Really enjoyed seeing Cary Grant get in and out of scrapes in North By Northwest.
I:8615;388;There is romance, humor and trouble with a lot of action (chase scenes) that made me really want to know what Cary Grant would do next.
I:8615;389;I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.
I:8615;390;should be included in any short list of the best movies ever made.
I:8615;391;I'll tell my own criterion for rating the great movie: if after the very first show I remember ALL single frames of it .
I:8615;392;and insist of telling to my friends all the action frame by frame, which is certainly futil and silly action .
I:8615;393;than this IS indeed a great movie.
I:8615;394;I got back to States and bought this video the first thing!
I:8615;395;I watch it and watch it .
I:8615;396;That cool glittering elegance of Eva Marie Saint.
I:8615;397;Eat your hearts out, you .
I:8615;398;And Cary Grant's performance is beyond words.
I:8615;399;"Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" is one of the most clever movies I have ever had the pleasure of viewing."
I:8615;400;It's full of action from start to finish, rivaling any modern movie.
I:8615;401;north by Northwest was truly ahead of its time.
I:8615;402;The movie is full of elaborate schemes, twists, and surprises.
I:8615;403;roger Thornhill is the depiction of what every adolescent boy wants to grow up to be: confident, cocky, fearless, and un.
I:8615;404;shaken, with witty sarcastic one.
I:8615;405;Cary Grant plays the hero of the film perfectly.
I:8615;406;Eva Marie Saint's character plays the very flirtatious spy very well and looks even better.
I:8615;407;The acting is very impressive in this film.
I:8615;408;All the characters are unique and bring an individual presence to the movie.
I:8615;409;adding to the actor's performances, the cinematography is also quite an advantage to make this movie great.
I:8615;410;goers are familiar with Alfred Hitchcock's style in camera angles, music, and the new features he brings to bring the full effect to life.
I:8615;411;The music is fantastic and elevates the suspense for specific scenes.
I:8615;412;the movie has all the ingredients for a great action comedy.
I:8615;413;Ultimately the movie is quite brilliant to keep the audience on their feet and always second guessing.
I:8615;414;A great script, great director, and wonderful acting have made this movie a must see.
I:8615;415;I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys an action comedy.
I:8615;416;If you're a fan of Hitchcock, then you will love this movie.
I:8615;417;Keeps you going the whole time.
I:8615;418;a great movie to add to your collection.
I:8615;419;This classic movie was a wonderful gift for a dear friend.

I:8615;421;transfered vintage movie, and I'm happy to say that Alfred Hitchcock's 1959 masterpiece 'North by Northwest' is a worthy choice for that movie.
I:8615;422;It's a classic, pure and simple.
I:8615;423;From the wonderful performances by Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint to the jaw.
I:8615;424;dropping Mount Rushmore and (my personal favorite) crop duster sequences, 'North by Northwest' is a high.
I:8615;425;caliber suspense film, through and through.
I:8615;426;one aspect that sets it apart from many other movies of its day is the test of time.
I:8615;427;Even though it hit movie theaters more than 50 years ago, the action and humor in 'North by Northwest' have aged very well.
I:8615;428;I still laugh out loud when I watch it, and the suspense is still just as nail.
I:8615;429;ray format is to make the home viewing experience as close to the theatrical experience as possible.
I:8615;430;The incredibly sharp picture effectively transports the viewer back in time to a theater seat in 1959, right down to the old.
I:8615;431;the special features here are very impressive, including a standout documentary hosted by Eva Marie Saint.
I:8615;432;"My favorite, for some reason, is the featurette titled ""A Guided Tour with Alfred Hitchcock."""
I:8615;433;It's a genuinely funny and witty look at the movie, and shouldn't be missed.

I:8615;438;It is still a great story being told as only the master Hitchcock could tell it If you have not watched it, or seen it recently, it makes for a great evening of TV.
I:8615;439;My all time favorite Cary grant film.
I:8615;440;Alfred Hitchcock directing is superb.
I:8615;441;The supporting cast is wonderful.
I:8615;442;Better fare from sir Alfred and a gracefully aging grant.
I:8615;443;This is one of those pictures you can watch again and again.
I:8615;444;Wonderful photography, Hitchcock's great directing skills and a superb cast.
I:8615;445;"James Mason is the perfect ""nice"" villain."
I:8615;446;just what Hitchcock always said a villain should be.

I:8615;464;Blue ray is best of the forms I have.
I:8615;465;Hitchcock liked working with Cary Grant and James Stewart.
I:8615;466;Any of his movies that have either of these stars were exceptional and could be viewed by the whole family.
I:8615;467;North By Northwest is one of the most suspenseful of his movies and it has a good romance story to boot.
I:8615;468;Cary Grant is magnificent playing the innocent bystander caught up in a grand scheme of espionage.
I:8615;469;eva Marie Saint is wonderful as the romantic interest that is a unknown factor.

I:8615;480;This movie is a classic!
I:8615;481;A period piece that is most enjoyable.
I:8615;482;As an avid Hitchcock fan for almost 40 years (since being scared witless by Psycho on its first theatrical run), I have managed to see all of his movies and read a number of books about him.
I:8615;483;He is, I believe, the premier director in film history, and North by Northwest is his finest achievement.
I:8615;484;nine Steps, Hitchcock manages to make the movie fresh and inventive every step of the way, with suspense, humor, fine acting, literacy, and superior production values.
I:8615;485;One of he greatest movies ever made.
I:8615;486;A very exciting Alfred Hitchcock movie.
I:8615;487;It has you on the edge of your seat.
I:8615;488;I am a huge Hitchcock fan and thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
I:8615;489;Cary Grant is perfect in this role.
I:8615;490;He can be funny and then very serious.
I:8615;491;I recommend this to any Hitchcock or Cary Grant fan.
I:8615;492;It moves along with great acting, interesting plot and wonderful scenery.
I:8615;493;i would recommend this movie to others.
I:8615;494;50 years later, I watched it and found it even more gripping.
I:8615;495;It's a privilege to see it again.
I:8615;496;That the movie is great goes without saying.
I:8615;497;The extras are really interesting and informative as well, with background on both Hitchcock and Grant.
I:8615;498;My father in law loves this movie, but it would be nice to be able to watch it!
I:8615;499;Still holds up after all these years.

I:8615;504;You will certainly enjoy it as much as we did.
I:8615;505;This is the Hitchcock movie famous for the woman hanging off mount rushmore.
I:8615;506;The movie was humorous at the same time intelligently done with some interesting situations.
I:8615;507;Even though the movie has some adult situations it was a fairly clean movie.
I:8615;508;Amazingly well done for its time.
I:8615;509;When you are in the mood for watching some older movies, this is a must see!
I:8615;510;This has always been one of my favorite Hitchcock films, mainly because when you view the whole, you realize that it doesn't really fit into the typical suspense or horror category.
I:8615;511;It is more of an adventure film, a rollicking roller.
I:8615;512;coaster of entertainment infused with wry comedy, romance, glamour, and superb cinematography which sustains your interest, amazingly, for more than 130 minutes.
I:8615;513;And all the performances are memorable.
I:8615;514;from Grant's cynical executive to Eva Marie Saint's beautiful, smoldering agent, to James Mason's urbane, silky, villain.
I:8615;515;It comes right at the end of probably the director's greatest period of films.
I:8615;516;It also manages to make train travel exceedingly glamorous!!
I:8615;517;His kidnappers are good at covering their tracks and even Thornhill doesn't realize that George Kaplan doesn't really exist!
I:8615;518;liners' and an unforgettable plane/human chase that helps this movie stand out as one of Hitchcock's greatest thrillers.
I:8615;519;Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock combine for the expected classic production.
I:8615;520;Entertaining, fun, very well done.
I:8615;521;Love this movie and bought it as a Christmas Gift for family who I know will enjoy a really good Hitchcock mystery (not too scary).

I:8615;525;what an engaging and amazing film Mr. Hitchcock made indeed!
I:8615;526;old masterpiece had me hooked form the first frames!
I:8615;527;This film looks better than several more recent Blu.
I:8615;528;And the 5.1 sound mix from the orginal mono audio is one of the best I've heard for a mono.
I:8615;529;One of Alfred Hitchock's best films.
I:8615;530;"The picture is fantastic, it adds to that ""Movie Experience""."
I:8615;531;It is a pleasure to see it on Blu.
I:8615;532;This Hitchcock film, is not as dark and obsessive as other Hitchcock masterpieces (Vertigo and Rear Window) but is a brilliant paranoid's fantasy which eclipses the ideas of 39th Steps, The Wrong Man and Saboteur into a breezy sexy suspenseful stew of Hitch tics, themes, and style.
I:8615;533;Many of the best elements from his past films coalesced into this comedy thriller.
I:8615;534;Films which consulted with the North by Northwest blue print of mixing set pieces, intrigue, sex, multiple locations, comedy and suspense include the James Bond series, Charade, Mirage and a lesser parade of often over.
I:8615;535;Modern action films owe a lot to the film as well.
I:8615;536;The screenplay played right into Hitch's strengths and also included some wonderful witty dialogue.
I:8615;537;like Leo G. Carrol) pretty much insured the expensive 4 million dollar film (or so) would create some box office magic.
I:8615;538;it's perhaps the last film Hitch really enjoyed making.
I:8615;539;cary Grant at his most assuredly debonair plays advertising big wig, Roger O. Thornhill.
I:8615;540;but the initials R. o. t. look great on promotional matchbook covers.
I:8615;541;Thornhill is set up and accused of assasinating a U. n. ambassador, he meets sexy Eva Marie Saint on a train and then. . . Well, of course what follows is a lot of improbably hooey, but it's paced so energetically and delivered with such skill few will care for one moment how likely any of it is.
I:8615;542;There's a logic to everything and it sort of makes sense.
I:8615;543;along the way there's several exciting set pieces, including the crop dusting plane that tries to eliminate Thornhill/Kaplan, and of course the exciting finale at Mount Rushmore which is followed by perhaps my favorite edit in all of movies to quickly wrap up the film.
I:8615;544;i can just imagine what a truly exhilarating experience it must have been to movie audiences of the late 50's who first saw the film.
I:8615;545;A suspenseful, big budgeted comedy thriller that had a little romance and lots of excitement.
I:8615;546;One of his most memorable scores graces the film and adds immeasurably to it's success, but it was Herrmann who introduced writer Lehman to Hitchcock which resulted in North by Northwest being made.
I:8615;547;There is also a pleasant commentary track featuring writer Ernest Lehman.
I:8615;548;A great movie that holds up against today's thrillers.
I:8615;549;One of Hitchcock's best, but how can you miss with Gary Grant.
I:8615;550;ray because I had to see it again.
I:8615;551;Hitchcock swings back and forth between the believable and unbelievable and really gives you something to look at all the way through.
I:8615;552;Thanks to those who do this.
I:8615;553;I give it a 9.2 on a 10.0 scale.
I:8615;554;It was witty good action.
I:8615;555;Enjoyed it thoroughly, even if some parts were far fetched.
I:8615;556;More realistic than Bond but still an old school spy movie.
I:8615;557;This was a great movie.
I:8615;558;The movie was classic Hitchcock before he began making the much more intense thrillers.
I:8615;559;Lots of humorous lines played by Cary Grant while still having that edge that can make you breathless.
I:8615;560;Came in excellent condition and pretty fast.
I:8615;561;It is a very suspenseful and exciting movie and I will enjoy again and again.
I:8615;562;This is arguably Cary Grants best film.
I:8615;563;Couple that with a terrific cast, dynamite story, immortal one.
I:8615;564;liners, some great scenes in actual locations, and classic Hitchcock editing and you have a shoe.
I:8615;565;The costumes are very natural, having been bought in actual New York stores, and the set designs are beautifully designed.
I:8615;566;The set decoration is also first rate.
I:8615;567;The color looks perfectly natural, the sound is full, low noise stereo and the widescreen is anamorphic.
I:8615;568;The menu is also animated to match the Saul Bass opening title and is wonderful.
I:8615;569;The making of film (30 minutes long) is superb and hosted by beautiful leading lady Eve Marie Saint .
I:8615;570;finally, the score by Bernard Hermann adds to the high tension of the action.
I:8615;571;The orchestration and performance on this film is one of the very best of all time.
I:8615;572;I can't recommend this film enough for action, solid story and terrific action besides just being completely entertaining.
I:8615;573;Great old, great old, great old, great old, great old movie.
I:8615;574;Interesting story line even though it goes back to the Cold War days.
I:8615;575;It's one of my favorite Hitchcock movies, even if the plot makes less sense than usual.
I:8615;576;"There's nice chemistry between Grant and Saint
I:8615;577;Leonard (Martin Landau) with a crush on Mason is also great.
I:8615;578;The train through the tunnel at the end is an excellent example of how Hitchcock could be naughty without being explicit.
I:8615;579;most of all, in my view, Hitchcock and Grant have a worthy adversary in James Mason.
I:8615;580;The guy was a superb actor, a genuine heavy weight, and he brings such style and menace to the part.
I:8615;581;I think he easily matches Grant in the suave department.
I:8615;582;Roger had overheard that Vandamm was going to Chicago, so he hops on a train where he meets a lovely young woman, Eve Kendal, who turns out to be Vandamm's girlfriend.
I:8615;583;north By Northwestis a cleverly written thriller that takes you from New York to the top of Mount Rushmore in South Dakota.
I:8615;584;Alfred Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors in cinema history and his direction alone makes the movie standout from all others.
I:8615;585;There are great performances by screen.
I:8615;586;legends Cary Grant and James Mason that highlight this mistaken identity tale.
I:8615;587;cut film, so older kids can enjoy watching this classic movie too.
I:8615;588;I love this movie, it's a great classic and I watch it every now and then.
I:8615;589;Cary grant is as handsome and elegant as always and the plot keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:8615;590;which is action and thrills.
I:8615;591;a perfect example of the dumbest possible action propelling the plot, which is usually an artistic killer.
I:8615;592;He is charming, delightful, suave, and the fact that he never seems to get a hair out of place in assorted acts of derring.
I:8615;593;Technically, the film holds up much better than many of Hitchcock's other efforts, for the process screens are not always readily detectable, as they are in other of his films.
I:8615;594;especially the Mount Rushmore set, are fabulous, even by modern standards.
I:8615;595;While the cinematography by Robert Burks is solid, there are no eyepopping moments, and the score by Bernard Herrmann is one of his least memorable, especially considering what was just around the corner in Psycho.
I:8615;596;although oddly linked to a supposed quote from William Shakespeare's Hamlet, is not a great film, but it is a terrific movie, and because it is such utter and unrepentant fluff it holds up much better than many other 1950s vintage films, including many of Hitchcock's own overrated `masterpieces', such as Rear Window and Vertigo.
I:8615;597;After all, the perfect hair of Cary Grant is never something to be diminished.
I:8615;598;in any case, this is an amazing disc.
I:8615;599;It's fun to watch the old trailers, featurettes, etc.
I:8615;600;The book packaging is first rate.
I:8615;601;This film is as new and fresh today as it was half a century ago.
I:8615;602;Real actors, great dialogue and music and of course great direction.
I:8615;603;"I have always been a big Alfred Hitchcock fan and ""North by Northwest"" was in my view his most entertaining and important film."
I:8615;604;There are so many memorable lines in this movie (brilliantly written by Ernest Lehman) that one doesn't know where to start when recollecting favourite gems.
I:8615;605;"Mason: ""With such expert play."
I:8615;606;"You will be quite convincing, I assure you""."
I:8615;607;I've got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex.
I:8615;608;"James Mason discussing how to get rid of Saint: ""This matter is best disposed of from a great height ."
I:8615;609;this is a fast moving witty thriller in magnificent Technicolor with Cary Grant as Roger O. Thornhill giving the performance of a lifetime.
I:8615;610;It's a roller coaster ride of thrills, suspense, comedy and romance skilfully put together with the expert Hitchcock touch.
I:8615;611;North by Northwest was Cary Grant's fourth collaboration with legendary director Alfred Hitchcock and in my opinion it was definitely THE BEST!
I:8615;612;the acting by the principals was first class, the brilliant script by Ernest Lehman was packed with sparkling and witty dialogue and the music score by Bernard Herrmann was outstanding.
I:8615;613;Cary Grant as Roger O. Thornhill was at his most elegant and although nearly 60 at the time threw himself into this very physical part with the energy and vigour of a much younger man.
I:8615;614;James Mason as the chief heavy Phillip Vandamm was particularly good in a smooth and menacing portrayal.
I:8615;615;There were some fine supporting roles of note including that wonderful actress Jessie Royce Landis as Grant's mother (although in reality only a few months older than him!)
I:8615;616;"This actress also appeared with Cary Grant in another Hitchcock film ""To Catch a Thief"" in which she played Grace Kelly's mother."
I:8615;617;"One of my favourite actresses Doreen Lang had the small part of Grant's secretary Maggie and can also be seen in other Hitchcock films such as ""The Wrong Man"" and ""The Birds""."
I:8615;618;There were some marvellous and professionally photographed Hitchcock set pieces in unusual locations such as the United Nations Building, New York's Grand Central Station, Mount Rushmore and who can forget the famous crop dusting sequence at Prairie Stop on deserted Highway 41.
I:8615;619;There was also a long train sequence which is another Hitchcock trademark.
I:8615;620;"some favourite lines from the film:Cary Grant (to group in Townsend's house): ""What a performance!"""
I:8615;621;"malcolm Atterbury (to Grant): ""That's funny, that plane's dusting crops where there ain't no crops""."
I:8615;622;who was, in retrospect, the ideal actor for this role.
I:8615;623;What a fantastic film .
I:8615;624;one that can be enjoyed over and over again with increasing pleasure.
I:8615;625;Easily my favorite Hitchcock movie.
I:8615;626;Every time I watch this one I enjoy it and after seeing it several times, I still look forward to watching it again.
I:8615;627;We recently watched it with our 13 year old son, and he even liked it.
I:8615;628;Good story, good suspense, never gets boring.
I:8615;629;Wish movies nowadays are more like this one.
I:8615;630;the most outrageous scene, of course, involved the now famous crop duster.
I:8615;631;It was a great scene, except for the fakey crash.
I:8615;632;Cary Grant has to be the quintessential Hitchcock male (if Grace Kelly is his blonde)!
I:8615;633;So suave and charismatic, he is just splendid as the playboy who is mistaken for a government agent.
I:8615;634;This mistaken identity (a favorite plot point for Hitch) leads Cary Grant on a cross country journey that culminates in one of the most unforgettable cinematic scenes at Mt. Rushmore.
I:8615;635;eva Marie Saint is splendid as the double agent helping and bumbling Grant along the way.
I:8615;636;this is a truly great film: filled with comedy and mayhem, as well as murder and political intrigue.
I:8615;637;If you want an older movie that stands the test of time, this is it.
I:8615;638;It has great acting, smart lines, and is great to watch.
I:8615;639;Classic Hitchcock, Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint were great for the roles the black and white of the film adds a lot to the period experience
I:8615;640;It's a family classic, aged gracefully and good for everyone.
I:8615;641;It's old fashioned effects require a bit of imagination, but still wonderful.
I:8615;642;I'm not very good at reviewing movies but I will say that this one most definitely keeps your attention.
I:8615;643;Suspense in all of the right places and the famous plane scene is strangely eerie.
I:8615;644;This movie is a classic with elements of mistaken.
I:8615;645;Eva Marie Saint is absolutely gorgeous and plays a very good double agent.
I:8615;646;Cary Grant is excellent as the protagonist and really carries the film.
I:8615;647;The twists, plot devices, and casting choices are the reasons this movie is one of the greatest ever made.
I:8615;648;North By Northwest is a definite recommendation to all.
I:8615;649;north by Northwest is a timeless classic involving action, adventure, drama, suspense and even some well.
I:8615;650;timed comedy, all rooted from a simple case of mistaken identity.
I:8615;651;Along the way, Thornhill meets a beautiful blond named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) who adds a lot of sex appeal along with several surprises to this wild and wonderful plot.
I:8615;652;the movie is masterpiece for numerous reasons.
I:8615;653;The first reason is because of the some of the unforgettable action shots including Grant being attacked by a crop dusting plane in a remote cornfield and then being chased across the face of Mount Rushmore.
I:8615;654;But beyond just the action, there many brilliant scenes where Grant either alludes the people tracking him or simply just outsmarts them and does some impressive detective work on his own.
I:8615;655;The script oozes with witty and clever lines with many visually memorable scenes as well.
I:8615;656;Another strength of the movie is a powerful music score that accentuates every crucial moment in the film.
I:8615;657;Furthermore, Grant and Mason give outstanding performances, perhaps their best.
I:8615;658;Not only is this Hitchcock's best, but from my personal viewpoint, it ranks #4 on my list of the greatest movies ever made behind Casablanca and The Godfather I and II.
I:8615;659;The widescreen color transfer is completely immaculate, and rich in color and sharpness .
I:8615;660;The sound is also outstanding for a film this old.
I:8615;661;There many bonuses, but the best is the making of the film with a cross the country diary of how and where the movie was shot.
I:8615;662;There is also a very good commentary by the Earnest Lehman who wrote the screenplay.
I:8615;663;North By Northwest makes Grant's fourth and last Hitchcock film, the others being Suspicion, Notorious, and To Catch A Thief.
I:8615;664;He is unexpectedly hijacked and taken to a manor house, and interrogated by two men, a Mr. Townsend (James Mason) and his assistant Leonard (Martin Landau).
I:8615;665;looking blonde, who conceals him aboard a train, and all because he has a nice face.
I:8615;666;I've got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex.
I:8615;667;Eve tells Roger, I'm a big girl.
I:8615;668;He says, And in all the right places too.
I:8615;669;And the climactic scene at Mount Rushmore is a classic, as is that now.
I:8615;670;Hold on to your hats!
I:8615;671;Oh, and the auction scene is both humorous but clever, once one realizes the motive for Thornhill's actions.
I:8615;672;One, the best way to conceal yourslf if you're a wanted murder is to wear dark glasses.
I:8615;673;A real classic, what is not to like about it?Great to watch after a recent visit to Mt Rushmore.
I:8615;674;North By Northwest is classic Hitchcock.
I:8615;675;I believe this is one if not the best of his films.
I:8615;676;Action, intrigue, emotion, humor (at times) and great letterbox flick!!!
I:8615;677;I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves great films.
I:8615;678;It's not a scary Hitchcock movie, but more suspenseful and keeps you on your toes.
I:8615;679;With that said, Hitchcock takes us cross.
I:8615;680;country with gorgeous landscapes and a breathtaking scene at Mount Rushmore.
I:8615;681;And Hitchcock uses his strengths in this movie, choosing Cary Grant to play a man on the run and trying to prove his innocence before it is too late.
I:8615;682;"This movie also has the classic scene of the dust cropper and the quote from a man saying, ""That's funny, that plane's dustin' crops where there ain't no crops."""
I:8615;683;This movie is in color and holds up very well almost 50 years after the release.
I:8615;684;But definitely worth seeing and I am glad no one has tried to remake this movie, because they would probably just mess it up.
I:8615;685;I've been a fan of Hitchcock for a long time and this is one of my favorite films.
I:8615;686;It's probably the one I've watched the most.
I:8615;687;some really classic scenes in this movie!
I:8615;688;and the acting was fantastic.
I:8615;689;He meets up with the beautiful and mysterious Eva Marie Saint and the two embark on a dangerous game of cat and mouse that culminates in a chase across Mount Rushmore.
I:8615;690;James Mason and Martin Landau are fantastic as the villains!
I:8615;691;Classic movie one of my all time favorites.
I:8615;692;I love all of the Alfred Hitchcock movies complete with mystery, love and excitement!
I:8615;693;As the first true action movie, one might argue that North by Northwest has a lot to answer for.
I:8615;694;The lone hero with an incredible serendipity factor ( Die Hard, Pee.
I:8615;695;Perhaps because they were once done so well.
I:8615;696;Notice how their hands are always in the shot?All in all, this movie represents one of the three best ways you can spend two hours.
I:8615;697;Even after all these years it is still one of the best films made.
I:8615;698;Be sure to watch the extras lots of fun and interesting things there.
I:8615;699;When you pair these two together, you get an amazing movie.
I:8615;700;The sets and cinematography are amazing.
I:8615;701;The edition also comes with great features.
I:8615;702;this movie is simply fantastic.
I:8615;703;Sir Alfred Hitchcock was known to be the master of suspense and with the release of North By Northwest the studios are able to allow audiances to see this again as well as a new generation!
I:8615;704;With the supurb musical score that leaves you clinging to your armchair and the finale that is one of the best Sir Alfred ever filmed in cinematic history with supurb cameos from great '50s character actors ie Leo G. Carroll there is no reason not to watch this more than once.
I:8615;705;I have seen it three times in three days and have enjoyed every moment of it!
I:8615;706;The usual Hitchcock suspense and drama are present, but the combination of Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant is superb.
I:8615;707;Isn't it interesting that the two best movies made by the great Alfred Hitchcock both starred Cary Grant?
I:8615;708;grant gets away, of course and then the fun begins.
I:8615;709;The ride takes you from Manhattan on a 2,000 mile trip to the face of Mount Rushmore.
I:8615;710;the film is littered with reliable supporting actors including the hilarious Jessie Royce Landis as Grant's mother.
I:8615;711;She absolutely steals her scenes early in the movie.
I:8615;712;Leo G. Carroll, a Hitchcock regular, shows up to provide the movie's most critical information, and finally, a very young Martin Landau is James Mason's second hand henchman.
I:8615;713;The story is just unbelievable enough to laugh at, but realistic enough to take seriously as well.
I:8615;714;Grant is fabulous here, having lots of fun with the situations presented.
I:8615;715;this movie is really atypical for Hitchcock, who was more about what happens in the mind than action on the screen.
I:8615;716;(See Notorious or Vertigo, possibly his most cerebral film) Even movies like Psycho were more inside the head than the physical action (save the two gruesome murders) But not North by Northwest.
I:8615;717;Someone mentioned this movie so I was curious and decided to watch it.
I:8615;718;I know that others think that it is a terrific movie.
I:8615;719;The colors are more distinct and varied, and the resolution is slightly better.
I:8615;720;this is one of my favorite movies, and it's great to watch it in this format.
I:8615;721;From start to finish, a rollercoaster ride of thrills and surprises.
I:8615;722;Cary Grant was never better than Roger Thornhill.
I:8615;723;A fun yarn with Cary Grant at his best.
I:8615;724;Love the story line, clever dialogue, scenery and the sophistication of that generation, Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint are excellent.
I:8615;725;Perhaps Hitchcock's best film, and Cary Grant's best dramatic performance.
I:8615;726;Hitchcock proves that flashy special effects are not needed as Grant, while drugged, drives down a curving, moutain road, and the viewer is taken along for the ride with a fuzzy point.
I:8615;727;It makes you squirm right out of your seat.
I:8615;728;See this movie if you never have experienced Hitchcock's psychologocal mind.
I:8615;729;ray 50th anniversary edition of this film and it was INCREDIBLE.
I:8615;730;Like seeing it for the first time on the screen.
I:8615;731;This is without a doubt the best film Alfred Hitchcock did.
I:8615;732;It has almost every element a movie can have, and a diverse set of characters and locations.
I:8615;733;It is suspense the whole way through, even the 6th time seeing it.
I:8615;734;If any film can be timeless, this is it.
I:8615;735;Hitchcock eases Cary Grant through this role with such cool believability, it make me want to take the train.
I:8615;736;"LOTS of emphasis is put on what they considered ""clever"" dialog of the day I guess."
I:8615;737;see if your local library has it.
I:8615;738;When you think of the mystery and the suspense this movie creates in a time well before computer special effects, Hitchcock was able to keep you on the edge of your seat in a way few movies can.
I:8615;739;This movie keeps getting better and better.
I:8615;740;it really is more enjoyable with each viewing.
I:8615;741;This film should be a must for the younger generation.
I:8615;742;Excellent acting, classic Hichcock, Good plot.
I:8615;743;Eva Marie Saint plays the perfect dishy blond.
I:8615;744;This movie has all the adventure that a movie goer want.
I:8615;745;and the back ground of how the movie was made makes it even better.
I:8615;746;Watched this with the kids and even they liked it.
I:8615;747;Cary Grant is great in this Hitchcock classic.
I:8615;748;Not scary, but good story.
I:8615;749;Pretty neat premise with lots of twists and turns.
I:8615;750;This has been a favorite for years .
I:8615;751;a classic example of 60's Hitchcock.
I:8615;752;It is a wonderful classic, not to be missed.
I:8615;753;But what really shines in the film is its breath.
I:8615;754;ive seen films forty years newer than this movie that dont look as clean.
I:8615;755;The extras very informative, the commentary funny and interesting, the previews, hilarious.
I:8615;756;This is an excellent disk.
I:8615;757;If your a fan of the film, you must own this ultimate editon of the Alfred Hitchcock classic.
I:8615;758;A motivational speaker for the latter day bond films.
I:8615;759;Although many may remember the Indiana corn field scene when they think of this film, it is scenes like the camera shot from the top of the United Nations building that could be on a museum wall with other great art.
I:8615;760;This shows Hitchcock for the incredible visual artist that he was.
I:8615;761;By far Alfred Hitchcock's best movie.
I:8615;762;just a great spy movie with lots of action and twists up the backside.
I:8615;763;You should enjoy it if you like movies at all.
I:8615;764;The Alfred Hitchcock formula for a great movie.
I:8615;765;take a blonde haired beauty i (eg eva marie saint, grace kelly.
I:8615;766;rear Window), fix her up with a wonderful actor ( eg cary grant, james stewart.
I:8615;767;One of Hitchcock's masterpieces made between Vertigo and Psycho, this is the master of suspense at his best.
I:8615;768;Every frame of this film shows loving attention to detail, when films were made for grown.
I:8615;769;ray book is beautifully produced and I'd like to see more blu.
I:8615;770;rays produced in this way (Vertigo!
I:8615;771;This is a great movie if you like Alfred Hitchcock or Cary Grant.
I:8615;772;The acting is terrific, the lead characters work very well together, great tension.
I:8615;773;The dialogue is amazing, especially for it's time.
I:8615;774;This movie was recommended to us as a great family night movie to watch with our teens.
I:8615;775;The plot line was engaging and had unexpected twists that surprised us all.
I:8615;776;All in all, the whole family enjoyed the movie.
I:8615;777;I was in the mood for a classic and this one fit the bill.
I:8615;778;A classic with stars from the past.
I:8615;779;It has a complex plot with an unexpected twist.
I:8615;780;There are some great scenes.
I:8615;781;Lastly, Hitchcock's bawdy joke at the end is a hoot!
I:8615;782;One of the true classics, I can watch this every day.
I:8615;783;Cary Grant and James Mason carry the film all the way.
I:8615;784;North by Northwest has it all, comedy and mystery.
I:8615;785;My husband and I loved this movie!
I:8615;786;I had this movie on VHS and loved it.
I:8615;787;Will be glad to be able to see the movie over and over again.
I:8615;788;EMSaint is so demur and sensual.
I:8615;789;Great Hitch suspense and lots of on location camera covering NY to So Dakota's Faces.
I:8615;790;great escape from scary bad guys stuff that keeps you on the edge until the very end.
I:8615;791;one of my fav movies of all time.
I:8615;792;Many feel this is Alfred Hitchcock's greatest American movie, and I agree!
I:8615;793;NORTH BY NORTHWEST (NbyNW) is the Hitchcock film to end all Hitch films, with all his pet themes covered with maximum wit, panache, and suspense, as well as a romance between Cary Grant and a soign e Eva Marie Saint that's as tender as it is sexy.
I:8615;794;Grant has never been more engaging and dashing (literally and figuratively :.)
I:8615;795;NbyNW also boasts a great early performance by a reptilian young Martin Landau as Mason's possessive henchman, as well as one of Oscar nominee Ernest Lehman's best screenplays (in fact, he borrowed liberally from it for his script for the film version of THE PRIZE starring Paul Newman) and one of Bernard Herrmann's finest scores.
I:8615;796;It's amazing how time flies by when you are watching a movie featuring Carey Grant.
I:8615;797;This movie is 2hr, 17m long but it was so satisfying watching Grant perform.
I:8615;798;I was surprised to see Alfred Hitchcock was the Director.
I:8615;799;I always associated Hitchcock with scary movies.
I:8615;800;I think Hitchcock made a cameo appearance in the movie as well.
I:8615;801;Nobody comes close to Cary Grant, he is a great actor, and so handsome.
I:8615;802;I have seen this one several times and will watch again in a while.
I:8615;803;Movie was in perfect condition.
I:8615;804;Really good movie it was a gift for my husband
I:8615;805;North by Northwest has been hailed as one of director Alfred Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces.
I:8615;806;In terms of script, acting and intrigue, that is absolutely true.
I:8615;807;North by Northwest can be enjoyed for the same reasons as virtually ever other Hitchcock film, particularly because they keep the viewer guessing until the very end.
I:8615;808;even with the errors, North by Northwest is a wonderful movie, and is something worth owning .
I:8615;809;If you are an Alfred Hitchcock fan you know this is one of his best (in my opinion).
I:8615;810;It just gets better every time you watch it.
I:8615;811;"Excellent shots ""on location"" (or not?)"
I:8615;812;[A score by the masterful Benard Herrmann.]
I:8615;813;What else can I say, but go see it today!
I:8615;814;It is long but very satisfying.
I:8615;815;Eva Marie Saint is a beauty and great, method actress.
I:8615;816;She gives her role an extra strong air of authenticity.
I:8615;817;My memory was consistent with the uniformly rave reviews.
I:8615;818;Really worth watching and having.
I:8615;819;One of Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces.
I:8615;820;It has so much in it.
I:8615;821;the documentary accompanying the film narrated by Eve Marie Saint gives fantastic insights into the behind.
I:8615;822;the scenes goings on with one of our great filmmakers.
I:8615;823;northwest is one of the most purely entertaining and compelling films ever produced, and it is readily available on a fully.
I:8615;824;In doing this, he reaches a well.
I:8615;825;earned epiphany for both himself and his patient audience.
I:8615;826;There are memorable scenes in the United Nations in New York, Chicago, Mount Rushmore and even on Long Island, not to mention on the train with Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant from New York to Chicago.
I:8615;827;Many of the interesting and unusual sets are explained in the featurette, all of which are well done and are very useful and important to the film's realism, which remains surprisingly intact throughout all the permutations in the plot and scenery.
I:8615;828;Somewhat dry and not really coordinated with what is happening on screen but it is, after all, comments by the screenwriter so it is worth listening to at least once if you are interested.
I:8615;829;destination Hitchcock: The Making of North by Northwest, with host Eva Marie Saint, Martin Landau, screenwriter Ernest Lehman, Patricia Hitchcock and others.
I:8615;830;This is a somewhat interesting 40.
I:8615;831;minute featurette, the high point of which is Martin Landau doing an excellent impression of Hitchcock during minute 28 of the 40.
I:8615;832;"northwest"" is my favorite Hitchcock film."
I:8615;833;For me, it is the Hitchcock film that stands up best to nearly a half century of repeated viewings.
I:8615;834;NORTH BY NORTHWEST is a case of the right men [Hitchcock and Grant] making a most entertaining 'Wrong Man' film.
I:8615;835;identity classic remains daring, original and vibrant enough to hang with the big boys of the modern age.
I:8615;836;The concept that powers the whole bag is astonishingly simple, and once it's knocked out of the way in the first act, the picture is then perfectly happy to gradually up the stakes and riff on the premise for the rest of its allotted time.
I:8615;837;It's a testament to the creativity of the filmmakers that it still feels so fresh and untainted today, in the era of the derivative knock.
I:8615;838;Classic, timeless action / adventure / suspense.
I:8615;839;Cary Grant was a master of subtle romantic comedy, but he was also an outstanding actor in other films as well .
I:8615;840;including this classic thriller in which he costars with the great James Mason and the beautiful Eva Marie Saint.
I:8615;841;In addition to being a classic thriller, this movie has an outstanding music score.
I:8615;842;In every way it is one of the best movies ever made.
I:8615;843;at the end of his career Grant received an Academy Award for lifetime achievement, but it amazes me that he was nominated only once for a best actor Academy Award when year after year he gave outstanding performances of various kinds which merited recognition.
I:8615;844;In my opinion, Cary Grant was the best performer of the Golden age of Hollywood .
I:8615;845;Cary grant and his grey suit have a brilliant performance in this movie.
I:8615;846;I recommend this to every lover of classic movies.
I:8615;847;Great movie and highly recommended.
I:8615;848;But I will say that the blu.
I:8615;849;ray is well worth having if you're a fan.
I:8615;850;Nice movie set in old times, with James Bond like hero who is not a professional spy, yet acts like one.
I:8615;851;If you are a Hitchcock fan, this is the film to see.
I:8615;852;The cast is excellent and Carey is is at his best and my all time favorite film.
I:8615;853;It's an excellent thriller that I will watch again and again.
I:8615;854;North by Northwest(1959) is one of the greatest chase pictures care of Alfred Hitchcock.
I:8615;855;This comedy/thriller rolls right along for its duration as Cary Grant's character is constantly on the run for his life.
I:8615;856;This is a nice overall package of a great movie.
I:8615;857;Classic mystery adventure triller with a complex well written plot Well acted.
I:8615;858;"A sublime, suspenseful confection from Alfred Hitchcock, 1959's ""North by Northwest"" has become a classic addition to the master's canon even though it lacks the risk."
I:8615;859;"curdling thrills of his next classic film, ""Psycho""."
I:8615;860;This stands the test of time as a sophisticated thriller that is alternately clever and contrived, fast.
I:8615;861;it is the ideal showcase for the debonair but innately accessible Cary Grant, starring as the prototypical wronged man who unwillingly embarks on a perilous odyssey away from the comfortably insulated life he led.
I:8615;862;she seems a natural at it.
I:8615;863;But under Hitchcock's sure direction and recognizable visual style, it is also one of the most supremely entertaining of movies.
I:8615;864;there are a plethora of memorable scenes, set pieces really for Hitchcock to concoct some suspense in order to showcase his unique visual style.
I:8615;865;These include the wonderful crop.
I:8615;866;Much of the credit for the film's success belongs to Ernest Lehman, who penned the original screenplay, and Bernard Herrmann for his atmospheric score.
I:8615;867;NORTH BY NORTHWEST is one of Hitchcock's masterpieces, no doubt about that.
I:8615;868;One of the best with a great Cary Grant performance.
I:8615;869;a must see movie .
I:8615;870;It is thrilling, exciting and at times totally hilarious.
I:8615;871;as for the cast, it is excellent!
I:8615;872;Cary Grant gives a perfect performance as Roger O. Thornhill .
I:8615;873;and he is hilarious and charming, as ever!
I:8615;874;Eva Marie Saint is also very good, as the mysterious and glamorous girl Cary meets on the train.
I:8615;875;James Mason does a wonderful job playing the debonair but evil villian.
I:8615;876;directed by Hitchcock, this is a great comedy/thriller .
I:8615;877;in my opinion, it is Hitchcock's best movie!
I:8615;878;Great old Cary Grant movie!
I:8615;879;Yes, it's dated now, but the excitement of the chase is still there and so is the music and the Hitchcock suspense edge.
I:8615;880;I thought the story was somehow interesting.
I:8615;881;when I heard this film was made in 1959 I thought this might be new for the audience in those ages.
I:8615;882;When I saw the last scene I thought this is the ordinary ending we can see in Hollywood films.
I:8615;883;This was one of Hitchcock's best and took him into what I would suggest his best period, just as some were suggesting he was too old.
I:8615;884;Perhaps the start of the period was with Vertigo in 1958 and followed by a string of great films .
I:8615;885;the plot is the oft used wrong man story but supported by a great cast .
I:8615;886;This is classic Hitchcock with a great story and one of the most famous men's suits in motion picture history.
I:8615;887;Smart and sexy, the plot is full of intrigue and will keep you guessing until the end.
I:8615;888;As for Cary Grant's suit, it started a trend in men's fashion and is considered by many to be one of the best.
I:8615;889;He is so good in this movie.
I:8615;890;I love the chemistry between him and Eva Marie Saint .
I:8615;891;This classic Cary Grant flick has action, intrigue, and romance.
I:8615;892;This movie is one of the greatest Alfred Hitchcock films.
I:8615;893;Nominated as one of the top 100 films of all time by the American Film Institute, this film deserves its distinguished place in the annals of American film.
I:8615;894;Eva Marie Sant is charming as Eve Kendall, having spruced up her image from On the Waterfront (or maybe its the transition from to color).
I:8615;895;North By Northwest is the perfect Hitchcock film, as it combines suspense with mystery to make a film that is truly unforgettable.
I:8615;896;This thrilling adventure has lots of action, romance, the beautiful blonde (Eve Marie Saint), and lots of humor.
I:8615;897;"I always remember Thornhill (Grant) telling the thugs who leave him at the library ""I'll catch on my reading."""
I:8615;898;Thornhill's relationship with his mother (played by Jesse Royce Landis) is quite amusing.
I:8615;899;There's a scene at the elevator that involves Thornhill, his mother, and the two hired assassins pursuing Thornhill that is quite hilarious and a stroke of genius.
I:8615;900;"She's ""a looker"" and pretty sensuous."
I:8615;901;I suspended my disbelief in the plausibility of its events and enjoyed it.
I:8615;902;North by Northwest is a classic Hitchcock movie.
I:8615;903;this movie holds up well, is wonderfully acted ,and is visually stunning.
I:8615;904;if you're a fan of Hitch, Cary Grant or just great movies i Highly recommend it.
I:8615;905;The clarity and colors were amazing.
I:8615;906;The documentaries that are also included on the disk are also very interesting.
I:8615;907;Very impressive transfer for such an old film.
I:8615;908;No CGI, just terrific writing, acting, and directing.
I:8615;909;A superb film by Alfred Hitchcock!
I:8615;910;This has to be one of the most suspenseful films of the 20th Century.
I:8615;911;Even though it was made back in 1959, it still has high tension all over it even today.
I:8615;912;It's an interesting premise: a man is wrongfully accused and is being pursued all around the country.
I:8615;913;It might be simple enough, but it's much more complicated than it seems.
I:8615;914;Here, we get a romantic subplot, a government conspiracy, several chase sequences, clever dialogue, perfectly.
I:8615;915;timed humor, brilliant performances by Cary Grant and Eva Maria Saint, etc.
I:8615;916;Hitchcock, one of the finest directors in the 20th Century, has given us a marvel.
I:8615;917;It's a definite classic among top thrillers.
I:8615;918;I wouldn't necessarily say that it's perfect, but it's an excellent film nonetheless.
I:8615;919;Although not as complex as Vertigo or Rear Window, this is Hitchcock at his most enjoyable.
I:8615;920;duster scene continues to be possibly one of the best suspense scenes I've ever seen, and it was only done with a plane, an empty field, and Cary Grant.
I:8615;921;The cast is perfect, the script is full of surprises and funny in a smart kind of way that modern moviemaking just doesn't understand.
I:8615;922;The color separation is vivid and sharp, and I only noticed two or three imperfections in the print, which is amazing considering the age of this film.
I:8615;923;The stereo separation and noise reduction are great.
I:8615;924;writing and suspence that'll have you on the edge of your seat without the need for lots of violence and special effects.
I:8615;925;This is by far one of Cary Grant's best films.
I:8615;926;We now own the collection of most Alfred Hitchcock movies and actually play a game while watching them, for invariably he appears during his films.
I:8615;927;We watch and see who can spot his cameo appearances.
I:8615;928;my favorite is when Mr. Hitchcock is part of a portrait.
I:8615;929;north by Northwest was produced in 1959 and it has a recipe of romance, intrigue, thrilling action, and mystery that produces a brilliant performance by Cary Grant.
I:8615;930;Mr. Thornhill is drugged but escapes and a fascinating series of events start to shape the plot.
I:8615;931;During this film, we see the appearance of great actors from Mission Impossible, the Man from Uncle, and other shows, which keep us at the edge of our seat with their mystery, thrilling action, and romance.
I:8615;932;She is sexy, elegant, poised.
I:8615;933;and the two engage in some of the most interesting dialogue, which at some point, culminates in the most interesting of romantic kisses ever produced by Hollywood.
I:8615;934;the filming in New York City allows the audience to travel through Manhattan in the 50's and it is amazing how it all remains the same, and yet due to security.
I:8615;935;I will say, though, that this is one of my favorite movies by Alfred Hitchcock.
I:8615;936;Good acting, good story plus good actors, how can you go wrong.
I:8615;937;Cary Grant is always a plus to any movie.
I:8615;938;It held our attention from start to finish.
I:8615;939;I would recommend it to everyone.
I:8615;940;This is among my favorites.
I:8615;941;the movie keeps on getting better each time I see it.
I:8615;942;I fell in love with North By Northwest a long time ago and have always considered it one of not just Alfred Hitchcock's best films but one of the best movies ever made.
I:8615;943;All available as exquisite remastered editions on Blu.
I:8615;944;Charade available as a Criterion Collection edition.
I:8615;945;but North By Northwest either as a stand alone digibook by WB or in the Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection is in itself a masterpiece of a movie.
I:8615;946;Eva Marie Saint is the perfect Ice Queen.
I:8615;947;The dialog sparkles and the plot is rich and twisted.
I:8615;948;Produced in 1959, this is a beautiful example of Hitchcock's best, a the balanced mystery.
I:8615;949;There are shots and scenes which are so classic they will remain with you long after you view it.
I:8615;950;The supporting cast is a great collection of character performers too.
I:8615;951;"a personal preference: I like viewing this one with Stanley Donen's 1963 film ""Charade"" (starring Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Walter Matthau.)"
I:8615;952;This is the best Hitchcock style film never made by Hitchcock but Donen's homage.
I:8615;953;It features another fine assortment of supporting players.
I:8615;954;The two films work well in tandem.
I:8615;955;After all these years it still fun to watch.
I:8615;956;This is acclaimed by many as one of Hitchcock's best films, but it is also known as one of his biggest blunders.
I:8615;957;Though we are left with more than a few questions about Eve after the love scene, imagine how wonderfully confused we would have been if Kaplan's identity weren't revealed so early in the film.
I:8615;958;despite these flaws, the film is still intriguing, with a number of unpredictable twists.
I:8615;959;The second half of the film is much tighter and filled with Hitchcock's trademark suspense scenes.
I:8615;960;Cary Grant is at his debonair best as the acerbic ad executive who is beguiled by Eve's beauty and charm.
I:8615;961;"Eva Marie Saint is best known for her movie debut as Edie in ""On The Waterfront"", but she is every bit as good in this film."
I:8615;962;Hers is a very complex character, duplicitous and devious, yet vulnerable and torn, and she handles it with facility.
I:8615;963;James Mason is enigmatic and elusive as VanDamm and a youthful Martin Landau does a nice job as VanDamm's tough lieutenant.
I:8615;964;"i enjoyed this film, but I don't believe it attains the level of excellence of Hitchcock's other renowned films (""Psycho"", ""Vertigo"" and ""Rear Window"")."
I:8615;965;Even so, a bad day for Hitchcock is like the best day for most directors.
I:8615;966;It's still fine, though a little dated compared to 1958.
I:8615;967;One of Hitchcock's best and while it's unlikely business, it's a treat from swarmy James Mason to Cary's mother (whose name I can't remember).
I:8615;968;As the last collaboration between Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock, they came together to make the ultimate thriller in North by Northwest.
I:8615;969;Trying to clear his name, Grant finds himself fleeing the actual killers.
I:8615;970;From the beginning when you see the opening credits and hear the score, you gear up for adventure and that is exactly what you get.
I:8615;971;It follows the wonderful tradition of Hitchcock films and it does not fail to entertain.
I:8615;972;Besides great locations, a memorable score, and interesting camera work, the story is wonderful.
I:8615;973;You got to have it if you love CG.
I:8615;974;That house they made for the film is beautiful.
I:8615;975;Great movie for it's time.
I:8615;976;Great every time I watch.
I:8615;977;Eva Marie Saint is stylish.
I:8615;978;But Mount Rushmore steals the show.
I:8615;979;as already attested by other reviewers, it is an excellent Hitchcock film for the period, originally shot on 65mm emulsion, and with a memorable musical score.
I:8615;980;in summary: Great movie, mediocre Blu.
I:8615;981;What else can I say but that it was good.
I:8615;982;The product arrived on time and in great condition.
I:8615;983;It was also the best price i found.
I:8615;984;This is probably the best Alfred Hitchcock movie of them all.
I:8615;985;And the price on Amazon beats everyone.
I:8615;986;The witty dialogue and snappy one.
I:8615;987;liner jokes delivered by the brilliant Cary Grant still hold up well today.
I:8615;988;esque storyline is meant to be so outrageous as to be funny and if taken in that spirit many of the scenes are very entertaining indeed.
I:8615;989;"duster in the middle of nowhere, etc make fans of Kafka's works like ""The Trial"" and ""Metamorphosis"" who can appreciate the genre truly appreciate and enjoy this film masterpiece."
I:8615;990;"Despite these screenplay ""shortcomings"" the acting is very good and I liked the camera angles very much for an overall very good film."
I:8615;991;Great combination of humour, thrills and spills, tension and drama makes this a classic film for the ages.
I:8615;992;ray Book Edition separately and so I'll have to append it here.
I:8615;993;The picture book is nice to behold and will please collectors and fans alike.
I:8615;994;I love Cary Grant and anything he has done but his show is one of his and Hitchcock's best.
I:8615;995;The performance and the characters make a perfect match.
I:8615;996;"*** This comment may contain spoilers ***Alfred Hitchcock knew a recipe for a perfect thriller because he had made many but among his films, ""North by Northwest"" (1959) stands out as a great combination of suspense, sex, and humor."
I:8615;997;the film is packed with the witty and funny dialogs and one.
I:8615;998;liners as well as with artful and imaginative set pieces including Grant running for his life across the prairie from an evil crop.
I:8615;999;Hitchcock who always wanted to make a film with two scenes .
I:8615;1000;Among many of film's pleasures are Eva Marie Saint as sexy stranger on a train and James Mason and young Martin Landau as a duet of villains with a complicated relationship.
I:8615;1001;Even though it scored zero oscars come trophy time, NBNW was and still is one entirely great watch on any occasion.
I:8615;1002;His techniques in this movie are masterful including the giant mattes that included Mt. Rushmore (after the national park service prohibited the film makers from having actors crawl on the president's faces) in Hollywood to the famous crop dusting scene that included one of the top film explosions of its day.
I:8615;1003;There is action, suspense, drama, and a little love sprinkled in this master piece of a film.
I:8615;1004;transfer is beautiful and should be enjoyed by everyone who loves great films.
I:8615;1005;After all, Hitchcok, is maybe the best director in film history when it comes to visuality.
I:8615;1006;He keeps staring at him, but at first he doesn't really care about the plane, but when it keeps approching him he starts to wonder, and after a few moments, it flies right above his head, only about a meter over.
I:8615;1007;And the acting is premier.
I:8615;1008;This movie was very interesting and engaging.
I:8615;1009;During a mixup, he gets involved with a CIA operation that puts him in danger but also introduces him to the next love of his life.
I:8615;1010;There were some scenes such as as when Grant and the traveler are waiting on the bus to arrive that are just breathtaking.
I:8615;1011;One of C. Grants best movies.
I:8615;1012;Awesome work with adding color to a B&W movie.
I:8615;1013;It is very seamless and beautiful.
I:8615;1014;Like most people that saw this movie in 1959, I loved and saw it several times over the years , placing it in my top 20.
I:8615;1015;I saw it several years ago on VHS and thought, maybe this movie really wasn`t the blockbuster I thought it to be.
I:8615;1016;has always made him a superior director than just about anyone today.
I:8615;1017;and the Bernard Hermann score is heart.
I:8615;1018;one of the best fusions of music to film in the business.
I:8615;1019;The music can make you grip your seat.
I:8615;1020;Hitchcock captures the scene as if the very souls of the Great Presidents were helping Cary Grant in his patriotic mission.
I:8615;1021;It is easy to understand why.
I:8615;1022;"This 1959 Alfred Hitchcock film was the fourth and last ""spy"" film that he did with Cary Grant."
I:8615;1023;BUT, was Bond's film character patterned on this wonderful movie?
I:8615;1024;The resemblance is so great, Thornhill even had a martini!Briefly, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken for a U. s. undercover agent, abducted, framed for murder, nobody believes his story so he's on the run.
I:8615;1025;this movie has so many great scenes.
I:8615;1026;again, Bond) and the great chase around the presidents' faces at Mt. Rushmore.
I:8615;1027;this film also starred James Mason and Martin Landau.
I:8615;1028;this is one cinema masterpiece!
I:8615;1029;Watch and enjoy, especially if you like James Bond films, but remember it's not.
I:8615;1030;This new 50th anniversary restoration on blu.
I:8615;1031;one of the disadvantages of living with a beloved movie for 4 decades, in the movie theater and on home video, is that it becomes so familiar that you know everything by heart and anticipate every next step.
I:8615;1032;The script is brilliant, so, like most Hitchcock, it is enjoyable to watch repeatedly, even if familiar with the story.
I:8615;1033;The great thing with Hitchcock is, that the suspense and excitement of the story have nothing to do with the revelation of a twist.
I:8615;1034;For the first time, the metallic telephones at the lobby of the Plaza Hotel felt appropriately rich, crafted of real metal, befitting the exclusive surroundings.
I:8615;1035;in this (and only this) film, Eva Marie Saint always reminded me of a stunningly beautiful pure.
I:8615;1036;The mask of concealer makeup which Hitchcock placed over her face is still extreme, but no longer opaque enough to cover the freshness and human warmth, sensitivity and vulnerability I normally connect this favorite actress with.
I:8615;1037;It is a revelation to now be able to see the subtle emotions in her face, like in the scene when she sends Cary Grant to the his doom in the crop fields.
I:8615;1038;Her emotional conflict is very moving.
I:8615;1039;Her featherlight hesitant tenderness is appropriate to the story .
I:8615;1040;And maybe it was Cary Grant's own style of touching his partner during romantic moments, because I've seen him do it in other films as well.
I:8615;1041;however, this new transfer with its focus on light and dark, makes this love scene much more intimate, by partially obscuring graphic details, which the previous transfer offered .
I:8615;1042;ray bathes it in shadow.
I:8615;1043;I like the new transfer better, because it makes the scene more convincing and natural, and appropriately ominous.
I:8615;1044;in any case, the sublime music which underscores this scene is the loveliest music I've ever heard in any film, and what the lovers avoid doing, the music does for them: it touches and embraces them (and us) with supreme tenderness and longing.
I:8615;1045;"i very much recommend you watch this classic movie in this stunning new restauration
I:8615;1046;Train rides, plane chase, abductions, mistaken identity .
I:8615;1047;Wanted to be able to watch it whenever I wanted.
I:8615;1048;This is a classic movie, a must see!
I:8615;1049;Enjoy it like I do!
I:8615;1050;It is marvellous that one of Hitchcock's greatest films has been so beautifully remastered.
I:8615;1051;The colour is magnificent and the sound very good.
I:8615;1052;Released in 1959, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is and remains a brilliant piece of filmmaking from Alfred Hitchcock.
I:8615;1053;Interestingly this boxed set (ASIN: B0000683U7) is a wonderful commemorative edition.
I:8615;1054;Bernard Herrmann's magnificent groundbreaking score truly stands out.
I:8615;1055;To watch it again and enjoy like never before is to realize just how entertaining this film is and how it has stood the test of time.
I:8615;1056;Just one of the libations you pick up watching this endearing film.
I:8615;1057;And so the Americans are eager to convince Thornhill to continue the charade, life.
I:8615;1058;Along the way, Thornhill gets involved with the beautiful Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).
I:8615;1059;It is this combination of romance and intrigue that sets the tone for the rest of the movie.
I:8615;1060;Although there is the implied suggestion that the two spend the night together (the trivilization of both casual sex and divorce is a remarkable laxity in morals that was very bold for 1959!)
I:8615;1061;"Thornhill and Kendall's mutual feelings of ""love"" are pure infatuation based on physical attraction at first sight."
I:8615;1062;And they are not the focus of attention, since it is really the suspense of the espionage and intrigue that carries the plot and the drama.
I:8615;1063;of course there are many espionage movies with wonderful suspense.
I:8615;1064;But Hitchcock's 1959 production delivers suspense without extensive violence, profanity and sex.
I:8615;1065;"The focus is on the suspense and intrigue with numerous plot twists, accompanied throughout by wonderfully dry humor (For instance, Thornhill expressing his reluctance to participate in a charade that could threaten his life: ""I have two ex."
I:8615;1066;wives, a mother and several bartenders depending on me!
I:8615;1067;There is beautiful scenery and filming throughout .
I:8615;1068;the memorable cinematography of the crop duster attack and the final chase scenes on the faces at Mount Rushmore is superb!
I:8615;1069;effectively building up suspense and tension all the more.
I:8615;1070;war thrillers go, this is a worthy classic of the genre!
I:8615;1071;Hitchcock serves up delightful humor, spine.
I:8615;1072;tingling suspense, and delightful cinematography, without marring it with much of the moral filth that pollutes contemporary movies.
I:8615;1073;It's one of the master Hitchcock's best, and is certainly worth a look.
I:8615;1074;Good clean exciting fun and action for the whole family.
I:8615;1075;nice twists that keep you guessing.
I:8615;1076;A rollercoaster ride across the landscape of the USA.
I:8615;1077;Thank goodness he went for it!
I:8615;1078;This is his masterwork, (in my opinion one of the top three best films EVER), and for innumerable reasons the end result is just an astonishing accomplishment.
I:8615;1079;Justifiably famous for those two scenes, (and the cropduster sequence is totally thrilling, though I always wondered why the pilot decided to go kamikaze and plough into the petrol tanker!)
I:8615;1080;, it has so much more to recommend it.
I:8615;1081;Grant, present in virtually every scene, is superb, and the Academy should forever hang their heads in shame for ignoring this actor.
I:8615;1082;He is matched, however, by Jessie Royce Landis,(funny already in as much that she was also 54 yet plays his mother!)
I:8615;1083;, who is utterly hilarious in her role.
I:8615;1084;Alfred Hitchcock simply couldnt have paced this film better, and what a wild ride it is, though if forced to pick a favourite moment it would probably be in the auction room.
I:8615;1085;This is simply scintilating entertainment of the very highest order, I defy any reasonably minded person to weary of it, because the second you see the M. g. m. lion in green, and hear Bernard Herrmans brilliant score, you know your in for one of the biggest treats of your life!
I:8615;1086;Yes it really is THAT good, even after a dozen viewings.
I:8615;1087;If you dont own this, you cant be a serious film fan.
I:8615;1088;This is a movie my wife and I love to watch.
I:8615;1089;My wife loves classics (loves TCM) and who doesn't love Cary Grant.
I:8615;1090;This film has great suspense only Hitchcock can produce in a film.
I:8615;1091;For being a movie classic I was expecting the movie to hold up reasonably well.
I:8615;1092;One of my all time favorites.
I:8615;1093;great plot and has a lot of humor.
I:8615;1094;cary Grant is very good with both humor and being serious,Lots of suspense and twist and turns.
I:8615;1095;One if the best movies of all time.
I:8615;1096;Bernard Herrmann's score and Cary Grant's charm/wit combine in an unparalleled entertainment experience.
I:8615;1097;and just enjoy this ride.
I:8615;1098;which allows me to be surprised all over again.
I:8615;1099;casting James Mason and a young but very creepy Martin Landau as the villains was sheer genius.
I:8615;1100;Grant, already in his mid.50s, was obviously meant to be younger (mid.40s at the most), but you'll find yourself suspending disbelief about that and everything else and just allowing yourself to get caught up in this extremely entertaining film.
I:8615;1101;There is no better example of Hitchcock's cinematic mastery.
I:8615;1102;It's as witty as it is adventurous, with a wonderful Ernest Lehman script, excellent cinematography by Robert Burks and a great score by Bernard Herrmann.
I:8615;1103;LOVE my classic Alfred Hitchcock movies.
I:8615;1104;This is probably in my top 3 for Hitchcock films for many reasons.
I:8615;1105;The best that I can think if is that it is perhaps the best example of cinematic drama.
I:8615;1106;For those not familiar with the plot, the story is a gripping mistaken.
I:8615;1107;Thornill eventually finds himself at the center of a complicated espionage plot which takes him across the country, ending with a spectacular climax atop the Mt. Rushmore.
I:8615;1108;what makes this film nearly perfect for me is the way it's paced.
I:8615;1109;It's a study in economy, since we're told very little at the beginning (parallel to Thornhill's ignorance), and more is revealed slowly over time.
I:8615;1110;Hitchcock and screenwriter Ernst Lehman weave a carefully crafted tale, and Hitch's fluid direction is superb as Thornhill is placed in increasingly dangerous situations.
I:8615;1111;Punctuating this danger is Bernard Hermann's tense and frightful score, and the blu.
I:8615;1112;ray audio mix does it justice.
I:8615;1113;the film may very well be Grant's best performance .
I:8615;1114;certainly his best in a Hitchcock film (his 3rd or 4th collaboration w/ Hitchcock, I believe.)
I:8615;1115;(Grant also has the greatest business suit of all time, which somehow survives all his encounters with little more than a dusty lapel.)
I:8615;1116;ray, with very rich colors, nice deep blacks and sharp images.
I:8615;1117;The supplements seem fairly well rounded, but are in standard def.
I:8615;1118;"(Ebert's commentary on ""Citizen Kane"", for instance, is excellent.)"
I:8615;1119;In all, this is an exceptional classic film that deserves to be in any collection, and now in a blu.
I:8615;1120;ray format that doesn't disappoint.
I:8615;1121;What do you get when you combine Cary Grant, Academy Award winner Eva Marie Saint, veteran stage and film actor James Mason and a well.
I:8615;1122;written script with murder, espionage, romance, intrigue and some of the greatest chase scenes in cinema history?
I:8615;1123;Hitchcock was a master at his art, and with this corker of a suspense thriller, it's easy to see why he was named The Master Of Suspense.
I:8615;1124;Martin Landau and Leo G. Carroll also star in this witty cat.
I:8615;1125;Everyone in the cast and crew was wonderful.
I:8615;1126;If you haven't seen either this or any of Hitch's other movies, you're in for a real treat.
I:8615;1127;Vertigo is more emotionally moving, while NxNW is simply more fun.
I:8615;1128;This is the perfect film to show certain members of the younger generation who think the art of movie making began with Star Wars or The Matrix.
I:8615;1129;"are deeper and richer without looking ""colorized."""
I:8615;1130;The image is crisp, the print clean and dazzlingly free of artifacts.
I:8615;1131;as for the extras, the documentary hosted by the timeless Eva Maria Saint is an insightful and entertaining look at the making of the film.
I:8615;1132;"There are two audio supplements: a running commentary by Ernest Lehman which occasionally sags (one wonders why Saint and Martin Landau did not participate)
I:8615;1133;you can watch this track and understand the film just as well as with the dialogue.

I:8615;1141;A little more polished than the others.
I:8615;1142;And that sets the pace for the whole movie.
I:8615;1143;Thornhill is played with panache and great comic touch by Cary Grant.
I:8615;1144;He ended his film career voluntarily, quitting while he was at the top.
I:8615;1145;I found this extra in.

I:8615;1152;A little bit of everything is covered in this extra, from costumes to music, to Hitchcock's preference for cool blonde leading ladies.

I:8615;1154;"William Friedkin, director of ""The Exorcist"" and ""The French Connection""."
I:8615;1155;"Richard Loncraine, director of ""Firewall""."
I:8615;1156;Hitchcock offers his best suspense and Cary Grant, though in his later years, pulls off the suave character for which he is best known.
I:8615;1157;Afterwards, I saw it two times in an English Cinema.
I:8615;1158;At last, I bought the English version and, up to now, I enjoyed this video 5 times.

I:8615;1165;Many of the interesting and unusual sets are explained in the featurette, all of which are well done and are very useful and important to the film's realism, which remains surprisingly intact throughout all the permutations in the plot and scenery.

I:8615;1169;minute featurette, the high point of which is Martin Landau doing an excellent impression of Hitchcock during minute 28 of the 40.
I:8615;1170;northwest is my favorite Hitchcock film.
I:8615;1171;For me, it is the Hitchcock film that stands up best to nearly a half century of repeated viewings.
I:8615;1172;Me and wife found this movie to be more of a comedy than a thriller.
I:8615;1173;It has all of the signature Hitchcock elements like a cameo from himself, a blonde leading lady, fancy camera work and special effects(for the time).
I:8615;1174;Still one of the most thrilling films Hitchcock made.

I:8615;1181;All you need to know is that this is one of the most clever and entertaining films ever made.
I:8615;1182;North by Northwest is a film to be enjoyed over and over again, as is much of Hitchcock's work.

I:8615;1186;All the hallmarks of the great Hitchcock films, with a stellar performance by Cary Grant, and the most sizzling on.
I:8615;1187;NORTH BY NORTHWEST is a brilliant piece of filmmaking from Alfred Hitchcock.
I:8615;1188;The print is brilliantly sharp and colorful.
I:8615;1189;From Suspicious , Catch a thief and obviously this one could not be the exception of the ruleHitchcock always knew to show the other side of the actor , specially if he was a renowned and glamorous star .
I:8615;1190;And the best proof is Charade where Stanley Donnen called again to Grant to make a love affair beneath a soft anguish thriller.
I:8615;1191;in this opportunity , Hitchcock reached a goal employing symbols of power .
I:8615;1192;From Mount Rushmore to the United Nations building , the vertiginous camera movements make of this tongue in cheek spy thriller an outstanding exercise of narrative agility , a bit of fine british humour here and there and very unusual film .
I:8615;1193;have you realized the hidden homage to this film made in From Russian with love in the fumigator airplane chase?The unbridled rhythm , the prodigious musical score of Bernard Hermann and superb locations plus the adequate use of the colour deserved for this washed face cold war film a nomination to Original Script (Ernest Lehman), Set up and Decoration .
I:8615;1194;an original and unforgettable film from the Supreme Suspense Magician.
I:8615;1195;I've seen it half a dozen times and always enjoy it over and over again.
I:8615;1196;Cary Grant is awesome as always.
I:8615;1197;I have seen this movie several times over the years and have enjoyed it each time.
I:8615;1198;It is very Hitchcock like with lotsof exciting suspense.
I:8615;1199;And the digibook format affords the loyal fan and novice viewer alike still more information with which to appreciate the film.
I:8615;1200;But he's a virgin Northwest viewer, so I hope all these parallels won't dissuade him from making his trip.
I:8615;1201;Everyone says this is one of Hitchcock's best.
I:8615;1202;One of the best films by Hitchcock, and one of the most popular films ever, North By Northwest is also one of those rare films that is even loved by people who are normally sticklers for detail.
I:8615;1203;"No matter that most of the incidents, most of the situations, and of course Hitchcock's beloved ""MacGuffin"" plot device do not make sense."
I:8615;1204;Every element, however unbelievable, is so well done and so entertaining that we forgive the nonsense.
I:8615;1205;this is a marvelous film, mixing murder and humor as only Hitchcock could do it.
I:8615;1206;The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is a classic, and fits Hitchcock's implausibly clockwork plot like a glove.
I:8615;1207;"and you should be prepared too, prepared to enjoy a fine evening of entertainment with the Master of Suspense and his talented crew: Cary Grant, Eve Marie Saint, James Mason as Vandamm the spy master, Leo G. Carroll as ""the Professor"" at the CIA, and Martin Landau as a spy henchman."
I:8615;1208;Pure entertainment, and now available in high definition on Blu.
I:8615;1209;The film will reveal them all to you.
I:8615;1210;This is my favorite movie and was looking forward to insights that only a writer could provide.
I:8615;1211;Looking back you can really see how much they have improved the actions scenes.
I:8615;1212;Mr Hitchcock made this film ACCIDENTALLY.
I:8615;1213;All is revealed in the excellent additional material and documentary on the making of the film narrated by Ms Saint.
I:8615;1214;It may be one of those instances of how the artist (Mr Hitchcock) uses the system (Hollywood producers) to get his way, and run way over budget, and still bring home the bacon with a work of cinematic wonder.
I:8615;1215;Of course this movie shows it's age, but it's a great movie.
I:8615;1216;Alfred Hitchcock made many fine movies in his career, but North by Northwest is to me one of his very best.
I:8615;1217;Hitchcock is at the top of his form here not only in direction, casting, and pacing, but also with his classic 'wrong man accused' motif, first seen in The 39 Steps.
I:8615;1218;Here it is played to perfection by Cary Grant, who is magnificent throughout as the man in a situation not of his making.
I:8615;1219;"Eva Marie Saint is also superb here
I:8615;1220;James Mason too plays his archetypical villain character here with great aplomb and style.
I:8615;1221;Martin Landau also comes off very well as his particularly nasty henchman.
I:8615;1222;In the end, all the parts come together to make a truly exciting thriller, well paced, with an iconic conclusion at Mount Rushmore.
I:8615;1223;It is a movie worthy of being watched again now and then as I have over the years.
I:8615;1224;He eventually gets charged with a murder actually committed by one of the real criminals and has to go on the lam.
I:8615;1225;There are slices of Americana that are forever gone such as train travel that are interesting by themselves.
I:8615;1226;and clothing design meshing beautifully, North by Northwest is the most sylish Hitchcock film ever.
I:8615;1227;Great casting and chemistry between players ensure you'll enjoy one of Hitchcock's four masterpieces.
I:8615;1228;Comedic elements, suspense and romance all make for a truly entertaining film.
I:8615;1229;I have always liked this film.
I:8615;1230;Hitchcock's script is deliciously written with Grant's character Roger O. Thornhill being mistaken for an undercover agent named George Kaplan.
I:8615;1231;Jessie Royce Landis role as Grant's mother is lovely and amazing given that she and Grant were about the same age at the time this film was made.
I:8615;1232;I am not sure which scene I find most breathtaking and heart stopping .
I:8615;1233;I confess that I am surprised that the National Parks Service would allow anyone to climb Mount Rushmore, but this scene adds hugely to the suspense.
I:8615;1234;The musical score adds to the atmosphere of the cat and mouse game being played.
I:8615;1235;This film is one of Hitchcock's greatest achievements in movie making.
I:8615;1236;"I have to admit that his ""Rear Window"" is my most favorite of Hitchcock's films, but ""North By Northwest is next in line."
I:8615;1237;Grant manages to inject his own zany humor when he talks about his various ex.
I:8615;1238;The scenes between Grant and Eva Marie Saint on the train are delightful.
I:8615;1239;Warner did an amazing job restoring this film, which looks just as good, if not better, than many modern films on the format.
I:8615;1240;It is perhaps one of the most exciting films ever developed with a brilliant screenplay and a star cast.
I:8615;1241;ray I want to own.
I:8615;1242;The only reason I bought it is because my brother absolutely loves it and has in fact seen more times than I have.
I:8615;1243;I must say if you love suspense if you love spy novels I suggest you pick up this movie and watch it trust me you will definitely like it, I loved every second of it, it's very very good and you will love it.
I:8615;1244;Another Alfred Hitchcock movie that is full of suspense and is well played by some of the old great actors and actresses.
I:8615;1245;Story line is past history but is engaging.
I:8615;1246;Action thriller by the master himself.
I:8615;1247;A good film and a great film.
I:8615;1248;Doreen Lang as Maggie, Grant's cute and long.
I:8615;1249;Hitch loves cars and the juxtapositions of them are fun throughout.
I:8615;1250;Old Westbury looks nice on film.
I:8615;1251;classic double take when Cary Grant appears in her hospital room.
I:8615;1252;this is without any argument or exception one of the top ten films of all time and Hitchcock's best, bar none.
I:8615;1253;This is one of the best Hitchcock films!!!!
I:8615;1254;Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint are superb, the plot is engaging, supporting actors are strong, and there is a touch of comedy along with suspense.
I:8615;1255;But over time it has become highly regarded, and most Hitchcock fans have enjoyed watching it several times over the years.
I:8615;1256;This movie will still be watched and enjoyed a century from now, and probably for several centuries into the future!
I:8615;1257;This movie is a classic.
I:8615;1258;Everyone should see at least once in their lifetime.
I:8615;1259;I became a Hitchcock fan for life.
I:8615;1260;I've never seen a print with this clarity.
I:8615;1261;With a decent player and tv, this is one of the absolute best transfers I have ever seen.
I:8615;1262;This disc is a bargain at twice the price (I got it for $20).
I:8615;1263;This movie defined Hitchcock and Cary Grant as true masters of cinema.
I:8615;1264;The thriller was born with the wide screen shots and the seething undertones in the script.
I:8615;1265;Always a great movie to watch whenever.
I:8615;1266;This film may be a bit complicated to follow at first, but quite simply it's another classic Hitchcock cat.
I:8615;1267;This time it's Cary Grant on the run.
I:8615;1268;The gasping Mount Rushmore finale is unforgettable.
I:8615;1269;There is a good documentary called Destination Hitchcock: The Making of North By Northwest hosted by Eva Marie Saint.
I:8615;1270;Alfred Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance is at the start of this film, so you can sit back and totally relax and enjoy the picture.
I:8615;1271;Still as entertaining ever and even held the full attention of my 9 year old daughter.
I:8615;1272;North by Northwest not only has the best actors starring in the movie, Cary Grant, Eve Marie Saint and James Mason.
I:8615;1273;It also has who might be considered one ofthe greatest film directors ever!
I:8615;1274;Combine a great story these great actors and a world class director and made in 1958 when films were much betterthan 50 years later, and you have a fantastic motion picture.
I:8615;1275;I bought the Blu Ray version and it is worth the extra money.
I:8615;1276;Well worth the time it takes to watch.
I:8615;1277;Seen the movie several time and wanted to own a copy, it's a classic.
I:8615;1278;The storyline, cast, special effects, sets, and scenery are fine but I don't think the movie overall is quite as good as Vertigo.
I:8615;1279;That film I regard as Hitchcock's masterpiece and it wouldn't be right to give North by Northwest the same rating.
I:8615;1280;The scene in the open prairie with a crop duster chasing Cary Grant has to be one of the most memorable and well.
I:8615;1281;done special effects in cinematic history.
I:8615;1282;As with other of Hitchcock's movies, we must learn to suspend logic and plausibility and just enjoy the ride.
I:8615;1283;this is a long movie but worth the time in many ways.
I:8615;1284;I just love the scenes and the acting is the best.
I:8615;1285;Eva Marie Saint is very stunning
I:8615;1286;This is a sexy and romantic film that people get shot and stabbed in.
I:8615;1287;Watch for the director making his sneak appearance.
I:8615;1288;But Cary Grant and Saint are very good.
I:8615;1289;Would highly recommend this movie.
I:8615;1290;And Cary Grant a great actor with James Mason this time as the bad guy.
I:8615;1291;This is a classic Hitchcock film, with excellent acting by Cary Grant and Eva St. Marie.
I:8615;1292;Full of suspense, wit, and drama.
I:8615;1293;What a treasure to find on Amazon's Instant videos!
I:8615;1294;Excellent film, a real old fashioned thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:8615;1295;ray is stunning in its colour and vibrancy.
I:8615;1296;It kept you interested, nice pace it did not need all the special effects that we have come to expect today
I:8615;1297;some thrills, some suspense, some comedy.
I:8615;1298;I't a great movie to see.
I:8615;1299;Cary Grant is a comic genius.
I:8615;1300;The blend of comedy and suspense in this movie makes it one of the best ever.
I:8615;1301;He is perfect and the rest of the cast is excellent.
I:8615;1302;The scene at the bus stop in rural Indiana is one of the best ever filmed.
I:8615;1303;Add to that the excellent score by Bernard Herrmann and you have a classic.
I:8615;1304;I've only seen it a dozen times and I still like it.
I:8615;1305;It is a classic must see before you die movie.
I:8615;1306;NOT true with North by Northwest.
I:8615;1307;If you love this movie, it is worth upgrading to blu.
I:8615;1308;We all know the film is a masterpiece but now, with this new edition, we can watch it in the best possible conditions.
I:8615;1309;Picture and sound have been improved at their best.
I:8615;1310;I will continue to watch when I'm in the mood for a great movie.
I:8615;1311;I've probably seen it 7.8 times and still enjoy this suspenseful thriller that interweaves mistaken identity, cold war villains, secret agents and a dash of romance plus a sprinkle of humor here and there.
I:8615;1312;Gary Grant is at his dashing best.
I:8615;1313;Eva Marie Saint is delicious to watch as her glamorous charmer character takes a few twists along the way.
I:8615;1314;A great chase across the country with an exciting but a bit overdone climatic ending at mount Rushmore.
I:8615;1315;Like all really good movies, the story is solid and the acting is great.
I:8615;1316;Hitchcock, again, uses an innocent and holy image.
I:8615;1317;if you've never seen this movie, it's worth a look.
I:8615;1318;Good stories and good cinema.
I:8615;1319;photography never go out of style and this certainly fits the bill.
I:8615;1320;Grab some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy.
I:8615;1321;This is the top of the essentials list for movie lovers.
I:8615;1322;This is such a good movie with a perfect mix of suspense, mystery, action and even comedy.
I:8615;1323;One of my favorite Cary Grant movies.
I:8615;1324;One of my all time favorite movies.
I:8615;1325;Hitchcock really knows how to create suspense without all of the violence in modern movies.
I:8615;1326;A great classic that is still just as good now as it was when it was first made!
I:8615;1327;A wonderful classic that kept my two teenaged daughters glued to the screen.
I:8615;1328;Probably Eva Marie Saint's best role.
I:8615;1329;This has always been a favorite movie of mine.
I:8615;1330;the movie is witty, suspenseful, and fast paced.
I:8615;1331;Entertaining all the way through.
I:8615;1332;And, there's plenty more to come.
I:8615;1333;Just hang on for what a really great movie should be.
I:8615;1334;For years, this has been one of my favorite films, and it has aged remarkably well in its 50 years.
I:8615;1335;Even the sound has received great improvement.
I:8615;1336;Although most of the sound tends to come from your center speaker, there is now true surround sound, and I have noticed some very well done spatial balancing in my home theater .
I:8615;1337;remarkable considering when the original audio track was laid down and what technology they were using at the time.
I:8615;1338;That it is a classic, modern or not, is beyond question.
I:8615;1339;Visually, cinematically, this is probably the most beautiful of Hitchcock's films.
I:8615;1340;Eva Marie Saint is luminescent in her beauty, touching in fifties makeup and fashions.
I:8615;1341;In this digital version, all the 1950's props look so new!
I:8615;1342;Shiny new 1958 cars, then.
I:8615;1343;This is one of my favorite Hitchcock films.
I:8615;1344;Hitchcock made many excellent movies, but this in my opinion is the best of his work.
I:8615;1345;Colors are really beautiful, and grain is gone.
I:8615;1346;Cary Grant is one my all time favorite, classic movie actors.
I:8615;1347;He is outstanding in this role as a New York ad man with a serious case of mistaken identity which puts him in a variety of interesting locals ending at the Mount Rushmore Monument.
I:8615;1348;Cary Grant is, as usual, wonderful in this role of mistaken identity.
I:8615;1349;The movie is great, the added extras and the bonus book packaging are worth the money alone .
I:8615;1350;Very good, as most other people have said.
I:8615;1351;The class of actors back than far exceeds todays society.
I:8615;1352;I selected this film primarily because Cary Grant played in it.
I:8615;1353;I felt that any film with Grant in it would be worthwhile.
I:8615;1354;The story was both serious and entertaining.
I:8615;1355;stop action and suspense, great sound, and exceptional editing to produce this truly classic film.
I:8615;1356;The acting was also performed well.
I:8615;1357;Cary Grant (Roger O. Thornhill/George Kaplin) played a cool, calm, and collective, yet suave, innocent victim of mistaken identity.
I:8615;1358;His counterpart Eva Marie Saint (Eve Kendall), a great looking blond, performed admirably as a seductress and a spy.
I:8615;1359;Hitchcock did a marvelous job of intertwining action and suspense.
I:8615;1360;A prime example was the scene in which Mr. Thornhill (driving drunk) was being pursued.
I:8615;1361;Another perfect example of weaving action and suspense was during the final scene of the movie.
I:8615;1362;But in the spirit of Hitchcock, to keep you in suspense, I refuse to divulge that information.
I:8615;1363;The use of sound truly enhanced the film.
I:8615;1364;Sometimes it was used to create suspense, as in the aforementioned scenes, while other times used as a mood setter.
I:8615;1365;Hitchcock also used the sound especially well as a transition between scenes.
I:8615;1366;edited film that I have seen.
I:8615;1367;"I said that this was a ""great"" movie not a ""perfect"" movie."
I:8615;1368;Despite these relatively minor flaws, I consider this an excellent film.
I:8615;1369;The story has many twists and turn.
I:8615;1370;besides Cary Grant you will recognize many well known actors.
I:8615;1371;This movie, given three Academy Awards in 1959, was one of the best Hitchcock suspense movies, with great chases and wonderful settings for Cary Grant's spying.
I:8615;1372;besides the fact that it is a great movie, Hitchcock was faced with a difficult decision of choosing Gregory Peck or Cary Grant for the role, and I think he made the right decision, because he had the unique style of choosing.
I:8615;1373;so, I hope you enjoy this all.
I:8615;1374;This is Hitchcock at his most accessible.
I:8615;1375;I think I can finally say for sure it is my favorite movie of all time.
I:8615;1376;This is a great movie.
I:8615;1377;Colorful, gripping entertainment for the whole family, and full of the trademark Master's twists and turns.
I:8615;1378;Eva Marie Saint is alluring as the icy blonde who may or may not be in his corner.
I:8615;1379;But it's James Mason's unnerving performance that stays in your memory.
I:8615;1380;No matter how many I watch this movie I can always enjoy it.
I:8615;1381;There is always something new that catches my eye.
I:8615;1382;Warner Bros. has outdone itself with this new, pull.
I:8615;1383;class presentation of one of Hitch's best films.
I:8615;1384;upped Universal with this terrific effort.
I:8615;1385;This is without question the best this film has ever looked .
I:8615;1386;blacks are velvety and rich, color is deep and vibrant, and edge enhancement (which results in unnatural shimmer ) is seemingly non.
I:8615;1387;All the special features in the world don't make a difference if the print of the movie itself isn't presented in the best way possible.
I:8615;1388;If you're a film fan at all, this classic deserves .
I:8615;1389;Alfred Hitchcock is always a good bet for a fine movie.
I:8615;1390;Plus Cary Grant, sure winner for all.
I:8615;1391;Suspense with great supporting actors.
I:8615;1392;The most approachable of Hitchcock thriller with a most memorable line, Oh Roger, just pay the ticket.
I:8615;1393;Momma's boy and bad boy Roger O. Thornhill with his classic matches marked with R. o. t. is priceless.
I:8615;1394;Cary Grant is great in this movie.
I:8615;1395;it is far better than Psyco.
I:8615;1396;If you love Hitchcock thrillers you will love North by Northwest.
I:8615;1397;It stars Cary Grant who is one of my favourite actors and Eva MarieSaint.
I:8615;1398;"They begin their ""affair"" on a train of all places where Grant does his best to hide fromthe train conductor while still traveling and a really nice conversation over a dinner scene."
I:8615;1399;back in the city he manages to find Eve Kendall again and then resume his adventure,mainly to find out what is going on.
I:8615;1400;This movie is still visualy rich.
I:8615;1401;The story unfolds like a delightful puzzle.
I:8615;1402;The performances, direction, production are superb.
I:8615;1403;The screenwriter portion is especially rich.
I:8615;1404;This is a classic in every since of the word.
I:8615;1405;The story is great, with Grant playing an average businessman who is thrust into an adventure he wants no part of.
I:8615;1406;There is lots of action ending with the famous confrontation on the faces of Mount.
I:8615;1407;Great performances by Cary Grant, James Mason, Martin Landau, Eva Marie Saint and Jessie Royce Landis make this movie one of my favorites.
I:8615;1408;it is a movie movie .
I:8615;1409;big, brassy, and typifying America's bigness and boldness.
I:8615;1410;It also makes so much of its political time, with resonances beyond the 1950s.
I:8615;1411;i remember seeing a screening of this at a theatre in downtown Chicago in 1974.
I:8615;1412;The 1974 Chicago audience cheered out loud.
I:8615;1413;What counts is interpersonal relationships and, most of all, trust between people.
I:8615;1414;airplane sequence is cool, too.
I:8615;1415;I love great old movies.
I:8615;1416;I loved all of Alfred Hitchcock's movies and this is one of my favorites.
I:8615;1417;Film classic w/great cast and solid plot.
I:8615;1418;Worth seeing more than once.
I:8615;1419;I always enjoy the classics, they rely on special effects to tell a story.
I:8615;1420;Great film that holds up over time.
I:8615;1421;He's at his dapper, witty best (wish I could keep a suit looking that good for that long!)
I:8615;1422;He also holds on for dear life from the facial features of the Presidents on Mounth Rushmore (backlot sets were used ) But dont expect the master of suspense to leav star of audience hanging .
I:8615;1423;A superb movie that take you thru America of 1959 , beautiful locations .
I:8615;1424;i would rank North By Northwest (1959) as one of the great movies from Alfred Hitchcock's prime, which, in my opinion, was the period from 1951.1964.
I:8615;1425;Cary Grant gives a great performance in the role of Roger Thornhill, the innocent man being mistaken for somebody else.
I:8615;1426;Mason was always great playing villains (think Salem's Lot 1979).
I:8615;1427;hitchcock always liked to use good looking blonde women in his movies.
I:8615;1428;Eva Marie Saint fits this mold perfectly.
I:8615;1429;Her acting and screen presence are good in the role of Eve Kendall, a counterspy who is working with the agents, but assists Thornhill by hiding him in her cabin on a train heading for Chicago.
I:8615;1430;the opening credit sequence is a classic.
I:8615;1431;The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is excellent and matches up well with the action on the screen.
I:8615;1432;The movie has a lot of action.
I:8615;1433;The movie of course has a lot of suspense (as you would expect from Hitchcock).
I:8615;1434;Disc 2 contains over three hours of extras, including documentaries on Cary Grant, Alfred Hitchcock's style of movie making and directing, the movie's iconic status, and the making of the movie.
I:8615;1435;overall, this is one of the best Hitchcock movies ever and I highly recommend it.
I:8615;1436;I see no cause to add to the chorus of praise for the film itself, which is one of the most enjoyable films ever made.
I:8615;1437;It has a rich, cinematic appearance.
I:8615;1438;full of deep, velvety blues.
I:8615;1439;ray renders his stirring music gorgeously.
I:8615;1440;Truly a magnificent presentation of a wonderful film.
I:8615;1441;Too often is the English director Alfred Hitchcock compared to French director Henri Clouzot.
I:8615;1442;North by Northwest might be the wildest, biggest, and most American film Hitchcock ever did.
I:8615;1443;Carey Grant's undeniable snark and charm elevate the story and heighten the suspense.
I:8615;1444;James Mason's oiliness is perfect and Eva Marie Saint is lovely and strong as the woman you're never sure you can trust.
I:8615;1445;"In many ways ""North by Northwest"" is more of a James Bond action flick than a classic Hitchcock mystery/suspense."
I:8615;1446;I am happy to say that I loved this movie and am Glad I bought it.
I:8615;1447;Like Hitchcock, a good plot, nice acting?
I:8615;1448;One of the trailers, featuring Hitchcock selling you a vacation plan, is gorgeous.
I:8615;1449;I was so pleased to see they acknowledged the anniversary by re.
I:8615;1450;Some of the scenes are so amazing by his direction.
I:8615;1451;The chase in the corn field, the night shots on Mt. Rushmore are so artistically advanced for it's time.
I:8615;1452;This is one of Hitchcock's best movies.
I:8615;1453;Hospital patient who tries to stop Roger ThornhillA good cast, with veteran actors and a compelling story.
I:8615;1454;there are some good twists in the plot, and some great shots of South Dakota's famous monument, carved out of Mount Rushmore by Gutzon Borglund with dynamite.
I:8615;1455;Eva Marie Saint provides a good love interest.
I:8615;1456;a very entertaining film about cold war spies, well acted, plotted, and directed.
I:8615;1457;Most critics and film fans refer to the Master's Family Plot as his delicious souffle or delightful dessert or some such metaphor.
I:8615;1458;Actually, it is North by Northwest that deserves such a playful description, as IT is the film that much more successfully fulfills the idea of a cinematic fabulous treat.
I:8615;1459;In other words, North by Northwest is about to begin and it's something to get excited about!
I:8615;1460;Granted I am a huge fan of both Alfred Hitchcock and Carey Grant, but .
I:8615;1461;this is hands down in my opinion, is their best work .
I:8615;1462;This WAS worth the wait .
I:8615;1463;Eva Marie Saint is also VERY easy on the eyes .
I:8615;1464;Overall an excellent movie my highest recommendation, the extras and the included book casing is also full of interesting facts and information .
I:8615;1465;Cary Grant was very effective in keeping it believable.
I:8615;1466;Alfred Hitchcock was at his best when this came out.
I:8615;1467;I was fortunate to have studied this movie in detail during a college film class, and 20 years later, it remains my favorite all time Alfred Hitchcock flick (and the master justifies many of my favorites over time.)
I:8615;1468;Very few films are able to retain the one.
I:8615;1469;two punch of being classics within a genre and remain remarkably fresh, accessible and fun (yes, even fun!)
I:8615;1470;Cary Grant is amazing throughout as the executive mistaken for someone else by both criminals and the authorities.
I:8615;1471;Few of his contemporaries (or even actors since Grant's glory days) ever mastered the dual qualities of being both manly and approachable which Grant offers in spades.
I:8615;1472;He is the everyday simple man, on the order of a James Stewart, and yet, a leading man matinee idol that has charmed viewers for decades.
I:8615;1473;He lures you with his affect, but never in a way that feels tired or condescending, always with good nature and a crooked eyebrow that knows more about life than most full fledged characters ever placed on screen.
I:8615;1474;the movie moves from New York through the Heartland, to fields of corn, to a climax that is visually and emotionally stunning.
I:8615;1475;The supporting characters all lend crediblity to the zig zag tale that rarely allows the viewer to catch his or her breath.
I:8615;1476;Eva Marie Saint and James Mason are especially delicious, and the viewer is forced repeatedly to question whether they are good guys, bad guys or neither, which only adds to the fun.
I:8615;1477;great actors and filmmaking aside, what makes North By Northwest especially important in today's world are its still.
I:8615;1478;vital themes and how these relate to the ever.
I:8615;1479;Grant's character is literally hounded by both good and evil, but retains intact his inner virtues, and knows deep inside where he stands, like our Muslim and Arab countrymen, and most of the world's human population.
I:8615;1480;in addition, Grant's everyman could be any one of us which adds to the suspense and allows us to feel a bond with this character that is rare among Hitchcock leads.
I:8615;1481;Again, knowing this only makes the film more impoactful and adds to its universality today.
I:8615;1482;They represent all that is good in America, and applaud the democracy that has led the world for centuries to new, unparalleled glories.
I:8615;1483;I hate to read into this, but Hitchcock speaks volumes in this film about the nature of our culture, the values that sustain and inspire us, as well as the forces that would prefer to see us destroyed.
I:8615;1484;You can escape with this movie, but realize that, more today than ever the film generates a passion and vision that is more real, more intense and far more frieghtening than ever before.
I:8615;1485;Justice prevails, as it always does, yet Hitchcock makes the viewer go through hell first!
I:8615;1486;A joyous, supreme example of filmmaking that is unparalleled both in its cinematic achievment as well as its topicality.
I:8615;1487;Thought it was a great film with lots of suspense, great acting, tremendous excitement and lots of fun.
I:8615;1488;Thought Cary grant is still a legend still to be matched.
I:8615;1489;one of hitchcock's best movies, this really introduced me to cary grant and solidified hitchcock's work for me.
I:8615;1490;hitchcock came out of the 40s (all those collaborations with selznick were HORRIBLE) with a bang and this excellent thriller segued movies into the 60's.
I:8615;1491;a very 60's feel with amazing script, acting (i thought cary grant was going to be a priss until i saw this, now i'm a true fan), direction, cinematography, editing.
I:8615;1492;the only complaint is overlength, but it actually works to its advantage since the movie is so involving!!
I:8615;1493;I would recommend this anniversary video from Amazon.
I:8615;1494;It is a true Hitchcock classic.
I:8615;1495;i had not seen the movie for many years and found that the story still intriguing.
I:8615;1496;The dialogue is great, and Hitchcock uses humor to break up the seriousness of the film, while building up suspense.
I:8615;1497;Wonderful acting and good story.
I:8615;1498;Liked the humorous thread in the dialogue.
I:8615;1499;Minimal costuming which enhanced the story.
I:8615;1500;Would recommend and watch this over again.
I:8615;1501;Years ago I owned the full screen version of this movie on laserdisc.
I:8615;1502;I have never seen this on another movie, usually you see all the extra pans necessary to keep the action on the screen.
I:8615;1503;This is one of the best spy flicks of all time.
I:8615;1504;Just to watch the airplane scene is worth it all.
I:8615;1505;top dialogue in the train love scenes.
I:8615;1506;making as a true art.
I:8615;1507;North by Northwest is one of Hitchcock's masterpieces.
I:8615;1508;Great classic Hitchcock movie which looks amazing in Blu.
I:8615;1509;"We definitely recommend this movie along with ""To Catch a Thief"" which is equally great."
I:8615;1510;They just don't make movies today with the vivid color and fluid plots as the Hitchcock classics.
I:8615;1511;A classic Hitchcock thriller, great scenery all across the country.
I:8615;1512;from the North Shore of Long Island (Old Westbury Gardens) to a faux Frank Lloyd Wright house above Mt. Rushmore, this movie is fast paced and compelling.
I:8615;1513;1st saw approx 5 yrs ago, and yeah, it was ok.
I:8615;1514;Everything about this film clicks: writing, directing, acting, cinematography, scoring, and the sheer class of it all.
I:8615;1515;spotlight on Cary Grant, and 60 min.
I:8615;1516;"on A. h. himself (""the master's touch"")."
I:8615;1517;All in all, a superb set.
I:8615;1518;When I ask information about older movies to older people they seem to loose focus, their eyes become lost in the far horizon, and they say Yes, this is a great movie .
I:8615;1519;First of all, it is listed number 18 on imdb's top 250 films of all time.
I:8615;1520;Second, I have watched the more famous Hitchcock movies, like Rear window , Psycho , Vertigo , etc, and I find Hitchcock an amazing director.
I:8615;1521;His techniques, his directing style, are very similar to what we see in movies today, to what I'm used to expect in a movie.
I:8615;1522;During all the movie, he has to escape his nemesis, in famous and unforgettable scenes like the plane.
I:8615;1523;When there is no action scene, there is the BEST dialogue I've ever seen on screen (very funny, fast and intelligent), between (mostly) Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint, the beautiful double.
I:8615;1524;this is really one of the most enterteining movies I've ever seen.
I:8615;1525;People used to make good movies, and they're still making it today.
I:8615;1526;This is one of my favorate movies!
I:8615;1527;Cary Grant is classic in his part as a man who has been a victim of mistaken identity.
I:8615;1528;The movie also gives you a nostalgic look into the late 1950's to the early 1960's.
I:8615;1529;I bought three brand new copies that all had defects in the same places!
I:8615;1530;This is one of my all time favorite movies, and the Blu.
I:8615;1531;No one could care less about some playboy ad executive in New York, but let him experience something unusual at the same time the audience does, it draws you into the picture and makes it personal.
I:8615;1532;This is what makes this movie so good.
I:8615;1533;It makes you believe it could happen to you.
I:8615;1534;It kept my attention enough though that I finished watching it.
I:8615;1535;His movies are always great and this is no exception.
I:8615;1536;it's hard imagining this great entertainment ever being topped within that genre.
I:8615;1537;For a romantic crime caper it's certainly ambitious: nothing less than the United Nations building, the vast terrain of the Midwest, and Mount Rushmore will do.
I:8615;1538;That may say something about America's state of mind in the late 1950's (literally, The Sky's The Limit), but it says even more about Hitchcock's willingness to pave well.
I:8615;1539;Speaking of Grant, this may be his best performance.
I:8615;1540;He's so urbane and self.
I:8615;1541;But perhaps the movie's biggest revelation is Eva Marie Saint, shockingly icy as Grant's love interest.
I:8615;1542;"Hitchcock remade forever the woman who was Brando's dishrag in *On The Waterfront*
I:8615;1543;she simply despised him, but in fact, her son was a quite successful and respectful person in the society.
I:8615;1544;in that era, most of the popular movies were all like this one, mixed with romance, suspensful twists of the scenario, actions, thugs, beautiful and mysterious women, almsot non.
I:8615;1545;The movie is pure magic.
I:8615;1546;Easy to see why this is a classic.
I:8615;1547;The booklet inside has very valuable additional info about the film.
I:8615;1548;It's also a very good escapist experience .
I:8615;1549;There is a love between Roger and Eve.
I:8615;1550;but the most exciting scene is the last part.
I:8615;1551;Therefor, I think that the best part of this movie is the last part.
I:8615;1552;I always liked Hitchcock's older stuff, before he got obsessed with violence.
I:8615;1553;The whole mix up starts with the arrival of a telegram, but the movie holds up well.
I:8615;1554;I am young, but a huge Cary Grant fan.
I:8615;1555;love his expressions and physicality.
I:8615;1556;This is where new movies got all the goods from.
I:8615;1557;Cary Grant at his most debonair, Hitchcock at his best.
I:8615;1558;Two of Hollywood's best combine to bring us pure magic.
I:8615;1559;No matter how many times i have watched this film I still enjoy it.
I:8615;1560;Now I own it and can watch it at my leisure.
I:8615;1561;"One of the most interesting elements I found in ""North by Northwest"" was the way that Alfred Hitchcock toyed with the audience with the role of Eve Kendall."
I:8615;1562;I have found that the crucial weakness of many movies of the 1950's and 60's is the fact that the strong woman must be punished for her independent instincts.
I:8615;1563;In fact, this could easily be argued of many films today.
I:8615;1564;A strong leading female character is just as rare in Hollywood today as it was fifty years ago.
I:8615;1565;one of the many things that I found intriguing by the character of Eve Kendall was her ability to show empathy while, as the same time, staying true to herself.
I:8615;1566;For example, take a look at the scene in which Roger Thornhill tells Eve, in a heartbreakingly real speech, just how much her deception has betrayed him.
I:8615;1567;Maybe it's a sign of great acting or exceptional directing (the close up shot of her just as he leaves is incredible) but, either way, this is a character that we rarely see in movies today.
I:8615;1568;If Roger is unsure and wary about sex, Eve knows exactly what she wants and what she shall get.
I:8615;1569;"In this aspect alone, ""North by Northwest"" was a movie years ahead of its time."
I:8615;1570;As a fanatical Hitchcock fan, I loved North by Northwest.
I:8615;1571;There is always something you see that you didn't the time before.
I:8615;1572;The viewer is lead through this movie with action, suspense and intrique, not sex, drugs and murder.
I:8615;1573;love this 50ies movie especially the scene of them climbing down the faces on Mt. Rushmore!
I:8615;1574;North by Northwest is a timeless classic.
I:8615;1575;this is in my opinion one of the best Cary Grant, movies and the fact that it was directed by Alfred Hichcock, only makes it better.
I:8615;1576;"ray 50th Anniversary Edition"", is well worth it's price."
I:8615;1577;the book form it comes in makes it an even more pleasant surprise, with the behind the scenes photo's of the cast between takes and the information it gives you in the book.
I:8615;1578;this is a true Movie Buff's must have in their library.
I:8615;1579;This is my husbands favorite movie.
I:8615;1580;He loved it and we all enjoyed watching it again.
I:8615;1581;There is nothing better than vintage Hitchcock with Cary Grant.
I:8615;1582;His comic timing and delivery is absolutely the best.
I:8615;1583;It was one of the best movies I have bought so far.
I:8615;1584;"Without question, 1959's ""North by Northwest"" is one of the greatest films from one of the great directors and maybe THE greatest director."
I:8615;1585;"A favorite plotline of Hitchcock involves the ""Wrong Man"" falsely accused of crimes he did not commit."
I:8615;1586;James Mason is excellent as the suave villain and fine support comes from Harvey and Carroll.
I:8615;1587;The story moves at a very brisk pace and there are some justifyably famous scenes in the movie.
I:8615;1588;the really impressive thing is that you can watch the movie over and over and still be fascinated by the story, the scenes, the perforamnces and the direction.
I:8615;1589;A great director in his prime and an all time great movie.
I:8615;1590;One of the best movies of all time that has withstood the test of time.
I:8615;1591;Cary Grant was a movie star in the grand tradition of class, style, and panache.
I:8615;1592;North by Northwest is one of my favorite movies and I bought this because I thought my husband would like it(and he did).
I:8615;1593;This is a story that holds your interest from start to finish.
I:8615;1594;Particularly great are scenes on the Illinois prairie and at Mount Rushmore.
I:8615;1595;This film improves through multiple viewings.
I:8615;1596;This seems impossible, because it makes such an excellent first impression.
I:8615;1597;Because there are so many good things to say about the film, I'll narrow the list.
I:8615;1598;We are left to discover how clever the character really can be, as well as how well Grant could really act.
I:8615;1599;there are moments when he evokes genuine feelings.
I:8615;1600;It is amazing to watch this film create and maintain this kind of tension.
I:8615;1601;aside from excellent performances from a skilled cast, the film also presents an example of Hitchcock at some of his best: using innovative camera.
I:8615;1602;this is an accomplished action film .
I:8615;1603;I saw this movie when i was a kid and it still holds up.
I:8615;1604;Keeps your attention and has one of the most sensual scenes you'll ever see .
I:8615;1605;Just proves what a master film maker with good talent can do.
I:8615;1606;Also has the famous crop duster chase in the corn field.
I:8615;1607;identity thriller with unforgettable, and original scenes.
I:8615;1608;dusting plane to the faces of Mount Rushmore, Hitchcock created a timeless classic.
I:8615;1609;Grant and Novak are superb in their acting here.
I:8615;1610;I love garey grant in this movie.
I:8615;1611;It is a grea tmovie that holds you rattention and directed by alrfred hitchkock
I:8615;1612;One of my favorite Hitchcock films and Gary Grant at his finest.
I:8615;1613;Only time I have ever seen Eve St. Marie play the part of a seductress and she is impeccable.
I:8615;1614;I've always loved Alfred Hitchcock movies, and this is one of his best.
I:8615;1615;It was great watching it again with my wife and 15 year old son and daughter.
I:8615;1616;They appreciated the great plot, directing, and the fact that a superb movie can be made without explicit adult themes, crude language, and special effects.
I:8615;1617;Love Cary and this is truly one of his best!!
I:8615;1618;I have seen this movie more times than I care to count and each time is as good as the last
I:8615;1619;A great classic then, and now.
I:8615;1620;Action packed with turns, twists, suspense and humor.
I:8615;1621;Everyone should see this landmark film.
I:8615;1622;This is a great Hitchcock film and probably my favorite Cary Grant flick.
I:8615;1623;A real cat and mouse type action through out the movie.
I:8615;1624;This is a movie I have seen at least 5 times.
I:8615;1625;it is one of the best Hitchcock movies !
I:8615;1626;Many innovative camera angles for when the film was made.
I:8615;1627;This is one of the best Hitchcock films next to Psycho.
I:8615;1628;This film stars, Cary Grant as Roger, an ad salesman who is mistaken for a spy, by the name of George Kaplan.
I:8615;1629;Should he help Eve when Vandamme finds out who she is truly working for.
I:8615;1630;This movie is great you do not have to be a Hitchcock fan to love this one.
I:8615;1631;It keeps you glued from the beginning to the ending.
I:8615;1632;This is one of my favorite Hitchcock movies!
I:8615;1633;I love intense, suspenseful movies that also have humor throughout.
I:8615;1634;Excellent movie , full of intrigue and suspense.
I:8615;1635;Alfred Hitchcock's 1959 thriller was such a one.
I:8615;1636;dance music usually performed by guitars and castanets.
I:8615;1637;nowadays, I have two recordings of Herrmann's fantastic score, including an original soundtrack recording, and now the Blu.
I:8615;1638;ray edition of this movie.
I:8615;1639;ray edition on my big new TV screen was a riveting experience.
I:8615;1640;Not like watching the movie on TV or in an old print at a theater that shows classic movies.
I:8615;1641;ray is to see the movie more clearly than we could ever see it at home before.
I:8615;1642;This Hitchcock movie along with Vertigo rank as two of his best.
I:8615;1643;The film score of Bernard Herrmann is excellent as well (as in Vertigo).
I:8615;1644;North by Northwest is nothing short of outstanding, with the best work of this storied director.
I:8615;1645;"Highly recommended
I:8615;1646;Movie buffs look for attractive leading ladies, handsome gentlemen, unpredictable suspense, or witty humor.
I:8615;1647;Fortunately the government is well aware of the facts.
I:8615;1648;well I am a huge fan of cary grant , the man is my 007 lol ,sexy , sexy sexy .
I:8615;1649;ok but the movie was great lots of mystery and suspense
I:8615;1650;This is another great thriller with a wonderfully great cast.
I:8615;1651;AND a director with great writers.
I:8615;1652;I highly recommend it if you've never seen it.
I:8615;1653;"It is a class ""Hitchcock"" that is one of my favs!The book is a great collector's item, and the disc was in good condition."
I:8615;1654;A very nice picture compared to when I first saw this movie way back when on a VHS tape.
I:8615;1655;Good show and it was fun to see again.
I:8615;1656;Cary Grant is always great.
I:8615;1657;Everything was fine with the order and the disc.
I:8615;1658;Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock team for one of their best.
I:8615;1659;Grant's most economically successful film, according to some reports.
I:8615;1660;This movie has everything suspence, romance, action and great music and suprises via Hitchcock.
I:8615;1661;The cornfield scene was great.
I:8615;1662;Hitchcock couldn't have done it any better than he did in this one, North By Northwest is another must see movie!
I:8615;1663;Really enjoyed watching this movie and my 16 yo did too.
I:8615;1664;Kept us pinned to our seats the whole time
I:8615;1665;one of the best films ever made has comedy, romance, suspense thriller and great actors who knew how to act
I:8615;1666;This was preceded with the sexy, scary.
I:8615;1667;the remarkable thing about Hitchcock is his relentless presentation of the average guy caught in events way, way over his head.
I:8615;1668;Brilliant Director, really, never to be replaced.
I:8615;1669;It is much brighter (maybe even a bit too much so), but the color palette is definitely much, much warmer in every scene.
I:8615;1670;Just look at Cary Grant's famous tan.
I:8615;1671;ray exhibits the hues that Hitchcock wanted.
I:8615;1672;Better luck next time, Warner.
I:8615;1673;It is a very good movie and it's clean without any smut!
I:8615;1674;Great actors and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:8615;1675;They are truly the best!
I:8615;1676;I love Hitchcock and this is one of my favorites, though not my all time.
I:8615;1677;I would recommend it to anyone who's interested in trying out a Hitchcock film for the first time.
I:8615;1678;Cary Grant is a great character in this suspense.
I:8615;1679;filled thriller.you will gasp more than once.
I:8615;1680;"Without a shadow of a doubt ""North by Northwest"" is the most interesting film I have ever tried to figure out."
I:8615;1681;So many things come together in an irrational way, yet are so believable.
I:8615;1682;top shelf actors, Alfred Hitchcock in his prime, and the DRIVING music of Bernard Hermann combine with this mysterious story line that could have been thrown together by no one but Alfred Hitchcock.
I:8615;1683;This film represents the magic of Hollywood and of the craft and art of film making.
I:8615;1684;I have to watch it every few years to appreciate the genius of Hitchcock.
I:8615;1685;People feel the need to qualify their love of this movie.
I:8615;1686;It is very entertaining, I hear.
I:8615;1687;Or someone will say, North by Northwest is one Hitchcock's greatest light films.
I:8615;1688;North by Northwest is simply one of the greatest films ever made, period.
I:8615;1689;Saint is the mysterious blonde who helps along the way.
I:8615;1690;The suspense (which is greatly enhanced in widescreen) is near maddening, and the heat and warmth of pure passion (yes, heat AND warmth) is an even more exhausting rollercoaster ride than the usual thrills.
I:8615;1691;It is worth pointing out, however, that for all the attention garnished on the more famous cropdusting / Mount Rushmore scenes, the best moments here may well be at the auction toward the end of the film.
I:8615;1692;Danger, both of life and of the heart, is extremely palpable here, slithering down your neck, oozing down your spine, and twisting over to smother your heart, and Hitch still manages to sneak in some of his best laughs at the very same time!
I:8615;1693;"hitchcock didn't try to delve into warped psyches in this film (a la Vertigo) or make any sort of political statement (a la Foreign Correspondent)
I:8615;1694;he wound up making the best one ever, and one of the five or ten best films of all time.
I:8615;1695;Great acting, humor, story, and locations.
I:8615;1696;Hitchcockian subtlety is at its best here.
I:8615;1697;I love Alfred Hitchcock mysteries.
I:8615;1698;Cary grant is superb in this role.
I:8615;1699;The plot has you at the edge of your seat.
I:8615;1700;I first saw North by Northwest about three years ago, and I immediately put it among my top 50 favorites of all time.
I:8615;1701;For the price it's worth the anniversary edition.
I:8615;1702;This is what gripping dramas used to be.
I:8615;1703;i could watch this 100 times and still love it.
I:8615;1704;Classic movies such as I am, you will enjoy this movie.
I:8615;1705;I honestly wish the charm of these classics would return to our movie theaters.
I:8615;1706;With brilliant music, acting, cinematography and suspense built into a first.
I:8615;1707;A fantastic, cream of the crop, murder/mystery thriller, which combines the outstanding acting talents of Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint, the brilliant, script, written by Ernest Lehman, and the excellent directorial skills of Alfred Hitchcock into a classic, one of a kind movie, that has never again been duplicated by Hollywood.
I:8615;1708;in addition to the movie, the special features, in this, 50th Anniversary, 2.
I:8615;1709;a notable, profile of Cary Grant, 2.)
I:8615;1710;a really, cool, documentary, which examines Alfred Hitchcock's ingenious, ability to captivate an audience for the sole purpose of presenting a visually, engrossing, story, on.
I:8615;1711;Nominated for several Academy Awards, this 1959 film by Alfred Hitchcock lives in my memory because of several memorable scenes.
I:8615;1712;I remember Cary Grant being suave.
I:8615;1713;It's time to take another look at this classic.
I:8615;1714;well, Cary Grant is still suave.
I:8615;1715;Eva Marie Saint is still beautiful.
I:8615;1716;The two memorable scenes are still tense with action.
I:8615;1717;And the Hitchcock style of suspense is there too.
I:8615;1718;The film is a classic and will remain so no matter what I say.
I:8615;1719;And memories of those several scenes will live long into the future.
I:8615;1720;I want to care about the characters.
I:8615;1721;I want to believe that the action they are going through is possible.
I:8615;1722;I feel this about films of today.
I:8615;1723;tech aficionados will enjoy this flick as a great achievement for Hitchcock given the era he worked in.
I:8615;1724;I can appreciate it for its historical significance, but certainly not for anything else.
I:8615;1725;Wonderful dialogue as Thornhill and Van Dam face off in a well.
I:8615;1726;but along the way, Thornhill does meet up with a surprisingly sexy Eva Marie Saint playing Eve Kendall, and he faces danger both in a cornfield and on Mount Rushmore before everything gets sorted out.
I:8615;1727;a testament to his acrobat youth, no doubt.
I:8615;1728;James Mason is always a delight to listen to, and Eva Marie Saint turns the voltage on high while being oh so subtle.
I:8615;1729;but the acting and scenes are fresh and stunning.
I:8615;1730;it's pretty sexual for a film of its time .
I:8615;1731;dusting scene is famous and much.
I:8615;1732;copied, as are several other scenes.
I:8615;1733;It's the interpersonal relationships where this movie shines, though.
I:8615;1734;It's a movie that you'll find something new in each time you watch it.
I:8615;1735;A classic Hitchcock movie worth watching many times.
I:8615;1736;This movie is frightfully good because it captures you into it.
I:8615;1737;This happens with a good director, its like with a good book you don't want to put down.
I:8615;1738;The movie is engrossing, even when you know the answers to questions you still get caught up in the mystery and allure of the film.
I:8615;1739;The acting flows with the style of the film.
I:8615;1740;The two actors fit well with the overall mood of the picture.
I:8615;1741;It is a classic and provides adventure in a clever and stylish way.
I:8615;1742;The films color is also top notch!
I:8615;1743;Don't miss this great movie!Lisa Nary
I:8615;1744;One of the best Alfred Hitchcock films!
I:8615;1745;Suspenseful, action packed with lots of plot twists.
I:8615;1746;Great family movie with a pg rating
I:8615;1747;This is a model for what blu.
I:8615;1748;ray transfers should look like.
I:8615;1749;I particularly enjoyed the scenes at Mount Rushmore.
I:8615;1750;I would recommend this movie to others.
I:8615;1751;This movie is classic Carey Grant with the Hitchcock twist this is a film where the casting director and Alfred collaborated to make it fit like a glove
I:8615;1752;The scenes in the railway car with Eva Marie Saint and Cary are sexy and totally clever.
I:8615;1753;He was such an inventive director.
I:8615;1754;It has been 20 years since I have seen this movie and when I found it, I was extremely excited.
I:8615;1755;This is another file that has a feel of timelessness.
I:8615;1756;Alfred knew how to string a suspense moment into three minutes.
I:8615;1757;suspense to the very end.
I:8615;1758;more twists and turns than the Monte Carlo grand prix.
I:8615;1759;The storyline is super interesting, the acting is top notch, the music score is great, and the cinematography outstanding.
I:8615;1760;"The suspense is palpable, and there is also just enough humor to please the senses (Hitchcocks most enjoyable movies use this formula, starting with ""The 39 Steps"" in the 1930s, in my opinion)."
I:8615;1761;"I don't know about you, but I find no fun in his movies ""The Birds"", ""Strangers on a Train"", ""Psycho"", ""Vertigo"" and some of his other so. called ""Hitchcockian thrillers""."
I:8615;1762;I wont go so far as to say that North By Northwest is Alfred Hitchcock's best film.
I:8615;1763;Many,myself included, think that honor belongs to Vertigo.
I:8615;1764;Along the way you get action,suspense,mystery,humor,romance,and some unforgetable dialogue.
I:8615;1765;There are two features on the movie itself and one each on Cary Grant and Hitchcock.
I:8615;1766;I enjoyed them all,and learned a few things that I didn't know before.
I:8615;1767;This is one of my all time favorites.
I:8615;1768;I received in as soon as it was released and in excellent condition.
I:8615;1769;well done, a must have for a classic movie buff.
I:8615;1770;It's a longer film, but worth the time.
I:8615;1771;I am huge Alfred Hitchcock fan!
I:8615;1772;I have a little collection going and added this one to it.
I:8615;1773;This movie was on sale and at a great price.
I:8615;1774;I didn't know where this one was taking me, but I loved the entire trip!
I:8615;1775;If you like old mysteries, this is a must.
I:8615;1776;Cary Grant was always great.
I:8615;1777;looking and charming, a treat to watch even if he had been reading a cookbook to his audience.
I:8615;1778;This movie keeps the viewer in suspense from the very beginning.
I:8615;1779;It was great to watch this movie without having to wait through commercials.
I:8615;1780;They just ruin the suspense, which this movie really builds on.
I:8615;1781;watch this captivating classic, worth watching every so often, and for free with my Prime membership.
I:8615;1782;This has been one of my favorite movies for a long time!!
I:8615;1783;I wish we had a Cary Grant clone in this life.
I:8615;1784;The highlight of his week is the play he will be attending with his mother.
I:8615;1785;It is there he meets Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), a beautiful woman with a secret of her own.
I:8615;1786;this is my fourth Hitchcock film, and the first one I enjoyed.
I:8615;1787;Yet is also has some very witty banter and a great romance between the two leads.
I:8615;1788;The acting is superb, easily drawing me into the story.
I:8615;1789;But I still found my mind starting to wander.
I:8615;1790;it's a brilliant touch, because combined with Bernard Herrmann's staccato score it ratchets up the tension and also subliminally suggests to the viewer that some poor John Doe is about to get rightly and royally screwed by big business and big Government .
I:8615;1791;well this BLU RAY is better .
I:8615;1792;Previously seen, but superlative feature.
I:8615;1793;Internet link to Warner BrothersA whole bunch of things combine to make NBN work .
I:8615;1794;a great story by Ernest Lehman, superb night and day locations, immaculate period clothes, the bulbous gas.
I:8615;1795;And to top all of that, you get genuine old.
I:8615;1796;school Hollywood star power in the form of James Mason, Martin Landau, Leo Carroll and the luminous love interest Eva Marie Saint.
I:8615;1797;And of course the effortlessly suave and charming Cary Grant .
I:8615;1798;arguably the best leading man Tinseltown ever produced.
I:8615;1799;and you're on a winner.
I:8615;1800;but your eyes keep coming back to how this BLU RAY shines.
I:8615;1801;There are so many little scenes that now look sumptuous .
I:8615;1802;I could go on!If I was to point out one genuine downside, it's the focus.
I:8615;1803;like shine around them (soft focus to make them look better) and can at times make the print look just a teeny bit soft, but other than that the whole shebang is a joy to behold.
I:8615;1804;North By Northwest is a triumph on BLU RAY.
I:8615;1805;And the superb additional extras only make you feel that Warners are to be praised for a job well done.
I:8615;1806;One of Hitchcock's most entertaining movies has been restored to the way it must have looked when it was originally released.
I:8615;1807;Colors and black levels are excellent.
I:8615;1808;the BD transfer is spectacular.
I:8615;1809;The soundtrack sounds great, too.
I:8615;1810;ray Book format, which adds just an extra whiff of nice to the packaging.
I:8615;1811;Funny, odd and well done!Cary Grant in one of his best performances.
I:8615;1812;a must see for Hitchcock fans.
I:8615;1813;I love this classic Hitchcock, Cary Grant / Eva Marie Saint movie.
I:8615;1814;It is a classic case of mistaken identity with lots of twists and turns, excitement, and some great humor sprinkled throughout.
I:8615;1815;holds up well even though it is 50 years old.
I:8615;1816;The picture is vibrant, crisp, and gorgeous, and perhaps the most amazing thing is that there is not one flaw on the picture anywhere.
I:8615;1817;Even brand new movies often have at least a few imperfections, this film transfer beats them all.
I:8615;1818;Classic Hitchcock with chilling twists and death defying ending.
I:8615;1819;One of the best movies ever made.
I:8615;1820;So easy when it can be streamed.
I:8615;1821;This is a great classic movie.
I:8615;1822;The fight between Cary Grant and the bad guy on the president's faces is also such an outstanding feature.
I:8615;1823;Great movie and I was happy to find it.
I:8615;1824;Cary Grant is a wonderful actor.
I:8615;1825;One can just relax and enjoy.
I:8615;1826;The visual palette is stunning.
I:8615;1827;Hitchcock is a master, I think we can all agree onthat.
I:8615;1828;His narrative is concise and always keeps you guessing and NbyNW is his shining example.
I:8615;1829;This is, in my opinion, the best suspense film ever made.
I:8615;1830;Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint are top notch, as is the rest of the cast.
I:8615;1831;NORTH BY NORTHWEST was my favorite Hitchcock film for many years.
I:8615;1832;I was a teenager and much preferred Hitch's classy, sexy man.
I:8615;1833;The colors and crispness of the picture are truly extraordinary.
I:8615;1834;And this disc is such a great example of how to do it right, especially with our older films.
I:8615;1835;the documentary that accompanies the film is hosted by Eva Marie Saint (who is still a handsome and classy lady).
I:8615;1836;There are some nice behind the scenes photos and info.
I:8615;1837;Yes, and in all the right places, responds suave Cary Grant.
I:8615;1838;it is just so smart the way Lehman hooks up Grant and Saint in the train scene.
I:8615;1839;And when we get to the auction scene later in the film, Saint gives such an emotional performance that you know is rooted in the train scene.
I:8615;1840;and the chase at Mt. Rushmore in the final reel is very exciting and stylistic all at once.
I:8615;1841;welcome, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, to the modern world!
I:8615;1842;After seeing those two, I thought how can he improve.
I:8615;1843;like titles with the fantastic musical score by Bernard Herrman to the final scene on the train, I was captivated.
I:8615;1844;After seeing this movie, I nominated it as my favorite of all and rushed out to see every Cary Grant movie that I could find.
I:8615;1845;I also nominated him as my favorite actor.
I:8615;1846;Eva Marie Saint was wonderful and with all of the lines that this movie coined, my favorite was she uses sex like some people use a fly swatter.
I:8615;1847;There is much to see in this movie.
I:8615;1848;A great job was done mastering the 5:1 soundtrack as well.
I:8615;1849;All in all, I am very impressed with this version of North by Northwest.
I:8615;1850;a job very, very well done.
I:8615;1851;seeing as this has happened with all three.
I:8615;1852;North by Northwest (1959) is an extremely entertaining film that will keep you at the edge of your seat, wondering what will happen next.
I:8615;1853;Needless to say, he embraces the first choice, running for his life whilst attempting to learn more about the real Mr. Kaplan.
I:8615;1854;Roger will get unexpected help from a beautiful and mysterious woman, Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).
I:8615;1855;"Of course, the fact that ""North by Northwest"" has a great director, an outstanding cast, excellent musical score (Bernard Herrmann) and a fluid script (Ernest Lehman) doesn't hurt, either :) All in all, highly recommended!Belen Alcat"
I:8615;1856;One of the best movies of all time with a fabulous cast of stars.
I:8615;1857;I remember first seeing this as a 7 year old on tv.
I:8615;1858;This movie is in excellent movie in movie history and deserves it's place among the 100 best movies of the 20th century.
I:8615;1859;The script is excellent and riveting, the acting very good and Eva very sexy.
I:8615;1860;See this movie if you haven't already, it's worth it.
I:8615;1861;One of the great movies of all time.
I:8615;1862;decided to cherry pick a gem.
I:8615;1863;North By Northwest is a classic.
I:8615;1864;Anyone who's a fan of Hitchcock .
I:8615;1865;or just suspense in general .
I:8615;1866;or great movies specifically .
I:8615;1867;Easily the best Hitchcock or Cary Grant movie ever made.
I:8615;1868;filled with suspense and comedy throughout.
I:8615;1869;It works as well today as it did almost 50 years ago and doesn't seem dated.
I:8615;1870;This movie can be watched over and over again with great pleasure.
I:8615;1871;By now you know the classic cropduster scenes and Mt. Rushmore scene, but there are other great parts of the film as well.
I:8615;1872;Other than it maybe being a bit long during the love scenes, this movie is picture perfect.
I:8615;1873;it's one of my top five movies of all time.
I:8615;1874;The drama and tension is maintained by good acting by really good actors, good editing and a decent story line instead of relying on ever more eye.
I:8615;1875;boggling special effects, chases, wide.
I:8615;1876;In fact, I was surprised at how blatantly sexy and forward Eva Marie Saint's character was .
I:8615;1877;The young people who watched this movie with me, ages 18 and 24, enjoyed it thoroughly, as they did with other Hitchcock classics like Rear Window, The Man Who Knew Too Much and Vertigo.
I:8615;1878;This is a great movie.
I:8615;1879;Funny and serious at the same time.
I:8615;1880;Hitchcock is a master storyteller.
I:8615;1881;"year old understood and enjoyed the ""plot"" and the ""mix."
I:8615;1882;ray presents a 16:9 image (1.78:1) of great clarity, with a wonderful color palette, and clear sound.
I:8615;1883;"And the ""digibook"" art work is also quite a nice touch."
I:8615;1884;All in all, a grand addition to a film lover's collection.
I:8615;1885;And do remember this because it is a motif of this selection, which we will discuss later.
I:8615;1886;well I took a bus to meet him in some barren field.
I:8615;1887;i finally emerged to check the in.
I:8615;1888;room bar, pour myself a brandy, and recline on the king sized bed with my laptop to bring you, yet, another fine review from the feathered pen of Metamorpho!
I:8615;1889;The genius of Hitchcock was never more in ample supply.
I:8615;1890;Intiguing, engaging, the master gives you a ride you'll want to revisit time and time again.
I:8615;1891;All the elements of suspense are present.
I:8615;1892;Knowing Hitchcock, it will all be perceived in his own good time.
I:8615;1893;hithcock keeps the action moving.
I:8615;1894;And, that is one of the very things I like about this movie.
I:8615;1895;There is always some new aspect and new reaction contributing to the journey.
I:8615;1896;Eva Marie Saint (who plays Eve Kendall) the elusive, but soon to be love interest of Roger Thornhill, is sheer perfection.
I:8615;1897;Metamorpho carries with him a supply of Bonine.
I:8615;1898;Very good for twists of plot.
I:8615;1899;I am constantly enamoured of what this man has done with the art of cinema.
I:8615;1900;This makes the movie all the more remarkable.
I:8615;1901;The pain and craziness that Roger endured resulted in a true love of his life.
I:8615;1902;And it still astounds me that Hitchcock never won an Oscar for Best Director.
I:8615;1903;The man was a virtual genius in my eyes.
I:8615;1904;So many memorable scenes in many movies.
I:8615;1905;His legacy lives and, Oscar or not, this movie is definitely one of his finest.
I:8615;1906;Another fun and quirky review on the 200th milestone!
I:8615;1907;by Metamorpho (the wise people's choice!)
I:8615;1908;ray is like seeing it for the first time.
I:8615;1909;This film is truly iconic.
I:8615;1910;The look of the cityscape, the beehive activity depicted from the opening frames is classic.
I:8615;1911;while this film is fantastic .
I:8615;1912;Was there ever a hero as perfect as Cary Grant in North by Northwest?
I:8615;1913;Along the way he becomes involved with the beautiful Eva Marie Saint, who is sleeping with the enemy while working undercover for American intelligence and while I am a big fan of Grace Kelly, Ms. Saint has that smokey kind of sexiness that set all our young male hearts afire back in the days when cars were a block long, had fins and were all made in Detroit.
I:8615;1914;Alfred Hitchcock's direction is flawless and even though, by today's standards, the special effects are a little less than awe.
I:8615;1915;inspiring, they still hold up all these years later.
I:8615;1916;If you have then do what I have done: Watch it again and again.
I:8615;1917;It really is that good.
I:8615;1918;The impeccable Cary Grant, looking dashing and fit as ever, carries the movie that is filled with deception, lies, murder, chases, you name it.
I:8615;1919;He's joined by one of Hitchcock's ubiquitous blondes, the lovely Oscar.
I:8615;1920;winner Eva Marie Saint, and the villain is the dashing James Mason.
I:8615;1921;Ernest Lehman's intelligent script and the always dependable Bernard Hermann's musical score bring this classic to cinematic life for now and ever.
I:8615;1922;It really is one of the best Hitchcock movies of all time.
I:8615;1923;That should say enough, but the supporting actors add more to the credibility and suspense as Cary Grant's character and acting is a little over the top.
I:8615;1924;Still fun to watch again and again as are most Hitchcock movies.
I:8615;1925;When you look at North By Northwest closely, you see many parts from Alfred Hitchcock's other films.
I:8615;1926;As one film critic put it, North By Northwest is a summation of Hitchcock's work.
I:8615;1927;EVERYTHING works perfectly in this movie with memorable scene after memorable scene (Grant's drunk driving escape, the murder at the U. n., the cropduster attack, Mount Rushmore, etc., etc., etc.).
I:8615;1928;Robert Burks' terrific photography greatly enhances the actors and the locations.
I:8615;1929;George Tomasini's editing maintains a crisp pace.
I:8615;1930;Bernard Herrmann's score is a standout, even when compared to his large body of great work (that's really saying something considering his great scores for Citizen Kane, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Vertigo, Psycho and Taxi Driver, among others).
I:8615;1931;And Ernest Lehman's script is one of the wittiest and most entertaining screenplays in film history.
I:8615;1932;Add to that the great locations like New York City, Chicago and Mount Rushmore and you've got the elements of a classic.
I:8615;1933;however, the film's greatest strength lies in its casting and performances, especially by Grant.
I:8615;1934;Grant, Saint, James Mason, Leo G. Carroll, Martin Landau and Jessie Royce Landis form a terrific ensemble.
I:8615;1935;Grant's performance, in particular, is wonderful.
I:8615;1936;Present in almost every scene, Grant is the glue that holds the film together.
I:8615;1937;dimensional charmer many people took him for.
I:8615;1938;It's a shining moment in Grant's great career.
I:8615;1939;It's a fitting presentation for a great film.
I:8615;1940;Along with Vertigo and Psycho, North By Northwest marks the absolute best of Alfred Hitchcock's work.
I:8615;1941;upon home owner in the TV series TOPPER, Carroll was the perfect Hitchcock character.
I:8615;1942;seemingly innocuous and yet always with a great secret of one kind or another.
I:8615;1943;Cary Grant is ideal in his role, using his comic talents to play against the slightly one.
I:8615;1944;and Grant may well have found it pretty delicious, given that he always knew he was the Archie Leach of his birth and not the virtually mythical Cary Grant).
I:8615;1945;It's a great film, full of astonishing camera work and tongue.
I:8615;1946;"Oh, and Eva Marie Saint may well have been the very best of Hitchcock's cool blondes
I:8615;1947;It has it all: The ordinary man thrust into extraordinary circumstances, no way to go to the police.
I:8615;1948;An iconic scene, this one studied in film classes everywhere.
I:8615;1949;And of course the great Cary Grant, the prototypical leading man of a whole cinematic era.
I:8615;1950;Great suspense, acting, excitement and plot!
I:8615;1951;Eva Marie Saint is breathtaking.
I:8615;1952;There are flaws in this film, for sure, but it remains one of my favorite Hitchcock movies, and one of my favorite movies period.
I:8615;1953;, it's just a whole lot of fun.
I:8615;1954;The cornfield sequence is worth the price of admission alone, and for me it's one of THE iconic American film clips.
I:8615;1955;What a class act was Gary Grant!
I:8615;1956;"Perhaps Hitchcock's most acclaimed work, ""North by Northwest"" is an entertaining adventure of espionage, mistaken identity, and a typical 50's romance."
I:8615;1957;"the entire story is one big chase, leading to the infamous ""face."
I:8615;1958;The story by Lehmann and the direction by Hitchcock make this movie a true masterpiece.
I:8615;1959;if you see no other Hitchcock movie, see this one!
I:8615;1960;Like the interesting fact that Hitchcock was working on films since the 1920's.
I:8615;1961;He's also helped changed suspense movies from all being a B. movie to a Must.
I:8615;1962;Seeing this entirely, I found it to be a really good spy suspense movie.
I:8615;1963;The acting was really well done.
I:8615;1964;There was some new scenes that I really liked.
I:8615;1965;This suspense building and then bam!
I:8615;1966;That was nice to see their happy ending, but I think it could've been a better transfer between the two scenes.
I:8615;1967;so after the movie was over on Turner Classic channel, Robert Osborne began telling some fun facts about the movie.
I:8615;1968;This movie is one of Hitchcock's masterpieces.
I:8615;1969;While for the time the clothing, scene designs, and special effects must have seemed very modern, today the styles are hip and retro.
I:8615;1970;I like this movie and you should watch this great masterpiece!

I:8615;2005;Great script, wonderful cinematography and one of the most creative chase scenes in cinema with the crop duster.

I:8615;2007;Ol' Cockers at his best!
I:8615;2008;Thrilling, patriotic, and politically correct story.
I:8615;2009;Both Cary Grant and Eve Mary Saint are well casted for their roles.
I:8615;2010;Superb acting and great dialog.
I:8615;2011;This is by far the most purely entertaining of Hitchcock's movies, at least of the ones I've seen.
I:8615;2012;Vertigo is long and a touch ponderous.
I:8615;2013;The Birds has flashes of kinetic energy, and then a lot of dreariness.
I:8615;2014;"the opening credits are again done wonderfully by Saul Bass, underscored by Bernard Herrmann, whose music is the sheer definition of ""Hitchcockian"" ."
I:8615;2015;And barely a minute after the credits end, Roger Thornhill is in up to his ears after a brilliant little bit of confusion.
I:8615;2016;And it never lets up until the glorious end, where it finishes up as quick and neatly as it started.
I:8615;2017;all the actors are suitably fun in their parts.
I:8615;2018;Eva Marie Sainte is great as the love interest.
I:8615;2019;It's unfair to classify her as the prototype of the 'Bond girl'.
I:8615;2020;James Mason uses that distinctive voice of his to bring both charm and menace to his role as the villain.
I:8615;2021;He delivers the tight, Ernest Lehman.
I:8615;2022;penned script as if he always has a cocktail in one hand and a beautiful woman in the other.
I:8615;2023;"The scene where he calls for a valet to clean his suit is the clincher
I:8615;2024;And that's part of the fun of the movie.
I:8615;2025;The cinematography in this movie was superb.
I:8615;2026;filled with clever wit after the darker Vertigo of a year earlier .
I:8615;2027;is still an excellent film.
I:8615;2028;My contemporary university students loved it.
I:8615;2029;This is just a great old movie.
I:8615;2030;It is full I've suspense and intrigue and true Hitchcock style.
I:8615;2031;It is a good movie for a rainy day.
I:8615;2032;Probably the best Hitchcock film that I have ever seen this is a must see movie for classic movie buffs
I:8615;2033;Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece collaboration is well preserved and beautifully remastered in this Blu.
I:8615;2034;highly recommend for your BD library.
I:8615;2035;The story is pure Hitchcock formula: mistaken identity, being chased by spys and police, and ofcourse a blond heroine.
I:8615;2036;Especially enjoy James Mason's cool, evil under.
I:8615;2037;It has everything, from intense action and mystery that is built up by the amazing score, to the perfect actors and actresses portraying well written and witty, and sometimes sexy, dialogue.
I:8615;2038;As well as the exoticly filmed locations and that 50.60's style.
I:8615;2039;I've noticed something about Alfred Hitchcock thrillers.
I:8615;2040;But they do have genuine class.
I:8615;2041;I will say though that the pacing is leisurely, the story interesting, the performances all strong.
I:8615;2042;And James Mason has a voice that makes everything he say sound like Shakespeare.
I:8615;2043;but who I really love is Cary Grant.
I:8615;2044;Even when he's being hunted by spies, he's still relaxed and continental and witty.
I:8615;2045;I would've given the movie 4 stars but Landau, Mason, and Grant push it easily into five.
I:8615;2046;if you don't need a car chase or gun fight every five minutes then this is a very good movie.
I:8615;2047;It's got style, class, and some very witty dialogue.
I:8615;2048;but more importantly, it's got Cary Grant.
I:8615;2049;one of my top ten favorite movies .
I:8615;2050;It's one of Hitchcocks best films.
I:8615;2051;The restoration really looks incredible.
I:8615;2052;Probably the best it ever looked.
I:8615;2053;there's also a wealth of special features.
I:8615;2054;North by Northwest is a winner for all the right reasons: a fantastic score, an iconic crop duster scene, a snappy suit, and all the innuendo Hitchcock could muster.
I:8615;2055;This movie is really good.
I:8615;2056;one being with Eva Marie Saint who points out a pretty funny blooper and other interesting things.
I:8615;2057;My friend is a big Hitchcock fan and especially loves North by Northwest, so to give her this blu.
I:8615;2058;ray edition of the movie will make her very happy.
I:8615;2059;And I loved the lowest price anywhere I paid for it.
I:8615;2060;the effect is that the light charm and the beauty of the film have disappeared.
I:8615;2061;But when the big studios make a concerted effort to get it right, pull out all the stops, and go to town on making the best high definition transfers possible, then Blu.
I:8615;2062;"ray shines: ""North By Northwest"" is one of those examples (another recent release, ""Gone With The Wind"", is another fantastic example)."
I:8615;2063;screen transfer offers a spotless print, with wonderfully intense blacks and rich and vivid colour.
I:8615;2064;It is quintessential Hitchcock: the ever suave Cary Grant is pursued by sinister and yet urbane James Mason and hooks up with Eve Marie Saint in a slickly paced thriller with brilliant set.
I:8615;2065;"It's possibly Hitchcock's best film (although critics would have you believe that's ""Vertigo""), and in any case deserves the blu ribband treatment."
I:8615;2066;This is one of the few really great older films to be on Blu.
I:8615;2067;One of the best of Hitchcock (although as far as his films go, Hitch probably has the best track record of any director living or dead).
I:8615;2068;a man is mistaken for a CIA agent and is caught in a deadly game of cat and mouse, as it were.
I:8615;2069;I LOVE the music and the visuals that start out the film .
I:8615;2070;Cary Grant is excellent as always, James Mason plays one of the most sinister of Hitchcock's villains (I would LOVE to have this guy's voice) and Eva Marie Saint looks gorgeous and plays her part well.
I:8615;2071;I also enjoyed seeing Martin Landau in an early role as one of James Mason's henchmen and Jessie Royce Landis (the mother from To Catch a Thief ) as Grant's mother (although both were very near the same age at the time).
I:8615;2072;And I love any film score by Bernard Herrmann .
I:8615;2073;nominated (as this one did).
I:8615;2074;Amazing the first time you see it, the 2nd time you see it, and every time after that!!!
I:8615;2075;I highly recommend this film.
I:8615;2076;I saw this movie as a child and it was great seeing it again.
I:8615;2077;Great movie about spies, secrets, and love.
I:8615;2078;A fantastic film, IMO it is Hitchcock's best.
I:8615;2079;I am so happy to have received my all time Hitchcock movie.
I:8615;2080;Enjoyed every bit of the film.
I:8615;2081;One of the beat Hitchcock's movie
I:8615;2082;keeps you on edge the whole movie.
I:8615;2083;and you'll want to watch again and again.
I:8615;2084;ie one wide screen the second full screen with special features, which is what I received.
I:8615;2085;"that noted, the transfer was excellent
I:8615;2086;And the features I watched: a documentary on the life and career of Cary Grant and a documentary on Hitchcock and the making of this movie, hosted by Eva Marie Saint, were both interesting.
I:8615;2087;Cary garnt, oh so debonair, handsome, engaging.
I:8615;2088;This is a fun mystery thriller.
I:8615;2089;It also has my favorite actor Martin Landau!!!
I:8615;2090;So, if you are looking for a movie with twist and turns see this movie.
I:8615;2091;wonders of wonders, he had put it there.
I:8615;2092;Saved by a gracious lady, who shares her dinner table and then her room with him, puzzles him to ask, what she has to gain by helping him.
I:8615;2093;a true Hitchcock movie and ending.
I:8615;2094;I can recommend this to Hitchcock fans as you already know what to expect, and all otherswho are curious and are looking for a movie not filled with explosions, incredible feats of acrobatics and too many guns.
I:8615;2095;One of my favorite films.
I:8615;2096;"Cary Grant is wonderful
I:8615;2097;And the scene with the plane is intense.
I:8615;2098;Wheather it be your first time seeing this or your tenth, it's still enjoyable through and through.
I:8615;2099;Awesome getting to see the on location sites they used.
I:8615;2100;There was some great cinematography.
I:8615;2101;And it is a Cary Grant movie directed by Hitchcock.
I:8615;2102;He milks every drop of suspense and along the way injects a lot of humor and sexual innuendo with the usual blonde femme fatale (Eva Marie Saint) providing a good number of delightful moments.
I:8615;2103;Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint are perfect in the leads and James Mason and Martin Landau are highly satisfactory villains.
I:8615;2104;it's all great fun, with Grant mistaken in the opening scene for a Federal Intelligence agent who doesn't really exist.
I:8615;2105;He is soon swept up in a an amusing and suspenseful twist of plot complications involving spies and counterspies with an unpredictable series of nail.
I:8615;2106;cropping scene is a highlight, skillfully edited and photographed for maximum effect.
I:8615;2107;time great that has to rank as one of Grant's and Hitchcock's best films.
I:8615;2108;I am a huge Hitchcock fan, and this is one of my favorites.
I:8615;2109;Brilliant movie, great acting, and of course Cary Grant was at that age where gorgeous is an understatement.
I:8615;2110;An unfortunate aspect of growing up in America is that the turnover in culture is so fast that many older classics are almost unknown to the modern generation.
I:8615;2111;This is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:8615;2112;Part thriller, part romance, part suspense and part action, this movie presaged modern Hollywood fare such as The Fugitive, National Security, and Enemy of the State for example.
I:8615;2113;There is gunfights, chase scenes, set.
I:8615;2114;The special effects are also top.
I:8615;2115;notch and comparable to anything seen on network TV today.
I:8615;2116;And most importantly, a great storyline.
I:8615;2117;I highly recommend this movie.
I:8615;2118;Actually this film gets better.
I:8615;2119;As a collector of Hitchcock films this ranks with some of his best.
I:8615;2120;if you enjoy thrillers, and bone.
I:8615;2121;chilling suspense the scenes in this movie will satisfy your pleasures.
I:8615;2122;This is one of the best movies ever made.
I:8615;2123;Cary Grant is so amazing (they don't make actors like this anymore!)
I:8615;2124;and everything about this movie is fantastic!
I:8615;2125;And the transfer is so good you wouldn't believe it is a forty.year.
I:8615;2126;The bonus materials is also quite good, the documentary is interesting (she still looks good, Eva Marie Saint) and it's always a treat to watch one of Hitch's trailers.
I:8615;2127;"Fueled by an unmitigated desire to make ""the"" Hitchcock picture to top all others, screenwriter Ernest Lehman creates two of the most memorable set pieces in film history: Roger's frantic escape on foot from a marauding bi."
I:8615;2128;plane, and, the magnificent climax .
I:8615;2129;The results are flawless and thrilling.
I:8615;2130;Colors are rich, bold and vibrant.
I:8615;2131;Blacks are deep and solid.
I:8615;2132;Truly, this is one of the best examples of a classic restored to its original brilliance for the digital format.
I:8615;2133;Certainly it is the finest example of a Vista.
I:8615;2134;"like ""cliffhangers,"" one suspenseful camera shot after another, and a great Bernard Herrmann score."
I:8615;2135;Cary Grant is superb, and the supporting cast of Eva.
I:8615;2136;"The film's ""glorious Technicolor"" fits the lavishness of its setting and plot."
I:8615;2137;While I agree that this is a very sleek looking film and there is something appealing about being mistaken for a spy.
I:8615;2138;I love you Hitchcock and Cary Grant, but this one wasn't for me.
I:8615;2139;I'd watch any film starring Cary Grant, but aside from my appreciation for one of Hollywood's greatest of all time, I appreciate the action packed story of this film as well.
I:8615;2140;Cary Grant during his best film days .
I:8615;2141;Cary Grant has the style and chiseled look of Harrison Ford with the surprising comic timing of Jim Carey (especially in scenes with mother ) Add a screen siren .
I:8615;2142;Eva Marie Saint, a very young Martin Landau ( Crimes and Misdemeanors ), fantastic technicolour location shots, and a cropduster scene now studied in film schools, and you have one film perfect to introduce to a love interest with a home.
I:8615;2143;a scene (and film) which is masterfully scored by Bernard Hermann who, incidentally, wrote the score for Taxi Driver .
I:8615;2144;Hitchcock really knew his stuff.
I:8615;2145;I had to see North by Northwest for Film class and i have to admit that i was glad i got to see one of the finest films in American movie history.
I:8615;2146;the film is iconic for it's one scene involving the airplane and crop field, but overall, the film is a tribute to one of film's greatest directors, Alfred Hitchock.
I:8615;2147;Unlike the films of today which are big budget, big bombs, sex scene, nude part, etc, North by Northwest is a great film of story making that will have you entrenched from beginning to end.
I:8615;2148;i highly recommend North by Northwest, and for film class, it's a great film to study.
I:8615;2149;Since I absolutely love who dun its, this was a fun movie to figure out who was the good guy and who was the bad guy.
I:8615;2150;twisting, funny and romantic movie where an average guy manages to get himself mixed up in a murder plot of national significance.
I:8615;2151;One of my favorite Cary Grant movies that will keep you guessing until the end.
I:8615;2152;A must see for old movie buffs, Hitchcock and Cary Grant fans.
I:8615;2153;on accurate and detail is everywhere.
I:8615;2154;The letterboxing acheives a nice frame, the way the film was intended for.
I:8615;2155;the extras are also excellent.
I:8615;2156;The documentary is very entertaining and informative, as is the commentary by Ernest Lehman.
I:8615;2157;(The Hitchcock trailer is neat.)
I:8615;2158;The photo gallery offers some neat photographs (nearly 40!)
I:8615;2159;The inclusion of spanish and french audio tracks is great so that more people can be introduced to this excellent film.
I:8615;2160;only track is great since Bernard Herrmann's score is exquisitely great.
I:8615;2161;warners knows that people want the main attraction, the film, and they satisfy that want.
I:8615;2162;action, Romance, Suspense, Humor, Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, clever script by Lehman.
I:8615;2163;and of course, Alfred Hitchcock's direction.
I:8615;2164;Right next to The Birds, I would rate this as one of Alfred Hitchcock's best thrillers!
I:8615;2165;Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint are superb in their talented roles of the wrong man at the wrong time.
I:8615;2166;You will be on the edge of your seat with this classic!
I:8615;2167;Cary Grant and Eve Marie Saint steam up the movie while a case of mistaken identity leads to a wild adventure.
I:8615;2168;He gets the lion's share of the credit for this well.
I:8615;2169;crafted classic but you also have to give credit to Ernest Lehman, the screenwriter.
I:8615;2170;The great thing about Grant was that unlike most freakishly beautiful movie stars, he always came across as self.
I:8615;2171;deprecating and not especially impressed with his own good looks.
I:8615;2172;I think that's what made him so endearing.
I:8615;2173;Hitchcock is one of the best of best directors and sharing his genius with my film class is a constant joy.
I:8615;2174;My students really get in to his works and they actually pay attention.
I:8615;2175;a top cast, great acting and a suspense filled plot.
I:8615;2176;It gets better the more I see it.
I:8615;2177;If you like classic movies and Mt. Rushmore, this one is for you.
I:8615;2178;Great ending, but the rest is good as well.
I:8615;2179;One of Hitchcock's three best movies, possibly second only to Psycho.
I:8615;2180;Funny at times, thrilling at others.
I:8615;2181;Crop duster scene a classic.
I:8615;2182;I am confident to say that North by Northwest and Vertigo are two of the best and more personal films made by Alfred Hitchcock.
I:8615;2183;i can only hope that this release may have some sort of influence on Universal, to do the same.
I:8615;2184;Most of Hitchcock's catalogue belongs to Universal, including those films whose negatives have already been restored.
I:8615;2185;as far as North by Northwest is concerned, this is, without a doubt, the best home video version ever, a must for film collectors and hi.
I:8615;2186;And such memorable scenes with the diving plane and Mt Rushmore.
I:8615;2187;"In November 2009, Warner Home Video released the 50th Anniversary 2 disc edition of Alfred Hitchcock's splendid 1959 thriller ""North by Northwest""."
I:8615;2188;The film stars Cary Grant, Eva Marie and James Mason and proves to be just the right blend of wit, sophistication, glamour and action.
I:8615;2189;"Many critics consider ""North By Northwest"" to be the finest picture Hitchcock ever made."
I:8615;2190;Our hero Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) finds himself unwittingly caught up in a case of international intrigue when foreign agents mistakenly identify him as a CIA operative named George Kaplan and abduct him.
I:8615;2191;existent operative created by U. s. Intelligence to draw attention away from the real operative in this melodrama Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).
I:8615;2192;The interplay between Cary Grant and Eva Saint Marie in this film is priceless.
I:8615;2193;Ernest Lehman's screenplay is simply brilliant with painstaking attention paid to even the smallest of details.
I:8615;2194;The photography is stunning and Bernard Herrmann's compelling musical score strikes just the right note at several key points in this motion picture.
I:8615;2195;North By Northwest' offers two of the most memorable scenes in the history of the movies.
I:8615;2196;"The ""bonus"" disc features extensive and incisive commentary by the film's screenwriter Ernest Lehman."
I:8615;2197;"Five decades later ""North by Northwest"" remains a fast paced thriller that will keep you on your toes from start to finish."
I:8615;2198;done thriller with a lot of twists and turns along the way.
I:8615;2199;The closing scene (on Mt. Rushmore) was a bit of a gimmick, but it was an entertaining and suspenseful movie.
I:8615;2200;I have seen this movie several times on TV and absolutely love it and wanted to see it one more time.
I:8615;2201;It's a romance, it's a comedy, it's a thriller .
I:8615;2202;There are several unforgettable scary thriller scenes, including the chase by a plane in the middle of a cornfield and the final beauty on the face of Mt. Rushmore .
I:8615;2203;top notch entertainment that never gets old.
I:8615;2204;This is the first time I bought a Blu ray and I must admit that I'm a satisfied customer.
I:8615;2205;Item came faster than expected and definitely worth the description.
I:8615;2206;NORTH BY NORTHWEST is the ultimate Hitchcock film.
I:8615;2207;the performances are all remarkable.
I:8615;2208;The cinematography is bright and engaging.
I:8615;2209;Bernard Herrmann's score is stunning and masterfully conducted.
I:8615;2210;One of the ten greatest films ever made.
I:8615;2211;Hitchcock was a master and his works deserve seeing again and again.
I:8615;2212;Watching was a great way to spend Saturday night.
I:8615;2213;When you first watch North By Northwest you may think, it's a very entertaining movie and nothing beyond that.
I:8615;2214;Actually it is an extremely entertaining story and nothing beyond that.
I:8615;2215;And it is one of the greatest examples of the genius of Hitchcock!
I:8615;2216;He's the only director I know who could take a story as trivial and create such a mood of place and character, that every scene is successful in tone, mood and creative scene development.
I:8615;2217;It is the bible of narrative for the action and spy genre.
I:8615;2218;And I believe set the tone for the Bond films, which have never equalled it!
I:8615;2219;A bit tame by todays more violent standards but still a classic and well worth watching.
I:8615;2220;Probably the best picture that I have ever seen it presented in.
I:8615;2221;North by Northwest is, of course, a classic .
I:8615;2222;some regard it as Hitchcock's best film.
I:8615;2223;What really pleased me about this Blu.
I:8615;2224;As well as a biography of Hitch, there's an excellent hour and half feature on Cary Grant .
I:8615;2225;The print looks amazing, and the insights provided by the writer of the screenplay are great.
I:8615;2226;Makes a movie that is already one of the best, even better.
I:8615;2227;Bernard Hermann's score is awesome.
I:8615;2228;And the action is breathtaking.
I:8615;2229;Those famous initial growling notes of drums and deep violins building to the wonderful pulsating rhythm.
I:8615;2230;"This movie combines the best of everyone's talents
I:8615;2231;but it doesn't matter, because the movie is so entertaining and enjoyable and its lead characters so appealing that you suspend your disbelief almost immediately.
I:8615;2232;As he struggles to solve the mystery and clear his name, he meets Eve Kendall, an alluring woman (Eva Marie Saint at the peak of her beauty) who figures to be either his undoing or his salvation.
I:8615;2233;Ernest Lehman's script provides wonderful dialogue, and the scene in the train's dining car where Kendall lures Thornhill into her berth is electric.

I:8615;2237;Hitchcock is amaster ofdirection and he has chosen a brilliant cast to go with an equally briniant plot.
I:8615;2238;The characters delelop well and Cary Grant offers an amazing perfomance of an innocent man chased all over the US in order to save his life and proove his innocence.
I:8615;2239;Meanwhile romance is thrown in the plot with a mystirious but gorgeous Eva Marie Saint.
I:8615;2240;a great addition to your collection.
I:8615;2241;The picture is flawless, and rivals even newer movies.
I:8615;2242;I've seen movies released this year that don't have a gorgeous transfer like this.
I:8615;2243;You'll probably have to turn your volume up a little higher than normal to find the right volume, but the sound is also excellent.
I:8615;2244;north by Northwest is a cinematic masterpiece, and I'm thrilled to see it get the treatment it deserves on Blu.
I:8615;2245;I love this film and have seen it many times.
I:8615;2246;The first few times you see it, you're so swept up in the non.
I:8615;2247;stop action and the plot twists that you may not fully appreciate the imagery of the perfectly composed scenes and the powerful score that adds so much.
I:8615;2248;The acting, the screenplay, and iconic scenes like the crop duster attack and the chase on Mt. Rushmore all combine to make this a great movie.
I:8615;2249;It's not only one of my favorite Hitchcock films, it's one of my favorite films of all times by any director.
I:8615;2250;It's the first Hitchcock film to be issued as a Blu.
I:8615;2251;ray, so news of its release caused a great deal of interest among fans.
I:8615;2252;ray transfer high marks, and I'm pleased to report that the positive reviews are accurate.
I:8615;2253;The remastering was done with great care and with impressive results.
I:8615;2254;def transfer is very effective at revealing details and adding a greatly improved sense of depth and dimensionality.
I:8615;2255;the audio is also excellent, with the soundtrack coming alive in a way that it never has before.
I:8615;2256;Bernard Herrmann's score is such an integral part of the film that it's good to hear it more fully.
I:8615;2257;there's a very good set of extras, two of them new for this release.
I:8615;2258;ray book and the booklet is well done, with a lot of pictures and several short essays.
I:8615;2259;ray is essential, and if you've never seen it, you'll definitely want to see the Blu.
I:8615;2260;That is why I love movies like this because it allows the younger generation a glimpse into the past where the stars were relatively well behaved and free from addictions.
I:8615;2261;Perhaps this is a romanticized view that Hollywood wants my generation to believe, but I believe it to be true.
I:8615;2262;He has the nice clothes, gets all of the pretty girls and has that smooth talking manner about him.
I:8615;2263;Both give great performances as Roger Thornhill and Eve Kendall, their respective characters.
I:8615;2264;Along the way he encounters a beautiful Eve Kendell and we are not sure what her motives are.
I:8615;2265;again, I was not around in Hitchcock's time, but he is known as a master of suspense and North by Northwest does not disappoint.
I:8615;2266;This movie was listed in the top 25 of the greatest movies of the 20th century by the American Film Institute and rightfully so.
I:8615;2267;North by Northwest is an exciting thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire movie.
I:8615;2268;It has more ups and downs than a San Francisco avenue.
I:8615;2269;I would highly recommend it for any avid movie buff, but especially for those Gen. Xers who have no idea what the `50's were like.
I:8615;2270;Grant is excellent, Eva though not beautiful is competent.
I:8615;2271;i don't think youngsters ( I am 33) well find it very absorbing.
I:8615;2272;really liked it as I saw a Hitchcock movie after a real long time.
I:8615;2273;It seems to me that 1.99 would be appropriate by now, but it's a fun watch.
I:8615;2274;I give this one high marks for excitement, entertainment, and humour.
I:8615;2275;My favorite thing in the film, is Cary Grant, who is at his most splendid, elegant, funny best.
I:8615;2276;Just watching this man for two hours is sheer pleasure.
I:8615;2277;the rest of the cast is good.
I:8615;2278;James Mason gives his usual expert performance as the bad guy who is just charming enough to have won the beautiful blond, for a while.
I:8615;2279;When she shows her true feelings towards the end, she warms up and her real beauty shows.
I:8615;2280;She is good (reminds me of Stockard Channing) but not at all convincing as his mom.
I:8615;2281;Also, Grant is just too gorgeous to be going to the theatre with his mother!The most amusing feature of the film, is Mount Rushmore!
I:8615;2282;Just the idea of having people scrambling for their lives over the faces of our venerable presidents stikes me as very funny.
I:8615;2283;all in all, it's great entertainment.
I:8615;2284;It's not going to enlighten you or give you great cause to think or stick with you for hours after you see it, but while you're watching it, you'll be glued to the screen.
I:8615;2285;I'm a 36 year old that enjoyed this classic movie.
I:8615;2286;I would recommend it for any adult to watch for the first time or again.
I:8615;2287;with the obvious Hollywood happy ending .
I:8615;2288;The photography is amazing and makes the film worth watching.
I:8615;2289;A Hitchcock classic and a must see movie.
I:8615;2290;Cary Grant is amazing as usual with a perfect Mad Men portrayal.
I:8615;2291;"One of the BEST Hitchcock ever directed, an all star cast, a thrilling plot, action packed sequences til the very end, and a ""dreamy"" love story with Cary Grant!!"
I:8615;2292;watch it just to see the comedy scenes with Cary drunk, the aftermath with the police, and his hilarious scenes with his mother!!
I:8615;2293;The video was excellent and the value was top of the line.
I:8615;2294;I recommend this Hitchcock movie for the entire family.
I:8615;2295;It is superbly directed and produced and truly one of the all time best movies for intrigue and suspense.
I:8615;2296;This is a must for your library.
I:8615;2297;Very good classic movie with great actors.
I:8615;2298;I have seen the movie several times and enjoyed it.
I:8615;2299;Hitchcock and Grant in one of the great suspense movies of all time.
I:8615;2300;Has 2 of the most famous scenes in movie history and is a must.
I:8615;2301;see for any movie buff.
I:8615;2302;Alfred Hitchcock's North By Northwest is by far his best film.
I:8615;2303;The production, screenwriting, and musical score made this classic what it is after 45 years.
I:8615;2304;Despite that somewhat unoriginal film idea, Cary Grant, Eve Marie Saint, James Mason, and Martin Landau were quite convincing in this thriller of a film full of suspense and intrigue.
I:8615;2305;It captures the American landscape with New York's metropolis, which includes the UN building.
I:8615;2306;"In addition, the wheat fields of the Midwest to Mount Rushmore keeps you hanging at the edge of your seat
I:8615;2307;out cropdusting plane to the heads of Jefferson, T. Roosevelt, Lincoln,and Washington.
I:8615;2308;this film is perfect for the movie buff or anyone who enjoys watching a well.
I:8615;2309;You had Alfred Hitchcock to draw you back to reality, but in sophisticated film form.
I:8615;2310;ray is a triumph in film restoration.
I:8615;2311;"i imagine that the last time ""North by Northwest looked this good was when it was originally released in 1959."
I:8615;2312;The high definition transfer offers an amazing level of detail .
I:8615;2313;Always great to watch and cheer on Cary Grant as he beats the bad guys.
I:8615;2314;50th anniversary edition is filled with great extras that are not to be missed.
I:8615;2315;Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint are superb in this movie.
I:8615;2316;The plot also keeps you guessing which side is attempting to foil Cary Grant
I:8615;2317;"Wedged between two exercises in the psychosexual (""Vertigo"" and ""Psycho""), Alfred Hitchcock made a truly entertaining chase flick."
I:8615;2318;North by Northwest features a cross.
I:8615;2319;"country joy ride of familiar landmarks as Cary Grant's ""Roger Thornhill"" tries to elude both the henchmen of James Mason (SUPERB!)"
I:8615;2320;Martin Landau, in an early role, is featured as Leonard, Mason's right.
I:8615;2321;the movie also sports a brilliantly exciting Bernard Herrmann score.
I:8615;2322;There was also a kind note of thanks on the outer mailing label.
I:8615;2323;Great copy and speedy service.
I:8615;2324;"A case of mistaken identity leads to kidnapping and more, in the suspenseful ""North by Northwest,"" directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Cary Grant."
I:8615;2325;And before he's through, Thornhill will have scaled the famous monument, played tag with a crop.
I:8615;2326;dusting airplane and fallen in love with a beautiful woman.
I:8615;2327;It's a classic case of an ordinary person getting caught up in extraordinary events, and with Hitchcock behind it all, you know it's going to be a thrilling ride.
I:8615;2328;with this film, Hitchcock proves once again that he is, indeed, the Master of Suspense.
I:8615;2329;It's part of that special touch he has that keeps it all exciting and moving along, while allowing the tension to build until the very end.
I:8615;2330;It's a precision balancing act.
I:8615;2331;keeping the story right on the wire while refusing to reveal any more than is necessary at any given point in time.
I:8615;2332;that few directors have managed to achieve so effectively.
I:8615;2333;"Hitchcock has an eye for detail, an innate sense of what works and knows just when to infuse some humor into his story
I:8615;2334;grant, as expected, gives a first.
I:8615;2335;"rate performance as Thornhill, using his natural charm and style to great effect
I:8615;2336;His reaction to being kidnapped is totally honest, as he affects an almost naive sense of well being even with a gun stuck in his ribs.
I:8615;2337;And the transition from that point to when he fully realizes the danger he's in is extremely well handled and developed.
I:8615;2338;It's a good bit of acting by Grant, and directing by Hitchcock.
I:8615;2339;the great thing about Hitchcock is that he sets you up so beautifully and never fails to deliver.
I:8615;2340;He consistently gives you that sense that something is about to happen, and it always does.
I:8615;2341;dusting plane making a pass in the distance, and then you see it again.
I:8615;2342;you know something is up.
I:8615;2343;And from that innocuous lead in, Hitchcock develops one of his most memorable scenes ever, brilliantly conceived and realized.
I:8615;2344;"An exciting story, some engaging performances and the indelible images this film plants in your memory, all make ""North by Northwest"" one of Hitchcock's finest (and that's saying a lot)."
I:8615;2345;Thoroughly entertaining, it's one to which you can return time and again and still be thrilled anew.
I:8615;2346;"You can always rely on Hitchcock to give you a good show, and show you a good time
I:8615;2347;Great movie with Cary Grant I love all his movies there is lots of action and it will keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:8615;2348;Great music, great acting and Eva Marie Saint to boot.
I:8615;2349;This movie has always kept my attention.
I:8615;2350;It's suspenseful without overdoing it.
I:8615;2351;The plot is creditable and characters are believable.
I:8615;2352;Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint (and the rest of the strong cast) are fantastic in this Alfred Hitchcock thriller.
I:8615;2353;Suspense, romance, mystery, laughs and more reward you when you view this classic movie.
I:8615;2354;Alfred Hitchcock made an extraordinary film in North By Northwest, and it includes some of his most amazing cinematography.
I:8615;2355;It's astounding to think that the special effects are based on the real locations involved, since CGI was certainly not available in the day this was made.
I:8615;2356;Cary Grant is excellent as a man on the run in a case of mistaken identity.
I:8615;2357;I was hooked within the first 15 minutes of this excellent film.
I:8615;2358;Likely as good or better than it did upon first theatrical release.
I:8615;2359;The special features are just the icing on the cake.
I:8615;2360;Nothing much to say here, as the film is a classic.
I:8615;2361;7, No. 4, Summer, 1981, which is amazing.
I:8615;2362;great for older kids and the whole family.
I:8615;2363;It's exciting, full of twists and unexpected turns.
I:8615;2364;This has been a great classic.
I:8615;2365;I saw it years ago and it is still compelling.
I:8615;2366;This movie is very well made for the date it was made and has a lot of action and suspense.
I:8615;2367;The actors are great in there parts and they play them very well.
I:8615;2368;Cary Grant is great in this movie.
I:8615;2369;ons cover the careers of Alfred Hitchcock and Cary Grant as well as interviews with Eva Marie Saint.
I:8615;2370;This was a bargain and point of note .
I:8615;2371;i highly recommend this to everyone .
I:8615;2372;even my 21 year old daughter loved it seeing it for the first time.
I:8615;2373;The Making of extra is fun, and the film looks and sounds great.
I:8615;2374;Crispness and immediacy of the image will make up for the shaving, however: if shaved, at least it's shaved cleanly.
I:8615;2375;This movie was a throw back to great movies with great actors.
I:8615;2376;There are few films I have in my film library that is as consistently pleasing as this one.
I:8615;2377;Even though we have nearly memorized every detail, each time it is as fresh, intelligent, funny, and suspenseful as ever.
I:8615;2378;roT, the normal man played by Cary Grant, is one of Hitch's greatest creations.
I:8615;2379;But RoT is also full of dark humor, even in the ruses he employs to escape or save his skin.
I:8615;2380;The disorderly scene in the auction house, for example, is absolutely classic and we laugh at it every time.
I:8615;2381;Even the love scenes and the exquisite chemistry between Grant and Eva Marie Saint are believable.
I:8615;2382;The other actors, such as Landau, are first rate.
I:8615;2383;though produced at a more innocent time when the CIA was generally in a more positive light than it is today, Hitch's touch makes it instantly suspect to the point that the viewer will question its competence and motives.
I:8615;2384;In a way, the spy they are chasing is more sympathetic, and certainly has more style.
I:8615;2385;recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.
I:8615;2386;It is a true classic.
I:8615;2387;this is a great movie on so many levels.
I:8615;2388;It's definitely a film to keep and view again and again.
I:8615;2389;This movie may be old by now, but it is still good.
I:8615;2390;It is a clean suspense story with classic actors and interesting locations.
I:8615;2391;It will hold your attention and you won't be disappointed.
I:8615;2392;Havent seen it in many many years, Alfred Hitchkock has a style of his own and I thought this was a good refreshing memory of an old classic.
I:8615;2393;VEry happy with product, beautifully presented and the shipment of the item was very fast.
I:8615;2394;I really enjoy this very entertaining movie.
I:8615;2395;In a way, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is a glorious remake.
I:8615;2396;bernard Hermann is almost without debate the greatest film composer.
I:8615;2397;Which film features his greatest work, however, is open to debate.
I:8615;2398;Probably most would give the nod to his extraordinary score for PSYCHO, but my own vote would go for NORTH BY NORTHWEST.
I:8615;2399;This music is so extraordinary that it has actually been assembled into a suite that is sometimes performed by symphony orchestras.
I:8615;2400;This is one of the most influential scenes in the history of film, not least because of the patience he displays in allowing it to unfold.
I:8615;2401;hitchcock was truly one of the great cultural wonders of the modern world.
I:8615;2402;It has all his trademarks, from suspense to humor to hairbreadth escapes to the mild dirty jokes he was fond of (see the film's final shot).
I:8615;2403;but that is true of this film, directed by Alfred Hitchcock and featuring Cary Grant in the lead role.
I:8615;2404;Roger O. Thornhill (Grant) is the aforementioned innocent man.
I:8615;2405;These are devices which Hitchcock uses skillfully throughout many of his films.
I:8615;2406;Grant and Saint develop a unique on.
I:8615;2407;I especially appreciate several of the scenes, notably when Thornhill is attacked by a crop.
I:8615;2408;Hitchcock allows Thornhill little of the self.
I:8615;2409;assurance we associate with Grant's characters in other films.
I:8615;2410;We share his confusion and frustration as he muddles through in one of Hitchcock's most entertaining films.
I:8615;2411;Given the circumstances, perhaps survival is the best Thornhill can hope for.
I:8615;2412;Granted he did write North by Northwest and its very valuable to have his commentary.
I:8615;2413;I'm not going to describe it, the previous writer's have done a marvelous job with that.
I:8615;2414;Respect to Hitchcock and his talent was obvious.
I:8615;2415;That was not the case here, the Vistavision print lent itself to a marvelous conversion and the re.
I:8615;2416;enginered DD 5.1 gives cutting edge technology to a stellar soundtrack.
I:8615;2417;As previously stated a fascinating group of extras is in included.
I:8615;2418;This is a film that will endear itself to the movie public for a very long time and continue to be a standard against all others of it's genre.
I:8615;2419;Somewhere in between is the sophisticated, glamorous and mysterious femme fatale Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), whose unpredictable devotions tremble between the extremes of good and evil.
I:8615;2420;"Does he clear his name after falsely being accused?Directed by a genius behind the camera and a ""master of suspense,"" and featuring intrigue, comedy, romance, and danger."
I:8615;2421;the crime at the U. n., the lethal crop duster attack in the middle of nowhere, Grant's unusually good exhibition at a Chicago auction, the sequence at an automobile plant, and the impressive climactic hunt across the Presidential faces carved into Mount Rushmore.
I:8615;2422;hitchcock celebrated his golden effort with his fourth and final masterpiece after 1954's Rear Window, 1958's Vertigo, and 1960's Psycho.
I:8615;2423;If you are reading this you already know North by Northwest is a great film and have likely seen it many times.
I:8615;2424;If that is not the case, I envy you since you are in for a first.
I:8615;2425;the transfer is far better than any I have seen for this movie.
I:8615;2426;ray is well worth owning and provides a level of detail I had never before seen.
I:8615;2427;It is possible to read signs in places like the airport and train station, the detail is that good.
I:8615;2428;popping color seen in 1960s vintage film/TV shows like The Prisoner and Star Trek which I also own and highly recommend.
I:8615;2429;NORTHWEST, REAR WINDOW and VERTIGO are my favorite Hitchcock films of the 50's.
I:8615;2430;Simple, Clean, Great Story Telling.
I:8615;2431;If you like Hitchcock Movies, this has the mystery, tension, and humor.
I:8615;2432;warner bros is to be congradulated on doing a excellent job.
I:8615;2433;although the color is slightly faded,the sound and 5.1 is very good.
I:8615;2434;it has a isolated score with the great bernard herrmann music.
I:8615;2435;ernest leyman does a good job of giving you his feelings on how he wrote the script and his relationship with hitch.
I:8615;2436;he knows exactly how he wants each scene to look.
I:8615;2437;"NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959)It's hard to believe that this is the 50th anniversary of Alfred Hitchcock's great romantic thriller starring a perfectly cast Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint and marvelous supporting work by a ""jealous"" James Mason, a ""gay"" Martin Landau and an always droll Leo G. Carroll as a cynical and unflappable government agent."
I:8615;2438;"but at the heart of this terrific film that never seems old lies the brilliant ""double."
I:8615;2439;lehman was inspired to maintain a tone of a sometimes funny but always thrilling and finally romantic plot that never lags and ends with the iconic climax that Hitchcock initially ordered.
I:8615;2440;screen hero, we can be brave, witty, loyal to something noble and be rewarded with true love.
I:8615;2441;lehman's great creation of a dapper movie hero who remains confident, debonair and witty is the model for the cinematic transition of James Bond from a lesser literary figure to a screen personae.
I:8615;2442;hitchcock was trained as an artist and his films are composed with an efficient eye to visualizing the emotion of the story with images first and dialogue second.
I:8615;2443;He worked out everything .
I:8615;2444;He said that when he was done with his story.
I:8615;2445;"bernard Herrmann's memorable score, certainly among his best, adds immensely to the tone of the film
I:8615;2446;For many, recalling certain films, it's Hermann's score that first comes to mind.
I:8615;2447;of documentary and a two fine new featurette that examines the cinema art of Hitchcock.
I:8615;2448;Great old time movie and good ending.
I:8615;2449;The print is beyond compare and the work performed in transferring this to blu.
I:8615;2450;ray format is a true work of art.
I:8615;2451;The scenery just comes to life and the imagery is so vivid and the colors, etc. are like nothing i've seen before while watching this film.
I:8615;2452;Kudos to all who brought us this anniversary edition.
I:8615;2453;A most welcome addition to my collection.
I:8615;2454;thriller to Hitchcock's more serious works, and it might not seem like it amounts to much.
I:8615;2455;But rarely do films entertain so intelligently, and so economically (even at 136 minutes, there isn't an unnecessary shot in the entire story).
I:8615;2456;the story, featuring Cary Grant as an innocent man mistaken for a secret agent and Eva Marie Saint as the seductive blonde with her own mysterious agenda, is delightfully twisted, yet despite its complexity it's never confusing or overwrought.
I:8615;2457;The script is not only perfectly paced but brilliantly witty (Grant in particular gets the best lines).
I:8615;2458;Almost every scene is memorable.
I:8615;2459;the hilarious drunk driving sequence, the tr s risqu dinner chat on the train, the crop.
I:8615;2460;dusting sequence, the auction, and of course, the chase across Mt. Rushmore.
I:8615;2461;all this in a magnificent package shot with Hitchcock's trademark precision and typically warped sense of humor.
I:8615;2462;this is one of those movies where every single element works just right.
I:8615;2463;the dialogue, the acting, the direction, the dazzling visuals, and Bernard Herrmann's pitch.
I:8615;2464;But for my money, it's the most enjoyable and satisfying movie Hitchcock ever made.
I:8615;2465;we all look back fondly on the classics in any medium.
I:8615;2466;I will give it one thing.
I:8615;2467;this one certainly does it up big.
I:8615;2468;It's Metrocolor, which is no three strip process to begin with, but this disc really improves it by really escalating the color values.
I:8615;2469;But there is a great new documentary, THE MASTER'S TOUCH, and the excellent AMERICAN EXPERIENCE biography of Grant.
I:8615;2470;Saw it in '59, and have been a major fan ever since.
I:8615;2471;No one (even now) can match his comedic timing and charm
I:8615;2472;I would watch this movie again and again.
I:8615;2473;Cary Grant and Eve Marie Saint are great.
I:8615;2474;I highly recommend this film!
I:8615;2475;It is reallyentertaining full of adventure!

I:8615;2480;It was a great gift and they really enjoyed receiving this item!
I:8615;2481;Right up there with the other Hitchcock masterpieces and probably the best, next to Vertigo, this a must see.
I:8615;2482;It's a classic, great actors, great plot.
I:8615;2483;One of Hitchcock's best, with one of the most famous scenes in movie history atop Mt. Rushmore.

I:8615;2485;Not only is this a classic, Blu.
I:8615;2486;I have one for myself and gave 1 as a gift.
I:8615;2487;whoever remastered this film deserves a gold medal, stunning color fidelity, hardly any artifacts or film grain.
I:8615;2488;One to keep for years and treasure!
I:8615;2489;I thought Eva Marie Saint was the most beautiful creature I had ever laid eyes on.
I:8615;2490;The scene where they meet in the dining car is amazing.
I:8615;2491;This movie is one of Hollywood's most enjoyable thrillers it is ever better in this State.
I:8615;2492;this movie is a all time classic.
I:8615;2493;I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the older classic movies.
I:8615;2494;North by Northwest is Alfred Hitchcock at his best.
I:8615;2495;it has a great cast, good suspense with many twists and turns.
I:8615;2496;Certainly one of the great classics of alltime and proof positive that they don't make movies like this anymore!

I:8615;2501;North By Northwest is an essential film for anyone who appreciates 20th century films by the masters.
I:8615;2502;A sparkling script and a perfect cast create a period piece that transcends its era with the device of mistaken identity coupled with a chance romance sparking a series of events that are at once believable and improbable.
I:8615;2503;North by Northwest, the classic Hitchcock thriller, remains a timeless thriller even for today's standards.
I:8615;2504;Cary Grant gives a humorous and believable part as he races to clear his name, and survive.
I:8615;2505;For anybody who loves the Hitchcock classics, this remains one of the best to this day.

I:8615;2532;As noted above classical Hitchcock drama and suspense with superb performances by all the other actors in the movie.
I:8615;2533;Really enjoyed seeing again for maybe the fifth time because it is so well done.
I:8615;2534;This immediately became one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:8615;2535;Intrigue, wit, and special effects that don't look like CGI garbage.
I:8615;2536;The title is from Hamlet, especially appropriate because of the film's plot movement from NYC to South Dakato and because of the protagonist.
I:8615;2537;Hitchcock has not only taken his British actor but his own British classic, The 39 Steps, and transformed them into cinematic icons as recognizably American as Mount Rushmore.
I:8615;2538;The protagonist's flight starts from the United Nations and threatens to take on an international theme until the thrilling and delightful climactic action sequence.
I:8615;2539;This is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie.
I:8615;2540;The acting by Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason and several other well known actors is great.
I:8615;2541;There are great action sequences at very well known places such as the UN building in New York, the presidential monument in South Dakota and in rural Illinois where Grant is chased by a crop duster airplane.
I:8615;2542;In addition, there is a long train ride on the New York Central's 20th Century Limited from New York to Chicago.
I:8615;2543;Loved the movie and the biography on Mr. Grant.
I:8615;2544;A really great movie with some great entertainers.
I:8615;2545;Its has an interesting movie plot and liked the way it was taken through especially for a movie of that era.
I:8615;2546;Hitchcock at his best!Cary Grant (One of Hitch's favorite actors) has never been beter.
I:8615;2547;Eva Marie Saint, the typical Hitchcock blonde, is also excellent.
I:8615;2548;The dialogue is witty and laced with mildly risque double entendres.
I:8615;2549;Classic Hitchcock set pieces (the crop duster sequence, the climb on Mt. Rushmore) add to the genuine suspense of the film.
I:8615;2550;altogether a great and very enteretaining movie!
I:8615;2551;This movie is a classic.
I:8615;2552;It is like a window into that time period, which is fantastic.
I:8615;2553;It works very well despite being slightly dated in its execution and acting .
I:8615;2554;I watched it on an airplane and it kept me engaged and entertained the entire time .
I:8615;2555;that means it's a winner in my book.
I:8615;2556;Great movie with wonderful scenery, good actors, and a thrilling plot.
I:8615;2557;But that's fine, it's still a lot of fun.
I:8615;2558;All doves together in a crescendo of simple if deadly delights for the viewer.
I:8615;2559;I keep saying that but it's true.
I:8615;2560;An exceptional performance by Grant plus plenty of plot twists (which are mixed with tongue.
I:8615;2561;cheek humour) make this one of Hitch's most entertaining films (some say his best).
I:8615;2562;Laserdisc includes letterboxing, digital soundtrack, Hitchcock interview, production and publicity photos, storyboards and the original trailer.
I:8615;2563;I so wish they made movies like this today, it's a fast paced and fun thriller from beginning to end!
I:8615;2564;It stars one of Hollywood's greatest leading men, Cary Grant, along with James Mason, Eva Marie Saint, Martin Landau, and the delightful Jesse Royce Landis.
I:8615;2565;This movie is so much fun to watch that you can view it over and over again and never tire of it.
I:8615;2566;Each time you'll discover something new to appreciate, and WOW what a musical score by Bernard Herrmann!!!
I:8615;2567;"Hitchcock has done ""The mistaken identity"" theme many times before, but with this great cast, great writing, great photography and Hitchcock's superb direction (often imitated but never surpassed), it seems as fresh as ever."
I:8615;2568;it definitely stands the test of time!P.
I:8615;2569;ray transfer is great, and there are documentaries on Grant, the making of the film, and more!
I:8615;2570;Cary Grant is just spectacular in this film, Eva Marie Saint is tops too.
I:8615;2571;Grant is so funny in the auction scene, it's laugh out loud good times.
I:8615;2572;"Hitchcock had a good 5 year run here, between ""Rear Window"" and ""North By Northwest""."
I:8615;2573;One of hollywoods top 5 movies!
I:8615;2574;I am in the process of building my old movie collection and this is a fine start.
I:8615;2575;One of the greatest Hitchcock movies of all time.
I:8615;2576;Super cast, great storyline and Mount Rushmore.
I:8615;2577;"Both men were at their artistic zenith when they made this superb comic thriller, which screenwriter Ernest Lehman promised would be ""the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures."""
I:8615;2578;Grant's screwball humor and dark charm make him the ideal Hitchcock leading man .
I:8615;2579;complemented by excellent performances from Eva Marie Saint, James Mason and Martin Landau.
I:8615;2580;notch production in terms of set design and matte work.
I:8615;2581;No break in the action, great plot with even better acting.
I:8615;2582;All in all an enjoyable movie.
I:8615;2583;Amazing when you blend great acting with a great script the result is a classic!
I:8615;2584;A classic piece with all the charm and quirk of the Hollywood productions in that era.
I:8615;2585;P. s. Hitchcock's presence in the first minute of the movie is an adorable, pleasant surprise.
I:8615;2586;It reminds me of a movie version comparison I once read between the lyrics of Justin Beiber and Frank Sinatra.
I:8615;2587;This movie ages quite well.
I:8615;2588;The lush backgroud throughout, and the cast make this one of his best!
I:8615;2589;I love this movie, and I recommend it highly.
I:8615;2590;One of Alfred Hitchcock's best films.
I:8615;2591;Cary Grant is outstanding as usual as a man being mistaken for a spy.
I:8615;2592;This is Gary's best movie as far as I am concerned!
I:8615;2593;It is a thriller with a lot of romance, and you get to look at Cary Grant for several hours.
I:8615;2594;I love all Cary grant movies.
I:8615;2595;If you have, it's worth seeing again.
I:8615;2596;"Perfect performances, great cinematography, and delightful plot
I:8615;2597;This was an action packed and fun movie to watch!
I:8615;2598;I will most likely watch this again in the future :)
I:8615;2599;Nice to see what once was.
I:8615;2600;The acting was great in those days but the special affects and production is much better today.
I:8615;2601;It has humor, drama and suspense.
I:8615;2602;I have loved this movie when I frist saw it, but I am one of Cary Grant's BBIGGEST FANS!!!!
I:8615;2603;I have loved him since I was a kid!
I:8615;2604;Very well done and very well acted.
I:8615;2605;This is one classic you really should have in your collection.
I:8615;2606;The two new documentary features that are included in this 2.
I:8615;2607;disc edition include one on Hitchcock's style and one on Cary Grant.
I:8615;2608;Great movie and shows clearly.
I:8615;2609;One of his best performances.
I:8615;2610;a must see movie to add to your collection.
I:8615;2611;Another great one by the master of suspense.
I:8615;2612;Love Cary Grant's sense of humor throughout and Hitch's choice for cool blondes.
I:8615;2613;You know from the moment you see Saul Bass's marvellous opening credit sequence that this is going to be a great movie.
I:8615;2614;Add Bernard Herman's classic music score and you are immediately on a great rollercoaster of a film.
I:8615;2615;one ever look better at this age than Grant.
I:8615;2616;James Mason, Eva Marie Saint and many others play great supporting roles.
I:8615;2617;There are many famous sequences, the crop spraying, the fight on Mount Rushmore its all very well done, cleverly written and directed with Hitchcocks usual style and wit.
I:8615;2618;the extras are very good on this disc.
I:8615;2619;There is full commentary by the screenwriter Ernest Lehman and a 39min documentary.
I:8615;2620;NORTH BY NORTHWEST is automatically a classic with the acting by Cary Grant (his fourth and final film with Hitchcock), Eva Maria Saint, James Mason, Leo G. Carroll (another one of Hithcock's favorites), and young Martin Landau (in his film debut), the amazing set pieces (the UN murder, the cropduster sequence, and the climax atop Mt. Rushmore), Bernard Hermann's music score, and the classic work of the camera by the Master of Suspense.
I:8615;2621;It's also a note of interest for 007 fans (like myself).
I:8615;2622;It's a Hitchcock film so as usual he does a masterful job of weaving a suspenseful story together.
I:8615;2623;Unlike many movies from this era they jump right into the action.
I:8615;2624;Even modern movie goers will enjoy this movie thanks to it's quick entry into the action and great story.
I:8615;2625;This one never gets old!
I:8615;2626;Alfred Hitchcock was a master story weaver.
I:8615;2627;I love the older movies.
I:8615;2628;I'm a younger generation who appreciates the older movies.
I:8615;2629;This is by far a classic.
I:8615;2630;A classic by the measure of any yardstick!
I:8615;2631;He arrives at a dinner meeting with some clients, excuses himself to make a last minute call, and before he knows it is mistaken for a government spy named George Kaplan .
I:8615;2632;It is the perfect story of a man in an already barely.
I:8615;2633;Especially when neither side is overly concerned with your survival?The digital transfer of this treasure of a film does it proper justice: it is like watching a new film set in the period (early 50's) that it depicts.
I:8615;2634;The Bernard Herrmann score crackles with energy and sounds best at high volume.
I:8615;2635;The restoration team is to be applauded for their efforts in maintaining the life of a film that feels still very much alive today, with its plot twists and subtly subversive messages about the manipulative nature of societal forces.
I:8615;2636;The main thing that set Hitchcock's work apart from other filmmakers of his time was its extremes of entertainment and thought provocation: his attitude, in other words.
I:8615;2637;Even in a lighthearted work such as this, you had something to take home with you.
I:8615;2638;Definitely a film worth owning.
I:8615;2639;This is a great old fashioned movie.
I:8615;2640;In my opinion the most perfect and stylish icon of the 50's.
I:8615;2641;Each actor is superb in each role.
I:8615;2642;I noticed the crisp and vibrant image and the color palette shines in this film as well.
I:8615;2643;Pluse it is Hitchcock at his very best.
I:8615;2644;This Alfred Hitchcock film is a definite classic.
I:8615;2645;When Thornhill starts his day, he is just a regular businessman.
I:8615;2646;eva Marie Saint plays Eve Kendall who is Thornhill's love interest.
I:8615;2647;the action ranges from the United Nations building in Manhattan to the top of Mt. Rushmore as well as several others in between.
I:8615;2648;This is a very good show that is well worth watching.
I:8615;2649;This 50th anniversary edition is a must for and fan of the movie, or of Hitchcock in general, and it's even on Blu.
I:8615;2650;ray!The book pages and whole set up draws you in and looks beautiful on shelf.
I:8615;2651;Included are many poster pictures and behind the set photos and a synopsis and summery of this amazing movie.
I:8615;2652;ray menus can achieve with time spent working on it.
I:8615;2653;Hands down on of Hitchcock's best and my favorite of his films.
I:8615;2654;The famous crop duster and Mount Rushmore scenes a breathtaking, Hitch himself would have been stunned I think with the depth of the visuals.
I:8615;2655;A masterful use of Hitchcock's MacGuffin, or a device that drives the plot but either is never fully revealed or does not exist.
I:8615;2656;I won't say more for the sake of those who have never seen the film but suffice to say that everything in this film is smartly and tightly done, from the performances, to the cinematography and as goes with out saying the direction of one of the, if not the greatest director Hollywood has ever seen.
I:8615;2657;The added commentaries and comments are of great interest to Hitchcock fans.
I:8615;2658;The above dialogue is found near the end of this classic suspense movie that is even today unparalleled in producing an optimal combination of plot, humour, action, mystery, and intrigue without resorting to clich s.
I:8615;2659;"It was directed by ""The Master of Suspense,"" the great Alfred Hitchcock."
I:8615;2660;"I should also mention that he ""visits"" Mount Rushmore and gets up."
I:8615;2661;close to the faces of former U. s. presidents (Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt, and Lincoln) carved on the mountain.
I:8615;2662;the debonair Cary Grant effectively carries this movie.
I:8615;2663;(This was Grants fourth and final teaming with Hitchcock.)
I:8615;2664;another key ingredient of this movie is its background music.
I:8615;2665;This fantastic orchestral score was composed by Bernard Herrmann.
I:8615;2666;It effectively adds to each scene.
I:8615;2667;There are actually many theories for its origin.
I:8615;2668;It has eight interesting extras.
I:8615;2669;Recommendation: watch this movie on as large of a screen as possible.
I:8615;2670;Alfred Hitchcock goes back to one of his most popular themes: mistaken identity.
I:8615;2671;A wonderful comic romp which has the sophisticated style and polish that you'd expect in the best of Hitchcock films, North By Northwest does not disappoint.
I:8615;2672;Grant is cool and smooth as the ad executive on the run and Saint is terrific as the mysterious blond.
I:8615;2673;As the head of the foreign spy ring, James Mason is properly menacing, as is Martin Landau, his right hand man.
I:8615;2674;to fill a dozen films, North is an incredibly fun ride.
I:8615;2675;Any more plot details will just spoil the fun.
I:8615;2676;As with the best Hitchcock films, North is as fresh and sophisticated today as when it was first released.
I:8615;2677;Classic movie with updated view.
I:8615;2678;I have always enjoyed this film and now even moreso.
I:8615;2679;much of Hitchcock's reputation as a genius of suspense is due to his brilliant collaboration with Bernard Herrmann, one of the most important composers of the 20th century.
I:8615;2680;Visually, it is colorful, vibrant, and stylish, but I think it's the MUSIC that carries us through the picture emotionally.
I:8615;2681;The effect of Cary Grant's drunk driving scene is more than doubled by Herrmann's clever score.
I:8615;2682;the visuals are great, but the actual suspense derives significantly from Herrmann's music.
I:8615;2683;there is an artistic chemistry between Hitchcock and Herrmann, as director and composer, rivaled by none save perhaps the partnership of Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone ( The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly, Once Upon A Time In The West, The Mission, ).
I:8615;2684;Together, these men created works more powerful than anything they created separately.
I:8615;2685;The picture is absolutely GORGEOUS, and the soundtrack is crystal clear, allowing Herrmann's score to really stand out.
I:8615;2686;There is also a fine making.
I:8615;2687;There are a few extras, there's a nice book built in to the set and the film looks good.
I:8615;2688;the movie itself, while not my personal favorite Hitchcock, holds up nicely because it looks so good.
I:8615;2689;Cary Grant is excellent in his role as the ad man suddenly faced with disaster due to a case of mistaken identity.
I:8615;2690;The crop dusting sequence is top notch and the fight at Mt. Rushmore is well done though the segment still remains, to me at least, not the best use of effects.
I:8615;2691;North By Northwest is one of the great spy films.
I:8615;2692;NBN features an excellent cast.
I:8615;2693;The leading players are perfect: Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Martin Landau, Leo G. Carrol, and Jesse Royce Landis.
I:8615;2694;Mason is excellent as the suave and evil Phillip Vandamm but Martin Landau is particularly creepy as his henchman Leonard.
I:8615;2695;Nearly forty years later, he would win an Oscar for Ed Wood, but NBN is the real film that featured Landau at his finest hour.
I:8615;2696;There are few actors who look as naturally spooky as Landau.
I:8615;2697;With his gaunt frame and haunted blue eyes, Landau is the perfect heavy.
I:8615;2698;the cast is only one of the factors that make NBN a great movie.
I:8615;2699;The film offers a perfect blend of comedy and suspense.
I:8615;2700;one of the greatest spy movies of all time.
I:8615;2701;I have already seen this movie at least six times and can stand to see it several times more.
I:8615;2702;The restoration of this classic on its 50th Anniversary and its transfer to Blu Ray is simply wonderful.
I:8615;2703;Cary Grant is every bit as good as I had always hoped he'd be in this classic film.
I:8615;2704;North By Northwest serves as the basis for many other modern films that have since added additional special effects that significantly take away from the story and actor's skill.
I:8615;2705;if you liked this movie, watch the following:.
I:8615;2706;Using superb acting and tight directing, the intrigue and suspense are top notch.
I:8615;2707;A must see for movie lovers.
I:8615;2708;Hitchcock's best movie by far.
I:8615;2709;A classic that's always worth watching and will always keep you in your seat.
I:8615;2710;This classic is every bit as good as the latest Multi million dollar blockbuster.
I:8615;2711;North by Northwest is Hitchcock at his finest.
I:8615;2712;It combines a bit of humor, espionage, train escapades and love to create a thoroughly entertaining movie that can be watched again and again.
I:8615;2713;Along the way he meets a beautiful girl (Eve Marie Saint), who is really a double agent.
I:8615;2714;Preposterous as the plot sounds, it is all woven together to create a believeable tale of the time period.
I:8615;2715;In addition to entertainment value, North by Northwest is a testament to fashion of the late fifties and the golden age of train travel.
I:8615;2716;I my opinion this is one of the best Cary Grant moves.
I:8615;2717;And Hitchcock direction was awesome.
I:8615;2718;This is one of my favorite Hitchcock movies.
I:8615;2719;Great plot and movie locations.
I:8615;2720;Forgot how great this movie is!!
I:8615;2721;Its really is one of Hitchcock's best .
I:8615;2722;kept me on the edge of my seat.
I:8615;2723;One of the best classic films ever.
I:8615;2724;Casting was perfect here, because without Grant, it would just be another Mistaken Identity movie.
I:8615;2725;On the entire list of top 100 movies of the century I think this was well deserving of every vote it got.
I:8615;2726;I truly enjoyed this video.
I:8615;2727;The actors were great and there is lots of suspense.
I:8615;2728;In the style of Alfred Hitchcock, the plot twists and turns through the story line.
I:8615;2729;The genius of Hitchcock shows through in another escape, in dressing him as a 'red cap' and walking him past the security guards.
I:8615;2730;I would watch this movie again when I'm in the mood for a romantic adventure that succeeds against all odds.
I:8615;2731;ray edition makes it a whole new movie like I've never seen before.
I:8615;2732;I can now see things and places I never saw in the original edition.
I:8615;2733;The initial situation that the lead character, played by Cary Grant, finds himself in is believable and somewhat hazardous.
I:8615;2734;An exciting movie with fine photography.
I:8615;2735;My husband and I love Hitchcock movies, and this has turned out to be a favorite for us.
I:8615;2736;just the right amount of suspense and mystery to keep you hooked.
I:8615;2737;From a good film for many occasions to a memorable plot to some classic scenes, this film is worth owning.
I:8615;2738;This is a great movie!
I:8615;2739;I love Alfred Hitchcock films and I love Cary Grant so this was just another addition to my collection!
I:8615;2740;Cary Grant at his best and Alfred Hitchcock at the top of his game.
I:8615;2741;Representing the culmination of this fascination with innocents on the run, this film is one of the finest comic adventure films of all time, one with the pace of a juggernaught.
I:8615;2742;the cast is one for the ages.
I:8615;2743;Cary Grant (along with Jimmy Stewart, THE great Hitchcock hero) is superb, especially in his exasperated comic reactions to his rediculous predicaments (catch his drunken reaction as the wheels of his car slide off the side of the road!)
I:8615;2744;Eva Marie Saint is wonderful as this film's Hitchcock ice princess and James Mason virtually defines the classic urbane villian.
I:8615;2745;"The images are sharp and clean
I:8615;2746;Bernard Hermann's great score has never sounded better.
I:8615;2747;the making of documentary is fascinating, especially for those of us who are Hitchcock fanatics.
I:8615;2748;This movie my husband saw on a tv show as a great movie.
I:8615;2749;Some fun and interesting scenes.
I:8615;2750;It is still one of the best movies of all time.
I:8615;2751;Having it available on Amazon makes it a joy to watch again and again.
I:8615;2752;I bought a copy at Amazon (a great company!)
I:8615;2753;good movie, good menus, bad discs.
I:8615;2754;rate action/mystery film that stands as one of the greatest films of all time.
I:8615;2755;suave Cary Grant and the striking Eva Marie Saint star in a movie that has all the elements we've come to expect from Hitch: mistaken identity, the intriguing blonde, murder, and deception.
I:8615;2756;I wasn't around in 1959, but watching a movie like this in the theatre had to have been such an incredible experience.
I:8615;2757;You are literally hooked from the first frame.
I:8615;2758;The picture is the best.
I:8615;2759;N by NW is also in 5.1, and while the sound won't necessarily rock your system, it's a pretty decent soundtrack for a movie this old.
I:8615;2760;I saw this on a friend's recommendation, and I'm kicking myself for not discovering it sooner.
I:8615;2761;I repeat: it's one of the greatest films of all time.
I:8615;2762;"Sure, they all give film good reviews, but I also read comments such as, ""as good as The Matrix,"" and ""interesting despite all the talking."""
I:8615;2763;Hitchcock and collaborator Ernest Lehman turned out a film that was a thoroughly thought.
I:8615;2764;Contrast this to something like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which though a wonderful film in its own way is filled with scenes that don't really lead anywhere or make sense.
I:8615;2765;There is something about the way great filmmakers and writers respected audience intelligence back in the days of Hitch and Lehman (and Lean, and Attenborough, and Wise and Wilder and Wyler and Kazan, etc.) that's missing today.
I:8615;2766;It looks stunning, without a single nick or scratch and no sign of fading.
I:8615;2767;style technicolor belies the age.
I:8615;2768;"The Dolby digital 5.1 sound is crystal clear, with a very vivid and dynamic remastering of Bernard Herrmann's kinetic score (also available as a separate ""music only"" track if you wish) and some real sound."
I:8615;2769;one features Hitch himself in a tongue.
I:8615;2770;and both are in good shape for their age.
I:8615;2771;There's also an anamorphic B/W trailer made for television.
I:8615;2772;It drags in places, but it's interesting to have.
I:8615;2773;(I'd love to have a second commentary track from a film historian as well.)
I:8615;2774;Yet it's more than just entertaining.
I:8615;2775;"In that regard the film is plenty ""realistic"" and plenty powerful."
I:8615;2776;The opening credits are some of the best in Movie history.
I:8615;2777;Even though I know the movie nearly line by line I love to watch in again and again.
I:8615;2778;An 'everyman' locked in a battle with the unknown.
I:8615;2779;Great acting by all the cast.
I:8615;2780;Cary Grant usually fulfills all expectations and is perfect in the role of a self.
I:8615;2781;Sometimes we look at the old and wonder how something that once was so great and magnificent could now look a little tarnished and worn.
I:8615;2782;this is my favorite hitchcock movie.
I:8615;2783;it is very interesting to see how hitchcockpulls off each scene.
I:8615;2784;it has lots of action and it keeps you interested until the very end.
I:8615;2785;i love alfred hitchcock movies because of all the suspense and drama he creates and this one has it all.
I:8615;2786;"Alfred Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"" is simply one of the finest American films ever made."
I:8615;2787;It is a great example of the skill and mastery that Hitchcock exhibited throughout his career.
I:8615;2788;Along the way, he meets Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), a beautiful blond, and she becomes his ally.
I:8615;2789;simplicity is the key to this film and its extraordinary success.
I:8615;2790;We don't learn anything we don't need to know, and, frankly, it is most refreshing.
I:8615;2791;He is involved in the Advertising industry, that much is clear, and it helps set up his lifestyle and his character quickly and plainly.
I:8615;2792;Each of these acts produces a view of the item in question for the audience.
I:8615;2793;Thornhill and his mother (the very funny Jessie Royce Landis, actually only a year older than Grant), visit Kaplan's hotel room at the Plaza.
I:8615;2794;He puts it back on the desk and goes about his business.
I:8615;2795;Again, we know which picture it is, not because we have seen it again and again, but because Hitch has allowed us to see it once and we are intelligent enough to know what they are talking about.
I:8615;2796;Vertigo was reportedly a very personal film for Hitchcock.
I:8615;2797;He put a lot of energy into the film was disconcerted when it did not receive the critical praise or box office that he felt it deserved.
I:8615;2798;This is the first time that Hitchcock took the emphasis away from thrills and went for a more cerebral kind of suspense.
I:8615;2799;It is a beautiful film and one of his best, but I can imagine that he was exhausted.
I:8615;2800;It is pretty clear that Hitchcock was at the stage where he wanted to experiment a little.
I:8615;2801;They talked a bit and then Hitchcock remarked that he always wanted to make a film with a chase across Mt. Rushmore.
I:8615;2802;"This single idea prompted Lehman to come up with, as he puts it, ""The Hitchcock film to end all Hitchcock films""."
I:8615;2803;NbNW certainly explores territory that the director traveled before, but he brings a mastery to the work that sets this film head and shoulders above the rest.
I:8615;2804;It certainly helps that Lehman created some of the best dialogue ever written.
I:8615;2805;Thornhill's relationship with Kendall is erotic, intense and takes many turns, some of which take the story in new directions.
I:8615;2806;Vandamm and his henchman, Leonard, have a relationship that causes more friction between Vandamm and Kendall.
I:8615;2807;The relationships in the film are the most intricately plotted part of the production.
I:8615;2808;cary Grant has always been one of my favorite actors.
I:8615;2809;He accomplished in his career what people like Schwarzenneger and Stallone are trying to do today.
I:8615;2810;Grant had great success in many genres.
I:8615;2811;Of course, he was a handsome leading man in many romantic films.
I:8615;2812;"He also had great success in screwball comedies (""Arsenic and Old Lace"" and ""Bringing Up Baby""), War films (both serious and comedic) and thrillers (primarily, films he made with Hitchcock, but also notably ""Charade"", one of his last films)."
I:8615;2813;He was versatile and enjoyed a long career.
I:8615;2814;Someone suggested Grant and Grant received The Cary Grant Role to End All Cary Grant Roles.
I:8615;2815;Grant is known for his great looks, his sexy accent, his suave character.
I:8615;2816;These all fit perfectly in the role of Roger Thornhill.
I:8615;2817;Saint's portrayal of Eve Kendall pretty much defines what this type of character would be in hundreds of other films.
I:8615;2818;It is a difficult balance and Saint achieves it beautifully.
I:8615;2819;She and Grant are so sexy together that it makes the films produced today look tame.
I:8615;2820;In every one of their scenes, they are fully clothed, yet manage to create more sparks than any scene in which the actors are partially naked and simulating actual sex.
I:8615;2821;One of the sexiest kisses ever is captured in this film.
I:8615;2822;His voice is so rich and full of character that pretty much anything he says can be viewed as threatening and menacing.
I:8615;2823;He seems the perfect characterization of a spy about to sell government secrets.
I:8615;2824;martin Landau, in one of his first film roles, creates the role of Leonard, Vandamm's sidekick.
I:8615;2825;There are slight homosexual overtones to the character which fit beautifully and help to further complicate the relationships in the film.
I:8615;2826;"hitchcock is a masterful director, but in the case of ""NbNW"", he had three very notable contributors."
I:8615;2827;Ernest Lehman created a screenplay that is masterful in its simplicity.
I:8615;2828;He created a story that is suspenseful, memorable and efficient.
I:8615;2829;The dialogue in the film is perhaps the most memorable.
I:8615;2830;When Kendall and Thornhill are talking in the dining car, everything they say will eventually lead to their romantic evening.
I:8615;2831;The dialogue is rich and entertaining.
I:8615;2832;"frequent Hitchcock contributor Bernard Hermann created one of his most rousing scores for ""North By Northwest""."
I:8615;2833;John Williams and Ennio Morricone seem determined to prove their worth, overlaying every frame of film with music that is sure to evoke an emotion.
I:8615;2834;He and his team recreated Mount Rushmore in a studio and did a very good job.
I:8615;2835;Just a few brief moments of the chase reveal that it is shot on a sound stage, remarkable really when you consider that none of it was actually shot on the monument.
I:8615;2836;the documentary included with the film is a treat in some ways and disappointing in others.
I:8615;2837;It is great to see Eva Marie Saint again, very beautiful, narrating the documentary.
I:8615;2838;It takes us step by step through the film and the sequence in which it was made.
I:8615;2839;Some great production photos are used to illustrate.
I:8615;2840;North By Northwest is my favorite Hitchcock film and certainly my favorite film.
I:8615;2841;It is the first film I remember seeing in a movie theater, on the big screen.
I:8615;2842;It is a perfect example of the magic that Hollywood can create.
I:8615;2843;It is the perfect example of what Hitchcock could create, frightening us, thrilling us, captivating us.
I:8615;2844;This was one of the movies that got me hooked.
I:8615;2845;This one is very high on my list.
I:8615;2846;I love Alfred Hitchcock movies and I love how he keeps you guessing who is involved with the crime and who isn't
I:8615;2847;As good today as it was in 1959 when i was ten years old.
I:8615;2848;Cary Grant was never better and James Mason and Martin Landau are great villains.
I:8615;2849;Can always find something new every time i see it
I:8615;2850;This witty, slick thriller is an iconic classic in motion picture history.
I:8615;2851;The cinematography is legendary, the one.
I:8615;2852;liners are infinitely quotable, and the chemistry between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint (pant, pant) is magical.
I:8615;2853;see for classic movie buffs.
I:8615;2854;What is to be said about a classic like this other than it stands the test of time, all great films do:.)
I:8615;2855;This movie is worth watching.
I:8615;2856;studded romantic comedy adventure is the best escapist entertainment there is.
I:8615;2857;examining this initial action sheds light on what's so delightful about the entire movie.
I:8615;2858;the script, peppered with sexual innuendo, suits Cary Grant's sly, sexy style.
I:8615;2859;James Mason as his sophisticated nemesis is a perfect match.
I:8615;2860;working on this gorgeous, big budget, big star production must have made Hitchcock yearn for simplicity because he followed it with the $800,000 Psycho.
I:8615;2861;Always enjoy the Hitchcock movies in particular and the old classics in general.
I:8615;2862;This one was really good.
I:8615;2863;our teenager also did enjoy in spite of been oldies.
I:8615;2864;Slightly dated but one great thriller.
I:8615;2865;Hitchcock can't be beat he brings out the best by story and his actors
I:8615;2866;I have always loved Cary Grant, he doesn't disappoint in this Hitchcock thriller.
I:8615;2867;it takes you twists and turns and has the Grant humor.
I:8615;2868;packaged with plenty of goodies inside: A music.
I:8615;2869;I really enjoy watching old movies and this is one of my favorites and Cary Grant provided an exellent performance!
I:8615;2870;It is nice to see an old movie that has a good plot without all the violence, blood and gore.
I:8615;2871;It is alternatively funny, thrilling, suspenseful, and has good acting and, of course, excellent directing and artful cinematography.
I:8615;2872;"I'd love to live in the house on the cliff side, I'd love to ""ride the train"" with Eva Marie Saint."
I:8615;2873;To be witty and urbane and bag hot babes is paid for with some spies and more spies.
I:8615;2874;Our family loves this movie!
I:8615;2875;We had to find something else to add to our basket for the free super saver shipping and this was one of the first movies I looked for because we love it!
I:8615;2876;We love Cary Grant And we love Alfred Hitchcock movies!
I:8615;2877;Excellent movie with a young and handsome Cary Grant and a young and beautiful Eva Marie Saint.
I:8615;2878;No introduction required for this one: Alfred Hitchcock's is one of the most popular classic of all time, and it certainly deserves to be so.
I:8615;2879;Watching NORTH BY NORTHWEST is a pure joy of cinema.
I:8615;2880;It's thrilling, exciting and hilarious.
I:8615;2881;You just get carried away with the master's perfect art of storytelling.
I:8615;2882;The best way to understand this particular film is to just enjoy it.
I:8615;2883;I must congratulate MGM for keeping such a good care of the original elements.
I:8615;2884;sharp (one great virtue of this now almost extinct process) and the colors are vibrant, deeply saturated and very rich.
I:8615;2885;drop paintings, matpaintings and process shots are intact and are so effective.
I:8615;2886;In fact, when properly done, the old techniques look as good as the recent digital CGI effects, maybe better.
I:8615;2887;Plus, I have to admit the new soundtrack REALLY brings out the magnificent orchestration of Bernard Herrmann's beautifully composed score!Herrmann was one of the very few film composer who did his own orchestration.
I:8615;2888;He was an uncompromised artist.
I:8615;2889;By the way, you can enjoy the richness of the score with the music.
I:8615;2890;an added enjoyment is the original theatrical trailer featuring Mr. hitchcock himself, which was not on the previous LD release.
I:8615;2891;It even tells you how Cary Grant charged 15 cents to every autograph he gave to the fans!
I:8615;2892;Critics and scholars (including myself, I must admit) often talk only about big scenes and flashy camera works which catch your eyes at the first moment you see them, but Lehman made me think how subtle a director's genius is, and that makes the whole difference from all the poorly made films that we see so often in the thriller genre today.
I:8615;2893;This is a classic that everyone should see at least once.
I:8615;2894;Cary Grant is awesome and the plot twists and turns are great.
I:8615;2895;As you might expect Alfred Hitchcock, master of suspense,.
I:8615;2896;still keeps us sitting on the edge of our seats.
I:8615;2897;He was a charming, funny, romantic and just a nice guy in every movie I've ever seen him in.
I:8615;2898;In what maybe his best American movie (and yes, better than Vertigo and rear Window), Hitchcock uses his arsenal of trademarks (an exciting score for Hermann, romance, spy thriller motifs, and exotic locales) to assembly the best man who knows too much (or little) movie.
I:8615;2899;A bit of the original was therefore cut.
I:8615;2900;the 50th anniversary edition added grear extras.
I:8615;2901;NORTH BY NORTHWEST is simply one of the finest motion pictures ever made.
I:8615;2902;It enthralls in every way: the script, acting, plot, theme, music, photography, and design of the film transcend time and place.
I:8615;2903;with admiration for the director's craft and empathy for the story's beleaguered protagonist.
I:8615;2904;I was in love with Cary Grant ,who I still think is the best male actor ever.
I:8615;2905;"This is one of the best movies that actually defined the whole ""thriller"" genre: an innocent layperson gets sucked into a plot and has difficulty in understanding what's happening to him."
I:8615;2906;the film is full of iconic images like the dust.
I:8615;2907;cary Grant offers one of his top.
I:8615;2908;notch performances as a handsome leading man on the run who always has time for a wisecrack or two.
I:8615;2909;A MUST see film for movie fans of all ages.
I:8615;2910;Typical Hichock, great story, outstanding acting and of course the main scene.
I:8615;2911;The way the story builds is outstanding.
I:8615;2912;We love Alfred Hitchcock moviesI think this is his best work .
I:8615;2913;funny and serious, very suspenseful, great acting
I:8615;2914;this movie is awesome i watch it every now and thenthe picture is great on it the shipping was quick
I:8615;2915;This gives the film tension and thrills, fascinating the viewer.
I:8615;2916;This film is famous for some dramatic scenes like the cropduster's attack, the witty escape from the auction house ,the fight on Mt. rushmore and so on.
I:8615;2917;Hitchcock didn't forget to add some humor with his outstanding suspense and tension and Cary Grant is talented enough to deliver his lines.
I:8615;2918;Eve Kandall is also very attractive for romance during the danger which makes the film richer.
I:8615;2919;I liked it it was the a wonderful gift my boy friend adores this move and it was at a reasonable price
I:8615;2920;I've only seen this on worn prints or broadcast TV and knew it was great.
I:8615;2921;One of the most entertaining films has gotten the treatment it deserves.
I:8615;2922;'North by Northwest' is a classic and definitely worth watching.
I:8615;2923;A spellbinding adventure from beginning to end.
I:8615;2924;Loved the light comedy touches.
I:8615;2925;Just the right touch of comedy, mystery and romance .
I:8615;2926;"Note: Your ""helpful"" votes are appreciated."
I:8615;2927;Longer reviews are best read after seeing the movie.
I:8615;2928;Just talking around a subject can be very sensual.
I:8615;2929;This is one of the ten best movies ever made.
I:8615;2930;It has stood the test of time very well.
I:8615;2931;It has the classic Hitchcock tropes .
I:8615;2932;the innocent man thrust into mortal peril, the femme fatale with a gradually revealed back story, the cliff.
I:8615;2933;All of this embodied in the suavity of Cary Grant and the cool beauty of Eva Marie Saint, and shot in spectacular locales, makes for welcome entertainment.
I:8615;2934;def TV was gorgeous, much better than I expected.
I:8615;2935;The Amazon servers and my high.
I:8615;2936;This is Still one of the Best Movies that Hitch' made.
I:8615;2937;Well acted and well directed.
I:8615;2938;This movie can still make the hair on the back of you neck rise.
I:8615;2939;One of Hitch's best and most effortless suspense movies has the benefit of a brilliant, witty script by the late Ernest Lehman and star performances by Cary Grant as the put upon Thornhill (whose initials are R. o. t. a nice representation of what's happened to his world), the sexy Eva Maire Saint, the menacing Martin Landau (in his first film role)and the charming but deadly James Mason.
I:8615;2940;There's so many twists and turns in this hairraising classic that you have to see the film to appreciate the beauty of the direction, writing and performances.
I:8615;2941;this new spruced up digital transfer looks terrific.
I:8615;2942;The soundtrack has been beautifully remixed for 5.1 Dolby Digital.
I:8615;2943;While the soundtrack can't completely take advantage of the remix, it sounds terrific.
I:8615;2944;There's also a really good feaurette on the making of the film featuring Landau, Saint, Lehman and Patricia Hitchcock.
I:8615;2945;the inclusion of Ernest Lehman's nicely detailed audio commentary is a nice extra as well although it's clear that some of the same comments show up again in the documentary.
I:8615;2946;Bernard Herrmann's marvelous music score is isolated on one track so that music fans can hear the original score in all its glory.
I:8615;2947;north by Northwest was the next to last in a string of classics directed by Hitch during the 60's (Hitch only made one movie in the 60's that comes close to his best films and that's the brilliant, dark The Birds).
I:8615;2948;After a string of great movies and box office smashes including Rear Window, To Catch A Thief, Vertigo, The Trouble With Harry, Strangers On A Train and other lesser known works, North By Northwest was a brilliant conclusion to a decade that showed enormous growth in Hitch's directing ability and style.
I:8615;2949;Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill has one of those in Alfred Hitchcock's renowned thriller.
I:8615;2950;Throw in a dangerous villain (James Mason) and his mistress (Eva Marie Saint), superb direction from Hitchcock (Who makes a brief cameo in the film's beginning) and an exciting Bernard Hermann music score, you have yourself quite a ride.
I:8615;2951;But the extras are really what set this above.
I:8615;2952;"A theatrical trailer, a ""Hitchcock Trailer"", a TV spot, a photo gallery, cast and crew bios and an isolated version of Hermann's music score complete this excellent package."
I:8615;2953;"whether you are a fan of one of the stars or of Hitchcock, admire great films or just like entertaining movies, ""North by Northwest"" should be added to your personal library."
I:8615;2954;"favorite quote:""I have two ex."
I:8615;2955;The crop dusting plane, steamy train romance, and Rushmore scenes are unforgettable.
I:8615;2956;This was a great movie, no wonder it is a classic.
I:8615;2957;We had a movie night and it was a great success.
I:8615;2958;The scenery is worth the watching in and of itself, and the acting is as it should be.
I:8615;2959;This is one of the classic Aflred Hitchcock movies with Cary Grant.
I:8615;2960;We both enjoy watching this movie.
I:8615;2961;"So pleasurable on many levels
I:8615;2962;Each scene is a masterpiece of film.
I:8615;2963;I've recommended this movie to people in their twenties who had never seen it.
I:8615;2964;This is the best Hitchcock movie hands down.
I:8615;2965;Great actors, great locations, great story line, great music.
I:8615;2966;It eclipses all previous ones (at least, those I've seen), including the well.
I:8615;2967;"NbNW has never been a particularly ""good."
I:8615;2968;The scene in which Thornhill and the Professor walk toward the plane is perhaps the finest example of rear projection you'll ever see.
I:8615;2969;The sound is fantastically good .
I:8615;2970;"good"", you need to hear this."
I:8615;2971;Male skin tones are excessively warm, even yellowish.
I:8615;2972;This is fine for Cary Grant .
I:8615;2973;"as is becoming increasingly common for ""important"" movies, the disk is encased in a souvenir book."
I:8615;2974;"A classic, a perfect example of how Hitch was able to ""play"" the audience like an organ."
I:8615;2975;The audience knows it, but loves it anyhow.
I:8615;2976;"amazing thing about ""NbNW"" is the way Hitchcock seamlessly melds humor, suspense, and action."
I:8615;2977;(Grant's ability to switch instantly between restrained.
I:8615;2978;which makes the scene even more sensual.
I:8615;2979;"Simply in terms of ""sounding good"", this 50."
I:8615;2980;(If you want to hear a modern recording that's better .
I:8615;2981;that is, coming significantly closer to live sound .
I:8615;2982;"try the Rilling performance of Britten's ""War Requien"".)"
I:8615;2983;"He puts his signature cameo in the first few minutes of the movie, so people will get on with watching it instead of playing the ""where's Waldo"" game of finding him."
I:8615;2984;it's also an American classic.
I:8615;2985;Some of the scenes have truly become part of the culture's visual memory: the crop.
I:8615;2986;It's a good action movie, 1950s style, with Cary Grant .
I:8615;2987;This is remarkable as an artifact of the cold war, which provided entire basis for the plot.
I:8615;2988;It's also noteworthy as a snapshot of 1950s style.
I:8615;2989;The Birds is a lot more nerve.
I:8615;2990;It's still a good one, for itself and for the 1950s sensibility that it has frozen in time.
I:8615;2991;Cary Grant lives up to his reputation as one of our greatest actors ever.
I:8615;2992;This story was well written and is a classic Hitchcock film.
I:8615;2993;This movie is an example of why Hitchcock and Grant's movies are deemed classics in the truest sense of the word classic.
I:8615;2994;I have always loved, loved, loved Hitch movies.
I:8615;2995;Hope to see more of my favorite Hitchcock movies make it to blu ray!
I:8615;2996;it should be required viewing in any motion picture related college course.
I:8615;2997;One of my favorite movies ever.
I:8615;2998;Hitchcock was a master, Cary Grant was suave as always and Eva Marie Saint was quite beautiful.
I:8615;2999;The extra little touches Hitchcock always added make it really fun.
I:8615;3000;My son (34) requested this for his Christmas gift.
I:8615;3001;He then ordered one on his own, and this one did the same thing.
I:8615;3002;Great action, great characters, loved the scenery, locations were awesome.
I:8615;3003;alfred Hitchcock is a great director and this picture proved it!
I:8615;3004;Mystery, romance, and comedy all wrapped up into one great movie.
I:8615;3005;There's a lot of action and great location shots and most importantly of all, great acting.
I:8615;3006;I've recently gotten into a Hitchcock mood and Grant is at his best here.
I:8615;3007;Well crafted and suspenseful .
I:8615;3008;James mason is such a great villain.
I:8615;3009;Alfred Hitchcock is the director just that alone is enough to see this movie.
I:8615;3010;The plot is suspensful and you will sure to be on the edge of your seat within the first 15 minutes of this movie.
I:8615;3011;Anyone who sees this movie will sure to fall in love with it.
I:8615;3012;Watch her lips and you can see it.
I:8615;3013;North By Northwest contains that same style of film.
I:8615;3014;constructed otherwise that it still holds up well over time.
I:8615;3015;in terms of plot, this is one of Hitchcock's best.
I:8615;3016;"the acting is terrific, as Hitch makes the ""bad guys"" genuinely creepy (I mean, Martin Landau's face alone is enough to do that!)"
I:8615;3017;bernard Hermann's soundtrack also deserves a good chunk of the credit for keeping the latter portions of this movie interesting, as those famous Hermann strings refuse to let viewers relax even for a moment during the climactic moments.
I:8615;3018;"overall, ""North by Northwest"" is a very good Hitchcock effort that deserves watching by any fan of the director or just cinema buffs in general."
I:8615;3019;Another great Hitchcock movie, along with great acting by the always.
I:8615;3020;Will definitely watch this movie again in the future.
I:8615;3021;agent than he is a brain.
I:8615;3022;surgeon and yet he gets so believably swept into this suspenseful drama that you might think that you have missed something early on!
I:8615;3023;The superb direction of Alfred Hitchcock combines perfectly with the Academy Award nominated screenplay of Ernest Lehman.
I:8615;3024;The performances of Cary Grant,Eve Marie Saint,and James Mason are equally superb!
I:8615;3025;This is a fine movie,with something interesting for everybody, man or woman, one of Hitch's best.
