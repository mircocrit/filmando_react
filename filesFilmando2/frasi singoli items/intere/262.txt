I:422;1;My students laughed and cried with the characters and their adventures.
I:422;2;My sixth graders (especially the girls) were mesmerized by the young man playing Peter and loved the devilish pranks the characters played.
I:422;3;This is the best movie about Pan yet to be shown.
I:422;4;It is magical, whimsical, fun, and exciting.
I:422;5;The cast fits the roles better than any other cast of Peter Pan I have ever seen.
I:422;6;This is the true fairytale we all pictured when we were young.
I:422;7;Peter Pan is a beautifully done movie.
I:422;8;The effects, first of all, are amazing, and very tasteful.
I:422;9;wow edge of your seat exsplosive special effects throughout the film, but instead opted for effects that were still breathtaking, but just a little more subtle, and this gives the movie a graceful, seamless look to it.
I:422;10;the characters have all been very well cast, from Wendy (Rachael Hurd.
I:422;11;But the most remarkable character is Captain Hook (Jason Isaacs).
I:422;12;While Peter and Tink get on the audience's nerves, Hook gives us a layered portrait of a villain who really wouldn't be all that bad if someone just gave him a chance.
I:422;13;The film shows us two reasons for this, giving the character a nice bit of depth that was not previously there.
I:422;14;In fact, Hook is such a fascinating character that when Pan and his sidekick Tinkerbell (Ludivine Sagnier, being more annoying than I thought was possible even by fairy standards)come in to save the day, you feel like they're ruining the fun.
I:422;15;other notable performances: The Lost Boys, and even a few of the pirates, provide several funny moments.
I:422;16;Slightly(Theodore Chester) probably gives some of the best lines of all, and John(Newell) and Michael(Popplewell) also have several funny scenes.
I:422;17;My daughter loves this movie!
I:422;18;She watches the Disney cartoon as well (which is what I grew up with) but she will alternate between the two.
I:422;19;I thought it was a great remake of the Peter Pan story, very entertaining!
I:422;20;I would definitely recommend getting it.
I:422;21;Great movie for anyone who can sympathize with a boy who can't grow up.
I:422;22;Some dialog was not taken from Barrie's novel, but it fit in perfectly.
I:422;23;Its a heartwarming family film featuring several young, nearly undressed, athletic boys.
I:422;24;Overall a great film that brings out the kid in everyone.
I:422;25;This turned out to be a wonderful adaption from the book.
I:422;26;Yes, children will fall in love with it.
I:422;27;But quite honestly it's as innocent as it could be, since children really won't understand the double play on Hook and Wendy's father, nor the relationship between Wendy and Peter in it's entirety.
I:422;28;if you're looking for something interesting that will entertain both you and children alike, this is your movie.
I:422;29;My daughter loves this movie and has been asking for it for a while, checking local stores I was surprised to see it priced higher than in Amazon.
I:422;30;Jason Isaacs does an admirable job of portraying Captain Hook and Wendy's father.
I:422;31;Much of what they don't get (the kiss in the corner of Wendy's mouth, etc) is straight out of the book, and that's exactly why I loved this film so much.
I:422;32;It's a film to watch again and again, and it made me smile, remembering what a crush I used to have on Peter when I was a little girl.
I:422;33;Lots more little girls are going to be sighing over Jeremy's Peter, in this fabulous version of a beloved book.
I:422;34;I realllly enjoyed this movie!
I:422;35;This movie shows the real story of Peter Pan besides the old cartoon version.
I:422;36;Every scene I was enthralled with the great acting and stunning special effects.
I:422;37;Peter Pan, Wendy, and Captain Hook played very well and they draw you into this magical place that makes you wish after watching the film never to grow up!
I:422;38;This is a great movie with nothing horrible to say to it!
I:422;39;I was delighted when I found that Peter Pan is played by a boy in this version, and my delight grew as I watched this cinematic treat.
I:422;40;i have read the original book by J. m. Barrie, and I greatly enjoyed it, especially the 'lost boys' angle.
I:422;41;Most of this movie stays true to the book, including some of the dialogue and personalities.
I:422;42;Aunt Millicent is a surprise, but a pleasant one.
I:422;43;Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan is perfect.
I:422;44;he is the roguish charmer that I always pictured when reading the book.
I:422;45;Jason Isaacs was also delightful.
I:422;46;In short, I thought the cast was superb, down to the pirates and British elite.
I:422;47;I LOVED the moment when Wendy gave Peter the 'hidden kiss', and Peter turns pink and eventually shoots upward into the sky.
I:422;48;I also loved Hook's expression: Split my infinitives!
I:422;49;the romance, the adventure, the paradox of 'growing up'.
I:422;50;Something that delights children but also appeals to adults.
I:422;51;otherwise, I just love it, and I'll watch this often.
I:422;52;This is my favorite Jeremy Sumpter film, and with the high definition of Blu.
I:422;53;ray the picture and sound is equal to the theater experience.
I:422;54;I would recommend them to anyone.
I:422;55;My favorite is Peter Pan, which takes the favorite Disney cartoon to real life.
I:422;56;action rendering of this classic story being pulled off more beautifully.
I:422;57;The producers found the perfect boy to play Peter Pan, a young actor who is continuing to pursue a successful career as an adult.
I:422;58;The special effects are amazing and the musical score is beautiful.
I:422;59;My 2 year old absolutely loves this movie.
I:422;60;Good movie for the family.
I:422;61;Good remake of a classic story and showed Victorian times quite accurately.
I:422;62;"A ""watch it once"" movie though."
I:422;63;My family just loves this retelling of the classic story (much more than the animated version).
I:422;64;ups are the same, but children are magical.
I:422;65;My kids have always loved this movie.
I:422;66;We went to see a Peter Pan play at a local theatre and it sparked our interest in this movie once again.
I:422;67;We love the characters and they seem to stay really close to the actual story.
I:422;68;This is a beautiful, fantastic film!
I:422;69;It is a feast for the eyes, and remains true to the complex themes of the true Peter Pan.
I:422;70;There has never been a better, stronger, more beautiful Wendy than Rachel Hurd.
I:422;71;Jason Isaacs as Capt. Hook is wicked, charming, attractive, and NASTY!
I:422;72;He delivers some great lines along the way.
I:422;73;The special effects are fantastic, the sets gorgeous, and Peter is really a great, fun, dirty boy instead of a girly.
I:422;74;Props to the cast, crew, and director .
I:422;75;this is the best Peter Pan ever!
I:422;76;This was the finest presentation of Peter Pan that I have seen.
I:422;77;My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
I:422;78;Timeless story well done movie great movie for the family to watch together.
I:422;79;This is one that is popular on long road trips with my family so is great to carry along on the Kindle Fire.
I:422;80;We discovered it when I picked it out from our local library, and it was well loved and watched for the time we had it checked out.
I:422;81;She loved it so much I decided to see if I could find a copy of it for her on Amazon.
I:422;82;This movie is perfect for not only children but anyone who loves the story of the boy who would never grow up.
I:422;83;It creates a beautiful interpretation of Neverland that even J. m. Barrie would appreciate.
I:422;84;Great effects, great music, and great acting.
I:422;85;it was still exciting and new.
I:422;86;a fantastic family movie .
I:422;87;I must say it was very well done, kept to the original story but was really fun to watch it in a real setting instead of a cartoon.
I:422;88;Peter Pan is a great movie for kids young and older.
I:422;89;For all those young at heart it brings back fond memories of dreams and aspirations of our youth.
I:422;90;This is a beautiful live action movie of Peter Pan.
I:422;91;I was simply thrilled and amazed as to how the story came to life.
I:422;92;I honestly can not think of any complaints.
I:422;93;Every one worked well with each other.
I:422;94;the special effects are great.
I:422;95;There isn't too much but just enough and even the back ground music is riveting.
I:422;96;Highly recommend for a Peter Pan lover.
I:422;97;This is a great movie for the whole family.
I:422;98;I've never read the book, but my hubby says it does a great job of illustrating the text.
I:422;99;the price was perfect and the shipping was fast.
I:422;100;i think that this is the best edition of peter pan ever done everything in this movie was wonderful just wonderful,the special effects are great, the cast jeremy sumpter defenetly fit in his character and wendy 2 she's a great actress 2, u will think that this just another kids movie,but its so great that i recomend it for every body 4 kids 4 teenage for adults hey i'm 16 an i just love it.
I:422;101;action adaption of the original Peter Pan, with some very adult changes.
I:422;102;Several fairies also die, quite comically, but die nonetheless.
I:422;103;I saw Peter Pan when i was a little boy, and it stirred my imagination soomuch that i dreamed that i was actually flying with Peter.
I:422;104;till nowI have seen this Peter Pan movie, and it keeps up with the old and evenbetter cause its live action.
I:422;105;Peter is great, the captain is still meanand dark as he should be.
I:422;106;I bought this movie for my two girls for being so well behaved on our vacation.
I:422;107;Even though it's a remake of a classic i feel that it had a great group of actors to bring it life.
I:422;108;I knew I was taking a chance going to see this version but the trailor looked so good I had to at least see it.
I:422;109;The most I've ever seen a movie was 5 times, and that was LOTR:Fellowship.
I:422;110;I usually don't like kids in movies, but the kids in this were wonderful and endearing.
I:422;111;This is the first movie I came to recognize him in.
I:422;112;He is a brilliant actor.
I:422;113;The way he did both Hook and Mr. Darling is to be put among the greats.
I:422;114;Whole new perspective, whole new respect.
I:422;115;Wonderfully written, directed and acted.
I:422;116;The effectsmake Neverland unbelievable yet quite real .
I:422;117;a true (gorgeous) fantasy land.
I:422;118;The young actors were superb, never campy or saccharine rot.your.
I:422;119;These are characters that youngsters can easily relate to, but also relatable to all adults who felt these feelings.
I:422;120;The immensly talanted and oh so very very handsome JASON ISAACS plays one of the best movie villians ever.
I:422;121;Mr. Isaacs is also wonderful as Wendy's father, George Darling.
I:422;122;Excellent ensemble acting, Mrs Darling was wonderful, as was the aunt (new character).
I:422;123;it stays close to the novel by Mr. Barrie, yet when it strays, it's an improvement.
I:422;124;My kids love this movie, 8 and 6 years old.
I:422;125;A fairy should possess some kind of mystique, and I guess it was just a victim of mis.
I:422;126;It had amazing potential, most of which was realised.
I:422;127;buffs at such young ages.
I:422;128;I think I enjoyed watching them excited about watching a well.
I:422;129;made movie as much as they enjoyed watching it.
I:422;130;I highly recommend this version of Peter Pan to boys and girls alike (for any age)!!
I:422;131;The visual effects were spectacular, and there were laughs to be had, but I might have enjoyed it more had I been a few years younger.
I:422;132;My sister recommended this one to me and I am glad I took her advice.
I:422;133;This was certainly a nice surprise.
I:422;134;It's both uplifting and tragic at the same time.
I:422;135;"Peter Pan is certainly the main hero type thing, but unlike the Disney version (the only one I've seen previously), it certainly shows the character's ""fall from grace"" and shows the ""Peter Pan syndrome"" in not wanting to grow up."
I:422;136;The movie shows the hope for Peter to truly breach that skin, and the sadness when he doesn't but you still feel for him.
I:422;137;A recommended movie for families with young children to watch with as they grow and mature as they may pick up the themes along the way.
I:422;138;In a sense it calls out to the child in us and asks us to use our imagination to fill in the gaps where the special effects don't quite make it.
I:422;139;"This is the Peter Pan you've always wanted to see
I:422;140;This Peter Pan truly captured the magical world of Neverland and the childlike spirit of the original story that I remember.
I:422;141;it's hard to imagine that there's anybody in the English speaking world who doesn't know this story, but all the same, here's a summary of the plot: three Victorian children telling stories of adventure in their nursery attract the attention of a magical, extraordinary boy .
I:422;142;"His friend Tinkerbell, a fairy, gives him the ability to fly
I:422;143;So the tale is set up for a great deal of adventure and wonder as the wild boy tribe and all the other inhabitants of Neverland take on the pirates to determine who will rule in the end.
I:422;144;the special effects were flawless in this film.
I:422;145;The actors were all perfectly cast, especially Jason Isaacs as that impish King of the Wild Boys, Peter.
I:422;146;The art direction was just right for this story, a mixture of whimsy and delight.
I:422;147;I felt that the occasional narration by Vanessa Redgrave added a nice touch and really helped to preserve the essence of the original story's subtle wit and charm.
I:422;148;This version of Peter Pan will appeal to a wide age range, including older children and adults.
I:422;149;the movie is perfect and got to me within a week or less.
I:422;150;There is meaning and feeling, which makes this fantasy the best of all fantasies.
I:422;151;while it's fantastic on the big screen, it's still fantastic on the small screen in your living room.
I:422;152;He meets Wendy, Michael, and John Darling, whisks them away to the magical Neverland and have rip.
I:422;153;it's colorful, it beautiful, and the flying looks real.
I:422;154;Peter is played by the marvelous Jeremy Sumpter, who is also in the film Frailty.
I:422;155;He proves himself in both movies.
I:422;156;He's the most amazing Pan you'll ever have the pleasure to see.
I:422;157;She brings new life to the character of Wendy.
I:422;158;He plays both Captain Hook and Mr. Darling, creating a Hook that is more memorable than ever before.
I:422;159;It's perfectly for all ages, all types.
I:422;160;the theme and meaning of Peter Pan is something that we can all relate to.
I:422;161;The visuals are great, fantastic acting, awesome musical score (in which case, you might want to check out the soundtrack sometime!)
I:422;162;overall just a wonderful film that you'll watch again and again.
I:422;163;the cast is absolutely perfect.
I:422;164;Jeremy Sumpter in the title role is wonderful, bringing a mischievous energy and boyishness to the part that has been amazingly and consistently missing (having been played by Mary Martin and Robin Williams).
I:422;165;Darling for their great performances, but the entire cast is terrific.
I:422;166;the script is spectacular, exploring the subtext of the Pan story in a simple but profound way that puts film critics' shameless psycho.
I:422;167;It is the kernel of truth wrapped round a rousing adventure story .
I:422;168;This is a thinking (little) person's Peter Pan, certainly, drawing as it does on previously unexplored themes of the complexity of growing up, the consequences of our choices, and the acceptance of our children as they grow up, but it's also a gorgeous realization of Barrie's (and Wendy's) fantastical imagination.
I:422;169;"for Pan fans, highest possible recommendation
I:422;170;"Actually, my rating for the movie is 5 stars, but for the sound it's ONE star, that's why I gave it a '3 star':""I was impressed with the movie ."
I:422;171;Jeremy Sumpter is an absolutely PERFECT Peter Pan .
I:422;172;the music to show excitement .
I:422;173;and it is now one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:422;174;It's charming and touching, funny and sad, and the actors are irresistable!
I:422;175;It is truly a cult classic.
I:422;176;including Mary Martin's Broadway blockbuster.
I:422;177;and this is truly the best.
I:422;178;With Jeremy Sumpter's agile and gender correct performance, Peter Pan becomes the screen's most attractive youth who won't grow up.
I:422;179;His is a rougish performance filled with adolescent bravado and impish cuteness.
I:422;180;round exceptional cast of actors whose credits rarely include children's stories, this film is a delight, and truly a film that is aimed at young as well as older audiences who might accompany them.
I:422;181;"the subtext of the ambiguous ""hidden kiss"" that lurks in the corner of Wendy's full lips is sensuous and innocent as it should be."
I:422;182;Wendy's attraction to Peter's seductive grin is a kind of first blush that is girlish and childish, but also exciting.
I:422;183;all the young actors in this film are natural, enormously believable, and attractive.
I:422;184;So believable are their adventures in Neverland against Hook and with Princess Tiger Lily and the Indians that we too are swept up joining the experience of fighting with swords and flying.
I:422;185;This is heady fantasy and the director never permits the cast to become over the top.
I:422;186;In the lush setting of Neverland, the visual sensation is rich as color is used to convey more than just the physical.
I:422;187;superb performances from versatile veteran actors such as Lynn Redgrave, a biddy aunt are created from the film but feel true to the storyline.
I:422;188;Isaac's tragic/comedic villainous character presentation of Hook has the right mix ofbelievable and fearsome elements.
I:422;189;"It is only in the overlooked, ""An Awfully Big Adventure"" does an actor's performance of Hook by brilliant Alan Rickman have the similar bravado, weight, and believable panache."
I:422;190;the film conveys the transitory beauty of childhood on the brink of change with deft handling, scenic drama, and swashbuckling action that is complex as well as bittersweet.
I:422;191;As Peter and Wendy dance in the moonlight, their awareness of growing emotional maturity, although seductive, remains an enemy of Peter.
I:422;192;She is in limbo until imparting on Peter her hidden kiss, a gift that can only be given once in a young girl's life.
I:422;193;And, where a thimble is a precious and powerful thing.
I:422;194;I love the story of Peter Pan and was excited to see this thing in theaters.
I:422;195;I loved the young beautiful girl who played Wendy, but her teeth were.
I:422;196;interesting to say the least.
I:422;197;What was wrong with her natural ones?All in all, the movie *is* fun to watch.
I:422;198;"My wife and I enjoyed this splendidly entertaining and marvelously authentic version of ""Peter Pan"" as much as the kids."
I:422;199;Jeremy Sumpter captures J. M. Barrie's vision of Peter to perfection.
I:422;200;Do yourself a favor and ignore the nitpicking critics and enjoy this wonderful family entertainment.
I:422;201;The actors were perfect for the part.
I:422;202;I've seen several Peter Pan movies throughout my years, and this version is by far the best!
I:422;203;Your inner child will thank you!
I:422;204;I had a great time watching my grandchildren laughing and enjoying Peter Pan.
I:422;205;We had a great time and they asked to watch it more than once.
I:422;206;Great movie and beautiful picture.
I:422;207;I would recommend this movie to every American family.
I:422;208;This is a good movie to add to your movie collection.
I:422;209;Jason Isaacs owns the role of the villian Captain Hook and is a treat to watch.
I:422;210;Sure the film has its flaws but at its core remains good, fun, family friendly filmaking.
I:422;211;Peter Pan is the best movie I have seen in my whole life.
I:422;212;It has everything adventure, romance, really good special effects and really good actors.
I:422;213;When you see this movie, you travel to a whole new world, a magical world, and you escape from everything.
I:422;214;The chemistry between Jeremy sumpter and Rachel (wendy)it's awesome.
I:422;215;If you like adventure or romance or fantasy, you have it all in this movie.
I:422;216;You have to see it, you will love it, I promise.
I:422;217;And Disney has used this music in most of their promotional commercials!
I:422;218;The characters were portrayed perfectly.
I:422;219;Great cast, Great script, Great movie!
I:422;220;This is a wonderful movie adaptation of the favorite novel Peter Pan.
I:422;221;the graphics are very good and aren't way over the top like a lot of movies are.
I:422;222;The back ground music is very beautiful and fits the story well.
I:422;223;jeremy Sumpter as a very beautiful and rich looking Peter Pan really fits and Rachel Hurd.
I:422;224;the cast really complement each other and the full package is great to watch.
I:422;225;This the classic story of Peter Pan.
I:422;226;Overall it's a good boy's movie.
I:422;227;the special features are actually better than the movie itself.
I:422;228;It is a very well made and enjoyable film though.
I:422;229;This movie is beatiful to watch.
I:422;230;It is true to the original book.
I:422;231;I would highly recommend it for the whole family.
I:422;232;A step up from the Disney cartoon version.
I:422;233;Nice adaptation of the book.
I:422;234;My opinion about my order:I did like the movie Peter Pan.
I:422;235;my grand daughter is in love with this movie.
I:422;236;Shes 3 years old, so I bought it from amazon and I think she has watched it about 20 times.
I:422;237;I loved every part of it except when Wendy kisses, i mean thimbles, Peter.
I:422;238;The fact that they stuck so close to the book was amazing, it is the most accurate that they have made.
I:422;239;the movie special effects were wonderful.
I:422;240;Flying was always a childhood wish, and to see this movie where they fly off to a world that was perfect in a childs eye was great.
I:422;241;Tinkerbell does a great job and even when she is jealous the director allowed her to be more of a girl, and less of a fiction.
I:422;242;The chemistry between Wendy and Peter is so cute, it made me smile and remember what it was like to be young.
I:422;243;the actor that plays Hook does such a wonderful job, he really is very talented.
I:422;244;To be such a good actor to play such a bad guy, it is just wonderful to see that!
I:422;245;But Hook really does pull his own, and makes his presence known through the capture of Tiger Lilly, John and Michael.
I:422;246;He is truly an evil guy, and the actor did a fantastic job!The whole cast is extrememly talented and fun!
I:422;247;I enjoyed every minute of watching them interact and wonder how much FUN they had off screen while making the movie.
I:422;248;it honestly takes you back to your childhood, and I believe this movie will be treasured by both young and old.
I:422;249;"My daughter really enjoyed Disney's ""Peter Pan"" and so I thought I'd check this one out and see what she thought."
I:422;250;My daughter was captivated for the entire movie and honestly, so were my husband and I.
I:422;251;This alone really makes it worth owning.
I:422;252;The actors were perfectly cast and the special effects are great!
I:422;253;The actress that plays Wendy is stunning and I expect to see a lot more of her in the future.
I:422;254;I have always been a huge fan of the Peter Pan story.
I:422;255;This particular movie, I must say, is the very best version I have ever seen.
I:422;256;My daughters, ages 3 and 5, have just started watching the cartoon, so I figured I would order this movie for them since it is one of my favorites.
I:422;257;I just got it in today and they have already watched it 3 times!
I:422;258;The special effects, colors, and acting are all superb.
I:422;259;It does a great job of capturing all the magic and imagination which embodies Peter Pan.
I:422;260;This movie will keep your young children completely spellbound and the adults in the home will love it too!
I:422;261;Her name is Sophia so she is really interested in the new Sofia princess.
I:422;262;This movie though is the same story from the book, and the magic of the story is front and center, the actors are well chosen (though for child actors they do a great job at capturing the very essence of the original story) the screenplay serves the movie well and the special effects are top.
I:422;263;Though it's really the story that's the star here.
I:422;264;and can appreciate the magic of one of the greatest fairy tales ever created.
I:422;265;"The two really good parts are when Wendy and Peter are dancing in the light of a full moon with faeries flying all around them
I:422;266;It is richer for that balance.
I:422;267;A friend of mind told me I had to see it because it was a beautiful film.
I:422;268;The colors are lush and it looks like a true fantasy world.
I:422;269;I liked the fact that it was so rich in sensory detail and that the colors were vast and strong.
I:422;270;But there is just something in that grin of Sumpter's that puts the viewer on edge.
I:422;271;wood was just lovely as Wendy.
I:422;272;She was luminously innocent and yet she pulled off the awakening awareness of her character with wonder and grace.
I:422;273;Great things should be expected from this beautiful young lady in future acting endeavors.
I:422;274;it was Jason Isaacs performance, however, that I enjoyed the most.
I:422;275;While as Hook he was suitably menacing, but in a more understated fashion than some may have wished, and charming still.
I:422;276;J. m. Barrie's life experiences played such a great role in the creation of it that it's almost a shame that it doesn't shine through more in a live action version of the story.
I:422;277;As an adult, I think you appreciate Pan and the boys more for knowing about Barrie's life.
I:422;278;This film was absolutely perfect!My sister and I loved it!Jeremy Sumter flew away with our hearts!
I:422;279;Two of our favorite lost boys were Slightly, and Nibs they were delightfully hilarious!
I:422;280;I would recommend this film to anybody!
I:422;281;This is a movie to see with friends and family.
I:422;282;The special effects are the best part of the movie.
I:422;283;traditional fairy tales spiced up with pirates and other adventurous elements.
I:422;284;When he returns to retrieve it, he and Wendy meet face.
I:422;285;"Neverland is a vividly colored and ""nicely crammed"" place that reminds you of some of the great illustrators of children's books then at work, and the special effects (by George Lucas's ILM) are wonderful."
I:422;286;Peter Pan, one of the most enduring stories of all time, finds its ideas and visions captured perfectly in this film adaptation.
I:422;287;The script is true to its literary roots, the casting is absolutely perfect, the visuals are wonderful, the score is beautiful, and the special effects are classy and elegant.
I:422;288;He is convincing, entertaining, and fully believable.
I:422;289;The use of colour to convey moods is both beautiful and effective.
I:422;290;The climax gives you chills.
I:422;291;It is wondrous how much excitement and joy has been squeezed into this gem.
I:422;292;The audio is haunting and perfect.
I:422;293;tHE VERDICT: The is a great looking and sounding film.
I:422;294;The story is wondrous and exciting.
I:422;295;The actors are all uniformly perfect for the roles.
I:422;296;Jeremy Sumpter in particular is a revelation.
I:422;297;I really believe that this version of Pan is one of the great cinematic achievements of film.
I:422;298;it's pure enjoyment that represents everything that the cinema should be.
I:422;299;I have also found it to be one of the most re.
I:422;300;"watchable movies ever
I:422;301;One of the most solid 5 stars out of 5 that I can name.
I:422;302;that function was a good start, and I read somewhere that select Blu.
I:422;303;rays with this function can update via the 'net so you get new trailers from the company that did this.)
I:422;304;The price is so affordable.
I:422;305;Not to mention I'm happy I got to see this again.
I:422;306;*gives a Kamen Rider Kuuga thumbs.
I:422;307;truly magical, beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and surprisingly moving.
I:422;308;the highlight of the film for me was Jason Isaacs as Captain Hook, deliciously evil but sexy in gorgeous costumes, and ranging from the ever.
I:422;309;slightly camp to the genuinely touching (including a good smattering of sinister and creepy moments).
I:422;310;also deserving of Oscar nominations were the enchanting score, and atmospheric cinematography.
I:422;311;I just got done watching the movie adaptation for Disney's Peter Pan and enjoyed it immensely.
I:422;312;It's definitely geared toward adult audiences who take pleasure in enchanting fantasies, like me, but it's certainly suitable and fun for the whole family.
I:422;313;The beginning even takes place before Nana (the dog nurse) captured Peter Pan's shadow, which I found to be very clever as I always wondered how that happened.
I:422;314;Tinkerbell was dazzling as the jealous faery, the sets, or rather special effects were all magnificent, and the entire cast was superbly chosen.
I:422;315;This is, in my opinion, one of the better films to come out of 2003 so come be a kid again and enter a world that shall bring that to the surface.
I:422;316;Another reviewer, Mr Barnabo I think it was, had it perfectly right.
I:422;317;This is the best and most faithful PETER PAN ever.
I:422;318;Wendy and all the cast are equally perfect in their roles.
I:422;319;The animated Disney version of Peter Pan was well.
I:422;320;telling recalls a lot of the Disney version and adding in it's own stuff.
I:422;321;wood in a great debut) is about to grow up and become a lady but wishes not to.
I:422;322;Instead of Hook's, well hook attached to his hand very easily, it now is a contraption he must hook up to himself.
I:422;323;For one it looks spectacular with great effects and shots that seem out of a painting.
I:422;324;Jason Isaacs, who was best known for playing villains(Patriot, Harry Potter) gets to play a dual role with Mr. Darling and Hook himself.
I:422;325;wood and not to mention Olivia Williams is still great to look at.
I:422;326;All in all, it's a great version of the well.
I:422;327;my son is 5 and he enjoyed so much about it (especially the crocodile).
I:422;328;He hid under the seat during much of that stuff.
I:422;329;it was sort of comical, actually.
I:422;330;The set design was so real/fantastical that the mood was thoroughly captured.
I:422;331;i liked it and so did my kids.
I:422;332;Must be good, then, right?
I:422;333;So I started to watch, and what caught my eye almost immediately, were the fabulous costumes!
I:422;334;And then I thought: Ok.
I:422;335;The very essence of the story started to take form rather quickly, and the music, I find, was the glue that connected the story, the scenes, costumes, actors and the magic of it all to each other!
I:422;336;I think that this is a marvellous kids film, but is suitable for everybody to watch!
I:422;337;the sad parts will make you cry, and the sensational ones will make your heart fly straight to Neverland!
I:422;338;The common misperception of Peter Pan is that he's nothing more than a lucky boy who always has fun and is the subject of jealousy for adults and kids alike.
I:422;339;The movie is full of magic, adventure, romance, and sword fights!
I:422;340;This will appeal to the adults as well.
I:422;341;Seeing this movie in the theater was something of a marvel.
I:422;342;See this movie was meant for them.
I:422;343;Its a story about the tragedy of loosing our innocence, about being forced to grow up, and take on adult responsibilities when we all would much rather just play and have fun.
I:422;344;Most of all its about wanting the best of both worlds, the things that come with adulthood such as love, and family, without having to sacrifice the comforts of childhood.
I:422;345;It's amazing to see a movie that so beautifully captures the emotional struggle that children go through at that age.
I:422;346;The inner struggle to cling to the things that are fun, and innocent, and childish, versus the desire to become independent, to love and be loved beyond a mother.
I:422;347;Without a doubt, this movie is a must see for everyone.
I:422;348;Child and adult alike this film will reach you in ways that no other presentation of this story has ever accomplished.
I:422;349;Great movie, holds true to the story of my childhood.
I:422;350;Fun for kinds and adults.
I:422;351;Get it you will enjoy.
I:422;352;"The previous reviewer, ""a sixteen year old who already feels the effects of age"" is looking forward to Peter Pan."
I:422;353;And finally, there's the part of you that wants to have no responsibilities, but all the fun, but still, if need be .
I:422;354;I will be going to this movie in a strong longing and a strong anticipation .
I:422;355;that such a movie reflects us all.
I:422;356;Here is the live action version of the classic Disney animated feature that we have long waited for.
I:422;357;With some incredible acting, beautiful cinematography and fantastic sets this is a splash of fantasy that truly entertains and is a wonder to behold.Yes, the movie does hold truer to the 1953 Disney production than the Barrie book, but it works so well here that one does not mind.
I:422;358;wood (as Wendy) are remarkable finds.
I:422;359;Sumpter portrays Peter's childlike wonder and sense of fun convincingly, while Wood really goes through possibly the biggest of character arcs, ready to grow up as the movie draws to a close.
I:422;360;everybody is already well familiar with the story.
I:422;361;with top billing Jason Isaacs portrays the double role of Mr. Darling and Capt. Hook and he really puts his all into every scene with a reserved conservative air to Darling to an exuberant over.
I:422;362;top appropriate overacting for the flamboyant Hook.
I:422;363;my favorite scenes are probably those between Sumpter and Wood.
I:422;364;budget movies these days, one of the big stars of the movie is the computer special effects.
I:422;365;One scene I found particularly impressive was the shot of the pirate ship traversing the landmarks of London at the end with the fog taking on the appearance and characteristics of the ocean, but really the whole movie is a wonder to behold.
I:422;366;fans of British television will recognize well.
I:422;367;Also those with sharp ears will recognize the narrators voice as that of international star Saffron Burrows.
I:422;368;i could go on and on about how much I enjoyed this movie and how rewarding and satisfying it was, but really the proof is there for the individual viewer.
I:422;369;This is a movie that is safe and enjoyable for the whole family and as such is, in my opinion, one of the best live.
I:422;370;This movie was quite outstanding.
I:422;371;Pulls a few punches but the story is pure.
I:422;372;effects were awesome, and the world of Neverland very absorbing.
I:422;373;best performance of a Hook I have ever seen, and Wendy.
I:422;374;you gotta see the movie.
I:422;375;It takes the J. m. Barrie tale to wonderful new heights with stunning visuals and gorgeous landscapes.
I:422;376;Jeremy Sumpter is the perfect Pan, with a mischievous grin and a wonderful sparkle in his beautiful green eyes.
I:422;377;wood makes an amazing debut as Wendy.
I:422;378;She is perfect for the part, playing the role as I had always envisioned it being played in my head.
I:422;379;Also, added to this already wonderful film is the extra of the alternate ending.
I:422;380;"And also to say that the alternate ending allows for a wonderful transition into the movie ""Hook"" which once I finish watching, I will review."
I:422;381;two Thumbs as high up as I can go!!!!
I:422;382;for those of us who know the story, I will tell you that this is the most faithful adaptations of the book and also the most interesting.
I:422;383;A boy who has the whole world at his fingertips and yet has the one thing he can never have: love.
I:422;384;i was blown away by how this film is so bold.
I:422;385;But for once this film shows us the Peter that truly exists.
I:422;386;i also loved how Neverland was full of danger.
I:422;387;Innocent and cute on the outside, but all my inward fantasies were full of violence.
I:422;388;Neverland may be a fun place, but it's definitely not a safe place.
I:422;389;the other more important story points that this new film really handled well was the innocent sexual tension created by two children.
I:422;390;Peter and Wendy are still at the point where girls and boys are icky, but yet are brought together by fantasy and fun.
I:422;391;i loved to watch the fantasy of the two of them dancing in the moonlight.
I:422;392;wood portrays Wendy with a gentile innocence.
I:422;393;This is her first film, but she's so good other roles cannot be far off.
I:422;394;She reminds me of a young Nicole Kidman.
I:422;395;Her character is nicely rounded and full of the childlike wonder you normally see in the role.
I:422;396;all in all PJ Hogan's PETER PAN is really good.
I:422;397;Hogan and co. screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have taken some liberties with Barrie, but, incredibly, they enhance the original in ways that resonate in moving and heartbreaking ways.
I:422;398;"(Goldenberg is the screenwriter for the upcoming ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" which is very good news for fans of that franchise.)"
I:422;399;The casting is uniformly perfect, starting with Jeremy Sumpter's Peter, whose expressive grin and eyebrows bring the character to vibrant, mischieveous life.
I:422;400;How right that he's the only American in the cast, emphasizing Peter's exotic other.
I:422;401;And I love how Hogan and his art director, Roger Ford, have chosen to make their universe look unabashadly fantastical (as opposed to a Peter Jackson, who strives to make the fantastical look 100% real).
I:422;402;This is one of my favorite films of the past ten years, one that I pull out when I want to feel good.
I:422;403;"And at the risk of commiting sacrilege, as ""Peter Pan""s go, I actually prefer this to the Disney version!"
I:422;404;animated version of Peter Pan you can love.
I:422;405;The character portrayals are delightful.
I:422;406;Captain Hook is dastardly, the Indians are lovable, Wendy and the boys are charming and brave.
I:422;407;And Tinkerbell is deliciously single minded, easily beset by fits of jealousy.
I:422;408;The sets and photography are very well done and the special effects add to the magic of the story.
I:422;409;Thgis is by far the best version of Peter Pan out there, a delightfully entertaining tale for all ages.
I:422;410;A very good retelling of an amazing story.
I:422;411;Very colorful and visually beautiful, almost magical.
I:422;412;Great acting from Jason Isaacs who does double duty as both the good guy and bad guy.
I:422;413;A very uplifting film with a lovely musical score.
I:422;414;What I think is worth talking about is the adaptation of it.
I:422;415;the story is very well told and the film is visually stunning.
I:422;416;This is truly a perfectly executed movie.
I:422;417;First of all I should say that it was a complete pleasure to watch great Jason Issacs bring to life infamous Captain Hook.
I:422;418;A surprise and a pleasent one at that, was watching rest of the cast.
I:422;419;An incredibly ralented group of kids with perfect chemistry between them, especially Peter and Wendy.
I:422;420;Excellent cast and an excellent movie.
I:422;421;But, two weeks ago I did read the book and then yesterday went to see the movie.
I:422;422;It did follow the book extremely well with three exceptions.
I:422;423;"In most instances men that won't commit are actually very much in tune with what love is
I:422;424;the special effects in the movie were great and almost surreal.
I:422;425;Tink was a little over done but all of the rest of the cast played their parts perfectly.
I:422;426;Like the book, the movie was pretty much a story of Wendy growing up.
I:422;427;Peter Pan made the perfect contrast to Wendy.
I:422;428;Definitely a five star movie.
I:422;429;She has watched it several times already.
I:422;430;Our kids love this movie!
I:422;431;It is a really fun and fanciful movie.
I:422;432;It really brings the story to life and does a nice job of following the story.
I:422;433;My daughter, Jessica, chose this movie.
I:422;434;She LOVES it and she was SO HAPPY to order it from Amazon.
I:422;435;She got us saying, I do believe in fairies!
I:422;436;I adored the book and this make of the movie as well.
I:422;437;maybe it is just my obsession with Jason Issacs, but I thought Captain Hook was absolutely fantastic, certainly the best character this film had to offer.
I:422;438;She totally destroyed the character, Tink.
I:422;439;The music brings about so much emotion.
I:422;440;I throughly enjoyed every scene with Hook except for his defeat in the end.
I:422;441;This was just the cutest most wondeful magical movie ever!!
I:422;442;Jeremy (Peter Pan) is wonderful.
I:422;443;The movie was just perfect.
I:422;444;I mean, this movie was sooo good.
I:422;445;And I'm going to see it again .
I:422;446;The graphics were great too.
I:422;447;What a creative twist that was.
I:422;448;Totally one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
I:422;449;I felt transported back to my childhood.
I:422;450;This movie is amazing and has become one of my favorites because of how beautifully done it is.
I:422;451;The effects were lovely, the music beautiful, and the plot true to original.
I:422;452;This is a wonderful movie for all ages and anyone who has ever read the story should definitely see it.
I:422;453;Well, she absolutely loves this with the actors!!!
I:422;454;She has watched it over and over.
I:422;455;She is 6 years old, and she said it was the best Peter Pan she has ever seen.
I:422;456;It's fun and slightly serious at the same time.
I:422;457;My kids love it too.
I:422;458;This movie is so much more than just a fairy tale.
I:422;459;it teaches you about life also.
I:422;460;i think peterpan is growing up by let wendy go, Jeremy was superb he play the role great!!
I:422;461;The effect was great too it's like I was in neverland.
I:422;462;Lots of family backstory at the beginning and the end.
I:422;463;with live action players than they do in animated form.
I:422;464;Its PG rating is well deserved.
I:422;465;Fantasy aspects of the story are fully produced in great color, special effects and movie wizardry.
I:422;466;The flying technique is flawless (and not a single wire to be found).
I:422;467;Lynn Redgrave's character, though apacraphal, was a very nice touch and sweetly helps tie up some of the loose ends of the story's end.
I:422;468;I loved this movie, and so did my mother and two children!!!
I:422;469;This new version of Peter Pan, based on the original writting of J. m. Barrie, was the best ever brought to a feature film, and the only one that had an actual boy instead of a woman, or a 40 something year old man!!!!
I:422;470;Jeremy Sumpter was superbly cast for the lead role of Peter Pan, charming, energetic, cocky, but with a touch of sweetness, and realness that just captivates you.
I:422;471;Hopefully this version will become a classic for generations to come!!
I:422;472;It makes you remember the feeling of youth, first loves, being carefree, and always looking for an adventure!!!!
I:422;473;I am the biggest kid at heart and always will be!!!
I:422;474;P J Hogan did a great job directing this movie and I love him for it!!
I:422;475;I thought it was a captivating film and inspires the fun loving child in all of us.
I:422;476;anyway, despite some large changes, it holds to the feel of the book.
I:422;477;"nots,"" ""nightlights are the eyes a mother leaves behind,"" ""a hidden kiss in the right."
I:422;478;the acting is superb by everyone, though I was particularly entranced by Olivia Wood (Mrs. Darling) and was floored by the ever.
I:422;479;wood (Wendy) is a promising young actress and Jeremy Sumpter (Peter Pan) is bright and brash.
I:422;480;The special effects are gorgeous and lush, the colors highly saturated.
I:422;481;And (my most important point) it sticks to the book.
I:422;482;This is a vibrant new Pan, bursting off the stage and I suggest you take advantage of it now.
I:422;483;This is an astonishingly clever take on the Peter Pan story.
I:422;484;The palette and lighting are rich and candy.
I:422;485;colored, and the cast is spot on.
I:422;486;It also has a gorgeous soundtrack and a musical theme that suits it to perfection.
I:422;487;The most stunning aspect of this movie, however, has to be the writing.
I:422;488;a refreshing view that makes this coming of age story hold even more weight.
I:422;489;The filmmakers and cast should be proud.
I:422;490;I hope we'll watch it many more times, for many years.
I:422;491;i have loved peter pan ever since i was a child.
I:422;492;it is a wonderful story about magic and freedom and the wonder of childhood, and i believe that this movie did an excellent job of capturing those themes and bringing them alive.
I:422;493;there was the added love interest in the movie, that was kind of suggested in the book, but never stated.
I:422;494;this movie is an enchanting retelling of a beloved classic and a must own for all lovers of peter pan!!!
I:422;495;well, what can i say except that i love this movie!
I:422;496;my 5 yr old loves this movie as well.
I:422;497;Neverland has never looked so real.
I:422;498;Jeremy Sumpter was definitely a great choice for peter pan .
I:422;499;cute, cheeky, full of mischief.
I:422;500;And Jason Issacs played mr darling and hook very well.
I:422;501;It is very faithful to J. m. Barrie's book and the actors are all perfect in their roles.
I:422;502;I wasn't too sure how I was gonna feel about this movie especially because I grew up watching the animated Disney version, but I have to say I really liked it.
I:422;503;A great movie in every aspect: great directing, amazing special effects, wonderful acting, good script, music, amazing sets and costumes and flying sequences that put the Superman films to shame.
I:422;504;This is probably one of if not the best adaptation of J. M. Barrie classic children's story.
I:422;505;this a wonderful family movie, much better than Disney's animated version of the tale.
I:422;506;Some scenes may be a little intense for the very little ones,like swordfights and the crocodile, there is a little romance between Peter and Wendy as well, but is very cute and completely innocent.
I:422;507;The story is very well brought to life and you'll never find a dull moment.
I:422;508;i give it 5 stars, worthy of having in your collection of family films adapted from books.
I:422;509;This admirable adaption of J. M. Barrie's classic tale of the boy.
I:422;510;up is an instant success.
I:422;511;It's actually believeable due to the emotional impact and universality of the theme (who didn't think about growing up when they were a kid?)
I:422;512;be love that blossoms, and fades, on screen between Peter and Wendy is nothing short of magical, and the actors who portray the story are all excellent.
I:422;513;Like I said, this film can draw anyone into it's realm of magic and appeal because of it's theme's universality.
I:422;514;"It's all up to the viewer though, to accept it (echoing the common ""I do believe in fairies"" moments in Peter Pan."
I:422;515;Aside from the emotional pull of this film, which is unexpected, with this version you can actually tell immense effort was put into every detail of the film's creation.
I:422;516;The sets and effects are literally jaw.
I:422;517;One of the highlights is seeing the first.
I:422;518;"ever believable ""flying sequences"" in the film."
I:422;519;And the hopping about the London sky scene is just as amazing as when Peter and Wendy and her brothers first fly into Neverland, wonderfully designed and executed in it's structure and scope.
I:422;520;and the film captures the ominous side of the villains as well as the youthful spirit of the story.
I:422;521;All of these emotions and themes are vibrantly enhanced by James Newton Howard's magical (as usual) score.
I:422;522;All in all, this film is absolutely wonderful, so much so, that I found myself (very surprisingly) scoffing the other Pan productions I had seen (including the Disney film, which seems lax and half.
I:422;523;The acting, direction, design, look, sound, and effect of the film is complete.
I:422;524;One of the best movies I've ever seen, and it took me completely by surprise!
I:422;525;I think Peter Pan is a movie for all ages and is very exciting.
I:422;526;There is action, romance, comedy and much more.
I:422;527;If you want to find out more, you have to watch the movie!
I:422;528;I think it is the best movie of all time!
I:422;529;I absolutely loved this movie!
I:422;530;but loveable all the same.
I:422;531;Wendy was played well, so we're the lost boys, (I loved slightly!)
I:422;532;And her two brothers (john was a laugh) Tinker bell was good, allough a lot of people didn't like the way she over acted.
I:422;533;Allough this movie stays pretty much true to the book, there are some scenes that are taken.
I:422;534;added or the words are slightly changed, however, it all fits together perfectly.
I:422;535;This is a great movie for the whole family.
I:422;536;heck I'm 15 and I LOVE it!
I:422;537;There is a lot of great stuff in this movie.
I:422;538;action, love comedy, it's great.
I:422;539;This movie is one of our favorites.
I:422;540;My 2 daughters can watch it again and again.
I:422;541;Beautifully made, like turning the pages of an illustrated story book.
I:422;542;The actors do a wonderful job, children especially.
I:422;543;While this is not a musical, it has great music too.
I:422;544;Truly magnificent acting, amazing special effects, and an honestly.
I:422;545;crafted screenplay make this the best Peter Pan movie of all time.
I:422;546;Needless to say, I have a very happy granddaughter!
I:422;547;one of my friends spoke highly of this movie, and trusting her taste I did go into the theater with an open mind, however it proved to be just disapointing.
I:422;548;This is a great movie for kids, adults, and all lovers of the original book.
I:422;549;the child actors who play Peter and Wendy are both gorgeous and marvelous.
I:422;550;in real life, they're growing up.
I:422;551;Then we watched Peter Pan and I was so pleased with it that I let the girls watch it again today.
I:422;552;first of all they did such a fantastic job casting.
I:422;553;Jeremy Sumpter who plays Peter is just brilliant and Rachel Hurd Wood who plays Wendy is perfect .
I:422;554;she is a lively story teller, intelligent, spunky, romantic, adventurous and beautiful .
I:422;555;"olivia Williams who plays Mrs. Darling (who I've also seen in the Emma Thompson/Hugh Grant ""Sense and Sensibility"" as Jane Fairfax) is just gorgeous and though her scenes are few they are priceless!Then, of course there is Jason Isaacs who is perfectly amazing playing both the timid and mumbling Mr. Darling and the cruel villain Capt. James Hook."
I:422;556;except that they allow Hook to fly at the end, which worked wonderfully.
I:422;557;I really loved how they showed that wanting to be a child and just play all of the time was not really worth pursuing, that it was good to grow up, that yes, it meant going to school and working hard and putting away some of one's dreams that it also offered things that children can not truly experience like womanly love and manly bravery, rather than childish attraction and a boyish spirit of adventure.
I:422;558;"It is definitely a true ""family film"" not just a children's movie."
I:422;559;The special effects were all right, but nothing spectacular.
I:422;560;"PJ Hogan's ""Peter Pan"" is my favorite rendition of JM Barrie's beloved classic about the charming and wild boy who never grows up."
I:422;561;Hogan even allows the attraction between Peter and Wendy to feel a bit more., well.
I:422;562;heated as opposed to more platonic.
I:422;563;That is not to say this version is crude or inappropriate, but Hogan allows these elements to flow more freely and with dramatic logic.
I:422;564;Hogan's version is faithful, but he has made changes here, and I dare say, much needed ones which update this story is the best possible sense, most notably, the ending.
I:422;565;instead of Peter returning to Wendy years later and finding out she's an adult and he then starts anew with adventures with her daughter.
I:422;566;The film is so visually dazzling and the special effects, sets, costumes, and art direction are so beautiful, it screams hi.
I:422;567;"From the first shot, a surrealized VFX shot illustrating the snowy rooftops of London, I kept saying ""Wow"", under my breath."
I:422;568;ray and fans should be equally pleased.
I:422;569;more of a surprise, is the DTS.
I:422;570;Sound effects are awesome, with lots of rear channel activity complete with great directionality and pans (I had to!)
I:422;571;howard's brilliant, magical score comes heart.
I:422;572;poundingly to life in all its lossless glory.
I:422;573;Dialogue is crisp and well.
I:422;574;It isnow the exhilarating scene I knew it was.
I:422;575;have for fans of the film, and certainly hi.
I:422;576;I am a Disney loyalist, but I have to admit that this is by far the most beautiful and artistic telling of Peter Pan ever put on film!
I:422;577;First of all, it is closer to the ORIGINAL book.
I:422;578;Secondly, they can now do stuff with live action movies and special effects that they could never do with earlier versions of Peter Pan films.
I:422;579;in my opinion the casting could have been a little better for Peter and Hook, but the girl who plays Wendy is absolutely perfect!!
I:422;580;"nobody loves Disney and ""Hook"" (1991) more than I do, but I think this is the ultimate version of Peter Pan!"
I:422;581;i ordered the wide screen version.
I:422;582;This is a wonderful movie to watch
I:422;583;"And Sumpter went above and beyond ""adequate""
I:422;584;Sumpter embodied this perfectly: his wide.
I:422;585;Also, Jeremy's incredible portrayal of emotion just shone through every second of the film: you absolutely cannot listen to him laugh and not laugh along with him, and when his eyes fill up with tears, it seems as though the world were coming to an end.
I:422;586;Sumpter as Peter was one of the most amazing acting performances I have ever seen .
I:422;587;the other characters were also perfect!
I:422;588;The sets were brilliant, and the music was indescribable!
I:422;589;I watched the film two days in a row it was so good!
I:422;590;"It was SO perfect
I:422;591;peter Pan the film was perfect in nearly every way.
I:422;592;I haven't seen this in year and watching it the other day i remembered why it was so great.
I:422;593;It is a cute retelling of the classic Peter Pan but more grown up with real people.
I:422;594;I'm a huge fan of fantasy films, and this one is just right.
I:422;595;I was pleasantly surprised with this film!Peter Pan for the first time is played by a child actor of suitable age, Jeremy Sumpter.
I:422;596;He pulls off the portrayal excellently.
I:422;597;Every smirk, movement of the eyebrow, and teasing laugh captures all the mischievous and adventurous charm that is Peter Pan.
I:422;598;He fulfills just about everything that is in her heart's desire.
I:422;599;that's what is very special about this film.
I:422;600;This is captured in a tender and sweet Dance of the Fairies.
I:422;601;I have never seen such an enchanting moment pictured on film.
I:422;602;It's a scene so memorably delicate, it often brings tears to my eyes.
I:422;603;It makes you want to go awwwwwwww!
I:422;604;there's another one of those endearing moments between Wendy and Peter Pan later in the film, but why spoil the fun of it?
I:422;605;The man is entirely dashing with amazing outfits (not just red).
I:422;606;This Capt Hook has taste, culture and cunning.
I:422;607;Isaacs is brilliant at striking the right balance of humour and malice in Hook without making him a caricature.
I:422;608;He's somewhat chivalrous and still manages to shows respect for his enemy.
I:422;609;He is constantly reminded of his mortality by the ticking clock in the belly of that menacing crocodile.
I:422;610;smee is a delightful comic relief but never a stooge.
I:422;611;The banter between him and Hook is humorous yet balanced enough to show that Hook is still in charge and not a man to be crossed.
I:422;612;the Darling children were absolutely darling without being over the top.
I:422;613;Rachel and Jeremy have great on.
I:422;614;screen chemistry which adds to the magic of the film.
I:422;615;Best of all is Tinkerbell.
I:422;616;Ludivine Sagnier is perfectly cast.
I:422;617;She is such an expressive actress, giving Tinkerbell an adoringly playful and mischievous charm suitable for a fairy jealous of Wendy's affections for Pan.
I:422;618;She's much closer to the Disney version of Tinkerbell except slightly less graceful.
I:422;619;this is a great film that'll be loved by all ages with memorable scenes full of adventure and enchantment enchanced by a brilliant score.
I:422;620;Congratualtions, PJ Hogan, you've created a masterpiece.
I:422;621;This is definitely one movie to add to your video library.
I:422;622;Also, to me, it is an adventurous film that I liked since I got it.
I:422;623;It`s the best Peter Pan movie yet (and I`m not saying that just because I have a small crush on Jeremy Sumpter, the boy who plays Peter in the film).
I:422;624;It`s the most faithful to the book, and it is entertaining.
I:422;625;It has something for everyone.
I:422;626;I loved the kids in this version, very cute and such good actors.
I:422;627;the film made me smile and even laugh out loud, and at times it brought tears to my eyes too.
I:422;628;The flying scenes were rather unspectacular but overall this is a worthy adaptation of the book.
I:422;629;action adaptation which is quite good.
I:422;630;I recommend this version for one.
I:422;631;time viewing only, as it's slightly intense for young audiences, but for those who think cartoons are only for babies, this is the version for you.
I:422;632;And the visuals are also really good, especially in the sequence when they're flying to Neverland.
I:422;633;I'll stick with the Disney version.
I:422;634;I absolutely love this movie and was so excited when Amazon had it in makes me so happy I give it such great reviews
I:422;635;It was fantastic , incredible, and I would watch 20 more times if given the option.
I:422;636;This is THE best film EVER!
I:422;637;The CG effects were perfect.
I:422;638;She obvisously has a natural talent for acting.
I:422;639;This movie stands on its own as a family film, an action/adventure movie, and as a play adaptation.
I:422;640;The CGI plays an important role, but is integrated so well that you never get the feeling you're watching a cartoon.
I:422;641;as an adaptation of the play, any liberties taken with J. m. Barrie's work serve to enhance the story within the film medium while giving due homage to the original.
I:422;642;The story is more than just that, what J. m. Barrie has given us, and what J. p. Hogan translated so well, is the definition of the male psyche.
I:422;643;It's funny to see such a reaction from a youngster.
I:422;644;I highly recommend this show for all children, adults, and family's.
I:422;645;I saw this movie a long time ago, but I still think its one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:422;646;I think its overall a very good movie and should be rated even better than 4.5!
I:422;647;OK, so I have 3 kids and they like to watch movies back to back.
I:422;648;This film is quite true to the original story, and contains some of the darker bits, which earlier versions had sanitized.
I:422;649;this is an exceptional film, with talented actors and beautiful cinematography.
I:422;650;I'm very happy I did.
I:422;651;This movie is simply amazing!!
I:422;652;Jason makes an awesome Hook and Jeremy makes an adorable Peter.
I:422;653;This is a top notch adaptation of the Peter Pan story.
I:422;654;So much of the script is language right out of the original book and it's beautiful!
I:422;655;"I felt the characters were perfectly cast and the ""coming of age"" aspect of the movie (which seems to turn some off) was handled very gracefully and with much sensitivity."
I:422;656;It's so subtle and sweet.
I:422;657;This is an excellent movie!
I:422;658;My 3 year old daughter loved it.
I:422;659;Would recomend to anyone and is a great movie for all ages.
I:422;660;it is a favorite of my grandchildren and mine.
I:422;661;It is acted by British actors throughout and the dialogue is understandable.
I:422;662;The story line follows the simple story of Peter Pan and Captain Hook well.
I:422;663;They are right in front of you every day.
I:422;664;My grandchildren, some of whom are 12 and over, still sit and watch this and are fascinated by the magical sequences throughout the movie.
I:422;665;growing up, this was one of my favorite movies and I was glad they have it on blu ray and couldnt be happier!
I:422;666;Peter Pan (2003) is one gorgeously produced film with lots of real heart put into it.
I:422;667;One of those rare films where the dazzling special effects actually takes a back seat to just a great classic children's story to be told here.
I:422;668;Jason Isaacs portrayal of Captain Hook has a excellent Basil Rathbone flavor to it.
I:422;669;Mr. Isaacs also portray's Mr. Darling to equally great effect.
I:422;670;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:422;671;It's such a great fantasy movie I have ever seen before.
I:422;672;Casting and custuming are excellent and screen.
I:422;673;And the kids,Jeremy, his friends and the girl are so cute.
I:422;674;So while the story is not new, this new verison of it is a sumptious visual feast, wonderful for both adults and children alike.
I:422;675;P. j. Hogan's retelling allows for some dramatic departures to help propel the story along, but generally stays to the well.
I:422;676;What he takes in creative licenses, he returns fourfold in absolute charm and beauty.
I:422;677;With generous use of special effects, and stunning visual displays, Neverland has come alive as never before.
I:422;678;It is storybook real, with scenery so thick it looks like you could cut it with a knife and find it full of frosting.
I:422;679;This is a dreamy film.
I:422;680;He brings a childish sensuality to the role, as he interacts innocently with Rachel Hurd.
I:422;681;Jason Isaacs follows Pan tradition and plays both Mr. Darling and Hook with appropriate meance and glee.
I:422;682;there is a real need for good movies that both children and adults can watch, and this is one of them.
I:422;683;A classic book will become a classic movie for generations to follow, to enjoy.
I:422;684;this version is the first full.
I:422;685;It is beautiful to watch.
I:422;686;destined to become a classic and will be around for many years to come just like Peter Pan.
I:422;687;There are some things that I really love about this movie.
I:422;688;I love Jason Isaacs as Hook, I've always loved the story, and I like it that this is a bit darker than the other versions of Peter Pan.
I:422;689;They really have a chance to show Peter as a real person, with feeling and emotions, instead of just an always happy little boy.
I:422;690;It seems the perfect live action Peter Pan movie can never be made.
I:422;691;Its facinating and wonderful and makes you want to be there.
I:422;692;"The relationship between Wendy and Peter and the ""kiss"" means more now too."
I:422;693;You can see how she is caught between the fun of childhood and the wonders of growing up.
I:422;694;we are going to let our kids watch this but with us at first.
I:422;695;Bought for a family member who had it on their wish list and she absolutely loved it!
I:422;696;It was a great addition to her collection,
I:422;697;This movie is a wonderful fun filled movie for children and family.
I:422;698;Highly recommend for all in the family.
I:422;699;This is such a great version of Peter Pan!
I:422;700;Great story line that follows the original but has its own special path.
I:422;701;This movie will grab you from the opening credits.
I:422;702;This is a great, great film about Peter Pan.
I:422;703;I've read other reviewers whining about the romantisism between Peter and Wendy but, come on and let's face it, it's always been there and we know that.
I:422;704;(Kids movie, ahem)The best and most touching scene of the film (and if you're a big kid at heart, it will make you cry) is the resurrection of Tinkerbell.
I:422;705;"This was so well done and you really feel like chanting: ""I do believe in fairies, I do, I do."
I:422;706;The music is phenomenal and the special effects are fantastic.
I:422;707;They are good but the style is a mix of storybook and stage.
I:422;708;captain Hook and Mr. Darling are played by Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy from Harry Potter) and he does a great job as Hook.
I:422;709;wood plays Wendy and does a fantastic job.
I:422;710;Jeremy Sumpter plays a perfect Peter Pan and does a great job.
I:422;711;But, it is easily overlooked because of the great jobs they all did with their roles.
I:422;712;if you have an imagination, you will love this movie.
I:422;713;this is an instant classic.
I:422;714;Holy smoke, kids, what a great movie!
I:422;715;I haven't seen a movie with this much magic, sincerity, laughs, tears.
I:422;716;and if you are a kid it is an excellent adventure.
I:422;717;P. j. Hogan has truly directed a masterpiece and I highly recommend it to ANYONE!!!
I:422;718;My daughter and I have watched it together numerous times.
I:422;719;This is our favorite version.
I:422;720;Throughout the film, Wendy begins to discover herself emotionally and sexually.
I:422;721;She is interested in him romantically.
I:422;722;She finds secret ways to tell Peter that she likes him.
I:422;723;After the kiss, Wendy knows it is now time to grow up.
I:422;724;Shipped Fast, Good price, good movie.
I:422;725;Was a gift for my grandmother who loves this movie so not much else to say.
I:422;726;But they all give this version a two thumbs up.
I:422;727;This has got to one of the finest Peter Pan film adaptation ever to grace the Silver Screen.
I:422;728;The storytelling gets deeper as we learn more about Wendy and that there is so much more to life than being a boy and having fun.
I:422;729;It's not just about wanting to grow up, it's about friendship and adventure.
I:422;730;Peter Pan may live in a fantasy world past the stars and straight on till morning, but he is still young and always will reamin young at heart.
I:422;731;The visual effects are astonishing and better than ever can be imagined.
I:422;732;And so is James Newton Howard's score is heart.
I:422;733;It makes you want to believe in Peter Pan.
I:422;734;It is falling apart now but I piece it together and keep it in my rather extensive private library with myother classics.
I:422;735;Anyhow this movie I rated with 5 stars because not only was it very faithful to thebook but extremely well made, with a superb cast and excellent special effects.
I:422;736;Still, no big deal and if fact it worked well in the movie.
I:422;737;Some of the surreal effects during the first journey to Neverland was weird but added to the fantasy.
I:422;738;The flying effects are verywell done, including a very cute but very jealous Tinker Bell.
I:422;739;there is a lovely flying.
I:422;740;This whole story is basically an adolescent lovestory, innocent and touching.
I:422;741;Hook is eaten by the Crockand the Ship is commandeered by Peter and the aid of the fairies including a forgiven Tink, take Wendy, her brothers and theLost Boys back to London in a beautifully filmed sequence.
I:422;742;Mr Darling and his sexy wife adopt the lost boys, and Peter andTink return to Neverland.
I:422;743;She agrees to let the children visit Neverland some day.
I:422;744;Disneys is very good but this film is better.
I:422;745;One of the first things I did therewas visit the famous statue of the little lost boy that so entertained me when I was a child.
I:422;746;I recommend this file enthusiastically!!
I:422;747;My 4 year old loves this adaptation of Peter Pan.
I:422;748;So glad we bought it.
I:422;749;During one particular scene I literally got chills up my spine because it was so powerful.
I:422;750;Never before has a simple, classic story been made so profound and thought provoking!
I:422;751;I also recommend the soundtrack.
I:422;752;The music in this movie added greatly to its charm and feeling.
I:422;753;Jeremy Stumpter was amazing as Peter Pan, I dont think anyone else could fill in that role then him.
I:422;754;Hes a heartthrob girls, Watch Out.
I:422;755;peter Pan is a GREAT movie of all ages and something the whole family can enjoy.
I:422;756;This movie is now one of my favorites!
I:422;757;This is great movie and I recomend it for everybody.
I:422;758;I didn't really know what to expect of it, all of my friends reall love this movie so i bought it.
I:422;759;It also arrive the day before it was suppose to.
I:422;760;The cast is excellent and each plays their part to the fullest.
I:422;761;The home underground is absolutely amazing and the forest is breath.
I:422;762;I also love the fairies especially the scene where they are dancing.
I:422;763;This is one of the films most memorable and breath.
I:422;764;The pirate ship and the sword fighting scenes are classic.
I:422;765;The actors are great with Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan, Rachel Hurd Wood as the beautiful Wendy and Jasson Isaacs in the dual role of Mr. Darling/Captain Hook.
I:422;766;Overall, this is a great movie and while being somewhat over.
I:422;767;This is my eight year old granddaughters favorite movie.
I:422;768;I didn't expect much from Peter Pan, I figured if you seen one you've them all.
I:422;769;"wood ""in her first role"" are well casted as Peter and Wendy."
I:422;770;They both have really good chemestry.
I:422;771;Sumpter completely nails the role of Peter.
I:422;772;He's afraid of growing up and enjoys being a kid a lot yet there's still a sadness to him.
I:422;773;Anyway him and Wood are great in their roles and it's the best acting I've seen from young actors in awhile.
I:422;774;jason Isaacs (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) is equally good as Captain Hook.
I:422;775;The Neverland scenery looks a lot better than it did in Hook too.
I:422;776;Peter Pan has fantasy, adventure and romance and is great for the whole family.
I:422;777;It's a really good movie and deserved more of an audience than it got while in theatres.
I:422;778;I gave this as a gift .
I:422;779;very well received, in fact, one of the favorites of my 8 year old nephew.
I:422;780;otherwise this movie deserves 5 stars.
I:422;781;Jason Isaacs and Jeremy Sumpter are incredible actors, the emotions are really there!
I:422;782;In addition to the beautiful Olivia Williams who plays Mrs Darling, all the actors were great.
I:422;783;Most of all however, we were really amazed that Jeremy Sumpter, a child actor at 12/13 years old during production, had learned to fight with a sword, fly with a harness and make it look real, do 98% of the stunts himself and acted in such a convincing way that you really believed that he was the real Peter Pan.
I:422;784;There is so much depth to this Peter Pan, the boy that would not grow up, that in some scenes, Jeremy really tugs at your heart.
I:422;785;Credit should go to the casting director for finding such a gifted boy.
I:422;786;In my view he is forever immortalized as the real Peter Pan.
I:422;787;It is definitely the best adaptation of the original book by J. m. Barrie that I have ever seen, I just wish that I would have seen it on the silver screen in 2003.
I:422;788;Both children and adults will enjoy this movie.
I:422;789;The Bonus features will give you the opportunity to further appreciate the hard work and dedication that went into the making of this wonderous movie.
I:422;790;She has seen most of the movies available so i was happy to have found this old timer to add to the fun when she visited.
I:422;791;This was a fantastic live action version of the popular tale.
I:422;792;My 5 year old daughter and I enjoyed watching it.
I:422;793;He is, in our opinion, the best actor that could have been picked to play Peter.
I:422;794;The rest of the cast is great too.
I:422;795;Jason Issacs is great as Hook.
I:422;796;one more thing: Jeremy, we love you, we are the same age as you, we always keep our windows open!!!
I:422;797;for hours Peter and Hook fightIt doesn't last forever but it is dazzlingEach is as brave in the face of dangerThere can only be one winner and that is Peter.
I:422;798;This take on the familiar fairy tale is somewhat interesting for its subversive, sexualized treatment of the main characters.
I:422;799;This works both for and against the film.
I:422;800;In previous versions of the story Pan's final battle with Captain Hook served as a satisfying resolution to the former's conventional hero.
I:422;801;The young boy is, however, good looking enough to convincingly play the object of a young adolescent girl's lust, which works well for the development of the film's real protagonist, Wendy.
I:422;802;the actress playing Wendy, with her sinful mouth playing in marked distinction to her girlish demeanor (something that is remarked upon repeatedly in the film), is very good at conveying the initial throws of womanhood and all the self.
I:422;803;Indeed this whole adolescent psychosexual motif is brought further into light when we consider the fact that the film is infused with so much nocturnal and dream imagery.
I:422;804;Like so much of contemporary visual media, the film's language belongs to the hyperreality of television commercials and music videos.
I:422;805;The film is more glossy than polished, more pretty than beautiful, which leaves us, rather disappointingly, with something that is more interesting to discuss afterwards than to actually watch.
I:422;806;action version of the classic is that increasingly rare phenomenon: a movie that balances wondrous special effects with an intelligent, faithful rendering of charming story.
I:422;807;Sumpter makes a superb Peter.
I:422;808;I'd probably give it something like 4 1/2 if I could.
I:422;809;It captures the wonder and adventure of the best childhood daydreams but it also does something more.
I:422;810;wood, in a stunning debut, gives Wendy a complexity seldom seen from child actors.
I:422;811;Pretty heady stuff for a children's film and it's simply amazing how well this film keeps it all together.
I:422;812;Jeremy Sumpter is terrific as Peter, although his performance has some awkward moments, mainly because he's the only American cast member.
I:422;813;What keeps his performance good is his amazing physical presence and his naturally, likeable cockiness.
I:422;814;This Peter has the happy.
I:422;815;Combine all this with amazing visuals and a number of entertaining set pieces and you have a film that literally touches every joy a movie can.
I:422;816;If I ever have kids, this will be the first PG film I ever let them see.
I:422;817;If you read the book in class for Common Bore, this is a good movie to reward your class with.
I:422;818;This movie is one of my favorites!
I:422;819;It truly captures the spirit and feeling of J. M. Barrie's book, and it is a great film for the whole family.
I:422;820;I recommend this to everyone!
I:422;821;Our 4 year old loves it and has wathced it over 20 times already or more.
I:422;822;The young actor playing Peter has such cute facial expressions.
I:422;823;All the children are adorable and the actor who plays Hook is very good in this role.
I:422;824;All actors are very good.
I:422;825;He absolutely loves to watch this over and over!
I:422;826;Great movie to have on these cold, winter days to entertain the 6 yr old.
I:422;827;This is a truely wonderful film.
I:422;828;The special effects are amazing!
I:422;829;the casting and acting, supurb.
I:422;830;She calls it the Real Peter Pan.
I:422;831;It is also a good movie for us adults who don't want to grow up!
I:422;832;They are also very well done.
I:422;833;This does justice to Barrie's timeless tale.
I:422;834;My wife and I have seen Peter Pan many times since it opened on Christmas day.
I:422;835;Jeremy Sumpter is the perfect embodiment of Peter Pan.
I:422;836;He also plays the part of Mr. Darling.
I:422;837;Lynn Redgrave as Aunt Millicent is quit funny in the shadow scene.
I:422;838;As for those playing Mrs. Darling, John and Micheal, Nana, the Teacher, the Messenger Boy, the Bankers, the Lost Boys, the Pirates, the Mermaids, the Indians, and who could forget Tinkerbell are all wonderful in their respective roles.
I:422;839;The sets are very detailed and beautiful but not necessarily realistic looking.
I:422;840;The special effects are top notch.
I:422;841;So making it look wrong makes it look exactly right!
I:422;842;One of Diana's favorite charities was London's Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital.
I:422;843;established those rights to Peter Pan as a 1 time special exception for as long as the Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital exists.
I:422;844;Wow, this is the best adaptation related to Peter Pan I have ever seen.
I:422;845;Great film, footage, cast, acting, scenery = AMAZING!
I:422;846;Although I hear a lot of controversy over whether Jeremy Sumpter fit the role of an English boy, I believe he is the perfect Peter Pan.
I:422;847;Oh my gosh, I love this movie!!!
I:422;848;I've always liked the srory of Peter Pan but I never thought I would be so into it.
I:422;849;Jeremy Sumpter makes the movie come alive.
I:422;850;He is so inspiring I've always wanted to be a model and he was one and we have so much in common.
I:422;851;I hope to someday meet this 15 year.
I:422;852;I love him so much and I'm not upsessed I just love his movies and his personality and intrests.
I:422;853;I will always watch this movie when I but two copies and tell everyone how great this movie is.
I:422;854;so why did I see it again?
I:422;855;I'm sure it's okay for kids too.
I:422;856;This was a great movie for my Granddaughter.
I:422;857;great experience in never never land.
I:422;858;She wants to watch the movie all the time.
I:422;859;was seriously worthy of an Oscar.
I:422;860;this is the best movie i ever saw.
I:422;861;its probably cuz jeremy was in it and hes sooooooooo cute and talented.
I:422;862;well bac 2 the movie.
I:422;863;Director J. p. Hogan does an amazing job blending the child.
I:422;864;tale classic with the underlining mature issues that play such a large role in the original book.
I:422;865;This is, hands down, the best rendition of the story to date, not to mention the best children's movie I've seen since the days of my own childhood.
I:422;866;In my opinion, the Peter Pan movie is the most fantastic fantasy movie I've ever seen, beating The Lord Of the Ring and Harry Potter in my personal record as I've seen it more than 130 times, while LOR or HP less than 100 times.
I:422;867;this Peter Pan version is the version I'd wished to see, the romance between Peter and Wendy.
I:422;868;Not to mention how cute both Jeremy and Rachel were, what a lovely couple!
I:422;869;Great Version with a great cast.
I:422;870;This is an amazing version of Peter Pan.
I:422;871;All the actors were amazing (I was very impressed by Jeremy Sumpter and Rachel Hurd.
I:422;872;wood), it was very true to the book, and it was visually stunning.
I:422;873;It was one of the most magical things I've ever seen.
I:422;874;Peter Pan is a classic story that everyone loves.
I:422;875;This movie shows all the charm of being a kid and the dangers of growing up.
I:422;876;It shows first love and many adventures that only children can have.
I:422;877;This is one movie that is great for anyone.
I:422;878;This is a fantastic representation of Peter Pan on the big screen.
I:422;879;I always recommend this to people, especially if they've only seen the Disney cartoon version!
I:422;880;Of course Peter was such fun to watch because he has a charming boyishness to him.
I:422;881;"Wendy is fun to see, too
I:422;882;This will keep both children and adults entertained and leave you with so many happy thoughts!
I:422;883;Quite simply, this one is the best.
I:422;884;the faults are tiny and easy to overlook, and the good aspects too numerous to go into.
I:422;885;The cast is quite simply astoundingly good.
I:422;886;Darling, Smee and Tinkerbell) are better than any others I've seen, and I've seen some fine performances in each role.
I:422;887;The supporting cast is equally well.
I:422;888;When all the elements mesh so well, that means good directing, and PJ Hogan deserves a big round of applause for that.
I:422;889;hum attempts at the story (I include the Disney animated among them), it's so nice to see someone really do it right.
I:422;890;This is a great family movie.
I:422;891;Our 10 year old and 8 year old love this film.
I:422;892;It was the perfect movie for family movie night.
I:422;893;In my my mind I always had a vision of a more realistic movie version of Pan.
I:422;894;Well, my dream has come true with the release of Director, P. j. Hogan's live action version of Peter Pan .
I:422;895;At last, the folks in Hollywood (or Australia in this case) got it right!
I:422;896;On that night Wendy and her younger brothers, Michael John discover the magical, Peter Pan (and his fairy sidekick, Tinkerbelle).
I:422;897;Where do you start with on describing how wonderful this film version is?
I:422;898;Director/Writer P. j. Hogan has created a storybook fantasy world which is like a surreal dreamscape.
I:422;899;Hogan pretty closely sticks to the original Barrie tale.
I:422;900;He shows us the adventurous childhood delights of Never Neverland without sanitizing it's dangers (witness the spooky scene with those evil looking mermaids!)
I:422;901;The casting in the film is almost perfect.
I:422;902;She does a really good job of showing us a young lady, who is overcoming her fears of leaving childhood behind and entering adolecence.
I:422;903;Jeremy Sumpter is fine (but a little wooden) in the lead title role.
I:422;904;He shows us Peter Pan as heroic, but also a tragic figure, because he refuses to grow up and accept the love he really craves.
I:422;905;But the film really belongs to actor, Jason Isaacs, who pretty much steals the show in the dual roles of Mr. darling Captain Hook.
I:422;906;Everything in this film is just done so right.
I:422;907;From the eye popping special effects (the flying scenes are amazing), to the marvelous cinematography to the brilliant set design and the warm musical score.
I:422;908;It is all so perfect.
I:422;909;The widescreen picture is crisp and clear and the 5.1 sound is great.
I:422;910;"It is surprising that some other reviewers think that the most dangerous thing this film will teach kids is how to ""mouth"" kiss."
I:422;911;Follows closely to the script, and is still a fun movie to watch.
I:422;912;Great for the whole family to watch.
I:422;913;the visuals in this film are beautiful.
I:422;914;It is breathtaking at times.
I:422;915;The costumes were nice as well.
I:422;916;The acting, lead by the grand performances of Jason Isaacs(Capt. Hook/Mr.
I:422;917;Lynn Redgrave gave a solid performance in the small role of Aunt Millicent, and Olivia Williams was good as Mrs. Darling.
I:422;918;Perhaps the most standout performance of them all was the lovely Ludivine Sagnier.
I:422;919;As Tinkerbell, she obviously had the most playful part in the movie.
I:422;920;Her face was like rubber, full of twisted and funny faces.
I:422;921;Her jealousy of Wendy was played out almost to a cruel level, making her one of the hardest characters to pull for, but she loved Peter so dearly that you really wanted to cheer her on.
I:422;922;The rest of the cast did a superb job.
I:422;923;It loved the taste of his hand so much, that it wants to sample the rest of his body as well.
I:422;924;In other words, they just want someone to love them when they are hurt or scared, and tell them a good story once in awhile.
I:422;925;Wendy wants adventure, but also the security of home.
I:422;926;in closing, if you have young children(ages 5.13), they'll probably enjoy this movie for its swashbuckling adventure and wonderful story.
I:422;927;Adults will find it nice to think back to the days when they were a kid and wished that they too, could be young forever.
I:422;928;the movie had you guessing the whole time.
I:422;929;i wasnt all that excited about seeing it at first, but as soon as the movie started, i got all up in it.
I:422;930;id recommend it to anyone who loves a great movie.
I:422;931;As much as I love anything to do with Peter Pan, I had NEVER seen this movie!!
I:422;932;As with any interpretation, they mixed storylines together to create something new, and it worked beautifully.
I:422;933;This movie is absolutely stunning!!!
I:422;934;The real yet breathtakingly fantastical scenery, the sweet innocence of the young leads, and the adventurous storybook tone all add up to one incredible film, and if you haven't seen it, permit me to say that you are the wierdest person in the world.
I:422;935;Now I know: Peter Pan grabbed all the good ones!
I:422;936;Unlike some of Disney's live action movies, the casting directors were attentive with the lesser characters as well as the leads, and the result is a very strong fabric from which the actual story is made(I love the Tiger Lily and John parts!)
I:422;937;It is undoubtedly fun to watch but if you were a kid in the 90s, you'd know what happens next.
I:422;938;The music there had a very happy atmosphere.
I:422;939;i suppose the dog was one of the best actors.
I:422;940;I most appreciate animal actors.
I:422;941;Really, the dog was hilarious.
I:422;942;there were some long scenes that somehow dragged the movie a lot but anywho, it was still fun.
I:422;943;good for the familyKirstie Mabitad
I:422;944;This is simply a beautifully done remake of Peter Pan, as the story is supposed to be told.
I:422;945;A return to the original stage classic.
I:422;946;i laughed my head off through much of the tangles between Pan (Jeremy Sumpter) and Hook, because Pan was the smart aleck kid who got the best of an arrogant Hook.
I:422;947;The look on Hook's face when the croc comes around is great.
I:422;948;It's amazing that 12 year old boys and girls in some ways remain constant.
I:422;949;my granddaughter adored this on cable.
I:422;950;so I bought it for all of us to enjoy over and over again.
I:422;951;This was a gem of a movie that got lost in the year it was released.
I:422;952;Peter Pan (Jeremy Sumpter) stole my heart and Wendy (Rachel Hurd.
I:422;953;wood, an amazing debut role) is so full of life and independence, yet searching for that first love.
I:422;954;are you brave enough to experience a secret place, confident enough to let go of being an adult to experience the magic of flight again?
I:422;955;being the same age as jeremy i know i could never show as much emotion as him and i think they all did an amazing job.
I:422;956;i laughed, cried, and i had the biggest smile on my face cause it just an awsome movie.
I:422;957;i guarnntee u will love this movie.
I:422;958;You get an inside look onto the making of the ship, through the eyes of captain hook which takes you through Jason Isaac's POV camera, and you get to meet the other cast members and learn many things.
I:422;959;The Pirates Vs. the lost boys is which is better .
I:422;960;Ack The Black Castle plays the ending of Mermaids and has the picture of the Black Castle in the background and has options to see them making the black castle.
I:422;961;Learning to fly is kind of self explanatory.
I:422;962;Me and my shadow I found REALLY interesting.
I:422;963;I loved how they showed how they did the shadow work with Aunt Millicent .
I:422;964;one of my favorite scenes.
I:422;965;I also liked learning what Tiger Lily says in that indian language to Hook at that one point.
I:422;966;I liked watching them make the home and the interviews with the lost boysThe movie is the same as always .
I:422;967;This was so fast and easy to work with.
I:422;968;I really enjoyed the ease when shopping here.
I:422;969;I would def recommend to anyone!
I:422;970;This is the wonderful movie.
I:422;971;It really does the story justice.
I:422;972;I love all of the music.
I:422;973;peter Pan is one of the most beloved children stories in the whole world.
I:422;974;this movie proves the power of it's beauty with the story.You will love it if you want to see a true Peter Pan story.
I:422;975;This movie is just a real treasure.
I:422;976;It's great for anyone who still loves magic and Peter Pan.
I:422;977;Jason Isaacs's performance as both Mr. Darling and Captain Hook is, in short, brilliant.
I:422;978;wood ( Wendy Darling ) is really just pure magic.
I:422;979;Jeremy is a wonderful Peter.
I:422;980;Just his presence is unique and it is very hard to take your eyes off him, because his acting is so believable.
I:422;981;The costumes are brilliant and really make the cast stand out.
I:422;982;Everyone works so well together.
I:422;983;The special featuers are also a special treat.
I:422;984;this is a great family movie.
I:422;985;It teaches kids how to help friends, and facts and points about having to grow up.
I:422;986;But of course the real treasure that lies in Peter Pan is the beautiful magic itself.
I:422;987;Great movie that tries it's best to stick to the original story!
I:422;988;acting was fun and the story was true to the disney one.
I:422;989;My four year old son loved this movie.
I:422;990;My daughter and I just loved this when we saw it on cable.
I:422;991;Mommy is just as excited about it as she is!
I:422;992;Very well done version of the Peter Pan story.
I:422;993;Jason Isaacs is terrific in dual role of the Father and Captain Hook.
I:422;994;I found this movie to be enchanting and dark all at the same time.
I:422;995;there is much beauty in the scenery and the emotions in the characters.
I:422;996;Written over 100 years ago, the latest version of PETER PAN is said to be closer to the original story than the beloved Disney film.
I:422;997;"Excellent, ""amazing,"" and ""great,"" were the words by the patrons as they left the screening."
I:422;998;I recommend this movie for the child or the child at heart who too will never grow old.
I:422;999;Peter Pan is a family hit, again.
I:422;1000;Movie is very good, full of adventure and one of my grandchildren's favorites.
I:422;1001;Peter Pan is one of those wonderful stories that everyone knows, even if they have never read the book.
I:422;1002;The tale probably reached its widest audience with the well.
I:422;1003;The result is truly spectacular.
I:422;1004;Young Jeremy Sumpter, playing Peter Pan, is particularly impressive, instilling the part with just the right amount of boyish mischievousness without going over the top.
I:422;1005;His relationship with Wendy (played by talented Rachel Hurd.
I:422;1006;Captain Hook is a delightfully menacing enemy, Smee is the usual goofy sidekick, and the infamous ticking crocodile is in rare form.
I:422;1007;It's nice to see an old classic return with a bit of polish, and boy does it shine.
I:422;1008;What a fantastic rendition of Peter Pan!
I:422;1009;The director used CGI and other modern film magic techniques to bring this classic to life .
I:422;1010;It is fun to remember being a kid again.
I:422;1011;A family favorite tale told in a fun way to be enjoyed by a wide audience.
I:422;1012;Keep in mind it is a kid friendly film so it will be cheesy but if you know that going into the film then I think you will enjoy it more.
I:422;1013;the special effects and especially the flying was superb.
I:422;1014;I'm in love with this movie.
I:422;1015;I knew I would love it from those few clips I remembered.
I:422;1016;that and I've always had a love of the while idea behind Peter Pan!I got this on the date Amazon had told me.
I:422;1017;Shipping was great and fast.
I:422;1018;hey, this is one of the greatest movies that i have ever seen.
I:422;1019;ever since ive seen this movie i have done anything to see it again.
I:422;1020;i totally recomend it to anyone that wants to laugh and cry.
I:422;1021;We were both so impressed with this movie that we felt we had to let the rest of the world know how fantastic it was.
I:422;1022;From an adult perspective this movie was visually stunning and well written and acted.
I:422;1023;When it is so hard to find a movie that the whole family cannot only watch, but enjoy, this movie completely surprised and delighted me.
I:422;1024;I think you have to have a part of your inner child still alive and kicking to really get this much darker, realistic, film as compared to the Disney version.
I:422;1025;Overall it was a far more rewarding movie in my opinion (and my son enjoyed it more too).
I:422;1026;on the one hand there are the fantastic elements as Peter Pan (Jeremy Sumpter) and the Darling children Wendy (Rachel Hurd.
I:422;1027;land than every before for all the wonderful computer generated images.
I:422;1028;More importantly, these are more realistic children than ever before.
I:422;1029;in this Peter Pan a kiss is more than just a thimble.
I:422;1030;we also have the most realistic Captain Hook (Jason Issacs) of our acquaintance as well.
I:422;1031;ultimately the power running throughout this story is the power of the story.
I:422;1032;I especially liked the way the film plays the beginning of the reunion of the scene, a nice underscoring of the idea that you can wish for something so hard that you do not notice when you have it.
I:422;1033;this is a stunning visual film, but it is also a film of substance that mines Barrie's idea of the boy who would not grow up for everything it is worth.
I:422;1034;This Peter Pan has a depth greater than every all the other versions we have seen on the silver screen to date.
I:422;1035;This is a glorious film and even if few will really appreciate it the way it truly deserves, there is still the fact that just coming into contact with it will open the minds of its viewers to the greater realm of meaning and significance.
I:422;1036;Besides, there is always the possibility that somewhere down the road as they enjoy this beautiful film again and again, that eventually they will appreciate what it is all about.
I:422;1037;I loved this movie so much.
I:422;1038;I have already seen it twice in the theatre.
I:422;1039;Hes the same age as me, and hes really cute.
I:422;1040;The movie is really sweet, and made me cry a couple of times.
I:422;1041;This movie is appropriate for all family members.
I:422;1042;Very good movie, beautiful music!
I:422;1043;The young actors are very good.
I:422;1044;The two movies together make a pretty seamless duology.
I:422;1045;ray as the visuals are just amazing.
I:422;1046;There's a great user review of this on IMDB.
I:422;1047;cOM that really does a nice job of showcasing this movie's strengths.
I:422;1048;"This movie succeeds in both the creation of an exciting adventure and of a ""coming of age"" film."
I:422;1049;The frightening experience of puberty was handled breathtakingly and with sensitivity (and wouldn't everyone love to take Peter's lead and not have to experience that part of it at all?!)
I:422;1050;old frame left the theatre full of youthful energy, and remembering that however scary growing up is .
I:422;1051;you can retain your sense of wonder and love of fun (without all the schtick that plagued Hook).
I:422;1052;Peter Pan is one of my favorite films.
I:422;1053;for kids I recommend :)
I:422;1054;Everything about it is visually stunning and entertaining.
I:422;1055;The story and acting warm the heart.
I:422;1056;This movie will bring it out in you.
I:422;1057;This is the best way to spend the evening with your children.
I:422;1058;It is very well done, and the actors made this a Neverland not to forget.
I:422;1059;I think this film was amazing.
I:422;1060;I love the actors and actresses chosen.
I:422;1061;I find their acting is amazing and many actors such as Peter pan, Jason isaacs is absolutely gorgeous, i have fallen in love with him!!
I:422;1062;I think the actress who played Wendy is positively beautiful and her acting is also amazing.
I:422;1063;I am Hannah (age 9)and I think this is a cool movie.
I:422;1064;I enjoyed this movie very much.
I:422;1065;This was a perfect movie to watch on blu.
I:422;1066;The adaptation was a spectacular rendition of the childhood story that captivated the entire family.
I:422;1067;It was dazzling and fun to watch.
I:422;1068;I recommend it to everyone.
I:422;1069;A little cheesy at times, but overall a great movie to enjoy with the family.
I:422;1070;It's bittersweet and heartfelt as all first loves always are.
I:422;1071;My grandaughte lIves Peter Pan, so this is her favorite version.
I:422;1072;As of now it is at her house.
I:422;1073;I've been in love with the story of Peter Pan for many many years, thanks to my mum.
I:422;1074;The actors (all of them) did a superb job of rounding out their characters, the writing was very true to the original story, the costumes were magnificent without being overly done (as they had been in 'Hook') and the sets were rich in feeling and tone.
I:422;1075;The movie was magical, as should be.
I:422;1076;jason Isaacs (as seen in the Harry Potter movies as Lucius Malfoy) was incredible as Mr. Darling/Captain Hook.
I:422;1077;He created depth and subtext in Hook I had not previously considered.
I:422;1078;wood as Wendy Darling was a treat as well.
I:422;1079;Playing Wendy as a capable girl who is strong and self reliant, yet charming and delicate.
I:422;1080;And this being her first movie, I suggest keeping an eye on her.
I:422;1081;Truly a gem for anyone and especially those who have ever dreamt of Neverland, or wish to return.
I:422;1082;I really liked the new version of Peter Pan.
I:422;1083;I have seen all the other movies (both the 1st and 2nd animated ones and both live musicals where a female actor plays Peter) but this is my favorite.
I:422;1084;It is more mature than all the other ones and very clearly shows the disadcantage to remaining young forever: you will never develop true feelings.
I:422;1085;It is definitely more mature than the animated one or even the stage version, so I would not recommend that very young children see it.
I:422;1086;Great movie and story for sharing with children.
I:422;1087;I took my girls to see this at the theatere, and I had no idea that I would enjoy it so much!!
I:422;1088;This movie was worth watching again and again!!
I:422;1089;Hogan skillfully revives Barrie's original concept of the story as a coming.
I:422;1090;This movie got to me in great condition a few days after i ordered it.
I:422;1091;As far as content and characters, this meets the book fairly well.
I:422;1092;The book was fierce and fiery, and every adaptation so far has been lighthearted beyond reason.
I:422;1093;The boy who played Peter did so wonderfully.
I:422;1094;He had spunk, cockiness, charm, sorrow, and (a refreshing change) the fact that he's MALE all added up to make him a good choice.
I:422;1095;Otherwise, all the characters were excellent looking.
I:422;1096;The costumes closely matched the book, most of the scenes were pretty good, the fight scenes were nearly realistic, and there was humor, sadness, loss, regret, redemption, forgiveness, and love .
I:422;1097;all the aspects of a good children's movie.
I:422;1098;Definitely worth seeing if you loved the book.
I:422;1099;The Disney version is still probably my least favorite fairy tale adaptation of all of the Disney animated films.
I:422;1100;never before has this story been presented with the very important angle of the innocent romance between Wendy and Peter, an angle that goes a long way in explaining both the reluctance and the desire to grow up.
I:422;1101;adding to this the wonderful chemistry between Jeremy Sumpter and Rachel Hurd.
I:422;1102;wood and you have a movie that appeals to kids on an adventure level and to adults on an emotional level.
I:422;1103;And I have to say that this movie contained one of the sweetest on.
I:422;1104;on decision, because their very natural fascination with each other and awkwardness about these new and amazing feelings showed in every one of their scenes together.
I:422;1105;the film itself is beautiful and lush.
I:422;1106;finally, I simply loved the casting of this film.
I:422;1107;confident and cocky with a grin that is going to turn into a wicked lady.
I:422;1108;killer someday, yet still he showed Peter's ultimate sadness so very well.
I:422;1109;Previous adaptations highlight childhood as an ideal time of innocence and play.
I:422;1110;it presents a realistic vision of childhood within the context of a fantasy.
I:422;1111;But that also means that he's perpetually on the brink of puberty.
I:422;1112;In Wendy he finds a maternal figure that he and the Lost Boys crave, but also a budding love interest.
I:422;1113;Peter and Wendy are very much innocent children in that regard but there in the hint of it being a possibility someday.
I:422;1114;The pirates and mermaids also have a degree of menace but it's something that children can face in order to conquer.
I:422;1115;the special effects and CGI are visually wonderful and gives us a more believeable Neverland.
I:422;1116;It's still a fantasy but we are able to believe in it for the duration of the film.
I:422;1117;The suspension of disbelief that the film requires (in older viewers at least) is aided by fine performances all around.
I:422;1118;Jeremy Sumpter is mischivous and cute, and slightly obnoxious at times as the title character and Rachel Hurd.
I:422;1119;wood is beautiful, adventurous and lively as Wendy.
I:422;1120;Ludavine Sangier is comic and slightly homicidal as Tinkerbell and Jason Isaacs steals his scenes in a dual role as Captain Hook and Mr. Darling.
I:422;1121;"usually a ""family film"" means something adults have to sit through while kids enjoy it."
I:422;1122;This is one of the few films that truely does provide enjoyment and even a little insight for both the young and old.
I:422;1123;perfectly cast, perfectly filmed, and perfectly wonderful.
I:422;1124;The special effects are just that, special.
I:422;1125;so special, if fact, that they don't intrude at all, but make the whole adventure infinitely deep and ultimately believable.
I:422;1126;His charismatic smile, in particular, drew me in, and I didn't doubt for a moment that Wendy and her brothers would throw away everything they knew and loved to fly away with him.
I:422;1127;Actually, my rating for the movie is 5 stars, but for the sound it's ONE star:I was impressed with the movie .
I:422;1128;Jeremy Sumpter is an absolutely PERFECT Peter Pan .
I:422;1129;the music to show excitement .
I:422;1130;I was very impressed with this version of Peter Pan.
I:422;1131;My Aunt took my cousins to see it in the movie theater (which is probably the best place to see it due to the amazing special effects)and she loved it and they loved it.
I:422;1132;I am usually very sensitive to what could be inappropriate or scary for young viewers, for some reason this movie did not bother me even though it is very action packed (the happy and exciting scenes made up for some of the scary one's).
I:422;1133;the movie's set is very lush and colorful and their are a lot of special effects that make a beautiful fantasy.
I:422;1134;The acting really pulled the movie together, the actors all had perfect comedic timing, even the young kids were great.
I:422;1135;Fortunately this can still be enjoyed.
I:422;1136;LOVE this movie and its amazing on Blu.
I:422;1137;ray which makes it watchable over and over again.
I:422;1138;It is just a great movie all around.
I:422;1139;The production values are top rate, terrific acting (in addition to the extremely entertaining Isaacs, who gives 150% in dual roles as dad and Hook, I enjoyed seeing the great Richard Briers as Smee).
I:422;1140;The special features are just as interesting as the movie itself.
I:422;1141;Highly recommended for anyone, it's not just a family film.
I:422;1142;I'm surprised nobody's mentioned the music.
I:422;1143;All I can say is, WOW!!
I:422;1144;It was totally beautiful and precisely perfect.
I:422;1145;the acting by the children was superb and realistic.
I:422;1146;Peter was an excellent representation of so many boys I've known, while Wendy reminded me of so many girls and, well, myself.
I:422;1147;"Jeremy Sumpter plays the title role in ""Peter Pan"" this time, and does a credible job as the boy who wouldn't grow up (although he's no Robin Williams)."
I:422;1148;Great movie, great classic, great music, everything was cast and acted perfectly.
I:422;1149;Jeremy, Rachel, Jason were terrific and tinkerbell gave a really funny comic relief.
I:422;1150;It's a great story that was remade beautifully!
I:422;1151;The elements are all there and the music is amazing.
I:422;1152;i watch this one with my little girl all the time.
I:422;1153;This is an amazing Peter Pan movie, having read the book I have to say that it's the most acurate out of all the Peter Pan Movies Ive seen , and Ive seen all of them.
I:422;1154;this is the best version of the classical story.
I:422;1155;highly reccomend it!A great show for kids and adults to enjoy together
I:422;1156;Peter Pan is by far the best movie i have ever seen in my life.
I:422;1157;It is so sweet, the whole wendy and peter thing that had going.
I:422;1158;And it doesn't just apply to girls, the fighting scenes are amazing.
I:422;1159;they really did a good job.
I:422;1160;Jeremy Sumpter is awesome, he is precious too.
I:422;1161;his smile, thats all i have to say.
I:422;1162;wendy is so lucky i do believe.
I:422;1163;Anyway i would recomend this movie to everyone, its the best EVERRRRR!
I:422;1164;"Peter's shadow dances and leaps
I:422;1165;We finally have the technology to make a proper Peter Pan movie, and this one makes full use of it.
I:422;1166;but it's so much more than CGI effects.
I:422;1167;This has to be the most emotionally layered Pan film, if not children's film, ever made.
I:422;1168;She and Peter, who are brilliantly portrayed by their respective actors, begin to discover romantic attraction through each other.
I:422;1169;the magic and romance are also punctuated with witty humor, like The Princess Bride or The Brothers Grimm.
I:422;1170;Smee never gets too much important but some of the best lines in the film are from his own dry observations.
I:422;1171;It is an incredible movie and it deserves to seen and owned.
I:422;1172;What I hate most of all is a film that looks wonderful, should be wonderful, and then is wretched.
I:422;1173;The previews for this film, by PJ Hogan, made it look extraordinary: dark, mysterious, adult.
I:422;1174;So I was hoping for something dark, mysterious, and adult.
I:422;1175;sure it has great effects and brilliant cinematography (I love the image of Wendy laying on the grass), but for all its stunning visuals, the film never decides what it wants to be.
I:422;1176;wood, as Wendy, is marvelous, in honesty I think one of the best performances of the year.
I:422;1177;Darling, is good but not great.
I:422;1178;If i had walked in knowing nothing, I may have enjoyed it more.
I:422;1179;to me, the best one ever made .
I:422;1180;i love how dreamlike Never Never Land is portrayed here.
I:422;1181;She has, after all, a vivid imagination.
I:422;1182;I like how egocentric Peter is, how much a master of his domain he is .
I:422;1183;Instead of the animated version we are all a costume to, this film has actual actors, actresses and sets.
I:422;1184;The casting in this film is something that everyone should enjoy.
I:422;1185;For example, Tink is played by a French actress by the name of Ludivine Sagnier.
I:422;1186;She has a whole assortment of fabulous expressions and body movements to actually become Peter's fairy.
I:422;1187;"Wendy is on the brink of becoming a young woman
I:422;1188;It is then that we are introduced to the main character, Peter Pan himself, played by Jeremy Sumpter.
I:422;1189;Wendy knows in her heart that she must grow up because it is a part of life and it is what she is intended to do.
I:422;1190;The magical, the excitement, the wonder of the true Peter Pan comes to life for the first time in this spellbinding fantasy.
I:422;1191;brimming with spectacular special effects and non.
I:422;1192;"new adventure is sure to be a family film for years to come!"""
I:422;1193;I don't remember loving the Disney version of Peter Pan that much, but I have a gorgeous illustrated book sitting at home, which I've had since I was a kid (and continues the story of Peter coming back as Wendy grows up), and I love Hook!
I:422;1194;I thought they looked familiar!)
I:422;1195;Also the kids played on my nerves a bit.
I:422;1196;Jason Sumpter was OK playing Peter, he's totally your stereotypical picture of Peter, but there was something always quite right.
I:422;1197;the thing I loved about the book (and the wee bit in Hook) was Peter coming back and seeing Wendy growing up.
I:422;1198;A cool little bit of trivia for you .
I:422;1199;"Inside the magical world of the fairies
I:422;1200;"scenes with these mysterious mermaids
I:422;1201;Now bring on the adult version!
I:422;1202;The young actors who play Peter and Wendy put on an impressive performance.
I:422;1203;There are long trailers in the beginning, but it's worth it.
I:422;1204;My 2 and 4 year old love it.
I:422;1205;We watched this with our kids (ages 2 and 6).
I:422;1206;My 2 year old isn't much of a movie watcher yet but loved the crocodile and Tinkerbell.
I:422;1207;We liked the characters and the effects.
I:422;1208;This film is absolutly fabulous!
I:422;1209;"This is the definitive movie version of ""Peter Pan!"""
I:422;1210;this film stays true to J. m. Barrie's classic story and features outstanding special effects that create the most amazing Neverland you can possibly imagine.
I:422;1211;"Add to that a magnificent cast of the most adorable children on the planet along with Jason Isaacs (perhaps best known for his role as Lucius Malfoy in the ""Harry Potter"" movies) in a duel role as the delightfully evil Captain Hook and the slightly neurotic Mr. Darling, and you have one of the most fantastic fairytale productions ever made!"
I:422;1212;Peter Pan is full of fun and sorrow, adventures and tears.
I:422;1213;it's a story that will enchant both children and adults.
I:422;1214;I've seen the Disney version, of course, and we even did the play when I was in elementary school.
I:422;1215;This story is really about Wendy!
I:422;1216;This is a story about that shock time in a girl's life, when you are just becoming a woman.
I:422;1217;i also think this movie is good for the Peter Pans among us.
I:422;1218;This movie is, without a doubt, the best cinematic adaptation and closest rendition of J. M. Barrie's timeless, ageless fantasy tale about the boy who wouldn't grow up.
I:422;1219;It's simply perfect from beginning to end.
I:422;1220;It stays true to the book, but also incorporates a few fresh ideas, that take nothing away from the original story.
I:422;1221;Jeremy Sumpter is wonderful as the carefree, adventurous, cocky, yet innocent, Peter Pan, and Jason Issacs perfectly portrays the elegant, sophisticated, obsessive and downright bad Captain Hook.
I:422;1222;wood is excellent as Wendy, sharing with us her fears, desires and fantasies as she faces the choices that go hand in hand with growing up.
I:422;1223;The acting of the rest of the cast, especially the children's, is impressive, and the chemistry between them and the adults shines through on the screen.
I:422;1224;james Newton Howard's score is simply magical and seamlessly woven into the story and the film's stunning and splendid visuals.
I:422;1225;even the special features are great, as they are presented in well.
I:422;1226;organized, short, little capsules that make them enjoyable and easy to watch even for children.
I:422;1227;action adaptation of J. M. Barrie's classic, and is such an excellent one that it should remain so for a very long time.
I:422;1228;It masterfully combines adventure, romance, action and drama with fantastic characters, making it a must.
I:422;1229;see for both kids and adults.
I:422;1230;It was fun to watch and was a more realistic Peter Pan.
I:422;1231;The only time I enjoyed myself was when Jason Isaacs was on screen.
I:422;1232;He was the best thing about the movie.
I:422;1233;That's all I can say.
I:422;1234;This is his best movie yet .
I:422;1235;I have seen several versions of the Pan story (notably Disney's and Mary Martin's) and while this story are great special effects and fairly good directing, this movie lacked the fun of those other versions.
I:422;1236;"It was interesting to finally see a ""real"" boy play Pan and I guess the movie is a ""coming of age"" of sorts for him."
I:422;1237;This put the classic tale to more of a I am a teen and neverherad of peter pan version of the tales so that it captures their attention
I:422;1238;This is one of the best shows around these days.
I:422;1239;good family entertainment without all the sexy and bad language that is common thesedays.
I:422;1240;If you are a lover of Peter Pan, this is a wonderful live action adaptation of the cartoon classic.
I:422;1241;The characters are cast perfectly and it stays true to the story.
I:422;1242;It's a definite must have if you enjoyed the Disney classic cartoon!
I:422;1243;"As stated, everything about this movie is great
I:422;1244;A clue: watch it and see which actor is playing two parts.
I:422;1245;THERE!This is by far the best visual interpretation of the story I have yet seen.
I:422;1246;First off, Peter Pan is FINALLY being played by an actual boy!
I:422;1247;Thank you thank you THANK YOU, Mr. Hogan, for seeing this as well and not being afraid to tackle it.
I:422;1248;"(I agree, although the Disney version walked that fine line very delicately, what with the playing up of Peter's ""rock star"" appeal to basically every female he came across, including the mermaids and Tiger Lily."
I:422;1249;"It was an effective choice though, as we are able to fully understand Wendy's moral dilemma when she is faced with the decision of staying underground with the emotionally detatched Peter or to become a pirate alongside the fascinating Hook, whom she describes as ""a man of feelings."""
I:422;1250;Now, he actually has LAYERS!
I:422;1251;The whole hour and 45 minutes is just an absolute treasure.
I:422;1252;Superbly acted, wonderfully captured .
I:422;1253;"we sit rapt alongside our children, shouting ""I do believe in fairies!"""
I:422;1254;role Mr Darling/Hook is spot.
I:422;1255;on and engaging on both fronts.
I:422;1256;Thanks, Mr Hogan, for a beautiful film and excellent casting.
I:422;1257;My 5yr old daughter loves it.
I:422;1258;It really is a great movie.
I:422;1259;It shipped to us in two days and it was in perfect condition.
I:422;1260;Also at a great price!
I:422;1261;Peter pan has always been one f my favorite fairy tales.
I:422;1262;It was meant as a grand adventure.
I:422;1263;This is the best film adaptation of that intention!Not for the little kiddies mom.
I:422;1264;"It's a beautiful
I:422;1265;very visual vivid with excelent dialoge.
I:422;1266;Love this movie although it is more geared towards pre.
I:422;1267;Didnt hold my 3 year.
I:422;1268;olds attention very long but I loved it!
I:422;1269;I enjoyed this film way more than I thought possible for a nineteen.year.
I:422;1270;The visual effects are colorful and cartoony which really adds a magical dimension to the film.
I:422;1271;All the acting is cutesy at times, but for the most part very good.
I:422;1272;Jason Isaacs is great as Captain Hook and doesn't play him too over the top as Dustin Hoffman did in Hook.
I:422;1273;The guy who plays Smee was very funny as well (the scene with the old peg.
I:422;1274;leg bird screaming in his ear always makes me laugh).
I:422;1275;This is a great film for the whole family even though it is a bit dark at times, such as, the demonic mermaids and Hook shooting his fellow pirates constantly.
I:422;1276;The soundtrack was very well done as well, and adds the finishing touch of magical feel to this truly accurate adaptation of Peter Pan.
I:422;1277;It is well acted and directed, the sets are beautiful and its absolutely a charming telling of Peter Pan.
I:422;1278;This classic tale about a boy who never grows up whose name is Peter.
I:422;1279;My personal opinion of the movie was that it is fantastic!
I:422;1280;I was glued to the movie screen the whole time.
I:422;1281;The special affects were outstanding!
I:422;1282;The flying looked very realistic and it made it look like the characters were actually flying.
I:422;1283;I also liked how I didn't recognize the actors.
I:422;1284;I urge that you go to this movie and bring your whole family too.
I:422;1285;We all love this movie, from my husband to the grown kids to the grandkids!
I:422;1286;Watching the kids' faces as they watch the movie is worth any price paid for it.
I:422;1287;They love the Disney version, of course, as well as the old Mary Martin version .
I:422;1288;but this one is the movie that completely captures their attention.
I:422;1289;The older kids, (7.10) if they still watch these films, may love it!
I:422;1290;This movie is a great one for kids because it asks of you to use you imagination and enjoy being a kid
I:422;1291;This version is quite true to the original story!
I:422;1292;Full of a GREAT cast!
I:422;1293;It is so beautifully acted and the sets are amazing.
I:422;1294;My whole family loves this version.
I:422;1295;A great addition for the Peter Pan lover and a great movie for anyone.
I:422;1296;Exquisite scenes from perfectly realized Victorian townhouse to heart.
I:422;1297;"London is richly dark and will remind you of the Shirley Temple movie ""The Little Princess."""
I:422;1298;Then you will love the home of the lost boys.
I:422;1299;pretty children, bratty Tink, delightful Peter and a bittersweet story make a great movie.
I:422;1300;It is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen and I must have it!
I:422;1301;The piece with the repeating piano part .
I:422;1302;My daughter loves this movie!
I:422;1303;first of all, it's just so enjoyable to watch.
I:422;1304;The movie captures the essence of the book with out copying it word for word.
I:422;1305;This always frustrated me in the older versions of Peter Pan and I am very pleased to see it finally addressed in this version.
I:422;1306;this movie also brings up the psychological aspects of the book as well.
I:422;1307;also, this film was superbly acted.
I:422;1308;All of the children in this movie were absolutely adorable, and I rarely like child actors.
I:422;1309;Each and everyone of them captured their characters perfectly.
I:422;1310;Jason Isaacs played Mr. Darling and Capt. Hook and was superb!
I:422;1311;established, in my mind, what a great actor he is.
I:422;1312;i really love the story of Peter Pan and could not deny my inner child the pleasure of seeing this movie.
I:422;1313;But as I watched it, my adult self was pleasantly surprised by the maturity of this film.
I:422;1314;Oh well, this is life.
I:422;1315;It is, I believe, the first ever live action cinematic version of the proper story of Peter Pan ever to be released.
I:422;1316;That fact alone should make this movie worth seeing.
I:422;1317;secondly, it will feature the wonderful Jason Isaacs, who is superb at playing 'the bad guy' (as any who have seen The Patriot, or Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets would know).
I:422;1318;i recently saw a story on this movie on In Entertainment, and it looks as though we are going to be treated to a true version of Peter Pan, with all its glorious dark undertones.
I:422;1319;the scenery looked magnificent, from the famous island to the infamous pirate ship.
I:422;1320;This movie is definitely going to be something to look forward to.
I:422;1321;I've awarded five stars because we have to give some sort of star rating in order to write one of these things, but the five stars is because of the anticipation of a classic story told properly in all its glory for the first time.
I:422;1322;i expect this film to be outstanding, if only because of the presence of Jason Isaacs.
I:422;1323;No, he is not British, but I think he did a magnificent job anyways.
I:422;1324;That is what makes him so cute to watch.
I:422;1325;I think she did an amazing job.
I:422;1326;Also, I find the kiss to be very sweet.
I:422;1327;this movie is my favorite movie.
I:422;1328;The acting was magificent and touching.
I:422;1329;The film itself is beautiful.
I:422;1330;This subtext is present in the film.
I:422;1331;acted, the visual effects are spectacular, with Maxfield Parrish.
I:422;1332;style colors, and the soundtrack is at times sublimely beautiful, particularly during the grand reveal of Neverland.
I:422;1333;I highly recommend it for anyone who seriously enjoys the book, or wishes to see a Peter Pan that can be enjoyed by all ages.
I:422;1334;and Tiger Lily is played by Carsen Gray, a native Iroquois who speaks the Haida language, adding a delightfully authentic touch!
I:422;1335;The acting from the children is impressive, the story the most faithful to Barrie's original (EVER), and the characters cast the most faithful to Barrie's original (EVER).
I:422;1336;So with this formula, we get a wonderful story, acted beautifully.
I:422;1337;jeremy Sumpter's Peter Pan is just perfect, with a dreamy wide.
I:422;1338;eyed look, and the right mix of cockiness and innocence that Peter Pan was meant to exude.
I:422;1339;He was cocky and proud and smart.
I:422;1340;alecky, and a formidible swordsman and ace flyer, and, boy, he KNEW it.
I:422;1341;Never before have we seen portrayed the perfect Cpt Hook, and now, here we have him at last .
I:422;1342;looking, silky, sophisticated (he uses the most extensive vocab of all his pirates, and look at that waistcoat embroidery!)
I:422;1343;what Hogan has done is rightfully refocus this film onto Wendy.
I:422;1344;"It may be titled ""Peter Pan"" but it is Wendy's imagination we're exploring ."
I:422;1345;what we are given is a fabulous tale of a crossroads .
I:422;1346;we are right at that point in life where childhood cares are being grown out of, and adulthood looms frighteningly ahead.
I:422;1347;points to watch for that shows Hogan's genius in adaptation:.
I:422;1348;wendy and Peter's fairy dance.
I:422;1349;"the too long ""I do believe in fairies!"
I:422;1350;so, thank goodness for Victorians to give us such disturbing glimpses into sexual psychology!
I:422;1351;Awesome movie full of magic and wonder totally satisfied I would have liked the extra features like deleted scenes too but I believe the movoe is good enough to make up for it.
I:422;1352;The first movie that I saw of Peter Pan was the Disney Classic, the second one was the musical and the third one is Peter Pan(2003).
I:422;1353;In this movie you can find a more deep Peter Pan.
I:422;1354;In conclution I think thismovie is great and no matter how old you get you will always love Peter Pan.
I:422;1355;This is a very interesting fairy tale.
I:422;1356;The imagery through out the whole thing is simple superb.
I:422;1357;Jason Isaac's is great fun in his duel roles, but the children help carry the film just fine.
I:422;1358;the film is alot of fun, with great fairytale moments spanning from high humoured fun to melancholy poetic with just a dash of a dark underbelly in overall tone, giving a strangely wistful journey as it's heart.
I:422;1359;a fairytale film with a definite depth.
I:422;1360;Two of the great things featured in this version: That Peter Pan is played by an actual boy and that some of the lines in the movie was also featured in Robin William's Hook.
I:422;1361;I also think it was the best telling of the story because of how it's the closest to the actual book.
I:422;1362;my grand daughter loved this show.
I:422;1363;the picture's perfect and i enjoy watching it.
I:422;1364;This adaptation may well be the closest any film maker has ever gotten to capturing the alluring beauty of J. m. Barrie's original story.
I:422;1365;The film is absolutely fantastical and captivating.
I:422;1366;It all begins with a classic Peter Pan beginning, but with new technology and a director that stayed so true to the book it was absolutely worth every penny.
I:422;1367;The emotional bond that builds through several of the characters throughout the film is wonderful, enchanting and you feel like you may as well have been one of the lost boys yourself.
I:422;1368;this film was remarkably cast with Jason Isaacs as both Captain Hook and Mr. Darling.
I:422;1369;Peter splendid and Wendy is as wondrous as she was always meant to be.
I:422;1370;I highly recommend this movie for a family outing, the violence is rather mild and only meant in a humorous way rather then mindless.
I:422;1371;Omg, I love this movie soooo much!
I:422;1372;I think my favorite thing about this movie is the romance between Peter Pan and Wendy (I wish they ended up together) and the fact that they can go to Neverland and don't want to grow up.
I:422;1373;For the first time in my life, I got the message of the story.
I:422;1374;The kids did a spectacular job.
I:422;1375;Kids under school age got scared, but all other kids and adults should love all of it.
I:422;1376;This is a must see.
I:422;1377;My son and I enjoy this movie, over and over again compared to any other movies he owns.
I:422;1378;The vast majority of the reviews were positive ones, as the reviewers either liked the film themselves, or were convinced that it would be very entertaining viewing for children.
I:422;1379;Then along came Hogan's version, which fused the thematic emphasis of the original with the children's entertainment emphasis of the others.
I:422;1380;And perceptive adolescents struggling with their own growing up process should relate to it.
I:422;1381;And finally, those adults (particularly males) who have consciously resisted the growing up process their entire lives should connect to this film like few others.
I:422;1382;The answer is that this film uniquely focuses on the maturation process, which most girls embrace about sixth grade and most boys resist until 9th grade (and would resist even longer if girls were not luring them with the most obvious benefit of growing up).
I:422;1383;It is a live action version superior to the stage version if only because it is unburdened by the play's odd cross.
I:422;1384;The production design should blow away all viewers, child and adult, with a dreamy Maxfield Parrish Victorian look and Barrie's treasure.
I:422;1385;Wendy is second only to Wonderland's Alice as the bravest literary heroine of all time and Hogan nicely incorporates the many admirable qualities of her character into the story.
I:422;1386;nasty and this Tink is worthy of Barrie's original characterization.
I:422;1387;"The ""save Tink"" audience chant is nicely incorporated into a full."
I:422;1388;I thought this was a great and more recent (w/ all of our new technology) version of the original Peter Pan.
I:422;1389;I'm a big fan of the musical, the book, and everything about the boy who refused to grow up.
I:422;1390;"I'm also a big fan of ""Hook""."
I:422;1391;tikerbell came back to life from what the children were saying, not clappingThe acting was really good, and it still kept w/ Peter Pan tradition in having the same actor play Mr. Darling and Hook.
I:422;1392;Purachased for friends daughter who already saw the movie and loved it.
I:422;1393;The cinematography is absolutely beautiful in this production.
I:422;1394;The young man who plays Peter Pan is wonderfully perfect for that fuzzy line between childhood and emerging teenage.
I:422;1395;This is truly one of the best Peter Pan productions I've seen .
I:422;1396;What an absolutely charming movie!
I:422;1397;"accented Peter), are superb
I:422;1398;Also great effects, which are only to be expected.
I:422;1399;I would recommend this to anyone from a six.year.
I:422;1400;Intelligent, nicely subtextual and simply delightful
I:422;1401;The acting was good, the special effects were very good, but it just seemed like I've seen this a million times before and there really was no point in making this film.
I:422;1402;Much of the dialog seemed to be lifted right from the cartoon or the play.
I:422;1403;Personally, I liked the cartoon Disney version much better.
I:422;1404;There was more charm and personality in it.
I:422;1405;This movie was beautiful and stunning.
I:422;1406;Yes, he added an extra character and a bit of cheesiness with the puppy love factor.
I:422;1407;This is the most beautiful movie I have seen in years.
I:422;1408;And such a perfect kids movie.
I:422;1409;It really deserves all 5 stars.
I:422;1410;This movie is really something special.
I:422;1411;And they'll probably show it to thiers, as it manages to be absolutely timeless.
I:422;1412;This is one of the best films I have seen all year.
I:422;1413;first of all, the directing was the best I have seen all year.
I:422;1414;The special effects were outstanding.
I:422;1415;Every actor in the movie gives a strong performance, especially that of the three central roles: Peter Pan, Wendy, and Captain Hook.
I:422;1416;The screenplay is perfectly on track with the original story.
I:422;1417;This movie is a true FILM, not merely a kiddy flick.
I:422;1418;One of my favorite movies!!!
I:422;1419;This is a great movie for all ages!
I:422;1420;It has all the classic themes of the book and plays them to exactness.
I:422;1421;I bought this movie for four of my grandchildren.
I:422;1422;I had never seen this movie, but it's a wonderful production, so true to the original story and so beautifully realized.
I:422;1423;This film is a real gem.
I:422;1424;He is a cutie that grabs your heart with his mischievous smile.
I:422;1425;Jason Issacs does double duty as both Mr. Darling and Captain Hook and handles both roles perfectly.
I:422;1426;This film will appeal to all ages and everyone will take something special away from it.
I:422;1427;The youngest will love it for the timeless story and lovely special effects, while older viewers will be touched by the poignancy and ultimate loneliness of the boy who will not grow up.
I:422;1428;I highly recommend this movie.
I:422;1429;Every once in a while I look for a story that brings back a little bit of magic.
I:422;1430;this rendition of the Peter Pan story is well done, with all of the classic elements that make the original story so wonderful and beautiful costuming and details that set this apart from other retellings.
I:422;1431;peter Pan is just as I'd always pictured him: cocky, full of mischief, proud, and still sensitive.
I:422;1432;And most definitely incredibly cute in that heart.
I:422;1433;wendy Darling is a sweet and beautiful girl, innocent and on the brink of beginning to blossom.
I:422;1434;She's a bit of a tomboy, which I love about her, with a spunky personality and an incredible imagination.
I:422;1435;hook is spectacular as a villain, mesmerizing and frightening rather than ridiculous or over.
I:422;1436;and most definitely something that caught me while watching this movie was the ever so important first kiss.
I:422;1437;The movie was beautifully and well made.
I:422;1438;It was dramatic and poetic.
I:422;1439;This is a movie that is entertaining and romantic.
I:422;1440;Also, actual menace, thanks to Jason Isaacs' intelligent and dangerous portrayal of Captain Hook, who doesn't hesitate to murder his own men when annoyed by their stupidity or ineffectiveness, and of all of the various Hooks, Isaacs is the most capable to actually spit Peter Pan with his sword.
I:422;1441;Despite my thoughts on Pan, the movie was well done and is probably quite close in look and feel to the original story.
I:422;1442;ray, the sets and colors of the movie are spectacular and the disc does them justice.
I:422;1443;Unlike past renditions of this classic story, this is truly Wendy Darling's story, as it should be.
I:422;1444;Wendy is on the cusp of growing up, and this is the story of her struggles between childhood and womanhood with the temptations of both sides.
I:422;1445;wood fits the role perfectly and do hope to see more of her on the screen in the future.
I:422;1446;The Lost Boys and Peter Pan are well cast, and bring delightful performances to this film that both children and adults will enjoy.
I:422;1447;by far, the best of this film is Jason Isaacs cast as both Mr. Darling and Captain James Hook.
I:422;1448;Isaacs is among the best of the true character actors in this age of all too many star actors who merely play themselves inserted into a role.
I:422;1449;A man of feeling he truly is, even if those feelings are rather on the dark side.
I:422;1450;This is a favourite film at my home already with my three year old and five year old, and is sure to be a favourite for any home with children.
I:422;1451;This was the very best version I have seen of Peter Pan yet!
I:422;1452;Hook was an appropriate swarmy kind of guy with snake.
I:422;1453;Great movie for the whole family!
I:422;1454;I have loved the story of Peter Pan all ny life.
I:422;1455;This was the coolest and most awsomest movie ever made!
I:422;1456;What can I say, my sons loves the film.
I:422;1457;It was beautiful, well written, well cast, and fun.
I:422;1458;I found that shocking .
I:422;1459;Rant done, now back to overall, it's a wonderful film.
I:422;1460;She loves Peter Pan and the boy who plays him.
I:422;1461;It kept me at the edge of my seat each moment.
I:422;1462;This is my favorite movie ever!
I:422;1463;And, mind, this is coming from a 20 year old.
I:422;1464;^_~The film was excellent, and followed the book better than any of the previous adaptations did (a great majority of quotes can be found, word for word, in the book).
I:422;1465;Also, unlike previous adaptations, it was actually deep.
I:422;1466;I also liked how the relationship between Peter and Wendy was developed and brought to light, and I liked how the ending was not all happiness and fluff.
I:422;1467;it was bittersweet, and true to life in that way.
I:422;1468;the acting itself was great!
I:422;1469;egotistical, cocky, confident, and yet endearing (and yes, people, he does sometimes have a lisp.
I:422;1470;and Jason Isaacs played the perfect Hook!
I:422;1471;Menacing, intimidating, yet somehow charming, in a very twisted Hook fashion.
I:422;1472;The Lost Boys were also great, and all the other actors and actresses did wonderful jobs!As for the special effects.
I:422;1473;The flying scenes were really well pulled off, and the sword.
I:422;1474;Neverland itself was just as I imagined, beautiful, ethereal and sometimes eerie.
I:422;1475;all in all, Peter Pan is an excellent and imaginative adaptation of a classic novel and play, and it is one I can easily watch over and over again, and I, personally, don't view it as a child's film, though I can understand how people can easily assume it is.
I:422;1476;This film captures all of the magic, wonder and adventure that all other versions have lacked in one way or the other.
I:422;1477;"And if, after seeing this, someone accuses you of having a Peter Pan complex you can look them right in the face and say ""Thank you!"
I:422;1478;Everyone has their own preference.
I:422;1479;This is one super movie, and can be enjoyed by the whole family.
I:422;1480;wood) were terrific, and displayed a chemistry that is unusual for such youthful actors.
I:422;1481;And Jason Issacs was both fun to watch and just intimidating enough as Hook to rise above the previous incarnations of the character.
I:422;1482;It is a true classic.
I:422;1483;This is a great movie for the family.
I:422;1484;i think every kid should see this great story book tale.
I:422;1485;Jeremy Sumpter (Peter Pan) looked handsome and mischieveous, the perfect Peter.
I:422;1486;wood (Wendy) looked strikingly beautiful yet innocent.
I:422;1487;But that's just how it LOOKED.
I:422;1488;Sumpter seemed good for the role, but when it came to acting.
I:422;1489;wood was wonderful, charming and innocent as a girl with her first crush.
I:422;1490;"He was the best thing in ""Peter Pan."""
I:422;1491;As Hook, he was witty and intelligent.
I:422;1492;We looked everywhere until finally I said, let's check Amazon!We found it!If you like the story of Peter Pan, you will love this movie!The characters in it are played with excellence.
I:422;1493;it's the type of movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:422;1494;my daughter watched it 8 times the first week we got it!Great movie!
I:422;1495;This is the beloved children's story that I think has never truly been done justice until now.
I:422;1496;The movie is perfectly cast, perfectly acted, and the soundtrack is the most magical music you've ever heard.
I:422;1497;Every scene will draw you more into this lovely story.
I:422;1498;With a slight twist on the friendship between Peter and Wendy, and amazing special effects, this story comes to life in a way that only the magic of film.
I:422;1499;"Families and couples everywhere can appreciate the magic spell cast by ""Peter Pan."""
I:422;1500;I am very impressed at the speed and pricing of this product.
I:422;1501;The movie is a good one.
I:422;1502;A timeless classic and the fact that it isn't entirely animated helps keep adults attention.
I:422;1503;When I was growing up I enjoyed the classic story of Peter Pan .
I:422;1504;action adaptations, on stage and on screen, traditionally err by casting a young woman in the title role.
I:422;1505;this version gets it exactly right, by discarding all of those traditions.
I:422;1506;Similarly, the movie does well by casting people who aren't Big Names, with the one exception of Lynn Redgrave in a minor role.
I:422;1507;You can finally lose yourself in the movie, as every actor fits their role perfectly and the effects only serve to support the vision of what Neverland should have always been.
I:422;1508;in short, this is a magnificent adaptation of the classic story.
I:422;1509;"Just as ""Hook"" did a remarkable job of imagining Peter Pan as a grownup, this movie gives the original story that same degree of reality that the other versions have so sorely lacked."
I:422;1510;As fine as this movie looks, it has left the main magical characters appearing no better than your average homeless mortal.
I:422;1511;Not so magical but for the grace of special effects.
I:422;1512;"The latest film version of ""Peter Pan"" is a very fine rendition of the J. M. Barrie classic ."
I:422;1513;which celebrates its centenary this year .
I:422;1514;In this particular adaptation, it is the marvelous attention to detail .
I:422;1515;that makes the movie soar.
I:422;1516;Indeed, from first moment to last, the film is a visual feast, a masterpiece of image, design, and sheer technical wizardry.
I:422;1517;The relationship between Peter and Wendy achieves a surprising emotional depth thanks to the two fine young actors, Jeremy Sumpter and Rachel Hurd.
I:422;1518;wood, whose job it is to bring these beloved characters to life.
I:422;1519;"There's a particularly enchanting scene in which Peter and Wendy dance in the air, spinning high above the trees against an impossibly huge painted moon (shades of ""E. t.,"" the ultimate ""Peter Pan"" tribute)."
I:422;1520;being a member of a family, maturing into manhood, falling in love.
I:422;1521;As a result of confronting this paradox, the film possesses a bittersweet flavor that helps to dilute some of the treacle and sugary sentiment that could otherwise have taken over the story.
I:422;1522;This film is a genuine treat .
I:422;1523;My four year old wanted it for Christmas and still loves it.
I:422;1524;It is fun to watch and visually pleasing.
I:422;1525;They kept cutting to her mugging for comic relief .
I:422;1526;Wend y was very good too.
I:422;1527;One thing that I found interesting about this film, is that there were no major stars, and it was kinda nice.
I:422;1528;All in all, a great child film, and great for adults and teens too.
I:422;1529;Holy cow that was a great movie!
I:422;1530;The movie explained everything so well, and was actually better than the book.
I:422;1531;cool, and the only fault the movie had was Tink's jerky moves.
I:422;1532;It was super great and is totally underrated for the classic that it truly is!
I:422;1533;It was fantastic even though the releasal year was 2003, I have wanted to see it but never got the chance.
I:422;1534;And I just had to rub it in her face saying that I knew it was a good movie.
I:422;1535;this movie is a wonderful movie for any age.
I:422;1536;"it has any emotion a human can feel
I:422;1537;You have to love the movie of course!
I:422;1538;This film is so much better than most of the stuff that's out there.
I:422;1539;It is by far better than Hook.
I:422;1540;But P. j. Hogan's version of this classic story kept me wide awake.
I:422;1541;What a beautiful work of emotional and external art!
I:422;1542;I have always been a Peter Pan fan, but had yet to see a motion picture that quite did the book justice.
I:422;1543;and I have finally found one!The movie is faithful to the book without being slavish though.
I:422;1544;P. j. Hogan adds an interestingly *older* appeal while still retaining all the beauty, wonder, and young innocence of Peter and Neverland.
I:422;1545;wood is surprisingly convincing as Wendy, and Jason Isaacs a strangely seductive Captain Hook.
I:422;1546;I also love the new take on the mermaids, and the sheer realness of the Lost Boys.
I:422;1547;The effects are almost liquid, they fit so well.
I:422;1548;i`m quite impressed with the flying scenes most of all.
I:422;1549;this is undoubtedly the best Pan adaptation to date, stunning in story and setting (filmed in Australia).
I:422;1550;James Newton Howard blends a perfect meeting of old and young feelings into the score.
I:422;1551;It was the feeling of security and fun that trickles away with the years, and Peter Pan has always aided me on helping me regain that sense of wonder for everything around me.
I:422;1552;^^The `I do believe in fairies` scene was absolutely magical.
I:422;1553;i loved the chemistry between Peter and Wendy.
I:422;1554;a truely timeless story evolved into a truly timeless picture.
I:422;1555;I can`t wait to see it again.
I:422;1556;This is my favorite version of Peter Pan.
I:422;1557;I prefer live actors to cartoons.
I:422;1558;My great grandchildren have the Disney movie, which I also enjoyed, but I bought them each this version as well.
I:422;1559;"The truest to the original stories and the best in regards to who portrays the ""boy who would not grow up."""
I:422;1560;A wonderful, wonderful adaptation start to finish!
I:422;1561;My 4 year old son loves pirates and we already owned the Walt Disney movie but he really prefers this movie version.
I:422;1562;It has real kids and makes it more real to him.
I:422;1563;I also enjoyed the movie.
I:422;1564;Rarely has an adaptation from a classic childhood story been so seamless, visually stunning, and truly entertaining.
I:422;1565;action cast, the advances of modern filmmaking, and an overall look that is remarkably refreshing to a much wider age range of watchers.
I:422;1566;eyed, and intelligent London girl who delights in telling captivating stories and sword fighting with her two younger brothers John and Michael (Harry Newell and Freddie Popplewell, respectively).
I:422;1567;From adventures with the pirates of the Jolly Roger, commanded by evil Captain Hook, to Indians and fairies, the delightful story comes to life once again on a grand scale.
I:422;1568;in the terms of performances, most of the young cast are first.
I:422;1569;wood sparkles, and has an innocense and hidden strength of a heroine around her.
I:422;1570;"As for Peter Pan, (this version is the first to use a boy in the role) the search for the right person spanned nearly three continents, and ended with the find of Jeremy Sumpter (known for his part in the thriller ""Frailty""), who is without a doubt, perfect for the role."
I:422;1571;With his perfectly tousled hair and devilish good looks, he has a spark of confidence, charm, and a cocky little smile, (and still manages to convey his wish for a mother) that completely captures the character of Peter Pan.
I:422;1572;one of the things that truly stands out in this Peter Pan is the visual effects and the sets.
I:422;1573;The Darling household and London itself are beautifully done, and Neverland is beyond words.
I:422;1574;"sprinkled with humor, and with a crackling script, a brilliant director, and extremely wise choices in casting, sets and costuming, and visual effects, ""Peter Pan"" is one of the best movies of the year and will continue to delight audiences for years to come."
I:422;1575;Several versions of Peter Pan's adventures swim the cinematic sea, but this one has to be the best.
I:422;1576;With a plot that's total fantasy, this film takes you into Neverland and makes you a believer in everything you see.
I:422;1577;Acting, directing, editing, writing and special effects are superb.
I:422;1578;I was really impressed with this movie.
I:422;1579;I think the acting was fantastic.
I:422;1580;I really loved the lost boys, because they were so well played.
I:422;1581;I thought Tinkerbell was wonderful!
I:422;1582;She had great facial expressions !
I:422;1583;Neverland was really beautiful and happy until Peter and Wendy got mad at each other.
I:422;1584;Peter (Jeremy Sumter) and Wendy seem to work together really well.
I:422;1585;It's nice seeing them attracted to each other so much.
I:422;1586;Gee, I cried like a baby!At age 19, it was SO good to remember old Peter Pan.
I:422;1587;The Fairy dance escene es absolutly marvelous!!
I:422;1588;I was looking forward to seeing this film, as I love the story of Peter Pan, but this version just didn't work for me.
I:422;1589;cinematography on this film is excellent however.
I:422;1590;The film makes an excellent audio and video transfer to disc.
I:422;1591;This is one of the most phenomenal visual representations I've seen of a movie on home video and the colors really stand out, especially during the flight to Neverland.
I:422;1592;overall, I wouldn't say this is a bad movie, and most likely it will be enjoyed by a younger audience.
I:422;1593;This is a film adaptation that remains true to Barrie's story, which is only one of the great children's stories of all time.
I:422;1594;His glorious wife Mary appreciates his sacrifices, but his three children, Wendy, John, and Michael, do not.
I:422;1595;For they are in that great pre.
I:422;1596;And so it is with a grateful smile and a flirtatious gleam that she greets Peter Pan, who flies into their room one night.
I:422;1597;Hogan and his team are faithful to the book in that Pan's perpetual adolescence is charming, but it is also just a bit sad.
I:422;1598;This is complex stuff, but Barrie's story and Hogan's adaptation deal with it effortlessly.
I:422;1599;"astounding visual effects remind us that, as good as Pixar and other animators are these days, live action films still have an ""A"" game when it comes to visual thrills."
I:422;1600;The crocodile that hungers after Hook is frightening, and Neverland has never looked so good.
I:422;1601;Isaacs is also perfectly sinister as Hook, and Jeremy Sumpter does an excellent job as Peter.
I:422;1602;all in all, this movie goes on the top shelf of superb family films.
I:422;1603;old niece will love it!
I:422;1604;Actually she requested it pretty much as she stated that she wanted a Peter Pan movie with people and not animated.
I:422;1605;The Blue Ray is great.
I:422;1606;I was actually very impressed.
I:422;1607;if you want a realistic story version with good acting, then watch this movie.
I:422;1608;This version of Peter Pan has good acting and visual effects are cool too.
I:422;1609;Good for anyone with kids.
I:422;1610;The kids will love it.
I:422;1611;My family stumbled onto this film by accident and it has quickly become one of our favorites!
I:422;1612;But what struck us the most was the sheer beauty of the film.
I:422;1613;From the beginning it has very rich colors, wonderful narrative, gorgeous actors and a wonderful storyline.
I:422;1614;filled with beautiful fairies, villianous pirates, curious children, colorful Indians, dangerous mermaids and a raggedy bunch of lost boys.
I:422;1615;Both of my daughters enjoyed the film immensely and were not frightened or upset by any scenes.
I:422;1616;My husband and I even found ourselves discovering new insights from the film.
I:422;1617;We went out and bought the movie right away and it is a favorite to watch on trips because it has so much action.
I:422;1618;This is a great family film!
I:422;1619;My 5 year old daughter loves this version better than the animated one.
I:422;1620;My 7 year old son still loves Disney's version.
I:422;1621;I have always loved Peter Pan.
I:422;1622;The Mary Martin version was my favorite, until this one came out.
I:422;1623;Of course, I bought it for my two grandchildren who are 5 and 8 LOL!
I:422;1624;I thought they did a outstanding job an this!
I:422;1625;I think this is the best ever version of Peter Pan.
I:422;1626;All the characters came alive and the special effects were outstanding.
I:422;1627;Beautiful movie for all family to enjoy.
I:422;1628;He has seen the movie before and loves it .
I:422;1629;Jeremy Sumpter is a great pick for the part of Peter Pan.
I:422;1630;He is adorable, funny and mischievous and just exactly what Pan should be.
I:422;1631;This movie is very good, if i had it right now i would watch it over and over and over again.
I:422;1632;It is a very good movie for litlle ones and even older people.
I:422;1633;Not to mention, its great!
I:422;1634;The special effects are awesome and It's a great movie to watch with any one!
I:422;1635;It is literally the best PG movie I've ever seen.
I:422;1636;Of course the cartoons always change the story and the musicals have to make a place for the songs to fit and have to cut something out.
I:422;1637;I enjoyed the two main characters and their interaction, and enjoyed the actor playing the father and the Captain.
I:422;1638;This could be a little intense for the young children, but the rest of the family will enjoy it.
I:422;1639;Our Grandson loves this movie especially since anything Peter Pan is okay with him!
I:422;1640;A great bonus is the two other featured movies which he really likes also.
I:422;1641;This is one of the best fantasy films ever made.
I:422;1642;Visually it reminded me a bit of old Tim Burton films like Bettlegeuse, Edward Scissorhands.
I:422;1643;My little boy and I enjoyed this very much!
I:422;1644;The kids were great, the props, the adults, all of it.
I:422;1645;I loved this movie from the very first time I saw it.
I:422;1646;It really is the best version of Peter Pan that I've seen yet and I'm a really big Peter Pan fan.
I:422;1647;This story has been one of my favorite stories for as long as I can remember and every movie has been a little disappointing.
I:422;1648;This version is very true to the book which I think is important.
I:422;1649;If you are a fan of the book you will love this movie.
I:422;1650;the soundtrack is also wonderful if you wanted to know.
I:422;1651;As soon as you see the movie you'll be humming the tunes until you realize you can't go another day without owning the soundtrack.
I:422;1652;girls, let me tell you, Jeremy Sumpter is really cute.
I:422;1653;That was another thing about this movie that was done really well, the love story between Peter and Wendy.
I:422;1654;I think that the cast is wonderful.
I:422;1655;He has the eyes, voice, and smile of Peter Pan.
I:422;1656;so, I would absolutely recommend this movie to anyone, and even more so if you are a Peter Pan fan.
I:422;1657;It is a great movie with a wonderful cast and beautiful music.
I:422;1658;Watch it, and I bet you will fall in love with it in an instant.
I:422;1659;just like me!Oh the cleverness of me!
I:422;1660;Love this movie great alternative to the cartoon version.
I:422;1661;Puts a whole new twist on the level adorable Tinkerbell good movie.
I:422;1662;I loved this movie so much.
I:422;1663;i'm sure he's a better actor than you!)
I:422;1664;and though he does have a funny grin, he has the exact look for the childish peter pan.
I:422;1665;I loved the extra bit of romance between the two.
I:422;1666;A nice retelling of the Disney animation, this one in live action.
I:422;1667;This is a wonderful version of Barrie's classic, and the casting above all, is exceptional.
I:422;1668;wood is a perfect choice to play Wendy, and the whole process of her transition to womanhood is handled very tastefully and intelligently.
I:422;1669;"after the (to me) disappointing ""Hook"" I was very wary of another attempt at Peter Pan, but this one is virtually flawless, and the special effects are beautifully integrated."
I:422;1670;I was surprised that the 'mermaids' scene was so brief, as it was very dramatic and well.
I:422;1671;isaacs is just outstanding, as is Sumpter, and it is difficult to conceive of a better cast than this one.
I:422;1672;There is plenty of whimsy at play here, but there's also a bit of darkness that rubs the film's edges.
I:422;1673;This film does a remarkable job of taking all of those elements and making them thematically relevant without ever bludgeoning you over the head with it.
I:422;1674;Combine that with some excellent performances across the board and you have a near.
I:422;1675;It is absolutely fantastic and works at every level.
I:422;1676;Superb casting, storyline, effects, et al.
I:422;1677;"A million times better than Spielberg's ""Hook."""
I:422;1678;And she asked for this one by name, and the REAL one!
I:422;1679;This is a wonderful reimagining of the Disney classic in live action.
I:422;1680;the movie arrived when promised and it was as presented in the add, there is one happy little girl !
I:422;1681;As this was a gift .
I:422;1682;One of the best Peter Pan's I have seen.
I:422;1683;I will be showing this story to my grandchildren this summer and enjoying it again myself.
I:422;1684;In my second viewing, I saw levels of meaning in the story and nuances to the performances that I hadn't realized were there.
I:422;1685;PJ Hogan's direction is masterful.
I:422;1686;He captures the magic of Neverland and the sadness of Peter's final decision in a way that has not been done before.
I:422;1687;the visual effects and cinematography (especially the use of color) are mesmerizing.
I:422;1688;The acting by both the kids and adults is terrific.
I:422;1689;The British kids (Wendy, John, Michael(stand.
I:422;1690;pJ Hogan's Peter Pan is a classic in the making.
I:422;1691;Young or old, this film is guaranteed to leave you with a great, big smile.
I:422;1692;one piece of advice: watch this one time with SUBTITLES on.
I:422;1693;A lot of the funniest lines are really quick, heavily accented or are in the background.
I:422;1694;Seeing it all will double your enjoyment.
I:422;1695;When watching a movie version of a favorite classic, one's expection is high.
I:422;1696;I expected this film to be good, but found it to be much more exciting.
I:422;1697;I guess they found it motivating as well!
I:422;1698;How can i ever describe how wonderful it is just by words alone.
I:422;1699;It evokes so many emotions that leave you feeling intensely enchanted.
I:422;1700;i read the book after watching the movie and it was as absorbing as the movie itself.
I:422;1701;It is simply such a beautiful story.
I:422;1702;the movie is a masterpiece of imagination that incorporates all the essential elements of the story and captures the magic of peter pan effectively.
I:422;1703;like but still manages to retain and successfully convey those same ideas and emotions that the original story has.
I:422;1704;That is the most fantastic combination,i reckon.
I:422;1705;wood staring as their roles as Peter Pan and Wendy Darling, they deliver the greatest performances that the movie industry has ever seen.
I:422;1706;They bring the two greatest characters to life and don't fail to leave us wanting more!Jason Issacs makes a great Hook and Mr. Darling.
I:422;1707;He does a great job capturing the attention of both characters!
I:422;1708;It will leave you wondering how he does it!This is so highly recommendable, that it will leave you wanting a sequel to this amazing movie!
I:422;1709;I'm am an adult and I love this version of Peter Pan.
I:422;1710;First off, the film was visually stunning, from the costumes, to the sets, to the cast, to the special effects, this film is pure eye candy!
I:422;1711;"From Bedroom eyes, to a ""little kiss"" that seemed more romantintic than innocent, to just the way Peter and Wendy interacted with each other, going beyond innocent puppy love."
I:422;1712;But the relationship in Peter Pan between Peter and Wendy is an innocent one, and from people I know who've seen it, the relationship seems to jump ahead too fast, and at times even gives the sense of sexual frustration in Peter.
I:422;1713;First of all, the outrageously high usage of special effect and GGI take away the magic of J. m. Barrie's classic tale of the boy who won't grow up.
I:422;1714;Peter Pan is undoubtedly one of the greatest stories of all.
I:422;1715;The heart of the story should rely on the characters, their relationships and their development.
I:422;1716;Unfortunetly, the filmmakers thought the heart should be special effects, which completely ruins the great story.
I:422;1717;overall, the acting is fine.
I:422;1718;All of the acting is done superbly, with two major standouts, one of which is good, the other which is bad.
I:422;1719;First, Jason is a marvel as Mr. Darling and Captain Hook.
I:422;1720;He plays the role originally and very well.
I:422;1721;A standout performance from a very fine veteran actor.
I:422;1722;"Sumpters did a very fine acting job in the very dark ""Frailty"", playing the son of Bill Paxton's character."
I:422;1723;I came expecting another great performance.
I:422;1724;I guarantee your children will enjoy it more.
I:422;1725;Rarely has an adaptation from a classic childhood story been so seamless, visually stunning, and truly entertaining.
I:422;1726;action cast, the advances of modern filmmaking, and an overall look that is remarkably refreshing to a much wider age range of watchers.
I:422;1727;eyed, and intelligent London girl who delights in telling captivating stories and sword fighting with her two younger brothers John and Michael (Harry Newell and Freddie Popplewell, respectively).
I:422;1728;From adventures with the pirates of the Jolly Roger, commanded by evil Captain Hook, to Indians and fairies, the delightful story comes to life once again on a grand scale.
I:422;1729;in the terms of performances, most of the young cast are first.
I:422;1730;wood sparkles, and has an innocense and hidden strength of a heroine around her.
I:422;1731;"As for Peter Pan, (this version is the first to use a boy in the role) the search for the right person spanned nearly three continents, and ended with the find of Jeremy Sumpter (known for his part in the thriller ""Frailty""), who is without a doubt, perfect for the role."
I:422;1732;With his perfectly tousled hair and devilish good looks, he has a spark of confidence, charm, and a cocky little smile, (and still manages to convey his wish for a mother) that completely captures the character of Peter Pan.
I:422;1733;one of the things that truly stands out in this Peter Pan is the visual effects and the sets.
I:422;1734;The Darling household and London itself are beautifully done, and Neverland is beyond words.
I:422;1735;"sprinkled with humor, and with a crackling script, a brilliant director, and extremely wise choices in casting, sets and costuming, and visual effects, ""Peter Pan"" is one of the best movies of the year and will continue to delight audiences for years to come."
I:422;1736;interesting having the same actor play the treacherous villain and the loving father.
I:422;1737;To act dangling from harnesses and wires and engage in convincing sword play was quite and achievement.
I:422;1738;nice to be reminded that there is a crocodile with a clock inside it ticking off the time until we are swallowed up :.)
I:422;1739;For children, they might enjoy this movie.
I:422;1740;The littler audience 2.6 probably wouldnt enjoy this film.
I:422;1741;There wasnt enough interesting moments in the movie.
I:422;1742;This film does have some enjoyable comedy.
I:422;1743;But if you really enjoy the peter pan story you may very well love this move as my wife did.
I:422;1744;This is the best version of this classic that I have ever seen.
I:422;1745;the casting and directing are flawless.
I:422;1746;She loves it, and the price was amazing.
I:422;1747;both films are excellent,UK and the US version.
I:422;1748;"This newest ""Peter Pan,"" faithful to the original play/book, succeeds in being a very amusing adventure tale throughout."
I:422;1749;That, you can be assured.
I:422;1750;Wendy meets Peter Pan (who is played by a male actor for the first time n English.
I:422;1751;Don't worry, they are so natural and engaging that you come to believe that the casting is not wrong.
I:422;1752;Though they are treated in the slightly comic light, the truth is, they, especially the captain, are a bunch of cruel guys who really enjoy watching people walk on the board and dive into the sea, and the sword.
I:422;1753;fight scenes remind you of the fact.
I:422;1754;tinker Bell (lovely French Lodivine Sagner, regular of Francis Ozon) and other characters appear as they should, with superb acting.
I:422;1755;The fine CGIs work to help their characters, helped by the power of imagination who use them even though some would prefer, understandably, Peter Pan flying with wire attached to his body.
I:422;1756;"the greatest thing about this ""Peter Pan"" is, however, that it does not forget the flip side of being forever young."
I:422;1757;"At the end of the film, director P. J. Hogan (""Best Friends' Wedding"") gives us a touching moment ."
I:422;1758;touching because it shows sadness of being Peter Pan.
I:422;1759;"It's sweet all the same, but after all ""Peter Pan"" is about something we lost on the way to the adulthood."
I:422;1760;"imagine the lush and lavish images of ""Moulin Rouge"" or Leo's ""Romeo and Juliet,"" and you get a picture of uniquely beautiful ""Peter Pan."""
I:422;1761;Ans under its beautiful pictures, this film has a heart.
I:422;1762;This movie has the most amazing look to it.
I:422;1763;Neverland is full of lush, dense color, and peopled by all sorts of fantastical creatures, from the ever popular Tinkerbell to the beautiful, but feral mermaids.
I:422;1764;The story stays pretty true to Barrie's original, with the emphasis on Wendy and a girl's sometimes frightening journey into womanhood.
I:422;1765;And because of that emphasis, the tradition of having the same actor play Mr. Darling and Captain Hook has more resonance than ever.
I:422;1766;His Captain Hook, on the other hand, encapsulates everything about adult males that gives Wendy pause as she contemplates growing up.
I:422;1767;But he's also attractive (Hook has amazing costumes and wigs, which provide a frame for Jason's wonderfully expressive eyes) and seductive and worldly, which gives him an appeal, even as he frightens her so badly.
I:422;1768;it's really a great performance, because, through it, you can see that Hook is a mirror.
I:422;1769;Both are attracted to Wendy, because she exudes her own kind of power.
I:422;1770;the power to make a young man yearn to be better and an older man yearn to be young.
I:422;1771;all the performances in the movie range between very good and excellent.
I:422;1772;wood is particularly charming and winsome as Wendy, and the Lost Boys are cute and funny.
I:422;1773;Ludivine Sagnier is a very pretty, but also a very arch and malevolent Tinkerbell.
I:422;1774;He has a great look for the role and the youthful exuberance to make a convincing Pan, but his line delivery sometimes slips from cocky into smarmy, and it makes him a slightly less attractive figure.
I:422;1775;still, there is so much good about this movie.
I:422;1776;jason, Rachel, the magnificent setpieces, and the attention to even the smallest detail, not to mention the classic story.
I:422;1777;I thought this was a cute movie.
I:422;1778;My 9 year old enjoyed the movie.
I:422;1779;1 I love this movie!!!!!!!!
I:422;1780;It has all the classic with new!!!!!!!!
I:422;1781;I loved the disney version and i love the new version!!!!
I:422;1782;Jeremy Sumpter was an excellent pick for Peter Pan.
I:422;1783;I recommend everybody to see the movie.
I:422;1784;"I first saw it with my best friend and after the first five minutes I turn to her and say quot
I:422;1785;He took the part and made it his own!
I:422;1786;I thought that was clever.
I:422;1787;Racheal also did well as Wendy.
I:422;1788;Peter Pan is such a great movie on so many levels that I don't even know where to begin!
I:422;1789;This film is no doubt director P. j. Hogan's crowning masterpiece.
I:422;1790;after years of being portrayed variously by grown women, cartoon characters, and an aging Robin Williams, Peter Pan finally reclaims his youthful boyishness in this first, and perhaps most faithful rendition of the classic story.
I:422;1791;The casting is superb from top to bottom.
I:422;1792;Jeremy Sumpter is fitting and delightful as the title role.
I:422;1793;who completely steals the show, and stole my heart!
I:422;1794;Possibly the most gorgeous thing ever to walk the earth with her impossibly adorable eyes, the precocious Hurd.
I:422;1795;wood combines her physical beauty with incredible depth in her acting.
I:422;1796;Her chemistry with fellow young actor Jeremy crackles with unusual intensity for ones so young.
I:422;1797;this version of the Peter Pan story includes a sweet, adorable romance between Wendy and Peter that is the real centrepiece of the film.
I:422;1798;air dance between Wendy and Peter is one of the sweetest and most romantic scenes in recent cinematic history.
I:422;1799;And the final thimble !
I:422;1800;:) Let's just say, the true power of love is unleashed to save the day.
I:422;1801;Isaac gives probably the finest portrayal of Hook ever, AT LEAST on par with (if not surpassing) Dustin Hoffman's also fine performance.
I:422;1802;The film is much too nuanced, layered, and complex to be fully enjoyed by children.
I:422;1803;be girlfriend's love, nor can he live a full life.
I:422;1804;This complexity to Peter's character is fully exploited by the writers (and Hook) in the final battle between Hook and Peter.
I:422;1805;"Even though Peter technically wins (through the triumph of love 
I:422;1806;, in a brilliant twist), we see that in the end, both Peter and Hook are essentially tragic characters, trapped in a similar curse.
I:422;1807;One can interpet this entire adventure as Wendy's own imagination.
I:422;1808;"the special effects of the film must also be given a mention
I:422;1809;Hogan has a distinctive style that beautifully gives live.
I:422;1810;Our familiar flippered friends are given a sinister, otherworldly look.
I:422;1811;Tinkerbell is also very well done, played by the delightfully expressive French actress Ludivine Sagnier.
I:422;1812;alas, this is still technically a children's movie, and everyone ends smiling (except Hook, of course).
I:422;1813;Children will indeed enjoy this movie, but in the words of Dr. Frink from the Simpsons , You won't enjoy it on NEARLY as many levels as I will!
I:422;1814;Peter Pan is a multilayered and complex treat of social psychology and anthropology.
I:422;1815;It is a very mature and philosophically rich movie.
I:422;1816;It can be enjoyed as a fantasy, a coming.
I:422;1817;age story, a very sweet romance, and/or an unapologetic and fearless analysis of Peter Pan's hidden, background themes.
I:422;1818;I may still dislike Tinkerbell but in this film version of the story, I began to understand why she is important and, in the end, she is a genuinely a likable character.
I:422;1819;But now this terrific film has made me change my mind.
I:422;1820;wood are all excellent at portraying the various dimensions of their characters, allowing the audience to truly understand their state of minds and why they are the way they are.
I:422;1821;overall, it is truly enjoyable and I can't wait to one day share this film with my children.
I:422;1822;Fantastic acting, beautifully orchestrated music, magical special effects make Peter Pan a movie that takes you to Neverland and back home again a truly grand and magical adventure.
I:422;1823;For younger children you may wish to stick with the Disney version, but for older children, teens and adults, this is Peter Pan at its finest.
I:422;1824;"It's an excellent romp and far more ""believable"" in its characters and presentation."
I:422;1825;I thought it was really neat.
I:422;1826;I loved the music, and most of all, I loved the fairy dance.
I:422;1827;the movie is so beyond cute, Jeremy Sumpter is an awesome actor, I'm now twice the fan I was before I saw this movie of his.
I:422;1828;"She's got a gorgeous smile and I think that she'll make it big as an ""English Rose."
I:422;1829;I ended up seeing this movie 5 times!
I:422;1830;Jason Isaacs plays a scary (and good!)
I:422;1831;An outstanding iteration of the beloved tale by Sir J. m. Barrie.
I:422;1832;The story, acting, visuals and music are wonderful.
I:422;1833;action, adventure, and humor .
I:422;1834;a movie the entire family can enjoy together.
I:422;1835;It was entertaining for all ages.
I:422;1836;They were very good, although they looked like something a kid would imagine (and that was the point).
I:422;1837;This is a beautiful film, made with great love for its subject, and the slight alterations to the script are minimal and not at all out of accord with J. m. Barrie's intent.
I:422;1838;"She is the real center of the story
I:422;1839;"centered and often cruel
I:422;1840;the film is just wonderful, a great script, BEAUTIFUL performances from all the children and adults, spectacular special effects and a great night out.
I:422;1841;Ultimately, PJ Hogan's Peter Pan is a success.
I:422;1842;"mill kiddies' blockbuster
I:422;1843;jason Isaacs is in excellent form as both Mr Darling and the dastardly Captain Hook, and I also enjoyed British comedy stalwart Richard Briers as Smee.
I:422;1844;As Peter, Jeremy Sumpter has the facial features to be cheekily good.
I:422;1845;looking without becoming too cutesy, and his performance strikes a nice balance between charm and stubbornness.
I:422;1846;the special effects belong to the eighties .
I:422;1847;but the whole thing is generally good fun, with enjoyable characterizations and a delightfully old.
I:422;1848;the poignancy with which the themes of childhood and growing up are dealt with gives it the edge over other versions I have seen, including Disney's memorable 1953 animation.
I:422;1849;Peter Pan is the best Peter Pan movie by far definatley.
I:422;1850;This is my favorite movie, and every one who hates this movie, they really have a problem.
I:422;1851;wood, is definately the best english actor.
I:422;1852;Thankfully my friend suggested we see it, and the rest is history.
I:422;1853;Everyone in the cast is so wonderful.
I:422;1854;Jason Isaacs is great in this role, he gives the Captain so much emotion that I've never seen before.
I:422;1855;The whole movie is packed with emotion, it's great.
I:422;1856;Teens and adults will enjoy this more.
I:422;1857;But it's so beautiful, don't miss out on this one.
I:422;1858;It was a great movie.
I:422;1859;Am great for the whole family.
I:422;1860;Plus, It arrived quickly and was in great condition!
I:422;1861;This version of Peter Pan approaches perfection due to the excellence of the casting, the beauty of the setting, and the genius of the acting.
I:422;1862;Jeremy Sumpter is brilliant as Peter, capturing the ferocity of a clung.
I:422;1863;wood is luminous as Wendy, embodying her approaching adolescence with a sweet maturity beyond her years.
I:422;1864;The rest of the supporting cast is equally terrific, from the Lost Boys to Tinkerbell to the pirates to Olivia Williams as the mother who never loses hope.
I:422;1865;But older children and adults alike will be captivated by this very engaging fantasy.
I:422;1866;One of the better Peter Pan films, quick turn around as well.
I:422;1867;I would recommend this to anyone.
I:422;1868;But this movie brings the story of the boy who never grew up, to life.
I:422;1869;"The dazzling special effects makes this movie so real to life, it actually will make adults begin to say ""I do!"
I:422;1870;It's a really interesting take on Peter Pan that will appeal to both adults and children.
I:422;1871;Jason Isaacs is brilliant as Hook and Jeremy Sumpter is perfect as the self.
I:422;1872;centered and adventurous Peter Pan.
I:422;1873;Excellent live version of Peter Pan.
I:422;1874;My niece is a big fan of Tinker Bell so I thought she has to see the first story she was in.
I:422;1875;This is a wonderful movie!
I:422;1876;The effects too are really spectacular, and brought the magical tale to life.
I:422;1877;the star performance is by the actor who portrays Peter Pan, as played by Jeremy Sumpter.
I:422;1878;Sumpter has this naturally cheeky and playful look, yet he can also convey vulnerability when the scene warrants it.
I:422;1879;wood is convincing as Wendy, and Jason Isaacs is suitably wicked in his role as the evil Captain Hook, though he also plays Mr. Darling (Wendy's dad).
I:422;1880;I did think the gorgeous Olivia Williams who beguiled viewers in her portrayal of Jane Austen inSense and Sensibility / Miss Austen Regretswas rather wasted in her role as Mrs. Darling.2003's Peter Pan is definitely worth multiple viewings, and stays quite faithful to Barrie's work.
I:422;1881;There is also Tiger Lilly, who grabs Wendy's brother and gives him hefty a mouth to mouth kiss, getting him all excited.
I:422;1882;Wendy gives him the big thimble, the real kiss, that lasts a while.
I:422;1883;The humor of the children was pretty good.
I:422;1884;Great special effects!Maybe this movie's approach to Peter Pan should be analysed in terms of a study of adult to child relationships in a psychosocial way.
I:422;1885;advice to teachers planning to show this movie in class : preview the movie first, definitely.
I:422;1886;Daring it its successful attempt to capture J. m. Barrie's timeless story in a live action film, P. j. Hogan has created a masterpiece with his 2003 version of Peter Pan.
I:422;1887;with Peter Pan to the magical Neverland world in which one never grows up.
I:422;1888;A tasteful dresser and fearful villain, Jason Isaac's puts all other Hook's to shame.
I:422;1889;Remarkably, this Hook seems to be a decent match for the carefree spirit of Peter Pan.
I:422;1890;Since this movie is based on the book, the depth and darkness of Barrie's tale shines through and naturally there is a romance between Peter and Wendy.
I:422;1891;"Their ""feelings"" are explored in a beautiful fairy dance and a magical ""thimble"" or kiss, in the end."
I:422;1892;Moreover, the dialogue in the movie is cleverly used, especially many lines from Captain Hook.
I:422;1893;The cinematography and props team worked overtime because the scenery and vivid colors were a sight to remember in addition to James Newton Howard's musical score.
I:422;1894;but my favorite thing about Peter Pan is how we get to see the story through Wendy's eyes.
I:422;1895;This film is closest in tone to J. m. Barrie's classic.
I:422;1896;and the actor playing Peter does such a fantastic job .
I:422;1897;charismatic, cocky and charming .
I:422;1898;It's a magical movie, but definitely not for the littlest ones.
I:422;1899;above six years old would probably be best.
