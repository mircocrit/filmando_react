id;spiegazione
1;An excellent and realistic film depicting many relevancies to our own lifestyle and the world we choose to believe in.
2;Perfectly done by the brothers themselves.
3;Movie review:V for Vendetta has been probably one of the most influential films in the past 10 years.
4;"It has a very ""anti."
5;"government"" theme that resonates with many people
6;I do not believe it did the best in reviews, but I highly recommend you checking it out at least once to judge for yourself!!
7;It's really impressive how orchestral music can invoke so much emotion and bring tears to the eyes.
8;So many ppl told me to see this movie and it worth it I really enjoy seeing this movie.You all should see it right now!
9;in other words hes fighting the good fight.
10;he is really good with a knife also.
11;this movie combines elements of action,politics,sci fi and drama.
12;its a really good sleeper film that wasnt hyped relentlessly while i was trying to watch wrestling but still delivered.
13;this movie is good and should see it!
14;With the feel of the graphic novel the film looks fantastic and has a story to match.
15;I have watched it 5 times and it feels fresh!
16;Those experiments erased his memory and enhanced his physical speed and reflexes.
17;V was fighting to free his country.
18;christianity in this are right.
19;v for Vendetta is a masterpiece for all to love.
20;V For Vendetta certainly tackles some provocative and timely themes: media and government manipulation, and terrorism and the old adage that power corrupts and governments will single.
21;handedly manipulate the populace to stay in power.
22;The film is packed with ideas .
23;but it's a smartly designed and superbly acted thriller and it actually gives you something to think about while you're watching the Britain's Parliament House get blown up.
24;v For Vendetta indeed presents a scary scenario.
25;unauthorized love and unauthorized faith .
26;He is a fearsome hand.
27;Although V for Vendetta is not without its faults, it's still a timely, surprisingly entertaining and totally thought.
28;provoking film on a future.
29;world that could so easily come about in any country given the right political environment.
30;This movie laughs at all other movies and special effects.
31;meditation, since it takes HARD WORK being a good person in a world dominated by war, intrigue, politics, and poison.
32;the first movie I've seen that makes movies look as moral and interesting as books.
33;i really liked the movie.
34;the theme of a totalitarian government and the man who fights to destroy it is awesome.
35;natalie portman is beautiful and V is cool
36;This movie really makes you think and is one of my favorite movies of all time!
37;It's incredible the way the drama unfolds, and it's difficult to tell you too much without giving away the plot.
38;I would not recommend this movie for kids under the age of 15, though"
39;I thought I was going to be another comic adapted to the big screen.
40;It was a great movie, ideologically shocking, surely a pain in the capitalist's ass!
41;This is just a Must See movie, as it has a powerful message apt for the times in which we are living.
42;He appeals to people to wake up from their slumber and stand up against the endless lies and brutality of the regime.
43;That this is the message is clearly seen in his speeches as well as the way in which the people respond to it.
44;the scene at the end of the film where thousands of people, young and old march unarmed, hand in hand against the oppressors and the troops, is an extremely powerful message and reminiscent of the power of Gandhi's message of non.
45;I will put up with a lot from certain films.
46;of course, a lot of great art was created with an agenda in mind.
47;But he created memorable, well.
48;rounded characters and a mature storyline, and in the process created great art .
49;"outlawed Koran, which he says he likes for its ""poetry."""
50;"With the possible exception of ""V,"" every protagonist is a wonderful, well."
51;Even Natalie Portman is so good.
52;this is an excellent movie with brilliant, superbly.
53;written dialogue rendered beautifully by an excellent cast.
54;Well, well worth watching, time and again.
55;After finally watching it I would rank this as one of the best movies out of my collection.
56;"hero challenging the government
57;This is a philosophical cinematic entry disguised as a blockbuster.
58;Looking back into the graphic novel, the changes made from page to screen were dramatic, yet bold.
59;The """"happy"""" ending in the film gives way to the more dismal, slightly uplifting ending in the graphic novel."""
60;"To begin, the Wachowskis coupled with the direction of director James McTeigue captured the visual of ""V"" perfectly."
61;The mask was chilling, and the darkened question of his origins remained open.
62;Their depiction of this masked vigilante was brilliant.
63;V, with this film, became iconic.
64;"V for Vendetta is a great film to sit down and enjoy two hours of crisp visuals, amazing music (look for a beautiful cover by ""Cat Power""), and intense ideals."
65;It camouflages itself as a big.
66;It will keep your mind occupied for hours.
67;Without the graphic novel, this film still works as entertainment, and slight thought .
68;I enjoyed this film when it was first released on the big screen, but watching it today .
69;This time, however, she captured my attention and held it like you would expect a beautiful young woman to do, though with her own twist, namely that her persona manages to speak of her humanity more strongly than her physicality.
70;this movie is a towering achievement, and there's no doubt in my mind that it will be the standard in its genre for a long time to come.
71;And if you thought Hugo Weaving a slightly odd choice for Agent Smith in his last big role, watch him win you over in this film.
72;change operation in a real.
73;And considering that the Wachowski brothers were responsible for The Matrix as well, I thank my lucky stars that I didn't grow up to be in competition with these guys!
74;Quite unlike the Matrix sequels, this movie is very much the worthy of successor of The Matrix.
75;a couple of after thoughts: If you've heard about the Holocaust allusions, don't worry.
76;V for Vendetta is an excellent film from the Wachowski Brothers, and not your typical comic book film.
77;What's immediately striking are the parallels the government propaganda and terror in the film have with certain western governments in the world today.
78;It's an inspirational film, and gives some hope that people can unify in taking back their lives from lying, pathocratic government officials in a non.
79;a must watch for everyone!
80;I loved this movie and its call for independent thought which seems to be lacking in this US of A. It's about time someone brought up what could be in our future if we are not careful.
81;Many comic books and graphic novels have been turned into movies for the everyday viewer.
82;V for Vendetta is at the top of the list!
83;V displays the power and courage that is needed by each individual to stand up and call these governments precisely what they are Psychopathic.
84;will you choose to watch V and take a glimpse of what might be around the corner for your town or community?
85;very smart movie every american should see .
86;I'm not saying that this movie will bring great social change or that the plot is incredibly done, but the movie was pieced together perfectly.
87;Some of the effects are brilliant, and the movie doesn't focus on fighting, at least not physically.
88;"The idea of rebelling against an oppressive government isn't new, but the way that ""V,"" the main character, does it, is stylish and entertaining."
89;Hugo Weaving brings more emotion to a masked character since Darth Vader in the origional Star Wars movies.
90;A tilt of the head or a silent stare are worth a thousand words the way Weaving does it.
91;Natalie Portman does an okay job, but that is all that's required of her.
92;She does have spots of brilliance in the film, though.
93;executed or successful of film adaptations.
94;V For Vendetta gets it right this time, for sure.
95;But there will be acrimonious debate.
96;"like most comic book/graphic novels and their accompanying movies, ""V"" brings a wonderfully epic feeling by interspersing larger."
97;life goals, scenarios, and characters with the more intimate, personal, and emotional aspect of human life.
98;On Guy Fawkes Day, such a hero arrives.
99;the acting is very good.
100;Roles like Evey's are pretty meaty and easy to look good in.
101;Instead, I have to eat my words of a few days ago .
102;Even as a Portman detractor, I have to say, she's forging an interesting body of work that may soon begin to silence her critics.
103;The man is one of the most talented supporting actors of the day.
104;"lastly, I am surprised at some of the angst expressed that ""V For Vendetta"" promotes, justifies, and glorifies terrorism, particularly as viewed in a modern context."
105;in conclusion, I recommend this movie to anyone reading these reviews and fans of graphic novels and comics.
106;I think this movie was so well made and picked the best actors to portray the fictional people in this movie.
107;I also got it fast and as always love Amazon
108;I just got this movie a couple days ago, watched it during the weekend.
109;"If you like conspiracy theories complemented with good action and a touch of ""super hero"", this is a great movie for you."
110;The dialogs are superb and the actors really stand up to their characters.
111;sound wise I cannot tell much, as my sound system is not that great, but I can tell that all dialogs, knife throwing/stabbing and explosions sounded very good, at least for me.
112;all in all, I had a great experience with this movie, I expect to watch this again very soon.
113;Left wing, right wing, give up your fighting.
114;Wings, join hands, and America will soar as the nightingale and have strength of the gorilla.
115;Love one another, for we are all children of the earth and beloved by Gaya.
116;love can make it happen.
117;The movies we make will have complex, interesting stories and well.
118;Our movies will be fun and exciting crowd.
119;And we'll understand that while peace in society is good, it makes for very boring cinema, therefore our characters will face several inner and outer conflicts as they pursue their noble goals.
120;Will our characters achieve their goals?
121;so Liberals and Conservatives, come together as one, and we'll make our own movies.
122;Any fan of the comic books should love the movie.
123;hero movies that offer light entertainment .
124;the artistic equivalent of cotton candy.
125;What I found instead was that rarest of all creatures, a blockbuster film with wonderful production values that entertains and actually engages the mind by posing interesting and difficult questions.
126;"hugo Weaving does more with his voice and movements than most actors do with their entire toolkit
127;Natalie Portman is excellent as the reluctant co. conspirator, drawn into V's world.
128;Stephen Rea is downright great as Chief Inspector Finch, our """"everyman"""" figure who must sort through the rubble to dislodge truth."""
129;what makes the film so brave and unusual is that, in our nervous age, it actually casts a terrorist as hero.
130;"This is heady stuff and reminds us that, ""one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."""
131;His handoff to Portman at the finish recalls the desire of Generals to create a world where their children can study philosophy.
132;v is unlike many movies in that it has a superb 2nd act.
133;Portman's time in the faux prison, and the powerful epistolary relationship with the unseen individual one cell over, provide this film with a compelling underlying humanity.
134;At first, I was put off by Portman's British accent but I quickly got over that and into this fantastic film.
135;You'll love it so much, you'll want to own it: trust me.
136;Aside from Natalie Portman's stunning performance, Hugo Weaving and Stephen Fry give equally charismatic, unforgettable performances.
137;Very good story and even makes a point.
138;Natalie Pormant is very good in this film unlike other stiff performances.
139;"as V puts it in the film:""Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power."
140;Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
141;Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler.
142;He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
143;That dystopian future is our immediate future.
144;This is a movie that has great symbolism.
145;Besides that it is a smart action.
146;"packed movie that displays great use of slow motion, and the whole ""matrix"" special effects that everyone that they needed to use after it came out."
147;This movie is one of my favorites and I think everyone should watch it at least two times.
148;Great gift for my boyfriend!
149;He loves the actors and is intersted in Alan Moore.
150;Great price and came in time for Christmas!
151;Glad I can show him this movie
152;On the stance that I wasn't aware that this was an adaptation or have any idea how the original version was fashioned I must say that this is of the best films.
153;could count them in one hand that I have ever seen.
154;This movie manages to be both visually spectacular and a good thinker.
155;Highly recommended to those who like good movies.
156;"So many times we accept the ""signals"" that we receive from radio, tv, internet, and other popular media, so much so that we fail at times to consider the worldview behind the signals."
157;a worldview (or set of worldviews) that we might not consider when we just sit back, eat our popcorn, and watch the silver screen.
158;That is a strong and complicate question one that we must face today in this post.9.11 world that we live in, especially those of us who live in the United States, a place where so many times we forget just how volatile the world is outside our pristine middle class to upper middle class neighborhoods.
159;I have many gay friends who know that I have a very intricately woven belief system based upon what I have read and continue to read in the Bible.
160;bush like some other reviewers seem to gain from my review of the worldview behind V for Vendetta, well answer is, who knows besides the minds of the writers and directors themselves.
161;V for Vendetta, I believe, just as the comic book that spawned the movie, longs for what I would have to say, a true and pure humanistic world .
162;Great movie, totally up to date with what is going on today.
163;I love this movie as much now as I did when it debuted.
164;So inspiring that it has become the face of many protests today, this is a story that could happen anyplace, anytime and has and will.
165;So well done and love Natalie Portman.
166;What a great way to intertwine history and life.
167;you mind as well get the blu.
168;ray disc of All your favorite movies.
169;I personally trhink the whole movie is worth V's confrontation at end with the government's men in the tunnel.
170;This is a great movie.
171;It is definitely worth watching.
172;Thoroughly enjoyable and thought provoking movie.
173;It is fiction and is not entirely believable, but is worth the watching, nonetheless.
174;What a Great Movie, Lots of Action as well as deep Socio Political commentary.
175;"I saw this film with my wife when it first came out, and seeing the mask in the ""occupy"" movement brought it back to mind."
176;Knowing where the film is going allows more time to notice how it gets there.
177;***** Spoiler Alert *****See if you can follow this:1.
178;The heroine forgives the hero.4.
179;"Hugo Weaving is simply great as V
180;Natlie Portman was also great as Evey, the shy girl who comes around to V's thinking.
181;This film is disturbing, but one of the finest of 2006.
182;I have always enjoyed this movie, something that I felt needed to be added to my collection.
183;As inspiring and thought provoking as a movie can get.
184;It was interesting to see that they went back to the original 1984 movie and found the guy who played Winston Smith.
185;It's good to see that he's still able to bring power, fire, vigor and passion to this part as he did in 1984.
186;Everyone should watch this movie and realized that this is exactly what is happening today.
187;Great adaptation of the comic book.
188;(no matter what Alan Moore says) The character of V is ambiguous, intriguing, and even scary.
189;The Wachowski brothers did a good job with this one.
190;now we have """"V"""" and he is telling us we are all ONE."""
191;:) This movie has a lot to do with the mind.
192;i really enjoyed this movie.
193;It was fun to watch.
194;There is a lot of action, a strong story line and after the movie you get a sense of hope.
195;A co. worker loaned this to me and said it was a really good movie.
196;this is quite simply one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
197;subtle political statements are well said without being preachy.
198;all the actors were excellent, but Hugo Weaving's V stole the show.
199;like all good love stories, this one is heart.
200;The moment near the end, when Evey and V finally share a tender moment, Hugo Weaving's touching performance conveys the depth of the longing that V has for Evey.
201;While there's plenty of action in this movie, there's also a lot of deeper meaning.
202;Questions that I think are very relevant, especially now.
203;for instance the idea that one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter.
204;After V tortures her, making her believe that Creedy's fingermen had her.
205;The world changes as revelation pours over you.
206;That moment comes I hope to all of us at one time or another, and the scene evokes it with shocking clarity.
207;i strongly recommend this film.
208;intelligent action, suspense film with some story line.
209;why because they make MOVIES what a noble and intelligent endeavor.
210;they are wise beyond their years.)
211;I had a very good snicker where this enterprising homosexual had an old version of the KORAN.
212;"He quote, ""Loves its poetry""."
213;tHAT would be BEYOND refreshing.
214;Hollywood thought they could tell the story better their way.
215;I really enjoyed this movie.
216;really makes you think about the government controls thats for sure!
217;Great themes and beautiful cinematography.
218;Prompted me to think about liberty and control and what it is worth.
219;natalie portman is excellent as the nave girl thrown into dark plots and schemes against her will.
220;The visualization is also excellent, like one would expect from a wachawsky brothers film.
221;If you have ever liked the books Brave New World (Huxley) or 1984 (Orwell), you will love this movie.
222;The scripting in this movie is also unbelievably eloquent.
223;this Film is based on the Graphic novel V for Vendetta, written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd.
224;The Novel has a comic adult sophistication with an amazing piece of full literature.
225;This New Fascist Government in the year 2020 holds England in an Iron grip through fear and Propaganda.
226;Best Film I've seen for a long time.
227;A movie is good when you want to watch it again.
228;"It's like a great piece of art
229;Natalie Portman's acting is like a fine wine"
230;I watch her scenes over so I can savor her performance.
231;V has a mask, yet he commands the screen better than any of the overpaid actors of today.
232;The cinematography was incredible, such mastery.
233;There are wonderful little threads that run through the movie: music, the Count of Monte Cristo , tV loves to twirl his knives before he throws them, Shakespeare, no coincidences , etc.
234;i loved the story and the way it was crafted.
235;It's felt like a long time, especially due to the pushed back release date, but it was certainly worth it.
236;v For Vendetta is based upon the graphic novel written by Alan Moore, who is generally considered to be one of the greatest comics writers of all time.
237;Moore's stories are known for their political intrigue and amazing ability to look at real.
238;life situations in ways very few other forms of entertainment in any media can.
239;While the story has changed a little from the 1982 book, the 2006 film still captures the message perfectly.
240;England is one of the few countries to survive, which is lucky for them, seeing as how they were allies of the US and aided in their military campaign.
241;It turns out that V is somewhat of a Batman.
242;The question that one must ask is how far one must go in pursuit of libery and justice.
243;minded, it is also a great action film.
244;First, wonderful cast, writing, dialog.
245;Loved it I would watch this movie several times and I don't think it would ever get to feel old.
246;The Wachowski Brothers deliver another great movie.
247;Not just action, but as always a great plot.
248;Guys and girls alike will enjoy this movie.
249;The product is very good.
250;And the movie is great.
251;I would recommend this to everyone.
252;In a time when movies today are just superficial and crappy this movie was refreshing.
253;The colors, the plot line, the world that the whole movie creates makes the movie eerily real.
254;provoking and sends a relatable message.
255;This is one of my favorite movies.
256;This may be the wrong take on the story but here's what I got from a first viewing.
257;At the end of a long, trying story on the stroke of midnight on November 5th (Guy Fawkes Day), a series of spectacular explosions fells the entire building along with Big Ben, while the coda of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture plays and a beautiful fireworks display lights up the night sky.
258;This is one of my favorite all time movies.
259;I cant think of any other movie so loved and hated at the same time!
260;This is a movie that will last the test of time and will be considered one of the greats 10 years from now.
261;Super cool and fun to watch, with the added bonus of stirring you awake.
262;First of all, I want to say that I truly enjoyed reading the reviews of all of those who loved and enjoyed this movie as much as I did.
263;As for the movie, I was stunned in the best sort of way.
264;Safe to say, I was well served to do so.
265;This is a fabulous movie.
266;This is a movie that is both beautiful and though.
267;Hollywood has created some fairly inane or vaccuous films, and it was a beautiful sight for my eyes to view this wonderful tale of vengeance, justice and the pursuit of liberty and opportunity.
268;Vengeance in the form of an eloquent, sophisticated and gentle shadow of a form.
269;"A form otherwise known as ""V""."
270;I received my order within the same week and it was exactly what i expected.
271;A must see film for people that enjoy watching oppression become over come by the most powerful force on earth,the people.
272;"based on the popular graphic novel by Allan Moore, ""V For Vendetta"" offers a bone chilling view of futuristic London set in the year 2084, created by The Wachowski Brothers, the creative wizards behind ""The Matrix""."
273;in the year 2084, the world is at great odds.
274;She joins V, even after he manipulates, tricks and tortures her, because she knows no matter what, his methods are the last chance the world has got.
275;"backed by an excellent supporting cast, ""V For Vendetta"" is not only one of the finest comic book movies ever made, but also scores actual merits as a movie in general."
276;"The storyline, the acting, the direction, and special effects are all top notch, and make ""V For Vendetta"" one of the first great cinematic triumphs of 21st century cinema."
277;this two disc special edition is loaded with a stunning array of drool.
278;worthy extras, including several documentaries as well as secret access to Natalie's uproarious gangsta.
279;Let me tell you people, this movie fits that genre perfectly.
280;provoking, intense, and confusing for the undereducated, this movie has its twists and turns, and if you're one of those paranoid people that's afraid the government is watching you, this is the movie for you.
281;the two main characters share an interesting relationship, and government is in more of a national socialist form in this movie, yet it also constitutes stereotypes and ethnic hate, something.
282;This movie will make you realize there are people out there that will rise up against the masses for what they believe is right and wrong, and let me tell you folks, the power that one vigilante can do to influence a whole nation, he opened their eyes to the corruption and immorality their government held with it.
283;Watch it, it's an awesome movie.
284;A very underrated film that with all thats going on the world makes for interesting viewing, the comic was written during Mrs Thatcher period in office and years later makes you think.
285;This will work on a UK Region B player andwell worth the money.
286;I loved the artsy angular way it was shot.
287;Natalie Portman is great, and the storyline is fascinating, wouldn't expect anything less of the creator of The Matrix.
288;It was a unique mix of suspense and action.
289;I really enjoyed the mystery of V!
290;It's fun having movies that you want to watch once a year on the same day.
291;This has become one of those classics.
292;"Its a great underdog story and the ending is a bit too stylized but what the heck ""we the people"" never seem to win these days!"
293;Love this Movie, watch it every 5th of November!
294;Great Story and great acting, great character Development.
295;"There has been much discussion about the movie ""V for Vendetta""."
296;Inconvenient to the conservatives' vision is the very inception of our nation's history.
297;That meant striking back, confronting the Red Coats and burning English ships.
298;Yet, the staunch conservatives of this nation applaud our robust history, giving birth to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
299;"up concentration camps to conduct secret and illegal experiments on the ""politically."
300;"emptive strikes"" and ""extraordinary rendition?"""
301;This modern day classic speaks very clearly and powerfully to the advent of fascism in the western world and manages to be very entertaining to boot!
302;"hero, V
303;along the way, V meets Evey, a young woman with a history of her own.
304;In one of the most potent and emotionally stirring scenes of any movie I think I have seen in a long while, V compels Evey to face her own fear and victimization by the regime. '
305;birth as it is about V's Vendetta and how he carries it through.
306;This makes 'V for Vendetta' a very relevant and timely film.
307;It is an excellent and informative movie that, like those just mentioned, will be remembered.
308;I almost shed a tear inspired!!!
309;Dialogues and overall were top notch, I liked specially the introduction from V to Evey.
310;What it turns out to be is a film that stays true to the spirit of Moore's graphic novel and given a modern, up.
311;The sequence is short but informative.
312;Voice silky, velvety and sonorous, Weaving infuses V with an otherworldly, theatrical personality.
313;smiling Guy Fawkes mask real life.
314;I'd forgiven the makers of this films for some of the changes they made to the story and some of the characters for keeping V as close to how Moore wrote him.
315;Portman plays the reluctant witness to V's acts of terrorism, murders and destruction in the beginning, but a poignant and emotionally powerful sequence to start the second half of the film soon brings Evey's character not much towards V's way of doing things, but to understanding just why he's doing them.
316;This sequence became the emotional punch of the whole film and is literally lifted word for word from the graphic novel.
317;the rest of the cast seemed like a who's who of the British acting community.
318;hards, but I know how film adaptations of classic literary works must and need to trim some of the fat from the main body and theme of the story to fully translate onto the silver screen.
319;This adaptation is much closer to how Peter Jackson adapted The Lord of the Rings.
320;The makers of this film goes to great lenghts to describe throughout the film just how Sutler and his Norsefire (with its iconic Nazi.
321;like symbols and fundamentaist Christian thinking) party rose to power in the UK.
322;provoking films want their questions answered as clearly as possible and all of them.
323;in final analysis, V for Vendetta accomplishes in bringing the main themes of Alan Moore's graphic novel to life and even does it well despite some of the changes made.
324;But as a piece of thought.
325;provoking and even as a politically subversive film, V for Vendetta does it job well.
326;I thought this movie was brilliantly put together, acting was amazing (I love Natalie Portman), and definitely can transfer some of the ideas in this movie to real life today.
327;It was a great movie with twists and an amazing plot.
328;Whether you want to relate this to political propaganda or not, this movie is powerful.
329;It leaves a lasting impression that resonates with the viewer long after the movie ends.
330;Political and entertaining at the same time.
331;A good attempt to maintain the message and flavor of graphic novel.
332;Worth your time and energy to watch.
333;If you like movies where the freedom.
334;loving main character fights a corrupt system, this is your movie.
335;Hugo Weaving, the actor behind the mask, puts on a thrilling performance as the notorious masked rebel, V.
336;force will keep you watching to the very end, I guarantee.
337;I am very happy with my product.
338;Its a timeless one that doesn't get old.
339;V for Vendetta is one of the very rare movies that offer consistent solutions to reach individual freedom as well as collective freedom.
340;evey follows this path to freedom with the help of her master V.
341;In that cell you found something that mattered more to you than life.
342;Meanwhile V works on a broader plan : helping the whole population to get rid of a fascist control.
343;well, I won't give you all the details so if you want to know them you'll have to watch the movie and I really think that in thoses growing fascist time it's really worth it !
344;This movie is based on an amazing comic and has been adapted into a great movie.
345;The special effects are amazing and the acting is superb.
346;The dialog is top notch from the comic and works well on the big screen.
347;Hugo Weaving does one of the best voice overs in movie history.
348;Natalie Portman delivers her best acting to this point in her career.
349;ray transfer is crystal clear and has beautiful sound.
350;This movie is action packed, dramatic and sweet.
351;This is a must see for EVERYONE!
352;I loved this movie, I sure hope you do too!
353;with exquisite dialogues, immaculate delivery and a highly thought provoking concept, this is one movie which will be in my collections for a long time.
354;I saw elements of esoteric initiation traditions, radical theories of mind control, political science, mass communication, and more.
355;a movie that will live forever as a cult classic.
356;This is an elegant, dark riveting film.
357;It is told in terms of a grafic, gripping story performed by superb actors.
358;This movie is about freedom , freedom of speech , freedom of all .
359;The cinematography is excellent, and at least in the beginning, the characters and dialogue are very interesting and mystifying.
360;Well, more of a weeping laugh, like is this for real?
361;While the movie started off rather ridiculously fake with all sorts of unusual voice acting, it eventually got better.
362;The V character was decent, but he can't save an average film.
363;Some of the special effects were good (such as that exploding clock) but that's about the only thing worth noting I found about the film.
364;V is a great movie.
365;It has a compelling story with a pace that keeps you interested between really good action sequences.
366;acted, with a particularly good performance from Stephen Rea, who plays a cop investigating the """"terrorist"""" V. I'm not going to rehash the plot."""
367;Watch the movie and enjoy it.
368;It's a dark movie, subversive really, but carries a strong message that tyranny will not long survive the will of the people, that one strong person with a will, determination and the cleverness to use the tools of the corrupt against them, can turn the tide.
369;It's a powerful message, and it's beautifully displayed with imaginative imagery, symbolism and script.
370;"It is definitely not a ""superhero"" type movie, like the trailer painted it."
371;Bargain deal at a great price.
372;Bought it during Black Friday at amazing low price with super saver shipping!
373;i have watched this movie several times each time picking up on something subtle enough to evade the first viewing.
374;"Fairly good alternate history or science fiction in the tradition of ""1984"" and ""Fahrenheit 451."""
375;Ms. Portman proves that she is an actor and wears a shaved head beautifully.
376;I appreciate the triumph of the human spirit depicted by thousands of individuals and families turning out spontaneously to oppose their oppressors, and agree with the assertion that we are truly free when we are willing to die rather than surrender our liberty.
377;The point was made very well before the heavy.
378;I found this movie to be one of the most thought provoking and emotionally appealing movies made in the last decade.
379;The connections between the characters (Evy, V, Valarie.
380;the girl in the cell next door) are complex and at times heartbreaking.
381;The movie has an underlying political message that is very relevant today.
382;If you are reading this and trying to decide whether or not see this movie I would highly recommend it (although I have not read the graphic novel which I'm sure is better.
383;all books are better than their movie counterparts).
384;I've lent it to a few of my friends, all of which enjoyed it.
385;V is a must see movie.
386;Want to know what life will be like in a couple of years.
387;very awesome movie to watchwas very interested throughout the whole time while watching it.
388;i just bought this movie, it's one of the greatest movies of all time.
389;I don't care about the overt politics of the Wachowski brothers, I just love their movie!
390;Said regime is lead by a Big Brother.
391;judged and severely underestimated the human spirit and its hunger for freedom.
392;V exploits / utilizes this catostrophic oversight to bring his master plan into being.
393;This movie is one of my favorites.
394;Creepy, funny, action packed awesomeness, great message, beautifully done.
395;See it if you haven't.
396;Natalie shorn of her locks is a bummer but she is fantastic in the role.
397;The special features are awesome.
398;A science fiction film with a message.
399;Although many people make that claim, here it is noteworthy because The Day The Earth Stood Still was a brave undertaking, commenting on the dangers of nuclear technology during a time when our government and our country felt this was a necessary evil.
400;"I'm not saying V FOR VENDETTA rates up on the same level, but it does have its moments, making us question the purpose of government and the repercussions of overstepping those purposes for its own ""good"" rather than the individuals it's supposed to serve."
401;coming from the Wachowski brothers who made THE MATRIX trilogy, V has a good cast realized via the comic book of the same name but takes a while to get on track.
402;In Evey V sees the future of mankind, a sign that all may be made right with the world.
403;These are questions the movie poses but doesn't give answers to, and that is quite refreshing considering what Hollywood usually places in front of us (A + B = C).
404;Connect your own dots and see where V leads you.
405;This is my favorite movie of 2006.
406;It's thought provoking and a feast for the eyes, ears and mind.
407;V FOR VENDETTA presents itself as a film of ideas and then asks us not to think.
408;It's kind of a literate comic book.
409;Part Pimpernel, part 1984 and playing more French than English, V for V is likable enough but I wonder who exactly it's made for.
410;Some curiously pointed comparisons with 9/11 can keep up the interest.
411;Performances were uniformly fine and the direction even better.
412;If they had made something more serious, I might not have bothered to see it but they (everyone involved) are capable of making something of a serious or maybe even comic nature that could be very good.
413;The best thing I can say for V is that it won't put you to sleep and it was the best thing to come out this week.
414;A dictatorship by any other name is still a dictatorship.
415;Perhaps this is also true in the middle east.
416;Entertaining, intriguing, V was played superbly by the actor.
417;Natalie Portman was excellent and sexy ( even in the scenes with no hair).
418;The genre is 'comic book comes to life but it is better than all the comic book movies ( like the Dark Knight batman movies are very good, more real).
419;fantastic dialogue V 's Sililoquy is well written and witty, intelligent movie.
420;Well acted, well made and unique.
421;V for Vendetta is a very powerful film.
422;Later, V holds the most.
423;It has a certain and eerie that.
424;this is one of the first movies that I have seen in a long time that made me reflect so much on real.
425;V for Vendetta is a sci.
426;esque thriller with a connection to today's world.
427;This was a decent movie.
428;This movie got a lot of hype, but it is worth at least one viewing.
429;hmmmm, does this remind you of any present.
430;The theme of people willing to give up personal liberty for safety is worth thoughful consideration and is reflective of the choices we need to make today to counter terrorism.
431;apart from the laughably strained political correctness, the movie had excellent cinematography, good acting, but little action.
432;All I can say is this is a great movie, with a great story.
433;The acting is solid, the climax is rememberable, and it moves you as a member of mankind.
434;The modern version of Orwell's 1984, all the warnings and traps that the world is heading into and how to identify and eventually defeat it.
435;The movie takes place in the near future in Great Britain.
436;"His location is just given as ""underground,"" and he always speaks to his sycophants and the nation from this secure location."
437;He uses unfounded fear and Christian morals to maintain his authority.
438;It is complete with Christian inferences.
439;"fearing Englishman, and I'm goddamned proud of it!"""
440;During one part of the movie, a BTN producer of a news program, states, it's their job to report the news, and it is the job of the government to create the lies.
441;Although, this movie is based on a comic series from the 1980s, it has striking parallels to modern issues and events through various allusions we can infer.
442;V is the ultimate voice of reason.
443;He completely understands the issues of life in England.
444;"Yes, he blows up Parliament
445;V is deemed the patriot within all of us.
446;The brilliant Hugo Weaving excels and Natalie Portman redeems herself (Princess Amidala, anyone?)
447;unsurprisingly for a film that is based on a comic book/graphic novel, the main characters almost border on archetypes, and this lends an appropriately comic.
448;Of particular note is Hugo Weavings ability to emote from behind a glossy, permanently.
449;natalie Portman gives a convincing portrayal of the personal journey that Evey is persuaded to undertake, and John Hurt excels as the megalomaniacal Chancellor Sutler.
450;show hosts every bit as much as the crack.
451;to call the supporting cast excellent would be an understatement.
452;Of particular note is Rupert Graves' brilliant portrayal of Dominic, the 'Voice Of London', a twisted, hate.
453;His diatribes are punctuated with catch.
454;pure family background and whose disillusionment with the party enables him to play a defining role in the plans of V and Evey.
455;I love everything about the industry and am even working towards being a part of it.
456;From the original ideas that it was structured upon, to the visual effects .
457;She's scared of the powerful regime running the country and she's trying to follow rules, but she still has just enough fight in her to make it obvious that she's one of the few who would understand V's plight.
458;words speech was well placed), is a perfect lovable and deeply interesting anti.
459;the story is woven perfectly, giving just enough background and plot at the right moments.
460;The characters are two dimensional and unrelatable.
461;This movie is one of the most moving and greatest films, ever.
462;I've watched it a few times, and every time I do I realize something else about it.
463;first of all, I think it's a great idea of the future.
464;And Evey(Natalie Portman)is totally awesome in this film.
465;You've got to hand it to the girl for being able to be shaved and still look great.
466;and V in himself is such an interesting and spell.
467;Yet he's hilarious at the same time, so open and honest, well just funny.
468;and the whole idea is just amazing, and beyond me.
469;The film V for Vendetta is a visually stunning film portrayal of a man bent on vengence against those who tormented him personally and who have oppressed his country.
470;Like the film Sin City which also brought to life characters in a graphic novel, the visuals in this film are striking and are to a certain extent, a large part of the story.
471;This coupled with his personal vendetta against those who used him in medical experiments contributes to a dearth of ideas driving the story.
472;The main insight to the ideas driving V's actions comes in the television broadcast he makes to the nation.
473;so we must suspend our judgement here and concentrate on the visual impact, which is striking.
474;I picked up on two interesting cinematic parallels.
475;In both films, government is sustained through lies and a focus on enemies, real and imagined.
476;In both movies a masked antihero imprisons a young woman in order to capture her heart and mind, with a repressed love interest between the two protagonists.
477;The visual impact of the movie recalls the """"film noir"""" genre of the 1940's and 1950's, with shadowy lighting, rain, and heroes of questionable nobility."""
478;i thought the acting was well done.
479;Insightful dialogue provides the window to the man behind the mask.
480;in spite of the fact that this movie offers few profound ideas, it is great entertainment and kept me riveted to the screen from the beginning to the end.
481;D for dorky review title.
482;This is a great movie.
483;Based on a graphic novel by alan moore, so the plot is very good.
484;In the original comic, England is one of few countries that have survived a nuclear fall out only to be run by a power hungry, right.
485;The movie adaptation by the Wachowski brothers wisely changes the post.
486;The emotions of Evey and rationalizations of V are played masterfully in the hands of Portman and Weaving making Evey's physical and emotional torment very real and V's philosophical ravings balance delicately on the edge of insanity.
487;we never once see V's face and yet rarely is a character so affecting as this masked hero.
488;The production of the film seems to be one long line of great decisions, among them John McTeigue's decision not to turn V into a simple action movie.
489;Wouldnt mind seeing this go down in America.
490;the action is definitely good.
491;this is just an amazing movie!
492;this is just an awesome movie!
493;Excellent action movie with suspenseful twisting plot and wonderful actors.
494;Little bloody but great fight sequences.
495;Would recommend to any action lovers.
496;Great plot and stunning scenes.
497;Life should be simple, like a comic book.
498;but the most obviously jarring element is the fact that the film is set in London, with a facist, right wing government, and yet the film is a crude portrayal I assume, of 'where Dubya is taking us'.
499;V is an extremely experienced killer while no one knows his real name and we never see his face.
500;It's a truly entertaining piece of work!
501;recommend this to anyone who's looking for something with alot of action and makes some sense!
502;well after reading most of those prior reviews I guess we'll start with the film itself.
503;I don't know what the people before me watched, but this film is at BEST decent, trust me.
504;First off, this is a thrilling movie, both visually and in its performances.
505;That makes for thrilling action and wonderful set pieces.
506;We'd all love to see the plan.
507;But then it will be a good fascism!
508;Great movie, go and grab it
509;Bless you and keep up the good work boys.
510;If you are someone suffering from outrage fatigue with what's going on in our country (that would be America, even though I don't recognize it anymore), you will totally love this movie.
511;And if not, regardless, it is a totally entertaining, thinking person's movie.
512;show it to all of your friends and have the time of your life!
513;This is a fantastic movie.
514;Gets me Everytime, with just the right amount of violence ,action, emotion, and a beautiful storyline / plot this is a movie anyone will enjoy.
515;It is good to see Natalie Portman given the chance to take on a more challenging role than she was given in her part in the Star Wars prequels where, along with the rest of the cast, she saw lots of action but had little opportunity to act.
516;however, if you can suspend your beliefs as to what is the most likely future of particular western countries, this is a pretty good movie.
517;The visuals are varied and this is the type of movie worthy of being on blu ray.
518;It is now more entertaining to stay at home w/ 7.1 surround sound and a good blu ray movie than it is going to the theater.
519;far better visuals and as good or better sound at home !!
520;I'm all for freedom of expression, but this movie takes basic Christian beliefs and twists them to seem opressive.
521;Natalie Portman is a brilliant actress, unfortunatly this role is way beneath her.
522;I wasnt impressed with anything in this movie and will be selling my copy at my next yard sale.
523;I had a friend who told me I MUST watch this movie, so I bought it.
524;The young lady who stars in the movie did a good job, but as I sat there and watched it I kept wondering when the movie would end.
525;She would rather be smart than famous and in this movie she was willing to show off the shape of her skull for her cause.
526;This movie was a nice change from the Wachowski brothers, especially after the second and third matrix movies.
527;It has the same hate for the man while not being a pleaser for the fans and is done right.
528;This movie will suck you in and wow you with big explosions but is more of an entertainment film then a serious think piece.
529;This movie was by far the surprise hit of my year so far!
530;It is so diverse, and so well done.
531;V will have you cheering, routing for, crying, and yes even . . . thinking.
532;Big brother is watching and manipulating all of us.
533;I saw V for Vendetta and I liked it, but it was really violent.
534;The acting was good and the story was good, but the violence made it hard to watch.
535;This movie was in excellent condition and is a family favorite.
536;Deep in its concept and while not for young children, is a study of the human spirit.
537;Creative Orwellian drama with a powerful message.
538;Highly recommended 16+ age group.
539;When V for Vendetta is actually about vendetta, it's highly entertaining.
540;Director James McTeigue seems to want V to be both a dark, mysterious character and a warm, romantic one.
541;Ah yes, the classic story that Hollywood butchered for political gain.
542;That way we please all the liberals who are running Hollywood!
543;Great movie that was spectacular re.
544;Highly recommend this seller they were fantastic.
545;Finally I saw it and it did live up to and exceeded my expectations.
546;this movie worked as an action thriller, with just the right dose of irony, and then on another level altogher, it was a thought provoking film about politics, freedom, and the lack thereof.
547;One of the best films ever.
548;The artistry, nuances and entire film sequences were well done!
549;This movie is on a list of my top favorites!
550;All of this is slickly presented and dressed up to be something other than what it is .
551;Christianity is openly condemned throughout the film.
552;top that it smacks of film.
553;And we have to remember that it came from a comic book.
554;Some movies are provocative and disturbing in a good way .
555;This movie is a complex journey into the minds of the Wachowski brothers and how they have got the knowhow to put trilogy depth into one single movie.
556;They have this movie so multilayered, that half the movie, V is talking through the other characters and since the whole movie is one idea, it turns out to be possibly the most wholesome movie I've ever seen!
557;From beginning to end, its poses many questions and lets you create the answers within your own mind.
558;Everytime I watch this movie, I find something new and Natalie Portman plays the part perfect.
559;It takes a couple time of watching it for it really to kick in.
560;Well acted (Natalie Portman is great in this), well written, and very well directed.
561;The story line was excellent, touching, moving, inspiring, etc etc etc.
562;In blu ray this movie is amazing.
563;Everything is crisp and sharp.
564;If you liked this movie before you will love it now.
565;this is a really excellent movie.
566;First of all, it has a really good story to it, but also a moral story about standing up and believing in a cause to fight against oppression and tyranny and how their strength in numbers.
567;But this movie does have a meaning to it.
568;There are parallels to society and government today that made it compelling.
569;Great movie, for once there is a movie that makes you think about the future of the government, and what could happen.
570;Beautifully acted, stunning set design, great story.
571;There is nothing better than a movie that makes you think and this dark look into our not.
572;This movie goes to show you that great visual effects only work if they support an equally great story/script.
573;"It is a good movie dealing with the question, ""Who is a terrorist?"""
574;First the goods: Great storyline and idea with intriguing mask and voice acting by Hugo Weaver.
575;This is definitely an action movie made for people who enjoy watching violence.
576;The movie also made me feel that it has a political agenda of promoting homosexuals.
577;The movie does a good job making homosexuality look beautiful.
578;I love it, there is a somewhat brutality to the storyline, which I compare to Nazi Germany and 1984 although I expect that this was the intention, The fight scenes are highly clever, this definitely comes from its origins as a graphic novel, they are a bit like Kick.
579;The film questions what it is to be human .
580;freedom to love, freedom to speak etc .
581;and leaves you wondering what it is you value the most in this sense, what could you give up and what would you fight for.
582;The fact that we never find out the identity of V is so important.
583;A beautiful, well created film that everyone should watch at least once.
584;Riveting, wonderful, thought provoking entertainment!
585;The acting was excellent and there were no gratuitous sex scenes.
586;What a refreshing thing that is.
587;one of the best movies I have seen in awhile.
588;I bought this as a gift for my adult son.
589;We had seen the movie on television and he loved it.
590;All I can say is I feel like we need about 1 million of those masks about now in the US.
591;I highly recommend it for anyone who has a passion for standing up for what they believe in.
592;It's a very flashy movie with the explosions, action sequences, and incredible knife combat scenes, but it lacked the entire meaning of the graphic novels it was BASED UPON.
593;It's super awesome and great for anyone who likes movies in this sort of genre.
594;I thoroughly enjoyed this film.
595;It had a great story line and the plot twists were well timed.
596;Natalie Portman did a good job at being a scared girl turned revolutionary.
597;This movie reminded me of George Orwell's masterpiece 1984.
598;This movie has a way of blurring the line between a nonviolent conscience and a radical need for change, and the fact that it was able to do that fascinated me on so many levels.
599;of course, the cast has to be thanked as well, most notably Hugo Weaving for his incredibly effective portrayal of the shadowy bandit known only as V.
600;What we're shown is a classic antihero character, completely and appropriately surrounded by an air of mystery (which is obviously helped by the fact that he's never seen without wearing a Guy Fawkes mask).
601;But rest assured it's one of the most pivotal plot devices in this movie.
602;"Even though that aspect is fairly unoriginal (all you have to do is read George Orwell's ""1984"" or see Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" to see what I mean), the way ""V For Vendetta"" is told completely makes up for it, especially since it sends a message that a lot of people need to hear."
603;Hints of the Holocaust were added to the mix, as well, and that to me was even less surprising.
604;She's introduced to V in a back alley after some corrupt police officers attempt to rape her.
605;"some may be offended by ""V For Vendetta""'s unapologetic views on oppression and freedom, and they certainly have the right to feel that way."
606;Nevertheless, I truly feel that this is one of the most relevant films of the year, especially given the issues and controversies we continuously see in the world.
607;I didn't like Natalie Portman's British accent in it but other than that it was wonderful.
608;The plot line kept me and my friends intrigued and I think this movie is a cult classic.
609;"screen viewing, I immediately and without hesitation named ""V For Vendetta"" the most intelligent piece of filmmaking ever screened."
610;Derived from Alan Moore's graphic novel, this allowed the writers (the brilliant Wachowski Brothers) and the director, James McTeigue, to fully explore the uses of anarchy as a means to achieve freedom from oppression.
611;hugo Weaving deserves accolades of the highest order for his amazing portrayal of the damaged man behind the mask.
612;"Though cartoonish in some respects, ""V For Vendetta"" makes its point with style and cinematic panache."
613;this movie will now be a classic for the use of the mask on real life
614;Yes this movie has a vendetta, it is to place all the blame of terroristic acts on a decent and civil society.
615;This movie was absolutely nauseating.
616;On another note, this film has it's ups and downs.
617;But this is a great movie, I highly recommend it, compared to the graphic novel, I prefer the book but this movie has its own sequences which are very tru to the comic.
618;this is one of those movies that gets all hyped up just like Blair Witch.
619;It has a very 'in your face' you should be nice to gays/lesbians message to it.
620;i do not know how this movie is selling so well, but I imagine it wont last, once people actually start to watch it.
621;This movie has great action sequences and the story is very good even though it differs a bit from the graphic novel which I like also.
622;Also the music to this movie is very moving and appropriate, it really emphasizes what is going on.
623;For me V for Vendetta was the best movie of 2005.
624;I've already seen it three times and I look forward to seeing it again.
625;as far as the movie goes it is powerful and thought provoking.
626;A timely reminder that a government should be subservient to the people and not the other way around.
627;There is plenty of action, some great dialogue, some wonderful scenes.
628;It's just a damn good movie.
629;Suffice to say this is a good one, and should be on your must see list.
630;Amazingly enough, V for Vendetta winds up being quite a memorable film.
631;but the core message and dramatic high points of the film are undeniable.
632;Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving both give inspired performances, backed with a surprising amount of emotional depth.
633;V for Vendetta is an awesome movie!Every person should watch this movie at some point in their life time.
634;Because the main view of this movie points out how Governments are generally sneaky.
635;V for Vendetta also incorporates a bit of England's history making it a great movie.
636;V for Vendetta is a well.
637;crafted movie with an engaging storyline, excellent acting, and enough visual effects and stunts to keep the action moving.
638;what is interesting is that, while one of the story's main themes is terrorism (and what is the difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter?)
639;hugo Weaving (working at a huge disadvantage because he never removes the mask) lets V's favorite weapons, words, roll over us and he uses his sonorous baritone as well as his body language to wonderful effect.
640;It won't get him any Academy nods, which I think is a shame, but it's a performance well worth seeing.
641;and the rest of the supporting cast is very good as well.
642;John Hurt, especially, as Sutler is wonderful.
643;You can see the zealotry as spits his words over the looming screen as he speaks to his subordinates.
644;(And on a lighter note, his moment of Benny Hill slapstick is hilarious as well as insightful).
645;If terrorism and violence provides the cerebral A plot of the story, V's self.
646;realization of who he is and what he has become provides the heart of the story.
647;It can be watched more than once and if you pay attention, you will find something new to think about each time, while still enjoying the action sequences and the stunts.
648;I love Natalie Portman and in this film she's fantastic.
649;The plot is great and it makes you question yourself about democracy and revolution.
650;Rarely do you find an action movie that combines good acting, a well developed plot and characters, excellent effects, and a thought provoking message.
651;V for Vendetta has all of those in full measure.
652;uncompromised honesty to the death.
653;That's what this film symbolizes to me, that unbending honesty that comes with a genuine revolution.
654;"Sur for some ""V"" would seem to go to extremes, and Evey a little too stark and minimalist with the movie, but I think and know that they genuinely captured the spirit of the ""Vendetta"" comic books from the early 1980s."
655;It's certainly an admirable film and one that's really easy to like but I found it hard to love.
656;Standing in front of a tree once a year and saying the environment is good does not make you an environmentalist.
657;The film works at the same time for reasons it doesn't but despite the fact the Wachowski Brothers are all over this, it certainly makes up for the last 2 Matrix movies.
658;The story, acting and action are excellent!
659;This is a great movie.
660;A great after Xmas gift to me.
661;I thought V for Vendetta was a really good movie, and it now the best of Alan Moore's Work that has now been brought to the big screen.
662;It would be very interesting to hear Alan Moore talk about his reason for not being involved in the movie.
663;V for Vendetta is a movie I will be glad to own.
664;V is to represent the ability all humans, and citizens of a country should have, not to be afraid of their government but for their government to be afraid of them.
665;And that your government can be trusted.
666;People given freedom will be corrupted by that freedom, and for the most part it is true.
667;Freedom means death, freedom means murder and hate, freedom means love and expression, freedoms danger and uncertainty, and freedom means Power and Individuality.
668;I watched it over and over again so I could write an accurate paper but I found myself liking the characters.
669;This movie is considered a classic: a movie everyone should see before they die.
670;This is an amazing and weird movie.
671;I belive this must be a heck of a comic book, and I hope they did it justice brining it to the big screen.
672;I like this movie a lot, and I'm going to be digging for the illustrated graphic novel soon.
673;The action in this movie is fast, whitty, and very well staged.
674;"For yonger fan's, check out ""The Wall"" for a deeper appreciation."
675;This is one of the best movies I've seen this year.
676;Natalie Portman is fantastic in the part of Evie, caught in the web of government and anti.
677;An excellent movie, it was much better than I expected.
678;This movie was Philosophical, I have to watch it over and over again, great plot, I need to watch it more times to really get a chance to evaluate it, Very clandestine it was.
679;"V is a skillful blending of the revenge picture (""They tortured him and left him for dead."
680;That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie!
681;The dulcet and eloquent articulation by Hugo Weaving playing futuristic revolutionary known as V belies the powerful message of the film.
682;"Director James McTeigue working with a script provided by the Wachowski brothers and based of the novel by Alan Moore creates a socially critical film in the mode of the classic story ""1984""."
683;He schools Evey in his philosophy and together they work towards making major changes into societal structure.
684;the special effects and visual imagery were prodigious and the stunt work was also first rate.
685;I am recommending everyone to watch this.
686;its full of action it makes you think.
687;It gives you the sense of adventure.
688;platoIn the 1980s comic books took a revolutionary turn (one the likes of which had not been seen since the `60s and `70s) and became politically and socially relevant again.
689;It was in this political climate that David Lloyd and Alan Moore createdV for Vendetta, a highly intelligent graphic novel series.
690;"V for Vendetta was brilliantly written and illustrated and helped to prove that comic books weren't just for children
691;V uses Evey to gain access to his targets but she manages to get away.
692;Soon she is caught and arrested.
693;martin Luther King, Jr. the film is skillfully directed by newcomer James McTeigue and features an amazing cast including Hugo Weaving as V, Natalie Portman as Evey, and John Hurt as Chancellor Sutler.
694;v for Vendetta is a disquieting film, a film that is thought provoking and questions authority.
695;Yet despite the film's many flaws it remains very relevant to the issues we face in modern society.
696;john Hurt is a terrific actor who is given the role of the big villain.
697;The movie completely misunderstands how terror leaders hold power.
698;balancing kindness to keep at least some key people on their side.
699;There is one scene that is certainly was him, but that is beside the point.
700;He does a fine job making the character with his voice, but the character of V, from what the movie reveals as his origins, is beyond implausible.
701;the best role in the movie probably goes to Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch (he was also very good as the lead in Citizen X as the detective Lt. Bukarov).
702;He has that dogged presence that just keeps after the truth no matter where it leads and despite all impediments put in his way.
703;James McTeigue and the Wachowski brother's truly give us film fans something to drewl over here.
704;V for Vendetta is not only more than relevant to the dark capitolist(New World Order)times we are living in right now,but it is also simply a perfect example of brilliant film making.
705;film fan or a lieing right wing neo.
706;For us true film fans though,this Two.
707;you absolutely must see this film.
708;What this film IS is a viewing must.
709;Plot line is so good!
710;Highly recommended for those interested in action movies and movies of this plot line.
711;Yes, If your a huge fan of the Matrix Trilogy, then you will love this movie!
712;Marvelous, Political, poetic, romantic, has a """"phantom of the opera"""" twist in my opinion with a Matrix twist."""
713;An utterly amazing film that critics have tried to dismiss.
714;Do they really have our best interests at heart?
715;v for vendetta beautifully illustrates through the character portrayed by Portman, how inner strength and integrity is an intimidating weapon.
716;I enjoyed V's monologues the most.
717;The story developed a plot without making you keep track of too many interlocking twists.
718;This is a great movie for all audiences.
719;I want to be entertained.
720;This was a very well made movie and great actors.
721;Timely and thought provoking considering the times we live in.
722;Liberty and freedom are worth fighting for and tyranny should be defeated.
723;I will say that, while the film is visually engaging, I found myself wondering what all the hype was about.
724;Yes, Hugo does a fine job, but he had a mask on the entire time so it makes acting a bit easier.
725;the action and or directing this movie took are decent, and the few fight and or action sequences are highlights to the film, but they are few as I mentioned, and I expected more of them.
726;It's not a bad movie but it's far from the masterpiece some would have you believe!
727;Loved it and would watch it again.
728;Great story and great cast.
729;Glad that I could got a chance to see it
730;This one of the dumbest movies ever made.
731;There are moments and lines and all sorts of other things in this film that are completely ripping off Terry Gilliam's masterpiece Brazil.
732;This is a powerful film that succeeds primarily on the strength of Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman who are entirely believable in extraordinary roles.
733;Whomever enjoys justice, you must watch it.
734;The movie was well written and acted.
735;Overall I liked the movie and wanted to see it again.
736;Even my cousons who don't like a lot of the same movies as me liked it.
737;It is a must see movie.
738;I popped this movie in the player having heard some of the negative comments and was really surprised.
739;It's interesting how the Big Brother philosophy is tied together with a semi.
740;Putting the politics aside, the movie was beautifully photographed.
741;The atmosphere captures a sense of film noir, especially when dealing with the city streets.
742;The movie was really well cast as Stephen Rea was good, and Natalie Portman was even better.
743;Hugo Weaving does an amazing job of showing elegance, menace, and angst at times, all while wearing a mask!
744;Definitely a thought provoking movie.
745;s**t. great film, gd amount of action talking and a great storyline with a touch of matrix screenshots.
746;I have wanted to see this movie since it was in theaters and I just kept procrastinating and procrastinating for I dont even know why, even after I received it I still waited.
747;Those who resisted the meteoric rise of the new High Chancellor have been dealt with ruthlessly, producing a population cowed and blind to the evils of their brave new nation.
748;one man brave enough to speak the truth, rally the masses, and get his message out that the government is beyond corrupt and purely evil.
749;One has to look at the whole picture, though.
750;back to the film itself, one must pay tribute to a number of wonderful performances.
751;Natalie Portman proves once again that she's among the finest actresses in the world (a fact which George Lucas never seemed to acknowledge, since he didn't allow her to actually act in Star Wars Episode III).
752;Nothing says commitment like a beautiful woman allowing her head to be shaved for the benefit of the character.
753;Stephen Rea brings a wonderful human counterpart to the story as the Chief Inspector, and John Hurt is brilliantly effective as the evil Chancellor.
754;The overall cinematography is also spectacularly done, while the special effects are really something to see.
755;I really liked this movie and it's an enjoyable watch.
756;After the cinematic excrement that was The Matrix 2 and the cinematic excrement of the excrement.
757;Because that's exactly what V is: a sociopath.
758;hero and more a freaking messiah!
759;The use of color is brilliant.
760;It's visually beautiful from start to finish.
761;There's finally some action, and it's THE SLOWEST SCENE IN THE MOVIE!
762;it was effective in one way, though.
763;Good shipping n nice price n must have for movie collector .
764;You wanted to see it as criticism of America, and you found it.
765;for the rest of us, it was a good movie, especially if you prefer movies that aren't all car chases, gunfights, and scantily clad teenage girls.
766;There was an action element to it, of course, but mostly this was a movie that made one think about the power of words, of ideas, of freedom.
767;"If you're into ""thrill a minute"" movies, keep going."
768;If you don't mind people actually talking to each other, give it a look.
769;my friends were telling me about this movie and how good it was.
770;man this movie is great.
771;"numbingly dull lobotomy of Alan Moore's brilliant and haunting ""V for Vendetta""."
772;"mcTeigue cut his teeth setting up the slick action shots for the Matrix flicks, and it shows: in ""V"" there is a doozy of a fight sequence, and it's a bracing example of what the flick might have been."
773;Terrorism is, like, you know, the new Black!
774;It has a real thinning effect!
775;And nothing brings a people together more than blowing up an historic national landmark with a tube.
776;but throw out some fine performances along the way.
777;but the Wachowskis have deprived their Shakespearean anarachist of a suitable foe.
778;"it's amusing that ""V"" gets raves for thumbing its wooden nose at Bush's America, where even illegal aliens feel free to march for their 'rights'."
779;I just wanted to drop a quick line and say that this is one of my all time favorite movies.
780;Revenge stories are great and this one is overwhelmingly one of the best out there.
781;His most outstanding acting abilities in previous movies have all been in his facial features, stern, menacing, and yet capable of compassion.
782;weaving's face is NEVER seen in this movie.
783;right wing Christian religious bent (which uses a double.

785;based autocracy and dare the viewer to exercise one's intellect, continue to be made and seen by a widestream audience, hope remains.
786;The film is thought provoking and intelligent.
787;I had very high expectations going into this film as it has been on my to.
788;Many people told me about how great this film is.
789;I plan to watch this film a few more times as the dialogue is lengthy, sometimes convoluted, but somehow still engaging and grips you.
790;I would recommend this film to an audience that is interested in more than a summer spectacle and willing to put their brainpower to use.
791;Film is loosely based on comic, but is more like a happy.
792;ended version of 1984 crossed with phantom of the opera with a lot of modern political references.
793;It's a film about how great anarchy is.
794;The government has created a police state that keeps people in line.
795;They talk and talk and then talk some more.
796;as for the rest of the film, the best scene involves a humorous take on the government.
797;He's bold because he puts his name and face out for the world too see.
798;He and those who agree with him are the ones who are right.
799;If we can somehow get rid of them the world will be a better place.
800;It begins in the human heart.
801;I cannot speak for the adaptation from the book but I found the film inspirational in that one understands the experiences from which the courage to face up to a totalitarian regime come from.
802;"This is the focus of ""V for Vendetta,"" that power is with the people to produce change."
803;This is true throughout history from the American Revolution to the Orange Revolution.
804;"The point of the film is that we all have a responsibility to hold our governments accountable for what they do, not just a single figure who has the courage to stand up
805;For me, this is a story of the triumph of the human spirit.
806;the casting is perfect on all levels.
807;Stephen Rhea's Inspector Finch is an interesting everyman whose aim is to capture """"V"""" but gradually understands the depths of the corrupt regime he is supporting, Stephen Fry has an excellent part as a television comedy show host who has much to hide and Tim Piggott."""
808;smith is a superb villain.
809;"time fan of John Hurt it was enjoyable to see him again, especially since in the film of ""1984"" he was the victim of Big Brother."
810;i was drawn into the film from the start and the 132 minutes passed faster than I wanted, and I highly recommend it.
811;"The movie immediately struck me as intriguing and original
812;The movie was doing a great job of involving me in the story and creating the beginnings of a sympathetic concern for the characters.
813;hugo Weaving does an impressive job as the enigmatic V and Natalie Portman has an opportunity to display her acting skills in a very convincing manner as the young Evey.
814;It is very effective in conveying a memorable impression of tragedy, darkness and violence which some may find hard to handle.
815;I saw this movie and I have to tell that I love it.
816;a subversive, well elaborated plot, that reminds you of The Matrix fiction storyline but with a more romantic and revolutionary ambient.
817;I wanted my kids to see it.
818;one of my favorite books of all time.
819;V has a few excellent, thought.
820;The acting is also some of the best I've seen.
821;That said, V for Vendetta is an excellent movie well worth owning.
822;The funny thing about this movie is this.
823;Now why is this a funny thing you might ask.
824;I did read the comic, and in fact, reread it before I saw the movie.
825;The acting was fantastic, the script was still quite good, the cinematography was great, and overall it was a good movie.
826;The letter from Valerie was still just as moving, and actually moved me closer to tears than the comic ever could.
827;Portman was incredible in that moment too.
828;She made me believe she found that inch.
829;Hollywood likes to create a love story if they can.
830;There was a SMALL love story in the comic between them, but it was a differant kind than in the movie.
831;I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good movie that has enough of a thoughtful part to it to make you interested between the action, which is much less than I think most people will expect going in.
832;Give it a try, and go in with a totally open mind about it.
833;Read the graphic novel too, its fantastic.
834;Moore is a genius at the art of the graphic novel.
835;Great movie, Hugo Weaving's acting is mesmerizing and you don't even see one facial expression.
836;His dialog is perfectly executed.
837;++Spoiler Warning++The movie itself is brilliant, the dialogue stupendous.
838;In real life walking around quoting Shakespeare may be pedantic, but in a movie with a subtext about the power of words it's more than appropiate and actually enjoyable.
839;The genius of that scene is that it makes the movie morally consistent.
840;It still takes the will and civil courage of the people to actually walk the streets to take it back.
841;This """"movie a clef"""" as a metaphore is simply perfect and should be seem for what it is ."""
842;This movie is definitely in my top ten of all time.
843;wearing Weaving, who has the perfect voice for such a mysterious and threatening part.
844;see it for the sake of Weaving.
845;It's V for Vendetta but with more action, passion and emotion.
846;Sword fighting, bombs, beauty, fireworks, and conspiracy all laid upon the themes of our times and exported to London.
847;V for Vendetta is a completely satisfying movie.
848;Whole, compelling, entertaining, inspiring, and visually awe.
849;inspiring it overcomes its flaws and delivers like few movies ever have.
850;Its story line is lifted right from the Bush.
851;Perhaps the most amazing element of this movie is the acting.
852;Natalie is beautiful, and I found myself falling in love with her character during the movie, but I never thought she was even a mediocre actress.
853;Just like the brother brought out a worthy performance from Keanu Reeves in the Matrix, they have pulled off their magic again with another less than stellar artist.
854;I thought that this was a good little political thriller, it had some outstanding dialogue, exemplery effects and an overall pretty good little screenplay.
855;"Portman does a great job for such a vague charactor and ""V"" is a wonderful part as a whole, he truly represents a true, opinionated and couragous hero."
856;"I thought that it got stuck in the mud and began to get a little slow their in the middle but it sped up again in the end and overall it succeeded in being what slowly becomes a very unique ""Marvel"" film."
857;"Some of the parts of the film I thought were very clever such a the speech that ""V"" makes @ the beginning of the movie in which he speaks in words that all start with the letter ""V""."
858;"Some other people say that you should read the comic book (I believe it is), before watching the movie so that you have a full understanding about what is going on and that way you can enjoy the ""Deeper Meaning"" as well, ."
859;Natalie Portman did a phenomenal job acting.
860;The overall movie is so good you'll want to watch it twice.
861;and centers around a clever, charismatic, Shakespeare.
862;Talent that, to be honest, I'd have never thought her capable of.
863;ear grin and leave you wanting more.
864;Sutler is fit for a straight.
865;weaving, Portman, and Hurt are also followed by a slew of wonderful British actors including Stephen Rea, Roger Allam, Tim Pigott.
866;It has the potential to really wake people up to the things that are going on in the world and what they can lead to if we don't start resolving things peacefully.
867;Packed with lots of dramatic dialogue, hypnotic Shakespeare quotations, uber.
868;Some things about this movie are cool.
869;visually, it can be pretty interesting.
870;And Natalie Portman is wonderful to look at, as always.
871;bang good (for me, at least!
872;"heck, even the ""V"" is so much like the telly series V!!!"
873;"With a film striking so many ""chords"" within us, it's bound to find an audience, but is it original?"
874;Damn straight it is!This movie, obviously, done in the UK, gives visions of grace and beauty, of the every man wanting a voice, wanting justice, wanting to believe.
875;"It gives you humanity
876;The writing is fast paced, inventive so what was old is new again.
877;a haunting film that stays with you.
878;Yes, you will remember, remember!!
879;Great movie, and i would 100% suggest it for you.
880;This Video is really interesting and quite good!!!
881;A classic dystopian film that combines visual artistry, and action.
882;Great product for the promotion of the #Occupy movement.
883;I have never read the Alan Moore graphic novel but I suspect it is worthy of the hype.
884;Yes V is the shady hero who was `created' by the government state and eventually brings their power to an end.
885;Needless to say, this film offers nothing exciting or new to the genre.
886;She is a nonentity in a film that focuses her as the main character (I think).
887;She literally just walks the streets.
888;anyway, I can imagine the Matrix brothers typing away at their computers with lofty goals of blending the `1984' genres into something new and cool.
889;Most of the movie is centered around Evey who gets rescued by V in the beggining and she slowly but surely starts to help V in his quest to overthrow the government.
890;We both love the film after watching it.
891;But I will say that Hugo Weaving did a fantastic job as V.
892;He was very mysterious and charismatic in his quest for vengence.
893;This is just good movie making!
894;It has all the action guys like, the love interest for the ladies, and .
895;what a surprise these days, an actually well written script with good plot and a turn or two.
896;And often the top of her head too.
897;But overall a very watchable film, we actually never used the F/F feature to skip any slow parts.
898;I highly recommend this movie .
899;it's a lot more than just a movie.
900;it's giving us a message .
901;It was THE BEST movie i have seen in a long time I give it 2 thumbs up, 5 stars, 10 out of 10, perfect MUST see movie.
902;Glancing through the other reviews, I find it funny that most all the focus is centered around politics as the theme of this movie.
903;The way I see it, V represents pure artistic idea, the artist in all of us that wants to be freed (in some more than others).
904;What V focuses on changing (the political ideals of his country) is what most of you are saying the whole theme of the movie is"
905;"this has been a favorite movie of mine for several years
906;A movie about revolution, tryanny, justice and love.
907;One of my all time favorites.
908;Deep, vibrant color, crisp picture and solid blacks.
909;Hugo Weaving is mesmerizing, and Natalie Portman will have you convinced she's truly converted by the end of the picture.
910;Which makes it, dear friends, quite valid.
911;Our emotions are more true than our reason.
912;For the victim the price is personal.
913;This is a wonderful story about truth, exploring the justification of means, the nature of good and evil, and even the hope for the future.
914;The story satisfies our need to see fairness in the resolution of conflicts.
915;Though not all of these conflicts can be made my own, and some of the resolutions did not ring true,it is a soul pleaser at its core.
916;If you haven't seen it you got to check it out.
917;has some truths in it that you can't forget.
918;One of the best movies I've ever seen!
919;It has fast become my favorite movie and the special features are aboslutely amazing!
920;V for Vendetta is a 2005 action thriller film directed by James McTeigue and written by The Wachowski Brothers, based on the 1982 comic book of the same name by Alan Moore and David Lloyd.
921;future dystopian society, Hugo Weaving portrays V a bold, charismatic freedom fighter, attempting to ignite a revolution against the brutal fascist regime led by Adam Sutler (John Hurt) that has subjugated his country.
922;This excellent movie provides hope in a world systematically overrun by political deception.
923;Watch and study it closely to see why.
924;1% or 99%, everyone should enjoy this film.
925;One of my favorite movies of all time!
926;Everyone should see this movie!
927;best movie i ever watched,kept me captured every minute.
928;so,watch it today and u'll love it.
929;I found myself squirming in my seat waiting for the movie to get back on track.
930;It was a great movie when it first came out and it is even more relevant in today's political climate.
931;This is a terrific adaptation of the Comic series to a movie and a story line.
932;This movie makes one think past the wonderful story to the mirror being held to the face of the USA today.
933;Witty lines and a great but horrifying story keeps one entertained from start to finish.
934;It leaves you with hope that humans will make the correct choice in times of need and not be sheep to fear of a make believe superstition and made up holy books.
935;An excellently written and acted movie.
936;Natalie Portman does a very good job as Evey.
937;V for Vendetta is one of those films that transcends its source.
938;material and becomes a truly influential piece of work.
939;With astounding special effects, including a rousing climax when the Houses of Parliament is set on fire .
940;V FOR VENDETTA offers a chilling vision of what can happen to so. called 'democracies,' when individuals acquire too much power.
941;You see how crafty and deadly he has become in his attacks on government property, and you see how he slowly warps Natalie Portman's mind over the course of the film by convincing her that his cause his just and his approach is justified.
942;the movie is well done, and the acting is phenomenal, especially the guy who plays V.
943;V for Vendetta is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
944;Besides the action and great plot, this is one of the many things that I enjoyed about this movie.
945;Eventhough it's classified as fiction, one can plainly see the parrallel to what has happened to our freedom in the past 5 years.
946;Here is a stunningly elegant movie that is sure to grasp your attention.
947;be in the upper echelons of government had better take heed!Natalie Portman is gorgeous.
948;Heck, she even looks great bald.
949;She also has a lot of potential as an actress.
950;She is perfect as the dark hero's side.
951;Hugo Weaving is terrific as the vigilante.
952;The totalitarian paradigm of """"the ends justify the means of extreme government"""" is as alive and well today it has always been."""
953;This is a terrific movie, a parable of future history from a liberal viewpoint.
954;"however, the movie is the telling of how ""absolute power corrupts absolutely."""
955;With an incredibly strong performance by Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving and Stephen Rea, the movie tells of a fascist society that is shaken when a character known only as V blows up the Old Bailey Courthouse while the 1812 Overture plays loudly on the loudspeakers placed throughout the streets of London.
956;v and Evey are drawn to each other while Evie is at the same time repelled by him.
957;the end of the movie is truly stirring and brings to mind the revolutionary march scene from Les Miserables.
958;"To go back to the beginning of this review, the movie is a parable, and one that can be enjoyed even by people who don't like ""genre"" movies."
959;"a government which controls our minds and uses invasive laws to threaten our freedoms?Those who have a profoundly negative view of modern societies, sympathize largely with anarchists, and enjoyed seeing the White House blow up in ""Independence Day"" may enjoy this film."
960;still, I have many friends who see the U. s. government as somewhat like the government depicted in this movie.
961;This movie is naturally highly controvercial, thought provoking, and ironic.
962;Yet, don't let that scare you off if all you want to see is special effects, this is loaded with beautiful knife work.
963;A dictator has pulled England together, and a la' Big Brother, his will is law.
964;a woman swept up into V's life.
965;this movie is rich in historical and literary allusion the way the matrix was rich in philosophical allusion.
966;For that alone, it is a joy.
967;the list goes onThe action scenes are beautiful and rich.
968;Beautifully shot and moving at times.
969;hugo Weaving gives an amazing performance.
970;He somehow delivers an amazing range of emotions from behind a mask.
971;Great perfomances from a number of supporting cast membersCons1.
972;Superlatives aside, this movie is a must.
973;see for anyone who values their freedom.
974;in every way, this is a stunning production.
975;it all comes together with a film like this. . . . .
976;"Plus, it (should) make us all think
977;a magnificent production, I highly recommend it!
978;I have loved V for Vendetta for over 20 years.
979;Warrior was cancelled right at the end of the second Book.
980;v for Vendetta the comic is perhaps the best.
981;written, most emotionally affecting, heart.
982;breaking and involving piece of fiction I've ever read.
983;Let me make this clear: I'm a comic book fan.
984;(A good example would be the first Spider.
985;I **do** think you can fault changes from the source material when what was already there is infinitely better than what it was changed to.
986;For instance:Comic: The Voice of Fate is an eerie, disembodied radio personality.
987;Evey is an experiment for V. Because he believes that inside even a born victim exists a potential hero.
988;movie: Evey is feisty to start with.
989;just a bit of tweaking and it could have been great .
990;comic: Evey's first reaction to V is awe.
991;The expression artist David Lloyd puts on her face is rapt, almost mesmerized.
992;One of the creepier things about V for Vendetta is just how easily and instantly V pulls Evey into his world.
993;Where is the talented actress who showed such immense early promise in The Professional?
994;I truly got the sense, watching this film, its makers had no real insight beyond a surface level of what was actually happening in the comic, were absolutely clueless regarding the internal dynamics, the deeper issues, that made it great.
995;its a very base and bestial film that hides its true nature wrapped in eloquent British speech and supposedly high ideals.
996;hatred and violence is shown in such a casual way in this film that it offers an easy seduction.
997;The director focuses more on making it all arty and pretty.
998;All politics aside the film was entertaining and very well acted.
999;All the characters were very rich deep and complex often having a positive side and a negative like real people.
1000;This was an excellent movie, I can honestly say I have never seen a movie like it.
1001;This movie is good, great infact!
1002;simply put, the story is a romanticized view of a lone hero set out toward opening the minds of his fellow English brothers and sisters oppressed by a fascist government gone crazy.
1003;the most interesting aspect of the movie, was in how realistic the future painted is, to the life and society we live in today.
1004;This movie leaves you with the same message the first MATRIX movie (another triumph by the way) left many with.
1005;Great movie but not as great as the comic, I loved the bonus material
1006;Video and audio, and effects were outstanding.
1007;Add this one to your collection.
1008;Produced and written by the Wachowski Brothers in their signature """"Matrix"""" style and directed by their protege James McTeigue, the movie has a wildly inventive premise that despite its twenty.year old origins has a timely relevance in a post.9/11 world."""
1009;this apocalyptic movie dares to ask the question of whether terrorism is ever justified, and the filmmakers go about making V a scarifying but ultimately sympathetic figure.
1010;"Part of the problem is simply scope because the movie's agenda feels so broad as to make some of the elements feel trivial, in particular, the ""Beauty and the Beast""."
1011;Phantom of the Opera connection between V and Evey.
1012;on the other hand, certain passages work quite well, such as the brutalizing sequence when Evey is incarcerated and she starts to read a series of notes from a prisoner named Valerie, who has been executed for being a lesbian.
1013;There are also welcome bits of humor, for example, Evey dressed in one scene as a little girl to gain the trust of a bishop critical in allowing one of V's attacks to occur, and the Benny Hill antics on Dietrich's TV show meant to ridicule both V and Sutler.
1014;With a convincing British accent, Natalie Portman is solid as Evey as she shows both her adventurous and vulnerable sides with equal aplomb.
1015;Stephen Rea makes a subtle Inspector Finch, while Stephen Fry uses his dry comic manner to good effect as Dietrich.
1016;The movie runs a bit long at 132 minutes, but it is relentlessly creative filmmaking.
1017;V for Vendetta is a great story, reminding us of just why governments should never be trusted with absolute power.
1018;i would really love to see Zach Snyder bring his touch to this story though, he did an amazing job with WATCHMEN.
1019;but the Wachovski brothers did a respectable job.
1020;Being of fan of the Matrix movies and the Wachowski brothers, I was anxious to see this movie.
1021;I was very impressed with the style that they created for it.
1022;They actually did a pretty good job not detracting from the real message within the movie.
1023;It was crisp, the music was enthralling and demanding.
1024;It moved fluidly, the cinematography was excellent, and I loved the soundtrack.
1025;The actors themselves are perfect for the role .
1026;you actually start believing they are who they portray.
1027;I thought it a nice touch to see John Hurt in the role of Chancellor .
1028;The disc itself was in great condition with only a single fingerprint or two.
1029;There is a long scratch on the front of it that covers one of the actors' names and completely rips the cover page beneath it.
1030;the movie is in great condition.
1031;Great cast, and a well told story throughout.
1032;Great movie I really enjoyed it.
1033;V is a great onscreen character.
1034;The supporting characters are also great with solid performances throughtout.
1035;"People who liked ""1984"" will love this film
1036;The actors did a good job, especially Hugo Weaving.
1037;a very good movie btw).
1038;Governments do that well enough without being influenced by a film.
1039;like I said, view it with an open mind and perhaps you'll appreciate it.
1040;I loved this movie, his words are inspiring.
1041;This is a very good movie about a bold charismatic freedom fighter driven to exact revenge on those who disfigured him.
1042;It is a very good movie.
1043;A friend of mine wanted to see this movie in the theater and I had no idea what it was about.
1044;it's a lot of fun to watch too .
1045;great acting, great action, great dialog and so many characters who draw you into the story.
1046;this movie uses lies to tell the truth .
1047;It kept my attention the entire time.
1048;The actors portrayed their characters in a way that made you feel as if you were watching reality as opposed to entertainment.
1049;great entertainment on all fronts in this movie.
1050;This movie is well acted, well written and certainly a thinking person's movie.
1051;Suppression, and religious freedom are the issues.
1052;It can be viewed as a movie questioning the existing order, doing something about it, and gaining the upper hand.
1053;I loved the graphic novel, and now I can share this powerful, dark and insightful story with all my friends and relatives who don't read comic books.
1054;I think that Hugo Weaving projected the essence of V brilliantly, and I applaud the bravery of the director and producers for keeping the mask on, as it was meant to be.
1055;i enjoyed this film a bit.
1056;The action sequences and the storyline kept me on the edge of my seat.
1057;I loved listening to Hugo Weaving speak through the mask so eloquently.
1058;I loved the diversity in the music which ranged from orchestral to modern day indie pop (Cat Power).
1059;I thought some scenes tended to drag on longer than they should have been but overall I enjoyed """"V for Vendetta"""" as a whole."""
1060;V for Vendetta has become among my favorite films of all time.
1061;V is the most interesting, mysterious and complex character I've seen in a movie in quite some time, even if we sometimes question his actions.
1062;Everything about this movie works IMO.
1063;acted, dark, intriguing and intelligent.
1064;this is a fine piece of filmmaking.
1065;I highly recommend investing the extra $ and getting the 2.
1066;The section on the history of Guy Fawkes is worth the price of admission.
1067;"Place the ""V"" cursor on the ""Cat Power Montage"" option and press Up."
1068;If done correctly, the image of the pair of wings at the top will turn black.
1069;The original Graphic novel this was based on is one of the smartest and best stories written last century.
1070;Pros: Action packed, Thought provokingCons: Tackles mature themes (torture)It is a great time of year to watch this movie.
1071;They masterfully weave a tale of rebellion focusing on two protagonists.
1072;This film does a really good job of developing the characters and moving the plot forward at the same time.
1073;The dialogue is incredible .
1074;V has some of the wittiest and thought provoking lines/speeches I have heard in any movie.
1075;This film is great for people who enjoy movies that make you think.
1076;My wife doesn't really enjoy watching it.
1077;This movie is fairly intense so be sure you are up for that before you start it.
1078;i enjoy this movie so much and I try to watch it every year around November the 5th.
1079;While watching this movie you will realize that V stands for an idea and the idea will be very clear by the final scene.
1080;I love the ideas presented in this movie .
1081;that is why I watch it again and again.
1082;It starts slightly slow, but it is a really good story.
1083;Interesting plot and the ending is pretty wild.
1084;Freedom is a must, and people do have to care to make a change.
1085;anti freedom as any other lover of freedom and humantiy, but just because a movie features action and some guy fighting for freedom, does not make it a great movie.
1086;Provides a nice release to rebel.
1087;Keep alert and educate yourself on the God.
1088;given right of personal freedom.
1089;mind, this movie shouldn't bother you, and you may find a new favorite movie of your own.
1090;I loved the fact that Amazon lets you stream it for 48 hours while waiting for the actual blu.
1091;I streamed it twice thru my blu.
1092;Great movie, even better message.
1093;I'm very glad to see so many positive reviews for this movie.
1094;V For Vendetta is simply an amazing movie.
1095;V For Vendetta is spectacular in every possible way.
1096;From the first scene to the last, the movie is completely gripping and you will not want to look away until the end credits roll.
1097;written, well directed and well acted.
1098;Everything about it is top.
1099;The movie is so beautifully and effortlessly directed that you'd assume there must be some seasoned veteran behind the camera.
1100;It has a few action scenes here and there (particularly one Matrix.
1101;For once we have a comic book movie that is about characters, story and ideas rather than special effects and car chases and fight sequences.
1102;The actors are great too.
1103;The large, primarily British cast is uniformly excellent.
1104;Particularly worth mentioning is Hugo Weaving (best known as Agent Smith in The Matrix).
1105;Weaving gives an excellent performance in the movie despite having his face always hidden by a mask.
1106;That is the challenge and Hugo succeeds marvelously.
1107;The original Matrix was a good film.
1108;What made the original Matrix a good film was that it took an interesting idea and dressed it up in a stylish package without trying to be too pretentious or revealing too much.
1109;In themselves, they are interesting.
1110;Great movie everyone should see it really makes you think about life and ask questions you wouldn't normally ask yourself or about the world
1111;But a very interesting plot and premise.
1112;Good story about an idea and trying to make a difference.
1113;I am not a fan of super heroes at all but I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've seen lately.
1114;this story, like a good book, evolves on the screen.
1115;It unfolds and strikes purpose into the hearts, minds, and spirits of many people who have watched it.
1116;And our minds were thankfully melted in a moment of sheer nostalgia grace.
1117;This movie has a life of its own!
1118;It breathes heart and sheds tears in your soul.
1119;The perfect movie of 2006 has finally arrived, knocking on the door in the famous V persona with a rose to greet us all with.
1120;It has a deeper meaning and an even deeper plotline.
1121;layered with symbols, history, operatic, and sometimes funny, scenes all mixed together in a tapestry of hope.
1122;the begining, middle, and ending were perfect in every way.
1123;take this into perspective: Everyone knows that there are numerous superheroes, correct?
1124;each frame is like a comic.
1125;And so, on an ending note, let it be known that I could compliment this movie in explosive detail.
1126;You had a good run on very awsome movies that came out in the couple of years before and after this one.
1127;I feel that is well written and dirtected.
1128;This movie has an almost occult like following me personally I just thought it was a great action movie with some very interesting characters, good acting, and a well developed story line!
1129;A must see for anyone that likes action and hero type movies.
1130;I liked the way they sent this product, it was protected very nicely and was at my door few days after ordering.
1131;I will be ordering again.
1132;This movie is spot on, in regards to the book.
1133;As I expected, great shape and plays great.
1134;i enjoy this movie, it is very moving to watch with the family
1135;The symbol of the new regime is the double.
1136;the powerful men in the country all made their money from drug companies.
1137;now this is a very good movie about revolutionary zeal in the face of oppression and I recommend it but I have strong intellectual reservations.
1138;"as if blowing up England's Parliament, the movie's spectacular climax, means that ""we the people"" will have more power when in fact without the parliaments of the world, ""we the people"" usually get our buttocks kicked."
1139;in spite of all my objections, this is a stirring movie.
1140;One of the best movies of all time and perhaps released at just the right time.
1141;i think it is even better than the graphic novel and that is high praise indeed from me.
1142;It pulled at my heart strings, it made my heart beat quicker with action, it had a certain romance about it, and in these strange times of government power grabs it made me stop and think about the world that is being created by our politicians today.
1143;These things are worth thinking about while you enjoy this wonderful film.
1144;This is an awesome movie, based on a true story, only the original outcome for Guy Faux wasn't quite so spectacular, It COULD have been, but they found the expolosives back then.
1145;I thought this was an incredibly entertaining movie with an extremely relevant message, especially considering the nature of American politics.
1146;this movie is my favorite to say the least,it is loaded with action.
1147;Stop giving away our rights!
1148;One of the best movies out there and not a bad price I order more then one movie to save on shipping.
1149;I absolutely loved this movie it was a look at what could happen if people sacrifice freedom for what they perceive to be safety.
1150;But overall this is a very solid film.
1151;style England manages to come through as both chilling and timely.
1152;This is a good movie, it shows what can happen when you have a dictator in charge and you have no rights or freedoms to do as you like, good example of what is happening to our country at this time!!!!
1153;So here it is: 'V for Vendetta' is a sharp, good.
1154;looking and solidly crafted, I dunno, action.
1155;It's far from 100% faithful to the comic, but it's closer than I'd anticipated, and manages to par things down into a more cohesive narrative.
1156;Still, some good stuff is lost.
1157;"The action scenes are generally nicely done
1158;The film looks great, creating a plausible near.
1159;Performances are solid all around, with particular kudos going to Weaving as V. He's most notable for the fact that his character is simply believable and not utterly ridiculous.
1160;The rest of the cast are character actor types, and they're all fine.
1161;I liked him, so it worked, I guess.
1162;An entertaining, sometimes enthralling film.
1163;It's not as smart or deep as it thinks it is, or as some will tell you, but it's smarter than most major films, I suppose, and is always watchable, which is what really matters.
1164;fILMThe film is an acute and welcome departure from the Matrix excesses.
1165;Editing is quite good, especially during the historical background montage scenes.
1166;The pacing of the movie is excellent.
1167;The photography and direction during some of the Evey/V dialogues are also very good.
1168;the CGI effects, so ubiquitous in the Matrix films, are kept to a minimum, to good effect.
1169;the sound track is an excellent complement to the visuals.
1170;Very atmospheric as well as dramatic, it supports the momentum of the film.
1171;The liberties with Tchaikovsky work well and structurally these scenes bookend the film.
1172;what really makes the story line work is the acting.
1173;Having an excellent ensemble of actors for these parts is a real treat, especially Robert Allam's Prothero, John Standing's Lilliman and Sinead Cusack's very touching Delia Surridge.
1174;John Hurt is very fine and Stephen Rea does an excellent job of keeping the development on track.
1175;natalie Portman's Evey is solidly good, but not extraordinary in my view.
1176;The affected English accent wobbles a bit between parts of England and occasionally crosses borders.
1177;It works and her performance during that scene works well, if you keep in mind she was born and raised in Israel.
1178;Lastly, she does a good job of evolving from a more childlike innocent in the beginning of the film, to a much more seasoned character by the end.
1179;Weaving's voice is one of his strongest tools as he demonstrated as Agent Smith in the Matrix series.
1180;dimensionality of that role is dispensed with in V. With material from Shakespeare and uniformly well written dialogue, he has ample opportunity to display his mellifluous range.
1181;Volumes are spoken sometimes with the fewest words as in one incredibly atmospheric scene (D: """"Is it meaningless to apologize?"""""""
1182;The body language and mannerisms work tremendously well with the voice.
1183;(Terrific costume conception, i. e. hat, wig and cape.)
1184;The voice, body language and the mask create a unique character.
1185;A very interesting aspect of the mask, the other side of it hiding meaning in the dialogue, is that allows for ambiguity.
1186;A facial expression often explains a statement, but this makes V the more enigmatic.
1187;The mask also makes V iconic and more than human, an idea or ideal.
1188;V, in his last scene has the same appearance as always, and we think of him as unchanged.
1189;Both are clearly in the film.
1190;an interesting observation on Yahoo reviews.
1191;over, and a super hero emerges to restore the people's power and goodness!
1192;One of the best films in years, would be a pity to miss this.
1193;great acting, beautiful cinematography, expert direction, and a gripping story make v for vendetta a classic.
1194;"natalie portman gives a great performance (its ""closer"" natalie portman, not ""star wars"" natalie portman), and hugo weaver is amazing."
1195;he portrays so much emotion without ever showing you his face.
1196;it's a wonderful directorial debut for james mcteigue (who was the assistant director for many movies such as the matrix trilogy), and the wachowski brothers know how to write a story.
1197;its one of the best graphic novel adaptations i've seen.
1198;all in all, its a great movie to own.
1199;Some of the original plot elements have been rewritten but on the whole this follows the book cloesely and works very well.
1200;Not many actors would undertake the anonymous part and put in such an inspired performance.
1201;Natalie Portman, beautiful and skillful as always, makes you forget that her character was originally only 15.
1202;All in all, a fabulous, visually stunning movie.
1203;Very good and exciting movie!
1204;A little bit of a psychological thriller.
1205;That's how timely it is.
1206;Along the way he befriends a young woman .
1207;v for Vendetta is a very British film and that is a good thing.
1208;The cast is very British and very well schooled in their craft as character actors.
1209;As a result, the film is exciting, clean, crisp, and invigorating when it should be and dramatic and engaging when it should be.
1210;the script is tight and well written.
1211;well, it's amazing how timely it truly is.
1212;v is the ultimate anti.
1213;James McTeigue paved the way for an outstanding feature with far too little recognition for what it represents.You do not have to be an activist or part of the underground intelligencia to enjoy this film, but most certainly you will enjoy it more if you understand the message.
1214;Through its action, its clever use of cunning dialogue, and its pro.
1215;humanist message, practically anyone can get behind this modern day Zorro.
1216;sourced cooperation for the greater good, and to prevent the few from ruling the many.
1217;Good movie with an incredible story.
1218;Suprisingly good action as well.
1219;Sounds great with surround sound.
1220;Wanted more from the extra content.
1221;Missed this one in the theater and it finally came up in the Netflix queue.
1222;As seems to be the case with movies made from graphic novels these days, the filmmakers did a great job of capturing the visual style of the comic while not necessarily retaining the story or underlying meaning.
1223;This was even more egregious in this case, where V is portrayed as a heroic figure whose victimization justifies the means by which he extracts his revenge with the added bonus of freeing the enslaved citizens of a nation.
1224;One of the most unexpectedly pleasant movie surprises I've had this year was the Wachowski Brothers' brilliant screen adaptation of the DC Comics graphic novel, V For Vendetta.
1225;V is a terrorist who has a vendetta with an agenda, which is what makes this such a fascinating film.
1226;"You see, ""V"" is a sympathetic terrorist."
1227;as I noted above, there are so many great lines of dialogue in this movie.
1228;Beneath this mask lies an idea, and ideas are bulletproof.
1229;Though cleverly disguised as a popcorn action picture, V For Vendetta is a movie that makes you think.
1230;v For Vendetta is a thinking man's action picture.
1231;I loved this movie in the theatres and I loved watching it at home.
1232;If you looking for a amazing swordsman with a strange past this is a great movie to watch.
1233;So relevant to this day.
1234;The actors are absolutely fantastic and talented.
1235;This movie will change your mood and maybe even your life.
1236;It will keep you entertained from start to finish.
1237;It is also very well acted with a decent cast.
1238;V for Vendetta is not revolutionary, politically insightful or particularly original, despite the praise it's gotten.
1239;"powerful ""Chancellor"" and a media that's entirely government."
1240;And the director goes to great lengths to show us the horrors of British dentistry, especially when it comes to the bad guys.
1241;like state is certainly not new ground for movies, so the twist is V himself .
1242;day England and the people seem to be having a good time .
1243;And while the story goes to great lengths to show V as a feared .
1244;while the parallels to today's world problems are facile, the acting is strong and the action plays out in a satisfying way.
1245;fi flick, but genuinely convincing .
1246;"His performance was reminiscent of Edward Norton's masked king in ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" except Alan Moore's story gives Weaving more to work with, and Weaving handles it perfectly."
1247;overall, this film is a lot of fun as a sci.
1248;"V for Vendetta was an amazing movie
1249;I saw it around seven times in the theater and bought it the day it came out.
1250;It is an action movie at its core and the action and drama are amazing.
1251;There is a moral and there is a story, but it is more anti.
1252;don't listen to anybody who tells you that it is bashing Republicans in America"
1253;Nevertheless, and make no mistake about it, this is movie making of the highest order, combining all the finest elements of great storytelling into a potent roller coaster of a movie filled with great action,intellect and above all, ideas.
1254;"american"" but there is also an earnestness here that will resonate strongly, and perhaps, frighteningly, to many viewers who will not fail to see the correlation between this fictional tale and the way the world we live in works."
1255;and it's better looking as a result.
1256;"i truly believe that many who see ""V"" will be upset by it, but hopefully more of us will be inspired by its bold, blatant message and take a good hard look at ourselves and the way the world works around us and see that, with sacrifice and thoughtfulness, the world can be changed."
1257;gives a performance that can only be described as mesmerizing.
1258;"As ""V"" he exposes all of the strength and weakness of a character that is equal parts savior and villain."
1259;the physical production is beautiful in its realism as it paints a nightmarish world of the not.
1260;distant future (2020) and is chilling in its depiction of governmental power, socio.
1261;"Weaving's ""V"" challenges, and ultimately changes all of that, as he quickly unravels the fabric of civilized society, capturing the public with his bold ideas ."
1262;This is film making at its emotional and challenging best.
1263;"Of course there are, but ultimately ""V for Vendetta"" rises far above them in its presentation of a world filled with ideas that have forever been debated, and does it in a story well told, beautifully acted and full of hope for humankind."
1264;James McTeigue has directed this Wachowski Brothers adaptation of Alan Moore's comic book into a story that is intelligent, frightening, spectacularly produced and acted and the result is a fable for our minds to consider.
1265;The time is 2020 and England rules in a totalitarian manner, its greatest enemy, the United States, has self destructed, and the government controls the lives and thoughts of the British citizenry.
1266;well crafted films such as this serve the public well: sometimes it takes a visual depiction of the 'comic book look' of government officials to make us more sensitized to the direction we could be taking.
1267;It is an entertaining, fine movie .
1268;V for Vendetta's premise is somewhat simple to understand at first.
1269;Yes the story is grand and very well orchestrated and incredibly thought provoking.
1270;The title character V who is played to perfection by Hugo Weaving does a fantastic and memorable job portraying the masked revolutionary with his articulate language and firm belief that change must happen through any means necessary.
1271;Natalie Portman, though the painful memories of her playing Padme linger, manages to give a solid performance as Evey who ends up intertwined with V and his actions and is constantly at odds with herself as to whether what V is doing can be justified.
1272;Now what would a Wachowski brother's film be like without terrific action and slick special effects.
1273;V for Vendetta delivers big time in this department with terrific explosions and sensational fighting sequences that are brilliantly executed and an absolute blast to watch.
1274;The last one in particular truly is something to behold.
1275;One other cool aspect of the movie is how V's message spreads throughout the citizen's of England and how they are constantly getting closer and closer to going over the top and how much they want and believe in V's promise of freedom from repression.
1276;Overall V for Vendetta is an excellent movie with superb action sequences and a tantalizing story that could make you question your own beliefs.
1277;It should be viewed with an open mind.
1278;Vendetta is not by any means perfect but it thoroughly is a fantastic viewing experience that should not be missed.
1279;ray Steelbook]Everyone knows how great the movie is, what i am going too talk about is the audio and video presentation which is amazing!!
1280;Video is crisp and sharp with no dnr too be found, which can sometimes be hard to obtain in a dark film, and this is a very dark film as a whole.
1281;Their is some very demo worthy material in here, just turn it up and select the chapter where big ben blows up and you will impress all your friends.
1282;ray is wonderful and adds even more to an already amazing film.
1283;Whatever your political affiliation or walk of life, this movie can speak to you.
1284;The steelbook edition look great on the shelf and adds that extra touch.
1285;I liked the graphic novel.
1286;watched this, thinking I had enjoyed it somewhat the first time, and it was much less impressive than I remembered.
1287;"so this movie is a kind of ""opposite day"" in spades."
1288;The gay lifestyle is celebrated in the West.
1289;darwin connection is historically unassailable.)
1290;Indeed, to enjoy this movie, you have to purge your head of these realities.
1291;It hits you over the head in ham.
1292;In their earnestness, the writers forgot to excise the pro.2nd Amendment message .
1293;think on this, even if you loved this movie.
1294;the rest of this movie is self.
1295;In fact, it is one big political statement!
1296;I had the impression that the writers' message was more important than the story itself.
1297;"Movies like ""American President"" entertain first and make political statements second."
1298;It'll make you feel good, since it's a movie about how evil Conservatives are.
1299;so I'll say that Nat is great as usual too.
1300;Other than that it was very unique and original and a good use of time.
1301;Being a comic fan, I feel ashamed to say I never read the comic.
1302;It was well worth the wait.
1303;The story was good and seeing it, even though sometimes movies dont do justice to novels or books, is definately a must for all.
1304;The lenticular part is pretty cool.
1305;cheers, and I hope this helps.
1306;So I answered the door, and it was a messenger.
1307;So I entered my house, put the package on a coffee table, and forgot it 'till the very next day.
1308;And the very next day I remembered the package.
1309;So I made Pallas to wear V's mask, and then I enjoyed the movie.
1310;The second disc includes the making of V, interviews and a lot of stuff, while the movie itself, widescreen, has three languages for audio and closed captioning (French, English and Spanish) allowing me to practice two languages and still enjoy it in my mother tongue.
1311;Definetely worth the while and also a great movie too!
1312;This film is based upon an old DC Comics theme and the screenplay is by the Wachowski Brothers, known for their Matrix series and others.
1313;It builds upon one of the least recognized and least understood political concepts, being the power of the people and in a theatric way promotes revolution of the masses.
1314;Thus, I highly recommend this film.
1315;This is an adventure/fantasy movie which tells the story of a hero with a strict moral code of ethics and the strength of character and fearlessness to challenge the oppressive powers that be.
1316;Thought provoking and inspiring, this movie kept my attention as it unraveled.
1317;I enjoyed watching the protagonist wage his personal war against those who tortured he and others in their grand experiment which led to supreme dominion over the masses.
1318;Watch the movie to find out what it really means!
1319;V is blaming his own government.
1320;Imagine that the blacks won in our fictional Mississippian Revolution, and expelled the whites.
1321;the most incredible moment in the film is the speech V gives when he takes over a state.
1322;time TV, it gets right to the point.
1323;The film's hopeful message that tyrannical governments fall under their own weight, great acting performances and great cinematography make V For Vendetta a winner.
1324;this is one of my family's favorite movies.
1325;It's exciting and it's stirring.
1326;Superbly filmed and acted, but then it had an amazing graphic novel to follow.
1327;"(extra #1)Daniel McTeigue, director: ""I think it's a political thriller, first and foremost."
1328;"It's a very good ethical point, because as we all know, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."""
1329;He wants the populace to stir themselves, stand up for themselves, and take their government back.
1330;Subtitles available in English, French and Spanish.2.
1331;"oriented company says: ""V for Vendetta is in a class of its own."
1332;It's a brilliant piece of work.
1333;They laugh as they show the truth in your face.
1334;The first half of this film has a great intelligent flow in terms of acting, dialogues, screenplay and background music.
1335;I loved V's introduction to the film and his dialogue delivery was very intriguing.
1336;Natalie Portman does a good job and she's proved her multidimensional side.
1337;The best scenes in the film are the ones where Natalie Portman gets a letter which she reads out and the writers' story of life is relived.
1338;definitely worth a watch in the theater.
1339;I liked this film more than the newspapers said I would and more than most people did.
1340;Not only was the story intricate and engaging, the acting intense and convincing, the characters sympathetic and human, but the subtext of the film was unbelievable.
1341;"at several points throughout the film my jaw dropped and I thought, ""Did they just say what I thought they said?"""
1342;"I even had a moment of delusional optimism: ""Maybe people will GET it!"
1343;leaving the theater I overheard a man talking with his son.
1344;It was a good movie, he said.
1345;How could a human see the movie and come away with such a pusillanimous and lily.
1346;"skulledness"" can misinterpret the line, ""artists use lies to tell the truth, while politicians use them to cover the truth up."""
1347;If believing two contradictory pieces of information at the same time can prevent one from accepting an uncomfortable truth, our subconscious is more than willing to give us a hand.
1348;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
1349;It is right on the mark with what's going on in the world right now, from the government control of the media down to the fear they impose on their citizens in the name of security.
1350;It's a great move for people who have the eye's to see what's really going on.
1351;This is a classic film, deserving of all the accolades and none of its critiques.
1352;"Yes, it thinly criticizes the existing fascist state in America and in effect tells us, ""See what you're headed for."""
1353;But it gives us hope that a few brave people can shake the sheep out of their bleating complacency and actually stop letting manufactured false fear be their true dictator.
1354;This is a stylish movie with memorable performances and visual imagery, coupled with cracking dialogue and resonating with verve and energy.
1355;This is the fourth copy I've bought to give as gifts.
1356;If you love Liberty, you'll like this movie.
1357;It was really interesting and I liked the action.
1358;if you haven't seen this movie, see it.
1359;Amazingly filmed and a real pleasure to watch.
1360;the acting, the camera, the script, they all are almost perfect.
1361;it became one of my best movie instantly.
1362;I watched this movie after seeing Natalie Portman in Black Swan, I didn't expect to like it because I'm not a big science fiction fan, but I thought it was hugely entertaining.
1363;Natalie Portman was really great in a role of a young woman who gets caught up in events much bigger than she ever imagined, and who goes through a grueling personal journey of discovery.
1364;I think she's the best actress of her generation.
1365;And the V character is very engaging despite not ever seeing his face.
1366;I don't know the actor but he did a very compelling job.
1367;best film of the year!
1368;The product is fine, the movie is a favorite of mine and I enjoy it.
1369;"This smart plot combined clever and timely the ancestral legend of the Phantom Opera, the famous Count of Monte Christ, and through a wise game of crossed words and an admirable use of the semiotic, produced an underworld hero, ""V"" ."
1370;rounded film that will reward even the most exigent of the spectators.
1371;"I loved V, I would classify it as a thriller and a ""what if""."
1372;I also really enjoyed the message of freedom and the power of ideas that were throughout this tale.
1373;Congratulations to the Director and actors on making a visually stunning and interesting film akin to 1984 by Huxley.
1374;Portman is stunning even bald.
1375;He wears the mask through the entire film and the emotion he portrays using various methods is a total credit to his phenomenal talent as an actor.
1376;I truly fell in love with V. natalie Portman is magnificent as well.
1377;She is so beautiful and a natural actress.
1378;Her performance, particularly her interactions with V, are absolutely beguiling.
1379;And I must agree with the aforementioned poster.
1380;He wove you into his pain and the love he had for Evey.
1381;Both are a most underestimated actors.
1382;He picks up a girl (Portman) and teaches her how to face her fears until true courage emerges from the depths of despair.
1383;in here there is a message to the young that is very appealing and I guess why the movie is so popular for the young (Note.
1384;so if you are doing a cinema forum investigating how modern freedom is being lost and want some ignition fuel, this can be a good idea.
1385;When I first saw the title, I thought this movie was about someone avenging someone else.
1386;Second, the film takes a hard look at the world as it may come to pass, a world where individuals set aside freedom in the name of security and peace.
1387;It's big brother for the twenty first century, and it's chilling.
1388;seeing this big brother government of the twenty first century is chilling.
1389;Yet it's a fascinating look at what may happen.
1390;The movie is a fascinating study into how fear will make people do crazy things to feel safe again (such as elect power hungry maniacs who promise peace).
1391;vFV is very deep on many levels.
1392;When you see it the first time, you can tell that there's a lot here, yet you only get a glimpse at it.
1393;When you see it a second time, you get a better grasp of the messages being put forth, yet there is still more to see and more to discover.
1394;There's even a great idea behind V's mask and his face, but i'll let you figure that one out for yourself (it's fantastic, I will say that much).
1395;arguably the best part of the entire film is V himself.
1396;Not since Hellboy has the silver screen seen such a fascinating comic book charachter come to life.
1397;V is intriguing, a very polite gentleman (when he's not out killing people), a fan of movies, a good cook (very amusing scene by the way), and always has that oh.
1398;so charming smile on his face (granted it's a mask, but it works so well).
1399;He can be both a freedom fighter and a terrorist, depending upon how you see his actions.
1400;With his charming personality, black cape, black hat and that awesome mask, V is an utterly fascinating charachter who is a delight to watch.
1401;the movie even touches upon the subjects of religion and homosexuality in a way that can best be described as creepy.
1402;well, i'll let you see for yourself.
1403;It is my hope that this world does not descend to this level of barbaric cruelty.
1404;This is a movie about ideas (this is one of the main themes) and how ideas affect people.
1405;There's also some very cool shots of huge crowds at the climax, though i'll let you see that for yourself.
1406;There's a fantastic moment where V cooks breakfast for Evey, and there's an absoloutly hilarious TV special halfway through the movie that had me laughing in the theater.
1407;It's so funny that it would be a crime to reveal what it is, so i'll let you find out for yourself.
1408;It's a very thought provoking movie, one that is chillingly familiar to those of us living in this age of homeland security and the conflict with terrorism.
1409;I was told this was an amazing movie by my friends and decided to give it a go.
1410;This movie is amazing and I was really impressed with how fast the shipping was!
1411;Much more hilarious than Thank You for Smoking.
1412;"V is a refined man of culture (after all, who doesn't enjoy hearing Julie London sing ""Cry Me a River""?)"
1413;back shock of hair reminiscent of a certain Austrian corporal we all know and love.
1414;V sure moves pretty fast and furious for someone who's suffered one.
1415;Through another subtle plot twist.
1416;v manages to sweep her up as his innocent accomplice.
1417;Rather, this schizophrenic action pic is a pastiche of at least a dozen works far greater than itself.
1418;The film snitches from cinematic styles and genres, too.
1419;ivory cinematography from the 1920s.
1420;In his televised appeal to the people, he lays the blame for their loss of liberty where it properly belongs, at their own feet.
1421;Thus we are brought to V's conclusion: By destroying the betrayed institutions of democracy, somehow, the people will regain their freedom.
1422;Other than that its great, lots of features good presentation and its a great movie to which is the most important part i def.
1423;I don't even know how to describe it: like when you are scared and crouched on a dark cold corner and this feeling comes to straighten you up and shine warmth through you as you stand your height.
1424;A man with conscience to come along, who will be able to See the situation objectively.
1425;Very pertinent to this day and time.
1426;I loved the movie the first time I saw it and now i can rewatch it anytime.
1427;The plot and artistic cinematography were superb.
1428;Great story, loved the movie theme.
1429;The director did a great job with picture.
1430;The purpose of democracy is to protect freedom, not restrict it, and this movie shows how a culture can decay when freedom is traded for safety.
1431;by the way, I'm a born again Christian who's secure enough in his faith not to be offended by the portrayal of faith in this film.
1432;great movie, Natalie Portman is perfect, great performance and great beauty.
1433;great music, original story, with action sequences very well done.
1434;its a great movie and a great gift.
1435;he loved it and I would recommend it.
1436;Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but I loved it.
1437;if you care about dialogs, you'll love this movie.
1438;The main character was quite interesting (V).
1439;if you're looking for an Oscar winner, look someplace else, but if you want a solid entertainment for 2 hours, get this movie.
1440;Huge fan of the movie and even more importantly the message behind it.
1441;Very applicable to what's going on in the U. s. now.
1442;wow hollywood can still produce a good movie.
1443;This is worth every penny.
1444;the cinematography is amazing the film is in depth.
1445;the characters are so believable.
1446;This is an awesome piece of work.
1447;the awakening of a nation to the horrors a government like that can inflict on its nation .
1448;So what does this film bring us that is new ?
1449;A real change is possible when and only when the people starts moving, and the people will move if you provide them with some hope by destroying a few symbolic milestones in their everyday political landscape.
1450;And imagine the armed forces of such an absolutely fascistic regime not firing at the crowd that is coming unarmed and numerous.
1451;Yet the film is interesting and both thrilling and entertaining.
1452;Fascism can take over but it is always .
1453;But to revive Guy Fawkes is a real fine idea.
1454;He is so British, so English, so cute and quaint.
1455;He is a real friend that we may meet at any street corner of our mind or imagination.
1456;we must wake up and take our destiny in our hand.
1457;The movie is pretty similar to the book.
1458;I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would have.
1459;I thought V was a very good character and Hugo Weaving did a great job of portraying him on screen.
1460;The story in this movie is very interesting and thought provoking.
1461;It kind of parallels the way our societies have been moving lately with powerful governments and correuption.
1462;A good story can be told without so much blood.
1463;Amazing, Wondefull and exciting a great film.
1464;The film is amazing the story is great from beggin to end, it will have you on the edge of your seat.
1465;The acting is great and the directing is outstanding.
1466;One of the best films of 2006.
1467;The movie is an interesting take on George Orwell's classic 1984 , but what is more interesting is this movies place in pop culture.
1468;Hard to understand the meaning of the movie at first and how V came to be, but it is a good action thriller.
1469;V for Vendetta is one of the all time best movies ever made.
1470;Beautifully made, exxxcellent story, thought provoking, outstanding cast.
1471;I haven't read the graphic novel (though I should) but the film is a masterpiece of execution, bringing together a tightly.
1472;knitted plot, a tremendous cast of actors and some truly memorable visuals.
1473;V is a cinematic giant that transcends the melodramatic elements that dog many comic book adaptations, and manages to tread the line of raising complex political issues while capably keeping the audience in suspense every step of way.
1474;"the main character, ""V"", is a model for every citizen ."
1475;he stands for ideas with a steadfast motivation that's both simple and admirable, against a backdrop of a totalitarian Great Britain as a portent of things to come.
1476;V is a fine example of mode.
1477;type, since he never takes off his mask, and is all the more powerful for that.
1478;It's remarkable how Hugo Weaving manages to convey the entire character without the audience ever seeing his face.
1479;Similarly, Natalie Portman is perfect in her role as a scared citizen who overcomes her fear of the system and develops a sense of true freedom.
1480;it's a great movie that's as important as it is well.
1481;It also has a phenomenal soundtrack from Dario Marianelli that just lifts the soul and underscores the transformative and inspirational message of the film.
1482;Before I begin, let me tell you that I WORSHIP this comic series.
1483;This is the best comic series that has ever been.
1484;The tale is the best example of fiction writing in any category.
1485;The writing is supremely intelligent, caustic, incendiary, touching, challenging, disturbing and witty.
1486;and the film leaves you wanting.
1487;I will, however, go into my criticisms of the film.
1488;Watch the film, then read the graphic novel.
1489;And you'll know what I'm talking about.
1490;Must pay close attention to the story line, but eventually it does make sense.
1491;This movie is the best movie I have ever watched, and ever will watch.
1492;It will confuse you, but you can always rewind!
1493;She is late and the yellow.
1494;Now a hero, he aquaints himself with Evey.
1495;He does have some good taste.
1496;"He likes to play ""Cry Me A River"" performed by Julie London (Emergency tv series)."
1497;disc One: Special Features: Freedom Forever!
1498;Mr. Smith is one awesome actor.
1499;Interesting that he hooks up with the Wachowski brothers again.
1500;Given a good premise and real character development she soars in V.
1501;This is because she has real actors to play against and well written script.
1502;also contributing to cause it John Hurt and a truly wonderful score.
1503;The lighting has to do double duty as it has to help Weaving express the correct emotion.
1504;No it is that one person in a Guy Faulks mask pulls a somnolent public back to a freedom loving mass of citizenry in only one year.
1505;This movie is as good as i remembered.
1506;Among all the comic book movies available, this is the most mature, thought provoking, and life altering movie I have appreciated.
1507;It is worth the time of any adult and mature youth and I suspect they will leave it better than they started or at least a desire to be better.
1508;It was definitely a well done movie and really makes you think.
1509;I thoroughly enjoyed it and it defintely fulfilled its purpose as entertainment, which is why I bought it!
1510;A wonderfully and subversively crafted film.
1511;As a stand alone movie, it works well.
1512;Moore's story dealt with a grey world full of ambiguity and people with good intentions being felled by their own weakness.
1513;One side is clearly good and the other is clearly evil.
1514;Very powerful movie with strong implications of our past, present and possible future.
1515;As the title to this review plainly says, this is one of my favorite movies.
1516;hero thriller that builds until its explosive ending.
1517;line and bleak undertone, which is purposeful, the story has a great plot and ending full of redemption.
1518;It keeps you guessing, and leaves you on the edge of your seat.
1519;I enjoyed this movie so much, that I bought it again in Blu.
1520;An excellent film, at a great price.
1521;This movie still holds up well.
1522;"The acting
1523;Despite my indifference towards Natalie Portman as an actor, the plot, cinematography, fluidity, and intellectual dialogue, makes this movie a 5 star movie in my book.
1524;high, Amazing knife battles, perfectly choreographed, high gun playBlood/Gore.
1525;taking visuals I've seen since Sin City, and some of the best acting I've seen since Crash.
1526;Hugo Weaving as V is one of the coolest characters I can remember, and he plays it perfectly.
1527;I thought Natalie Portman was just awful in the Star Wars trilogy, in fact I really haven't liked much of anything she's done, but she absolutely nailed this, a crafty mix of innocent and troubled persona holding on to a disturbing secret and violent past.
1528;the Wachowski Brothers and there protege' James McTeigue have created a masterpiece that I eagerly look forward to purchasing and watching many, many times.
1529;Bound to upset others, but I found this to be just as entertaining (if not more) as the Wachowski's 1st visual feast, The Matrix.
1530;The movie is great, the visuals are awesome, fights, explosions, music, are extraordinary.
1531;it is also always good to see how a man can change the course of a nation by the power of a vision.
1532;The best things in this literate Wachowski brothers' adaptation of the classic Moore/Lloyd graphic novel are its stars, Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman.
1533;Portman's finely felt work here as the heroine Evey is a revelation, given her woodenness in the recent Star Wars trilogy, but the real acting honors must go to Weaving, who wears a plastic Guy Fawkes mask thoughout the entire film in his role as the dashing Shakespeare.
1534;the concept of both the film and the graphic novel involves the political resistance of a masked swashbuckler in a totalitarian Britain of the very near future: its resonances in the wake of 9/11 and the Patriot Act are quite strong.
1535;But the intelligence behind Alan moore's original conception for the work overrides this, and Weaving and Portman greatly redeem the material.
1536;i carry this moving in my iPhone and have watched it many times during my travel time.
1537;Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) from the matrix did another amazing acting job on this.
1538;more so than the matrix this film was moving and his acting was powerful and believable.
1539;this is a superb film and is a MUST own for any collector or enthusiast.
1540;and climactic events in the movie are brilliantly foreshadowed, leaving you with a sense of cleverness when you watch the movie a second time!Seeing it will add a fond memory you will be happy to go to your grave with.
1541;story telling like this is one of the finer juices of life.
1542;natalie Portman is bewilderingly smokin' hot in this film even with her head shaved wearing little more than a hospital gown she is absolutely stunning.
1543;in the beginning of the film she is very lovely.
1544;i hope you enjoy the movie, I did.
1545;this is inspirational and opens a small window to that our future might end up being!
1546;If you think George W. just may be the Antichrist, that your phone could be tapped, or you just don't trust the government all that much then this is the movie for you!Seriously, it is a really good movie in the same social commentary view as The Matrix.
1547;if that does not sound like your cup of tea, well then you can see some of the other reviewers opinions on it.
1548;best line: """"The people should not fear its government, the government should fear its people."""""""
1549;"If you watch this movie and you wonder, ""why is Moore's original graphic novel so widely praised?"""
1550;It made for a good movie.
1551;Storyline, actors, director, all get a A+ in my book.
1552;You have to be somewhat of an intellectual to understand this story completely but even if you are a casual viewer You will appreciate the craftiness and excellent action of Code Name V.
1553;having read the Alan Moore graphic novel a few years back and found it interesting, knew this movie would be a blast or a bomb (sorry bad pun).
1554;very nicely done, acting, effects and atmosphere all great!The movie is deeper than Sin City because it relates to a lot of the sorry issues we are in today .
1555;A cool movie with a unique voice .
1556;The movie MUST be viewed this way, in the widescreen format(it's truly amazing)and the special features are very entertaining.
1557;I loved the hidden bonus track.
1558;But the Wachowski Brothers have done a fantastic job of bringing the story to cinema.
1559;And it is a government with much to hide.
1560;Evey, V's young protege, played with great expressiveness by Natalie Portman, is much smarter and more self.
1561;aware than in the novel.
1562;V purists will no doubt dislike the ending, where most of the film's changes occur.
1563;V for Vendetta is well worth the watch .
1564;His voice, soft and lyrical, yet capable of conveying menace, was perfect.
1565;And Stephen Rea, as the conflicted Inspector Finch, gave a restrained and effective performance.
1566;so interviews with the actors and a few behind he scenes shots showing wire work and rehearsals.
1567;Readers of the novel should see the movie, and movie viewers should read the novel to get the full effect of this marvelous ode against the excesses of authoritarians and the fear that puts them, and keeps them, in power.
1568;Lots of quotable lines here.
1569;It's a nice addition to any Blu.
1570;But I loved the plot for this movie, and the warning it gives about the future really makes you think.
1571;The movie is visually stunning with some good one.
1572;These are good ideas to ponder.
1573;A government that fears the people gives rise to dictatorships and genocide.
1574;the movie has some intelligence in the dialog and the plot, but it gives not even a hint toward the answers.
1575;There are some nice plot twists, but one really big one that does not seem plausible at all.
1576;the movie is visually stunning, the mask is really cool.
1577;V FOR VENDETTA is a cross between The Man in the Iron Mask and Phantom of the Opera.
1578;She finally rebels against the heavy.
1579;"type character in ""V"", the rebel makes good on its suicidal promise to start from scratch."
1580;the larger theme of VENDETTA is hope.
1581;On this point, the message is truly eternal, like love.
1582;love this movie great screenplay warns of the danger of control and unchecked government.
1583;Good acting and suspense in this SciFi drama.
1584;I highly recomend the movie.
1585;This is an excellent movie with an excellent message.
1586;So stay off my turf, find your own inspirational film!
1587;This film is a sleeper.
1588;however, I found the film fascinating, as much for the changes from the graphic novel as for the care taken in its filming, casting, and cinematography.
1589;This film is one that will resonate with viewers for a long time after they've watched it.
1590;Haven't enjoyed a film like this in years!
1591;It was a very good price for the product.
1592;The film has an intriguing atmosphere throughout, a few slow moments, and an apocalyptic future setting that really heightens the tension with starkly dark set design and stunning cinematography.
1593;hidden behind the creepy mask, Hugo Weaving really proves he is a versatile actor.
1594;His character provokes thoughtful questions in a dystrophic future, and every emotion of his character is brought out by Weavings performance.
1595;Portman on the other hand also excels, with a convincing accent.
1596;She really is the heroine of the film and she handles the role quite well.
1597;The scenes between Evey and V are touching and well handled.
1598;The rest of the film is great in its execution.
1599;The climax, especially, was uplifting and will live on to be the most memorable conclusion.
1600;The action is striking and the performances in the drama are standout.
1601;Entertaining from the start, V manages to combine a strong socio.
1602;political message in a compact and highly intense experience.
1603;A terrific achievement produced by the Wachowski's and Silver.
1604;Saw this movie about 100 times and it is still awesome!
1605;If you have enjoyed the film in the past or a first time viewer this is a great blue ray film to own.
1606;You get the cool fights and explosions with the high def graphics that really make a difference.
1607;It has a big cast if your familiar with the British acting scene.
1608;It touches on the old subject of take a stand against something that's not right, but a cool and new futuristic spin.
1609;It was taken from a graphic novel series so it has a real dark feel.
1610;I love this film and highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good action packed movie with a drama backbone.
1611;made film will pull its audience in for its entire length.
1612;All of these acts are accomplished by the same man yet film goers are expected to believe that this woman never once realizes that it is the same man.
1613;Possibly the best movie that I have ever seen.
1614;Natalie Portman with a English accent is a little weird, but still one of the best movies.
1615;Love how it portrays the tyranny of the government.
1616;I am proud to say I have now read the comic and seen this great movie.
1617;Other than taking a little artistic license to make the more relevant to today's audience, the writing and direction stayed true to the comic book as far as I'm concerned.
1618;While it has been a couple of years since I read the comic, I thought that the movie illustrated the point of the comic book very well.
1619;lol But it's a great movie.
1620;this is a great movie with a interesting main character.
1621;It is a great comic book to movie cross over and in itself a great story overall.
1622;This movie is fantastic by all accounts.
1623;The script is graceful and very playful with overtones of societal abstraction.
1624;The acting is just as good, but once you pull all of the pieces together the film is moving and touching.
1625;I think it is an absolutely wonderful movie: ingenious, imaginative, always exciting, with a breathtaking performance from Natalie Portman, who takes her character through momentous emotional changes and is always riveting to watch.
1626;Hugo Weaving is magnificent as the silken.
1627;voiced V. John Hurt is marvellously menacing as the High Chancellor and I thought Stephen Fry's performance really moving and highly convincing.
1628;The plotting and dialogue are simply splendid.
1629;I also loved the early historical enactments to link the modern story with Guy Fawkes.
1630;well done, everyone who was involved with this movie!Heartily recommended.
1631;its a movie that you have to pay close attention to.
1632;as far as the movie goes, the visuals and acting were pretty good.
1633;Portman was believable in her emotion, and Weaving was great at portraying emotion even with his face concealed by a mask.
1634;It has been pointed out in previous reviews, that right.
1635;That's a 4.5 star movie.
1636;disc Special Edition)The product is excellent.
1637;Yes, this review is political, as so in the movie.
1638;"The directors of the Matrix films bring us V for Vendetta ""although they just wrote the screenplay and don't direct it""."
1639;The great Hugo Weaving who played Agent Smith in those films stars here and is excellent considering he wears a mask the whole time.
1640;He brings charm and class to the role while also makes you feel bad for anyone who has to cross him.
1641;He gets help from a women played by Natalie Portman who deep down also hates how the world is.
1642;The movie is dark and very very violent but it also has heart and a compelling story with romance on the side.
1643;It has Natalie Portman giving a better performance than she did in all 3 StarWars prequels.
1644;Wehere else can you hear the 1812 overture put to such great use.
1645;The movie itself is great, with a wonderful cast.
1646;Undoubtedly this film is destined to become a cult film for those who draw on history and see parallels.
1647;Natalie Portman is exquisite in this role.
1648;"I enjoyed the entire movie, including Hugo Weaving's (""V"") eloquent speeches and vernacular."
1649;"I felt Hugo Weaving really was the star and made the ""V"" character come to life in such a vivid form."
1650;"here is my favorite quote:""Good evening, London."
1651;I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of every day routine.
1652;I enjoy them as much as any bloke.
1653;Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
1654;Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
1655;Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler.
1656;He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
1657;His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words, they are perspectives.
1658;As much as I love this movie, there was one scene that really didn't belong.
1659;Throughout the whole movie, it was philosophical and chilling.
1660;It belonged more in a horror or action.
1661;Really, we all see action movies where there is NO plot and the main objective is cool bloody graphics and scenes.
1662;i highly recommend it to people who liked 1984 and other similar stories.
1663;i enjoy movies with a good storyline and convincing characters played by convincing actors.
1664;great storyline that is entertaining.
1665;they picked the right actors for the parts and had good character development.
1666;overall, jus a fun movie to watch!
1667;welcome to Wachowski brothers' flatland.
1668;Natelie Portman overacting, as usual (her diapason of facial and body expressions is staggeringly narrow and more than wanting) but the script, photography, effects and the rest of the cast are excellent.
1669;Highly recommended, just like the comic book.
1670;I found this movie to be intelligent and engaging.
1671;The characters were fascinating, and my only real problem with the movies is that many of them were never really developed or revealed.
1672;the dialogue and cinimatography in this movie were beautiful, and I found the story's intelligence a breath of fresh air after the parade of tripe that Hollywood had inundated me with lately.
1673;Great entertainment as well as provocative thinking.
1674;Very applicable to our world politics today.
1675;Hugo Weaving is truly amazing.
1676;V for Vendetta is one of my favorite movies of all time!
1677;Natalie Portman is beautiful and gives an outstanding performance.
1678;This movie is pact full of plot twists and action.
1679;One of my favorite movies ever.
1680;Great story, visuals, and the morale of the story is an important one.
1681;Excellent sound and streaming was pretty fast.
1682;Hope you continue like that guys!
1683;So not tying the movie to anything else, it is a great movie.
1684;He is Great Britain's last hope against a tyranny that has smoothily eased its way into the lives of England's citizens.
1685;Oooooh, but it smells oh so sweet.
1686;The story takes place in England, as now the most powerful county in the world.
1687;It has to be watched more than once to fully understand everything that is said, and so that you can connect everything together.
1688;Happy to have added this to my collection.
1689;I seem to find something new each time I watch the movie.
1690;This is one of the greatest movies ever, I might even build a shrine to it.
1691;bravo to the cast and crew of this fine film.
1692;Thanks for all you time.
1693;For purpose of this movie, he is the good guy.
1694;He is inspired by Guy Fawkes.
1695;V saves her life and shortly she is involved in his activities.
1696;I really like the whole feel of this movie.
1697;The old newsreels and faux news report made it seem very real.
1698;One the best movies in the last several years and highly recommended.
1699;Great movie with a really good story.
1700;The acting is also superb.
1701;While those who previously enjoyed the graphic novel and approached the movie through that lens may have been disappointed, I can only say that after seeing V for Vendetta I was powerfully moved, intrigued and beguiled into the intracacies of this well told tale in a cinematic format.
1702;The story is tight, the visuals are stunning and atmospherics are ever present.
1703;"Great hero figure, unique storyline, awesome damsel in distress
1704;It is my absolute favorite movie now.
1705;The movie stands up nicely to the graphic novel.
1706;He also knows that all of us that grew up on comics expected more.
1707;Natalie Portman's performance is the spirit of the film.
1708;Give it a rest boys and girls.
1709;The truth is that this is a very good movie and has a good message.
1710;Where do we draw the line?The bottom line is, this movie is really a good one.
1711;It has a great script and very good actors.
1712;It has some good lines, good action and a very emotional and political plot.
1713;The movie is thought provoking.
1714;Great script, great acting and great message.
1715;V for Vendetta is an extremely entertaining movie, with a dark character seeking revenge on individuals that deformed him while the government was doing plague research.
1716;similiar to many revenge type movies, V is an intellegent, strong and extremely wealthy individual, and leaves you with the sense that he is mildy disturbed.
1717;This movie was so good in so many ways.
1718;the acting is first rate.
1719;Weaving expresses all of V's emotions / thoughts without one actual facial expression.
1720;Must give credit to the directing as well.
1721;the writing is first rate.
1722;The dialog ranks high for me, on scale with a Tarantino film (pick one).
1723;the story was spellbinding and hypnotic.
1724;It was as interesting as a David Lynch film, but the story went somewhere and is clear in the end if you pay attention.
1725;Parts of the conspiracy reminded me of Oliver Stone's JFK.
1726;the use of the 1812 overture would be a cliche in most movies, but in this one it's perfect.
1727;One of the most spectacular pieces of music ever written.
1728;Yet I thoroughly enjoyed this film.
1729;it is vitally important to continually question our motives, check our """"progress"""", review our """"beliefs""""."""
1730;If you come with an open mind, this film will cause you to do this.
1731;that's until A white Knight so to say comes from nowhere and stands up to the government challenges its rule and exposes what the government has done and why.
1732;the cast did A wonderful job.
1733;to me it was A fine action film.
1734;An absolute classic I can enjoy watching over and over again.
1735;I highly recommend this film.
1736;But is V really the heroic freedom fighter we are led to believe?
1737;By using the fear of terrorist and diesis this new leader is able to keep the people under his iron grip.
1738;He wants to start a revolution and overthrow the government.
1739;But for the rest of us who like debating other peoples views instead of slandering them, this is an amazing film.
1740;I am a republican Christian who is against gay marriage, and this movie has some pointed things to say about all of that.
1741;The government is a far right extremist group that justifies its actions somehow by saying it is the will of God.
1742;Of course this movie slant to the left, but it does have a good message.
1743;Like don't ever give up your freedom, no matter what.
1744;v for Vendetta is a very good film, do yourself a favor and go see it.
1745;This happens so often when Hollywood gets their hands on something, and I'm wondering when they'll learn.
1746;While it's true that movies can't be word for word translations of books, nor image by image, they can still be true to the story.
1747;The film presented radical ideas in a magnificent fashion, first through a very unlikely hero (whose creation was, as usual, tragic), and second through the establishment he was fighting against.
1748;both are radical, subversive, and vigilante in nature.
1749;"Some have said that ""V"" is a terrorist, and in a sense, he certainly is."
1750;undoubtedly burned into him in his birth.
1751;the acting is first rate, as are the special effects.
1752;This film certainly evoked passion in me.
1753;The movie has so much more to it than most people realize.
1754;For viewing purposes, it has action for some and romance for others.
1755;There's the overtone of a revolutionary moment that I think is rare to glimpse in a film anymore.
1756;always a favorite and I watch it every Nov 5.
1757;I must say, that V for Vendetta is the best movie i've seen in years.
1758;A true story of what government can/is becomming.
1759;As well as containing a bit of romance.
1760;It will make you understand the movie even better as well as changing the way you think.
1761;laugh with you, cry with you, or kiss you.
1762;Note from Valerie V for VendettaHope you all enjoy the movie!Remember, Remember the fifth of November!
1763;movie movies, you'll like this one.
1764;Everything from the cinematography to the casting was brilliantly done.
1765;The writing is impeccable and displays classic action scenes with meaning behind every random act of violence.
1766;There is nothing left to chance or coincidence as every second of screen time is put to good use.
1767;i highly recommend watching this movie of you're looking for an incredibly enriching experience.
1768;I personally love this movie and am glad I bought it.
1769;The Warchawski brothers created THE MATRIX films first.
1770;There are so many of these masterpieces of literary comics around nowadays, and everybody's doing them.
1771;"That man's got something hardly any actor has
1772;the movie V has (English) political and even historical overtones, based as it is on Guy Fawkes Day .
1773;V is very skillfully written, in that regard, so that whatever might slow things down to political mud wrestling is avoided, and the action is allowed to move at a brisk pace.
1774;All the elements of the story"
1775;v is very easy to watch and understand.
1776;Exciting to look at, the story, it seems to me, is a meditation on this proposition: Cromwell liberated England from its Monarch and its aristocracy, but the Parliament, once it was free to do so sold the people to the nobility which has kept them enslaved ever since.
1777;But if you love your tragic heroes seeking revenge and stories of victims who have everything they hold dear taken from them, definitely check it out!
1778;V For Vendetta is Awesome and loosely(adapted for the big screen),about a Man who had to fight Tyranny(Anti.
1779;the true story is alot more interesting, and the movie is very interesting itself and 1984esque, I enjoyed it!
1780;Definitely one of the best movies out there!
1781;Watch it if you enjoy more complex and emotional movies!
1782;It managed to create a good balance of action, storytelling, and character development.
1783;Natalie Portman was an excellent actress in this movie and played the role perfectly.
1784;From the Matrix trilogy to this, it's unusual how they create it.
1785;in the end, I recommend it!
1786;It's thought provoking, actionpacked, and just plain fun.
1787;If you enjoy science fiction art, then you've stumbled upon the best movie ever made.
1788;it's a masterpiece from start to finish and one of my favorite movies.
1789;This movie was beautifully directed.
1790;The story was well crafted and edgey.
1791;The movie was dramatic and serious, but also had nice actions scenes that made the movie both thoughtful and entertaining.
1792;I liked this film very much.
1793;Any movie with Jan van Eyck's Arnofini Marriage in it has an A in my book, but this film is a truly awe.
1794;inspiring combination of creative plot, great casting/characters, and phenomenal special effects.
1795;Very moving yet funny and real.
1796;Watching it puts you in the action and gets your pulse AND your brain going.
1797;The best movie I've seen in years.
1798;After recently watching it again I found the film to be better the second time.
1799;For me, I had to learn to accept the film as a stand.
1800;I didn't really care for Natalie Portman's accent, and her acting seemed really stiff at times, but the film looks beautiful and is enjoyable enough for its own merits.
1801;this movie is defiantely one of my faves, its an action flick and kind of a romantic flick too, with just a slight splash of commedy
1802;Just for the collection, it's very good stuff.
1803;Good story, good effects, excellent performance of Hugo as V. Not easy to transmit a message with a mask on.
1804;Probably one of my favorites of all time.
1805;I have enjoyed this movie for some time.
1806;It is a very powerful example of what could happen if people got together and did something.
1807;I thoroughly enjoy this movie because it is so thought provoking.
1808;Some may watch it and just see it as another action movie, but I feel it is more.
1809;which brings me to the question that makes this movie so worthwhile:Would you do what he did to save your country?
1810;This is a love it or hate it kind of film.
1811;I love the style, the story, the acting, and cinematography.
1812;This is the best movie I've ever seen.
1813;"i liked many memorable quotes and witty conversation throughout the film, especially Valerie's ""an inch."
1814;"we must never let them take it from us"" and V's ""if you are looking for the guilty, you need only look in the mirror"" etc.Yes, V is right, each one of us is responsible for our society because we are all part of it."
1815;besides the story, Hugo Weaving is a great actor.
1816;I got fascinated by his speech, which made V attractive.
1817;This is meant to be a thriller with a revolutionary political message.
1818;as a thriller, the anti.
1819;The state is a fascistic one, with an Oswald Mosley figure on top.
1820;This is the second, perhaps third, time seeing it and I must say that it was brilliantly done.
1821;The movie certainly makes people think about where they live and even how they live.
1822;The movie makes us look at our lives and the government that looms over us at all times.
1823;A Government's responsiblity is to it's people.
1824;In the movie I was mainly reminded of the ideals of our own revolution.
1825;I really liked the intimate alternate meanings in this movie.
1826;Would love to see a number 2!
1827;V for Vendetta is the tale of one man's vengeance with the ultimate aim to liberate a nation, and the existential journey of the woman who is forced to take his side.
1828;They are V and Evey.
1829;To me, the most important aspect of this story is the journey of Evey, who begins the movie living a life of fear.
1830;In this moment, I knew that I loved this movie.
1831;others will follow what is purported as the main story until its end, marked by its own inspirational terror and beauty.
1832;"to revolutionaries, anarchists and all those who have ever broken entirely only to find something ""else"" just behind the facet of life."
1833;This movie is a futuristic political thriller set within a morality action play.
1834;It is rich in dialog, ideas and genre.
1835;It darkly affirms the difference an individual can make in extreme circumstances, resting responsibility on each of us to take up our duty.
1836;The rhyme to November 5th references a real event .
1837;V mocks the modern day celebration of Bonfire or Fireworks Night in commemoration of monarchical survival.
1838;Very entertaining and thought provoking movie.
1839;My favorite part is when V introduces himself.
1840;You not only had it, but the price was great!
1841;the movie was amazing and i have been watching it since it has been in my possession.
1842;Thought it was a well done movie and was interesting movie toI thought the acting was good and keeping the law at wits end was funny in a way, but wasn't too happy about the endingThink i'll give it to my daughter and son in law to see.
1843;Vendetta was very passionate, with various mysterious puzzelments and shocking twists.
1844;A very bold movie, I loved it.
1845;This movie is a chilling portrait of what may happen in the not.
1846;This is a highly stylized story that tells a cautionary tale to all of us.
1847;fi fans and fans of the novels of Huxley and Orwell, it is a thumbs up.
1848;I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it V for Vendetta.
1849;The film is very stylish and the dialogue is rich with meaning.
1850;You have the original source material by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, the screenplay by the Wachowski's, and first time director James McTeigue.
1851;Hugo Weaving seals the movie with his sophisticated voice and really gives the character a reason for his motivation.
1852;It's an overall entertaining film with lots of ideas being expressed.
1853;aCTING: Hugo Weaving (known as Agent Smith in the Matrix films) plays V, and he does a fantastic job even though we never see his face.
1854;He expresses his character's emotion through voice, and his voice is a perfect fit for the character.
1855;She goes through a rebirth and sees the government the way V does, and basically fights alongside him.
1856;The cast does a fine job, but no standout performances.
1857;"I don't know, but if you can get past some illogical plot holes and a familiar plot
1858;It's well done, but it has inconsistant direction.
1859;There are more pros than cons about the film, and it's worth seeing.
1860;If you want a fast paced, mysterious, incredibly interesting movie.
1861;This is the sort of movie that some people are destined to hate.
1862;Yet is is a powerful story about responding to oppression, many of the sequences are excellent, and the ending does deliver.
1863;Though I suppose I have a soft spot for vigilantes.
1864;V in everyday circumstance has a really cute and playful personality, but powerful and commanding presence when he goes public with his vendetta (seriously, no pun intended).
1865;This film was excellent in every way possible.
1866;Excellent script, actors and special effects.
1867;At its most basic level I thoroughly enjoyed the move V for Vendetta simply for its swashbuckling style, its lyricism, visual effects, great action sequences, its music (especially the stones song """"street fighting man"""" at the trailer)!"""
1868;"and I enjoyed V's use of poetry to convey his eternal idea"" of justice (an idea which cannot be destroyed) behind the Guy Fawkes mask."
1869;definitely worthy of a 5 star rating.
1870;This movie is great on its own but is perfect when paired with dystopian literature of any kind in a school setting.
1871;i have never read the Graphic Novel but i am very impressed by the updating of the story to fit the War.
1872;I found all the performances solid and good to see NP given something a bit more meaty to do.
1873;She is good but she has quite a distinctive accent, which would be unnoticable were we not so familar with it from Star Wars.
1874;This movie topped my charts in what my opinion of a good movie is.
1875;There is a lot of double think out there but thanks to films like this one those who think like that will become fewer and fewer.
1876;For one the actors are british who I find to be born actors anyway, and the script was brilliant.
1877;Match that with great production values,cinematograpy,and humour just in the right places of this deadly serious subject which, if you are perspicacious enough, will see that every frame of this film is happening to us all right now keeping in mind they have to condense so much information into a film.
1878;Now I will not dispute that this is a wonderful adaption of Alan Moore's classic graphic novel, V For Vendetta.
1879;I liked the way they updated it and I can't say that for many of the comic book films that I've seen.
1880;written screenplay and a series of haunting, scary images on the screen.
1881;hugo Weaving fares better, even with his painted on china (or is it bulletproof steel) mask and its great painted grin, like a merry.
1882;I watched the movie and I concur with the filmmaker's decision.
1883;I was astounded by the way that, individual plots points and loose threads seem to disappear into outer space while leaving us with a modern fable of great power and communal beauty and fire.
1884;"i know we are in the middle of ""The War on Terror"" but some people seem to interpret everything in our culture as either Pro."
1885;This is easy enough to do once they have the power.
1886;It works and the party of hate is swept into power promising strict measures to insure security.
1887;"Soon after the ""cure"" is discovered, thanks in part to the party now in power."
1888;the movie makes a good point that you should never blindly trust your government.
1889;That should worry people far more than a simple movie!The movie is well acted.
1890;It is also well shot.
1891;I did like the twist that brought Evey's awakening.
1892;overall I give it 4 stars for the acting, cinematography, and thought provoking story.
1893;"With a screenplay and production by the Wachowski Brothers, I'd at least expect plenty of explosions and some neat special effects because, let's be honest, folks, the only reason that the first ""Matrix"" flick did very well was because of the whole slo."
1894;Natalie Portman delivers her standard wooden performance that won our hearts in the Star Wars prequels.
1895;"Portman's only great performance was in ""The Professional"" with Jean Reno, and that was quite a few years ago."
1896;"the story centers around a supposed terrorist who goes by the name ""V."" He's mad at the government for making him into a hideous monster and has decided to overthrow said government by blowing up numerous British monuments and historically important buildings."
1897;the special effects are done fairly well, and the Wachowskis even pull the old bullet.
1898;i'll agree with other reviewers that this film does make you think.
1899;And I used to take AP Film, so I've seen them all.
1900;This movie has it all as well: breathtaking shots, touching dialogue, extraordinary musical score.

1907;Bravo to the Wachowski brothers for aselflessly political film aiming to safeguard our freedom.
1908;It's easy to dismiss someone who looks this good, and trying to be as objective as possible, I was pleasantly surprised by her performance and range of emotions.
1909;There's more to this book than its lovely cover.
1910;to simplify things, V is a more aesthetically pleasing take on the message in Fight Club, but with some Matrix flair in the special effects department.
1911;in any event, it's refreshing to see something with a message which is so well.
1912;polished and compelling to watch.
1913;This was a great movie for those of us who like are brains to work while and after you watch movies.
1914;This is the the best movie of the year so far.
1915;This movie has a lot of parallels to life in these new times of government threats of terrorism lurking around ever corner.

1923;If you appreciate philosophy in general, or political philosophy more specifically, or if you've enjoyed books like We, Fahrenheit 451, 1984, or Brave New World, you will enjoy V for Vendetta.
1924;I suspect it will stimulate many discussions and perhaps even an interest in further reading.
1925;I heard a lot of good reviews about this movie so i decided to take a look.
1926;This movie is a piece of art and has become one of favorite movies.

1928;Thank you for the good service!

1934;"The screenplay by Andy and Larry Wachowski (The Wachowski Brothers, the men that brought us ""The Matrix"" trilogy) and (based on the DC Comics graphic novel by Alan Moore (the writer of graphic novels, such as, ""From Hell"" and ""The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen"") and David Lloyd) is excellent!"

1944;I very much appreciate this movie in several ways.
1945;the actors do a very nice job and I really like the story line.
1946;Best and most universally enjoyable political movie ever.
1947;Hugo Weaving has an incredible masked personality.
1948;Great movie with a great message.
1949;I loved not being able to see the face of V, which just shows him as a symbolic character.
1950;This movie is unique and i absolutely loved it.
1951;I can only relate what I witnessed and experienced from the film alone as an isolated piece of art, and it was good.
1952;"The field agents or Fingermen violate the citizenry
1953;Then he provides inspiration and a means to do something about it.
1954;Its power is in the universality of the tale.
1955;But do not lock the greater meaning and power of the message into its form.
1956;It is a rousing tale where one sacrifices self.
1957;interest for the greater good.
1958;the cinematography is phenomenal with its stark colorization"
1959;The film slows slightly while providing some back story, but it is necessary to fully inform the narrative.
1960;From start to finish, it is just a remarkable achievement.
1961;This is an amazing movie,great story of a revolution against a fascist government and where the line can be drawn between freedom fighter and anarchist
1962;A good representation of this genre following in the footsteps of Orwell's 1984 and more recent classics such as The Matrix.
1963;V for Vendetta is by no means a great movie, and I am not totally convinced it is even a particularly good one, but it has more spirit and bravado than anything I have seen in some time.
1964;germany co. production to finally make a film worth arguing about, a film that isn't afraid to use the word `terrorist,' a film often shocking in its blunt political assertions, but with this misgiving aside, it must still be appreciated that such a film has been made at all.
1965;The effects were generally vibrant and enjoyable, except for the CGI enveloped fight between V and a dozen or so policemen which was over.
1966;top in a way that seemed beneath the rest of the film.
1967;V for Vendetta is a rarity these days because it is a film that has something to say and seems rather urgent to say it.
1968;This causes problems, sure, but it also injects the film with enough energy to make it often invigorating and always interesting.
1969;The film is undoubtedly anti.
1970;I do not necessarily believe that the movie is anything more than just that, a movie, nor do I agree with everything it could be potentially saying, but I do believe that art as bold as this, and as politically charged and confrontational, is the sure sign of a healthy culture.
1971;"this was a beautiful movie
1972;V is all about starting a revolution to overthrow the government, so the people can take back their country and freedom without fear or reservations.
1973;All I know is, as far as entertainment value goes it was great.
1974;Natalie Portman was wonderful, and she still looked beautiful without hair.
1975;V for Vendetta has a very predictable plot, but is visually well done, with good acting (or voice over?)

1980;while hardly a masterpiece, """"V for Vendetta"""" is certainly better and more entertaining than """"The Island"""", the last modern film I saw that addressed mass hysteria, mass mind control, and oppression."""
1981;He manages to do things no one could realistically do .
1982;The film revolves around his exploits, his friendship with a like.
1983;"It's kind of like Woddy Allen's ""Bananas"" played straight, without the laughs."
1984;"If you enjoyed any of the aforementioned films I'm sure you'll enjoy ""V for Vendetta""."
1985;V For Vendetta is the rarest of things: A work of art that manages to be both commercially viable and uncompromisingly subversive.
1986;It's an arrestingly stylish, devastatingly smart movie whose every scene demands attention and contemplation.
1987;And at the same time, it's incredibly fun to watch.
1988;the plot is a bit complex (and besides, watching the story unfold is half the fun.
1989;Well, more like a third of the fun.
1990;What sets this brave new world apart from (and ahead of) other, lesser cinematic dystopias is its incredible atmosphere.
1991;It's atmospheric, hypnotic, and undeniably powerful.
1992;This setting is populated by an equally engaging cast of heroes and villains.
1993;from the charismatic and utterly ruthless High Chancellor Adam Sutler to the oddly sympathetic government inspector Eric Finch to the film's twin protagonists, Evey Hammond and V, just about everybody in this film is a wonderfully drawn, finely crafted example of characterization at its sharpest.
1994;the story itself, which concerns V's yearlong crusade against the tyranny that has fallen on hi nation, is simply brilliant.
1995;V himself is a stunningly drawn character, an incredibly complex man whose cool charisma and literate style belie a troubled, vulnerable sort of humanity.
1996;but therein lies the brilliance of the movie: V For Vendetta doesn't aim to make us blindly sympathize with its central character.
1997;and it's entertaining, too: The plot is genuinely suspenseful and engaging, full of twists, and revelations.
1998;sharp, the visuals are unforgettable, and the climax is simply gorgeous.
1999;My order arrived very quickly (much sooner than I expected) and in perfect condition.
2000;and it is great entertainment too!
2001;I was always wanting to see this move.
2002;I bought it, I of my favorites.
2003;When Evey acts to protect V from the police, he takes her under his wing, and begins to educate her on his method and his madness.
2004;The insignia of this brave new world is a twisted version of the cross, and the fact that the person in charge is a chancellor recalls Hitler, as does the way the chancellor dresses.
2005;in the movie V speaks of the power of ideas and the importance of using words to persuade rather than coerce, but what really matters is blowing up buildings.
2006;It is the awakening political consciousness of Evey that is the soul of this film.
2007;my biggest complaint is that the film provides, in relative terms, a happy ending.
2008;series, not only because I think an episodic approach is better suited to telling the story, but also because it is a much more intimate tale that what we see on the big screen where they go out of their way to crank up the volume on the explosions.
2009;V for Vendetta is a visually striking, politically challenging, memorable film.
2010;For those who only remember her as Padme in the Star Wars films, she has a chance to show a much broader range of abilities, and is impressive.
2011;If you have not seen this movie, you are in for the best time.
2012;The acting is great, story line terriffic.
2013;If you want something with action and meaning this is the movie for you!
2014;"I really liked it
2015;I love this movie, so well done.
2016;The themes of choice, integrity, and causality were the driving force of the characters.
2017;The Wachowski brothers do an excellent job of showing how every character in movie including V struggles with doing what they wish rather that which they know to be right.
2018;I hope you will take the time to see this movie again.
2019;This is a great movie that can easily be watched over and over again.
2020;A must for the movie collection.
2021;One of the best distopian society movies I've ever seen.
2022;This is a clever, finely nuanced, and finally uplifting look at Everyman's response to evil with plenty of surprise twists to keep you guessing.
2023;I absolutely loved this movie!
2024;Love it love it love it
2025;on the positive side:Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, Stephen Rea, John Hurt, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!
2026;All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!Moreover, the special effects are pretty good.
2027;This is a must see cult classic.
2028;great script, good actors, really moving.
2029;makes you want to fight for what's right!

2031;Anything that has to do with overthrowing an unjust government keeps my attention!
2032;hearted foray into revolution, and I really enjoyed it.
2033;Lots of action and an intense plot.
2034;I liked it a lot and my 16.
2035;It lead us into a whole discussion of Guy Fawkes and why it's relevant today.
2036;When a movie leaves you (and your teenager) with that kind of curiosity, it's a good movie.
2037;It has stayed with me and informed me in ways few other movies have.
2038;I have watched it several times since our initial viewing and my son recommends it to everyone.
2039;And Natalie Portman is fantastic!
2040;And you MUST see this film.
2041;It is the most interesting, subversive, and important film I've seen in decades.
2042;One man, a literate, intelligent, but vengeful man, who goes by the name of """"V"""" for reasons revealed as the film progresses, has a vendetta, indeed, but it's much more than a personal one."""
2043;And the blowing up of Parliament was a show of strength.
2044;Blowing up Parliament was a way for the people to reclaim their power.
2045;And feeling that power, they might yet right the wrongs that had been done in their name.
2046;i loved the story and movie on so many levels.
2047;The writing was brilliant, even Shakespearean at times.
2048;The images were sleek and dark and sterile, like the world in which the story takes place.
2049;I will be forever in awe of Hugo Weaving's impeccable, faceless performance, as well as Natalie Portman's moving portrayal of a woman who came to discover ultimate freedom by choosing integrity over fear.
2050;And the love story between them was incredibly compelling.
2051;At one point, one of the government investigators searching for V, portrayed by the always interesting Stephen Rea, starts to open his mind.
2052;"In his world, the act of asking the question was itself a very bold step: ""If our government was behind the attacks, would you really want to know?"
2053;In a brilliant series of intercuts, he glimpses the past, present, and future.
2054;There's something about people taking massive, collective action that inspires me to no end.
2055;We have the power to do amazing things, together.
2056;And ideas carry tremendous force.
2057;as some reviewers have noted, with a sentiment I want to echo, we should all take heart in the fact that a major studio (Warner Brothers) backed and released this film.
2058;This movie arrived in a fast amount of time and was a great price too.
2059;I watched the movie and enjoyed it too.
2060;As you can see I'm a movie buff and this this is a great movie.
2061;I always go back to watching this movie.
2062;Bought it as a gift, so now he and I can watch it together!
2063;Arrived very timely and seems perfect.
2064;The book was excellent too.
2065;Hugo Weaving, who played V, was excellent.
2066;"While I haven't read the original ""V for Vendetta"" what I did skim out of a freind's copy, Mr. Moore should be pleased with it."
2067;Reminds me of what is going on in our world today.
2068;Far from a crumbling society, things for the most part look nice and new and shiny.
2069;Furthermore, the hero V, for having been badly burned in a fire, is able to speak clearly and very agile and quick for someone who had suffered such physical damage.
2070;In spite of the possibilities, rarely do film makers take full advantage of what is available to them.
2071;"Director James McTeigue and writers Alan Moore (who created ""V for Vendetta"" as a comic), Andy Wachowski, and Larry Wachowski have taken a concept never before seen in the movies and created a marvelous, enjoyable and entertaining film."
2072;The movie provides us with the history of Guy Fawkes at the very beginning of the movie.
2073;What wonderful escapades they are, and how bizarrely the conflict between V and Sutler proceeds.
2074;the selection of John Hurt as Sutler and Hugo Weaving as V was brilliant.
2075;Hurt executes his role with perfection, and there are places where I thought he was on the edge of frothing at the mouth.
2076;weaving is casual, with a sonorous voice that borders on sinister, and yet can be incredibly romantic.
2077;He is logical in his actions and purposeful, without emotion.
2078;if this movie makes people wonder, as it made me wonder, or if it makes people think, as it made me think, then the movie has done a wonderful thing.
2079;This movie is creative, thought.
2080;I thought it was wonderful, and look forward to watching it again.
2081;booky and a bit over the top, but it makes it's point about what we trade when our safety becomes more important than our freedom.
2082;I thought it was going to be action packed and it was.
2083;I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this movie.
2084;I was riveted from beginning to end.
2085;All of the acting was superb.
2086;And the writing was brilliant .
2087;It came in good condition and I've watched it several times already.
2088;it was just as good as I remembered.
2089;Well, I just can say the sound is the best, the video is so cool.
2090;i think that this is one of the best movies i seen in a long time
2091;I will admit that I enjoyed this movie.
2092;I thought the acting was great for what it was, the cinematography was excellent (probably my favorite aspect of the movie), The direction was intriguing, and the story was overall decently solid and thought.
2093;it was fun, pretty, interesting, and worth my time.
2094;It's one part revenge movie, one part politely uprising, one part love story.
2095;The artistic themes and fantastic symbolism are what makes this film a masterpiece.
2096;The symbolism is amazing, the psychology magnificent, the characters awesome and entertaining.
2097;entertaining, one of my favorite films.
2098;"i think that ""V for Vendetta"" is a very important movie in its own right."
2099;It brings to light the true face behind the mask of those who are in power right now in real life.
2100;Great acting by Portman, liked the superhero style for V. Sexual undertones not necessary as had absolutely no effect on the storyline, which is why not 5 stars.
2101;One if my favorite movies that I wish got more recognition.
2102;Very political film, a lot of action and suspense.
2103;Great fighting scenes and very good story line.
2104;This movie was trashed by the mainstream media critics uncluding the NY Times, but the people liked the movie.
2105;If you think of this movie as a combination of Zorro and 1984 you'll have a pretty good idea of what it's like.
2106;Hugo Weaving (Matrix, Cloud Atlas) is superb as the man behind the mask, and Natalie Portman is excellent in the female lead.
2107;John Hurt is convincing as the evil dictator.
2108;With strong characterizations, fine acting all around, a commanding story and plot, a sobering political message, and a taught script, this movie, which I don't recall getting much play when it was first released, more than exceeded my expectations.
2109;The Matrixis often given the status of a modern classic and is seen as being the Wachowski Brother's finest hour.
2110;even 12 years after release, it is still an astoundingly good film on many levels.
2111;Furthermore this film radiates soul and has enough raw political clout to have founded its own unintentional mass movement: Anonymous.
2112;Indeed it is said that Alan Moore can't stand this film since 'V' is an anarchist in the novel and is more of a freedom fighter for democracy here (Alan Moore has said on record that 99% of problems are caused by 'leaders').
2113;despite the feelings of the author, I'd say the adaptation was first rate and the film stands tall as a testament to democracy and truth.
2114;it has certainly become my favourite film and I hope I've made a good case for it being the Wachowski's best.
2115;Still, if you haven't seen it, please do and make up your own mind.
2116;depth film demands repeat viewing.
2117;Excellent all the way around.
2118;Natalie Portman, excellent and versatile.
2119;It is worth a look, in my humble opinion
2120;All the things you expect, perfect!!
2121;It's been a long time since we've had such a thoughtful, beautiful, and engaging movie like this, and even more surprising that it would come from the guys who most recently brought us (yawn) the two boring and pseudo.
2122;Yep, the Warchowski brothers have written a highly literate, powerful movie that you really should see.
2123;does she eat in real life?)
2124;, the acting is really first rate.
2125;Stephen Fry is sensational as a talk show host with a secret life, Hugo Weaving gives a powerful performance from beneath a rigid mask, John Hurt is great as a power.
2126;style dictator, Steven Rea is wonderful as a detective with a heart, and Tim Pigott.
2127;Love is important, and sex is important too, but free thought and realm of ideas are what make us special .
2128;all this, plus a satisfying ending.
2129;But after the first 5 minutes I was hooked until the very end!
2130;The movie is very thought provoking and stayed on my mind long after it was over.
2131;^_^ After all I loved his performance, and Natalie Portman's.
2132;I'm only 14 and I understood how deep this story goes and it's an absoloute great movie.
2133;A really great film about the power that a government can have over a people and the role that propaganda and the media can play in manipulating a nation.
2134;The score is really great and the acting is superb!
2135;i loved ideas dont die , Entertaining, but action could be better
2136;I bought this item cause i do personally think as this movie as the best feature film i've ever seen.
2137;I've seen it at least 7 times and every time i find something new and exciting.
2138;The product case is not awesome but still very decent.
2139;I recommend anyone to own this jewel.
2140;great product it arrived a few days early.
2141;which of course is a good thing.
2142;great product at a great price.
2143;considering how well the Brothers W dealt with the interweaving of complex ideas in the first Matrix movie, I was willing to be optimistic about their ability to adapt one of the most brilliant works of fiction I'd ever read.
2144;provoking discourse on freedom, anarchy, and the price we pay for security.
2145;layered, complex, and intelligent .
2146;I really like this movie and both Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman do a great in it.
2147;It has action, suspense and all the good stuff
2148;this is a life changing movie and a life affirming movie.
2149;This is an absolutely fantastic movie with an excellent message.
2150;together we can change the world.
2151;One of the best, thoughtful movies that has come out in the past 20+ yrs, with all the crap that's coming out of H Wood.
2152;It is scary, sexy, stylish, smart, exciting, and will make you root for V and remember all the injustices and unfairness of the world/in your life.
2153;I loved watching this over and over.
2154;The ending of the movie of V's plan is so brilliant.
2155;And I think V (and that mask) is actually sexy.
2156;the political tinge on amazon is beyond the brim.
2157;As is common, the trailer showed highlights out of context and led me to believe that it was action packed and meant to entertain.
2158;Some criticisms regarding a certain lack of originality are perhaps deserved, but the true power of this film is in the dialogue and in the wonderful performances of both Hugo Weaving (quite remarkable given that you actually see his face in only one short scene) and Natalie Portman who vindicates herself brilliantly after her difficult tour in the Star Wars mess.
2159;But, now, we finally have the years first great movie.
2160;This film is completely fantasy.
2161;furthermore, the special effects are fantastic, and the Wachowski brothers are able to make everything look so realistic, without getting rediculous and corny like certain movies (Fantastic Four comes to mind).
2162;The performances are wonderful, and Stephen Rea gives his best performance since Interview With the Vampire, and I think he deserves the year's first Oscar consideration (I know it's early).
2163;Hugo Weaving's voice performance of V is good, but it kind of sounds like Mr. Smith with a Guy Fawkes mask.
2164;John Hurt is also great, giving a Hitler.
2165;esque performance, from everything from his spitting when he talks to his strong bodily movements.
2166;The idea of the dystopia is not a new one, but V for Vendetta displays it in such a new light, and it is really the first to use the dystopia with a superhero figure.
2167;Everything in this film is great, from the story to the acting to the suspense.
2168;this film mostly landed under the radar of the new class of self.
2169;comfortable film critics got a bit huffy about the movie's larger implications).
2170;I am very overwhelmed and speechless after watching this movie.
2171;It takes every civil rights movement and rolls it all into one.
2172;This movie takes a very serious look at the way violence is portrayed in modern society and how it is reported to society as well.
2173;"I am with V in this one
2174;I highly recommend this movie to everyone!!!
2175;What I get out of this great movie is """"Can we have change or effect change without violence""""?"""
2176;i went into this one with an open mind, and i'm a big alan moore fan (the killing joke).
2177;I really enjoyed this well crafted film.
2178;'V' is thought provoking and impressive as it delivers on multiple levels.
2179;purposes the personal to convey its broader, social/political statement.
2180;if you're not put off by fairly graphic violence, I believe you'll enjoy 'V' as every facet of this film was well thought out and crafted to strengthen its theme.
2181;Natalie Portman, faced with a demanding role, renders a compelling 'Evey' and Hugo Weaving's mysterious 'V' was truly mesmerizing.
2182;Excellent support provided by Stephan Rea, John Hurt, and Stephan Fry: they also deserve considerable credit for delivering intriguing, believable characters.
2183;'V' succeeds by entertaining and prompting us to examine the conflicts and dilemmas when trying to balance freedom and security.
2184;Some people absolutely hated this and others really loved it.
2185;I thought it was a lot better than you might think from some of the critical reviews, but not something I will go back to again and again.
2186;right party has won power and established a police state.
2187;style medical experiments on gays and dissidents.
2188;the special effects are magnifient and there is some excellent acting: both Weaving and Portman are very good, and John Hurt is superb as the deranged dictator, Adam Sutler.
2189;"Stephen Rea is brilliant as Inspector Finch, a policeman who has been a loyal supporter of the governing party for many years but begins to have doubts when he is ordered to track down ""V""."
2190;having said that, if you don't take it too seriously, this film is a good piece of light hearted, escapist fun.
2191;"I thought after attending the stinkfest ""Date Movie"" and the painful ""Ultraviolet"" in consecutive weeks I would finally enjoy a movie in V for Vendetta."
2192;Hugo Weaving does his best, however it only takes a while to be completed frustrated by the mask.
2193;There are some wonderful soliloquies and exchanges in the film.
2194;V is put forth as an extremely witty and verbose former actor who delivers theatric performances as he's starting the revolution.
2195;The expectation of these sequences is very high considering the magnificent history the Wachowski brothers have had in special effects and cinematography with their Matrix trilogy.
2196;I assumed V had a silent role, and that the film would be set somewhere in the former Communist eastern Europe.
2197;i agree with some of the other reviewers that this movie has scenes which appear to be based on events in real life, as well as scenes from other movies.
2198;The crowning virtue of this film is the question of V's true identity.
2199;Control freaks will find it traumatizing, but I daresay the rest of us will find it well worth the price.
2200;ray and enjoyed on a big screen with big sound.
2201;Scarily relevant in these times!
2202;I highly recommend watching this film, if not for any other reason than to see what could be lost if we continue NOT to pay attention to what out government is doing and the rights we are sacrificing.
2203;Good plot with a little twist, great story, good effects and more.
2204;Kinda indie in terms of conspiracy theory and tolerance / freedom issues.
2205;Great motion picture, with great special effects!
2206;Would absolutely recommend to anyone!
2207;The lossless audio track is nice, but only 16.
2208;a good vender and about all a awesome movie a must have.
2209;provoking, with excellent acting performances and great action scenes.
2210;Hugo Weaving is the absolute standout in this film.
2211;As V, he is engaging and interesting.
2212;He was perfect for the role and I don't believe that anyone in the business could have outdone him in this role.
2213;He delivered in terms of action and dialogue.
2214;natalie Portman also gives quite a powerful performance.
2215;the storyline is unique and is done very well.
2216;Intelligent writing and great acting.
2217;"hugo in the mask is mesmerizing
2218;A lucidly insightful glimpse at both a potential future AND too.
2219;home elements of our present time.
2220;time Director James McTeigue does an excellent job balancing action with wisdom and a touch of irony.
2221;One of my all time favorite movies.
2222;Everything was great in this movie from the script, to the acting and especially the action.
2223;It is a well done movie.
2224;This one turned out to be a step above the rest.
2225;It had all the elements to make a great movie: Violence, Romance, Comedy, Action and Drama.
2226;If we don't wake up as a world, this could very well be our future.
2227;This movie was so great and I can't wait to add it to my collection tomorrow when it's released.
2228;Got me the item quickly and I loved it!
2229;Great price for a movie that plants a small seed in our brains about gov conspiracy and 1984.
2230;I feel that it should be pulled and re.
2231;If you are willing to overlook the terrorism aspect then this is a really good movie.
2232;V for Vendetta is a story representing a future that could very well come true based on how events could play out.
2233;opposing this oppression is a man, V, who represents another form of extremism.
2234;Through V, she both finds personal strength and enhanced wisdom over the need for radical action.
2235;the last scenes, which I will not spoil, are very powerful.
2236;The faceless masses are very artfully turned into individuals as V brings down the establishment.
2237;in general regards to the movie, the storyline moves along well.
2238;he then proceeds, one by one, to take out the gunmen in the most stylized, elegant, and powerful fight scenes of the whole movie.
2239;From its powercharged beginning until the last 10 minutes of cinema glory and sheer, heart pounding adrenaline that is packed into a magnificent, visually stunning close, """"v For Vendetta"""" provokes, shocks, both visually and morally, and ultimately provides some of the greatest and most beautiful scenes of imagery ever created in action movies."""
2240;Though the plot begins to become very slow for about 30 minutes, it kicks back up in a rampage of action, a hailstorm of a story, and, underneath it all, a powerful message to tell people now what can be in a mere few years.
2241;assly, that it soars you through emotions, and invokes you to the bitter end.
2242;Give this movie all of your power and attention, because underneath its stylized action, there is a great, powerful message.
2243;A plot so well crafted, an absolute beauty in the way it has been produced, that you will leave the theater impowered with such a rush, that this movie will become something talked about for years to come.
2244;With all of the currets events going on thsi is a perfect time to view movie This Movie is a must see for all .
2245;It is exciting And can put life into prospective.
2246;I loved the development of each scene and how the movie flowed along.
2247;It really is like poetry in motion filled with fine acting and a most exciting and compelling plot!
2248;The lighting was wonderful and the music really set the mood.
2249;This is by far the best movie I have seen in the last two years.
2250;The script was so well written.
2251;I will see this movie again.
2252;This movie was so entertaining as well.
2253;Please check out this movie because unlike so many other movies lately this one is well worth the price of admission.
2254;V for vendetta is one of my favorite movies, I like this movie and enjoy watching it, no matter how many times.
2255;Love or hate it, I'm pretty sure that you will have an opinion about this polemic film, based on a comic written by Alan Moore, adapted to the big screen by the Wachowski Brothers, and directed by James McTeigue.
2256;Their freedom is curtailed, but they feel safe.
2257;"All the same, ""V for Vendetta"" makes you think, has great actors, an original cinematography and a hectic pace."
2258;I really liked this film.
2259;Natalie Portman does a nice job as Evie, and I really liked the character of V. Overall this is a really good movie with lots of exciting parts and drama.
2260;rounded as it could have.
2261;it is a great movie.
2262;My complimets go to the writers and directors who made such a daring movie.
2263;This is an incredible film.
2264;It grabbed my attention and had me mesmerized through the entire showing.
2265;What an intriguing story and what wonderful acting.
2266;V was both glamorous and shocking.
2267;Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving were excellent in their roles.
2268;The bond that grew between them seemed so real.
2269;This movie put a whole new twist on Guy Fawkes' Day for me.
2270;I definitely want to get my hands on the graphic novel by David Lloyd.
2271;Bought it for my mother.
2272;law, she loved it too.
2273;This is a great view for any who have not seen it before
2274;Otherwise it was very good and I liked Natalie Portman's character and the direction of the story.
2275;truly is a great movie!
2276;you definitely can't beat this price either
2277;A really, really good film!
2278;It has a unique plot and is superbly acted.
2279;"With symbols reminiscent of Nazism and similarities with George Orwell's novel ""1984"", Sutler has imposed a curfew upon the entire country and has banned anything (books, art, films, etc.) that he has deemed inappropriate
2280;based upon a graphic novel of the same name by artist David Lloyd, """"V for Vendetta"""" is a compelling film whose actors were very interesting and engaging."""
2281;Though the film received no Oscar nominations, Natalie Portman won a Saturn Award for Best Actress from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films.
2282;The film also received Saturn Award nominations for Best Costume, Best Science Fiction Film and Best Writing (Larry and Andy Wachowski).
2283;"overall, the 2005 film ""V for Vendetta"" earns a well."
2284;deserved 5 out of 5 stars and I highly recommend it to every sci.
2285;He sprouts poetry, rhymes and all sorts of good stuff.
2286;He's out to get parlaiment and well, do what Guy Fawkes didnt do all those years ago.
2287;I'm sure a lot of people think this is aiming towards Bush and what not but I'm not big on politics so I just see it as an entertaining action packed joy ride from start to blazing finish filled with brilliant performances done by our main man Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman who releases herself from the druk that was Star Wars Revenge of the Sith last year.
2288;One of the best films that has come out this year.
2289;V FOR VENDETTA is a superbly orchestrated and well made movie, with evidence of its MATRIX lineage highly evident in the stylized feel of the movie.
2290;Hugo Weaving does a remarkably good job considering we never see the actors face, so with his Guy Fawlkes mask always on, his character has to be accessed with his voice more than anything, and Weaving is amazing in conveying V's mission and feelings.
2291;Natalie Portman is equally impressive as Evey, the girl he rescues from police and hides her away in his hideaway.
2292;Their relationship develops interestingly and convincingly.
2293;The film's message is pertinent to a society where the government certainly squelches individualism and creativity, nnd the direction and camera work are brilliant.
2294;It isn't a pleasant picture the movie paints, but it is certainly well done and worth seeing.
2295;Aside from sin city, this is the best comic.
2296;Also, it had a good story and a clear message that wasn't ruined by some fantastic hollywood one liners.
2297;I saw this movie in IMAX when it first came out and I got this 2 disc special edition for christmas and I have always LOVED this movie.
2298;It is amazing and shows an AMAZING side of politics and government.
2299;One of my favorite movies!
2300;"Hugo Weaving gives an excellent performance as ""V"" and Natalie Portman also stars in this 2006 film about a futuristic London."
2301;A portrait of a Brave New World/1984 society in which the government, led by dictator Adam Sutler (masterfully played by John Hurt), attempts to control everything, this film is a warning of what could become of tightening civil liberties and increasing government control here in the United States and elsewhere around the world.
2302;V for Vendetta is one of those must.
2303;I know, I know, how can I respect myself as a well.
2304;anyway, my suspicion is that, in spite of Moore's well.
2305;eyed spit of a self.
2306;In essence, he is a mistake and a success, the vengeful child of a government that created him.
2307;But it's so much more than that.
2308;The touch of the Wachowski brothers is everywhere, from the dialogue to the camera shots, beautifully panning, teasing, titillating and mocking with every shot, every sound, and every line.
2309;Dressed in a Guy Fawkes mask and voiced with honeyed tones by Weaving, he's instantly likable and frightening, a madcap spirit who heralds the clarion call of change.
2310;V inspires you like that.
2311;The message comes across regardless of the setting: the price of freedom is fear.
2312;give it up at your own risk.
2313;For a lot of people, tell them a film is based on a graphic novel .
2314;This one is a combination of adventure fantasy .
2315;and a great voice it is, too.
2316;There are plenty of plot holes, mostly having to do with the ease with which V gets in and out of very high.
2317;And the victory here celebrated is the triumph of the individual over the state.
2318;This is the essential and overwhelmingly powerful message of this most important film.
2319;in an early scene, a beautiful young woman, stranded after mandatory curfew, is about to be set upon by tyrannical government agents.
2320;"V comes on the scene, saves her, roughs up the government thugs, shelters her, and reveals to her his fascinating secret life, all the while hid behind his enigmatic ""Guy Fawkes mask""."
2321;He is the perfect anti.
2322;"In time, the romance that develops between the young girl, played brilliantly by Natalie Portman, and ""V"" is as wonderful as is the movie's terribly important philosophical message."
2323;there is much truly amazing and terribly important historical significane built into this outstanding screen play.
2324;In English history, it was the triumph of the oligarchy, represented by the Parliament, over the popular monarchy that represented the enthronement of the money power and the crushing of indiviudal freedom.
2325;It is the cry of freedom that screams out throughout this wonderful and truly amazing movie.
2326;It is the articulation of the argument of individual freedom and morality against the crushing power of the state.
2327;A more important message than this has never emerged from Hollywood.
2328;In your face, Michael Medved!The final scene is breathtaking.
2329;"And keep in mind ""V's"" admonition:""Remember, remember, the fifth of November,Gunpowder, treason, and plotI can think of no reason that gunpowder treasonShould ever be forgot""."
2330;this is truly one of the greatest movies of all time!
2331;But the movie delivers its message of liberation in a wonderful way that could only be called a form of art.
2332;Hugo Weaving as V is such a good actor he can project his feelings and emotional reactions from BEHIND A MASK.
2333;Natalie Portman, while not as powerful or as skilled as Weaving still holds up her part of the story as Evey.
2334;john Hurt as the leader was, for me, a great pick.
2335;four so I find it ironic.
2336;Stephen Rea as the police detective is a good balance of smarts and loyalty to the government to make his character just THIS side of reality.
2337;Stephen Fry's character brings a little more reality to the movie yet also adds the one moment of disconnect for me.
2338;add explosions to the great characters, a solid story, important themes, great fight scenes, and what you get is a Four out of Five film.
2339;overall I enjoyed the movie even while I am also a fan of the book .
2340;And at 132 minutes you will want lots of yummy popcorn.
2341;I just received V as a gift.
2342;I just wanted to chime in with a thumbs up based purely on the level of entertainment.
2343;It's an interesting and really well done film and Natalie Portman delivers a great performance.
2344;Evey is Britney and V is Z.
2345;Weaving does a good job as V, especially since you do not see his face throughout the entire movie.
2346;Portman does a passable job as Evie, but is nothing spectacular.
2347;This movie is awesome and I can watch it everyday if given the chance.
2348;This movie is one of the best comic movies out there.
2349;Great acting all over this film I can't believe we didn't here more about it when it fists came out.
2350;This is a really great movie and I recommend it for everyone!
2351;"I've never read the graphic novel on which James McTeigue's ""V for Vendetta"" is based, but together with the late cinematographer Adrian Biddle, McTeigue certainly makes it unforgettable on the visual level."
2352;McTeigue gleefully ransacks images from art, literature, theater and cinema to create a film that is never boring and often compelling, even when.
2353;smith, John Standing and Sinead Cusack play their roles with absolute conviction, adding immeasurably to the film's impact.
2354;"In all, ""V for Vendetta"" is an entertaining if not totally satisfactory entry in the action."
2355;Natalie Portman does a great job in this movie, and the overall plot was very well executed.
2356;One of my favorite movies of all time!
2357;I saw this a few years ago, and it is really thought provoking, which is rare in movies nowdays.
2358;It makes you wonder how easy it could be to create a dictatorship in which the few own the powerful, especially since nowdays the media will participate because they care more about ratings than reporting.
2359;And he warns that next year it will be the Houses of Parliament.
2360;His vendetta is one of personal vengeance.
2361;His explosions are theater, complete with musical scores and fireworks.
2362;"So ""V for Vendetta"" is uniquely unsuited to comment on terrorism."
2363;"If you want to see a movie about revolutionary politics and terrorism, see ""The Battle of Algiers"", Gillo Pontecorvo's masterpiece of political cinema that has the added benefit of being true."
2364;Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish, and French.
2365;Dubbing is available in French (Canadian).
2366;this is a great film.
2367;I actually own two copies of V for Vendetta, yea, it's that good.
2368;All I'm going to say is that it's an amazing movie.
2369;Hugo did an amazing job with V, as did the set and clothing designers, writers, and director.
2370;The movie was just great, period.
2371;I also thought they did a great job portraying and using the chancellor, in the novel he wasn't nearly as involved.
2372;over all it is a very good movie, it sends a very powerful message.
2373;Words can have a piece of us and the best parts of us if we let them flow from our hearts.
2374;this is for me the power of this movie.
2375;Watch it and see and know that words and feeling that we put behind them is the possible power we contain.
2376;Love and creativity expressed and by their expression a chance.
2377;enough plot summary though, as I assure you that this movie will be worth your while.
2378;Because once again, this film is smart and action.
2379;One more positive note, is that even though the situation is foreign (and not just by nationality), there is some commonality for all to relate to and dig into.
2380;So, what can I say, except see it, like it, love it.
2381;Otherwise it's a pretty good action flick and a good reason to check the power of the state.
2382;Overall, a good entertaining movie.
2383;A great film about the toughness, fearlessness, and ruthlessness required to overcome a totalitarian government.
2384;The portrayal is excellent .
2385;This is easily the best film that I have seen in the early stages of 2006.
2386;The acting is great, with the faceless Hugo Weaving playing V with great physical presence and an intelligent voice.
2387;Natalie Portman turns in one of her best performances here which shocked me to say the least.
2388;She even looks hot bald!
2389;The visuals, music, set design, and action scenes are perfect without being overdone.
2390;This is a thinking action film, heavy with smart dialogue and interesting ideas.
2391;apocalyptic stories, I had read the graphic novel by Alan Moore many years ago.
2392;But to the credit of the interpreters, this onscreen adaptation was for the most part, well crafted.
2393;The ideology, the philosophy, mostly intact.
2394;The action, like the comic book, takes a big back seat.
2395;I remember when I read the comic book, that part was absolutely monumental.
2396;It was the soul behind the story.
2397;he wasnt greater than man.
2398;And if you play close attention to the subtle parallels, it played like a MICHAEL moore story.
2399;What a great and powerful film.
2400;A true adaption of a graphic novel.
2401;The performances were great, the story was fantastic.
2402;Hugo Weaving as V is charismatic and Natalie Portman is very bold.
2403;Graphic novel fans check this out.
2404;A 5 star win for Vertigo/DC Comics.
2405;Excellent cinematography, solid editing and directing, and a good performance from Portman and a superb and brilliant performance from Weaving.
2406;I haven't read the original story/graphic novel, but I really enjoyed the visuals and idealistic beliefs portrayed in the film.
2407;Hopefully this film wakes the silent majority up!A thoroughly spellbinding and enjoyable experience, a must see.
2408;V For Vendetta is very thought provoking, has great action scenes, and everyone played their part well.
2409;The message that it sent really made you think and it had a great story, but for the entertainment part I felt it was lacking.
2410;But I have a feeling alot of people will like it.
2411;Suspenseful, dramatic, mysterious with fantastic acting.
2412;Story was put together perfectly.
2413;V's voice alone will draw anyone into this movie.
2414;It was one of the best movies I have ever seen.
2415;that is all I will say.
2416;Great dialog, acting, and action.
2417;I had high hope for this movie as I hoped that the Matrix producers had recovered the fumble of Matrix: Reloaded and the pass for an interception aka Matrix: Revolution.
2418;The action sequences were great though.
2419;Still, it was great entertainment.
2420;This is a fantastic movie, every minute, was well thought out, and therefore inturn well enjoyed.
2421;There is action, there is plot, there is love, and drama.
2422;This film has it all.
2423;V for Vendetta is a highly intelligent, fascinating and ambitious movie.
2424;The filmmakers present a story that dares to be thought provoking, unsettleing, and inspiring all at once.
2425;to make such a film was courageous.
2426;driven story that functions on many levels.
2427;A suspense thriller, a mystery, a political film and an action movie.
2428;the plot changes and twists as the story unfolds are unique to this film.
2429;A truly remarkable motion picture.
2430;what I am most impressed by is the commentary that is quite naturally found in this movie.
2431;The theme is quite old, but wonderfully universal.
2432;Though the references seems a little cliche at times, they are quite effective.
2433;This is the greatest strength of sci.
2434;This was the purest strength of The Matrix.
2435;But of course this time around, the stakes are higher, in that a mysterious biogenic weapon has created a lot of hysteria about terrorists and has given the government power to keep tabs on EVERYONE (sound familiar?)
2436;some criticisms of this movie have decried the close connections of V to actual terrorists, but V clearly has a purpose to bring society together rather than tear it apart.
2437;hugo Weaving, a brilliant actor (Mr. Smith) is stunning in this, though his face is rarely ever visible.
2438;in all, this was an excellent movie.
2439;I have seen this movie about 5 times and I love it.
2440;it gives you something to think about.
2441;Because, I love this movie that's why!!!
2442;Great plot that is easy to follow.
2443;Great supporting cast from the lead detective, the news anchors, the chancelor and all the rest.
2444;She could easily have become an over the top super heroine, but instead maintained her status as one of the common folk dealing with circumstances.
2445;Now there is an excellent piece of work.
2446;All of these fine performances are done in what is almost a comic book movie.
2447;I've seen this movie several times and have enjoyed it every time.
2448;This one goes beyond the action film.
2449;This one gives characters with depth.
2450;This one is easy to recommend to others.
2451;"Stereo in greek means ""solid"" for their information."
2452;They r strero types, solid types, hard to change and it costs a lot for them to feel anything.
2453;Ironically the movie is really making fun of those types in the first place in a very brilliant way.
2454;minded people this movie which helps us to understand the world of today better.
2455;Especially Valerie's letter in the movie written in prison is soo touching and emotional.
2456;the moviescript in the whole movie is so great and it is so brilliantly written.
2457;Especially it corresponds to the feelings of the characters so well.
2458;Best you can see it while Valerie's letter is read.
2459;i could write more and more, but in the end I would say the same: A great movie always to remember.
2460;Thanks to everyone who contributed to its creation.
2461;I was very pleased with this movie.
2462;Intense action with a great plot line.
2463;"This movie tells a story of a Dystopian government, and a mysterious man, known simply as ""V,"" who is trying to knock some sense into the citizens."
2464;I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes books like 1984 or the Hunger Games.
2465;wow, this movie gets bad reviews from conservatives only????
2466;Come on, people, this film is great.
2467;the film in itself is well shot, mounted, and has a good pace.
2468;The special effects are very subtle, but that is what makes them great.
2469;You will like the character V, but you will LOVE to hear him talk.
2470;the story is very cool, and the characters in the movie are well fleshed out.
2471;The pivotal detail appears later in the movie, but the sequence of events and motives are clear throughout the film.
2472;None of this will matter b/c it is a great show regardless of the story's origins or duration.
2473;also the action, drama, and story line is so amazing to fallow, i love all the art in it to.
2474;this movie shows the true embodiment of humanity that there is.
2475;Not exactly like the comic book version but was good nonetheless.
2476;Produced by The Matrix's Wachowski brothers, and directed stylishly by then.
2477;newcomer James McTeigue, this roaring, action.
2478;packed flick manages a rare brand of intelligence and lucratively enthuses the idea that citizens run by governments are nave to the confines of such leadership and are too quick to conform.
2479;owed delivery of a film equally rich in smarts and entertainment value.
2480;This movie was very moving.
2481;This movie was emotional and sent me through some loops of emotion and I had a blast watching it, and a blast evaluating his words and actions.
2482;regardless of how much you actually wind up liking this movie .
2483;you will probably like it more if you see it after having read the source material.
2484;"it's not by any means a perfect film or adaptation, but it did very well in bringing the story and feel of ""V"" to the theatre."
2485;I even liked the occasionally heavy.
2486;Honestly, I found myself shocked that I liked it so much, given how much was changed around, usually that really annoys me and ruins the movie for me.
2487;But I found myself moved, enjoying it, happy with it.
2488;Well done!Since others have said so well the general things I would say, I want to bring up some specifics .
2489;She was haunting the mostly.
2490;It set things up nicely.
2491;runner who eventually got killed by Ally and the rest of Creedy's gangster thugs.
2492;And it was after he got killed that Evey got captured and put into solitary .
2493;which brings me to Creedy and his gangster thugs.
2494;In the book, Creedy eventually began developing an intricate plot to take control from the Leader, and this involved getting in with Helen as well as violent criminals and powerful gangs, who did work for him under the table.
2495;And his mistress Helen, wife of one of the other Fingermen, had him nearly completely manipulated in a scheme to power, as she did various others.
2496;They cut out Conrad and Ally killing each other, and Helen's fall from power.
2497;the area above the subway .
2498;I definitely recommend anyone and everyone to watch this movie, and even more so, to read the book(s) .
2499;So it's four stars, though I'd give it a 4.5 if I could.
2500;"That aside, the film version of V For Vendetta isn't all bad, and it has some great moments and echos the atmosphere of the comic, but the changes made by the Wachowski Brothers downplays the morality tale that Moore so brilliantly weaved in the 80's when he foresaw a bleak and totalitarian future
2501;The sets, design (V's outfit has been wonderfully re.
2502;created) and action scenes are all well done, mainly by most of the crew members who worked on the Matrix films, and James McTeigue makes a solid debut as a director"
2503;John Hurt is here as Sutler, the maniacal zealot Chancellor, and while it's good to see both Stephen Rea and Stephen Fry in big roles in a big picture, particularly Rea as the disenchanted inspector who has been assigned to the case.
2504;This is one of my favorite all time movies.
2505;Great movie that looks at what could happen if people give up their freedoms for security.
2506;It has all the elements of a great storyline, comedy, action and truth.
2507;I considered it a great example of how people can get together for a common cause.
2508;This was done using an action based thriller theme.
2509;I went to see V for Vendetta with an open mind, and walked away rather satisfied.
2510;I was first impressed with the production values of this movie.
2511;It is very well done, with a decent script (although title character V mutters so much political mumbo.
2512;Wonderful main character (Hugo Weaving) and Natalie Portman does an outstanding job as well.
2513;The movie is intelligent and very well done.
2514;"Best line from movie: ""The people shouldn't fear the government."
2515;The film raises several interesting philosophical questions but ultimately it is severely damaged by the type of political correctness all too often seen emanating from Hollywood.
2516;The movie also speaks to the power of symbolism and symbolic actions.
2517;In today's world it is political correctness that poses the greatest totalitarian threat.
2518;The government continues to grow and impinge upon the liberties of American citizens.
2519;Affirmative action and abortion continue to grow in magnitude.
2520;It will make you think, it will make you wonder.
2521;Definitely on the favorite list of must see movies.
2522;It was very convenient on the fifth of November and my roommate really enjoyed it as well.
2523;"either one is really enjoyable on their own, the book is a masterpiece, and the movie is really well done, considering it's by the ""Matrix"" brothers, which had me worried that it was going to be really dumb."
2524;my advice is to read the book and watch the movie, but keep them separate in your mind, because that's the only way you can fully enjoy the movie.
2525;She is wonderful with her fake Brit accent.
2526;Fear is a very real weapon most goverments have already learned to weld to shrink civil rights in the name of national secruity.
2527;Again, it's a good film, just not a great one.
2528;It's a gift too kno b4 hand about the value of a movie!
2529;There are some discrepancies, of course, but the film as a whole is highly successful and very entertaining.
2530;v for Vendetta is very well cast with loveable and hateable foils that make the film easy to follow.
2531;Portman is a joy as usual (not always).
2532;She is more than sufficient and brings much to her role as Evey.
2533;However, the heart of her character is the same, and Portman does her finest, most touching work since Closer.
2534;V is well cast as well.
2535;I actually like the voice of Weaving coming from beneath that mocking mask, and his chemistry with Portman is remarkable considering that they are never actually face.
2536;The air of revolution is thick with ideals and freedom, and one can actually see the people coming to life.
2537;I also think that the ending scenes are beautifully handled as the country transforms from a society of drones to one of individuals.
2538;I think that most anybody can enjoy this movie, if only for its incredible action and surprising sensitivity.
2539;Remember, remember this film forever.
2540;I would go so far to say that this movie is in the top 10 best movies of all time, hands down.
2541;Hundreds of quotable lines, a pure and original story, a mystifying and intriguing protagonist and pure action.
2542;That said, I came open.
2543;"lets start off with the things ""V for Vendetta"" does remarkably well: Dialogues and action."
2544;"vis an introduction, and so it is my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V.""The paradoxical intention of such lines are brilliant
2545;The paradoxical setting continues throughout the rest of the movie, V having both a human side and at the same time beeing a monster with revenge as only intention.
2546;A brilliant line, one of the best I've heard in a LONG time.
2547;the dialogical brilliance continues with lines that sometimes are not that deep or intruding, yet make a great contribution for the whole package, and let you understand more about the situation at that point, one step (line) at a time.
2548;For example:Evey Hammond: """"Artists use lies to tell the truth."""
2549;He even marks his actions with that quote: it's part of who he is, and more importantly, it's also part of who Evey is.
2550;thirdly, it ofcourse reveals the situation, beeing it covering the truth.
2551;i can go on and on about the dialogues, but let's move on: the action.
2552;Seeing this movie would probably be the best if you see it in the theater (ok, most movies would), because of the intense feeling of the music coming up with every big event (first and last event of the movie).
2553;It gives the symbol of explosion extra meaning like V says.
2554;The building is a symbol, as is the act of destroying it.
2555;Symbols are given power by their people.
2556;When it comes to the action scenes itself, they are great, but not brilliant.
2557;And that is what happens here: the mediocre parts should have been better, and great parts should have been brilliant.
2558;You should care for it, feel it, be intrigued by that relationship.
2559;"to conclude, ""V for Vendetta"" is great."
2560;The dialogues are superb, and the action is to support the story.
2561;Is this a good movie?
2562;The adaptation makes a few changes, especially in the final third or so of the story.
2563;Some of the changes are good, some are bad, but for the most part, this is an outstanding movie that manages to be faithful to the source material while still forging its own path.
2564;The emotional lynchpin of the story remains intact, and that alone is enough to have me recommend it to anyone who likes good, well.
2565;Absolutely the most powerful movie I've ever seen!!!
2566;The most brilliant story and cast and filming.
2567;The characters are so well played!
2568;It's very tense and it's getting tenser to the end of the movie.
2569;a try peace of art!
2570;The top of my list!
2571;I have to say that V for Vendetta is one of my favorite movies of all time.
2572;it is a powerful and moving story, and packs a powerful punch to the establishment who should be quaking in their boots at the prospect of V for Vendetta becoming a cult movie similar to the Matrix trilogy.
2573;watch the movie and become enlightened.
2574;I chose this rating because rarely do you see a film this interesting, engaging, and thought provoking.
2575;JusticeLaw here and we see it in every action he takes, even semi.
2576;I'll need to read the comic and so will you!
2577;It is very thought provoking and on target for what we are facing today.
2578;christian society that is a godless man and thinks our country is his toy and that we work for his enjoyment.
2579;The film brings these ideas to light and there true consiquences to light.
2580;If there were concerns on an artistic front, Lloyd would be the one, but this is essentially a COMIC BOOK story fleshed out with live actors and special effects and it's all extremely well done and true to the source, i. e. a COMIC BOOK.
2581;as a movie, it's a lot of fun to watch, and makes a lot more sense than the soft.
2582;top without resorting to Star Wars platitudes or Johnny Depp ham.
2583;There is a fair amount of ironic US.
2584;That helps enormously in a film.
2585;The director got the point of letting the graphics help tell the story and set the tone.
2586;Still, it's a good film.
2587;for everyone else, enjoy the film, it's a good story that ought to be told in these times.
2588;It was used, but in good condition and for a great price.
2589;I just love this flick.
2590;The story is superb as is the acting.
2591;The antidote to a totalitarian state is revealed in this movie.
2592;Watch this movie and spread the word!!!
2593;Excellent movie with great character actors and top notch dialogue.
2594;If you like dramatic and thought provoking movies with a great hero / anti.
2595;hero main character, you will like this movie.
2596;but the film has scenes of such power and skill that it lingers in the memory far more than more accomplished but less ambitious movies.
2597;One of my all time favorite movies!
2598;Great story I feel it does justice to the graphic novel.
2599;This is a timely yet timeless film, that should give us much to ponder about how each of us is responsible for the world we allow to shape us.
2600;Best intelligent thriller I've ever watched .
2601;kept you on the edge of your seat throughout .
2602;hats off to Hugo Weaving, as his portrayal of V stays close to Moore's original character, in every respect .
2603;(excellent elocution by Hugo Weaving!)
2604;"binding, and ever mesmerizing
2605;V for Vendetta is a return to the political science fiction movie.
2606;Big brother has developed and the state controls the media.
2607;The film is very dark and shot much of the time in shadows which heightens the intensity beautifully.
2608;Hugo Weaving is good as V and John Hurt makes a creepy high chancellor.
2609;This is a very good film and thought provoking.
2610;It is certainly suspensefull, but it can also be sci fi or a political movie.
2611;This is a fun science fiction film.
2612;It is a new Brave New World big brother is here and it is not too far off.
2613;Rarely does a movie based on a comic book get it right on the level that this film does.
2614;The storyline is just brilliant.
2615;It really makes you think about politics and the government that exist in the real world as well as the media.
2616;reading the origional comic of V for Vendetta is like any great book, timeless.
2617;instead of preserving a possibly poignant message and making a great movie, the writers and directors have created something entirely """"NOW""""."""
2618;This is a great movie .
2619;I equate this movie to a modern.
2620;it emphasizes freedom of thought.
2621;Wow, this movie was great!
2622;I am a lifetime comics fan and love Alan Moore.
2623;I think this film actually improves upon the source material, and does it with syle and panache.
2624;The film raises important issues about fear, freedom, judgement, censorship and terrorism.
2625;This film is well worth owning.
2626;Natalie Portman is great and Hugo Weaving is sensational.
2627;"V for very, as in very entertaining
2628;The cast and crew did an excellent job in bringing this story life.
2629;The storyline is highly plausible in today's world of political and social extremism.
2630;An outstanding movie with a strong underlining and relevant social theme.
2631;It is a must see.
2632;I enjoyed watching the movie each and every time.
2633;I always learned something more whever I watched the movie
2634;This is one of the best movies ever made from a graphic novel.
2635;I recommend watching The Count of Monte Cristo first.
2636;Great plot and plenty of action.
2637;The acting was very good and the film was well scripted.
2638;I'd love them to do this to The Stupids with Tom Arnold.
2639;It is a very action packed film with fight scenes to die for.
2640;and I feel it was overall one of my favorite movies.
2641;SO just relax and enjoy the film.
2642;Very good movie, lots of action, excellent acting, a potentially scary glimpse into our future?
2643;And Natalie is easy on the eyes :)
2644;I liked this movie a lot.
2645;It was extremely entertaining, and while I'm aware of how and why it varied from the graphic novel, I'm still not too bother by it, and I would for sure recommend watching it.
2646;Really good acting by Weaving and Portman by the way.
2647;The story is wonderfully crafted, and has many lessons to put towards politics in this country today.
2648;Hugo Weaving is a really impressive actor.
2649;you can see his emotions in his face, even though he is wearing a mask.
2650;it's good to have rich influential rebels in the mass media like the wachowski bros. aka matrix creators.
2651;It was refreshing to have a main character who is intelligent, well spoken, vicious but not hokey.
2652;Once you get passed the long long speech V gives in the alley way, the rest of the movie is incredible.
2653;Once you see the rest of it, you may find that beginning speech much more informative and inspirational.
2654;the cinematography and acting are wonderful.
2655;V's prose throughout the film is wonderfully spellbinding.
2656;I found myself alternately loving and hating this man.
2657;the movie is nevertheless highly enjoyable.
2658;Interwoven throughout the movie are several love stories.
2659;Great story and performance by Portman.
2660;The movie starts and ends well.
2661;Keeps you wanting for more.
2662;This is a great box set and a great movie.
2663;This is one of the most subtle and enlightening movies that i have ever seen.
2664;The Wachowskis have done something that is far better than the Matrix trilogy, not for its' action, but for its' plot.
2665;And I thank them for making a movie that actually makes a person use their brains.
2666;The musical score was absolutely stunning for lack of a better word.
2667;You will be very pleasantly surprised.
2668;If you haven't read the comic, go ahead and see the movie, but then go and read the far superior book.
2669;hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman (surprisingly) both provide very solid performances as V and Evey, and the design of the film was perfect.
2670;My only problems are the changes to the script which diluted the original story and replaced it with a happy and unambiguous ending.
2671;There are at least four important scenes in the original book's narrative"
2672;As it stands, its an engaging piece of entertainment but not anything more.
2673;Even if the movie was flawed, it opened up a much.
2674;good price for a movie.
2675;"Brave New World has been the ghost behind ""Fahrenheit 451"", ""THX1138"", ""Gattika"", ""1984"" and ""A Clockwork Orange""."
2676;This character, a very well educated, cultured individual dead set on bringing down the Orwellian nightmare that is all around him, draws the grateful young girl into his world, giving her selective information on himself, judging her own possible inclination toward rebellion.
2677;"Hugo Weaving gives a terrific performance as the cultured ""V"", amazing you with his eloquence and style, not to mention his ruthlessness and determination in his mission."
2678;Another fine performance is given by John Hurt, as the main villain in the piece, the grand leader of the dystopic government, Chancellor Adam Suttler.
2679;Weaving's subtle, sometimes graceful performance, (the violent scenes are choreographed like ballet!)
2680;You are constantly amazed at: how well informed he is, how cultured he is, and how intelligent and resourceful and adept he is.
2681;"Somebody doesn't like Blair's Britain, eh wot?A VERY intriguing movie that gives the whole ""1984"" storyline a new spin."
2682;This is one of the rare movies that I've watched multiple times.
2683;And every time I watch, it still has the same powerful effect on me.
2684;although the action is good, what makes this movie truly great is the message it conveys.
2685;"After you watch the movie, look out of the window, you will see that the movie is playing in real life in the ""good ole' America."""
2686;It's happening in the U. s. with the Patriot Act and the like.
2687;more than just pointing out the objective reality, the movie will give you a sense of hope.
2688;It is really moving to see thousands of people in their V masks marching in unison.
2689;"Being disfigured beneath the mask
2690;It was a great film but I have to wonder if any of the best parts were left on the cutting room floor.
2691;I keep seeing these great reviews of this movie.
2692;Acting performances are some of the best you will ever see.
2693;Natalie Portman is fantastic as well as Hugo Weaving.
2694;V spends a good portion of the film donning his mask and debonair get.
2695;funded experiments, concentration camps, etc.
2696;He rescues and befriends a cute.
2697;as action films go this one certainly has a bit of brains and is, by far, better than most.
2698;and it is directed with style and flare by James McTeigue.
2699;it's pretty good by the way .
2700;hugo Weaving is amazing as """"V"""", his voice was made for this movie and he poured himself into the character."""
2701;Love the movie and it's characters, the message it sends and the way it is portrayed!
2702;political environs and reaches across the vast expanse of historical precedent, social experience and collective conscience.
2703;Precious few works of art in our post.
2704;aggrandizement have accomplished such feats with such ease.
2705;Symbols are both powerful subservise agents as well as liberating ones.
2706;perhaps the most relevant and wonderful reference is to that of Edmond Dantes.
2707;V's struggle parallels Edmond's to the T. Imprisoned in a tower, receiving notes from a stranger, escaping, living a life of luxury free want want, surrounded by great works of art, yet still hidden from his true self, tormented by demons long thought exorcised.
2708;Vengeance, remembrance, forgiveness, redemption and love.
2709;All of which add to the power of its message.
2710;Orwellian references aside, more powerful and sinister forces are at work around us.
2711;and what we are presented here with is a well crafted, cogent message to be heeded.
2712;Wachowski brothers never upsets me with their timely, relevant, deep thought provoking movies with a great spiritual message.
2713;This is a great movie for who ever craves for freedom,logic, decency and purpose in every day reality.
2714;"Though a Movie, it has the potential for revealing the ""man behind the Mask"" in our everyday political fascist reality."
2715;great movie ,a must see for every man in the civilized world.
2716;And you have to love the Guy Fawkes masks.
2717;So the ending has a huge meaning!
2718;The story isfilled with spiritual messages as we are now accustomedto after seeing the Matrix trilogy.
2719;It shows us what wemust accomplish on the spiritual path.
2720;and how do we accomplish this?
2721;we must take up our crosses and follow Jesus, we mustlose our lifes in Christ's name to gain life.
2722;We mustcut through the illusion (maya) created by our egosand find our true (inner)selves and find Love.
2723;an upgrade on 1984 that presents the important message with pieces of warm emotion ie love and music !
2724;What makes this movie the 2nd best movie I've ever seen is the fact that it was very very very well done in a very very very smart story that thins adrenaline in everyone that believes what we live now is a hoax made by governments to deceive people and have the ruled the way the government wants.
2725;provoking in a way that is quite rare for Hollywood.
2726;I believe this is a film that will become more revered with age.
2727;Sure these are themes that have been seen before (it was based on a graphic novel written in the 1980's after all) but I think the themes are still very important today.
2728;"This is the second best film of 2006 (2nd only to DePalma's ""The Black Dahlia"")."
2729;"The political statements about ""terrorism"" and how it can be induced by the very same goverment that's supposed to protect us is something that mirrors our own society today."
2730;so they will believe all the lies and continue to live in fear really hits close to home.
2731;independant thought is becoming the norm, and listening to fools and the general masses is something that's promoted as the way to follow.
2732;That has become such a prophetic statement, and it's dealt with very openly in this film.
2733;"In a great reference to ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""1984"", ""Logan's Run"", ""Brave New World"", ""Blade Runner"", ""They Live"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""Metropolis"", and Micheal Moore's documentary ""Farenheit 9/11"", the Wachowski brothers deliver their best film since ""Bound""."
2734;"We as a nation need to wake up and bond together and say ""Stop!"""
2735;Oh, and, the British humor thrown in midway through via a television show is pure geniuos!This is an important and entertaining movie that you'll want to view over and over.
2736;It's political and romantic, and very intelligent.
2737;I absolutely loved this movie.
2738;tiny little speck and blew it up and put a new dress on it.
2739;This is without a doubt a modern day masterpiece!
2740;It is a great film that deals with the freedoms of speech, thought, and religion being stripped away from us in a facist community, allowing a government to rule over the people instead of the people ruling the government, as it was intended when the government for the people, by the people was created.
2741;"this is the second best film of 2006 (2nd only to De Palma's ""The Black Dahlia"")."
2742;"The political statements about ""terrorism"" and how it can be induced by the very same government that's supposed to protect us is something that mirrors our own society today."
2743;I highly recommend this film, especially to anyone who knows the REAL reality of our fascist state.
2744;so they will believe all the lies and continue to live in fear really hits close to home.
2745;independent thought is becoming the norm, and listening to fools and the general masses is something that's promoted as the way to follow.
2746;That has become such a prophetic statement, and it's dealt with very openly in this film.
2747;"In a great reference to ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""1984"", ""Logan's Run"", ""Brave New World"", ""Blade Runner"", ""They Live"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""Metropolis"", and Michael Moore's documentary ""Farenheit 9/11"", the Wachowski brothers deliver their best film since ""Bound""."
2748;"We as a nation need to wake up and bond together and say ""Stop!"""
2749;It's political and romantic, and very intelligent.
2750;Oh, and, the British humor thrown in midway through via a television show is pure genius!
2751;Very well written, brilliantly directed, and intensely acted by a topnotch cast!
2752;This is my favorite movie of all time.
2753;This movie basically describes everything that this country is going through right under our noses.
2754;I watch this movie once a month.
2755;Guy Fawkes day is coming up.
2756;Depicted quite well how the media reports the official story of events rather than investigating events.
2757;This movie was visually stunning and I thought very well acted.
2758;portman is really turning into a great actress.
2759;And the supporting characthers were very human and believable.
2760;i was astounded at how timely this movie was.
2761;This was a very enjoyable movie, and I keep coming back over and over to watch it.
2762;I have thoroughly enjoyed not only the dialogue, but the overall tone of unity in the movie.
2763;I got this as a gift for my son.
2764;It is a gripping story, well told, with graphically interesting design, in chiaroscuro and employs good actors at the revealing junctures.
2765;I thoroughly enjoyed this move from start to finish.
2766;In my opinion this is a feel good movie where the hero is willing to die for what he believes in.
2767;A fine film which has one guessing quite a way through it.
2768;I never read the comic book on which it is based, but it is a fine story of the human spirit and the craving for justice, A must see.
2769;i actually liked this movie.
2770;Natalie did a great job.
2771;Sometimes the visuals were amazing.
2772;The acting was great and Hugo Weaving was fantastic, doing more acting even though he wore a mask than most actors do when they aren't wearing a mask.
2773;Good performances from two Stephens, Frey and Rea.
2774;overall, I liked the movie.
2775;It was solid, entertaining, and well executed.
2776;But then the day that Hollywood realizes that comic books can be great source material for more than just action/adventure movies.
2777;well, that will be a revolution!
2778;This movie is already a masterpiece and watching it in full high.
2779;So many people, including myself, viewed this movie as Left.
2780;"like and militaristic methods of the UK government in this film are a bit ""right."
2781;Umm, First Amendment rights violation right there.
2782;It's a modern day parable and hence thought provoking.
2783;Nevertheless, the action and acting make the story interesting.
2784;This movie is very thought provoking and leads you down the path of whose in control, what might control us (media/government), and what is our willingness to break free.
2785;This film is a masterpiece of graphic novel to silver screen.
2786;acting all is first rate.
2787;I love it, not in ignorance of its not.
2788;The movie definitely hit my passions there, and that's why I love it.
2789;"have.you, and ""revolutionaries"" or ""freedom fighters""."
2790;"V is accepted as a ""revolutionary"" and the government as ""tyrannical""."
2791;I thought the ending was appropriate and stirring up to that point: the marching by the unarmed civilians against the army, that passive non.
2792;violent resistance, I thought, better resonated with the themes I loved about the movie which I thought were also its best qualities.
2793;America's founding fathers knew this, and it is simple common sense.
2794;This is a great movie.
2795;The Wachowsky brothers bring you a story based on those characters, and what a story it is.
2796;'V' is awesome on Blu.
2797;the image is top rate as well.
2798;the story line is enjoyably complex and makes you think hard about political and moral implications of decisions of government and how the general populous might be manipulated.
2799;It's a movie I can watch over and over.
2800;It was the best movie ever!Lots of great action and fight scenes.
2801;You have got to see this movie.
2802;It makes a great political message.
2803;so go see this movie today!!
2804;This drama is pretty applicable to our times.
2805;Enjoyable, a bit gothic, albeit science fiction.
2806;The Wachowski brothers' virtual opera prima (The Matrix Trilogy) is one of the few movies that I have absolutely and completely watched in awe.
2807;And I just hope that kids out there that watch these movies just for the fun of the amazing aesthetics and the overwhelming digital effects somehow get to see beyond the surface and dare to explore the undergrounds.
2808;V fought the old school way with sharp words and long daggers.
2809;in an artsy idealistic kind of way.
2810;My wife and I frequent the movies.
2811;Having never read the graphic novel, and by seeing this movie on a sheer whim I have to say that V is one of the best contemporary action films to come out in the last decade.
2812;I've never seen a movie that combines such fresh action sequences with such intellectual dialogue and comtemporary social and political issues.
2813;The cinematography is just incredible.
2814;Warped and twisted but watch it.
2815;It is deeper than the initial impression it gives.
2816;Compares to Brave new world' or to 1984 to give everyone something to think about.
2817;THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A MAJOR PLOT SPOILER!I should start by admitting outright that I did enjoy many parts of the V for Vendetta movie (primarily those that remained truest to the source material), and by stating my agreement with other reviewers familiar with thegraphic novelon which it was based that it is the best film adaptation of an Alan Moore work to date.
2818;mouth tyrant, the movie completely robs the story of the psychological complexity found in the book.
2819;sPOILER ALERT!It is eventually revealed that the ruling party orchestrated the nationwide plague that precipitated its rise to power years earlier.
2820;right wing nut job though he may be.
2821;And while the Wachowskis chose to demonize their movie's version of Moore's High Chancellor, they also decided to subtly humanize V.
2822;V's feigned conversation on the roof of the Old Bailey, in which he explains his reasons behind abandoning Justice for Anarchy, is one of the greatest monologues in graphic literature (despite some of the misogynistic terminology V employs) and makes it clear that V's goals are just as lofty as Adam Susan's (regardless of how one might feel about how either character goes about achieving them).
2823;Likewise my other favorite scene, V's address to the British nation via the State's own pirated airwaves, was transformed from a stinging indictment of political apathy and rousing appeal for personal responsibility, into an invocation of some unspecified type of democracy every bit as vague and uninspiring as any real presidential address.
2824;"In the book, which I consider the most eloquent, moving, and gripping endorsement of anarchism ever written (in comics or anywhere else), V presents readers with ""another way"" that offers ""new life [and] hope reinstated."""
2825;This is a great politcally driven hero movie.
2826;This is a movie that dwells on the rights of humanity, freedom, and the passion we all should have about the powers that be within our governments.
2827;It's set in Europe, but you can relate to the story easily.
2828;It doesn't have a lot of action, but the action is done really well and smoothe.
2829;Let us start with the premise that V is an excellent movie and work from there.
2830;The idea behind the film is timely .
2831;The acting is overall good and sometimes approached excellent as well, yet.
2832;the plot is 4.5, sets and direction, 5, acting 4 and message 5.
2833;It is a film worth watching and film worth owning .
2834;remember, remember the 5th of November.
2835;This one is one of my all time favorites!
2836;It's difficult to understand on one viewing but the story is good!
2837;The reds were superb, one of my favorite colors to judge how faithfully the color rendition is.
2838;There are links to actual movie reviews for this film so I will end here: [.]
2839;This is a great movie!
2840;I love the acting the plot and the action.
2841;Portman did a great job but overall its one of those movies that wont be so memorable you will be talking about it the next day.
2842;I just did finally watch the movie the other day though and was very pleased.
2843;It presented the story in a much clearer and cohesive fashion.
2844;they did a better job telling the story than you did.
2845;although the art was nice, I can recommend the movie.
2846;and I'd honestly give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.
2847;i cant help seeing simularites between the film and what our goverment is doing to day in the name of 'Keeping us SAFE'!
2848;The most important thing about the movie is that all you need to know is in it.
2849;They've succeeded quite well, from my point of view.
2850;the extras are very good on the disks.
2851;My highest rating for a movie.
2852;I make love to women.
2853;Alan Moore is an ascended master of the English language.
2854;the movie takes a few characters and a few good notes from Alan Moore's book.
2855;There are a lot of comments on here about how people think that it's too preachy.
2856;The dentist is clearly the expert, and the patient clearly wants the tool in their mouth.
2857;duddies feel comfortable telling gay men and women what they can put in whose mouth?
2858;I look into a glass darkly, but I want to and will one day see God face to face, as he sees me.
2859;They've loved at the end of the barrel of a gun.
2860;This is a great action packed movie with some absolutely great visuals.
2861;Natalie Portman has an interesting role in this movie and she does a fairly good job.
2862;Check it you.you will enjoy it.
2863;I was watching this film once every week and I can still remember part of the scenarios and quotes from it.
2864;Is really a master piece.
2865;The year is 2020 and the people of Great Britain are blind.
2866;"britons' everyday world is very much like George Orwell's ""1984""."
2867;Language has morphed to the point where harmless words now carry a serious threat.
2868;powerful and can make people disappear without questions.
2869;She's rescued by a black clad figure in a Guy Fawkes mask.
2870;"he calls himself ""V.""V (Hugo Weaving) offers truth and hope to the British people."
2871;And V continues to spread the word to the British people.
2872;every book writer aspires to at least one good line per page.
2873;"I cannot say how many that translates to in movies, but ""V"" is beautifully and thoughtfully written."
2874;In addition, the acting on the part of the major characters is good as well.
2875;I understand it's available in IMAX format and I'd love to catch it on that kind of venue.
2876;"There is enough content to make ""V"" worth watching again."
2877;If you are under the age of 18, this movie will strike you as a profound and thought.
2878;If you are under the age of 22, but a late bloomer, it may also strike you as profound and thought.
2879;If you happen to be just under the age of 30, it will make you nostalgic for a short time ago, when a movie like this would strike you as profound and important.
2880;This movie had very entertaining action sequencesand excitement, if they would have left out allthe agenda propelling preaching it would havebeen quite entertaining.
2881;"It deftly exposes fascism and the insidious nature of power, while causing the viewer to consider for themselves the issues of privacy, civil liberties, abuse of power, terrorism, resistance, and whether under similar conditions we would be willing to give up our freedoms to a tyranical regime in exchange for ""protection""."
2882;"the actors hit their marks admirably, and the casting of Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith from The Matrix) as ""V"" is the ultimate in irony."
2883;"Additionally the plot, action and quirky Brittish setting are all ""spot on""."
2884;if you enjoy movies that make you think, this will be one of the best movies you'll see this year.
2885;This movie is great, I have watched it 4 times now.
2886;Great acting and the storyline is just like todays headlines of OWS demonstrations, and other things going on in the world.
2887;V for Vendetta and The first Matrix are their best films,even though they did not direct V for Vendetta.
2888;The story is so smart and really make's you think it gave my brain a workout, the first time I saw the movie in theaters just like the first time I saw the first Matrix.
2889;the fact that he has to do all his acting behind a mask and use body movements to really bring the character to life is a treat.
2890;Natalie Portman plays Evey and she gives a very strong performance and I love that she got her head shaved for the role even if they paid her to shave her head that's dedication to your art, cause women love their hair lol.
2891;john hurt is amazing as well he plays a cold sadistic dictator bastard to scary realism.
2892;I would compare it to the '1984' novel and movies, except this time the good guys win.
2893;The whole movie ends up feeling like, well, a comic book.
2894;this movie would have worked very well in the early eighties.
2895;The whole project felt like a big inside joke.
2896;"To elaborate
2897;let's hope that the brothers have another Matrix.
2898;sized hit with their next project.
2899;Until last year Moore's fellow great Frank Miller had suffered much the same fate, but 2005 should have seen the release of a great version of Miller's SIN CITY and Moore's V FOR VENDETTA.
2900;Now that there is a great film version of a Moore classic, the big question is whether anyone will be able to do the same thing with the greatest of all graphic novels, Moore's THE WATCHMEN.
2901;this is not merely one of the best film versions of a famous graphic novel"
2902;And frequent mention is made of the way the fascist government has redefined words, much as the Bush administration has.
2903;All of these elements have been subtly adapted from the novel to make them more relevant to the present situation.
2904;Can you enjoy the movie anyway?
2905;And thirty years from now people who weren't born when Bush was president would be able to enjoy it without understanding the context.
2906;Alan Moore's mysterious V is one of the most compelling heroes of the past couple of decades, a moral anarchist in William Godwin's original sense.
2907;The film as a whole is simultaneously constructed as a revenge narrative, as V deliberately destroys the entire system that made his creation possible, and a mystery tale, as Inspector Finch, played wonderfully by Stephen Rea, gradually unravels the cipher that is V.
2908;i liked just about everything about this film.
2909;Hugo Weaving was superb as V.
2910;One of the things I most enjoyed about the Matrix films was listening to Weaving's Agent Smith converse with Neo, not so much what he said as the way he said it.
2911;Given the mask, it is amazing that he was able to pull it off.
2912;I loved the look of V's outfit.
2913;The design of his costume and map are very faithful to David Lloyd's original artwork.
2914;The cast was very strong.
2915;I've mentioned Weaving and Rea, but for a political fantasy concerning the future a la Orwell, this has a wonderful assemblage of talent, with fine actors like Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Tim Piggott.
2916;She is such an intelligent actress and this comes out throughout her work.
2917;it does depart from the novel at several points, but all in all I thought the adaptation remarkably faithful to the book.
2918;One could also debate the ending, since in the novel Evey takes on the persona of V, even donning his costume to continue his work.
2919;all in all, this is a highly entertaining film that I can urge anyone to watch.
2920;It is one of those rare films that manage to combine both riveting action sequences with political commentary.
2921;If you enjoy movies about a totalitarian state, government control, etc, you will love this movie.
2922;The movie V for Vendetta has a story to tell.
2923;Its a very thought provoking film based on Alan Moore's graphicnovel V for Vendetta its a vertigo movie.
2924;And boy is it great!
2925;The movie, while it makes several sacrifices in terms of extraneous characters and such, also streamlines the story yet still makes it an incredibly unebelievable movie.
2926;The setting is very convincing.
2927;This strengthens the films impact.
2928;Spectacularly voices and acted by Hugo Weaving, V is an extremely intelligent man who, strangely, remains hidden behind a Guy Fawkes mask.
2929;If you really think V is a terrorist, that is excellent.
2930;Because that is the point of the movie.
2931;And that is a beautiful thing.
2932;everybody should see this film.
2933;It is thoughtful, delivers many themes and messages, and is chock full of symbolism and dialogue that will have you deciphering during your many viewings.
2934;A few documentaries, one or two are interesting, the rest not too noteworthy.
2935;Honestly, you either love it or you don't.
2936;This is the Best movie I have ever seen and i have seen a lot of movies.
2937;A good movie that sticks it to the government for its behind door ways of secrets against society for it own leaders moral purposes in the name of greater humanity.
2938;Portman and Hugo create good chemistry with a detective having he own second thoughts towards the government leadership.
2939;I really like this film!Natalie Portman's acting is so very good.
2940;like the X. man magneto he has abilities beyond the ordinary,like seeing without eyes and strength.
2941;Brilliant movie on so many levels.
2942;Very artistic in its own special way!
2943;The story got so topical that I got seriously emotional during a lot of parts.
2944;"Weaving did an excellent job with the mysterious title character ""V"", creating a poetic, intelligent, and compassionate yet ruthless character."
2945;She transforms completely throughout the movie.
2946;This movie also looked good in IMAX.
2947;Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving are phenomenal !
2948;This movie has so much to say politically and is very moving, action.
2949;You will definitely want to watch this again and again!
2950;hero definetly reminescent of that deranged genuis, the Phantom of the Opera, all in the best way possible.
2951;i truly loved the message.
2952;the world in which V and Evie and the others live is scarily accurate.
2953;In one of my favorite scenes, a purple.
2954;Go see it, and if you have, rock on.
2955;Hugo Weaving is brilliant, V's character comes through with only his voice and manner available to show emotions.
2956;That is scary, but this movie inspires hope for those who fight for truth and freedom.
2957;The Wachowski brothers have put together another great story without disappointment!
2958;Although Moore's brillant graphic novel of an anarchist against a faschist government is much darker, V for Vendetta tries its best and ends up with a slightly less impressive but totally worth it, spectacular film.
2959;talking, British humor makes the movie only better and more delicious to the eyes and ears.
2960;It's about freedom, its about anarchy against a corrupted government, its about England, but mostly its about the choices and the ideas you make that can change the world.
2961;V for Vendetta is the film you want to see with friends BEFORE dinner so that you can discuss it DURING dinner.
2962;Thank goodness the director and writers leave some unanswered.
2963;this is a powerful technique.
2964;"It will be interesting to see how critics relate this part of the film to the ""controversy"" over Brokeback Mountain."
2965;i tell you, this is a heck of a film.
2966;This movie is the best british movie ever and better than most movies made by Hollywood and it is so deep.
2967;I can't remember the last time I had such an emotional reaction to a film.
2968;First, the characterization in this film is nothing short of brilliant.
2969;The script is fantastic and they chose the right actors/actresses for the right rolls.
2970;scale sets with minute attention to detail, beautifully realistic model.
2971;Not only that, but the soundtrack is gorgeous.
2972;The orchestral themes are memorable, the use of secondary tunes appropriate and unobtrusive.
2973;most importantly, the story is rich and multi.
2974;when you add the superb (and highly emotional) character development as well as its historical allusions to November the fifth and Guy Fawkes, you get a film that is massive in scale.
2975;Given the medium, this adaptation is about as good as it could have been.
2976;I prefer the artwork though and it does come with a hilarious (although hidden) SNL skit featuring Natalie Portman.
2977;Number one of the year so far and a contender for my personal top five.
2978;I saw this movie days ago but it's still on my mind.
2979;This is a dark, brooding movie, yet Natalie Portman is beautiful and amazing, even against the dark world of this story.
2980;There are multiple facets happening in this film.
2981;Some viewers will take away one, some will take away a few more, and still some others will take away many.
2982;An awesome and haunting fantasy of the future.
2983;Excellent story, emotional musical score, and superb acting.
2984;Excellent analogy for what is going on in today's world.
2985;"alan Moore, the literary genius who wrote the spectacular graphic novel on which this mediocre action picture was based stated on numerous occasions that he did not approve of this adaptation of his work, that the work essentially ""got it wrong"" and missed the point of his book, and that he did not want to be associated with the film."
2986;(from an interview of Alan Moore on MTV, 8.30.06)The bottom line is that the Wachowskis and Silver took one of the most complex and intelligent books about dystopia, man's interaction with the state and the easy slide from democracy to fascism and turned it into a dumb action picture and low.
2987;This movie is a must own.
2988;It's a really great movie.
2989;The movie was beautifully written and had excellent acting.
2990;One of my favorite movies with Natalie Portman.
2991;V for Vendetta is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
2992;The score by Dario Marianelli is fantastic.
2993;Great story, great acting and a perfect pace.
2994;Great flick with plenty of special effects and great audio and it even has the semblance of a plot.
2995;"The most creative moments of ""V for Vendetta"" are during its flashy end credits, bathed in red, played over The Rolling Stones' ""Street Fighting Man."
2996;the movie is a tremendous artistic letdown.
2997;V merely wishes it so .
2998;"the Wachowski Brothers chose to adapt Alan Moore's graphic novel as their encore to ""The Matrix"" trilogy, inserting the second unit director from those films, James McTigue, as director here."
2999;And shy, observant Evey is the girl he'll come to love.
3000;run TV network and announces he will, in one year, finish what Fawkes started.
3001;He invites all of England to come and see.
3002;She succeeds, but eventually lands in state prison, where she is tortured to divulge V's whereabouts.
3003;Portman is especially invested and effective, and Stephen Rea, as a police inspector charged with finding V, pads his resume of taciturn, shambled cops.
3004;A friend of Evey's hides a Koran preserved in glass.
3005;a scarier, tougher movie goes right at the heart of V's thesis statement .
3006;Consider America's own twisted V .
3007;Raised on a rich diet of reciprocity, militarism and hatred, McVeigh nevertheless had an intriguing point to make about the violations of our Second Amendment gun rights.
3008;"just in case you forgot ""V For Vendetta"" was a fantasy."
3009;I thought it was very entertaining.
3010;This is a movie that you can watch more than once and still be entertained.
3011;What I have to say, though is that few words can adequately express the sheer awesomeness of this movie.
3012;So I'm going to make a couple up.
3013;And that's the fraz, man!
3014;But if you do see the connections, just remember it, and store the fact away.
3015;In tribute to its greatness and the delivery of its message.
3016;This is the best film I have yet to see this year.
3017;Like other reviewers, I love that it makes you think about the type of person you are.
3018;the Cinematography, special effects, and score are great.
3019;Superb acting, action sequence, plot.
3020;My son (age 39) loves this movie and watches it several times a year.
3021;I absolutely love this movie.
3022;"I like the movie version
3023;Action, message, awesome story, gorgeous Natalie Portman.
3024;Great movie, Keep you totally involved in a very unique story line.
3025;And the bonus of one of the best endings you'll ever see!
3026;My list of favorite movies has only 2 items.
3027;I watch it for the first time a week ago, and since then I watched 2 more times, and I admit it, I'm going to see it again tomorrow.
3028;Every time I walk out of the cinema I'm smiling and my energy is at its full.
3029;Evey's last words in the movie, that music, that image.
3030;that's the most beautiful movie scene I have ever seen.
3031;v is a truly charming character.
3032;The whole movie is thrilling to me, it's filled with amazing lines and points of view, but nothing compares to the final scene.
3033;It's the most bittersweet thing I have ever felt.
3034;It's the high point of a passion that started a long time ago and that is not shared by only one person, it is every person's dream.
3035;But the difference is that in this film there's change.
3036;And for me, that's what is really entertaining.
3037;There are awesome lessons and themes in this movie.
3038;The acting is pretty flawless and the ending is well done.
3039;The acting, the story, the message, the ideas all combine for more than a film.
3040;V For Vendetta' plays off the Fawkes legend, bringing it into the future with a sane and cultivated hero who hides behind a mask.
3041;washy convictions of 'V' it simply turned into a sappy movie with a few scenes of excellent knifework and some stylish photography.
3042;This movie does better than most in following a strong book.
3043;I recommend it to all fans of dystopian sci.
3044;purists should take note .
3045;that the film takes some liberties with the graphic novel's story.
3046;It's been updated to reflect the new fascist fears of today, as well as the power of television and internet.
3047;the themes of """"V"""" are timeless ."""
3048;and McTeague keeps this overall sense of menace and fear by showing us the new Hitler/Stalin, David Sutler (Susan in the graphic novel) mostly on television, just like everyone in that world sees him.
3049;The messages of the film are clear, and well presented.
3050;"Sometimes the pacing lags, and there are sharp changes of mood, such as the parody of Sutler on a chat show set to the tune of what I call the ""Benny Hill Rag"" (those who've watched the Benny Hill Show know what I'm talking about)."
3051;"Yet the strengths draw you in
3052;al., and the lush attention to detail in cinematography, as well as stage design.
3053;We are entertained after all, and called upon to think where we are heading as a people.
3054;While being entertaining, I think this movie grapples with some big and important questions.
3055;I couldn't help but think of this movie and wonder.
3056;aside from covering issues such as dictatorships, basic human rights, religious fundamentalism, homophobia, and government corruption, this movie is just simply entertaining.
3057;The special effects are well done and believable (for a super hero).
3058;V is a classic anti.
3059;my definition of a truly great movie is one that makes a person think, while they are being entertained.
3060;Thats the best he's got?
3061;But these two play their parts in a modified story that is remarkably absent of any emotional heft.
3062;the special effects of this movie are astounding, as could be expected from the team that put together the """"Matrix"""" movies."""
3063;explosions are handled expertly, as are several other combat and epic.
3064;V keeps the viewer at a distance from both V and Evey, even remarkably during Evey's wrenching detention scene.

3066;star production from start to finish.
3067;At the heart of every great movie .
3068;even a great action movie .
3069;there must be a great story.
3070;V takes what makes the graphic novel a special work and truncates it for blockbuster concerns.
3071;It's totally campy, but I love this movie.
3072;The action fighting is great, and the bad guys are exactly what you would expect.
3073;just wanted to show my support for this incredibly powerful movie.
3074;and for any of you out there looking to this movie just for some mind bending action since it's directed by the same guys as the Matrix.
3075;this movie is much deeper and greater than just satisfying eye candy and special FXs.
3076;this is a tale of V, it is a tale of Evey Hammond, it is a tale of a fascist government run by Chancellor Sutler, impeccably played by John Hurt, it is a tale of revenge, it is a tale of mass conspiracy, it is a tale of love, it is a tale of so much more.
3077;The complexity of the plot delighted me.
3078;He wears the mask through the entire film and the emotion he portrays using various methods is a total credit to his phenomenal talent as an actor.
3079;I truly fell in love with V. natalie Portman is magnificent as well.
3080;She is so beautiful and a natural actress.
3081;Her performance, particularly her interactions with V, are absolutely beguiling.
3082;stephen Rea is also excellent as Chief Inspector Finch.
3083;The entire cast does a wonderful job bringing this film to life.
3084;Being a Matrix fan, I loved the dark and gloomy, but slick look of V for Vendetta.
3085;i would greatly urge you to ride along with V, Evey and Finch on this fantastic and eye.
3086;V for Vendetta starts out showing us what the surroundings are like and what kind of monsters the villian has created.
3087;When we meet V, he's so much more intelligent than other heroes.
3088;he speaks with alliteration, and a genuine gentleman.
3089;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
3090;one I can watch over and over again and blu.
3091;ray makes it that much better.
3092;such a great film and great actors.
3093;Anybody who loves action movies and movies with twists that make you go wow!
3094;What a great great movie.
3095;This truly is an important movie.
3096;Upon rescuing a girl from the secret police, he also finds his best chance at having an ally.
3097;Hugo Weaving is V and he plays the part amazingly well.
3098;Weaving uses mannerisms and has such a great voice, that sometimes you forget that it's even a mask.
3099;Natalie Portman is wonderful as well as Evey.
3100;Both of them have such a great chemistry together and it's always great when they're on screen.
3101;The rest of the cast is wonderful as well (John Hurt is amazing as well even though he's not in it all that much).
3102;The story, characters and events are so good, that the few action moments in the film (which are spectacular by the way) are so good, you don't need action.
3103;It's such an interesting plot too, which I won't get into because you should see it yourself.
3104;The action scenes in this are great though, especially at the very end, I got goose bumps.
3105;The end sure goes out with a bang too, it's a great great ending to a great great movie.
3106;i seriously recommend this movie.
3107;It's a very smart movie that puts story over action and characters over flashiness.
3108;This truly is an important movie that makes you think, it wants you to think and it does so wonderfully.
3109;I recommend this movie completely.
3110;It's a great first movie by James McTeigue, it's controlled very well and is a tight movie.
3111;"There is an idea, Mr. Creedy, and ideas are bulletproof."""
3112;Natalie Portman did a great job.
3113;"He introduces himself as ""V,"" via pseudo."
3114;V For Vendetta is, of course, is a politically inciting film.
3115;It blurs the line between heroism and terrorism, raising some interesting questions that go beyond how we define our words.
3116;But overall, the message is compelling and its routes stem from how we define our lives, moreso than politics.
3117;The film's acting is remarkable for the most part, though Natalie Portman doesn't really impress.
3118;The action flows very well.
3119;all that aside, V. stands as one of the best sci.
3120;The character V is an achetypical charming aristocratic type, but the stereotype is evidently intended.
3121;In the end, it's the message that's most prevalent.
3122;So yeah, it was good, see it,.
3123;it's shocking how well someone who's face is never seen can act so well.
3124;Hugo Weaving did a brilliant job in this engrossing, fascinating look at facism.
3125;The movie was beautifully acted, quick paced and exciting, and one of the best comic films to date.
3126;The underlying messages in this movie are simply outstanding.
3127;You really have to watch it multiple times to understand its true beauty!
3128;satisfied) sigh, I did enjoy the Shakespeare quotes, the camera work, and the film itself.
3129;As is, I can't help but sympathize with V, though I can't condone his actions, either.
3130;This is one of my favorite all time movies.
3131;It was so appropriate for today's political views.
3132;The actors and actress were really good!
3133;A great view of the future to come.
3134;this is a very important film, it should rank with the best films of all time.
3135;It's an intelligent film that may go over many people's heads if they're just looking for an action flick.
3136;It rewards the thinking viewer.
3137;This is one of my favorite films of all time.
3138;Also introduce this film to every first year university student as part of the core curriculum.
3139;barring all that, it's just sanguine, brilliant, shocking fun.
3140;This movie is all about the character V and his willingness to go the distance to wake up the British people of the wrongs of their government.
3141;Slowly he wins over a girl, who endures torture and realizes the truth.
3142;Hugo Weaving is great with the alliterative lines.
3143;V the movie is far more interested in its 2.
3144;I give it a moderate three stars for a jolly good display of Euro acting 101.
3145;It is a complex yet enlightening action thriller that is definitely at least worth checking out.
3146;Christ but all in all very good movie!!!
3147;It's a movie to see
3148;Within days, she is given the chance to return the favor, and protects him.
3149;over the next year, they continue to save each other, in every way that a person can be saved.
3150;but it is also England and her people that need rescuing from a corrupt dictatorship, can two lone people possibly make a difference?Wonderful uses of color and lighting authentically nail the feel of each scene.
3151;But I must say, this movie is very relevant to what's going on in the world today, and what our future could be like if we don't do something about it!
3152;Good addition to the Library.
3153;The Wachowski brothers screen adaptation of the comic book cum graphic novel is masterful.
3154;accept it as riveting entertainment.
3155;I had been told about V for Vendetta by friends who had seen it and said that it was an absolutely amazing movie.
3156;"V has a personal grudge against the Norsefire regime and he is the only one brave enough to stand up to them
3157;Throughout the movie V and Evey are under investigation by the police, and it's a race against time for him to accomplish his goal of toppling the corrupt Norsefire regime.
3158;One of the chief reasons I appreciate this film is for its compassionately positive portrayal of its gay and lesbian characters"
3159;"This is an important movie that openly questions where Western culture is heading
3160;highly recommended if you like the comic book or just enjoy good action movies with a really good story.
3161;Entertain"
3162;All the right elements here .
3163;this should have been an excellent film.
3164;The acting was fine .
3165;it's very stylish and clearly a lot of money was spent.
3166;I missed this at the cinema, but it's a perfect night in.
3167;right wing government has come to power, V for Vendetta mixes a fantastic story with state.
3168;to trust this mysterious masked man, or the government that oppresses the country every day!
3169;and so you feel you are an integral part in the story, touching as it does on issues such as war, bigotry and racial hatred, as V appeals to the British public to consider their own actions.
3170;v for Vendetta is a rare movie .
3171;packed, but thoughtful film that makes you think about the state of the world today and the direction we're headed in.
3172;With brilliant performances from Portman, Hugo Weaving, and John Hurt, V for Vendetta not only makes for a perfect night in, it also makes you want to get out and start making a difference .
3173;this is a film that will get you thinking .
3174;I really dont see how that is.
3175;I appreciate the attempts of the filmmakers behind this project and everyone who understands what Im saying will have loved this movie.
3176;If you are a liberal who needs media to reafirm your belief that conservatives are bad people, this may be yet one more film from Hollywood which will do that for you.
3177;The Islamofacists must love this film for giving them positive public relations.
3178;This is one of the greatest films I've ever had the opportunity to watch.
3179;The movie had more than great acting, cinematography, and storyline but it also has (and will continue to have)great relevance.
3180;The parallels between the film and reality are truly freighting at times.
3181;the performances given by Weaving and Portman are tremendous.
3182;for a man whose true face is hidden beneath a mask you feel greater emotion coming from V than you would most unmasked men.
3183;the greatest success of the film is warning it sends to its viewers: unlike most thins in life if you ignore your freedom it will go away.
3184;"Hugo Weaving is great as ""V""."
3185;"A very ""Hollywood"" film, but entertaining none."
3186;All in all it is rather engaging and enjoyable to watch.
3187;He also meets a girl.
3188;For those out there who are unfamiliar with the said terminology, look it up, eh.
3189;all in all, this was certainly a movie worth seeing.
3190;In fact I am happy.
3191;As a stand alone film it si GREAT!
3192;Great movie and very entertaining and enlightening!
3193;Another graphic novel comes to life in captivating motion picture treatment.
3194;V for Vendetta is an exciting look at the post apocalyptic world created by Alan Moore and David Lloyd.
3195;there's suspense, intense drama, a great story.
3196;everything that you want from of good movie in the genre.
3197;v for Vendetta is chock full of good acting by good actors that is a jolt of fresh air from the stale performances that overrun Hollywood.
3198;natalie Portman is great, as are the main supporting cast.
3199;He will deal with the leaders of the fascist regime and with those that made him what he has become.
3200;The story of his endeavors is very well put together and fun to watch.
3201;highly recommended for adventurists that like their action with a cool, believable story.
3202;Very intriguing movie with outstanding acting.
3203;And unlike the vast majority of movies, this one has a message.
3204;This is a movie you will remember and a movie that you will find yourself thinking about.
3205;Is it the best acting, graphics, and cast ever?
3206;Serves as a good wake up call and inspirational film .
3207;This is what a movie is supposed to do: make the viewer want to do something, grasp an emotion, show an idea will never die with dedication.
3208;It took that concept and ran with it!
3209;"As is said in the movie, and comic, ""ideas are bulletproof."""
3210;An very engaging storyline, wonderful cinematography, great action, and a startling realism to real.
3211;It really has it all, and I'm sure whomever sees it will definitely be satisfied.
3212;This is a movie folks, and we all should be able to enjoy the wonders and fantasy of a great film.
3213;Everybody plays a wonderful part.
3214;A thoughtful movie at best.
3215;A good action film for those who like graphic cinema, but with a much needed message embedded finely within the fibers of its makeup.
3216;V is a modern day hero, one that we all need to become.
3217;Listen and apply it to what is happening right now, and you will walk out feeling empowered and enlightened.
3218;"V for Vendetta is a candidate for the overused imaginary award category of ""the greatest movie ever made"" simply because it is the greatest movie of its prescient time."
3219;The success of the Wachowski brothers gave them a freedom of expression that few others in the media had, a freedom protected by their uncanny ability to make scads of money when left to their own creative devices.
3220;"V builds on the concept created in ""The Matrix"", by far the greatest movie of the Matrix Trilogy: the notion of a totalitarian regime that exerts its control over the masses in part by carefully crafted and controlled reality creation, and then goes much further."
3221;"in to George Orwell's ""1984"", complete with numerous spot."
3222;"although one could surmise from the movie's title that the hero, ""V"", utilizes his more."
3223;V is the repository and transmitter of ideas, and it is ultimately those ideas which are the Hero of the movie, a very unusual cinematic proposition indeed.
3224;"And isn't that often a key component of great movies: unusual cinematic propositions?PS For more enlightenment as to how this whole scenario will play out, read the Pulitzer Prize Winning ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"", by William Shirer, from which a startling number of similarities to modern events can readily been seen, and watch the great movie ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" to see what generally lay in store for the surviving perpetrators."
3225;Anyone who believes this film to be a message to our government or having a hidden agenda is an idiot.
3226;The film is great, well directed, well acted, and has some small flaws in it, but nothing you keep your mind on throughout the film.
3227;The story keeps you engaged throughout the film and you are not just waiting for the next action scene.
3228;This movie is definitely recommended for anyone who likes an action film with a great story and doesn't succumb only to it's action.
3229;jerk reactionists whose blinding, arresting political allegiances prevented them from being able to actually focus on the merits of the film itself unwittingly supplied us with an entertaining, if troubling textbook example of the narrow.
3230;as for the film itself, it was, simply put, a work of sheer brilliance.
3231;If so, your mind is open.
3232;natalie Portman and ugo Weaving provide powerful performances in roles in which lesser actors would be inclined to overract.
3233;Subtlety in performance can go a long way toward allowing a film to get its message across and the aforementioned executed their roles flawlessly in this manner.
3234;"i won't provide spoilers, but there are (many) scenes worth noting in this film, including the ""V""."
3235;laden preamble given by V upon meeting Evey, the sequences involving the imprisoned Evey, the scenes which detailed the events at Lark Hill, including the origin of his name, and on and on and on.
3236;"This film was great on so many levels that its ""payoff"" exists throughout the film, and not just during its incredible climax."
3237;for those who were put off by some of the Matrix's (another fine film) relatively disjointed, often esoteric sequences, V for Vendetta may prove refreshing in the fact that it provides more explicit explanations of its underlying meanings and origins as it moves along through the story.
3238;in sum, this was a film with a message, indeed, and that message was expertly crafted by two of the most brilliant filmakers in the game today.
3239;This is a great movie.
3240;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
3241;This movie has superb acting, great action sequences, and an ending that will blow you away.
3242;Great performance by Hugo Weaving and Nataile Portman.
3243;I came to this film expecting great things of the directors after loving the matrix trilogy so much.
3244;Hugo Weaving does an admirable job portraying his characters sentiments whilst restricted by a mask throughout and Natalie Portman does a good job with a rather poor character that seems to change her temperament a touch too frequently to be believable.
3245;For fans of action movies and graphic novels this should keep you entertained, at least as you pick holes in it afterwards!!
3246;Worth a viewing, but don't expect too much and you should be fine.
3247;I am a huge fan of Alan Moore (and V for Vendetta is my favorite of his works.
3248;I read several reviews that leaned either towards a masterpiece or the other extreme.
3249;this made me really want to see the film.
3250;This is the first movie I have seen since Kill Bill Vol.
3251;I loved every performance in this movie, I loved seeing some of my favorite characters from the beginning of the post.
3252;modern movement brought to life so dramatically.
3253;evey wasn't a waifish, naive street walker but her transformation is all the more believable because she actually has some knowledge of the things the state has blacklisted and an appreciation for those things.
3254;I give this film my highest praise and do believe that if you are a fan of the comic or of extremes you will thoroughly enjoy it.
3255;Gives you a glimps of what life maybe like if trends in the US continue as they are.
3256;but the actual movie is great .
3257;"For example, Jesus said ""I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."""
3258;He blows up London's historical buildings and commits multiple assassinations that eventually tumble this government.
3259;Every once in a while a film comes along that provokes your way of thinking.
3260;V teaches Evy how to not live in fear of the government, and all the while his plan unfolds to bring a revolution and freedom to the country.
3261;There's not a bunch of violence, but when there is you are at full attention to the beautiful directing and cinematography.
3262;The man known as Agent Smith from The Matrix Trilogy and Elrond from LOTR, is at the top of his game.
3263;I love everything about this movie and I highly recommend it to everyone.
3264;V For Vendetta is a rare sort of film.
3265;It does qualify as an action movie, but at its core are some real.
3266;world issues that are sort of timeless.
3267;V is a lterate, mysterious anti.
3268;But like all terrorists he believes in his cause, and will risk anything to see it through.
3269;The events that follow are very dramatic, and as we learn the stories of V, Evey, and others, there seems to be a connection in how certain events changed their lives.
3270;directed by James McTeigue, his first effort as such, V is an impressive film.
3271;The pacing works well, buidling to an effective conclusion.
3272;but it's easily the best film I have seen this year.
3273;this is a drama with action, much more so than the matrix films, to which V has drawn many comparisons.
3274;If you are able, catch it in IMAX to punch up the action scenes(not that they need it!)
3275;vigilante killings, in some pure sense, are wrongful murders.
3276;Such persons can always arrange circumstances in which their killings.
3277;"The History Channel's priceless documentary, ""The Real Robin Hood"", should be on the viewing list for anyone chewing on vigilante justice."
3278;"Surprisingly, Crowe's touchstone of Robin Hood's taking rights and liberties from the rich and giving those to the poor so that justice can be done is ""spot on"", as the Brits say, for today's needs."
3279;winning Best Documentary of the Year, which covers the causes of the 2008 financial meltdown.)
3280;"The similarity of govts is what makes the movie, ""V For Vendetta"", an important topic of discussion and point of departure for ordinary Americans."
3281;"the movie is done in a ""filmatic graphic novel"" syle, according to the filmmakers themselves."
3282;It's writers, and certainly the adaptive filmmakers, want it to be seen as something more than comic book logic.
3283;Still, the story seems more engaging than something out of the straight, superhero, comic book genre.
3284;some of the film's core features are things that our today's revolutionaries need to digest.
3285;punctuated by a great sprong from the airborne Big Ben clock.
3286;Rule one is seeing democracy done.
3287;All the great democracy movements share this seeing.
3288;novel shows the needed seeing of democracy done.
3289;I so admire the strength of spirit and the fearlessness of the character in this story.
3290;It you want something to wake you up to world around us,you're in for an intellectial treat.
3291;"The best way to sum up this movie is to say it has elements of ""1984"", ""Zorro"", and ""Man in the iron mask""."
3292;it has a message for all free people about how easy freedom can be lost and the price to gain it back.
3293;politics aside, the plot is interesting and extremely thought.
3294;if you are not a fan of comics either and you are lucky enough to be reading this, please forget about the comic thingy and enjoy the movie for what it is.
3295;Loved this movie have Benn wanting to see it for years.
3296;While we may disagree with one another, we are still able to live a free life with our own beliefs and lifestyles.
3297;"The Wachowski Brothers, coming off the success of their ""Matrix"" films, have produced a rousing, exciting, and amazing story of one man who decided to fight against the system that left him scarred."
3298;The rest of the cast, including Stephen Rea and John Hurt, give wonderful supporting performances.
3299;the storytelling is fantastic, while the action sequences and visual effects are thrilling and visually.
3300;V for Vendetta is a thrilling film, full of exceptional storytelling, great performances, and thrilling action sequences.
3301;One of my favorite movies, I also like the digital version I can log into Amazon and watch it anywhere.
3302;In the latest film from the Wachowski brothers viewers are given a visually stunning look at an alternate future in which a naziesque British government becomes the target of one man's brutal vengeance campaign.
3303;the movie is filmed with earnestness and vision, blending flawless special effects with a thought.
3304;provoking story about freedom, vengeance, the role of government, the importance of individuality, and the quest for truth despite the consequences.
3305;It's mildly diverting but anyone looking for something really deep and meaningful will be wasting his or her time.
3306;This movie has it all: a complex message that reminds us that all governments are answerable to the people they serve.
3307;It's both a thinking man's script and an adrenaline junkie's fix.
3308;Watch it with your kids and you'll have some great discussion about the virtue of this film.
3309;Although the picture of the mask looks like you could wear it, that is not the case, but it is kinda like a cool trophy and I'm very pleased with the movie itself.
3310;V for Vendetta is about the idea that bravery will bring down a dictatorship.
3311;This plot succeeds because of V's bravery in the face of oppression, and is supported by society's refusal to take it anymore.
3312;This fantastical setup presents an extreme world that makes the rest of the movie's twists and turns hard to believe since the beginning setup two omniscient parties: the government and V. great idea, just didn't work for me.
3313;If you look around its scary how accurate the movie, with the world as it is today.
3314;definetly give this movie a watch!
3315;I really enjoyed the movie.
3316;Awesome fighting scenes and great store.
3317;Action and a good plot.
3318;Enjoyed this movie in the theater, after enjoying the film I knew I would want to own it one day!
3319;Nothing enjoyable about this movie whatsoever.
3320;I like Natalie since her first move Leon with Jean Reno, little bit disapoitment in Star wars,but this move is touching your heart.
3321;But not only Natalie ,the story of this move is revolutionary and it can open many eyes .
3322;Great dystopian thriller about V and Evey on a one.year revenge.
3323;V chilling and cool in his Guy Fawkes mask, his heavy throwing knives, his superhuman fighting ability, his ability to pit his enemies against each other, and his conniving to throw the whole rotten country into anarchy and revolution.
3324;What an appropriate message for the mass media!
3325;I have read the graphic novel, and now want to read it again.
3326;This is definately my favorite movie of all time.
3327;This is a very important movie, not just for the fact that it is very entertaining, but it sends an important message too, a message that people need to wake up!
3328;I found the movie really touched me, and made me think.
3329;There are not too many movies out there these days that have something this valuable to say, so I highly recommend this.
3330;He thinks it's the best film he has seen in a long time.
3331;I found this one a real mirror of what is to come .
3332;Ie the bankers and industrialists who are treating us as modern day slaves.
3333;with brilliant dialogue and amazing acting skills by Hugo Weaving (who can act 100 times better than 98% of those in the trade today, and you don't even get to see his face), the film moves along one thought provoking scene after another.
3334;The concepts of freedom and control and what society sacrifices to acheive each are beautifully woven into a visual and auditory orgy of intense stimulation.
3335;So much so that a viewer cannot help but be moved by the images, much less the thematic elements of the production.
3336;Combining some of the strongest themes of today, and possibly tomorrow, this movie strikes at the heart of what it means to be human and what it means to be free.
3337;truly an excellent but underrated movie and something that will surprise you.
3338;Great cast, everyone is good but Hugo is the STAR.
3339;can't even begin to explain how great Hugo is in this.
3340;v for Vendetta is visually impressive.
3341;Hugo Weaving conveys more emotion from behind a mask than most actors can manage with faces fully exposed.
3342;at the risk of giving too much away, the hero, V, is a modern.
3343;day Guy Fawkes, who is still remembered in England every year on November 5th.
3344;The bottom line for this film is going to be how you interpret it.
3345;Good performances are provided by all, the directing is solid, and the action scenes, few that they are, are quite effective.
3346;man that dude likes buffalo wings.
3347;This is an intelligent super hero film that is becoming all the more relevant with each passing day.
3348;"Look, this is a stylized version of ""1984,"" with teeth, blood and a few guts for good measure."
3349;Its a bit heavy at times but the message in it is the most powerful truth all teens and adults should consider.
3350;Hugo Weaving does a magnificent job in the title role.
3351;If you like Phantom of the Opera and Beauty and the Beast, you will love this movie.
3352;It has fast become one of my favorites.
3353;It is a very good message and also educational.
3354;Awesome movie, well acted, well produced and an awesome ending, you could most definitely watch it again, and it's very true to be honest.
3355;I am very happy and pleased with this product.
3356;Clear vision and very good image.
3357;It's a wonderful movie with interesting historical back ground.
3358;Keeps you on your toes.
3359;natalie Portman was outstanding and it was a great story with some unexpected twists.
3360;Her performance alone was worth the price of the disc.
3361;i'm generally not a big fan of action movies, but this was one of the rare action movies that makes you think.
3362;The action scenes were fun, the writing was exceptional and the acting was outstanding.
3363;I wanted to like it, I had high hopes, please Hollywood, i thought, give me some decent entertainment.
3364;Something with beautiful cinematography, great acting, clever dialog, and a powerful story.
3365;set in the near future of a world where Germany won ww2 a
3366;This movie was much better than I thought that it would be.
3367;This movie has both action and content.
3368;This is the perfect movie.
3369;There is a fire, and the resettlement camp burns to the ground.
3370;"One inmate survives, our hero V, who appears to have taken his name from his cell door, which bears the Roman numeral for five, which is ""V""."
3371;Guy Fawkes day, November 5th, is a theme throughout the movie.
3372;v meets our heroine, Evey when he saves her from an evil curfew enforcer.
3373;he hijacks a TV station, and gives one of the most moving speeches I've ever heard.
3374;But in the end, he has an impact on the whole country, as they finally stand up in mass against the government.
3375;it is an excellent and powerful movie that reminds us that we must fight to keep our freedoms because the government does not always have our best interest in mind, and what they tell us isn't always the truth.
3376;"One of my friends saw ""V"" while it was in theaters and suggested I go."
3377;It presents two extremes and provides the viewer with the difficult choice of laying out his own choices much as the characters in the movie must do.
3378;i highly recommend people see this movie, and possibly read the graphic novels that inspire it as well.
3379;If it were merely a precautionary tale about a society lulled into totalitarian rule, I could recommend this movie as a well made, fun bit of eye candy.
3380;There are certainly a lot of elements here to like.
3381;Specifically, the story telling is extremely effective, and the visual effects are stunning.
3382;In particular it is a soup.
3383;The 2002 movie adaptation is excellent and highly recommended.
3384;let me leave you with a question to ponder.
3385;I knew I would love this movie the moment we first see V and he begins spouting lines in alliteration.
3386;It has more in line with political thrillers than other action films.
3387;There are a couple central mysteries that the plot wraps itself around.
3388;Speaking of the cast, it is quite formidable.
3389;In a terrific and ironic twist, London's dictator is played by John Hurt who starred in 1984, a film V for Vendetta has a lot in common with.
3390;"And then is told that this ""uber."
3391;"protection"" he utilizes is for his citizens best."
3392;In other words, the freedom to act and live as they deserved.
3393;This is one if the best movies of all time with a great message to citizens of the world.
3394;Remember, people have the power
3395;This is a standout film about politics gone awry and the inevitable revolution that results.
3396;Also, I find the wailing and teeth gnashing in the 1 star section entertaining.
3397;A great mix of a love story and policial drama.
3398;this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat all though the film.
3399;It is a wonderful Friday night movie.
3400;provoking and daring were just some of the words from other viewers that lured me into seeing this self.
3401;Granted, the first twenty minutes I got kinda excited, hoping to see a clever script full of witty alliterations and matrix.
3402;full of Cliches and Loving It region.
3403;There's a violent murderer who really has a heart of gold and he wears a mask because he's scarred but holds beauty beyond the physical.
3404;He still enforces it in the same way they do .
3405;Its this character that the movie asks you to root for and beleive in.
3406;The city was appealingly clean and tidy yet chilling and lonely.
3407;The first blowing up of the building was unexpected eye.
3408;candy and Natalie's wardrobe stayed subtle, like her character.
3409;but rest assured,gollywood will revisit this franchise in the making.
3410;surfice it to type,i wont be going along for the ride.
3411;People will die because of this film.
3412;on the other hand, Hugo Weaving gives a wonderful performance and one imagines this will be popular at Liberal/Communist movie parties.
3413;this movie will instill ideas and questions in you about yourself and about your government.
3414;the ending is very good and i couldn't have asked for one better.
3415;its a very very good movie that poses plenty of questions for you to ponder.
3416;This movie brings to the forefront how a government can quickly go from the minimal required to ensure that free trustworthy citizens can go about their life, to an overprotective, lying, ends justifies the means tyrant system.
3417;That is my only critique, as the film does a great job at questioning what is worth losing freedom for.
3418;All in all, it is a great film.
3419;"As for newcomer James McTeigue, who served as an assistant director on the ""Matrix films"", provides a unique film that, while it drags slightly and takes time to make its point, is enthralling and entertaining nonetheless."
3420;With her curiosity, Evey is kidnapped by V and learns of his lifestyles that he carries on.
3421;"While based on Alan Moore's graphic novels, the film has a distinct similarity to George Orwell's""1984""."
3422;First time director James McTeigue, does a strong job, with flare for great visuals and artistry.
3423;With great mannerisms and a commanding voice, Weaving is immaculate as V. Natalie Portman provides a fine performance as Evey, even with a shaved head she is still beautiful.
3424;Stephen Rea and Stephen Fry are both great.
3425;First of the movie has many differences from the graphic novel.
3426;The use of tchoivsky's 1812 overture was brilliant and hugo weaving was incredible.
3427;"A very cerebral theme containing politics, religion, lemmings, and the supernatural
3428;One can see what this film aspires to be.
3429;THE MATRIX offers a simple story but an innovative, visually riveting form of storytelling.
3430;mentioned pieces that have inspired this film.
3431;It's intelligent, sophisticated, emotional, vivid, beautiful, well written, well acted, and well filmed.
3432;I saw it in the theater 5 times, I just kept feeling pulled back to it.
3433;If it were for the movie alone, I'd unquestionably rate it 5 stars.
3434;Two of his works in particular are legendry, Watchmen and V for Vendetta.
3435;The lead character V (played by Hugo Weaving of The Matrix trilogy) is a vigilante striking out against an oppressive Orwellian government in Britain's near future, with the help of a young television production assistant named Evey (played by Natalie Portman).
3436;hugo Weaving's portrayal of V captures your attention with a chilling verse reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe in his grand entrance, and doesn't let go until the final credits role.
3437;The conviction Weaving is able to convey through an inert mask is simply mesmerizing.
3438;the stunning futuristic world that rookie director James McTeigue has captured is almost a little too real in this riveting film.
3439;For myself, it evoked delight.
3440;My wife loved it though.
3441;Sutler orders Finch (Stephen Rea), the leader of the police force, to find the perpetrator.
3442;Let's put on a show followed by a huge, elaborate musical in their backyard, or the barn, with great musical numbers, full orchestras, but little rhyme or reason.
3443;v for VisualThe film creates an interesting visual universe blending elements of modern design, the Nazis, Big Brother, the 1940s, and """"Phantom of the Opera""""."""
3444;Visually, this works extremely well with the thematic elements, reinforcing the message for every two steps forwards, we take one step back.
3445;"Moving forward more than 400 years, ""Vendetta"" begins on November 4 and as soon as the clock strikes midnight, V blows up the Old Bailey."
3446;These are important things for us to know, to help make these characters believable and interesting.
3447;And the filmmakers realize this importance.
3448;"A considerable amount of screen time is spent portraying part of these histories
3449;As she becomes embroiled in Vs plot, she begins to gain strength, to become an ally to the masked man.
3450;It is an interesting performance.
3451;It is her resolve, her persona that must change.
3452;This verbal exposition provides a unique, fun and interesting dimension to his character.
3453;more importantly, Weaving manages to convey the various complexities of his character.
3454;Technically, he is an outlaw, but we see the world he lives in, through his eyes, and realize he is more of a hero.
3455;s for SupportThe supporting cast is universally good, providing an interesting level to the film.
3456;Stephen Rea is the standout as Finch, the leader of the traditional police.
3457;Throughout, we see the conflict on his face, testing him every minute, Stephen Fry is very good as a television personality hiding a secret from the world.
3458;John Hurt is suitably ominous as Chancellor Sutler, always appearing on large video screens.
3459;smith is very good as the head of the Fingermen, the government's version of the Gestapo.
3460;c for Conclusion""""V for Vendetta"""" is a very well."""
3461;made film with a lot of ideas and messages.
3462;Look, Bush won the election.
3463;He got the electoral vote, he got the popular vote.
3464;wingers beat you to it.)
3465;In my opinion a truly great movie, if you are familiar with 1984 and like this genre !
3466;V for Vendetta lives the modern Distopia and adds a lot of style.
3467;V for Vendetta was a truly fantastic film, see this as soon as you can.
3468;It is very interesting as it is told from the point of view of a terroist.
3469;There is a lot more plot that I don't want to give away, all I can say is that this film was amazing and you should see it imediatly.
3470;The graphic Novel was excellent, but apart from that, the blue.
3471;ray disc is about as good as you can get outside of seeing this film on IMAX.
3472;disk came in good condition, didnt pay much at all for it, and so, got exactly what i was looking for.
3473;Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter.
3474;The mask is very small, but still captures the essence of the film .
3475;V for Vendetta was a great movie to watch in theaters.
3476;But the crystal clarity brought forth by Blu.
3477;ray, and this is a great place to start.
3478;The behind the scenes feature and movie itself are both on disc 1.
3479;"It's the Count of Monte Cristo meets 1984
3480;Don't watch it for any social commentary though, it's a good flick.
3481;Such a great movie I wish more people would watch it.
3482;This is a wonderful story in the simplest form of good versus evil.
3483;It is well acted and the special effects are perfect in the context of the storyline.
3484;and the set is really cool.
3485;One of my all time favs, and the book is pretty damn good as well.
3486;Highly recommended to anyone who liked the concept of 1984 by George Orwell
3487;I liked the performance of the masked man.
3488;Not the best movie I've ever seen"
3489;I love it because it reminds me that i should not just let things happen and not to be one of the sheep.
3490;It really gets you to think and i love those kind of movies.
3491;If you like a story that makes you think and draws parallels to the way things are in this day and age, this is a movie you will love.
3492;this movie is an instant classic.
3493;Excellent performance by Natalie, who is one of my very favorite actors.
3494;Storyline kept me hooked throughout.
3495;this is a GREAT movie.
3496;Think The Phantom of the Opera with a Zorro complex!
3497;4.5V for Vendetta strikes me as a well.
3498;scripted Chex Mix that serves as a superhero, revolutionary, and revenge movie all at once.
3499;"But what makes the gunpowder treason and plot so interesting is the character of V himself and the circumstances in which his ""quest"" ultimately reveals a number of poignant observations."
3500;This is best portrayed through the character of Evey who, along with everyone else, had conformed and obeyed to the whims of a harsh and suffocating dictatorship for so long.
3501;But in the end, I really enjoyed this movie for its extremely good choice in having cast Hugo Weaving as V and Natalie Portman as Evey.
3502;Colors are vivid, but not as in depth as I've seen in older, albeit newly.
3503;encoded and looks great with the higher bitrates).
3504;LFEs were pretty good on a couple of scenes, though, such as the first fight where V introduces himself and that very cool montage with the dominoes.
3505;3.5I enjoyed the extras, which consist mostly of behind.
3506;4.0I really enjoyed this film for its unique twist on the superhero genre .
3507;Much like its script (which is supremely enunciated by Hugo Weaving), the cast is excellent with a special commendation to John Hurt who basically just talks on a giant TV for most of the film.
3508;will, the power of symbolism, and its ability to withstand the test of time, be it through censorship, controlled viewing, etc.
3509;I highly recommend this for the great story.
3510;encoding, we fans of V may have to wait for an eventual double dip, along with some of their other catalog titles.
3511;"Adapted from the excellent graphic novel of the early '80s, this film comes from the many members of the ""The Matrix"" team."
3512;The parallels to what is going on in this country right now are eerily foreshadowing.
3513;The characters were amazing, the visual effects were stunning.
3514;one of my moat favorite movies.
3515;I love the story line and if you never watched it your missing an amazing movie.
3516;This movie is richly satisfying and very entertaining.
3517;When movies are at their best.
3518;Fans of the graphic novel complained that it took liberties with the story.
3519;And it's because of that, an engaging and suspenseful story, and stellar performances from the main and supporting cast that I count V for Vendetta among my favorite movies.
3520;If what I've written intrigues you at all and you haven't seen this film yet, you absolutely should.
3521;This is a revolutionary video.
3522;This is by far my all time favorite movie.
3523;"It is what most call an ""idealistic"" film that centers around a futuristic England where all chaos has been forcefully put to an end."
3524;"In a world where disease, crime, and hatred became so rampant in America, a man by the name of Adam Sutler invented the role of high chancellor, and performed ""cleansing"" in England by initiating strict rules to create a seemingly perfect, ""Godly"", nation."
3525;She is confronted by a group of fingermen, who are the police of the nation, and they surround her.
3526;This movie was amazingly well written and directed.
3527;The characters and lines were powerful and moving.
3528;This is a movie that makes you want to change the world.
3529;V for Vendetta, based on the graphic novels by British writer Alan Moore, is the first new film by the Wachowski Brothers since the final Matrix film.
3530;The public broadcaster is essentially the Ministry of Propaganda, and they put the government's spin on events to constantly cover up the truth about crimes of dissention.
3531;by coincidence, they ran into each other again at the public broadcaster's office, where he managed to air a pre.
3532;Stephen Rea as detective Finch does the best with his lines.
3533;this is one you've got to see a couple of times to really get all the twists.
3534;but there is so much more to love than to lament!
3535;Both entertain, provoke, and haunt you with home truths, both move to laughter and to tears, and leave scenes replaying in your imagination.
3536;the movie was wonderfully faithful to the book, not in every detail, but more than faithful in spirit.
3537;what remains is a haunting melody about the human spirit: we do mess things up badly, but even greater is our propensity to overcome and be transformed.
3538;to survive, surmount, and transcend, becoming more than we were before.
3539;V rescued and preserved the best of the human spirit .
3540;for humanity, for beauty, for humor, for integrity.
3541;* The movie also emphasized that ideas are powerful instruments of change, and ideas can't be killed.
3542;i hope that's true because, as the creator who wrote the above points across so many minds and hearts, he should be thrilled and proud.
3543;my deep gratitude to both Moore and the briliant creators of this film.
3544;I love this movie for its modern Orwellian tale and wonderful performances.
3545;"ray format, the studios really need to make sure they are providing the best product
3546;Very telling movie as to what may happen in the very near future if and when the government takes over.
3547;Whether you may like him or not, `V for Vendetta' is produced by Joel Silver, one of the strongest players in Hollywood, the one behind the successful `Matrix' trilogy, and the script of `V' is written by none other than Wachowski Brothers.
3548;To do so, `V' employs a Guy Fawkes method .
3549;well, blow up the Old Bailey, you know .
3550;fetched story contains as many elements as possible .
3551;The film certainly has several good action sequences, but what is fascinating may be the character of `V' himself, and the far.
3552;And as to the film's explanation about the emergence of UK's dark totalitarian society, it is as credible as the big secret of the `Matrix.'
3553;`V for Vendetta' is absolutely a `love.
3554;Still the film's stylish actions and images with unexpected humor are undeniable.
3555;V for Vendetta was by far one of the most powerful movies of 2006 (and up there with the most powerful movies ever for that matter)!
3556;i mean politics until our world is a spitting image of what it is depicted as in the year 2020 in VfV.
3557;Look at all of the changes in our society in the last 15 years, and with the world changing faster and faster every year that passes.
3558;He kept saying """"Face Off"""" to make sure you got it."""
3559;The world is a complex hybrid of George Orwell's 1984 and Aldous Huxley's A BRAVE NEW WORLD.
3560;Sutler rules the country with an iron hand and makes his ways known to the public through a variety of messages that he broadcasts via huge video screens and across the nation's television network.
3561;They know that most of the news they hear is actually made up, but they still watch and listen.
3562;The film is full of serious dialogue, witty diatribes, and monologues full of alliteration.
3563;"This wonderful wordplay just isn't amusing
3564;Words are meaningful and have power and V FOR VENDETTA does an excellent job of illustrating this.
3565;overall, V FOR VENDETTA is a very entertaining and thought.
3566;The film doesn't rely upon action to move the story along, is full of character development, and contains some extraordinary witty wordplay.
3567;I enjoyed the movie and anyone who enjoys an action movie that requires thinking will, too.
3568;Fits well in a collection along side the Matrix Trilogy, plus the best of the comic book .
3569;an extrodonary action packed thrill ride, a triumph, powerful and spectacular.
3570;The creators of this film took intelligence and delicacy into making a nearly flawless adaptation.
3571;They snipped and cut what they needed to and added fresh material to give the film more substance.
3572;More than half of the films dialogue comes straight from the graphic novel, and it's really inspiring to see a hollywood movie do justice like that.
3573;This duo turned out to be the best idea the film had.
3574;I'm not familiar with the other actors but they certainly deserve more and more screen time in their future.
3575;provoking Evey in the film is way more interesting and inspiring than the girl in the book.
3576;Giving her a smarter role really gave the audience something more interesting.
3577;He was spot on with V. v for Vendetta is one of the benchmark comic book movies that really got it right.
3578;We really take for granted how much these people work to make a film an artwork, when one can simply just sell it with action, effects, and sexuality.
3579;It came before expected, as always with Amazon, the person who received it was very happy with it.
3580;this is one of the best movies of the year.
3581;It is more serious and important than any other's that I've seen.
3582;It deals with real issues, sensitive issues.
3583;It really makes you think.
3584;V is a great character.
3585;Beneath his mask, you can tell that he is in pain, physically and mentally.
3586;it has action, romance, humor witch was actually suprising.
3587;and just a great story line.
3588;this is a MUST see movie!
3589;First of all, almost everyone who has written a review on this movie has taken a very one sided approach to it.
3590;Understand that this story is powerful.
3591;Hugo Weaving gives an excellent performance.
3592;The entire cast is wonderful.
3593;This is a film I like to enjoy repeatedly.
3594;This is a well made movie.
3595;Complicated themes, no matter where you stand.
3596;This movie presents fine acting, cinematography, and a good adaptation of the graphic novel.
3597;Good action and good dialogue keeps the viewer engaged.
3598;V for Vendetta was very good portraying the government as so corrupt and immoral, the characters were amazing.
3599;This film is highly recommended.
3600;It is an allegory of our times and our potentially dangerous future.
3601;It has to be difficult to use purely gesture and voice inflection to play a part, and he was excellent!
3602;It can evoke strong emotion.
3603;To me those are things that can make a movie great.
3604;The movie was make years ago but is relevant today.
3605;Natalie Portman is again outstanding.
3606;I really enjoyed this film.
3607;I thought it was well directed, well acted, and well written.
3608;I thought it had a really interesting story and great action scenes.
3609;So far this is one of the year's best movies.
3610;I have always been a fan this type.
3611;If you enjoy this you will enjoy both versions of Red Dawn.
3612;This is a pretty exciting story and a pretty will made movie.
3613;one of the themes of this movie is that lies are told to reveal the truth.
3614;And so it is with this movie although the revealed truths are not those """"truths"""" that the movie makers intended."""
3615;the nutjob left loves this movie.
3616;The reason this movie has struck such a chord is frightening.
3617;Just kill and destroy and you will feel better.
3618;Just keep your eyes open about what this movie is preaching.
3619;one final irony is that this is a pretty good, exciting action picture.
3620;If it just didn't try so hard to convince you that this is contemporary or near future America, this would be a fun movie to watch.
3621;* One of the ironies of this deeply anti.
3622;Guy Fawkes is the inspiring secular saint because he wanted to kill and to destroy and that it what is important, to kill and to destroy.
3623;Ah yes, V for Vendetta.
3624;For those who value a movie with a message, this is perfect.
3625;For those who value free speech, freedom, and independance, this movie is for you.
3626;v for Vendetta is a clear message.
3627;A message and a glimpse.
3628;Those who believe this is not how it should be mysteriously vanish along with their families.
3629;Corruption will eventually eat away every government on this Earth.
3630;All you can do is stand up for what you believe in.
3631;"And V for Vendetta is a clear message to the people saying ""Don't let your fear of ""outside threats"" let your government take your freedom away."
3632;Because when you are afraid, you can be controlled.
3633;So please, watch this movie.
3634;"imagine ""Batman Begins"" with the Liam Neeson character as the hero crossed with ""The Phantom of the Opera"" with a twist of 1984 thrown in for good measure and you've got an idea of the film ""V for Vendetta""."
3635;She represents us as she observes V and slowly comes to understand his madness.
3636;No matter the film manages to tell a gripping story for a mainstream Hollywood release.
3637;It's still an entertaining film.
3638;"Stylishly directed by James McTeigue (assistant director of ""The Matrix"" here helming his first film)with beautiful cinematography by the late Adrian Bittle (""The World is Not Enough"", ""Aliens"" and ""Thelma and Louise"")""V for Vendetta"" may not perfectly capture Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel but it certainly captures the spirit of it."
3639;Featuring stunning performances and great support work particularly by Hugo Weaving, Natalie Portman, Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Tim Pigoett.
3640;"smith and Rupert Graves ""V for Vendetta"" takes a lot of risks for a mainstream Hollywood movie in the post 9/11 world we live in but it's points are intelligent and well worth noting."
3641;this is a must see .
3642;The movie is a flawless transfer, with special effects that will stand the test of time.
3643;Moore's comments on the film are justified.
3644;I wanted to see an adaptation of one of Moore's master.
3645;works, not someone elses take on the subject and characters, twisting a classic of the genre into thier own creation.
3646;V for Vendetta is a great movie and the approach to the subject is wonderful!
3647;The Wachowski brothers did a fantastic job on this one and to experience the acting talents of Hugo Weaving (Mr. Smith .
3648;After doing The Matrix Triology this was the perfect project for the brothers and for Weaving!V for Vendetta (Two.
3649;he was most likely inspired by the book as the title's date approached and Moore observed Thatcher's England and Reagan's America unfold.
3650;"What an amazing story ""V for Vendetta"" told."
3651;Alan Moore saw that Fascism was still alive and well in the world of 1984 as it was in Orwell's Post WWII 1940s.
3652;jump forward 20 years, and we have a retelling of this amazing story, but this time on film instead of the comic panel.
3653;In this day and age of Terrorism, the fear of Terrorism, and the Fascist use of that fear, the story is more important than ever in Bush's America/World.
3654;Fear is the most powerful tool of the fascist as has been demonstrated in both the real world .
3655;"Yes, this film portrays a terrorist as the ""good guy"", but it actually delves deeper into the heart of all of us
3656;This movie will inspire you to do so, and show you that people should not be afraid of their government"
3657;This movie has a superhero vibe about it, but the message of human dignity and the triumph of human spirit in the face of heinous authoritarianism is wonderful, honest, and an important message.
3658;The Obama vision of healthcare is well expressed publicly in Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel's graph of an individual's worth to society and corresponding worth for medical services.
3659;Both babies and the elderly in Obama's vision will receive the least amount of healthcare due to their least value status to society.
3660;the movie V for Vendetta is an amazing replication of the Obama, Pelosi and Reid vision for America.
3661;This is a great movie because it goes to the deeper issues of totalitarianism.
3662;The more I thought about the film though, the more I wanted to see it again.
3663;I saw it again tonight, and liked it better than the first two times, and have derived more and more from the story with each viewing.
3664;It will likely become a cult classic.
3665;I suspect teens might enjoy it the most.
3666;Putting aside the political slant on this movie, and the whole Beauty and the Beast aspect, I'd like to just describe the entertainment value I got from it.
3667;"Many scenes were engrossing in a video game / graphic novel kind of way, especially the whole back story on how the ""V"" avenger character came to be."
3668;The acting by Hugo Weaving as V was brilliant, especially considering it was all done behind a mask.
3669;A few minor parts of the plot were unconvincing, but overall I recommend it.
3670;"I saw ""V"" for the Matrix creative team connections, and mostly found it a worthwhile experience."
3671;This movie really shocked me, I think I was expecting a straight up action flick and instead got a very well done and acted modern day 1984 except with a littl emore action and more a optimistic ending.
3672;the actors were great story impecable and was just a very very good movie.
3673;these defiantly a movie worth watching.
3674;I love this movie, and so do my kids!
3675;In this movie this is true.
3676;"Shakespeare is well quoted but my quote for this movie is also from Shakespeare ""Much Ado About Nothing""Natalie Portman proves herself a capable actress."
3677;She has shed the stigma of child star with mature performances like in this movie or in Closer but she couldn't save this movie.
3678;even though the script is very well written, the acting is good, and the story moves along well the whole thing is just lacklustre.
3679;fortunately, the creators know how to make an entertaining movie while staying true to the spirit of the comic.
3680;Delia's atrocities are reproduced to a starkly realistic effect, and are alone worth the price of admission.
3681;the tale behind the regime's rise to power (not detailed in the comics) is given the royal treatment, providing further enjoyment and deeper enjoyment for fans of the comic.
3682;The film's strongest point lies in Evey's incarceration, and although the ending doesn't quite follow the books, it is still powerful and inspiring.
3683;It's a great adaptation of a comic, and an adaptation of a great comic.
3684;"The two factors combine to create a movie with a much more ""mainstream"" look than any other comic adaptation I've seen and a much better dramatic flow."
3685;Our hero, V, began his the story as a human test animal in some inhuman medical experiment, but came out of it alive .
3686;There are plenty of surreal elements, though.
3687;maybe the real surprise, if you don't usually read comics, is that V comes from DC, the publisher that created Batman, Superman, and their immediate kin.
3688;I've enjoyed the Vertigo line, but I admit I haven't read V yet.
3689;I just saw the movie and will watch it many more times, to be sure.
3690;There is so much powerful and eloquent symbiology in this movie that I'm sure I could watch it twenty more times and still not catch it all.
3691;That's especially true, I think, when it comes to V's character .
3692;whether the filmmakers are eliciting Batman or the Phantom, Voltaire or Timothy McVeigh, it's all done with remarkable skill, and creates a complex and rich picture.
3693;"I find it especially compelling that the development of V and his ideas is done primarily through frames/symbols, while other characters are more linear
3694;i went in expecting a superhero movie guilty pleasure, and left realizing that I had actually watched something a lot closer in depth and tenor to some of the indie flicks I also enjoy .
3695;provoking, entertaining, and worth seeing.
3696;This is my favorite movie of all time.
3697;I would recommend it to any person who loves a good action/drama movie
3698;This one like every other movie, stands on its own.
3699;Take me away from the worries of modern life and show me something else, escapist entertainment.
3700;I want fantastic heroes that can do things that I can never hope to do.
3701;The strong men or women that can ride to the rescue and right the wrongs of modern day life, from the bullies on the playground to the corrupt politicians.
3702;I want to see people who fly, and fight, and great car chases, wonderful illogical romances, magic and ESP.
3703;The interpretation of that idea is what we see as a final product.
3704;Good acting is a must.
3705;A good script and good direction are also a requirements.
3706;this movie succeeds briliantly in that aim.
3707;I was drawn into the story , it took my breath, and my attention until the end credits rolled.
3708;V is the mysterious vengeful antihero.
3709;I thought the girl's name Eve, to be telling.
3710;The acting was good without being over dramatic.
3711;The people that played the roles seemed to fit the roles well.
3712;I believe it's important to view a movie without any prior seeds planted by someone else who liked it or disliked it.
3713;if entertainment is your aim then this is a great film.
3714;There is plenty of action for the action buffs.
3715;There is a moral message for the conscientous.
3716;There are however a lot of emotions.
3717;I want to see it for myself.
3718;That is always my advice.
3719;I have loved movies that others wouldn't give one star.
3720;I really enjoyed the movie.
3721;Having been a fan of the graphic novel for many years I was interested to see how exactly the Wachowski's intended to translate Moore's early 90's view of the future into a believable concept for the twentieth century.
3722;What we have here the is an adaptation of the original concept of the novel, with some of the plot points rearranged and characters redrawn, in order to fit a movie format, and to better explore the intricacies of this fascist police state.
3723;Whereas moore portrayed a world where the government is in complete control, both of the nation and the hearts and minds of the citizenry, the Wachowski's have altered this somewhat.
3724;and found this among our choices.
3725;V For Vendetta is one of the best movies of our time.
3726;The idea of a totalitarian government controlling every aspect of people's lives really makes one think of what it really means to be free.
3727;The acting is wonderful, with Hugo Weaving perfectly portraying the suave yet menacing character of V. His silky voice and charismatic words make one forget that he is, in fact, a terrorist with the intention of carrying out Guy Fawkes' failed attempt to destroy Parliament in the 1600's.
3728;Natalie Portman is great in her role of Evey Hammond, evolving from a cautious everyday woman trying to live her life in peace to a strong.
3729;The side stories are very interesting and piece the whole plot together in a web of illusioned coincidence.
3730;Overall, it's perfect for those with an open mind who are looking for something very deep, thought.
3731;a futuristic look at an old story.
3732;highly recommend this to anyonewho wants to see where America could be going.
3733;Amazing movie, cast, dialogs and so much more!
3734;An amazingly told story and oneof my favorites of all time, the story is amazingly told, the pacing a bit muddled sometimes but it doesn't take away from what is otherwise an amazing performance by Natalie Portman
3735;V for Vendetta from comic to movie.
3736;when you see the movie don't think it's power hero like super.
3737;This another hero with a sytle .
3738;Full of funny scenes and its just overwhelmingly good.
3739;I could watch this over and over and over and still love it
3740;This was, by far, my favourite movie of 2006.
3741;When I saw the trailers for this movie, I thought it would be a thought provoking film, artsy, and action.
3742;My boyfriend put it perfectly as """"excrutiatingly painful""""."""
3743;This is an excellent movie, arguably one of the best movies ever.
3744;V is a intriguing, influential mastermind.
3745;I recommend it to anyone.
3746;There's moments of comedy, romance and action, as well as excellent twists and turns in the plot.
3747;McTeigue certainly knows his craft and manages to use the camera in a manner that is perfectly befitting the content.
3748;The production design is idiosyncratic but also accessible and believable, which further mesmerizes and intrigues.
3749;The issues are contemporary and touchy, but the movie offers enough ambiguity to permit the viewer his own interpretation.
3750;Patience and contemplation are required here, and I fear that in the wrong hands, this form of content could be inflammatory.
3751;But then all good art is.
3752;there's nothing to complain about with Natalie Portman, but it's a sheer miracle that Hugo Weaving can continuously steel the show from behind a mask.
3753;Dario Marianelli's score is superb, and listen to the way he subtly incorporates Tchaikovsky into the quieter moments!
3754;Scattered throughout the film are several intriguing and wonderful montage sequences that create a marvelous flow to the narrative and are wonderfully accented by the pulse of Marianelli's music.
3755;acted, over dramatized and under written.
3756;this film also perpetuates the growing anti.
3757;ray is great, with phenomenal looking scenes and color.
3758;The special features and well drawn out, and any fan of the movie should be more than satisfied with what the Blu.
3759;At first viewing, I felt that this film is quite remarkable.
3760;"This remarkable film was created by Wachowski brothers, whom also created the ""Matrix"" trilogy, which is one of my treasures."
3761;These films are gifts to humanity for they provided wonderful yet strong analogy of our reality.
3762;"While both ""Matrix"" and ""V for Vendetta"" presented the theme of control, ""V for Vendetta"" is the best presented as a government's control of the people."
3763;"lifting appearance of a character named ""V.""In my humble opinion, I highly recommended this movie."
3764;This is a great movie on revolution.
3765;I have watched this movie around 15 times in a year and still love it.
3766;if this review helped you please give it a thumbs up.
3767;V for Vendetta is a futuristic tale that unveils the social rot beneath the increasing concentration of wealth and power of that society.
3768;It is a thinly veiled critique of our present society, and it largely pulls off the feat, thanks to a good story and a a kind of hero.
3769;movie adaptation to be perfect.
3770;A great frightening, satirical, political, and also fun and emotional adventure story has been completely ruined.
3771;Very inspiring and worth your time to watch!
3772;All the theatrics, the masks, oy vey!
