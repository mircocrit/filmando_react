id;spiegazione
1;Vanilla Sky is one of those movies you see for the first time and you are like What the (fill in the blank) .
2;But once you piece everything together it starts to make sense.
3;After watching this movie a second time I realized it is a great movie and I think it will gain greater cult status in the future.
4;tom Cruise is perfect in this movie.
5;He is a cocky, rich, inheritant with the world seemingly at his hands.
6;In one hand he is the editor of a popular pop culture magazine with a chic apartment and a slick Ferrari.
7;In the other hand he has the pretty but insecure Cameron Diaz as his girlfriend along with his best friend played by Jason Lee.
8;Therefore she turns from the nice and likable character we've seen in Something About Mary and transforms into Mommie Dearest.
9;I'm not going to summarize the rest of this movie but from there it is a great movie that travels into science fiction and questions reality.
10;I think they all play their role very well in this movie.
11;As I said earlier Tom Cruise fits in this movie perfectly as he did in Jerry Maguire, Top Gun and Risky Business.
12;Cameron Diaz is perfect for being a psycho lover and I found it odd that Jason Lee was in this movie.
13;I picture him as the dude from Mallrats, which is the funniest comedy of all time.
14;in short, this is a great movie that will make you question life and is also a cool science fiction movie.
15;Give Vanilla Sky more than one viewing and you will see what I mean and alot more.
16;by the way the soundtrack to the movie is outstanding.
17;It is such an odd song for this movie but it sounds perfect in a movie like this.
18;This is a fine story and a fine movie, and I recommend it to anyone who can concentrate on details and who can appreciate the difference between a dream and reality .
19;and the possibility that in the future we may be able to link the two.
20;Forgot the whole twist toward the end.
21;While Vanilla Sky does not compare in any way with it's far superior predecessorAbre los Ojos, Vanilla Sky succeeds in two ways:.
22;Style: The film is undeniably pretty and cast with three leading characters who are, by most standards, quite elegant themselves.
23;The movie seems to be predominately made specifically as eye candy, and is thoroughly pleasing in that aspect.
24;Suspension of Disbelief: the film, like it's predecessor, is surreal and challenges you to decipher what is real and what is not.
25;in the end, it is a pretty movie with a pretty cast and one of the best soundtracks you'll ever hear (although to get the full soundtrack you may have to do a little hunting of your own, since the official soundtrack is sadly lacking many of the great tunes from the classic scenes in this movie) Overall, it is NOT completely horrible/unwatchable, despite what some may say, and yet, it is not perfect.
26;If you enjoy surrealistic psycho.
27;candy, you'll probably enjoy this movie.
28;If you enjoy watching Tom Cruise in anything besides Top Gun, Rain Man, or Days of Thunder, this, and Minority Report, are definitely worth a watch.
29;Tom Cruise is at its best.
30;A very challenging role for most, but he just did it so naturally.
31;the movie is very touching, and takes you on the emotional rollercoaster ride throughout the movie.
32;If you are a kind of mature viewer, you will understand this movie and love it too.
33;This movie is the archetype of what a true good movie should be like.
34;This movie truly is amazing.
35;Marcus Aerilius once said, Give The People What They Want.
36;When people want true love and romance to be eternal, give it to them, and this is exactly what Vanilla Sky gives you.
37;I loved Jerry Maguire and when I heard the director and star were making another movie, I was first in line.
38;That's the beauty of this movie.
39;This is easily top five as far as my emotional favorite.
40;a good Americanized version of Abre Los Ojos.
41;Penelope Cruz provides a good link to the spirit of the original but I would recommend seeing both.
42;This is one of those movies that leaves you wanting more.
43;It takes you on this fantastic ride through the depths of the soul, but in the end you're still wondering what the truth is.
44;If you're one for philosophical and intelligent movies, this is definately one for you.
45;First let me say, I think Tom Cruise is a wonderful actor and usually I truly enjoy all of his movies.
46;Then, as time went by, I found it coming back to me in a song, in an image, in something I overheard.
47;What I found upon my second viewing was fascinating.
48;the exploration of human obsession with superficial beauty and instant gratification was phenomenal.
49;David Aames lives for the moment
50;looking man who sleeps with gorgeous women, drives fancy cars, wears nice clothes and, best of all, doesn't really have to work!
51;The journey that his character takes is at once painful, uplifting, and one of the greatest achievements of subtle introspection delivered through the medium of film that I've witnessed in a long time.
52;the commentary with Cameron Crowe and his wife, complete with a little cameo by Cruise, is very insightful.
53;The other extras are fun to watch if you like the movie.
54;this is filmmaking at its best.
55;Sometimes Vanilla Sky resembles more a music video than a movie, but at least the music is fine.
56;the movie has an interesting cast, because there are a lot of familiar faces in Vanilla Sky, like Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Jason Lee, Kurt Russell and Jason Lee.
57;But even though it's a flashy cast, the movie rarely offers highlights with the performances.
58;tom Cruise gives a lackluster performance, Kurt Russell makes a good job, Jason Lee is adequate, and Penelope Cruz reprises exactly the same character that she played in Open Your Eyes, as a matter of fact she didn't expanded her role, since she does the same things that she did before.
59;I got this movie and.
60;Tom Cruise proving again what an actor he is and what he can achieve as one.
61;Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz are great in it.
62;this is one of my favorite movies!
63;Tommy nails it and Cameron Diaz does an incredible job as well .
64;He is a very good actor and I'll always love his performance in Born On the Fourth of July.
65;Vanilla Sky is a trip deep inside the mind of a suave, narcissistic, extremely rich and extremely handsome guy fantasizing about the perfect love that could have been.
66;wrenching in this movie: he is very raw and very exposed.
67;I think this film improves upon more than one viewing because it is so complex of a plot which delves deep into the subconscious mind of the protagonist.
68;I liked it a lot on the third view and my hat's off to Crowe and to Cruise the actor.
69;This is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time.
70;Another reason this is one of my favorite films is because of the incredibly unpredictable ending.
71;I highly reccomend this movie to all my friends.
72;Not one of Tom's best or even a good movie.
73;Vanilla Sky is a quirky sci.
74;girlfriend (Cameron Diaz) and the beautiful Sofia (Cruise's then.
75;In the meantime,he finds out about cryonics from the icily beautiful Tilda Swinton (now the White Witch in the Disney Narnia movies)Vanilla Sky brings up interesting issues of reality, fantasy, whether it was all a dream.
76;Russell is convincing as a therapist,being quite paternal with his nerd glasses (this same Russell was the Marine in Stargate) Vanilla Sky will open your eyes!
77;Penelope and Cameron are cute.
78;But, despite Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz being main characters, it has become one of my favorite films.
79;it is a movie that makes you think, and has a kick .
80;Penelope Cruz does a wonderful job as the focus of Cruise's affection in this film, and there are some truly heart touching scenes.
81;Definitely worth watching at least once!Myself, I need my own copy.
82;Cameron Diaz also gives a unique stance as a crazy stalker.
83;Definitely could watch this more than once.
84;An original script with a story that seems to take shape before your eyes, this is a masterpiece of cinematography.
85;every aspect of this film weaves together to tell a story that is both profound and poignant.
86;tom Cruz leads a perfect cast in this well written, directed and performed scifi, thriller, love story, action movie with several deep examinations of the human experience.
87;I gave this movie 2 stars (rather than none) simply because its one of those movies that many people will tell you was brilliant .
88;you therefore have to see it yourself and make your own mind up.
89;This movie will make you have to think.
90;now, I'm not going to say that Vanilla Sky is the greatest movie of all time but it was the best movie you never saw last year.
91;I'm also not going to ruin this movie by telling you the story line or how beautiful the scenes as well as the actors look.
92;Vanilla Sky has it all interesting story, great soundtrack, and good performances from all.
93;vanilla Sky, Wonder Boys, and High Fidelity.
94;Thanks to the efforts of his dead father he knows all the right people and owns his own corporation answerable to no one but a board of directors.
95;Women fall at his feet and his best friend is on the Aames payroll while writing the great American novel.
96;He struggles to maintain control of company and to regain control of his life all while capturing the heart of his one true love.
97;It is one that stretches the imagination and disbelief of the viewer.
98;I don't watch films for statements, I want to be entertained.
99;i did enjoy watching Cruz, she has a powerful on screen presence, and although I like Diaz a lot too, this wasn't the best role for her in my opinion.
100;Cruise has the ability to make really great films but this one isn't one of them.
101;Open Your Eyes takes a little longer to draw you in, but once it has you there it takes you far beyond where Vanilla Sky does.
102;It's in my top 5 favorite movies of all time.
103;it is just formatted to fit my television screen.
104;If you liked The Game with Michael Douglas, you will probably enjoy this one.
105;it really makes you think.
106;Thankfully all is explained towards the end of the movie.
107;It is worth seeing, some may not get it and some may.
108;Tom Cruise did a good job with this one.
109;this is definitely a 'hybrid' film.
110;the mood the atmosphere is awesome, and it IS spooky.
111;sweet and adorable and totally cute.
112;yes, the music is awesome.
113;yes the visuals are there.
114;it is compelling to watch, though it feels like some substance has been sacrificed for style, but to some style is enough.
115;A thought provoking movie worthy of being viewed by all people.
116;See the original version, 'Open Your Eyes' which also co. stars Penelope Cruz and has a much better male lead.
117;One of the first things you'll notice about `Vanilla Sky' is that it is a very visual piece.
118;From the opening canvas of empty streets, `Vanilla Sky' is almost too beautifully crafted.
119;I mean, she is the only reason to see this movie, and the only reason I will recommend this movie, beings that her performance is so stellar and so superb and so masterful and seriously one of the best supporting turns of the decade.
120;You want to like it, love it even, because it is visually stirring, which gives the impression that there is something there to be seen.
121;I'll keep it short and sweet
122;If you are really into movies, then this one ranks among a small handful of must.
123;lovers will adore the film
124;When wholeheartedly viewing this film, the very real attraction, love, and desire between the two can be felt .
125;stirring the viewer's emotions and drawing one into the depths of the movie with an amplified appreciation of the story, characters, and themes.
126;vanilla Sky is a carefully crafted work of art .
127;Nevertheless, the intricate details and powerful themes woven within the story are there to discover, and give the film a depth and longevity that a typical movie does not have.
128;Credit must be given to director Cameron Crowe.
129;also highly noteworthy is theVanilla Sky soundtrack, with great artists such as, R. e. m., Radiohead, Paul McCartney, Peter Gabriel, The Monkees, Sigur Ros, Bob Dylan, The Chemical Brothers, and more.
130;2nd time she's done the role, once in Spanish, once in English.
131;vanilla Sky has a lot of philosophy to it.
132;But the movie has its grounds in it.
133;Tom Cruise is a rich and handsome kid who succeeds his father's multi million dollar corporation.
134;He has everything he wants.
135;He takes the world for granted.
136;He meets a beautiful girl (penelope cruz) and feels his life has been flipped.
137;And the best part about the movie is his quest to do the impossible.
138;Vanilla Sky is an exceptional movie and I hope it takes you a dream world where the impossible becomes the possible.
139;Tom Cruise is a great actor because he isn't afraid to take chances.
140;Individuals with creative minds and imaginations will see the vision of this movie.
141;believe me, you will be on a roller.
142;what I CAN tell you is that it was one of the most jarring movies I've seen in years.
143;and I mean that in a good way.
144;There's nothing better than a movie which you'll think about long after you've seen it, and I'll never forget this one.
145;The one he forwards (and directs) is the most easily digestible, but he's open to anything.
146;Some people say that one of the effects of a good movie, is that you want to talk about it afterwards.
147;I want a film that will leave me wondering and guessing and talking about with my friends, days and months after it's over.
148;this one of my very favorite films.
149;the acting by everybody is top notch.
150;Tom shows that he can give a great performance without his great smile and charming personality in his favor.
151;The songs and score (by Nancy Wilson) fit perfectly with the visuals.
152;great job again by DP John Toll (also did Almost Famous).
153;e. g. what was real, what was a dream, etc. choose the one that most fits you, or create your own theorey.
154;That's the great thing about it.
155;A good twist to a movie validates all that comes before it.
156;p. s. I give it two stars because Tom Cruise was excellent in his part.
157;the only thing I liked about the whole movie was Cameron Diaz's line, 'Even if you don't, your body makes a promise!
158;I loved this movie it was full of action.
159;Every detail of this movie fits into place.
160;Everything makes perfect, logical sense.
161;If you don't get it, watch it again.
162;excellent soundtrack, beautiful cinematography, painfully evocative and emotion.
163;Other than that, though, one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen.
164;Highly recommended to anyone with a taste for reality.
165;He played this part just right, a little bratty, but still so cute a likable.
166;So much depth and very human (complicated part), this movie really is a masterpiece!!!
167;Love all the characters, Penelope is better in this version and so is his friend and Cameron Diaz.
168;The chemistry between David Aimes and Sofia is undeniable!!!
169;One of my favorite all time movies, awesome plot !!!!!
170;Straight to the top of my Best of List!
171;A remake of the also very good Spanish movie, Abre los Ojos (Open Your Eyes), this movie is very well done from start to finish.
172;There is a reason why those types of movies are made and make billions of dollars and a great film like Vanilla Sky goes unappreciated by the masses.
173;style ending to sum up everything.
174;And did the ending of the movie really tie everything up neatly?
175;This film was done quite well.
176;The plot was well written and the climax is well placed.
177;The characters are as well developed as they should have been.
178;This film is about a man who inherited a magazine Empire and only knows the sweet side of life and he can't truly appreciate it untill .
179;The movie is very interesting and very entertaining.
180;Its well worth the money you paid in theaters.
181;A great cast doesn't a great movie make.
182;If you enjoy science fiction type plots that will take up your entire evening, you'll love this movie.
183;This film was provocative and interesting, and caught my imagination at several points, although I sometimes suffered from the twists and turns that became outrageously confusing enough that they broke into my enjoyment.
184;Based on what I understood, I thought Cameron Diaz literally stole the movie in terms of the level of performance she delivered, with a range of emotions so well covered that she was entirely believable throughout the film.
185;dead gorgeous, and could make me believe anything she wants with a simple flutter of her eyelashes and those big beautiful eyes.
186;And even Tom Cruise, a terrific actor who sometimes grates on my nerves with his reliance on his over.
187;earnest macho deadpans as a way of emoting was very good here.
188;the movie is well choreographed and extremely pleasing in terms of the way it has been filmed, so that it is very colorful, eventful, and suspenseful.
189;But it is good (if sometime confusing) entertainment, and I highly recommend it.
190;but with the most up to date film making techniques.
191;I must admit I was absolutely hooked right up to the finish.
192;I enjoyed the way the movie made you think about actions and consequences.
193;In addition, it depicted how powerful our thoughts are in influencing our reality.
194;It is an interesting idea, however it was not thought up by the writers or directors of this film.
195;Films like The Matrix, Fight Club, Memento, etc. deal with perception of reality in a much more entertaining and original manner.
196;Of course you won't do this, but it was worth a try.
197;Also worth checking out for the attractive people and decent music.
198;I thought since Tom Cruise was in it, it was going to be great becuz every film Tom is in it's always a success.
199;That movie is excellent and will leave you satisfied.
200;A great movie, however, with a great message about having to experience the bitter in order to appreciate the sweet in life.
201;He struggles with the Board, manipulating women, and life it's self.
202;Kurt Russell does some good acting on his part.
203;This movie is a well thought out mystery and the best of Tom Cruise.
204;I liked the Vanilla Sky movie.
205;This is a romantic and suspenseful movie in my opinion.
206;Vanilla Sky is simply a masterpiece.
207;I actually found myself interested.
208;but this movie lacked a solid ending.
209;Last it's god to see Kurt Russell back on the big screen.
210;Miraculously, I hadn't learned the ending of this movie so I was prepared to enjoy a well.
211;Cruise rebuilds his life enough to enter into a relationship with Cruz.
212;All of the earlier scenes make sense.
213;made this movie and made it better.
214;he knows how to either write great original lines that seem spontaneous, or he lets the actors ad.
215;lib at the perfect times.
216;She is great in her small role, so intense.
217;better than any of her starring roles.
218;Ok movie, butnot one I will go back and watch again.
219;Tom Cruise did a good acting job along with the other cast.
220;This is a movie I will watch again.
221;Makes you think about what is real and if we create our reality in our minds.
222;Vanilla Sky is a okay movie because of David Aames (Tom Cruise)has everything he ever wanted and more since he runs a big company he even has a lover (Cameron Diaz),but soon after he meets a new girl everything changes and not in the good way.
223;the reason why it does is because of what his ex lover does to him for likeing another woman after that everthing completely changes i would explain it to you but the movie is to hard to explain but is worth a look.
224;I love how people who don't get a movie say that the people who think highly of it are acting smart just because they think it makes them smart to like a particular film.
225;It has nothing to do with intelligence in my view.
226;All it is to me is perception.
227;For those people I recommend something more along the lines of Finding Nemo, or Star Trek:The Wrath of Khan.
228;For the rest, this is a great film.
229;He is a very good actor, but this movie was not up to Cruise's caliber.
230;Really enjoyed all the twists!
231;The only good thing about this movie was Cameron Diaz' very believable performance.
232;Reminds me of Memento, 12 Monkeys, but with a lighter heart, and based on hope.
233;It deals with many topics that interest me, particularly the study of dreams vs. reality, and the nature of relationships, and love.
234;There is much that is very good about it, however it contains one major flaw that prevents it from being truly great.
235;the acting, is overall top notch.
236;Jason Lee turns in yet again another stellar supporting role
237;Cameron Diaz is a fine choice for Julianna, she brings an almost maniacal sense of urgency to her character that was both disturbing and complusively watchable
238;Her charisma is unmistakable, and she infuses this film with life and vibrancy.
239;This is a film with many powerful images, be it the gorgeous vanilla skies that soar over New York within the dream, or the (SPOILER) unforgettable image of Cruise's David Aames waving farewell to his disfigured reflection in the mirror.
240;It entices in the first viewing, draws you in irresistably, and apon further viewings still moves with great pacing, and many subtle clues and hints can be found that help the viewer understand the nature of David Aame's reality.
241;But this aside, the film is very compelling and often powerful.
242;I still love the questions it raises concerning love (if his love with Sofia wasnt real, than does it still have meaning?)
243;, and the image of I will find you in another life, when we are both cats that so powerfully emphasizes the power that love can have, and the joy and awe surrounding that human emotion.
244;This film is solid, even coming from hollywood, and with big name stars attached.
245;I would certainly recommend it to anyone who is willing to be challenged slightly by the film they watch, and those who love to be moved.
246;THis movie keeps you on your toes trying to anticiapte what is reality or what is dream.
247;Its one of those movies you need to watch again to catch all of nuisances and hints through the movie.
248;Vanilla Sky is pure art expression.
249;The scenes, coupled with a great soundtrack, depict something straight from the director/writer's mind.
250;Lots of movies are applauded for technical expertise, which isn't bad.
251;(Like the attention to detail Stanley Kubrick had for his movies.
252;This is the first movie that has, in my opinion, properly depicted a nightmare.
253;The movie, at the end, is constantly trying to explain itself.
254;It's just this huge exhilarating feeling.
255;Then it all unfolded beautifully, as if I was in someone else's mind.
256;I love Crowe for making this movie just as much as I love the movie itself.
257;Every passing minute that goes by is another chance to turn it around.
258;It will make you think about your job, friendships, relationships.
259;It's just such an interesting movie.
260;Great cast and excellent acting.
261;Soundtrack is pretty awesome as well!
262;I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants more than some superficial story line.
263;But after watching Vanilla Sky I have this newfound respect for him and his talent really does shine through in this movie.
264;Tom and Penelope are AMAZING together in this movie, and it you can totally see the chemistry between them.
265;Their love for each other is evident and Vanilla Sky was the perfect movie for them to play together in.
266;The one thing that is very striking about this movie is the music within it.
267;But watching the movie over again just to experience the music is worth it.
268;And the story plot will make you appreciate love and what it's all about.
269;I totally recommend this movie.
270;If you can actually sit, relax and go deeper into the film you will definitely like it.
271;The ending will then make the movie as clear as possible, given the convoluted nature of the movie.
272;Brings you to numerous decision points where you don't know who to believe (you do eventually)
273;meets another girl he likes better.
274;tries to get back with girl he really likes.
275;he wakes up in the street, and goes on about his life.
276;For his dream to begin there.
277;even though he wanted to live his dream state with his face fixed and with the girl he loved, the other girl he used still was in his conscious and it was interfering with his dream.
278;The technology of the future 150 years from now can fix his face and bring him back to life.
279;But dreams are so real.
280;so before he jumps, he conjures up his love again, and remembers what she said at the bar about talking to him in their next life when they are `both cats'.
281;So he is going to look for her in his new life.
282;centered playboy whose life is changed forever by the beautiful and intelligent Sophia.
283;Cruise is the film's greatest liability, since his erratic behavior reduces the brilliant character drama into a silly farce.
284;In doing so, he eliminates the subtle effectiveness that Amen bar worked so hard to create in his cleverly.
285;The beautiful irony in all of this is that the viewer will hope to wake up from the same horrible nightmare that David has found himself in by the end of the movie.
286;The ending of this movie is always what makes me watch it.
287;I kinda wish they had added an extra 15min to the movie just to see him wake up.
288;But this is a love story drama so make sure you know that going in and you'll be fine.
289;I love psychological thrillers and if you are a Cruise fan you should see this film.
290;Subsequently, however, a series of bizarre events radically disrupt David's life and his sense of confidence, which leads both him and the film's viewers to question what is real and what has actually happened to him.
291;Vanilla Sky is in fact a visual movie and it's tempting to argue that perhaps it is a visual interpretation of Abre los Ojos.
292;In Vanilla Sky many of the clues about David's life are rendered visually and at the end of the film they are explained in purely pictorial terms.
293;Abre los Ojos give us universally recognizable people and Vanilla Sky gives us caricatures from Entertainment Tonight, People Magazine, and Vanity Fair.
294;Despite the film's excessive glamorization of Julie, Cameron Diaz manages to infuse her with genuine human feeling.
295;In an extremely believable moment of rage and vulnerability, the love struck Julie confronts David with the declaration your body makes promises even when you don't!
296;while Cruise and Crowe inflate the appearance of their characters, they also manages to suck the wind out of the story's powerful conclusion.
297;The conclusion of Abre los Ojos makes a courageous distinction between the two, while Vanilla Sky just can't bring itself to do so.
298;At the end of the film, Cruise and Crowe make a small but very important change to both the plot and to Sophia's character that render their version of the film, a flashy, and sentimental distortion of the real thing.
299;the philosophical and psychological concepts of this film are fascinating but it is more appropriate to discuss them in my review of Abre los Ojos.
300;Besides being at the epicenter of all that is hip in Art, Music, and Literature, he also has good looks, youth, and last but not least, lots and lots of money.
301;I need for you to pretend we're having a scintillating conversation, and you are wildly entertained.
302;There will be a test.
303;Perhaps this is just a Minority Report, but I really enjoyed Vanilla Sky.
304;And it all unravels (or does it?)
305;Cruz was magical and Cruise gave a stellar performance.
306;It was a bold performance, as in the first part he is kind of a jerk, but semi likeable, considering he has had the world handed to him on a silver platter.
307;In the next part he has to adjust to life without his movie star smile.
308;I think this was brave and one of Tom Cruise's boldest roles.
309;She seems like she is content with the friendship with benefits, but then she lowers the boom!
310;The songs, an integral part of the 429 cultural references, are woven seamlessly into the tapestry of Vanilla Sky.
311;sof a: I'll tell you in another life, when we are both cats.
312;This was an exceptional movie, and just like the movie 'The Matrix', if you don't understand the meaning of it, you're not going to like it.
313;It is a DEEP and thought provoking movie about reality and what we 'think' is real.
314;It has you guessing what's going on until the last 10 minutes when it finally reveals itself.
315;and if you understand it, it is very powerful.
316;It is woven together with delicate skill, with subtle hints that will make more sense when you watch it a second time.
317;And this is a movie that deserves a second viewing.
318;there are some deep universal truths that are buried in here that can carried into your own life.
319;This movie is a metaphor as is The Matrix.You are living the physical lucid dream, just like the character in Vanilla Sky.
320;and just like the character, you can wake up to the real world if you want to.
321;Tom Cruise is the most charismatic and hypnotizing actor since Talma!
322;To me, he is the greatestthespian in Cinema today!
323;A virtuoso, he grabs each charater he portrays by the throat, and thengives, his fascinated audience, unparalled pleasure!
324;If you don't understand it, watch it again!
325;Spark your imagination and truly try to understand this movie.
326;I fully recommend this movie.
327;It's not a great movie, the original Spanish movie was far superior, but it was entertaining.
328;confident douchebag role to the hilt, as he always does.
329;uppance is interesting as is the twist at the end.
330;I would rather recommend The Game over this one.
331;Difficult to decifer what is a dream and what is real in this movie at times.
332;It was worth watching and had a twist in the end.
333;Over all, it was a good movie.
334;Very cool ride,frustrating mysterious but excellent journey can't go wrong here.
335;Perfect role for Tom Cruise it always keeps you guessing.
336;It really is
337;it earned my five stars, and more than that.
338;i truly love this film.
339;try and watch somewhere you can give it good attention (hard to do at 3 hours, but worth it
340;Vanilla Sky shines in a way few other movies ever do.
341;The obvious messages: it's the little things that matter, every moment is a chance to change your life, the sweet is not as sweet without the bitter have been done countless times in movies past.
342;What hasn't been done is a realistic portrayal (in the movies) of the possibilties for cryonics and life extension research for mankind.
343;the fact that the movie broaches this subject in such an ingenious way makes the movie a winner.
344;But in general the movie is very enlightening and opens the minds of those who may be blinded by myths and fairytales to the possibilities of a marvelous and REAL future of science.
345;the protagonist has enough vision to try to give himself another chance, avoid the maggots six feet under, and is rewarded for his ingenuity and courage.
346;That is a real possibility, a real chance he gives himself.
347;And that is where the movie shines.
348;it challenges the mind and it has enough twists and turns to confuse the audience several times.
349;if you want something refreshing, this is it.
350;All of the reviews who liked this, please explain to the rest of us why?!?!
351;So good I just had to watch it again!
352;Excellent the second time around.
353;while a cinematographer's dream, the story of a self.
354;Also, the trailors really set you up for a greater expectation than you come close to getting.
355;the end also seems to be one of those story.
356;But if you're a fan of good storytelling.
357;(By the way, it does have a great soundtrack!)
358;Tom Cruise may be somewhere in the nuts category in real life, but on screen he always delivers.
359;The rest of the cast bring their A game as well, but for all the great acting, it's the story and how it's structured that makes this movie so mesmerizing.
360;It will keep you guessing from start to finish and the payoff is, in my humble opinion, what makes this movie a classic.
361;Not only is the plot engaging, it presents a precipice, an edge where a seemingly romantic movie becomes deeper, engulfing love, dreams, fears, desire into a surreal vision.
362;A great movie to watch over and over, until you understand it one way, and then you see it a new way.
363;a great movie to discuss with friends the meaning you get from it.
364;And so we have Vanilla Sky, a film that sounds bigger than it is.
365;He meets Sofia, a beautiful woman who he instantly falls for overnight.
366;She dies, he lives and we find he's recounting his story about how he murdered his girlfriend later on in flashback style.
367;Tom can pull off a good performance and he certainly pulls one off here, it's quite surprising.
368;I always loved this movie because it is a bit surreal in the mind of someone who is dealing with guilt.
369;I thought that vanilla sky is one of the most unusual films in the best of ways.
370;All of the acting was first rate from the leads to the extras including Mr Spielberg.
371;Vanilla sky is like a drug, its addictive, it makes you feel good, and it opens your eyes, its like a beautiful love poem.
372;This is my favorite movie!
373;Its just the most weirdest movie I've ever seen and I mean weird in a good way, then ending is just such a surprise twist ending and I loved it!!!
374;Its a whole bunch of genres in this one movie, drama, love story, action, and science fiction.
375;So If you like the twist movies then you'll love this movie!
376;The ending helps you make since of it all, but it still wasn't enough to save this movie for me.
377;Tom Cruise does deliver a pretty good performance.
378;I will give it an F, because of the storyline and because Penelope Cruz's role was less than stellar.
379;This is not a movie that everyone will like, but I can honestly say that it is my favorite movie ever.
380;It is a movie that you will discuss for weeks if you get it.
381;If you normally enjoy thought provoking movies, and you are open.
382;minded, this is a must.
383;Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise show what a great team they are, and both penelope cruz and cameron diaz offer brilliant performances.
384;This movie to be truly understood like a good book take more than one reading.
385;This movie is one of my favorites in spite of my feelings about the star.
386;If you like movies with a lot of plot twists, dream states and general wierdness, this is your movie.
387;I loved Cruz's character from the start, not just beautiful but honest, generous and genuinely caring .
388;Cruise on the other hand is making a real break from the adolescent parts he normally plays and carries the performance well.
389;The story is original (something desperately lacking these days) and some might say far fetched but is a great backdrop for exploring the whole theme of LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriendshipSex.
390;Not one of Tom Cruise best movies.
391;His best friend played by Jason Lee is a loyal friend dispite the fact that David disregards his feelings on the drop of a dime, even going as far as to take the one woman that his friend really digs.
392;At this point of the film you really dislike this guy.
393;He rich, good looking and pretty much better than everyone else, and he knows it, so he flaunts it.
394;She tells him she loves him and that she needs him and then.
395;The acting is superb on the parts of the lesser players.
396;Diaz gives an oscar worthy performance as proven by her SAG nomination for the part and Jason Lee as the loyal yet betrayed best friend and even Kurt Russell as his shrink trying to understand the mess he's in does a great job.
397;The movie will have you guessing and it may even take 2 or 3 watches to fully get what's going on but it's well worth the time spent.
398;Great concept for a film and I hear it's a remake of a film starring Penelope Cruz called 'Open your Eyes'.
399;can't judge between the two beings that I've never seen the first one but from the other reviews I gather that this version is the better of the 2.
400;watch it and love it and remember to open your eyes.
401;the answers are right in front of you.
402;definately a style over substance film!
403;this is seriously one of the best movies i have ever seen in my entire life, by far cameron crowe's greatest in my opinion.
404;first of all i can understand how some people may feel that the ending is a cop.
405;but if you really think about it, it all fits together perfectly.
406;it's amazing how profound this movie is, how many levels it has.
407;it speculates on the future well.
408;it tells us to appreciate these things b/c we never know when the consequences of the decisions we make will turn our whole life around in a matter of moments and possibly face us w/ our own mortality, the mortality that makes us human.
409;he realizes this in the end and that's why he chooses to wake up from his dream.
410;i love this movie so much b/c it's so philosophical
411;it says to open our eyes and see things for how they really are.
412;He has a good line to that effect: you don't know the exquisite pain of the guy who goes home alone and also his speech on love being the sour and the sweet, where the former makes one appreciate the latter.
413;penelope Cruz really has a thankless role here.
414;maybe the cinematography of Monet's vanilla sky realized, plus Nancy Wilson's melancholy theme Elevator Beat made it worth watching, but other than that.
415;I enjoyed this movie immensely.
416;Tom Cruise proves himself to be a gifted actor, the angelic Penelope Cruz is delightful, Cameron Diaz is great
417;I know, this is a remake of the Spanish Obre las Ojos, yet it does represent something unique among recent American releases.
418;I can also understand why some people may be confused about the movie as the story progresses, but I found it quite understandable by the end.
419;these are the determiners of life itself, and any movie that can really make you think about your own life and existence in a serious manner wins my highest praises.
420;this strikes me as rather a bold career move for Tom Cruise, especially given the fact that his character has his face disfigured in an accident.
421;her beauty is matched by a mesmerizing air of mystery which plays incredibly well in this particular motion picture.
422;feature about the making of the movie.
423;The interview with Paul McCartney is short and sweet, and I must admit that I didn't realize that he had contributed the title song to the movie until I watched the interview.
424;Even if there were no extras, Vanilla Sky is definitely a movie worth owning.
425;one of the best soundtracks every put together.
426;I'll admit it, one of the reasons this movie works is because of the music.
427;It has always disturbed me that this wonderful film didn't recieve the praise it deserved from audiences or critics.
428;twisting thriller is one of the most intricately woven and ultimately satisfying I've ever seen.
429;a man in a facial prosthetic gives the account of the last few months of his life to a psychiatrist from a prison cell.
430;He had run a national publishing company, was filthy rich, had glamorous parties with beautiful women, a loyal best friend, and then met the love of his life.
431;All perfectly timed and executed to maximum impact.
432;Appreciate this masterpiece for what it is.
433;Pay attention to the details and you'll leave the film feeling enlightened and nostalgic.
434;The beauty of the movie is that it gives you an answer and then it all makes sense.
435;I suppose that many people that dislike this film just do not care for the uncertainty it creates, that is the reason I liked it.
436;he wanted to take his life from that point and make it happy from there.
437;I believe the Fast and the Furious is available for you.
438;Another point about this movie is that it touches on the effect of pop culture in our lives.
439;The movies we see, the music we hear, etc.
440;It all has an effect on us as we go through life .
441;Last point is the music, there is a lot of great music in this film .
442;And it's used to great effect .
443;the song Can We Still be Friends is powerful, and the Elevator Beat is both sentimental and haunting.
444;The description given is accurate enough.
445;This is a haunting movie, one that really makes you think, one that expands your boundaries.
446;It's worth seeing for that reason alone.
447;Cameron Diaz was good, in Vanilla Sky.
448;Najwa Nimri is better, in Abre los Ojos.
449;Cruise actually does a pretty good job, in his version, he catches much of what is in the Spanish, something of the way The Magnificent 7 captures the spirit of the Kurosawa film it was based on.
450;One of the best movies of the last 10 years or so, alongside The Sixth Sense, Memento, The Usual Suspects, and Twelve Monkeys.
451;(That's a very pretty Cruise movie that has a comic book plot that a five year old can understand.)
452;attention material, and, like Memento, even better upon a second viewing.
453;you'll find this surreal dreamscape of a movie by Cameron Crowe.
454;Both my wife and I found this to be a far better movie than Mulholland Drive, which we watched a few weeks earlier.
455;but the film holds your interest and provides some food for thought.
456;time greats, but well worth watching .
457;One was how much I loved the movie, and the other was the single most negative audience response I have ever witnessed.
458;Just a twisting, turning narrative that you absolutely will not see coming.
459;it's fantastically directed, and the acting talent is spotless, but the real joy of Vanilla Sky is watching the story twist and turn and shift genres seemingly at random, pulling the rug out from under you every thirty seconds.
460;in actuality, I would have found it much more believable and interesting had he made the opposite choice.
461;The ending is basically a signpost saying That's it, we're done with your head.
462;Overall, This is a film you will either love or hate.
463;if anything, repeated viewings are more enjoyable than the first, as the characters and situations make more sense in light of the movie's 'truth.'
464;I haven't really seen a film like it, and I loved every minute of it.
465;This is a lovely and perplexing and thoroughly enjoyable film.
466;I love Cameron Crowe, his other works are so much better than this one.
467;It wasn't HORRIBLE, it was decent.
468;i thought the menues were great.
469;They were well beyond great.
470;I just love the menues.
471;I'm just going to tell you the good things, the pro's.
472;The actors did a good job.
473;Tom Cruise, as always, he was very good.
474;well, lets just say she should definitely stick to Spanish films.
475;At least then she had respect.
476;the script was great, i thought.
477;i guess it was a good movie.
478;i mean the movie overall was decent and its a great disc.
479;In one of the most beautiful and surreal films I've seen in years, Crowe takes the audience on a mind bending trip through the subconcious.
480;Reality and fantasy become indistinguishable and when the ride is over the human experience is unvieled.
481;Tom Cruise gives an oscar worthy performance.
482;I saw this movie 4 times at the theater and found something new every time.
483;I am not so fond of him but liked the movie in general
484;I really love this movie.
485;the storyline was well written.
486;Will keep you on the edge.
487;For the price and story line.
488;penelope Cruz is more playful here than she was in Open Your Eyes and her role here is somewhat larger.
489;Crowe makes sure she has ample time in front of the camera to mesmerize us, and she does.
490;As others have said, Crowe's insistence in using classic rock songs throughout the picture takes a bit away from the flow of the movie
491;the first viewing really screws with your head.
492;I love movies like this .
493;(Open Your Eyes), by the way.
494;I think that the viewer has to be looking for a certain kind of experience to enjoy this movie.
495;In the right mindset, it is an interesting way to spend a couple of hours.
496;It was clearly an inspiration for Inception, so if that's your thing (as it is mine) dig in and enjoy.
497;This really throws you for a spin and Tom Cruise is good at that.
498;Now, personally I thought this to be one of the top 3 films I've ever seen.
499;that's the beauty of this film: appreciating the small nuances you just pick up the more you watch it.
500;You can watch the movie once, try to determine what you thought its purpose was, and go back and build on your hypothesis, which is probably right, because the movie works on so many levels.
501;i think the problem most people have with the movie is it actually works on their subconsicous, which is a very powerful thing.
502;'It has a very surreal taste, and maybe some just don't like it.
503;Although I am not crazy about Tom Cruize, This had a good story line and easy to listen to.
504;That said, I really loved this film!
505;The unsettling opening scenes hooked me completely!
506;:)Cameron Diaz is very good, her beauty and vivaciousness superbly twisted into something frightening.
507;Kurt Russell is wonderful as the psychologist looking for truth, especially when he finds it.
508;if I had to explain this to someone, I would say this
509;go see this film on it's own terms.
510;This is an incredible movie.
511;totally amazing performance delivered by Cruise, and amazing direction by Cameron Crowe.
512;it's an amazing story ( matryx anyone??? )
513;It has touches of romance, suspense and it's even a bit scary.
514;great music for your delight and fine fine performances by Jason Lee, Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz.
515;Cruise stars as David who thinks he has the perfect life.
516;He has money, good looks, and is surounded by beautiful women all the time.
517;This movie kept me guessing untill the very end.
518;A definate good one to see.
519;This movie is a love story with some sci.
520;fi elements awkwardly thrown in, but there are some moments of good acting and dialogue that make it worth watching.
521;This is one of the most mind boggling movies ive ever seen shy of Pi and Dark City.
522;The music track goes extremly well with this movie.
523;Tom Cruise is top notch in the film.
524;Jason Lee does a great job as well as Penelope Cruz.
525;This is a masterpiece of modern film making.
526;It has everything, comedy, action, thrills, love, drama.
527;This is my new favorite film.
528;Mark my words, this will be held as a classic film and is setting new examples in todays standards.
529;high achievement Almost Famous, it boggles the mind how Cameron Crowe managed to plunge into the abyss that is Vanilla Sky.
530;I feel this remake is excellent, though many prefer the original.
531;This version is noted to be more visually stimulating with contemporary music.
532;The music is very engaging and the film is set in New York with very artistic dream like scenes through out.
533;A very well edited and rather artistic film.
534;The story line is part science fiction and tragic love story.
535;She is charming and beautiful in both.
536;It is definitely one of my favorites.
537;The bigger scenes are startling and beautiful.
538;Cruise is surprisingly convincing in the role, moving from his more typical sunny, confident extrovert persona, through to deeper, more conflicted and ambivalent individual, as the story develops.
539;With the exception of the occasional jarring music video fast.
540;edited scenes, the movie was visually amazing.
541;Vanilla Sky is an excellent movie.
542;Overall this movie is a great story and it shows how money and power are not needed in love, and what counts are the feelings deep down inside of the individual.
543;If you love philosophy and movies that don't make sense until you watch it the second time around then I recommend this movie.
544;i enjoyed the whole movie, especially the plot twists and the suprisingly science fiction storyline (watch it and youll see what i mean by the end of the movie).
545;Tom Cruise does and amazing job portraying a confused yet dedicated character in this movie.
546;plots keep you guessing the entire movie.
547;This movie is a mind bending rollercoaster that will keep you hooked and interested the entire way though.
548;The plot of this movie is absolutely amazing, and the cast of characters (Tom Cruise, Phenolpe Cruz, Cameron Diaz) makes this movie amazing.
549;If you want to see a movie that will keep you hooked the entire time, and leave you with a sense of guessing, this is the movie.
550;This is it,in my opinion this is the finest,most amazingly mind blowing film ive ever watched,n i've seen quite a few.
551;i've heard mixed opinions of the film,one of my close friends loved it and a few liked it and the rest thought it was ok.
552;i think tom cruise is one of the best actors at the moment,along with brad pitt and he is fantastic in this.
553;after watching it the first time i walked around in a daze with a permanent grin on my face (bit like Tom),wanting to fall in love and dream and also wanting to watch it again straight away.
554;every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around.
555;I've loved Vanilla Sky since the first time I saw it.
556;Life immitating art, art immitating life.
557;in short, it's a great film on many levels.
558;It's a thriller, it's a drama, it makes you think.
559;I definitely think this movie is a classic, that may be appreciated in a greater sense somewhere down the line.
560;Right now, Tom Cruise's personal life overshadows how great this moview actually is.
561;choose type of flick, this one takes some delightful twists and turns that you will likely not see coming.
562;having a philosophy degree, I did enjoy how the story toyed around with the concept of solipsism.
563;what I liked the most about the movie was its symmetry.
564;then it smehow manages to pulls up from a crash landing at the very end making it almost worth watching.
565;a much better flick is his latest with Speilberg, Minority Report.
566;This version is by far the better of the two.
567;As if it's cooler to say the original will always be the best.
568;You can tell that much thought has gone into the songs chosen and it works incredibly well.
569;You can tell that each song means something to the film makers involved and most probably to you also.
570;After all, with that type meal in the stomach, the Sticky could just close his eyes and imagine how great this movie could have been (as oppose to how freaking [bad] it was).
571;I didnt have the luck seeing this in the movie house!
572;Cameron Crowe's fifth film is brilliantly orchestrated.
573;I simply loved every twist and turn of this film.
574;this film, I believe, marks a departure for Cameron Crowe's film making.
575;top, yet at the same time, poignantly real.
576;Cruz and Diaz are wonderful.
577;all in all, Vanilla Sky is visually stimulating
578;This is a film for film buffs.
579;perspective than our own linear, rationalistic and materialist Western one.
580;the whole point of this movie, of which the Life Extension device is just a metaphor, is that most people actually live their lives like the Tom Cruise character after his accident: actually in an artificially preserved state of life, they struggle against their unconscious (which is full of guilt and repression) and try to make a beautiful sunny sunny happy happy MTV kitsch.
581;as an exceptionally fortunate billionaire heir who is both rich and handsome and has just about what any man could wish for, there is a scene where he tells his buddy that he's living the dream.
582;mainly, his youth and physical beauty, which form the core of his narcissistic identity and priorities.
583;if all the above just goes above your head, watch the film for Penelope Cruz.
584;she is absolutely irresistible, this small but unspeakably gorgeous woman could charm the Devil himself!
585;Cameron Diaz is scarily realistic, and very cute as usual.
586;Cruise actually puts in a pretty competent performance, while Kurt Russell and Jason Lee shine.
587;This my my favorite movie of all time.
588;I would recommend this as a must see.
589;Great film and great price!
590;Vanilla Sky is one of those films that lingers in your mind after viewing,It is the story of a rich arrogant man (Tom Cruise) who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth due to his father leaving him a publishing empire.
591;i highly recommend it for anyone that has not yet seen it.
592;Others here have done a great job of describing the basic plot of this film, but after watching it on pay.
593;Then on top of this, the story is a mind bender only to conceal the ending.
594;The only scene worth wathcing in this whole movie is when they get in that car crash, but that was probably only worth seeing in the movie theater with the great sound and big screen.
595;This is an eerie, unusual, dare I say bizarre film.
596;The acting was excellent and the settings and background all fine but be prepared to not know what is is and was all about.
597;This movie reminded me of Inception, but funny enough, Inception came out years AFTER this movie.
598;Could have made it semi worth it if she was nude.
599;The movie itself is amazing .
600;It keeps you in suspense and just when you think you've got it all figured out it takes another twist .
601;You will see that it will keep you guessing and it won't make sense at times, but it all comes together in the end.
602;I can count on one hand the times this has happened to me over a lifetime of movie viewing.
603;otherwise you'll deprive yourself of one incredible movie ride.
604;this movie is visually spectacular.
605;And this is probably the most polarizing movie I have ever seen.
606;jason Lee and Cameron Diaz give the performances of their careers.
607;Kurt Russell has a relatively small part as Cruise's psychologist, but he nails it perfectly.
608;I liked Vanilla Sky a lot more than Abre Los Ojos, unlike most American remakes of foreign films, because it contains additional scenes and more spectacular visuals.
609;the real value of this film is that it makes you think about what (and more importantly, who) is at the core of your own life, and how will you feel about how you have lived when the clock runs out?Vanilla Sky is a rare movie.
610;unique in plot, and made with passion and care.
611;The acting in Abre was great, but the cinematography of Vanilla was even better.
612;Intriguing film that will have you scratching your head until the very end.
613;This effect (in my book) is always deserving of 5 stars!
614;Really worth watching if you have the time to just sit down and enjoy it as it keeps you always thinking throughout the film.
615;got to my house quickly and was in good condition.
616;i also bought spun, requiem for a dream, eyes wide shut, and train spotting.
617;Thankfully, I was very surprised .
618;this is an entertaining film with unpredictable twists and turns, some of which are in the same style of Jacob's Ladder and Phillip K. Dick stories.
619;He quite unexpectedly meets the woman of his dreams, and from there, things begin a completely unpredictable course of events that rapidly spiral out of his control .
620;The plot is engaging, and I was wondering what would happen next.
621;It's also an aesthetic treat, with well.
622;crafted scenes and beautiful colors (and even the sky scenes have a story behind them.)
623;The special features are entertaining, giving behind.
624;scenes glimpses with the cast and filmmakers, as well as some insight into how the film came to be.
625;An enjoyable experience, start to finish.
626;But the acting was good.
627;Vanilla Sky is an absolutely breathtaking, spell.
628;binding masterpiece from Cameron Crowe.
629;sharply written, beautifully acted, and imaginatively directed, this is one of the best (and most underrated) films of 2001!
630;fi fans and the rest of you won't really enjoy it or understand what went on.
631;What is going on here!Those are all the things I thought as I saw this movie about 4 times.
632;This is probably a love it or hate it movie!
633;Others are thoughtful and remain in the memory for some time.
634;Vanilla Sky is the best film I have ever seen.
635;The only film that has actually affected how I live life.
636;I saw the film in the cinema and I thought I liked it but I wasn't 100% sure because I didn't understand it fully.
637;the soundtrack of the film is incredible.
638;It's human nature to be tempted into wronful actions.
639;He could have lived another 40 years in happiness and true love.
640;like all lady or tiger stories, the film will generate great debates among the intelligentsia about which parts of the story are real and which are the dreams.
641;Crowe keeps us guessing until the very last frame at which point he throws us the final curve and abruptly ends the film.
642;That's what makes the film fun, if you like that sort of thing.
643;as is always the case with Cameron Crowe, the presentation is innovative and visually interesting.
644;Crowe has a terrific and unique way of crafting his films that is very engaging.
645;In this regard, he succeeds spectacularly.
646;the acting ranges from good to great.
647;It is hard to render a character when the director demands that his/her motivations and personality keep changing, but the cast adapts beautifully.
648;Since the entire film is essentially shot from his perspective, it is important that we share his bewilderment and consternation, which means he must project those emotions onto us.
649;This he does with extraordinary effect, delivering a gut wrenching performance that takes him (and us) to the brink of insanity.
650;penelope Cruz is excellent as his sexy and supportive love interest.
651;Diaz swings from sweet and adorable to vicious and maniacal with such ease that it is frightening.
652;Jason Lee is also good as Aames' fickle best friend and rival.
653;Lee naturally projects a trustworthy persona, so when he turns on Aames it creates the startling effect that Crowe wants.
654;Kurt Russell is okay as the psychologist, but this is a more cerebral role than his skills can handle.
655;Russell is a naturally visceral performer, great in roles as the tough guy with a big heart.
656;this film is deviously crafted and expertly presented with deft performances by the cast.
657;energy enthusiasm for the film and the contributions of his collaborators.
658;The surround mix isn't especially busy, but it avoids watering down Nancy Wilson's terrific soundtrack.
659;the featurette Hitting it Hard is a fun pop documentary about the world press tour for the film.
660;It's a must for Cruise fans, stylistically combining A Hard Day's Night with Blair Witch.
661;The movie is OK, the acting is average and Cruise makes a good role, BUT.
662;Interesting idea, nice look and an uncomfortable feel make this movie what it is.
663;This movie is a masterpiece, and the last fifteen minutes are sheer ecstasy.
664;Then you look back and see the brilliance of everything that transpired before.
665;And Tom Cruise gives perhaps his best performance ever.
666;But the ending provides full redemption and an appreciation for everything that happened earlier.
667;This movie is one of the most brilliant movie's ever made.
668;This choice caused him great consequences.
669;But it was so great, it felt as though I had an epiphony.
670;And for that, this is my favorite movie of all time.
671;Movie is fast enough to keep your attention.
672;This is a truly bizzare film.
673;There are a lot of genres here including romance, sci.
674;Tom Cruise and all of the co. stars including Cruz, Cameron, Russell and Mewes are excellent.
675;The use of music in this film is so bizarre, but it really works and the choice in music is great for this type of film (Wait for Good Vibrations).
676;If you like David Lynch type films, you'll definitely enjoy this.
677;This one is a truly original ride!
678;Boy and girl are happy and form a relationship.
679;The trailer hinted at a mystery and suspense.
680;Vanilla Sky is so sad, so true, so brilliant.
681;Vanilla Sky is a beautiful tale, a message so rarely received: .
682;well, I shouldn't tell my version, it's best told in the movie.
683;Their expressions are so subtle, their sadness is so true that it's hard to believe it is just acting.
684;last note: This is a good case study comparing Open Your Eyes and Vanilla Sky.
685;The latter is modern, easy to connect to and to be moved by, the original misses the point: the audience.
686;(I was born and raised in Europe, and I hope they will once again return to continue making great movies.
687;I love this movie and was ecsatic to find it at a good price, yet when I played it, it skipped a few times.
688;Vanilla Sky is simultaneously a completely original piece of art, and yet is also based on a Spanish film from a few years before, Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes) which also starred Penelope Cruz in the same role that she plays in Vanilla Sky.
689;sky is staying fairly close to the source material, yet it has created this world that Tom Cruise finds himself in that is unlike anything else.
690;this is something you have to pay attention to, and potentially watch multiple times to truly enjoy and appreciate what director Cameron Crowe has created.
691;While some may argue that there's only one true explanation, as I look back on the film I can see how it is very easy to come to the conclusion that it is one of any of those three or four explanations.
692;excellent performances by Cruise, Cruz and Cameron Diaz, along with great supporting performances by Jason Lee (Chasing Amy, Enemy of the State, My Name is Earl) and Kurt Russell (Unlawful Entry, Fast and The Furious 7).
693;this is an intelligent and thought provoking work of art that demands multiple viewings to truly appreciate.
694;if you give it your attention, and Open Your Eyes , then perhaps you will be rewarded with an enjoyable experience.
695;order now, with this great price folks.
696;this is a great movie for repeat viewings.
697;It is a layered complex story that is as enjoyable watching with the Director's commentary as it is just enjoying the movie.
698;the characters are beautiful ,the script is real and intelligent in terms of dialogue , and the message is life and love.
699;david Ames is a narcissistic man with all of life at his doorstep.
700;He has the life we all want and then is turned upside down.
701;The story itself is a blend of sci.
702;fi and fantasy but the ultimate message in the end is one of appreciating all the little things and the joy of being in love with life and finding that someone who gets who you are.
703;the film is complex and bears repated viewings just to see all the clues that show you where it is going.
704;It is a lovingly crafted movie that I would love to see a Director's cut of someday.
705;the soundtrack provides a moving score and is deftly synchronized with the tone of the movie.
706;it is a great date movie to watch with somebdoy special in your life and the have a chance to discuss it.
707;Yes there are some good performances but in the end this is just a load of self.
708;This is an incredible film.
709;This movie has a philosophical dimension .
710;it's a work of art, and like all works of art, it's not about getting it , it's about.
711;opening your eyes, your minds, being challenged!
712;Without giving away the movie I can say that this movie is simply a modern day love story.
713;If you believe in love and want to experience the harsh realities associated with love and life , this movie is a must.
714;Considered one of Tom Cruise's best performances ever this movie will leave you guessing and wanting more.
715;I personally watched this movie twice already and everytime I watch it I see something new.
716;What make this movie so great is the many interpretations that the audience will have.
717;Guaranteed to interest you and leave you blown away.
718;This was the best movie I have ever seen.
719;The lesson from this movie is that life is finite, and you should cherish the good times when they happen.
720;The good times are like magic.
721;Those themes are all footnotes to the main topic being that the good times don't last and you'd be smart to take care of them when they happen.
722;The last ten minutes of the movie were brilliant, .
723;It really makes you appreciate what you have and why you have it.
724;Despite all the twists and turns, it has a message that everyone should recognize.
725;Course, you have to pay attention, and being a bit emotionally deep helps alot.
726;At any rate, it was damn good.
727;While the movie might appear to be cleverly choreographed it is actually open to the viewers individual interpretation.
728;after digesting the movie, I liked it a little more.
729;Vanilla Sky is a good movie, not great, but good.
730;The best thing about it is that it kept me, and my wife, who always figures out whodunnit early on, guessing right up to the end.
731;Try as I might, I cannot neglect the fact that Tom Cruise is a talented actor, and Vanilla Sky may be his best performance since Born on the 4th of July.
732;is like a Schwinn bicycle with a powerful speedboat motor fitted to it.
733;it has it's moments: I loved the soundtrack and I appreciated that Crowe was trying his hardest to create his own Memento.
734;so commentary, I understand that for him this was a huge artistic risk.
735;Real talent in all the principles who gave it their best.
736;there is a lot of suspense and confusion in the plot.
737;he's one fine actor and it's sadly plus interestingly real to know what a life it can be for someone who's had his face disfigured.
738;the film has many such dialogues and scenes that leave you smiling.
739;The purpose of my review is to tell you that any and most movie lovers would actually dig this.
740;please note,anyone who liked the Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind , will like like this movie.
741;I didnt like the movie as much I liked Vanilla Sky.
742;it's done with a more we want your money,watcher theme.
743;anyhow,WATCH THIS MOVIE for the love of originality.
744;also,it has the best soundtrack any movie can have.
745;with much muted respect for originality,HSA
746;Rule number one: Watch this movie once and for all.
747;but I swallowed it and I liked it!Both Cruise and Cruz did a GREAT job.
748;personally I think one of the best ACTING jobs for Tom Cruise is this movie!
749;it's a beautiful work of art, not the next Mission Impossible .
750;The opening scenes lead you into the movie's blueprint.
751;if you have a sense of life and an imagination.you'll like it.
752;Reminds me of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner with his signature lighting effects.
753;Felt like an Ode to that other famous fabulous director.
754;Watching it twice made the ending even more phenomenal.
755;Another fabulous work of art that reminds me a bit of Vanilla Sky .
756;A guy who's had everything handed to him, and is callously carefree and confident?
757;That can be fun, and necessary in a who.
758;David's life, as well as the story, was fine up until that point, but afterwards, it didn't make any sense, even when I rewinded and watched scenes again.
759;The main reason that I felt so strongly was the fact that Vanilla Sky is a remake of a very good movie called Open Your Eyes.
760;I recommend Open Your Eyes which has Penelope Cruz also over Vanilla Sky 100% but it is in spanish and you have to read subtitles but it is worth it.
761;This movie is undboutedly the most powerful, if not the greatest movie I have ever seen.
762;then your mind will be blown by this absolute masterpiece.
763;It simply covers all bases and is absolutely gorgeous.
764;If you have half a brain you will be completely riveted throughout this bit of perfection, and then left feeling extremely drained and shaken up at how truly amazing his movie is.
765;thank you Cameron Crowe for giving the world a movie that is truly perfect.
766;But if you love it, you will really love it.
767;Vanilla Sky is a tough film to rate.
768;Certainly, it was a stunning movie.
769;at least with the first viewing.
770;He meets Sofia Serrano, realizes there is more to love than one.
771;It is a film to enjoy only when one has plenty of time to absorb the deeper meanings beyond the time spent watching the film itself.
772;There are some movies that can pull off the mind.
773;Cameron Crowe really comes through visually on this one, and it is quite a treat to look at.
774;The sound is also fantastic.
775;The music is wonderful to listen to, and is probably one of, if not the best soundtrack of last year.
776;tom Cruise, while he has had his decent preformances, laughs his way through this one.
777;worthy actually, since the script never really let's them get to that point.
778;It builds on all of these elements of curiosity and wonder, just to explain every single one of them with one explanation.
779;fi twists and turns, this is a still a deeply moving and affecting film (although people who prefer A to B to C movies should probably avoid it).
780;Each one of us will have to decide.
781;If you are interested in another dimension in Life, when Scientists are actually saying, today, that, they found outour world is actually a halogram, this might be of interest to you.
782;Great acting, mind boggling experience, not untrue.
783;very enjoyable movie, leaving something to think about.
784;Then at about 20 mins into the film I was hooked!
785;tom Cruise gives a great performance as David Ames.
786;Cameron Crowe did a great job with putting the film together.
787;This film is in the top 10 best films of the year.
788;I haven't watched the special features yet but they look really good.
789;He goes and everything is fine until she starts questioning him on why he spent the night with her.
790;Vanilla Sky, an entertaining, somewhat clunky drama, offers Tom Terrific the chance to play a vain, super.
791;rich New Yorker who emerges from a near.
792;fi, part psychodrama and part let's see if Tom Terrific could snag an Oscar nomination.
793;all the magic, mistery, consistency, stellar playings, soul and many merits have thrown away to the W. c in the american remake.
794;give yourself a favour and see the original and then think about this Disney farce.
795;It also had a lot of nudity and sexuality.
796;He wants us to know he's an ACTOR.
797;i really enjoyed this movie.
798;One of Tom Cruise's more unique movies coupled with a great soundtrack.
799;One of my favorite movies.
800;I love movies about dreaming and alternate reality.
801;I was glued to this movie and didn't want to get up for ANY reason for fear of missing something.
802;This film is one that keeps your attention and you cannot guess the ending for anything.
803;it's wildly entertaining and the twists and turns are as equally thrilling as any roller coaster.
804;the Times Square scene was brilliant, and even more fascinating than the one shot by Amenabar (the director of Open Your Eyes) in the original, partly because Times Square is something that exists closer to home, rather than something in far off Spain.
805;Eerily shot, it features the entire Times Square in New York empty, with not a single person in sight, and is a brilliant setup to the rest of the movie.
806;In the original, the lighting is very dark, and chilling, and the movie has a very dark thriller tone to it.
807;But Vanilla Sky is shot with brilliantly bright colors that make the entire movie glow with a certain vibe and energy, and that exist to make the movie sometimes even more chilling in its own right.
808;While the first featured a deep and amazing score by Amenabar, this second featured many pop culture references, and a more modern sound to it .
809;But even without having a sense of mystery for me to judge, it was still a stunningly original experience, and one which had me engrossed in the entire movie.
810;There is always a certain moment in a brilliant performance that defines the entire role, a certain scene in which I can only describe as a spark, a place where the actor/actress connects with the audience.
811;The rest of the cast was also stellar as always, though I would have liked to see more of Kurt Russell as the psychiatrist at the end of this movie.
812;Others may interpret this in an entire other way.
813;all in all, Vanilla Sky is one of the more intelligent, compelling, and fascinating movies of 2001.
814;I am glad to say that Vanilla Sky is a piece of art in its own right, as equally colorful and vivid as the Monet painting hanging in David's apartment.
815;Tom Cruise is one of the best actors of our time.
816;I rate his work in this movie as one of his best, this was probably one of his most difficult roles to play and I'm still thinking about his character.
817;the rest of the actors, do marginally well.
818;With this film Mr. Crowe is attempting to do something more in the relm of the late Stanly Kubrick.
819;The most notable thing is the promo world tour (you get to see the relationship between Tom and his new love develop, how sweet.
820;I watched it today and was pleasantly surprised that it was actually a pretty good movie.
821;Give it a chance and I'll bet you will enjoy it as well.
822;this in excellent condition and a must have for my minimal collection.
823;I guess I'm in the love it crowd .
824;very unpredictable which is rare!
825;it's just a pretty darn good flick.
826;by the way, Noah Taylor did a fine job as Mr. Confuso at the end of the film.
827;Taylor is always so interesting to watch.
828;Such as his performance as the young David Helfgott, both maturing and distorting in Shine .
829;And he makes a great foil for Kurt Russell.
830;Although still quite young, Taylor has a knowing but reassuring vibe.
831;She can be so sweet and delightful when heroic as in MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, and CHARLIE'S ANGELS.
832;Ties everything up nicely at the end.
833;I would recommend this move!
834;It is Tom Cruise's best performance.
835;(If you are a Tom Cruise fan you should check out Minority Report, also a masterpiece).
836;IMHO whenever you cry at a movie it means that the film is so good you forget you are watching a movie.
837;Tears aside, this is a movie that really makes you think about important things like love and what it means to be alive.
838;altering, to say the least.
839;I put this movie right up there with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
840;provoking, horrifying, funny, sad, surprising and just plain brilliant.
841;But now that I own it and have seen it again a few more times, I really see every aspect of this movie, and realize it is a true masterpiece.
842;Probably the most profound movie of the new century, if not in the Top 5 of the last one.
843;So i suggest you seeing this movie only if you like science fiction for it is the main theme besides love.
844;Reuniting Cameron Crowe (the most romantic director in Hollywood this side of Baz Lurhman) and Tom Cruise for the first time since Jerry Maguire, the two come together to forge a magical, hynoptic, elegant, polished film about redemption, hope, status and above all else, love.
845;It's scarily effective film making from a director not renowned for his use of avante guarde imagery.
846;the earth shattering event that quite figuratively destroys his life, brings him down from so high above the rest of us to bury him at a status that renders him emotionally distraught and Cruise portrays this with heart wrenching honesty and intensity.
847;A masterful move on Crowe's part as the audience feels almost exactly as the 'hero' of the piece, thereby providing an 'emotional anchor' for the remaining events that play out.
848;The beautifully orchestrated chaos of the last two hours is finally explained in a tour de force of editing and deft handedly paced flash back scenarios/montage, culminating in one of the emotionally resounding endings to a Hollywood blockbuster/drama seen in recent years.
849;the final message in Vanilla Sky is one of pure hope that strikes a powerful chord with anyone that has felt, at some point in their life, they were not in control of the events that spiral around them.
850;open your eyes and experience the 'uniqueness' of Vanilla Sky and wonder why you waited so long to see it.
851;In my opinion he is one of the greatest actors of my generation.
852;While looking for a movie to watch on my Fire, I decided to take a chance.
853;Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz earned new respect from me, and Kurt Russell was amazing.
854;Give the film a chance.
855;And if you want to compare it to Abre Los Ojos, go right ahead.
856;The acting in this movie is rock solid all around.
857;the first 45 minutes or so are excellent, but after that.
858;Penelope Cruz is fun to watch, and Cruise is really effective in all the character's moods and twists of fate.
859;Tom Cruise is a great actor.
860;I tried watching it for 10 minutes and it was all about how great Tom Cruise is and being among the glitterati.
861;Vanilla Sky is one of my favorite Tom Cruise movies and is a very emotional and thought provoking experience that will affect you for a very long time !
862;you have to watch the entire movie closely until the story all comes together at the very end and even then, you still might have to watch it again to fully understand it's true meaning.
863;The film is absolutely fantastic, with it's mysterious and confusing scenes.
864;Tom Cruise delivers a great performance as David Aames jr. and, together with Cameron Crowe, he has created a piece of art.
865;I hailed Steven Spielberg and his A. i., and I definitely see some resemblence between the two extra.
866;The search for thruth and a real life is an important theme in both movies and you experience great endings that you never would have imagined.
867;I recommend this movie to a person who loves the surreal and embraces confusement until the end, when the answer is presented in an unlikely fashion.
868;Also, the score is remarkable with artists like Bob Dylan and Paul McCartney.
869;this is clearly psycho drama, and a damn fine one at that.
870;Combining this premise with the additional interesting field from the late eighties of lucid dreaming, with the always wonderful Jason Lee, made for an interesting and entertaining film for me.
871;Tom Cruise is a silver spoon playboy, gleefully slacking through life and Cameron Diaz.
872;Jason Lee, as Tom's erstwhile buddy gets some great monologues reminiscent of his characters in Kevin Smith's comedies.
873;What is real, what is a dream or lucid dream.
874;cruise's rich, handsome and happily shallow character has bought himself a custom.
875;This heaven comes complete with his favorite sky, a vanilla.
876;Strands of Hindu mysticism are subtly woven through this film, hinting of something beautifully infinite and strange.
877;The movie's soundtrack heightens the mood and mind.
878;maybe you will in another lifetime, when you are a cat.
879;There are many things to admire about it.
880;For me, the romantic idea of being blissfully and timelessly sustained in a dream about finding one's true love is sweeter than a vanilla sky.
881;The film as a whole is perfect!
882;This film was a journey.
883;Very fun, very adult, very emotional.
884;It may be the best overall film I have ever seen.
885;What a piece of pretentious garbage Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise have served up here!I loved Almost Famous, and have enjoyed many of Crowe's other films.
886;I'm not a big Cruise fan, but he's been good in some films, including Jerry McGuire.
887;Cruise's character has friends and lovers, but you can't see why.
888;I've yet to find anyone who liked this movie.
889;Penelope Cruz plays the woman who transforms Cruise into a good man .
890;He also uses so many pop.
891;This movie is one of the best ever made.
892;If you enjoyed Memento, Matrix, Fight Club.
893;Vanilla Sky starts out as an interesting movie, depicting the spoiled life of a rich little playboy.
894;Cameron Diaz probably does her best acting in this film, and it's a shame it has to be attached to such a piece of garbage.
895;please, please, please, please don't watch this.
896;See the matrix before u see this movie.
897;After viewing the film, I have to say that the film is somewhere in between.
898;It is a great film, but it does have a serious amount of flaws.
899;what is good about Vanilla Sky is that it is a brilliant
900;Cameron Crowe has proved himself to be a director of great visual style.
901;Tom Cruise is genuinely convincing and creepy as a man gone over the edge, and Penelope Cruz is diverting as the woman of his dreams.
902;Indeed, her performance is a big reason to see the film.
903;The romance between Cruise and Cruz is involving and their chemistry convincing.
904;Vanilla Sky is a good film, but it is not a great one.
905;I do recommend it, though.
906;It sheds light on the type of weird person Tom Cruize is.
907;I was surprised Tom Criuse even took the role.
908;While it got me confused I finally understood the movie at the end!
909;Love Tom Cruise movies they are the best!
910;The film might seem confusing the first time you see it, but if you understand it and you connect to it, you'll be enticed by its complexity, variations of emotions, and the characters' conflicts.
911;This has been my favorite movie since 2001, and it probably always will be.
912;The gist of the review was
913;I saw it once, enjoyed it thoroughly and left the theater thinking
914;I also knew it wanted to see it again, if for no other reason that to get a second look at the Times Square Scene, which I originally had believed was computerized.
915;goers, friends who saw it later, then after release to video, friends who bought the film.
916;this is when the film became even more fun than before.
917;On viewing, the visuals were lush, the music rocked, the cast was beautiful, the morality tale of the danger of depending on your wealth and your looks, were all great assets.
918;But the discussions with friends and the reading of reviews
919;I liked figuring it out.
920;The two featurettes were enjoyable as well.
921;This one is really strange, and holds you to the very end.
922;If you like a movie that you have no idea where it's going, you will enjoy this.
923;organizing my toolbox, while she watched this movie.
924;fans than fans of Tom Cruise.
925;To understand and enjoy this movie, you must participate, you must think.
926;vanilla Sky is beautifully filmed, and includes remarkable performances from Cruise and Cruz.
927;He delivers an emotional performance that is pact with charisma and depth.
928;Personally, I believe this movie's greatest flaw was the casting of Cameron Diaz as Julie Gianni.
929;In both versions of the story our protagonists clearly have access to the finest physicians available, and they can afford the ultimate solution depicted in this film.
930;Also, the David Aames position in society adds another dimension to this film.
931;This movie is a excellent movie, and if i had to say probably my favorite of all tom cruise's movies.
932;(I also really enjoyed eyes wide shut).
933;As many people love it as hate it.
934;But I think it's amazing.
935;It's a great love story that seems to defy genre classification.
936;A really suprising and refreshing movie with a deep message behind it.
937;For a start, the initially intriguing premise transforms the concept of suspense into one of confusion and has enough holes in it to be one of Charo's dresses.
938;the car chase thing, the twist ending which since the Sixth Sense now seems mandatory, the Fatal Attraction love interest thing, the state of the art special effects, the pulse pounding music.
939;Crowe did an excellent job of giving us his interpretation and not just a duplicate.
940;He incorporates his own themes of pop culture's influence on everyday life and twists a few other plot elements.
941;I prefer the original Open Your Eyes but Vanilla Sky is still a good movie.
942;The ending was worth the wait.
943;I gave this movie four stars because of it's strong start and excellent ending, and for seeing the handsome Tom Cruise disfigured.
944;Vanilla Sky is truly unique in its own ways of capturing one's imagination.
945;In all of my critiques of films, I have found this movie to truly be the hardest.
946;Although the film was confusing, its plot was very thought through and one can tell that it took many intellectuals to bring forth such a complex storyline.
947;One's realization at the conclusion of the film was intriguing, but in a way contradicting.
948;The casting and soundtrack were all top notch, but this movie is definitely one would have to watch a few more times to incorporate it's plethora of twists.
949;The plot's goal was top.
950;Intriguing plot that was meticulously thought through with pristine intellect.
951;movie I have EVER seen!
952;How could people describe this as a good movie?
953;Apparenly, to completely understand the film, one should watch it a second time.
954;Perhaps I'll give it a chance.
955;When you finish it and realize I was right, all I'll be able to say is I told you so!
956;great story, wonderful screemplay, suspense, romance, everything.
957;i thought it was wonderful.
958;tom cruise was absolutely astounding.
959;one of his best performances yet.
960;this film had the best ending that i've ever seen in a movie.
961;i give it a well deserved 5 stars.
962;I would watch it again and probably recommend it to Tom Cruise fans.
963;Vanilla Sky is Cameron's Crowe most adventurous film to date.
964;vanilla Sky at its most basic level is a modern love story that seeks to explain the choices and repercussions that an individual makes.
965;Tom Cruise's character David Aames is a person that has it all, good looks, wealth, success and the women.
966;blowing experience where he finally finds out the truth about his life and himself after numerous twists and turns.
967;This film questions many of the things that human beings stand for, our sense of reality, our perceptions of love, hate, relationships, friendships.
968;vanilla Sky defintely warrants more than just one screening, it is filled with numerous clues and cleverly framed scenes.
969;One should watch the movie very carefully and pick out the little tidbits and giveaways.
970;There is an excellent commentary from Crowe and his wife Nancy Wilson where they talk about the movie and its subtle nuances.
971;Perhaps Crowe sums it up best in his comments that Vanilla Sky is a movie that extends an invitation.
972;One has to peel away the layers and put our fixed perceptions and mindsets aside to fully embrace what it has to offer.
973;for those seeking a context that places the movie in perspective before viewing it, the feature prelude to a dream serves as a suitable introduction to the movie.
974;Crowe introduces the movie and explains some of his ideas, telling you how to approach the movie and what he essentially set out to do.
975;The title of this review may be deceiving, but for those who saw something more in The Matrix than just tons of fighting and special effects, you'll really enjoy this movie.
976;i generally don't like movies that are more art than entertainment, but this one was a nice surprise.
977;Because of the same super.
978;if you DID enjoy this movie, I'd also recommend the three listed above as well as Memento.
979;I won't go into plot details, but the strength of this film is in it's construction.
980;era America, you will appreciate this fact.
981;It keeps you guessing and it does ask some fairly weighty questions about life, consequences, ego, success and love .
982;Cameron Diaz is intolerably beautiful and cannot hit the note required.
983;This movie was really good.
984;Overall it was really awesome movie to watch and if you pay close attention to it you should be fine.
985;Much more engaging and better production value.
986;That keeps you from getting truly interested in the movie's plot.
987;As soon as you think you have things figured out and you become interested, you realize it's yet another dream.
988;It's an art film and I did not like it.
989;Like A and I another excellent film, it is just two much of a downer.
990;Smart and unpredictable movie that put you in a seat to see tom cruise spiral down.
991;Recommended for those that enjoy his other movies or and thriller in general
992;It was hard to keep up with the story line.
993;I'll be honest the movie starts of well, and right after the suicidal car crash, the movie literally crashes.
994;What could have been a great film actually declines rapidly trying to be some sort of Nuevo avant.
995;The best performance in the film is surprisingly delivered by Cameron Diaz, who seems to be the only one who can play a character with any credible substance.
996;The camera work is in a class of its own.
997;I never saw the original Abre Los Ojos , but I am extremely curious after having viewed this interpretation of the story.
998;This movie makes you think and challenges the viewer to find the meaning for his/herself.
999;so pick Vanilla Sky up and enjoy it for what it is or don't.
1000;the biggest and most damning flaw of this movie is Penelope Cruz as David's love.
1001;if you are the exstential type who tens to mull over whether you are a butterfly or a man you will love this movie.
1002;What follows after the auto accident is a fascinating yet frightening film.
1003;It has some very interesting turns to it.
1004;Tom Cruise, while not giving his best performance, he does do a very good job with the role.
1005;I do agree with some of the other reviewers in that this one will take a couple viewings to fully grasp.
1006;This movie is along the lines of the matrix and other such movies that carry the metaphor of questioning reality.
1007;It is almost an exact translation from Open your eyes, the movie that it was based on but it has several americanized things and some wonderful lines, such as every moment is a chance to make things better(probobly not exactly right but one of my favorite lines from the movie that really helps to explain the metaphor of movies like this)and some of the witty banter between tom and jason lee.
1008;It is a great movie that most people that I have met that do not like it just can not seem understand it.
1009;It also has a lot of great music in it from radiohead and good performances all around.
1010;I honestly don't know what Cameron was thinking when she agreed to do this movie.
1011;That's my story and i'm sticking to it!
1012;This movie is seriously messed up.
1013;Tom Cruise's character just needs a very good therapist.
1014;One of my favorite movies of all time.
1015;but it is worth the wait.
1016;Like an M. Night Shyamalan movie, the true value is in the twist at the end where all the things that you noticed all along fit together to make sense.
1017;Life is an illusion, a dream is more fitting.
1018;i can see where they come from.
1019;Replacing my vhs copy of this wonderful movie.
1020;Cruise and Cameron Diaz are great .
1021;and Kurt Russel helps to make it all come together.
1022;The story is confusing and unusual but well worth owning this one.
1023;Love the twist and turns.
1024;dreams, love, hope, and getting himself confused some more.
1025;the opening really caught my attention
1026;it was really utterly cool.
1027;throughout the movie I must really commend Cameron Crowe's spectacular use of music.
1028;It does take excellent soundtrack to make an already great film a superlative piece of work.
1029;*/potential spoilers*The soundtrack is super.
1030;Totally messed with our heads, pay attention, see if you can figure it out.
1031;we would recommend this movie to our friends.
1032;Vanilla Sky is a visually and intellectually fascinating film that many viewers and critics found too confusing to enjoy.
1033;Helped by some very good performances by Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz, and some stunning visual effects (such as a truly eerie scene of a deserted New York City), Vanilla Sky is an entertaining and intellectually stimulated film.
1034;Vanilla Sky is a great photo album for Tom Cruise and Cruz herself, but it lacked believability.
1035;I kept waiting for something interesting to happen.
1036;Sorry to say, the best part for me was the Paul McCartney title song.
1037;tom Cruise has done much better films with director Cameron Crowe.
1038;(Like Jerry McGuire) He also shines in Risky Business, Top Gun, A Few Good Men and even Legend is much better than this one.
1039;Am not sure I will ever fully appreciate this film's artistic ambitions, but I did find the movie interesting and compelling enough that I will someday re.
1040;Tom Cruise was excellent .
1041;WOW, this is one of the most intriguing mind bending movies I have ever seen.
1042;Absolutely awesome and that is all I have to say!
1043;It pales in comparation to the original , But what more can you expect a Hollywood production?This is one of the best edited films I've ever seen.
1044;but this editing is amazing.
1045;i would have given 4 stars to this great film.
1046;the original movie has a great violent scene at the end of the movie.
1047;origionial but yet for some reason everyone glorifies his work as if he's some kind of creative genious.
1048;Beside from this point that I can't seem to let go of his films as well as the remake of open your eyes are extremely well crafted, they don't beat out Kubrick from a long shot, but they're very well done in their direction and editing.
1049;They're worth seeing just for Penelope Cruz, gosh darn are you one hot woman.
1050;law was in an accident and hopfeully, he's alright but the whole movie just played itself right in front of my mind.
1051;I have to admit that the ending scene moved me.
1052;thanks for your excellent performance.
1053;This is a very interesting movie starring Tom Cruise.
1054;hearted movie full of twists.
1055;Vanilla Sky was not a mediocre movie, the acting was very good, the effects were fine, but I felt left out of the plot.
1056;this could have been a good movie.
1057;This has to be one of the best films Tom ever stared in!
1058;This movie is based on this rich guy that has everything.
1059;Top ten personal movie of all.
1060;Every second is another moment to turn things all around
1061;Now I do have one positive note on this film.
1062;i actually liked Cameron Diaz in her role.
1063;She gave a brilliant performance and I think this girl is being typecast as the funny girl.
1064;As time went by, Tom's head got bigger and bigger and bigger and I think I threw up the contents of that head.
1065;Someone said they couldn't turn it off and this is true.
1066;A friend told me this is the kind of movie you need to watch several times to get the meaning .
1067;I generally like unusual movies like this one .
1068;The main character played by Tom Cruise is a selfish magazine owner born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
1069;A stellar performance by Cameron Diaz as a woman used by the main character for sex, takes the ultimate revenge and scars him for life.
1070;I know that this movie generally has received good reviews so I decided to give it another chance on Amazon Streaming, I thought maybe there was some profound message in it in a second viewing.
1071;This was one of the few movies that I had to just stop watching after 30 minutes because I found it totally unintelligible despite the excellent cast.
1072;We see the relationship with Cruz, Diaz, and the best friend but the best friend so easily gives up on Penelope Cruz that it's hardly even a love triangle.
1073;Unique storykept you on the edge of your seat.
1074;I must say however, this is without question one of the most creative movies these eyes have ever seen.
1075;Don't let any of the bad reviews keep you from at least seeing this masterpiece.
1076;I bought this the day after I saw it because quite simply, it's one of the most creative, and imaginative movies I've ever seen.
1077;Tom Cruise bought the rights to remake the movie and brought on board his friend, esteemed director Cameron Crowe, who did Jerry McGuire with him.
1078;His girlfriend, Julie [Cameron Diaz], is gorgeous and devoted.
1079;His best friend, Brian [Jason Lee] is secretly filled with jealousy.
1080;By the end of the movie, will the average viewer even care?Personally, I liked Vanilla Sky a great deal.
1081;I think it is one of the most underrated movies of 2001.
1082;name talent and large budget generally associated with mainstream entertainment.
1083;He's a great star but not a great actor, in my opinion, because, whatever he is in, he is always Tom Cruise, the star .
1084;bigger than life, sure of himself, and always overplaying his part.
1085;That works well in vehicles properly tailored for him, like Mission Impossible or Jerry McGuire.
1086;cameron Crowe again demonstrates his fine directorial talents.
1087;for people who like a little intellectual challenge in their movies or who love a puzzle, this is a good choice.
1088;First it's a conventional story which turns into a mystery that becomes a thriller that's really a sci.
1089;Find something else to watch or read a good book.
1090;All of the actors did a fine job, but what a trainwreck of a script.
1091;Vanilla Sky is a film you will either love or hate and there are good reasons to do either.
1092;Personally, I enjoyed it and thought that Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, and Cameron Diaz were great in their roles.
1093;The story and subject are definitely interesting and the film is experimental in many ways.
1094;I enjoyed it and would watch it again.
1095;I enjoyed the first hour of this movie at the theater.
1096;The director literally destroyed a potentially good movie.
1097;The director's option of turning the last part of the movie into science fiction completely blew it!!!!!
1098;Yes it is a bit confusingthe first time but cinema should take you away and surprise you.
1099;Great use of music and it is an amazing experience in a Home Theater with 5.1 surround sound.
1100;A love story with a Twilight Zone feeling.
1101;tom Cruise gives the best performance of his career (the scene in which he phones Sofia (Penelope Cruz) and leaves the our old friend 'Benny the Dog' message on her machine, is perhaps Cruise's finest piece of acting to date.
1102;the monolouge given by Cruise's Life Extention Tech Support representative (brilliantly played by Noah Taylor) in which Taylor explains how Cruise's dream life was fashioned by the pop culture icons of his youth, is moviemaking at its finest.
1103;i've avoiding discussing actual details of the plot since Vanilla Sky is a movie that has to be seen and digested to be fully appreciated.
1104;cameron Crowe directs from his own screenplay (based on the Spanish film Abre Los Ojos) and does a masterful job.
1105;to acccess it: go to the still photos section.
1106;I saw Abre Los Ojos before I saw Vanilla Sky and really liked it.
1107;Even Penelope Cruz's performance went down significantly in this version, she seems very concerned about sounding cute speaking English with an accent as opposed to acting well.
1108;Nothing special about the film except good acting from Tom Cruise.
1109;I was surprised I liked this movie actually.
1110;the great thing about this movie?
1111;I can't say too much, otherwise I'll give the entire film away.
1112;This is about taking friendships for granted, relationships etc.
1113;he was terrific as Tom's best friend in the movie.
1114;It's a lot more of a serious role for him, and a step away from his comedy roles in many of the Kevin Smith movies etc.You can pretty much guess the movie's told almost entirely in a series of flashbacks.
1115;On the positive side, though, there is also a powerful message in morality about the true depth and meaning of a sexual relationship.
1116;it's quite an entertaining movie, and whereas some people simply don't like it, it's always the case that I'll end up liking it.
1117;In the age of movie making when everything is based around thrill seeking, instant gratification, and the latest advances in computer graphics Vanilla Sky offers a nice escape.
1118;The twisting and turning throughout the movie, causes you to constantly question the meaning and direction of the story and in turn the meaning and direction of the charcter's.
1119;Its a movie (if you get it .
1120;I agree with most of the reviews here, it was an excellent and highly underrated movie.
1121;The people who enjoy this movie are those with open minds.
1122;Beautifully made and acted and surely only maligned because it was a remake of a recent foreign film.
1123;I have always liked this film.
1124;Conceptually mind blowing for its day.
1125;Its a great ride with very cool ending.
1126;Vanilla Sky is an interesting remake of Abre los ojos.
1127;Penelope cruz did her role better in the original.
1128;Some reviewers made an excellent point recently about the John Travolta film Basic: they said it had SO many twists and turns that it lost its steam.
1129;I expect this kind of film from someone like David Fincher or Christopher Nolan, but I prefer Crowe when he's writing and directing deep, humanist pictures about love and coming.
1130;Mr. Cruise is average, flashing his winning smile just enough for us to believe he can emcompass what it's like to be a rich, good.
1131;Finally, Jason Lee plays Brian, the underappreciated and underrated best friend of David.
1132;Vanilla Sky is a great movie with lots of potential to big a big seller.
1133;It is very difficult to write this review without giving spoilers but I really enjoyed this movie.
1134;He also seems to have a lot of vivid dreams.
1135;he also, tells about his relationships with Camaron Diaz and Penelope Cruz.
1136;The rest of the time you don't know what is real, what is a dream, or maybe in Cruz's mind.
1137;diaz and Cruz are both gorgeous and the movie held me from start to finish!
1138;what can I say, anyway its nicely done by Crowe.
1139;I was very anxious to see this movie.
1140;I like those kinds of movies.
1141;I like a movie to keep my interest and keep me guessing until the very end.
1142;Vanilla Sky is a powerful, stunning, beautiful, and clever film.
1143;a quick recap of the story
1144;This is the story of a man who has it all
1145;One night at a party he meets what he thinks is his true love.
1146;Tom Cruise did a really good job.
1147;Possibly one of his best roles.
1148;The script was very well written and thought out.
1149;The movie was brilliantly directed as well.
1150;the best thing I liked about this movie was it kept my interest the entire time.
1151;It keeps you thinking and guessing until the very end, very much like Memento.
1152;So I will refrain from doing so.
1153;After you see this, see if you can guess the movie.
1154;This is one I'm sure I will watch over and over again.
1155;If you want a clever movie with a great story and plot, this is your movie.
1156;I first viewed Vanilla Sky in the theatre.
1157;Cameron Crow is one of my favorite directors and I really was expecting this movie to be great.
1158;On the good side, it looks beautiful and the soundtrack is wonderful.
1159;I liked the idea of a man experiencing an evening of bliss, destroying his life because he is unwilling to leave that one moment behind him and move on.
1160;Individual parts of this movie are wonderful.
1161;It is a movie worth watching at least twice, and it's an important step for Cameron Crow as a writer/director, but it has several flaws and the ending ties up too smoothly (a trait of every Crow film, which he has proved doesn't always have to be bad).
1162;Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz both stand out playing their respective, 'good gal/bad gal roles and Jason Lee is quite appealing as the best friend of our dashing lead Tom Cruise.
1163;Many good things like the witty Cameron Crowe retrospective soundtrack that is weaved into clever culture references and tributes which are indeed enjoyable and even necessary to solve the riddle presented in 'what's is going on?'
1164;But still the ride can be entertaining as Tom runs away and into trouble as he often does in quasi.
1165;Excellent acting and an amzing story.
1166;I cant believe this wasnt the best film of its year and instead of that waste of time A Beautiful Mind .
1167;Very intellectually stimulating movie that somehow hits home emotionally as well.
1168;Bravo to the stars of this movie, they all hit homeruns.
1169;Vanilla Sky is my favourite ever movie, just pipping Jacob's Ladder to the top spot.
1170;Leftfield' was awesome and directed by a great up.
1171;Vanilla Sky was a great movie that when I first watched it it got 3 out of 5 stars.
1172;The entire movie was a dream as some think this life we live is a dream.
1173;It also teaches that looks do matter.
1174;I think this movie made fun of the audience in the sense that we glorify Hollywood and only love Hollywood actors for what they are.
1175;Vanilla Sky is a rare film.
1176;a work of art that can be taken more than one way.
1177;The film is filled with imagery , Is it a dream?
1178;it is a film that deserves a second viewing because it may be difficult to take it all in.
1179;and those who post here are saying things like, EVEN Kurt Russell shines in this movie.
1180;It has a number of dazzling set pieces, and it's certainly worth seeing, but it doesn't hold together in the end.
1181;in a very quiet performance, yet.
1182;is a great tribute to a much underrated actor.
1183;Though I have to admit, Mr. Crowe is very darn creative, and has a vivid imagination.
1184;At the end it'll make you say, Oh.
1185;The Sixith Sense is a prefect example of a very good bizzare movie.
1186;Vanilla Sky hits you with so many things.
1187;Because of the grand, aspirations of this movie, it must be truly one of the most egregious film failures in the last five years or so.
1188;Perhaps as a younger woman, I would have found it more entertaining .
1189;I do believe Amenabar is a great director and he did great with The others, which is part of my blu.
1190;He deserved what she did to him.
1191;On the other hand, I do own Knight and Day in blu.
1192;The music reflects the ambiguities and mystery.
1193;Penelope Cruz give great performances in both of these films.
1194;That said, this movie is still good.
1195;One of those reality questioning movies that takes a few good twists and turns that will leave you either confused or thinking you have an explanation, but nobody knows for sure.
1196;This is a solid title with good performances from the entire cast, including two of my favorites, Jason Lee and Penelope Cruz.
1197;If you enjoy seeing Tom Cruise get his face smashed in, this is the movie for you.
1198;this movie is so strange and twisting, I had to watch it several times before I really got it.
1199;Tom and Penelope Cruiz (not related) are so easy to watch.
1200;I liked this movie and there was good cars seen's they are good to see what someone would do if like this kind of movie
1201;Visually unexciting with nothing to recommend it what so ever.
1202;after seeing 'Minority Report', I decided to give it another go, and this time really focus.
1203;this is also one of those films that you definitely see best the first time around, so you really have to focus, look and listen to everything.
1204;This is also Tom Cruise' best work.
1205;don't let the trailer fool you, this is far from a simple love story.
1206;Plenty of twists and turns, its hard to catch up.
1207;bought this because it is one of the last movies showing the twin towers.
1208;After the unprecedented success of Almost Famous, director Cameron Crowe assembled a formidable cast.
1209;the cast is close to perfect, with the famed romance between Cruise and Cruz being particularly evident, something that clearly works to Crowe's advantage.
1210;Cruise is clearly comfortable working with Crowe again and resultantly puts in one his best performances to date (but still not beating his turns in Born On The Fourth Of July and Magnolia).
1211;Cruz has a willowy elegance to her that lends itself perfectly to the role and Diaz as always is a pure delight whenever she's on screen.
1212;Russell and Crudup for the most part have thankless roles but do the best they can with them, rounding up a list of impressive performances.
1213;Whilst it's true that the ending will make you see everything in a new perspective, this doesn't mean that you'll have had any more fun watching an ultimately cloying first date between the leads and a lot of flashy effects with David constantly waking from dreams, being told to open his eyes and being asked if he can tell the difference between dreams and reality.
1214;As it stands though this is a movie with a good resolution and great performances.
1215;Before fans of this film savage me, can I just start off by saying that I so much wanted to love this movie.
1216;I am a Cameron Crowe fan, I like Cameron Diaz, loved Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire and looked forward to seeing Penelope Cruz in a decent role.
1217;The preview trailers were excellent, although misleading, and made me optimistically look forward to an excellent romantic thriller with a stellar leading cast
1218;don't you think?As previously mentioned, I am a fan of both actor and Director, particularly Crowe for Almost Famous and Jerry Maguire but I have also enjoyed the ex Mr Kidman in the likes of Rain Man too.
1219;The idea of the star and Director of Jerry Maguire re.
1220;I'm also led to believe that as movie fables go John Frankenheimer's 1966 film, Seconds, in which a clandestine organisation provides youthful bodies for the ageing rich and arranges for them to fulfil their dreams with new lifestyles, is a much more rewarding watch.
1221;When I saw this film in the theatre I went with one other person.
1222;This movie was easily the best film of 2001.
1223;It takes a certain level of intelligence to appreciate a work of art like this.
1224;Vanilla SkyA really nice romp into the world of the mind.
1225;It gives you alot to think about when it's over.
1226;one of Tom Cruise's best performances not to mention Ms'Cruz's beauty.
1227;they are electric on screen together.
1228;At first it's a little confusing but once you finish the movie you will completely understand everything!!
1229;It gradually dawns on the viewer that the story has stepped over the reality boundary and it is incredibly moving.
1230;Tom Cruise plays this sort of role very well and all the supporting cast were terrific.
1231;Nice story twist, never saw the end coming.
1232;Kind of a depressing ending but very entertaining as always watching Tom Cruse.
1233;I loved this film when I saw it at the cinema.
1234;I think Tom Cruise gave an excellent performance, playing the rich toyboy character who has a life altering experience.
1235;The journey he has after the car crash is what the film is all about.
1236;the casting in this film was excellent, Cruz and Diaz both did an excellent job.
1237;If you like films that you need to think about, you will love this film.
1238;The ultimate tease and let down.
1239;The first hour and a half was pretty engaging and interesting and then the film imploded in sci.
1240;Better luck next time Cameron!
1241;Tom Cruise is very good in this.
1242;The story comes together so artificially in the end.
1243;I loved the movie, a psychological thriller with twists, turns, and open ends.
1244;It left me thiking about it days after seeing it, and any movie that has the capability to do that is worthy of seeing at least once.
1245;Great movie with a great soundtrack.
1246;Superb directing and great cinematography.
1247;Tom Cruise has great chemistry with Penelope Cruz.
1248;It does take you on a trippy ride and if you like everything wrapped in a neat bow, than this movie is not for you.
1249;never the less, I enjoyed this movie.
1250;The music was excellent and the way the movie was shot was stunning.
1251;In addition, the movie does give you something to think about (e. g.
1252;Vanilla Sky is clearly a landmark in cinematic entertainment, and if the average movie buff is searching for something fresh, intelligent, and simply moving, this movie is for you.
1253;Thankfully, it provides the audience with an experience that is a mind blowing collage of images, emotions, and mysteries that will keep any intelligent person interested, and at times intense.
1254;(I sat on the edge of my seat this entire film, though that is not to say that this is some sort of fast paced, sensationlized thriller) If you think that you may be speculative going into this, understand that it is intense based on the way it is put together, because if your looking for action sequences, stunts and eye candy, go see XXX.
1255;The fact of the matter is, is that this film simply rocks.
1256;Tom Cruise delivers one of his best performances, and is superbly backed up by energetic and believable roles played by Penelope Cruz, Kurt Russel, and Cameron Diaz.
1257;of the film is what makes this movie such a masterpiece.
1258;Its smart, beautiful, and moving.
1259;I promise that it will be an experience that will stick, even if you are not satisfied.
1260;Vanilla Sky is a good cerebral flick, but it doesn't live up to the original (Open Your Eyes).
1261;If you can stand subtitles (or speak Spanish), watch the original.
1262;A friend of mine recommended Vanilla Sky to me, saying that it is so mind.
1263;trippy its great, so with that recommendation I honestly didn't know what to expect.
1264;Another friend of mine told me it's reminiscent of The Matrix and Dark City in terms of questioning reality, so I took in Vanilla Sky not knowing what to expect, and I was happily surprised at the results.
1265;conceited, wealthy, handsome, playboy who has the world at his fingertips (he's really playing himself), but one day his world comes crashing down when he is left horribly scarred and disfigured in a car crash involving his suicidal ex.
1266;Eventually, his face is seemingly repaired by a miracle of new age plastic surgery, and he is reunited with his one true love played by Penelope Cruz.
1267;It is truly the best movie I have seen this year, and possibly the best love story ever made to date.
1268;cameron Crowe, who also directed last years Almost Famous, which I also loved, directes Vanilla Sky into a climatic shower of the unknown every minute, while the plot unfolds into a mind bubbling unexpected twist of suspense, love, hate, dreams, sex and jealousy.
1269;tom Cruise is at his best here, and gives every emotion forward to make us inhale the wonderful sensual feelings that his character feels and goes through.
1270;Cruz and Diaz are a delight, and Kurt Russell, who rarely does a film today is wonderful as the part of McCabe the lawyer.
1271;You alsot feel confused, but enjoyed and entertained at the same time, wanting you to go back for more to see it again.
1272;Upon your second viewing of Vanilla Sky, your questions will be answered and you will see the real beauty and love story that Vanilla Sky portrays.
1273;vanilla Sky is a pure treat and refreshment from the human heart.
1274;Great performances, directing and screenplay.
1275;Good acting by all of the cast but is unusual turn of events which I was prepared for.
1276;I was confused at first, but I love how it was put together!
1277;Still thinking about all the twists!
1278;An interesting piece of fiction.
1279;The story line is a real sleeper untilnear the end.
1280;I especially enjoyed the opening credit written and directed for the screen by Cameron Crowe .
1281;Do yourself a HUGE favor and see the original instead.
1282;It is a complicated film.
1283;But, if you pay attention and watch for all the subtle clues and underlying subtext, you will see that it is truly a good film.
1284;The surprise ending, which is borderline impossible to predict, will amaze you .
1285;I think that it is a very deep film.
1286;if you get a chance, you should watch it once and then watch it again with the director's commentary.
1287;they also give away vital background clues that will have you rewinding and replaying quite a few times.
1288;this movie is great because a lot of it is left up to interpretation.
1289;But I think it's great.
1290;she plays an amazing psycho!!
1291;And I think it's one of Tom Cruise's best performances.
1292;Definitley a must see!I recommend this one for anyone who has a mind of their own!
1293;I have seen the original version as well and love them both.
1294;The cast is wonderful and the story is filled with unexpected twists.
1295;This is a fantastic movie although it takes a bit of time to appreciate it.
1296;It's a movie you'll want to watch again and again.
1297;I really dislike Tom Cruise, but love this movie.
1298;The music score is great in the flick too.
1299;Wow, this is an amazing film!
1300;It's really like a journey of self.
1301;I'll tell you in another life, when we are both cats.
1302;What is happiness to you?
1303;Every passing minute is another chance for a new life.
1304;English SubtitleDespite this is the exact remake of the Spanish film Open Your Eyes, I really do think Vanilla Sky is a very great film, a revolution of the mind.
1305;It keeps me thinking of what is happiness to you?
1306;If you discover the real meaning of this movie, you'll know how beautiful this movie is!
1307;Highly recommended if you have an open mind.
1308;I am a huge Tom Cruise fan, but I must be honest.
1309;At any rate Cruise plays David, a handsome and rich womanizer.
1310;i think there is no definitive interpretation of this movie, everybody can have their own, and that is what this movie has of so great!For me,i thought it was so beautiful that i even cried at the endTom Cruise does a great job as Cameron Diaz!Penelope is stunning,but her english.
1311;All Tom Cruise movies are worth watching.
1312;amazing concept, love the visuals.
1313;Vanilla sky had potential, but the viewers hand is held in the end ,like we are retards, and everything is explained in one scene.
1314;My wife and I liked this film.
1315;Really good and creepy performance by Cameron Diaz.
1316;Worth seeing, it really makes you think about the difference between dreams and reality.
1317;This is a great movie.
1318;I saw it when it first came out, in the theater, and have wanted to see it again, ever since.
1319;the themes, the story, the cinematography, the acting .
1320;to dig deep into our own lives and minds, our own fears and perceptions of reality and life kind of like a mirror what we get from the movie reflects ourselves I don't particularly like Tom Cruise or Cameron Diaz, but in this film, their parts are perfect for their abilities.
1321;Good movie lil strange but still good and entertaining you never know what's going on till the end good story butch of known actors all the good stuff for a nice and long movie
1322;i found the story clever and intriguing.
1323;pieces were amazing and really stuck in my head, especially Tom Cruise racing manically through a deserted Times Square.
1324;I enjoyed the reveal at the end which pointed out the visual clues to the solution that I missed earlier in the story.
1325;another bonus is the eclectic but amazing soundtrack.
1326;i loved the scene where Tom and Penelope spend their first night together.
1327;It is perfectly innocent but there is real chemistry between them.
1328;I think this movie is brilliant .
1329;in a sense that it works very well confusing the viewer on which part is reality and which is a dream.
1330;Vanilla Sky toys with your mind, it does with shades of grey and you can interpret it many ways.
1331;In this sense, Vanilla Sky is that good.
1332;the cast put up generally robust performances.
1333;the reality of David's situation is revealed towards the end.
1334;Even then, there is a playful yet disconcerting thought going through your mind .
1335;So if you are up for mind games, pick up this one.
1336;Just when you thought Tom Cruise was just a show boat, he comes up with this.
1337;I thought about it all day at my office.
1338;but even with valid criticisms of the plot, the movie is still a wonderful film that may just take you on an emotional journey and it is visually stunning at times.
1339;And even watching it earlier this evening for the first time in years I was surprised that the hairs on my arms stood up during the your not Sofia scene.
1340;10 years later, things change, you change, and your view of the film changes.
1341;however, there are still some good revelations and insights at the films conclusion.
1342;And this is a valuable lesson for anyone to heed about how choices impact your life.
1343;I wonder how he views it in his career present day.
1344;despite some reservations about the film this is a movie I recommend to friends who haven't seen it without hesitation.
1345;But this film has the capacity to be truly special for some people depending upon where they are at in their life at the moment.
1346;It clears up a lot of things that many people might find confusing about the film and offers some nice insights.
1347;It's as good as watching the film!FINAL GRADE: A.
1348;One day I will probably TRY and give this one another run.
1349;I really do want to see how it all comes together.
1350;It is beautiful and moving, and it is also a classic case for Tom Cruise's character of what goes around, comes around.
1351;I think it was very artfully done, and the scenery and art direction was gorgeous.
1352;One of my favorite flicks.
1353;This is strictly for those people who want to be challenged by the movies that they see, and perhaps for lovers of so. called European Art Movies.
1354;This is one of those movies most people will either love or hate.
1355;But i have always loved the work of Cameron Crow, and i have a great fondness for off.
1356;but i guess in my own twisted way, i loved that about this film.
1357;it does make you think, and question what exactly it is you're seeing on the screen.
1358;i have to say that one of the main reasons this movie worked so well for me, was their performances.
1359;They both rendered these characters beautifully, and their on.
1360;screen chemistry comes across so well, that it makes the resulting storyline all the more tragic.
1361;and one of the main reasons i love the man's work so much.
1362;is his ability to inject humor into otherwise serious situations, which he does here wonderfully.
1363;Her performance is so incredibly over.
1364;on the plus side, we find a movie that engages the viewer and the mind.
1365;A movie that is certainly confusing at first sitting, it is that rare commodity: the movie we like to talk about later.
1366;I also had a strong reaction to this movie, and I respect that others loved the very things I hated.
1367;i feel that Vanilla Sky could have been one of the greatest movies ever made.
1368;is the love of his life and that she in turn shares similar feelings about him.
1369;Was she simply in love with David's beauty?
1370;choosing between one's real life before death and the uncertainty of a new life in a new world without family, friends, money, profession, or relevant education and experience needed to cope with a world 150 years in the future.
1371;But to anyone who sees the attempted storyline, the makers of this movie missed a huge opportunity to create something deeply philosophical and troubling and complex and beautiful.
1372;I also love any movie that after is finished you NEED to see it again because so many details come untangled at the end that you need to re.
1373;see some scenes to fully understand what's going on!
1374;This movie is a wild ride the first time you see it, and a thrill each subsequent time you see it, as you will catch many details that you missed because you were so confused the first time!
1375;i think this film is a landmark for what hollywood can do to what should in all terms be a landmark film.
1376;leave it to hollywood to take a fantastic story, throw an enormous budget at it and still manage to screw things up.
1377;visually stunning, yes
1378;first and most aggregious in my mind is bound to cameron crowe's obsession with popular music.
1379;if not, it certainly works as a nice allegory.
1380;still, though, i do feel it's worth watching.
1381;gorgeous visually, even a good film.
1382;and, yeah, Tom Cruise is in it.
1383;If you look to far into any movie you will be able to tear it apart, piece by piece.
1384;This is plain and simply a wonderful movie.
1385;Fight Club You will enjoy this film.
1386;After watching this movie your eyes will be open to more then just the bigger picture.
1387;This movie is for people who love movies with a passion.
1388;All I can say to the producers is.
1389;'Vanilla Sky' is one of my favorite movies of all time, for that reason I have discussed it with a number of people.
1390;and it is for that reason, I gather, that many people prefer the original film and strongly denounce 'Vanilla Sky.'
1391;Crowe made a great story and message digestible for American's, but in the process brought forth such a jarring and real message about so many aspects of life that I think people either don't want to or can't wrap their heads around it.
1392;It is a cultural re.
1393;doing of a solid film
1394;I love this movie because it is a truthful depiction of a man who torments himself.
1395;aware you must eventually chose to either: wake up (open your eyes) take control of your destiny and live a real life
1396;It keeps you on the edge of your seat most of the time, always wondering what is actually going on.
1397;Not only it is a satisfying experience for the viewer, but also it is attractive and well built(the plot).
1398;What makes this movie so enjoyable is that it confuses you, so you are not always sure that what you think is happening is what it really is indeed.
1399;But anyway,its definitely worth seeing.
1400;I actually ordered this film on a wim, I had heard a little something from my friend Zach.
1401;Listening to David (Tom) and the changing of his character throughout the story, almost makes watching it worth wild.
1402;, before I continue, a basic outline of the film.
1403;david Aames (Tom Cruise) is wealthy, has a wonderful Girlfriend, and almost anything he wants.
1404;She explains to him she loved him, and that she is not just a sex plaything.
1405;in the end, things are summed up fairly well.
1406;And the whole story is rather fascinating and deserves a second or third watching to fully understand.
1407;And appreciate everything it has to offer, with that I leave you with this.
1408;I will see you again, in another life.
1409;it is a surreal story but I prefer the original
1410;The end of the movie puts the first 90.95% of the film in perspective, and it does it with aching beauty and aggressive poignancy.
1411;Penelope Cruz was perfect for the role of Sofia.
1412;She was gentle, slightly naive, sweet, loving, and soulful.
1413;Kurt Russell played the role of psychologist McCabe with convincing thespian maturity.
1414;The role seemed completely natural to him, and it was a pleasure to see a veteran actor giving a perfectly tuned performance.
1415;This movie was very well written.
1416;It will leave you guessing.
1417;How this can be considered a masterpiece is beyond me.
1418;i think the concept for the movie is excellent.
1419;i jus cant get into the actual performances that the actors give us.
1420;jointed' and that kept me from gettin emotionally attached to any of the characters displayed here.
1421;This film seems to be a vehicle to explain in movie form the attainment of being a Clear, that is, one who has learned how to keep the analytical mind in control over the reactive mind.
1422;He allows his reactive mind to continue to replay all the scenes, or engrams in Scientology parlance, restimulating him into a neurotic state, until at the very end of the film he realizes he has to make a choice.
1423;His life was immoral,frozen, now it is based on new information.
1424;He is free, and Clear.
1425;It's my favorite movie but the original feeling I got from watching it can only happen once.
1426;I've seen the original version also but I prefer this one.
1427;Firstly, make sure that you see the WHOLE film.
1428;the ending will make you think hard about happiness and should make you feel good about hoping for the future.
1429;Just like EYES WIDE SHUT, he takes the whole production on his shoulders and makes it shine.
1430;i'm not going to summarize the story line., but i will tell you that the acting is superb, the music is fantastic, the cinemetography is outstanding, and the story line is very origonal (besides the fact that this is a remake of a spanish film called Open Your Eyes).
1431;i would highly recommend this film.
1432;Trippy kind of movie though very interesting!
1433;You gotta watch it too!
1434;Vanilla Sky is a very intriguing movie that will set you wondering about the actual meaning of happiness.
1435;As for Tom Cruise, I dare say he plays one of his most challenging roles, and he carries that out perfectly.
1436;It turned out to be a well made movie, with some good performances, and decently thought.
1437;I thought Cruise, while being his usual androidal self that does a good job at least of pretending to be human, did a capable job and the rest of cast are even better.
1438;Pen lope Cruz does the best job though, lighting up a relationship triangle with her humor and naturalness.
1439;extremely complex film, very cameron crowe with the wonderful music selections and infinite details you would never pick up on until the fifth or sixth or twentieth viewingi may be biased bc i enjoy penelope cruz very much.
1440;Cameron Crowe was known for sweet natured films, so seeing Vanilla Sky was a refreshing escape from his norm.
1441;Strange and compelling, it's about a guy who's privileged and set in his ways.
1442;The catharsis at the end was worth the wait.
1443;She was charming and totally in touch with the material.
1444;It's definitely worth a look.
1445;I got a certain satisfaction at the prospect of Tom's pretty little face being severely disfigured, thereby losing the girl, and I caved.
1446;I'm sure Nicole Kidman agrees.
1447;penelope Cruz as the girl of his (lucid) dreams is otherworldly lovely and vague.
1448;Cameron Diaz is a quietly brilliant actress who deserves larger rolls in dramas that what she's allotted.
1449;She can be more than a bubbly blonde.
1450;See it for the cinematography, the strange roles, and the controversial ending.
1451;I wish to see this movie several times more and will hopefully enjoy it more when I understand every second of it.
1452;minute hype piece about how great the movie is and about how wonderful the cast and crew are.
1453;intellectuals who believe there's some profound meaning to this movie
1454;found love between her and Cruise's character in the movie is supposed to represent some type of ideal love.
1455;Yes, after seeing this movie, I felt ashamed to be a part of the human race.
1456;Tom's acting was a little better in this film but seriously folks the most he really has going for him is that he is an exceptional good lookin man.
1457;He keeps getting more and more handsome as he ages.
1458;Now here is the but,,,,,I really think he has the potential to be a really good actor but the roles he has been taking just don't do anything for him anymore.
1459;now his co. star,,,,what was her name?
1460;Oh, that's right, Broadway is for real actors.
1461;a real grabber, makes you think hard about future.
1462;Was it ready for the end the real surprise definitely 4 stars
1463;he is young and is enjoying life and has surrounded himself with quite the coterie of friends and hanger.
1464;the final straw comes when Sofia and David are in the midst of a passionate love making session and Sofia turns into Julianna.
1465;the plot is certainly an intricate one and I am afraid I cannot do justice to all the nuances built into the story
1466;tom Cruise I must say turns in a marvelous performance as the rich playboy turned into a self loathing and tormented man after the crash that disfigures him.
1467;top performances are turned in by all and I must single out Kurt Russell as the psychologist who is a solid addition to the proceedings.
1468;technically speaking this movie has been transferred well into widescreen and the colours are sharp and crisp.
1469;all in all this is a 135 minute gem,while not everyone's cup of tea,is certainly(to me)an intriguing and engrossing psychological film that keeps you guessing right down to the last few minutes.
1470;This film has engendered a great deal of hostile reaction, and I think that about 90% of that is a result of frustrated expectations.
1471;although this is not a perfect film, it nonetheless is a stimulating, thought provoking fantasy.
1472;I loved the way that it continually challenged my sense of reality, and surprised my sensibilities.
1473;I loved the look of the film, and I find that many days after having seen it I have a host of extremely vivid images that I continually recall.
1474;so, I strongly recommend this film.
1475;I also recommend looking into the original version of this film.
1476;I agree with those who find it to be the stronger film.
1477;But I thought Vanilla Sky was one of the most original movies I have seen in a long time and I had fun watching it.
1478;This is the kind of movie I enjoy liking because I know everyone doesn't.
1479;It will be fun meeting other people that liked it too.
1480;It's a mixture of romance and science fiction that won't appeal to everyone, but if it works for you it will work very well.
1481;It's definitely a movie I'll watch more than once.
1482;While this film received a great deal of criticism, I greatly enjoyed it.
1483;While it is a remake, I have yet to watch the original, but I like the move on numerous levels.
1484;This is a film I can watch over and over again.
1485;This is an intense thriller that twists the mind and commands you to follow.
1486;The story does not allow you to lead it, you must surrender to it's pace and in doing so you are rewarded with real understanding.
1487;this film offers real insight into life, power and interpersonal relationship.
1488;While it decidedly uses science fiction to deliver the final message the conflict is well grounded.
1489;You must pay close attention to this film to appreciate the details and fully understand it's implications, but it is well worth it.
1490;well well wellwhat have we here.
1491;finally a great movie in the 2000's, NO WAY!I feel that Cameron Crowe is a great director who now has put some good flicks, but none as crazy as Vanilla Sky.
1492;I give Vanilla Sky 2 very enthuastic thumbs up for originality and also for such great acting from Tom Cruise.
1493;i had a good time being taken by this movie.
1494;And I understand Cameron Crowe liking pop culture so much as to mix it into his movies.
1495;Good fast action packed movie.
1496;Tom Cruice played a very good part in the movie .
1497;I liked this movie a lot!
1498;But the ending is brilliant!!!
1499;Once you understand the significance of Benny the dog and take a trip to L. e. it all fits together perfectly.
1500;This is a masterpiece of mind bending film making!!
1501;The ending provides a choice to Cruise's character, wheter to keep living in a dream or to OPEN YOUR EYES an face an uncertin future.
1502;This is a choice we all have to make.
1503;I really like Tom's acting in this film and Penelope Cruz is delicious as always.
1504;The story is a testament to the unforgiving corporate world.
1505;One of those movies that made you think, just when you thought it was a simple movie you were suddenly thinking what?
1506;but seldom do remakes surpass the original.
1507;It followed the original fairly well,it had a great cast and Cameron crowe is responsible for some of my favorite movies .
1508;the full impact all over again.
1509;i chalk it up to passion, the original writer/director ALEJANDRO AMENABAR ( who also made THE OTHERS with nicole kidman) was passionate about his work and knew exactly what he wanted to convey.
1510;I give them an A for effort but believe that alejandro's original is still the PAR for this effort.
1511;I thought it a good movie
1512;Consider it a part mystery, part psycho.
1513;This movie has all the makings of a instant classic.
1514;Literally you can look at all the angles.
1515;there is real humanism to the film.
1516;And a great perk to this movie is the MUSIC.
1517;I have liked most of his movies.
1518;The navigation, transitions and background sounds were well thought out and make the disc an overall dream to explore.
1519;I personally enjoyed the Prelude to a Dream documentary.
1520;movie and it just pulled everything together.
1521;I think it's the background music and sounds that pulls me back to the root menu.
1522;tHE MOVIE:First saw this at the theatre with two friends.
1523;and that's why I love it.
1524;It'll twist you around and leave you wondering if you're still in dream land.
1525;I was absolutely in love with this movie for the first 3 quarters.
1526;colored memory than simply a factual pre.
1527;Abre los ojos was a masterpiece.
1528;Original, fun, with a sad unconventional ending.
1529;If you don't get it at first, watch it again.
1530;The ending is surprising yet predictable.
1531;A great attempt of Cameron Crowe's, but could have been better.
1532;This movie is so good I was glued to my seat watching intently trying to figure it all out before it told me at the very end.
1533;And while I was close to figuring out the actually story, I was slightly off, but that's ok because the actually story line was great.
1534;He's basically a playboy and uses women as he deems fit.
1535;This is what most people hate about this movie, its confusing nature, but I thought it was one of its best features.
1536;for those that enjoy a movie that will make you think, that gives great acting and a super cool story then check this out.
1537;I loved it and think that it has definately entered my top 20 movies of all time.
1538;I heard that Vanilla Sky was a love it or hate it kind of movie, and I guess that's right.
1539;i was one of the people who loved it.
1540;This movie has many surprises throughout, and in the end, it leaves you wondering what REALLY happened.
1541;I reccomend that everyone see this movie!
1542;Great movie thought All played well little long tho could have some it up but oh well they did a great job
1543;The plot is sophisticated and reconcilable (unlike Mullholland Drive) which is perhaps the main complaint of how everything is explained in the end.
1544;So it's a remake and I haven't seen the original but this movie has a remarkably fitting soundtrack.
1545;This is the true value of this movie.
1546;a fine intellectual premise, get that figured and the the viewing process becomes a test of social and moral values.
1547;the pace of the suspense building is perfectly pitched and the myriad of twist and turns in the plot are interesting and infuriatingly engaging.
1548;diaz is excellent in her menancing and slighty unhinged role, Cruz provides a breath of fresh air in her beautiful and unincumbered character.
1549;The film seems more a medium to prove his worth as an actor (because let's face it, his x. wife has been trumping him repeatedly since he left her) than it is a means to bring this fascinating story to life.
1550;This movie is an incredible masterpiece.
1551;He did have a cool alarm clock though.
1552;I thought the movie was entertaining and that was it.
1553;Mistakes you make will be a learning experience for your next life.
1554;That is exactly what he has done here.
1555;He took his quirky religious views and put it on the big screen.
1556;These are the same people who think any movie is a great movie if it is completely in French and has subtitles.
1557;as far as acting is concerned, Tom does an OK job.
1558;She actually steals the movie.
1559;I think she did a pretty good job.
1560;It's a very complicated filmNice to thinks while you are watching I think it worth to watch this film
1561;I was expecting an average movie with decent acting.
1562;The acting is great especially from Tom Cruise and Jason Lee.
1563;Cameron Diaz makes an impression as well as Penelope Cruz in their roles.
1564;blowing with more plot twists than I have ever seen.
1565;The end is great, and I loved how this made you think.
1566;Vanilla Sky is a tapestry of how interelated people are to each other and how our lives are interrelated to our existence.
1567;tom Cruise has two gorgeous, strong determined women pursuing him or vice versa.
1568;carmen Diaz and Penelope Cruz are gorgeous in appearance and offer substansive value in the film showing demarcation points in Cruise's life.
1569;the art gallery scene must be listened to with determination.
1570;this phrase is a hint to understand/enjoy the movie.
1571;Not his best movie made by far.
1572;An interesting and unsettling Cameroon Crowe creation with a great soundtrack I listen to after so many years.
1573;makes that are actually any good.
1574;it's a stunning piece of film.
1575;But there's some great cinematography at the start of the film.
1576;All you need to do, is Open Your Eyes to see the greatness of the film.
1577;Once you've seen it already, see it again.
1578;The many hidden details that appear are very odd, but also very cool.
1579;Love the open thought process to the movie.
1580;Very well scripted and the music for the movie is on point.
1581;Ms. Cruz is lovely to look at .
1582;at its core, the film is a classic tale of redemption with some sci.
1583;Still, the film manages to connect emotionally on many levels despite the fact that it's hard to identify with the characters.
1584;This is one of my favorite films, and one I've shared with many friends.
1585;the thrill of exploring the unknowns of reality and the way they change us and shape us is incomparably better to living in a contained fantasy.
1586;perfect, i must admit i was pleasantly shocked .
1587;Although the ending seems so sweet and sugary i sensed a certain darkness about his ultimate fate.
1588;Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz are outstanding, particulary Cruz, who steals the show with her spunkyness and beauty.
1589;fi movie, with cryogenically freezing companies that prolong life, a la Austin Powers.
1590;This movie is the best I have seen in this year.
1591;The complex, intriguing storyline, combined with superb acting makes watching the movie a touching experience.
1592;the theme, is about true love as much as about dream and reality, a very relevant topic in the age of abundance of virtual reality.
1593;Although pretty trite the plot is after the charismatic Matrix, it still is a touching one, with the help of the atmosphere, especially the vanilla sky .
1594;the acting is beautifully spontaneous, lively, and exemplary in every respect.
1595;I found the commentary very interesting.
1596;It's hard to make a surprise.
1597;ending movie that satisfies the audience.
1598;But I clearly saw a crowd held back by police barricades in the background.
1599;She convincingly acts like she's crazy.
1600;Thanks to her performance, the scene in the car (which is the best moment in the film) is a shock.
1601;(2) Like every Hollywood film from the last ten years, Vanilla Sky has the right look .
1602;every set is lit and designed in a slick.
1603;The people behind the scenes who gave the movie it's fake naturalism look did a great job.
1604;He wakes up the first time in a dream that reveals his fear of loneliness.
1605;David's life is also quite eccentric
1606;the movie is nice to watch while Crowes' now brilliant script writing doesn't fail you with his charming dialogue, funny moments, and a string of classic rock tunes to the soundtrack, including the new song by Paul McCartney with the same title.
1607;I do recommend listening to him talk about the ending of the movie to help you get your final understanding of the movie in general.
1608;Tom Cruise's celebrity baggage lends itself well to this story, plus it has an amazing supporting cast, a cool story, and a great soundtrack .
1609;I went to this movie expecting the same but was pleasantly surprised.
1610;Crowes main ingredient in this is the always good Tom Cruise.
1611;Add to that the very Jeckyl and Hyde performances of Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz, and you've got a very intense, intelligent, and erotic movie.
1612;The Times Square scene is worth the price alone.
1613;I don't want to go too in depth into the movie because I don't want to give anything away, but it is definetly great movie making.
1614;Included is a great commentary with Crowe, Nancy Wilson, and a special phone appearance by Mr. Cruise.
1615;BUT seeing it again and maybe again is how you realize what a great story and movie this is.
1616;This film is about conscience, and it is one of those rare films that happens to come out of hollywood every great once in a while.
1617;The ephemeral romance between Cruise and Cruz is subdued and simple, and the moments they share together on the screen are tender without being too sentimental.
1618;The imagery is vivid and lucid, much like the dream David is in, and the Vanilla Sky near the film's conclusion is eccentric, yet memorable.
1619;The casting deprives a powerful story of its fundamental strength.
1620;The perceptive viewer will quickly realise that this plot is rich with promise, a covenant emptied of its worth by the inadequacy of its lead actor.
1621;The story, opening with the hackneyed depiction of sex, money and power, soon enters a new realm of fantasy.
1622;The surprise is its mechanism.
1623;Cameron Diaz, whose sensuality is somehow actually enhanced in this film.
1624;Cameron Diaz brings a fresh intensity to her depiction of the rejected suitor.
1625;She's not just a gold.
1626;Penelope Cruz possesses all the grace and dignity you would expect of a ballerina.
1627;She handles every scene with finesse.
1628;The real standout here is Kurt Russell as the psychologist.
1629;the wearing of a latex face mask to conceal his scars.
1630;I loved Vanilla Sky for all of its creativity and guts!
1631;This was the most underrated movie of the year and deserved some award attention.
1632;Tom Cruise gives his best performance EVER!
1633;He was remarkable and I'm not even one of his biggest fans, but he proved himself as an actor with this truly challenging role.
1634;The other Cruz was so perfect and charming and a joy to watch.
1635;I love her, she is so mind.
1636;blowing and in this role proves she's not just the sweetheart funny comedy girl, she's so much more.
1637;She gives a completely frightening performance as the obsessive lover of Cruise's David.
1638;This is one powerful film.
1639;Another one to add to the collect.
1640;Thanks to Cameron Crowe who keeps making my favorite movies!!!
1641;I have seen a number of movies with mind.
1642;This is the type of movie that can really make you think about your own life and what really matters to you.
1643;It's about love, it's about a tiny freckle on your lover.
1644;This movie means a lot to me.
1645;The more times you watch this film the more you will understand it's meaning.
1646;Vanilla Sky blew all of those movies away!
1647;i have never seen a movie more well done.
1648;This film is a thought provoking, intelligent, and all around amazing experience.
1649;Tom Cruise delivers one of his best performances to date as David Aames, an egotistical playboy who inherited a fortune from his father, and takes everything in his life for granted, until his life suddenly takes a turn for the bizarre.
1650;This film is about one man's journey to redemption through a series of dreams, scientific miracles, and the power of love.
1651;i personally believe that this is Cameron Crowe's best, after ALMOST FAMOUS.
1652;Cruise totally dives into this role (he also produced the film, which is based on a foreign film, ABRE LOS OJOS), and the rest of the supporting cast is perfect as well.
1653;Penelope Cruz will take your breath away with her fully realized performance as Sofia, Jason Lee is amazing as a heartbroken novelist, and Cameron Diaz gives what may be her best performance of all time as lonely, psychotic Juliana.
1654;this is a beautiful film.
1655;It is a celebration of life, and how every passing minute is a chance to turn it all around.
1656;I watched this film in theatres years ago, and it made a huge impression on me.
1657;Even the title, Vanilla Sky, has a special meaning of its own to which many of us can relate.
1658;What's most surprising about this film .
1659;other than that Cameron Diaz can be quite convincing in a dramatic role .
1660;I was pleasantly surprised to discover that what I had thought, from the trailers, was just going to be another romantic.
1661;thriller with an A. list cast, was actually a far more complex and compelling sci.
1662;fed format for American audiences.
1663;`Vanilla Sky' is a notable exception, and well worth seeing.
1664;Tom is a excellent actor and his acting range is displayed quite effectively in this movie.
1665;There's always something going on that's relevant to the plot.
1666;A very satisfying film with emotions on various levels.
1667;I agree with the other reviewer completely that the story plays out as the director intended and that what you see actually happens.
1668;Just sit back, concentrate and take it all in (then watch it again!)
1669;complete with flash backs!Great visuals and a great soundtrack.
1670;i imagine most people viewing these reviews have already seen the movie and know what to expect.
1671;see you in another life when we are both cats!
1672;bend the audience, whether it be time.
1673;vanilla Sky succeeds because the story is as captivating as the way it was filmed.
1674;This is a movie that will mind fug you for a while to put it mildly.
1675;You'll watch it and start to ask who are you're real friends and what is it that you really hope to achieve in our brief time in this world.
1676;It is such a cool movie to watch.
1677;Vanilla Sky is one of those movies.
1678;This movie sucks you in and grips you as long as you can follow along with the ever changing timeline.
1679;This is one of those rare flicks that I can keep coming back to and still enjoy it over and over.
1680;This film began really well, with a sinister atmosphere, eye.
1681;popping panoramic cityscapes and compelling story.
1682;scores points, however, for a murder scene that features what if god was one of us.
1683;As the title says, this is my favorite film of all time.
1684;And as Cameron Crowe says in one of the documentaries, I wanted to make the movie just like the cover of Sgt. Pepper's, everytime you look at it you see something new.
1685;He has completed this, in his masterpiece.
1686;I know it's a copy off, but the acting is amazing, could Cameron Diaz be any more psychotic?!
1687;and it's better and better everytime, the soundtrack is amazing, the acting is amazing, the plot is suberb, the ending will take the breath out of you.
1688;and plague your mind with thoughts.
1689;I shouldn't say plague, but it's such an intense feeling.
1690;it will change your life for the best.
1691;Jason Lee's casting role is perfect, he is an amazing actor, and the way he delivers lines like, the sweet is never as sweet without the sour and proximity infatuation stupifies me.
1692;I have never seen a film that better shows what love can be like.
1693;This film is a pretty good mystery, although the soundtrack should have been skipped in favor of an orchestral score but oh well.
1694;Can't feel sorry for him, even when his face is deformed he still is good looking.
1695;It's worth seeing once, not bad at all.
1696;Good directing work and a pretty good story.
1697;Reaction that is mostly found in David Lynch Movies.
1698;i remember what I was charged for the shipping and handling exactly what the amount the Post Office had stamped on the package.
1699;mmm i saw the previews for this movie and i thought it looked decent.
1700;1st of all, this movie LOOKS amazing.
1701;it has such a crisp, clear look to it.
1702;most of the images are truly vibrant, and almost have a life of their own.
1703;but I must confess, that I enjoyed 90% of Vanilla Sky.
1704;I will say that there was something interesting, enjoyable and almost voyeuristic about watching a week in the life of Tom Cruise's character.
1705;Tom did another great job.
1706;When an actor can allow his wonderful good looks to be stripped away and wear the face of a monster should have the respect that his acting ability deserves.
1707;The film is brilliant: there's a great cast that fits perfectly with a beautiful but complicated story about dreams and reality and what could happen if you lost yourself within the two.
1708;Penelope Cruz is so beautiful and lovable in this movie, and Tom gives an astonishing performance.
1709;Right from the beginning I fell completely in love with it, and the film's soundtrack (which is one of the best I have ever heard).
1710;I truly wish that more people could watch the movie from a more open perspective to truly appreciate its beauty.
1711;I don't mean to sound cheesy, but the film was definitely one of the best I've seen this year.
1712;a lot of people are skeptical about watching this one.
1713;It's a film that makes you think and feel everything and anything
1714;I am a huge movie fan.
1715;I see nearly 50 movies a year in theaters, most likely more.
1716;With all of these movies I've seen and own, Vanilla Sky is my favorite.
1717;suspense, romance, action, comedy, and science fiction.
1718;Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz have excellent chemistry.
1719;The story rapidly changes from a love story to a science fiction drama.
1720;It confuses and entertains the viewer.
1721;It make syou think and that is always admirable.
1722;This version is more colorful than the original in a working way.
1723;I am not a big Tom Cruise fan but he is a great actor!
1724;I actually enjoyed it the second time around.
1725;I paid attention more and understood it more.
1726;I think Cameron Diaz was amazing in the few short sequences after Tom gets into the car .
1727;Penelope Cruz is adorable in most of her non.
1728;I think this movie is absolutely brilliant.
1729;i think the song placement is brilliant as well.
1730;I love movies that take place in dreams too.
1731;One of the best movies ever.
1732;One of the better fantasy films made.
1733;Great story, direction and acting.
1734;I watch it at least once a year.
1735;Magical ending that leaves you wondering.
1736;Guess I probably liked it because Tom Cruise was in it.
1737;This is one of those movies that I kept passing up at the video store.
1738;Can't say too much about the movie or it will give it away.
1739;Both Tom and Cameron give good performances and I recommend seeing this film.
1740;Almost Famous was Cameron Crowe's deeply felt ode to rock and roll, a personal journey that was one of the most highly acclaimed films of 2000.
1741;David Aames (Tom Cruise) is an unapologetic, filthy rich playboy who heads a publishing empire and enjoys life to the fullest.
1742;A director with an incredible gift for visuals (the opening scene set in a completely abandoned Times Square is a knockout) and music placement (Crowe even includes a long forgotten Monkees tune The Porpoise Song in his kaleidoscope of a soundtrack), Crowe takes the audience on a journey of multiple realities this time out.
1743;Though I would be disappointed if he completely dropped his heartfelt stories that shaped the foundation of his career, I can rest assured that he can hold his own with even the most peculiar of stories.
1744;enlisting Tom Cruise into the fold is a stroke of genius, since the actor seems to be the most comfortable under Crowe's direction.
1745;Vanilla Sky asks a lot of Cruise.
1746;He comes away with an enriching performance that rivals the best work of his career.
1747;It helps to have great backup as well from actors the likes of Lee, Cruz, Diaz, Kurt Russell, Noah Taylor and Timothy Spall.
1748;As the narrative mire becomes deeper, the intensity of his performance grows with each passing minute.
1749;It is actually quite better than the film it's remaking.
1750;To see growth in talent and audacity in project selection from Crowe is certainly a treat, for Vanilla Sky is a solid entry from the director and promises some more changes of pace in the future.
1751;i wasn't sure what to expect here, but I really enjoyed this movie.
1752;The acting is great, the special effects are done well (but don't worry, there aren't that many), and the story has perfect pace.
1753;Unlike a lot of movies with twists and turns, the twists and turns actually have purpose, and in the end everything makes perfect sense, even if it didn't as you were watching it.
1754;i wouldn't call this the most brilliant movie ever, but it's certainly a breath of fresh air, when you consider how bad most of today's movies are.
1755;If you want something intelligent and entertaining, this is a good choice.
1756;Science fiction is a lot of fun to watch when done well.
1757;I have watched this before and will probably watch it again.
1758;the acting was very good and while Tom Cruise is a great actor, he is always.
1759;She was very genuine in her performance.
1760;The movie's strength, in addition to its twisting plot, is its characters.
1761;Cameron Crowe is one of my favorite filmmakers.
1762;His films are usually filled with characters who are believable, characters you can care about and a story that makes you feel good.
1763;His occasional sex buddy, Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz), is young and beautiful, but is becoming too attached for his own comfort.
1764;This is fine at the beginning or end of a film, if the character has changed during the course of our viewing.
1765;technically, the film is fine.
1766;Crowe's films are always very well.
1767;This is just one example of the technical skills employed by Crowe throughout his films.
1768;This is Tom Cruise's Best comedic performznce ever.
1769;There are two scenes that make me roll on the floor laughing.
1770;It is entertaining for hours at parties or church meetings.
1771;Cruise trying to act is funny, but this movie is hilarious.
1772;If a movie has me thinking about it the whole next day, as VANILLA SKY did, it's destined to become one of my favorites as I watch it again.
1773;It is more than meets the eye.
1774;It takes a good look at beauty (skin deep) and makes you think about what is important in life, and what is not.
1775;This is by far the best movie Cruise has starred in since Jerry Maguire.
1776;It is the most provacative thriller I have seen this year.
1777;Although many people say that it is confusing, I believe that if one watches it closely, they can see the true mastery behind this movie.
1778;I loved the ending because it leaves the movie so open and causes you to think for days.
1779;Vanilla Sky stars some beautiful people in beautiful settings.
1780;Visually, it is fun to watch.
1781;tom Cruise plays David, a rich heir to a publishing conglomerate.
1782;He coped by learning to play well.
1783;thirties, and still playing at life.
1784;He has lots of fun, but not much joy.
1785;She loves David, but understands his immaturity, and so pretends to also simply enjoy playing the game.
1786;Sofia (Penelope Cruz) enters the story, and steals David's heart.
1787;the story offers romantic tension, psychological thrills, and science fiction overtones that make this a complex and sometimes plodding adventure.
1788;The bottom line is that this is a complicated movie.
1789;Some patience is required if one is to grasp and enjoy the story.
1790;Fans of the actors and actresses, as well as those who enjoy a film that stretches, rather than merely entertaining, will applaud it.
1791;Great movie love it something I can watch over and over again and still gind out something new about it tom does this movie justice.
1792;I do not like Tom Cruise but I found the film stimulating and thought provoking.
1793;When he jumps off the top of the building I worried that the director would ruin the film with some kind of Hollywood ending but he added just the perfect visual .
1794;The sound track was a wonderful lubricant that kept everything moving smoothly forward.
1795;It was proclaimed a Turkey but I thought it was a winner.
1796;It was an excellent movie with kinda a sad ending.
1797;A trip worth taking and highly entertaining.
1798;At the start of the film David is involved in a serious relationship with a beautiful blonde named Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz).
1799;She reminds him of some of the unavoidable truths about their relationship.
1800;Pleasant, pleasant dreams filled with the Sophia he met at the party and skies colored in vanilla.
1801;Would you rather live your life in a comfortable existence filled with superficial happiness or would you rather live an exciting, though often painful life filled with wonder and awe, truth and beauty, but only occasional moments of happiness?
1802;This is a decision that each one of us is actually presented with daily.
1803;We might not always recognize it as such, but it is and the way that choice is presented in the film makes VANILLA SKY such a powerful and engaging piece of cinema.
1804;cruise's ego works well for most of the film, though it denies the audience from completely identifying and empathizing with the plight of David Aames.
1805;Cruise is a great jerk, but not a very good reformed man.
1806;Penelope Cruz reminds me of a Spanish Audrey Hepburn and though she isn't in the movie a great deal, she shines in the moments that she is.
1807;She does a wonderful job of portraying Julie, an everywoman character that many women who have been stepped upon by men can relate to.
1808;Julie isn't on screen very long either, but when she is she raises some important questions about love, relationships, and sex in American society.
1809;Another important actor in the film is Jason Lee.
1810;Like Cruise, sometimes having Lee in a picture is a turnoff, however in VANILLA SKY he is perfectly cast.
1811;It also has an open ending, so people who have to have a movie end all tidy will have problems with the film's ending.
1812;Nevertheless, the film is a beautiful piece of cinema that engages and entertains.
1813;That's something only really good movies can do.
1814;ever Cameron, even Jason Lee, Kurt Russell are good supporting actors), good camera work (which captures much the beauty of the cast).
1815;I highly recommend everyone to watch the original again, if you haven't done so.
1816;i give an extra star for the extra behind.
1817;Watching this after viewing the convoluted mess, MULHOLLAND DR., was like a breath of fresh air.
1818;The whole thing is spelled out in it's conclusion.
1819;Cameron Crowe practically leads you by the hand.
1820;Cruise and Cruz have great chemistry together.
1821;And Cameron Diaz' performance is chilling.
1822;I have a newfound respect for her.
1823;Next to BORN ON THE FORTH OF JULY, this is Tom's best performance by far.
1824;He says, it's his favorite film to date.
1825;His performance is sad, hilarious, and profoundly touching.
1826;Jason Lee is always great and he's a riot in this film.
1827;Kurt Russell in a marvelously understated role.
1828;This is the important choice that Cruise makes which ultimately changes his whole life and the direction or conflict of the story.
1829;The subconscious is a powerful thing is stated several times in the film.
1830;Pretty simple stuff when you see it unfolding.
1831;As for comparing this to MEMENTO: OK, a psychological thriller with an unusual timeline device.
1832;These two films are pretty far apart in their intentions.
1833;Stunningly put together and masterfully directed by Cameron Crowe.
1834;It gives away a part of the plot .
1835;This movie is one of the reason's why I love film.
1836;One of the 2 or 3 best films of 2001.
1837;I have watched this flick about five times, and have to say that with each viewing, I appreciate it more.
1838;if you like any of the above flicks, this one is worth the time.
1839;cameron Crowe's use of music in this film is superb, each little bit corresponds with the movement of the plot.
1840;tom Cruise, who I believe may be a very fine actor, but takes the 'easy way out' with more ordinary, general public pleasing roles, is really incredible in this, much as he was in 'Eyes Wide Shut'.
1841;when he takes the chance, he is truly riveting as the character he takes on.
1842;trippy experience and a true visionary filmmaking idea.
1843;kudos to you, all those who made this film, and all those who choose to watch it with an open mind.
1844;is it life, or is it a dream?
1845;'living the dream, baby, living the dream'
1846;This film brought so many questions to the surface.
1847;Cruz played her part as a prop well.
1848;The surprise character was Kurt Russell.
1849;I think it ws really well done.
1850;I would recommend it watching it.
1851;Tom Cruise tried to play this part with his normal good talent.
1852;The music was good, Tom Cruise rocks, but can anyone tell me what happened?
1853;it will get better .
1854;At the end I thought .
1855;They paied good money .
1856;an ending does NOT make a movie good.
1857;if u can stand the first 90 minutes, the last part of the movie is interesting.
1858;one wonders if the director ever had a real dream in his life.
1859;This notion has an agenda, and is sought out with vis and vim .
1860;from a creative view, the film is absolutely fabulous.
1861;Excellent cinematography, dialog and soundtrack.
1862;Spectacular performances add value to this collectible.
1863;provoking and well worth ponderance.
1864;I love all the people involved in the project.
1865;Great concept, it just doesn't work and now I need some happy pills.
1866;Science fiction can be very enjoyable,but this far out plot line wasn't any fun as well as being unplausable.
1867;This film pretends to be more than it is, but it is still a fine film.
1868;In an intriguing way, it portrays the mystery that the world of dreams and the world of reality are often much more intertwined than we think or imagine.
1869;It also points out that the life lived in reality, especially in intimate relationships, is much richer and more fulfilling, with all its challenges, than what we may imagine as our dream or fantasy lives.
1870;Just because a film is visually stunning, doesn't mean it's good.
1871;I saw this tripe it's opening weekend with my sister and 8 year old nephew Jean' and he summed it up perfectly when he began crying and shrieked.
1872;i actually got teary eyed when I saw this and, I guess I have to give Tom Cruise credit for nailing the body language down.
1873;The movies disguises confusion as deep plot is a common one.
1874;this movie is an amazing cinematic experience.
1875;The movie is AWARE of that fact and also gives you the reason!
1876;a masterfully told story, with great music and greater lines.
1877;pack can associate with: he's rich, better looking than 99% of us, sleeps with women who are about 10 times hotter than the ones we sleep with, lives life king size and doesn't even work (sort of).
1878;but in our young, love.
1879;lusting minds, they are the perfect saviours for our lovelorn lives.
1880;romance factor and makes it believable when it afflicts Tom Cruise.
1881;That, is an achievement in great storytelling.
1882;i haven't seen the original and I'm sure it must be a good movie.
1883;but I still wonder if it can top the Cruise/Crowe experience.
1884;excellent choice for repeat viewings (in the same category as Terminator 2: Judgement Day.
1885;You must really love this movie if you understand the title.
1886;hilarious, hence the 2 stars, not 1) this film uses too many one.
1887;fiction movie, with special effects and all.
1888;basically, the movie constantly pounds you over the head time after time after time with high.
1889;Those who bought into the foolery thought it was a great movie.
1890;Because this is a big reveal type of film, I will not say anything more here to prevent spoilers.
1891;there are two primary reasons that Vanilla Sky is such an extraordinary film:First, it is very much high.
1892;This plotline is almost guaranteed to make you think while viewing, and it will likely be still rattling around in your brain for awhile after viewing.
1893;secondly, though, is that a film like Vanilla Sky can only work if it contains incredible character development, which it indeed achieves.
1894;In order to truly appreciate both the ending and the overall journey, both the writing and acting must be spot.
1895;It is, and as such will leave you feeling as if you truly care about the struggles of David Aames and his world.
1896;overall, Vanilla Sky is an excellent concept film that ranks right up there with Eternal Sunshine, Memento, The Matrix, and the like.
1897;It even has very much of a romantic aspect for those who enjoy high emotion.
1898;This one will make you think, but it is more than worth it in the end.
