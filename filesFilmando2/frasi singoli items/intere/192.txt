I:74779;1;we did not have huge expectations, but it was a really fun movie for the whole family.
I:74779;2;"If you live in San Francisco, Cambridge, or Greenwich Village
I:74779;3;symbolic of Film Noir from the 50's (Touch of Evil and The Trial), but more technically savvy.
I:74779;4;It is a masterpiece in control, and a director's ability to create mood .
I:74779;5;in the true spirit of independent cinema style, in display with all it glory (and gratuitousness).
I:74779;6;it furthered the narrative to establish a man truly on the edge.
I:74779;7;* While I did not feel personally for Cohen's character, I enjoyed being a voyeur and following his track to see where he would end up.
I:74779;8;My goal was very narrative driven and I don't think the director's aim was for us to empathize with the character .
I:74779;9;artsy crowd hooked on and to drive the narrative forward in a linear fashion.
I:74779;10;* Sound Editing: The director's total skill and control on these two stylistic elements is what makes this film an imperfect masterpiece.
I:74779;11;I so enjoyed the complimenting of the sound bridges to give the impending feeling of foreboding.
I:74779;12;thoroughly enjoyable in the end.
I:74779;13;I'd give it .5 if possible.
I:74779;14;Consulting with his mentor, Sol Robeson (Mark Margolis), Max is informed that it might exist, but Sol also warns him that once he fixates on a specific number he will begin to see it everywhere.
I:74779;15;my Comments:Two friends highly recommended this movie.
I:74779;16;Yes, the idea that pretty much everything in the universe can be represented mathematically is cool.
I:74779;17;Also cool is the idea that perhaps there is a single number that holds the key to unraveling all of the mysteries of the universe.
I:74779;18;pi is probably the most original and thought.
I:74779;19;it is an incredible viewing experience to say the least.
I:74779;20;it has some of the most incredible camerawork and visual effects (without a hollywood budget at that) i've ever seen!
I:74779;21;this movie will have you (at least ME) at the edge of your seat.
I:74779;22;the mysterious and dark nature of the film is very intense and chilling.
I:74779;23;the soundtrack is also worth a look because it goes perfectly with the tone of the film (dark techno mostly).
I:74779;24;sean gullette is perfect as maximilian cohen.
I:74779;25;this is one of my all time favorite independent films.
I:74779;26;i really think this movie is perfect in every way!
I:74779;27;Quite amazing for such a low budget psycho sci.
I:74779;28;It's one of those dark, crazy movies that will transport you outside of the regular high.
I:74779;29;saturated color reality that hollywood usually creates.
I:74779;30;Any of the most profound questions we come up with as kids are ignored by the know.
I:74779;31;Such is a question asked in Pi, a film that works on many levels among them: avant garde filmmaking, asking if there is an intelligence behind all that exists, and finding the pattern of that intelligence, implementation of electronic music effectively, theoretical physics, and chaos theory.
I:74779;32;It is a great movie.
I:74779;33;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:74779;34;The music score really does it justice.
I:74779;35;It is directed well and leaves the viewer unsettled.
I:74779;36;Would give it 0 stars!
I:74779;37;I honestly couldnt even watch the movie.
I:74779;38;I remember being more impressed the first time I saw it.
I:74779;39;Still, an intriguing story and well acted.
I:74779;40;I really enjoyed very entertaining movie, Pi .
I:74779;41;This is a very stylish film that deserves more attention from film viewers.
I:74779;42;First of all, although in many scenes the camera shakes a lot, tilts, and uses unusual angles, the effect of this only adds to the insanity that is going on in the movie.
I:74779;43;Thirdly, some one pointed out that this movie was cheaply made, and it is true that this movie had one of the movie industry's lowest budget.
I:74779;44;Anyways, great film, and I would definately recommend this film to anyone.
I:74779;45;I was interested in the premise of the movie and entertained throughout the first half, good tie ins with religion, mathematics and the social acceptability of both.
I:74779;46;Pi is a breath of fresh air for those who enjoy original and dark movies.
I:74779;47;"Written and directed by the experimental and promising Darren Aronofsky, ""Pi"" presents an interesting and intelligent story."
I:74779;48;max Cohen (actor Sean Gullette) is a mathematical genius, obsessed with his theory that says that all the elements that conform life are based on numbers.
I:74779;49;sean Gullette delivered a great performance as the neurotic Max, and carried on his shoulders a big percentage of the interest of the movie.
I:74779;50;The director Darren Aronofsky took care of even the slightest detail of the film, the story, the music, the situations and the mathematical theories are very interesting overall.
I:74779;51;Pi is recommendable for everyone who enjoy good independent movies.
I:74779;52;Two stars is me being generous too.
I:74779;53;Requiem for a Dream is considered to be one of the best movies of recent memory (and, from what I saw of it, I can agree), and has many of the same techniques as his previous film, Pi.
I:74779;54;max Cohen (Sean Gullette) is a mathematical genius.
I:74779;55;He keeps on going, as people want to use his mathematical abilities for their own selfish reasons.
I:74779;56;so much that if you watch it once you can't distinguish between reality and Max's mind.
I:74779;57;aronofsky makes this movie on parking meter money (less than $10,000), yet it's one of the most stylish movies of recent memory.
I:74779;58;Shot in black/white (there is barely any grey) with a type of vision that leaves edges to the imagination, Pi works in its own little world.
I:74779;59;With a short runtime that's shorter than Dennis Miller on one of his longwinded analogies, it works.
I:74779;60;well acted all around, especially by Guellette, Pi is not for everyone.
I:74779;61;There's many disturbing moments, involving brains and power tools.
I:74779;62;But if you're game, go for it!
I:74779;63;The protagonist narrates the story and is so dynamic and separated from normal society that he is what you keep watching for.
I:74779;64;Definitely enjoyable to see his behavior and perceptions.
I:74779;65;An allegorical tale that stimulates the mind as well as the eyes.
I:74779;66;Deserved the Ocar nominations it received.
I:74779;67;and yet it manages to be incredibly surreal.
I:74779;68;"He is obsessed with number theory
I:74779;69;I was hooked from the start.
I:74779;70;probably won a couple of film festivals, but to artsy for me.
I:74779;71;"The movie has a little of the graphical flavor of Tetsuo , but with a far more gripping plot
I:74779;72;Definitely the best film I saw in 1998.
I:74779;73;Can't say I loved it but i was glad I saw it.
I:74779;74;The ending is fitting to the action.
I:74779;75;it is about, as Max so brilliantly put it, what's between the numbers.
I:74779;76;it is an exploration of one man's genius (a man who is *incidentally* a mathematician), and the disturbing tendancy of genius to couple itself with madness.
I:74779;77;Second, this film meets one of my personal criteria for a very good to great film in that it offers filmmakers / photographers good content to dig into, admire and learn from.
I:74779;78;Shot in black and white, the film has a certain 1960's.
I:74779;79;Gullette's performance, especially in wing nut mode, is great.
I:74779;80;By the end, he's shaved his head and recollects the best of Robert DeNiro in Taxi Driver in his intensity, although his character is not required to jump off a personal cliff quite so high as DeNiro's.
I:74779;81;Like all great films, this one leaves audiences with more questions than answers.
I:74779;82;For the adventurous film fan, it's a worthy film.
I:74779;83;This is the ultimate Hacker's movie of 1998!
I:74779;84;The director does the impressive job of taking the hacking experience and faithfully putting it on the screen.
I:74779;85;The photography is great, they managed to shoot the entire film with only black and white, with no grey, which made for a really cool look.
I:74779;86;If you know what it feels like to hack for forty hours straight, this is the movie to see!
I:74779;87;Reading the reviews I get the feeling that a lot of people feel obligated to give the movie high marks simply because it is focused on a mathematician.
I:74779;88;"The feel if the movie is more psychedelic ""wow, man"", than a movie that really makes you think."
I:74779;89;To that extent, Pi is a massive success.
I:74779;90;The black and white photography, the angle of the camera shots all added to haunting characteristics of the actors and overall feel of the movie.
I:74779;91;Pi is one of the most unique, original, bizarre films to come around in a long while.
I:74779;92;I liked it for that reason.
I:74779;93;The other reason is that with each viewing of it, something new is uncovered.
I:74779;94;The grainy, 16mm camerawork gives it an eerie, paranoid feel to it.
I:74779;95;I also think it gives the film it's artistic qualities.
I:74779;96;If we can find it we will understand the whole world.
I:74779;97;I thought the movie was excellent.
I:74779;98;I wish the directors and actors the best of luck.
I:74779;99;In order to be good, a psychological drama has to involve real people.
I:74779;100;Max Cohen is a genius (how?)
I:74779;101;to make a Great Discovery of some kind.
I:74779;102;minute Internet search, mind you .
I:74779;103;liners, overacting, and best of all, grainy black and white.
I:74779;104;so Aronofsky is big on style.
I:74779;105;Oh, but I do understand .
I:74779;106;all the clever words and cool concepts without the whole profundity thing.
I:74779;107;If you find such a thing in some way interesting, feel free to watch it.
I:74779;108;Pi is a tense and thought.
I:74779;109;Sean Gullette delivers a frenetic performance as Max Cohen, a brilliant, antisocial, and deeply paranoid mathematician.
I:74779;110;Max is a fascinating character and his story was absorbing.
I:74779;111;Shot in black and white with awesome camera work and some truly bizzare and disturbing scenes, this is a visually compelling movie as well.
I:74779;112;A grainy B&W film which I found confronting.
I:74779;113;My teenage son wanted it, so I sourced it through Amazon.
I:74779;114;Occasionally, one of the actors says something interesting (namely the main protagonist's mentor .
I:74779;115;"I admit I fast forwarded through a couple of the more ""artistic"" scenes."
I:74779;116;Darren Aronofsky's Pi is a sharply written, tightly paced, brilliantly acted, economically filmed, twisted, mind.
I:74779;117;provoking, tense, suspenseful, difficult, but excellent debut psychological thriller from one of America's most distinct and ingenious talents.
I:74779;118;Often Kafkesque in its strange but endlessly fascinating subject matter, and so smart and mind.
I:74779;119;blowing it will give you migraines, Pi represents a stunning debut by Darren Aronofsky, later to be famous for films such as Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain, and Black Swan.
I:74779;120;"In a world where most thrillers have buff heroes running from huge explosions or punching/shooting each other for half the running time, it is comforting to know films like Pi exist
I:74779;121;budget films for a smart, thinking audience.
I:74779;122;Yes, he is a mathematician and likely has a functional form of autism, Asberger's.
I:74779;123;And yes the movie builds on the Van Gough.
I:74779;124;connected theme that genius and madness are synonymous.
I:74779;125;In the case of Max his discovery of a sequence of 216 individual numbers and its revolutionary applications to penetrating the mysteries of the physical world, especially the stock market, and maybe even God Himself, leads to a nervous breakdown and a Van.
I:74779;126;But at the very end of the movie we are led to believe that Max does make a personal breakthrough and finds peace.
I:74779;127;So when I see a character hobbled by his own hubris and sense of self.
I:74779;128;In a way Pi is a Greek tragedy, of a man who has been vouchsafed a superhuman power (mathematical genius), and he is destroyed by the gods because of his hubris.
I:74779;129;ray], and the influence is very evident.
I:74779;130;What we have here then, if viewed in this light, is a modern Nostradamus prophecy crafted in a surrealist vein, with numerology thrown in for good measure.
I:74779;131;a. like that is quick at his heels throughout.
I:74779;132;It a one of a kind scifi thriller that leaves you wondering and guessing to the spectacular ending that you would not of guessed.
I:74779;133;The acting for the most part was pretty good which is probably the biggest upside of them film.
I:74779;134;This movie is beautifully written and has an amazing way of coming together.
I:74779;135;This is a must see.
I:74779;136;Both movies are shot in a somewhat gritty b w film, both have a great vision, and both have actors you've probably never seen before but who do a bang.
I:74779;137;This movie is pretty hard.
I:74779;138;I actually enjoyed watching this movie by myself and making my own conclusions .
I:74779;139;This makes him quite popular with a group of individuals looking to bank some serious cash.
I:74779;140;digit number that will unlock the secrets of God.
I:74779;141;It's a good start, and Pi will take you further down those roads.
I:74779;142;There are ample A. ha!
I:74779;143;experiences of insight, and though the ending is kind of the easy way out (hence 4 stars instead of 5), it will be quite enjoyable.
I:74779;144;Pi is one great reason why you should explore an independent film now and again: It is definitely a departure from the realm of big.
I:74779;145;budget entertainment that puts special effects and pretty faces ahead of good acting and a good plot.
I:74779;146;Much like a later work for Aronofski, it spells a decent into paranoia and madness by circumstances.
I:74779;147;Some of the music you will recognize.
I:74779;148;moment then you will be interested in a real one in the book and documentary of The Narnia Code.
I:74779;149;as a person who has suffered from migraines all my life, it is unnerving to see such apainful and accurate portrayal of these horrors.
I:74779;150;it is odd, depressing, but I thought our hero's solution was a good one.
I:74779;151;I'm a math geek and thought it would be interesting.
I:74779;152;This is crazy, disturbing, painful, engrossing and so, so simple.
I:74779;153;I beleived it, I loved it, I even copied his hairstyle.
I:74779;154;This is a gotta see, but be warned, it stays with you.
I:74779;155;Reinforces the popular view that to be good at math, you must be mentally ill.
I:74779;156;A Brilliant Mind is a far better film.
I:74779;157;I am married to a mathematician and he is brilliant and yet well adjusted.
I:74779;158;i would recommend it to a friend.
I:74779;159;He is a mathematical genius, searching for a number that will unlock the mysteries of the stock market.
I:74779;160;He is driven by his life.
I:74779;161;All systems, in all of creation.
I:74779;162;Patterns exist everywhere, the world is illusive with an ordered infinity lurking behind every corner.
I:74779;163;The golden ratio divides us all, and we follow this organized section, but sometimes I guess it skips a generation or so, well this time we can take the example of the Screenwriter, and the Director of this film's mind.
I:74779;164;but though I would have given this movie a 1 star I chose to give it 2 as the cinematography of the movie is superb, and the camera panning highly stylized.
I:74779;165;so you are having a down day, and you do not have too many questions coming to your mind, do give this movie a thought, it is a guarantee that it would uplift your spirits, as we all know laughter is the best medicine.
I:74779;166;Eventually he reaches a breakthrough when he becomes interested in the mystical Jewish philosophy of Kabbalah and finds parallels between it and mathematical theory.
I:74779;167;don't worry if you're not really into math or the Kabbalah, Pi is still very entertaining.
I:74779;168;It has excellent acting and great photography (despite the obviously low budget).
I:74779;169;But if you are into such things, the movie also does manage to make excellent parallels between theoretical mathematics and Kabbalah (however you want to spell it) while presenting both accurately, and is mind expanding and thought provoking.
I:74779;170;Made on an ultra low budget Aronofsky manages to piece together a fantastic film about a genius' struggle to live with his gift.
I:74779;171;Hopefully he'll also be able to save the batman series.
I:74779;172;I should be happy right?
I:74779;173;Fascinating if you're the type that likes to eat worms, perhaps.
I:74779;174;Pi is a surreal trip of a movie, and from reading other reviews, you should know what it is about.
I:74779;175;The acting is great, the cinematography is great, and the plot is well thought out.
I:74779;176;Pi is one of the few films that has actually made me say Ohhhhh God, Don't do THAT!
I:74779;177;(In the comfort of my own home, of course.)
I:74779;178;A few parts also made me want to cover my eyes, but Pi is so compelling, I don't.
I:74779;179;For me, it is a movie that should be enjoyed once in a while, because its unpredictability is what made it so gripping.
I:74779;180;I had high hopes for this movie.
I:74779;181;At last, a story a math major could love.
I:74779;182;Will appeal to those who like independent movies with an edge and those who are interested in how the universe can be represented mathematically, those who fantasize about figuring out how to get rich off the stock market and those who would enjoy gritty Hasidim.
I:74779;183;In real life, they're red and white, and help keep migraineur people like me from going out in search of a nice, sharp guillotine.
I:74779;184;These days, an inhaler has replaced the injections (or suppositories), which is nice, but that injection dohickey does look so much more stylish.
I:74779;185;The movie was good though, and kept me entertained the whole time.
I:74779;186;I had heard it was really good, and I had heard it was very cleverly done.
I:74779;187;hop entandres are combinations of fast sounds and fast camera shots.
I:74779;188;Aronofsky wrote and directed it, proving he is a ture talent.
I:74779;189;A movie this good as a debut goes to show that a lot is expected of him.
I:74779;190;Pi is an important debut from an extremely talented and important director.
I:74779;191;This is a stunning movie by Darren Aronofsky with a unique vision, but it is not for everyone.
I:74779;192;Shot in sharp, grainy, bold black and white, it is the story of an obsessed mathematics whiz named Max who might be more than slightly mad: he triple locks himself in his apartment, avoids people like they're infectious and works continually upon a complex self.
I:74779;193;it bears mentioning that I have seen, and admired, two previous Aronofsky movies .
I:74779;194;which I thought were terrific.
I:74779;195;"Yet I found PI to be enthralling
I:74779;196;yet the first moment I even thought of what time it was occurred about seven minutes before the credits rolled.
I:74779;197;"what is accomplished most successfully here is Sean Gullette's portrayal of Max with all his ""frayed edges,"" a man whose bright, facile mind fuels his pyrotechnic manias, and it is indicative of Aronofsky's skilled direction that we often feel we are seeing the world through his eyes."
I:74779;198;"Max is brilliant
I:74779;199;another note: cinematographer Matthew Libatique deserves a great deal of credit.
I:74779;200;Aronofsky settles the issue, and the movie will present a resolution.
I:74779;201;Requiem for a Dream is one of my favorite movies, and I don't know how Darren Aronofsky can be capable of such a bad movie.
I:74779;202;Arronofsky is a director everyone should know by now and to keep an eye on in the future.
I:74779;203;Pi is his first film and it's a fantastic film to add.
I:74779;204;With a great story that makes you think.
I:74779;205;it's a must for everyone who loves really good films.
I:74779;206;Darren Aronofsky's black and white artistic film, Pi, is an intense cinematic experience.
I:74779;207;this film will make you think and intrigue you with its spellbinding mixture of real mathematical concepts and their parallels in our everyday lives.
I:74779;208;this film leaves lingering questions about the natural world in which we live.
I:74779;209;Love the concept of the movie.
I:74779;210;A truly unique, brilliant effort.
I:74779;211;As one of the earlier films to explore the world of madness from a first.
I:74779;212;budget psychological thriller that was created on the cusp of a wildly popular new genre.
I:74779;213;Along with a handful of other films scattered throughout the 90's such as 12 Monkeys and The Fisher King, Pi helped pave the way for an explosion of incredible films.
I:74779;214;Fight Club, Memento, Donnie Darko and A Beautiful Mind, as well as director Aronofsky's next film Requiem For a Dream, to name just a few.
I:74779;215;Since it is so powerful, there are people interested in using it to their advantage, so of course they will do whatever they can to try and figure out the secrets of math to use to their advantage.
I:74779;216;Though the film is somewhat cheesy at times, I still love the intensity, the thought processes, and the examples used throughout the story.
I:74779;217;I've seen it about 20 times and still love to watch it ever year or so.
I:74779;218;Hard to follow at times, but for some reason it keeps your attention.
I:74779;219;black, white and jittery gray, the result had better be good.
I:74779;220;Color is the medium of life.
I:74779;221;d support cast, leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay.
I:74779;222;Unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and ad.
I:74779;223;The themes inspiring PI have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine .
I:74779;224;As a fine creative exercise, the creators are praised for their effort and bravery .
I:74779;225;hour traffic and commands the watcher's attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in.
I:74779;226;"Fans of the ""The Blair Witch Project"" might enjoy this one."
I:74779;227;I like to see what is going on between actors and their surroundings.
I:74779;228;"I recommend ""The Ring"", ""Ghost Ship"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Others"", or ""The Exorcist""."
I:74779;229;a young man so in love with NUMBERS.
I:74779;230;For anyone passionate about theory, numbers, the science of life, 'Pi' is a must see.
I:74779;231;I thought this would be real good.
I:74779;232;She is a kid who just likes to play with her calculator and is fascinated by how Max can instantly solve any equation she gives him in his head.
I:74779;233;This simplifies to the fraction 22/7, the result is 3.1428 which is a good approximation of pi often taught in primary schools.
I:74779;234;If you graph these numbers, patterns emerge.
I:74779;235;therefore: There are patterns everywhere in nature.
I:74779;236;A large part of what makes Pi a fascinating film is the fascination of numbers themselves.
I:74779;237;therefore: The Bottom Line is that Pi is an intriguing film by a talented director that will be enjoyed by people who like to have their thoughts stimulated while they are being entertained.
I:74779;238;It has to do with that number.
I:74779;239;There's an answer in that number.
I:74779;240;I selected it on its subject matter and having four stars from other viewers.
I:74779;241;I really enjoyed the story, it was entertaining.
I:74779;242;I thought it would be a good sci fi flick.
I:74779;243;But I thought the person who wrote this must have been on drugs.
I:74779;244;The penetration, the breadth, the myths and the mayhem, what a piece of work.
I:74779;245;Like so many works, it depends on what you bring to it.
I:74779;246;It is a film for those who love film.
I:74779;247;This is an important work.
I:74779;248;It's very rare to come across a film with no redeeming qualities.
I:74779;249;I anticipate that, in my book, Pi will rate higher than It's OK.
I:74779;250;"scifi somewhat like ""the man from earth"" which i enjoyed ."
I:74779;251;This great black white movie by Darren Aronofsky is about a man, Max Cohen, who is obsessed with math.
I:74779;252;This is a very suspenseful movie completely centered on the presence of math everywhere in nature.
I:74779;253;Darren Aronofsky won best director 1998 at the Sundance Film Festival for it, which he definitely deserved!
I:74779;254;I love this movie .
I:74779;255;This along with Requiem For A Dream are very good movies.
I:74779;256;Although I thought that Requiem for a Dream was better I still rate this movie with 5 stars.
I:74779;257;Then after about a year i met this girl who like the same kinda movies that i like and she kept telling me that it was a great movie and all.
I:74779;258;So i bought it and watched it that night and she was right it was a great movie.
I:74779;259;And i also love the techniques that Darren Aronofsky uses with the camera in front of the actors face.
I:74779;260;But overall this was a good movie.
I:74779;261;This movie is shear genius!
I:74779;262;Aaronofsky will be remembered forever for this classic.
I:74779;263;"The ""still cam"" that is used will be seen often in the future."
I:74779;264;The feelings that come over you during the viewing take you into the mind of Max.
I:74779;265;Really enjoyed the subject and the acting was excellent.
I:74779;266;I would recommend this film to audiences looking for a unique sci.
I:74779;267;This movie is a classic of the psuedo.
I:74779;268;The truth is, this movie is more focused on the drugs and the weirdo.
I:74779;269;This is a deep and thought.
I:74779;270;It's difficult to get into, but explores some beautiful themes.
I:74779;271;But its got some cool points for what there trying to get across.
I:74779;272;Peer inside the mind of a genius.
I:74779;273;Can't recommend it to anyone.
I:74779;274;Brainiacs might enjoy this movie more.
I:74779;275;It seemed to have an interesting theme, so I decided to give it a view.
I:74779;276;it had a few interesting characters, especially Max's teacher, but ths story moved very slowly.
I:74779;277;i wish I had a better review, as the description of the movie really did capture my interest.
I:74779;278;Internal forces also come into play, as the closer Max gets to the answer, them more he finds a sort of madness setting in.
I:74779;279;What answers lie behind the numbers everyone wants?Here is a very intriguing film that may not be for everyone.
I:74779;280;The black and white imagery is fast paced, and the music almost a constant throbbing in your ear, providing the viewer a mere glimpse of the madness that begins to envelope the main character.
I:74779;281;there are quite a bit of special features including commentary tracks that may help to shed light on some of the more curious aspects of the film, lost scenes (aren't they really deleted scenes?
I:74779;282;white, and so is the gritty story and most of the characters.
I:74779;283;The unique look fits the story.
I:74779;284;It's that kind of love it.
I:74779;285;It's unique, artistic, well written, intelligent, edgy, and engaging.
I:74779;286;I understand Pi's not a film for everybody, but if you are into films that fit the above criteria, I think you will enjoy it.
I:74779;287;If you like black and white movies this is for you.
I:74779;288;this movie is for you.
I:74779;289;Better to go with choice E than embarrass yourself.
I:74779;290;It's in high contrast black and white and has the sensibility and intelligence of early black and white movies.
I:74779;291;ironically, the choice of black and white was appropriate for the film.
I:74779;292;The acting was superb and the special effects were quite good for a low.
I:74779;293;With better directing, acting, and cinematogrophy it could be a real treat.
I:74779;294;then this is one you'll definitely want to see.
I:74779;295;But it turns out that Robeson is himself working along similar lines, and he pays the price.
I:74779;296;But the tension is real and the character development is high.
I:74779;297;This movie is darkly brilliant .
I:74779;298;the story of obsession is one we can all relate to, and Max's descent into madness is brilliantly filmed and acted.
I:74779;299;the R rating is well deserved though, as the hallucination scenes are quite disturbing, and the images of a disembodied brain are positively creepy.
I:74779;300;paced in the way it is shot.
I:74779;301;The plot is gripping, and the films dark tone will freak you out (esp.
I:74779;302;The extras are great, too.
I:74779;303;12:05 AM, began writing review for Pi, an amazing film by Darren Aronofsky.
I:74779;304;For those who don't know the Fibonacci, start with 1 and 1.
I:74779;305;Bizarre imagery also comes into play, such as the mystery man with the bleeding hand, the brain, and his visions and dreams.
I:74779;306;Can that somehow works in this very moving story.
I:74779;307;Some may be disappointed in the ending, but the journey is well worth your time.
I:74779;308;I really love this movie.
I:74779;309;Want to watch it again.
I:74779;310;Love it and love it love it again.
I:74779;311;Interesting movie that I didn't fully get.
I:74779;312;To show us a really intensely focused, disturbed, ill, and hunted protagonist?
I:74779;313;"Anyway, the movie was decent
I:74779;314;If I could return the time it took to watch this movie to myself, I certainly would.
I:74779;315;i would recommend this film to any cinema major who would like an excellent example of what not to do.
I:74779;316;at least then, you'd have a good laugh.
I:74779;317;As a lover of math, I was hoping to see a thriller connected intimately to the well.
I:74779;318;that a great film can be executed by such a talented director and cast within such restraints renews my faith in the movie arts.
I:74779;319;Pi staring Sean Gullette is one of my favorite movies.
I:74779;320;social genius who has myriad visions.
I:74779;321;For those people out there who love enigmas love to solve them, this is the movie for you.
I:74779;322;Pi is a very interesting movie about a math genius who tries to outsmart the stock market.
I:74779;323;One of Darren Aronofsky's lesser acclaimed works, but is still amazing.
I:74779;324;If you liked Requiem for a Dream you'll really enjoy Pi.
I:74779;325;Definitely one of the best cyberpunk sci.
I:74779;326;a stunningly bold work for a director's feature debut.
I:74779;327;Missed opportunity to be an interesting film.
I:74779;328;Outside the box, quirky, psychological thriller.
I:74779;329;Off the wall and over the top movie.
I:74779;330;Max Cohen, mathematical genius, believes they are.
I:74779;331;He is thus tormented both within and without.
I:74779;332;one of the things that made this a successful commercial film (for an indie venture, of course) is the fine acting by Sean Gullette who plays Max Cohen.
I:74779;333;"He was entirely convincing as a reclusive and paranoid mathematical genius
I:74779;334;The choice of Pamela Hart, a strong black woman as a kind of hit woman from Wall Street was excellent.
I:74779;335;Much of the detail was completely veracious, the spiral as an example of complexity in nature, or the wonderful re.
I:74779;336;Also wondrously right was the spider/moth sticky cocoon that gummed up his computer, or the little girl who multiplies on her calculator and then asks Max for the answer, delighted when he gets it right.
I:74779;337;And an especially good fit was the techno rock in the background.
I:74779;338;Indeed what makes this an engrossing movie is its psychological and visual content.
I:74779;339;The stark, grainy black and white cinematography actually enhance our appreciation.
I:74779;340;Indeed, light and dark and other dichotomies are part of the expression of Aronofsky's vision.
I:74779;341;He juxtaposes contrasting elements of our culture, of the mind and of nature to tease us into seeing that the world is vastly more mysterious than we can imagine.
I:74779;342;And there is life, fragile, uncertain, teetering on the edge, and in the fuzzy distance there is the shimmering certainly of a fundamental religion.
I:74779;343;Aronsky catches all of this and ends up with an electronic poem camouflaged as a movie.
I:74779;344;Personally, I highly recommend this film to anyone who's done any research into the golden ratio.
I:74779;345;This is truly an excellent movie.
I:74779;346;One of the best in my collection.
I:74779;347;I have seen it over 15 times and I still love to watch it.
I:74779;348;The movie about the 216 digit number that can both unlock the secrets of the stock market as well as the Kaballah is a classic.
I:74779;349;Perhaps a little too brilliant for his own good.
I:74779;350;This man believes there is a pattern and he is bent on finding it.
I:74779;351;Max finds the number for *both* and finds that he is wanted by both.
I:74779;352;this independant black and white film is masterfully done.
I:74779;353;Well acted and well scripted.
I:74779;354;You will get chills and thrills when watching this movie.
I:74779;355;The commentary tracks are very informative as well.
I:74779;356;good acting and interesting presentation in black and white.
I:74779;357;Very contrasty and grainy evoking a vintage feel.
I:74779;358;The gritty, exhilarating depiction of Manhattan's Lower East Side/Chinatown district is the perfect setting for Max Cohen's undoing.
I:74779;359;A fantastic score, terrific performances, and lingering creepiness make Pi the most impressive debut film since Lynch's 1976 head trip midnight classic.
I:74779;360;First, the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay, and the Gotham Open Palm Award.
I:74779;361;While this is a movie I think I could like, it moved in such a discordant way that it took away from the basic narrative.
I:74779;362;this movie is very complex and I don't even fully understand which is why I'm still looking at it but I can tell it's a great movie.
I:74779;363;I love this movie, I saw it when it came out and still holds up today.
I:74779;364;I must admit, however, that Aronofsky DID do an excellent job with direction.
I:74779;365;If you want to watch a depressing movie about mental illness, then great.
I:74779;366;Pi is unquestionably one of the most audacious feature.
I:74779;367;length films in recent memory, largely because the questions that it raises are not only theoretical but also, in the truest sense, larger than life.
I:74779;368;Director Darren Aronofsky's debut is a wild ride to both the frontier of intellectual inquiry as well as the physical consequences such inquiries can have on those who ask the big questions , namely in this case Max Cohen, the brilliant mathematician played to perfection by Sean Gullette.
I:74779;369;This is a film that would appeal to every Einstein and Stephen Hawking in the world as well as those who have a layman's interest in theoretical mathematics.
I:74779;370;and the striking similarities we humans see in both the organic and inorganic in nature, in this case, the tormented Cohen sees a relationship between the golden spiral (based on studies by the ancient Greeks) and pi.
I:74779;371;I felt it was one of the best films of the late 1990s, and one which should be required viewing for anyone even remotely interested in how number theory can (and may not) tie in with human concerns of everyday life, the universe, and in the minds of religious mystics, the great beyond.
I:74779;372;An outstanding film but when will someone think of releasing the soundtrack?
I:74779;373;com!I have just bought the Requiem for a Dream soundtrack and I'm in awe!
I:74779;374;Frankly, I think Amazon Prime is one of the best ways to catch flicks that you've heard so much about.
I:74779;375;Visually it was quite stunning.
I:74779;376;The storyline was interesting and provocative.
I:74779;377;I'm truly a movie lover and will find something worthy in every movie I've ever watched.
I:74779;378;It has alot of fascinating ideas, it just doesn't know what to do with any of them.
I:74779;379;What is so astonishing is that these ideas which the movie barely scratches the surface of, the depth of GO, the Fibonnaci series, are so rich as to be wide open to he possiblity of a really great story.
I:74779;380;This movie is powerfully and beautifully subversive.
I:74779;381;this movie is powerfully, joyously, triumphantly unsettling and subversive, becuase it reveals the emperor that has no clothes in many of the philosphical questions we ask routinely of ourselves.
I:74779;382;What is the relevance of religion in a post.
I:74779;383;What can ancient history teach us about the modern present.
I:74779;384;But logical, simple yet scientific questions about the innate structure of reality.
I:74779;385;the implications of a world that is really all just levels of energy and their unifying, harmonic relationships to human consciousness and being.
I:74779;386;right down to how we define and express the very concepts (like love, happiness, freedom, enlightenment, reality and yes, GOD) that form the basis of our everyday lives.
I:74779;387;And what do we do if it IS in the Bible and Torah and the architecture of the Pyramids as much as it is in nature?The movie PI takes this fundamental theme/question of our modern world.
I:74779;388;Let's talk about order vs. chaos, and the proof of both that helps declare the other an illusion.
I:74779;389;to the human mind, and the human heart, considering how virutally anything else we talk about in life is a metaphor for one or the other anyway.
I:74779;390;"The acting is done very well
I:74779;391;It gets into the mind of a man who is erasing that fine, ever.
I:74779;392;erased line spearating genius from insanity as enlightenment approaches.
I:74779;393;This is an important film, however, because of how deeply it moves you.
I:74779;394;I put it on par with THE MATRIX as one of the most important science myth films (as opposed to science fiction films) to be made this past decade.
I:74779;395;"Certainly much more original and engaging than Aranofsky's subsequent ""Requiem for a Dream."
I:74779;396;aranofsky's camera and visual style is ideal for the subject matter at hand: he takes us inside the mind and daily experience of an isolated, obsessive.
I:74779;397;worth several watches, maybe with a fair amount of slow.
I:74779;398;mo to capture much of the light.
I:74779;399;Pi is about a very bright, but still very paranoid genius who belives he's about to crack the code of the universe.
I:74779;400;the movie brings up all kinds of very perfound thoughts and ideas to anyones mind.
I:74779;401;So I can add a few points for the newcomer to the film, and perhaps answer queries about the movie itself.
I:74779;402;That's right: he discovers God.
I:74779;403;it is very, very clever of the makers never to show the audience this number.
I:74779;404;in the stunning, noir thriller, the mathematician is pursued by a silly girl who really likes him, by the government who really wants his work (the men in black pursue him, but it is a black lady!)
I:74779;405;They are the most interesting, for they have revealed to the mathematician that he has found God.
I:74779;406;I think the actor Gulette is very sexy in this film.
I:74779;407;A few shots of him are quite sexual and provocative, and I wonder to this day why that was done.
I:74779;408;A very revealing shot of him sitting in a chair finds the camera nestled neatly in his crotch.
I:74779;409;"this film is unforgettable
I:74779;410;I love this film with a finality that is rarely given, and so will you.
I:74779;411;The acting was really good, which is a plus.
I:74779;412;You should definitely agree that it's one of those great movies at a very low price.
I:74779;413;d this film will meet your expectations.
I:74779;414;The filming technique is just as important as the theme/message in this film.
I:74779;415;tangled into the intense emotional experience and questions of what it all means.
I:74779;416;Max has been working on a computer program to discover an answer to a very important formula.
I:74779;417;The chase is on and there lies the mystery of the film .
I:74779;418;This film will appeal to a highly discriminating group of people who initially like the basic themes set forth in the first sentence of this review.
I:74779;419;It simply uses mathematics as a vehicle by which to deliver a plot.
I:74779;420;I personally loved this movie.
I:74779;421;The masses eat it up.
I:74779;422;I commend Aronofsky for his work.
I:74779;423;Between this and Requiem, he is definately one of the few bright hopes we have for director's with an artistic sense, and the ability to disturb.
I:74779;424;mainstream cinema, and cerebral stimuli.
I:74779;425;But this movie really makes you wonder about what fixation for something can do to you.
I:74779;426;It also depicts a little bit how a genius' mind seem to work.
I:74779;427;Your guess is as good as mine.
I:74779;428;This is a sixth grade creative writing story set to celluloid.
I:74779;429;About the only thing I liked was the opening title sequence.
I:74779;430;The music, sort of new wave techno promises a fresh new story, it lied.
I:74779;431;Examples: swirls, mark on head, THE STOCK MARKET!
I:74779;432;Put a little time into it next time, or is this really the best you can do?
I:74779;433;hollywood is sufficient to gain instant respect.
I:74779;434;See it if you must, but don't say I didn't warn you.
I:74779;435;Interesting for a while, but the repetition of the images and sounds finally turned me off .
I:74779;436;But hold on, there's more to the story.
I:74779;437;No one really knows what it is.
I:74779;438;the real insanity comes from just knowing that the code exsists.
I:74779;439;It also features some great computer filtering processes and editing.
I:74779;440;hollywood (and all the better for it, regardless of what any other reviews say), it takes the viewer through a certain set of motions in a certain sequence to achieve a certain effect.
I:74779;441;There are a few things that in the case of PI, absolutely PRECEDE the content of the storyline.
I:74779;442;Think of it as looking into a moving Kandinsky.
I:74779;443;The best of the best on this service cheerio!
I:74779;444;I've seen a lot of reviews of this director and of this film.
I:74779;445;If you are a fan of sci.
I:74779;446;Basically a story of a man driven insane by his obsession, in this case solving the secret of the stock.
I:74779;447;Visually gritty, the black and white can shock you at times and really creates some great emotional ties into the story.
I:74779;448;I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys story over visual effects.
I:74779;449;"The movie ""Pi"" is the journey of a mind on a quest, one that is a naturally driven human endeavor to find those secrets of life's many meanings."
I:74779;450;Pi seems to have a pre.
I:74779;451;The depth of looking for those subtle patterns in nature, can be disruptive to the psychological.
I:74779;452;dynamics of the working mind.
I:74779;453;"In other words
I:74779;454;The subject of a God, that always was and always will be, is a good topic to attain this state of tripped breakers.
I:74779;455;kudos for an excellent job of weaving this journey together with those subtle paranoias, that accompany such a mental state as 'Tripped Breakers'.
I:74779;456;i was looking for this movie, good thing amazon prime offered it for free, so I could finally watch.
I:74779;457;has some grand premise building up but ending up going no where.
I:74779;458;Now, that is a pure 9th grade science fiction from best of my computer knowelege.
I:74779;459;also refreshing to see a black and white movie in this day of it's only good if it's in color.
I:74779;460;It is a watchable movie for a techie.
I:74779;461;Kind of hard to follow and understand the story.
I:74779;462;Take a journey through a mind on overload.
I:74779;463;However, the intrigue is the main character who reveals to us, the potential power of discovering the numerical constant's in life and it's impact on his emotional well being.
I:74779;464;I realize for most, the end is satisfactory.
I:74779;465;I like the high contrast black and white cinematography and the lightning speed flashes of scenery.
I:74779;466;This movie visually appeals to the alternative, gritty side.
I:74779;467;Interesting movie about a man possessed about being a genius and wanted to rid himself of the burden.
I:74779;468;Need to watch it more then one time to take it all in!
I:74779;469;This movie is disturbing, yet it is a classic because it is powerful.
I:74779;470;kabbalists, Occultists, thinkers, and philosophers will dig this one.
I:74779;471;I am still not sure how to evaluate the main character of the movie, but it makes people think so I recommend it.
I:74779;472;this all said, Darren Aronofsky is clearly a very talented director.
I:74779;473;"His use of the black&white
I:74779;474;it certainly helped one get into Cohen's mind.
I:74779;475;it is interesting to note Aronofsky's use of some of the effects that he would later use in Requiem for a Dream, especially the fast.
I:74779;476;popping sequence which was always worth a chuckle in both movies (in a dark sort of way).
I:74779;477;The best thing about this movie is the name.
I:74779;478;entertainment, meaningful social commentary, even socially redeeming.
I:74779;479;super fun ideas that keep your brain thinking for a few days afterwards.
I:74779;480;after seeing so many positive reviews of the movie pi, I bought it, I thought it is just like the ones I mentioned above and was very looking forward to seeing it.
I:74779;481;Cube uses a lot of basic mathematical theories, too, and the storyline is even simpler than pi (a bunch of people trying to get out of a cube), but it is so well directed that it made the movie look extremely smart and keeps the audience interested at all times.
I:74779;482;i think this film is absolutely for people that like movies with weird events, events that they dont understand regardless of its true meaning, or if there really is one.
I:74779;483;Very quick service at a great price.
I:74779;484;"I must really commend the guys who put ""Pi"" together in that the subject matter is quite interesting."
I:74779;485;concious artschool style film instead of focusing upon telling a story.
I:74779;486;I enjoyed the film best when it was telling a story, especially without the use of special effects.
I:74779;487;still, it is an interesting film to see.
I:74779;488;and please, at the moment to watch Matrix again, establish by yourself the countless dramatic resemblances.
I:74779;489;I got this thinking wow the movie about the kid and tiger!!
I:74779;490;(Being an Amazon Prime subscriber helped wit the cost.
I:74779;491;To say the least is was entertaining.
I:74779;492;I am a fan of David Lynch as well as Jean Cocteau.
I:74779;493;Pi is simply brilliant and unique in its own way.
I:74779;494;The photography / cinematography is simply wonderful.
I:74779;495;For anyone nonplussed after seeing Pi then, watch it again and again.
I:74779;496;This film is based on a concept that has potential .
I:74779;497;the most interesting passage is when the young Rabi explain the concept of Hebrew words and numbers.
I:74779;498;I found it catchy and appealing.
I:74779;499;As I said, it was a nice try, but at least I did no hate it.
I:74779;500;The dialogue, especially Cohen's internal, was interesting.
I:74779;501;"Number theory was backed intelligently: Personal note
I:74779;502;The soundtrack definitely worked perfectly, and, in my opinion, was the greatest asset of this piece.
I:74779;503;Maybe it's because I can relate to this character's flight in and out of madness or maybe it's because this is just an amazing film but either way, it is definitely number one on my top 10 list.
I:74779;504;All with a unique style and brilliant vision.
I:74779;505;All of Max's paranoid searches culminate in a single moment of crystal clarity that defies the imagination.
I:74779;506;For those who can keep an open mind, the movie will be more enjoyable.
I:74779;507;genius figuring out the number that decodes the entirety meaning of the world.
I:74779;508;A number so powerful it will drive you insane (not 23).
I:74779;509;A classic for unconventional cinema!
I:74779;510;"The Golden Rectangle is art history/architecture 101, absolutely necessary for understanding proportion and geometry
I:74779;511;perhaps it is because of my ignorance that I am prey to movies such as this: the idea of mysticism, science, and reason coming together is one that fascinates me.
I:74779;512;"Knowledge without wisdom, tools for personal gain
I:74779;513;i enjoyed this movie: I thought the grainy, black and white images, the insect symbolism (related to the Jewish idea that G. d is too vast, too unknowable, too infinite to perceive from our lowly mortal position), the pulsating soundtrack (not unlike the 'music of the spheres'), all contributed to a sense of mounting claustrophobic madness and the push of the unknown.
I:74779;514;a wildly eccentric ride through theories and infinity.
I:74779;515;I really loved this movie.
I:74779;516;it will keep you thinking way after watching it.
I:74779;517;And, true to all really effective films, we're left to fill in the gaps, and form our own interpretation regarding the possibility of a link between the stockmarket, mathematics and religion*
I:74779;518;A strange black and white movie about a mathematician who believes everything in nature is mathematical and patternable, including the Stock Exchange.
I:74779;519;The result is explosive and of course proves what is supposed to be proved, viz. the vanity of mathematics and mathematicians.
I:74779;520;A film that is interesting only to those who have a certain amount of scientific and technological orientation.
I:74779;521;It may have been a good movie but I hear talkies are the new thing.
I:74779;522;It was very well done, excellent visual effects and the actors were superb.
I:74779;523;A (insert one) funny, dramatic, action packed, exotic, futuristic, fantastical slice of life, a recording of what everyone already knows?
I:74779;524;I'll always vote for the latter.
I:74779;525;In fact this film reminds me of the '50s New York improv school of film.
I:74779;526;a perfect stage for the deep thinker looking to unhide a secret of the universe.
I:74779;527;In spite of the hokey math and computer stuff, I found the story and acting riveting and inspiring.
I:74779;528;The chaos grows increasingly intense both visually and mentally.
I:74779;529;Looking for the structure of a thing,the theory, the pattern, is something that fascinates me.
I:74779;530;It is part of the work I do.
I:74779;531;This film is therefore very appealing to me.
I:74779;532;All seek an explanation, born out of Wonder.
I:74779;533;This film is a wonderful examination of our shared obsession of Seeking.
I:74779;534;It explores both the depth of mind and the limitation of Mind.
I:74779;535;It is as engrossing and compelling a film as any I've ever seen.
I:74779;536;It deserves (and requiries) more than one viewing.
I:74779;537;screen, but region 1 has more features and is my favorite.
I:74779;538;I took a flyer on this film having seen the good reviews.
I:74779;539;I like finding good movies from small studios and I liked this film.
I:74779;540;It is a little ham handed at times but its a compelling story with decent acting and pretty good directing.
I:74779;541;I thought Pi was a great movie and everybody that suffers migraines should watch it.
I:74779;542;Excellent mix of mysticism, numerology, and science fiction.
I:74779;543;Pi is an incredible film to which I give the highest marks.
I:74779;544;Pi,shot on a tiny budget on 16mm is a great indie movie.
I:74779;545;great central performance!The director has gone on to make the more polished and better cast movie, Requiem for a Dream but I think this one is way way better because its more grittier, raw and honest.
I:74779;546;This chaotic, tense movie, shot in stark black and white, is sure to be a cult favorite.
I:74779;547;Max had a thread of a connection to the great infinite divine, that which human beings are not wired to see.
I:74779;548;It's the classic Iccarus story, except that Max survives and finds happiness at the end.
I:74779;549;it is the cumulation of every frame of the film.
I:74779;550;A Beautiful Mind put a lot of effort into putting real math into the plot, and I like that.
I:74779;551;Darren kind of painted himself into a corner there.
I:74779;552;"This extraordinary (as in ""black"" and ""white"") film is called Pi because it represents geometric value."
I:74779;553;the concept is totally appropriate and masterfully done.
I:74779;554;In alchemical terms it is the search for the fabled Philosopher's Stone that can turn base metal into gold.
I:74779;555;Historically The Great Work has also played a role in magick ritual.
I:74779;556;"such is the background of ""The Work"" in a very capsulated overview."
I:74779;557;This is obviously a materialistic interpretation of The Work.
I:74779;558;the film is remarkable in its stark, often grainy blend of black and white images, brought together in a surrealist/existentialist cauldron that borders on madness itself.
I:74779;559;There are very few actors in the movie, but their performances are deftly displayed by expert direction.
I:74779;560;this is an extremely visceral film and brutal in its examination of the political and religious exploitation of The Work.
I:74779;561;Their goal is to enter the mind of god, to control the elemental power of creation.
I:74779;562;Honey, we're going to have to live behind walls.
I:74779;563;Perhaps Kramer actually believed that he had stumbled upon an astounding breakthrough.
I:74779;564;That leads me to think that, if he is still alive and simply in hiding, he will eventually resurface and perhaps try to either start a laboratory of his own to developed his breakthrough else find a laboratory he feels he can trust and sign on with them.
I:74779;565;Perhaps he found the Key to The Work in music and advanced technology.
I:74779;566;it's interesting how when you start to focus on a subject.
I:74779;567;Finally, an unexpected gem just at the right time.
I:74779;568;"The pain of obsession and discovery was enhanced by the high contrast, stark black and white film and by Max moving in and out of ""surreality""."
I:74779;569;Like all great minds, he was being watched by others who wanted what they thought he was about to discover for political power and religious purposes.
I:74779;570;Better to step back a bit and open your heart and eyes and ears.
I:74779;571;Instead, it is a trip into the mind of an anti.
I:74779;572;white, the film is an outstanding portrait of paranoia and how one can actually theorize himself out of existence.
I:74779;573;Its a film that shakes you up, that leaves you feeling like you've been up for five days straight on speed.
I:74779;574;Not quite the masterpiece as the director's next film, the more cohesive Requiem for a Dream, Pi is still an amazing experiment that sticks with you a lot longer than you might want.
I:74779;575;I have been enjoying PI for the past couple of years a couple of times a week, recently i saw Requim and it was also wonderful 5 stars on it too.
I:74779;576;"think about this: after having watched the movie, you can see that only Max was able to understand the number because he could see 'between' the numbers
I:74779;577;If you're into the Golden Ratio and how numbers are the universal language then this film is for you.
I:74779;578;This movie was recommended by a priest friend of a friend.
I:74779;579;Pi is one of the most creative, disturbing and introspective movies ever released.
I:74779;580;It's hauntingly real, traumatic, and artistic.
I:74779;581;I had never even heard of this movie, made some time ago, but it kept me riveted through the whole film.
I:74779;582;I like movies that I can relate to and have a more pleasant ending.
I:74779;583;Pi is the kind of independent film that both encourages aspiring filmmakers and discourages them.
I:74779;584;It encourages them, because they can see that it is possible to make an incredible movie and break into the film industry with 60 grand.
I:74779;585;You will be amazed at how incredible this movie really is.
I:74779;586;PI is the best movie i've ever seen.
I:74779;587;hyped movies, PI holds its ground in a way that too many consumers overlook.
I:74779;588;"i think the movie ""A Beautiful Mind"" explored the same theme but in an enlightening way."
I:74779;589;In Pi one encounters a film that is undeniably original.
I:74779;590;On the one hand, this is an intriguingly shot, genuinely original film.
I:74779;591;I happen to like it when books or movies do this, but that's more of a personality trait than the hallmark of a great artist.
I:74779;592;"In the end, ""Pi"" is a pleasant diversion from many of the mundane films being made today, and it will certainly leave you thinking."
I:74779;593;"On a related note, if you enjoyed this film, or are intrigued by it's premise, you might enjoy the novel ""Damascus Gate"" by Robert Stone, as it explores similar issues."
I:74779;594;I did not really enjoy it and idi not even finish watching.
I:74779;595;I was looking forward to seeing Pi after experiencing Requiem for a Dream, one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:74779;596;This movie reminded me of a cross between an old one I saw ages ago called Eraser Head, Russel Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, the Number 23 with Jim Carey and Nicolas Cage in Knowing.
I:74779;597;d This is one of those movies you may watch once and never again.
I:74779;598;I bought this after seeing it at the movies.
I:74779;599;The soundtrack is kind of catchy, which is half the reason I got into it.
I:74779;600;I am sure there is a set of cinema critics that loved it, but for me it is all about escaping and enjoying.
I:74779;601;There's also some corporate entity after Max's secrets as well.
I:74779;602;But some people (like me) enjoy that in a movie.
I:74779;603;The whole megillah is brilliantly shot in grainy black and white and backed with a spare, disturbing score by Clint Mansell.
I:74779;604;Gullette pretty much carries the entire film, with the help of an excellent but very small additional cast.
I:74779;605;This film is beautifully done from the cinematography to the compelling character portrayal of a calculative, paranoid sociopath on the verge of understanding our universe.
I:74779;606;The movie seems to be a little bit strange at the beginning but once you watch the first 10 minutes you will be surprised with the end of the movie at the drop of a hat.
I:74779;607;This movie is confusing and very good if understood fully.
I:74779;608;i feel that this number is infinite, that is why the end of the movie is the way it is.
I:74779;609;An excellent film that you will need to see it few times to catch some clues.
I:74779;610;This movie gives me chills.
I:74779;611;Max is symbolic of this, in that he is seeking order, while heading on a path to pure personal chaos, insanity.
I:74779;612;the film weaves interesting black and white cinematography, a pulsating soundtrack, and an excellent acting performance by Sean Gullette as Max, into a film which does make a viewer at least contemplate some pretty important things.
I:74779;613;savvy esoteric minded, this movie is the answer.
I:74779;614;Regardless of what other's say, I myself am madly in love with the indie film industry, and I think that PI is absolutly wonderful.
I:74779;615;My friend Angela and I watch it at least once a week, and every time I find something else to ponder.
I:74779;616;this movie was very well put together, and certainly is a refreshing turn from typical holleywood garbage.
I:74779;617;This movie, Pi, belongs in that second category.
I:74779;618;And even at the level of its finest.
I:74779;619;Pi is such a movie.
I:74779;620;See it as though your life depended upon it.
I:74779;621;if you have a scientific background, you'll identify Fibonacci sequence, pi, chaos, computer algorithms, scientific challenges, and so on.
I:74779;622;I gave this one five stars because it was so imaginative.
I:74779;623;I like it quite a bit though.
I:74779;624;It's a great concept, and it's a very tense movie.
I:74779;625;Yes math is a language of universe and you can see it in everything you look at!
I:74779;626;In all honesty this movie actually has the ability to drive a sane person out of their mind.
I:74779;627;It's creative and takes math to a whole new level.
I:74779;628;It's always interesting to explore these ideas.
I:74779;629;I watched this movie once, and then watched it close to three more times before i finally understood everything that was going on, but honestly i think it was well worth it.
I:74779;630;The acting is top notch, and on top of all that, the direction is superb.
I:74779;631;It is not one you watch over and over again, and comment on the great enjoyment that comes with it.
I:74779;632;be film makers with it's success, and the success of other low budget films like it.
I:74779;633;i thought it had a great plot, and was a big fan of the cut in mathematical symbols and writing.
I:74779;634;The sound track was also excellent and thrilling, and the contrast of black and white also proved a success.
I:74779;635;i didn't 'like' or 'enjoy' it, but I think it is a worthwhile and haunting film to watch, and would recommend it to most.
I:74779;636;I liked it and it kept me interested until the end.
I:74779;637;It's a great movie for further discussion with friends.
I:74779;638;I'm not sure if I liked this film because of Calculus of Disbelief's review or because the film really was that good, but I did get a lot out of it.
I:74779;639;There were what seems some awfully smart parts of this film but then I started to question it since I do have issues with the way television effects our daily lives rather than as once thought that it keeps us out of trouble, which I think it can if viewed with that in mind.
I:74779;640;perhaps one of the most disturbing films I have ever viewed.
I:74779;641;i liked how it was shot, in 16mm black and white film, giving it an 'indie' approach, and due to its opaque themes and colours, making the movie a lot more disquieting.
I:74779;642;this movie is proof that emotions count more than intelligence.
I:74779;643;Pi (1998) was another great five star film about a paranoid but brilliant scientist who has a preoccupation with numbers.
I:74779;644;The film featured some great photography using enhanced contrast film stock, neat shots of multi.
I:74779;645;ethnick lower Manhattan and New York's fameous subway system with lots of atmosphere, and a really interesting plot guaranteed to drive you insaneA nice, even charming side feature of the film occurs when Max is approached by a very friendly but odd person who asks him if he is Jewish.
I:74779;646;I think you will like this film as it has many subtle touches.
I:74779;647;I also enjoyed the opening graphics which looked like they were taken from some advanced work in mathematics.
I:74779;648;This film was really well done and deserved a full five stars.
I:74779;649;"Pi as an Allegorical Explanation of LifeAs a film concerned with the explanations of life's inner sanctums, its reason for existing, and man's role within its borders, ""Pi"" unravels nebulous borders, conveying within its galley the allegories, mystic bridges, and religious underpinnings which score our senses, while successfully opening our eyes to unrealized passions."
I:74779;650;secured parallels the questions still unanswered, yet closer to our minds, in a film considered a genius epic, undertaken within a maelstrom of mistrust and self.
I:74779;651;upon viewing, one can plainly see the self.
I:74779;652;structure contemporary life in a self.
I:74779;653;only with a scrutinized vision can one interpret the film's depth and care for analysis and retribution toward self.
I:74779;654;The making of a classic film, told through symbolism and stretching the peripherals of our own boundaries can be clearly identified upon its viewing.
I:74779;655;Its beauty, horror, and self.
I:74779;656;"The progress established through its parables and the questions raised through its visions are why ""Pi"" should be considered a select film, best reserved for those seeking honesty and the hidden structure of the smallest pebble on Earth, while still bowing before the graces from beyond."
I:74779;657;Pi was, is, and always will be, a movie not meant for the masses.
I:74779;658;the soundtrack is wonderful, and creates a sense of eerie unreality.
I:74779;659;I liked the music score with the cinematography.
I:74779;660;the composer did a good job.
I:74779;661;Pi is director Darren Aronofsky's first movie, shot in grainy black.
I:74779;662;He has intense headaches and is heavily self.
I:74779;663;"The film has some beautiful imagery, and some disturbing images, such as an exposed brain, reminiscent of ""Eraserhead""."
I:74779;664;This is a good companion.
I:74779;665;"budget film, ""Requiem For a Dream"", which is also powerful and recommended."
I:74779;666;This is a must see for Indy film fans and movie fans alike.
I:74779;667;Some of the acting is good, and the main idea under the plot is very good.
I:74779;668;What's more, a few pieces of the cinematography are extremely well done.
I:74779;669;Clint Mansell's score is amazing.
I:74779;670;After Pi, his first film, Mansell got a flood work afterward.
I:74779;671;all in all, a good effort, but not, in my opinion, worth quite the level of accolades other reviewers have given it
I:74779;672;I read great reviews and was excited to see it.
I:74779;673;Recommend it for thrill seekers.
I:74779;674;Climax part is the part and liked the way director handled the scenes.
I:74779;675;I bought this movie as a gift for my brother, and, insofar as I know him to really like this movie, I'd say it made a great gift.
I:74779;676;watcher, and this is one of his favorites.
I:74779;677;Alone in his darkened, multi.
I:74779;678;I highly recommend this Sundance 98 Award for Dramatic Directing winner to anyone interested in computing, science fiction, Wall Street, the game GO , or math.
I:74779;679;Mark Margolis in the role of Sol was perfect casting.
I:74779;680;it is a Fibonacci sequence.
I:74779;681;After two days, he escaped and high.
I:74779;682;the black and white jumpy scenes augmented the storyline and strong acting.
I:74779;683;I know, I know, some of you enjoy being left with a million questions that make you ponder life, the way people think, and what does it all mean???
I:74779;684;I got this movie a while ago and never got around to really watching it.
I:74779;685;Numbers go flying by in an amazing opening scene not drawn out but will give you a good feel of whats ahead.
I:74779;686;the movie takes you through a short period of life of a paranoid genius on the edge of complete insanity.
I:74779;687;You can't always tell what is going on but it really adds to the movie as a whole.
I:74779;688;The camera works is amazingly creative.
I:74779;689;The angles and shots used are phenominal and make you feel like you are inside his mind.
I:74779;690;And I was right, after later review.
I:74779;691;The cinematography is very unique at the beginning, and I fully get it, but it could switch it off (won't tell more, to not give anything away) 10.15 minutes in.
I:74779;692;Its one of my favorite movies of all times, not everyones cup of tea though.
I:74779;693;One of those movies you can watch over and over.
I:74779;694;The character was nerve wracking and the film in black and white made it stark and surreal.
I:74779;695;something young filmmaker, it was shot it black and white on a shoestring budget and has achieved much recognition in the world of independent film.
I:74779;696;He's skinny, balding and manages to make the audience wonder if he is a misunderstood genius or mentally ill nutjob who's constantly popping medications and injecting himself with various substances just to keep sane.
I:74779;697;He's a sympathetic character and it is a tribute to his fine acting that it was possible for me to identify with him.
I:74779;698;Before I knew it, I was drawn into the story which included some chase scenes through the New York subway system.
I:74779;699;But its an inspired showcase for raw talent in writing, directing and acting.
I:74779;700;Therefore I give it a high recommendation.
I:74779;701;This one makes the top ten favorite of all time.
I:74779;702;A crasy movie, takes a crasy mind to undestand.
I:74779;703;Watch this movie, if you can handle it!!!
I:74779;704;Watching movies is something I do for entertainment.
I:74779;705;They see the creativity behind the chaos.
I:74779;706;I saw a review of this here that said a prerequisite in high math is essential for viewing this film.
I:74779;707;it's artistic, thought provoking, clever, suspenseful and is accompanied by a very fine soundtrack with Clint Mansell, Massive Attack, Orbital all helping you relive what it must have been like to be Max.
I:74779;708;the true name of GOD.
I:74779;709;This movie was spectacular and one of those rare gems.
I:74779;710;It will have you guessing the outcome, as well as keep you guessing about life after you watch it.
I:74779;711;core (pure) mathematics will find this film a real treat.
I:74779;712;It has a great plot and story line too!
I:74779;713;Not sure if it is the amazing way the director depicts migraines or the inner math geek, but I just love this odd ball movie.
I:74779;714;Not a great date night movie but for sure an interesting way to spend an hour not thinking about anything else.
I:74779;715;pack with Requiem for a Dream{a very good film},.
I:74779;716;The prospect of a 216 digit number being the key to the universe is fascinating and for my money, they could have gone into greater back story about that, and less of the main character's slow meltdown trying to gain knowledge of it.
I:74779;717;A PBS style documentary would be great!
I:74779;718;Anyway, this moving was still entertaining, even though the style of it has been repeated enough now that it's not quite as interesting as it might've been.
I:74779;719;the shot where the main character is in the white light reminded me of Neo meeting the Matrix creator, .
I:74779;720;A Wonderful movie which illustrates that which usually occurs .
I:74779;721;There is much wonderful Kabbalistic symbolism in this movie and it is cleverly done
I:74779;722;Hello I have watched this movie many times, and I have enjoyed it the story.
I:74779;723;mmmmm, and besides, simply the story is great.
I:74779;724;It is a remarkable surprise that, in a time of science fiction and fantasy films which continually strive do outdo each other in pyrotechnics, one of the best science fiction films I've seen is a little black and white masterpiece that was shot with a $60,000 budget.
I:74779;725;Darren Aronofsky, writer and director of 'PI', has created a film that is every bit as engaging as its 'big' brothers .
I:74779;726;cohen's investigation takes him far beyond the gyrations of the stock market into the mystical Kaballah and an intense questioning of the basic nature of reality.
I:74779;727;He is drawn step by step into the irrevocable gap between the sacred and the mundane.
I:74779;728;this film satisfies on many levels, starting with a question, finding an answer, and then discovering the next question.
I:74779;729;Film director Matthew Libatique proves himself a genius, and Matthew Maraffi's production design is amazing.
I:74779;730;Euclid is created out of scrap and loose parts, but manages to take on a full life of its own.
I:74779;731;The acting is simply perfect.
I:74779;732;This is a film for late night coffee house conversations, appealing to both the paranoid and the believer.
I:74779;733;Movie is at best, odd.
I:74779;734;buttered would be best for this flick.
I:74779;735;Plot is simple but clever and the photography is delightfully artistic.
I:74779;736;There were others, whose names I can't remember, that also did a good job.
I:74779;737;The man who portrayed Max's mentor was a good choice, and I felt he gave the movie more of a depth than it might have otherwise had.
I:74779;738;This movie presents you with an ending, but then right after that, it presents you with another one, not really leaving you knowing where you are.
I:74779;739;Darren Aronofsky was rewarded with a big budget (Requiem for a Dream) after making this incredibly innovative film.
I:74779;740;But it is also very gripping and interesting.
I:74779;741;But I can say that it's about a genius schizophrenic scientist who loves numerical patterns, and he searches for the numerical pattern that created the universe, which develops into an earth.
I:74779;742;The music is eerie and excellent for the complex scenario.
I:74779;743;rated R, for bizarre and disturbing images, and for language.
I:74779;744;The atmosphere is also very intense.
I:74779;745;This film struck a chord with me, because I actually studied the history of the Jewish Kabalah.
I:74779;746;this is definitely a film which should appeal to those of us who were raised on spy dramas which focused on codebreaking.
I:74779;747;very thought provoking and great for a low budget film.
I:74779;748;Other than that, the beginning and middle was interesting and holds a certain promise for better things to come.
I:74779;749;It's often said that movies are an art form, and I really believe it's true.
I:74779;750;Movies are a driving force in entertainment.
I:74779;751;Others really entertain us, yet we rarely consider the art of how these were done.
I:74779;752;In fact, it takes a genius to work successfully on such a large canvas.
I:74779;753;These are works by talented filmmakers who, so far, have limited reputations and even less money.
I:74779;754;pi, the story of brilliant mathematician whose work drives him to insanity, succeeds brilliantly.
I:74779;755;industrial music by Clint Marsel is a rare example of a film's score being an integral part of the plot.
I:74779;756;This music, along with tight editing and good acting, causes some scenes to become so intense that you almost feel what the main character is feeling.
I:74779;757;For anyone with a sense of high, high, HIGH concept and scientific/spiritual adventure, however, this film is one of the finest I've ever seen.
I:74779;758;The dark, edgy cinematography is unusual and atmospherically appropriate, the acting is very good, the music sets the post.
I:74779;759;And like any good film that aspires to the level of art, it has inspired deeply divergent and often passionate reactions from those who see it.
I:74779;760;a sort of warped cross between Good Will Hunting, Eraserhead and Jacob's Ladder, Pi manages to capture in under two hours the sort of deep, paranoid, multi.
I:74779;761;tortuous and requiring solid attention, but discernable and beyond clever.
I:74779;762;Granted, after viewing the film with friends, we had a discussion that proved my take on the plot merely an interpretation, not a definitive treatise.
I:74779;763;But any film that can inspire the kind of reactions that Pi has and still remain open to multiple interpretations deserves a special place in Hollywood: that all.
I:74779;764;It is very artistic, painful, frustrating, and beautiful.
I:74779;765;I love this movie, and it is a wonderful precursor to Requiem for a Dream .
I:74779;766;It is often said that with genius sometimes comes madness.
I:74779;767;He is a secluded mathematical genius on the verge of a profound discovery.
I:74779;768;everything in the physical world can be understood in terms of mathematics is an enticing one.
I:74779;769;"the style of the film is compelling and unique
I:74779;770;and the world in which Aranofsky has created for us on screen is immersive.
I:74779;771;It is an amazing debut for this young director, and nothing short of a great film.
I:74779;772;"If you are into Philosophy, Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, and all the other fields that are be related to cognition, knowledge and the being
I:74779;773;treat it as fantasy or a drama about mental disorders, not about some pseudo.
I:74779;774;Because then the math is more important than the man.
I:74779;775;A 216 digit number with infinite power.
I:74779;776;If you like math, science, or just eerie suspense thrillers, see this movie!
I:74779;777;No actually it's freaking great!
I:74779;778;It's a classic in my book.
I:74779;779;the end of the film makes it all worthwhile.
I:74779;780;Pi is an outstanding and complex thriller with brains and structure.
I:74779;781;For such a low budget film, this great movie shows you that greatness doesn't have to only come out of big budget films with well.
I:74779;782;It is a film that gets in your head and stays with you long after it is over.
I:74779;783;this dark and quiet thriller is about Maximilian Cohen, a brilliant mathematician who believes that everything in life revolves around patterns and numbers.
I:74779;784;The twists and complexity will leave you in awe.
I:74779;785;while this movie may be confusing at times, it still does its job and keeps us intrigued throughout the duration of the film.
I:74779;786;The acting and writing is really remarkable.
I:74779;787;Sean Gullette is very convincing as Max.
I:74779;788;Everybody else was also great in it as well.
I:74779;789;"The film is also a debut from Darren Aronofsky
I:74779;790;Very well written and directed.
I:74779;791;Some of the camera techniques are really great and allow you to get inside of the main character's head.
I:74779;792;The sound is really great too.
I:74779;793;It's a film that will mostly appeal to those who like quiet and unique thrillers.
I:74779;794;This is a quirky movie with a very interesting plot.
I:74779;795;I enjoyed it very much and have recommended it to several friends.
I:74779;796;It's plotline is absolutely unique and it may cause you to think a little bit after seeing it.
I:74779;797;"When I used those two words to describe the movie, he said, ""oh great, I've never seen an Indian science fiction movie!"
I:74779;798;the stark black and white film further delineates Pi's either/or approach.
I:74779;799;It uses artistic license to make its point .
I:74779;800;that the nature of God is beyond human ken .
I:74779;801;and ultimately beats the viewer over the head with it in the end.
I:74779;802;Pi was this mysterious movie that played for a short time at a local movie theater.
I:74779;803;that explanation is perfectly suited for this film.
I:74779;804;Entering the mind of a schizophrenic madman/mathematic genius was exhilarating.
I:74779;805;I am an avid movie fan.
I:74779;806;as if it was filmed, written and performed by a teenager in their garage.
I:74779;807;Worth the 90 minutes or so, but overall a bit strange and not really that entertaining.
I:74779;808;I had heard a lot of really good things about this movie.
I:74779;809;", and It's unique and makes you think
I:74779;810;I barely found the characters interesting.
I:74779;811;Maybe it really was entertaining.
I:74779;812;It is one of the most evocotive, intense stories I've seen in quite a long time.
I:74779;813;it becomes a cool X. files type story, but deviates from what I thought was going to be a movie strictly about the psychological breakdown of a man obsessed, which would have made for just an equally engaging film!
I:74779;814;Still, this flick is top notch!
I:74779;815;What we're really watching is a portrayal of obsession.
I:74779;816;Much of the stuff here is pretty gruesome.
I:74779;817;Gullette does a fine job detailing Max, showing his angst and torment quite clearly.
I:74779;818;Thankfully there is some humour injected into this otherwise dark tale in other places.
I:74779;819;aronofsky, who is a proficient visual stylist, gets his first chance to shine here.
I:74779;820;One particularly stylish device uses manic quick cuts to portray the rhythm and the ritual of Max taking his headache medicine.
I:74779;821;It was overbearing when used in Requiem , but fits in nicely here.
I:74779;822;Complexity is between us and the truth, plauging humanity.
I:74779;823;Pi is an awesome movie.
I:74779;824;It's in black and white, which is cool.
I:74779;825;It is dark and seedy, and makes you feel uncomfortable, which is perfect.
I:74779;826;I give it five stars because I honestly enjoyed it.
I:74779;827;The situations in the film were not cleanly beautiful.
I:74779;828;modern contrast to the stark Black White 16mm images that were going to be on the screen.
I:74779;829;The story proved to be interesting and thought provoking even outside of the actual film.
I:74779;830;in giving this film 5 stars, I refer to the amazing story, superb visual effects, and the thoughts it made me wonder about afterwards.
I:74779;831;Another moving success from director Darren Aronofsky.
I:74779;832;This is a low budget film, but it is one of the top 5 of all time.
I:74779;833;"Very ""psychedelic"" and mind blowing."
I:74779;834;Great camera angles and tricks.
I:74779;835;I rated this film high even though it rubbed pretty hard against one of my pet peeves.
I:74779;836;i really enjoyed this film and I'm not sure if that speaks to the genius of the writers/directors/actors or just that I am so incredibly sick to death of the [stuff] Hollywood cranks out with alarming regularity.
I:74779;837;It is so nice to put a film in that challenges you to think a little.
I:74779;838;The closing scene is also one of those movie moments that gets burned into your consciousness.
I:74779;839;I can tell just from this movie having a $60,000 budget and as well as it does selling and viewing, Aronofsky's fans love movies that challenge the brain/mind, and he pulls it off so well in Pi.
I:74779;840;Some people complain about the black and white filming but it makes it much more interesting.
I:74779;841;I forget if they said this was based on a true story, but it was intriguing to see a genius at work with his math and computer skills but eventually you see genius turn to illness.
I:74779;842;Anyone interested in the union between madness and genius should watch this film.
I:74779;843;What is that thought you have that got interrupted.
I:74779;844;A fantastic film of a brilliant number theorist (a type of mathematician) who is driven to madness by following Icarus instead of Archimedes.
I:74779;845;Watched it first with my first husband, a mathematician, and still appreciate it today.
I:74779;846;What a flight, into the burning center of the sun.
I:74779;847;I received this movie and enjoyed it very much.
I:74779;848;Thank you for your promt and courteous response.
I:74779;849;this was an excellent film.
I:74779;850;it shows how great low budget films can be.
I:74779;851;I have seen this film several times and I have given it as a gift to many of my friends.
I:74779;852;max discovers through his study of pi, a number that is part of the fabric of the universe, that he may have found the true name of God.
I:74779;853;In almost all ancient religions, knowing the true name of a god can bring you into that god's presence and, in some cases, give you that god's powers.
I:74779;854;In the end, Max, a Cohenim, proves that he was the one destined to discover it, because he was the only one pure enough to do what was necessary to protect it.
I:74779;855;this is a wonderful, riveting film.
I:74779;856;If you ignore the presentation, Pi is actually a neat little thriller.
I:74779;857;one of the good ones.
I:74779;858;There's a groovy soundtrack featuring some Warp.
I:74779;859;It's not really high art, as such, but it's extremely well.
I:74779;860;This movie was disturbing yet captivating and entertaining.
I:74779;861;as I think, so it shall be.
I:74779;862;minded individual and love to think, viewing this film is time well.
I:74779;863;I enjoyed it because I am from NY and know China Town and many people like Max the main character.
I:74779;864;What a piece of doo doo as a movie.
I:74779;865;He is intrigued by the possibility of arriving at a fundamental insight into the universe by this discovery.
I:74779;866;For years Pi has stood out in my mind as the quintessential good inde film.
I:74779;867;Highly provocative and rewatchable, it is among my favorite movies ever made (inde or otherwise).
I:74779;868;The movie is entirely in black and white and attempts to portray an intense atmosphere of heady thought.
I:74779;869;In particular, he seems to be enamored of chaos theory (the idea that small changes in initial conditions may lead to large changes in outcome) and expresses the idea that the spiral is a universal form found in nature.
I:74779;870;It is while conducting his researches that he mysteriously finds a 216 digit number which may hold the key to the mysteries of the universe.
I:74779;871;His mentor theorizes that his computer has attained consciousness and this number is highly important in that respect.
I:74779;872;Ultimately the movie asks us to question the very nature of reality and asks us why mathematics should pose such a profound tool in our understanding of that reality.
I:74779;873;I recommend it as a strange, mind.
I:74779;874;Amoung the top 5 that I have seen.
I:74779;875;A+ I am happy to do business with them again.
I:74779;876;This is a great movie fun to see.
I:74779;877;Darren Aronofsky's brilliant debut is this black and white indie picture.
I:74779;878;Aronofsky's cinematography is remarkable, the angles and character development are also very in depth.
I:74779;879;Now see the debut that earned him top honors at Sundance.
I:74779;880;educated 15 year old that appreciated the complex esoteric message i've recieved from this film.
I:74779;881;the best acting and directing i've ever seen.
I:74779;882;please watch and enjoy this film and try not to analyze it too much, instead try to feel it.
I:74779;883;note: best when on wacky tobaccey to help induce connection.
I:74779;884;thank you for the best film i've ever seen darren aronofsky and sean gullette.
I:74779;885;you are truly masters as what you do.
I:74779;886;It felt like one of those stories that are better told in a book and don't translate we'll to film.
I:74779;887;All of our real life top geniuses were sane rational human beings.
I:74779;888;There is much more going on than meets the eye.
I:74779;889;These scenes segue into altered states with visual imagery of spinning, blinding light and unusual camera perspectives that create the illusion of looking into the sun.
I:74779;890;the paradox of Cohen's quest is the impediment his mind presents to his lofty ambition, dividing him against himself.
I:74779;891;cohen's world becomes so singularly focused that he sees everything within the context of his obsession with numbers.
I:74779;892;On a quest to become immortal, Cohen has a taste, believing he has attained an exclusive gift.
I:74779;893;the archetypal Icarus continues to soar until he melts down into a violent rampage within his apartment.
I:74779;894;aronofsky's depiction of the main character from within his mind is an unusual point of view from which the subject has been explored.
I:74779;895;Many of his techniques are artfully rendered.
I:74779;896;There is a hint of a moral at the end, as Cohen observes a mathematical prodigy and seems to have a reality check.
I:74779;897;Pi is the first of Aronofsky's films.
I:74779;898;He has directed other films of the same genre (sci.
I:74779;899;contrast, grainy monotone, Pi has a beautifully edgy feel of film noir about it, and the performances of the small cast are outstanding.
I:74779;900;the black and white film, the quick, jerky shots and quirky camera angles boost the paranoid effect, and just like the mathematical patterns in nature, the narrative recurs methodically (there's an interesting contrast between Max, who believes everything in nature .
I:74779;901;based life gives the film its rhythm.
I:74779;902;well, seem to be .
I:74779;903;which kind of means you have to be concentrating the whole time to keep up with what's going on.
I:74779;904;Pi is well enough executed and its sheer notion of rhythm and pattern (in the film as well as in nature) is interesting enough by itself to sustain the picture, so it gets a solid vote from me.
I:74779;905;The Bottom Line:Pi is so often seen as simply the film that launched Darren Aronofsky that it's important to note it's also a very well.
I:74779;906;made film about obsession that uses its low budget trappings to develop and enhance an acute feeling of claustrophobia: it may not be the easiest film to sit through, but it's a darn good one.
I:74779;907;I say this was a worthwhile movie all in all.
I:74779;908;Good points: This movie makes you want more.
I:74779;909;It's hard to enjoy this film as it is in black and white.
I:74779;910;I've no idea if Darren Aronofsky had read Shattuck's book before making this movie, nor whether Professor Shattuck has ever commented upon the film, but it perfectly illustrates the point.
I:74779;911;most importantly, he believes that we should be able to perceive and interpret the patterns, to comprehend the language, and that he is on the verge of doing so.
I:74779;912;Max however has hit an impasse, including crashing his computer, and turns to his mentor for help.
I:74779;913;So one day when I was six, I did .
I:74779;914;Some of these techniques work better than others, but all serve to give the film such an unusual look that it is very much its own distinctive world.
I:74779;915;his belief that the universe's secrets are lurking just beyond his line of sight or his chain of thought, and even more important, that he in particular has been given the capacity to finally perceive them and that when they are revealed he will be able to handle them.
I:74779;916;(Like Faust he even makes a deal with the Wall Streeters in order to get a new, extraordinarily powerful processor for his computer.)
I:74779;917;no matter the genius, or the purity, or the ambition.
I:74779;918;man is simply not ready to share in these secrets, is so profoundly antithetical to our Age of Reason that it is a pleasant shock to find an artist who's still resorting to it.
I:74779;919;And, amazingly enough, this mythical lesson is still just as powerful today as it has been throughout human history.You can't really discuss the end of the film without ruining it for first time viewers.
I:74779;920;mostly due to the unusual look of the film, Max's sometimes off.
I:74779;921;but if you stick with it and at least accept the visual style, you'll be treated to a compelling version of one of our oldest, but still most relevant, stories.
I:74779;922;Yeah, this is one of those movies that you need to watch twice (BEWARE: this movie combines both black and white film w/ techno beats in the background!)
I:74779;923;from Darren Aronofsky (who directed the REQUIEM FOR A DREAM masterpiece), this is another great indie film of his.
I:74779;924;but this is a great film to watch.
I:74779;925;Watch it for a good job done on a very small budget with limited characters.
I:74779;926;A thrilling movie that really makes you wonder.
I:74779;927;This movie's plot has unexplored potential.
I:74779;928;It is, after all, a film recognized by the Sundance Film Festival.
I:74779;929;Pie is my favorite movie.
I:74779;930;"Its so cool, like that one part, where that guy, like goes into a hole, and he's like ""Grr!"
I:74779;931;I found this movie to be OK.
I:74779;932;under donnie darko and natural born killers.
I:74779;933;this is a really ODD movie.
I:74779;934;"that simple notion, at the heart of Darren Aronofsky's ""Pi,"" defies the complexity of this brilliant little indie thriller."
I:74779;935;has a pattern to it that can be expressed as a number.
I:74779;936;It's some of both, I suppose, but make no mistake: The film is visually stunning, and has a lot to say about the burden of genius, the quest for knowledge .
I:74779;937;"health warning: ""Pi"" has a throbbing score and is filled with grainy, flickering images."
I:74779;938;An intense obsession to discover the greatest secret of the universe is really more about greed than curiosity, and that's what this film clearly depicts.
I:74779;939;In the end this genius, through a desperate act, gives up his faith in chaos by surrendering to chaos instead.
I:74779;940;And finally he is free.
I:74779;941;This is more than just a statement of the intra_relations of inner self and life, but a summary of our trip to the Final Destination.
I:74779;942;A good example is the troubled protagonist of Pi, played to chilling perfection by Sean Gullette, who struggles with both the outside world and himself in his quest for the ultimate knowledge .
I:74779;943;"(In fact the depictions of the migranes are amongst the film's best sequences
I:74779;944;It is during or just after the onset of these migranes that Gullette's character seems to receive his greatest revelations and insights .
I:74779;945;I believe it's by their sheer conviction that it works that the filmmakers are able to pull it off at all.
I:74779;946;In fact, it's through the use of this symbolism (light=knowledge) that Pi does some of its best work.
I:74779;947;It may take more than one viewing to get everything out of this film, because there's a lot packed into it.
I:74779;948;but the more you watch it, the more rewarding it is.
I:74779;949;Basic idea/story is interesting, and deserves better treatment.
I:74779;950;Interesting cinematography is reminiscent of a typical film student going through the playing with creative new techniques phase, before she/he eventually learns what really works and what doesn't.
I:74779;951;'Pi' is an audacious debut by Aronofsky that explores some intriguing questions about the link between math and mysticism and shows how far a low budget can go with boldness, intelligence and imagination.
I:74779;952;The stark, imaginative photography is great.
I:74779;953;"It's easy to see why director Darren Aronofsky won the ""Best Director"" award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival."
I:74779;954;Film art buffs will appreciate Aronofsky's work on this flick.
I:74779;955;pi is an eccentric tale to say the least.
I:74779;956;the story is fascinating and Aronofsky creates an air of urgency and suspense that draws the audience in.
I:74779;957;If you're a fan of the unusual or a follower of cult classics, then I highly recommend this film.
I:74779;958;This film uses interesting mathematics and other theories to create an exciting atmosphere.
I:74779;959;The music and visuals are excellent, better than most blockbusters.
I:74779;960;a lot of the stuff is based on the real.
I:74779;961;life Chudnovsky brothers, who you are pretty interesting in their own right.
I:74779;962;Actually i found the making more interesting than the movie.
I:74779;963;"You can feel the ""movie making 101"" everywhere in this movie."
I:74779;964;But I can tell its a treat for people who are fond of movies and their skeleton.
I:74779;965;i sugguest you steer far away from this horrid example of what people claim is a good film.
I:74779;966;This is definitely a must see.
I:74779;967;I viewed Pi about a year ago.
I:74779;968;My little sister felt I would appreciate the film for three reasons: I have a Bachelor in Mathematics, I find the nature of numbers to be beautiful, and I have been on a low.
I:74779;969;key spiritual quest most of my life.
I:74779;970;Pi is a rich, deep film for those who philosophize about God, Sanity and so much more.
I:74779;971;Not one of just a good story, cool ideas, nice visuals, but was well aware of the music and 'colors' and symmetry.
I:74779;972;Darren Aronofsky's debut film 'Pi,' based on the Greek letter and mathematical formula is a superb look into a genius' nightmare.
I:74779;973;Can we really call him genius?
I:74779;974;The Rabbis were, here, attempting to translate the Torah into numbers to attain the true knowledge , and then chasing our wizard around town.
I:74779;975;What mattered mostly was the internal world of our friendly genius.
I:74779;976;Marvelously composed, this film is like a math formula that wants to be deciphered and is fun figuring it out.
I:74779;977;I've always enjoyed Darren Aronofsky's point of view of the human mind, though he is a bit of an acquired taste.
I:74779;978;"It sat for years on the movie shelf, even making its way into the ""sell"" bin several times but I always pulled it out and put it back on the shelf."
I:74779;979;I grabbed it and thought about watching it with the director's comments.
I:74779;980;When I watched the movie again I was able to see the film from his POV and it went from no stars to five stars for me and became a personal favorite.
I:74779;981;for all those who enjoy the film and want to be entertained, watch the director's comments.
I:74779;982;For those who hate the movie, the director's comments will give the film meaning.
I:74779;983;I love black and white movies.
I:74779;984;There is something about them that really touches me.
I:74779;985;They are more colorful to me than color movies. . . This movie is not black and white.
I:74779;986;I admire anyone who can watch the whole thing!
I:74779;987;Pi is a film that will most likely stay with you long after you watch it.
I:74779;988;Darren Aronofsky (Requium For A Dream) created an entertaining experimental film with Pi.
I:74779;989;A very dark movie (aside from being black and white) with a great techno score, and extremley bizzare scenes and images.
I:74779;990;Pi is a great movie, but I dont think it's so deep and powerful as some reviews stated.
I:74779;991;the plot interested me, but the actual flow of the film was more anoying that interesting.
I:74779;992;The director achieved this objective.
I:74779;993;If the director wanted a dismal movie, he succeeded.
I:74779;994;Pi was a great film, one of three hole in the head movies.
I:74779;995;average math knowledge, so perhaps that is the reason I bought it.
I:74779;996;bUT, I should say I found it a very stupid movie, and I am very surprised for all the positive comments I have found here.
I:74779;997;The last half has the guy poking imaginary brains, and he discovers he's got something in his own head.
I:74779;998;Pi is a comlpex movie to say the least.
I:74779;999;The filmwork is amazing and the grainy black and white footage adds to the allure of the film.
I:74779;1000;It has a certain intrigue, possibly due to the outstanding acting.
I:74779;1001;Plot could have been very good.
I:74779;1002;fi freak, our protagonist, though a genius, was a might fragile.
I:74779;1003;I love the premise of the story itself, and for an indie film it was well conceived.
I:74779;1004;And, actually, everything they said was right.
I:74779;1005;It's a film that makes mathematics interesting.
I:74779;1006;Many people also priased its originality.
I:74779;1007;"that's not to say there weren't elements of the film that worked, and worked very well
I:74779;1008;The first half of this film is suggestive and intriguing.
I:74779;1009;By doing some, albeit limited, research into mathematics, Aronofsky succeeds in evoking the mystery in maths' connection with the ordinary world .
I:74779;1010;Still many of the techniques rehearsed here see fruition in 'Requiem for a Dream', the latter being a much more satisfying piece of work.
I:74779;1011;Pi has some deep concepts as well.
I:74779;1012;This is some deep stuff.
I:74779;1013;The deleted scenes are also an added bonus.
I:74779;1014;Although definitely not for the mainstream movie fan, Pi offers a great deal for the sophisticated viewer.
I:74779;1015;PI is one of the most original movies I have seen in years, proving once again that you don't need a big budget to make a great film.
I:74779;1016;Is there something hidden, the name of God imprinted somewhere deep inside of imbalanced genius.
I:74779;1017;with a great score, haunting acting and wild hallucinogenic images, the movie is a wild ride of a mystic thriller.
I:74779;1018;How to make an interesting movie with a theme like numbers.
I:74779;1019;welcome to the religion of numbers
I:74779;1020;Well, thank goodness for films like Pi then, that proves to us that independent cinema can be really, really good.
I:74779;1021;He figures that since patterns can be found everywhere else in the world, there must be a pettern to the stock market as well.
I:74779;1022;All in all a very interesting film.
I:74779;1023;I viewed the entire film.
I:74779;1024;It has an interesting premise and seems a little like a pre.
I:74779;1025;If you want to see a movie that is at once smart and utterly unique you can't do better than Pi.
I:74779;1026;The film is well described in the Amazon editorial review.
I:74779;1027;Beyond the actual story which takes you to strange dark places in the mind and asks all the right questions about Max's obsession.
I:74779;1028;The film is a visual and aural delight as it stimulates areas of your brain you didn't know you had to enjoy.
I:74779;1029;And like David Aranofsky's more recent film, Requiem for a Dream, the unique camera devices he constructed add to the films magnificent sense of claustrophobia by placing the camera in places that violate your comfort space.
I:74779;1030;I am surprised at how many people have seen it and enjoy recommending it.
I:74779;1031;I picked it up brand new from a major retail book chain [.]
I:74779;1032;One from the director Aranofsky and the other from the actors.
I:74779;1033;Also included are some really interesting behind the scenes segments showing how some of the unique camera work was accomplished.
I:74779;1034;You will definitely earn some cool points with the already initiated once you reveal you have seen the film.
I:74779;1035;Ocassionally these sorts of arty farty movies are outstanding, occassionaly they are so.
I:74779;1036;This fits in the middle for me, with the following reasons.
I:74779;1037;A mathematical recluse, highly intelligent, with an existential existance, serching for a pattern to the stockmarket, and the natural world at large.
I:74779;1038;He is ever so close to a complex formula he believes is the basis not only for the stockmarket, but for much of nature.
I:74779;1039;The world has patterns, the language of nature is math, or so he believes.
I:74779;1040;The encounters with religious sects could have been done with more subtlety, and developed more carefully.
I:74779;1041;The film overall has little structure, even though these ideas themselves are very good.
I:74779;1042;"And the film needn't have been all dark
I:74779;1043;arty movie, great ideas, but could have been so much better.
I:74779;1044;Max desperately tries to keep his secrets to himself, but if the traders and the Kabbalists don't get him, the sheer power of the knowledge sure does, and decides it is best not to know at all.
I:74779;1045;Neophyte cyberpunks should love this stuff.
I:74779;1046;Interesting little film with multiple aspects to it.
I:74779;1047;I think it was an entertaining movie.
I:74779;1048;When I initially saw this movie I was overwhelmed with a sense that this was just a self.
I:74779;1049;scientific power that can explain life, the universe and everything, and is centered around the number 216.
I:74779;1050;All it did was play with lighting, camera angles, and a quirky character.
I:74779;1051;intelligence, and baseless mental elitism has surrounded this movie.
I:74779;1052;The funniest thing I read here was how someone knew it was a good movie because they were in the business .
I:74779;1053;turmoil to make a compelling drama.
I:74779;1054;for a $600,000 production, Pi is well done.
I:74779;1055;Its musical score is edgy and creative, and the film is shot cleverly.
I:74779;1056;There are many possible fascinating questions that could be explored.
I:74779;1057;There have been a lot of interpretations of the number of the beast.
I:74779;1058;Don't rush out to see it, it's really just a very well.
I:74779;1059;It has the momentum of a great movie, without being one.
I:74779;1060;A thriller that's all about math.
I:74779;1061;Amazingly, it's still a great film.
I:74779;1062;While not as powerful or memorable as his further films, this is still a wondeful film.
I:74779;1063;sean Gullete gives a wonderful performance and Aronofsky works the camera masterfully in this first rate mathematical thriller.
I:74779;1064;a good movie that I would recommend to anybody.
I:74779;1065;numbingly paced film is one of the more interesting independant films to pop up in a while.
I:74779;1066;Well written screenplay executed brilliantly, with top.
I:74779;1067;What he does however is wierd enough for me to give this movie 4 stars.
I:74779;1068;I found the technical aspects of camera angle, high contrast black and white, snippets of conversation to be a little more than I could handle.
I:74779;1069;The story itself is very decadent.
I:74779;1070;Great indy film by Darren Aronofsky.
I:74779;1071;It is turly one of the most brilliant and original movies of all time.
I:74779;1072;Though I didn't understand every little thing that was going on, the mystery was beautifully depicted and easy to follow.
I:74779;1073;Pi was a dark movie with an interesting number theory theme.
I:74779;1074;It's probably a two and a half star movie, really.
I:74779;1075;Good pick for prime free unlimited streaming.
I:74779;1076;Yet Pi is undoubtably one of the greatest, grittiest and urbane modern classics.
I:74779;1077;I recommend it to anyone who sees more in life than just daily routine and for anyone who has a passion for solving problems on a deeper level.
I:74779;1078;The metaphors for reason, romance and religion are flawless.
I:74779;1079;The cinematography is excellent and well reflective of the story.
I:74779;1080;His life is consumed by patterns, and his lives his life reciting his assumptions and their evidence.
I:74779;1081;Very amusing is Sol's story of Archimedes and the bath.
I:74779;1082;max is definitely a genius, but with absolute genius comes madness.
I:74779;1083;Max's degeneration and haunting mania are wonderfully portrayed in this tense, gripping movie with a not.
I:74779;1084;There are many things to love about this movie .
I:74779;1085;an intense examination of the struggle with madness .
I:74779;1086;real world, filled with people who somehow know of the quest to find order in chaos.
I:74779;1087;A brilliant depiction of a black and white, strange world.
I:74779;1088;overall, a pleasant movie that intrigues, but never quite fulfills the promise of a truly unique world.
I:74779;1089;It's alright, the black and white is interesting, although I usually debated about just turning it off and watching something else.
I:74779;1090;this is one of the best movies I have seen from Danny Arawkosky seen it once and would gladly enjoy to see again and again to get a better idea of this great movie
I:74779;1091;I think Aranofsky himself is a genius .
I:74779;1092;he shot such a solid and mature debut film with such a low budget.
I:74779;1093;Similar style with unexpected angles and beautiful BW shots (the tempo in 1979 was much slower), surreal and disturbing atmosphere and even direct parallels .
I:74779;1094;So, I've switched off my brain and enjoyed the movie.
I:74779;1095;This is an incredible movie.
I:74779;1096;There is a very strong message here, but a lot of people won't take the time to look for it.
I:74779;1097;the movie is basically about a mathematical genius, who intends to discover a cryptic number in the Bible that contains the true name of God.
I:74779;1098;this movie says a lot about the true nature of the world, and the true nature of man.
I:74779;1099;The message at the end is decidedly more positive than the one contained in Requiem for a Dream, and it still makes for powerful viewing.
I:74779;1100;See this movie at once.
I:74779;1101;Patterns are everywhere, true enough.
I:74779;1102;An intriguing premise for a movie?
I:74779;1103;I must say that visually, the movie is a treat, and I watched it all of the way through.
I:74779;1104;It is a movie that showcases the director's vision and abilities, but it is ultimately nullified by a cast of characters that could easily be bested by the literally two.
I:74779;1105;My recommendation to director Aronofsky: Remake the movie from the point that the main character trepans himself.
I:74779;1106;make the movie about the rediscovery of his madness, make him more human.
I:74779;1107;This makes Pi an altogether more intriguing and absorbing film than David Lynch's forerunner, which was rather up its own alimentary canal anyway.
I:74779;1108;neatly edited, thoughtful, and brave (you try making the pitch sound exciting).
I:74779;1109;Worth watching, bizarre, interesting, not completely predictable.
I:74779;1110;I thought the director did an excellent job of bringing the audience into the tortured world of understanding chaos.
I:74779;1111;I enjoyed the acting, the black and white setting and the storyline.
I:74779;1112;A literal work of art.
I:74779;1113;Great titles also recommend: Cube, Gummo, Basquiat.
I:74779;1114;Every few years, a new movie is made that creates a new genre.
I:74779;1115;This movie is certainly one of those.
I:74779;1116;The choice of black and white made the movie even more special.
I:74779;1117;This movie proves that a good movie is not necessarily an expensive movie to make.
I:74779;1118;This movie is a must see for all cinema lovers.
I:74779;1119;Heck, anyone with a science background in their education knows this is the basis for all science.
I:74779;1120;It's a little simple, but it's along those lines.
I:74779;1121;"back to PI: it just takes the idea that a genius, Max, comes across a ""magic"" 216 digit number that is quite important."
I:74779;1122;what makes the movie work in my opinion is basic (and sudden, last.
I:74779;1123;Watch it and you'll see.
I:74779;1124;The music and cinematography also make the movie great to watch.
I:74779;1125;This movie is good at introducing the world of numbers to anyone.
I:74779;1126;But it is a great start into the meaning both spiritual, and mystical regarding numbers.
I:74779;1127;workings of the stock market, I guess so that he can get really rich.
I:74779;1128;The scenes with Gullette and his mentor are well done and kept me interested despite the repetition.
I:74779;1129;Max is in it to win it for the sake of knowledge.
I:74779;1130;the movie really builds up well.
I:74779;1131;you will get a really strong sense that SOMETHING of major importance is going to be revealed if you keep watching.
I:74779;1132;The lead character is great.
I:74779;1133;I mean, he's getting revelations to the meaning of life, the universe and everything by the swirling eddies in his coffee!
I:74779;1134;i mentioned that this movie makes you feel like it's building up to something so grand that it may even aid you in your own life.
I:74779;1135;great addition to your underground sci.
I:74779;1136;An excellent look at how genius borders insanity.
I:74779;1137;Twists and turns on what Max debates is real and what is hallucination show the inner struggle of a genius searching for an answer.
I:74779;1138;"Pi was extremely intense concerning a math genius's obsession and eventual madness with finding ""the number."""
I:74779;1139;I didn't expect to enjoy this movie, after reading some of the reviews, but I truly did!
I:74779;1140;It's definitely a movie you have to be willing to take the time to consider.
I:74779;1141;I was just about ready to turn it off after 10 minutes, but I'm really happy I stuck it out.
I:74779;1142;Now this is what I call a movie!
I:74779;1143;It's one of those movies that makes you really think.
I:74779;1144;For originality this movie deserves 5 stars.
I:74779;1145;If you do not have a strong mathematical background I recommend watching something else (may I recommend the Jerry Springer show to the general reader).
I:74779;1146;If you have been exposed to some chaos theory and possibly neural networks you will appreciate the content/originality of this film.
I:74779;1147;Again, the movie deserves 5 stars for its originality as a film, if you are familiar with some of the mathematical concepts you will appreciate it.
I:74779;1148;The subject matter hit home, as I was a Math major.
I:74779;1149;this movie is absolutely brilliant and in my opinion better than requiem for a dream.
I:74779;1150;the hallucination/nightmare scenes in pi are subtle and catch you unawares, as opposed to the outrageous portrayals in requiem.
I:74779;1151;true, that may have been due, in part, to the very limited budget, but it works to maximum effect in producing a gem that should not be overlooked.
I:74779;1152;Pi is a fresh new take on an age.
I:74779;1153;Max has discovered a number that he thinks holds the key to every facet of life, and he beomes somewhat obsessed with it.
I:74779;1154;paced action and drama keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end, and make you think about what numbers really have to do with the essence of life.
I:74779;1155;old could have created a better film.
I:74779;1156;I thought I would totally enjoy something like this because the whole Kabbalah/Hebrew numbers thing fascinates me.
I:74779;1157;UGH is a good word for this movie.
I:74779;1158;you might just enjoy this movie or just lie to your friends and brag that you did.
I:74779;1159;The only aspect of this movie that saves it from a zero is that it looks great.
I:74779;1160;metaphysics meet science and science meets insanity in an incredible film that has already earned characterisations that range from classic to cult.
I:74779;1161;The main character (you've never seen him before but you will agree he's a perfect match for the role) is ultra.
I:74779;1162;convincing and the few other characters that appear are carefully casted and compliment the movie as well.
I:74779;1163;wise the film is an undisputed masterpiece.
I:74779;1164;The director and crew have done an astonishing job to capture the claustrophobic story and throughout one has the feeling that he's watching this whole thing from up close.
I:74779;1165;And it manages that in a very eerie way.
I:74779;1166;It also intends to provoke and create controversy around itself.
I:74779;1167;as if everything concerning this brilliant moment of cinema wasn't good enough the soundtrack is a treat too!
I:74779;1168;this is easily one of the top films within the last 10 years and ranks way high on the list in its genre.
I:74779;1169;thank you thank you thank you
I:74779;1170;it truley saddens me when people who watch a messed up movie automatically believe for some reason it is great.
I:74779;1171;I liked half this movie, and that is the part about how everything in the universe can be translated into math which could revolve around this magic 216 number or Pi .
I:74779;1172;Leaving more unsaid than shown, I found this film to be fascinating as well as thought.
I:74779;1173;For those of us using science as our primary road for a spiritual journey, this movie is a must.
I:74779;1174;I received some good information.
I:74779;1175;Rotten movie in my eyes.
I:74779;1176;If you graph these numbers, patterns emerge.
I:74779;1177;Therefore: There are patterns everywhere in nature.
I:74779;1178;A surreal philosophical thriller, Pi asks the question, Do you really want to know the TRUTH?
I:74779;1179;The movie keeps an aura of menace and madness about it throughout, right up to the final question posed to Max.
I:74779;1180;His answer, and the expression accompanying it perfectly finished the movie for me.
I:74779;1181;most definitely not everyone's cup of tea, but I think it's portrayal of the danger associated with seeing too deeply is without peer.
I:74779;1182;This is an intense film with a superb visual and aural style.
I:74779;1183;Still, Pi is an interesting portrait of a troubled soul.
I:74779;1184;My son and I like science/math based suspense movies and we weren't sure what Pi was about so we gave it a shot.
I:74779;1185;Makes you think and wonder.
I:74779;1186;Creates a unique view using math.
I:74779;1187;Would recommend to friends and those with an interest in math as well.
I:74779;1188;This movie is a classic as much as a cult classic.
I:74779;1189;Very well filmed (if you don't mind the artsy B&W w/ grain look.)
I:74779;1190;The story is great and the movie flows well.
I:74779;1191;Pi tells a story that one can take at face value, but really under the surface is the lead character's inner workings.
I:74779;1192;A great movie to discuss possible meanings.
I:74779;1193;Gritty, high contrast b/w images, rundown locales, excellent, frenetic score sweeps you along in a dizzying madness.
I:74779;1194;the irony is, for someone who can handle so much compexity, Max is struggling to cope with the simple realities of day to day life, love and co. existence, with dramatic results.
I:74779;1195;A great example of intelligent filmmaking on a tight budget.
I:74779;1196;The director, Daniel Aranofsky, makes great use of the light and dark shades that black.
I:74779;1197;, it is certainly a powerful and interesting piece and I would recommend it to those with imagination and an open mind.
I:74779;1198;I would not recommend it to a casual viewer.
I:74779;1199;babble, or just think that seeing people play Go in a movie makes it totally cool and intellectual, then by all means, you best gobble this one up.
I:74779;1200;visually it is stunning, and the handheld work and other characteristics are very good and even somewhat original.
I:74779;1201;darren Aronofsky is clearly talented as a director.
I:74779;1202;Hopefully his great visual style will progress and mature in future work.
I:74779;1203;"I like these kind of movies
I:74779;1204;First time I seen this movie, it was for me really interesting.
I:74779;1205;I am keen on statistic/analyze/data mining, so it takes my attention really fast.
I:74779;1206;i don't mind that this is Black/White movie, I love it even more.
I:74779;1207;Sondtrack totally fit to scenes.
I:74779;1208;Every time I get something new from the movie and this is, what I like about this movie.
I:74779;1209;This movie has very interesting theory.
I:74779;1210;It states that patterns exist everywhere: in nature, in science, in religion, in business.
I:74779;1211;This has alot going for it, and it delivers all the way.
I:74779;1212;It is one of my favorite movies, and I highly suggest seeing this movie as soon as possible.
I:74779;1213;pi is a gritty film with perfect pacing and an inventive story line.
I:74779;1214;It's rare these days that a movie comes along that everyone is the family can enjoy.
I:74779;1215;PI is one of those movies.
I:74779;1216;Great cinematography, really good acting and a well told exacting story.
I:74779;1217;But if you're looking for something unique, original, and interesting, you have to check this out.
I:74779;1218;"the movie pulls off the black and white perfectly
I:74779;1219;"It's an interesting twist on numbers and math
I:74779;1220;The black and white pixelization technique is amazing, to say the least.
I:74779;1221;When i first saw this, i was waiting for more plot, but what i later realized is how amazingly this movie is in the most subtle ways.
I:74779;1222;It left a lasting impression on me, begging for a re.
I:74779;1223;Pi is one of those movies that wonderfully speaks to the psuedo.
I:74779;1224;intellectual in all of us, and gives us comfort in the idea that somehow we might actually be able to gain understanding of this mess around us.
I:74779;1225;now, don't take that as a insult, the films by this director(I can't spell his last name off the top of my head right now, sorry) are quite fun and enjoyable.
I:74779;1226;but I will say that the movie is very entertaining and well put together.
I:74779;1227;The movie is fairly creative with its characters and set up, and the story itself is interesting and keep enough pace to not lose the average movie goers attention.
I:74779;1228;"This film primarily concentrates on madness
I:74779;1229;something common to genius (Pythagoras, Archimedes, Newton).
I:74779;1230;Nevertheless, I found the mathematics to be accurate and compelling.
I:74779;1231;The film beautifully intertwines the revitilization of spirituality and science.
I:74779;1232;I recommend anyone that is interested in human thinking to see this movie immediately.
I:74779;1233;The soundtrack embeds itself into the movie very well playing with your senses and appropriately sends you places with the protagonist, Max Cohen.
I:74779;1234;The main character is controlled by the idea that the world as a whole, and also its component parts, can be summarized in a formula.
I:74779;1235;And emotions, feelings, and sensations are at least as much a part of the world as what is set down in formulas as its explanation.
I:74779;1236;Pi was a cinematic masterpiece that left me stunned.
I:74779;1237;Personally I found Pi much more entertaining than the harsh Requiem for a Dream.
I:74779;1238;Aronofsky does a beautiful job of tying in the mystery of pi, the meaning of life and the tortuous genius of the main character.
I:74779;1239;I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.
I:74779;1240;I loved the whole insanity, drug, and the directing.
I:74779;1241;Requiem is a much much better film.
I:74779;1242;This one will leave you disappionted.
I:74779;1243;If you like Math, this movie is for you.
I:74779;1244;The grainy black and white photography in this film is just one of its many compelling aspects.
I:74779;1245;if you don't mind doing some thinking while watching a film, then this is a good choice for you.
I:74779;1246;The actor has to go through a mind.
I:74779;1247;It so good for the young academic.
I:74779;1248;Max Cohen is a mathematical genius.
I:74779;1249;He is fascinated by numbers.
I:74779;1250;"Others are interested in his findings
I:74779;1251;Shot in black white, this is an effective first feature from Aronofsky.
I:74779;1252;The picture is a good transfer in 1.66:1 ratio, and the sound is excellent in Dolby surround 2.0.
I:74779;1253;There are two seperate commentaries from director and lead actor, both good.
I:74779;1254;There's a documentary behind the scenes of the film.
I:74779;1255;This shows the making the film on a tight budget, and Arononofsky receiving his best new director award at the Sundance Film Festival.
I:74779;1256;I found it to be very interesting and enjoyed the adventure and especially the end.
I:74779;1257;Expertly directed(and written) by Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a dream)and shot in very contrasting black and white, this is a brilliant look at genius and the toll it can take on the mind.
I:74779;1258;A harrowing mindtrip of intelligence.
I:74779;1259;The photography was fun and interesting.
I:74779;1260;I liked the little girl who kept asking math questions.
I:74779;1261;Pi, directed by Darren Aronofsky is an intense film about a man who battles his own genius.
I:74779;1262;True to Aronofsky films, the theme of the movie is based on man or woman's struggle to keep their mind in check, and try to stay grounded in reality.
I:74779;1263;If you enjoyed watching other Aronofsky films such as Black Swan, or The Wrestler, you will see Aronofsky's earlier work coming together to become one of the great contemporary directors,
I:74779;1264;Instant classic about intelligence and the human mind.
I:74779;1265;But it was still a fun theme, and the path of one mad theory to explain the universe hasn't exactly been unheard of among math's best and brightest (e. g., Pascal).
I:74779;1266;The filming was interesting, the soundtrack jarringly exhilirating.
I:74779;1267;A very interesting idea for a movie with an innovative presentation.
I:74779;1268;Would not recommend it to anybody.
I:74779;1269;Real weird is all I can say.
I:74779;1270;excellent movie that makes you think about the purpose of mathmatics!
I:74779;1271;Soundtrack is an awesome companion to the action unfolding and many twists and turns.
I:74779;1272;Pi is a beautiful movie about the mind, and what can happen if you try to hard.
I:74779;1273;If knowledge is your thing, you also have to see this movie.
I:74779;1274;A real film noir cult classic in black and white.
I:74779;1275;fi thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat as you follow Maximiliam Cohen on the quest for the most important discovery of his life.
I:74779;1276;He teeters on the edge of insanity, and he uncovers a secret for which everyone is willing to kill.
I:74779;1277;I enjoyed just watching it.
I:74779;1278;It's really just the story of a man who challenges himself, but has come across something that is putting up a good fight.
I:74779;1279;He uses math as his universal language , and Pi as his tool of comprehension.
I:74779;1280;See it, watch it, don't try to out wit it.
I:74779;1281;The story line is fascinating.
I:74779;1282;All of the scenes are very realistic.
I:74779;1283;I had heard so many good things about this movie, yet I found it overrated.
I:74779;1284;For the math enthusiasts, this movie is a gem.
I:74779;1285;To make a film on this kind of budget is incredible.
I:74779;1286;To make a good film and create some charater to the look and sound is amazing.
I:74779;1287;while not breathtaking in terms of technology their effectiveness is central to the film.
I:74779;1288;Think the last scene of Minority Report which guts an otherwise good film.
I:74779;1289;see Pi for the multilayered performances, philosophies and craft that went into this film.
I:74779;1290;That impresses me but it's Darren Aronofsky's at times impressionistic, sometimes surreal approach that combines with good acting to make for a terrific film .
I:74779;1291;It was a really interesting movie.
I:74779;1292;I found this movie how shall I say it Lame!
I:74779;1293;this is a wild one, my friends.
I:74779;1294;the music utilized included the Massive Attack's now ubiquitous masterwork Angel .
I:74779;1295;I brought this movie as a gift for my mother.
I:74779;1296;She has been looking for this movie.
I:74779;1297;She said she saw it on Netflix and she want this movie.
I:74779;1298;I found it on here and the prices was a little high, but it was worth it anyway because my mother really want this movie.
I:74779;1299;After viewing this film, I was really impressed with how good it was.
I:74779;1300;While it is suspenseful, those who do not like art.
I:74779;1301;like movies or black white films should keep away (though you may turn out loving it).
I:74779;1302;I really loved this film and think it should be added to the List of Great Suspenses.
