1;This is understandably one of those films that divide an audience.
2;"Some think it's mad genius
I:63800;3;Still, a part of me likes it.
I:63800;4;I can't make up my mind!It's got arresting visuals and originality in spades.
I:63800;5;People watch movies to be entertained.
I:63800;6;Like I said, he's got a real talent for making striking, disturbing visuals that can really hypnotize the viewer.
I:63800;7;Eraserhead certainly has a lot of them.
I:63800;8;He might just be a genius.
I:63800;9;It's a trip without a destination.
I:63800;10;Eraserhead is an exercise in style, and nothing else.
I:63800;11;If you just look at it from that angle, it is a very stylistic, cool, creepy movie.
I:63800;12;So they get married (I assume) and move into Henry's apartment together, while keeping the newborn creature on top of a dresser.
I:63800;13;i like some of David Lynch's stuff because while it might be impossible to """"get,"""" he at least makes good movies that are interesting."""
14;I see how this film made David Lynch famous, but I think he has made much better films since this.
15;I first saw this film in my teenage years and I was completely dumbfounded by it.
16;but a place of intense emotion.
17;In my opinion, Eraserhead shows just how deeply you can be affected by the medium of film.
18;i think Lynch is one of the most important directors in the whole story of cinema because He succeeds in make his audience to travel between dream and reality, just cinema has to do.
19;But the strangeness of it all is done with such conviction, and the fact that the people involved stayed with it from beginning to end, literally for years, until completion, is commendable.
20;This is obviously a dream.
21;"in Heaven, everything is fine."""
22;"I guess it is a classic ""Art Film,"" and the fact that it still gets attention many years later says something."
23;Anyone that has studied Shakespeare understands that ambiguity is one of the most powerful means of evoking meaning.
24;It is the spectator who will have to untie these intricate knots.
25;Perhaps the most ambiguous film yet produced is a grand triumph for the fans by virtue rather than in spite of its absolute resistance to claims of finding resolution and closure.
26;And I think that present film.
27;Let's face it: film can appeal to our senses and sensibilities in so many ways that we can be moderately 'entertained' by unambitious trash.
28;And he new well how to use image.
29;The 'video' that is 'I see with my intellect' and will reveal with imagery more akin to the the mind's eye is a rare thing to pull off.
30;It's hard enough to find a movie with good acting and a decent plot that is not so hackneyed that I want to vomit.
31;I highly recommend it and believe that Lynch was very brave for creating a film that he knew would very likely displease even many of his fans.
32;I recommend giving I. E. a chance.
33;Everything Lynch has done (with the exception of Dune) is worth owning and watching several times a year for me.
34;A great treasure is the release of The Short Films of David Lynch.
35;This brave film is an investigation into new languages (poetic, surrealistic, expressionist) applied to the cinema medium.
36;Such a classic and timeless, the mood is strong, like the shadows of your imagination.
37;This film has true substance and allows you to understand that negative space is more important than positive space or just as important.
38;Great movie, came fast and arrived in great condtion.
39;But I remember the fun we had as we would repeat the lines of the movie, over and over again.
40;The scene with the mother asking about the relationship he has with her daughter, and a scene with the lady across the hall.
41;Other than those few scenes, this is a classic film that will keep you entertained each time you watch.
42;My girls loved this movie, they watched it several times and although they don't think it is that scary, they say it is more a thriller than a scary movie.
43;Plot: A movie involving a man living in what looks to be a post apocalyptic world.
44;Also a man that lives in a planet, a singing lady in a radiator and bleeding trees.
45;Thats about all I can tell you of the plot of this movie.
46;hopefully one day he will say what this movie meant.
47;The film, strange as it is, is one of the most incredibly complete films I have ever seen.
48;It is truly a film about vision and mood and director David Lynch creates the perfect mood for his fantastic vision.
49;There is so much debate about the meaning of this film and I think that is what will essentially immortalize the film as one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever filmed.
50;David Lynch has stated that he has yet to read an interpretation of the film that matches his thoughts upon penning it (he even claims that he cannot remember writing the script) and I feel that he will take the films meaning to his grave.
51;He wrongly draws the conclusion that she has severed things with him when in actuality she has been giving birth to their child.
52;this is really the best way to describe the plot, although the film veers off into Henry's head to create subplots and storylines that deserve our examination.
53;david Lynch has claimed that this film is about all the fears and anxieties he faced in Philadelphia while attending the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.
54;In all honestly this helps boast my interpretation.
55;"The depiction of the baby as a monster seems to draw on mans fear of fatherhood
I:63800;56;The advances of the beautiful neighbor also impress mans desire for freedom, casting aside the restraints of marriage for a fling.
I:63800;57;The man in the planet could serve to represent many things, but looking at his appearance and demeanor I lean towards the idea that this man represents mans disinterest in physical labor"
58;the acting in `Eraserhead' is flawless when you consider the type of film this is.
59;Jack Nance gives one of my favorite male performances as Henry Spencer.
60;His nervousness is key to creating the mood that Lynch establishes with the film, and if he had dropped the ball then the film would have sunk.
61;Charlotte Stewart is insanely effective as Mary, but it's Allen Joseph and Jeanne Bates that really make the most of their small roles.
62;The dinner scene alone is one of the most memorable scenes in the film when it comes to performances, and Bates steals that whole scene with her domineering mother.
63;Joseph is great as Mr. X, Mary's father.
64;His performance is manic and commanding.
65;lynch is the true star here though, delivering a rich and fulfilling film that is unlike anything else you've ever seen.
66;The films rich black and white delivery, not to mention the machinelike score, completely engulf the film and add layers to the feeling, the mood, the structure and construction of this flawless film.
67;It is a blessed unknown, a riddle that one must try to crack fully aware that they never will.
68;"Lynch has created a masterpiece, a creative gem that will serve as one of a kind
I:63800;69;`Eraserhead', whether you want to admit it or not, may very well be the greatest film of all time.
I:63800;70;a strange movie and definitely stays with you.
I:63800;71;It it somewhat like his other movies or a William Faulkner novel, in that you notice additional imagery or points of interest with each viewing.
I:63800;72;The sounds of the industrial city, spewing forth their mysterious product 24/7, will stay with you, keeping you awake at night.
I:63800;73;I've watched several David Lynch films before and now that I've finally watched Eraserhead, I feel that I have a deeper understanding of Lynch and his films.
I:63800;74;It's a work of art, a dark, surreal painting with real people that has been committed to film.
I:63800;75;The film is an experience .
I:63800;76;so is it good art?
I:63800;77;Good art should provoke a reaction in the person experiencing it, and Eraserhead certainly did that for me.
I:63800;78;It left me feeling unsettled and bewildered but at the same time I had the thrill of knowing I had just watched something completely unique, haunting, funny and in it's own weird way, beautiful.
I:63800;79;of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
I:63800;80;Film arrived on time and in great packaging.
I:63800;81;Slow paced, but Eraserhead is a great story about a man named Henry, and his wife Mary who have a premature baby together and must raise it in Henry's apartment.
I:63800;82;One of Lynch's best film, and most disturbing.
I:63800;83;see for all film lovers.
I:63800;84;It was as brilliant as it was when I first saw in 1979.
I:63800;85;I was relieved to find it still played perfectly on my laptop and was in English without any subtitles needed.
I:63800;86;then it starts from normal, and builds up, etc.
I:63800;87;The final scene is perhaps the best ending in a film ever.
I:63800;88;it is a cult classic, and for a reason.
I:63800;89;It has my favorite line.
I:63800;90;they're not even sure it's a baby the movie is best in an old rundown theatre around 3 in the morning.
I:63800;91;A very unique and strange.
I:63800;92;Definitely a movie you shouldn't see sober and with a closed mind.
I:63800;93;A MUST SEE, cult classic.
I:63800;94;David Lynch is a true artist.
I:63800;95;iF he made it, that is.
I:63800;96;release of this ignored classic with great anticipation.
I:63800;97;I love strange movies so I have seen my fair share, but I have to say that without a doubt Eraserhead is the weirdest movie I have EVER seen.
I:63800;98;The utter darkness, dread, and black humour he captured is incredible!
I:63800;99;ERASERHEAD should only be seen by those who enjoy their comedies blacker than tar!
I:63800;100;To me, it's a bloody masterpiece.
I:63800;101;Easily one of the most jolting yet eerily somber films you will ever see.
I:63800;102;but if you're a horror (not slasher) fan, and especially a fan of the unique vision of Mr. Lynch, then this is as good (and dark) as it gets.
I:63800;103;shot in beautiful black and white, Lynch creates a nightmare world in which machines are always heard rumbling away, characters are quirky, and the only escape Henry has is his own imagination.
I:63800;104;It is ERASERHEAD, if not David Lynch's best film, then it is certainly his most original.
I:63800;105;Watch it once, and it will haunt you for a long time to come.
I:63800;106;Watch it twice, and it will haunt you forever.
I:63800;107;for me, the movie represents a TRUE study in the art form of movie making.
I:63800;108;The darkness and awkwardness of the whole thing is somehow riveting.
I:63800;109;henry starts to drift inside his own mind while attempting to care for the """"baby""""."""
110;Take A Clockwork Orange, Santa Sangre, eXitenZ, Shivers and Videodrome all together and you still won't be half as disturbed as you will be after seeing Eraserhead.
111;It was orginally described to me as inexplicable and that was a great set.
112;If you're ready, and you're not, treat yourself to something extra, extra special.
113;"The nightmare world of slimy creatures, freakish babies, and a weird woman who lives in the radiator all combine with the ""real"" world until there is no separation."
114;banging steam pipes, whimperings, eerie sound effects.
115;is the most impressive thing here.
116;"This is David Lynch's view of life on that infinitely fine line between the real world and the ""other."""
117;there is something unique about Eraserhead in that no matter what category or classification you put it, no matter what angle you view it from and no matter what you compare it to.
118;David Lynch's unnerving, surreal, and ironically funny debut feature is a challenge to effectively intepret, but pay special attention to the early scene in which Henry gazes at a tiny photograph of his ex.

125;i found this movie to be very engrossing.
126;I also found it to be very humorous in several places.
127;Either way, this is a great film that everyone with an open mind should experience.
128;This is a lost classic and it is great!
129;There are also some special features that are found only on the Korean version.
130;just enjoy the oddly disturbing imagery and sounds.
131;Eraserhead is a movie that's in a category all its own.
132;"I agree with many other reviewers here
I:63800;133;All in all, a true surrealist masterpiece.
I:63800;134;In 1977, a director named David Lynch was making a name for himself with the greatly disturbing and sureal masterpiece Eraserhead.
I:63800;135;The more the film goes on, the more it grows on you.
I:63800;136;in conclusion, Eraserhead is a classic Sci.
I:63800;137;Hard to find, but worth the money.
I:63800;138;But anyone who loves the art of filmmaking should have a proper viewing of this great surreal work.
I:63800;139;It's like a dream, and it captures the feeling of a dream as effectively as any film yet made.
I:63800;140;But if you want to experience a true work of art, the result of a gifted painter successfully translating his impressionistic visions to the screen, then go ahead and enjoy Lynch's masterpiece.
I:63800;141;This is an amazing flick.
I:63800;142;I had seen parts of this years ago and was eager to own the entire version.
I:63800;143;This is an incredible example of dream logic and sequencing.
I:63800;144;I'm one of those people that saw this movie decades ago and was ready to see it again since my memory had faded.
I:63800;145;There are many, many undertones in this movie that represent our world today.
I:63800;146;Hard to follow at times, humorous at other times, and downright disturbing most of the time.
I:63800;147;When is this going to be over my love and I asked each other, but continued to watch intently.
I:63800;148;It definitely freaked us out and made us think But, I would much rather watch a movie that is thought provoking.
I:63800;149;I really appreciated my normal, lovely life after this movie was over.
I:63800;150;The sound and imagery in this intense work of Film Noir are very clever indeed and set David Lynch on the path to his future work.
I:63800;151;driven story with easily understandable elements.
I:63800;152;as another viewer noted, this is a very personal film by David Lynch, which expressed his anxieties about fatherhood.
I:63800;153;The ominous pacing and soundtrack are perfect, drawing you right in to a state of mind at once troubling and fascinating and which doesn't let up for the next eighty minutes.
I:63800;154;Seeing this movie is quite an experience.
I:63800;155;Finally, I got a chance to watch it today.
I:63800;156;The sound effects were pretty intense as well.
I:63800;157;Its a truly jarring experience to watch this film.
I:63800;158;Its a truly one of a kind film but I don't think I will watch it again.
I:63800;159;This movie is more art than movie.
I:63800;160;It takes you into a twisted world where bleakness rules.
I:63800;161;Thoroughly enjoyable , what a foray into a world of bleak pure joy, utterly exaggerated social etiquette with wonderfully awkward pauses in dialogue, humor , intrigue.
I:63800;162;what an incredible amount of effort went into the creation of a baby that is memorable in a bad way.
I:63800;163;This movie holds an esteemed place in my family's memory.
I:63800;164;Occasionally we recommend it to enemies.
I:63800;165;eraserhead immediately comes to mind.
I:63800;166;must have something going for it since a few people say they thought it was great.
I:63800;167;i have enjoyed other work by David Lynch,but just not this one.
I:63800;168;When I picture the movie poster all I seeis a younger Don King.
I:63800;169;this movie is monumental on so many levels.
I:63800;170;Love the Art Garfunkle hair do.
I:63800;171;One part I thought was funny was when the old lady was smoking while making a salad and the ash was going into the bowl.
I:63800;172;If you want something to make you fall asleep or vomit this one is for you!
I:63800;173;In addition to all the elements of the film that have already been stated in previous reviews, the surreal imagery is so captivating that it transports me to another place.
I:63800;174;this film operates on so many levels.
I:63800;175;it tells a story, conveys real.
I:63800;176;Perhaps the most creative horror film ever created.
I:63800;177;The film is intelligent, deep and very surreal.
I:63800;178;It approaches mythological levels in its symbolic portrayals of life, death, religion and relationships.
I:63800;179;A very jarring film that will keep you thinking about it for days.
I:63800;180;David Lynch is at his surreal best here"

182;This is a very stunning work of art.
183;It's enjoyable in a mouth agape wow, that's unattractive way like cellulite or a mild case of scabies.

185;it always pleases me to see a fine Director do a movie in a HORRORgenre.
186;"Eraserhead was number 10 and I thought it would be fun to have a collection of these ""scariest movies."""
187;A friend of mine had heard of the movie and we watched it on fast forward with me stopping it at several places .
188;I loved Lynch's Muloholland Dr. and I remember liking Blue Velvet, but after all the hype of this mind.
189;"What I can I expect though
I:63800;190;I'd recommend it only to true Lynchian fans who are curious about all of his work and to people who like ambigious, confusing films.
I:63800;191;The guy is a genius, an as far as i have seen only Mulholland Drive comes close to being as out there.
I:63800;192;I ordered it from Amazon twice, and got the wrong thing twice.
I:63800;193;I received the cheaper, """"international"""" version both times."""
194;When returning the second one the very nice service rep assured me they would pull this from the site and get to the bottom of the confusion.
195;Whew, thanks for the rant.
196;The phenomena I experience from Eraserhead is visceral more than ethereal.
197;eraserhead is an impressive depiction of someone who is a nice guy, very shy, and mentally ill.
198;IThat movie was satisfying in a traditional movie sense, ended well, all was right in the world, including the set up for the sequel.
199;"the ""funny"" in this film is sympathetic, ecstatic funny, not derisive ."
200;But he seems to experience things very much the way my friend who is schizophrenic (and brilliant and wonderful) does.
201;"It even makes ""A Beautiful Mind"" seem a cliched regarding mental illness (that's another topic)."
202;It has a lot of surprises that are delightful and deliciously bizarre, but only because one is not stuck inside that somewhat broken brain.
203;it is easy for me to admire Henry's ability to keep trying to do the right thing in the face of a world that is not quite right.
204;Were that it were so elegant.
205;i love the multiple layers of dreams .
206;There are a lot of examples and they are interesting puzzles.
207;the film has an anthropological thing, like a Matthew Barney film .
208;"I would also direct you to Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"", a brilliant film that directly takes the Eraserhead black egg image (the one with the sweating anxious guy inside who is pulling on the lever to try to prevent a terrible train wreck ."
209;I take that as an homage, a compliment to Lynch.
210;I could try to defend Eraserhead on several fronts, but I'll just mention the beautiful cinematography and his amazing results on a zero budget.
211;This is not a cheesy film, it is definitely an art film of high standards, a work of Lynch's deepest, most pent.
212;up young passions and intellect, humor and horror and surprise and delight and dark/light emotions, his rascally wicked sensibilities.
213;He loves and respects his characters, and he mourns for them, and exalts in their successes.
214;the soundtrack is utterly brilliant, but you have to be into noise.
215;The irony is dealt a bit heavily in those, which has a tiny bit of emotional distancing to me.
216;Lynch's scenes here, to me, sometimes surpass any I have seen in their powerful weird surreal horrible gorgeous fascinating repulsive vile beautiful way.
217;This film is structured as if it had a kicker denouement, but good luck feeling good about it .
218;Although it might actually be a really good ending.
219;It is a very logical conclusion, however.
220;so I respect anyone hating this film.
221;I would never recommend it without knowing a lot about a person first.
222;The main character works in some non.

225;minded viewer for film appreciation).
226;I found myself unusually drawn to it (and mesmerized) because quite frankly the more weirder it got, the more interesting it became.
227;While the images and scenes are disturbing and unusual (such as the menstrutating chicken, the tapeworms and the destruction of the baby), they are memorable because chances are you have never seen a film quite like this.
228;After all, I think one of the unique purposes of film is to create long, lasting impressions.
229;"if you can casually watch ""Eraserhead"" and appreciate for what it is and what it attempts to present then you can enjoy it."
230;billion dollar special effects and the always happy, Hollywood, endings.
231;One of the rare movies which create tunnel vision.
232;You can see a lot of Kafka influences in it.
233;"It's worth the money
I:63800;234;Lynch has made a cottage industry of films that are difficult to understand but fascinating to watch, which can sometimes result in a frustrating viewing experience.
I:63800;235;Oh, are you sophisticated and pride yourself on having a higher sense of artistic appreciation than others?
I:63800;236;souled thing, and write glowing reviews about the masterful use of dark and light, surrealism, etc.
I:63800;237;The only reason there's so many positive reviews is that nobody in their right mind (truly right mind) would think of watching it if they had heard much about it, and wouldn't watch much of it if they didn't know what they were getting into and started watching it.
I:63800;238;It might also be good for those contemplating having sex with someone they are not married to .
I:63800;239;Human nature is compelling and contradictory sometimes simultaneously.
I:63800;240;It manages to make more sense when you have seen it all in one.
I:63800;241;Some films target your mind and seek to educate you.
I:63800;242;Some films expect you to put your mind on hold and pull for a purely emotional reaction.
I:63800;243;A few films (darn few these days) seek to stimulate both the mind and the heart together.
I:63800;244;This framework gives the events a dream.
I:63800;245;Personally, I had numerous emotional reactions to the film, some of which developed gradually.
I:63800;246;Anyone claiming to know the """"true meaning"""" of the film is either deluded or putting you on."""
247;Watch it, see what it does to you and learn from it.
248;There are very few movies in existence that can ofer that.
249;Steven Wright could probably come up with the best review of all.
250;One of the most important movies of its time.Yeah, right.
251;the best way to attend a showing of Eraserhead is to take your own chair and place it near the front of the auditorium facing the crowd.
252;"Observing the audience reactions to this ""interesting"" film is a much more enjoyable and enlightening way to spend 90 minutes than watching what is on the screen."
253;kind of intriguing in spots.
254;otherwise, a good Friday Night film.
255;This is one STRANGE movie.
256;i actually have a friend who likes this film.
257;He appears to be a sane, intelligent human being other than that.
258;It's one of a kind.

262;Anyway, the remastering is beautiful.
263;I also encourage you to get this for the Lynch interview that is included here.
264;And from all I can gather, people who have worked with him love him.

269;As well, Eraserhead captures the spirit of the times, dark, industrial and depressing.

274;This is quite possibly the strangest movie I have ever seen, however, its also David Lynch's first movie, so its justified.

278;Well worth viewing, but keep an open mind.
279;See all the previous reviews for the details.
280;finally a month ago I found it on Amazon.
281;I definitely recommend this film to any horror/sci fi fan.
282;such a weird, timeless classic!

288;It will stick with you in the way art is supposed to.
289;It's a shining example of what can happen when a director cracks the door open just enough to glimpse his vision, but not enough to fully grasp the story.
290;Later, we're introduced to the world of Henry.
291;He's a Nobody, the anti.
292;Henry obliges and finds that Mary's family puts the 'funk' in dysfunction.
293;This is one of the best scenes of the entire film.
294;This film is a gift to the audience.
295;Heres the answers to your life and the reality of it.
296;This is perhaps David Lynch's best film.
297;It is a surreal story filmed in haunting black and white.
298;It is a horrific and funny story.
299;whether taken as a movie with a message or as just the representation of a surreal, nightmarish world, this film is truly unique and is one of the most perfect cinematic films ever made.
300;If you want to see a good, wierd David Lynch movie, watch Blue Velvet.
301;Eraserhead is bleak, horrifying, strange, sad, funny (in a weird way) and in this writers humble opinion one of the best films ever made.
302;I love a lot of DAVID LYNCH'S work,but i've never seen this film!
303;I recently viewed it on the SUNDANCE channel 2 weeks ago,it was the most weird,strange,hard to understand,and craziest film i've ever seen from DAVID LYNCH but I actually found the film to be somewhat entertaining!
304;I first found this movie from a friend, a movie fan.
305;Twenty years of my life has done this:1.
306;I understand the movie better.2.
307;classic, yet not intended to stand the test of time.
308;Movie buffs will love it, people on drugs will love it, Lynch fans will love it.
309;"i should also add that you couldn't make me give up my copy of Eraserhead for anything
I:63800;310;It is fascinating but not fulfilling.
I:63800;311;there is great deal of surrealism and absurdism in this lynch classic.
I:63800;312;What he(and we the audience)see is all his surreal and bizarre interpretation of what happened in his own reality.
I:63800;313;There's definitely symbolism here and, as most other Lynch films, it makes sense, even if only on some deeply subconscious level.
I:63800;314;Was it an interesting ride?
I:63800;315;But did I enjoy it?
I:63800;316;Shindler's List wasn't enjoyable to watch either"
317;while it's also Bizarre with a capital B, there are nevertheless an original and imaginative plot, a rich world, and intriguing characters.
318;If you want to see social commentary, deeper underlying meaning, and/or startling revelations, you probably will.
319;Hide it away and bring it back out a couple hundred years from now, and no one is going to understand it.
320;True art does not need manuals or explanations, it speaks for itself.
321;It survives the test of time.
322;Yeah that sort of word gets bandied around a lot.
323;"If something is just a little bit weird, it deemed "" surreal ""This film however really is surreal and while I don't want to give anything away ( how can I?"
324;If I were to describe this you'd probably think I was a bit cuckoo ), it is brilliantly acted.
325;I remember watching this the first time in a friend's house.
326;I had to force myself to finish this movie.
327;I watch a movie for a story and to be entertained.
328;While I watched this movie I figured that somewhere along the line, something had to make sense.

330;Grow up guys, its just a movie.
331;"the Movie ""Brazil"" was also disturbing, but at least the cinemetography was a rich visual tapestry."
332;A mind is too precious a commodity to putrify.
333;There are nightmarish aspects of the movie, sure, mainly the Lady in the Radiator (maybe it's just organ music that gives me a Carnival of Souls nightmare vibe), but I thought it was a hilarious movie.
334;Hypnotic, fascinating, you just *have* to see what weird or funny thing happens next.
335;its a film about industrys greed and socioty suffocation,supressing the human values of life.
336;i think everyone should see it once just so u can spot the eraserheads today,and have some understanding of how and whythey end up being as they are.
337;*** This comment may contain spoilers ***I finally saw this legendary cult favorite, Lynch's first feature shot in black and white with the most unusual sound effects and arresting visuals for the first time and I had rather unusual reaction to the film.
338;I found the movie hysterically funny and I laughed for the first 80 minutes of it (I saw the 88 minutes long version).
339;You've got your good things.
340;The dinner at X family with the carving of chicken scene in particular is a comical masterwork.

344;Some find it very funny, and it is true that there are moments when it displays an unexpectedly wacky sense of humore.

346;a great deal of the film's images consist of not.
347;He has, or perhaps dreams, of a sexual encounter with the woman who lives across the hall.
348;This is not a strange movie, if you watch it with that in mind you won't see it for what it is: a smart, funny, satyrical, complex, disturbing, and beautiful masterpiece.
349;the use of B/W film is great.
350;Eraserhead is a remarkably eloquent expression of contemporary anomie.
351;This film goes well with Coppola's Koyanisqaatsi.
352;I think he's one of the greatest filmmakers in the history of cinema.
353;All I know is that Eraserhead is art.
354;Anyone who is interested in the possibilities of film should see this astounding work, David Lynch's first, and in my opinion one of the all.
355;In this case the film is what the viewer makes of it .
356;Eerie, haunting, unsettling and memorable, Eraserhead is nevertheless extremely funny in parts, which keeps the viewer off.

359;Although it was met with mixed reviews, I just loved the whole visual appearance and the mysterious, brooding atmosphere of the film.

372;"After the raising of John Carpenter (Dark star) and Nicholas Roeg (Performance) in the early seventies, the figure of the weird presence of Lynch augured for many viewers at that moment a career filled of innovative proposals
I:63800;373;the essential core of the bizarre universe of David Lynch may be found in this post.
I:63800;374;Since its release, the film achieved a cult status all around the world.
I:63800;375;It's always very interesting to see where Directors began and what they started off with.
I:63800;376;it may not be one of his best Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks Elephant man are better films but what a debut what truly and a original concept.
I:63800;377;His work still innovates and inspires today without bowing down to Hollywood happy endings or flinching a muscle to ease up atall.

I:63800;383;Wow, the dad at the table seems dangerously enthusiastic.

I:63800;385;Kind of like dinner at my place LOL.
I:63800;386;now the LEFT side has alligators!
I:63800;387;Arnold has a really big action.
I:63800;388;It compiments the action on the LEFT side, strangely enough.
I:63800;389;Okay, LEFT side is done with action and almost over.
I:63800;390;See what I did there?
I:63800;391;I didn't know which movie he wanted me to review, so in an amazing display of innovation, I have created a new reviewing medium.
I:63800;392;As definitions of art go, this is pretty good.
I:63800;393;This film is never comfortable to watch"
394;One thing I have noted over the years, is the polarizing effect this film has on audiences.
395;This is memorable cinema, arguably memorable art, and for this reason will always be on the top of my favorite films.
396;The most purely deranged film ever made, meaning it's probably the best film ever made.
397;Both the story and style of the film share the traits which have made director Lynch a spokesman for the alternative and surreal in modern cinema.
398;"the very first minutes of the film show us what we can come to expect throughout the feature
I:63800;399;The film is more a mood than anything else, and a moode must be experienced rather than debated.

I:63800;404;After reading so much about this film, I finally got the chance to see it.
I:63800;405;I saw this at midnight, with my laptop and wearing headphones.
I:63800;406;It's a hypnotic, unsettling, disturbing, brilliant.
I:63800;407;Like all of Lynch's movies, Eraserhead is completely about mood, pure and simple.
I:63800;408;It's amazing how Lynch can conjure emotion from almost nothing.
I:63800;409;After viewing it, you will remember it as a dream.
I:63800;410;Like I did the first time I watched it.
I:63800;411;I'll let you watch it for yourself to agree, and spare you the details.
I:63800;412;Eraserhead, David Lynch's first feature.

I:63800;414;lynch has always concerned himself with bipolar contrasts, and """"Eraserhead"""" is no exception."""
415;it may be one of the best tricks any artist has ever played on his viewers.
416;If you like to think, especially on the existential level, see what you can make of it.
417;if you are at a poker game and you don't know who the sucker is, it's you.
418;this is how you feel after walking out of this movie (or viewing it in the comfort of your home.)
419;save your time and money, or better yet go for a nice walk in the country.
420;It is a surrealist masterpiece!
421;It's a bit of work to track it down, but definetly worth it.
422;It does have so many images that are WAY off the wall, startling, yet its well worth a look.
423;Loved the Lyle Lovetthair and that baby creature, the crying, the mysterious womenpaved the way for Blue Velvet/Twin Peaks and the many othermovies David Lynch had his hands on.
424;I love David Lynch's films, and consider him a talented and brilliant artist.
425;I am going to have to watch it again at some point to see how it strikes me now that 30 years have gone by, but my impression then was that it is a masterfully nauseating descent into a Freudian dream.
426;Tell me how many men can plumb their subconscious like that and translate it into visual imagery?
427;It's a masterpiece, without a doubt.
428;good movie you'd ever wish to see.
429;i'll say this: the film does not lack for fascinating visuals.
430;high coif that becomes a signature of the film.
431;spouting tiny chickens offered for dinner by Mr. X certainly keep your attention, as does the gorgeous neighbor across the hall that Henry lusts after.
432;The industrial sound effects, while relentless, are perfect.
433;which makes you suspect that a director who exerts such loving care on production values *must* be communicating something of worth.
434;3 stars seems right, awarded for excellent production values and fantastic imagery.
435;this is my favorite lynch film and maybe my favorite film.
436;i have seen many films, including much world cinema, classic hollywood, silent films, new wave, cult etc. and eraserhead stands out as a vital landmark.
437;the production is perfect and in fact magical, alchemical and severe.
438;"like"" in that it is more visually dynamic and overtly stylized than any mainstream film."
439;"the search for a ""secret meaning"" in eraserhead belies the fact that the film is full of meaningful instances and juxtapostitions."
440;in spite of it's dissonant nature, each moment is vital and naturally leads to the next in a curiously lyrical progression.
441;it is, however, a one of a kind movie.
442;but I find ERASERHEAD to be fascinatingly wonderful.
443;it's is unique, to say the least.
444;eRASERHEAD defies a definitive description because it taps into the inner realm of the viewer.
445;In this respect ERASERHEAD brings to mind John Waters' POLYESTER or PINK FLAMINGOS.
446;my favorite moment in the movie is the way bizarre cabaret scene performed by The Lady in The Radiator (picture left).
447;Despite the grotesque setting, the actress turns in a truly mesmerizing and emotive performance.
448;this is a great packaging of *eraserhead*.
449;and the transfer's terrific, with great sound.
450;the featurette is great, too.
451;If we were to believe that this film is nothing more than psychedelic fodder for abnormal or curious minds then we are discarding it, perhaps exalting it to an avant gard status.
452;The baby is absolutely normal.
453;They treat it like a normal child.
454;This dimension of the movie raises everyday life misfortunes and reflects social consciousness of some family issues.
455;Talking about horror effect, the Lady in Radiator is brilliant.
456;"You can't take your eyes from her
I:63800;457;It has spawned many reactions, both positive and negative.
I:63800;458;And strange minds will likely be attracted to it.
I:63800;459;I happen to admire it.
I:63800;460;I don't admire it for its result, but rather the effort put into it.
I:63800;461;Lynch took a gamble with this movie, and I praise him for that.
I:63800;462;It is evident that after watching it we come across some elaborate sets and special effects.
I:63800;463;I'm not here to defend the film, but rather the painstaking work of David Lynch for having dedicated himself to such a torrid and abominable piece of art.
I:63800;464;eRASERHEAD went through a number of revisions during it's 5 year period of conception, gestation, and birth.
I:63800;465;The inspiration for the radiator lady came from Lynch's discovery of T. m. during the time he was making the film.
I:63800;466;She represents the means to an escape from a harsh """"reality"""" into an enlightened state."""
467;Henry's mind (spirit) has left his physical body to commune with eternity.
468;What she did, was give birth to a creative genius.
469;I saw this picture in my early 20's and it changed the way I watch movies.
470;I have yet to find another motion picture that captures this element so eloquently.
471;It's as if this man got inside of Dali's head and made a motion picture out of his grey matter.
472;Also keep in mind that even the best blu.
473;My only gripe is that the disc is kept consistently spun.
474;It's constantly rumbling at full capacity.
475;It is one of the weirdest movies I have every seen.
476;It is also very inventive and disturbing.
477;According to Lynch, this is his most spiritual movie, and watching muliple viewings will illuminate the original 'weirdness.'
478;A classic which will continue to reveal new interpretations.
479;Its wierd but visually amazing just sit and watch it and you will be amazed.
480;cOMON EVERYONE WATCH ERASERHEAD its good stuff!!
481;The use of contrast in this film is exceptional.
482;I've never liked David Lynch's stuff.
483;What you get instead is a string of images that contribute to an overrall impression of the printer's world.
484;Shot in black and white, they present themselves as some of the most memorable in cinema history.
485;The true beauty of this picture is that you have to watch everything over and over again to glean more.
486;You can never really hope to 'get the point' of the work in its entirety but what you do manage to decipher in the film is worth retaining in your memory banks.
487;Definitely worth seeing at least once in your life.
488;Lynch is a master and this is the film he worked the longest on, it shows!
489;This version is very good, despite the lack of extras everyone is used to.
490;After you watch this you will be reminded of it in all of David Lynch's other movies.
491;Eraserhead is somewhat disturbing, somewhat humorous, and always bizarre, and for some people, this is enough to make it an exceptional film.
492;This black and white movie has great cinematography, an interesting sound effects track, great atmosphere, and is all around well shot.
493;Lynch definitely has his own unique style, and Eraserhead is no exception.
494;"There is no question that David Lynch has a ""vision""."
495;As his first film, Eraserhead demonstrates that he had the ability and skill to deliver this nightmarish vision to the screen very early on.
496;He is a master at manipulating viewers through minimal mise.
497;The film's technical achievements are exceptional and if you like weird movies like myself, than this is one of the crown jewels.
498;truly a groundbreaking special effect.
499;as surreal as it all is, there seems to be a lot of honesty in this film.
500;The Lady in the Radiator sings: In Heaven everything is fine, and she means it.
501;all in all, if you're more than a little bored with mainstream stuff, and are in the mood for a cult film, this is one of the best.
502;Okay, so if you've seen an actual print of this film, good for you.
503;While Lynch has recently created his masterpiece in Mulholland Drive, 'Eraserhead' is a prime example of the art of filmmaking.
504;Plus, it gives serious Lynch fans something to look for consdiering it's so hard to find.
505;Boy, this is going to be fun.
506;Watch it and come up with your own opinion.
507;First of all, David Lynch is an artist.
508;But that is the artist in Mr. Lynch.
509;The film, to me, represents good versus evil(Lady in the Radiator vs. The Seductive woman across the hall).
510;"The whole movie is, as some of the reviewers put it ""dark and eerie""."
511;Making a long story short, at the end of the movie when the control operator's levers jam, Henry is engulfed in a white, ethereal light with angelic sound as the Lady in the radiator appears and hugs Henry as if to let him know that indeed, in Heaven everything is fine!
512;This guy is either a genius or a LOON!
513;That fine line is more fine in this guy.
514;actually in regular David Lynch style.
515;U have NO idea what the movie is about yet u are drawn 2 it.
516;He comes home and his sexy neighbor (brunette) says someone called 4 him.
517;It is very industrial with huge metal clanging noises dabbled with the lull of storms and rain.
518;"These ""worms"" are crushed by this woman that could be attractive sans the ""growths"" on her cheeks as she sings this thing about heaven and arms held in tight, and constantly wearing a smile."
519;i bought this for Halloween and i have seen it before.
520;I thought I would sit back and enjoy a cult classic,as everyone claims this movie is, one Saturday afternoon.
521;The lead Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) does a wonderful job of playing a nervous misfit.
522;While I guess this may be considered visual art.
523;This is a remarkable film that does have a plot.
524;When you watch this film keep in mind the situation that Henry is in and the intense anxiety that he must be going through.
525;There are definate points in the film that are still unclear to me but the general story is well told.
526;This is a powerful example of what it's like to be insane.
527;Reality is truly distorted, and you see it through Henry's eyes and hear it through his ears.
528;I often recommend this film to my psychology students.
529;It used to be my favorite film until I came to realize I now prefer more optimistic dream.
530;my favorite film has since been Tuvalu, a film that tells its odd little story with far less dialog than Eraserhead (!)
531;but despite the bleakness, Eraserhead is packed with droll humor.
532;The film has been cleaned frame by frame.
533;the soundtrack (also restored) is also available on the website too.
534;please, feel free and do not be offended.
535;i asked one (beautiful) young black dressed lady sitting next to me, how she liked the movie .
536;she simply answered: 'wonderful .'
537;But in the end, uncovering the core of his anxiety, he is able to overcome it, as seen in the calm expression that suffuses his face as he is bathed by light in the embrace of the lady in the radiator.
538;"If you're reading this, then you've seen this movie or are at least curious what all the hype is about?The late Stanley Kubrick, the only major filmmaker Lynch has cited as a direct cinematic influence, believed that ERASERHEAD was one of the most perfect ""cinematic experiences"" created to date."
539;This movie has enjoyed success on the midnight movie circuit for years, particularly in NYC where it ran almost every night for something like five years straight.
540;In terms of rational comprehension, ERASERHEAD is the fabled big fish that remains brilliantly elusive of any attempts to capture it.
541;this movie gets better, and more humorous, every time I watch it: in my opinion .
542;"ERASERHEAD is the cinematic experience that comes the closest to capturing ""dream logic"", next to the equally brilliant WAKING LIFE."
543;If you ever get the chance, watch ERASERHEAD in a movie theater with a great sound system .
544;you will understand why Stanley Kubrick was moved enough to make his statement.
545;"It creates such a visceral landscape with its dark, peculiar selections of image and sound, that it seems to be constantly reminding you that the ""soul"" is helplessly sloshing around somewhere inside an organic bag of blood, bone, hair follicles, industrial shrapnel, dirt piles and antique radiators
I:63800;546;It is a perfect symphony of sound and image, amazing work for a first time feature film director!
I:63800;547;Not for everyone, but certainly worth a peek.
I:63800;548;Remastered sound and image, includes a few extras .
I:63800;549;I agree that this movie is unforgettable.
I:63800;550;Another unforgettable movie that I wish I had never seen.
I:63800;551;Only in that sense could it ever be considered the """"cult classic"""" that it has evidently become."""
552;I saw part of the scene where they had the chicken on tv many years ago and i liked what i saw.
553;i think the character Henry was interesting + i liked the strange atmosphere.
554;I liked theshocked facial expressions Henry made.
555;I was surprised how good it looked.
556;I think close ups shots looked good and detailed.
557;that baby who has many close ups looked detailed and sharp.
558;You basically can count all of them on 1 hand.
559;The dialog sounded mostly clear and fine tomy ears.
560;There was also some surprisingly good bass in a few scenes.
561;I think it was a pretty good BD edition byCapelight Pictures.
562;FANTASTIC transfer, sounds great, looks great!
563;A must for any cult cinema collection.
564;There need to be more films like this!
565;Fans of lynch will notice that this film is his most extreme, difficult, and best.
566;Easily the strangest movie I have seen.
567;I watched the american version I got from the public library and it's completely a better version.
568;I love all the strange and unusual characters.
569;My favorite character still has to be the kid who looks like a crying loaf of french bread.
570;Just sit back and enjoy!
571;this is one of the most profoundly disturbing movies I've ever tried to watch.
572;David Lynch's debut is definitely something everyone should see, are they interested in artistic cinema.
573;Eraserhead is tough to explain.
574;I love it, but find it hard to watch at times.
575;I think that David Lynch did a great job with the imagery, sounds, etc.
576;David Lynch's surreal masterpiece ERASERHEAD, is in my humble opinion the most personal 90 minutes of celluloid ever created.
577;"As with many of his other films, theories abound about this ""nightmare on film,"" and it seems people have more fun dissecting (no pun intended) the imagery and symbols than actually watching the film."
578;It's certainly not enjoyable to watch, or entertaining by any stretch of the imagination, but it is compelling, engrossing, and disturbing.
579;But again, like with many of Lynch's films.
580;especially the recent MULHOLLAND DRIVE.you'd have to be David Lynch to fully understand everything that takes place or is shown, and that's what makes his movies so intriguing.
581;Let's hope the rumors are true and that this will finally be available in the very near future.
582;so it was with interest and forty.
583;eight year old eyes and ears that I sat through my second viewing of Lynch's most famous art film.
584;"Oh, and this film might very well put people off on the whole ""having kids"" thing."
585;i may even watch it again sometime, if I live long enough.
586;Personally, I loved David Lynch's first ever feature.
587;If you want to get into surrealism, you should start with something much lighter and to progress your way up to films such as these.
588;All in all, a good, disturbing surrealist horror, for those who enjoy that.
589;Eraserhead is a very original and provocative film (though not for everyone) and it arrived in good shape.
590;The movie could have been shortened but it was visually unforgettable.
591;Horrifying in the fullest sense, without the sense of beauty and wonder that comes through in Twin Peaks at its finest.
592;If you love art and great cinema!
593;This was a strange.yet good.
594;Overall, a great David Lynch film.
595;What you don't realize is That that is the point, wether art makes you happy or upsets you, it's done it's job.
596;I recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys stepping out of their element for ninety minutes or so, don't be afraid !
597;This movie is on reputable movie critics' top 20 lists for a reason.
598;Yes in heaven everything is fine!I absolutely love this film, it is in my top 10 list at NO.2.
599;it has a deep and profound resonating tone of wit and strange mind bending imagination that I love.Yes Mr Lynch owes much to German Surrealist movie makers and artists, but he brings something more to this genre that almost defies description.
600;the rest is purely up to the eye of the beholder and there in lies the genius.
601;if you love David Lynch and love surreal mind melting cinema, this is for you.
602;I should note that I have enjoyed all of David Lynch's work that I've seen to date and Eraserhead was no exception.
603;"I would only recommend this film if you are familiar with the director and are not phased by what some may consider ""weird"" films."
604;this movie is definitely brilliant.
605;every element, both conceptual and technical is in some way meaningful.
606;Get the 2000 version which has cooler special features and a funny menu selection .
607;But Eraserhead is such a great visionary film.
608;Bizarre and grotesque, yet visionary.
609;I never really understood what it is that I like about this film, and that is what I like about this film!
610;I've also had the idea of turning a dream into a film(or a film into a dream)and can see that David Lynch had that same thought almost forty years ago and pulls it off perfectly.
611;It came out a few months ago, and man is it a sweet print.
612;watching david lynch's 'eraserhead', is a lot like taking your soul and throwing it out of this world.
613;if the term surreal means anything, well, square it and then round.you'll get the picture.
614;i, for one, found it to be extraordinary, and im glad someone took something so stellar, and made it into not even something, just.
615;it's a catch.22, and in the end, nobody will ever get it.
616;the movie is shot in grainy black and white, and is constanly filled with sound.
617;the story unfolds like a dream.
618;and probably actually includes the dreams of the main character as well.
619;A terrific organ music soundtrack underscores much of the movie, and its images, although black and white, will blaze themselves into your brain.
620;when my younger brother was in high school, he got obsessed with this film.
621;this is definitely David Lynch's best in my opinion.
622;It's a great movie to have on in the background of a party, or to watch by yourself late at night.
623;It's a classic puzzle that no amount of viewings could ever solve, and a fun, wild, weird ride.
624;I love David Lynch and I love this film.
625;I own most of Lynch's films like Blue Velvet, Mulholland Dr., Inland Empire etc etc, but this is my favorite film from Lynch, and I love it.
626;"Lynch captures the pain of pubescence in a bitter sweet ""song of thyself."
627;Go into this one with an open mind, and don't spend too much time trying to figure out its ultimate meaning.
628;That way you'll have a good weekend worth of bizarre film entertainment that you'll never forget!
629;Eraserhead is the greatest film ever made.
630;It displays the best use of the cinematic medium thus far.
631;eraserhead manages to move that which exists only on the inside directly into a form that we can all experience.
632;David Lynch managed to achieve this incredible, super.
633;Watching this film gives you the overwhelming feeling that you are witnessing one of man's greatest artistic achievements.
634;And that's exactly what this is .
635;one of the greatest human creations of all time.
636;Only then will you be able to give the film the attention it demands of you.
637;This movie gets better with each viewing.
638;A fascinating one of a kind experience, but it sure won't be for everyone's taste!
639;one of the greatest visuals of all time!
640;scarier than any horror movie!
641;But to get a good copy of Eraserhead, you have to go to DavidLynch.
642;I got mine in a week or so, and it looks very good (they put a lot of work into getting the details just right) and has some nice extras.
643;If you are going to see his movie, he wants you to see it in order.
644;An absolutely twisted and deep film.
645;Lynch's first and possibly best work.
646;But if you like intelligent movies, something that'll make you think, then this is for you.
647;David Lynch is a genius and this is one of his best films.
648;This is one of the most haunting and beautifully made movies I think that's ever been made.
649;I think this movie deserves a premier place in cinematic history as the most visually and symbolically rich film of the latter half of the 20th century.
650;It's a masterpiece that I believe is duplicated in Lynch's recent movie Lost Highway.
651;Both movies take place within the mind of the main characters.
652;In the end Eraserhead is by far the better movie and the better story because it was ground breaking.
653;It surpasses the scale for sure.
654;"Henry, our hapless hero, marries into a family that makes the fine folks in ""Two Thousand Maniacs"" look like the Cleavers."
655;yeah, that kind of movie.
656;This is a GORGEOS print, of one of the greatest movies of all time.
657;The interplay of light and shadow is closer to visual expressionism (I always hear people call it surrealism.
658;"but I think it's closer to ""Caligari"" myself)and many of the cool effects that Lynch used here showed up in the beautiful ""Elephant Man."""
659;Anyone who is a fan of surrealistic film, or strange minding.
660;bending experiences in general, will love this film and view it over and over.
661;see addition to your video library.
662;Many influential filmmakers rank this as one of their favorite films and after you view it you'll wonder why you waited so long to see it.
663;A good title for this pseudo.
664;especially when it's a cult movie about which people are wildly enthusiastic.
665;I find it highly interesting the reaction that this film provokes .
666;So is it a classic?
667;the symbolic imagery is kind of open to interpretation, although it seems as though the movie's theme generally revolves around a fear of fatherhood.
668;i can't really explain what makes this movie my favorite, but I feel like it touches something deep inside of me, a gritty intensity that pulls me in like no other movie.
669;length film is a truly original work of art.
670;"The plot is simple enough
I:63800;671;The ensuing events and details that unfold defy any paltry explanation I could give.
I:63800;672;Suffice to say, the viewer is in for a wildly surreal ride (or multiple rides"
673;jack Nance delivers a performance that is right on key and somehow lends credibility to the surrounding nightmarish circumstances.
674;He conveys a great deal without words, which is good, since dialogue is exceedingly sparse.
675;I bought this movie because I love David Lynch.
676;The earlier reviewer is right: Along with anything else one might say about Eraserhead, it is a loving homage to German Expressionism.
677;"That ominous shadow and name felt perfectly David Lynch!If you enjoyed Eraserhead, keep your eyes open for ""Der Testament Des Dr. Mabuse"" I wholeheartedly recommend it ."
678;it is still full of eerie atmosphere and creepiness that will delight any Lynch fan.
679;It has its own unique place, and there are some who will appreciate and be receptive, and there will be others who will not get the point and write caustic reviews on Amazon.
680;"statements such as ""the Straight Story and Elephant Man were brilliant movies"" can just as easily be refuted."
681;"David Lynch is an artist
I:63800;682;I like it, I stand by it, I vouch for it.
I:63800;683;There are a plethora of other movies with prettied moral lessons or that focus on the 'good' points of humanity.
I:63800;684;not every movie has to make you feel good about your life.
I:63800;685;it moves a liitle slow,but i loved it.
I:63800;686;wormish creatures that appear during periods of the film.
I:63800;687;i loved the constant sounds of the film.
I:63800;688;Right from the start I was interested in Henry(Jack Nance).
I:63800;689;This music perfectly enhances the atmosphere of this scene.
I:63800;690;henry's girlfriend, her mother and father, the sitting round at the dinner table.
I:63800;691;But the interview is superb!
I:63800;692;I learned watching this and listening to Mr. Lynch speak what a wonderful story teller he is.
I:63800;693;This entire extra bonus feature interview was a whole evenings watching all by itself.
I:63800;694;This surrealist masterpiece by David Lynch is in my Top 10 List of Strange Films.
I:63800;695;It also has strong absurdist elements that are sort of funny.
I:63800;696;I have to be in just the right mood for it.3.
I:63800;697;Visually and sonically, its about a man who lives in an industrial dreamscape where it is never sunny and where nothing nice ever happens.4.
I:63800;698;The plot has something to do with this man, Henry, who may have gotten his girlfriend pregnant.
I:63800;699;What I just described above doesnt even come close to explaining what happens in the movie.
I:63800;700;Despite being in my personal Hall of Fame, this is a movie that I dont really recommend to anyone.
I:63800;701;mcGoohan's removal is the most telling of the two events.
I:63800;702;There are those of us with theories .
I:63800;703;it's also the funniest film.
I:63800;704;henry, by Jack 'Chaplin' Nance is enthralling.
I:63800;705;us, family life as Lynch sees it, that gives the comedy its snap and edge.
I:63800;706;All the best serial killers motives are in their dreams and your appendix can randomly kill you.
I:63800;707;we're right on the edge, every hour of every day.
I:63800;708;apocalyptic vision of a man without memory, alienated from others and ultimately from himself.
I:63800;709;I will never, ever forget this David Lynch classic, and am thrilled to be able to finally own it.
I:63800;710;It is a great movie for debate, confusion, and some laughter.
I:63800;711;Through brilliant sound design, fantastic black and white photography, and the strangest of subjects on which to focus his camera, Lynch has created a fascinating, unnerving tone in this movie.
I:63800;712;This film sticks with you, haunting your mind for days after you view ERASERHEAD.
I:63800;713;It is one of the most interesting tales of a movie getting made I've ever heard.
I:63800;714;this film also started the tradition of movie houses screening cult flicks at midnight, it actually premiered with a midnight screening!
I:63800;715;Praise doesnt get much higher than that.
I:63800;716;As an artist who is well versed in surrealism, I find it fascinating to watch.
I:63800;717;Would a sweet and sentimental story, filmed this way have been as effective?
I:63800;718;It is a masterpiece of horrific bizarreness, shot in such a way as to emphasize the negative.
I:63800;719;Now I talk about it every chance I get.
I:63800;720;The droning soundtrack adds to the mood of claustrophobia.
I:63800;721;Full marks to Eraserhead for its unconventional perspective.
I:63800;722;I like David Lynch, dancing midgets and all.
I:63800;723;I gave it two stars as homage to other David Lynch work I enjoyed, including Mulholland Drive and Twin Peaks.
I:63800;724;Eraser head is a brilliant film that was the start of an amazing director, David Lynch!Totally dark, and innovative in the use of graphics and special effects, it is a must see for any Lynch fan.
I:63800;725;This film is a potent intoxicating elixir of a film that totally deserves to be appreciated by the few of the audience that truly can!
I:63800;726;David Lynch's first film, Eraserhead, is a very odd beast, a cinematic experience on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey or 8 1/2.
I:63800;727;It's heavy on the symbolism (one of most overrated aspects of art), but the images are creepy and quite breathtaking actually.
I:63800;728;it's one of the very movies that's heavy of symbolism that works.
I:63800;729;It's still a little pretentious (as most Lynch movies, especially Mulholland Drive), but unlike the average """"art"""" movie that has no atmosphere, this one is very immerse and creates a world that you will not want to leave, and will enjoy the whole ride for it's 90 minute running time."""
730;From the creepy images, to the stunning atmosphere and immerse world, it's a great movie to watch alone, at midnight, with good speakers.
731;It will immerse you into the world of this movie.
732;"According to him, this movie is what he was experiencing in Philly at the time, ""a dream of dark and troubling things"", and he has also added that this is most spiritual movie (as there was a bible verse that, according to him, fulfilled his own vision)."
733;Hopefully he might one day say what it is about, but for now, it just leaves us to make our own interpretation.
734;This movie isn't merely a movie, it's a cinematic experience.
735;Few movies out there have as much immerse atmosphere and surreal images, this is the reason why surreal can sometimes be breathtaking.
736;Further backed by this is a fantastic sound design work, and the movie would be lost without it.
737;and really, that's the final cement of Eraserhead's watch.
738;Despite all of the symbolic elements of the film, taking the whole thing literately works extremely well, perhaps even moreso than symbolically.
739;But literately, it just works like a surreal dream, an otherworldly world like no other.
740;Given all of the creepy images, the atmosphere, the sound design, and everything else listed above, taking it all literately gives you one of the most unique experiences ever put onto film.
741;And that is why this movie continues to compel to this day.
742;It's down right uncomfortable, but the viewer can still grasp onto shards of beauty.
743;without question, Lynch has created a virtually flawless piece of cinematography.
744;Everything has a place, even if the place is without concrete definition.
745;this film certainly is a masterpiece .
746;a definition of cinematic art.
747;It's subtle but intensely powerful.
748;It will affect you and how you react to each scene.
749;with that stated, the acting is captivating in a minimalist way.
750;But if you can watch it without going mad, you will discover that there is alot of metaphors and symbols that make the movie more fascinating and fun with every time you watch it.
751;This movie is filled with wonderful imagery, beautiful cinematography and also appeals to the cult.
752;Watch it and love it.
753;I finally got a chance to view this much.
754;This is David Lynch's film school final project, and is legendary for its humor, bleakness and impressive special effects for The Baby.
755;It takes a very special type of personality to enjoy this movie .
756;if you didn't like Blue Velvet for its weirdness, stay FAR away from this one!
757;You have to focus on every frozen moment and capture the essence of feeling of every moment that you view scenes from Eraserhead.
758;I fully recommend this film for the open minded and thought pro.
759;This is without a doubt one of the most amazing movies ever created.
760;Its visually amazing and its the expierence you have while watching this that will get you to either love it or hate it.
761;It is escapist entertainment but so much more, David Lynch created something really unique with Eraserhead.
762;All in all one of the most strange but beautiful films ive ever seen, and I think everbody should see it atleast once.
763;If you answered yes to either of these questions then this film is definitely NOT for you.
764;well, this film still might not be for you.
765;eraserhead is an experiment in patience (on the viewer's part.)
766;I don't know about you, but my dreams are more interesting than this.
767;since this film is about 1 quarter interesting and 3 quarters boring, I give it 1.5 stars, plus .5 stars for a good job on the baby.
768;well I guess you COULD find this movie funny.
769;Lynch really took a knife and fork to our most visceral impulses here, dealing with a cinematic language informed by those memories formed before the mastery of speech has had an opportunity to suppress other senses.
770;or beautifully hideous, rich in an aural and visual language that must be recaptured in order to thoroughly experience this film.
771;I'm very glad to see many likening this to a dream sequence or experience.
772;A brilliantly bizarre work, it does include a lot of putrefaction and body fluids so it may be not for everyone.
773;But those are things radically fundamental to human life, and that is a theme in which Lynch revels.
774;"There is a fine line between ""Genius"" and Insanity."
775;that being said, this is an interesting watch.
776;To my surprise, that actually worked really well.
777;Trying to piece together the meaning behind all the bizarre occurences, the soundtrack, the imagery: all of these are very appealling to the right type of person.
778;"Most of the time I prefer very ""specific"" colors, used in an artistic fashion."
779;The contrast in Eraserhead, though, is really quite interesting, even striking in some places.
780;white films, in a very good way.
781;line: If you're into surrealism (really into it, not just pretending to look cool) you will probably find something to enjoy in this.
782;This is easily one of the most disturbing films ever made, it's David Lynch's best work and is easily one of the best films ever made.
783;its so beautiful and such an experience to watch!
784;It is a mood piece, for want of a better term.
785;A visual poem, which depends on what the viewer brings to the interpretation as much as what appears on the screen.
786;You may be surprised and enlightened at what meanings you find in it.
787;the cinematography is stunning, not beautiful in any traditional meaning of that term, but arresting: you simply cannot turn your head away.
788;Just keep that in mind.
789;"seeing it on a small screen
I:63800;790;viewing one of the 2nd.
I:63800;791;already familiar with """"Elephant Man"""" and/or """"Blue Velvet,"""" both of which combine all of the visual, aural, and thematic elements of """"Eraserhead"""" with topnotch production values."""
792;The area in which Lynch strikes me as inarguably inventive if not innovative is in the use of the soundtrack to convey narrative and emotional meaning.
793;"Whereas Welles used reverberation in conjunction with deep focus to convey the sense of space separating human beings, Lynch employs much ""white noise"" to take us into an ""inner space"" of expectation, anxiety, and dread."
794;"Put another way, he's a master at recording the ""silence"" that, as Robert Frost puts it in ""Desert Places,"" scares us all."
795;"The ""natural"" wood of the pencils is parodied by their assembly."
796;In that respect, human identity along with what I've just written and the film itself are all extremely tenuous and erasable.
797;His bold deviation from the norm is the draw of his work for me.
798;Eraserhead is definitely a film that fits right in with the rest of his work.
799;The piece is thoughtful, odd, of course, and memorable.
800;Lynch's later films are more engaging, but this one is definitely important.
801;If you're a Lynch fan, you've got to see it.
802;if you like the art of film, you will most likely need to see Eraserhead at least once.
803;There are cinematic masterpieces, and there are films that really make you feel the producer knows how to use film to its fullest.
804;Manos, The Hands of Fate is much more watchable than this.
805;i get Brian Eno and ambient/atmosphere music is so you will use it as a background along with your imagination to create your own inner experience.
806;i find Memento a brilliant piece of work, really making me forget I am watching a film.
807;I think Videodrome is wonderful and compelling.
808;make sure you can watch something else.
809;Its definitely weird but worth watching.
810;David Lynch is a genius.
811;His visual imagery, while often simple and stark is also awe inspiring.
812;He uses light and shadow with music and sound to create mood like no one else.
813;Surreal twists of fate and bizarre happenings mark all of his work.
814;He took all of that creative brilliance and changed television forever with Twin Peaks.
815;I think his most lasting gift is that it always means whatever you want it to.
816;eraserhead is a masterpiece, creating for us a lonely, dark, industrial world of looming shadows and ominous stretches of silence peppered with clever twists of plot and dialouge.
817;It is an introduction to the world of David Lynch, rich with all the promise of the filmaker's career that it ushered in.
818;Perhaps one of the most atmospheric movies ever made it stands alone as a classic in a genre it created.
819;Eraserhead is, without a doubt, one of the best and most disturbing films I've ever had the pleasure of watching.
820;It was written, produced, and directed by the great David Lynch, and was his directorial debut, released in 1977.
821;Eraserhead is a true cinematic gem and one of the most original films I've ever seen.
822;Overall Eraserhead is a great surrealist film that would make directors such as Luis Bunuel and Alejandro Jodorowsky envious and I can definitely see why Stanley Kubrick enjoyed it so much, and the influence it had on his film, The Shining.
823;As far as interpretations on this film go, it definitely varies.
824;In the end, regardless of how you interpret the film, it remains a thoroughly original, thought.
825;David Lynch created a true masterpiece with Eraserhead, and it's the first film I've seen of his and the reason why he's my favorite director.
826;Whenever someone asks me what the weirdest movie I've ever seen is, I always mention Eraserhead.
827;i'm proud to say that Eraserhead is one of my all time favorite movies.
828;Everything about it is dream like, nightmarish, and surreal, making it one of the most unique experiences one will ever encounter in cinema.
829;You must see it to really understand it.
830;It is up to the audience to figure out what all of the symbolism means.
831;It is easily the weirdest movie ever made, and it can be disturbing to certain viewers.
832;bottom line, whether you love it or hate it, Eraserhead is definately worth viewing.
833;The meaning behind it is up to the viewer to decide.
834;It is a beautiful and hilarious one.
835;a. kind film that stands up to Lynch's best work.
836;and the sound design may be even more amazing.
837;Lynch did an incredible job with this remaster.
838;screen interview with him is a joy to watch.
839;Lynch is an Original and Eraserhead is a cinematic Treasure.
840;This dark vision of life comes from DAvid Lynch, the master of dark visions.
841;I recommend it with a caveat .
842;Watching a David Lynch film is an experience, this one in particular takes you into the deep chasm of a surrealistic netherworld.
843;Eraserhead truly is a bizarre and beautiful film.
844;visual and audio transfers are excellent!
845;Eraserhead is another cult classic that has a following.
846;though I didn't care for the film, I appreciate it for its originality.
847;The actions of the characters are classic and unforgettable, as is the film.
848;He makes films that he wants to make, not something the mainstream would praise him for, and I respect him for that.
849;A for originality, but I'd never sit through it again.
850;Additionally, the sound is as great as it was when I first watched it.
851;It's beautiful, mysterious, haunting, and challenging.
852;The extra features are incredibly interesting and worth a look as well.
853;David Lynch always gave great interviews.
854;Not completely understanding the film in high school, this second time around was a real treat for me as my tastes in film have developed greatly.
855;Eraserhead is a piece of art that combines the imagination of Lynch, the style of the painter Francis Bacon, and the technique of the late director Kubrick.
856;"eraserhead isn't simply a movie
I:63800;857;I wept for the charcters and the creativity that was delivered.
I:63800;858;If you seek both inspiration and sensationalistic imgagination, watch Eraserhead.
I:63800;859;I am surprised that this film seems to be embraced by the mainstream.
I:63800;860;me, as a simpleton I pretty much just enjoy the dark visuals and sort of apply them to my own dreams and experiences.
I:63800;861;Whether it's your thing or not, Lynch has created a rather unique film.
I:63800;862;That's quite accurate, coz it does play out like one.
I:63800;863;I'm not gonna sit here and tell you this is a great movie.
I:63800;864;If anyone calls you """"unintelligent"""" for not """"getting"""" or enjoying Eraserhead, you can always be happy with the fact that you're at least not a snobby, uptight prick."""
865;A quiet, shy, easily minipulated young man with a strange taste in hair styles.
866;The story then flashes to Henery's place where Mary and the baby are living.
867;But keep in mind that it's one of thoes movies that grows on you the more you see it as all cult classics are I guess
868;Amazing film, I'd definitely recommend it.
869;David Lynch is an absolute genius.
870;"Packaged beautifully in a 8"" x 8"" box with a nice 20 page booklet (quite big, actually), I don't believe I've seen a cleaner."
871;the hottest day of that year.
872;[Laughs] That's a good one.
873;all enough to even have those rice crispies guys in full blush.
874;but after seeing the film for the first time, who, in the right state of mind, WOULD be fully satisfied with THAT?!
875;And finally, a very informative brand new hour.
876;well, for such a rich price of $.
877;That's right, just cut 'em up like regular chickens.
878;This has got to be one of the most tripped out films that I have ever seen.
879;I was greatly disturbed by this film.
880;It totally creeped me out, and the grainy black and white color of the film is totally effective, as are the music and sound effects.
881;see this movie and see what I mean.
882;It will haunt your dreams.
883;in heaven, everything is fine.
884;Sounds familiar, but Lynch does make it very interesting.
885;"Eraserhead is a film which challenges the intellect to challenge itself
I:63800;886;The best I can do is this: We have the protagonist .
I:63800;887;that's good enough"
888;"film spirit, give ""Eraserhead"" a go."
889;Each box has an outer sleeve (one for Eraserhead, one for The Short Films of David Lynch), and both boxes have a larger sleeve that holds both.
890;i actually had no problem and found it strangely charming.
891;It is a piece of art.
892;The movie you are watching here is like 'a piece of art that has to be viewed to be understood'.
893;Eraserhead is the other film that excels in sound.
894;Birth and repressed sexuality thrive throughout the film, from suckling puppies to the seductive appeal of the `beautiful girl across the hall' and a mother.
895;direction and cinematography are brilliant throughout, though the climax is the ultimate extension of a film that borders on darker, extremely unpleasant aspects of reality.
896;You must see his other great films also.
897;I own 'Eraserhead 2000', it has been cleaned and remastered and has an extra long interview with Lynch himself (talking about filming Eraserhead).
898;In reality David Lynch takes us on this wild look into a very strange person's life.
899;It is bizarre, brilliant and surreal.
900;For that matter the whole movie is surreal.
901;This is a movie worth owning.
902;In the realm of surrealist film Lynch has more than proven himself as a definitive leader with this picture.
903;It's got to be the ugliest movie I've ever seen.
904;Eraserhead is David Lynch's first and arguably best film.
905;Eraserhead is an honest cult/midnight film in every way.
906;The integrity and vision of this film is so strong that's its influence still grows today.
907;Watch this film today, watch this film in 5 years, and watch this film in 20 years.
908;Every time you do one thing will be guaranteed: you will be amazed.
909;thats the best way for me to describe this psychotic,highly disturbing masterpiece.
910;those who are fans of his/extreme off the wall films will take away/interpret this probably in another way.
911;but yet,thats what adds to its greatness.
912;America has gained its independence and things are going great.
913;They are young and want to make the right choice.
914;"One of the greatest cult films in American film history, David Lynch's 1977 debut 'Eraserhead' was five years in the making
I:63800;915;it's his most personal, deftly crafted picture"
916;This movie/film is unlike anything I've ever seen or experienced.
917;Needless to say, this film has, from my first viewing to most recent, held up as probably one of the greatest films I have ever seen, of any kind.
918;"demand"" service, I have to say that my positive feelings about it originally experienced, have only been refreshed and reinforced, big time."
919;In my past memories, I had and have always considered this one of the best films I've ever seen, but again experiencing it again and again (thanks to on.
920;demand), I found so much more value and meaning in all the strange weirdness of it all, that I'd really have to say that this film is at least in my top 20 movies of all time.
921;What makes it deserve such a spot?
922;But here's my two cents worth, for what it's worth.
923;While very low budget, it is proof positive that with imagination and vision, a little money can go a long way in creating a truly eternal, superior work of art, film.
924;"demand,"" seeing it again after so many years just reinforced my love for it."
925;In other words, while I had loved it before, viewing it again only added to my appreciation for it.
926;For the truth is, this is a really one.
927;"a. kind cinematic treat, and deserves more than almost any other film, repeated viewings to ""get"" the most from it."
928;But many movies are like that, including so many critically acclaimed films.
929;"Even if one doesn't truly ""get it,"" but who watches it to the end, there is a great reward here in much, much after."
930;For no matter what one's station in life, in no matter what time period of one's life, this is something that will stick with you, for life.
931;Think about a lot of things and challenge the intelligent viewer, about a lot of things, some a lot more comfortable to think about than others.
932;For me, it is a horror film, a comedy, a sci.
933;fi work, an experimental try, and so, so much more.
934;It is really one of a kind, was when I first saw it and studied it, and remains to present day.
935;Even if you see it once, you need to see it at least once more.
936;my own interpretation of the film is that it is a satirical and comedic view of a strange man in a strange land (20th, 21st century) who finds himself in a hell.
937;If one gets it, on any level, and one's budget can afford it, it certainly is a must.
938;a stranger and more delightfully disturbing, enlightening Hollywood, linear movie you will probably never experience, and I think everyone should see it at least once, if not several times after to fully appreciate the genius here of David Lynch's finest work.
939;By far one of the best black white indy flicks I have ever seen, this movie combines psychologically disturbing images with a great song about heaven.
940;Some group sponsored it and charged $1 admission.
941;I don't think this guy knew what the hell he just sat through and, figuring if he didn't understand it, it must be genius.
942;"What makes this film work is the black and white color format
I:63800;943;Overall, Eraserhead is quite an experience, and even manages to amuse at times.
I:63800;944;Probably not at first, but a second viewing will bring clarity to those who appreciate films depicting a psychological struggle.
I:63800;945;I highly recommend this film for someone looking for an unusual flick once in a while.
I:63800;946;This film (for me) is assimilated best with all the lights turned off, and preferably after midnight.
I:63800;947;This move has NO redeeming value whatsoever.
I:63800;948;It was one of Stanley Kubrick's favorite films, and it impressed George Lucas to the point where he asked Lynch to direct RETURN OF THE JEDI (Lynch declined, opting to direct DUNE instead).
I:63800;949;This is somewhat saddening, because the movie truly deserves more.
I:63800;950;forces Henry to marry Mary.
I:63800;951;The special effects, by Lynch himself, are extraodinary.
I:63800;952;Henry's baby, no doubt the most famous (or infamous) part of the film, is absolutely horrific.
I:63800;953;There's also a few brief snippets of carnival.
I:63800;954;style music, as well as a great musical number performed by the """"Lady in the Radiator"""", entitled """"In Heaven""""."""
955;Lynch succeeds in making a stylish, gruesome, depressing, horrifying, and yet shockingly beautiful movie which a meaning so deep (or non.
956;I was completely mesmerized throughout the film, unable to avert my attention from David Lynch's brilliant, repulsive masterpiece.
957;but it still ranks amongst the master director's finest works.
958;one of the greatest aspects of Lynch's films is that they leave it up to you to interpret them as you will.
959;Eraserhead is the weirdest film I've ever seen.
960;It beats even the strangest surreal films, such as Un Chien Andalou.
961;Now, I think it's one of the best surreal films ever made.
962;Seeing Lynch's other works since then has enabled me to see Eraserhead as his warped masterpiece.
963;the lighting and cinematography are great, and the lack of dialogue adds to the creepiness.
964;It's a wonderfully nightmarish dreamscape of the macabre world of Henry Spencer.
965;The more you watch it the more you understand it.
966;It keeps it's power each time you watch.
967;ended metaphor with the tone of a nightmare, David Lynch's debut feature combines disturbing visuals with what may be an even more disturbing sound design to create an unforgettable film that's affecting on a visceral level.
968;Fans of this should check out Jacob's Ladder, and fans of Jacob's Ladder should take it a step up and see this oddball.
969;I love it, because it is so weird.
970;Yes I know that the film is dark, disturbing and like a dream that you would not like to have but as a cinematic work of ART it is excellent!!!
971;"I hope that it is released soon to the general public so that they might experience Eraserhead in a format that is ""as good as it gets!"""
972;Thank You David Lynch for a job well done!
973;David Lynch's first movie and his best!
974;This is the movie that set the precedent for the rest of his future projects!
975;Maybe it's the best classic ever, but I can't find out.
976;I love all of Lynch's films, but Eraserhead changed the way I view cinema.
977;This is one of the greatest movies ever made.
978;he roared with laughter through the whole thing!Not at it, mind you, and it wasn't the nervous laughter of discomfort.
979;He thought it was a great stitch, a merciless funny.
980;Eraserhead was working class, laboring folk stuff.
981;since then I've seen this movie as it is and enjoy it as a first.
982;rate black comedy that makes tons and tons of sense.
983;enjoy, but try to see this landmark comedy for what it is!
984;Odd and he's very talented.
985;It teeters on the fine line between dorky and cool.
986;Lynch is a very talented director when working with the right screenplay.
987;if nothing else, you've got to see it at least once just to experience it.
988;my personal opinion is that you'll probably connect with ERASERHEAD (and with most Lynch productions) if you're the type who tends to walk on the wild side, intellectually speaking.
989;Ask the critics What's the greatest movie ever made?
990;This is THE greatest movie of all time.
991;Ok the last guy who reviewed the movie was a retard!
992;It is very symbolic, you need to understand scenes.
993;This is personally one of my favorite movies and yes it is slow paced but its only an hour and a half long!
994;"The movie is very well made, good acting, incredible cinematography and special effects (i. e. the baby) so well done it will make your skin crawl as you wonder ""Is that thing real?"""
995;would I recommend this movie?
