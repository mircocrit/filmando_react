I:291;1;Steve Martin outdoes himself in this made for family movie.
I:291;2;this is my favorite out of the two.
I:291;3;one of those movies that i can watch over and over again.
I:291;4;I love this movie so much.
I:291;5;Now my family can enjoy it together.
I:291;6;All 6 in our family ranging from age 2.40 laughed throughout the movie.
I:291;7;at that point the family pulls together in a 'awww' moment and puts aside their differences for the higher good.
I:291;8;Cheaper By The Dozen is a film that combines good laughs with a few scenes of genuine emotion to make it one of the betterfamily films of the year.
I:291;9;Bonnie Hunt does very well as the mother and all the kids do a good job of portraying the rest of the family.
I:291;10;This film even makes Ashton Kutcher look good, as he is very funny as the self.
I:291;11;A vry good and funny film for the holiday season.
I:291;12;There was a funny part, followed by another funny part, and so on.
I:291;13;tom Baker is offered a job in Chicago to coach for a college football team.
I:291;14;He and his whole family (with 12 children) move to Chicago so that Tom can ensue his career.
I:291;15;i think that the actors did an excellent job with the film.
I:291;16;This is a great family foom.
I:291;17;I have to say that family videos is his best.
I:291;18;I felt that they put much thought into who would play the characters in this movie.
I:291;19;It was brilliant that they had such recognizable teenagers playing the older parts.
I:291;20;People want to see a face they can recognize and be comfortable with.
I:291;21;We know their work and we know the deliver with their best.
I:291;22;I laughed all the way through it.
I:291;23;I loved the way they really brought an old movie into modern times.
I:291;24;It is definitely one of my favorite movies.
I:291;25;Also a bonus for you Hilary fans, she does sing some of the music in the film.
I:291;26;I like her voice so for those of you who agree with me on that it is a nice addition.
I:291;27;clean and clear, came on time and my children love to watch when it is raining or snowing.
I:291;28;I bought it for 2 reasons: Steve Martin and Tom Welling.
I:291;29;I think they did a good job.
I:291;30;In an age where few good family movies are made, this is a good family movie.
I:291;31;This guy is growing everyday as a better actor.
I:291;32;In this movie he showed that he can be funny and be the Man of Steel on TV.
I:291;33;take it from a family man of three young girls.
I:291;34;I have always loved Steve Martin.
I:291;35;this movie was funny alot i got it as soon as possible it has tom welling from smallvile hilary duff from a cinderella story and i dont know about the girl piper anyways i think everyone who loves comedy will love this movie because it has alot of comedy in it
I:291;36;Clean, fun, funny and family oriented.
I:291;37;I had to clean off the disc but it plays so its all good.
I:291;38;Such a great family movie
I:291;39;The cast works well together, even down to the smallest of toddlers, and everyone seems to be having a really good time making this film.
I:291;40;Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt are just perfectly cast, especially Hunt who I just adore, and the group of young actors, rising stars if you may, all work well to move the film along smoothly.
I:291;41;the film follows this large family as they move into a new home closer to their father's new coaching job.
I:291;42;This means that the children must start over at a new school in a new neighborhood with new friends.
I:291;43;Ashton Kutcher on the other hand makes the most of his small role and delivers a genuinely funny performance.
I:291;44;His self absorbed model boyfriend to Perabo's doting daughter is just the perfect compliment within contradiction.
I:291;45;so, in the end it may not be the perfect family film, but it's well worth the time and is a film the whole family will find amusement in, regardless of its blatant familiarity.
I:291;46;I found this movie very cute, it doesn't have a big dramatic scenes, or any evil, dark bad guy.
I:291;47;But its just a nice, funny, cute family movie.
I:291;48;This is an excellent movie for the young and the old.
I:291;49;It's incredibly moving, hilarious in just about all aspects and makes you realise just how important family is above the materialism of life.
I:291;50;the acting from the kids is surprising and sincere.
I:291;51;They are believable and really do show the emotion, which would be hard for some kids to concentrate on in a drama role, but they pull it off perfectly.
I:291;52;Little Mark Baker is just the most adorable character!
I:291;53;He'll steal your heart away.
I:291;54;On second viewing, I realised the great potential this movie really had.
I:291;55;unlike some films, they really do try to give the viewer something worthwhile to learn from and get something out of the movie.
I:291;56;"it is one movie which doesn't ever seem to grow old
I:291;57;if you're looking for lighthearted yet moving comedy with a line up of great actors and boredom.
I:291;58;ceasing potential, this is the movie for you.
I:291;59;When Kate Baker, Bonnie Hunt, gets a book deal for her chronicle of their abundant family life, she also gets drawn into a book tour, leaving Tom, Steve Martin, to run the house and cope with his new high pressure job as a football coach.
I:291;60;Naturally, chaos erupts, bring the family to the brink of meltdown.
I:291;61;"Critically, I think ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" is worth three stars, but I laughed so hard I must give it five to be honest."
I:291;62;"for a movie to be a ""good clean family movie"" there must be no adult sensuality scenes, humor every generation will appreciate, and the end of the movie must encourage family love."
I:291;63;Cheaper by the Dozen has all of that.
I:291;64;when Tom (Steve Martin) is offered his dream job, he gets the chance to make something of himself.
I:291;65;downs, and Tom rightfully wanted the best for his brood.
I:291;66;Still, the kids loved their home and friends.
I:291;67;they move north to Evanston in a beautiful home with stereotypical aloof wealthy neighbors.
I:291;68;the good job, the solid family, the wife who can explore her professional goals.
I:291;69;"His ability to pull it off is where it becomes hilarious, in the manner of ""Father of the Bride"" and ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles."
I:291;70;Not everything is realistic, and not every storyline is provided an ending.
I:291;71;family sentiment, I fully recommend it.
I:291;72;It's a funny movie that pits career choices against family wishes.
I:291;73;Great entertainment for the kids.
I:291;74;Positive pleasure to keep the kids laughing the entire movie.
I:291;75;Steve Marting is a great actor and commedian and brought this moive together by showing what it takes to be a Fatherd.
I:291;76;A movie like this may not break any new ground or shake the movie industry's fooundations, or stay in the memory long afterwards, but the trip through it to the end is one pleasureable ride.
I:291;77;He has a wife named Kate(the adorable and always great Bonnie Hunt), and a house full of kids.
I:291;78;Everything is as normal as can be until Tom gets an offer from an old friend to move to Chicago for a big coaching job and a great big new house.
I:291;79;Still, he has become quite the idol thanks to his show, and he definitley has the presence to become a najor player in feature films.
I:291;80;Steve Martin is perfect for roles like this.
I:291;81;Still, he keeps the movie afloat and that is probaby hard to do with such a large cast of mostly little kids.
I:291;82;Thank god she has a hit show!
I:291;83;He was pretty amusing in the small role he had.
I:291;84;When all is said and done, not much will be written about the movie, but it is a crowd pleasing, feel good film that is as sweet as cotton candy and tastes just as good going down.
I:291;85;Cheaper by the dozen is a movie created by a formula where you throw in talented comedic actors like Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt and twelve cute kids and just let the hilarity ensue.
I:291;86;sure, there are funny moments when Martin tries to corral the 12 crazy kids (actually eleven because one (Piper Peraboo) had already moved out and only appears a few times.
I:291;87;Her boyfriend is one of the highlights of the film).
I:291;88;this is a okay movie if you realize you will see nothing you haven't seen before.
I:291;89;Okay, this is not an academy award winner, but it is a very good family movie.
I:291;90;But this story has an important moral.
I:291;91;"If you are a mother or a father, you will relate to the conflict between the desire for big success and the desire to spend time with those you love most
I:291;92;This is a fun movie that brings this dilemma to the big screen.
I:291;93;It's just fun and sweet.
I:291;94;And I thought it was funny when the dog went for Ashton's pants.
I:291;95;I recommend you see this movie.
I:291;96;It's a good one for those family afternoon or evening movies!
I:291;97;I saw the previews for this and I thought it was going to be really funny.
I:291;98;I laughed once during the entire film.
I:291;99;This movie is over a decade old now but all these years later and despite the fact that they are grown, it still makes my kids and my wife and I laugh.
I:291;100;It was inventive, we had three very funny scenes, they lasted long.2.
I:291;101;The acting(excluding Ashton Kutcher) was amazing.
I:291;102;It actually turns into a serious story for a while, it was good that it actually had two sides to the movie.6.
I:291;103;Cheaper By The Dozen is a great family film!!
I:291;104;Steve, Bonnie, Hilary, Piper, and Tom are great actors, and this is such an enjoyable movie!
I:291;105;This is a funny movie and it is very enjoyable.
I:291;106;Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt are great actors in this movie
I:291;107;Funny for all ages and it has heart.
I:291;108;For some reason it is making me type 12 more words so here they are.
I:291;109;I'll watch anything that Steve Martin is in.
I:291;110;"In real life, big families are not always so close and happy
I:291;111;All in all, this film had some very charming moments, yes, but then again, there were many times when I wasn't quite sure what it was trying to tell us .
I:291;112;My kids and I loved it.
I:291;113;Steve Martin is very good, and there is lots of humor and a good family message too.
I:291;114;I enjoyed this movie, it was really funny and my whole family liked it.
I:291;115;get this movie for the whole family that I promise that will enjoy.
I:291;116;Martin and Hunt are great in the movie.
I:291;117;I always enjoy Martin's facial expressions.
I:291;118;it's a wonderful movie about a loving family who stick together through thick and thin .
I:291;119;There's a good movie in this material somewhere.
I:291;120;Steve Martin is a good actor and very funny, and he's the only reason this film gets two stars rather than one (well, and Tom Welling and Ashton Kutcher walking around in not many clothes helps).
I:291;121;Maybe somewhere down the line someone will try again and have more success.
I:291;122;In the meantime, if one wants a good family comedy, there's many others out there to choose from.
I:291;123;I just watched this this evening and I thought that this was a really cute film!!!
I:291;124;It was really funny in most parts and my son seemed to enjoy it as well (8 year old) this is the type of film that only comes along every once in a while.
I:291;125;something that you and your family can all sit down with a huge bowl of popcorn and enjoy!!!
I:291;126;And in the end that was good enough for me.
I:291;127;A pretty good family flick and recommended for a Saturday matinee at the movies.P(.)
I:291;128;I thought it was excellent.
I:291;129;There was never a boring scene, and I think all the actors did a superb job, including those under six even.
I:291;130;Bonnie Hunt is a comic actress I think is vastly overrated.
I:291;131;Well, this time it works.
I:291;132;Maybe it helps to have 12 kids around.
I:291;133;But overall this is a good goofy movie that even grownups can enjoy.
I:291;134;Totally one of the best movies for all ages.
I:291;135;Alyson Stoner is a hit!
I:291;136;Awsome for the whole family.
I:291;137;I bet all your children can relate to one of the Baker's.
I:291;138;A hit for the family and oh so much better than the original!
I:291;139;The move from the small town life to a much more urban (not too urban though) environment is a shock to the entire family.
I:291;140;goer, but more towards the crowd who enjoys life for the simple fact they're alive and kicking.
I:291;141;steve Martin always rises to the role.
I:291;142;Hilary Duff, who I normally can't stand, did a good job, too.
I:291;143;The rest of the cast seemed to compliment each other exceedingly well.
I:291;144;The filming (moving shots without breaks) was superb!
I:291;145;Cheaper by the Dozen was a good opportunity to show the love and bond a large family can have.
I:291;146;The overall result is both dramatic and hilarious, which proves once again why Steve Martin is the master of his craft .
I:291;147;wearing two hats as a standout comedic and dramatic actor.
I:291;148;Also, the Baker children, 12 strong, are also part of this package deal, and when you have this many kids, things are bound to get topsy.
I:291;149;Bonnie Hunt shows her wares as a seasoned actress, and Ashton Kutcher turns in a good performance as well.
I:291;150;"All of the above qualities make ""Cheaper By The Dozen"" a movie worth seeing."
I:291;151;"Be sure and take your ""dozen"" to see these ""dozen""."
I:291;152;It's funny and it has some thoughtful moments.
I:291;153;Bratty moments, selfish moments, and some attitude issues .
I:291;154;It's kept light, but thoughtful and definitely has enough meat to it to satisfy.
I:291;155;It will entertain you from start to finish.
I:291;156;there are some great moments in this flick (I won't spoil them for you)and you might even shed a tear or two.
I:291;157;Lots of antics and the movie felt genuine through out.
I:291;158;A very funny update on the old classic.
I:291;159;Steve Martinand Bonnie Hunt have an on screen chemistry together that makes the movie work.
I:291;160;Our whole family enjoyed it.
I:291;161;They did a great job and its a timeless classic movie.
I:291;162;And, it does have a lot of comedic moments that are genuinely funny.
I:291;163;Tom and Kate had always wanted a family with 8 kids, but due to some twins along the way, they ended up with a dozen.
I:291;164;The family packs up, moves to the big city, and struggles to adjust.
I:291;165;the younger kids in the family team up to create mischief on several occasions.
I:291;166;They do an admirable but unspectacular job in their roles.
I:291;167;on the bright side, Steve Martin gives a good performance.
I:291;168;A family with 12 wild kids moves to a new place the kids hate, and it's all chaos and cartoon violence: the best joke in this movie is supposed to be the kids getting their dog to maul their sister's boyfriend's crotch.
I:291;169;1.2stars (don't bother)Summary:Not a good movie for everyone.
I:291;170;But a fun one for young families.
I:291;171;story:Steve Martin plays Tom Baker, a very dedicated, loving dad and husband with 12 kids who is a great coach for a small school so he can best care for his family.
I:291;172;Thus, abandoning the life of the great mother/author, she leaves Martin alone with the 12 kids just as they move into their new home, in a big new town, scary new schools, few new friends, and her husbands new demanding job.
I:291;173;But, the kids enjoyed it for its fun and frolic.
I:291;174;What I saw appalled me.
I:291;175;Steve Martin movies are usually very good.
I:291;176;"Bringing Down the House, was great, as was ""Novocaine,"" but now he is starting to go to family movies in ""Cheaper by the Dozen."""
I:291;177;The reason I liked this movie was that it was funny, smart, and it was not just an hour and a half of children screaming.
I:291;178;Steve Martin was funny in it, very much like he usually is, and I could see them making a sequal out of it, especially since it's already made over a hundred million dollars since Christmas Day.
I:291;179;Their oldest daughter Nora has moved out of the house and is living with her model/actor boyfriend Hank.
I:291;180;"The rest of the children also always make fun of Mark, who is so unlike everybody else in the family, that the kids call him ""Fedex,"" as if he was delivered to them."
I:291;181;they are just settling into their new home, and their new life, when Kate gets her book published and she has to go away for two weeks to promote it.
I:291;182;Tom states that he could handle the kids for those two weeks, and be able to go to work, so Kate goes.
I:291;183;Problems start right away when Nora and Hank come and the kids make it their personal mission to annoy Hank in any way that they can.
I:291;184;It's clever, especially since it was thought up by ten year olds.
I:291;185;The remake is a new movie.
I:291;186;It's an hour and a half long, and it's funny, with some good acting, and some very funny moments and very funny scenes.
I:291;187;eNJOY!Rated PG for language and some thematic elements.
I:291;188;I highly recommend this movie.
I:291;189;I really like this movie, it features Tom Welling, Hillary Duff and more!Lots of fun!
I:291;190;Love the cast of characters, very cute, crazy, fun.
I:291;191;Steve Martin is great in this role.
I:291;192;One of the best family movies of it's time.
I:291;193;It did have it's funny moments and I love some of the actors in it.
I:291;194;The guy from Smallville that plays the oldest son is a good actor and one of the most handsome men alive.
I:291;195;And all the people who play the neighbor family next door are great.
I:291;196;And though the frog in the eggs was ridiculous, at least it was really funny and well done.
I:291;197;The outtakes are good too.
I:291;198;I also enjoyed the game of Apple Schmear.
I:291;199;Those tell a more interesting story and the comedy is more genuine (even the slapstick moments), and they even have a nice dramatic story in them as well.
I:291;200;eleven if you count that one of them has moved out.
I:291;201;But, the money is better, so the Baker family moves to a middle.
I:291;202;witted, always smiling father in this film was utterly hilarious.
I:291;203;but was good in her own right, as she has a cute, bubbly personality that lights up the screen.
I:291;204;like model, who watches his commercials on TV all day, and talks about nothing but himself.
I:291;205;Overall, this was a fabulous family film that can be enjoyed by all, even if you don't have a large family.
I:291;206;I've always loved the original movie and cast, and only in the last few years learned this movie was based on a true story about the Gilbreth family.
I:291;207;Cheaper By The Dozen is a great comedy about the importance of family.
I:291;208;When Todd Baker(Steve Martin) lands his dream job of coaching a college football team, he has to move his whole family to Chicago.
I:291;209;This movie is humorourous, lighthearted, and unoffensive.
I:291;210;There is an interview with the director and deleted scenes.
I:291;211;I would have liked to see interviews with the cast, as well as footage of the fun had on set.Your whole family should love Cheaper By The Dozen because there is a little something for everybody.
I:291;212;old really enjoyed this movie!
I:291;213;I've liked all of his movies until this one.
I:291;214;if you think children throwing objects at their teacher, setting people on fire, and roller skating inside at the top of stairs is cute you'll love this.
I:291;215;Cheaper by the Dozen is a warm and funny comedy that combines slapstick comedy and emontional realism.
I:291;216;It is, and I'm surprised.
I:291;217;Anyway when Martin is offered a pretigious job as football coach for a college team, he persuades the big family to move out of their small town and into the suburbs of Chicago.
I:291;218;i liked the dramatic backdrops of the characters.
I:291;219;The kids themselves are realistic.
I:291;220;Of course, the ending ends in a happy note.
I:291;221;"I reccomend this with ""Freaky Friday"" as good family films to see."
I:291;222;This is indeed a surprsingly very good family movie.
I:291;223;From the previews, it looked kind of iffy, but it turned out to be really great.
I:291;224;Steve Martin did an excellent job in this movie as the dad who has to try to keep 12 kids under control while the mom is gone.
I:291;225;It goes from being really funny, to completely serious and a family moment kind of thing.
I:291;226;This movie is worth seeing, it has some really funny stuff.
I:291;227;It's inspired me to see the second film and the original movie.
I:291;228;Overall, something I was surprised about how good it was.
I:291;229;like movie with just one outstanding character.
I:291;230;it's good entertainment for, you know, younger kids, like 8 and under.
I:291;231;The movie is pretty much targeted for a family audience.
I:291;232;In spite of many irrealsitic scenes, I genuiely liked Cheaper By The Dozen.
I:291;233;Steve Martin with his facial expressions and zany antics always manages to bring a smile to my face.
I:291;234;Another key aspect of this film as that there is some good character development among the supporting cast including the dozen children.
I:291;235;Its a bit taxing, but in the end sensibility and good judgement is reached.
I:291;236;And there are some good laughs in between.
I:291;237;not quite a classic, but Cheaper by the Dozen features many comic moments and a message that family has its priorities.
I:291;238;a fun movie for children that adults can also relate to.
I:291;239;Pairing up Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt is sheer genius!
I:291;240;Delightful performances by the entire talented cast.
I:291;241;As expected, this movie presents plenty of funny scenes that blend large family dynamics with outrageous physical humor .
I:291;242;Nice progression of events and good development of multiple conflicts arising from each family member struggling to live out his or her own life while keeping the family close .
I:291;243;a tough job in the midst of a major move and multiple life transitions.
I:291;244;The kids struggle with adjusting to a new school and a whole new way of life.
I:291;245;Everyone struggles to be heard!
I:291;246;And through it all, the cement that holds this group together is genuine family love.
I:291;247;fun for the whole family!
I:291;248;There are other reviews out there which spell out the entire film, and I'll let them do it for you.
I:291;249;For this review, all I have to say is that Bonnie Hunt and Steve Martin are terrific in this movie, a remake of an earlier Clifton Webb one.
I:291;250;"She's really got a great streak of ""being human,"" and Martin is totally agreeable, and he really clicks with Hunt."
I:291;251;The ensemble cast of children was wonderful, too, and no, they weren't the Brady Bunch, or the Partridge Family.
I:291;252;i happen to know many families with multiple children and their lives are equally funny at times, so this movie can be credible.
I:291;253;Just see the wonderfulness of this nice film with your family, put the popcorn out, and get ready for quite a few laughs.
I:291;254;I had a lot of fun watching this movie.
I:291;255;Steve Martin is always GREAT!
I:291;256;day version is more rambunctious, more catered to the family SUV generation.
I:291;257;I found myself liking it .
I:291;258;And yet they still dream of having it all, of juggling the perfect family life with the successful careers.
I:291;259;CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN does have its strong emotional beats, but mostly the story is played for hijinks.
I:291;260;I thought this movie was fun.
I:291;261;Familiar names are peppered in to offset the diverse cast of fresh kid faces.
I:291;262;Steve Martin's career has evolved in that he has become a sort of iconic father figure in cinema.
I:291;263;Bonnie Hunt, a fine, quick.
I:291;264;witted comedienne, matches Martin in sharpness and timing.
I:291;265;Hilary Duff turns in a good performance as the even.
I:291;266;Ashton Kutcher, back when he was up and coming, has a hilarious cameo as Perabo's self.
I:291;267;but it's the kids, with their personal oddities, who lend a refreshing spikiness to the story.
I:291;268;soaking prank is quite excellent).
I:291;269;this movie comes in two formats: widescreen on one side, full screen on the other.
I:291;270;"dOES ""CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN"" FULLFILL THE DIRECTORS LOFTY GOALS?THERE HAS TO BE BALANCE FOR BELIEVABILITY:I was very pleased to see that this family did have to go through fits and trials of a convulsive nature, and that there were casualties just like in real life."
I:291;271;There is a cost, a personal cost, to everyone in a family of this size.
I:291;272;Relationships, family dynamics, a true sense of belonging for better or worse.
I:291;273;This is balance, and this film included a great deal of balance weaved into its serio.
I:291;274;comic depiction of a very unlikely family.
I:291;275;The video and audio transfer were as they should be, excellent.
I:291;276;bOTTOM LINE:Entertaining family fare, but not quite a classic.
I:291;277;There is also a sequel to this 2003 film also starring the original cast of Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt.
I:291;278;This movie was so funny!!
I:291;279;The kids are funny, the plot is sweet, ans it's a definite family film.
I:291;280;But it's well worth the wait!!!!!
I:291;281;"But the end result was their real dream ""family."
I:291;282;"But the children grow up healthy and one thing that happen more then not
I:291;283;I think that the cast was great.
I:291;284;all of them were easily beleivable and they portrayed each character nicely.
I:291;285;"the model/actor"" brought a lot of comedic performance to the movie."
I:291;286;The cast plus the movies easygoingness makes it a fun family film .
I:291;287;I was actually pretty surprised by it.
I:291;288;Steve Martin does a really good job as Tom Baker, the father who tries to live out his dream of being the head football coach at a top university.
I:291;289;Of course, along the way he realizes that real dreams are made of family.
I:291;290;and life has a way of changing what your dreams really are about.
I:291;291;Martin, of course, makes these themes come to life in a really comical way.
I:291;292;LOL This is a really cute and funny film for the whole family.
I:291;293;especially if all of the Lord of the Rings movies are sold out!
I:291;294;"There are a lot of unrealistic and ""yeah."
I:291;295;"right"" things about this movie."
I:291;296;but it is still entertaining and still carries a very important message about the importance of a family sticking together.
I:291;297;Steve Martin is still hilarious after being a comedian for about twice my lifetime.
I:291;298;The movie is mostly physical gags, but they are still fairly funny for a lighthearted weekend comedy.
I:291;299;In fact all these roles are comfortable for the actors.
I:291;300;steve Martin plays a goofy dad who is way over his head and is the target for most of the physical comedy.
I:291;301;bonnie Hunt plays a loved mother.
I:291;302;Did they even do any acting?The movie is very predictable, but is still mostly funny.
I:291;303;Cheaper by the Dozen is a 2003 family comedy starring Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt, and directed by Shawn Levy.
I:291;304;This film includes many practical jokes played on each other along with comical family situations that everyone could relate.
I:291;305;this light hearted comedy is one that that whole family can enjoy.
I:291;306;"I give ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" four stars because of the good wholesome fun that can be enjoyed by the whole family."
I:291;307;I would recommend this film to anyone looking to enjoy some clean and practical humor.
I:291;308;This movie is wonderfully entertaining!!!!!
I:291;309;I recommend if you have slightly older kids (not toddlers or very young).
I:291;310;There is some content that isn't ideal, but all in all, it's a good and fun family movie with some good themes and values represented.
I:291;311;The delivery was fast and all in great condition.
I:291;312;A fun movie to watch with the family.
I:291;313;Some good lessons to learn for both the children and the adults.
I:291;314;Cheaper by the Dozen, hits the tickle bones of children of all ages, and even adults.
I:291;315;This movie is perfect for the family to watch togather.
I:291;316;"pLUS Hilary Duff actually is good in here, maybe its because she finally dosnt act so "" Lizzie McGuire."
I:291;317;When they hear their dad wants to move to follow his dream of being a football couch.
I:291;318;The older sister played by Piper Parabo (Coyote Ugly) with charm is more mature and likeable though.
I:291;319;i loved this movies because it was laugh out loud funny and sweet at the same time.
I:291;320;Steve Martin puts in his 2nd best performance.
I:291;321;My nine year old laughed and laughed at this one!Steve Martin and supporting cast are hilarious.
I:291;322;Many funny scenes that will make you chuckle repeatedly.
I:291;323;Cute, funny, great for the whole family.
I:291;324;Id definitely use the company again.
I:291;325;Clean cut, entertaining movie, would recommend to anyone, especially if you grew up in a large family or wanted to know what it would be like to grow up in a large family
I:291;326;As a father, I understand all too well the pressures of career and family.
I:291;327;Cheaper by the Dozen is a very funny movie.
I:291;328;Most of the humor is slapstick and you can't help but laugh.
I:291;329;With all its laughs, the movie looks at some serious issues facing today's families.
I:291;330;The kids have their own ways to handle the situation and with hilarious results.
I:291;331;Hilary Duff is very believable as a vain teenager and Forrest Landis does a great job with Mark, the kid who seems to feel the most neglected.
I:291;332;He reminds me of a cross between Mayberry's Opie and Harry Potter.
I:291;333;if you want an evening of laughter, by all means see this movie.
I:291;334;This film is an achievement for Steve Martin.
I:291;335;He acts very well as a college football coach who finally gets to his goal, a job at a big name university.
I:291;336;at the same time his wife has the opportunity of a lifetime as well.
I:291;337;some of the scenes are touching, there is a sense in the movie that dad, although wrapped up in his career, really is torn by what his family needs and what time he has to give.
I:291;338;the twins, the younger ones, are just hilarious.
I:291;339;Remember to watch the outtakes at the end, they are great.
I:291;340;this movie is fun, and is viewable by a wide audience.
I:291;341;"A charming tale of early.20th century of efficiency experts and their 12 children turns into a madhouse of stereotypes as the theme that ""dad can't cope"" gets run into the ground."
I:291;342;The cast led by Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt were terrific in their roles.
I:291;343;The children were cute and also did a good job.
I:291;344;It's rather amazing, that with all the excellent writers in the world, films like this one are produced.
I:291;345;The original version of this movie was both funny and enjoyable.
I:291;346;but, it's definately fun and heart.
I:291;347;The plot line: a simple big family moves away and life starts to suck and then a happy ending.
I:291;348;Another good thing is that I can totally relate to some kids.
I:291;349;The bottom line is: its fun.
I:291;350;Cheaper By The Dozen is a really funny family movie.
I:291;351;I am 17 years old but I still love these family movies.
I:291;352;My 7 year old got a kick out of this movie.
I:291;353;Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt are great.
I:291;354;And i cried during this movie.
I:291;355;I thought it was a sweet and charming movie!
I:291;356;Going in, I was excited to see it.
I:291;357;i thought that, with so many talented actors, it really had to be good.
I:291;358;His character was sweet, cute and likable.
I:291;359;Still, that kid gave a great (and, at times, heart.
I:291;360;Dad, played by Steve Martin, has recently started a new job as a football coach at a major university and vows that he can handle that plus the child.
I:291;361;The kids are cute and spontaneous and each one has his own unique personality.
I:291;362;Family values rule the day and make this a good movie for all ages to view.
I:291;363;"violins prompt us to recall how much they really ""love eachother""."
I:291;364;There are very few good family movies that appeals to multiple ages at the same time.
I:291;365;My children have loved these movies when they were little and as teens.
I:291;366;I am a big fan of Hilary Duff.
I:291;367;steve Martin is the funniest one in the movie.
I:291;368;Watch this movie over and over again!
I:291;369;This movie is so funny.
I:291;370;This movie delivers as good family comedy.
I:291;371;Minimal raunch, pretty well written, had me laughing out loud quite a bit.
I:291;372;completely over the top much of the time, but hey that's what makes it Funny.
I:291;373;Steven Martin and the younger kids are they people who carry this movie.
I:291;374;if more was giving to the 3 older kids then they may have been able to well do more.
I:291;375;still i enjoyed the movie it was cool.
I:291;376;My 9 years olds twins really enjoyed it, and I love all of the Steve Martin movies!
I:291;377;The movie reminds me of my father's family, and stepfather's family.
I:291;378;either way it was a fun movie to watch with the fam.
I:291;379;My entire floor went to go see this movie after Christmas break (that's right, 17.21 year old university students), and we all loved it.
I:291;380;It was hilarious, the acting was great, the kids were adorable.
I:291;381;It was a spontaneous, fun.
I:291;382;filled movie, and everyone left the theatre with smiles on their faces!
I:291;383;Kate supported Tom so he now returns the favor, although this means he is going to have to fend for himself with the eleven kids.
I:291;384;there is a clear line of demarcation with the kids.
I:291;385;The other nine are all fresh faces and they are the ones who come out best in this film.
I:291;386;Of course with thirteen other members of the family to contend with, and Nora's boyfriend, the uncredited Ashton Kutcher, competition for screen time is fierce.
I:291;387;the funniest moment in this 2003 film would have to be when Martin and Hunt are trying to pull the family dog off of Kutcher's rear end.
I:291;388;Close works with horseshoes, hand grenades, and thermonuclear devices, but not with finding a job and moving a town in proximity to the place you left a year earlier.
I:291;389;I love the antics of the dozen.
I:291;390;I is a great movie, but I thught I orded one copy, but I got 4 copies.
I:291;391;see what you can do to send me another movie.
I:291;392;Is a good comedy movie.
I:291;393;Remember my big family and the thousands of experiences and lots of fun that a big family has.
I:291;394;Steve Martin is as good as usual and the story has some heart to it.
I:291;395;Part of the charm of the story as written was the occupation of the paterfamilias as an efficiency expert.
I:291;396;Martin's character is a football coach, which all but eviscerates the comic potential.
I:291;397;If you want to see a truly funny version of a true family, watch the original with Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy.
I:291;398;They loved it and I did too.
I:291;399;Great movie pick for a family movie night.
I:291;400;On the positive side, this movie is a decent family movie that provides a few laughs.
I:291;401;This movie actually has a Disney feel to it given how family oriented it is, both in the plot and in its style.
I:291;402;while this movie offers a decent mental break (meaning you do not have to think, and perhaps it is preferred that you not think while watching the movie), and it is good family fair (no bad language, sex outside of marriage is discouraged, family life is good, etc.), beyond that the movie plays up too many stereotypes.
I:291;403;For everyone else, go watch the original 1950 version and see how these things can really work.
I:291;404;I loved the trailors that played on TV.
I:291;405;The Baker family has 12 kids.
I:291;406;Still, they and their kids are mostly happy, even if life is chaotic.
I:291;407;at first, everyone is happy by the changes.
I:291;408;I was always curious to see this film.
I:291;409;True, there are some comic moments, but much of this movie could have been done with 4 kids and gotten the same point across.
I:291;410;It is also true that in today's modern world having 12 kids of your own without thinking of adoption is more than a bit selfish.
I:291;411;Kids can relate to this family because with 12 of them every kid is bound to relate to one of them.
I:291;412;it is an excelent family movie, and comedy!
I:291;413;Anything Tom Welling does is amazing he is a good actor and would love to see him in more movies
I:291;414;Cheaper by the Dozen is a fantastic family film.
I:291;415;I'm from a family of six kids and could relate to a lot of what this family was going through.
I:291;416;i liked Cheaper by the Dozen.
I:291;417;It's a film you can take the whole family too that they will enjoy.
I:291;418;Big families will really like it.
I:291;419;It's great to see Steve Martin break back out this last year.
I:291;420;Take your kids to go see this, they'll enjoy it and so will you.
I:291;421;It made for a good couple of hours of watching on a slow day.
I:291;422;Overall a decent movie at 3 stars.
I:291;423;She's been wanting to see it ever since it came out at the cinema, but with her busy social life, we never went to see it.
I:291;424;And the only two of the kids (apart from Piper Perabo) are well.
I:291;425;But she gets one of her songs over the end credits I think.
I:291;426;Alyson Stoner is brilliant as the team leader of the group really.
I:291;427;One thing I will say about the extras are the deleted/extended scenes are very cool.
I:291;428;I'm normally one of these people who likes to watch the deleted scenes (sometimes they're quite good!)
I:291;429;But on this, Shawn Levy's comments are in text, so you can watch the scenes without hearing his voice.
I:291;430;see, just a nice inoffensive piece of family fluff.
I:291;431;I always think this movie is going to be funnier than it is.
I:291;432;If you come from a large family, or know someone who does, you know that discipline is the cornerstone of that many people living together.
I:291;433;Martin is highly likeable as a small town football coach who is offered the opportunity to move to Chicago to coach a major college football team.
I:291;434;martin's professional life clashes with his personal life, as his university boss wants him to spend all his waking hours concentrating on football, while his twelve children are all running into problems adjusting to the new environment and constantly need his attention.
I:291;435;it is highly entertaining seeing how Martin tries to have his football team practice at his house so he can also watch his kids.
I:291;436;there are some really touching moments especially involving Martin's youngest son, who seems to be ignored by everyone else.
I:291;437;Martin signs up with Jenkins football team the Stallions and the family move away from their country town to a new place.
I:291;438;Martin is great and awesome as usual, same to Bonnie Hunt.
I:291;439;Martin and Hunt are actually very good in their performances and the children (Tom Welling and Hilary Duff especially) do well in their roles.
I:291;440;But to keep from being a total Scrooge, the movie has a central theme of family unity and it did entertain, so you can certainly do worse.
I:291;441;Not much to dislike in this fun, wild, family spoof that is oozing with talent and heavy on sentiment.
I:291;442;bonnie Hunt is wonderful as the long.
I:291;443;Steve Martin is the character he always plays: befuddled, humble, kind, and warm.
I:291;444;The kids are, without exception, great, and every bit the stars of this vehicle as Hunt and Martin.
I:291;445;even the supporting cast is great and contributes significantly to the movie.
I:291;446;It's worth a watch and will be something I keep around the house for a rainy day.
I:291;447;He was much funnier then.
I:291;448;it is a butchering interpretation of an excellent book and an earlier movie that is also very good.
I:291;449;"The only element that the ""updated"" version of the work has with either the book or the earlier film is the presence of twelve children."
I:291;450;off of a good book and a good movie,and a psychotic portrayal of how cynical and misguided the American family can be.
I:291;451;"Lastly, the ""zany"" outtakes at the end include making a joke about an incestuous kiss between mother and son when we see Kate Baker making out with her teenage son, Charlie."
I:291;452;It is here to portray comedy to make us laugh.
I:291;453;I thought it was funny and just a fun movie to watch.you didn't know what to expect.
I:291;454;year old daughter when it was on HBO and she absolutely loves it.
I:291;455;And guess what, watching it through her eyes and seeing her joy I now love it too.
I:291;456;The kids are cute, Bonnie Hunt is adorable, and the family and kids really love and respect eachother.
I:291;457;I would recommend it to anyone with children.
I:291;458;"The only thing this ""remake"" has in common with the original is the title and the number of kids."
I:291;459;The original is definitely the better of the two.
I:291;460;This remake is cute, and I did laugh, but I am not thrilled with it.
I:291;461;There are some funny bits at first, but the movie gets emotional after the first hour.
I:291;462;anyway, it's an entertaining movie to watch.
I:291;463;Watch it with your whole family!
I:291;464;I love to watch cheaper by the dozen movie very funny my enjoy!when I was so laugh so much on tv.
I:291;465;While the movie has a lot of cute students and a lot of sub.
I:291;466;Everybody in this movie is a jerk!
I:291;467;Cheaper by the dozen has something for everyone.
I:291;468;GGreat movie for the whole family we really liked it.
I:291;469;We actually got both the first and second and watched a double feature.
I:291;470;Anyone who has seen in this movie .
I:291;471;and Hillary Duff/Lizzie Maguire fans all across the world.
I:291;472;I've must've seen this movie more than once with my family and after a while, the movie really looses what little funny moments it had to begin with.
I:291;473;The rest of the movie is pretty predicable.
I:291;474;"Steven Martin's best role was ""Leap of faith."""
I:291;475;His character was funny and sarcastic.
I:291;476;Quite likable despite his con.
I:291;477;"See above and see my ""Everwood"" review."
I:291;478;I thought the movie was quite good.
I:291;479;Although Steve Martin was funnier in Bringin' Down the House, the movie still shows him as a stronger actor this time in both funny and dramatic scenes.
I:291;480;Helen Hunt made a good mother in this movie as she is the calmer side to the kids.
I:291;481;The kids were good, although a few of them need to get better on their acting.
I:291;482;"Ashton Kutcher is that funny in his scenes
I:291;483;That snake which got loose at the kids' friend's party was so funny and scary at the same time.
I:291;484;And the best thing, that Mrs. Baker's book still ended up on the best.
I:291;485;It was a good movie that does take 20 minutes or so to get into its more complicated parts.
I:291;486;it was one of the best movies i've ever seen and anyone who said they hated the movie is out of their minds.
I:291;487;by the way Jack Baker (played by Jacob Smith) is funny and cute.
I:291;488;they were all really funny.
I:291;489;this movie so so hilarious!
I:291;490;i am a fan of many of the actors and actresses from the movie and to my surprise together they were amazing!
I:291;491;i recommend this movie for everyone tosee.
I:291;492;I will say, that if you are over 15 you may not like it, but I think its really funny!
I:291;493;examination of those family values.
I:291;494;humorous set pieces and a whole host of cathartic morals to be enjoyed.
I:291;495;When I first viewed this movie, as a 10 year old, I only saw the basic story and laughs, both of which I enjoyed.
I:291;496;I feel the movie does all of this very well.
I:291;497;i began to really enjoy all the characters again, and having been through some of their personalities or problems (mark being bullied and alone, kim and jessica talking too much like a smart alike and about themselves, Charlie feeling as if his life was ruined by someone's elses plans, Nora having problems with finding balance with her own problems and family issues) I feel for them a lot more.
I:291;498;And one of the overall messages of the movie, finding the right balance between family and what you want is a good one.
I:291;499;the humor still remains funny, but mainly because the situation is only possible in a movie/family like this.
I:291;500;Also knowing some of the celebrities of this movie was nice to see.
I:291;501;And I was impressed by how easily Ashton Keutcher played a really self obsessed guy.
I:291;502;and of course Steve Martin, he did great as a caring, more serious, but fun father.
I:291;503;having viewed this movie from two perspectives I still enjoy it and appreciate much more.
I:291;504;Now days, for families it is hard to find clean, funny entertainment that also has a good moral.
I:291;505;We have enjoyed watching The Cheaper By The Dozen series for our family movie nights.
I:291;506;This is the best of Steve Martin .
I:291;507;Everyone we knew had seen it, and they all had loved it.
I:291;508;Expressions like go see it, it's hilarious or it's SO funny!
I:291;509;Of course, after all these thing really helped create high expectations for this film.
I:291;510;Wackiness is supposed to ensue, but in all honesty, I found very little of it to be funny.
I:291;511;But that's not the bad part of the movie, both actors are good enough for the material they're given.
I:291;512;The real negative was the writing and the casting of the kids.
I:291;513;His scenes at the table with the rest of the family and the attack by the family's dog are quite funny.
I:291;514;The jerk is truly a gem of American comedy.
I:291;515;whose ages range from early twenties to preschool .
I:291;516;"friendly"" nature of the film."
I:291;517;Great movie, would five star if it more humor.
I:291;518;But the guy from the Gimlmore Girls is hot!!!
I:291;519;:) my spidey sense are tinglinghi guys are you my friends
I:291;520;Not one child uttered one believable line in the entire movie.
I:291;521;As family movies goes, this one is a nice one.
I:291;522;It is warm and very funny.
I:291;523;If you have children from 6 to 10, you're kids gonna love it.
I:291;524;It's a wonderful family movie, you won't regret it to have it once it came out.
I:291;525;My kids love it, so do i. it's touching, hillarious and amazingly cool.
I:291;526;Turns out this was a very likeable and enjoyable movie.
I:291;527;Steve Martin, who is doing productively well in the Family Movie genre, was great.
I:291;528;The children were played rising child actors, like Piper Perabole, Hilary Duff, and Tom Welling.
I:291;529;Ashton Kutcher did a great cameo as well.
I:291;530;The film was funny, entertaining, and heartfelt, and it is good for anyone to see.
I:291;531;I highly approve this film.
I:291;532;We LOVE this movie and watch it very often.
I:291;533;It's a great family movie, with a good moral.
I:291;534;However, the heart of it, and the relationships between the family are believable and enjoyable.
I:291;535;she's so smart and natural) and Steve Martin.
I:291;536;I took my daughter to see this and had a great time.
I:291;537;Anyone that has kids should see this movie.
I:291;538;I love Lizzie McGuire, so that was a bonus.
I:291;539;Steve Martin worked well with the kids!
I:291;540;the one enjoyable thing about this movie is Steve Martin.
I:291;541;We need more movies that are wholesome and fun.
I:291;542;This movie is just what it is all about.
I:291;543;I downloaded this movie on my daughters kindle so she could watch it on our flight to and from vacation.
I:291;544;There were many laughs and our 6 year old liked imitating Steve Martin which kept us all laughing.
I:291;545;Good, clean and funny movie!
I:291;546;Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt are wonderful in this family movie and I just loved it.
I:291;547;Tom and Bonnie are highschool sweethearts, who fall in love, marry and have 12 children.
I:291;548;You can see how much they are in love right from the beginning, however the trouble starts when Tom gets his dream job as a football coach and they move from their comfortable home where everyone is happy.
I:291;549;Now they must adjust to a new life, which is always hard for children and to top it off Bonnie writes a book and makes it big time.
I:291;550;But, love pulls this family together and the wrongs are righted, it was great!If you want a good family, feel good movie then you need to watch this one.
I:291;551;Acting was good, story was good and there was a lot of humor mixed in.
I:291;552;When Tom gets a job offer to coach the Stallions, they pack up and move to chicago.
I:291;553;The oldest child has moved out, has her own life, and is trying to get her family to understand that.
I:291;554;the scene that is so funny and I kept watching over and over and over again was the scene when the dog attacks the boyfriend whose shorts were soaked in meat.
I:291;555;The story is ultimately about finding a happy medium, and deciding what is more important.
I:291;556;This movie is fun for the entire family to watch.
I:291;557;I yearn for a family like the one depicted in this Steve Martin gem!
I:291;558;It doesn't mean I can't hope, and a movie like this makes me even more hopeful that even in my middle.
I:291;559;age I will still find my prince charming (or a good sperm donor at least).
I:291;560;Even though Hilary 'Heathen' Duff is a bad influence on youngsters (as is Ashton Kutcher, seen in a cameo), I would recommend this to God.
I:291;561;Great movie for a family of preschoolers through elementary age.
I:291;562;and was excited to see so much laughing and retelling me of their favorite highpoints later.
I:291;563;The 12 children and all their personalities kept me awake because I wanted to know what they were going to do next.
I:291;564;it was a good family movie but is definately geared more towards children.
I:291;565;I hate to make generalizations, but if you are over 14 and liked this movie, it means that you need to do a lot of thinking to catch up with the rest of humanity.
I:291;566;If you're looking for a clean, mildly entertaining movie, this works fine, but if you're looking for something with a good set of values and morals, this didn't cut it for me.
I:291;567;pleaser of a family comedy.
I:291;568;old son and I both enjoyed it.
I:291;569;I remembered reading the book when I was a kid, and hopefully I can get my son to read it.
I:291;570;All in all, a fine entertaining film.
I:291;571;I love Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt together and this is a great pick me up movie for those times you just want to laugh w/out having to analyze the plot!
I:291;572;It was fun to watch, with lots of laughs for all ages.
I:291;573;Kids have great wisdom at times and adults can learn a lot from them.
I:291;574;Tom Welling seemed to switch characters every time you saw him, but he was nevertheless charming and very realistic.
I:291;575;For a simple smile and forget it movie, this is the one for you, but as a whole, 3 stars was very generous.
I:291;576;Story is great so many funny parts in it love Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt they are great together awesome
I:291;577;I was a captive and willing audience, and I enjoyed the light entertainment it provided.
I:291;578;met in college in Chicago and decided to team up together for life.
I:291;579;He wanted to be a coach, she wanted to be a sports journalist, and both wanted 8 kids.
I:291;580;As things moved along, they had 12 kids, moved to the country, and she stayed at home with the family.
I:291;581;Thus, the family up and moves to Chicago (Evanston really), Tom starts the new high.
I:291;582;And this tour includes the likes of Regis and Kelly along with Oprah (one example of the fantasy elements of the film).
I:291;583;good movie, and it leaves you feeling good, mostly.
I:291;584;things I thought noteworthy were:.
I:291;585;Ashton Kutcher made possibly his most honest statement.
I:291;586;I was pleasantly surprised that the Bakers wanted a G. rated household and frowned upon their 22 year old daughter's sleeping with her boyfriend (Kutcher).
I:291;587;Sappy, sitcomish remake to the 1950 original that has a few genuine laughs but a decent enough movie to fold laundry to.
I:291;588;He is drugged and brought to sets of movies regularly?
I:291;589;but hey, this movie has a few laughs, if you like ZANY comedies filled with ANTICS!
I:291;590;I, on the other hand, like another kind of humor.
I:291;591;This is good if you like Newman from Seinfeld bobbing from a chandelier, crying for help.
I:291;592;This movie gave me quite a few laughs and it had some really great one.
I:291;593;The movie starts with the family in one small house then Steve Martin's chrachter gets a coaching job with a big raise and they move to another town in a very large house.
I:291;594;Kids pull some pranks and there's a happy ending.
I:291;595;I would only recommend this to 8.16 year olds.
I:291;596;She comes off well, but ultimately the kids and Martin have to carry the film.3) (Good) The kids are likable, and, at times, very touching (Especially Mark/Fed Ex).
I:291;597;"That alone makes ""Cheaper By The Dozen"" worth at least a viewing."
I:291;598;For them, I'm sure, it was a paycheck.
I:291;599;But, he did a really good job in this movie.
I:291;600;This movie is totally a family film.
I:291;601;This movie has clean humor, wonderful acting and wonderfully written.
I:291;602;If you are looking for a good time, go see this movie.
I:291;603;This is good for the whole family.
I:291;604;now, this movie is well worth the money.
I:291;605;Go see it and you'll be pleasently surprised!!
I:291;606;I would recommend this to any of my friends who has kids.
I:291;607;Clean and appropriate for all ages!
I:291;608;Cheaper by the Dozen was a pretty good movie.
I:291;609;I wasn't laughing throughout the whole movie, but there were definitely some pretty funny moments in it.
I:291;610;But for the most part, this was a well.
I:291;611;So if you and your family are looking for some good chuckles, I recommend that you get this funny family film.
I:291;612;This kinda movie makes you realize just what a Master the Great John Hughes was at family comedy.
I:291;613;Everything the guy touched turned to gold.
I:291;614;The stars of this film are the 12 children.
I:291;615;Therefore, the movie is a true family comedy.
I:291;616;It's a movie about a family with a strong message emphasizing the importance of that grand institution.
I:291;617;Instead, the movie was a fairly honest and heart.
I:291;618;warming film all about the importance of family.
I:291;619;I'll say it up front, I could give or take Steve Martin.
I:291;620;He's gotten less and less funny over the years, and it's a crime to film.
I:291;621;I saw this in the theaters, and it felt like old.
I:291;622;Soon, Tom gets a job offer in Chicago, and Kate's successful book causes her to go on tour.
I:291;623;The neighbors are incredibly snot.
I:291;624;It's still got its moments.
I:291;625;"sheltered kid next door (Stephen Anthony Lawrence, aka Beans from ""Even Stevens"") is hilarious as always."
I:291;626;Ashton Kutcher is great as well, as oldest sibling Piper Perabo's prima.
I:291;627;"The film does have a good message: family comes first, but that can be found in dozens of other movies about big families, particularly ""Homecoming"" and ""Little Women""."
I:291;628;My 6 year old loves this movie.
I:291;629;Steve Martin continues to entertain even those who are younger today.
I:291;630;This is the ultimate family movie for those Friday evening family times.
I:291;631;Only watch this if you want to see a movie that is a hilarious train wreck, be my guest.
I:291;632;0/10 and I'm being nice.
I:291;633;good family film with unrealistic perky, tidy mom caring for this huge family.
I:291;634;probably good to while away an hour or so if you don't have something better to do.
I:291;635;If you're looking for a film that's reasonable for the whole family (ie.
I:291;636;kids over 6) then this is probably a decent choice.
I:291;637;Our kids certainly seemed to enjoy it.
I:291;638;It would not say this was the best acting I've seen in a long time from any of the characters, but it does keep moving along.
I:291;639;If it's on sale and you need a backup movie to watch on a trip or while waiting for NetFlix this is a good choice.
I:291;640;He was acting was actually believable.
I:291;641;Then he got his dream job as a college football coach, and moved everyone to the city, where everyone had to adjust to their live in the suburbs.
I:291;642;I thoroughly enjoyed viewing this film.
I:291;643;We may not be as chaotic, but we still share our exciting moments.
