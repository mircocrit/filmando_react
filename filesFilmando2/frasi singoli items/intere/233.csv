1;Eddie Albert was good, Kim Richards was enchanting, Ike Eisenberg was remarkable for a boy of his age.
2;Everything was good clean fun, along the lines of Bedknobs and Broomsticks.
3;Not so much a coming of age story but good for the whole family.
4;the classics are usually considered the better though, and these kids turn in great performances in both movies.
5;Tia carries a strange box with her that has two stars on it.
6;"When they discover his plans, the kids flee, stowing away in the RV of a grouchy Eddie Albert (best known for the TV series ""Green Acres""), who eventually gives into their charm and helps them find their way to a place called Witch Mountain."
7;Tony is a young teenager, and Tia is now becoming a young woman.
8;Thanks to the scientist (Christopher Lee of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings), they put a mind control device on Tony, making him their slave.
9;:)In some ways though, I liked the 1995 remake better, since it had more people I was familiar with, and the remake left me with a kind of warm fuzzy feeling which the originals didn't quite manage to do.
10;so, if you want good Disney entertainment, go for their older stuff.
11;And an all star cast.
12;Well, the first movie was good.
13;Escape to Witch Mountain is a very entertaining movie for people of all ages.
14;Great movies, especially Escape to Witch Mountain .
15;Escape to Witch Mountain is an excellent movie that I have loved since childhood.
16;If you have seen neither film, I highly recommend Escape to Witch Mountain.
17;It is enjoyable for the entire family.
18;These are both great movies for a great price!
19;I loved the Witch Mountain movies when my children were little.
20;Clean, funny movies for kids.
21;Now my grandchildren are enjoying them.
22;i like the first one better of course but the second one answers a lot of questions from the first one.
23;they are just two of disney's classic movies and i recommend these to everyone
24;I grew up in the 70's and 80's so I remember when these movies came out and I used to have a poster in my room when I was a kid, so this brought back some good memories for me and now that I have kids, it was wonderful to share this movie with them and they loved it just as much as I did when I was a kid, and still do now.
25;I would recommend this to anyone who has children.
26;watching the movie today, the special effects are a bit corny but it is still fun and enjoyable to watch.
27;It also helps that a few big names lend their acting talents to these films, including Eddie Albert, Christopher Lee, and Bette Davis, giving a little something extra for adults to watch (though all these actors have certainly done better work before and after these movies).
28;I love Disney movies and this is one of the classics.
29;The first movie is of course better then the second but for the price, it was very good.
30;Witch Mountain is truly one of the classics.
31;No doubt, great actors and a great story.
32;This is definitely a movie both adults and kids will enjoy for ages.
33;i highly recommend both the movie(s) and the vendor.
34;There were 2 family friendly movies on it.
35;It is something kids would like.
36;"Great to order from
I:286;37;Love this movie since I was kid.
I:286;38;Thanks again for the great service!
I:286;39;the main characters are children, and this is a kids movie, so don't expect anything racy.
I:286;40;both these movies are fun and even playful explorations of physic powers and those who would abuse them.
I:286;41;Suitable for children six and up, fun for adults too.
I:286;42;The special effects of """"Star Wars"""" would soon eclipse those of this movie, but many of those still hold up today and make this movie a lot of fun to watch."""
43;Tony and Tia are also nice kids.
44;Moments later a tow truck demolishes Deranian's car and Deranian suspects that Tia may be a very special child.
45;Though Jason appears gruff and bluff, he is actually a nice man who decides to help the children.
46;The original was more charming and clever than this movie, but this movie featured many more special effects than the original.
47;Even though this movie was more formulaic than the original, it is worth having and watching, particularly if you enjoyed the original.
48;This time they are taking a vacation in Los Angeles.
49;this movie is relatively weak, but is worth watching because of the actors involved and some of the special effects.
50;Christopher Lee is always fun to watch.
51;Letha is one of Bette Davis's lesser roles, but she was a great actress.
52;Kim Richards is cute and earnest.
53;I particularly enjoy the van scene at the end of the movie, which you will have to watch because I will say no more about that.
54;"The chase following the attempted museum heist is very good
I:286;55;Star Wars and """"Close Encounters of the Third Kind"""" shocked the world with breakthrough special effects in 1977."""
56;Subsequent films topped each other with ever.
57;disk played great, great color and sound.
58;it was so worth the money.
59;"These two movies are Disney classics, especially the first one, ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" ."
60;I saw this movie back when I was a kid and it was one of my favorite movies (still is).
61;"the second movie, ""Return to Witch Mountain"" is weaker than the first, but still worth the watch."
62;Two classic movies in one that made a great gift for someone who had a flashback from their childhood movie days!
63;And a great price, too!
64;What a fun collection to own.
65;I shared this with my kids and they loved it as my husband and I did when we were kids.
66;Thease are great videos for the young and old, with fantastic stars some that are of the past.
67;i recommend this double movie set to anyone.
68;Just like I remembered them my 9 yr old son loved to watch them with too.
69;I saw these movies when I was little and loved them.
70;I got them for my grandchildren I hope to have someday so they can enjoy them too.
71;I favor the sequel, but they are both delightful memories.
72;My family loves the movies.
73;It was fun to see the original Witch Mountain movies again.
74;They are campy in todays standards, but wonderful for younger and nostalgic audiences.
75;This edition would make a great gift for casual fans who simply want to see the movies.
76;This particular film is a nice departure from the usual 70s Disney fare in that it treats its sci.
77;The chase scenes are endless but suspenseful and mostly engaging.
78;Cars fly, crash, and magically are put back together.
79;The film is far less believable, but still a lot of fun.
80;She's at her woozy boozy best, barking out commands at the top of her lungs and abusing all in sight.
81;"The difference in tone in the second movie may be jarring for some fans
I:286;82;Escape to Witch Mountain was wonderful.
I:286;83;I bought this set for my brother's kids after learning that their favorite movie was """"Stepbrothers."""""""
84;(they're ages 12, 8, 5 &4) I thought they needed to be introduced to some movies that were actually appropriate for kids but still entertaining and I remembered loving this when I was a kid.
85;It was so refreshing to watch a movie with my nieces and nephews that was entertaining for adults and kids, but won't corrupt young minds.
86;just go ahead and do it!
87;I was surprised to find both movies on the same side of the disc.
88;I was satisfied with the product, it serves its purpose very well.
89;A very good movie for adults and children with no questionable language.
90;I enjoyed the first one remembering Tony and Tia being my age at the time wondering what they are doing now.
91;It's a cute little story with some suspense at least for a 10 year old.
92;You also have two Super stars (Bette Davis and Christopher Lee)in the movie.
93;My little boy loves it now.
94;Thanks again keep it up guys, also thanks for prompt service.
95;I remember the Harmonica that the Character Tony played and remember enjoying the music.
96;It's great to see these classics together in a pack.
97;disney has made many great films during the 70s and 80s and this in my view was among the top.
98;get it together, save money, and enjoy!
99;Disney is always the best at making good clean fun family entertainment.
100;A little bit of mystery and fantasy always helps too.
101;My daughter loves this movie and so do I.
102;When we first saw Escape to Witch Mountain, we were thrilled with it!
103;Not the best witch/halloween/scary movie ever created, but okay and pretty great.
104;I remembered loving these movies as a kid, and I still enjoy them today.
105;I was happy to find them together on one disc.
106;I remember seeing these movies in the drive in as a child.
107;I loved this movie when I was a kid and now I get to share it with my kid.
108;A good old disney movies, whit great actors and interesting history, recomended for all ages.
