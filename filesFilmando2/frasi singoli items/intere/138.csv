1;This was an all time classic.
2;The acting was superb, the cinematography excellent.
3;But strong performances, epic scope, good pacing, an engaging story, wonderful details, some true grit, and a beautiful score, all add up to make this an incredibly powerful movie.
4;I can't help but give it 5 stars.
5;kevin costner is in it as the white guy.
6;we know it,already!shanghai noon is a billion times better!its got those cool type indians.
7;I have just finished watching Dances With Wolves for the first time, and I have to say it is one of my favorite movies of all time, after one viewing.
8;the movie absolutely captivated me with it's sense of wildness and freedom.
9;the movie was packed with extraordinary scenery and a flawless portrayal of the horse people of the plains.
10;The picture was excellent, as was the audio.
11;This movie is a classic in the making.
12;Stick with Gone with the Wind if you want an entertaining, gorgeous epic.
13;"The ""it"" being referred to is the epic 1990 Oscar sweeping film by Kevin Costner, entitled ""Dances with Wolves""."
14;It was a film that was hailed a masterpiece by critics, while allowing Costner to finally be able to pick and choose his repetitive roles over the next two decades.
15;Alas, picking it up, watching it now in its modern high.
16;esque images of Americana (or some other country), coupled with a tender moment, a blasting score, and sympathy towards anything .
17;than the epic will reign supreme.
18;Dances with Wolves is beautiful.
19;The detailed conversion on my new Blu player is and was phenomenal.
20;Costner captures this feeling with perfection.
21;There was no doubt in my mind that Costner felt dedicated to this project that his creative eye wasn't at the peak of its existence.
22;"His passion bled through the film, giving us that moment when ""Dances with Wolves"" transforms from Hollywood project to Costner's dream come true."
23;For that I applaud Costner for following his heart and creating a visual treat that goes beyond your average film.
24;while Costner's imagery stands powerfully next to any great director's work, it is the overall story that ultimately holds back the rest of the film.
25;Not to sound offensive to Native American's, I was happy to see a sympathetic view of them via Costner's eyes, but it felt used.
26;Using the beautiful landscape he merely bought time, aka filler, to push his simplistic tale from average story to epic.
27;With such a broad canvas, not enough was dedicated to the right parts.
28;Costner does powerfully show us a sympathetic view of the Native American culture during the time of its downfall, but with such an epic nature I expected it to carry more realism.
29;Costner was so excited about learning about them, about communicating with them, that we never quite had the chance to see their world.
30;Costner must be given credit for his eye in this film.
31;While his directing skills were not as I anticipated, his visual eye was superb.
32;Images that may never be captured again were detailed throughout, giving us the view of an epic .
33;Besides, a shorter length means you can run it more times and sell more tickets.
34;The scene where the Indians catch the buffalo hunters and Dunbar's reaction to what's going on (in the extended edition) is very, very powerful.
35;We are quite fortunate that we at home can see both versions of the film.
36;it's interesting to compare and contrast the theatrical and Extended versions.
37;"It's so well done, it can almost make you forget about his travesties such as ""Waterworld"" and ""Robin Hood""."
38;The Extended Cut is worth the extra time but unless you're a true couch potato, don't try and see it all in one sitting!
39;It portrays the Buffalo hunt to perfection, it is heart warming, sad, happy and full of wonderful values and truth.
40;One of the best movies ever made, great to enjoy a classic on blu ray.
41;A lot of extra content at good value.
42;This was a great film with a great story and great characters.
43;inserted into the film (as opposed to being found in a deleted scenes section of extras.)
44;Plenty of documentaries are included as well.
45;One of my favorite movies, that while fictitious, really puts the plight of Native Americans and westward expansion in perspective.
46;The Indians look noble,kind,and full of genorisity.
47;And that's why I love it so much.
48;Here are the Indians, with their wonderful, art.
49;We enjoyed the movie however the disk seemed to skip and hesitate several times we will have to clean it again to see if it improves the play back
50;This is a masterpiece and one of the best movies ever made.
51;Costner, himself, was never a great actor, but story, supporting actors, and directing more than make up for it (although he did actually do a pretty decent job).
52;This was such a great movie that James Cameron plagiarized it and made it a hit again when he put out Avatar.
53;He loves this movie and rates it high.
54;He wore several hats on this film, and still managed to do a decent acting job.
55;This is a good action movie.
56;It's a good little peak into the past movie if you will and I liked it.
57;I really like the story and the overall theme of this movie.
58;good condition and received on time.
59;Best ever love Costner's roll really tpokbest ever movie love costner stroll really take you to another place you should be proud of this month
60;the extra hour added to the film makes it much more enjoyabl, adds more to the story line, great pick up for the collection
61;But a wonderful love story and heartwarming personal relationships developed.
62;I know this is a very PC movie but I love the sweeping camera shots and Costner's vision (maybe not the real deal) of the West.
63;For years the studios have put it off due to lack of interest and Costner's persistence that his director's cut was THE best possible one of the film, but here it is in all it's timeless glory.
64;A near perfect classic in it's most essential form.
65;I highly recommend this movie for a sit down and relaxing night.
66;upon opening it, I discovered that I had the uncut .
67;scenes added Costner preferred version with an additional 50 minutes.
68;(OK, so I will have to take a potty break.)
69;As promised, the character development was better, the WS shots are beautiful.
70;Dances With Wolves is Kevin Costner's finest film to date, hands down.
71;While the actual story is a tad revisionistic, it is very entertaining.
72;While the original theatrical cut works with an odd sense of mystery at the beginning, this is also an interesting addition adding an unnecessary, but fun cut that solves the mystery.
73;It was, to me, a very important piece of the puzzle and I finally understood what Costner meant in that scene.
74;He is becoming a man who does not fit anywhere.
75;This is a very key moment that, with this small addition in the film, makes the movie so much deeper and Dunbar's character arc much more compelling and real.
76;this is one of the few movies that used their cut scenes to great effect, similar to the extended cuts of the Lord of the Rings.
77;They are great for superfans, but also great for the regular viewer.
78;But if you like the story as much as I do, there are so many more delightful details to experience.
79;If you've ever traveled through the Dakotas this will bring back pleasant memories.
80;Cover and overall presentation was very good, it looked like one of the books.
81;It was great to have two discs with extras.
82;It's a great movie that does not glorify the Indians nor does it make them completely evil.
83;ray edition does give it a superb rich background in all it's splendor of the American Plains.
84;This movie is a lifetime epic.
85;It's good for all ages.
86;Dances With Wolves is a great movie.
87;I got this for my husband for Christmas one year, and he loved it.
88;The extended version is so much better than the one shown in the theaters.
89;A film that is truly breathtaking, `Dances with Wolves' has a lot to admire.
90;"The film is gorgeous to look at
I:8880;91;The story told is often engrossing and delicately handled for the most part, always grasping our attention despite the films lengthy running time.
I:8880;92;The acting is mostly effective and at times it is amazing.
I:8880;93;The emotional impact the audience is left with is sweeping and easy to get caught up in for the subject is presented in a very passionate way by Costner.
I:8880;94;like I said"
95;Alone and lonely John soon finds himself a target of the Native Americans nearby, but what starts as a hazardous relationship shifts to one of promise and hope as the Indians befriend John.
96;One particular Indian, Kicking Bird, is determined to communicate with John in order to find out what the White Man's plans are and when he is coming.
97;Kicking Bird uses Stands With A Fist to do this.
98;Stands With A Fist is a white woman who has been living as an Indian most of her life.
99;`Dances with Wolves' has a sweeping range of focus, shifting from a drama to a romance to a morally important film, and Costner's steady hand and keen eye help make the transitions effortless and captivating.
100;the acting is a nice facet of the film.
101;The film hinges on Costner though, and he delivers a beautifully complete performance.
102;His emotional journey is brilliantly portrayed for us throughout the entire film, flowing effortlessly from loneliness, anger, admiration, love, loyalty, betrayal and honor.
103;"as a whole `Dances with Wolves' works wonderfully
I:8880;104;I would recommend this movie without reservation, but I hesitate to call it a masterpiece.
I:8880;105;It is a very good film, a great one at that, and as far as `sweeping epics' go, it manages to capture just about every facet of what makes those films to wonderful.
I:8880;106;It works very well, but it is not perfect.
I:8880;107;The story unfolds to great friendship and love, and you're faced with a whole new vision on the native indians.
I:8880;108;All main actors has given their best performance which adds incredible depth to the movie.
I:8880;109;The musical score is fantastic, and it all comes well after the directing of Kevin Costner.
I:8880;110;There are pretty few movies that capture so well the roots of America.
I:8880;111;In few words a film about how the American land lost their innocence, highly recommended.
I:8880;112;i love this movie and i am so happy to own it this has always been one of my very favriots thanks
I:8880;113;This was one of the best movies I ever saw.
I:8880;114;The 20th anniversary edition is really great.
I:8880;115;This movie runs right up there with the best of them.
I:8880;116;The plot was so well written it almost seemed like it was real.
I:8880;117;The scenery was excellent and it was an all.
I:8880;118;This is an outstanding movie, and the acting was suberb.
I:8880;119;The historical content was good to see in a film.
I:8880;120;I thought it was a very well done film.
I:8880;121;Still a film I'd recommend.
I:8880;122;The performances are great and so realistic!
I:8880;123;I enjoy it and watch it often!
I:8880;124;It captures what I believe to be the true time period!
I:8880;125;This is already a beautiful movie but in Blue Ray it's exceptional!
I:8880;126;Dances with Wolves is brilliant.
I:8880;127;I own both the standard three hour wide screen version laser disc of Dances with Wolves as well as the special four hour edition.
I:8880;128;Well it is definitely better.
I:8880;129;the core story is short but the telling is rich in nuance.
I:8880;130;As a reward, he is given the use of the best doctor and an unlimited choice of duty.
I:8880;131;Over the course of time he is drawn more and more into their community.
I:8880;132;Everyone knows that this movie is the winner of 7 Academy Awards to include Best Picture of 1990.
I:8880;133;The storyline is very well orchestrated and reveals some deep cold realities of the Civil War"
134;The DTS audio in this movie is by far the best that I have experience.
135;"This DTS audio track utilizes a perfect 5.1 channel mix consistently, and the bass (subwoofer) output is tremendous
I:8880;136;Kevin Costner is a great actor!
I:8880;137;He's just one man with a smart horse!
I:8880;138;I have always heard this movie to be one of kevin costners best movies and now that i have seen it i agree it has great story and a moral to it too.
I:8880;139;One of the greatest movies EVER!!!
I:8880;140;I loved this movie when it first came out in theaters.
I:8880;141;My favorite character has always been, Stands With a Fist
I:8880;142;No matter how many times I watch Dances with Wolves I always enjoy it and notice something new.
I:8880;143;The movie does a great job of combining some humor while dealing with a serious subject matter.
I:8880;144;it included a book with script"
145;Yes, some of the added scenes leave you wondering why the didn't leave them on the cutting room floor the second time, but it's okay as Dances With Wolves is still my favorite film of all time, even after nearly 13 years after its initial release.
146;How convenient that the evil Sioux captured an English speaking woman who is both beautiful and robust!
147;Instead of portraying the Indians in a truthful manner, Costner singlehandedly misinterprets their culture as something bordering on vanity and he does so by extinguishing their intelligence and ability to live in harmony with nature.
148;A long movie, but well worth it.
149;For the first time in my life, I saw a tribe of our Native American population, portrayed as compassionate and caring.
150;This type of information had never been taught in public school or college!My friends and I stood outside the theatre that night, discussing the wonderful epic we had just experienced, for quite a while.
151;it has been 18 years and DWW is still my all.
152;Thanks to the internet and other available resources, my family tree has expanded to over 5,500 people.
153;Many of my Scottish and English ancestors intermarried with Native Americans.
154;I have Cherokee, English, Scottish, and French ancestors, all mixed with remarkable and extended lines from all over the globe.
155;whether the story line is credible or not to others, I know it's possible.
156;So, thank you Kevin Costner and Michael Blake, for making a movie that has been such an inspiration.
157;I enjoy the longer version since it covers some questions left after viewing the shorter one.
158;ray version is well worth it.
159;I still relate to some of the actors that I see in other movies since they really shined in Wolves .
160;I saw this again the other night and realized that it's become one of my favorite films of all time.
161;That's especially relevant these days when the world is getting smaller all the time.
162;In a hundred years this film will still be as popular as it is now.
163;I wish I had more thumbs!
164;I enjoy all movies i enjoy western i would recommend this movie to everyone It shows how life is back then
165;This film is one of the most beautiful.
166;It's a winner all the way around.
167;Glad I bought it, and it waws a great price too!
168;Great picture about the Native Americans and the history of our country.
169;Very beautiful scenery and amazing wildlife such as the buffalo.
170;beautiful color, details, and landscapes.
171;add it to your collection when you can find it at a good price.
172;Kevin Costner is so good in this movie and all supporting actors.
173;Kevin Costner plays a very good part.
174;Some parts are sad some are happy as with live.
175;researched and appriate story of honor, respect and humility, for those who might be ready for it.
176;I have watched this movie about three times and still enjoy.
177;Interesting time in our history.
178;costner obviously in in love with Costner, but I can overlook that and enjoy the rest.
179;This movie was beautifully filmed and should be a delight to view.
180;I loved this movie by Kevin Costner and believe it's his best work to date.
181;I really enjoyed it and I believe it truly represented a look at the untamed West that will never be seen again and an untarnished look at the Indian natives that were so poorly treated by the Americans.
182;Told with fun, action, wit, great music, incredible scenary.
183;An epic story about humankind's thousands year old effort to battle against prejudice, and to look beyond prejudice, to see the good in each other, and to choose love, rather than war.
184;Fascinating realistic look at how people lived in that age.
185;The truth is probably somewhere in between, and is beyond understanding by the casual reader / movie viewer.
186;in spite of the message, the movie is lively, entertaining, with occasional emotional touches.
187;A good evenings entertainment, worth watching again.
188;A great movie, well done, Indian history from the human side.
189;One of my top five favorite movies!
190;Gorgeous scenery, great music, fascinating story line.
191;Makes you want to head to the Black Hills.
192;They warred among themselves, took slaves, practiced cruelty.
193;truth that might is right : those that had the power and the numbers inevitably took from those with lesser or power and smaller numbers.
194;With all its faults past and present it is still the best that the world has to offer.
195;a great loss for humanity.
196;What we can do is recognize what has happened in the past and work together to keep it from happening again.
197;This film might just give you the impetus to do so.
198;time favorite movie, 20 years after I first saw it, back in 1991 .
199;if anyone has more information about this matter, I'll appreciate the help !
200;This movie explores a key piece of our history.
201;Very sympathetic to the plight of the Native Americans.
202;The story line, scenery, etc was wonderful.
203;Playback from chapters 18 onwards was perfect, so if you're happy just to watch the beginning and end of a movie, and miss everything in between, then Dances with Wolves DTS is for you.
204;Great cinematography and feeling like I was in the movie and living it's sequences.
205;Costner does a good job as do all of the characters.
206;i am sure that i will be happy with it when i finally get to watch it.
207;I have always loved this movie and think it's one of the best of all time.
208;The acting is superb and the scenery amazing.
209;One of my all time favorite movies.
210;It's nice to see an extended 3hrs 56 minute version(55 minutes of new footage) and to see all the behind the scenes footage, documentaries, etc.
211;Nobody likes flip disc !
212;This is the director's cut with an additional 55 minutes or so extra.
213;The movie is more developed with the extra footage.
214;Also the romance between Stands with Fist and Dances with Wolves was expanded.
215;There are also breathtaking scenes shot in the Black Hills.
216;i reckon it's worth acquiring!
217;In a Word: PhenomenalCaptures the beauty of the original with additional content.
218;definitely worth the price and the wait.
219;This is a classic as far as my husband is concerned.
220;ray, so I ordered it for a gift for him.
221;As great now as it was when it first came out.
222;great for the whole family!
223;I slept twice during this movie.
224;See my reference in the above summary to this disc.
225;This is probably the most memorable of Costner's movies made even more memorable on blu.
226;The images were greatly enhanced and the sound quite clear.
227;A great choice for any movie buff!
228;I saw it a few years ago, loved it then, love it now.
229;in my opinion, Costner's depiction of how things were between Indians and White Men was true to form.
230;something I liked about this movie was that women were not shown as being second.
231;one of the most poignant scenes in the movie is when Kevin Costner gets the wolf to take meat from his hand.
232;i am so impressed by the movie, that I have ordered the book, and the audio version of the original novel.
233;"Timeless tale told in beautiful cinematography
I:8880;234;I forgot just how good this movie is.
I:8880;235;Everyone should see this movie.
I:8880;236;Great story and great music!
I:8880;237;It adds a few more scenes to an already long movie but well worth it.
I:8880;238;Amazing look into the times of the American Frontier.
I:8880;239;An awesome story about fairness and understanding.
I:8880;240;I found it very informative to watch the culture of the Sioux and enjoyed the plot of Dances with Wolves journey.
I:8880;241;Truly one of the best in my collection!
I:8880;242;Kevein Costner made a very good movie that will live on forever and should be in the best of all.
I:8880;243;This was a gift and it arrived in perfect condition!
I:8880;244;it won 7 acadamy awards.)
I:8880;245;He mets a gentle wolf, and he mets an even gentler Sioux tribe who soon befriend him.
I:8880;246;This movie is SO excellent!
I:8880;247;Kevin Costner undoubtedly had epic aspirations for Dances with Wolves.
I:8880;248;His desire to create a cinematic powerhouse, on par with ambitious classics like Gone with the Wind, is clear from the movie's length (a never dull 3 hours)"
249;While the film excels on several levels, it is in this last area .
250;that I feel Dances with Wolves achieves its greatest success.
251;Its colors are rich and warm, the sweeping landscape shots are amazing, and several scenes .
252;If for no other reason, I would recommend watching this movie for its aesthetic pleasures.
253;It is here that he develops a relationship with the local Sioux tribe.
254;"The story unfolds as you might expect: Costner grows to respect the Sioux and their way of live
I:8880;255;to tell you the truth, the plot .
I:8880;256;Costner's character is a perfect hero: brave, noble, kind (in other words, somewhat flat).
I:8880;257;The Sioux are, likewise, practically faultless: they demonstrate tight familial bonds"
258;While this movie is not exactly groundbreaking, it is very sweet, very entertaining and very well done.
259;It's certainly worth a watch.
260;Awesome Movie and Awesome Service keep up the great service and selection it is appreciated.
261;Costner and his crew made an epic that tells the truth.
262;There is absolutely nothing I dislike about this movie.
263;It is near the top of my 50 favorite movies of all time.
264;Marvelous, believable storyline holding very close to the total truth of a section of history of Americas' Natives.
265;Entire cast and their acting is among the best ever.
266;"This is an absolutely ""must have"" for any movie."
267;The basic story is timeless and could be placed on nearly any era throughout history.
268;"The idea that history is written by the ""winner"" is brought out very clearly as this movie strives to contrast the traditional ""cowboys and Indians"" perception as portrayed in many history books and Hollywood productions since the 40's."
269;As it stands, the careful viewer will be able to enjoy this five star movie as it does well to communicate with the time it has, most of what Costner intended.
270;"Rivaled only by ""Field of Dreams"", this is clearly Costner's masterpiece in film, both in production and in acting."
271;Simply a great work overall.
272;Well worth the time spent watching it.
273;"She tried hard and it came across okay, but her appearance (esp the hastily messed up ""modern beauty shop"" style hair ."
274;She is better in Battlestar G as a future President.
275;Again, overall, one great movie.
276;just one of many of kevin's achievements!
277;the characters are great, and the story kept me spellbound from the start to the finish!
278;Wow, what a movie filled with contradictions.
279;Incidentally, this actor was the best in the movie, imho).
280;In short, it portrays all that was good about native American life, while almost TOTALLY disregarding its negatives .
281;"compare it to the excellent, more mature 1993 film ""Last of the Mohicans"" starring Daniel Day."
282;"In ""Mohicans"" the Indians are correctly well armed, reasonably aware of the politico."
283;e. g. the French and Indian War), and above all are shown with human foibles and vices .
284;"this movie rested its laurels on an incredibly good scenery/cinematic effort, and a sympathetic PC culture of the very late 1980s and early 1990s as far as its ""theme"" or ""messsage"" was concerned."
285;lewis, teamed with a competent director, might have done with this idea?The movie did help kick off a resurgence of Western.
286;When I heard that, I was shocked.
287;This is one of the best films ever made, and at least with this one, the 'powers that be' took notice, and gave it 7 oscars.
288;This is an epic of a film that sees John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) during the US civil war.
289;He arrives to find it deserted.
290;dunbar begins interacting with the local Sioux indians in what is some of the best film ever shot.
291;The characters are rich and full of life, and the indian culture is portrayed as both beautiful and violent.
292;They are well worth the extra price, and make a great addition to the film.
293;The added hour of footage gives more insight into the characters and really make this film better believe it or not.
294;all that said, I feel that this film is one of the best movies ever made, and that everyone should watch it at least once.
295;I think it gives a bit of insight into the plight of the native americans, and shows us how their culture existed in harmony with nature before Europeans came.
296;I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I do.
297;I still love the DTS version which was release in 2 dics by IMAGE .
298;great movie with great first time DIRECTOR , KEVIN COSTNER .
299;The story is so interesting and the characters are so rich and complex.
300;This is simply my favorite film of all time.
301;This is the closest to perfect I have found.
302;When thinking about all of the elements that make up a great movie .
303;writing, directing, acting, cinematography, scoring .
304;this is a true epic.
305;Sweeping scenery, beautiful music, a terrific story, wonderful acting and great directing.
306;It takes the movie to just about 4 hours but it is worth it.
307;Have I said I just love this movie yet?Okay if you don't know anything about this movie you are in for a treat.
308;sIDEBAR: Robert Pastorelli, best known for playing the painter Eldin on the TV Series Murphy Brown, plays a small but memorable roll as Timmons, the man who takes Dunbar to the frontier.
309;"As Dunbar says in the movie, ""He is quite possibly the foulest man I've ever met."""
310;Now this is where the movie gets really good.
311;from here on out it is about his relationship with the Sioux Indians, falling in love with one of them, and finding out who he really is.
312;It is terrific to see a man change into who he is supposed to be, and that is what you get here.
313;kicking Bird, played brilliantly by Graham Greene, is the tribes Holy Man.
314;The relationship between Dunbar and Kicking Bird is a struggle but it is enjoyable to watch.
315;Watching her struggle with this at first is wonderful.
316;The two of them have sparks flying off them and the passion between them is electric.
317;the internal struggles of the characters is just one of the added measures that makes this film glorious.
318;The strength of this film lies in its characters and the writing.
319;It is a fiction movie and as such uses creative license, some of which has caused people to get angry.
320;It is meant to entertain and that it does.
321;It allows you to see and feel what that time might have been like.
322;The length is one of its strengths.
323;Get the movie, get comfortable and get ready for a treat.
324;It is worth every minute.
325;If you haven't already seen it, then please do, and come back here and tell us how much it moved you.
326;I've always loved this story.
327;Though the Indians are 'all' Americans and the military/police state is taking our liberty and property as they please.
328;Gave it a four instead of five because I'm not a big fan of Costner in particular but he did a great job in this film, both directing and starring.
329;Great movie, love seeing it on blue ray, I also didn't realize it was a extended version, there was a lot of little parts I've never seen before.
330;One of the best films ever made!
331;I received it very fast as well, within 3 days.
332;This film is not only well written and acted, but it also carries with it a very compelling anti.
333;There are so many scenes in it which you can watch over and over again.
334;it is a very introspective film and if you aren't one for epic movies then give this a miss.
335;If however you don't mind watching a movie for a really long time you will be rewarded by experiencing a truly classic film.
336;"It was one of the 1st realistic westerns
I:8880;337;i was very pleased with the story, was entertaining, yet sad to visualize how we (Americans) bullied our way into the country.
I:8880;338;This was a Christmas gift.
I:8880;339;She loved it in blu.
I:8880;340;thank you very good product and got product in a timely manner hope we could do bussiness again thank you
I:8880;341;All the scenes when John Dunbar was in Indian country with the Indians makes this film so great.
I:8880;342;The acting, costumes and scenery were fantastic.
I:8880;343;The film portrays John Dunbar's Indian friends in a very positive light.
I:8880;344;This is my all time favorite movie.
I:8880;345;It offers an amazing insight into what happened to one American Indian tribe.
I:8880;346;It's peaceful, has great cinematography, and a very good story line.
I:8880;347;This is a film that should be required viewing by everyone.
I:8880;348;I hadn't seen this film in many years and it was terrific to revisit, if only for the cinematography.
I:8880;349;Thankfully, I also appreciate Costner's acting in this epic.
I:8880;350;Like in a lot of cases of extended editions (as opposed to director's cut), the extended version is simply an alternate take"
351;I always liked Dances with Wolves, the directorial debut for Kevin Costner and multiple Academy Award winner, but I always felt like the sum of its parts won me over but maybe not as a unified whole.
352;Hanging around the camp is a wolf he names Two.
353;the extra scenes are meant to develop the story and offer more background and taken on their own, they actually work pretty fine.
354;as far as the film is concerned, it's quite a great film with some gorgeous cinematography, excellent performances and some pretty exciting action scenes.
355;Costner might not have the most immense range but there is quite a few films where he is convincing and this is one of them.
356;It reminds me of the Lord of the Rings extended cuts where all the main in.
357;DANCES WITH WOLVES is a wonderful addition to any history and literature class which is where I intend to use this movie.
358;I really enjoyed the characters, the plot, the musical score and the directing.
359;When I first saw Dances With Wolves, I was touched by the stunning portrait of the frontier that Kevin Costner captured.
360;It was a moving experience that inspired my own videography career to new heights.
361;The characters truly benefit the added scenes that make even four hours seem priceless and timeless.
362;and then the extras, the features about how the film was produced will simply send you on a cinematic and emotional trek.
363;NEVER have I been so awed by the style, technique and commitment to a project, NEVER.
364;Never again I believe shall we see such heart, such gentle yet realistic portrayals of how this country once was.
365;He will always be the master director and brilliant actor beyond the other movies he has made.
366;thank you to Costner and the rest of the crew and the studio for updating this awesome film.
367;A classic example of the most important movie of the 90s and a western classic , no doubt is the best movie I had wached
368;hopefully, they'll get it right (the sound, the extras and even the case!)
369;This would also be a very nice tribute to Mr. Barry, who passed away on January 30th.
370;I love the buffalo stampede scene.
371;This movie is probably my most favorite of Kevin Costner's, just because everything was done right: costumes, time period, use of land, and many other things pertinent to the time period.
372;It's just an overall great film.
373;I really enjoy the movie and the bonus features were awesome!
374;it's Kevin Costner in the best movie he ever was in if anyone hasn't seen this movie that's just sad.
375;There is good reason this masterpiece film won at the Academy Awards, and good reason it has garnered rave reviews worldwide.
376;The story and acting is absolutely moving and believable, and the scenery and cinematography stunning to say the least.
377;You have to be an automaton, or someone with a very selfish and/or skewed personal agenda, to dislike this great film.
378;Powerful and compelling, without a doubt.
379;This film is full of such ironies, such stabs at integrity and the perverse consequences of breathtaking chances taken in good faith.
380;if one man on an ego trip could finally dip down into the sources of real creativity and produce something wonderous, Costner did it here, dancing with wolves and with the wilderness so ably framed throughout the film.
381;more than cinematic, more than a love story, more than the tale of Sioux in retreat and an Everyman figure in his own retreat from the civilization that betrays everything for money and power, the dance herein traces the lineaments of a new kind of life, a life lived close to the natural fiber of things.
382;One person in so. called real life, they lend to us in the realm of imagination their very noblest selves.
383;In their productions, in their roles: this is who they truly are!
384;it's also a visual feast, stunning in parts such as the Buffalo stampedes.
385;ray edition will be released in the coming years.)
386;but, overall, it's a memorable, gorgeous film that digs deep inside you.
387;It, to me, is the best movie about the great Sioux people ever made.
388;The extended version is worth every minute.
389;The cast is superb, the dialogue intelligent and the acting is near flawless.
390;Odds of a whit guy being assimilated and revered in a Native community seem pretty far.
391;ray with all the extra scenes, absolutely worth having in my movie library.
392;This BR DISC is clearly an astounding value.
393;The images are crystal clear and the audio is excellent.
394;Suffice to say it is an epic masterpiece, ranking up there with Gone With The Wind, Out Of Africa, Lawrence Of Arabia and the like.
395;This edition has over an hour of extra or extended scenes which help to give more depth and clarity to the story.
396;Unlike many Directors Cuts or Extended Editions for other movies, these additions are integral to the story and help to give the viewer a fuller and richer experience in watching the movie in its full intended length.
397;But over time I eased up on Dances With Wolves and recognized it for its beauty, for its intricacy, for its story of friendships overcoming outward divisions, and for its epic exploration of a lost culture and its way of life.
398;wise in setting a film in pre.
399;I would love to see more made, and hope someday I will.
400;Seeing this film reminds me of all the great museum exhibits of a sad and convicting story of colonial through industrial America's treatment of this country's most original and beautiful inhabitants and people.
401;Their love for and survival on the land, while not harming it with excess living, as the the M. o. for Today's American in habitants.
402;the sweep and grandeur of the films great plains is breathtaking.
403;A moving and perfectly crafted film.
404;i strongly recommend watching the un.
405;Also, brings more splendor and passion to the film.
406;Some movies are just so well done that one never tires of watching them.
407;They made for great family viewing!
408;"I am not a fan of Kevin Costner
I:8880;409;This one you could tell held his spirit very well.
I:8880;410;He's not a hero, he's not an over achiever, he is just a man alured by the majestic, mystical, and beautiful culture and environment of the native land and her people.
I:8880;411;I applaud Mr. Costner on this masterful film.
I:8880;412;Tremendous effort, beautiful imagery, incredible performances, including his own, and a desire to pause our own lives to ensure we all move through this life with a little more care, grace, and appreciation.
I:8880;413;He's a great actor in this movie.
I:8880;414;Dances With Wolves was, at that time, the most amazing thing I'd ever seen.
I:8880;415;Its leisurely pace, the subtitles, the wide.
I:8880;416;open spaces, the landscapes .
I:8880;417;To say nothing of the score, the photography, the writing, the characters, the acting, and Kevin Costner's lovely, skillful, controlled direction.
I:8880;418;This is one of the best movies of the 1990s (or, I guess, late 1980s).
I:8880;419;This was a great movie I hand't seen for many years.
I:8880;420;The price was right so I bought it and wasn't disappointed.
I:8880;421;That spirit pervades through the movie as Costner's character has a level of honesty mixed with naivety that serves him well with his encounters, not so much with the civilized man, but with domestic animals, starting with his horse, animals of the wild and his future Lakota friends.
I:8880;422;The film captures the lifestyle of the Sioux from Costner's eyes but also gives the viewer the 180 view of the Sioux, looking at the white men as peculiar and wasteful while the Sioux explaing their own values to Costner and by example.
I:8880;423;An absolutely beautiful movie with an added love interest as Costner meet's a woman within the tribe that creates an unusual but accepted match.
I:8880;424;Well done film and Graham Greene (Thunderheart) and Rodney Grant (Son of the Morning Star) play realistic thoughtful and brave Sioux respectively.
I:8880;425;One of the best movies ever.
I:8880;426;Now I know why this is my dad's favorite movie.
I:8880;427;It is now one of my favorites.
I:8880;428;Received in good order and at a satisfactory price!
I:8880;429;think is best movie for Kevin Costner.
I:8880;430;dances with wolves is a classic.
I:8880;431;Stands with fist does the white man and his talk.
I:8880;432;The scenery is magificent and the characters become even more rich and entertaining.
I:8880;433;This is the only way I'll continue to enjoy this film.
I:8880;434;This is a great movie for them to see how the relationship of the Native American and the moving West affected their way of life.
I:8880;435;A great movie about the early West and life on the plains.
I:8880;436;It is good to watch to get an understanding of all of the problems that the early settlers had with both the environment and the Indians.
I:8880;437;This is one of the most epic movies ever made.
I:8880;438;If you haven't seen Dances With Wolves, now is a good time to order it.
I:8880;439;It is this attention to detail that makes shopping on Amazon a joy!
I:8880;440;Movie, as always is amazing, even more so when you can place the scenery, which is a beautiful part of the country.
I:8880;441;wonderful pacing, so many great moments.
I:8880;442;Such great sadness in parts.
I:8880;443;The movie makes me long for the frontier days prior to the winning of the West.
I:8880;444;Very disapointed as I've seen this cut.
I:8880;445;One of the best photography film ever made!May be much better scanned (4k may be?)
I:8880;446;, but is fine anyway.
I:8880;447;I love Kevin Costner movies.
I:8880;448;With this movie I get the best of both world.
I:8880;449;I think he is one of this ages best actors by far.
I:8880;450;He is a well rounded actor and this is one of his good ones.
I:8880;451;This two Disc 20th Anniversary is well done.
I:8880;452;Have always loved this movie, and refreshed myself by watching it for the first time in a few years.
I:8880;453;It's a captivating story of the late.1800's American frontier, truly captured by the beautiful cinematography, and I think Kevin Costner is at his absolute best in this movie.
I:8880;454;From the very beginning, its themes seem to perfectly capture the expanse, and pristine nature of the great frontier of the time.
I:8880;455;One of the best westerns ever!
I:8880;456;Great and realistic depiction of the Lakota.
I:8880;457;Some movies work fine without hi.

I:8880;465;Kevin Costneris brilliant in this movie.
I:8880;466;The movie is well acted and well thought out.
I:8880;467;Background helps in this instance.
I:8880;468;Recommend it to anyone who loves Costner or enjoys the multicultural undertones.
I:8880;469;This movie is incredibly brilliant.
I:8880;470;Shows the true meaning of life and harmony as one.

506;I learned the beauty of the Native American people and their land over those years.
507;Every time I watch this movie my connection with both land and people is rekindled.
508;This is a special movie, one that treats the Sioux and what is now our shameful history with great dignity, insight, and respect.
509;Costner was paying respect to the Native Americans and that was a good thing that he did.
510;It is absolutely wonderful and for those who love the movie as much as I do, it is a gift.
511;The film changed my life and will always be my favorite.

521;DANCES WITH WOLVES is a tale of two movies.
522;The first film is a moving, epic story about Lt. John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) who accepts a post at a remote fort in the Dakotas and turns out to be the only soldier there.
523;It is a beautiful, wonderful story.
524;DANCES WITH WOLVES is a moving, well.
525;I can watch this movie over and over.

536;Watching the transformation of a soldier dedicated to his post to becoming a friend of the Indian is quite moving.
537;There is a lot to like.
538;Great movie I saw it years ago and loved watching it again.
539;This theme movie embraces the hardship man places on each other.
540;It vividly details the difference between a good path in life and one not so good.
541;The movie is chock full of brilliant visuals as a well as having a story line that is extremely believable.
542;This is a classic and a proud introduction to the Native American heritage as Westerns prior to this depicted Native Americans as thieving, conniving, corrupt peoples.
543;I am proud to be a Native American and this movie manages to capture and solidify the magnificent heritage of Native Americans.
544;In a word,this movie is wondrous.
545;This is truly a great American epic.

549;The soundtrack, written by John Barry, is top notch and is integrated into the movie to an extent [both in emotional importance and in appropriate timing] that surpasses any movie score I've ever heard.

560;Yes it is visually stunning, yes the score is beautiful,(except the ridiculous electronic dance sequence).
561;This movie has a message though and it is perfectly willing to hit you over the head with it.
562;Indians, at least the Sioux Indians are clean, laundered, chaste, pure of heart and speech.
563;When we are all clean and pure we get new names.
564;I very much enjoyed this movie from the beginning as it encapsulated me into our not too distant past and portrayed the interesting relationships some had with the native americans that inhabited the land.
565;I thought the acting from the main character was very good and even though the movie is quite long, you don't feel like looking at your watch as you're so drawn to what will happen next.
566;All in all, I highly recommend for people to see this whether they are movie buffs, like the main actor, or are into action and beautiful scenery.
567;The movie by far again its the greatest ive ever seen even compared to the movies of my generation.
568;It has a beautiful script that no one should miss.

I:8880;574;Definitely on my One of the Best Movies I've Ever Seen List .
I:8880;575;Critically acclaimed but often overlooked, this is Costner at his best.
I:8880;576;Like him or not, this is a must see film that feels very authentic and is even more beautiful on Blu.
I:8880;577;This is a film that endures in every department.
I:8880;578;Not having the time to watch the film the day I received it I put the Blu.
I:8880;579;I set it up with the second commentary track in which the director of photography and the editor recall their experiences.
I:8880;580;I was so fascinated with their comments and seeing the Blu.
I:8880;581;This is a film that I would rank as one of the great classics of all time.
I:8880;582;As you listen to those who worked on the film tell of their experiences it soon becomes clear that this was landmark film for most everyone involved.
I:8880;583;For many it remains their favorite film to have worked on.
I:8880;584;They are worth looking at as they, like the film itself, are inspiring.
I:8880;585;Kevin Costner is very convincing in his portrayal of a civil war soldier who wants to see the west before it is over run by civilization
I:8880;586;Also, many scenes of interaction with the wolf, and several good scenes from the lives of the Lakota tribe .
I:8880;587;Very long, even if the film and score are very good.
I:8880;588;movie arrived before schedule and was in great condition.
I:8880;589;definitely order from these guys again.
I:8880;590;I've always loved this movie.
I:8880;591;Wow, this is a powerful movie.
I:8880;592;I recently rewatched it after several years and suddenly remembered what really makes a great movie.
I:8880;593;I love how """"Dances with Wolves"""" begins with an intimate portrait of the American West, from the vast plains to the charismatic wolf """"Two."""
594;The acting is superb all around.
595;Dances with Wolves is an emotional and visional treat.
596;This movie is a great depictor of the internal struggle people have with encountering the other and learning to embrace difference.
597;Also, shows beautiful scenes of the American west.
598;this i think was one of his main points of this great movie.
599;also check out open range.
600;One has to see it again and again to really grasp the greatness of it.
601;Then, it compares the values of this civilization to the indian culture living in symbiotic existence with nature and wild life.
602;And it actually succeeds, without being overly cheesy or overbearing, atleast not in my view.
603;This film is an epic in every sense of the word.
604;that said, it is definitely Kevin Costner's best film to date (though I eagerly await his latest Western and third film as a director, OPEN RANGE).
605;He is one of my favorite actors, and he does his finest work here.
606;What's most impressive about the film is how realisitc it is.
607;The world of the Native Americans comes to elegant life with incredible detail (and it only cost $18.5 million to make).
608;"The love story works incredibly well, and the cast is dazzling
I:8880;609;And since this is the highlight of the extras, it's all the more crushing.
I:8880;610;This movie is a delight for anybody not familiar with the real west.
I:8880;611;The warriors used to pick up women as they pleased, drop them, and pick up others.
I:8880;612;Its easy now with the internet.
I:8880;613;The music is so very beautiful.
I:8880;614;:)It became an instant classic, with good reason.
I:8880;615;I have rarely seen such a moving and beautiful movie as Dances with Wolves.
I:8880;616;The stunning thing is that it was directed by Kevin Costner, who did a brilliant job as actor as well.
I:8880;617;Everything about this film is first rate.
I:8880;618;I would also add that this is a long movie, but it puts you right there on the prairie and some of the moments are almost excruciatingly beautiful.
I:8880;619;I really dug the extended version.
I:8880;620;IMO, this is one of Kevin Costner's very best in acting, directing, and producing.
I:8880;621;Good acting, a bit of history Hollywood style, and a great love story.
I:8880;622;I've loved this movie so I got it to add to my library.
I:8880;623;I received it in EXCELLENT condition and would definitely order from the seller again.
I:8880;624;I never saw a more heart.
I:8880;625;A wonderful story of part of our frontier history.
I:8880;626;Anything Kevin Costner plays in is good, he's a great actor and a good guy, have seen all his movies.
I:8880;627;This is a favorite movie of mine and the way this movie came in the special jacket was beautiful.
I:8880;628;I love this movie from when it first came out having a closeness to the American Indian.
I:8880;629;Golden oldie and one of my favorite films.
I:8880;630;This movie was a good production showing the way life was back when the frontier in the USA was being forged.
I:8880;631;It showed it from both sides .
I:8880;632;The mutual respect shown in this movie was moving.
I:8880;633;rated years back, but now I hope people will enjoy and understand the meaning of this film .
I:8880;634;well done Kevin Costner for Producing and Directing it too.
I:8880;635;Kostner's Best Ever, great script, great acting, wonderfully long, beautiful camera work, I wouldn't change a thing.
I:8880;636;Probably the best period peace in it's genre.
I:8880;637;Still the best film I've yet seen.
I:8880;638;Through the journals he keeps his humanity is divulged, the experiences decribed become real, his own meeting with a wolf and the feeling of communication between them totally silent whose sensitivity so rarely seen is something else.
I:8880;639;The meetings for the first time with the Sioux and the friendships he forms, this is what makes this film more than just a movie.
I:8880;640;The Sioux are beautiful, intelligent, dignified, and full of wisdom.
I:8880;641;And that Winchestor rifle Kevin uses to slay the buffalo .
I:8880;642;I also recommend the wonderful 'Broken Arrow' (1950) by Delmer Daves for a moving portrayal of Whites and Native American trying to work out peace.
I:8880;643;My favorite movie of all time.
I:8880;644;This is a very touching historic picture.
I:8880;645;Welles' first film was the brilliant """"Citizen Kane"""" and his work after that was all downhill when compared with that masterpiece and the same could be said for Costner's """"Dances With Wolves""""."""
646;One thing this 20th Anniversary Blu.
647;"ray the definitive release and the best way to view Costner's ""Citizen Kane""."
648;The extra disc with special features and making of documentaries is also a nice plus and so is the cardboard slipcase.
649;Being a lover of Westerns myself it is always nice to watch a great film that shows the perspectives from both sides.
650;It's been said that there are 3 sides to every story: your side, my side and the truth and so if we truly hope to get at the truth we have to at least hear from both sides so that we can better get at the truth.
651;oops forget one more thing the soundtrack wow wow wow m. it is wow.
652;Costner carries the movie with real acting and voice.
653;Surprisingly, a number of animals come center stage in the screenplay and they do masterful, if mute, yeoman service for the story .
654;Kevin Costner is excellent in this roll.
655;Great view of the Native American attributes.
656;I have watched this movie so many times and each time I enjoy it more than the last.
657;It was also nice to see his humanity in accomodating the Sioux nation and dealing with its mishaps with other indian tribes.
658;I remember watching this as a kid and loved it.
659;It set the tone for the modern western movie.
660;This is a must watch.
661;Kevin Costner delivers a heart warming and very touching message in this movie.
662;"Kevin Costner's character soon meets this white woman raised by the Sioux, who have given her the indian name of,""Stands with fist,"" and the two of them soon fall in love."
663;I soon found my self falling in love with them as a people my self.
664;A very dramatic but also heartwarming and touching movie indeed.
665;As you watch this movie you soon feel the pain of what lies ahead for these brave, gentle, proud, and misunderstood people, as the white man invades they're land.
666;The movie was just an instant classic.
667;And it picked up a bunch of Academy Awards including best picture of 1990.
668;Now I found the movie on the Wal.
669;watched it last night and greatly enjoyed it the second time.
670;Very gradually, they forge a friendship which gradually grows until he is almost part of the tribe.
671;It's a wonderful, very human story.
672;it was an excellent movie.
673;I enjoyed watching it again these 22 years later and I was overwhelmed once again.
674;Movies this good don't come along very often.
675;The photography was excellent and really captured the scenery of Badlands National Park and the contiguous area of the South Dakota Great Plains.
676;The Sioux, in particular, really came across as genuine people and Kevin Costner as a very likable chap.
677;The story had a nice flow to it.
678;Sorry I loaned this one out but hope who ever has it, enjoyed it!
679;From the incredible cinematography to Michael Blakes brilliantly told story, it all comes together like a symphony under the direction on Kevin Costner.
680;Other than that, a great movie.
681;Very good acting and will watch it again.
682;then , this movie to me , is very special in that sense.
683;i realized that the story of the movie may be fictatious, but the scenery and panoramas of the great frontier, the prairie , the buffalo hunts are visually stunning and the lifestyle and the costume of the Indians are amazingly beautiful, complicated and yet very very human,I dont know how accurate this movie is in term of costumes and language and all, perhaps my American counterparts can tell me.
684;But knowing Spielberg, the highly acclaimed director and his reputation, I can safely said I believe the authenticities he put into his movies.
685;some of my most favourite scenes are vista and the surrounding, so peaceful and quiet, when Kevin Costner in that long bouts of silent comtemplation, the Indians on the horizon line on horses, the stray lonely wolf that followed the lone soldier everywhere and the frustration and barrier of communication as well as the exchanging of gifts are inspiring, comical as well as touching.
686;an invigorating and exciting movie.
687;it has a little comedy and a little drama but most of all, it has a lot of adventure.
688;a heartfelt but real look look at a large part of our history thatmany of us would sooner want to forget.
689;I will merely say that watching this classic with all of the restored scenes gives it much greater depth.
690;"extended Cut, Collector's Edition"" to your movie library is a must."
691;This is an all round, well made film.
692;It has a great cast, script, direction and special effects .
693;This was an epic education and a beautiful film besides.
694;Stunning cinemaphotography, fabulous costuming, unforgettable characters in an unforgettable story.
695;The deep respect with which the Native American people are depicted in this film is part of its eternal glory, and this kindly understanding of Native American ways is long overdue.
696;a fabulous film, even if you don't necessarily agree with it.
697;Still a great movie 20 years since it's first run in theaters.
698;I enjoyed it just as much or more that when I first viewed it, all those years ago.
699;Watch it with the kids.
700;so its amazing to me that they recut the movie to make it longer.
701;I would catagorize it with early 20th century pulp with a dash of late 20th century.
702;The additional footage makes a great movie excellent.
703;Looking forward to the 20th anniversary blu.
704;the landscape scenes are wonderful and I'm looking forward to them on the blu.
705;The first movie I ever saw that portrayed our American Indians as real people!
706;they laughed, made love, had families, and the the overall story is compelling.
707;I remember seeing this in the theatre back in 1990 for the first time.
708;Nobody chatted, nobody got up to visit the restrooms, nobody got up for refreshments, NOBODY took their eyes off this gorgeous film.
709;And, the music score by John Barry is the best i've ever heard.
710;every American should see this film, it captures so adroitly the beauty of the indigenous tribes and their old horse culture, and the wretched wrongs committed against them.
711;simply put it's my all.
712;This is such a well written, well directed and well acted story.
713;Visually, the vistas are breathtaking and the cinematography is very very good.
714;Kevin Coster, who also gives a great performance, directs the film wonderfully as well.
715;it compliments so well the emotion of the performances and of the tale itself, and makes this movie a truly sweeping epic.
716;Definitely one of my favourite films in my collection.
717;Skip ahead, the rest of the movie is wonderful.
718;I liked this movie very much.
719;I would recommend this movie to older children and up because of some of the harsh scenes portrayed.
720;Kevin Costner as an actor was very convincing in his bewildered state of mind when he took on the task as being the lone soldier protecting an area that is occupied by Indians.
721;I was surprised that this movie held up as well as it did.
722;A terrific video, a masterpiece.
723;A wonderful 3 hour film.
724;This is one of the ten best films of the last 15 years.
725;I welcome the respect given for native americans and their native language.
726;this was the outstanding film of 1990 winning 7 academy awards including best picture, best director, best original score and best cinematography.
727;This early Costner western epic made the man a super.
728;star and shall undoubtedly become a classic on the level of Gone With the Wind and The Searchers.
729;coated) side to 19th century Native Americans (the Sioux nations were referred to as enemy by all other planes tribes), this film is a genuine treat that shouldn't be missed.
730;Just one of the best movies I have ever seen.
731;the scenery was just spectacular,as was the performance of Kevin Costner and the rest of the staff.
732;A truely great movie a must have.
733;Highly enjoyable movie, especially the 4.
734;The pictures, the music simply amazing!
735;Dances With Wolves is my very favorite movie.
736;I've always loved this film and am very happy to now have it on BR.
737;This is the extended version with extra scenes which is interesting, but I can see why they cut some of the scenes, since the original film is rather long.
738;the scenery in BR combined with John Barry's GREAT score make for a perfect film.
739;The extras are also pretty decent, documentary stuff, commentary, etc, all are of interest, I especially liked the little bit about how the native american actors felt when they first tried on their costumes and how much that touched them.
740;I saw the theatrical cut of this American classic last year, and I finished watching the Extended Cut a few hours ago.
741;Very well written and directed, with meticulous attention to detail, and beautifully photographed.
742;the Extended Cut of Dances With Wolves adds more to an already perfect masterpiece.
743;director's Cut: 'It's a great movie made even greater.'
744;Others have done a wonderful job of review.
745;exciting story, awesome scenery, and nice music add up to a great movie.
746;forget what some critics say about Costner's acting and just watch this beautiful movie.
747;Cinematography and loction shots were great.
748;Equal in scope and dynamic compare to even todays digital imaging.
749;This is a outstanding classic.
750;An Academy Award winner for best picture, the scope and scale of the movie gives real meaning to the word epic.
751;This remastered, very widescreen version does full justice to the cinematography.
752;If you only seen this on TV, this is a huge improvement.
753;What I love most about Dances With Wolves is the caring and honest portrayal of the Sioux Indians.
754;Got this as a gift for my movie.
755;buff husband, and he loves it.
756;i think Mr. Costner who undoubtly is very original with the use of the camera, seems to carry by the safe road of a tearful movie, in a clear searching of touching the soul and heart of the viewer.
757;hero figure and accept it like political correct.
758;thanks God that Mr. Costner thought a lot about that point and with his new film Open Range, he inscribed this film as the best western in this new century.
759;It would be a record, considering that the Unforgiven won an Oscar by the best picture in 1992.
760;the fact that four films like Dances with wolves, Unforgiven, Forrest Gump, American beauty,have been rewarding with the Oscar in just the last decade is a point that deserves an apart mention.
761;It is an awesome movie.
762;"I really enjoyed it
I:8880;763;As good as the first time I saw it shortly after the release.
I:8880;764;I enjoyed it more, though, having recently read some comments about it.
I:8880;765;Here is a movie that will take up your entire afternoon.
I:8880;766;This, in short, is the best western ever made.
I:8880;767;There's something for everybody here.
I:8880;768;I do root for the Indians, and always have, but it's hard to say they won, given their eventual fate as explained at the end.
I:8880;769;I loved the glimpse into the social life of the Sioux: how they eat, how they sleep, how they love, how they negotiate disputes.
I:8880;770;story, and takes its sweet time to develop.
I:8880;771;For those who can appreciate all this, it's a keeper.
I:8880;772;this film is simply gorgeous.
I:8880;773;Kevin Costner and Crew did a tremendous job with authenticity and bringing the """"Wild West"""" back to the theatre."""
774;You also see the Native American view in U. s. history.
775;The cinametography, the music, and the story all mesh together so well (you're bound to like two of the three).
776;I highly recommend the theatrical version, rather than the extended (which does have great bonus features).
777;known Academy found it worthy of a few notable awards.
778;This is a great movie, well directed and acted.
779;It told a good story of a soldier becoming friends with the Sioux tribe and the life they lived.
780;I was only able to watch this movie in incriments of about 35 minutes each.
781;The first 35.40 minutes of it were good.
782;I really enjoyed learning about Lt. John J. Dunbar, and the Lakota Sioux.
783;They make Union Soldiers, American Citizens, and Whites all together look like nothing more than evil killers, and they make the Sioux look like wise, all.
784;What an awesome, awesome movie!
785;Bi fell in love with it all over again!
786;My favorite Kevin Costner movie.
787;He did a fabulous job starring and directing.
788;I feel it is truly an epic film.
789;This was a great Christmas Present to my boyfriend who thinks this is the best movie ever made!!
790;So glad I bought it!
791;What Kevin Costner did with this movie was make an honorable and honest attempt to portray the book's story of one white man found, and how he lived, with a nearby Sioux tribe.
792;The 'bringing to life' of a story based on a book is often unsuccessful but I think he did the very best he could, and put his heart, as well as his own money and extensive time, into telling this tale.
793;The relationships were real, and they touched me.
794;strong and informative extra features.
795;An excellent value for the price.
796;I have enjoyed this movie many times.
797;ray format have added to the overall experience and have fleshed out the story nicely.
798;I have to tip my hat to Costner, this was a fine film.
799;It is a celebration of the Plains Indian way of life.
800;What I like is that Costner made it a personal story.
801;He wasn't trying to be anyone, and he let the Native Americans shine in this epic revisionist Western.
802;Graham Greene was superb, as were most of the native cast.
803;I got the sense that Costner took a new spin on The Searchers, in which John Wayne played a disenchanted Confederate soldier who found himself out west.
804;But, whereas The Searchers was much more cynical, Costner's film is pure romanticism.
805;The story was real enough to draw you into the characters, which is all you can expect from a feature.
806;This is a great rendering of a fine film.
807;It deserves the blue ray edition, to preserve some of the most spectacular cinematography ever produced.
808;We enjoyed it as much as we did on the big screen, and the music is just as haunting as ever.
809;nonetheless, the movie still earns a hearty 4/5 star recommendation.
810;While I wouldn't have minded focusing a little less on Stands With A Fist and more on the more interesting Sioux characters, I recognize that this is John Dunbar's story and she represents a large part of it.
811;The acting is very good (including a career.
812;iffy Kevin Costner), the action sequences are good verging on spectacular, and it comes to a very emotional but unmanipulative conclusion.
813;This is a terrific movie all around, albeit a bit long.
814;Kevin Costner is great in the lead role, and he did a fine job directing this movie, as well.
815;Good script, great photography and very good acting all come together in this one.
816;At 3 hours it's a bit long, but well worth seeing.
817;A beautiful movie, a fascinating story.
818;Ten Bears was right, .
819;Gives you the look and feel of what life must have been like back then.
820;though I love the movie and this product looked to be in excellent condition.
821;Will you make a difference in your world?
822;a director with a deft touch might have pulled it off.
823;Still a great story, 2 decades after release.
824;A fabulous movie about how we can learn the history between the threat that the indians felt from us taking away their land.
825;Kevin Costner did a great job showing us the history.
826;One for the collection of favorites.
827;ray, then actually seeing the correct information on the back of the case.
828;And the extras ara super cool too.
829;The ultimate version of this classic film!!!
830;This is what movie magic is all about, the suspension of disbelief, and Costner is a master here.
831;The photography is breathtaking, the acting outstanding, and the musical score.
832;well, I think it speaks for itself (BRILLIANT!)
833;a truly remarkable picture, and when one considers this as Costner's directorial debut.
834;If you love epic tales that don't put you to sleep, this is the one.
835;Kevin Costner puts on an amazing performance, I actually forgot how good this movie was, check it out.
836;Part of it was film on our property in South Dakota.
837;This movie truly captures the spirit of the Tundra, the Sioux people and their interactions with the white men.
838;Pay particular attention to the details.
839;A great movie that you can watch over and over and over!
840;DWW is still a howlingly good movie.
841;Its sweeping vistas of pristine western landscapes and magnificent depiction of life among the Sioux give a reasonable portrayal of what life might have been like on the American Plains before whites took over the place.
842;dWW is a real period piece .
843;The Sioux are tough, but also intelligent, loving, resourceful and brave.
844;Even this film shows the tribe as a macho patriarchy where women are second class citizensStill, the film's characters were strong and memorable.
845;An explanatory graphic at the end lamely brings the movie to a close, interrupting the action inexplicably and leaving every story unfinished.
846;nevertheless, DWW is a classic film, beautifully conceived, shot and acted.
847;The fact that the actors who played the Sioux delivered their lines in Lakota both showed the film's respect for their culture and viewers understand the foreigness of the first encounters with them.
848;Well worth a look, even as we reach for a more nuanced and balanced look at the colonization of the Americas.
849;If you love Native American movies/history, this is a fantastic movie not to miss.
850;Dances With Wolves is a cinematic masterpiece .
851;a tour de force almost beyond the power of words to praise or describe.
852;this film gathers its power slowly but steadily, and unleashes it with an irresistible tidal wave of feeling that blurs the lines between a theatrical experience and a genuine outpouring of very real grief at the tragedy of the American West.
853;dances With Wolves clears our vision, and gives us a haunting, powerful, wrenchingly.
854;Both Kevin Costner and Dances with Wolves are American Classics, The scenery is unforgettable.
855;The story is very moving and insightful.
856;This is one of the finest westerns ever filmed.
857;It's moving, poignant and portrays Native Americans realistically, as very human.
858;I love this movie and want my grandchildren to see it!
859;It is a movie for a lifetime!
860;I forgot how good this movie was from beginning to the end.
861;I recommend this movie for everyone to watch again.
862;I recomend that everyone should see this movie at some point in their life.
863;Like all good movies, you learn something in the end.
864;I always love extended cuts of great epic movies, but this is one case where I do not.
865;One of the Best Movies you will ever see!
866;Scenery is spectacular, costuming is great and props are totally realistic.
867;especially the dead and hided buffalo's, and the music score is very good.
868;The Indian life scenes, especially the buffalo hunt are all very well done with terrific acting but on the negative side everyone always has perfect hair brushed.
869;shiny and groomed, even Kevin Costner's hair, and the Indian costuming is always spectacularly colorful but nothing is ever out of place.
870;"While I liked the movie a lot as it is very good entertainment much of the movie is way too ""beautiful""."
871;Costner and company were good.
872;It's a noble, exquisitely detailed and ultimately devastating film.
873;John Dunbar is a character that fits Kevin's rather flat and bland style perfectly.
874;He's intelligent and profound, but in a realistic manner befitting a front.
875;The Sioux are portrayed with complexity and humanity, and without the politically correct patronizing that one might expect from a modern version of history.
876;They possess qualities that are both foreign and familiar to us.
877;Like John Dunbar, we take find great pleasure and delight as we slowly learn to connect with them.
878;The noble and dignified nature of Graham Greene's character, who has a terrible inkling of what fate awaits his people, is one of the most heartbreaking performances I've ever seen.
879;the production values are also exceptional.
880;John Barry's music, the costumes, the languages, the locations.
881;all combine to give an authentic, genuine feel to a genre that is often dragged down by cliches and a Hollywoodized feel.
882;the four hour extended version of the movie expands on already well.
883;Four hours is an incredible investment for a movie, but it holds up well viewed over several sittings.
884;Dances With Wolves is truly one of our greatest American films.
885;The emotional impact still resounds, and its messages are timeless and even timely in an age where America's place in other cultures is under question.
886;If Kevin Costner never makes a good film again in his life, he will have more than earned his place as one of the greats with the love and labor he put into this fine film.
887;Deserved to win best picture in spite of some grumbling.
888;Great addtion to the Western genre.
889;Kevin Coster, with the Indian assigned name of 'Dancing with Wolves,' does a nice job narrating the plight of this tribe as he slowly gains their trust and respect.
890;"It's my favorite film of all time, not only because it is a very moving story on many levels, but because it taught me something
I:8880;891;Our teachers lied in our high.
I:8880;892;(The actor who played Spivey was perfectly cast .
I:8880;893;Maybe that's what has captured so many who DID love this movie .
I:8880;894;DANCES wakes us all up to thinking about these issues in a new and non.
I:8880;895;And I applaud Michael Blake (author of the original book), Kevin Costner, Jim Wilson, TIG Productions, and Orion Pictures for bringing this story with its refreshing point of view to us.
I:8880;896;And it's a GREAT story, beautifully filmed .
I:8880;897;I am gratified for Kevin's sake that DANCES WITH WOLVES captured the 1990 Oscars that it so richly deserved.
I:8880;898;This is a man who simply wants to tell great stories!
I:8880;899;He just knows a good story when he finds one and tries to bring it to us in the best way he can, using the considerable arsenal of movie.
I:8880;900;making talents that he has.
I:8880;901;He is a very gifted storyteller!
I:8880;902;For me, these last two are close to the bone (due to sadnesses in my own life), and I have come to love this man (Costner) for what he has brought to me.
I:8880;903;It's a very personal thing!
I:8880;904;There's something in him that tells me he's a kindred spirit.
I:8880;905;Definitely, but that's only skin deep.
I:8880;906;I wonder, What is it about the ACTOR who brings something from him/herself to the role to make that character appealing to me?
I:8880;907;Costner has strummed a deep personal chord in nearly every film he has done.
I:8880;908;I especially enjoy his sports movies, because he's naturally graceful and athletic .
I:8880;909;he has excelled at baseball, golf, horseback riding, basketball, fishing, etc., in his own life.
I:8880;910;And I'm a sports nut in the very sports he likes to play.
I:8880;911;Who can help but appreciate a person who fights for our benefit like that!
I:8880;912;SO . . . I will defend Kevin Costner, his ideas, his motivations, and the exceptional acting skills he DOES have, as well as his movie choices, to anyone who chooses to lambaste him!Kevin . . . if you're there . . . I don't know how to reach you, or even if I should try.
I:8880;913;But I hope you find this and read it!
I:8880;914;Very good movie, I enjoyed it very much.
I:8880;915;my whole family liked this movie.
I:8880;916;It's got cool commentary tracks and an extended edition that, in my mind, makes the original movie way better than the theatrical release.
I:8880;917;even went back to see it again with various family members.
I:8880;918;the theatre screen is where it should be experienced to fully appreciate the scope of the picture.
I:8880;919;ideally it should be seen in the widescreen version on as big a TV screen as possible.
I:8880;920;memorable highlights were the buffalo hunt,a truly great sequence.
I:8880;921;Composer John Barry's beautiful score(he won the Academy Award for it).
I:8880;922;Mr. greene was also very good in his recurring role in the network series Northern Exposure in the early '90's.
I:8880;923;(Costner's best performance was in Clint Eastwood's critically praised but overlooked A Perfect World from 1993).
I:8880;924;Dances With Wolves is a good film but not a great western.
I:8880;925;Little Big Man from 1970,directed by Arthur Penn(1967's classic Bonnie and Clyde ),and starring Dustin Hoffman, is one of the truly all time great epic westerns.
I:8880;926;it has the same theme as Dances With Wolves ,life with an Indian tribe in the late 1800's.
I:8880;927;if you haven't seen it and you liked Dances With Wolves you will really appreciate Little Big Man .
I:8880;928;Dances with Wolves is a 1990 epic film which tells the story of a United States cavalry officer from the Civil War who travels alone into the frontier near a Sioux tribe.
I:8880;929;Developed by director/star Kevin Costner over 5 years, the film (released 21 November 1990) has high production values[1] and won 7 Academy Awards (1990) and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture .
I:8880;930;great cast, scenery, historicalTrivia: Because Lakota contains both masculine and feminine forms of speech, the filmmakers decided to simplify the language by using the feminine form for all Lakota speech in the film.
I:8880;931;Dances With Wolves is one of those epic films that makes you glad you watched it.
I:8880;932;Not only is it a Native American friendly film, it has a grandeur of scope due to the excellent cinematography.
I:8880;933;Great story line, a depiction of the times, for the good and the bad.
I:8880;934;Wonderful treatise on human nature and the truth that the unknown is often feared irrationally.
I:8880;935;Lakota tribe's culture celebrated honorably !
I:8880;936;keven costner's oscar winning masterpiece is just what the western needed to help bring it back to life.
I:8880;937;this,now,nearly 4 hour epic of the life of lt. john dunbar and he travels out west is one of the most moving and beautiful films of the last few years.
I:8880;938;slow at times,but never dull this is one great movie and belongs in your collection even if you don't like westerns.
I:8880;939;Long but engrossing Western is staggeringly beautiful as it details the tragic outcome of our expansion westward: the virtual annihilation of a proud society and culture.
I:8880;940;An outstanding achievement for Costner, as the star/producer/director took home Oscars for Best Picture and Direction.
I:8880;941;Great story, great actors, great cinematography, great John Barry score, great film editing, great periodic custome designs and real indians in the movie.
I:8880;942;Fantastic acting gripping story a MUST see for anyone interested in the TRUE American Story of our Native people i watch it over and over
I:8880;943;this is at heart, a deeply moving tale and one that holds much prevalence when you think of how the Indian's have had their name dragged through the mud with the westerns of years gone by, portraying them more like wild packs of dogs than human beings.
I:8880;944;This film helps to re.
I:8880;945;although I'm usually disingenuous when it comes to Oscar winners, I believe this film was a fully deserved winner.
I:8880;946;Costner was outstanding, his best performance since 'No Way Out'.
I:8880;947;The production was beautiful and the storyline couldn't have been better.
I:8880;948;definition transfer is quite good, and in anamorphic widescreen you get a splendid look at the majesty of the landscape.
I:8880;949;the film holds up well and .
I:8880;950;themed films from Hollywood over the following few years, and we are the better off for it.
I:8880;951;Just some quick thoughts on this classic.
I:8880;952;Dances With Wolves (1990) won 7 Academy Awards, including Best Picture.
I:8880;953;This is an epic western with great acting, cinematography, musical score.
I:8880;954;Watch the movie to see how everything unfolds.
I:8880;955;this is one of those moving, epic movies that will stay with you long after you see it.
I:8880;956;The musical score by John Barry is outstanding and won him an Academy Award for Best Original Score.
I:8880;957;The South Dakota and Wyoming scenery throughout the movie is awesome.
I:8880;958;dances With Wolves comes highly recommended.
I:8880;959;The movie is historically rich.
I:8880;960;More appropriate for adults than children.
I:8880;961;Merchandise in very good state, prompt delivery, and very good price.
I:8880;962;This is one of those rare films that Hollywood sneers at, because it addresses a shameful page in our history.
I:8880;963;A great value and a real collector's item.
I:8880;964;Still the hottest female Indian ever in a movie.
I:8880;965;Few movies touch me in the way that this film does.
I:8880;966;It is one of the most beautiful and moving films that I have ever seen.
I:8880;967;realized how much I love this movie.
I:8880;968;To see the beauty of the brotherly love that is learned and shared among the white man and the natives in this movie is a wonderful fulfilment of the love of Christ.
I:8880;969;Good story, lots of great imagery.
I:8880;970;If you enjoy epics or westerns and somehow haven't seen this, watch it now.
I:8880;971;this is a rare """"extended version"""" of a film in that the added scenes truly add to the story and enhance the movie."""
972;among the extra scenes, one stands out.
973;"All the extra footage blends well with the original ""Dances With Wolves."""
974;This film has seamless editing, and I actually like how the time is taken to let the story unfold slowly.
975;Dances With Wolves gives you quiet moments to absorb the information and enjoy the absolutely majestic cinematography as the story develops.
976;let me also list the accolades most commonly associated with this Best Picture winner .
977;by those who agree it is a masterful epic: Authentic acting, glorious images and great, old.
978;The music is a perfect match for the film, and contributes greatly to settng the mood.
979;"then there's that buffalo hunt scene, widely considered ""Dances With Wolves"" most rousing moment."
980;"It truly is among the most impressive five minutes ever captured on film, especially as you realize these big beasts are the ""real deal."
981;Amazing!Finally, I found the featurettes on Disc 2 superior to the general Making Of.
982;"they all seem to realize, with great pride, ""Dances With Wolves"" is their crowning achievement."
983;This movie was also obviously a labor of love for all involved, and it shows.
984;I got this as a Christmas gift for my brother and he loves it!!
985;I really enjoyed this movie when I was younger, thank you!!!
986;"This version of the movie is pretty basic, just the disc
I:8880;987;I love this director's cut.
I:8880;988;Dances with Wolves is one of Costner's best movies, and while you could quibble with the idealization of the indian's way of life, there is no doubt they deserved to be treated better than the US Government did.
I:8880;989;If you have never seen this movie, see it, it's worth it!
I:8880;990;This one is so much better.
I:8880;991;What a great movie classic!
I:8880;992;native American actors to portray """"Indian"""" roles."""
993;He did a great job of directing the movie, but he came across as a total idiot in the movie ( in my opinion).
994;The extended version is even better, filling in a few gaps, and expanding on a few scenes that needed it.
995;"Overall, a very good movie
I:8880;996;The whole extra hour (!)
I:8880;997;of footage is interesting to watch, but fatally detracts from the pacing and power of a film that was already three hours long.
I:8880;998;Cinematography alone had me wanting wide screen, so bought extended.
I:8880;999;I found extended scenes needless and detracting from my original appreciation of film (I + my = my opinion only!)
I:8880;1000;oscar winning film """"mutilated"""", but to each/own."""
1001;Will keep 'extended' set for extra features, but am thrilled with this 'theatrical' blu!
1002;One of my all time classic movies to watch.
1003;Inspiration, sad, drama and good story behind the wild west and extermination of Native Americans.
1004;I have always enjoyed this movie.
1005;The characters have a mixture of humor and seriousness.
1006;Worth a look if you haven't seen this movie.
1007;I have loved this movie since having first seen it.
1008;Good movie showing the military durning the Civil War and the early introduction of the Indians of the West.
1009;I confirmed it using a Region 4 player and it played flawlessly.
1010;great movie by the way and I'm proud to have it in my collection.
1011;This film is very special, it touches on everything that is truly important to me: beautiful love and friendship not just between people but also between people and animals, loyalty and dedication, harmony and victory.
1012;The cinematography is breathtaking, the music score is mesmerizing and the cast is superb, including Cisco and Two Socks.
1013;disc extended edition is presented in a stylish keep case and the personal touch from Kevin Costner and Jim Wilson makes it even more special for every true fan of the movie.
1014;For example, the added interactions between John Dunbar and Two Socks make this unusual friendship more believable and the touching moment, when Stands With A Fist cries over her first husband's dead body gives depth to her character.
1015;Since then, every time I watch the movie, I see Two Socks in chains and I can't help it!
1016;dances With Wolves is a cinematic achievement and the Extended, Two .
1017;disc Collector's Edition is a bonus for the fans of the film!
1018;Great acting and a wonderful story of cultural bridging.
1019;I really enjoyed being able to pause the movie as needed.
1020;What a wonderful character for Kevin Costner.
1021;He is superb and so is this movie.
1022;A heart wrenching adventure about how the white man mistreated the Indians.
1023;A movie about compassion and understanding.
1024;The scenery and musical score are great.
1025;Two thumbs up all the way.
1026;Amazing what being in the wild, grounded with the animals can do to change ones perspective.
1027;Visual and beautiful sound track.
1028;Dancing with Wolves is one of the finest westerns ever made.
1029;This is probably Kevin Costner's finest performance as both an actor and director.
1030;This is a great film.
1031;com a while ago and I can play it fine.
1032;And since a lot of older films are multi.
1033;region I took a chance.
1034;I'd love to see this version in BD.
1035;While this is yet another Kevin Costner produced, directed and starred picture making him look like the best person on earth, it is still a great story with a lot of great intrigue.
1036;The acting is decent and the storyline is grandiose, which is typical for Costner movies.
1037;I think it is a fun movie and have watched it several times.
1038;Beautiful scenery and a glimpse of our country during this phenomenal time period right after the Civil War.
1039;A true homage to our Indian forefathers.
1040;Such a great movie, amazing scenery, great story, fabulous acting.
1041;I have seen this movie lots of times and always enjoy it.
1042;Kevin Costner has tried at least three times to make an epic film.
1043;He has succeeded one and one.
1044;With 'Dancing with Wolves', he succeeded hands down.
1045;The minutes pass with the grand scenery.
1046;This film belongs in every video library.
1047;I watched the movie (loved the soundtrack also), in the sense that there are some men who could embrace the lifestyle and live among them without trying to be superior over the Native American.
1048;Dances With Wolves is a excellent movie for anyone to view, whether it be for entertainment or film study.
1049;It's quirky humor would appeal to those watching for recreation, and the interesting twist of storyline from cowboys vs. indians to indians vs. cowboys is a topic for conversation and study alike.
1050;This movie is a showcase for Kevin Costner, and the gorgeous landscapes wideshots makes it a beautiful watch.
1051;i would recommend this movie to all.
1052;it is probably my favorite movie and I always enjoy it no matter how many times I've already seen it.
1053;It is nice how on Amazon, you can now watch the movies on an XBOX, our Kindle and our computer.
1054;This has always been a favorite, and our teenagers enjoyed seeing the badlands in the movie.
1055;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen and I love it much I have watched it more than a dozen times over the years.
1056;I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would.
1057;It had a few funny parts, or so I thought.
1058;I loved the story, and how this man became a friend to the Native Americans.
1059;i would absolutely recommend this movie.
1060;Story is uplifting and heartbreaking!
1061;I enjoyed this film years ago and was taken in by the drama again this time, too.
1062;It deserved every award it received in 1990.
1063;produced, directed, and starred in it.
1064;I always loved this movie but I did not know I was watching a cut version of it until I saw the uncut and I was amazed at how much was left out and it all makes more sense seeing this version of this movie.
1065;I liked to content of the movie and the period that it embraces.
1066;Great film, super story and a film the family can watch
1067;Whether Kevin Costner likes it or not, his career will be inexorably tied to this masterpiece of cinematography.
1068;Written as a novel basically just for this film's screenplay by Michael Blake, this is a journey for all ages to see.
1069;He dealt with many situations here with a believable sense of drama.
1070;I do have one tiny detail with his character.
1071;The script enabled everyone to let their roles come alive.
1072;The people interviewed were frank and fun to listen to.
1073;This is a great movie, director's cut, long version, scenes I never saw before.
1074;I would recommend this movie.
1075;No matter how many times we watch, it is still amazing.
1076;It was as good on my Kindle as the big screen maybe better because I noticed more on the screen because being smaller with a better field of view.
1077;I am a part of Native American heritage and my love for wolves is immense.
1078;This is a must see movie.
1079;Well acted and will be a classic movie.
1080;This is a great, great movie.
1081;I've watched it several times and bought it for my kindle to watch while traveling.
1082;This is a great movie but it is sad that we took the land like we did.
1083;They have a great sense of honor among them, If we only had half of that we would do much better as a society.
1084;This robust and yet tender tale of one Indian tribe's encounter with the white man is both entertaining and educational.
1085;Kevin Costner tells a very personal tale of an army man who comes to love a tribe of Dakota Indians.
1086;He sees them as people, not as the enemy.
1087;He shows them to have great dignity and compassion, while his fellow soldiers are portrayed as crude and barbaric.
1088;The music is wonderful, the scenery is beautiful, the story is heartbreaking.
1089;This is Kevin Costner's masterpiece.
1090;Costner's Dances With Wolves is a visual and auditory feast.
1091;The vast views of the prairie, mostly shot early in the morning or in the evening bring out the beauty of the landscape.
1092;Combining John Barry's extraordinary musical score with the visual, and again, this is a 5.
1093;At over 3 hours long, this movie could have been cut significantly and made it a compelling and moving story.
1094;excellent movie, just too long.
1095;This movie is more than just entertaining.
1096;It has the drama, the romance, the thrills, some comedy/ humor, and the suspense all in one package.
1097;A must see, and a classic to keep!!
1098;A lot of you don't know this, but I genuinely don't like Kevin Costner!
1099;I loved this movie, as love all epic films!
1100;(I loved BRAVEHEART, but hate Mel Gibson!)
1101;first off, DANCES WITH WOLVES is a beautiful, passionate film that swept away the audience, critics, and the Academy Awards.
1102;He is able to lead the charge against the Confederate soldiers and score a victory.
1103;The rest of the cast are regular character actors playing the Indians (yes, some of them speak perfect English) and the soldiers.
1104;"in the end, Dunbar changes his name to Dances With Wolves
I:8880;1105;It is an excellent film created by a man I cannot stand to look at or watch on the screen.
I:8880;1106;winner of 7 Academy Awards in 1990 include: Best Picture .
I:8880;1107;Jim Wilson Kevin Costner"
1108;"Kevin Costner
I:8880;1109;Michael Blake, based on his own novel"
1110;"Dean Semler
I:8880;1111;Neil Travis"
1112;If you haven't seen this movie would totally recommend seeing!!!
1113;This was the first time I viewed the entire movie, since my first viewing on the big screen when it first came out.
1114;visually, this is still stunning and doesn't get boring despite its length.
1115;While he looked the part, and did a pretty good acting job, to me he always sounds like a twelve.year.
1116;in all, the movie still merits watching.
1117;I like this movie mostly for the scenery, the wide open spaces.
1118;government bad, Indians good (may be true)The Indians turned out to be the best actors though.
1119;Dances with Wolves easily earns a position among the all.
1120;Its story and presentation are fresh, honest, real and breathtaking.
1121;Epic implies the film takes longer to tell its story than the average movie, and that it does.
1122;The character development and interaction of this movie invites us to participate, to be there and feel as our hearts share the emotions of characters even as we feel the pleasure from the eye candy provided by the amazing cinematography that takes us across the massive Northern Plaines of the United States.
1123;This movie undertakes allot and it succeeds.
1124;This exciting action, drama, western, love.
1125;story shows us a great example of a film that can be so absolutely entertaining and educational at the same time.
1126;Dances with Wolves entertains as it shows through historical example the importance and consequences of learning about our own preconceptions and learning the potential benefit we may enjoy from learning to respect and accept other beliefs or points of view, to just learning to understand all that we can before making decisions and drawing conclusions in any matter.
1127;So that is why I ordered this album again.
1128;An emotionally gripping and educational film.
1129;I used it for the first time in my American History class and the students were profoundly moved by the story.
1130;Thoroughly enjoy watching this movie!
1131;Even though it is three hours long, it is well worth watching.
1132;Gets better every time I watch it.
1133;"I can appreciate the idea that ""Dances with Wolves"" is an example of cinematic revisionist history, if not an outright case of affirmative action that instantiates the idea of the ""noble savage"" that once held sway among the European settlers of the New World."
1134;"All three deal with a white man who finds a home among a Native American tribe, but where this 1990 film differs is that it is also an epic, at which point we are talking ""How the West Was Won"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West."""
1135;"Yet ""Dances With Wolves"" is a significant step beyond all of those films."
1136;This is because the two are kindred spirits, each willing to be open to the other and committed to understanding the other on his own terms.
1137;What makes these characters so compelling is that they are utterly devoid of caricature and that the performances seem so real and provide such a sense of dignity.
1138;There are moments of warmth and humor throughout the film, both springing from this same source.
1139;This simple device allows the film to take advantage of Dunbar's narration to advance both the story and the message.
1140;What would seem stilted as a monologue works perfectly well in the context of a written journal entry.
1141;Dunbar is heroic because he is, in the best meaning of the term, human.
1142;Costner won the Oscar for best director, but clearly his strength is in telling the story and keeping the characters real rather than in coming up with pretty pictures, althought Australian cinematographer Dean Semler comes up with plenty of those, especially when he takes advantage of a brilliant sunset as a backdrop.
1143;"Dances with Wolves is epic in its scope, but it has an attention to detail that few Westerns can rival, which it why it was the first film since ""Cimarron"" in 1931 to win the Best Picture Oscar."
1144;This movie has everything from worriers to lovers.
1145;The extended version is just as interesting.
1146;the movie was very reasonable and the picture great!!
1147;thow not a new movie it was wonderful time to watch.
1148;This was a very interesting show and I wanted to see it over and over again as it kept me guessing as to what would happen next.
1149;I recommend it highly to anyone who likes a good storyline.
1150;This is a wonderful movie.
1151;For those who say that there's no record of a white man living this way with the Indians, do they have record of baseballs greatest players spending their spiritual after.
1152;This is a great MOVIE, not a documentary!
1153;If you're looking for simply a good movie, this is it.
1154;I hope Amazon will start selling the 4.
1155;This movie ranks right up there with Last of the Dogmen !
1156;"I checked for a used set and found this one for $15.95 and stated it was in ""Like New"" condition."
1157;I highly recommend this seller and would order from them again in a New York Minute.
1158;It started out kind of slow, but, wow, did it turn for a great big WOW.
1159;Dances With Wolves is my husband's favorite movie.
1160;He has watched it so many times he knows the words practically by heart.
1161;This is a fantastic movie to watch over and over and over.
1162;Kevin Costner gets a lot of grief for Dances with Wolves, and while I agree with some of it, I think he did an exceptional job of trying to get this right.
1163;He employed numerous native Americans, asked for their advice regularly, and used their native language in the film.
1164;Dancing with Wolves was one of the first movies to really show the native American side of things, to help watchers get a sense of appreciation for their culture.
1165;One is the Caucasian woman, Stands with a Fist.
1166;The other is Black Shawl, the wife of the medicine man of the tribe.
1167;Both are good characters, but I'm not sure they ever talk with each other about anything other than Dunbar.
1168;I have watched this movie many times, I'm glad I can take it with me anywhere .
1169;This is among one of my favorite movies.
1170;Good story line and well acted.
1171;Some might say long and slow but I say it builds on the main characters and is realistice and gives you a feeling of seeing the way the west looked on the prairie.
1172;I saw it at a house party, having heard how wonderful a picture it was supposed to be.
1173;The scenery was beautiful, and the mass movement of buffalo was impressive.
1174;moving, and the characters are all stereotypes.
1175;This is a beautiful story, well acted, very heart warming and inspiring.
1176;This will be one I share with friends and family always.
1177;I was impressed and glad they included them.
1178;This movie is a classic and flad I got it for my library.
1179;Good movie we watch it at least once a year.
1180;Worth a watch if you like these types of movies.
1181;Dances with Wolves is a movie epic with fabulous cinematography, historic realism, and beautiful depiction of Native American life and ways.
1182;The total viewing time is about four hours .
1183;kevin Costner is director and star of this Civil War era Frontier story.
1184;She has lived among them but remembers enough English to translate and teach so Dunbar and her Chief and Medicine Man can communicate.
1185;the movie also examines the effect White Man has on the environment and future of the Native Americans.
1186;This movie is a true classic.
1187;The acting and dialogue are so real you'd think you were there.
1188;This is one of my favorite movies of all times.
1189;it is right up there with Gone With the Wind.
1190;It show how we see other cultures, always.
1191;Many films have tried, but nothing like Dances With Wolves has succeeded in capturing the truth about the Native Americans and their culture.
1192;He created a portrait of heroism for the Sioux Indians, and showed the much feared vision of Native Americans: The Pawnee.
1193;It gives the audience a real look of the time and the people.
1194;great acting from actors and actresses.
1195;Kevin Costner is amazing and the scenery is gorgeous.
1196;I can see why he bought land and property in South Dakota after making this movie.
1197;Lt. John Dunbar is a military man who befriends natives and wild animals.
1198;Excellent visuals and character development, basis for Avatar and on blu.
1199;ray the visuals are stunning.
1200;The audio track is done exceptionally well.
1201;This is a good movie made even better through technology.
1202;We loved this film on the Big Screen and we Love having it in our collection.
1203;dances With Wolves is a very interesting movie.
1204;great Motion Picture for the whole family to enjoy.
1205;Amazing scenery and Kevin Costner, ALL the characters, Graham Greene, the best group of characters to do this movie.
1206;There were so many emotions, the story, the feel of this movie.
1207;This movie is pure fiction.
1208;The use of the Lakota authentic language by the actors is nothing short of remarkable.
1209;The attention to detail of the costumes and the settings is almost unparalleled in modern movie making.
1210;this is one of the few movies that combines cinematography, music and a great story to become one of the finest movies made in the past 30 years.
1211;the complete, editor's cut, is the way to best enjoy this movie.
1212;This is a great movie!
1213;Costner is great in this movie, as is the rest of the cast.

1222;This is a great movie!
1223;Dances With Wolves is probably one of the best movies ever made.
1224;The product itself also looks very good.
1225;This is a stunning motion picture and worthy of all the accolades and awards (7 academy awards.
1226;and it is the interaction and relationships which develop between this soldier and the Sioux, which propels this movie to greatness.
1227;It is interesting to see the difference in the relationship between Dundar and Winds.
1228;dances With Wolves works on so many levels that it's not at all surprising that the film was both an artistic and commercial success.You have a rousing adventure film with battles and a buffalo hunt that is absolutely breathtaking in its realism.
1229;The scenes are so well depicted that you almost have the sensation of riding at a breakneck pace along side the thundering herd.
1230;Just watch it and enjoy.
1231;I am a student of Native American art and native history and I see something new in this movie every time I watch it.
1232;I find this movie authentic reproduction in most ways
1233;good actors and a great story.
1234;have always liked westerns, not many like this around today.
1235;have always liked this movie
1236;If you like scenic cinematography, this one's got it.
1237;If you like heartfelt dialog, this one's got it.
1238;If you want a good movie that will entertain you and make you think about the plight of the American Indians, this one's definitely got it.
1239;There is suspense, laughter, tears and cheers .
1240;This is the really extended near.
1241;This flick is highly recommended.
1242;This is one of the best films available.
1243;If you are like me, a true fan of the TRUE WEST.You must have this beautiful movie in your Western collection.
1244;kevin Costner is magnificient in his role.
1245;The views of Wild America are truly inspiring and soul searching.
1246;If you love true Westerns.You will love this movie, and more so in blue ray.
1247;This movie is considered a classic by many people as it explores the American Indian culture through the life of a white man who has learned to appreciate and value the American Indian ways of the West and, therefore, is considered a traitor to his people.
1248;Kevin Costner is terrific in this long movie.
1249;I've loved this movie since I first saw it in the theater years ago.
1250;the story of how Kevin Costner adapts to his surroundings, finds pride in a new life with the Lakota Sioux, is powerful and touching at the same time!
1251;It is a great family movie.
1252;Has beautiful scenery that reallyComes out in Blu.
1253;ray This is a fantastic value and I highly recommend!
1254;It's a great one for your home movie library.
1255;"it has a small amount of nudity, but not offensive
I:8880;1256;This is a must watch for the ages.
I:8880;1257;Told from the 'other' side it presents a view into a portion of the culture of the USA of the late 19th Century.
I:8880;1258;Watch, listen, grow into and identify with the native Americans and perhaps, in the midst of being entertained with the day to day drama, love, and even comedy in the life of a white man among amerindians you will begin to understand some of what they lost for the rest to gain.
I:8880;1259;face liberalism, it is a look into a life of a good man and what the times did to him.
I:8880;1260;This should be required viewing for any course in American History of the period.
I:8880;1261;I watch it for the love of the story.
I:8880;1262;Like the case refers to it, this beautiful story simply told pulls you in to the lives of its characters in a way other movies that forego character development can't.
I:8880;1263;The additional footage only adds to the story, and the special features do justice to one of my favorite movies ever.
I:8880;1264;well worth the money, this edition of Dances with Wolves will quickly remind you why you loved the film.
I:8880;1265;The winner of 7 Academy Awards, Kevin Costner's panoramic frontier epic DANCES WITH WOLVES is a rich and masterful blend of scenery, story, culture, personality, and friendship.
I:8880;1266;As Dunbar grows closer to the community, he makes efforts to learn their ways: language and dress, buffalo hunts and bonfire dances.
I:8880;1267;day all appear very authentic.
I:8880;1268;Thus, it captures the time period (and location) extremely well.
I:8880;1269;The film itself makes excellent use of cinematography, with grand, sweeping shots of the plains and hills, especially during the daytime buffalo chase.
I:8880;1270;Nearly everything takes SOME time to develop, to change, to grow.
I:8880;1271;it would be inaccurate, as well as unfair, to say that such actions (or even attitudes) constituted phenomena universal to the white settlers.Yet, on the whole, Costner has done a superb job of recreating the era, the peoples (generally), their ways of life, and the ideologies that motivated their actions.
I:8880;1272;He has brought to life and memory the richness and humanity of a people all but forgotten .
I:8880;1273;and a partial portrayal of events which made, arguably, for the sadest chapter in the two.
I:8880;1274;this film ranks among the very best Westerns made.
I:8880;1275;Visually stunning and a soundtrack to match.
I:8880;1276;This tale of the frontier and the last days of native culture in the west is Kevin Costner's best film to date.
I:8880;1277;He finally rides out to make formal contact with them which eventually leads to friendship and acceptance by the tribe.
I:8880;1278;Over time, he develops close friendships with several members of the clan, particularly Kicking Bird, the village holy man, Wind In His Hair, a stoic and powerful warrior, and Stands With a Fist, a white woman raised by Kicking Bird's family.
I:8880;1279;Dumbar undertakes a journey of self.
I:8880;1280;dances With Wolves is a beautiful film with strong characters and lush landscapes.
I:8880;1281;This movie definately embraces Rousseau's idea of the """"Noble Savage"""" as the Souix are presented here as a proud and innocent people, unencumbered by vice, and threatened by an ever expanding flood of whites driven by the dreams of Manifest Destiny."""
1282;He remarked how much he enjoyed it.
1283;i was pleased with the condition of the package when it arrived at my apt.
1284;I have always loved Kevin Costner and his works.
1285;He not only won for best director but did an excellent job of portraying his character.
1286;It is filled with action and is a very inspiring love story as well.
1287;It is an amazing movie that really aims to bring a person to reevaluate their life and the meaning therein.
1288;I would recommend the movie in a heart beat
1289;Sumptuous, delicious, beautiful movie about a white soldier's journey of self.
1290;He chooses to see the frontier.
1291;He draws close enough to become one of them.
1292;the details of the prairie and of Sioux village life are breathtaking.
1293;The music by John Barry is atmospheric and inspiring.
1294;The message is what made the movie interesting.
1295;The Indians protrayed in the movie were accurate in how they conveyed their personalities and beliefs, making Dances With Wolves an epic in its time.
1296;A nearby wolf begins to take an interest in John.
1297;She remembers a little English is able to talk with him and tells him that her name is Stands With A Fist.
1298;The film won seven Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director (Kevin Costner), Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Music, Best Sound and Best Writing.
1299;I agree with many of the other reviewers.
1300;An interesting story with stunning visuals makes this a movie worth owning.
1301;While some may complain about the length of this film, I found the additional 52 minutes most enjoyable.
1302;dances With Wolves is one of my all time favorite movies.
1303;The storyline is good, the acting is great and the music and scenery is awesome.
1304;Its the historical account of Native American History and I was able to get it from Amazon at a very good price.
1305;This was a superb 3.
1306;a very nice gift for a person and i gave it to my sister.
1307;I loved the movie when I first saw it at the theater back in 1990.
1308;I loved the DTS sound.
1309;Dances With Wolves is a modern classic.
1310;The characters really draw you in as well as make you feel for their predicament.
1311;John Dunbar later known as Dances with Wolves by his Indian name becomes a heartfelt and developed character as he meets the love of his life and becomes one of the Sioux.
1312;I recommend this movie for anyone who loves history and if you have an American History of Film class in High School recommend this movie
1313;A great tale of how the indians were thought of, showing their feelings towards invaders in their homeland.
1314;I think this movie is an insight of how our native indians lived as well as a seeing there culture.
1315;Very good cast steaming to my ROKU was flawless.
1316;time favorite western, although not a shoot.
1317;A little on the preachy side but this is a very very good file nonetheless.
1318;Kevin Costner and the rest of the cast really deliver.
1319;Some of the scenery is magnificent.
1320;I have never seen that version, and am more than happy with the theatrical.
1321;It works fine on my PS3.
1322;This will definitely hold me over until a US version eventually comes out.
1323;One of the best Westerns of all time and certainly Kevin Costner's best performance.
1324;Open Range is another great one.
1325;This might be one of Kevin Costner's best movies ever and it looks great on Blu.
1326;This new edition looks and sounds wonderful!
1327;and this is truly one of those films.
1328;Great work Kevin, and thank you.
1329;I really enjoy the way the story was told.
1330;It was also a pleasure to view the beautiful scenery.
1331;The packaging looked to be excellent.
1332;The disc itself looked fine and played well.
1333;Kevin Costner is one of my favorite actors and in this movie he was great.
1334;And the location shooting was just the way it was, with beautiful countryside in the Dakota territory.
1335;My father lives in an assisted living situation and loves this movie.
1336;Thank you for getting it to him so quickly and in great shape.
1337;I had forgotten what a great movie this is.
1338;watched this movie many times, great story with beautiful scenes.
1339;Kevin Costner did a great job directing and acting in the movie.
1340;The first disk is two sided and has part 1 of the movie on side 1 and part 2 on the other side.
1341;The second disk contains the special features.
1342;I saw it in a theater and was completely taken in by the full scope of this film.
1343;Superb locations, truly realistic acting , luscious cinematography, strong story line, matching music tracks, action featuring a heart pounding buffalo hunt.
1344;All combined to bring to the screen a cinematic classic.
1345;A truly heartwarming film !
1346;Great shipping and a great product at an OK price (was a bit pricy).
1347;Loved the story of the Indian way of life.
1348;I hold a reverance for the past way of life.
1349;I originally saw it in a theater when it was first released, and liked it well enough, but the additional footage gives the film an extra dimension.
1350;Historically both movies and TV have considerably sanitized that entire era and presented it as the victors wanted it seen.
1351;"As much as many us may still love movies like ""The Searchers"" or ""High Noon"", the fact remains that mid.19th century Americans (and the colonial Europeans as well for that matter) were grossly racist by even conservative modern standards and remained ignorant of native culture for more than two centuries after the excuse of culture shock had expired."
1352;The scenery looks even better on the enhanced version.
1353;It is a classic that is a must watch for everyone!!!!
1354;This piece of politically correct rubbish is what kept Martin Scorsese from having Goodfellas honored with a Best Picture Oscar?
1355;This is a classic film.
1356;I thought there was a great mix of action and drama.
1357;The story telling is excellent.
1358;The characters are well drawn and I cared what happens to them.
1359;The way the relationship grows between the Costner and Greene characters exposes the falacies of stereotyping people.
1360;The movie is good, but I ended up with Blu.
1361;This oscar winning film is a heart felt classic.
1362;This film is presented with true brilliance.
1363;The story is truly touching as we see one man overcome the stereotypes of the time by befriending the Sioux indians.
1364;It candidly shows the angst of American settlers in the 1800's.
1365;Showing us the way the indians lived, and our own shortcomings in dealing with prejudice this film is an essential.
1366;Dances With Wolves is the epic, revisionist western directed by and starring Kevin Costner.
1367;In scope and size, this is one galliant, masterfully directed motion picture and the well.
1368;deserving recipient of 9 Academy Awards.
1369;Shadow delineation is beautifully rendered.
1370;Colors are vibrant, bold and accurate.
1371;eXTRAS: Audio commentaries that are, for the most part, interesting, an all.
1372;new production featurette, the original featurette and a host of other well.
1373;This is the best indian.
1374;documented in several books and so on, so it would be a natural thing to make an epic movie about it and show the world the day the indians beat the white man.
1375;He eventually unites with them, becomes an honorary member of the tribe, and joins them and their way of life.
1376;dances With Wolves was also directed by Kevin Costner, and he really did his homework for this one, going the extra mile to make this a realistic portrayal of the 19th century Lakota Sioux people.
1377;The actors that portray the Sioux are Native Americans who speak Lakota in the movie (with English subtitles), and the clothing, weapons, and customs are all accurately replicated.
1378;There is even a realistic and exciting buffalo hunt that is actually quite a film making accomplishment.
1379;this is a serious movie, but instead of being preachy and driven, it's compassionate and deliberate.
1380;The story and the relationships are given time to develop, making the highly unlikely circumstances a little easier to digest and the characters more familiar and interesting.
1381;the scenery in the movie is breathtaking, the music is beautifully moving, and the acting is captivating and balanced.
1382;Dances With Wolves won seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture.
1383;And I personally like Dances With Wolves so much that I can't imagine enjoying another movie as much as I've enjoyed this one over the years.
1384;Always in my top five movies
1385;Ill simply say that it was, and still is, one of my all time favorite films.
1386;Its hands down one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard and until you have heard it in all its glory on Blu_Ray.
1387;well your really missing out as this is one of those rare films where the soundtrack takes the film to a completely new level and this Blu.
1388;ray version is so superior to the previous releases that its really like hearing it again for the very first time.
1389;I just play it again and again and again and again and I have been doing this since I first started chasing over 10 years ago.
1390;The people I chase with actually make jokes over the radio.
1391;Actually breathtaking doesn't even properly describe just how stunning it is.
1392;Its like your standing right in the middle of the orchestra.
1393;ray transfer of the movie and I love the theatrical cut of the film.
1394;please understand my review as from the perspective of someone who regularly watched slow art house movies, dramas, and really all movies romantic comedies.
1395;How convenient that the evil Sioux captured an English speaking woman who is both beautiful and robust!
1396;Instead of portraying the Indians in a truthful manner, Costner singlehandedly misinterprets their culture as something bordering on vanity and he does so by extinguishing their intelligence and ability to live in harmony with nature.
1397;com this is The Directors Cut of the movie.
1398;It also has some new extras for the 20th Aniversary.
1399;This BD will present the extended cut of this Oscar.
1400;winning western starring and directed by Kevin Costner.
1401;Recently I saw this extended edition that added almost another hour to the original.
1402;There are several places that the extra actually completes the sceen.
1403;"It makes the movie flow gracefully from beginning to the end, and answeres some of those questions like
I:8880;1404;I highly recomend it to anyone who liked the original.
I:8880;1405;And a very very heartfelt Thank You to Kevin Costner for taking the chance he did, and giving us a movie that is timeless in its historical epic of that time in history.
I:8880;1406;And for giving us the extended cut to enjoy.
I:8880;1407;I love his relationship the the Indians.
I:8880;1408;i enjoyed everything about this movie.
I:8880;1409;I like watching this movie.
I:8880;1410;This is definitely a movie you would watch over and over.
I:8880;1411;This movies was so good.
I:8880;1412;Excellent acting, fantastic scenery and a good storyline.
I:8880;1413;It's a film that can be enjoyed by all, children and adults.
I:8880;1414;I am very pleased with the condition it arrived in.
I:8880;1415;This has long been a favorite movie of mine.
I:8880;1416;I love listening to the Sioux language, I love the imagery (grew up about two hours west of where this movie was shot) and I love the storyline.
I:8880;1417;released version, but there are also some scenes that will give you new insight into the characters and motivations behind the film.
I:8880;1418;Overall, I recommend this movie to someone who has already seen the previous version and loves it.
I:8880;1419;because let's face it, a four.
I:8880;1420;hour movie, good as it is, is freakin' LONG!
I:8880;1421;I have always enjoyed this movie .
I:8880;1422;well worth the price and don`t think you will regret purchasing it.
I:8880;1423;I loved this movie because of the historical content .
I:8880;1424;the story about the American Indian"
1425;oh the music so beautiful.
1426;Keven Costner did the best of his career with this movie.
1427;directional and his portrayal of his discovery of the truth about the Indian tribe he came to know.
1428;It is a classic and I never tire of watching it.
1429;The dts sound is absolutely great, especially during the buffalo hunt sequence.
1430;The movie is at times rather hokey but the story is overall great and the scenery is absolutely breathtaking.
1431;If your a fan of westerns this is a must for your collection.
1432;Now, I understand a few more things in this fabulous movie because of those scenes that were cut out.
1433;this movie is a masterpiece.
1434;a great love story, history, magnificent scenery and is so engaging, you almost wish it was longer than 4 hours!
1435;It would be fantastic if this could be re.
1436;released for the big screen once again as it is truly breathtaking to see in a theater.
1437;This is a classic movie, that came out when I was still relatively young.
1438;seeing it again, it was an enjoyable experience, but it came with some weaknesses.
1439;dream of a white man coming in to save the natives: I think Avatar did a far better, more tasteful job of it and gave the 'natives' more self respect and dignity.
1440;It was an enjoyable journey, but really.
1441;you seem pretty good at that.
1442;all you get, and this already on the double.
1443;sided disc One, is the original Making of.
1444;The sound, as correctly stated is in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Stereo and is excellent.
1445;Kevin Costner is so amazing, I love him here!
1446;His romance and relationships are so true and believable.
1447;This is an excellant movie!
1448;This truly is one of Kevin Costners best films to date.
1449;Thank you Mr. Costner for showing the beautiful culture of the Native people of this American tribe.
1450;"This was a very moving picture
I:8880;1451;I was deeply touched by the magesty of this film.
I:8880;1452;Wonderful acting by some of the top Native American actors.
I:8880;1453;Beautiful cinematography, costumes, sets, and musical score.
I:8880;1454;See it, if you havent yet.
I:8880;1455;The included documentary is also something special for those who truly love this movie.
I:8880;1456;If you watched it years ago, it's worth it to go back and watch it again.
I:8880;1457;The cinematography in this film is topnotch.
I:8880;1458;Have loved this movie since it came out.
I:8880;1459;All the Oscars won by this marvelous Kevin Costner movie were deserved.
I:8880;1460;You've got a romance, you've got an ecological lesson, you've got history, you've got the Noble Savage.
I:8880;1461;You've got terrific character development, beautiful photography, an inspiring musical score, assured direction by Costner himself.
I:8880;1462;it's simply a stunning achievement.
I:8880;1463;This is one of Kevin Costners finest Movies.
I:8880;1464;Characters are authentic, one of the most unbiased Films Ive seen.
I:8880;1465;I absolutely love this film!
I:8880;1466;This was the ultimate gift to myself.
I:8880;1467;Dances With Wolves is a good movie, a very good movie in fact.
I:8880;1468;But . . . it's longer.
I:8880;1469;This may be old, but it keeps on getting better with age.
I:8880;1470;The Blu Ray extended edition of Dances with Wolves is a superb rendition, especially with the upgraded sound.
I:8880;1471;the story line is timeless, and the extra footage adds to the emotional involvement.
I:8880;1472;one of the best movies of all time.
I:8880;1473;dimensional characterisation of native Americans as exotic curiosities (a criticism also applicable to the film's portrayal of the cavalry soldiers as uniformly savage), it nevertheless overcomes these with its compelling story.
I:8880;1474;I read the book when it first came out and loved it.
I:8880;1475;The other cast members, in my opinion, carried the movie.
I:8880;1476;The filmography and background music were outstanding.
I:8880;1477;By the late 1980s, Kevin Costner had developed a decent reputation as an actor, having appeared in several fine movies, along with more than a few duds.
I:8880;1478;Alternately joyous and terrifying, as with so many other great epics it's an ultimately heartbreaking story.
I:8880;1479;One of John Barry's most memorable scores intensifies the mood .
I:8880;1480;it's every bit as stirring as his music for Out of Africa.
I:8880;1481;I'm Belgian and I speak french.
I:8880;1482;This superb film is perfectly restored, BUT.
I:8880;1483;It really spoils the beauty of the images, Kevin Costner should not like .
I:8880;1484;*For those of you who enjoy or love this film and have been reading the glowing reviews look again, at the fine print.
I:8880;1485;A definite classic movie that belongs in most movie collections.
I:8880;1486;This movie captures a critical moment in US History and adds a significant chapter to the movie industry romantizing the American Indian culture.
I:8880;1487;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
I:8880;1488;I love the portrayal of the Sioux in this film.
I:8880;1489;I absolutely never tire of watching this.
I:8880;1490;I find something new to love about it each time.
I:8880;1491;I will definitely be watching again and again.
I:8880;1492;We had seen DWW a couple times in the theater and on TV and liked it so well we wanted it added to our home library.
I:8880;1493;It's a movie that can be watched and enjoyed as a family.
I:8880;1494;If you loved the original Dances with Wolves .
I:8880;1495;make it longer, make it longer!
I:8880;1496;incredible, magestic, intelligent, sure it has its sugar.
I:8880;1497;coated faults, but nonetheless, it is a masterpiece that should be in every living room.
I:8880;1498;up to date cause it has that universal theme of acceptance, liberty, and above all, the kinda togetherness with the world around us, trying to embrace what makes each of us unique instead of putting more boundaries with discrimination.
I:8880;1499;the movie is crisp, the added scenes adds more flow to the story.
I:8880;1500;plus the special remineacent of the main actors provides a one of a kind tribute to this movie.
I:8880;1501;still touches you with its love story, and many will have a hard time explaining why it won the oscars as best picture.
I:8880;1502;i still feel that graham green should have won as the medicine man indian!!!
I:8880;1503;It's a movie that I will watch more than once, even though I know the story line.
I:8880;1504;A nother great film work of Art.
I:8880;1505;It shows what a beautiful people they were and their harmony with nature.
I:8880;1506;We loved the short version, and although long, the extended version is all we will watch now.
I:8880;1507;I was debating an excellent vs. a very good rating for """"Dances With Wolves""""."""
1508;It is an epic film that tells the tale of the Plains Indians a few short years before the Battle of the Little Big Horn.
1509;On that basis alone, this is an excellent movie.
1510;Dances with Wolves was a big hit and justifiably so.
1511;If you haven't seen it, set aside several hours on a quiet evening to enjoy it.
1512;It's the best post civil war and Native American movie out there.
1513;"That's not the case with the Extended Cut's extensive additions
I:8880;1514;it may be long but i find it worth watching.
I:8880;1515;I got lucky and got the expanded edition for christmas.
I:8880;1516;right away i sat down and watched the best movie i have ever seen
I:8880;1517;time favorite film, and the other reviewers do an already fine job of reviewing the movie itself.
I:8880;1518;This effect is very noticable.
I:8880;1519;The DTS version sounded crisper and more detailed.
I:8880;1520;I found this Dolby Digital version somewhat muddier.
I:8880;1521;I have watched this any time it is available.
I:8880;1522;ray format makes the sound and scenes really pop.
I:8880;1523;Cosner did a great job.
I:8880;1524;I have always loved shows about Indians.
I:8880;1525;This is a wonderful story about a soldier that goes to his post and finds no one there.
I:8880;1526;This is one of my top 5 favorite movies.
I:8880;1527;ray version has lots of good extras that are also good.
I:8880;1528;I have always liked this movie.
I:8880;1529;This is a great movie.
I:8880;1530;It has amazing cinematography,great special F/X and promising plot line.
I:8880;1531;I watched it with my class and we found nothing wrong with it!
I:8880;1532;This movie is Costner's best!
I:8880;1533;But, other than that it was very good, very touching.
I:8880;1534;This film is a masterpiece.
I:8880;1535;My husband and I love watching it over and over.
I:8880;1536;it is an excellent film masterpiece.
I:8880;1537;I bought this movie for my husband for Christmas.
I:8880;1538;Amazing story, amazing setting, amazing music.
I:8880;1539;i have enjoyed watching this movie, since i first saw it at the theater.
I:8880;1540;and now, in this incredible blu.
I:8880;1541;it is such a beautiful experience, listening to the score, the incredible panoramic vistas, .
I:8880;1542;the actual lakota language, wow!just kick back with a brew and some nibble and enjoy!
I:8880;1543;Great movie, love the story and the way it unfolds.
I:8880;1544;Also love the beautiful scenery.
I:8880;1545;Kevin Costner does a great job.
I:8880;1546;the SE Edition leaves me with the message that we're all the same regardless of what color we are and where we come from, some good, some bad, but all just trying to survive.
I:8880;1547;i liked the theatrical release, but I loved the SE Edition.
I:8880;1548;This movie deserved its best movie Oscar as well as best director Oscar.
I:8880;1549;The screenplay examines the Plains Indian culture and life in detail and without judgement.
I:8880;1550;This is a movie everyone should see.
I:8880;1551;A visually stunning picture, Dances with Wolves is one of the most mind.
I:8880;1552;Costner was terrific in Silverado, but has been unrelentingly personality.
I:8880;1553;Here's another Kevin Costner message movie and this is a good one.
I:8880;1554;In telling the story of the plains Indians he does a fine job.
I:8880;1555;The story, again, is a good one and the sound.
I:8880;1556;I've always enjoyed Dances with Wolves but on Blu.
I:8880;1557;ray everything is so real just enjoyable to watch.
I:8880;1558;If you love Keven Costner movies you'll love this one as well.
I:8880;1559;Great scenery, great music, poignant story have the fading of the great frontier and the demise of the Souix nation .
I:8880;1560;Costner shines in this epic film.
I:8880;1561;Excellent story really consumes you and forces you to stay involved, even if it is a long movie.
I:8880;1562;I believe this film is destined to be a classic
I:8880;1563;This is a classic movie.
I:8880;1564;One of best movies made .
I:8880;1565;great acting by all the stars.
I:8880;1566;a very well written story and produce.
I:8880;1567;It's a fine film, and I'm glad they added some things.
I:8880;1568;My favorite character, and likely many others' as well, is Graham Green's Kicking Bird.
I:8880;1569;It's a very good place to spend a couple of hours.
I:8880;1570;He finds Native Americans that teach him the ways of their people.
I:8880;1571;I recommend this movie to fans of fields and animals.
I:8880;1572;And if you DO imagine that Kevin Costner is a Highlander and is, therefore, immortal, having this as the second movie in the trilogy makes it even more worth watching.
I:8880;1573;One of Kevin Costner's best movies and one of my favorite movies of all times.
I:8880;1574;With the possible exception of Little Big Man, this film brings to life the uniqueness of an indian culture .
I:8880;1575;with a sensitivity and intelligence that is without equal.
I:8880;1576;rate acting, and you have a masterpiece.
I:8880;1577;So starts a journey in which he joins a Sioux tribe and achieves the status of warrior.
I:8880;1578;It is a success that I have not found in any other cinematic experience .
I:8880;1579;It is a spiritual journey to find his true identity and completely believable, even with the ambiguity of the ending.
I:8880;1580;I believe it is Kostner's best work.
I:8880;1581;as he gets to know the tribe, the individual personalities emerge with wonderful clarity, but it is the portrait of the tribe as a whole, the culture, that was by far the most beautiful for me.
I:8880;1582;There is grace, love, camaraderie, the sacred, and brutality all rolled into one.
I:8880;1583;Little Big Man did the same for the Cheyenne, but there was always an element of parody and tall tale to the film that I felt was aimed at children.
I:8880;1584;This film is adult, with realistically awful violence next to the beauty.
I:8880;1585;It makes you cheer when they are killed, though there is a good captain.
I:8880;1586;My wife and I had seen this shortly after she moved with me to the US, so it was an introduction to American history for her, a European.
I:8880;1587;Now, we watched it with our kids (in our European home) and they were utterly absorbed by it and full of questions, to the point that they will want to learn more.
I:8880;1588;This is Kevin Costner's style as director, one which is especially effective in this film.
I:8880;1589;His behavior is viewed as heroism because it inspires what becomes a victory for the Union troops.
I:8880;1590;All of the performances are outstanding.
I:8880;1591;I especially enjoyed Wes Studi's work in this film as the Toughest Pawnee, (as well as in The Last of the Mohicans as Magua) and Graham Greene's performance as Kicking Bird, Stands with a Fist's surrogate father.
I:8880;1592;Some of the most effective photography recreates a buffalo hunt during which Dunbar helps his friends and neighbors to obtain the food and hides they need before the arrival of winter.
I:8880;1593;It is important to remember, however, that Costner is telling the story from a specific point.
I:8880;1594;He selected historical material which gives his film a degree of authenticity, to be sure, but whose greater purpose is to expedite as well as enrich the narrative.
I:8880;1595;Dances With Wolves is another great period piece that I can watch at least once a year, never tiring of the western frontier against mesmerizing setting and John Barry's Oscar.
I:8880;1596;the motion picture is told through the words and experiences of a civil war soldier, Lieutenant John Dunbar, and Costner makes it an intensely spiritual journey which challenges the individual in so many ways.
I:8880;1597;the film perfectly captures the finest kind of American audacity when Costner rides out alone in the Lakota plains, wearing full dress uniform and holding the large American flag to formally introduce himself to his Sioux neighbors.
I:8880;1598;with its share of bow.
I:8880;1599;arrow fights, joyous buffalo hunts, and unprecedented tender feelings for the American Indians, """"Dances With Wolves"""" remains an amazing accomplishment and a magnificent tribute for a culture lost over time."""
1600;Another in a winning series of Costner epics.
1601;A touching love story as well.
1602;I watched it many years ago and enjoyed it just as much the second time and in a few more years I may watch it again.
1603;"Just received the 20th Anv edition ""Dances with Wolves"" released Jan 11 2011."
1604;ray play back excellent as expected.
1605;A capable receiver with THX certification, 5.1 coax, optical and 5.1 multichannel input.
1606;In Dolby Surround, the sound is fuller and richer with a prominent center dialogue much clearer.
1607;my system is set up correctly.
1608;Turned out to be a great Movie!!!
1609;This movie is the rare example of amazing cinematography, excellent writing and enouch action for any red glided American movie goer!
1610;I've wanted this for along time and was just waiting for the price drop and finally have this and it looks great!
1611;even though this is nearly four hours long, make some popcorn , snuggle in and completely enjoy.
1612;"This film is the best ""Western"" film in decades."
1613;Although the storyline sounds simple, this is in fact a complex story with many dimensions.
1614;the film's greatest success is its portrayal of the Sioux as ordinary human beings in a highly complex and civilized society, albeit one very unlike our own.
1615;The Sioux are shown to be a brave, compassionate, friendly people, although possessed of a warlike tradition and culture.
1616;the cinematography of the film is superb, and it wonderfully captures the size and grandeur of the American west.
1617;The picture is crisp and the scenes are vivid.
1618;As if this were not enough, this film contains one of the best musical scores I've ever heard.
1619;Looks Like a Suicide, the main musical score of the film, is wonderful.
1620;I like the film enough so that I admit that I enjoy the length, but there is no doubt in my mind at least that this film could and should have been shorter.
1621;the way it was done caused the whole scene to seem one dimensional, and not particularly enjoyable, at least to me.
1622;Actually allows you to continue playing where you left off where other Blu.
1623;One of my all time favorite westerns.
1624;Either way is one of the best movies I ever seen.
1625;This is, in my opinion, one of the great films of all time.
1626;This 2hr plus Movie will most likely be his best work ever in the Movie making department.
1627;i really loved the 2nd Disc where the actors(Native American Indians) in the movie talk aboutmaking the movie.
1628;Well worth the price, and its a very interesting piece of work!!
1629;This movie is the best.
1630;It has some of the best scenery of the west I have ever scene.
1631;It has lots of action and also some good love scenes for the ladies.
1632;Amazon has always got the movies that I really love.
1633;Dances With Wolves is my altime favorite movie.
1634;All the actors were terrific.
1635;I felt like I was with them in their camps and on the battle fields.
1636;I enjoyed this movie so much and just love Kevin Costner.
1637;He can play in anything for me and I'd love it and he is a wonderful actor!
1638;An, incredible and truly epic film a powerhouse and moving epic.
1639;he befriends them and even goes as far as to meet an very beautiful wolf and woman along the way.
1640;none of his movies even got close to this one with incredible cinimatography and powerful sweeping music makes this movie as timeless as Ben Hur.
1641;This is a gift for my husband.
1642;It's one of his favorites.
1643;Good supporting cast too, classic!
1644;I tell you, Kevin Costner is a real hero no matter what role he plays.
1645;This is a very long story, but you'll enjoy every minute of it.
1646;I watch this movie every 3 or 4 years because it really puts the American Indian in a light not usually seen in the movies.
1647;The characters are great and the scenery is beautiful.
1648;I also like western style movies.
1649;Auh.you got to see it and the ending will just bring tears to your eyes.
1650;It was a gift for my son.
1651;They watched the video in their elaborate home theater and enjoyed it very much.
1652;The music in this movie is absolutely awesome!
1653;Kevin Costner may have made some movie duds, but he makes of for it in sensational movies.
1654;Dances with Wolves is one of my most favorite films of all time.
1655;The film has great perfomances throughout the entire film.
1656;The plot takes you into another world.
1657;The cinematography is also some of the most beautiful I have ever seen.
1658;The realism of the indian tribe and the way people lived in the 1800s is wonderful.
1659;Ever American should see this movie.
1660;It is a long movie, but for the fan of American history, it is well worth your time.
1661;If you love history, a good story, beautiful scenery, and a wonderful story with 54 minutes of extra scenes.
1662;Loved this movie I saw it when it came out.
1663;ive seen this movie in the early 90's and no wonder why Kevin Costner won the best director in this movie, great great epic movie
1664;If you haven't watch this great movie, you should!
1665;Such a moving and beautiful story, yes it is long, but so worth the time to watch.
1666;"I really love this extended version
I:8880;1667;This has been one of the best movies ever.
I:8880;1668;This movie is worth sitting still for the entire three hours, and a box of tissues, because it's just that good.
I:8880;1669;For those who loved the original, though, this is just a little extra feast to enjoy.
I:8880;1670;The storyline is so true the unwritten history of the colonization of the America's that this movie is a must see.
I:8880;1671;One of my all time favorites.
I:8880;1672;Easily Kevin Costner's best movie and great acting from the whole cast!
I:8880;1673;In my opinion, Dances with Wolves is one of the best movies ever made.
I:8880;1674;It is beautifully directed"
1675;It is one of those movies that really brings a new, fresh perspective to history.
1676;In those movies, I remember white guys were always the good guys and Indians were the savages.
1677;Even though they were depicted as savages with primitive, tribal culture, I found something beautiful about that.
1678;I always thought using arrows, and axes or just bare hands required more skill and courage.
1679;dances with Wolves is a special movie.
1680;I believe it is the first movie that gives an insight to the lives of Indians and doesn't depict them as mere savages.
1681;It shows the humanistic side of Indians, how they are family oriented, they have high values, like honor and friendship and loyalty.
1682;This movie accomplishes this, if not anything else.
1683;Other than this, Blu ray transfer is fantastic.
1684;If you love this movie, you will definitely enjoy the Blu ray picture and sound quailty.
1685;I paid $19.99 and I think it is geat bargain for such a great movie.
1686;I really enjoyed this movie.
1687;Good love story as well.
1688;Comanche names and titles are whole sentences.
1689;Maybe one of the best, well acted, well written, well directed and well characterized movies I have ever seen.
1690;Always and enjoyable storyline along with acting.
1691;This is probably my favorite movie.
1692;Beautifully filmed, wonderful story, great cast.
1693;There is a famous piece of educational research where a class of school students compare two films .
1694;Nearly all of them believed Dances with Wolves to be the more historically accurate film even though it is about as accurate as Mel Gibson's roles in Braveheart, The Patriot (well just about any of his historical roles come to think of it).
1695;Storytellers, filmmakers have always distorted history somewhat to tell a good story.
1696;Anyway, this film is pretty good but it's kind of hard to take at first .
1697;Some very touching moments made up for this though, particularly when you see how beautifully Dunbar, (the main character) relates to a wild doggy who comes to give him some company during his lonlier moments at the fort.
1698;The amazing sight to watch when the buffalo herds return after some time of being seriously diminnished to absent altogther is something which really makes one come to understand the enormity and beauty of life and how precious and wonderful it really is.
1699;remains one of my best teaching tools for my students.
1700;I give Costner a great deal of credit for insisting on using the actual Lakota language rather than having the film all in English as he was pressured to do by Hollywood.
1701;Dances with Wolves is a great filM.
1702;Kevin Costner does a fabulous job portraying a soldier.
1703;this is quite an accomplishment for a movie.
1704;This is how a movie makes the transition from entertainment into art.
1705;It tells us something about ourselves that we didn't know.
1706;the performances of the lead characters are superb.
1707;Spectacular moving piece of Art.
1708;This is a great movie!
1709;Costner does a good job as do all the people who acted in it!Well worth the money!
1710;This is a really good, really long movie, the uncut version is much better and tells a more complete store.
1711;This is by far one of the best movies I've ever watched by Kevin Costner.
1712;Awesome movie, I will recommend it!
1713;The movie is a classic.
1714;Everything about it is first class.
1715;Some things I liked about the movie:* Many of the tableaux.
1716;This particular time I watched it so I could write an analytical summary for a class I was taking, such a great portrayal of this people and their lives.
1717;I'm not a big fan of Kevin Costner, but this movie was very good.
1718;I enjoyed it and have watched it more than once.
1719;Another classic that keeps entertaining.
1720;Well worth the price and something you'll watch many times over.
1721;There is one scene of Dunbar looking through his spy glass that is especially breathtaking.
1722;The scene is shot through a long lens and at a great distance from Dunbar.
1723;Of course, this is coming from someone who considers 'Dances' to be the best movie ever made.
1724;"Sorry I know to some of you I am kicking a sacred cow but I have seen this film twice and again I ask ""really""."
1725;One of my favorite flicks.
1726;There are Dunbar's in our family tree .
1727;If they know a release is not a proper remaster or if a new and improved version comes out, why do they continue to sell older/poorer releases.
1728;the extras are plentiful and interesting and should take you several hours to get through them all.
1729;It's absolutely worth seeing once.
1730;Brings to life Native Anericans in a unique way.
1731;The picture and sound were excellent.
1732;A very good commentary from Costner and the producer.
1733;Costner didn't talk too much or though the scenes, but gave very interesting comments about the directing and acting.
1734;This one seems ripe for a special edition and I'll probably have to replace it.
1735;Dances With Wolves is a fine movie.
1736;Nobody ever said these people are not brilliant.
1737;The soldiers are dumbellionites, as are most of the whites that Kevin Costner escapes from in his effort to find the real West.
1738;Whites stripped and mined the land, but they also came up with ingenious technologies that re.
1739;It's a classic story now, love western's and frontier days.
1740;Making friends with the Native Americans is an important story dear to my heart.
1741;A wonderful movie with complete and authentic details.
1742;As others have written, this film will be ranked as one of the classics of all time.
1743;I loved every detail of it.
1744;If anything, it proves the importance of good editing in the original.
1745;"Time has proven ""Dances with Wolves"" to be a timeless masterpiece that, if anything, improves with age and strengthens in impact."
1746;That same evening I watched it and was once again transported to a world that is all at once wonderously enchanting, breath.
1747;takingly beautiful, and excruciatingly cruel.
1748;I recommend this movie to all.
1749;Great story and great film making!
1750;Even the special features where well worth watching!
1751;My husband on the other hand loves this movie.
1752;It is a pretty cool movie.
1753;This is a superb version of the original.
1754;The picture and sound are quite excellent.
1755;"GA Custer buffs and John Wayne fans have come to talk of ""revisionist"" Hollywood propaganda painting an overly saintly picture of Indians."
1756;up targets for the glorious cavalry but as what they really were: members of a colorful, close.
1757;Dunbar feels repelled and realizes that a huge cultural chasm separates him from his new friends.
1758;the huge merit of this film is that it gives a very authentic picture of indian life, actually how it used to be a few decades prior to the civil war.
1759;"The movie leaps across the division line of ""us vs. them"" and views the ""clash of cultures"" from the native side."
1760;This movie isn't very believable, but it is funny and romantic at times.
1761;Worth a watch if you have nothing else to do.
1762;"this classic work was a labor of love in the making
I:8880;1763;Historically, it paints Native Americans in a very humanistic manner, including having a healthy dose of humor, which I can attest to from many personal acquaintances.
I:8880;1764;all in all, a superior film about a superior culture.
I:8880;1765;will definitely be purchasing through amazon again.
I:8880;1766;All time classic movie a wonderful movie to watch on a cold rainy day over and over again will watch again
I:8880;1767;This movie shows the heart and soul of the Sioux people.
I:8880;1768;It has a beautiful love story and also shows what true friendship and loyalty are all about.
I:8880;1769;A masterpiece for the ages.
I:8880;1770;To really appreciate this movie, it is best to see it on as big a screen as possible!
I:8880;1771;Great story and gorgeous views!
I:8880;1772;I love the period of in which this takes place.
I:8880;1773;It is a little longer than your average movie, but definitely worth watching.
I:8880;1774;I love this movie and with all the missing scenes from the original, it puts it in better perspective.
I:8880;1775;Took a while to arrive, but it got here in perfect condition, as expected.
I:8880;1776;Filled with interesting facts, it's still a fun, entertaining movie.
I:8880;1777;This longer version of Dances with Wolves, is great, love it
I:8880;1778;One of the best movies ever.
I:8880;1779;This new blueray edition is the extended version which makes the movie even more epic, really completes the whole story and you have more depth of the movie.
I:8880;1780;The bottom line is this movie is excellent because it entertains and the extended cut scenes now addedd to the 20th anniversary blueray is a huge bonus.
I:8880;1781;This movie was a personal triumph for Costner who put up his own money to see it got out.
I:8880;1782;And lucky for us that he did.
I:8880;1783;This is a classic western.
I:8880;1784;The friendship blossums and the Lt. becomes part of the tribal family.
I:8880;1785;Moving and hunting with it and he has gained acceptance.
I:8880;1786;an outstanding movie that was a risk for Costner and it turned out to a focal point of his career that he will be remembered for.
I:8880;1787;Great scenery and many good actors.
I:8880;1788;Native americans everwhere should be proud.
I:8880;1789;He becomes friends with the local Indians and eventually becomes one of them.
I:8880;1790;She wonders into their tribe and is adopted by the Village chief.
I:8880;1791;One day the native people see him Dancing with wolves around a campfire.
I:8880;1792;granham Green gives an outstanding performance as the chief.
I:8880;1793;Graham Greenbecomes the first Native American to be nominated for an Academy Award (Best Supporting Actor).
I:8880;1794;Granham also gives a fine performance as Ishi in the movie """"Last of his tribe""""."""
1795;I have had courses in American Indian Studies and I have to confess that it is true.
1796;Native Americans have been romanticized in our popular culture.
1797;While many movies portray Native Americans are portrayed as Savages, Many Native Americans are also falsley portrayed as great evironmentalists.
1798;the story telling was very good and the cinematography was fantasic.
1799;The movie really showed the beauty of the western frontier.
1800;One needs to look at this movie not as a portrayal of white people or of Indians but, as the Journey of one man's soul.
1801;This is Art on film!
1802;A movie showing Native Americans in a non.
1803;I am so happy that we have this in our collection now.
1804;Beautiful picture, great sound and Kevin Costner in his prime.
1805;One of Costners best flicks and a true classic movie.
1806;the added footage was a dream come true.
1807;I will let the others reviewers break down the movie in a detailed manner.
1808;For the average person who wants a great movie with a wonderful picture this is for you.
1809;Great film and distributed by a great Company Amazon .
1810;nice picture on the cover.
1811;I've watched it often, always marvelling at its precision, its use of light and color, its wonderful love story, and its deep poignance.
1812;It's truly an American story, perhaps in a way it is THE American story.
1813;I have always loved this movie.
1814;I really enjoy the extra scenes which make the movie even better.
1815;ray movie and I still am blown away by the clarity and detail.
1816;This one is worth having in blu.
1817;My favorite Kevin Kostner movie.
1818;This delightful wild west tale enlightens the viewer about westward expansion in the U. s.
1819;The friendship between a union soldier and a native american tribe made it a timeless epic piece.
1820;This collector's edition is even better!
1821;This is a very good movie, that will keep you wondering what will happen next.
1822;I can tell you the shipping was good and package arrived okay but that's about it.
1823;A wonderful tribute to our Native Americans and a black eye to the rest of us for our attitude towards them at that time in American history.
1824;This is one of the all time great movies and I'm not even a Kevin Costner fan.
1825;The photography and music really transport you.
1826;I've always liked this movie.
1827;Saw it on prime and decided to watch it again.
1828;I like the idea of one man becoming more than himself and learning the truth about the frontier.
1829;This film is one of my favorites (I saw it at the theater 3 times) so I figured the four hour version must be better, right?
1830;The added scenes actually take away from the experience rather than add to it.
1831;This version just takes the wonder out of the story.
1832;The history of this movie is without a doubt flawed BUT the story is engaging and there is a good amount of morality
1833;I saw Dances With Wolves at the theatre in 1990 and have always counted it as one of my favorite films.
1834;The special edition is every bit as beautiful and stirring as the original release.
1835;view longer films over 2.3 nights, take your time and enjoy an epic such as Dances.
1836;i highly recommend this version.
1837;In a span of only a few years, he gave us The Untouchables, Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, and of course, his masterpiece, Dances With Wolves.
1838;A beautiful, moving movie about the closing of the American frontier and all that disappeared with it.
1839;This movie transports you to another world, and that's the mark of a great movie.
1840;This movie by Kevin Costner is in my opinon one of the best he has made.
1841;it is still a great movie , would recomend it to everyone.
1842;it is a beautifull adventure ,thank you again.
1843;Dances With Wolves is touching and well made, but at times it seems as if it's trying just a little too hard to exist.
1844;It has makings of a classic: full of drama and passion, understanding and communication, and violence and power, but perhaps they are emphasized a little too much.
1845;kevin Costner directed, produced, and stars in this epic tale about John Dunbar, a Union lieutenant during the Civil War, who heads west to mark a post for pioneers and soldiers.
1846;Dunbar makes his first real gesture for peace when he encounters an injured Indian woman and gives her medical attention.
1847;Eventually, the two sides work together and communicate.
1848;The characters show their emotions through their actions, they work together, hunt together and at least try to communicate with one another.
1849;This originality and sense of character is what makes the film so great and touching.
1850;At first we feared the Sioux, now they are our friends and our family.
1851;It's exciting to watch, but it does seem a bit much.
1852;despite a few flaws, Dances With Wolves is excellent for what it is.
1853;But it does have a vivid theme about maturity, tolerance, and war and peace.
1854;Along the way he meets some interesting characters, but its after he sets up his post that the story begins.
1855;Lt. Dunbar comes to respect Wind in His Hair (Rodney A. Grant) who teaches him about friendship.
1856;if you want to see how the west really was then you must see this movie.
1857;The cinematography is excellent and enables Kostner to capture the realism of the time.
1858;I can see why Dances with Wolves won 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture.
1859;This is the movie that I watch at least once every year!
1860;Great scenery and a super story.
1861;I remember going to see this movie at least five times in the theater when it first came out.
1862;The sheer majesty of this film is incredible and it's one that helped brought back the epic motion picture.
1863;the behind the scenes documentary the typically formatted but very good.
1864;the feature I did enjoy most was the Costner/Wilson commentary.
1865;Very informative and worth listening to.
1866;if you are a fan of Dances with Wolves, epics or westerns, this is definitley worth having.
1867;Already considered a modern classic.
1868;well acted, great story line, wonderful cinama makes for a believable tale of the wild west.
1869;Dances With Wolves is not only the highest grossing western of all time, but is considered by many to be one of the greatest films of all time.
1870;The scenery is sometimes breathtaking and at least for me, makes me long for a more simple landscape than the one I see when I drive to work everyday.
1871;in the wonder of God's creation.
1872;add to the mix a sweeping and inspirational score by John Barry (his magnum opus IMHO) and you have one solid, beautiful film.
1873;Great storyline, script, cinematography is great and the cast delivers a top performance!
1874;To me this is one of the greatest Westerns every made, one that I can watch many times and be absorbed each time.
1875;Dances with Wolves is a movie of tremendous philosophical insight, in that philosophy is the love of wisdom and wisdom the knowldge of the truly good life.
1876;It is an interesting blend of Aristotle's ethics and existentialism.
1877;Abandoned and dilapidated the post provides an outlet for him.
1878;The task of rebuilding the post reflects his inner restoration.
1879;Hostility gives way to hospitality.
1880;Among his new friends he discovers entirely new approaches to life.
1881;Among them, he finds in himself his own understandings of duty, community, relationships, morality, and love.
1882;Upon that death Dances with Wolves is born, as one unnaturally, into the Lakota Sioux tribe.
1883;discovery allows him to live as an authentic human being, allows him to be himself.
1884;He is the one who comes to trust and to be trusted by beautiful fellow creatures, misjudged and wrongly vilified.
1885;Ultimately, he comes to dance with them, sharing with them the richness of life, both sorrows and joys.
1886;The end is even more beautiful.
1887;It is the story of his discovery of the path to fulfillment, found in true community and marriage.
1888;He must preserve them for others, for those he loves and for those unknown.
1889;It is a journey which does not end, but is constantly rediscovered as we adventure in the unknown frontiers.
1890;It can only be traveled in honesty and humility.
1891;This movie was exciting and kept my interest.
1892;Great movie, but so sad at the end.
1893;What an amazing production and story line.
1894;Although this film can be classified as a western, it essentially is a moving story of a peoples' history.
1895;Many nations of Native Americans once roamed across the vast prairies of the Old West.
1896;over the course of this picture, we are left with the impression that Dunbar is, nor was, ever truly happy with whom he was.
1897;The scenary is intense, and the message is even more intense.
1898;Lt. Dunbar transforms himself into a man whom loves and learns as Dances With Wolves, while the Sioux prepare for the coming of the white men whom will destroy a thousand years of their heritage.
1899;this movie takes a concise approach at defining what the future meant to the Native Americans, without ever compromising our attention to this daunting epic.
1900;This is perhaps one of my favorite movies of all time.
1901;It captures such an harrowing time.
1902;i thoroughly enjoyed it and if you're a movie buff, you will too.
1903;This movie was one of the best movies I have ever viewed.
1904;Epic, watch it every chance I get.
1905;Cast is outstanding and the Great Plains are magnificent.
1906;would have loved to see it in its pristine form.
1907;thank you for taking the time to read this review and have a white day.
1908;there's a romantic vision of this period in american history that many white people wish they fit neatly into: friends to the native americans, and free of religious and small minded bigotry.
1909;It is famous and I just review it again.
1910;This movie left me with a deep feeling of compassion for Indians and those in other cultures.
1911;Absolutely loved it, and would recommend it to anyone!
1912;This is a very fine, excellently directed film.
1913;Well I enjoy most all of the films he has directed.
1914;And he has given me hours of entertainment.
1915;The story is well told and has many amazing scenes.
1916;It is long, but most good films are long.
1917;I bought it on Amazon, widescreen of course.
1918;a story that magnetizes the viewer.
1919;I loved it when it came out, and I still love it now.
1920;Kevin Costner's crowning achievement in the film industry.
1921;A must watch movie for everyone.
1922;The American Indian is beautifully depicted along with the Montana grasslands.
1923;"Dances With Wolves delivered them masterfully
I:8880;1924;It does, but as the character is a good.
I:8880;1925;hour extended cut, which I and most viewers find superior to the 3.
I:8880;1926;The extended cut has an important sequence .
I:8880;1927;Dunbar's seeing the Lakota's celebration of the killing of white people.
I:8880;1928;(This is a secondary theme .
I:8880;1929;it's better to live a simple life in which personal relationships dominate, rather than one that's technology.
I:8880;1930;ray is superior to a projected print.)
I:8880;1931;John Barry's excellent score .
I:8880;1932;gets a solid 7.1 transfer.
I:8880;1933;20 years ago, the wolf coming to Dunbar's camp seemed a bit too Disney.
I:8880;1934;the supplemental material is excellent, but slightly less lavish than some other films'.
I:8880;1935;That's good, but the character is 100% that way from the beginning.
I:8880;1936;I liked this movie and of course Kevin Costner.
I:8880;1937;Nice movie, not the best I've seen but well worth the viewing.
I:8880;1938;A classic western, with Costner at his best.
I:8880;1939;The entire film gives you a John Ford feel for the west at the end of the Civil War.
I:8880;1940;so what makes this movie so interesting?
I:8880;1941;The 3 hours is a daunting challenge, but trust me, it's well worth it.
I:8880;1942;Something is always happening and all the characters have agency.
I:8880;1943;The film very gently tugs on your heart strings and let's you grow to enjoy the characters.
I:8880;1944;You develop an appreciate for the Sioux culture which is all about family, survival, and taking pleasure in the simple things in life.You star to understand how Dunbar feels, because he is played in such a neutral fashion, that you can easily see yourself as a visitor to the Sioux village.
I:8880;1945;Well, turns out you love the native Americans much more than the U. s. Army.
I:8880;1946;dances with Wolves will get you in touch with your inner humanity and make you appreciate a time where your life hasn't been consumed by electronic devices.
I:8880;1947;this was a wonderful film and I highly recommend anyone who hasn't watched it to see it.
I:8880;1948;For a film to affect me this deeply, it must surely be near perfect because I normally take movies at face value as just entertainment.
I:8880;1949;This one shows all sides of human emotions.
I:8880;1950;love, hate, pain, cruelty all wrapped in one superb package.
I:8880;1951;You may see it only once, but see it.
I:8880;1952;It's a classic!Such a engrossing story that leaves you wanting more.
I:8880;1953;If you consider yourself a movie buff you should see this movie.
I:8880;1954;He ultimately adopts a Sioux name .
I:8880;1955;wow, I forgot how great """"Dances With Wolves"""" is!"""
1956;This is, simply put, filmmaking of the highest order.
1957;Everything magically works in this absolutely engaging 3.
1958;"Also, when he says goodbye to Dunbar at the fort he says, ""Good luck, Lieutenant"" and you know he means it
I:8880;1959;It's more complicated than that.
I:8880;1960;Regardless, it presented in a believable, compelling and captivating way.
I:8880;1961;Dances is almost 20 years old but remains timeless like most great films"
1962;I loved the whole plot.
1963;If you like westerns, this is the movie for you!
1964;I saw this movie when it first came out and liked it.
1965;I took the opportunity to watch it again this year (so many years later) and still love it.
1966;Everyone does such a great job in this film.
1967;Add history and a beautiful endangered species into the mix and you have a winner.
1968;If you haven't see this movie do yourself a favor and watch it.
1969;I've just always thought that this movie had a great plot and good action.
1970;Kevin Costner always does great acting!
1971;If you like Native American type movies, then you'll love this one.
1972;This is a classic and one of my favorites!

1974;The price on Amazon is awesome and I received it quickly as always.
1975;plus epics, both contain action are about a white American soldier and the Indian.
1976;one for movie and transfer picture very good.
1977;This is one of those movies that everyone should see at least once in their life time.
1978;It is a long movie, but worth it.
1979;The photography of South Dakota is beautiful and we get to know the Sioux as intelligent individuals instead of savages.
1980;The film received 17 Academy Award nominations and was awarded 7 including Best Picture of 1990.
1981;Dances With Wolves is definitely the best western ever made and the extended version is the one to get.
