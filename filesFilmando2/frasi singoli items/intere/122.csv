1;this film is the best film i've seen since i don't even know when.
2;it's an amazing piece of film making!!
3;'Donnie Darko' is purposely ambivalent, and the causality of bizarre events is intriguing from the very start.
4;The journal development is a retro trip in itself.
5;How they manage to mix nostalgia with an eerie tale and dark manifestations is a mystery, but they pull it off.
6;"A grateful Donnie will do anything for ""Frank,"" who saved him from the debacle."
7;From there a series of inexplicable events take place that leave one glued to the screen with magnetic interest.
8;Some of the draw comes with the acting.
9;The scenes of hypnosis are mesmerizing with Dr. Therman (played with expert delicacy by Katherine Ross) who tries to uncover Donnie's pathology.
10;Dabbling with penetrating thoughts about predestination and the occult, Donnie's predicament is fascinating.
11;Drew Barrymore, whose mere presence could singularly bring flashbacks of the eighties, is the producer and plays lively English teacher, Karen Pomeroy, a character who provides a pivotal place for social commentary.
12;With effective performances that include the delicious novelty of having Donnie's sister played by real.
13;life sister Maggie Gyllenhaal, the elements speak for themselves.
14;I love the whole movie as it is witty and funny as well as deep and meaningful.
15;What I find the best in this movie is the ending.
16;One of the smartest endings I've ever seen.
17;The whole movie is excellent and suggest that everyone gives it a go.
18;It takes a few viewings to get the whole thing but well worth it.
19;all of this propoganda is coated with a science.
20;oh yes,this movie is so very original!Make good people look eviland evil people look good.
21;"wonder if you can ever create something new with YOUR closed mind?And as far as this ""extrodinary"" storyline goes,let me just see if I get this straight."
22;This move is great on so many levels.
23;If your into romance, it has it, if you like comedy, it's in there too, if your a fan of cult films, it is ONE!
24;This is so complex it it's simplicity, or is it the other way around?
25;This is a vital film, especially for anyone who thinks they know the nature of despair.
26;Life is beautiful and if you don't think so, then go do something to make the necessary changes .
27;got this as a gift for someone whos a big fan of the movie and they liked it
28;Donnie Darko is one of may favorite movies so I was very excited to watch The Director's Cut version and anxious to hear what writer/director Richard Kelly had to say about his amazing movie.
29;hard fan of the film.
30;the theatrical release of Donnie Darko was a rare cinematic gem.
31;All at once it was a film about love, sacrifice, God, time travel, insanity and the supernatural (at least to me it was.
32;There's a lot to see in this movie, and a second viewing is helpful or by going to internet descussion sites.
33;I highly recommend this movie!
34;I recommend watching it with a friend because you will need to pause a few times during the movie and discuss what the hell is going on.
35;Donnie Darko is possibly the greatest character based sci.
36;You will watch, and undoubtably love the movie.
37;But for the already hard core fans, just beware.
38;This remarkable little film lives up to all of its ubiquitous hype!
39;The biggest surprise of all?
40;"It'll still be an amazing film to watch, no question about that
41;anyways, the story starts out showing Donnie Darko (Who is played by the wonderful actor Jake Gyllenhaal), laying on top of a hill (Which is called 'Carpathian Ridge').
42;He believes and does everything Frank tells him to do.
43;I love this movie and you should too!
44;I hope this helps everyone.
45;classic film about or catering to Generation Y and Z. the generation who like to think, who speak fast and care more about others then themselves.
46;I for one love movies closer to the as """"concieved"""" or as filmed versions as possible."""
47;I love Directors cuts and extended version almost always over the theatrical cut.
48;This cut to me is more of a masterpiece more music (the songs meant to be there)more weirdness and, I love it!!
49;the film moves effortlessly from horror to science fiction to psychological drama, and does so successfully.
50;In some ways I would agree that this movie is, for the most part, a mind trip, but I think it would be more accurate to describe it as a film that has the potential to be a 'mind trip'.
51;as far as the acting goes, Jake Gyllenhall is tremendous.
52;Most of the rest of the cast is okay, but I found myself not caring that the supporting cast wasn't outstanding because Gyllenhall was so good.
53;I have had many smart friends debate on what actually happened in this movie.
54;If you want a psychological type movie this is the best one I've ever seen.
55;He has been seeing a psychologist due to his emotional instability.
56;His family life is so.
57;But I can tell you that you will be thinking about Donnie Darko for days after you see it.
58;It's a great movie, and requires puzzle.
59;Donnie Darko is a must see.
60;Homer and friends appear at the grand re.
61;teen girls in silver leotards perform an interprative dance to Notorious?
62;They only provide a laugh of recognition, a self satisfied feeling that you are cool enough to know the non.
63;It feels like the filmmakers just threw on screen some commonly accepted cinematic signifiers of profundity, social commentary, romance, or what have you, and called it a day.
64;There is a distinct coldness and distance between the audience and the characters in this movie, which wouldn't be a problem if the movie then didn't expect you to care about the budding of young love and the self sacrifice it compels young lovers towards.
65;Countless people have told me that this film has literally moved them to tears.
66;One of the best dark films ever made.
67;One of those great films that every time you watch it, you pick up something you missed before.
68;Great movie, you have to watch it to understand what makes it so great.
69;Deep intellectual thought and art went in to the making of this movie.
70;This has been one of my top ten favorites since the first time I saw it.
71;My husband and I are especially inclined to do that with comedies full of great one.
72;liners that make us laugh by simply quoting something (Christpher Guest movies are a good example).
73;Now I'm compelled to watch the original again so I can compare the two.
74;for those who haven't seen the film: the acting is superb, the story is very compelling, and it's probably not at all what you were expecting to see.
75;Donnie Darko is one of those films you will either love or hate.
76;Jake Gyllenhaal tends to overact sometimes but overall, his performance as the title character is quite engaging.
77;His sister Maggie Gyllenhaal also stars, she is such a powerful and intense actress.
78;Even Patrick Swayze is a marvel, probably his finest performance of his short, amazing career.
79;The premise is really outrageous but Donnie Darko will leave you scratching your head and that's a good thing!
80;I took a risk when I bought this movie but, in the end, I found out it was a great choice.
81;I had only seen about the last 15 minutes of it, but decided the rest would be as great as the end.
82;It's one of those rare movies you can watch over and over again and find new things in it.
83;A really well written and creative script teams with a great cast with wonderful performances.
84;For me, it's a great movie.
85;But it's up to you, watch it and make your own conclussions.
86;fi fans, black comedy fans, anybody who likes to have their mind blown, should see this movie.
87;The acting is great, my favorite character being Frank, who looks like the bunny rabbit from hell and has a voice unmatched in creepiness.
88;Like many before me have said, this is a very underrated movie, a real treasure that slipped under the radar.
89;If you like good movies, you should be sure to see this one.
90;For those of you that have seen the original version of this film, the director's cut fills in some unanswered questions and nearly takes this film into a whole new genre.
91;One of the discussions that we had was if the director's cut perhaps moved this perfect film from the world of fantasy into the world of science fiction.
92;That is what impresses me about Richard Kelley's unbelievable film, it opens your mind to several new ideas and possibilities.
93;Also, Kelley adds the images of the human eye to several of the scenes to create a stronger connection between the tangent universe and reality.
94;This director's cut seemed more like a dream than the original, and I thoroughly welcomed this change.
95;there are a handful of other scenes that Kelley adds that helps enhance the world around Donnie.
96;There also seems to be more referencing to religion in this edition.
97;There is a wonderful discussing in this film between Donnie and his therapist concerning the difference between an atheist and an agnostic.
98;thankfully with these extra scenes and better sound we can witness Donnie Darko in it's purest form.
99;There are some cases when a director's cut will dramatically change the structure and sensation of the film.
100;It will be up to you to see if this is true or not.
101;It is a cultural phenomenon and a thought provoking film that will leave impressions on your mind for years to come.
102;It honestly is one of the greatest ever to escape the grasp of Hollywood.You will never experience a film like this again in our lifetime.
103;To me, great movies mirror great books, in that, they require numerous visits, and analysis.
104;The acting is superb, the storyline is enthralling, and it gives my brain some exercise, and in a world where a button does everything for us.
105;Donnie Darko is indeed one amazing film.
106;It's unclassifiable as a genre but it still manages to confuse you, make you laugh and think.
107;The film's audio and image are top.
108;The commentary by Richard Kelly and Kevin Smith (Clerks, Chasing Amy, Dogma etc.) is informative and entertaining .
109;after seeing it a few times now, I see something new every time, it's one of those movies that you enjoy seeing each time just because it strikes a certain chord within you.
110;the main thing about this film that sticks out in my mind is how beautiful it is.
111;even when dealing with subjects like hallucination and time travel, there is always a strong feeling of humanity emanating from every scene.
112;i think this is mostly due to the fine acting.
113;it was a touch of genius to have this film set in the 80s.
114;it adds a rich and unmistakable atmosphere to it, although it could be set in almost any time period, because the story is somewhat timeless.
115;It has perfect story(a very hard one), perfect actors, perfect director, cool special effects and a suspence.
116;This is my N.1 movie.
117;I think that JAKE GYLLENHAAL is the best new actor.
118;I Rate this one A+.
119;This is one of the weirdest movies that I have seen in a long time, but was most entertaining.
120;one of the best/craziest endings i have come acrossthis movie is great.
121;The acting is great, the characters are fantastic.
122;The soundtrack is really good too.
123;I highly recommend this movie.
124;This is one of those films that knocks you off your feet.
125;Excellent acting, a great story, good character development, and some twists you just don't see will keep you in your seat.
126;I won't give anything away, but the movie is worth the money, and is worth adding to a collection.
127;This is the good stuff that gets made occasionaly.
128;I just love when you expect nothing and get it all!
129;Donnie Darko is the kind of movie that you can realize something new every time you see it.
130;It truly is a BRILLIANT piece of cinema.
131;i'll end this review with a little piece of advice to anyone about to see this work of art: Pay attention.
132;a slightly confusing, but overall very entertaining and fascinating film.
133;the cast is pretty good, although drew barrymore is absolutely appalling and not quite believable as a high school teacher.
134;amusing conversations, interesting plot and overall weirdness make this an almost.
135;This movie is brilliantly suspenseful.
136;This is definitely the type of movie that you could watch over and over, and still want to see it again!
137;It actually is pretty hard to classify this movie as one thing or another.
138;Don't be fooled by the movie cover, it's actually a lot better than you'd be led to believe.
139;but personally I really love this movie, and in my books its up there with the likes of fight club.
140;"One of the defining attributes that makes this, what i consider to be, a ""good"" movie, is that the viewer isn't force."
141;It does however do a good job at poking fun at the 80s and some school.
142;"presidential candidate worthy of my vote, it has to be Dan Quayle"", and the love/fear exercise."
143;i have yet to see the director's cut and perhaps i would view that as a 5/5.
144;This movie is very well done, with well.
145;composed music and an enjoyable story.
146;First of all, Jake Gyllenhaal is an outstanding actor, and I believe this was the first film I ever saw him in.
147;This scene sets the stage for what is, I think, one of the strangest movies ever .
148;the film also stars Jake's real.
149;Drew Barrymore plays one of his teachers, and Jena Malone is good as Donnie's love interest.
150;And while all of their performances are good, none of them are as good as Jake Gyllenhaal, who gives a haunting, mesmerizing performance that will stick in your mind.
151;I can't guarantee you won't be disappointed, but I can guarantee the film will stay with you for a while.
152;This movie is a debut from Richard Kelly and he has made a great film.
153;it's a mix science fiction, philosophy, social commentary.
154;This film is really under.
155;I've watched it 4 times already and lent it out to several friends who also bought it.
156;I understand that this has become a cult favorite especially in England and am not surprised.
157;It's an interestingly presented story that appears to be just another teenage angst piece at first glance but the further you get into the movie, the more you realize that there is a whole lot more going on.
158;I strongly recommend this for anyone who enjoys movies that are not only out of the mainstream but cut a whole new river of their own.
159;He often finds himself waking up in places he didn't fall asleep and his family is so accustomed to it that it's practically humorous.
160;In therapy and on anti.
161;A psychological thriller to say the least with some sci.
162;The official web site makes great use of flash but you'd have to watch the movie to understand it.
163;The best time of my public school life.
164;What makes a great film is how often u re.
165;I just recently watched this movie for the first time in my life and loved it.
166;If you are a fan of creepy mind benders you will love it.
167;all of this propoganda is coated with a science.
168;First of all, study your punctuation.
169;Secondly, please know what you're talking about before you open your mouth.
170;The third one is an extended version of the first sequence between Donnie and Frank.
171;Not much of a commercial success in the US, the film did very well overseas, and this is spotlighted in the documentary portion of the second disk, which interviews fans in the UK in 2004.
172;The actual film is fleshed out by an extra 20 minutes of footage, mostly explanatory passages that clear some of the ambiguity surrounding Roberta Sparrow and her book.
173;This, coupled with the many genre.
174;crossing elements of the file, are what make it a modern classic.
175;"There are scenes which look like an update of The Breakfast Club, complete with 80's pop music (including a new track by INXS)
176;At the time of the theatrical release, the website was a marvel, giving tantalizing clues to the origins of the story and the thoughts behind the characters.
177;The bonus materials touch on this only a little.
178;Perhaps the most interesting feature on the second disk is a """"Darkumentary"""" film by a young man who explains why he is the film's #1 fan."""
179;the movie itself is a brilliant piece of work, and I think that the extra scenes are positive more than negative.
180;The extras are mostly enjoyable, although I hope that the filmmaker who cornered Mr Kelly at the San Diego Comicon is taking his medication.
181;My 17 year old daughter loves this movie and bought the recently released directors cut.
182;I'd only seen part of the original version, so this cut was my first full viewing.
183;i can see how this film has acquired cult status, my daughter loves it and thinks it's much better than The Butterfly Effect, however, I didn't agree, I thought this flick was a bit disjointed.
184;i would definately recommend watching this film if you're into this kind of film, it's certainly entertaining.
185;Every once in a while, I have to go back and down.
186;grade a bunch of films I reviewed, because a great film comes along and shows me what is really possible given a talented cast and great script in the hands of a good director.
187;This is such a film.
188;"style ""gun battle"" that the marketing for this film seemed to promise, I found I was in the middle of a supernatural thriller."
189;"What I got was worthy of M. Night Shyamalan (""The Sixth Sense"")."
190;This remarkable achievement came not through trickery (hiding the Bad Thing) or cheats (making the Bad Thing invincible), but through not letting the the plot swallow the characters.
191;it is classic in scope and scale) the characters act accordingly and the emotional payoff just rocks.
192;See it, see it see it.
193;Its great for us teens who dont know what to think about life.
194;Its hypnotic in so many ways.
195;It has a great cast, great script(i think),and a great soundtrack!!!
196;It has alot of potential into being a great cult classic.
197;I know that a lot of people go around slapping five star ratings to every other movie, but I have to say that Donnie Darko is truly a brilliant film.
198;It's dark, clever, and more than anything, intriguing.
199;After a couple viewings of this film, thoughts of the main character(s) linger in your mind in a way that may actually make you want to cry.
200;The special features are a must and bring a lot more to the experience.
201;The Good Things*Very interesting filming style.
202;Lots of vivid, memorable imagery.
203;Good special effects that don't overwhelm the film.
204;There are also many thought.
205;provoking elements regarding theology, the nature of humanity, the nature of youth, and the nature of space and time.
206;"*Characters are good
207;Aside from being strange, it's also quite complex.
208;disc special edition includes a fifty.
209;If you enjoy movies that are a bit on the dark side and completely unclassifiable, Donnie Darko is the one for you.
210;Well done, thought provoking, funny, creepy, and disturbing all in one package.
211;in my honest opinion, a very well done original movie.
212;But even if you don't get the deep down meaning behind it all, its still very well acted and a mindpuzzle.
213;Jake does a marvolous job and he deserves kudos.
214;The entire movie flows so well.
215;All the way down to the magnificent ending.
216;A very strong directorial debut, `Donnie Darko' is a very modern twist on those tapestry films so many wannabe auteurs seem to be spilling out these days.
217;What is so great about `Donnie Darko' is that it remains oddly focused throughout the compelling insanity thrust onto every frame.
218;The core of `Donnie Darko' isn't as clear as some may want it to be, but that is half the fun.
219;Melding genres together to create something wholly original"
220;Jake Gyllenhaal is phenomenal as the emotionally reserved young man who talks to giant rabbits and becomes obsessed with time travel.
221;As the world continues to evolve around him, Donnie finds himself increasingly fixated on a world inside that world, one that moves him and propels him to conclusions that will warp your mind.
222;`Donnie Darko' is a smart and provocative thriller that haunts more than it outright scares.
223;This is a film that you need to explore.
224;I know that I'll have to watch it a couple more times to pick up on all the little things and connections.
225;He was good, and it made me sad seeing him again.
226;Still, I'm glad he's got another good film credit.
227;I love time travel in movies and the way it messes with my mind.
228;Oh, and favorite line so far .
229;This movie has some excellent weirdos.
230;maggie Gyllenhaal played Jake Gyllenhaal's sister, and that was neat to see the real.
231;life sibling actors acting together.
232;I patiently await the day he's up for an Oscar.
233;next time I watch this, I'm sure I'll have more comments.
234;This is a mind tripping, intense, creepy, and clever time travel movie.
235;What I love about this movie is that it also depicts schizophrenia and its terrifying decent into madness and despair.
236;If you take away the concrete notions of time travel, it could easily be an excellent portrayal of the emotional and psychological turmoil of mental illness.
237;Donnie also shot Frank for killing the girl he loved, Its a most see movie.
238;My daughter loves Donnie Darko and was thrilled to finally get the director's cut *she has the theatrical cut already* it's a classic and this cut just gives you more reasons to love the film!
239;A cult movie, has a lot of definitions.
240;BUT the acting is great, the wierdness is.
241;expected, and the plot is so incredibly original that anyone who appreciates new ideas and is not put.
242;The movie is well acted and the story is intriguing.
243;Jake Gyllenhaal gives the best performance I have seen from a young actor in a very long time.
244;He utilizes his posture, voice and eyes to convince you that he is Donnie Darko.
245;"she simply responds ""It feels wonderful."""
246;Donnie's older sister is portrayed by Jake's real.
247;life older sister, adding to the plot.
248;This is Richard Kelly's directorial debut, and he has made his mark.
249;every character in the film serves a secondary purpose.
250;watch it, and then find a creepy rabbit to help explain it to you.
251;It's pretty good for the most part.
252;provoking and a psychological thriller that opens your mind to other.
253;This is one of the strangest and most undescribable movies I have ever seen.
254;All the characters in this story are tragic and complex.
255;The performances are all top notch.
256;The story is very lush and you are easily lost and caught up in it.
257;The music well bound to the scenes that are shown.
258;I highly recommend that you see this movie.
259;Its definitely a thinker and you'll be compelled to rewatch the movie right after you finish watching it for the first time.
260;An easy version of the movie well worth watching.
261;The directors cut is the one to get and enjoy.
262;The music is wonderful as well.
263;Movie insights to read the book.
264;All of the actors are fantastic in their roles (although some of the charicatures in the film remain just that, despite the good acting).
265;Especiialy Jake Gyllenhaal's acting is brilliant .
266;taking up the role of a schizophrenic Holden Caulfield.
267;The directing and cinematography, brilliant.
268;problems, I give it four stars because it has so many moments in it that I can personally relate to.
269;I think anyone who remembers the confusion, ackwardness and frustration of being an adolescent should see this movie, because, truth is, Jake Gyllenhaal brings Donnie Darko to life in the moments when he seems most sane .
270;if you watch this movie and you remember those ackward adolescent moments you experienced when growing up, you'll find something in Donnie's character to which you can relate.
271;And something in the story that touches you, in one way or other.
272;all in all excellent film!
273;This is the sort of entertainment that is best experienced in a relaxed state of half dreaming.
274;In fact, it took several sessions to reach a solid hypothesis as to the narrative cause and effect.
275;one of Donnie's most interesting qualities is that he has no fear of the common.
276;One of the most important of these occurs while Donnie is out one night on the local golf.
277;All the major characters seemed to go beyond what is expected and create three dimensional beings with quirks, fears and emotions that are subtly alluded to.
278;I particularly enjoyed Gyllenhaal's performance as Donnie.
279;Beth Grant, playing the Gym teacher, is also outstanding.
280;age zealotry is the perfect representation of what is truly dangerous in our politically correct society.
281;along with a great cast, the script is amazing.
282;Chock full of unlikely theories, small but convoluted set pieces and thought provoking dialogue, it made the film entertaining, even after several viewings.
283;"Small touches bring Donnie's world home to us
284;in the end though, it is the greater plot devices that twist our minds like some drug induced mobius loop.
285;This is a simply wonderful movie, it is extremely original, deep, and unexpected.
286;all actors deserve a 5 stars, Drew Barrymore was simply wonderful for the part and acting it out.
287;I am not a particular fan for her look, but in this movie she is incredibly intriguing.
288;I believe """"Tears for Fears"""", being themselves great artists, would share my opinion about it."""
289;Thought provoking and complex, this movie refreshed me after so many bad teen flicks.
290;Donnie Darko not only scares you but he entrapes you in his world of bunnies and time travel.
291;The acting is excellent, allowing you to find yourself in each character and making you become invested in everyones individual story.
292;this film is one of the most orignal ideas set in motion in the past two decades, so regardless of your philosophical convinctions, it will be an interesting and sobering experience.
293;"Excellent, has the classic ""sad."
294;When i heard about it i totally thought it was a comedy.
295;It's a riveting physocological thriller (i did use a dictionary), and i can't believe i'd gone all of those years without seeing it.
296;but I still give it 3 stars for it being original and moody, something rare in the movies these days.
297;Jack Gylenhaal played a great part in this movie.
298;It's for those of you who are open minded and looking for something interesting to keep your interest for a while.
299;His sister Maggie is also in this movie and does a fine job.
300;I recommend this movie for those hot topic, dark personality type people.
301;Donnie Darko was a great movie.
302;Jake Glyndenhall is also part of the director's commentary, and he's very funny.
303;I especially loved his joke about FOUR MILLION DOLLARS!
304;His groundskeeper Willy impression was pretty spot.
305;the deleted scenes provide some incredibly important story components, addressing Donnie's medication, who Frank is, and so much more.
306;Richard Kelly provides commentary for these, too, explaining why he had to cut each scene.
307;reading The Philosophy of Time Travel book that's referenced in the film is a great advantage towards understanding the story, as well.
308;It's clear that Richard Kelly put a LOT of work into this story, and it's nice to see all that work in one place.
309;I also recommend reading the website stories before watching the infomercials.
310;It'll all make sense that way.
311;Highly recommended, especially to those who just didn't quite understand what happened in the movie.
312;So many features, such great commentary, and beautiful design.
313;Production is a bit low end and some of the performances a bit flat but it is a little bit of a mind bender for those who enjoy time travel or the thought of parallel universes.
314;Donnie Darko was the best film I've ever seen in my life.
315;just when you think you've seen every plotline under the sun, along comes the most brilliantly tweaked teen angst film in over a decade.
316;Donnie realizes that since Frank has saved his life, he is now bound to serve Frank's will.
317;Donnie is a kind of secret superhero.
318;You see this tall, solidly built teenager who is good looking enough to have been popular with the jock.
319;He is charming in an off sort of way.
320;it's been a long time since I've enjoyed such a quirky, cult.
321;I loved the social caricatures, the creepy mood and the punctuations of raw emotion in Donnie Darko.
322;See this movie if you have an appreciation for unusual psychological thrillers, science fiction, a nostalgia for 80s culture and maybe a little bit of weirdness in your own mind.
323;All I have to say is, this is worth every penny!
324;It's cheap and has all the best features.
325;It's excellent, my boyfriend loved it!
326;Donnie Darko is a wonderful movie.
327;Either way, it's a great movie that some people might just not get if they don't give it a chance.
328;The music, the tone, and Jake Gyllenhaal's brilliance completely swept me away.
329;Writer/director Richard Kelly has created an altogether awesome movie that is thought.
330;This is the scariest rabbit I've ever seen in my entire life.
331;everything about this movie is great.
332;Jake gives such a great performance, and he has yet to disappoint me.
333;Noah Wyle, Drew Barrymore, and Jena Malone co. star to create a truly all.
334;The music is probably my favorite part of the film.
335;The original score evokes the sci.
336;fi/futuristic feeling, but it's also extremely haunting.
337;And the use of the song Mad World at the end of the film is the most effectively used song that I've ever seen in a movie.
338;This movie is something amazing, something a little creepy and sweet that gets into you and makes you bawl like a baby.
339;But it's easy to pay attention, it's so beautiful.
340;one of my favorite movies.
341;Nowhere near as good as the original.
342;This is one of those extraordinary movies that will make you laugh, cry, bend your head and send tingles up your spine.
343;The first time I watched this, I knew I loved it.
344;And unless you are extremely smart and known something about time travel, you will probably be in the same boat as me.
345;It was amazing to see everything fall into place and I found my own meaning to the movie and its amazing ending.
346;But if you are like me, then you will probably enjoy this film immensely.
347;donnie Darko is a SPECTACULAR movie!
348;Donnie Darko is an excellent movie in the original theatrical release.
349;It has some ambiguous imagery and plot twists that engage the viewer and will cause discussion after watching the movie the first time.
350;Donnie Darko takes on all three and does it admirably.
351;Richard Kelly's first screenplay and directorial debut challenges everything you think you know about time travel and sets it in a wonderful 80's family setting.
352;I loved his family and even though we never know why Donnie's seeing a psychiatrist, we see a slice of his life at home, at school, and in his dreams that alter his and our own ideas about realities.
353;Donnie Darko is an indie movie, meaning that it's geared towards an audience that doesn't like to sit in front of their televisions like unmotivated stumps.
354;That is, until Donnie discovers how he can change the world.
355;It's understandable that films do [and should] pack in numerous ideas and themes.
356;Donnie Darko is, as a forewarning, *very* indecisive but still an enjoyable experience.
357;"The movie, stars the kid from ""Bubble Boy"" who did an amazing acting job, and with roles as diverse as ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Bubble Boy"" I consider him an artist, and am happy that he hasnt been type cast into ""stoner"" comedy roles, because he did an amazing job."
358;"The imagery used in the movie was great, especially the bunny, and the ""spears"" from his chest."
359;It is beautiful, hilarious, and deeply heart.
360;"A lot of people seem to want to compare it to ""Magnolia"", but ""Donnie Darko"" is far superior."
361;"Okay, everyone talks about what a ""masterpiece"" this movie is and I just don't get it."
362;All it is is a creepy disturbed movie with an incredibly scary giant rabbit that tells you to do things.
363;Even the added magic, apocolypse, and time travel couldn't help this movie.
364;I give it an F+
365;get your panties in a bunch, why doncha!truth is this is the director's original vision, it brings things into much more clarity while still remaining very ambiguous.
366;and the effects are a little touched up.
367;i watched each of these versions twice, and I have to say that I can now understand why some fans prefer one over the other.
368;in short, the original cut offers a more thought.
369;provoking experience for the viewer by omitting certain details included in the director's cut that seem to tip the delicate balance in one particular direction.
370;as far as the visual and audio qualities of both versions, each offers a unique but pleasurable experience to the viewer.
371;Just watch the movie and you'll get it).
372;I actually saw this version first and was moved by the enjoyable acting, dynamic characters, strict attention to detail, dark theme, and the cold yet controlled nature of Kelly's doomed split.
373;While this is not a bad thing (the pacing is much better and the wonderful tone of the film is still in tact with the theatrical release) I definitely prefer this version because it's a true science fiction to me, whereas the theatrical version is more of a thriller/introspective.
374;i certainly don't mean to devalue the original version, it is still amazing by my standards.
375;This darkly comic and touching independent gem was worthy of nominations for director, screenplay, and actor.
376;This movie is rich with details that you miss upon first viewing it.
377;It is a refreshing change from the typical box office no.
378;for sheer originality and quirkiness, Donnie Darko is highly recommended.
379;They did a good jog on this one.
380;I love this movie and have several copies of it.
381;This makes a nice addition to my set.
382;thanks Amazon for haveing it in stock.
383;I was definitley one of those that was impressed.
384;That is what is nice about this film.
385;It brings up so many issues and ideas that everyone develops their own beliefs and interpretations.
386;I have had many discussions about religion, time travel, love and life because of this film.
387;But just be open minded and enjoy the ride, after the film is over you're not even sure if you know what you were watching, or if it even happened.
388;This will definitely be a classic.
389;but let me tell you.
390;so I passed it up in the theatre.
391;Surprise yourself with this philosophical poem of a movie.
392;It is a beautiful, moving, exciting, thrilling, pychadelic experience.
393;Best viewed with 5.1 channel surround sound in the dark with the volume turned WAY UP.
394;(and the music, the cinematography, and the editing is unparralled).
395;I bought the soundtrack as well.
396;if that's any indication of my feelings for this phenomenal film.
397;"star reviews
398;jake Gyllenhaal gives a mesmirising performance as the title character (yes, that is his real name), a teenager blessed with intelligence and a vivid imagination"
399;The recipient of numerous awards, the movie is a triumph for all involved, especially Drew Barrymore who co. produced the film through her company Flower Films, who also has a small part as a teacher.
400;Patrick Swayze is surprisingly good as a motivational speaker who incurs Donnie's wrath.
401;"Keep your ears open for the ""Smurfs"" conversation."
402;But its a good confused.
403;I loved it so much, I saw it 5 times at the cinema, in its extremely narrow and short release in Australia.
404;More like light elements of psychological weirdness that never really hits you on a deep personal note.
405;if anything, Donnie Darko delivers with an interesting storyline that makes you wonder where it's going, and that's it.
406;well, imagine looking in the mirror and seeing something like that.
407;There's a variety of characters each with their own assortment of problems and the storyline does a great job focusing and giving enough time to each one of them.
408;this movie is smart, well made and wonderfully acted.
409;for those of you who love to think and can see the pathos built into this world on a daily basis.
410;this movie is 'It's a wonderful life' told from the viewpoint.
411;It's more of a psychological thriller.
412;If you are in your late 20's to mid 30's (if you grew up in the 80's), you should appreciate much of the 80's themes and music.
413;I highly recommend this film to anyone in that age group who is able to handle a more complex, deep, and symbolic story.
414;at Donnie's school, the staff and students have become involved with an inspirational speaker's new program involving a narrow scope of emotional honesty.
415;But the movie belongs to Jake Gyllenhaal.
416;His nuanced performance gives the movie its creepy center.
417;the alternate reality is a creation of Donnie subconscious mind and Frank is a physical representation of that subconscious mind, within that alternate reality.
418;if you look at the film in this way it will begin to make sense.
419;i think that anybody that gives this film a five star rating in some way understands this and understands how clever and mind blowing this film is.
420;Yes, it is very original, but also it's very thought.
421;But for now, this is my first reaction and it's a great one.
422;Because I grew up in 80s and loved the 80s music in this movie.
423;For just the songs I gives it ONE STAR.
424;fi psychological thrillers, so there was a certain sense of awe and mystique that surrounded the film before I got it.
425;sacrifice, and the beauty of both time and the aspects that make us human, watch it again.
426;Make a commitment to trying to understand Darko's complex character, and what he struggles with in life, and how he reconciles those troubles with the gifts that he has been given (and his gifts are extraordinary indeed).
427;Although it may claim other things, it is a story about a young boy who we understand at the beginning does not have it all together, and he is fated for things much greater than he knows.
428;I consider Mr. Kelly's mind Dark, Beautiful and Brilliant.
429;Every detail of the movie is perfectly taken care of,In this outstanding role, Jake gave the performance of a lifetime with convincing authenticity and naturalness the role fits him perfectly!
430;"Drew Barrymore makes a real combination of a mature woman and a nave, but responsible teacher
431;it is a psychological thriller with a little bit of dark comedy that everybody will love, even if you do not understand it you will be thinking about it and watching it over and over again hoping to find more clues.
432;I saw this movie sometime last year for the first time with two of my friends.
433;Despite this, it did have good acting roles and a decent soundtrack.
434;It is a little weird, but that's what makes it unique.
435;I love it because it gets you thinking
436;Simply one of the best films I have ever seen.
437;Richard Kelly, you are a genius.
438;donnie's rapid descent into schizophrenia is a truly amazing and heartbreaking story.
439;his trips over the edge of sanity are also amazing.
440;so many of the scenes are unforgettable.
441;the look on donnie's face is just incredible, portrayed excellently by jake gyllenhaal.
442;the whole fact that donnie is an average teenager from an average, normal family makes the film even more truly frightening.
443;Bubble Boy Jake Gyllenhaal did an excellent job of portraying a really disturbed kid.
444;This movie is a bit quirky and dark (no pun intended), but is still entertaining.
445;I was very impressed with this.
446;THe extra scenes really added flavor and depth to this already great story.
447;I've watched both and I believe the Director's cut is superior.
448;In a brilliant intro to the re.
449;It is strange, dark (of course), cool, mysterious, enigmatic, scary, funny, serious, sarcastic, bleak yet hopeful, mystical, and even charming.
450;Jake Gyllenhaal is Donnie, who is absolutely believable no matter what he says or does.
451;The rest of the cast is an incredible ensemble of big stars in small, crucial roles.
452;She loves him while being frustrated and afraid of his condition.
453;She's got problems enough of her own.
454;Together, this cast of characters orbits perfectly around Donnie's dark center of gravity.
455;Donnie Darko took actual thought to create.
456;It's style and story are unique.
457;This has to be my favourite film of all time, and I wouldn't be able to explain why, other than saying that it is truly beautiful.
458;Every time I watch it I am astounded by the beauty of the story of love, family, life and time travel!
459;Some of the scenes are so perfectly shot, especially those with music played over them.
460;One such scene is Donnie's bike ride to the 80's vibe of Echo and the Bunny Men.
461;Every time I have watched this film I have cried at the final conclusion even though I know it is coming, because it is so heart wrenchingly beautiful.
462;The acting by Jake Gyllenhaal in this film is mind boggling.
463;Donnie Darko is a great movie.
464;Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal both star in this movie!
465;this movie came highly recommended by reliable friends, yet i have to disagree with them.
466;It is at once funny, gripping, and extremely creepy.
467;Jake Gyllenhaal gives an excellent performance as the teenage schizophrenic Donnie, and although the rest of the cast is solid, he definitely carries the film.
468;As the plot deepens, you can see all of these elements and subplots coming together, and it is sometimes enough to widen your eyes and make you shiver as you see another piece of the puzzle snap into place.
469;The film's culmination will stay with you for a long time.
470;It is probably one of the best films I've ever seen about time travel (and one of the best in general), and it treats the concept with intelligence and skill.
471;All around this movie is awsome with a great, thought provoking ending that will keep you guessing even after you've seen it multiple times.
472;IT's a movie that is so weird but so captivating that it grabs you and shuts you up.
473;I have watched the film over 15 times now and I can honestly tell you I still do not have a definite answer for the reasons of Donnie's misfortunes.
474;This new """"friend"""" begins manipulating his actions which creates a chain reaction inevitably leading to the end events."""
475;Throughout the film Donnie finds himself confronting such issues as predestination vs free will and the existence of God.
476;This is one of the funniest satires of suburban life I have seen since American Beauty.
477;"It will be interesting to see which way he goes in the future
478;This movie is AMAZING and one of my absolute favorites of all time!
479;One of those that you might have to watch more than once before you grasp all of its awesomeness but, I assure you, it is most DEFINITELY worth it!!
480;You can watch this movie over and over and still gain more insight every time.
481;The beauty is in the intertwining of the character stories along with the psychological dilemma of Donnie.
482;Incredible storyline and well worth owning.
483;I honestly do not believe that I have seen a more incredible movie in my lifetime.
484;The acting was superb, the cast was wonderful, the plot was incredible, and it all came together to create what will no doubt be a cult classic forever.
485;If you have any doubts about this movie, I can guarantee you, they will be erased upon viewing it.
486;This movie is as close to perfect as you can get.
487;old schizophrenic (aptly played by Jake Gyllenhaal).
488;Donnie awakes on the golf course and walks home.
489;It contains the sarcastic wit of a comedy, the thought.
490;provoking elements of a psychological thriller, the scientific edge of a sci.
491;overall, this movie is one of the most inventive and groundbreaking films of the last ten years, if not more.
492;The track by Gary Jules (mad world) has to be replayed and absorbed by the viewer as a classic.
493;A great addition to a movie lovers collection.
494;Donnie Darko is about a young man(Jake Gyllenhaal)who has an incredible intellect but also deep emotional problems.
495;this is a must see!
496;I didn't really expect much, but I must say that this is a brilliant film.
497;Great cast, very well shot and has spine.
498;tingling moments (my favorite bit is when they are in the cinema), great soundtrack, Frank the rabbit is a stroke of genius .
499;makes it a bit of a horror film.
500;It left a few unanswered questions, but on the whole the idea is very interesting and original.
501;This definitely is a special film.
502;This version of Donnie Darko is superior to any version released before.
503;They fortell the epic ending and cast a bit more light on the unseen story from the older versions.
504;I found myself pausing the movie constantly so I could read them completely.
505;I absolutely love it, even though the """"Echohead and the Bunnymen"""" song from the beginning was changed."""
506;my favorite scene, the movie theater/portal scene has even been updated.
507;It now has an even more ominous feel to it, if that's possible.
508;the movie oozes so much more artistic style this time around.
509;This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I love it when my favorite movies receive this kind of treatment.
510;but it intrigued me enough to keep an eye on it.
511;I made him stop the movie so I can enjoy it with the real 5.1 sound and picture.
512;I ordered it at the amazon the very same day.
513;It's amazing to see how many movies were sent straight to video because of the sept 11th incident.
514;Those of us that appreciate masterful film.
515;I guarantee you will take something new away from it with each viewing.
516;"The Director's Cut adds additional ""scenes"" that add nothing to the narrative and actually dectract from the original presentation."
517;The Director's Cut also horribly mangles the classic and unforgettable soundtrack of the original by removing some songs and reordering the ones that remain.
518;Donnie Darko is a good movie if you're looking for a suspense flick.
519;time travel is an interesting subject by itself and this movie uses it as the main theme.
520;this movie shocks you at the and keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout from the beginning to the end.
521;Donnie Darko is a movie unlike any movie I have ever seen.
522;It is Richard Kelly's first film, and with this being his first, we can expect great things from him in the future.
523;The movie is brilliant in that it displays this idea, but in a way that is very inventive.
524;kelly uses great storytelling and symbolism to get the stroy across and then uses new camera techniques to add efect.
525;The film is shockig and excitingly original and it shouldn't be missed.
526;be warned, it is a movie that involves thinking, but it is worth it.
527;He does a great job.
528;Jena Malone is wonderful as his girlfriend and Patrick Swayze is very funny as a self help guru not mich unlike Tappy Tibbons from Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream.
529;This film is wonderful and has to be seen beucase Kelly has made a film that is impossible to describe using words, is has to be seen to be understood.
530;It is an awesome film.
531;This is one of the few movies that keeps you thinking about it days after watching it.
532;The basic plot is enough to stimulate even the most genius of people.
533;From beginning to end this movie keeps your attention and keeps you guessing at what might happen next.
534;It's with his shrink that some of his inner.
535;It's also with his shrink where he tells of his encounters with the mysterious Frank.
536;Gretchin, his girlfriend, does help to take his mind off of the strange happenings that are going on around him at times, but at night is when everything happens to him.
537;Jena Malone (Gretchin) is also believable.
538;Her and Jake's romance is, to say the least, acted out perfectly.
539;Donnie's family, I feel, was casted perfectly.
540;The way they interact and talk to each other is so true to real life it's scary.
541;Part of the reason they mesh so amazingly is because Jake's real sister was cast as his sister in the film.
542;overall this is without a doubt my favorite film of all time.
543;However hard it is to understand you are rewarded greatly for paying attention.
544;A great end to a flawless film.
545;He survives a plane engine hitting his house thanks to his visions.
546;The movie is bursting with eccentric well.
547;constructed characters from Donnie's family to his friends.
548;There are no weak links here!And technically the movie is beautiful.
549;The camera work is sublime!
550;Even the special effects work incredibly well given the budget.
551;This is a labor of love for all involved and it shows.
552;Donnie Darko is one of the most brilliant,well done, touching,and captivating films I have seen in a long time.
553;It is a lot like a Dali painting because it leaves a lot to question.
554;One can draw his/her own conclusions about what the true meaning of the film is.
555;The sheer volume of existing commentary on this totally original, cutting edge movie are impressive enough, but even more amazing is the degree of depth and insight put into many of these reviews.
556;jake Gyllenhaal is magnificent as the disturbed Donnie Darko.
557;The subtle but dramatic changes in personality, body movements, gestures, voice and physical appearance displayed during his mental transition from one state of reality to the next are done to perfection.
558;Just because a strategically marketed movie has a plot that doenst conform to normal Hollywood formulas doenst make it a good movie.
559;It's definitely a little out there and strange but the story is great.
560;it is still a great movie and I liked the 20 minutes of extra footage.
561;If you love movies and want a more rounded version of the film, get the original and stick with it.
562;I bought this movie because I really liked it.
563;Interpret the ending as you see fit.
564;If so, you will absolutely adore this movie.
565;It is definitely something you will be thinking about for days because it isn't super straightforward plot.

572;This is absolutely one of the most thought provoking films I have ever seen.
573;She and Donnie become friends.
574;Donnie Darko is a romantic suspense film about sacrifice and redemption.
575;with no gratuitous violence, nudity, or gore, this film is purely driven by the characters and their circumstances, and I recommend it to anyone who likes to think for themselves.
576;Yet, it worked on me for several days to where I got up courage and watched it again.
577;donnie Darko is a film that deals with all manner of existential issues.
578;And, while one would think that as Donnie reverses time there would be no recollection on the part of those whose lives have been altered through his actions, the last scene is of the two people he loved the most waving in tentative recognition of who they are and what they know.
579;It is beautiful and sad and gloriously uplifting all at the same time.
580;Let's face it, the only reason why this movie deserves at least a two star rating is because of the awesome songs and fascinating musical arrangements.

585;A future where you are relatively happy and life has some meaning.
586;I enjoyed the movie but it is by no means entertaining.
587;Most everyone will be glad they saw it as the acting and directing are excellent.
588;Fun, fresh every time, entertaining, fascinatingly odd, startling, amazing.
589;This was a classic the first day it ran .
590;and it ran with bizare eloquence.
591;It was extremely creative and imaginative, and defiantly one of those movies you will be discussing with friends after seeing it.
592;Worth seeing, but not worth owning.
593;It was really worth it to hear the makers of the film talk about their work, especial the last few scenes.
594;The purpose of this cut, as Mr. Kelly says himself, is to try and make the movie closer to what he wanted it to be in theaters.
595;If you're like the poor s. o. b. who shows up in one of the special features on the disc( more on him later ), than this could could very well help you achieve nirvana(the state of mind, not the band, for you kids out there).
596;This is a fun track, with Mr. Smith cracking jokes and busting Kelly's chops over the more pretentious qualities of the the movie.
597;He also catches up to Mr. Kelly at the comic.

599;The dark moments, creepy special effects, realistic teens, and especially the subtle comedy [hint: the smurf monologue is PRICELESS},.
600;Jake Gylenhaal is a rising star who will bring more than mysterious good looks to the Hollywood scene.
601;Everyone has to see it once.
602;I have seen hundreds upon hundreds of movies throughout my life and Donnie Darko is one of the most original, enthralling pieces of cinema I have ever seen.
603;Donnie Darko became one of my favorites the moment I saw it, and maintained it's position in my heart even many viewings later.
604;It's just a film that resonates, in which the characters' emotions as they go through extreme experiences can speak to many people.
605;I know more than one intelligent movie buff who did not like this film, who felt that the idiosyncratic elements distracted from the theme and from the ability of the viewer to relate it to their own reality.
606;It is a science fiction film yet we are given enough background to also think that maybe this is a film about a mentally ill or schizophrenic teenager.
607;The school principal fires the one teacher that treats the students as intelligent and supports the most outlandish right wing teacher on the faculty.
608;Very few movies that I've seen in the past few years have touched me as much as this.
609;Donnie has friends and even a girlfriend.
610;He's good kid we like.
611;And Donnie knows more than the other characters.
612;What a ride, what a character.
613;It is like a beautiful, intelligent woman, where you love every part of it, in every way.
614;It is a flawless creation.
615;And his teachers, Noah Wyle, Drew Barrymore, and one crazy lady who loves Patrick Swayze, are all tremendously entertaining figures, in every way.
616;many people at the beginning roll their eyes at such a perceivedly dark piece of work, But by the end, they are enlightened, laughing, scared, and astonishingly overjoyed.
617;And the hip 80's soundtrack will make any viewer fill with uneasy glee.
618;It is an admirable mind.
619;twister, and you will spend many nights awake arguing with yourself over the meaning of the film.
620;it perfectly blends dark comedy, horror, drama, intution, curiosity, and virtuosity into one complex, compelling mastercraft.
621;I highly recommend this movie.
622;as you watch the movie, several possibilities come to mind.
623;Donnie Darko is about self.
624;On one hand, it offers hope that we do have control over our destinies and we are not just machines that God has set in motion to follow His plan.
625;Frank the giant rabbit is organizing and directing Donnie's life.
626;this is an excellent story and needs to be watched at least twice to get all the subtle points.
627;tangle the intricacies of this film's plot.
628;what is likeable about this movie?
629;To begin with, as almost every other reviewer has pointed out, Jake Gyllenhaal does a phenomenal job with the role of Darko.
630;His character is extremely intelligent, cynical, slightly demented and ultimately charismatic .
631;The plot is definitely unique, dark and subtly humorous.
632;The scene with Darko, his uptight Health teacher (I think she was a Health teacher) and a """"Life Line"""" is hilarious."""
633;Moreover, I think that, in general, the relationships in this film are treated in a very nuanced manner and with a great deal of tenderness.
634;Darko and his older sister (played by Gylenhaall's real.
635;life sister Maggie) demonstrate an especially endearing .
636;lastly, I think one of the greatest aspects of this film is its soundtrack.
637;There are several great 80s songs .
638;all very nostalgic, moody, brooding, and sexy.
639;i definitely recommend giving `Donnie Darko' a shot.
640;It's unique, it'll probably leave you thinking (at least: 'what just happened?!?')
641;and I think most people will enjoy it.
642;Unfortunately there were several scenes that were cut from this movie that might help one understand it, but thanks to an incredible array of delicious extras all can be made clear.
643;Rarely is so much emotion and passion caught in one place.
644;In one of the most mysterious movies ever created.
645;Donnie Darko is my favorite movie of all time, no other movie could deliver the interesting characters, complex plot, or intriguing storyline as Donnie Darko does.
646;Not only that, but the acting is superb, especially Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie, he portrays a deeply disturbed character who has visions of the end of the world told to him by a six foot bunny rabbit named Frank.
647;this movie has humor, romance, intrigue, mystery and ingenuity.
648;(By the way, a lot of people, myself included, got absolutely addicted to the song Mad World by Gary Jules.
649;overall great movie and great deal for the UMD.
650;Highly recommended for fans of the movie (and anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet.)
651;i love this movie, it is such a mind trip.
652;every time i watch it i see something new something that changes my opinion about whats going on.
653;even after the 1000th time (no im not exadurating that) it is still cool to see how the charachters lives twist and intertwine with each other.
654;has got something going for it.
655;While flawed, it has some genuinely beautiful moments and captures the strange and dreamlike world of some teenagers perfectly.
656;One of my favorite movies.
657;The SD is true to form while the Blu.
658;Includes a special features disc that is essentially identical to what the special edition of the movie supplies.
659;Would highly recommend to anyone.
660;Any form of media that makes you think has succeeded in what it set out to do.
661;The script is original and entirely unpredictable.
662;And it's a treat to see actors we know well (Drew Barrymore, who also produced, and Noah Wyle) stretch well beyond our usual expectations.
663;There is great humor in this film as well as great sorrow.
664;jake Gyllenhaal gives a stunning performance as Donnie.
665;reveal a vast, searching intelligence.
666;this time as the despairing mother of brilliant and troubled Donnie, simultaneously loving and hating him for being emotionally beyond her reach.
667;And Jena Mallone is just wonderful, one of the truest, most authentic young actors around today.
668;this is filmmaking at its best.
669;an adventure for the mind.
670;I'll just say that it was a reasonably interesting movie to watch and I feel like I got my money's worth .
671;will probably watch it again at some point.
672;I got a great deal on it here at Amazon and as usual, shipping was prompt and it came in good condition.
673;Tolkien was the great linguist who actually created his own languages.
674;So if you read this then now you know.
675;So the movie is great.
676;He wants to change the way things will be and uses his powers to do so by keeping himself from dying the fateful nite.
677;Then you have this old lady who also has these powers and writes a book on it and she wants things set right and put back in order, and she does this unconsciously as well by causing Frank to accidently kill Gretchen by unconsciously always being in the middle of the road.
678;If time travel itself is possible.
679;So the bunny was right all along, the world did end.
680;The touching ending is what made it all the worthwhile.
681;The end has the director saying that Donnie is smiling because Donnie thinks it was all just a dream.
682;Because to her it was all just a dream that's slipping out of hers and everyone else's memory.
683;And I feel that the love story here is awesome even though they downplayed it with editing.
684;This film is, quite simply, brilliant.
685;Unrelenting in its haunting, mystical and totally engrossing style, it is a how.
686;I loved that Echo and the Bunnymen were used to open up this movie.
687;The killing moon is a great song.
688;But, it all came together with the director's explaination and I found that to be unfortunate because this could have been a terrific movie.
689;The 80s songs are great and go perfect with every scene without being cheesy or anything.
690;The story is unique the movie is beautifly shot.
691;But you at LEAST have to give it a chance and watch it TWICE before you decide.
692;So I watched it again, still didnt get it but I really liked alot better the second time.
693;You notice new things, you make up new thoeries, and you understand it a little better each time.
694;Quite simply I cried at the end of this wonderful movie.
695;Donnie Darko goes places most other films don't, to the heart, and in the most astonishingly simple ways.
696;innocence, joy, love, confusion, anger, pain and finally, tragic realisation.
697;jake Gyllenhaal is the next Johnny Depp, he's that good.
698;donnie Darko is a movie for the times, a movie everyone has to see.
699;I love the way this movie plays with reality and imagination.
700;I love tales that 'bend the brain', and this one sure works on the ole noodle.
701;My teenage children and I love this movie.
702;"It is a ""family favorite."""
703;The story, the music, and the cast are superb.
704;The film is haunting and keeps you feeling like there is something deeper to peer upon hidden in the plot.
705;This seems to be becoming an increasingly popular trend among modern films.
706;A director should be able to imply enough meaning for a movie to make sense.
707;'Donnie Darko' marks the excellent (and promising) directorial debut of Richard Kelly, a relatively un.
708;of director that has struck gold with this outstanding tale of belonging and exploring the complexities of time travel.
709;The acting, direction, and special effects were outstanding, and not to forget the beautifully composed soundtrack featuring Gary Jules' heartfelt cover of 'Mad World'.
710;rather than sticking to one genre, the movie instead explores many, easily succeeding with each.
711;An unforgettable discussion about how Smurf's have sex is hilarious, as is Donnie's sister repeating the vulgarity she hears from her siblings at the dinner table.
712;"i highly recommend 'Donnie Darko'
713;cuz it was a gift for someone.
714;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is good tho.
715;Donnie Darko is an excellent movie for people who like to think and have an open mind to see outside of the box dealing with everyday life.
716;The blu ray version is gorgeous.
717;It has a great clear picture and the sound is amazing.
718;A stunning debut film that displays a wild eyed inventiveness, uncanny originality and steady, assured professionalism .
719;a rare combination that entitles this film to a larger audience than it received in limited distribution.
720;If anything, Donny Darko is this generation's version of Carrie, full of teen angst and dark, mystical occurences, held together with a thoughtful, focused performance by Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead.
721;What a smart, savvy actress and businesswoman she's become!
722;This movie is a masterpiece, and unlike just about EVERYTHING that comes out in the theaters these days, this kind of movie has never been done before.
723;The more you watch the movie, and the more your mind lets you see things come together, the more amazing the filming becomes.
724;Diesel to come on screen and tell you exactly what it is.)
725;And the icing on the cake is the music.
726;This movie was made to look and sound like it takes place in the 80's, but the whole eighties feel is very subtle.
727;It's one of a kind.
728;the film explores teen angst, religion, love, and science fiction, all in an unorthadox presentation that may leave you scratching your head, but nontheless inspired by its haunting brilliance.
729;The solution is there if you have the ingenuity to ponder it .
730;the film is set in the 80s, and director Richard Kelly does a superb job in giving it a distinct 80s aura.
731;Combining this style with the vivid and eerie soundtrack, Donnie Darko is sure to leave a lasting impression on you and will give you a lot to think about.
732;Director/Screenwriter Richard Kelly's debut is absolutely incredible.
733;It's easy to see why this movie didn't go mainstream, but rahter has become somewhat of a cult classic.
734;Jake Gyllenhaal was incredible, especially considering he was only 19 when this was filmed.
735;The rest of the cast was perfect too, which you might not think looking at some of the names.
736;Not because it's another case of trying to show a bit of retro cool by referencing the 80's but because it fits in so well.
737;The fact that the scene is in slow motion should be naff but in fact it is close to the best placement of a song in a movie in ages.
738;donnie Darko is a fantastic movie that will leave you with a smile on your face, despite its bittersweet ending.
739;It certainly deserves a wider audience than it got on release in the cinema with a groundbreaking performance by Jake Gyllenhaal and a wonderfully understated performance from Drew Barrymore.
740;It's important that we cherish movies like these as they have become so rare .
741;I love this movie so so much.
742;The story is wonderful and there is so much more depth to the movie than many people realize.
743;as a fellow crazy person i often scowl and stomp about the way that mentaly ill are portrayed.
744;they nailed it, and everything was done in such a haunting mannor.
745;I was really looking forward to this movie, but so much of it strikes me as a really well made, feature.
746;why?Because """"Donnie Darko"""" is bursting with inspiration (some fresh, a lot borrowed) and yet it just doesn't seem to have the wisdom of very much actual experience."""
747;smile glower of a Kubrick anti.
748;it is cinimaticly beutiful!the story is complex yet engrossing.
749;the entire end is in the movie in one way or another you just have to be clever enough to pick up on it.
750;I thought the casting was brilliant, thus the acting was perfect.
751;jake Gyllenhaal has been compared to countless, great, young actors.
752;He is in a class by himself.
753;The rest of the cast was equally inspired.
754;It's totally up to the viewer to decide what they think happened.
755;it's a commentary on a lot of things: society, values, sanity, love.
756;this is a pensive film.
757;Take some time with it.
758;Watch it 2 or 3 times.
759;and just as a side note: This movie has some of the greatest dialogue in movie history (ie.
760;the conversation about the Smurfs is priceless).
761;"For me, I enjoy that I finally ""get"" this thing."
762;"some directors will come out with a huge film, and either make films that surpass or films that are great on their own merits but public reaction is ""they liked the first movie better""."
763;I'm kind of in the middle.
764;"Got no problem with him adding scenes to create his ultimate ""vision"" of the movie, just glad he cast Maggie Gyllenhaal, easy on the eyes that one."
765;Both serve their purpose of providing a good film and I guess it just comes down to one choice: do you prefer theorizing, or do you prefer understanding everything?
766;This film is a clever fantasy with a suprising twist, which should keep most viewers guessing until the end.
767;In fact, ~Darko~ has a great ending, subtle, thought inspiring and extremly powerful.
768;sensitive teenager, brilliant in many ways, who is convinced the world will come to an end on a certain day in the near future.
769;His 'imaginary' friend, a hypnotic and somewhat demonic rabbit, commands Donnie to do certain things, (the famous schizophenic voice) also informing the boy of future events.
770;The screenplay by director and writer, Richard Kelly, is indeed flawless, which manages to connect seemingly disconnected people and events in the boy's life in a very believable and compelling way.
771;the cast is an unusual ensemble that one would not expect to see in an offbeat film .
772;~Donnie Darko~ is one of those rare and surprising films, dark, humorous and original .
773;this is an excellent motion picture.
774;Hypocracy, jealousy and redemption come to mind.
775;one of my top 20 movies of all time.
776;"Kelly's ""Southland Tales"" recieved a lot of flack, but still I enjoyed the chaos just as much."
777;This is honestly one of the most moving peices of recent cinema i have seen.
778;Jake Gyllenhaal was good in October Sky, he is phenominal in this film.
779;it keeps going and going.
780;Donnie Darko is one of those films that, even with a re.
781;There are plenty, and I mean PLENTY, of subplots that are pretty interesting.
782;The characters are also worth a look because, although not every one of them experiences growth, the majority of them who do grows in an odd yet interesting way.
783;the direction and cinematography are pretty good, even if they do hint at past movies like E. t. and Silence of the Lambs.
784;The effects are excellent for an independent film, and the simplistic, ambient score matches nicely with the movie's atmosphere.
785;As you may have heard, the whole film, beginning, middle, and ending, are open to discussion.
786;I truly believe that this movie is his welcome call to the artform, both scriptwise and direction.
787;As a result, it feels more complete and in some instances, adds more poignancy to the film, the best of which shows Donnie's relationship with the rest of his family.
788;I for one recommend seeing the first before the Cut.
789;around nice version of the film though.
790;the music is great and the songs are amazing.
791;I thought it was a quirky, crazy 80s period piece and had a killer soundtrack (loved the use of the Killing Moon during the opening sequence, thank god they didn't stick with the INXS song I believe was supposed to go instead).
792;i thought Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was very good, he gave body and credibility to a character who appears (and most likely, is) totally unfocused, troubled, nihilistic, yet proves to also be intelligent and aware of all the good and the bad around him.
793;Other than that, I loved the styllization of the movie, the clever use of imagery, and yes.
794;"garde"" art, but it will make you think, and it keeps you glued to your seat."
795;Donnie darko was the best movie that I have seen this year.
796;The 90's being THE worst decade for films, I hope that more movies are this good in our new millenium.
797;It's a great movie either way.
798;I love this Jake Gyllenhal classic.
799;The music is great, the story is well.
800;There's such a wide range of emotion blended together perfectly.
801;Jake Gyllenhaal is one of those great actors that haven't been fully discovered yet and needs to be soon.
802;Watch it two or three times to pick up underlying plots.
803;It helps putting it in perspective.
804;It's one of those movies that you have to figure out it's true meaning on your own.
805;Whoa is all I can say, this movie really blew my mind!
806;It not only has a great cast, and story, but really good acting.
807;I thought it was funny when Drew Barrymore's character say that cellar door is the most beautiful word in the English language, not knowing that she's leading Donnie towards his fate.
808;it was a great movie with a lot of twists and I would recommend it to science fiction fans everywhere!
809;This is an incredibly dark, comedic, and somber film that largely lacks in linear narrative, but covers its ground well with a stunningly original plot and quirky, tone.
810;The most satisfying fact is that it is all done extraordinarily well, servicing up what is.
811;one of the best build.
812;He takes commands from a giant rabbit while sleepwalking.
813;After that is a mystical journey through Donnie's mind.
814;While serving up a ton of foreshadowing and plot devices (which seem pointless until the film concludes), writer/director Richard Kelly gracefully churns out political satire, comedy, and insightful views on human nature and teenage rebellion.
815;I was also impressed by how well the characters developed, no matter how small or insignifican their roles seem to be.
816;They're all important in the overall scope of the film.
817;The conclusion is something that will probably turn this into a bit love/hate film, if you throw things like implausibility and suspension of disbelief.
818;this film is risky, but made with some incredibly promising talent.
819;I, for one, love it for everything it is.
820;It is dark and disturbing and a totally crazy ride but it is also beautiful and mezmerizing.
821;I watch it annually and each time I find something new and take away something new as well.
822;This review is for the regular version, NOT the Director's Cut.
823;i love this movie, even though I don't get it worth a squirrel's nuts.
824;And Noah Wyle, Drew Barrymore, and Patrick Swayze are ingenious background players.
825;Jena Malone is great, Frank.
826;"bunny is great, Roberta Sparrow, even that chunky Asian chick who says ""Chut up."""
827;"also, this is one of those movies that you don't have to really ""get"" 100%."
828;"it's one of those ""makes a big statement about humanity"" movies."
829;the whole movie is excellent from the storyline to the casting, but it's a mystery wrapped in an enigma shrouded in shadow.
830;Jake Gyllenhaal is outstanding as delusional high school student Donnie Darko in talented director Richard Kelly's thought provoking and stunningly creative award winning flick, which he also wrote.
831;In a fortuitous twist of fate, inexplicably a jet engine crashes through the Darko house, specifically into Donnie's room.
832;Donnie began becoming increasingly seduced by the concept of time travel somewhat fueled by science teacher Professor Monnitoff played by Noah Wylie.
833;kelly concludes this extremely unique flick in terrific fashion, requiring rumination in it's interpretation.
834;the musical score was haunting and enhanced the tenor of the flick especially in conjunction with the dream sequences.
835;The acting requiring players to portray some very curious characters was very nicely done.
836;disc Director's Cut.2001 was a year full of outstanding films, but one film stood out from all of the others for its sheer inventiveness, its brilliant vision, and its director's ambition.
837;Richard Kelly's feature debut film as a director, Donnie Darko, is a fascinating science fiction drama.
838;com) and some nifty camerawork and visual effects.
839;Since its initial release, Donnie Darko has developed a loyal fanbase across the globe, especially in the U. k. where the film first achieved its cult classic status.
840;The man refers to himself as simply Frank, and he warns Donnie that the world will end in 28 days.
841;Meanwhile, Donnie's family struggles with his peculiar behavior and his general disregard for their feelings.
842;The film's director, Richard Kelly, proves himself to be one of the most extraordinary up and coming filmmakers.
843;Wow, man I was surprised and in a good way.
844;While a dark movie it is still excellent and leave you wanting to watch it multiple times.
845;I loved the original, but this version is so much better.
846;This is the most original, ingenious film I've ever seen.
847;Time travel, insanity, teenage angst, love, family, sacrifice, horror, and so much more to this film.
848;The end result is a haunting, enjoyable, touching story that will leave you thinking and smiling with an aching heart.
849;After you think about it, though, you'll be able to figure it out.
850;He's actually very good and wonderfully cast.
851;i know many people probably would try to sum up this film, but this is one of those great movies that's more fun to watch when you don't know a single thing about it.
852;Although it is part drama, part romance and part teen movie, it is primarily science fiction, with a sub.
853;"Keogh goes on to add that ""Darko"" is stunningly original."
854;Richard Kelly seems to be able to aptly create a David Lynch.
855;like atmosphere that will keep the audience watching.
856;That was the most twisted piece of cinematography and intelligent storytelling I've ever witnessed.
857;For a long time I have wondered what my most favourite film of all time is.
858;I'd say to them, watch it again, and then watch it again .
859;And now I'm going to watch it again.
860;the man is a legend.
861;Wow, what a great movie.
862;It's one that makes you think about it for a few days, and changes your outlook on life.
863;this is a movie that really improves with age.
864;He has since produced a fascinating output and diverse body of work.
865;His performance in this movie is nothing short of excellent.
866;He starts off as a confused teenager but Gyllenhaal gradually shows that there is so much more to this character than meets the eye.
867;It's quite a soulful, thoughtful performance that is also funny and heartbreakingly tragic.
868;the whole cast is top notch: from ER's Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore to the always reliably Jena Malone and a surprise turn from Patrick Swayze playing a slimy Infomercial guru.
869;They really feel and act like a genuine family with all of the little behavioural nuances.
870;This is one of the best audio commentaries out there for that simple fact.
871;Best of all, he points out all kinds of images that were buried in the background that you don't notice the first few times.
872;It is these attentions to detail that really give this film an added complexity and I'm very appreciative of Kelly for drawing attention to them in his commentary track.
873;all but fun to listen to and the many deleted scenes are very interesting to watch and fill in a few more gaps.
874;It should be interesting to see how many of these are put back into the Director's Cut.
875;this is an incredibly original film that never insults your intelligence.
876;This is definitely worth checking out.
877;Because you really should watch this film the first time Cold.
878;Let me say that I have liked few films as much as I liked this.
879;I really love this film and I've already reccomended it to all my friends.
880;This has to be one of the best films I've seen in a long time.
881;jake Gyllenhaal is absolutely fabulous, hysterically funny and touching in his more depressing moments.
882;all in all, I was impressed.
883;I originally wanted to see this movie because of it's stellar cast.
884;He starts to question life, and the theory of time travel.
885;Anyone with an interest in time travel or a love for dark films should see this.
886;"stylistically, it is very interesting
887;That's as good a way of summing it up as any other.
888;some deleted/extended scenes one can watch with or without commentary.
889;Is it worth your time?
890;Jake Gyllenhaal works masterfuly here as Donnie, a borderline scitsophrenic who sees a disturbing future and talks to some reptilian rabbit who gives him subconsious commands that Donnie in turn acts out.
891;The subplots are intoxicating and the overall feel of the film is that of paranoia, but it works wonderfully.
892;The charactors are all played very well from the sister (real life sister Maggie) girlfriend (Malone) and even the [.]
893;the story of time travel and predestination flow so well here that your almost lost as to what your really believing is real until the final moments of the film.
894;Everyone here does an amazing job, but the real star here is the script which is so involving and masterfully written that your drawn into the film after the first frame, involving Donnie lying in the middle of the road upon daybreak, and you won't lose interest until half way through the credits, and even then, the soundtrack is pretty good.
895;This movie is great and recomended to anyone who wants a good mind bending drama.
896;Overall, this movie is a masterpiece, with stunning visual effects and cinemetography!
897;The story is well thought out and intertwined/interwoven in a way that will make you think for days, even after the third time you have seen it.
898;But is will help adults re.
899;Every time I see it I see something I didn't see before.
900;While the extended cut explains a lot (and is a must see for fanatics) I still think the original was better.
901;I went to see this film in the theater a few months ago, knowing very little about it, and was absolutely blown away by its inventiveness, cleverness, and vitality.
902;mo scene set to the tune of tears for fears' head over heels is a classic movie moment.
903;the film is poignant, witty, and absurd.
904;And I think American Beauty was a great film.
905;Because if the world ends, it'll just be you and him.
906;the other reviews here are much better written and more detailed.
907;this films encapsulates that feeling in an exceptional way and shows us how fragile life is and how close we can come into harms way without ever even knowing.
908;a great film no matter what genre your into, stongly recommended.
909;DONNIE DARKO is by far one of the best dark, strange, and brilliant films I've watched in a long, long time.
910;OK, I can be pretty easy to please sometimes, but in this case .
911;Now, I strongly recommend getting the Director's Cut .
912;Love this movie, not as good as the non.
913;this movie, surprisingly enough, was exquisite.
914;the film portrays teenage angst in a creative, yet realistic light.
915;It definitely makes you think about it far after the credits have finished.
916;i highly recommend the film.
917;I would actually give it 4 and 1/2 stars.
918;I was afraid it was just going to be weird for weirdness sake (which it is) but it is also weird to be funny, and the movie is hilarious.
919;Jenna Malone is a really good young actress (hot too).
920;Best Patrick Swayze performance ever!
921;Perhaps I went into this movie with unreasonably high expectations, after all everyone who has seen this movie has put it on a pedestal.
922;All of the deleted scenes added vital revelations (more conversations with Frank!
923;the director cut also extends some scenes unnecesarily, such as the first night in the hotel.
924;it is still a great film, but not as cool as the original.
925;The #1 fan clip was funny, but not worth the extra $10.
926;_Donnie Darko_ is an amazing film that is so original that it shakes up your average, movie watching experience.
927;In the film, Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Donnie, an incredibly sharp teen who becomes fascinated with the ideas of time travel due to the visions he suffers from.
928;His schizophrenic visions add an intensity to the film that keeps you on the edge of your seat trying to piece together all that is happening.
929;The acting in this film is quite good, but it is the film's originality that will grab you and shake your spinal column.
930;the soundtrack is superb and the plotline is very engaging.
931;One can characterize this film has having some elements of tragedy under its belt as we watch Donnie, a character that we become sympathetic towards despite his mental instability, following the groove of fate to its inevitable conclusion.
932;perhaps he has tapped into truth that is beyond our grasp.
933;I highly recommend this film for those who enjoy a bit of a hallucinatory ride and exploring darker themes.
934;The film has developed a cult following and promises to continue.
935;This movie is utterly amazing.
936;It was the most memorable line from the movie for me.
937;It is a very interesting concept and leaves viewers questioning.
938;i had already paid $20 for the first release, but because I loved it so much, I absolutely HAD to have this new and allegedly improved version as well.
939;There was one scene regarding his medication that added a bit of a twist.
940;that is how insignificant the added scenes are.
941;Those scenes just did not transition well into the movie.
942;Another noticeable difference is one of the ending scenes.
943;Great movie with many neat twists.
944;Definately a movie worth watching over and over again.
945;Everytime you watch it you will discover something that you hadn't noticed the previous times.
946;The writing and directing is fantastic, and the acting, particular Jake Gylenhaal in the title character, blew me away.
947;The deleted scenes really add something to the final product, but the special features are pretty average.
948;It is more thoughtful, complex, and thought provoking than American Beauty, though on a certain level it is a tad less realistic.
949;I honestly don't want to spoil one second of this movie for you because it is so good.
950;Truly, it is nothing short of a masterpiece.
951;Films that mess with your head and make you think long after they're over are the best movies.
952;From the visually astonishing cinematography to the incredible acting to the mindbending plot, Donnie Darko is by far the most outstanding over.
953;Donnie Darko is one of those rare suprising films that takes all your expectations and throws them in a blender.
954;fold to very unique ends.
955;The script and pacing allow for real empathy especially in his therapy sessions where he uncovers the source of his dilemna.
956;stunning in every way a film should be.
957;I know the movie is a great cult classic, but I haven't watched the director's cut.
958;One thing you can say about """"Donnie Darko"""" is that it is certainly an ambitious film."""
959;"My understanding is that this film has developed a sizable cult following and I would respond to that,""Whatever!"""
960;I figured it had to be worth a try .
961;"in an era of endless sequels and ""copycat"" movies, ""Donnie Darko"" is a true original: clever, thought."
962;provoking, filled with surprises and delights and wry humor.
963;it should be seen by anyone, of any age, who appreciates creative film.
964;Worth watching more than once .
965;director Richard Kelly's debut feature, the Lynchian Donnie Darko, is a tale of adolescent angst ripe with enigmatic sci.
966;This endlessly inventive film is the virtual antithesis of happy.

968;As a result, Donnie comes to believe Frank's prophecy that the world will end in 28 days.
969;perfectly compliment the film's apocalyptic wind.
970;hippie Karen (Drew Barrymore), Graham Greene's The Destructors and its tale of creation/destruction beautifully compliments the film's fateful finale.
971;Donnie Darko is a blazingly original evocation of better.
972;You have to love these reality/fantasy juxtapositions and this one works very well as time becomes the element which defines what you see while you eventually determine just what you did see.
973;Jena Malone is an ideal love interest for this seemingly forsaken though somehow deeper than average character as he ambles through a series of experiences with a quietude that suggests something within him which is unusual at the very least.
974;The roles are played well, the imagery is aesthetically stimulating and this too is a film for the ages.
975;I have seen Donnie Darko many times and I love the movie.
976;There are a ton of extra scenes, and they're not just """"fluff"""" shots, but actually contribute a lot to the story."""
977;"If you saw the original version and liked it, but didn't quite understand what was going on all the time, watch the director's cut, and it's very likely that you'll ""get it"" this time 'round."
978;Each time I watch it, I find even more brilliance in it, more to ponder, more to discuss.
979;So, with that said, how do I review the screen's most complex and disturbing look inside the mind of a borderline schizo teen who is at the crux of possible worldwide destruction described by the poster bunny for rabbit population control while Donnie is on a discovery path to himself?Well, I could start with the fact that so much more lies within the coal plated exterior edges of this true horriffic masterpiece than first meets the eye.
980;i could focus on the few comedic elements that lie on the outskirts of some of the most dramatically striking scenes ever devised in any movie, let alone one of an outsider teen on the brink of seeming madness, but really more sane and smart than most.
981;Incredible story, solid acting, amazing 80's New Wave soundtrack, and the best depiction of high school angst since The Breakfast Club.
982;It's pure genius plus one of the biggest Mind [.]
983;the soundtrack alone is worth watching it over and over .
984;jake Gyllenhaal gives a performance that is not only Oscar worthy but well crafted beyond his years.
985;the whole cast is amazing as well.
986;i have dealt with the schizophrenic mind first hand what most people don't realize is most people with this disorder are highly highly intelligent and some are genius's.
987;You can be speaking to a schizophrenic and they're right on scope and displaying these highly intelligent qualities then out of the blue they're mind makes a left turn and where it leads from that point can be anything from Frank the bunny to the CIA chasing them.
988;this is why Donnie Darko works so well and the whole ambiguous atmosphere is apropos.
989;i guarantee if you watch this movie with an open mind and clear your emotional pallet before handit will stay with you forever.
990;I'm a big Kevin Smith fan, but if you are going to talk over a movie, at least talk about the movie!
991;light the circle, and press ENTER.
992;It is such an intriguing film .
993;"I wouldn't say I am drawn to movies about time travel, but I have always liked all the ""Back to the Future"" movies and used to watch ""Quantum Leap"" on TV a lot."
994;There's nothing better than beginning a cinematic journey and knowing absolutely nothing about the film.
995;If you can, approach this edgy, supernatural film in just that way.
996;If you like David Lynch, for instance, especially MULHOLLAND DRIVE, you'd love this.
997;It also has a sort of Alan Ball feeling to the visual narrative.
998;A film that teases with time travel, personal responsibility, and the worst of teen society, it's definitely darkly humorous.
999;it's been a while since a movie surprised and disturbed me quite so much.
1000;I've since gulped down every movie he's been in, including the undeservedly maligned Bubble Boy, and this man's range is astonishing.
1001;"but ""Donne Darko"" has a pretty considerable following and yes, has achieved cult status."

1005;There is a good amount of grain and black levels are good.
1006;But maybe its the original film elements but I did notice a good amount of noise as well.
1007;"overall, ""Donnie Darko"" (theatrical or Director's Cut) has good PQ and while not as vibrant or very detailed compared to modern releases on Blu."
1008;ray, the PQ for the film is good.
1009;The film is primarily central and front channel driven!Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish and French.
1010;Actually, a very enjoyable commentary to hear these two filmmakers discuss the film.
1011;And also discussing the differences between both the Director's Cut and theatrical version.

1015;And even if you do watch the theatrical version or even the Director's Cut, only those willing to rewatch and dissect the film, to piece together the various clues, will find the film to be quite entertaining.
1016;The Director's Cut changes a few musical sequences and adds in other sequences that make you wonder why the Director added them but needless to say, the film was complex to begin with and now it's even made a bit more complex with the additional footage.
1017;i often feel that there is also a message from Kelly that he felt towards society.
1018;Donnie tells a teacher to shove something up her butt and his father just laughs.
1019;It's an artistic expression that reminds me of a Picasso painting where you can see a painting that looks so off, so dark and bleak, but someone else can see it as light, vibrant and unique.
1020;It's mean for the viewer to take what they got from the film and interpret it their way.
1021;Some may find it complex, some may find it as a simply love story.
1022;"ray, then by all means, definitely give ""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" a chance!"
1023;Donnie Darko is meant to be experienced and re.
1024;It's a film that is thought.
1025;provoking, intriguing and surreal but at the same time, I can easily say that it may not be accessible for the general public and it may not be for you.
1026;"But if you are into artistic expression of cinema, then ""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" is worth watching!Definitely recommended for the cineaste!"
1027;But good prices, and great movie to watch if youve never seen it before.
1028;A good movie with an excellent soundtrack.
1029;like figure of Donnie pushes the limit with an unusual, yet brilliant, performance.
1030;If you are looking for a great film you can watch multiple times, then look no further than this star studded gem.
1031;DD was a flick that i watched because it was available for something like 10 bucks and i read the synopsis and it seemed interesting so i bought it and i watched it and i liked it and so should you.
1032;i would recommend this movie to readers out there who happen to be reading this review that i wrote because, first of all, this is a very well made film especially considering that it was done by a first timer.
1033;the vivid imagery is fairly mesemerizing and intrigues you to the point where you find yourself captivated with the imagery and then the characers and then the story.
1034;the acting is alos excellent as jena and the rest do a fine job.
1035;jake is his usual self, which is good even though he seems to be the same in all his flicks but he is a perfect fit and plays Donnie well as hell.
1036;my only complaint is that i wished that it more fully explained the whole time travel aspect of the story but the way that the story was told left a lot to the imagination and that is a very good thing because it is fun to think and figure things out instead of being spoonfed everything by annoyingly pretentious hollywood directors.
1037;by the way, jena malone does a very good job in this movie.
1038;So in this perfectly made indie film from a fear years ago we get nothing but wonderful acting from some pretty well known stars and a perfect script as well as some good affects for the film only being shot for like 4 million.
1039;This is one of those films where its fun to talk to someone about what you think it's really about and what's going on.
1040;And the soundtrack is awesome as well.
1041;is fascinating to watch, yet completely convincing as one of those slow.
1042;The ending is satisfyingly head.
1043;"bending plot twists that fans of ""Jacob's Ladder"" may appreciate."
1044;the beginning of the film is exquisite, a terrific combination of character introductions and seething dread.
1045;Such moments provide a terrific amount of underlying dread, that which perhaps causes one's expectations to elevate.
1046;Donnie, however, is told by his new imaginary friend that there is a window of 28 days, after which the world as he knows it will come to an end.
1047;interesting beginning, and certainly enticing enough to wet one's appetite for more.
1048;crowded blender of potential ideas.
1049;Despite my increasing frustrations with the material's lack of coherence, I found myself strangely entranced by it, blinded by my hope that something would eventually tie things together.
1050;the film has a good cast in its favor, though one has to wonder how hard it is for Gyllenhaal to stare dismally into space and look continuously glum and despondent.
1051;The music has been changed and moved around.
1052;It tells you more, answers more questions.
1053;i love this film, but I am rather dissapointed with the Director's Cut.
1054;This film is a wonder.
1055;For one that came and went in a flash from the theaters, its word of mouth and its adoration by most viewers and reviewers is amazing.
1056;The characters and the actors who play them are wonderful.
1057;Gyllenhaal is amazing in this and his perfomance invites you to join him on his journey and share his confusion, fear, wonder, angst, lust,and sense romance.
1058;Beautiful filmed and directed This is a classic that slipped through the cracks before it was really discovered.
1059;I liked this much better.
1060;It's just better, that's all.
1061;telling, the pacing, the visuals, the music, they all contribute to a better viewing experience in this director's cut.
1062;"the bonus disc has good features and the short about the #1 fan is hilarious in an ""I'm gonna kill John Lennon"" kind of way."

1067;DD is an acid trip, in the most poignant sense of the word.
1068;bear in mind, I rated this movie five.
1069;If it's just okay, it's good.
1070;If it's good, it's great.
1071;If it's great, it's a classic piece of art that dwarfs all things in its presences.
1072;all of the performances, both from the veteran actors, of which there are a few, and the newcomers, of which there are also quite a few, are very well.
1073;It's really surprising to me that this wasn't a big movie, propelling Jake to stardom (sure, he's popular, and he got to go out with Kirsten Dunst, but he's no A. lister).
1074;it's very surprising that this was the writer/director's first film, as every piece of dialogue, and every camera angle seems like it came from the hands of a pro.
1075;in the end, I highly recommend this movie.
1076;It is a great film, a thing that young aspiring directors may look to in the future for inspiration.
1077;So, in conclusion, people, watch it, enjoy it, but please don't take it too seriously!
1078;Amazing film, esp the director's cut!

1082;cutter teen comedies a dime a dozen, this film manages to combine realistic and empathetic teen characters, an intriguing science fiction premise, black comedy, and just plain weirdness to create a startlingly original film.
1083;Jake Gyllenhaal is terrific as Donnie Darko, a highly intelligent and mentally ill young man who is perceptive enough to see through the phoniness of many of the adults around him, but still vulnerable and awkard in the endearing way teenagers are.

1093;but look at what they did with PSYCYO/BR, a very old Movie: Just Great!
1094;Donnie Darko is one F'ed up movie, but in a good way.
1095;the movie gives the viewer humor, horror, teen angst, family drama, psychological thriller and sci.
1096;fi rolled into one and remains fun to watch and interesting which is the feat, I think, that makes it as popular as it is.
1097;Donnie, the perfectly cast Jake Gyllenhaal, is a darkly troubled teen that is either, crazy, a genius or a cog in a universal scheme that has the power to save the world.
1098;"I do know that even if the director's cut is ""easier"" it is still one of the most thought provoking and intelligent movies around."
1099;fi but it has so many elements that it really defies that simple tag.
1100;Watch it and enjoy the ride.
1101;for instance, the scenes with Donnie carving pumpkins with his sister and her attempt to help him, and his heart.
1102;heart with his Dad, were very well.
1103;the scene with Elizabeth on the phone gives us way too great a clue toward one of the big surprises later in the film.
1104;Enjoy the very many good things it has to offer.
1105;I don't think that the theatrical release of this movie is superior to the director's cut but they're both pretty good.
1106;In an age of formulaic movies and action blockbusters that were getting worse and more numerous with every passing year, this was a welcome change.
1107;It's a lovely film that I can watch over and over.
1108;If you liked Heathers, Brazil, or Edward Scissorhands, you will love this movie.
1109;The entire cast is fantastic (except for Drew Barrymore, but we can forgive her since she executive produced the movie), the soundtrack is wonderful, the effects are beautiful for a movie that didn't cost much by Hollywood standards to make.
1110;This is a cult fave in the making.
1111;com) rank the movie among the 100 greatest films ever made.
1112;I never knew it existed, and as I read the summary, I knew I had to see it.
1113;Sounds right up my alley.
1114;so, I went into the film with high expectations.
1115;And it's one of IMDb's top 100 films?
1116;He lifts himself up, then smiles at the mountain tops in front of him.
1117;perhaps the most interesting aspect of the movie is the growing tension in every scene.
1118;To see the characters develop around this growing tension, is what caused everything to have some sort of meaning.
1119;It's on a whole other level of emotion, one which penetrates you, and scares you in an emotional way.
1120;It's a universal film, one that speaks of the corruption seen in our everyday society.
1121;but in a good way.
1122;fi Thriller that will entertain you, look elsewhere.
1123;Not saying that it is not entertaining, it's amazingly entertaining.
1124;Never have I seen such creativity and imagination in a film, nor have I ever been so amazed by a piece of cinema.
1125;Dare I say that this film is the most amazing I have ever come across?
1126;review of the Director's Cut:I gave the original release five stars, and is quite possibly my favorite film, right up there with EOE.
1127;A very cool shot of Donnie with his axe, smiling into the camera.
1128;The discs are the same covers as the slip covers, which actually look very nice.
1129;You get a very insightful, and funny, commentary with Richard Kelly and Kevin Smith.
1130;That alone is worth the money, and I see myself watching it again in the future.
1131;"There is a very entertaining documentary on ""The #1 Darko Fan"" which is either a very funny parody, or a very sad true story."
1132;there's a theatrical trailer, which is the Director's Cut trailer.
1133;The original trailer, man, I hate it so much.
1134;There's also a documentary from the UK on the cult of Darko, which both provides a very cool look at the fans and Frank in alot of odd situations, that make it somehow creepy.
1135;movie Picture:The movie never did look very well.
1136;There's more background noise, easily noticed in class scenes and outside shots.
1137;Frank's voice never sounded so good, and pretty much everything is heard better than before.
1138;movie Review:On one hand, the cut scenes added alot to the film, and made it pace alot better.
1139;It added awhole lot to Donnie himself, as we learn more about him and the people around him.
1140;"One of my favorite lines in the film, Frank saying ""I'm so sorry."""
1141;I mean, if you know the meaning of the film, it's such an emotional statement.
1142;Half the fun of the first film was not knowing what was going on by the end.
1143;Those really added to the film, and now the film loses a whole lot of it's suspense because of it.
1144;The special features and commentary are worth it alone, and me being such a fan, I will keep this no matter what I think of the new cut.
1145;The film is still good, but not great.
1146;the Director's Cut gets Three and a Half stars, and the original gets five.
1147;One of my personal favorites, and it's sincerely a cult classic.
1148;This is chock full of special features, and a very insightful commentary with the Director Richard Kelly and the lead Jake Gyllenhaal.
1149;p. s I recommend checking out the #1 fan Darkomentary.
1150;Give it a chance at home.
1151;Great acting, music and storyline.
1152;This is a good example of a modern expressionist film.
1153;A clever film would be one that has an overall conceptual or narrative hook that keeps all spectators on the same page.
1154;This movie it worth a shot if you haven't seen it, but I suggest starting with the theatrical version.
1155;I much prefer the original.
1156;Otherwise it is the same movie with a few extra scenes and extra sci.
1157;This is an excellent movie which sort of defies classification: thriller, mystery, sci.
1158;It is just so beautiful.

1161;28 years old) is able to create which alternately gets you laughing, thinking, or just sends chills up and down your spine.
1162;The plot is mind blowing, really really mind blowing.
1163;The experience watching this movie is one of the most gratifying experiences I have ever felt.
1164;And even if you didn't get the ending, you can't but help enjoy the creepy atmosphere which runs through this film.
1165;The director's cut, as always, is so much better than any other version.
1166;but it was good sort of wiped out.
1167;anyway, if you open to something weerd and your smart enough not to just dismiss this movie as utter confusion then this will be one of yur favorite movies ever.
1168;This is one of the most hypnotic movies I've have ever seen.
1169;It is movies like this that make life worth living!
1170;The actors really carry this film, doing their best with what little plot there is to it.
1171;This is one of the most breathtaking movies I've ever seen.
1172;The cinematography and the actors' performances were superb (especially Jake Gyllenhaal, who ought to be nominated for an Oscar).

1177;richard Kelly is so amazingly creative!!!
1178;While this movie is not violent like Pulp Fiction, it's screenplay is just as original.
1179;It is now my favorite movie.
1180;This film is one of the select few that really moved me and made me think and was also very intensly entertaining.
1181;I do often like to laugh, and did find myself laughing a few times at this movie, but it is so original> It's a beautiful story that is told through Donnie's mind.
1182;secondly, the acting is brilliant.
1183;"Jake Gyllenhaal, also of the moronic ""Bubble Boy"", is utterly amazing and so in tune to his character, Donnie Darko."
1184;Donnie is, however, a good person, and Jake makes him seem so real and true.
1185;I pay a great deal of attention to what the characters say and do in movies, and I think that Donnie Darko is one of the greatest characters ever written.
1186;Sure he may have some emotional problems, but he is a nice guy who in some respect is willing to do anything for someone he loves.
1187;I have never particularly liked her as an actress.
1188;She was born into an acting family, and I think it is the name that has gotten her into films.
1189;She is the executive producer of Donnie Darko, and I think that they just gave her a role in this because of that reason.
1190;She plays Donnie's English teacher, and while her acting is pretty bad, the character is one that Donnie actually appreciates and to some extent admires.
1191;She is very good in this and convincing as the mother who feels as if she hasn't done a good job as mother to Donnie.
1192;She takes the role seriously, and plays it very well yet subdued.
1193;no real other names stick out for me in the acting category, but all of the actors and actresses are all very good in this.
1194;my other reason this is a favorite of mine is that it is set in the 1980's, which is my generation.
1195;I was in junior high and high school then and this brings back great memories for me.
1196;the main reason I call this favorite is because of it's originality and it's message.
1197;I paid very close attention to Donnie and what he says throughout the film, and I found the message to be a bit complex and hard to understand what was going on until the end.
1198;That is all I will say.
1199;one really must take this movie with a complete open mind.
1200;this is a sad, demented at times, powerful, and thought provoking film that was so overlooked while in theaters.
1201;I, myself, like to watch with the commentary on after viewing the movie as it brings me into a deeper understanding of what the filmmaker was trying to accomplish.
1202;Donnie Darko is an extremely original and thought provoking film.
1203;It's a wild ride through the teenage mind of Donnie Darko.
1204;Jake Gyllenhaal shines in this film.
1205;He is funny and all though he has psycilogical problems he seems like the wierd neighbor next.
1206;this movie will change your life, it makes you think of the meaning of life and death.
1207;Being full of a deep subject you would think that this film would be too dark, but Richard Kelly does a great job mixing in comedy with tradgedy.
1208;The lines are witty and fun.
1209;The young stars are all up and coming, Maggie Gyllenhaal shines as the very believable sister.
1210;And Jena Malone is the caring, kind, and slightly problematic girl friend.
1211;I love collecting the FYE collectors tins, and the very rare Hot Topic ones as well.
1212;I love it, and I would strongly recommend it.
1213;This is film that you must come at with a very open mind, if you dont you will hate it.
1214;This movie gets better every time you watch it.
1215;Jake Gyllenhaal is superb in this film.
1216;The music, the story, everything about this film has cult classic written all over it.
1217;It really captures the time, and is highly entertaining.
1218;Some people don't think the Director's Cut adds much, but I think it adds a whole lot.
1219;It's written and directed by newcomer Richard Kelly, who has also written the upcoming film Domino.
1220;the dialogue in this film is smart and intriguing.
1221;The Director's Cut gives you more of a feeling that every single scene matters, and it does.
1222;I bought it about a year ago, after reading that my favorite celeb likes it and seeing the high IMDB rating.
1223;I give this movie 5 stars because it is original.
1224;I think that this film was wonderfully directed,not perfect, but great.
1225;I believe that Jake Gyllenhaal is an adorable and talented actor, sometimes I watch this movie to see his work.
1226;I recommend Donnie Darko for those who are dreamers.
1227;but I did see the Director's Cut three times during the two weeks it played in Boston last September.
1228;First, it enhances and fleshes out what was already a wonderful troubled.

1239;This movie is by far the BEST movie I have ever seen.
1240;It is so ingeniously flawless.
1241;I would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone.
1242;if you love Donnie Darko, I recommend (for the horror buff): BloodRayne, Hostel, High Tension, Audition, anything Indie or old school.

1246;wow this movie blew me away, i saw it with a mind set that i was gonna hate but i didnt it was really good, and it had some comedy in it as well.
1247;now there are a few part that are a little cheap but its a fine damn movie.
1248;donnie darko is by far my favorite movie.
1249;provoking, intense, beautifully filmed and written, and the song mad world will be stuck in your head for days.
1250;i highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a truly original and gorgeous film experience.
1251;Very cool weird movie, always liked that type of movie.
1252;Its kind of it own concept.
1253;The extended film and bonus features create an alternate home video experience .
1254;I'm just as proud of the first cut as of this one, director Richard Kelly says.
1255;He likens the new film to a remixed record.
1256;Wise guy director Kevin Smith and Kelly keep each other amused on the commentary, with Smith occasionally playing the interviewer.
1257;(He'd be a talented journalist, it seems.)
1258;More commentators should bring along their smart friends.
1259;"He added ""comic book"" visual elements like a giant eyeball."
1260;location footage, with optional voice.
1261;"The piece tells how ""Darko"" had its first successes in London."
1262;"com found the ""No. 1 fan"" via a home."
1263;there also are a good 8.
1264;film segment and blazing trailer that makes you want to see it all again.
1265;Oh yeah, and the end of the world is near.
1266;"donnie Darko is an interesting movie, in that it refuses obstinately to fit into the mold of ""disturbed teenager"" movies ."
1267;it is almost cheerful and enthusiastic about finding comedy in the unlikeliest of places.
1268;''Donnie Darko'' is the one that got away.
1269;"But it was fun trying to land it."""
1270;Okay, I've seen a lot of movies, and this is definately up there, but I wouldn't have said that after the first time I watched it.
1271;It has time travel, violence, craziness, love, and a slew of other ideas going on.
1272;It's a very psychological movie, and is made all the better by my personal favorite actress, the beautiful Jena Malone.You might want to keep your friends out of this one.
1273;Believe me, it's worth it and you will NOT be dissappointed.
1274;I saw this movie after it was recommended that if I enjoyed Mulholland Drive I would enjoy this one.
1275;At times the movie also reminded me of American Beauty with its portrait of suburban dysfunctional family life.
1276;I thoght Jake Gyllenhaal gave a very good performance but I found his character to be somewhat creepy as well of course as the circumstances and visions that he experiences.
1277;In short if you want to watch a movie that will induce in you the urge to take tranquilizing medication, I recommend this movie.
1278;while this film is very difficult to describe, you really have to see it to enjoy it.
1279;this film captivated me from start to finish and made me pray for a sequel.
1280;"I did watch this movie again, because this movie is a ""make you think"" movie, but you can even enjoy it without completely grasping the meaning."
1281;Everything about this film is exciting and well placed.
1282;please give me more Darko.
1283;minded opinions with solid reasoning.
1284;A friend of mine suggested we watch this when invited over for a movie night.
1285;one of the BEST movies I have EVER seen.
1286;let's start off with the good.
1287;What this movie does is subtly link every event that happens and every little detail that takes place and leaves you to interpret the meaning of it all.
1288;If you want opinion, here's what I got from it .
1289;it just so happens that it surfaces and shows in Donnie.
1290;and starts to form a satirical opinion of the mechanized existence which he sees.
1291;What Donnie must now do is make a choice, a very important choice, determining the fate of humankind.
1292;this movie is right up my alley, anyway.
1293;The special effects resembled those seen in high.
1294;"The camera angles and motion techniques used by the director were breathtaking, using wide, sweeping camera angles, a camera ""one."
1295;Everyone else played the roles very convincingly except for one point, where Jake Gyllenhaal was with the character playing the psychiatrist and he was going into a panic mode .
1296;all in all, it was one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure to watch .
1297;watch it with an open mind and try to think for yourself for once.
1298;ended interpretation and how it makes you feel when it forces you to think, you will realize what a great movie it is and the positive connotation of it.
1299;everyone is going insane about it.
1300;The 10th anniversary edition has an extended viewing option and has additional information while viewing the movie .
1301;I absolutely love the hypnotic feel and rabbit trails writer.
1302;director Richard Kelly takes us on in this wonderful, thrilling movie.
1303;The all start cast and amazing set design make this a truly engaging movie.
1304;The story is brilliant, although it isn't spoon fed to you.
1305;That's what's so great about it!
1306;DONNIE DARKO, is by far one of the most original sci.
1307;You will want to watch it often as each viewing brings new revelations.
1308;Let's go make a movie on the seat of our pants.
1309;Donnie Darko is one of the most original and compelling films ever made.
1310;I give the movie a firm 5 stars.
1311;noir with very interesting characters and superb acting by the entire cast.
1312;edited, and again, I prefer the original.
1313;"The excerpts from the ""Philosophy of Time Travel"" book is a nice change though."
1314;I just have one simple piece of advice for you.
1315;the director cut adds these book passages which will completely change your idea of what is going on.
1316;Go figure then that the movie is one of the more original, thought provoking contributions to cinema in recent memory.
1317;what makes this film so engrossing is the effective balance that is achieved between the more technical aspects of the film and the story itself.
1318;technically, this movie is wonderful.
1319;The lighting, the camera work, the pacing, etc all fit the movie perfectly.
1320;Also, the use of music is done quite well as it adds to the mood of the picture and does not distract.
1321;The script is also a triumph, which is noteworthy given that the film does tend to ebb and flow, 'changing' from 80's teen flick, to horror, to dark comedy, and back again.
1322;The casting is spot on as well.
1323;Patrick Swayze finally has a career.
1324;defining role and Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect in the title role.
1325;But, the way the pieces fit together (and they really do) and the shear originality of it all make it work.
1326;Sure, certain aspects of the movie may seem familiar, but whole of the movie is original.
1327;This a great movie, one of those that will blow you away and have you thinkign about it long after the credits roll.
1328;I did that and had a rewarding experience.
1329;I kept coming back to 'equilibrium' for the drama and the fantastic story line.
1330;I suddenly found myself on a quest to understand this movie.
1331;I highly recommend this movie and if you figure it out, please let me know.
1332;this film has some incredible acting and superb writing.
1333;this is essentially a scifi movie with insightful protrayal of our society.
1334;Donnie Darko is, quite simply, one of the most unique and thought.
1335;And therein lies the very goal of the film: to weave a tale that is so multi.
1336;the role of Donnie Darko is brilliantly acted by Jake Gyllenhaal.
1337;He completely transforms himself into the title role of Donnie.
1338;His sister (in the movie and in real life) is played by the delightful Maggie Gyllenhaal.
1339;"The film opens with Donnie being found ""asleep"" on a golf course."
1340;Patrick Swayze's performance as a self.
1341;help guru selling simplistic solutions (think Tony Robbins with a very, very dark side) shows the man's incredible versatility and his ability to commit to a role.
1342;Throughout the movie, constantly brilliant dialogue is intertwined with a soundtrack of 80's era pop that sets the scene perfectly.
1343;The Director's Cut restores some critical footage to the film, footage that helps flesh out some aspects of the story while also opening up other avenues for thinking about the story and its meaning.
1344;"Bonus features include a ""Darkomentary"" about the cult following the film has garnered, that is quite an interesting watch as well."
1345;That is very far from the truth.
1346;Every song rings true of the eighties and is selected for a reason.
1347;Every song played in the movie is perfectly placed.
1348;Great suspense movie, not at all predictable.
1349;and that's the worst news, because this film is really good.
1350;"part ""The World According to Garp,"" part ""Evil Dead,"" and part ""American Beauty"" this film is really indescribable in the best sense of the word."
1351;Darko makes me think that I caught a conversation in the middle without knowing the beginning or end.
1352;I finally got my hands on this film after reading all the reviews here.
1353;That being said, it does draw you in with it's moody, matter of fact storytelling.
1354;Definitely includes great 80's song choices, and a beautiful score.
1355;I guarantee the film raises more questions than it answers, so it won't appeal to action fans or those who prefer a tidy ending.
1356;Otherwise if you like films that leave you wondering about things in general afterwards, this comes highly recommended!
1357;see for anyone, featuring the gorgeous Gyllenhaals, Jena Malone, Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle.
1358;It has a dream cast, amazing plot, and perfect script.
1359;"The actual movie is undescribably mindblowing
1360;I stopped watching Hollywood movies a good while back, with the occasional exception, and this, though not Hollywoodian, was refreshing.
1361;You can do your own analysis, think out your own theory and it will be good in a sense.
1362;(I still see the 'moviestar' no matter what)The expression that seems carved in Donnie's face is something worth alone to watch the movie for in my humble opinion.
1363;Most are worth it, and in general not 'regular'.
1364;Black cat White cat (serbo.
1365;utterly poetic,this movie demands thought and critique from its viewers.
1366;it has helped me to become more confident in my endeavors.
1367;The song mad world by gary jules at the end was put into that scene perfectly.
1368;If you want a sense of thinking about death annd taking opprotunities you'd enjoy this film.
1369;The young Richard Kelly, director of this film, graduated from USC Film School in 1997.
1370;He has spun a dark multi.
1371;layered vision, part dramatic comedy, part science fiction, part fantasy and allegory.
1372;It is, in part, a story of adolescent teenae angst, the familiar turf of a John Hughes project, but actually it is more like John Hughes meets David Lynch meets Steven Spielberg.
1373;Kelly has put several interesting twists into the high school yarn.
1374;jake Gyllenhaal, from MIDNIGHT MILE OCTOBER SKY, played Donnie Darko brilliantly.
1375;An intrepid curious lad who could ask those questions very few wanted to answer.
1376;He was outspoken, outrageous, and socially boorish.
1377;Roger Ebert wrote, Donnie is appealingly smart yet sarcastic, more quixotic than eccentric, more curious than frightened.
1378;There are theories that we, as spiritual entities, can sustain more than one version of our Self in parallel dimensions similtaneously.
1379;It is an original vision, bizarre yet strangely familiar, and immediate with it's punch to the emotional gut.
1380;It is eccentric, yet appealing.
1381;This is one of the few times a movie improved by adding in the cut scenes (approximately 20 scattered additional minutes).
1382;time writer/director Richard Kelly added enhanced the movie tremendously.
1383;It's extremely mesmerizing and still popular.
1384;most have explained a large part of the premise and theories on this thought provoking, eerie and intriguing movie.
1385;fiction insect is worth seeing alone.
1386;star cast (including his real life sister Maggie as his screen sister).
1387;The movie also includes one of the best soundtracks of any movie in recent years.
1388;The movie while being a dark is shot in a kubrick.
1389;blowing, 'Donnie Darko' is, quite simply, an excellent movie.
1390;The plot is complex and engaging, with Jake Gyllenhaal as the protagonist, followed up by a cast that doesn't leave Jake holding up the movie.
1391;I saw the original version on television and it was easy to comprehend.
1392;Donnie Darko is introduced as the protagonist.
1393;I wont tell the ending for the sake of preserving it.
1394;i highly recommend this movie to those intelects who like to think about the plot, and to those who like dark comedy, and also to anyone and everyone, for this is truly not a film to be missed.
1395;One of the most surprising and memorable indie gems of the last years, Donnie Darko is a gripping and intriguing cult movie and a fine addition to the coming.
1396;But the most surprising element is that it actually suceeds at combining all that genres.
1397;a powerful experience about growing up, the building of personality, communication, schizophrenia and the frontiers between sanity and madness, Donnie Darko is a superb achievement.
1398;Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as the confused, smart and offbeat Donnie, that spends most of his time going to school and talking to a giant rabbit.
1399;richard Kelly`s debut as a director is strong and convincing, providing captivating and absorbing cinematography with an unique mood and an ethereal, oniric and dream.
1400;Delivering enough surrealistic and gothic details, Kelly truly creates a personal and identifiable style here.
1401;The haunting score also helps to keep things interesting, capturing the zeitgeist of the eighties and providing a nostalgic dark feeling (Gary Jules` song Mad World , a cover of a Tears for Fears hit, is particularly deep and compelling).
1402;Donnie Darko is an amazing cinematic experience that wisely focuses alienation in suburbia, giving a peculiar portrait of teen depression and the coming of adulthood in an original way.
1403;This is what independent cinema does better, to offer innovative perspectives about old, been.
1404;Richard Kelly`s directorial debut is one of the most interesting american movies of the last years that looks like nothing else.
1405;Funny, sad, moving, perplexing, its got it all.
1406;What an amazing beginning by Richard Kelly, I can't wait for his next film.
1407;all with a rather strange plot that keeps you entertained until the very end.
1408;i have to say that I think this one amazing, powerful little film.
1409;While I did not get every clue as to what was going on, I understood enough to see how clever this movie and story is.
1410;you will see that everything makes sense .
1411;The characters are dynamic and imperfect and very well rendered.
1412;And the tension it creates and maintains throughout is quite impressive.
1413;Donnie Darko is perhaps one of the greatest, if not the greatest, independent films in history.
1414;It really shows the true range of emotions these actors can portray without the sugar.
1415;the music and composition in this movie is excellent.
1416;richard Kelly shines as director for this film, showing a depth and creativity rarely seen in movies anymore.
1417;The success of this movie is his own doing, and hopefully Kelly will produce more films like Donnie Darko in the future.
1418;Because I didn't think Darko was all that great.
1419;I personally think this may just be the best movie about adolescence and youthful alienation ever.
1420;My friends were telling me it was an excellent movie so i decided to give it a shot.
1421;i was amazed at the acting, the storytelling, everything about this movie is amazing.
1422;the storyline is complex but, if you can understand it at the end is well worth watching the movie.
1423;its one of those you may have to watch two or three times to fully comprehend.
1424;i loved it so much that i took it to my friends house the next day and watched it again.
1425;a must see"
1426;Donnie Darko is the most ferociously independent movie i've ever seen.
1427;Everytime you will be interested and compeled.
1428;besides being an indie( which gives it atomatic respect from me) The movie has the best message of any movie ever made ( i would know since i've been through a great deal of them ).
1429;Now to actually explain the movie.
1430;Time travel, teen angst, apocalyptic visions, madness, budding sexuality and eye.
1431;"eyed viewers will spot the sly nods to Swayze's ""Footloose"" and have a good chuckle over the very unlikely double feature of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead playing with Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" playing at a near."
1432;Darko is a visually compelling feast for the senses.
1433;I've seen Donnie Darko a handful of times and it is one of the most infuential, amazing, symbolic movies I've ever seen.
1434;You have to see this movie I have the directors cut and regular version because they were both amazingly done in that the original is awesome and did some things better, but the directors cut adds some explaination that was really good, but the time travel part at the end with the grid and flashing lights didnt make much sense and kind of takes your focus off the purpose of the scene, so advantages and disadvantages in each.
1435;I watched it again with the first commentary track with the director and Jake Gyllenhaal, and all was made clear.
1436;After listening to the commentary, now I can't get the movie out of my head and I talk about it all the time.
1437;i agree with others that for a small budget, this film is shot beautifully.
1438;The acting is superb, of course, with Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle and Patrick Swayze (who all worked for pocket change, another testament to a great script), and especially newcomer Jake Gyllenhaal.
1439;"The music is great too, adding great power to some scenes similar to the soundtrack in ""Rushmore""."
1440;Before starting I want to get it clear that Donnie darko is a brilliant movie, one of my top 10 favourite.
1441;The acting is great, the story is fantastic, the script is clever and brilliant and the movie gets you to think, not only about it's own meaning, but about everything else.
1442;This movie is surreal and I enjoy watching it every single time.
1443;It's one of the best movies I've seen because it's so original and well.
1444;In all honesty I prefer the original cut with the sequence of music in that version as opposed to the director's cut with the new sequence of music and the placement of songs that they could not afford to include in the initial release.
1445;First, the soundtrack is interesting.
1446;Jake Gyllenhaal makes Donnie one of the few (almost) believable characters in the movie.
1447;Also, the concept of the plot is actually quite good.
1448;I can see how one could develop a very good story around it.
1449;Nevertheless, it is worth seeing Donnie Darko for its thought.
1450;provoking plot ideas and entertainment value.
1451;A great Echo and the Bunnymen tune is featured in the beginning of the film, har.
1452;This is a very engrossing film, well worth the 90 minutes or so of your life.
1453;"Donnie Darko is a mixture of social commentary, satire, science fiction type themes and dark drama
1454;The acting is very good as well, even Drew Barrymore's performance as the weird teacher (now THAT is truly amazing).
1455;it's a great modern fairy tale/fable and it's obvious that a lot of love and heart went into the creation of the this story.
1456;The sequence where that song is playing is just cinematically beautiful.
1457;Kelly is a natural storyteller and I'm excited to see what he comes up with next.
1458;Great movie with complex storyline.
1459;You must watch the movie alone for full enjoyment.
1460;The movie also watches like a music video(Great late 80's sound which is a very unique thing with such awkward music).
1461;The movie also has plenty of rewatchablity as I have seen it 4 times this month alone.
1462;Donnie Darko is simply one of the best movies I have ever seen, it keeps you in suspense and excitement the whole time and haunts you for days afterwards.
1463;The entire cast is actually very good, I loved the whole family and Beth Grant is perfect as the intolerable gym teacher: Kitty farmer, Patrick Swayze is also a very funny choice giving the movie an even better 80'feel.
1464;All in all it is just a very gripping, mysterious movie and the fact that it was filmed in only 28 days, the duration of the story it self is amazing.
1465;The words from one of the last songs in the movie stuck in my head and are still there: I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad, the dreams in which I am dying are the best I have ever had.
1466;I'm always up for anything that provokes thought.
1467;The original thriller Donnie Darko brilliantly tells a tale of psychosis, bravery and sacrifice, wrapped up in a story of a compelling sci.
1468;He feels he owes it to Frank, he saved his life after all.
1469;The film is imaginative, intelligent, well acted, challenging and thoroughly original.
1470;Gyllenhaal underplays Donnie's mental problems which makes it all the more unnerving and hypnotic to watch.
1471;Definitely one of my most fave movies ever!
1472;Its brilliant, captivating, and I could watch it a million times and still want to see it again!
1473;I'm in love with this movie.
1474;It's wonderfully dark and manages to be a coming of age story with intense psychodrama, but with bits of satire and irony that made it that much richer.
1475;I'm a sucker for skillful cinematography (that supports but doesn't upstage the story) and a powerful (but not overpowering) music score.
1476;This film made great use of both, which made the overall effect extra gripping.
1477;But if you are a fan of film you will enjoy it.
1478;My advice if you have not seen the film is to see it.
1479;It bears repeat viewing and will really cause you to think unlike so many generic cookie cutter movies out now.
1480;And, wow, that was a good choice.
1481;This is the most original movie EVER!!
1482;It has lots of dark humor (absolutely hilarious moments), drama, science.
1483;the movie also has great acting, notably by Jake Gylenhaal as Donnie and his dad was great also.
1484;Jena Malone also does a great job as Donnie's cute and sweet girlfriend.
1485;The movie also has stars Patrick Swayze (he was hilarious and great) and Drew Barrymore.
1486;He is visited by his imaginary rabbit reptilian, human sized friend called Frank.
1487;He talks to him, telling him to do things and about what will happen in the future.
1488;One very strange but amazing moment comes when the engine of a plane lands in Donnie's room.
1489;Donnie is bothered by some bullies at school and is very open to tell everyone what's on his mind (his teacher and a public speaker).
1490;The voice of Frank is powerful and absolutely brilliant, but the actor that carries the movie is Jake Gylenhaal.
1491;His emotions, expressions, movemets, and powerful sentences are brilliant.
1492;Everything in this movie is brilliant and the ending still has me confused and shocked.
1493;This movie is so original that you just have to be amazed and absolutely love it.
1494;And lastly, another compelling aspect of this movie is the awesome 80s pop music.
1495;It's fantastic and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie.
1496;I am a bit frightened by how much I loved this film.
1497;i have read others say they were confused by the ending, but I think the ending makes perfect sense.
1498;This strange, hypnotic film is one of the best and most original I have seen in awhile!
1499;It has a great cast, and Jake Gyllenhaal is so amazing in this haunting performance.
1500;I am a huge fan!
1501;If your not stupid, you can most likely appreciate this movie.
1502;It is in my top 10.
1503;It is a cult classic if you havn't heard.
1504;The role that Patrick was cast in seemed promising at first.
1505;In retrospect I think the best part of the whole movie is when we get to see the wall.
1506;About five minutes into the film it got interesting.
1507;This film is one of a kind, it is kind of a romantic, horror, Drama, Sci.
1508;The movie is kind of slow and confusing until the last fifteen minutes where everything starts to make sense and then the movies gets really interesting.
1509;All I know is that this movie is coming out in an extended version and i'm going to make sure I get it the first day.
1510;This movie is a psychological thriller, a mind.
1511;fiction work, and a piece of social satire all rolled into one.
1512;When it's not being creepy, it is quite often hilarious.
1513;the acting in the movie is generally pretty good.
1514;Donnie Darko was one of my favorite films of all time.
1515;This really changes the nature of the movie, as does some of the added content.
1516;The details in the plot, as well as the more rich universe the director creates build on each other to make a very deep and heavy film.
1517;I think the original is more entertaining and palatable, and it brings the films elements together in a much more emotional and cohesive way.
1518;I enjoy both, but now that I understand the richness of the plot I would probobly rather watch the original.
1519;Despite that I think the director's cut is essential to fully appreciate this movie.
1520;This film will interest those who are curious on the subject matter of time travel, alternate universe's, spiritualism and the possibility of destiny.
1521;nothing more should be disclosed about this cinematic gem, what i've given you is a thin trivial element of the plot.
1522;It's a worthy addition to any cinemaniac's collection!!!
1523;the second coming set thing's right.
1524;Good film, entertaining, although depressing.
1525;acting is good and interesting.
1526;The first time I watched this movie was about a year ago, my brother was a big fan of it, and recommended it to me.
1527;Now, after about 4 other times of watching it, it has become one of my favorite movies of all time.
1528;This movie has great dialogue, very realistic in how awkward some of the conversations are, and hilarious at times, while just weird at other times.
1529;anyway, great movie, watch it if you get a chance.
1530;Darko is a movie that will speak to an entire generation of youth and survive the test of time.
1531;that same fear that Aristotle says is so important to theater because the audience must feel as if it could happen to them just as easily as the characters.
1532;It has a lifelike ensemble of characters.
1533;of truly gifted actors giving fine performances.
1534;spirited or caricatures of real people but rather a set of people earnestly attempting to do what they feel is right.
1535;Finally, it is a film that speaks directly and unflinchingly at the confusion of teenagers but still gives them a sense of something to believe in and the necessity for personal achievement.
1536;Kelly is deadly accurate in his many portrayals and the relevance to youth in this decade is still sharp.
1537;age elements of this movie, it shares some of the most similarities with some striking films involving romance and the chronic pathos of life.
1538;For example, the movie Happy Accidents starring Vincent D'Onofrio has thrilled many a romantic audience despite its speculative elements and those people would probably find a great deal of merit here and vice.
1539;These are all movies that speak to life in the most important ways and we should not ignore them.
1540;The movie's images have long stayed in my mind ever since viewing it over a week ago and I can feel as if it happened in real time.
1541;stop ride wishing it to never end, the movements the words, the music everything was beautifully pieced together to create a beautiful film.
1542;Jake Gyllenhal is incredible as Donnie, it makes one believe as if his character is so real, as if he actually existed in our world and so watching it to the very end it really made me feel this love for him that I didn't want him to go as he did towards the end.you need to see this film to better get an idea as to why I am saying this.
1543;The movie has so many wonderful moments that its hard to pick just one, but if I had to its got to be the last frame of Donnie and his facial expression that god if you really pay attention throughout the movie you finally put the last piece of the puzzle together and you understand that moment and why its the connector of the film from start to finish.
1544;I admit I see that scene and feel that there could be a final justice to this life on earth and maybe there could be something greater in the end.
1545;The 80s music is beyond any affection its like an addiction that you want to long for that simple time where music was so fun and original.
1546;Every frame of the movie is a masterpiece, a dark masterpiece, I recommend this movie be viewed by every physics class either high school or university it does not matter, this movie is beyond anything ever imaginable.
1547;This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while.
1548;In addition to the palpably dark and eerie atmosphere that pervades the whole movie, it is one of the more accurate depictions of teen angst ever committed to film"
1549;A second viewing of the movie with the audio commentary by Jake Gyllenhaal and Richard Kelly is also very worthwhile.
1550;fi movie, it comes across as more of a supernatural/psychological thriller, and an intelligent one to boot.
1551;Also, as many people have commented, the casting and performances are inspired.
1552;The darkly ambient soundtrack is brilliant, as well (even without the pop songs that were too expensive to license for the OST album), and the creepy cover of Tears for Fears' Mad World is just amazing in the context of the film.
1553;Also, I'm not much of a Drew Barrymore fan, but praise should go to her for championing this project as an executive producer, and for providing an interesting portrayal of a progressive and idealistic young teacher trying to bring some enlightenment to a conservative private school.
1554;I know there may be lots of interpretations about this film, but to me there is a huge depth hidden beneath the surface, like an iceberg, that finally strikes your mind.
1555;one has to watch the film to the very end to understand its sense, to face as well that the end is completely open to interpretation, which is a curious paradox.
1556;jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Donnie is superb, so are the rest of the casting, perfect in their roles.
1557;Plus the music is excellent.
1558;in short, this is a true masterpiece that makes you think.
1559;"What you have to understand is that the director, Richard Kelly, considers this a ""remix"" version of the film, not a ""replacement"" version."
1560;And there is one relationship between two characters that I don't think anyone but Kelly got until now.
1561;it is a smart movie, and just when you think you know what's going on, you don't (a common thing in films these days that just happens to work really well with the story).
1562;Acting is right on the nail, Jake Gyllenhall is incredible as usual and Drew is fine.
1563;Directing is great, and very unique.
1564;The music is errie, and sets the atmosphere perfect.
1565;There are so many plot twists, sub.
1566;The story is great, it oozes 80s and captures that time.
1567;There's so many genres floating around in it too.
1568;It can be laugh out loud funny at times, creepy, dramatic, horror, sci.
1569;This movie is so well done on so many levels, and that's why it works.
1570;"It suffices to say that this is a ""must see"" film."
1571;Yes, it has great depth, but I don't think I would want to watch it over and over.
1572;there was a perfect soundtrack and a bizarre 6 foot bunny to watch out for.
1573;the mad mad world song at the end wrapped things up wonderfully.
1574;i thought it was insanely funny that patrick swayze would take a part in the movie as he did but i don't want to spoil it.
1575;the entire cast did an amazing job of maintaining a real family feeling.
1576;overall, great movie if you are ready to see something more than once to attempt to understand it.
1577;But personally I love the way it works out.
1578;Visually the film is stunning.
1579;Filmed with very subtle camera moves and bright, yet wet looking colors it creates a perfect atmosphere.
1580;Everything looks normal, but it carries a slightly eerie feel to it.
1581;As far as acting goes, Gyllenhaal is fantastic as the lead.
1582;The rest of the cast is very good as well, although I'll never be a big fan of Drew Barrymore.
1583;The movie seems very real.
1584;The film is very reminiscent of the real world.
1585;THer is no straightout comedy or action, but the film is funny at times and is often exciting.
1586;However if you enjoy having to think about your movies, or jsut strange movies in general, Donnie Darko is a great pick.
1587;Darko is excellence in cinema.
1588;Just as good as I remembered to movie was.
1589;I definitely recommend this to any fan of cerebral films with dark humor
1590;Similar to a conceptual painting, viewing this movie takes an incredible amount of intimate focus.
1591;One must concentrate, evaluate, love, trust, and solve the many mysteries of the characters and goals.
1592;"Truely unique, you slowly start to comprehend Donnie and his situation (i liked the comparisons to ""catcher in the rye"")."
1593;I hope to see this new generation of film making in the future.
1594;As a senior in highschool i will hope to show this film to as many friends as possible.
1595;Contains all the aspects of a good movie, deep, humorous, dark, creepy, clever.
1596;Very good story, great ending.
1597;in conclusion, a must have film, either way.
1598;Very intriguing film, however don't be fooled by its science.
1599;Although detailed, it uses a sort of alternate universe to describe a lot of its plot.
1600;Despite being a cult favorite, its still a breath of fresh air compared to most movies.
1601;I highly recommend this film to anyone who's bored with most modern 2 hr sits on the couch.
1602;I've done everything I can to spread the word of this great movie.
1603;nearly everyone I meet I recommend this to.
1604;It is simply brilliant Science Fiction.
1605;All I can say about it is that if you love yourself, go see this movie.
1606;Good acting abounds from a great cast, filled with dark humor, smart dialog, and the end is something you'll be contemplating for hours after watching this film.
1607;"It does lack the visceral images of violence, sex, and general complex ambiguities of the best surrealistic Lynch, like ""Mulholland Drive, ""Lost Highway,"" and ""Twin Peaks,"" or the memorable characters and dialog from Lynch's, ""Wild at Heart,"" but never the less, a very good film in the head games department.3 1/2 stars = Very Good"
1608;The end is so intense and keeps you thinking.
1609;It's funny too see at first, but after a moment you also realize it's pretty creepy.
1610;It does come to a definitve conclusion, one that actually pretty much brings you back to it's starting point.
1611;okay, you just have to see it to appreciate it.
1612;It's a film that makes you think about what you just saw and what the meaning of it all was.
1613;The acting is great throughout.
1614;"after viewing it for the first time, you'll probably do as I did and start combing the Internet for the book ""The Philosophy of Time."""
1615;"They add more substance to the whole ""Darko"" experience."
1616;One of the best films of the past decade has been made even better.
1617;The added scenes also explore more of the family relationships and add a greater degree of humanity and humor to the film.
1618;Highly recommended, even if you already own the original cut.
1619;A job VERY well done.
1620;This is an extraordinary movie.
1621;It is completely original and absolutely stunning.
1622;I loved every minute of this film.
1623;This movie really really gets you to think.
1624;I definetely recommend that everyone at least give this movie a view once.
1625;I can gurantee all of you that you will find something that you will enjoy in this movie.
1626;up This film hides its great sophistication.
1627;Its not till the movie ends that you realize just how wonderful this movie is.
1628;Donnie goes through the film affecting charectars one way or another which all ties together in the end.
1629;The ending is one of the best film endings ever and is well worth whatching over and over.
1630;jake Gyllenhaal gives a spectacular preformance he keeps his charectar restrained and makes you believe this guy is insane.
1631;The rest of the cast does an excellent Job.
1632;That's what you'll be thinking while you watch this film.
1633;Donnie Darko is the best movie you've never heard about.
1634;But nicely done, keeping your interest and making you wonder where things are going and what will happen next.
1635;"Jake Gyllenhaal is cute and pensive
1636;I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie, being a bit skeptical given the general description.
1637;Jake G. does a great job, as does the supporting cast.
1638;The screenplay was very tightly written, with few (any?)
1639;In the end, everything ties together very nicely.
1640;This is a great movie.
1641;I like watching it over and over again because it's so good.
1642;Putting aside the eye candy of the last few years, Donnie Darko is truly the first 21st Century cinema.
1643;Best movive of that year.
1644;i have to say, when I read the back of the blockbuster explaining the movie, I didnt have high expectations, a big rabbit and the relationship betwene the rabit, time and this kid.
1645;pretty deep plot, keeps you guessing right up to the end.
1646;FANTASTIC and will always be one of my very high favourites.
1647;Great story, great acting, weird writing, but overall it's pretty trippy.
1648;Recommend to a friend who likes sci.
1649;This is a brilliant work of art that leaves you thinking about the movie long after its ending.
1650;One of my personal favorites.
1651;Watching this version made me realize what made the orignal so good: the subtelty, the things left to the imagination.
1652;The ambiguity made the film more powerful, for me.
1653;This is why Hitchcock films were great.
1654;The viewer's mind is much more powerful than anything on the screen could ever be.
1655;That way people new to the film can see the differences.
1656;if you liked the original version, you will probably appreciate the things that are revealed in the director's cut as new insights.
1657;The time travel stuff is explained a bit more.
1658;This film is undoubtedly one of my favourite films of all time.
1659;what with the brilliant acting, witty and clever dialogue, intriguing plot and magnificant musical score it's hard to fathom how someone could dislike this film.
1660;At the heart of the film's brilliance is its open.
1661;And it is, as others have said, a film that you will either love or hate.
1662;If you generally like films that have a discernable plot and comprehensible conclusion it is likely that you will dislike this film.
1663;It is, quite simply, brilliant.
1664;I absolutely love the symbolism used in this very original movie.
1665;A large person, who represents an angel of God, dresses in a large bunny suit and informs Donny of when his world will end, though the movie portrays it to be the whole world.
1666;Jim Cunningham, a motivational speaker, draws a deranged belief that all things come from the emotions of fear and love, the basic principles of Christianity.
1667;This movie will make you think about the messages portrayed in it and what it truly means.
1668;This movie takes your emotions on a fulfilling roller.
1669;It makes you wonder, then laugh, then tense in fear, then cry, then put a satisfied smile on your face, only to repeat the process a few more times.
1670;when I finished watching the movie the first time, my first thought was Watch it again!
1671;The movie gives you just enough to make you satisfied, but holds back just enough to make you think about it for days.
1672;the movie is put together so convincingly that it makes you feel like you live with Donnie.
1673;Once you have fully enjoyed it, you feel the need to say Hey!
1674;Jacob's Ladder has affected many directors and writers, and you will see what I mean once you watch it.
1675;this is seriously original, smart, and entertaining.
1676;i definatly recommend everyone at least give this movie a shot.
1677;I was having dinner with some friends about 6 months ago and our conversation somehow became about time travel and parallel realities.
1678;They handed me the movie and told me to check it out, that it is probably something I would enjoy.
1679;I graciously accepted it and when I got home I put it in a drawer.
1680;What a brilliant thought provoking movie.
1681;Great acting, wonderful soundtrack, and a plot that makes you want to watch it again and again (which I did) to keep uncovering new things that you may have missed.
1682;i recently saw the original and enjoyed that as well.
1683;I think it compliments the directors cut nicely and I hope everyone will experience both versions.
1684;The original is a bit more mysterious as you don't have the clues from Roberta Sparrow's book and a few more defining scenes.
1685;Both will leave you with unanswered questions.
1686;And when you wake from a vivid dream .
1687;Especially Frank touching his right eye and Patrick Swayze grieving for all the evil he has done.
1688;cellar Door has become one of my favorite sounding phrases.
1689;This film is truly one of the most original films ever with an incredible story by the director/writer Richard Kelly.
1690;Donnie Darko is a flawless film which is rare to find in movies.
1691;This is one of the most original movies i have ever seen and i wish i could have seen it in the theatres!
1692;The whole cast does an excellant job along with excelant direction and haunting music.
1693;I also love the 80's feel to it.
1694;if you have not seen this movie do yourself a favor and watch it!
1695;A beautiful, haunting and orgingal movie that will leave you speechless!
1696;I remember watching this movie when it first came out on the theaters in 2001 and I was very moved by it.
1697;I moved to England in 2004 and the movie was a huge cult success.
1698;It obviously got there much later as most movies do, but it put the movie into the spotlight.
1699;Good performances, great soundtrack, original and remarkable script make this movie one of the most representative of its decade.
1700;The special features have this Donaldson character who is elected as The number one fan of the movie.
1701;he is quite creepy and funny at the same time, seeing him kissing Richard Kelly and freaking everyone he meets out is pretty amusing.
1702;Like any great artist, he recognized those who have come before him and knows that art builds upon itself.
1703;This movie is actually just a reverse of Its a Wonderful Life meets Last Temptation of Christ.
1704;As most people do, I think this is a great movie.
1705;as far as why the movie itself is so great, it's unique, there's a lot to figure out, and many of the theoretical physics type of topics such as time travel are interesting to a lot of people anyway.
1706;But otherwise it's easily worth the $10.
1707;The movie itself is one of my favorites of all time.
1708;Donny Darko is dark, hypnotic and stimulating.
1709;A young man, living in an affluent home, is obviously mentally ill.
1710;But soon, Donny Darko is hearing voices, and seeing a frightening, adult.
1711;jake Gyllenhaal was born to play Donny.
1712;She has an incredible ability to portray two or more emotions simultaneously.
1713;The scene at the end of the film, in which she waves ambiguously and perhaps knowingly to another character, has had me thinking for days.
1714;The real star of the movie, though is the music.
1715;The health teacher worships a local self.
1716;crafted film that comes at you from everywhere and everywhen, """"Donny Darko"""" is hard to beat."""
1717;It has become one of my favorite movies of all time.
1718;First time writer and director (and hopefully not last time) Richard Kelly has created an unclassifiable movie, that truly defies description.
1719;On the grand scale, it's about choice, God, and inevitability.
1720;On a smaller scale, it's about time paradoxes, disturbed minds, and coming of age (sort of).
1721;I prefer to look at the movie on the former, but the well acted characters force me to treat the movie more personally, and involve the emotions as well as the intellect.
1722;He's a morbid person, but perceptive, and both smart and wise.
1723;Aside from the scattered main plot (which is drawn together beautifully), there are some excellent conversations and pieces of dialogue, my favorite being the discussion on the sexual habits of Smurfs.
1724;It's scenes like that that keep the movie with a lighter side.
1725;"The backdrop of the 80's (1988, namely), which is very well done, provides an excellent setting, and provides an excellent soundtrack, which consists of original music and 80's tunes, with music by ""Tears for Fears"" being the standout."
1726;"The slow, mellancholly, cover of ""Mad World"" at the end is devastating, and fits the moment so perfectly it's almost as if the song were created specifically for this movie."
1727;the acting is top notch.
1728;"Jake Gyllenhaal proves himself a fantastic actor at last, after skirting with glory in other movies, like ""October Sky."""
1729;His girlfriend (I don't know the actress) is a perfect match for him, and their relationship is heartbreaking in its content and in its context.
1730;Patrick Swayze is delicious in his role as a popular, but obviously phony, motivational speaker and writer.
1731;"Mrs. Farmer (again, I forget the name, but she's the lady who fell under the bus in ""Speed"") is an excellent uptight teacher, and gets one of my favorite lines: ""Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion!"
1732;This paragraph will have a few spoilers, so read on to the conclusion if you haven't seen it yet.
1733;The most recent time I viewed the movie (again), I picked up on the religious dimension of the film.
1734;For Donnie so loved the world that he gave himself to save Gretchen, his mother, his sister, Frank, and all the others on the plane.
1735;This movie is smart, emotionally powerful, and unbelievably original.
1736;I watched The Director's Cut, true.
1737;I had seen Jake Gyllenhaal in 2 later films and I thought he was a really good actor.
1738;The film, of course, is fantastic (both literally and figuratively), but I can't help but wonder what it would have been like without JG in it.
1739;I felt the same way about AND THEN THERE WILL BE BLOOD with the amazing Daniel Day.
1740;Jake Gyllenhaal is perfection itself in the leading role.
1741;"following (true, largely fostered by the ""official website"") has got to have something real going for it."
1742;I watched the movie twice in a row and twice the second day.
1743;this movie is the touching, sometimes comical story of Donnie Darko, a troubled teen with obvious mental issues growing up in the 1980's.
1744;I love this movie, I love the theatrical version, but I really love the Director's Cut!
1745;Like many of the movies I truly love, this one might not be for everyone.
1746;There are few stories, and it's the way they are told that make them stand out.
1747;fi, time travel movie, the open minded viewer will be deeply rewarded.
1748;Donnie eventually discovers the beauty and joy of life against inhuman odds.
1749;Life is finite, fleeting and precious, and Donnie represents those fortunate few who discover this in time to appreciate it even in complete defiance to the horrors he witnesses.
1750;It's easy to be positive when life is a bowl of cherries, but to delve into the darkness and emerge with hope takes real courage.
1751;fi, thriller, comedy, drama, is a movie that has mangaged to slip by unnoticed until just now for me.
1752;It really is an extrememly fresh appoach to an otherwise stale redundance that the movie industry is in right now.
1753;On the first appendix you will have opened a special deleted scene.
1754;i think the most stunning image is the face Frank shows Donnie Darko.
1755;Obviously a rabbit, but it takes one fascinating imagination to create such a macabre face for a rabbit.

1762;All the actors are so great.

1764;It is just so darn good.
1765;Plus there is just some truly classic American humor.
1766;I love this movie and highly recommend it.
1767;Donnie Darko is a stunning movie, complimented by a dark/eerie sense of urgency to find out what the hell is going to happen.
1768;The acting,directing,and setting was astonishing.
1769;The movie was very consistent with no gaps inbetween, yet very unique and questionable pertaining to the storyline.
1770;Ok enough of my philosophical analysis.
1771;I liked the film a lot when I first saw it, but what makes this one special (like so many others) is the way you get something new each time you see it.
1772;there are so many great things to say about the plot that it's not worth it to write.
1773;Maybe that means Kelly has created a new category.
1774;I certainly think that any movie that's hard to classify is a winner.
1775;Each play their part to perfection"
1776;They trusted the rookie director, and they were right to do so.

1779;Original and a movie that actually makes you think.5 star rating.
1780;interpretation of this movie, I think that it provides more than enough for you to come up with something on your own.
1781;Donnie Darko reflects profoundly on the state of our mainstream suburban culture in America.
1782;this movie is definitely a candidate for multiple viewings, as there is much to be discovered after the first view.
1783;Donnie Darko is beautiful, and powerful, and funny all at the same time.
1784;Though the film isn't perfect, freshman writer/director Richard Kelley delivers enough great moments to make Donnie Darko a must.
1785;i always say that I love seeing a film that shows me something new.
1786;"This film is deep and thoughtful
1787;All of the music is a perfect complement to the film's mood .
1788;Additionally, the theme song for the film is just stunning.
1789;Who would have thought a remake of the Tears For Fears song Mad World would work so well here?Jake Gyllenhaal does a fine job playing the disturbed lead character.
1790;Gyllenhaal has to play a character that is simultaneously smart, scared, and drugged.
1791;Other than Barrymore, almost all of the performances are very good.
1792;I read, I collect, I write.
1793;it truly is a comic book story.
1794;Donnie, his family, his girlfriend Gretchen, and everyone around him can feel the subtle aura of something not quite right.
1795;Each actor fit their part perfectly, and portrayed their character very well.
1796;The director, Richard Kelly, along with Jake Gyllenhaal, offer an amusing and clarifying commentary that allows for better understanding of the film.
1797;I finally checked this movie out, after hearing all the hype that's it's one of the best quirky off.
1798;It has elements of everything, and there's nothing to compare it to.
1799;I highly recommend that you watch this movie more than once, because it makes a lot more sense on repeated viewings.

1803;I loved it, and really enjoyed how it played with my mind.
1804;It is a comedy, with sci.
1805;Everything in the movie clicked just right, and watching it is always a real joy.
1806;I think personally, you have to watch the theatrical release first, and really think about it, and then watch the Directors Cut and enjoy all the added explainations.
1807;The directors cut is a much more solid movie, and everythiing is more crisp, and clear.
1808;All of the questions I was left wondering about after watching the theatrical release were answered for me in the directors cut, and that was great.
1809;Everything that is added is done so with great care, and only enhances the original film.
1810;It made a really, really good movie into a great movie.
1811;This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
1812;It has a solid story that is well written.
1813;And while your at it, if you like to argue the finer points of Quantum Theory in regards to time travel then this is an added bonus.

1816;The way that Richard Kelly renders this comic book plot however, is incredibly complex.
1817;The experience is exhilirating even after repeated viewings and the movie continues to provoke thought and debate.
1818;One thing that's not debatable"
1819;Though I appreciate the theatrical version of Donnie Darko, the cutting of the film for the big screen only manages to create questions.
1820;Here, in the director's cut, those questions are answered and our hero Donnie Darko begins to make as much sense as a born enigma might.
1821;A great movie that I can't stop raving about to my friends.
1822;this movie is so fresh and entertaining.
1823;A twisty plot, a great cast, and a killer soundtrack make for an excellent film.
1824;"If you like to watch Jay Gylenthall play the pathetic self loathing egotistical adolescent you should also check out ""The Good Girl"" with Jennifer AnnistonIt is very easy to see why this movie is popular among 15.25 year old white middle class suburban males who feel they are mentally unsuitable to live in this world yet believe they are intellectually gifted and ""special""."
1825;The movie has a beautiful aspect (especially the end).

1827;In the top 100 movies of all time in my opinion.
1828;of additional footage is being added into the film also.
1829;"Granted the extras should have been more but I've watched the ""original"" and the director's cut and the extended scenes are pretty sweet."
1830;Regardless if they were there or not this is still a great movie.
1831;What makes this movie worth it then?
1832;That you'll either love this film or you'll hate it.
1833;on the one hand this is a fabulously made flick.
1834;The characters are fantistically developed, the high schoolers take you back to your high school years and the adults show you what adulthood is all about.
1835;The audio track is flawless, sound effects fit into the puzzle just as they should, the soundtrack is fabulous (despite the fact that Donnie's little sister dances to a song (Notorius) that wasn't released until 1992).
1836;Obviously Kelly has done some Gaffer or Director of Photography work before because he has an astute sense of what angles, what shadows to employ.
1837;the acting is bitingly true.
1838;Jake Gylenhaal debuted to the limelight with October Sky very well.
1839;Jena Malone continues to show that she will someday soon be a massive star, despite her ripe young age of 16 and the rest of the supporting cast (especially Donnie's mother, who when she's on it, steals the screen) fit their characters flawlessly.
1840;so you wonder: with all these great things said, what can possibly be wrong with this film?
1841;nosed, but well intentioned young teacher.
1842;A combination of a few of them, sure.
1843;This, on one hand, is a strength.
1844;"I'd rather have a film be ambitious and scale many genres
1845;Its all about getting a second chance, and proving that, despite what other people think about you, there is good inside you.
1846;All the characters in this movie were very well developed and it seemed like Richard Kelly really put a lot of time and effort into them.
1847;But after you sit down and consider what you've seen and really ponder the movie, you will see that you have just watched one of the best non.
1848;and yet, I liked the characters.
1849;I loved it in this movie.
1850;And the 80s references were fun.
1851;Overall, a good movie that probably deserves 3 1/2 stars.
1852;also See: Run, Lola, Run (if you don't mind subtitles)
1853;This is a really deep movie, but one of Jake Gyllenhaal's greatest.
1854;So I think Jake Gyllenhaal is the greatest thing since sliced bread, and if I were a teenager, I would have posters of him plastered all over my wall.
1855;my biases aside, I think this film is absolutely terrific.
1856;It's haunting and beautifully made.
1857;Even the soundtrack enhances the film and the songs stick with you, reminding of the scenes they supported.
1858;it leaves you feeling sad and happy"
1859;i highly recommend this film.
1860;i cant begin to understand the imagery in the film but i loved it.
1861;this film is funny, no, hilarious.
1862;and the director too, i thought his direction was brilliant also.
1863;i was stunned by the beautiful images that floated across my screen and into my conscious and subconscious, b/c now i can't get it out of my head, like a good film should.
1864;This is a movie for someone who wants to see a truly independent film.
1865;It's unique examination of the perspective of a teenager who not only experiences torment but at the same time realizes his dreams.
1866;This movie is definitely worth a peek.
1867;This is one of the best movies and one of my favorite movies ever.
1868;But mainly, the story deals with a teen who seems to remind you of a certain Holden Caufield .
1869;donnie, the name of the character played by Jake G, is being stalked by a human.
1870;okay, now that we've officially got the originality factor into play, let me just say that this screenplay, the acting and the mood compel you to watch more.
1871;the musical score is amazingly fitting, and the acting .
1872;warnings to those who care .
1873;Yeah, it's one of those films.
1874;And if you're one of those A. d. d. pals, good luck, man!
1875;i think that this movie was very well made and has a well developed plot line.
1876;Regardless, it is still a good one to have in your collection, especially on Blu.
1877;He argues with his sister (played by Jake's real life sister Maggie).
1878;the strength of this movie comes from Donnie's belief in his visions.
1879;It provides motivation as well as tension throughout the movie.
1880;As an added bonus this movie is so original that we don't quite know where the movie is going.
1881;as a whole, this is a fascinating movie.
1882;It is a little confusing, but definitely worth watching.
1883;Donnie Darko is one of the best films ever created.
1884;indie films are usually always good but Donnie Darko is the lord of indie films.
1885;all I knew was that it was powerful.
1886;the soundtrack, by the way, is steller.
1887;This film is by far the best movie I have seen in years.
1888;Though hollywood is in the middle of a slump, I was greatly relieved by this intriguing, well.
1889;It is full of great acting, clever ideas, and good screenplay.
1890;This movie is a masterpiece!After 10 minutes you will either be hooked into it and enjoy the amazing ride or you will give up on it and shake your head in disbelief.
1891;well I love it!Nough said!
1892;This item arrived in pristine condition, wrapped in plastic.
1893;Started out as an underground indie film and became a cult classic.
1894;Every once and a while, we come across a movie that just sticks with us in the back of our mind.
1895;Watching Donnie transform through this movie was amazing and shwos his range as an actor.
1896;The last 10 minutes is truly thought provoking cinema.
1897;i have cable, so that is how I stumbled upon this movie.
1898;I will leave you will a few memorable quotes.
1899;donnie: Oh, I have those too.
1900;I hope that when the world comes to an end, I can breathe a sigh of relief, because there will be so much to look forward to.
1901;I really wanted this film to be a GREAT film.
1902;"And I do believe that ""Donnie Darko"" is a very good film ."
1903;The film is extremely well.
1904;And the characters and dialogue are richly drawn, and we have high school kids who actually look and act like how high school kids really look and act .
1905;a rarity in American film.
1906;he's smart, but completely self.
1907;but I personally found it to be a turn.
1908;I was fortunate enough to see the film for the first time in a theater that happened to be screening the Director's Cut .
1909;releases that I felt actually added something of substance to the original theatrical version (which I have seen subsequently), and I recommend that first.
1910;"So I discovered an interview with Kelly in which he explained that the engine was, in fact, ripped away from the body of the plane by Donnie himself, with his ""new."
1911;"found psychic powers,"" and that Donnie discovers at the climax of the film that he's a kind of superhero, replete with super."
1912;I found this to be kind of a cop.
1913;"This is for the better, since I discovered upon reading it that most, if not all of the characters in the film are being manipulated by whatever unseen forces are driving Donnie toward completing his ""mission."""
1914;I watch films to see humans reacting in human ways to human situations.
1915;Maybe Kelly is trying to say something about free will and determinism that I haven't figured out, but as it is, knowing that the characters are all being manipulated to do and say certain things, it really takes away a lot of the compelling interest in the story for me.
1916;Be sure that is doesent come threw the royal mail if you live in the U S A other than that it is a great movie
1917;Even after watching this movie twice, you'll still wonder what it's really about.
1918;donnie Darko, the character, is, undoubtedly, a very special young man.
1919;The nature of his unhappiness with the world in general is probably what most adolescents go through.
1920;Is Donnie just a suburban hoodlum, or is he a hero, or is he a pawn?It's a good story, extremely well acted, directed and shot.
1921;well, what can I say about this movie?
1922;I found it gripping, intriguing and all the other words you can find in the thesaurus that mean the same.
1923;richard Kelly is the man to thank for this.
1924;You just got to love those rookies that come out with a movie that makes you anxious to see the next one.
1925;The script is intelligent, very well thought out and terribly cryptic.
1926;"Then there's the girl, the ""love interest."""
1927;dimensional, which actually is fine by me.
1928;the film deals greatly with the subject of time travel.
1929;so, to recap: I loved the movie.
1930;I loved watching the ending and being forced to think about things.
1931;I loved learning about a new director who obviously cares about film and puts thought into his projects.
1932;What a great closing line.
1933;For the calibur of film that this is it's excellent.
1934;The performances by the cast are true to life.
1935;While the production art pics are pretty cool to look at, the production photos are pretty much screenshots from the movie, some so dark you can't even tell what they are.
1936;This brilliant film didn't make much of a splash in the U. s. when it appeared in theaters.
1937;The time travel bit is pretty well worked out, and this film would be a success purely as an SF film even if that's all it were.
1938;but it's lots of other things too: a charming late.80s period piece (with lots of music .
1939;including a gorgeous remake of Tears for Fears' 'Mad World' .
1940;That's a lot of balls to keep in the air .
1941;but, amazingly, the film succeeds in _every one_ of these aspects.
1942;"Its success is due in no small measure to the mesmerizing performance of Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead role
1943;Jena Malone, as Donnie's girlfriend Gretchen Ross, is well matched with Gyllenhaal (and this is the second time in five years that she's appeared in a movie with wormholes in it: she also played Jodie Foster's younger self in _Contact_).
1944;the rest of the cast is good too .
1945;If you're reading this page, you're surely aware that Donnie is visited by a human.
1946;I guarantee you you'll be pleasantly surprised once you actually watch it"
1947;In its way it's every bit as mind.
1948;but with a gentler, lighter touch, a fine sense of humor, and, in its way, a more hopeful message (though every bit as dark as Lynch).
1949;"If you want to see what you've been missing, grab this one while it's still available
1950;Many of the key scenes were alterd, ruining some of the best moments in the film, and the eye ball thing that was added before incounters with frank was just plain retarded.
1951;a teenage boy with paranoid delusions can see into the future.
1952;Of course that sets time back a month and everyone knows they have 30 days or so to live again.
1953;And it's got loads of great extras.
1954;You get two commentaries, both very insightful and entertaining"
1955;I have thanked that friend.
1956;donnie Darko is a beautifully directed film, with a thick storyline that is compelling and completely unpredictable.
1957;This is an incredible film and strongly suggest it to all, although some parts may disturb younger viewers, but it is amazing.
1958;i watch a lot of films, which means I now predict just about every second of each new, boringly predictable film.
1959;This movie is simply amazing, and is undoubtedly a modern cult classic that will be remembered for ages.
1960;Wel, overall, i thgought he movie was excellent.
1961;I also really enjoy a movie that makes me a think a little bit which is somewhat of a rarity in films these days.
1962;Jake Gyllenhaal, who i already think is an awesome actr and has incredible talent, played down a little to much for this role but it was still entertaining.
1963;I'll give Donnie Darkko credit for his character's challenge to the status quo of school, family and friends.
1964;There's even some humor in it.
1965;it's not just good for it's characters, cinematography, and dialogue (all of which were nicely portrayed in their simplicity), but it causes one to consider the human condition.
1966;this is a film best viewed without the threat of interruption.
1967;And a lot of extras.
1968;It's sort of dark moody with great acting by the whole cast with a very complex story.
1969;A lot of interesting cast choices in this movie.
1970;But I am glad I checked it out because it is a great movie.
1971;Jake Gyllenhall does a great job at being creepy and yet sensitive and loving, like most teenagers.
1972;It's a haunting movie and may stick with you a while.
1973;If you are a person that enjoys twist, depth, and emotion in a plot, this movie is definightly a movie to be enjoyed.
1974;It is seldom one is given a chance to appreciate something so original.
1975;Regardless of if you are a fan of Independence Day (or similar movies) you will talk about this movie.
1976;As stated in other reviews, the cinematography is outstanding and the acting is incredible.
1977;A must see for avid movie fans!!
1978;The theatrical version of Donnie Darko is one of my favorite movies of all time.
1979;I liked it so much that I went to the world premiere of the director's cut.
1980;And an important scene with Drew Barrymore was cut in half.
1981;commentary: Richard Kelly and filmmaker Kevin Smith (Clerks) talk about the changes in the director's cut and the movie's cult status.
1982;A very good and entertaining commentary, this is the best extra on the set.
1983;But the commentary with Richard and Jake Gyllenhaal is still the best of the Darko commentaries.
1984;But at the end you'll be laughing your head off.
1985;there are also storyboards and a trailer.
1986;This is a good film and Jake G. is really perfect for the role.
1987;A nice cult type movie.
1988;Plane and simple, this movie is fantastic, exciting, triply, fun, funny, clever, and more triply.
1989;"There are so many good things to say about ""Donnie Darko"" that this review could be pages long."
1990;But, first of all and most important, this is a very original, thought.
1991;elemented, fantastic characters, it grabs the viewer and tranports him to Donnie's reality without effort.
1992;travel made this movie one of the most incredible I've seen in the last decade.
1993;donnie is brilliantly played by one of the upcoming stars of the young generation of talented actors, Jake Gylenhaal.
1994;"Sleepwalking, he does ""errands"" for a fantastic figure, a giant reptile."
1995;"And this greater scheme is what is most interesting and original about ""Donnie Darko""."
1996;developed, no matter how little their on.
1997;For example: Noah Wyle's character, one of Donnie's teachers, is always eating someting, because the actor decided his character was diabetic (!)
1998;but the best thing of all in this amazing movie is the dialogue.
1999;There are many, many memorable quotes, one better than the other.
2000;There's much more to it than it seems.
2001;the soundtrack is disturbing which adds depth and beauty to a wonderfully shot film.
2002;The other additions are more effective and the sound is vastly improved over the original.
2003;The marvelously choreographed intro into the High School environment is a piece of virtuoso filmmaking.
2004;Very dark, but very interesting and entertaining plot.
2005;Drew Barrymore did an excellent job, but Jake Gyllenhaal is just awesome in his performace.
2006;Jake is truly a great actor and his performance in this movie is proof of his skill.
2007;donnie Darko has a large legion of fans and I certainly understand its appeal.
2008;The acting by both Jake Gyllenhaal and Drew Barrymore is some of their best work.
2009;The rest of the cast also shines with a special kudos to Holmes Osborne as the father in what is almost always a throw away role.
2010;and the filmmakers certainly know how to frame a shot.
2011;Oh up until the payoff it's fine enough, in fact it is better than fine.
2012;i knew pretty much nothing about it when I saw it, other than there was a guy named Frank, and my friend really liked it.
2013;This movie is the perfect mix of funny, touching, beautiful, and very meaningful.
2014;You'll probably love it anyway, and maybe you'll start to like philosophical discussion.
2015;"no matter what, this movie contains one of the funniest lines in the world: ""He asked me to forcibly insert the lifeline exercise card into my anus!"
2016;From the relationships within the family, to Frank's prophecy of doom, this is the perfect movie.
2017;The director's cut contains several sweet, funny, and informative scenes that were cut from the original.
2018;I myself found it fun to try and figure things out on my own, but i still enjoyed this version which in no way spelled it out.
2019;What can I say . . . this work is one of the most inspired and immersive I've ever seen.
2020;The performances are almost all completely flawless.
2021;The visuals are surreal in the most breathtaking and mind.
2022;in particular, the scenes in the school were most beautifully handled.
2023;All the relationships are believable.
2024;Donnie Darko is by far one of the best movies I have seen.
2025;Its one of those movies you watch, and then just want to be in a quiet state and think, think about your life.
2026;It took a trip to the U. k. to discover the merits of this mesmerizing, deeply personal film.
2027;"But what sealed my fate was hearing the hauntingly beautiful ""Mad World"" by Gary Jules."
2028;i love the film because every time I watch it, I notice something new, which causes me to engage in a whole new set of mental Olympics.
2029;And it proves true visionaries still exist.
2030;"But what's more, ""Darko"" paints a more realistic portrait of the '80s."
2031;"furthermore, ""Darko"" creates a more realistic portrait of teen angst."
2032;It represents something archetypal and deeply symbolic.
2033;This is a stunning freshman effort.
2034;"What's more the music immediately struck a chord with me as I loved Tears for Fears' superior album ""The Hurting."""
2035;Donnie Darko is, without a doubt, the most important film to come out of 2001, and will exert an influence for years to come.
2036;I got my item on time and it works great.
2037;I'm happy with the price and everything.
2038;I loved this movie from the first time i saw it.
2039;the thing about it is that it not only has a lot of action and scares within, but it makes you think beyond the actions.
2040;watch the movie, wait a week or so and think about it, come up with possibilities, then watch it again, and try to figure out the true answers.
2041;awesome movie, the new favorite
2042;Don't get me wrong, Donnie Darko is one of the great films ever, and that's no exaggeration.
2043;And this Director's Cut is even better.
2044;The Director's Cut is awesome.
2045;It adds so much more explanation to the movie than the original!
2046;This is one of those movies that simply requires a second viewing (and perhaps a third) before the true meaning can be seen clearly.
2047;This film is dark, twisted, funny, sad, well.
2048;acted, and, above all else, like nothing you've seen before, or will see again.
2049;I loved the ending, and the way that all of the characters were a touch strange.
2050;The story line, and I mentioned, takes a severe twist at the end and is complicated throughout, but you'll love it the first time, even if some things are unclear until the next.
2051;The original, more compact and eliptical, plays as a moody meditation on the omnipotent, interconnected and paranoid aspect of adolescent fantasy.
2052;"The ""smerf"" speech was the best moment in the movie and i liked how the movie it self was very humorous."
2053;All in all, a good movie but dont expect the greatest movie in al of history.
2054;donnie Darko is magnificently philosophical and beautiful.
2055;the wonderful thing about Donnie Darko is that it'll haunt you.
2056;the direction of Richard Kelly is particularly fantastic.
2057;The way he makes each scene connect with the viewer and symbolizes so many of the characters is fascinating.
2058;Donnie Darko is the cult classic that is beatifully dark and tranquilizing.
2059;The first time I saw this movie I loved it!
2060;I really enjoy movies that make you think, like Inception.
2061;The first disc is the movie, with OPTIONAL commentary, and then the second disc has bonus features that I have yet to fully check out, but I think it is exactly what I wanted and at a great price!
2062;With the dark themes and a rather odd sense of humor at times it just makes the movie all the more pleasing.
2063;It's a great movie to watch if you really want to get the wheels in your head turning.
2064;the cast was wonderfully put together with familiar stars.
2065;i'd recommend this if you are looking to start a conversation with someone on what you think the main points of the movie are and what it means to you.
2066;i would definitely put it into a category with my top 5 favorites.
2067;This is a a movie that you definitely don't want to miss.
2068;It has a deep meaningful message and such interest that you will want to watch it over and over again.
2069;i went in knowing little to nothing about this film, and that's the best way to approach it.
2070;This is the sort of brave and innovative filmmaking that makes up for all the insipid 'paint.
2071;It's this sort of film that restores your faith in cinema.
2072;one with director Richard Kelly and star Jake Gyllenhaal, another with various other cast members including Drew Barrymore and (a very subdued) Jena Malone .
2073;'Darko' fans will have great fun pouring over the other special features as well, including trailers, deleted scenes and 'The Philosophy of Time Travel.
2074;''Donnie Darko' is a cryptic, haunting gem of a movie that will stay with you long after the final credits roll.
2075;This also provides some commentary on our educational system and the inclusion of cult.
2076;I highly recommend this film to those who prefer something that is not what it seems, to those who do not judge a book by its cover.
2077;Jake goes beyond the borders of Mcguire and takes you inside the mind and through a parallel of time travel and theory, all as a highschool student.
2078;with a classic soundtrack, lighting and vivid color, camera work (pay note to a particular scene as the camera lingers the highschool halls) and cast of Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, and Patrick Swayze in the mix this film does justice to an eventual classic cult.
2079;See for yourself, through the eyes of Donnie Darko.
2080;The story itself is very original and enagaging.
2081;The cast is perfect and there is some marvelous acting throughout the picture.
2082;The visuals are simply marvelous, it is a treat for the eyes.
2083;The soundtrack is also quite excellent from 1980's pop tunes to droning ambience.
2084;I've already watched it at least 10 times and that is incredibly rare for me to do that!
2085;I loved so much about this move that I've have givein it 5 stars.
2086;Each character in this film is fresh, original and interesting to watch.
2087;So if you understand it, please, please explain it to me.
2088;I absolutely loved this movie.
2089;The music in the film is perfect.
2090;It uses just the right mix of lesser.
2091;but if you're in the mood to pay close attention and think about everything you're being shown, this is a great movie.
2092;This movie is the perfect example.
2093;One friend has even suggested that the whole story can come across possibly from Cherita Chen's point of view because of her silent affection for Donnie and the book in which his name graces the cover.
2094;i'm not one for flashing back to the 80's, but this movie reminded me of the good music that came from those years.
2095;Plus, the Bush and Dukakis presidential election debate clip along with the excellent use of Duran Duran's Notorious was an added bonus.
2096;Chut up and check it out.
2097;I really love this movie, its a great psychology flick but I have two issues, I cant get it on my mobile device, and I can only access it with an internet access.
2098;Richard Kelly (II) has done something quite unique here.
2099;"It will stay with you afterwards
2100;She's a success in her troublesome role.
2101;Many other roles are equally fascinating .
2102;Every character in this movie has something amazing going for them, and they certainly melt together beautifully in the overall context.
2103;it's also 113 minutes full of surprises.
2104;The whole plot will keep you on edge.
2105;I actually bought this without seeing the Director's Cut first, having only seen the theatrical release.
2106;Regardless, Donnie Darko is an excellent, mind.
2107;Not necessarily one to watch with the kids, but a brilliant movie, either way.
2108;His acting style suits the role perfectly.
2109;This a movie about the future, the past, and most certainly the present.
2110;The concept of time traveling through a wormhole is also a major theme here.
2111;The soundtrack, the screenplay and the dialogue all come together beautifully to make this one of my favorite all time movies.
2112;The story is complex and the movie needs to be watched several times to get everything that is thrown at you.
2113;I definitely believe that everyone should see this movie.
2114;and yet find a strange attraction to it's beautiful design.
2115;Are you fascinated by relativity, signs, kissing, and honesty.
2116;Darko explores wild variations on Dr. Hawkings theories on time in a plot.
2117;this version is a great film to both disturb and amuse with its multiple genre nature (teen drama/horror/comedy/sci.
2118;Richard Kelly is a god and I am stoked to see what he comes up with next.
2119;This was one of those rare occasions that I felt I spent time watching a movie in vain.
2120;Excellent and original storytelling along with an amazing soundtrack.
2121;Its right up there with all the best in Cult Classics!
2122;It has a man in a rabbit suit as a main character.
2123;After a few more viewings, I hope to have most of it figured out someday.
2124;I'm personally big fun of Jake and I think he has this charisma that makes you think there is something deeper than what you see.
2125;This is definitely one of my collection movies.
2126;instead of discovering that life is precious, every second of every minute is a gift and that he can touch others through his life.
2127;And the kicker to it all is.
2128;it will all make sense in the end.
2129;And then they can go around proving how smart they are that they """"get"""" the movie, that it's a masterpiece, etc. a highschool kid is given a quest to die."""
2130;A beautiful tightly woven masterpiece of a movie.
2131;The realization at the end that he was able to change the future is powerful indeed.
2132;Since I have heard nothing but good about Donnie Darko I thought I would give it a try.
2133;It communicates emotional resonance in each glimpse it gives us of the faces of any of its characters.
2134;What more do you need than The Last Temptation of Christ?I found it deeply moving, a filmic poem as alien to rational thought as is the best work by W. s. Merwin, Wallace Stevens, or even Keats.
2135;which is, after all, that each of us will die alone.
2136;This movie is a must.
2137;The story is layered, and very open to interpretation, so I'll amend my former statement by saying this: if you want everything to be resolved and clear.
2138;It's a very emotional film, touching on feelings of loneliness, love, compassion, and others.
2139;moving at times without dragging, and humor is present (plentiful, if you look hard enough) without being juvenile or infringing on the film's integrity.
2140;fi film is made even better due to wonderful cinematography and a breathtaking soundtrack.
2141;With a very dark American Beauty feel for pacing and convincing performances from sympathetic characters this film didn't make nearly enough of a splash for its major release.
2142;the subject matter of the decay of middle america, the concepts of mental illness, the stigma of life in parichial towns and the layers effects of time travel and fate carry a beautiful love story and themes of metaphysical growth and triumph.
2143;Visually appealing, cerebrally stimulating, emotionally moving, well performed and scripted.
2144;This was an enjoyable view, nearly wrapped up neatly at the end.
2145;Similar to Night Schylaman's more popular film, 'Sixth Sense', it explores Time Theories in a unique fashion.
2146;this film was a good watch, and well executed given the difficult subject.
2147;Remember those movies in lit class, where everything meant something?
2148;I think it is a great movie and could watch it once a week.
2149;It has so many nuances.
2150;I introduced them to the movie and they loved it too.
2151;I would have loved to see this film on the big screen .
2152;Nonetheless, I do think we will be seeing this film becoming a midnight classic at town theaters.
2153;It's that cult, it's that classic.
2154;First movie review I've written.
2155;It was just excellent in every way.
2156;and it was great to see Ms. Barrymore in another non.
2157;Almost as good as if i bought it brand new with the exception of knowing i bought it online, good condition and recieved in exceptional time.
2158;Donnie Darko is a truly unique film.
2159;it has the most strange, funny, wonderful, and outstanding story.
2160;Richard Kelly made his directorial debut with this excellent film.
2161;The entire mood for this film is completely outstanding.
2162;Great story line, plot, soundtrack.
2163;Plus the 1980's vintage feel gives it that extra flashback as well back to my childhood and gives it more realism and personalizes it.
2164;the movie is full of surprises you don't expect.
2165;The ending is a cult classic and watch how moralist.
2166;gets undressed later in the movie by an act of violence that offers an ironically satisfying twist.
2167;It has many themes and ideas, from teenage angst, to first love, mental illness and theories of time travel.
2168;But I will say that the film is atmospheric, and frightening in places.
2169;Extemely well acted by the entire caste with great cameos by Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze.
2170;I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys involving themselves intellectually as well as enjoying the sensation of viewing good film.
2171;This is one of the most unique movies that I have ever seen.
2172;"The script is excellent
2173;I have to watch it again but it is well worth viewing several times over alone and/or with others"
2174;I must own this movie!
2175;I feel that this movie is a cinematic masterpiece.
2176;I just love this movie.
2177;The movie is mysterious and the directors cut explains what's doing on just a little more.
2178;whereas others said it had great underlying meaning to it, and the acting was superb.
2179;i am not a real fan of surreal work, or pretentious art or directing, but this film was exceptional.
2180;the acting was brilliant, the casting perfect, the directing excellent, and the surreal moments beautifully created.
2181;"coaster ride of psychological exploration, romance and fear
2182;a superb film, and one which I can't reccomend enough
2183;I saw it on a movie channel on TV a few months ago, and i absoultely loved it.
2184;i'm into these kinds of weird, not fully advertised strange movies, so i throughly enjoyed watching it.
2185;That's the beauty of this film, because no two people are going to come to the same conclusion on what the movie is about.
2186;With brilliant direction (kudos Richard Kelly), an excellent (an extremely underrated I might add) cast of characters, and a confusing, yet beautiful story, """"Donnie Darko"""" is not just another cult film."""
2187;This is a movie that is timeless.
2188;This ultimately leads Donnie into the research of time travel and tangent universes, which becomes one of the most important aspects of the movie.
2189;That should give you a basic idea what the movie focuses around.
2190;While this might not sound like the most award winning premise, Kelly definitely turns this into one of the must see movies of our generation.
2191;There's also a sense that this alienated teenager is in the end the real hero, despite being looked down upon by his peers and his community.
2192;Part of the charm of this movie is its overwhelming honesty and portrayal of things as they are in real life, not glamoured up for hollywood.
2193;whatever Kelly's intention was when he wrote the movie (which to this day has never been clearly explained), he has made a movie that has touched and connected with a broad audience of people worldwide.
2194;I promise you will never think about things the same way as you do after viewing this film.
2195;I strongly encourage you to see this movie.
2196;It is definitely something that will stand out from anything you've ever seen.
2197;To put it simply, you must see this movie.
2198;And when the world comes to an end, I can breathe a sigh of relief, because I know I have so much to look forward to.
2199;I love the directors cut.
2200;Basically everything about this film is great.
2201;The movie is eerie, thoughtful, interesting and complimented with wonderful acting from Jake Gyllenhaal (along with the rest of the cast) and with music that seems to have been made for this story.
2202;Every time i watch it, i find something new, a new angle, and am still pondering what i believe happened and what the story is all about.
2203;The idea behind it was fairly good and for an indie movie it was fairly well done.
2204;This movie rocks my world.
2205;I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!
2206;If you enjoyed it, good for you.
2207;Cult favorite James Duval (a regular in Gregg Araki's outrageous movies) makes a cameo appearance as the object of Gyllenhaal's strange 'visions'.
2208;Fine use of the wide Panavision frame.
2209;rarely do you come across a movie like this .
2210;poetic dive through time and future events .
2211;it is like the fractal pictures .
2212;extremely original depictions of a kid going through the events of being a portal in the time loop .
2213;The name itself gives description to the movie.
2214;It's very dark and unusual, but also very good.
2215;Jake G plays his troubled character very well and definitely steals the show.
2216;You definitely have to keep an open mind to be able to enjoy this psychological thriller, but if you can do that, it's totally worth it!
2217;In my eyes, it is a beautiful work of art that never lets your mind rest.
2218;this film stimulates the mind and the soul, not to mention the tear ducts.
2219;"watching it was an emotional experience
2220;It is perfect for anybody.
2221;Donnie Darko is part science fiction, part drama, part comedy, part teen movie, part satire, its so many things in one, its hard to describe, and it can't be lumped into to one category.
2222;It is at times hilarious, to where I couldn't stop laughing, at other points, so sad I cried, and other times it had me shaking my head because it hurt trying to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.
2223;one of the best things in this film is the interplay between Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal, it is hilarious to watch them at times, and you can see the chemistry between them.
2224;help guy Patrick Swayze plays, everybody is fantastic.
2225;with a fantastic script, a great cast, and some awesome 80's music, Donnie Darko is one of the most iconic movies of the 2000's, and has stood the test of time well over the last 10yrs (1/26/13) and will continue to do so.
2226;I also got a high school diploma at 14, and started going to college at the age of 15.
2227;The first cut of this movie was great.
2228;One of my favorite films.
2229;Like I said, Im a big Donnie darko fan, I liked it before it got popular (at least in the U. s), and Im sure I'll still like it once its popularity fades.
2230;Hollywood's steady downfall into high.
2231;a completely morbid and fulfilling storyline, with dazzling presentation and a cast of amazing actors playing multi.
2232;the story revolves around the charismatic, wayward teenager, Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal).
2233;therapy sessions to handle his sleepwalking.
2234;Soon, Donnie realizes that many of his encounters with Frank, leave very real impacts on those around him.
2235;Donnie Darko is magnificant in keeping one's interest, keeping its audience in suspense and sometimes in laughter.
2236;Jake Gyllenhaal does a superb job of playing Donnie as a dark confused teenager in search of understanding and conscious, with the sexiness of Tobey Maguire but with a personality.
2237;The dynamics of family make this story seem very real and close to home, as we are not only drawn to the supernatural, but to the plight of Donnie's mother, who is desperate to guide and understand her son.
2238;the basic story, visual effects and music are simple and play well off each other.
2239;One day, film makers will try to imitate the magical properties that """"Donnie Darko"""" has captured in about two hours."""
2240;Donnie Darko is great acting, great music, and a concept that's great enough to keep you interested time after time.
2241;The acting is superb all around, as is the dialogue, which turns what could have been an over.
2242;"Jake Gyllenhaal is utterly believable as Donnie, a teen suffering from what seem to either be psychotic hallucinations or ominous visions of a six foot tall rabbit named Frank, who upon their first encounter informs him that the world will end in ""28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds""."
2243;righteousness and obliviousness by Beth Grant.
2244;With the aid of both Monnitoff and Sparrow, Donnie believes he has discovered the secret of time travel.
2245;Along with all the magnificent elements already defined, this movie features several other things for which I must commend it, the first of which is its soundtrack and score.
2246;Utilizing a combination of popular songs from the 80's and a stellar, beautiful, and melancholy score of instrumental works by composer Michael Andrews, this film is appealing on more than one level, which is more than I can say for many movies.
2247;Another thing which I must take the time to acknowledge is the extremely realistic and effective subplot involving a student named Cherita Chen (played very well by Jolene Purdy) who is teased by her classmates for being overweight and foreign.
2248;This sad scenario is all too real in many schools, and is brought into the spotlight in this movie with a haunting and sorrowful authenticity.
2249;If you haven't seen this movie yet, then by all means do so: I can honestly say that it is one of the best films I have ever seen.
2250;disc Special Edition)It's a very good experience.
2251;Donnie Darko is one of my all time favorite movies.
2252;I love every second of it.
2253;The music in the film is outstanding since it conveys the feelings and message of the characters.
2254;The disc includes deleted scenes, director commentary, trailer, tv spots.
2255;wonderful, touching, poignant and sad.
2256;this movie is absolute genius.
2257;If you enjoy movies that make you think, or movies that go beyond on ending.
2258;I'm sure you like this.
2259;This movie is an Universe in and of itself, which as you know is a what makes a classic film.
2260;No doubt that this is one of the best movies I have scene and bought in a long time.
2261;Its like a super hero or something.
2262;what makes you think i'm not?Donnie darko is stunning, amazing and original.
2263;It's a beautiful, heartfelt movie about a troubled young man who sees a giant (scary) bunny.
2264;This movie caused hours of debate between my friends and I when we first watched it.
2265;Personally I loved the feeling of things being unexplained, which Kelly tried to fix in the director's cut.
2266;There are some great additions though.
2267;So in conclusion, I recommend the movie whole.
2268;All of the other themes such as teen alienation, pop culture, etc, provide commentary on the world while at the same time working to advance the plot.
2269;It's true that Donnie Darko has one of the most intense followings a film could ever ask for.
2270;The fans of this film has dissected it from the inside out, trying to explain each and every little facet of the film.
2271;however, I find that to be the most interesting and entertaining aspect of this film.
2272;Richard Kelly wrote a brilliant script, full of true emotion and at times horror, complete with science fiction elements so strange it will be hard to wrap your brain around them if you're not entirely into this kind of film.
2273;but with the Director's Cut, we get a whole new look at the original Donnie Darko, with over twenty minutes of additional footage and a whole new soundtrack.
2274;before Bubble Boy and Brokeback Mountain, Jake Gyllenhaal established himself as an incredible actor with his portrayal of Donnie Darko.
2275;Indeed, it is the acting in this film that makes it so powerful.
2276;The interaction between the family, especially Jake and real.
2277;sister Maggie, and the dinner conversation between the two, makes you believe that these two really are siblings in the context of the film and doesn't feel like just two actors going at each other's throats.
2278;Maybe it was just the fact that they grew up together that made it so believable, but I tend to lean more towards the fact that the two were just great actors as it was, and used the influence from their lives together to craft a bond between the two characters.
2279;But there isn't really a weak actor in this film, they all do excellent in their roles, and it all just seems completely believable.
2280;the cinematography is also top notch.
2281;For a first time director, Richard Kelly really knows what he's doing and always manage to find the most beautiful and effective shots to emphasize what's going on in the scene.
2282;That's what's beautiful about this film.
2283;Even in the simplest shots, there is something special about each one that I rarely see in films.
2284;Basically, that's my only gripe about the change in score, as everything else works perfectly.
2285;if you haven't seen Donnie Darko and want a film that isn't a spoonfed 'here's what's going on' formula, do yourself a favor and see it.
2286;If you loved the original cut, chances are you'll love this one too.
2287;This is a film every should see at least one time, even if just to say you did.
2288;Great price and nice transfer with lots of extras.
2289;I assumed it included both.
2290;It's still an excellent movie though.
2291;After seeing the director's cut first and the original version of the movie second, I must say that the director's cut is a far better film.
2292;The directors cut is a far more rewarding experience than the original.
2293;The director's cut adds much more depth to the plot than in the original.
2294;"Gary Jules' ""Mad World"" is simply brilliant, which was recently used in an Xbox commercial."
2295;The soundtrack mirrors the movie extremely well, and really embodies the spirit of the movie.
2296;the existentialist concepts are thought provoking, prompting my second viewing of the film.
2297;If you haven't visited the movie's website, it's a giant game that gives background information on the movie and even offers an epilogue.
2298;overall it's an excellent movie.
2299;This is an excellent movie that has been overlooked for a long time.
2300;Even if you've seen the original, watch the director's cut, it adds the extra depth to the movie, transforming it from a great movie into a spectacular movie.
2301;This was a very good copy of the movie.
2302;The movie itself is extremely good.
2303;for now, briefly: this is a good film.
2304;The way I interpret it, Donnie is deeply sensitive, and a genius as well as a psychic.
2305;if you want to think, watch this movie.
2306;i certainly liked the ending.
2307;And of course there is always the possibility that if we want it strongly enough.
2308;and give our loves ones a second chance .
2309;This is without a doubt the best film I saw this past year.
2310;Part drama, part science fiction, part romance, part horror and part comedy.
2311;A very ambitious project and you cannot help but respect that.
2312;the story centers around a very intelligent high school student named Donnie Darko.
2313;The writing is intelligent and the direction expert.
2314;The film will challenge you to expand your mind and will stay with you for a long time.
2315;It also has a great soundtrack!
2316;Do yourself a favor and watch this film, do yourself a bigger favor and watch it twice, it will help.
2317;The film effortlessly and seamlessly combines these disparate and bizarre elements into a single whole, resulting in a very unusual and rivetting film that as I said, almost defies description.
2318;I suspect it will become a cult classic of the genre although this is one movie that will be hard to beat and really belongs in a class by itself.
2319;Definitely better than the theatrical release.
2320;good comments on the making of.
2321;This movie has moments of absolute cinematic brilliance.
2322;Calling this a great film would lead to a lot of disappointment because it has some serious flaws, not the least of which are plot contrivances that simply don't work.
2323;It is perhaps the best cinematic portrayal of a schizophrenic mind that I've ever seen, and in some ways reminded me of Polanski's Repulsion.
2324;The lovely ambiguities of the first three.
2325;(The burning down of the positive thinking guru's house is a good example.
2326;With the exception of Drew Barrymore, the performances are top knotch.
2327;Lots to savor and enjoy, even if it is a bit messy.
2328;(There should be a whole genre dedicated to movies you can never see again for the first time.)
2329;I just watched this stunning masterpiece for the first and certainly not last time.
2330;One is left without understanding but moved in every way by a movie experience, that goes far beyond what can be seen in other movies.
2331;It will be worth it.
2332;Donnie Darko can be viewed as a brilliant reinterpretation of Frank Capra's classic film: It's a Wonderful Life, since its basic theme appears to be the effect each of our lives has on society.
2333;In Donnie Darko a young and highly intelligent teenager has found a way to move forward in time so that he can experience his future and decide if he should take actions to change it.
2334;One of these is exposing the true nature of a public icon who may have molested Frank when he was a little child.
2335;It is at the point that their world seems to becoming apart that Donnie must make the same decision the protagonist in It's a Wonderful Life is faced with: would the world be better off with him alive or dead?In addition to the complex and thought provoking plot, the actors play their parts very well on a stage of superbly crafted backdrops that serve to portray an idyllic suburban milieu that is perhaps only a veneer of normality.
2336;This is one of those rare films that seems to touch the universal consciousness.
2337;This will definitely end up a cult classic.
2338;But the truth is that it is in its own little world of creativity and spookiness.
2339;What director Richard Kelly has done is taken the story of a mildly psychotic teenager caught in someone else's cycle of guilt and expiation and turned it into something that deserves cult film status if nothing else.
2340;Gyllenhaal's performance captures the inner discontinuities of a character whose world alternates clarity with hallucination, leaving us to wonder what is real and what is inadvertent juxtaposition.
2341;as a film, Donnie Darko is as deep as you want to take it in a range between pure spookiness and metaphysics.
2342;There is a lot of fine detail in the settings and scene action that only gradually sink in.
2343;This was a much more carefully made film than it appears on first contact.
2344;by all means see this for its creative adventurism if nothing else.
2345;Stay to watch it a few times and you will find it eerily optimistic despite the tragic thrust of its central story.
2346;In the end you may very well feel as happily perplexed as I did.
2347;This is now like one of my favorite movies, it has a weird storyline at first that is pretty hard to grasp, and most people won't understand it the first viewing, or maybe at all unless you look for an explanation somewhere on the net.
2348;But if ya give it a chance, it's a really great movie.
2349;incredible, wow, i have watched tons of movies but this.
2350;this movie is really really good, i cant ever watch another movie again, i will end my movie watching with simply the best movie ever made.
2351;It is rare that a movie makes you think even a little bit nowadays, but this one does.
2352;This is a great movie.
2353;If you like strange movies this is the one for you.
2354;it is full of great imagery, crisp clean filmography that blends seamlessly into the special effects.
2355;Great acting and a great soundtrack, Donnie Darko takes you on a journey with its main character that you will never forget.
2356;i don't want to give it away just know that this movie is riveting or eye opening and funny.
2357;i have seen this movie 20 plus times, it is worth three times the amount it costs.
2358;It's beautifully strange, filled with pain and innocence.
2359;Maybe the music, that is so in tune with the story.
2360;I was blown away by everything about the movie: The theme, the story, the acting, the music (what great music!)
2361;What other movie would actually have Joy Division's Love will tear us apart ?
2362;He's part superhero, and willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to save the world, or maybe just the world most closely connected to him.
2363;the movie draws you in with the haunting soundtrack (which I highly recommend for insomniac's who like closing their eyes :.) )
2364;The score and the song selections are fitting and revealing.
2365;What is most amazing to me is how out of their element so many well known actors and actresses are: Drew Barrymore, Noah Wile, Jake Gyllenhall, Patrick Swayze, etc. do yourself a favor and watch this movie.
2366;I had read and seen many trailers and previews for this film but never got to see it.
2367;bending treasure this has turned out to be!
2368;Part American Beouty, part eighties teen drama, part dark comedy.
2369;Jake Gyllenhall is brilliant as the troubled title character.
2370;The entire cast was perfect, and I hope that this movie gets more of a following now that its out everywhere.
2371;The deleted scenes are so amazing, they really unravel the story for you.
2372;If you ever wondered if there was something wrong with you, or if you were broken, watch this movie.
2373;Donnie Darko is one of those rare movies with something for everyone that still manages to be completely dark.
2374;generally its a movie that will keep you thinking.
2375;The interesting thing about the story is that the more you look into it, the less you see these things, and the more you realize the paradox of the story.
2376;It will leave you with many a question.
2377;go to Roger Ebert's website and see for yourself.
2378;i just bought it today.
2379;"watching this is kind of like watching one of the LOTR extended versions
2380;Donnie Darko is one of the best movie experiences I've ever had.
2381;Innovative, fascinating, and unusual, this movie breaks boundaries and twists your mind in interesting ways.
2382;I've seen this movie at least a dozen times and I still find something new every time I watch it.
2383;I have read several reviews that said that Donnie Darko' is difficult to classify"
2384;I suppose that Donnie Darko' is best recommended to people who do not like pat answers.
2385;He believes the world is about to end.
2386;middle class lifestyle, one which truly does have some 'Alice Through the Looking.
2387;An Edgar Allen Poe quote came to mind near the film's end: Perchance everything we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.
2388;'What I can't describe here are the visuals, which are fascinating.
2389;richard Kelly has the right stuff to become a major new force in movies.
2390;I have been convinced of Jake Gyllenhall's tremendous acting skills since 'October Sky', another highly recommended movie.
2391;My real rating is 4 1/2.
2392;Director: Richard KellyWriter: Richard KellyStarring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, Noah WyleDonnie Darko has become a modern cult classic.
2393;It is Richard Kelly's masterpiece (at least from a screen writing perspective), and easily Jake Gyllenhaal's most famous role.
2394;It is a tale of existential philosophy and interdimensional time travel, full of paradoxes, and has some intense, deep meanings if you care to dig enough (and see it more than once).
2395;"They both compliment this idea of a very dark story taking place in a ""perfect"" suburban setting."
2396;This is one of those few movies that actually make you think.
2397;Even if you don't like the story line, the production makes up for it.
2398;Of all the movies I've seen, this one is in my top 5.
2399;Watch this with a friend and let the conversations begin.
2400;Utterly facinating and the best thing Jake's done in my opinion.
2401;Great soundtrack, funny, scary, thought provoking and basically everything a movie should be.
2402;the film, written and directed by Richard Kelly, captures the high school angst that I remember so well.
2403;Kelly is young, and some of the film's themes are executed a bit heavy.
2404;handedly, but the heart of the film is constant.
2405;dARKO's cast is really incredible.
2406;What a potpourri of talent!
2407;is great as a guru with a secret.
2408;Of course, Jake Gyllenhaal, as Donnie, is really wonderful.
2409;by far one of the best movies i have seen in my life.
2410;the acting on the lead character's part is out of this world and you really feel a strong connection to the characters as the movie progresses.
2411;the story is incredible, original, and thought.
2412;like the synopsis above said, the movie is truly genre.
2413;Actually I really liked this movie.
2414;I'm a big fan of the whole 'makes you think' kind of thing.
2415;Not saying this one does that, but I just thought I should share that.
2416;This movie's pretty cool though.
2417;It still makes for a good story.
2418;I would personally like to attribute this movie with the whole '80s is cool' thing.
2419;Because in my mind it started with all the 'cool kids' and we all know they liked this movie.
2420;But aside from that abomination, it's one of my favorite movies.
2421;Richard Kelly is a twisted genius.
2422;fi tale about time travel, but it takes a while before the viewer can actually figure that out.
2423;it's a scifi story in that it deals with time.
2424;great roles for Jake Gyllenhaal and his sister, Noah Wyle (from ER) and Drew Barrymore.
2425;"this director's cut brought to mind William Faulkner's line about writers often having to ""kill their darlings"" in order to meet the demands of a work's wholeness and integrity."
2426;"The film's emotional force was stunning
2427;It worked terrifically as a film experience, being a beautiful """"whole"""" work of art."""
2428;Extras that included Roberta Sparrow's book were great .
2429;Fortunately, we do get those scenes here, but we also get the overwhelming force of the director's enthusiasm .
2430;"on the upside, there's a nifty freedom to that enthusiasm which translates well into the Darko world IF you are also enthusiastic and into ""playing"" with Darko."
2431;In other words, if you love Donnie Darko already, you may find this cut a lot of fun.
2432;You'll be missing that visceral power and compelling wonder that makes movies great and leaves you wanting to see a movie again .
2433;The creature also relays to Donnie that the world will end in 28 days or so.
2434;Donnie has a caring family, however they don't seem very protective at all.
2435;Donnie also has a psychiatrist(Katherine Ross), who uses hypnosis on Donnie to understand his thoughts, and his actions.
2436;Kelly shows talent here, and demonstrates that he can write one heck of a good screenplay.
2437;Donnie Darko has a great young cast.
2438;It features of course Jake Gyllenhaal, who shows some real talent here, and also shows that he is one of the stars of the future.
2439;Also showing talent is Jake sister in real life, and in the film Maggie Gyllenhaal.
2440;She has an odd, mysterious look to her, but shows she has an ability to act, and is leading lady material.
2441;She has been in earlier films such as Stepmom and Cheaters , but here she looks beautiful, and gives a beautiful performance.
2442;Donnie Darko is a great film, and will have viewers talking, and watching again.
2443;I think it is about a whole host of things, not least love, time.
2444;travel, divine intervention and of course, growing up.
2445;His acting as Donnie is first rate and you can expect to see a whole lot more of him over the years.
2446;Drew Barrymore plays a somewhat unique teacher and her talent and above all reputation and influence is clearly just what this film needed.
2447;"help guru Jim Cunningham (not entirely dissimilar to Mr Jack Russell who recently spoke to the L6), best known for his book ""Cunning visions of love""."
2448;This film really kills Swayze's image, whatever it might have been, which makes this film all the more refreshing to watch.
2449;donnie Darko is a film which I strongly recommend watching, if only because its innovation and style mean that in the future many references will be made to it.
2450;It is a film that will stay in the back of your mind for as long as it takes you to piece the puzzle together, but its well worth the wait.
2451;One of the best movies I have ever seen.
2452;A little hard to follow at first but grips you and leaves you stunned at the end.
2453;A movie to watch over and over and over and find something new every time.
2454;blue ray but it was even better.
2455;The differences from the Theatrical Cut in presentation are subtle, and the differences in character are grand.
2456;i really enjoy the Theatrical Cut.
2457;I think it leaves so much to the imagination that the impact of the film is felt greater.
2458;At the San Diego Comic Con, Richard Kelly told the audience how the Director's Cut came about.
2459;Donnie Darko never got it's fair shake when it was first released.
2460;"Richard Kelly said that the opening was designed to go with ""Never Tear Us Apart"" by INXS, and I can see that
2461;I did enjoy the further interaction between the members of Donnie's family.
2462;I think that added a lot to the film.
2463;Sometimes the audience's imagination can be much more impressive than the film maker's.
2464;Not completely understanding the Theatrical Cut when I first watched it is one of the things that I thoroughly enjoyed about it.
2465;It's one of those rare films where I'm going to own both the Theatrical Cut and the Director's Cut.
2466;The critics said it was nail biting, well they're right, I was biting my nails to keep myself entertained.
2467;Although the ending leaves the entire experience open to interpretation, the journey through the film itself is what's important, and it truly is that.
2468;This is one of my favorite movies.
2469;I have seen it over 10 times and it gets better every time I watch it.
2470;This achieves what many movies cannot, its very well worth your time, and will make you think.
2471;ray transfer of this movie.
2472;ray I had to have it since it's one of my favorite movies.
2473;Donnie Darko, has it all, a great 80's feel with great cinematography, great acting, dialog, and story line.
2474;A cult classic that was never going to find a mass audience.
2475;Even if the filmmaker has taken some missteps since, this is a near perfect film.
2476;Love the 80s setting and soundtrack, love the wacky rabbit and time travel, love the high school parts (more honest than moist HS films), love the actors and their characters.
2477;This is one of my favorite films of all time, and when i heard it was on blu.
2478;Here's the deal:Excellent plot, acting, cinematography, dialogue, and musical score.
2479;I like movies, and I like this movie.
2480;I'd recommend picking up the original version, which is a five star film.
2481;After a few viewings, head on over to the website and see what you can see.
2482;But movies that make you ask questions are usually the ones that turn out to be the best.
2483;It's funny, it's sad, it's wierd, it's worth it.
2484;They offer the video to Gary Jule's remake of Tears for Fears Mad and World and not only is it a great remake but a great video.
2485;It also gives you a list of the actors and crews past works and gives you some ideas of other movies to see.
2486;I personally loved this movie, even though it was a little confusing i really liked it.
2487;I thought the plot was good and how it made you think he was still going on with his life, but in truth he was have a vision of what would happen if he happened to break away from what was destined for him.
2488;Damn good to say the leastI'd highly recommend it to any and everyone
2489;After seeing it I thought of the film as a sort of Ordinary People meets Being John Malkovich, with a touch of Pi and American Beauty thrown in.
2490;But ultimately that equation is unfair"
2491;gyllenhaal's outstanding performance helps to hold the film together.
2492;"He is a quirky, offbeat leading man
2493;Gyllenhaal's work is superbly complemented by that of an eclectic ensemble cast which includes Katharine Ross, Drew Barrymore, and Noah Wyle.
2494;It blends together elements of serious family drama, 80s period piece, horror, satire, and science fiction.
2495;The script makes intriguing use of 80s pop culture.
2496;And there are some really moving scenes that tap into the universal experience of human loneliness and the need for love.
2497;If there was ever a movie that had all the elements to make it a cult classic, it's the haunting Donnie Darko.
2498;They're an average family, with an older sister heading for college (Elizabeth, played by Jake's real life sister Maggie), a cute.
2499;All's the pity, because Donnie is also extremely bright and has a piercing wit that embarrasses adults.
2500;In spite of himself, Kelly has created a movie that alternately weeps at the desperate loneliness of so many humans living next to each other and exults in the sheer joy of existence.
2501;In the mean time, town life goes on: Samantha's dance group gets discovered by an agent, a self.
2502;The movie emphasizes the madness of putting Fear and Love as diametrically opposed elements, emphasizing that the world is never that simple and often involves a mixture of the two.
2503;kelly's camerawork is exceptionally mature for a new director.
2504;angle scenes and takes on some breathtaking shots"
2505;at least as integral to the film is the 80s music that permeates it.
2506;This movie is a love letter to the misbegotten youth of year 2000 twenty.
2507;The music is always appropriate and conveys the slow tumble of Donnie's life very effectively.
2508;donnie Darko has a lot in common with movies like Groundhog Day and Fight Club.
2509;The themes of personal choice, of growing beyond one's own selfish nature, of facing down one's demons in a universe that doesn't exist make for though.
2510;provoking cinema in the tradition of the silver screen.
2511;Not only that, but it is one of the finest movies ever made.
2512;Jake Gyllenhaal gives an excellent performance in the title role.
2513;His acting is truly outstanding.
2514;The closest thing I can relate it to is Twelve Monkeys.
2515;But Donnie Darko goes farther and deeper and asks more questions.
2516;It is haunting and humorous and even a little scary.
2517;If you are a person given to flights of philosophical fancy or theological speculation, (or even if you like reading Stephen Hawking and Michio Kaku), you will love this movie.
2518;You will have to watch the movie over and over again, and each time you do the allegory becomes fuller and fuller as the revelation opens.
2519;Donnie gives up his life so that his beloved might live, but in the process he changes everyone and everything.
2520;First time writer/director Richard Kelly has created a real gem here.
2521;The characters are fresh but true.
2522;life and never formulaic, yet in many of them Kelly still manages to find springboards for satirical comments on diverse societal elements like the American school system, infomercials, spin doctors public images, the entertainment industry, the popular perception of science, and more.
2523;All of this coalesces into a fascinating and compelling examination of consciousness, perception, and the nature of reality.
2524;the film's entire cast is quite strong and handles the deep material with the appropriate degree of earnestness.
2525;Star Jake Gyllenhaal is especially outstanding in the title role.
2526;His Donnie Darko, though emotionally imbalanced, is both an intriguing and sympathetic character, one that engages the absurdities in life.
2527;with saturnine curiosity rather than fear, and he therefore establishes a perfect tone for the film.
2528;The cute and talented Jena Malone also does a wonderful job as Donnie's girlfriend, Gretchen, a young woman who is nearly as perplexed and yet intrigued by life's absurdities as Donnie himself.
2529;In a refreshing departure from the usual hunk and heartthrob roles in which he is usually cast, Patrick Swayze delivers a darkly humorous interpretation of a smarmy self.
2530;help guru, and the beautiful Drew Barrymore.
2531;offers a convincing yet low.
2532;key portrayal of an unconventional but popular high.
2533;The wonderful bonus features include two feature commentaries.
2534;one with writer/director Kelly and star Gyllenhaal, the other with various members of the cast and crew.
2535;Definitely worth the price of admission, and a disc that fans of more cerebral SF will want in their collections.
2536;It is a truely amazing film, somewhere between sci.
2537;So naturally when the director's cut came out i was very excited.
2538;"It's well known how big studios have a way of destroying the vision of artists by changing storylines around and elimnating unnessary things like a ""complex plot"" and ""character development"" in order to make movies more marketable."
2539;Kelly changes songs in the movie, altering the mood, and not for the better.
2540;One of the things that i liked so much about the original is that the story was very sci.
2541;The original Donnie Darko deserves 6 stars.
2542;This reworking of the classic is definately worth the ride, even though it will disappoint most Darko disciples.
2543;The additions and changes are extensive, and the mood and tenor of the original are modified significantly.
2544;The original Donnie Darko is a rich hypnotic fantasy for affectionatos to obsess over.
2545;The movie is still worth owning.
2546;I bought this movie because a friend told me I needed to see it.
2547;It is the greatest movie that I have ever seen!!
2548;This has became one of my favorite movies of all time, so give it a shot.
2549;I appreciate the heck out it, am impressed by the imagination and creativity of the filmmakers, and admire the fact that what they put on screen belies their $4 million budget.
2550;Most of all, I enjoy the heightened sense of awareness I get every time it finishes.
2551;On one such night journey he meets a new friend, a 6.
2552;for airplane engine has crash.
2553;It's the kind of setup that keeps the audience on its toes for the rest of the film.
2554;area thinking, claiming that life is more complex than that.
2555;He loves the beatific Darko family, the progressive young teachers at school, and Gretchen (Jena Malone), Donnie's new girlfriend.
2556;And to his credit, there is a lot here that is either very accomplished or shows potential.
2557;I did say that every time I watch the film it affects me in a poignant way, and now I'll tell you why.
2558;first of all, it looks great.
2559;"They even manage a skillful recreation of the living water effect first seen in James Cameron's ""The Abyss""."
2560;His camera work is ambitious or simple when necessary.
2561;The latter is often punctuated by blinding flashes of light, most notably the brilliant beam that presciently spews from Frank's left eye.
2562;kelly does fine detailed work making sure the authenticity of the time period is maintained.
2563;From the clothes, to the conversations, to, most importantly, the music, everything fits the era to a T.
2564;"He manages to get fine use out of not one but two Tears for Fears songs: ""Head Over Heels"" adds power to an effective tracking shot showing the treacherous ecosystem that is Donnie's school
2565;overall, I'll give Richard Kelly the benefit of the doubt, and deign to recommend his film.
2566;Like I said, it offered me enough of a visceral rush that I've seen it multiple times, and look forward to seeing many times more.
2567;Appreciate it as an emotional experience first, and its pleasures will fulfill you.
2568;i guess I liked it after all.
2569;It seems Donnie learns that there is a higher intelligence.
2570;He becomes more aware of his surroundings, which eventually leads to the various coincidences that begin happening in his life"
2571;This is true to our lives as well.
2572;"This is because u have stored more memory of the past to compare with the present
2573;He is able to view other's intent of action before they themselves are even aware.
2574;Things start to click together for him, and he begins to realize that there is something going on beyond the physical realm"
2575;There is a much greater plan that he and everyone in the world is part of.
2576;He has finally realized what life is all about.
2577;overall, this movie is genius.
2578;"In the subgenre of pshycological thrillers known as the ""Mindf***"" category, Donnie Darko is among the most liked and well."
2579;"Richard Kelly's quirky ""Donnie Darko"" was an audience."
2580;donnie is a thoughtful young man with a problem of unclear dimensions.
2581;But it's also satire, family dramedy, teen romance, and a period film of the 1980s.
2582;The family dynamic is sincere and good.
2583;The first is by writer/director Richard Kelly and actor Jake Gyllenhaal.
2584;This includes their recollections of filming, discussion of themes and characters, Gyllenhaal's thoughts about Donnie, discussion of the film's mysteries, and what the director hoped to reveal as the film progressed.
2585;They are a friendly bunch, conversing with the director and each other about the film, commenting on the scenes.
2586;Being a huge fan of avante garde film and film noir, I really looked forward to seeing this movie.
2587;time travel, choices, the nature of the universe, reality . . . .
2588;it's just an amazing film.
2589;the cast is superb, especially Jake Gyllenhall (sp?)
2590;I thought Drew Barrymore did a great job as the teacher, and the initial classroom scene with her is really interesting .
2591;The reactions of all the characters were quite realistic too .
2592;Even if you love it the first time out (like I did), you will want to watch it again.
2593;"It's really an amazing film, and rates right next to ""Fight Club"" (specifically, Tyler's ""Middle children of history"" speech) for defining the angst and confusion of our generation."
2594;And believe me, the scene is essential to fully understanding the ending.
2595;one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time.
2596;the theatrical cut is much more poetic.
2597;A lot of people say that it is better because it leaves so much interpretation as to what all happens to the viewer.
2598;the Director's Cut helps explain more of what happens, and the supernatural aspect of it, and leaves less interpretation.
2599;I would recommend the Theatrical Version, but really either is better.
2600;It is quite interesting to listen to.
2601;It was on late one night, and it certainly kept me up.
2602;That's ok because it's a wonderful movie, despite its dark overtones.
2603;rate from everyone and it was well cast and directed.
2604;If you like movies and aren't afraid to be challenged a bit, this comes very highly recommended.
2605;I forget the actual theatrical ending of Donnie Darko but it was good enough to make me want to own it.
2606;Director's Cut maybe not as mysterious as the original but the version give director's explanation and more detail the lacked in the original.
2607;Commentary is awesome and extra scenes are great.
2608;I also agree with the above about Catcher in the Rye and the Oscar.
2609;I very much enjoyed the theatrical version of this film.
2610;I highly recommend the theatrical release of this film to all, however, steer clear of the DC if you want an enjoyable movie experience.
2611;this is one of my favorite movies.
2612;its the kind that really makes you think.
2613;It is the best movie of 2001, and on my favorite movies of all time list.
2614;My mind attempted to make sense of everything, and I realized that is exactly the intention.
2615;This movie was about the struggle of an immensely intelligent kid who is more than a little crazy.
2616;The philosophy comes in the form of his explorations and thought processes.
2617;He sees the world so clearly, yet nobody else does.
2618;a fascinating look at the mind of a dark young man.
2619;"Richard Kelly's remarkably assured directorial debut, ""Donnie Darko"", could be earmarked as the teen movie version of Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" with a surreal sci."
2620;for ensemble cast and probably the best poster of 2001 (not to mention a seriously deranged web.
2621;"That said, ""Donnie"" trades in some David Lynch."
2622;style moments to keep the audience happy, not least in Donnie's eerie messanger, Frank, the six.
2623;The film is effortlessly secured in the '80s with a very decent pop soundtrack (though lack of money prevented the filmmakers from releasing a 'various artists' soundtrack) and is very well shot by director of photography Steven Poster (particularly highlighted in Donnie's scenes with Frank in his bathroom).
2624;"Kelly also manages to worm in some decent digital effects, from the ""Abyss""."
2625;"Gyllenhaal epitomises the film's sweet, moral centre as well as the thick paranoia set throughout, and emerges alongside ""Ghost World's"" Thora Birch's Enid as 2001's most beguiling teen hero."
2626;There is no denying, though, that Kelly is a talent to watch in the future, considering the remarkable debut he's made here.
2627;It is beautiful, profound, thought provoking, striking.
2628;Everyone should see this film, though, it's revolutionary.
2629;mounts his bicycle and makes his way back home to the tune of Echo and The Bunnymens The Killing Moon in what is an excellent opening sequence.
2630;Right from these first few frames it was obvious that I was about to witness something very original and it had me hooked.
2631;It announces the arrival of two great new talents in Writer/Director Richard Kelly and the young actor Jake Gyllenhall, in what is a hugely original, ingenious and entertaining movie.
2632;much of this movie is darkly comic and there are some great scenes including a conversation between Donnie and his therapist, where she asks him what he thinks about at school.
2633;personally I loved this movie but whether or not you enjoy this movie probably depends upon how far left of centre you like your movies.
2634;Meanwhile writer/director Richard Kelly creates a wonderful sense of tension and keeps you guessing throughout the movie that even after the final titles have rolled you are still left to mull over what you have just witnessed.
2635;Closing appropriately to a cover version of the old Tears For Fears song Mad World and the lyrics the dreams on which Im dying are the best Ive ever had, neatly ties up the previous two hours and what was for me a very satisfactory cinematic experience.
2636;Destined for cult status this undoubtedly deserves five stars!
2637;This dark, surreal movie is brilliant if a little confusing.
2638;It was a really subtle sequence.
2639;Donnie Darko is better, more entertaining, MUCH more engaging than American Beauty.
2640;but well, I'm a hopeless romantic, and I just loved the way that part of life was portrayed in Donnie Darko.
2641;And I'd love it if you were to join me by doing the same once you've read this.
2642;That's how I feel about this film.
2643;for all those people who (like me) had heard of Donnie Darko and casually added it to their to.
2644;do list based on the buzz, see it as soon as you can.
2645;This movie is so special it hurts.
2646;"It's breathtakingly original and ambitious
2647;It's not exactly philosophy, and it's not perfect, but it's enormously bighearted, earnest, clever, and moving.
2648;how Richard Kelly hit the 1988 nail so perfectly on the head is just beyond me.
2649;I bet you'll find the movie especially compelling if you were born between 1968 and 1980 .
2650;I thought Donnie Darko was a decent movie, and I can definitely understand how it became the cult classic it is.
2651;this film has to be one of the greatest films of all time.
2652;it has a clever story and characters you can relate to in real life, except frank the giant bunny which is a clever thing in its own way.
2653;it's a must see and a must own all round for everyone.
2654;It has a lot to do with time travel.
2655;This has to be the most thought.
2656;You have to watch this movie twice to catch everything, and you will want to!
2657;Just full of twists and turns and wonderfully strange characters.
2658;Jake Gyllenhaal is just amazing as Donnie Darko.
2659;fi and crazy plot twists, then you will thoroughly appreciate Richard Kelly's masterpiece.
2660;I honestly don't get why this film has received the amount of attention it has.
2661;I liked it but I certainly did not find it great.
2662;Perhaps this film appeals most to people who enjoy puzzles purely for the mental exercise.
2663;And boy, oh boy, was it worth the wait!
2664;Richard Kelly presents something stunning here.
2665;At times mordantly funny, shrewdly satiric, eerie, tragic, but always fascinating, Donnie Darko is an inspiration for people like me looking for something that will come as a revelation.
2666;Jake Gyllenhaal does tricky, effective work here, and carries the film strongly.
2667;rate, and the rest of the supporting cast know exactly what Kelly wants from them.
2668;Touching, funny, surprising and entertaining, Donnie Darko will remain one of my favorite films of all time.
2669;I'll say right now that I love both versions, maybe the DC a little bit more.
2670;it's a very good movie, just make sure you know which version you're getting.
2671;This movie is smart, good looking and moves at a quick pace.
2672;Watch this movie, end to end, then watch it again.
2673;This incredible cast of actors were given roles that they could sink their teeth into.
2674;Sure to be a cult classic.
2675;Donnie Darko is one of my favorite movies of all time.
2676;The film has a strong script and even stronger performances.
2677;Jake Gyllenhaal, in the title role, gives a magnificant performance that makes you forget that he did bubble boy (and THATS saying something!)
2678;The movie has its gentle moments, and its moments that grab you and never let go, but the entire experience itself is rivetting.
2679;The ending will keep you thinking for weeks, and it will take a couple of viewings to truely begin to comprehend it.
2680;There are multiple deleted scenes which are interesting to see, and the commentary with Jake Gyllenhaal and the director/writer Richard Kelly help shine light on some of the more obscure parts of the film.
2681;This is one of the most creative movies that I've seen in a long time.
2682;It evoked many emotions, made a lasting impression on me, and was a complete mind trip.
2683;Additionally, it has a great soundtrack.
2684;An astonishing achievement in independent cinema, young writer.
2685;thriller is disturbing and audaciously original.
2686;Targeting American suburbia, Kelly's film saturates audiences with its dark sense of humor and mind.
2687;Acting like it invented the satirical look at new.
2688;But, this film is incredible.
2689;No real reason to try and explain the plot, I probably couldn't if I tried, but suffice to say, all around the film is amazing.
2690;see this motion picture IMMEDIATELY.
2691;As I very easily watched it another 3 or 4 times, I started to get it.
2692;this is the thinking man's (or woman's) movie.
2693;The story is absolutely amazing, a giant paradox with results that no one is sure of.
2694;as you watch it over and over you'll become completely engrossed in Donnie's world.
2695;You never see the same movie twice, there's always something new to think about.
2696;Everytime you watch it something new will pop into your head.
2697;this is a true cult classic, it will be around for years.
2698;It truly is a paradoxial masterpiece.
2699;You can tell it was shot on film but it looks great.
2700;I love this movie and really enjoyed the time travel aspect.
2701;Jake Gyllenhaal, star of the godforsaken film Bubble Boy, gives the performance of his young career here as title character Donnie Darko.
2702;Writer/director Richard Kelly has crafted an unbelieveably moving film that scares, shocks, and plays with the mind of the viewer while having a sense of dark humor to it all.
2703;This is destined to become a cult classic, and the fact Donnie goes to see Evil Dead in a theater makes this film even more of a gem.
2704;'Donnie Darko' is without a doubt one of the best films I have ever seen.
2705;It is a brilliant mix of satire, dark humour and sci.
2706;fi, founded on Kelly's fantastic dialogue and direction.
2707;This chilling idea sets Donnie Darko on a quest to discover the existence of God and the idea of time travel.
2708;the symbolic nature of the film is what makes it outstanding.
2709;There are ironic parallels with the Bible, 'Hamlet' and 'Catcher in the Rye', and Kelly uses these expertly for a director of such young years.
2710;A defiant but bright boy struggles in a world that he cannot understand and does not understand him, until finally he finds strength in the girl he loves.
2711;Kelly cleverly transforms adolescent indulgence into the act of a saviour.
2712;i didn't expect a lot of the things I saw, and the story was about as engrossing as anything I've ever seen.
2713;The story and the acting were compelling, and the casting was great.
2714;See this movie now or I will destroy you.
2715;All of the performances are awesome.
2716;It contains an original plot, greating casting and hauntingly beautiful music.
2717;For the sake of great movie.
2718;It is so good that I feel sorry for director Richard Kelly.
2719;Because with such an astonishing debut, how is he going to top this one!
2720;This movie is great, and the soundtrack is awesome!
2721;I loved Harvey From Hell, """"Frank"""" the demonic bunny rabbit."""
2722;"I hope they do a sequel focusing more on Parallel Universes
2723;It is for anyone who likes a movie that is thought provoking.
2724;The cast is great and the acting is phenomenal.
2725;You will especially enjoy this movie if you loved the whole vibe of the 80's, I know I did.
2726;A curious movie, in the mould of David Lynch.
2727;the 80's election setting is a very original and Frank The Rabbit is decidedly creepy.
2728;Drew Barrymore is rather sexy as a rogue teacher.
2729;Its a strange film that doesn't follow any linear pattern or conventional storyline, but it grabs your attention nonetheless with the awesome visuals, superb acting by a first rate cast, and has many funny moments punctuated by memorable, quotable lines.
2730;This film, more than most I've seen, leaves a lasting impression after a first viewing.
2731;Its a funny moment, and a memorable one between father and son.
2732;I also loved the scene where Drew Barrymore tells Donnie that maybe he and the Bunny can read """"Watership Down"""" together."""
2733;That's a funny line that should never have been cut from the theatrical release.
2734;"what makes this film most memorable for me, where the director more than earned his right to direct future films, is the awesome scene when Tears for Fears ""Head Over Heels"" plays and we see a shortened, film."
2735;a. film, as all the elements of the overall film flow quite well with the music.
2736;Its far better than most music videos I've seen and if they ever gave an Academy Award for best scene in a motion picture, that scene deserves the Oscar.
2737;"I also love the haunting melody and images of people grieving when ""Mad World"" plays."
2738;An appropriately brilliant song, as are most song selections for this film.
2739;Its hard to pull of something like that, but Drew does it perfectly.
2740;Another brilliantly shot scene is when Jake Gyllenhaal and Jena Malone walk down the stairs in perfect synchronicity with each other.
2741;all in all, this film must be seen to be believed, and its complex enough to keep you wanting to watch it over and over, but also engagin enough to pull you into its mystery on first viewing.
2742;This film could be a metaphor for many things and is worthy of a film discussion group.
2743;The images of many scenes are beautifully crafted, well acted, and perfectly touched with the right music.
2744;Director Richard Kelly has every reason to be proud of this notable achievement.
2745;Let the director move on to other projects, bringing his unique vision to the screen.
2746;As great as this film may be.
2747;This movie actually makes you want to watch it over and over just to understand it(a good thing).
2748;One of the best movies I have EVER seen(I've seen a lot of movies).
2749;I just recently viewed this film because I kept hearing everyone talk about how good this movie was.
2750;So over all I did enjoy this movie, just remember to pay attention.
2751;everything was in great condition and came on time, i recommend!
2752;This is a great movie with great cast!
2753;I love this movie and would give it 5 stars.
2754;This is probally one of the best films that i've seen of 2001 it directed Beautifully and just everyone in it iz amazing.
2755;I deffinetly give it Two thumbs Way up and 10 starz
2756;This may be the weirdest and most disconcerting film I've ever seen, and I mean that as a compliment.
2757;A truly strange and original take on the angstiness of adolescence.
2758;Jake Gyllenhaal manages to be both creepy and cute.
2759;A great soundtrack, too, which was an unexpected bonus.
2760;This is my all time favorite movie.
2761;If you havent seen it you MUST watch it, seriosuly so great.
2762;And this is actually a really great deal price wise for this movie on blue ray.
2763;this is one movie that grabs you and pulls you in!!
2764;if you haven't seen this movie you gotta watch it!!
2765;I've watched about 100 times and still find new details everytime I watch!
2766;The disk arrived in just about perfect condition, and the shipping time was good as well.
2767;This movie was downright wonderful.
2768;It hooks you in and keeps you thinking and interested during the duration of the whole movie.
2769;Great acting, great plot, great movie.
2770;This movie is beautiful, dark, and full of paradoxes.
2771;Every time I watch it, I love it.
2772;Strong themes throughout, the meaning of life, nature of relationships, nature of reality, religion and skepticism combined.
2773;It added elements of the science fiction aspect of the story that were missing from the original.
2774;"For those of us who were wondering we now have a more definitive answer
2775;overall, the added footage plus the Roberta Sparrow interpositions make the director's cut a more definitive science fiction classic"
2776;This kid has some neato powers and it makes for an intense movie.
2777;The character that ran off the Sesame Street set, was the funniest thing to hit the theater since the crew members of Saved by The Bell believed they could transfer to film.
2778;I thoroughly enjoyed this film and the adventure.
2779;This is probably one of my top three movies!
2780;An amazing cast, Jake Gyllenhal, Drew Barrymore, Noah wylie, Patrick Swayze.
2781;The director's cut is much better.
2782;And while it's nicely ironic, well written and cleverly engineered .
2783;Which I don't think is a good thing.
2784;regarding performances, Jake Gylenhaal definitely stood out and did an above average job with his role.
2785;ended structure to mold the thing into something that fits their own individual agendas.
2786;by now most everyone knows that early in the film the world diverges into a tangent universe, a situation that must be remedied in 28 days or the normal universe will end.
2787;"but ""Donnie Darko"" becomes extraordinary when viewed instead as an allegorical story about free will versus destiny."
2788;Instead of being given a chance to see what the world would be like if he had not been born, Donnie is given the chance to see how his continued existence would alter events.
2789;For George Bailey the experience was full of positive revelations, for Donnie it is the opposite.
2790;Since he is not essential to the event, he is given a chance to experience an additional 28 days of life to see the effects of his remaining alive and then choose between the two alternate futures.
2791;But he is also given the ability to actually see the force fields that draw everyone toward their destinies and finds himself powerless to resist such manipulation.
2792;the cast is solid although avoiding Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze is normally a good idea.
2793;Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent and it is nice that his actual sister Maggie plays his film sister.
2794;Unlike most movies, the entire plot of the movie stays hidden until the very end.
2795;It has everything from up.
2796;This is a metaphysics wet dream of a movie and it does move along at a fairly rapid pace and is very funny in parts.
2797;The only thing is that the ending is a bit of a let down, but the music score is as memorable as say .
2798;Halloween and certainly this is one of the best indie pics we have seen in years.
2799;The plot is indescribably complicated.
2800;It all culminates in a fateful Halloween party.
2801;It baffles me how many good reviews I keep reading about this movie.
2802;I saw it for the first time last weekend, and I'm pretty sure it's the WORST thing I've seen in the last 2 years.
2803;evaluate this film if someone raved about it in an intelligible manner, instead of just saying this Bubble Boy kid is an amazing actor, and it's sooo original.
2804;Also, note to the director: Cussing at the dinner table, followed by a little kid repeating it is so well.
2805;All this does is make the American Pie kids howl with laughter.
2806;If you're just looking for a more entertaining movie, that's easy, just see if your local family.
2807;Donnie Darko is a very good movie.
2808;Yeah it gets a little to complicated for itself at times, but it's entertaining the entire way through.
2809;A very good film with a very good cast.
2810;I myself do not enjoy it quite as much as the original, for the above reasons.
2811;I hope you enjoy this very good movie.
2812;Donnie is living in a rich suburban town and goes to a private Christian school.
2813;Donnie is seeing a psychiatrist who tells him he is schizophrenic.
2814;This film is a complex science fiction flick, but also a dark comedy.
2815;What I think is funny about this is that it's all so real!!
2816;There are thousands of Jim Cunninghams all around the world.
2817;anyway, Donnie Darko is really brilliant and worth the watch
2818;some reward to the audience for their time and effort.
2819;In my opinion, that happens when the puzzle is interesting, provocative or profound, as dictated by the content of the movie.
2820;"The best you'll get from this movie is ""I think I kinda sorta know what the director had in mind."
2821;Patrick Swayze is frighteningly realistic as an infomercial host.
2822;Viewed another way, EVERYONE in the movie had a part in the story, if you can wrap your mind around the plot.
2823;"One gets the feeling director Richard Kelly knew this, when he had Jake Gyllenhaal say ""Deus ex machina"" at an inopportune moment ."
2824;The gods work in mysterious ways, everyone knows that.
2825;"I love the way the ""human interaction"" is portrayed within the family."
2826;had a surprise ending that helped explain some of what was rally happening.
2827;I recommend it to sci fi and fantasy fans.
2828;i won't give it away,but up until that point i found it mildly interesting,and kinda clever.
2829;If you're a fan of strange films with dark and uncertain content, then I certainly recommend you check out 'Donnie Darko' .
2830;but part of the appeal of a strange and uncertain film is that it will come together in the end, explaining much of the strangeness in the film with a clever and satisfying twist.
2831;There are a number of very interesting ideas in this movie, but while each stands fairly well on it's own, they fail to come together in a meaningful way.
2832;the strengths of 'Donnie Darko' are its characters (the Darko family is great!)
2833;These alone make the movie well worth watching.
2834;oh man, this movie is wonderful.
2835;it answers all of your questions, you just have to be smart enough to know when it does.
2836;and i thought the acting and script were good.
2837;I'm a big David Lynch fan and several people said that I would love this because of that.
2838;i highly recommend this if you're a fan of Lynch, and for anyone who's not, it's actually much easier to understand than a lot of his work.
2839;trust me when I say that you should shell out the extra few bucks for the director's cut.
2840;Not an oscar winner, but this one has cult potential.
2841;Just enough fantasy in the real world to keep you entertained, and light humor to round off the edges.
2842;touchy feely fans: You win too.
2843;underdogs of the world: Donnie Darko gives you something to root for.
2844;teenagers still stuck in concrete thinking: Well, Donnie Darko cool, Wow!
2845;big scary wabbit and stuff.
2846;but with all of these details and elaborate connections, we never really get a sense of the heart of the movie .
2847;It's a slice of life film with some strange twists and turns.
2848;Time travel, highschool life, new.
2849;they're all covered in this gem of a movie.
2850;I felt that I understood half of what I saw.
2851;For me that's a plus (I enjoy movies that make me think).
2852;It has an awesome sound track and great 5.1 sound for you home theater fanatics.
2853;And it has a cool soundtrack.
2854;"think ""American Beauty"" style satirical family commentary, throw in equal measures of teen angst, mental illness, time travel and one hilarious monologue on the sex life of the smurfs and you get the idea."
2855;All the ingredients are there for a great film but while I would say the film is certainly Very Good, it never quite pulls all the threads together sufficiently to make it Great.
2856;And it's just as well that Frank wanted to speak with Donnie because while they were chatting about the end of the world a jet engine falls from the sky and crashes into Donnie's bedroom.
2857;You've gotta say that's original.
2858;the whole mood of the film is fantastically dark and ominous and there are enough twists and turns to hold the interest right the way through.
2859;i'd sum it up by calling it an interesting and thought provoking film with interesting themes and a gloriously dark atmosphere.
2860;So in that sense, I give this disc, and movie, 5 stars.
2861;"There's a nice little scene in ""Donnie Darko"" where his girlfriend reflects upon his full name."
2862;Sounds like a superhero, she muses.
2863;In fact, I did a lot of questioning at the end of this picture.
2864;i love movies that toy with my mind, confusing the hell out of me while promising understanding and sometimes, by the movie's end, delivering revelation.
2865;Jacob's Ladder ranks among my favorite films of all time.
2866;"And even when ""The Ninth Gate"" failed to deliver a satisfactory ending, it worked for me nonetheless because I so enjoyed the journey."
2867;The actual content of this section is pretty decent with most of the scenes having the possibility of really having added something to the story and most could've made the film had the director not had to cut the film down to 2 hours from the original rough cut of about 2 and half hours it originally had.
2868;Many of the tidbits and insights provided in both tracks are interesting and above par with many other movie commentaries, but by no means exceptional.
2869;It is quite addicting, and even if I close my eyes and just listen to it, it is still great.
2870;the `Art Gallery section' is neat with a bunch of artwork that inspired works in the film and some of which was used directly in the film.
2871;The production stills are plentiful and interesting.
2872;I would even go as far to say this is one of the best movies ever to be put to the big screen.
2873;It is the type of movie that you have to see again and again, and will still catch something new, even the 50th time you see it.
2874;It draws you in and catches your attention early by its strangeness, and dark comedy.
2875;Fom there in it is a roller coster ride all the way through.
2876;the prefomances in the movie are great.
2877;Jake Gyllenhaal proves himself to be a great actor.
2878;The supporting cast to a great job as well.
2879;This is one of the best movies of all time and you should not pass this up.
2880;My friend recommended me to watch this movie a good while ago.
2881;No words can describe how awesome this movie is.
2882;Just watch it and rejoice.
2883;Donnie Darko is one of those movies that's worth seeing again and again!
2884;This was my first intro to a young and talented Jake Gyllenhaal supported by a cast of familiar names and faces playing strange characters that leave you scratching your head.
2885;Possibly the finest debut film by a new comer ever.
2886;Richard Kelly delivers a brilliant film about a troubled teeneager named Donnie Darko.
2887;in this director's cut, we also get small little things that make the movie more appealing, for example, when donnie is dreaming or waking up to find frank (the rabbit), we see a sweet visual of donnie's one eye with reflections and info on his eye, it's hard to explain, but I wont ruin anything else for you so I'll shut up about the extra footage onthe director's cut.
2888;This film is about a troubled but brilliant young man named donnie darko.
2889;the acting in this movie is surprisingly good, and has a brilliant cast of actors and actresses to pull off the brilliant characters of Richard Kelly's script.
2890;The directing and cinematography is awe inspiring with great directing and visuals.
2891;and as for the soundtrack, the music is mezmirising and absolutely brilliant, music and original score.
2892;So to sum it all up, I Highly reccomend this extraordinary piece of film to anyone who knows and enjoys good cinema.
2893;I saw it,it was a nice trip though it didn't have much of an impact on me.
2894;He is, and he's supposed to.
2895;The commentary by the director/writer and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) is great, and the lost scenes are well.
2896;The two trailers are great (the second one you have to go to the Special Features, then Philosophy of Time Travel .
2897;That will highlight an arrow and with that you hit enter.)
2898;Good movie, good image, good story.
2899;The characters are well developed and the movie keeps you interested in the plot.
2900;If you are a fan or independent films, specifically indie sci.
2901;i was very surprised by how well the film sounds, though.
2902;ray makes sure you are able to take in every bit of it.
2903;The thing is, this film really IS grand indie art!
2904;I think that this film deserves at least one viewing, perhaps more.
2905;Its definitely the kind of film you need to reserve discussion time for.
2906;"I liked ""The Butterfly Effect"" better I think, and ""Vanilla Sky"" absolutely."
2907;Simply put, it's about time travel, but it's about a lot more than that, too.
2908;the acting is consistently outstanding, with a list of well.
2909;"Jake Gyllenhaal gives an amazing performance that is so convincing, you forget that he is acting
2910;While the story is mainly told through his eyes, the other characters are surprisingly sympathetic as well.
2911;instead, we get a highly intelligent and challenging film that engages us as much as it baffles us, that injects enough humor to keep us from stress.
2912;overload, and most importantly, makes us want to watch it again and again, even after we know what's going on.
2913;Both are excellent films, but I viewed both from a distance, more analytically than emotionally.
2914;I was drawn into the world that it creates, and enjoyed it enough to return more than once.
2915;A brilliant first film from Richard Kelly, who has set a very high standard for himself.
2916;The video and audio are excellent, and the extra features are quite thorough.
2917;I particularly enjoyed the commentary by Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhaal, which I listened to the second time I watched the film.
2918;They do a great job of helping the viewer to connect the dots.
2919;words can't even describe how good it is.
2920;very rarely does a film this powerful and affecting come along.
2921;It is a compelling, hypnotic masterpiece that had me turning my head from side to side trying to figure out the plot.
2922;the whole purpose of this film.
2923;It is unpredictable, masterfully edited and scripted, and you just can't go wrong with a cast like this.
2924;It is one of the most entertaining and though.
2925;provoking films I have ever seen.
2926;for those who haven't seen this movie, it's a fantastic ride.
2927;the use of music alone is as haunting as anything i can recall.
2928;The director's cut is my favorite version.
2929;There's still plenty of room for you to think for youself about some intriguing subjects.
2930;If you haven't seen this movie I highly recommend it.
2931;The Director's Cut will be great for you!
2932;The best part of this movie, by far, was the soundtrack.
2933;But that is what makes this film so much fun.
2934;And the movie is so much fun to watch that each viewing is an intense, exciting experience.
2935;a number of pieces come together to make this movie work.
2936;From the opening [picture] of Darko lying on the hill top road to the final image, each [scene] is disturbing, eerie and above all, beautiful.
2937;And the accompanying soundtrack fits these scenes perfectly.
2938;The editing in a number of scenes is equally impressive.
2939;The results will have you rewinding the scene and many others over and over out of their sheer beauty.
2940;right scary smirks and haunting glares all throughout the film.
2941;After all, any film that inspires hours of thought and discussion long after it ends succeeds on all accounts.
2942;Donnie Darko is precisely the kind of movie that becomes a cult classic.
2943;This movie has some impressive visuals and visual effects, and it was all made on a $4.5 million budget.
2944;but it's still amazing that this film cost so little to make.
2945;jake Gyllenhall is wonderful as the title character"
2946;bending genre film with a large cast of good actors.
2947;It's certainly an original work from a first time director, and a film that will certainly leave you with more questions than answers.
2948;both deal with issues that are bigger than us, both have an ending that can be thought of as both happy and sad, and both still haunt me to this day.
2949;The director's cut, with its clips from the tell.
2950;When it was over I was amazed and emotionally attached.
2951;see for anyone who enjoys a very well put together suspense thriller or Sci.
2952;The plot is forever moving along with so many layers to it you wouldn't want to watch it just once!
2953;jake is incredible and gives a stunning performance alongside such a wonderful array of people.
2954;Donnie Darko is an intelligent, darkly funny and beautifully crafted film.
2955;casting, performances, production and soundtrack.
2956;It is subtle, and haunting, with even the minor characters given depth by their portrayal.
2957;It's a touching and evocative portrayal of the hidden compassion teachers can feel for particular students, of the general struggle of teachers today who care about their students.
2958;It's hard to describe it, but it's absolutely magnificent.
2959;This movie did have amazing if not the greatest inventive plotline I have ever seen, it tackled the most important issues in life and death.
2960;religion, the human mind, family, and love.
2961;It makes the viewer focus more on the moral issues and imagery of the story rather than the characters.
2962;This is far from complex and brilliant scenes.
2963;But the movie was inventive, and had some note worthy parts to it.
2964;The thing that gave it mystical complex beauty was the music, which sets the viewer off into a journey into the stars.
2965;The movie was certainly original, and honestly brilliant in some aspects.
2966;It is easy to relate to the main character, but it reminds us of our dark side just beneath the surface (the one that we all try to hide or ignore).
2967;Rarely are movies which are released today so intricate and so well meshed.
2968;Richard Kelly was able to pull off both of these in his first try, with Donnie Darko.
2969;Donnie Darko is the tale of a teenager of the title's namesake (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is also a somnabulist.
2970;Coupled with the fact that Donnie sees a psychiatrist and takes psychiatric medication is fertile territory to make for such a vibrant character.
2971;if you think soundtracks are something more than just an annoyance, then you will love the artists they picked for the as well as well as the original score.
2972;I enjoyed the theatrical version much more.
2973;In addition, it's a teen romance.
2974;The viewer never really knows whether Donnie, a brilliant high school kid is wacko or completely sane while his adult world is nutty.
2975;I particularly liked the scenes with the lady.
2976;Dukakis is smart and thoughtful.
2977;The Physical Education teacher is new.
2978;There's as much political animosity and self.
2979;help gobblygook today as there was in the 80's.
2980;finally, Darko is an incredibly creative film, very interesting to watch visually as things might fall out of the sky at any moment.
2981;Donnie walks through life in movie time, effortlessly burning down buildings while his girlfriend sleeps during a movie date.
2982;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen!!
2983;Very imaginative, excellent portrayal of characters, very believable storyline.
2984;The ending is very twisted and the special effects are amazing.
2985;Most of the time, movies that don't get the media hype, are the best to see.
2986;Movies like this one, are far and few between.
2987;"The soundtrack is amazing, with an excellent cover of the Tears for Fears song ""Mad World""."
2988;jake Gyllenhaal is one of the best new actors out there, also stars his sister Maggie.
2989;Their is a link to the website .
2990;that is a definate must see.
2991;Just like the old Nick Ray picture, this one wins you over with inspired casting and great performances.
2992;Jake Glyllenhaal as Donnie is just brilliant.
2993;It's like Tobey McGuire meets Kafka and it works.
2994;what I liked most about the movie were the scenes depicting Donnie with his family.
2995;Contrary to the stereotype of misunderstood teen movies, this kid's upper middle class nuke family comes off as very likeable.
2996;He's got an older and younger sister and though they're not as sensitive to Donnie's condition as one might wish, they're believable.
2997;When the family gathers for meals or attend events like the little sister's talent show, you feel a genuine spark of family warmth.
2998;And the psychiatrist (played by Katherine Ross.
2999;seems helpful to the very bright Donnie.
3000;There's a wonderful scene where he and his chums discuss the Smurfs and his buds spin all kinds of hardcore sexual theories based on this innocuous toon and Donnie cogently shuts them up.
3001;This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again, and still find something new to think about.
3002;and the thinking will be intense.
3003;Just when you think you know what's going on in this movie, you think about it again and gain an entirely new perspective on just what you thought was going on.
3004;if you want to watch a movie that will force you to think about philosophy, religion, science, etc., AND entertain you by being a mixture of sci.
3005;I've suggested it to many friends, and most of them, after watching it a few times, have come to the same conclusions.
3006;Because it will give you a headache.
3007;It's hard to believe, but it's true.
3008;The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko is TERRIBLE compared to the studio release.
3009;Donnie Darko is also a great movie BTW.
3010;This was a very creative movie.
3011;This is an amazing movie with something for everyone.
3012;Even if you don't get wrapped up in the mystery and go to any means necessary to decipher it, it still has a great atmosphere and is extremely well made.
3013;Great performance, great script, great directing.
3014;I have only seen the Director's Cut (which is what I got), but alternate versions aside, this was a very cool movie.
3015;"Good use of the song ""Mad World""!"
3016;Anyways, this is an amazing movie.
3017;Very cool, and It's a movie that's essential vewing for sure.
3018;This movie is so damn refreshing.
3019;First off, the director somehow manages to get all the actors to be on the same page, for wry, real, fun portrayals.
3020;and from that fulcrum extends a movie that has sci.
3021;I don't want to over hype it, but it's a gem.
3022;Very few times while watching a movie I can sense that this movie is more than it appears to be.
3023;When this film first came out I predicted it would be a cult film, and lord and behold it is.
3024;The movie is moody, weird, funny, scary, touching.
3025;The plot is complex, yet simple.
3026;The acting is top notch, yet effortless.
3027;The direction is slick, fast and fresh, yet subtle.
3028;A lot is left to the imagination, yet a lot is spelled out clear.
3029;There are a lot of twists along the way, and the rollercoaster ride is fun indeed.
3030;its artsy fartsy meets David Lynch.
3031;hour, in a much more touching manner.
3032;Donnie Darko was easily one of the best movies I have ever seen.
3033;The biting cynicism about religion and the way the world is provides for one of the most entertaining and thought provoking movie ever made.
3034;This movie's a doozy, so get it!
3035;This is the only time a movie has made me both happy and depressed based upon its terrific acting.
3036;I believe this movie is more realistic than fantasy , as it brings out emotions that films never do.
3037;blue ray lends even more detail to this visceral mystery.
3038;I have watched this movie over and over again and it just keeps getting deeper and more interesting.
3039;A great film with a lot of actors you would expect for this under the radar hit.
3040;Interesting movie, you never quite know what is real and what is delusion.
3041;Absolutely stunning, beyond what words can describe, one of the best movies ever, and completely original.
3042;frank instructs Donnie to do things, things that disrupt and tear at the lives of the people of his town and school.
3043;And Donnie Darko willingly and joyously bought it for everyone.
3044;I actually watched this movie on the recommendation of my 15 year old son.
3045;This mysterious, funny, moving film has a terrific cast and a very challenging premise.
3046;jake Gylenhaal, as Donnie, is terrific.

3048;spoken young actors, and those kinds of mannerisms can get a bit tiring, but Jake pulls it off with freshness.
3049;His sister Maggie (who was SO terrific in SECRETARY) plays his sister here, and they have a very believable brother/sister, love/hate relationship.
3050;patrick Swayze has some fun with his clean image, and the scenes of him as a motivational speaker are truly hilarious.
3051;Noah Wylie has a small part as another teacher, and he's passable.
3052;it's a difficult movie, and you MUST watch it with your full attention.
3053;This movie is great if your not a shallow person, it has an amazing them running throughout the movie.
3054;pay attention to what donnie tells his science teacher about gods hand in human choice and destiny.
3055;"Like the film ""The Fountain"" you must be patient and see it all the way through before you will really understand it ."
3056;Rest assured the R rating is mainly for extremely strong language.
3057;it is a profoundly unique well done story and no scene can be anticipated in advance as in many other Hollywood films.
3058;"The soundtrack is really good and I really like the ""Mad World"" song and have since bought the soundtrack separately just to have it and some other unique tracks as well."

3061;Along the way, he acquires a girlfriend, Gretchen (Jena Malone, of Life as a House fame), goes to class, feuds with his teachers, has deep and meaningful discussions about the sex lives of the Smurfs, gets bullied by the school bad boys, tries to make life easier for an exchange student, and hangs out with his similarly.
3062;The first time we see Frank, he tells Donnie the world will end in twenty.
3063;The only real difference between Donnie and most high school outcasts is that, well, he"
3064;"What makes it a great film is all the thought that went into the script and the direction
3065;The new footage and assorted changes add nothing substantive or interesting and the attempt to """"explain all"""" reveals that the director himself does not understand what made the original one of the great cult movies in recent years ."""
3066;Donnie Darko is a gem with many flaws.
3067;But when you look closer, the gem is just cracked.
3068;this is as true for the movie as it is for the lead character.
3069;I wish him the best, though, and imagine he has better in him.
3070;nevertheless, give it a watch.
3071;Let's hope he stays versatile.
3072;This movie takes you where few movies dare to go.
3073;I can't give away plot details, but it's very stylized, eerie, menacing and surprisingly complex.
3074;The use of 80s music is excellent.
3075;This film is at turns hilarious, sad, and frightening.
3076;That means it can be viewed over and over, which it will in our house because the acting is excellent and the cinematography is beautiful.
3077;good junk that comes out of hollywood.
3078;This movie was a very pleasant surprise.
3079;what I saw was a solidly entertaining, thought.
3080;provoking, unique and thoroughly original sci.
3081;fi time travel tale with very real and believable human conflict (rare for a science fiction flick).
3082;an unusually gifted actor for his age who consistently demonstrates a sense of truthfulness about his work (unlike so many other young actors of his generation, who seem mostly to be more concerned with looking cool and hip than with honing their craft).
3083;gives a great performance, and is sure to have a wonderful future ahead of him.
3084;Jena Malone as Gyllenhaal's love interest gives a very sensitive and well.
3085;"crafted performance
3086;the most ingenious stroke of casting in this movie, however, is perennial `80s """"Dirty Dancing"""" icon Patrick Swayze as a cheeseball motivational speaker (a la """"Up With People"""")."""
3087;"Definitely his finest performance since ""Road House"" (har, har)."
3088;but the greatest kudos must go to writer.
3089;"fi tale that actually has a believable and compelling element of genuine human drama (George Lucas' stunted and awkward dialogue in his most recent ""Star Wars"" epic and the forced, saccharine emotions of M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" spring to mind), but Kelly manages to pull it off."
3090;This movie is also part satire, too, offering relevant social commentary without being preachy or obvious.
3091;this movie will surely go on to become a cult classic.

3093;The debut of director Richard Kelly.
3094;It's his story, and it's a beauty.
3095;An excellent movie that has become a cult classic.
3096;donnie Darko is a must see film.
3097;Over the years it has become a cult classic.
3098;With writer / director Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko, I found a treat close to home.
3099;fi, you have to see the film!
3100;I recommend this to anyone that wants a taste of nostalgia from the late 80's without the trite clich s always seen in movies.
3101;"This was a more real look into the times, as close as ""The Virgin Suicides."""
3102;If you like dark, subtle plotted tales, this is your movie!
3103;I will be on the look out for more of Richard Kelly's work.
3104;Movies that take advantage of the space are the ones that generally look better.
3105;This Donnie Darko Director's Cut puts both theatrical and Director's versions separately onto ONE disc, cutting the amount of space available for each in half.
3106;There's nothing wrong with that, but a big part of the film's charm is the mood it evokes, and the score is a big part of it.
3107;the bonus disc contains a filmmakers journal, which will certainly interest film buffs, a documentary called 'they made do it too' about people who really liked the movie talking about how they liked the movie, and #1 fan: A Darkomentary (which I didn't watch).
3108;i'm a fan of the film, and even liked Kelly's Southland Tales (which was a good blu.
3109;are the first words that come to mind after seeing Donnie Darko for the first time.
3110;Astonishing and Clever are the first words that come to mind after watching Donnie Darko the second time.
3111;Never before has a film noir been able to capture and convey such raw beauty.
3112;pretty blue skies, descriptive and creative random blurbs of literature, genuine and concise dialogue, and an ending that brings us back to the beginning, which we quickly learn is the beginning.
3113;one of the highlights for me was the use of music, including an awesome and refreshing alternative to the cliche' part of a movie where we meet all the characters, and a group of characters meet for the first time.
3114;the appropriately symbolic song, Everybody wants to Rule the World.
3115;Throughout Donnie Darko the device of music is carefully and purposely implented to create a genuine feel of the late eighties era.
3116;The soundtrack is so deftly used, it sort.
3117;it is a rare feat when a movie remains even from opening scene to the closing credits.
3118;Donnie Darko accomplishes this rarely reached goal though consistently superb cinematography, descriptive prose delivered by colourful characters, dashes of humour, splashes of romance and a huge cerebral heaping of the Philosophy of Time Travel.
3119;coupled with the fear of knowing that every living being on this planet.
3120;His subsequent interactions with Frank, teachers, friends, family, and his therapist weave a completely original and absorbing tale.
3121;Donnie's interest in time travel and anxiety about Frank's apocolyptic predictions move the story forward in a completely unpredictable way.
3122;There is a great deal of humour, especially with Donnie's disdain for the local self help guru.
3123;drama characters present themselves but they are fleshed out with uncommon depth in this movie, Donnie's family are likeable and very functional, his teachers have lives outside school and his girlfriend has a multi.
3124;dimensional personality with troubles of her own.
3125;a hypnotic and darkly beautiful original soundtrack is complemented by one of the best selections of eighties music I have heard in recent memory.
3126;Honestly the way this music is integrated with such meaning and purpose to the film's narative you'd think it was written for it.
3127;working of Tears for Fears Mad World to great tragic effect.
3128;some reviewers have been upset by what they see as a confusing ending, but I found the ending deeply moving and satisfying, as I did the movie as a whole.
3129;I waited a long time to see this movie.
3130;When I heard that a director's cut was coming out, I finally felt that it was my chance to see it.
3131;It is worth its fans though it is a very good and fascinating film with truly, as they say behind the scenes, a universal meaning.
3132;The whole plot though is something so amazing but mind.
3133;The ending itself, though understandable and satisfying, may not be easily understood the first time you watch it.
3134;After looking back once or twice though in the last few moments of the film, it all eventually comes together into again like I said a satisfying and good ending.
3135;overall I liked this movie a lot, and I do think this year it is one of the best films I have seen.
3136;I don't want to explain too much of the film because it is just so exciting and also creepy, so I'll just leave you with an exciting mystery.
3137;"He is very obsessed with this movie
3138;Donnie Darko is my favorite movie so I had to get it on my kindle so that I can watch it when ever the mood strikes again.
3139;One of the best movies I have ever seen and I've seen alot!
3140;Simply what storytelling is about making you question everything and keeps you pondering the whole time!
3141;I wasn't expecting much, but I have to say I really enjoyed it.
3142;Once you realize it's not a horror movie, but rather a reflective and philosophical one, it gets very enjoyable.
3143;If you like this movie, I'd also recommend The Butterfly Effect.
3144;The soundtrack is excellent, Jules and Kelly did a fantastic job meshing the song and the images together at the end, and it was at that moment.
3145;Because Frank saved his life, Donnie now must do what Frank tells him to do.
3146;But that's also why people love it.
3147;I honestly loved it because it unknowlingly re.
3148;fi like sound affects in the opening credits.
3149;And the topper comes at the montage/letter to Roberta Sparrow, a powerful intro to the famously poignant 'Mad World' sequence.
3150;the special features are another story (actually, the same).
3151;The least boring is the production diary with commentary by the cinematographer.
3152;A true cult classic that has additional scenes that were not included in the original release, a must for your collection.
3153;That's definately a positive note!
3154;This movie is absolutely brilliant and is one of the best movies ever made.
3155;Definately give this movie a chance if you're interested.
3156;I love this movie and showed a few other friends this one.
3157;It is confusing, but if you pay attention to just about every detail, it's a pretty impressive movie!
3158;Donnie Darko, the best movie of a recent year, is one of those films.
3159;donnie Darko is a fine film.
3160;One of the most interesting and original films in a long time.
3161;It's quite worth a watch, time after time.
3162;this movie is stunning, it grabs you, i highly reccommend it.
3163;donnie Darko is my son's favorite film.
3164;so, I bought it and watched it, last night, with my sweet hubby Norman.
3165;jake Gyllenhaal was perfect for this roll.
3166;the head down and look up, look.
3167;He was made for this roll!
3168;the girlfriend, also very good.
3169;I was pleasantly surprised to see Drew Barrymore, and Noah Willey as teachers.
3170;He has visions and sees his friend Frank.
3171;I """"got it"""" and got it all."""
3172;I watched your favorite movie, dear, and loved it!
3173;This is a genuine review of the Blu.
3174;This is a cult classic so I had to see it in HI.
3175;Very good conversion, not the best but good.
3176;Now, having some more time and patience, I gave this Director's Cut the careful attention it deserves, and the rewards are considerable.
3177;Moreover, he has a true artist's eye for shot composition, using the 2.5:1 anamorphic lens to maximum aesthetic and narrative effect in practically every frame.
3178;Still, the script is light years ahead of juvenilia time.
3179;"minute influential French film classic by Chris Marker: ""La Jetee."
3180;this is a film that celebrates choice.
3181;This is up there with Memento as one of the top films of last year.
3182;The 80's references were great.
3183;The music was amazing and haunting.
3184;The book puts a whole new twist on the movie.
3185;it is a very moving film about a troubled boy, but at the same time it is all in his mind.
3186;i found it very interesting.
3187;This movie is an interesting and provocative reflection about death and the role of death in our life.
3188;The actors go well and the script is well written.
3189;I watched this movie for free on YouTube, and it is fantastic.
3190;At first, I was turned off by the inappropriate dinner table conversation and foul language at the beginning of the film, but it really displays the disfunctionality of the family, which is important to the plot.
3191;"Everything is relevant, which is very much a schizophrenic experience
3192;The twist ending is really satisfying.
3193;His intelligence also plays a key factor in how amazing and yet ironic Donnie is portrayed.
3194;The actors, Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, etc, brilliantly showcased the anguish, pain, remote happiness that these characters dealt with.
3195;In most films,you never see the main character who has extraordinary intelligence, yet struggle with the same mind that gives them that same intelligence, plus the fact that he tries to find out more about what is making him have these visions of Frank, the demonic rabbit, is enduring.
3196;The concept of the end of the world/time travel is an amazing and original idea that I think, has never been captured so brilliantly in a film before.
3197;The fact that Donnie tried to find an explanation and then sacrifices his own life to give better ones to his girlfriend, family, etc. is touching.
3198;original than what I have seen in movies today.
3199;A very warm, disturbing, yet original film that has inspired me not to take for granted the mental health I have, the family I have, the life I live.
3200;It is my best and all.
3201;time favorite movie in my life.
3202;My favorite movie I have watched countless times.
3203;Dark, twisted, funny, charming, intriguing, meaningful.
3204;so many words in one movie.
3205;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
3206;the acting is great and extremely believeable, the story line is intriging, and the music and special effects are out of the ordinary.
3207;It's probably one of the most thought.
3208;The only other thing I want to say is that this movie is a bit disturbing, I know it disturbed me, but in the end it's worth it.
3209;So overall if you can stand feeling freaked out for a day or so, please do yourself a favor and order this movie now.
3210;I had never heard of this movie until a few weeks ago when a friend recommended it to me.
3211;I will be grateful to that friend for the rest of my life because this movie is honestly the most amazing film I have ever seen in my life.
3212;It was put together SO well, and Jake Gyllenhaal's acting is remarkable.
3213;But I think the movie was put together perfectly.
3214;The mystery of it is what makes it so unforgettable.
3215;The soundtrack is amazing as well.
3216;:) That's another good thing about this movie.
3217;Watch it, and really pay attention, and you will NOT be disappointed.
3218;The movie was first shown at Sundance Film Festival where it was met with a lot of enthusiasm and good reviews.
3219;But the plot and the movies 1980's surreal subburban setting are highly original.
3220;The production designer Alexander Hammond (""""K. pax"""", """"Men in Black II"""") did an excellent job of capturing various setting in which the story takes place."""
3221;"Surreal feel to the movie is greatly helped by the beautifull cinematography of Steven Poster (""Someone to watch over me"")."
3222;the movies cast is diverse.
3223;The lead role of Donnie Darko is extremly well performed by Jake Gyllenhaal, previously unknown actor to me.
3224;He does a nice job of playing an emotionally disturbed teenager and the best scenes are his confrontations with the rabbit.
3225;"in the roles of Donnies teachers among other we can see Noah Wyle (""E. r."") and Drew Barrymore and they did a good but not a memorable performances."
3226;The story is intentionaly left to open interpretation by the viewer which is great.
3227;If you are a fan of movies that require alot of thinking and paying attention to the entire story, I highly recommend this film.
3228;I've watched it at least 5 or 6 times now and still enjoy it everytime.
3229;First of all, you are probably wondering how such a great film could have flyed so long under the radar.
3230;"mothered"" the production of this first major film by writer and director, Richard Kelly, and because the budget was a measly $4 million, the project became a true labor of love incredible cast, which includes Jena Malone, Jake Gylennhal, and his sister Maggie (who would put in a tour de force a year later with 'Secretary'), Noel Wylie, Mary O'Donnell, and Patrick Swayze."
3231;This odd combination of one part comedy, two parts sci.
3232;fi comic, and three parts drama, which one reviewer described as David Lynch meets John Hughes, works.
3233;The plot is refreshingly subtle, refusing to hit you over the head like its Hollywood.
3234;"He meets a girl named Gretchen, and they find their first love
3235;You will love the scene where Donnie attends one of his seminars.
3236;This is a movie that should be watched without knowing, so that all the emotions it provokes come from inside you and not some reviewer or friend.
3237;it is both dark and enlightening, surreal and yet realistic, and definitely thought provoking.
3238;first of all, this really is an original film.
3239;Nowadays originality is very scarce in Hollywood.
3240;That's not necessarily good or bad, but it definitely helps with the cult status.
3241;It was very unpredictable, but things came together at the end .
3242;top, especially considering the well.
3243;While the viewer is at first presented with the old question of how much of what happens in the film is real or just in the protagonist's mind, it goes well beyond that before it's done.
3244;accompanied by the perfect song .
3245;but the great acting of Jake and the rest of the cast.
3246;this movie was very interesting the acting is great the storyline iS AMAZING and the great concept is that it is a mind screw movie.
3247;i defintly recommend the directors cut if you want the whole story line it is longer and more informative than the original.
3248;with the original you have to think and learn the movie yourself.
3249;if you really enjoy in depth characters who interact with each other very well and blend in you will love this.
3250;this version also has a lot more comedy that will brighten the movie.
3251;so please i advise you watch this movie either version and you will love it.
3252;I have seen it twice, and I am ready to see it again.
3253;This movie held my attention from the beginning to the mind.
3254;This one of those great movies that comes along every once in a while (the one's that rarely get much attention) and makes you stop and take a look at the world around you and even take a look at yourself.
3255;Not only for the full understanding of what is going on, but the full experience itself.
3256;It's eerie, creepy, beautiful, thought.
3257;I want to see more movies like this.
3258;Look closer, and you will see what I mean.
3259;what a unique, powerful film!
3260;There are scenes where I, a child of the 80's, laughed out loud in appreciation of references to that time.
3261;It is as unique as another great film, Memento.
3262;Donnie Darko is a great movie and deserves a ton of credit.
3263;Richard Kelly is 26 and this is his first film.
3264;All of the depth he put into this masterpiece took so much time and effort it's mind boggling.
3265;Everything about this movie is extremely well done.
3266;The cast is great, the score is eerie and enchanting.
3267;i recommend getting this movie, turning out the lights, and enjoying an awesome movie that will take your full range of emotions and thoughts for a wild ride.
3268;see you in the past.
3269;The performances are quite moving.
3270;It comes at you from interesting angles and the characters are subteley bizzare.
3271;The original film is much better because they don't put in all the hints and things that pop up basically explaining the movie for you.
3272;the original actually made you think and you could come up with your own idea of what is going on in this GREAT film.
3273;The Directors Cut tells you whats going on and what to believe.
3274;Avoid this version if you want the true experience.
3275;To be sure, the film is at times bizarre and quite weird, but also wildly original and inventive.
3276;for an articulate take on the movie.
3277;It took alot of processing to grasp the plot, but trust me, it was worth all of that thinking!
3278;jake Gyllenhaal was absolutely stunning in this film, I forgot it was him for most of this movie and he became Donnie Darko.
3279;i would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 12 or so, (I'm 13).
3280;It's mainly rated R forviolence (not gory though)some drug use (I fail to see the harm in this)sexual references (come on, these are teenagers)and profanity (and not just the mild ones)Overall though, it's an excellent movie and I'm dying to see it again.
3281;It's stunning to me sometimes how some films don't achieve more mainstream success than they do, but this is a beautiful film regardless.
3282;la of independent film: a treasure known to, and appreciated by, only those who not only stumble upon, but choose to explore it.
3283;Also, Jake Gyllenhal in a brilliant performance before teenie.
3284;this is by fatr 1 of the best movies i have ever seen.
3285;its hilarious, sad, and cool at the same time.
3286;What I can say is that Donnie Darko offers one of the best story's I've seen on the screen in a very long time.
3287;Great performances, a great supporting cast and a great storyline makes this one a winner in my book.
3288;now, with the new director's cut, we're offered more of this cult classic.
3289;Donnie Darko will amaze you, will leave you breathless, and will make you want to see this one again.
3290;Donnie Darko truly is a modern classic.
3291;Not only is Donnie Darko already the best movie ever, but the director's cut is amazing.
3292;If you've only seen the regular version this one has some scenes that will actually explain a lot, it goes deeper into the time travel theory,
3293;It has so many twists and turns that my head was almost spinning.
3294;Although many people have not heard of this movie I hope one day they will see it and enjoy it just as much as me.
3295;one subject that has not yet been explained that great in other movies before, is explained perfectly in this film.
3296;See this movie if you have not already and enjoy it for the first time, or again for another time.
3297;soory if you had trouble reading this review, thank you for your time.
3298;The story is deep, intriguing, and absolutely confusing.
3299;but in the best possible way.
3300;in the movie, Donnie is a teenage boy in therapy whose insanity one day hits an extreme: a rabbit named Frank tells him the world will end in 28 days.
3301;I can only recommend it and hope that others enjoy it as much as I have.
3302;Donnie Darko is a rare mixture of suspense, comedy, horror, European cinema with a twist, and then some.
3303;Donnie (played by Jake Gyllenhaal from Bubble Boy) is a bright student who's on therapy and visits his doctor who discovers Doonie's sleepwalking activities during a hypnosis session.
3304;He has a happy life and is not bitter about anything.
3305;life's more complicated than that.
3306;The movie is filled with these social observations.
3307;the movie keeps us interested, because there's a smooth flow of scenes, and it has scary moments, not based on violence and blood, but on suspense, mood, and wonder.
3308;The commentary track on this version is much better than those on the original .
3309;Aside from the commentary, the UK documentary and the #1 fan documentary are really interesting, the production diary less so.
3310;so, i view this set as all bonus features to be enjoyed by fans.
3311;The original is one of the best movies made.
3312;Except that because of it we get all the extra features, which do enhance the experience, ALOT.
3313;Yeah, the plot is a mind.
3314;Yeah the acting is superior and Maggie looks great.
3315;the portrayal of the 80's is spot on and sparked a quick trip down memory lane.
3316;Jake really took the role and ran with it.
3317;Donnie Darko is very original and thought.
3318;Donnie Darko is every bit as good as its praise, and better.
3319;Donnie Darko exploits these profound, resonant themes with a poignant touch.
3320;director Richard Kelly began his script as a stream of consciousness and worked backwards.
3321;bound of genres, science fiction, as lyric.
3322;known logic in favor of broad, painterly strokes.
3323;reverie, thriller, ghost story, drama, satire.
3324;Intentionally or accidentally, the film strikes the perfect balance between authenticity and mystique.
3325;with most of the former carried by Kelly's quirky, perfectly cast portrait (especially Jake Gyllenhaal) of a dynamic, intelligent and caring family who at once exemplify and transcend the typical foibles of the upper middle class.
3326;It's a clever extension of the historical.
3327;travel story about the fate of the universe that's uniquely timebound and never leaves the hero's neighborhood, keeping our attention on its characters' hearts and minds.
3328;Because the film never resorts to a facile description of its own logic (a sometimes annoying """"shortcoming"""" of life itself), the well."""
3329;We wake, with the whole town, from the film's dream logic to its final, tragic consequence.
3330;Because we're never comforted with a solution, our empathy stays squarely with Donnie, as we join his struggle to understand man's place and purpose in a universe where Everyone Dies Alone.
3331;as I said in the title, this is truly a brilliant film.
3332;Its depth and originality provide something so rare in modern cinema that simply watching this movie makes one feel like one has tripped through the mud of popular movies and inadvertently kicked up a small piece of gold.
3333;The main character, aptly named Donnie Darko, faces not only these universal dilemmas but also his own schizophrenia.
3334;The brilliance of this film could never be properly conveyed in words alone.
3335;up of a human eyeball twitching.
3336;There is honestly no reason for this nonsense to be edited into such an excellent movie.
3337;Donnie Darko is a great movie for kids to watch on Easter because it has a rabbit in it.
3338;Absolutely one of the best movies of this generation.
3339;The first is that you will want to discuss the movie in detail with anyone who has seen it.
3340;And the second is that you will want to watch the movie again to try to answer questions you have come up with.
3341;Though I try to stay away from pop culture I am very excited to see this movie come back into the light.
3342;With a little extra time from added scenes, it makes the movie that much more enjoyable!
3343;A big difference is the sound track.
3344;to be honest, i first heard of this movie from a friend who had gone to see it.
3345;donnie darko possibly is the most creative and original movie in existance.
3346;the most intriguing aspect of Donnie Darko is its enigmatic and ominous nature.
3347;this alien concept is fantastic .
3348;the audience is left confused, yet they are still entertained.
3349;the compelling storyline draws you to think for hours upon hours of what the movie was about.
3350;the scary thing is, you do what you're told.
3351;another fantastic aspect is Kelly's portrayal of Donnie's environment.
3352;kelly successfully and effectively manages to convey modern.
3353;the movie follows donnie and how he deals with his new look on his life.
3354;with credit to acting, gyllenhaal makes an undoubtedly memorable performance.
3355;it's also VERY chilling .
3356;this movie WILL be remembered in years to come .
3357;you will believe that anything is possible.
3358;Part satirical social commentary, part psychological thriller, part time travel sci.
3359;defying beauty of Donnie Darko.
3360;It springs effortlessly across themes to create a gorgeously ominous atmosphere.
3361;I expected to see a good movie with the all star star cast.
3362;It really hit the spot.
3363;It blows away much more gory thrillers with it's tense building rhythm and shocking insights into the mind of a disturbed young man.
3364;like appearances really make you shiver.
3365;Anyone who likes Johnny The Homicidal Maniac would absolutely love this movie.
3366;It has the same dark humor and twists.
3367;i was somewhat expecting a more violent end like perhaps a school shooting but the finale is infinately more surprising and thoughtful.
3368;this movie has a very original plot, especially amongst those pillars of remakes and sequels we are compelled to watch every year, here we have a unique case in demonstrating ideas, to cover the plot with a quilt of pseudoscience as a metaphor of our direct perceptions.
3369;if you like that movie I strongly recommend.
3370;the film moves effortlessly from horror to science fiction to psychological drama, and does so successfully.
3371;i recognised Jake Gyllenhaal fs face just because a week ago I just saw the film gThe Day After Tomorrow h and I liked his performance.
3372;I had an gimaginary h friend who was absolutely real to me and always said what I thought the truth.
3373;"Anyway, through every story he wrote, I thought I got the message
3374;So, in the end (or the beginning), Donnie smiles contentedly because he now knows everything he should know as a human being.
3375;i think that thought is beautiful.
3376;It makes this film poignant and yet, somehow, soothing on each view.
3377;I should follow that up by saying every single person who I told to watch the movie loved it and raved about it to their friends, who in turn fell in love with the adventures of Donnie.
3378;the cast is superb, the script is perfect, the score is beautifully haunting, and Richard Kelly displays an enormous talent in directing his first major film.
3379;There are numerous moments where you just can't believe how good, or how touching, or how poignant, or how mysterious, or how perfect a scene is.
3380;It is packed with special features, some are wonderful (the Mad World music video and the deleted scenes with director commentary,) some are unnecessary (a picture of the soundtrack.)
3381;The commentaries for the feature are an excellent complement to the film.
3382;The camaraderie that you feel between them is wonderful, and the movie is seen as a labor of love for each person.
3383;this movie makes a wonderful addition to anyone's collection.
3384;The reasons he did give were so incredibly dissapointing and plainly idiotic.
3385;It is amazing how people let their imaginations run wild in trying to decifer reasons.
3386;this is a good film to watch while reading your favorite book on a comfy couch.
3387;provoking and compulsively WATCHABLE this movie is.
3388;I've watched it three times, and know I will watch it again at least three more times.
3389;The story is incredible, and the concepts which are fully fleshed.
3390;out (but still left for the viewer to discover) are fascinating.
3391;the genius of this film is that all of the elements are IN the picture, but it's up to the audience to piece it together, and once they DO it still leaves lots of room for alternate theories.
3392;thought about what it all means all the more captivating.
3393;Despite being extremely confusing, it absolutely rivets you to your seat with suspense and slowly reveals the truth.
3394;There are clues carefully placed throughout the movie alluding to what's coming.
3395;It deals in time travel, the butterfly effect, and the whole """"what would happen if certain events in the past didn't happen or were changed"""" thing."""
3396;well, I say, what we have here is a good movie with a loyal following.
3397;donnie Darko is an interesting movie.
3398;a lot of the situations are real and fun to watch.
3399;Donnie Darko is a film that will have you thinking about it weeks after you first saw it.
3400;This film is incredible in the way it makes you doubt.
3401;"But expect one thing about this film
3402;All I know is I've seen it now three times in the past two days, and I must own this movie in the near future.
3403;Intelligent, witty, altering, and incredible.
3404;I've seen some very good movies, but this one is now fighting its way on my top three of all time.
3405;I also fear that this was the intention of the director.
3406;i think it's an indication of under developed appreciation of art to have to add some sort of logic to things like this movie.
3407;Simple style and mood, hints at motivation, and bizarre imagery are fine on there own.
3408;A story that will haunt you as will the score and the title song.
3409;You all honestly think this a great film.
3410;beat, quirky, and very dark.
3411;Those who are patient will find that there is a payoff at the end.
3412;I recently watched the Director's Cut and found myself thinking that the original was slightly better.
3413;The director's cut adds 20 minutes to the original movie.
3414;though I did enjoy hearing the title track and cover of Tears For Fears' """"Mad World"""" by Gary Jules."""
3415;To my surprise this Richard Kelly script delivered a stark and sterile vision of life though often over.
3416;"tall rabbit of ""Harvey (1950)"" into the setting of darker ""Magnolia (1999)"" and its self help videos, with a dash of Alan Ball (American Beauty/Six Feet Under) into a blender, but comes out original and enjoyable."
3417;just watch and discover it for yourself.
3418;It will be good to see if Richard Kelly can continue this creative and smart style of filmmaking.
3419;the story, the soundtrack, the acting, and the cinematography.
3420;I'll leave it to others to describe the movie further, but this really is one of those movies that stay with you for awhile.
3421;It is genuinely creepy, surreal, intelligent, original, and an Echo and the Bunnymen song opens the movie.
3422;'Donnie Darko' is one of those movies that I know I will return to, to view again and again.
3423;"tech visual feast with the most outstanding screenplay this side of ""The Pledge"" _and_ it's a perfect evocation of 80's culture."
3424;a truly dark and original film.
3425;"The feeling of ""Donnie Darko"" was very similar to elements of sound and cinematography of those two films."
3426;If you are of the same ilk then this is destined to be a favorite of yours.
3427;It bacame an instant favorite of mine.
3428;I will await Richard Kelly's next work with anticipation.
3429;He is an outstanding newcomer.
3430;I love this movie how ever i think the regular cut is much better.
3431;star masterpiece people on the internet are making it out to be.
3432;it amuses me to see how many people give this movie 5.
3433;Where, then, does that put the truly suspenseful and original films of people like Polanski, Kubrick, Hitchock, Murnau and other masters?It also cracks me up to see how anybody who posts a negative review of Donnie Darko gets slammed with negative votes .
3434;In fact, I'm going for the record, please help me reach it.
3435;this is a good idea for a movie with a great sense of atmosphere, but Donnie acts likes a jerk most of the time.
3436;Richard Kelly is an interesting director.
3437;"up to ""Donnie"" deserves half the accolades his debut won, it should be the greatest movie of the decade."
3438;This is not only one of the most interesting screenplays I've ever seen, it is one of the most impressive debuts since Orson Welles did Citizen Kane.
3439;Written and Directed by Richard Kelly, it features an all.
3440;Not only is it extremely reasonably priced, but it has great features, like 2 insightful and funny commentaries, and deleted scenes, and more.
3441;This movie is one of the greatest films of all time, and is worthy of so many viewings, that it never gets tiring.
3442;Its so much more than that psychological thriller that it is advertised as.
3443;It is a plethora of origniality, bursting at the seams with wonderful directing, cinematography, music, and editing.
3444;provoking movies I've ever seen, DONNIE DARKO is smart, funny, and brave.
3445;the filming style is gorgeous, the story is fantastic and in the end you're left feeling like a surfer who's just been plowed over by an enormous wave.
3446;This movie takes you on a trip you won't soon forget.
3447;The bunny is one of the coolest characters i've seen in film.
3448;This is a great mind.
3449;it is one of those few movies where after you finish watching it you want and need to watch it again just to figure half of it out.
3450;the dialogue and acting is excellent with one exception.
3451;Well worth it for fans of the bizarre and obscure.
3452;Donnie Darko is one of the more unique movies out there.
3453;The story line is truly original, and every piece of imagery and dialogue kept me thinking.
3454;It's not that Donnie Darko was overly complex, just an intelligent film that leaves you with lots of things to think about.
3455;This is definitely one that I will watch again.
3456;You do need to carefully watch some parts to see how it all fits together and at the end, you will be faces with putting the pieces in back, but it is not crazy complex.
3457;Maybe it was the perfect casting.
3458;everyone of the younger actors shines.
3459;This film could possibly go down as the greatest film on teenage detachment ever made.
3460;Echo and The Bunnymen's `The Killing Moon' is a perfect and very haunting opus.
3461;handled inappropriately into the film.
3462;It comes off as a thuggish way to treat the original, without doubt.
3463;Typically though, almost every modern classic has been panned or mishandled and sometimes this just adds to the beauty and the lore that follows the film ever after.
3464;donnie Darko will surely be remembered as his masterpiece.
3465;Having attended both of those in my life, I do not elevate one over the other but enjoyed both equally.
3466;everything about the Theatrical Release of Donnie Darko is pure magic and the stuff of great filmmaking.
3467;Kelly's writing here leaves just enough for the viewers imagination without spoon.
3468;This movie is dark and intense and a lot on the weird side.
3469;From the beginning you are wondering where it's going, and you don't really ever find out, but [gosh] this is a great movie!
3470;This movie is a work of art and at the end it really makes you wonder, not just about the movie, but about the purpose of life.
3471;If you like intense, unpredictable, dark movies, you will love this one!
3472;This is one of the weirdest, most original films that I have seen in a long time!
3473;"Jake Gyllenhaal gives his best performance since ""October Sky"", and Jena Malone and Patrick Swayze are great, also."
3474;"this film is not for everyone, but for those of you who liked ""Vanilla Sky"", ""Memento"", and ""Requiem for a Dream"", this is most definitely a treat!"
3475;Donnie Darko is a film that is incredibly complex?
3476;Everything comes together so perfectly so that Donnie will save the world and die for people's sins.
3477;go and watch the movie again.
3478;It's a love story, a science.
3479;Donnie Darko has just the right blend of quirky characters, scientific fascination, and narrative ambiguity to make it an instant cult classic.
3480;While never quite as successful as its bigger budget cousins .
3481;"darkly offbeat films such as ""Being John Malkovich"", ""Magnolia"" or the work of David Lynch ."
3482;it's nevertheless a highly original and ambitious first feature which manages to impress.
3483;As does Jake Gyllenhaal, turning in a wonderfully unnerving performance as the troubled Donnie, his innocent looks making his behaviour even more chilling.
3484;Dark, provocative and thoroughly entertaining.
3485;and also opened up a whole other world if you will.
3486;donnie is the independent one, who is smart enough to challange the norm, and stand up for what he believes.
3487;very good film holds your attention, with some comedic moments, from whimsical to some off color comments that like I said are kids being kids, not always polite, and the music.
3488;the music makes this film all the more enjoyable.
3489;An amazing film to watch , even if you are not able to understand it like me, the whole concept.
3490;at least makes you want to understand it little by little, even if you are distracted by great characters in interesting situations throughout this time.
3491;And is the world really going to end in twenty.
3492;The only aspect of the film that comes off as being a positive is the strong acting.
3493;Simply put, this movie is mesmerizing.
3494;I'm sure you have read about the plot from other reviews so I will spare you the details.
3495;It's complexity is mind bending and leaves you wondering what could possibly explain what happened.
3496;The story gives you just enough to make you think you know what is happening until the ending which sends your mind racing back wondering what you just witnessed.
3497;The performances by the entire cast are exceptional.
3498;In summary Donnie Darko does something that I think all great movies do.
3499;This was a strangely hypnotic movie .
3500;but in a good way.
3501;line schizophrenic teen, gets you totally into the movie right from the start.
3502;What a freakin' great film this is!!
3503;Very funny, very moving, very thought provoking, interesting themes and ideas are generated in this film.
3504;Easily the best indie film of 2001.
3505;Oh, and as for ol' Patrick Swayze, don't worry he is not the main focus of this movie, plus he receives a splendid demise in the end.
3506;The small town feel adds to the movie's ambience and the Patrick Swayze scenes crack me up every time.
3507;It's one of my favorite films, and so when the Director's Cut came out, I was super.
3508;"Don't get me wrong
3509;the main difference I think, is the amount of explanation.
3510;The theatrical release is very ambiguous, very unapologetic, and very unexplained.
3511;again, this is a fine film, so if this is the only version you watch, you'll probably love it.
3512;Donnie Darko makes you think, makes you wonder, and makes you believe that just about anything is possible.
3513;The characters are complex, the story is intriguing and the acting is outstanding.
3514;Possibly one of the most original alternative films I've seen in the past years, Donnie Darko is a powerful mind stimulator.
3515;cutting script combined with intimidating acting and careful directing is what you get here but the more thoughtful viewers will also be awarded with valuable and out of the mainstream questions.
3516;He understands with the help of his """"friend"""" that nothing you see and observe is accidental."""
3517;Which is yet another asset of the movie: it is as frank and honest as it gets.
3518;the young actor who plays Donnie Darko is utterly convincing allthough he has his show stolen by his mother who adds the necessary down.
3519;earthness to it all with her refreshing performance.
3520;i'll tell you how good this film was.
3521;Man, I've loved this movie ever since word spread about it being a must.
3522;The plot is easier to understand and music is better.
3523;jacobs Ladder is a masterpiece of cinema, and so is the 6th sense.
3524;this on the other hand, is like giving a camera and a pen to a bunch of film students and asking them to create a clone of the films i mentioned.
3525;i have seen some poor movies in my time, but what amazes me the most here is the sheer contrast of the 'excellent reviews' and whats actually on offer.
3526;it doesnt work, 'it doesnt go'.
3527;And I loved this movie.
3528;Even if you don't like the movie, you'll love him .
3529;Some big named actors could take some lessons from him :) And I got the soundtrack to the movie which is haunting and beautiful.
3530;This one I will watch many, many times.
3531;First off: I love this movie.
3532;ray, and that's the whole point in having a film on blu.
3533;Being a filmmaker, I have found an immense respect for Richard Kelly and I really can't express it enough.
3534;Donnie Darko us undeniably one of the most underrated movies ever created.
3535;It combines every genre and packs it into one movie.
3536;(Rarely achieved successfully by a director with obvious influences from Stanley Kubrick and David Lynch and even Spielberg himself and yes, this director can be compared to greatness.)
3537;The 80's musical score was perfect as well as every aspect of the film.
3538;For his first Directing gig, this director reminds me of a young Orson Welles.
3539;His work is truly amazing!
3540;Well, this experience should be right up there!Ultimately, this is an esoteric piece that will make you want to re.
3541;watch it the second it's over to try and figure it out .
3542;That said, it's a wonderful coming.
3543;"This is almost two films in one: a highly spiritual film about time and space
3544;bound about having the courage to be your own person, and about questioning everything before excepting blindly.
3545;The two themes are magnificently bound together in a visually stunning, and breathtakingly acted film.
3546;he's right up there with Toby Maguire.
3547;one of the best films I've seen in the past few years.
3548;but also, I thought the movie was fairly interesting.
3549;Still, I think this movie is a great thing to see.
3550;Under the influence of Frank, Donnie develops an interest in time travel and studies it.
3551;This happens right after my favorite scene in the movie where Frank takes off his mask.
3552;the film has an excellent soundtrack including one of my favorite songs, """"Head Over Heels."""""""
3553;Even when it's bright daylight outside, the movie manages to keep its dark feeling.
3554;the movie is kind of written like a Star Trek episode with all of the time traveling business.
3555;It's got a lot of imagination put into it, and I think everybody can appreciate that.
3556;I love twisted movies .
3557;All my family and friends who say they love this movie cant even explain it to me.
3558;Its so good cuz of the cast.
3559;Oooo its so good cuz that bunny is so crazy.
3560;The colors are so cool.
3561;The soundtrack is really good.
3562;An observation about the power of love?
3563;this is a very unique and memorable film.
3564;there are very few films that successfully achieve a vintage feel mixed with a more modern philosophical outlook.
3565;because of this, Donnie Darko was destined for cult classic status from the start.
3566;the soundtrack, the style, the look and feel are all on point.
3567;aside from the visual presentation there is certainly something more.
3568;notably, this film marked the arrivals of Jake Gyllenhaal, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Jena Malone.
3569;this inclusion of 80s icons successfully strengthens the legitimacy of the throwback aesthetic.You can see Richard Kelly had a vision and he brought it to the screen.
3570;in Spielberg fashion, the film focuses on a family unit in the middle of America.
3571;in a quest for understanding, Donnie converses with his therapist, questions the science teacher, listens to Joy Division, and celebrates halloween.
3572;all of these activities contribute to Donnie's potential grasp on the very complex structure of time and space.
3573;donnie Darko's ability to transcend cultural eras could be considered time travel in it's own right.
3574;overall, a fun thoughtful mental expedition.
3575;as with all great adventures, it's about the journey and not necessarily the destination.
3576;if you appreciate cult films, Darko is required viewing.
3577;Hours later, the office building has been reduced to a pile of rubble, and a job has been well done.
3578;this is incredible, smart filmmaking.
3579;set in the Fall of 1988, the movie is about personal transformation and how through your own personal transformation you can change the world.
3580;In a world that believes acquisition leads to happiness?
3581;which is why he laughs and smiles at the end of the movie.
3582;is that meaning is found through your creative engagement with life and through the mark you leave on the world.
3583;"the song ""Mad World"" truly encapsulates the thematic concerns of the movie beautifully."
3584;The music video, included as a special feature, is valuable in itself.
3585;'Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut' (2005) offers audiences a restructured vision of the extraordinary 2001 Richard Kelly film, which stands with 'Haxan' (1922), 'Freaks' (1932), 'I Walked With A Zombie' (1942), 'Beauty And The Beast' (1947), 'Curse of the Demon' (1958), 'Eyes Without A Face' (1960), 'The Innocents' (1961), 'Carnival of Souls' (1962), 'The Birds' (1963), 'Blue Velvet' (1985), and 'Faust' (1994) as one of the greatest fantastic films ever created.
3586;spirited dialogue Donnie's peers direct towards one another weakens the satiric and parodic humor of the original.
3587;as a result of these changes and others, a clever, multi.
3588;faceted, fairly original, and genuinely tragic film has become a muddy, unfocused, and protracted exercise in the unthreatening and the banal.
3589;maligned Hollywood executive machine has actually strengthened a creative work through forcible tampering.
3590;"bonus ""special features,"" such as ""They Made Me Do It."
3591;Some scenes cut from the original are quite simple, but still, very emotional and should have never left the movie in the first place.
3592;The soundtrack is just the way the director had originally intended, and they also had more time to work with the special effects.
3593;As for me, I liked to know what the director's idea for what was behind the events that happened in the movie was.
3594;one thing is clear for me: The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko is one of my favorite movies EVER.
3595;when I first watched this movie, I found myself caught in between liking and hating it.
3596;I loved the character Donnie Darko: Although he was suppose to be mentally disturbed, I found him to be very perceptive, witty, intelligent, and one of the most sane people in the entire movie, challenging those who failed to see things the way they really are .
3597;I loved many of the other characters as well: His girlfriend, his two sisters, his father and mother and many others, the teacher Drew Barrymore plays, Patrick Swayze's character, and the old woman who keeps walking back and forth to the mailbox to check for mail that is never there, almost getting hit by cars passing by .
3598;to jump to the end to find out where all of this was leading, but I avoided the temptation, watching with irritation with the slow pace, and fascination for the eerie use of sound and special effects drawing me deeper in.
3599;i got to the end, and everything was suppose to wrap up neatly .
3600;and the ending was more satisfying, and some of my impressions were confirmed.
3601;Let me just start off by saying I love this movie.
3602;"After several viewings and much thought, all I can say about this movie, in seven words or less is, ""My God, what a totally fantastic flick!"""
3603;linear moments which occur throughout, I can seriously say this is certainly one of the most unique, touching, and mind.
3604;That's saying a lot because my list of such top films of all times includes dozens of great films, too many to name here.
3605;this is a small and independent but yet, GREAT movie, and is a must.
3606;Donnie Darko, if you see it and you enjoy it upon initially watching it and re.
3607;watching it as I did (and still do), is a strange, wonderful enigma of a film, which you will come back to, for further and deeper appreciation.
3608;With the rather obtuse at times, and certainly non.
3609;progressive temporal structure however, repeated viewings and closer attention, almost seems essential for a full appreciation of this masterpiece.
3610;ish example of what Hollywood/Independent cinema can be, and mandatory viewing for any real, thought.
3611;"stimulating movie fan,"" or ""it is a complete and enlightening surprise from beginning to end,"" but I will instead just give my totally personal opinion (with a lot more words) that this is a film which everyone should see at least once."
3612;Because I loved this movie the very first time I saw it, and watching it again has only reinforced that opinion.
3613;"interpret this, or dismiss it entirely from a possible feeling of just being too lazy to simply THINK, to me, ""Donnie Darko"" is simply amazing."
3614;i came to eventually see this film long after its original release and subsequent impact, as I have so many other great movies, but in the new century, That does not diminish its importance and meaning to me as a truly great cinematic effort in the long run, and this new century film holds up very well, with anything from the last few decades.
3615;It is a one of a kind, at the very least, and I only wish more modern.
3616;day films came to equal this cinematic excellence.
3617;i could go on to list the many stars and their fine performances, including Jake Gyllenhaal (our teen.
3618;And their characters all perform key roles in the overall whole.
3619;Donnie Darko is one of the best films I've seen this century.
3620;It is strange, open for debate as to meaning, but entertaining and compelling throughout.
3621;"The film style is original and effective, the soundtrack and appropriate ""songs"" right."
3622;on, and the whole film, while dealing with some rather disturbing and/or depressing subjects, is a winner from frame one to the last frame.
3623;an unforgettable experience, I watched this in amazement the first time, and have since, upon every repeated viewing.
3624;"One of a kind, tight, and almost perfectly presented from beginning to end, along with a near perfect cast, directorial style, and musical background, ""Donnie Darko"" is truly a must."
3625;"What it all really ""means"" in the end, is up to the viewer, which makes it forever more a total and timeless winner."
3626;I thought Donnie Darko was a great portrayal of how we long for so much more than we usually take the time to realize in life.
3627;"Donnie chooses his own death in order to save his girlfriend not because it his simply the path he chooses, but because it is one of those moments that in the words of the movie ""reminds you beautiful the world can be."""
3628;most of all, I found this movie to be BORING.
3629;Richard Kelly's 2001 film, Donnie Darko, has both an impressive cast list and a thought.
3630;Jake Gyllenhaal, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Drew Barrymore, and Patrick Swayze star in the movie.
3631;It boasts elements of romance, mystery, horror, drama, and comedy while acting as a relevant social commentary.
3632;rebuking simplified views of morality and emotion, this film promotes free.
3633;kelly masterfully crafted the atmosphere of the movie and its significance to the storyline.
3634;jake Gyllenhaal's acting fits flawlessly into the movie's atmosphere as well.
3635;He appropriately balances emotional expression, the awkwardness of a high.
3636;Its style and depth are reminiscent of other great thoughtful works, such as Fight Club and A Clockwork Orange.
3637;Truly, though, Donnie Darko is a rare film that I believe anyone can enjoy if they watch it with the right mindset.
3638;it is a complex and intuitive piece that refuses to hold back its blows at society's conceptions of good and evil.
3639;Even within the serious context of its message, Donnie Darko supplies plenty of laughs and holds its place as one of the most influentially entertaining movies of the 2000s.
3640;He has a vision and his oddball family can't see it.
3641;The originality deserves a lot of credit and the performances are brilliant.
3642;Drew Barrymore in a good movie?
3643;The supporting actors including Patrick Swayze!
3644;The main character played by Jake Gyllenhaal (the son on City Slickers ) does a good job of playing a psychotic teenager and this movie sets its own standards as a 'teen picture'.
3645;Just kidding, kick back and relax and be nice to rabbits.
3646;Things are purposefully left ambiguous, yet there is an undeniable internal logic that holds the many threads (and clashing movie genres) together.
3647;That is, if you're an incredibly gifted screenwriter and director like Richard Kelly.
3648;This film DEMANDS repeat viewings, as it reveals entire layers of meaning each time you watch it, and can easily make you obsessed.
3649;Both Noah Wylie and Drew Barrymore give the performances of their respective careers, Maggie Jyllenhaal, Jake's real.
3650;life sister, is wonderful as Donnie's sister, and the rest of the cast is equally good.
3651;however, Jake Gyllenhaal really shines in the title role, as a hesitant teen with family troubles and a tough time socializing who is 1) either caught in a wild time.
3652;His halting manner, his hesitant voice, his odd tics, and most of all, his incredibly expressive eyes manage to convey a very troubled teenager who you can still empathize with.
3653;It's a tour de force performance, particularly from an actor that was only 19.20 when the film was shot.
3654;Donnie Darko is the rare film that manages the nearly impossible task of having a mind, a heart, and a soul, in roughly equal measures.
3655;I was curious to see what everyone was raving about, so I decided to give it a whirl.
3656;There were quite a few funny parts though .
3657;one being a funny smurf conversation.
3658;Fantastic and original, creative movie !!

3666;This movie was entertaining for the entire duration.
3667;The Director's Cut is an interesting opportunity to learn more about the original intent of the movie's creators and brought me back for a 3rd and 4th viewing.
3668;Donnie Darko is an incredible film.
3669;I had to watch it a few times, not just to fully understand what the movie's message was, but because it was just that good.
3670;If you're in the mood for an entertaining film that causes you to think without being pretentious, pick this one up.
3671;I would have given this movie only one star, but the untouted appearnce of Maggie Gyllenhall (Jake's real life sister), the star of """"Secretary"""" is worth at least on additional star."""
3672;Instead I will tell you about my family and this movie.
3673;He said it was really good and he was looking for it to come up again.
3674;He said we HAD to see it.
3675;The next morning my husband was shaking his head with a smile on his face and saying that the movie was good but quirky.
3676;He wanted to see it again, as did my daughter.
3677;When it was over I got up and complained to my sleeping son that I was now hooked, late for work, and it was all his fault.
3678;It is entertaining, rich with character and plot development, engaging, addicting, and after you watch it, you can't stop thinking about it.
3679;My son said, he loved it, awesome.
3680;It was both funny, and chilling at the same time.
3681;Without spoiling the end of the flick for those who haven't seen it, I do encourage you to check it out.
3682;but, I totally get the end, it was fantastic.
3683;I saw it on cable, one of the reviews said they has watched the commentary a second time around, and connecting the dots was very well put.
3684;I can very much see how this flick has and will become a cult classic.
3685;This is a great movie and well deserves the cult status that it has.
3686;Great to watch on a stormy night with a group of open minded people, and people who have experienced angst.
3687;Thanks for the great service.
3688;Donnie Darko is definitely not one of these filmsDonnie Darko is one of those rare gems that combine a subtle Lynch.
3689;esque dark humour with a nihilistic view of the trivialities of society, and what is considered 'normal' behaviour.
3690;the acting is amazing, and the plot is superbly driven.
3691;The movie succeeds in walking a fine line between many genres, without ever being dominated by one .
3692;It is a very accessable film, despite all the bizzarre inclusions and enigmatic prose.
3693;down, I honestly thought that it was a good strong ending that answered many of the film's plot points, but left the more important loose ends free for the viewer to interpret, and in keeping with the rest of the movie, was bitter.
3694;particular highlights are the first time Donnie sees evidence of time travel, the conversation that he has with Frank in the cinema, the disturbingly realistic twist of the Jim Cunningham character, and the voyeuristic peek into many of the characters alone while a melancholy cover of 'Mad World' is played.
3695;The performances in this movie are exquisite.
3696;The talent in this movie is top notch and Gyllenhall is just amazing.
3697;People will either love it, or despise it with all their heart.
3698;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone who has a taste for dark humor and a desire to put the pieces of the puzzle together over and over, long after the movie has ended.
3699;A ultimate trip on your senses, and a wild ride for your imadgination.

3708;words cant describe how much i love this movie.
3709;it made me think, laugh, and cry.
3710;it took me 2 times of seeing it to understand it, but each time i watch it, i find something new.
3711;i just to say excelent edition, very complete, and the best is the most mysterious movie that i have seen!!
3712;During the first twenty minutes or so, I found DONNIE DARKO to be fairly interesting and even somewhat entertaining.
3713;Now after reading a few reviews here, I can see how the whole dream.
3714;thing fits in and the movie sort.
3715;But, the thing about dreams is, nobody really likes watching other people's dreams.
3716;Dreams are very personal and usually should be kept that way.
3717;Patrick Swayze is one of the big names who has a secondary role in the film.
3718;Drew is a brilliant young actress, but in this movie she sucks.
3719;I personally couldn't stand it after the first twenty minutes, but thought the reptilian rabbit head was creative enough to be worth a glance.
3720;Jake Gyllenhaal did a great job however.
3721;Nice to see him and Maggie working together.
3722;The outcome is a highly original film that dives into fundamental questions of life itself, all of which makes great entertainment.
3723;with a strong cast that includes Patrick Swayze as an ultra.
3724;conservative emotional speaker, Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore as Donnie's progressive English and science teachers, Maggie Gyllenhaal (Jake's real.
3725;"Its most talked about song, ""Mad World"" an excellent remake of the Tears for Fears classic by Gary Jules, is absolutely haunting when played near the film`s conclusion."
3726;"in all, ""Donnie Darko"" is a great movie to watch on Friday or Saturday night with all the lights turned off, and possibly a cup of coffee once it's ended to talk about it."
3727;"Like a good wine, ""Donnie Darko"" has become more popular since its subdued release in 2001, and with time, has only gotten better."
3728;A movie like this just shows you that there are new and fresh ideas out there if Hollywood would just stop making sequel after sequel and rehashing of old TV shows.
3729;If you've never seen this flick, make sure you set aside time to watch it twice.
3730;Quirky, but plot and acting rock solid.
3731;from execution, to climax, the movie is phenomenal.
3732;Unlike other teen flicks, Donnie Darko is in fact one of the most elegantly done teen science fiction movies I have ever seen.
3733;A wonderful blend of science fiction, fantasy, and macabre I highly recommend Donnie Darko.
3734;Fun to watch, entertaining, interesting and Im glad I have this in my collection!
3735;so typical teenage boy, Donnie Darko, who is played by the(gorgeous and talented)Jake Gyllenhaal.
3736;As the movie progresses, the many subplots, such as town idol and motivational speaker Jim Cunningham, Gretchen Ross and her relationship with Donnie, and Sparkle Motion, the youngest Darko's dance squad, keep the movie from feeling stale.
3737;The movie strikes the perfect balance between being funny, sad, and scary.
3738;I will also note that it DOES contain the Director's cut so the converse is true.
3739;Though I prefer the theatrical version, the Director's cut is worth a viewing just so you can make up your own mind!
3740;I personally loved this film.
3741;The story is really complicated.
3742;"This movie is EXTREMELY well acted, directed, written, photographed
3743;I recommend it to everyone: horror fans, sci.
3744;fi fans, or anyone who appreciates good cinema.
3745;Watch the director's cut now and it will be easier for you to employ more thought.
3746;It's fantastic and ironic even if you're not trying to delve into its implications of divine intervention, time travel, and greed.
3747;It means that everybody is in an experiment on their mind.
3748;The bunny has a time warp on it to meld the mind back together.
3749;Your """"helpful"""" votes are greatly appreciated."""
3750;Thanks, and note that a short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a great movie.
3751;I've just noted the general theme.
3752;travel movie, involving other dimensions, is great.
3753;I was surprised that I liked it so much.
3754;when so many movies are the same, it's nice to find something original, and I hope to see more such efforts.
3755;There are many, and I went through a sort of cycle to understand what the film was trying to say:First I thought it was a film conveying the decay of modern society through metaphor.
3756;"They are out there
3757;Honestly, to me, it was all three rolled into one genius cult flick.
3758;i'm a big fan of films that attempt to tackle so much, because 1) it makes me think and approach aspects of my own psyche and 2) it offers more interesting cinema than the normalcy of peaceful narrative.
3759;It's even better when the film manages to pull off every one of its goals, especially with engaging symbolism and beautifully crafted twists and turns.
3760;This one is a challenging treat for the mind and eyes
3761;this new director's cut makes the film less opaque and adds an element of the """"Twilight Zone"""" to Kelly's rich, original vision."""
3762;That's tragic as this totally original film makes an impression whether you're watching the original version or the director's cut of the film.
3763;Donnie Darko lives up to its title with a number of unusually dark images.
3764;There's nothing we can do about and Fox has done the best with what they were given.
3765;fox wisely put all the extras on disc two of this set allowing the film to benefit from the extra disc space.
3766;There's also a commentary track by Director of Photography Steven Poster in the Donnie Darko Production Diary which provides an interesting insider's perspective and lots of trivia about the production of the film.

3771;"a fascinating commentary track by Director Kelly who discusses his film with fellow Director Kevin Smith (""Clerks"")."
3772;It's, at turns, informative, philosophical and very involving.
3773;The meaning of Kelly's film is still, ultimately, open to debate and while the film may be a bit less ambiguous than the first theatrical cut, its also got its fair share of great moments as well.
3774;The first disc comes with a terrific commentary track by Kelly and Director Kevin Smith.
3775;The second has all the extras including a documentary on the making of the movie, a glimpse at the fandom following this unusual cult film.
3776;We also get to see the film that won the contest for #1 Donnie Darko fan.
3777;While it's not something to crow about it is an interesting look at what levels the fans of this unusual and great little movie will go to.
3778;This i'm afraid is one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen.
3779;Well it seems the general premise of the movie was to be clever, just like a lot of bands, and tv shows try to be, or speak cleverly to prove its something unique.
3780;Anyways movies like this just make me wonder how people can try and come up with ideas, and i think to myself wow i could come up with something ten times more clever.
3781;"Easily one of the most thoughtful films of all time, made with such TLC and intimacy that the crew MUST have been looking at themselves during filming and said ""do you realize what a masterpiece this is going to be?"""
3782;Sounds outrageous, I know, but it's true!
3783;The film is train running in a circle, and we are simply dropped onto it in the middle of its run.
3784;Nothing can prepare you for this.
3785;Like jumping onto a moving train, it helps to have a running start.

3791;Obviously theatre audiences from 2001 agree with me.
3792;And make it more understandable.
3793;Music in the movie was pretty good though.
3794;The tricky plot keeps you guessing.
3795;The movie is also the first period piece whose period is the late 1980's, which has got to count for something.
3796;Donnie Darko is totally worth watching once.
3797;Donnie Darko is Richard Kelly's first movie, and I'm eager to see what he does next.
3798;He's got more visual panache and interesting ideas than most people out there.
3799;You can still get your money's worth out of this movie, but you have to know what to do with it: watch it once, and take it back to the video store.
3800;I'll count myself in the group of people who almost reached cult status when watching this movie.
3801;Love this movie so much.
3802;There is a curious cinematic form that has emerged in the last few years, which is akin to the Moebius Strip.
3803;He sleepwalks, and finds himself waking up in odd places.
3804;That there is an answer, and that it's slyly revealed through seemingly inexplicable pieces doled out in the course of the story, is a testament to the skill of first.
3805;But if you enjoy puzzles, if you find yourself trying to second guess where films are going as you watch, then you will probably find this film enjoyable.
3806;Jake Gyllenhaal embodies his character completely, making him sympathetic even when his behavior borders on psychotic.
3807;His is a brilliant, if malfunctioning mind, and Gyllenhaal's performance manages the neat trick of telling us that there is a decent human being struggling under the burden of his illness.
3808;If not, you get a lot of laughing and people talking over one another, as you do here.
3809;It's good for a listen, but don't expect anything truly revealing.
3810;"Even the ending was ""out of this world"" with regard to logic and good movie theme."
3811;The cast includes Jake Gyllenhaal, Noah Wyle, Jena Malone, Patrick Swayze, and Drew Barrymore who also produced the film.
3812;this film is a psychological thriller.
3813;i enjoyed this movie because it challenges the viewers mind.
3814;It bottles you up until the end in which you are ready to have an understanding of the movie.
3815;Definitely in my top 10 of all time.
3816;It is too bad Richard Kelly's movies after this one were so horrible, but at least he had one masterpiece.
3817;He seemed to have a lot of big ideas but lacked the discipline to connect all the dots.
3818;And my analysis may be way off base, but that's part of the magic.
3819;that there is plenty to ponder and speculate by the time the credits roll.
3820;Give Donnie Darko a chance.
3821;With Jimmy Stewart we have an angel helping him see what his community would have been like without him and this convinces him that it is a wonderful life thus saving him from suicide.
3822;Yes, I do compare this version of the brilliant film Donnie Darko to Star Wars.

3827;This movie is incredibly deep and complex, and acted out by a broad scope of talented actors and actresses.
3828;Richard Kelly is a masterful director, and nobody could play the role of Donnie Darko better than Jake Gyllenhaal.

3852;I know everybody mentions the soundtrack but that is for a reason, it's great.
3853;This is an excellent movie, arguably one of the best movies ever.
3854;There's moments of comedy, romance and action, as well as excellent twists and turns in the plot.
3855;The relationship between Donnie and Gretchen is cute but it also keeps tension.
3856;I recommend it to anyone.
