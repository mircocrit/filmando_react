1;"for me, the gem on this movie was someone I had never heard of before, Caetano Velaso, at the piano singing ""Cucurucucu Paloma"", a beautiful soothing version of that popular and traditional song."
2;Now THIS is an Almodovar moment.
3;simple movie, simple relationshipsThis movie is oddly simple about friendship as two men's lives come together because of the relationships with the women they love.
4;Yes, he is noted for outstanding honorary work in the film industry, but again, he's not for everyone.
5;Almodovar has still got it.
6;Innovative filmmaking while true to his Spanish core.
7;talk to Her is highly representative of his oeuvre.
8;If you aren't familiar with his melodramas this would be a fine place to enter his world.
9;As a middle easten woman , I ve found this movie stuning, the emotions it showed crosses all borders and languages, quiet few writers would venture in tackling a subject that deals mostly with men feelings ( quiet difficult to analyse) we were conditioned through the history of movie making to see women feelings explained and analysed and men's reactions towards them, this movie changed things upside down, this is the best movie for Almodavar.
10;I actually had to watch this film because of my job.
11;It has a thought provoking perspective.
12;It is unique as only foreign films are deemed.
13;Definitely worth watching and unforgettable.
14;His friendship with the other man is hard to believe.
15;There is something very special about this masterful film, something that continues to lay haunt to my soul.
16;The universal themes explored here seem to layer themselves over time, building upon their foundation an even stronger and deeper exploration of all I thought it had to say.
17;Both Benigno and Marco are in love with women in comas.
18;He lives and breathes to be near her and talk to her.
19;what I appreciate about this film is that it understands how to introduce shocking extremes without taking one out of the film.
20;What Pedro does here is far from ask us to invest in a pervert, but he asks us to understand the mind of the lonely and come to terms with someone's understanding of love and expression.
21;This is a film about humanity and the imperfections that make us human.
22;the relationship that forms between Benigno and Marco is one that speaks volumes to me, for it is one that is ambiguously profound.
23;While Almodovar leaves a lot of questions open, he understands that that is part of the journey for the audience.
24;Marco's reaction to Benigno's actions is a serious point for reflection.
25;Pedro Almodovar really understands not only his characters but also his audience.
26;He knows how to paint a picture so vivid and so real that we are bound to relate, if we are willing to be that open and honest with ourselves.
27;"the director masterfully punctuates the movie with a retro ""talkie"" that implies a warped phenomenon in Benigno."
28;This is relevant to understanding Marco's betrayal of Benigno.
29;He confesses in public he's in love with her and would like to marry her, despite her comatose state.
30;No great work of art is simple.
31;Any great work of literature, film or music is deliberately left ambiguous in order to provide multiple interpretations.
32;a man who makes a choice to sacrifice the love of a friend for the love of a woman in a most complicated way.
33;this is why the film earned an Oscar.
34;He serendipitously is hired to take care of her fulltime, which he does with care and love and joy.
35;He dotes on her, and tells her everything as if she were an imaginary friend.
36;Benigno reaches out to Marco, which first frightens Marco because of Benigno's awkward lack of inhibition, but then they soon realize they share an intense yet one.
37;Alicia finally wakes up, from what can only be described as giving birth to herself.
38;"At least in recent years
I:13304;39;in Slovakia, where I live, the poster to this film blared: """"The Most Beautiful Film of the Year""""."""
40;But his treatment is unique and his directing, I believe, could make a class.
41;on the other hand, characters and their stories in Almodovar's films are so unique and hard to repeat that it makes them unforgettable.
42;as always, acting is immaculate, but also from supporting actors.
43;all kinds of emotions may surface while viewing this masterpiece, which is helped by brilliant score by Alberto Iglesias .
44;graceful, dominated by guitar and strings.
45;The end of the film, rather satisfying in itself, is enhanced by wonderful use of English composer Henry Purcell's baroque motive.
46;the best European film of 2002 is really worth seeing.
47;Its poetry, colours and humour will touch you in unexpected ways.
48;Well, if your name is Pedro Almodvar, you will deliver another masterpiece and instantaneous classic.
49;All of them are unique, and Talk to Her makes no exception.
50;Later on, life will bring these two men togheter.
51;But a twist in the story may jeopardize this friendship.
52;At this time, he is less kitsch, and less hysterical, but still profund and poetic.
53;It is moviemaking at perfection.
54;It is a brainy and heartfelt movie, in times when aliens and explosions tend to rule the screen.
55;I was hesitant to watch it but I eventually gave it a chance and I was pleasantly surprised.
56;The story was so unique.
57;One minute he's a caring nurse, the next a stalker.
58;But I knew he was sincere.
59;It's a fine example of great cinema.
60;When I went to see this film I knew that many people in Europe like it already.
61;I knew the director and some of the actors.
62;I knew the exceptional work these people had done before but I did not really know what level of a film I would see now.
63;This was a very well done play where the movie approach was used just to move people from one scene to another and from one area to another.
64;The cinematography, as we know it, was not really applied or important.
65;It is a great play which was put together by the great group of people.
66;from the very opening of the film to the heartfelt ending, you will be enthralled as you laugh and cry with our lead characters as their fate unfolds before our very eyes.
67;it is almost impossible to fathom just how much talk to her will touch you or provoke you until you left the theatre and begin your journey elsewhere.
68;while watching almodovar's latest masterpiece, i couldn't but smile when i thought how much he has evolved in his style over the years.
69;beware, the madcap and the outrageous are still in almodovar's magical hands and probability suggests this will never change throughout the remainder of his career in filmmaking.
70;you simply have to experience this film for yourself and i feel it's best if seen in the dark halls we still know as theatres if at all possible.
71;i've been to see this film twice in the past two evenings and talk to her gets better with each and every viewing.
72;The movie is a complex and beautiful story told in a way only directors like Kubrick could.
73;This is an absolutely enticing movie.
74;The storyline cannot be any more original and an ending that will leave you wanting to share the movie.
75;He does a great job of laying and intertwining the lives and stories of all the characters.
76;While Marco's relationship with Lydia was full of passion and conflict, Benigno's relationships iwth Alicia, the dancer, is more complex.
77;He lived in the apartment across from her dance studio and came to worship her from afar.
78;Benigno comes to totally worship this beautiful unconscious girl.
79;the viewer has been led to believe that Benigno is gay but in usual Almodovar style, he is very fluid in the way he characterizes sexuality.
80;His sexuality seems to be constructed by fantasy.
81;A talented young beauty is struck down and becomes unconscious yet still alive.
82;in some ways the behavior of both men, watching carefully over the women they love, reflects man worship of the female.
83;I know that my last comment will spark the ire of some but lets face it, beauty is a form of power.
84;almodovar makes clear that this need for connection transcends the pat male/female roles and even the accepted notions of human sexuality and sexual orientation.
85;"Almodovar brilliantly turns all ""acceptable"" roles on their ears and categorically proclaims that true love is spiritual and can exist and be fueled by many seemingly unuusal situations."
86;Talk to Her is a fascinating exploration of human loneliness and the need to connect in any way possible.
87;It is one of Almodovar's most poetic, enigmatic and affecting films.
88;But Talk To Her has so much going for it that it's rewarding on any number of levels.
89;The subject is love and it is handled with great humor, with an underlayer of scorching grief.
90;"The film is touching and unpredictable
I:13304;91;What is striking is Almodovar's affection for the characters, despite their flaws and weaknesses.
I:13304;92;there are some extraordinary moments, one of the most notable being a remarkable affecting performance of """"Cucurrucucu Paloma"""" by Brazilian actor, singer, director Caetan Veloso."""
93;The soundtrack ranks as a cast member, so vital is it to the integrity of the film.
94;finally, satisfyingly, the film ends on an optimistic note with more underlayers.
95;Intelligent and thoughtful, Talk To Her is a singular accomplishment.
96;The two men form an odd friendship, with Benigno's unwavering love for his ward contrasted with Marco's emotional turmoil.
97;HABLE CON ELLA was the film sensation of the year that I moved to Spain, and I watched it many times then and later.
98;After a recent viewing, I decided that I can fairly declare it to be a masterpiece.
99;But for me the most memorable are the two psychological tricks Almodovar works in the plot.
100;He inspires such sympathy in the viewer for Benigno, a character who upon rational reflection is arguably monstrous.
101;Then, at the close of the film, he provides what seems like a heartwarming happy ending even when tragedy has unfolded for much of the film.
102;On my recent viewing, I was especially touched by Marco's insightful musings on love in the last flashback scene.
103;almodovar's movies are often full of odd sexual twists, a fact with which this reviewer is well acquainted and quite used to.
104;Talk to Her is a rare and unconventional picture that is not as much concerned with plot as it is with offering us three.
105;dimensional characters, though the plot holds up its end as well.
106;Benigno seems to have a good relationship with Alicia, talking to her constantly as if she were able to hear him somehow, and volunteering to stay nights with her when the other nurse is unable to because of family problems.
107;an emotional man who is moved to tears by ballet and music.
108;is hesitant to even touch Lydia.
109;this is my first experience with a film by Almodovar, and rest assured that I will seek out his other films, as I thoroughly enjoyed Talk to Her.
110;This is a film that is artistic without being flashy or showy, but rather by simply investing in its characters' emotions, and when we the audience can see that the filmmaker has done so, it is very easy for us to be brought into that world as well.
111;"but ""Talk to Her,"" although it has an unusual premise and moments of great humor, is not a long, bad joke
I:13304;112;A woman's brain is a mystery, and in this state even more so.
I:13304;113;But Benigno often has the ability to sound wiser than he actually is, and Marco's realization of this fact makes up much of the film's drama.
I:13304;114;his best known film, """"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down,"""" is at heart an old."""
115;"fashioned romance which just happens to occur between an escaped mental patient and an adult film star
I:13304;116;Talk to Her, while slightly tamer, is still a racy outing, and it isn't going to be everybody's cup of tea.
I:13304;117;But moviegoers who are looking for an unconventional story and don't mind flawed characters will enjoy some amazing scenes: A lovely, musical dream sequence"
118;This film truly deserved the Oscar for best foreign film, more, I feel than All About My Mother.
119;This film is sensual, unique and poignant.
120;The characters are so well drawn and unique.
121;The cast is magnificent, and we watch them perform various forms of art, from traditional to modern, especially dance.
122;Almodovar wraps and joins love stories around profoundly forward.
123;thinking social statements like a female bullfighter (played by Rosario Flores), who is both believable and fascinating as one of the principals.
124;In this film we are given the great gift of culture with some of the best artists and performances of today, in addition to a unique and touching human story of the one.
125;There is also a silent film within this film which is fine and comedic and erotic.
126;Director and writer Pedro Almodovar creates a captivating story of a friendship forged between two men who commiserate with each other owing to tragedy.
127;benigno an offbeat simple minded and virginal nurse is the prime caregiver to promising dancing student Alicia played by Leonor Watling.
128;Marco's girlfriend Lydia played by Rosario Flores is an accomplished but rare feamle matador.
129;the men become friendly spending much time with the women in the clinic.
130;He has been forbidden from telling this to Benigno resulting in some sad consequences.
131;almodovar's deft hand creates both a tragic and uplifting story that has an ironic yet satisfying conclusion which is greatly aided by the acting performances of his players.
132;He first sees Marco at a ballet, crying at a particularly ineffable part of the odd proceedings.
133;even through an intense discovery that takes the film in another direction.
134;The focus is primarily on Benigno and his growing love for Alicia .
135;Camara has soft eyes and a sweet face, which gives Benigno an almost childlike innocence that is needed for us to find him sympathetic, so that we don't question his motives for involving himself so closely with Alicia.
136;i always enjoy Pedro Almodovar's films because they are never what I expect a film to be.
137;"He continually comes up with off the wall storylines, and his characters never act the way that ""normal"" people would."
138;one excellent example of this quirky sexuality comes in the middle of Talk to Her, when Benigno describes a film he saw involving a woman and her shrinking husband.
139;In the end, after some intense exploration, he gives himself fully to her.
140;I loved All About My Mother, Woman on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, and The Flower of My Secret, but Talk to Her blew me away.
141;I even felt sympathy for the love.
142;I don't know how he does it, but Almodovar draws up masterpiece after masterpiece.
143;He is truly a genius.
144;Pedro Almodovar has again given us a beautifully haunting film, a film that causes us to truly think about our lives and the way we live it.
145;the real story here revolves around these men bonding in the face of their trials.
146;He talks to her constantly, divulging his secrets to her, his passions, and he begins to live her life for her, watching the movies she once loved and seeing as much live dance as he can in order to have more to tell her.
147;the script is original and captivating and is only heightened by the superb acting and directing of this film.
148;Their relationship is an ambiguous one, one that raises my suspicion, especially in the final frames when Marco sees Alicia.
149;A truly wonderful and unique film.
150;This film begins in one place by provoking questions about whether life in a persistent vegetative state is truly life, and whether and how a loved one might relate, if at all, to a person in a coma.
151;He truly loves the dancer Alicia, who is a patient of his also in a coma.
152;He talks to her, baths her, cuts her hair, and tenderly cares for her.
153;He tells Marcos that the last four years caring for her have been the richest and most rewarding years of his life.
154;"I recently watched ""All About My Mother"" and was so impressed with Spanish director, Pedro Almodovar, that I had to see his next film ""Talk to Her""."
155;"Talk to Her is an interesting film but I didn't enjoy it as much as ""All About My Mother""."
156;If you are a fan of Pedro Almodovar, you'll want to catch this film.
157;If your idea of an entertaining movie is a story about men falling in love with women in comas, then you'll have a blast with this flick.
158;Talk To Her is one of the best foreign movies released in 2002.
159;The storyline has many creative and daring scenes, giving it that unique dramatic climax.
160;The emotional acting is great.
161;The longing feelings are expressed the best.
162;The production and the directing is also magnificant.
163;The Oscar win for Best Original Screenplay and the additional nomination for Best Director were well.
164;"At the hospital, he meets a man whose ""love of his life"" also lays comatosed."
165;Many dramatic turns occur amongst the four.
166;Talk To Her is recommended to those looking for heavy drama.
167;I think part of the critical honeymoon this film has enjoyed has to do with Almodvar's oeuvre, which has been consistently provocative, challenging, and interesting.
168;"He has made some very good films, such as the hilarious ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" and the intriguing ""Law of Desire"" (La Ley del deseo), and some very disappointing films, such as ""Matador"" and ""Tie me up, Tie me Down."""
169;Dario Grandinetti as Marco is effective, if somewhat one.
170;note, and Javier Camara as the childlike Benigno is adequately convincing in a complex role.
171;"I know we'll see better work out of Pedro Almodvar, and I hope he doesn't believe all the publicity about this particular film (as Simone Signoret famously said: ""My performance is finished, and publicity will not make it better"")."
172;his relationships with women were too close, but not satisfying.
173;unlike most Almodovar films where the narrative structure is subsumed beneath shock effects, this one has a story to tell.
174;if you're a fan of Pedro, you'll like this movie.
175;And if you're not, it's not as disjointed as most of his work, and the story has its amusing moments.
176;Indeed, as I watched, I found this theme echoed in the cinema.
177;cinema as well, in which many of the women are also asleep or in swoons.
178;The pervasiveness of the unconscious woman image is intentional, and weaves in with the movie as a whole to make a multi.
179;It challenges the usual judgments that we may make about people and their feelings, actions, and relationships.
180;I found the ending unexpectedly affirming, though some may disagree.
181;heartedly rate this film five stars .
182;for a unique story line, for fine performances by all the cast, for extremely creative use of cinema within cinema, for the visuals (especially the scenery and the corrida) and for a well.
183;a footnote about the rating: it is rated R for some nudity and sexual themes, including a scene in the film within a film that was intentionally done with props that are clearly not actual human body.
184;Nevertheless, a very interesting film.
185;There is a scene that stays with me, where a guitarist is playing a song that seems to convey the protagonist's feelings.
186;I have been nearly as impressed by this film as by the reviews.
187;talk to Her has a memorable plot.
188;It really deserves the Oscar it got in 2002.
189;Some other great things are its music, art direction and photography.
190;The complexity of the main character's mind is the reason of the first hour of the film.
191;a well directed well palyed filmthe atmosphere is allways on the right track (never boring for one minuet).
192;almadover capture all the right moments to make a good flow in the film.
193;a good idea that doesnt get lost.
194;the film is so strong that you dont even pay attention to the fact that it is foreighnGO AND SEE
195;"for me, one of the most pleasant twists was Almodovar's inclusion of a healthy dose of the best music from Brazil, including a glorious live version of ""Cucurrucucu Paloma"" by Caetano Veloso."
196;as charming and transcendent a performance as you could ever ask for.
197;Off the top of my head, I'd recommend acoustically.
198;They're all favorites of mine, and hopefully of your's as well!
199;A great story with drama, intrigue and passion.
200;One thing he says is that many people are speechless after viewing the film.
201;But beautiful the women are.
202;And best of all is the song Paloma.
203;The photography was very beautiful.
204;This is the most enigmatic of Almovodars films.
205;And the male nurse Benigno is the most enigmatic character to appear in any of those films.
206;So they talk to each other.
207;the characters all remain enigmatic perhaps even to themselves but obsession proves to be the thing that gives life its meaning as is so often true in Almovodars films.
208;By having the object of desire both vulnerable and close and yet so utterly remote at the same time Almovodar gives us his most mysterious meditation on the nature of love yet.
209;The very funny fantasy scenario with shrinking man climbing into sleeping woman is perhaps the most absurd literalization of obsession ever filmed.
210;the gorgeous photography, the economy of dialogue, the small moments of humor.
211;movie that, at first, is a campy spin on old silent movies.
212;Almodvar has been hailed as great director and portrayer of women.
213;Talk to Her starts out a fascinating study of relationships, only to then wallow in the literal objectification of women.
214;i think that it is very important to go into this movie with an open mind.
215;i think that it is important for everyone to watch his movies with an open mind.
216;talk to her has a complete range of emotions that make the watcher really experience new emotions.
217;this movie is all about love.
218;all the actions in this movie are propelled by love.
219;like i said it is so important to look deeper than the surface to truly understand the thought behind his actions.
220;people should watch this movie because above all else it is entertaining, but it is also heartfelt and made with love.
221;"I am absolutely dumbfounded and amazed at the number of people who rhapsodize about this film, and can only conclude that its popularity is an example of ""the emperor's new clothes"" mentality."
222;"What I'd like to point out is that one of the main characters is a stalker and rapist who completely violates the woman with whom he is ""in love."""
223;If a story about a lynching KKK member were just as beautifully,skillfully and cleverly filmed, acted and scored, would you not see beyond that to its repugnant core?!!!
224;do yourself a favor, expand your horizons.
225;Another in a long line of outstanding Almodovar movies this flick does not dissapoint fans of his outlandish look at life.
226;It is a well done movie.
227;There is a movie within a movie that is excellent, done in black and white in old silent movie style.
228;The set designs in the black and while silent are magnificent and reveal a tragic love story where the little man (he takes a potion) makes the ultimate sacrifice to prove his love.
229;This sequence is in itself worth viewing the movie.
230;Their excitement over the results of their labor are infectous.
231;Whatever you do watch the directors commentary version AFTER you have viewed it once.
232;He has evolved and matured but continues to push peoples buttons in even more provocative ways.
233;So is the movie funny like some of the older movies?
234;The acting by the cast is very, very good, especially Beningo the male nurse who is a sordid character.
235;You will ultimately be the judge of this movie but if you like Almodovar more than likely you will enjoy this movie where everything comes together for your viewing pleasure.
236;Solitude is the predominant theme of this lively, entertaining and provoking film.
237;There are countless moments for the protagonists to contemplate their life and loves alone.
238;Despite its serious subject matter, Almodovar's masterful handling creates an entertaining story filled with wit and humor.
239;The characters possess compelling quirks and are wonderfully realised in a stunning cast.
240;Amazing performances are given from peripheral characters such as the ballerina instructor, Katerina (Geraldine Chaplin) and the caretaker (Chus Lampreave).
241;Meticulous Almodovar fans will enjoy spotting cameo appearances by past stars from his films.
242;This is an intricate and ceaselessly compelling film that should attract a wide mature audience.
243;The performances there suitably reflect the dilemmas evoked in the film and the relationships of the men with their women.
244;The fascinating thing about this film is the way that a story between the men is handled on the surface whilst a subconsciouss story is told by the women in their comas.
245;It is interesting to note that the silent film sequence was originally written by Almodovar to be made into a full.
246;What we are given is a delightful though shocking glimpse of what that would have been.
247;It is touching to see Almodovar's small nod of tribute to Michael Cunningham's The Hours which is a novel he states he really enjoyed.
248;The film characteristically stretches our ideas of high drama and the far.
249;This is a beautiful film to follow from Almodovar's internationally successful All About My Mother (Todo Sobre Mi Madre).
250;This past March, Talk To Her won Pedro Almodovar the Oscar for best original screenplay.
251;I was very much moved and saddened by Benigno's story.
252;It's very touching and sad to see his love/obsession for Alicia unfold.
253;Marco and Benigno soon strike up a friendship, taking solace in their ability to relate to one another.
254;it's a beautiful story that works on many levels.
255;"The ""relationships"" between two men and the comatose women that they love, and the relationship between the two men themselves."
256;I enjoyed his 1999 Academy Award.
257;winning All About My Mother, but I found Talk To Her to be even beyond that fine film.
258;Based on this one, I plan to delve deeper into the work of Pedro Almodovar who seems to be a genuinely imaginative, compelling and complex filmmaker.
259;class film that provided a pleasant surprise on Oscar night, comes to market with commentary from the chatterbox Spanish director and one of his actors, Geraldine Chaplin.
260;almodovar, who won an Oscar for Talk to Her's screenplay, spends a lot of time describing the obvious, but the commentary does have its moments.
261;Colors are OK, but unusually reserved for the director's work.
262;language film comes in adequate Dolby Digital 5.1.
263;Engish subtitles are in bright yellow, clear and easy to follow.
264;Pedro Almodvar, the famous Spanish director, is an auteur, and so you like his style or you don't.
265;Marco, a journalist and travel writer, is fascinated by Lydia, a famous female bullfighter, and tries to get an interview with her.
266;He gets more than that, as they become a couple.
267;talk to Her is a tightrope event.
268;Almodvar's story is at once touching and comedic, profound and shallow, and you can take it as great camp or a great drama.
269;After doing the deed, Marco sheds a tear.
270;It's ironic but also very honest.
271;to someone who is unfamiliar with Almodvar, this is probably the best movie to start with.
272;It's as colourful and stylized, but it's also very accessible and thematically profound.
273;Almodovar has done it again.
274;With charm and realism he shows that living fully and loving are always possible .
275;Pedro Almadovar is a gifted artist who consistently creates works of art on film that are brave, bizarre, are about subjects that few others would venture, and his end product is not only a story well told but one told with an attention to every detail that makes movies magic.
276;The black and white silent movie within a movie is at once hilarious and tender.
277;Almadovar is a poet and he is graced by a company of actors who obviously treasure the experience of his creations.
278;ALL of the actors are excellent and wholly credible.
279;This is a lustrously beautiful, wise, gently comedic, and tragic tale.
280;the film begins to tell two storIies that eventually intertwine, and the two respective main characters become friends.
281;Our hero is Marco, a journalist, whom we identify with because he is strong (despite that we see him cry in the first 3 minutes) and gentle, and more level.
282;the men's relationship is insightful, non.
283;It was not a plot device either, but a believable and consequential event.
284;It is quite powerful and there is nothing really overbearing about it.
285;The drama is sincere and effective, the dialogue and acting natural and believable, and competently filmed, although in this genre of film, that is a minor requisite.
286;In fact, it is still overall rather hopeful and pleasing, as was ONE FLEW OVER THE CUKOO'S NEST.
287;like denouncement seemed beneath the film's objective, but the final moments are stirring and the use of subtitles, especially at the end where love is the silent communicator, is very moving.
288;Almodovar reached the highest peak with this imaginative, potent, original and powerful movie.
289;the caleidoscopic , arresting and surrealist images will envolve the viewer in a complex web of unthinkable situations in which the love and death will act as a perfect syncronized mechanism of watch .
290;superb in all its powerful meaning .
291;this incredible film is about a guy whose wife (a female matador!)
292;This is dealt with (as usual) in a sympathetic and understanding manner, and I found myself feeling some empathy for the character that had overstepped the boundaries of normality.
293;What is normality when it comes to man and life!The musical score is worth mentioning here too .
294;I bought this so I could listen to the Spanish speakers.
295;It is exactly what I wanted.
296;more than enough, so I'll be brief.
297;"Having watched it at the cinema and three or four times since, Talk to Her is one of my most memorable love films and has a tone that I can only describe as ""sweet""."
298;With female matadors and emotional men who are quick to tear up at the slightest excuse, whether moved by art or some sympathy for others, this is a rich filmic experience .
299;Hitchcock claimed that film is all about feeling .
300;This sensuously directed film is so well written that you will be glued to your seat as the plot takes so many unexpected, but perfectly logical, twists and turns.
301;I was moved close to tears during a few parts.
302;This is a film that is beautifully photographed .
303;I am going to watch it again just to enjoy the visuals like the ending dance where a line of couples do a sensuous cha.
304;cha as they move across a stage in perfect synchronization and illustrate the very dynamic and changing relationships taking place in the film.
305;Another surprising moment is when a swimmer lifts his head out of the water to .
306;smile at the audience, as if he was a benevolent god blessing us all.
307;This film is a masterpiece and I think that Almodovar is now our greatest living director.
308;Almodovar is an artist and this film deserves to become a classic.
309;There's a highly deep message beside, about love, about humanity, about life and dead, about law and rights.
310;Amoldovar sends powerfull emotions and feelings through his film.
311;It's one of the best films I've ever seen, and I think it's the best one from Almodovar.
312;"I will offer a third view: like all of Almodovar's films, it's entertaining but ultimately trivial
I:13304;313;habla con Ella certainly marks Almodovar's """"mature"""" stage, in the sense that the music and themes are more serious and less neurotic or whimsical, and the production value looks to be at an all."""
314;time high for his films.
315;But despite this, his consistent trademark is still maintained here: the film is very entertaining yet never displays any poignancy that could elevate it to classic status.
316;Talk to Her is a film that reaches that level of aesthetic accomplishment that is rare in film and rare for Almodovar.
317;This film is about how memory and emotion can be so powerful they transform one's perception of reality and determine our behavior, and how we yearn to transcend the mundane activities of daily life.
318;The two male protagonists are in love with women in comas.
319;The relationships in this film are intriguing both interpesonal and intrapersonal.
320;Additionally, the cinematography is beautiful.
321;providing a visual metaphor for the characters' emotions and actions.
322;numbing us so profoundly we lose contact with what is truly meaningful to us and submerging us in a sea of consumerism and distorted narcissism.
323;This is a magnificent film by Pedro Almodovar that explores sensitively, sensously and visually themes of love, caring, watchful waiting, consciousness, metaphor, journey, health and illness within a mystery.
324;Talk to Her could have been a great film.
325;Almadovar has obviously mastered the art of the narrative film.
326;He has developed and matured tremendously as a writer since his early overly slapstick films.
327;"so why did I make the statement that ""Talk to Her could have been a great film""?"
328;Because there is a line that needs to be drawn as to what is acceptable in cinema.
329;plot point, Talk to Her would rank up there with All About My Mother, as one of Almadovar's greatest films.
330;I loved it, my #1 movie of the year.
331;The dance and music are gut wrenching.
332;You really feel for the characters, especially Benigno, because you know there is really no happy ending possible to his love story.
333;In essence both Benigno and Marco have impossible love stories with their lady loves.
334;The end was quite an unexpected twist.
335;When you watch an Almodovar movie, you can almost picture the inimitable movie.
336;"known to American audiences with 1988's ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" (nominated for ""Best Foreign Film"" Oscar and Golden Globe
I:13304;337;flavored love story """"Tie Me Up!"""
338;"In 1999, the filmmaker who made his name in the film world by breaking all the rules earned his most ""mainstream"" accolades to date with ""All About My Mother""."
339;"Almodovar received no less than 24 international awards for the movie, which received both ""Best Foreign Language Film"" Oscar and Golden Globe."
340;affirming sight and an inspiration to future filmmakers.
341;And for all you trogs out there who wouldn't consider watching a movie with subtitles.
342;well, then you'll just have to learn Spanish.
343;"Talk To Her (""Hable Con Ella"") is a drama with comedic touches."
344;She is transported to the clinic where Benigno works.
345;"dropping, is believable only because Almodovar has perfectly developed the feelings and the motivations of the characters in ""Talk To Her"", particularly the two male leads, and then allows the audience into the characters' minds."
346;"In addition, the acting by all the major characters is flawless: At face value, the audience thinks that they have everything ""figured out"", only to slowly see the characters in ""Talk To Her"" revealed in a more complicated web of human emotions, including joy, love, sadness, and loneliness."
347;Now more than ever, Almodovar manages to expertly blend barrier.
348;breaking humor with real human emotions and characterizations.
349;"In a bold cinematic move, within ""Talk To Her"" is an outrageous film."
350;For those of us American cinema.
351;And if you look really closely, you may see Almodovar with a wicked smile.
352;"because he knows that with ""Talk To Her"", he's once again pleased moviegoers."
353;Pedro Almodovar is considered one of the biggest talents outside of Hollywood.
354;A talent to make movies that are not always easy to watch, but certainly thought provoking, beautiful, compelling and stylish.
355;And only he can create such a surreal world that pulls us in and shows us the beauty and subjectiveness of love.
356;He has proved just how much a master he has become in the total craft of film.
357;and that really gives the two guys something to talk about, as well as a base for the strongest of friendships.
358;By the end of this crazy, heart.
359;thrilling tale, Almodovar has delivered us through unexpecting film of humor, human emotions, specific human connections, remorse, and philosophies.
360;Controversial, bold and audacious in its execution yet ultimately haunting, harrowing and altogether human (and humane) film.
361;pedro Almodovar is an artist who likes to paint with words and images.
362;As a result you get a beautiful story that may not be to every.
363;body's taste because of the bizarre subject that certainly touched me.
364;It's very original and I would recommend it to everybody who isn't afraid to watch a movie with a special subject.
365;and, the main character survives amidst comatose humanity because he is true to his emotions, not fully willing to sell out and become a real life zombie.
366;perhaps a hopeful gift from this talented filmmaker.
367;hopefully we will come out with it before the next one kicks.
368;If more than five stars were available, I would give this exceptional film the highest rating possible.
369;A deep, moving, beautifully choreographed story about two men and the women they love.
370;The two men develop a friendship that goes to surprising lengths as their relationships intertwine.
371;the film weaves the present together with flashbacks and cuts from theater and film performances to create a montage that is truly a work of art.
372;I bought this for the end title sequence of the dancers, really!
373;If you take the time to understand it you will be justly rewarded.
374;If not, then hey, it's still a great movie!
375;A great movie with great acting and story.
376;Winner of the Academy Award for Best Original ScreenplayWhen I read that a foreign film won a screenplay Oscar, I knew that I had to see the movie.
377;I have a difficult time comparing the screenplay to an English language film, but this was a very good movie.
378;One of them is deeply touched and the other notices this and remembers it.
379;Benigno is a male nurse who has one patient, Alicia.
380;Benigno shows incredible care and tenderness for Alicia and early on we get the image that he is a fantastic nurse and that she is well served.
381;Marco, the other man at the theater, meets a female bullfighter, Lydia, and they begin a relationship.
382;It is clear that he believes himself in love with Alicia.
383;As the movie progresses we see more and more of the backstory that got the characters to where they are at the start of the movie.
384;This changes our understanding of Marco and especially Benigno and it changes how we perceive their relations to each other.
385;I was surprised by this movie, but it was a pleasant surprise.
386;I liked Talk To Her.
387;but this is a good movie and if anyone has an interest in foreign movies, this is one to see (not necessarily the one to see, but it is one to see)
388;La tragedia superior merece marcas altas.
389;"A slyly subversive ode to love in all its myriad forms, Almodvar's ""Talk to Her"" is an intimate, involving tale that examines the dark and even perverse nature of masculinity with great compassion."
390;As always, Almodvar coaxes exemplary performances from his actors, especially Grandinetti.
391;With its striking visual flair and even a mini silent.
392;"film fantasy evoking Buster Keaton, ""Talk to Her"" is an audacious love fable with an enormous heart."
393;It reveals information slowly throughout and lets you develop your own thoughts about the characters.
394;You spend a great deal of the beginning trying to figure out if the main character is Marco or Benigno and then you realize it's really one big story.
395;Marco is outwardly masculine, but sensitive to the point of tears in the right situations.
396;I will certainly take this as a cue to see Pedro Almodovar's earlier films.
397;a fine portrayal of functional mental illness and the demands made upon and choices faced by people who love someone whos crazy.
398;"Spaniard Pedro Almodovar's unforgettable takes on the human condition have ranged from the ribald (""Labrynth of Passion"") to powerfully heartfelt (""All About My Mother"")."
399;From women on the verge of nervous breakdowns to women daring to reveal the flower of their secrets, Almodovar is one of the few filmmakers that can spawn a wave of eager anticipation at the box office with each new effort.
400;TALK TO HER is built to engage the heart and mind .
401;becoming of one of Almodovar's best efforts in the process.
402;a quirky tale of friendship and fidelity, TALK TO HER chronicles the lives of two couples.
403;The focus of the story captures the patient waiting game of the two men: A nurse who has given his life to caring for a young dancer.
404;The two men forge a unique friendship with the journalist seduced anew by the nurse, whose unconditional love for the dancer offers a beacon of hope for his sleeping bullfighter.
405;While both men find the ability to talk to their women with incredible honesty and selflessness, love turns to obsession for one, leading to tragic circumstances.
406;what makes TALK TO HER such compelling entertainment is its quartet of characters.
407;Rosario Flores' bullfighter is also remarkable, an earthy temptress that is as strong as she is insecure in her own passion.
408;from its lushly evocative score by Alberto Iglesias to the the classy sheen of the film's cinematography, TALK TO HER finds the director at his peak.
409;Almodovar deflty handles the comedic and emotional ties with considerable grace, never sacrificing one for the other with banalities.
410;"(A high point is watching Caetano Veloso sing the classic ""Cucurrucucu Paloma"" in a flashback sequence that is beautiful)."
411;It is by far his most assured effort as a director and writer.
412;While fans of the outrageous Almodovar past may quibble about his latest forays into more mainstream efforts, his skewed world view is very much intact.
413;"With so much ink spilled on how Almodovar's women are the cornerstone of his art, having him essay such compelling male characters for the first time since ""Law of Desire"" is another key example of the director's ability to evolve as an artist.You may find yourself questioning the narrative at some point, but it is a richly layered film that commands attention and plenty of talk once the end credits roll."
414;One of the year's best in any language.
415;"Almodovar's stunning new film is a poignant masterwork that even exceeds his great ""All About My Mother"" as an emotional tour de force."
416;Incisive and witty, despairing yet brimming with life, this ranks as the director's greatest departure from his canon of crazy characters and slapstick broad humor.
417;Here, a gentle quiet settles over the characters right off the bat, with a dance of death that sets the stage for the pure pathos and ironies that follow.
418;he central characters meet at the outset (but don't, really until later)while watching a ballet, and their lives intertwine in unexpected, yet utterly real ways.
419;value of Almodovar's unique worldview, where everything seems upside down, and yet always logical, as if all our existences were being played out on screen despite the obvious distances that exist between we the audience and the characters we come to love.
420;And here, unlike in the great majority of his classic films, the filmmaker focuses on men whose lives are utterly up.
421;ended by dramatic encounters with the women they love.
422;there are parts of the film that will take your breath away .
423;a silent film sequence where a shrinking man literally walks into a sleeping woman (a visually stunning interlude that doesn't make much sense when it happens, but ultimately becomes a crucial plot device) and a plaintive wail sung by Celetano Veloso midway through that will literally bring tears to your eyes.
424;The actors are terrific, the dialogue sharp and refreshing, the images visually deep and rich.
425;"Almodovar captures more with simple twists of fate than most directors can manage in an entire film, and ""Talk to Her"" proves once again that he is a master of cinema ."
426;one of the truly great directors of our day.
427;this is a new ballgame of the first order!
428;A superb, breathtaking work of art!
429;It will do you both good.
430;"This is a good film, but, based on all the hype, and on what everybody else is saying about Talk to her"", I though it was going to be better."
431;Almodovar once again concentrates the main theme of his movie on women, and they are the strongest part of the story, even being both in a coma.
432;Talk to her is a big drama, with some funny moments, but a big undisguised drama nonetheless.
433;"the best thing about ""Hable con ella"" is that you leave the movie in a ""thinking mood""."
434;"i thing Almodovar has made better films than this one, like ""Carne tremula"" (Live flesh) or ""Ata."
435;A moving and complex study of the relationship between two men, and their connection to women in comas.
436;A few brilliantly funny moments, and some ultimately very creepy undertones keep it from being over.
437;Every character is more complex then they first appear, and the confusion between what is good and what is bad in both intent and effect is very rich.
438;Gets slow in a few spots, and the sentiment still goes over the top in a few places, but still a terrific film about the similarities and differences between love and obsession.
439;The two men become friends and from there the story becomes intertwined with drawing a line between what is love and what is too much.
440;end street by delicate colors of hazy dilemmas has done another masterpiece reflecting his improvements in time.
441;"Smart camera angles and filming ideas turn the perfectly set story into a ""cinema classic""."
442;And displaying all the actresses in his previous movies accompanied by a beautiful music is a fascinating scene like the rest of the movie.
443;hollywood production which will make you see the values of friendship and love at an unexpected point of view,seems to be my favorite for a very long term.
444;lydia is a female bullfighter who has just broken up with the man she loved.
445;She meets Marco, a reporter.
446;What happens to these four people?This is a very touching movie.
447;But when it was over I found myself hoping for an even more touching conclusion.
448;"Almodovar here fashions a film unlike any of his others
I:13304;449;An Argentinian reporter living in Spain, Marco, meets two people by chance.
I:13304;450;a female bullfighter, Lydia, and a male nurse, Benigno.
I:13304;451;It is there that the two men begin a friendship based on their mutual concern for the two women they are attached to.
I:13304;452;the ending of this film is one of the strongest things about it"
453;It's brilliant, proving that fate often does come full circle in our lives.
454;To say any more would be to give away the supremely clever, emotionally gripping plotting of this one of a kind film.
455;"What can be said is that Benigno belies his name
I:13304;456;it's always a real pleasure to see an Almodovar film and this is certainly no exception.
I:13304;457;The trademark infusion of Spanish culture is here as well, with scenes in a bullring.
I:13304;458;and there's also a concert of music by the great Brazilian composer.
I:13304;459;a. film is absolutely wacko.
I:13304;460;This is really a beautiful film protriating love and human relationships.
I:13304;461;But you will still find the essence of Almodovar's sensibility and passion.
I:13304;462;I enjoyed Volver very much"
463;Talk to Her was well done, cohesive and excellently acted.
464;I was particularly taken with the performance, in perfect Spanish, of Geraldine Chaplin.
465;Although I enjoyed the movie and it is worth watching, it was not what I expected from Almodovar because all the characters seem to be damaged and have very sad lives.
466;I was very moved by it.
467;I watch a lot of foreign and oddball movies .
468;I highly recommend this movie.
469;It's a complex, emotional, involving story for grownups.
470;A very refreshing change from mainstream US films.
471;the story is THAT good.
472;sexually loaded works back in the seventies and eighties to his more mature and hilarious works from the past decade.
473;With the help of some of today's greatest Spanish.
474;peculiar Javier C mara, Almodovar is on a trip to the unknown to tell the stories flowing from his heart, from his childhood, his forbidden places.
475;"As hipnotizing the movie can result there's more to it than a brilliant storyline: direction is impeccable (as usual with Almodovar), filled with details to embellish the story
I:13304;476;well, what else can be said about Alberto Iglesias, Almodovar's long time scorer?
I:13304;477;This is his most brilliant accomplishment so far!The best advise I can give you is, get up, grab your keys and shoot for a theater that is playing it: you will laugh, you will cry and you will come back home craving for more.
I:13304;478;I have not seen it (yet) and I hope to be able to watch it pretty soon.
I:13304;479;please explain this to me, if this is this man's best movie, it makes me wonder what his other movies were like because i can hardly imagine something worse that Habla Con Ella.
I:13304;480;This is a beautiful film about compassion and friendship that goes beyond the norm.
I:13304;481;Fantastic cinematography and a beautiful music score throughout.
I:13304;482;This is one bizarre, unique, and unforgettable film.
I:13304;483;The plot is fairly simple, yet richly engrossing: Two men are in love with women who can't hear them"
484;it's the unlikely friendship between these two men that gives the movie focus.
485;Benigno tells Marco that talk is essential to these motionless women.
486;var navigates with uncanny skill and passionate heart.
487;the film moves slowly and deliberately, remaining captivating from the moving dance performance at the beginning to the devastating conclusion.
488;Rich in detail, and ingenius in its excecution, this is definitely one of the most unique films of the year.
489;I really wanted to love this movie.
490;The cinematography was beautiful and I tried hard to sympathize with the protagonists presented by Almodovar.
491;It's really very simple and the complex statement about how love crosses boundaries, is false.
492;"Whereas in the past his concerns have been almost exclusively with a woman's mindset as in ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" or ""All About My Mother,"" ""Talk to Her"" is about men and their inability to communicate, open up to their loved ones."
493;"a woman's likes to feel that she is cared for and cherished."""
494;"(paraphrase)As sometimes happens in life, these two disparate men become friends
I:13304;495;One day she drops her wallet and he returns it and walks with her to her building.
I:13304;496;She returns to the room from the shower and quite naked and gets frightened by him as he flees.
I:13304;497;He thinks of his girlfriend as """"dead"""" but Benigno tells him she hears everything if you just """"talk to her."""
498;What transpires changes everything for the four people involved and makes Marco come to a lot a realizations about himself.
499;this is a good film for classroom discussion.
500;He talks to her as if she were conscious and handles her with the utmost care, attending to every detail of her needs to make sure she stays as beautiful as she was before her accident.
501;Benigno shows Marco how it is possible to care for someone who does not respond, and the two men, who seem to have little in common, develop a friendship based on their mutual grief.
502;Talk to Her uses unconventional and roundabout means to describe how relationships form out of life's tragedies: Two women in comas and the men who care for them.
503;This is a beautifully photographed movie, and director Pedro Almodovar has crafted the film in such a way as to keep our interest in characters and a story that actually do very little.
504;Talk to Her has elicited some strong reactions from viewers who object to how Benigno's behavior towards Alicia is portrayed in the film.
505;Talk to Her asserts that hurtful events in life often serve as a catalyst for the formation and discontinuation of relationships.
506;Both films are unique and interesting in their own ways.
507;although I have not completely figured out the film, it is one that is filled with meaning and real.
508;it is interesting to see that Lidia, a woman is a matadora, she kills and has a more stereotypically masculine job.
509;Benigno's woman is the one that lives, she is the creator of art of meaning, she is a dancer.
510;The audience does nto develop a relationship with Alicia, because she is very wealthy and above the other characters in class.
511;friendships, obsession, lost loves, and deaths are all themes interwoven cleverly by Almodovar.
512;i will not go on about the story of the film itself, since it has been well reviewed by many, but I have few observations to make,The genuis of Almodovar is not only he is the best Spanish director today, and like Tornatore in Italy, soley responsible for reviving the Spanish Cinema industry, but he is an excellent writer as well.
513;It is always more interesting for the director to be the writer too,as it gives the film a personal and much more artistic dimension.
514;although I am generally against bull fighting, I too found myself sympathizing with Lydia, the female matador (beautifully played by Rosario Flores), and this is all the result of powerful writing!The soundtrack was beautiful,tragic and melancholic but somehow subdued and never overbearing.
515;just gently complementing the scenes.
516;for me personally, this is Almodovar's best film to date, one that will surprise you, will captivate you from the first minute to the last, a film that reminded me why I love cinema so much.
517;Once again, Pedro Almodovar has delivered yet another complex movie mended together by his visual style and great actors.
518;At her side, her lover Mauricio, stays uncomfortably with her at all times.
519;From the beginning, Pedro gives us outcomes first, then the causes, a style that works so well that by the end, you feel the characters truly exist.
520;THAT is the incredible and unique style of Pedro Almodov r, which I love.
521;one must see this piece of work to appreciate, 2 years in the making and well worth the wait.
522;goers to rate a foreign film slightly higher than English.
523;Something is mysterious, culturally refined, elevated in sometimes incomprehensible way.
524;One is a dancer, one is a bullfighter.
525;if you are heavily into foreign films, you may find this one interesting.
526;this was an elegant play of tentions, emotion, and confusion.
527;Beningo is both masculine and feminine, man and child, gentle and aggressive, caring and obsessive.
528;He constantly speaks to Alicia, describing movies and dance performances, asking her opinion on furnishings for the love nest he's creating for them out of his late mother's apartment.
529;She is a rangy figure, all huge features on a long, slim face and ropy body.
530;Like Beningo (and all the other characters ultimately) she is an intriguing combination of male and female, power and submission, modern and traditional.
531;Almodvar's eye is utterly precise, as he weaves this wild and unlikely story in which the characters' world progressively grows smaller, as their lives draw together and begin to overlap.
532;Again, like many of Almodovar's movies,we start out with a fascinating premise, very nice camera work and a decent cast.
533;And the viewer stops caring.
534;I JUST SAW THE FILM TONIGHT.
535;Pedro Almodvar's movie about the twists and turns of the human psyche and the complexities of intimacy.
536;I've seen several Pedro Almodovar films and been amazed by his amazing ability behind the camera and also the development of the stories around his characters.
537;The greatest mark of a director, of good film is when people don't appear to be acting but instead as if the watcher feels like they're watching someones life unfold.
538;Her new boyfriend Mauricio losyti n what to do, stays with her though he knows her situation may be terminal.
539;There's a game of attarction between the four lead people in this film because Mauricio and Benigno are so genuinely in love with the women and eventually they literally fall in love with the other's capacity to love.
540;She reunited with a lover the day of her mauling who now sits by her side, so he's been replaced.
541;"Benigno has perfected the art of""hearing"" Alicia and tries to train Mauricio until scandal erupts with the pregnancy."
542;mauricio's devotion to Benigno is touching and even Benigno explains that in order to be visited in prison he had to tell the officials that Mauricio is his lover.
543;Their sympathy deepens into both understanding and friendship in a way that we see Benigno's sexuality has just never been explored by a living person and Mauricio's capacity to love is greater than his masculine ego about his sexuality.
544;There's a high degree of spirtuality at play in this movie, particularly about love and simply loving someone, being availible to loving someone.
545;a stupendous film because of a great story, as the best movies always are.
546;The Bottom Line:Talk to Her is without a doubt a well.
547;"made motion picture, but it's a difficult film to approach and I felt while watching it that I was appreciating its merits without being truly involved with the storyline
I:13304;548;What I can say is that this is a powerful drama done in a way that only non.
I:13304;549;There's just a """"je ne sais quois"""" that sets this kind of cinema apart and Almodovar seems to be a master of this effect."""
550;still, a beautifully constructed film.
551;Like most of Almodovar movies, it has a love triangle with a twist.
552;A fine piece of cinema.
553;Sad and joyful, as a love story should be.
554;This one is a treasure.
555;Almodavar deftly weaves the separate strands of the complex relationship of the four leading characters into a tightly focused and compelling piece of story.
556;Sad and uplifting, ironic and sympathetic, touching and unsentimental, this is a wonderful film.
557;"rate
I:13304;558;Great movie, excellent acting and a great story.
I:13304;559;Beautiful, happy, still tragic story of the love of 2 men for two women in coma.
I:13304;560;Love and hope are omnipresent, dialogues are light and still very powerful.
I:13304;561;The actors and the images are fantastic.
I:13304;562;Happy endings are so rare in European movies that their quasi existence here is great to be mentioned.
I:13304;563;The original Spanish language is so beautiful and so much in harmony with the movie's style, that everyone should be able to listen to it and understand the words pronounced.
I:13304;564;rape issue is more symbolic than straight forward, seeing how the rape scene is actually played as a silent film.
I:13304;565;other than that, Lydia's character is great, and bullfighting scenes are breathtaking, such contrasts against each other: gracefull woman against bloody, wounded, 500kg bull.
I:13304;566;also dancing scenes are amazing too, cinematography is wonderfull, it's trully beautiful movie, do watch it if you have chance.
I:13304;567;I saw that """"Talk to Her"""" was a foreign language Academy Award winner and that got my interest."""
568;It was nominated for Best Director and won Best Original Screenplay.
569;This film had an impact on me and I wasn't sure that I liked that fact.
570;If you've read other reviews you probably know why there is such a strong feeling pro or con on this movie.
571;After some degree of soul searching I acknowledged that the director, Pedro Almodovar, did a brilliant job.
572;I also acknowledged that the sequence of events were impressive but still fictionally created to achieve some sort of a purpose.
573;on the positive side, the acting is very good to excellent.
574;I liked the meaning of the title of the movie.
575;There was always something happening or just about to happen to keep our interest as well as our curiosity focussed.
576;There are the subtle aspects of dialogue and scenes which come back to us with the realization that everything was put together so completely.
577;Of all of those subtleties, I liked the chapter titles that seemed so innocuous until we get to the very end and see the final chapter title.
578;In that chapter title, Pedro Almodovar come up with a conclusion of our ownwhich enabled the movie to continue in our minds.
579;The director also covered himself well in this journey into extreme immorality by getting us all comfortable with the morality of our key players.
580;The outcome is the hard part to deal with but, again, Almodovar covers his steps very well and guides us to a choice of negative/negative or negative/positive.
581;The scene I saw take place in present time let me ponder how disasterous this young boy's life would become in the future.
582;This second last installment by Almodovar, before his more personal Bad Education, is by far his most mature and refined of all the films in his cinematic oevre.
583;"Talk to her allows us a glimpse of what the human being is capable
I:13304;584;All of this, of course, is done in master strokes of visual composition, with sumptuous shots that penetrate the psyche.
I:13304;585;All in all it's fantastic, almost inexplicable, a film that can only be understood by watching it in all its glory.
I:13304;586;See this film if you cherish screenplays, direction, ensemble acting, cinematography, editing, and music that are no less than brilliant.
I:13304;587;He has composed a masterpiece that immensely satisfies both one's left and right brains.
I:13304;588;My strongest recommendation is that TALK TO HER is, along with AFTER LIFE, one of my favorite films about life.
I:13304;589;Up `til now I've avoided Pedro Almodovar's movies because I thought his work was going to be bright, loud, and kitschy to the point of garishness.
I:13304;590;The only film that comes close is """"Y Tu Mama Tambien,"""" and """"Talk to Her,"""" is up a few steps from that wonderful movie."""
591;The humor in this movie runs from humane to surreal, and for the most part is simply touching.
592;"One of the great ""finds"" of this movie was Caetano Veloso performing a gorgeous rendition of ""Cucurrucucz Paloma,"" that brought tears to the eyes of one of the movie's characters, and to mine as well
I:13304;593;Definitely worth the price of admission.
I:13304;594;Talk to Me, is a splendid movie that should have you thinking and talking about it for days.
I:13304;595;He talks to the comatose girl and does her hair, her fingers, massages and washes her daily.
I:13304;596;He is smitten with a silent movie and rapes her one night.
I:13304;597;there is much to think about in this gentle movie.
I:13304;598;A surprising movie, worth the time to see.
I:13304;599;The story, the cinematography, the characters, and the music are superb.
I:13304;600;This is one of my favorite films.
I:13304;601;Anything by Almodovor is worth seeing, but he does have a weird idea of love.
I:13304;602;In spite of being driven to the top rank of art cinema directors with his critically acclaimed sensation """"About My Mother,"""" and being unlike other directors of equivalent status who have been chosen to work within the rootless world of the international co. productions, Almodvar has remained instilled in the rich culture of his native Spain."""
603;"in ""Talk to Her"" the two main protagonists are men, unusually for Almodvar, whose films have been notable for a succession of powerful and striking female roles."
604;But then we lean that the likable and amiable Benigno has raped Alicia, the woman who is in love with her.
605;european art cinema has a great tradition but an uncertain future in the world increasingly dominated by Hollywood.
606;Almodvar is an ornament of European culture which proved that the form still has much to say about the human condition and can say it with charm, elegance, and attractiveness.
607;The story line was great as was the performances by all the actors.
608;i reflected on this film for several days after seeing it and it is one of thebest films I have seen.
609;Once again, Pedro Almodovar has delivered yet another complex movie mended together by his visual style and great actors.
610;At her side, her lover Mauricio, stays uncomfortably with her at all times.
611;From the beginning, Pedro gives us outcomes first, then the causes, a style that works so well that by the end, you feel the characters truly exist.
612;THAT is the incredible and unique style of Pedro Almodov r, which I love.
613;one must see this piece of work to appreciate, 2 years in the making and well worth the wait.
614;I don't even think this is Pedro's best work (to me it's either All about my mother or Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown).
615;as in most Almodvar films, this one tells of strange relationships and deep feelings.
616;All the characters are well developed, and the intertwining of the stories is flawless.
617;kudos to Pedro for another great piece, and for winning the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay .
618;This is a deeply moving film, beautifully filmed and superbly acted with several interlocking themes: the beauty of women, the importance of attention to and care for those in a coma, the relation between science and mystery.
619;"top humor of such earlier films as ""Women on the Edge of a Nervous Breakdown, it impressed me as the most mature of Almodovar's films that I have seen, both artistically and thematically."
620;All the characters except our hero, Benigno, the young man perfectly happy with his lot in life, of caring for brain dead patients selflessy, are pretty sad.
621;None of them really are willing to accept their life and see shortcoming for which they see little hope .
622;i enjoyed the film but again it's probably not everyone's cup of tea .
623;There are 4 main characters to the story but each one is engaging in his/her own way.
624;None of them possess perfect good looks but the character development and the plot and all those things that go into enhancing the movie : the cinematography, the score.
625;just all blend together to create a very interesting film with interesting characters, moving the viewer along the peaks and the lows of each scene.
626;provoking, yet it does all this on a very basic and powerful level that can reach all types of audience.
627;This vendor deserves kudos for outstanding customer service in prompt problem resolution.
628;Although at first glance these two tales appear to be unrelated, towards the end both intertwine as friendships are made and new love blossoms.
629;I won't necessarily go into what I interpret the themes to be because other reviewers have done a good job of exploring them.
630;I believe it is the best foreign film of 2002.
631;The cinematography of the arid Spanish countryside is gorgeous and brings back happy memories of my trip to Spain many years ago.
632;The characters are convincing and three.
633;dimensional and the emotions displayed between them are realistic.
634;It is amazing how well controversial subjects are treated with grace and skill without offending the audience or letting those scenes overpower the rest of the film.
635;TALK TO HER is a pure delight.
636;Just the sort of movie that wins awards!!
637;The acting is great, and the story is very well told, but I think the thing that sets this film apart is the characters.
638;this is absolutely one of the best films I've seen in a long time.
639;"Excellent and original foreign movie
I:13304;640;I highly recommend it and look forward to see more like this one.
I:13304;641;I am a big fan of Almodvar and all his movies.
I:13304;642;He is one of the very few directors in film history that creates movies that are hugely artistic and commercialy successful.
I:13304;643;He managed to create a style of his own, visually and conceptually.
I:13304;644;You can recognize his camera style, the acting, the music, and the light comedy but you will not see the strong melodrama and the camp elemets.
I:13304;645;This is a start of a new phase in his directing career and I am looking forward to see what he is going to do next.
I:13304;646;almodvar has brilliantly weaved together this new masterpiece by incorporating silent film, music, ballet, flashbacks, and scenes shot out of sequence to come up with a seemingly simple film which will surly stick with you for a long time.
I:13304;647;the acting is exceptional, the character's are unforgettable, the script is perfect, the pace is such, so as to keep you guessing, but still allows time for all the subtle elements which makes this such a rich cinematic experience.
I:13304;648;I found the story interesting how the characters developed along two plot lines.
I:13304;649;superior """"All About My Mother"""" (1999)."""
650;As Marco spends more and more time at Lydia's bedside, he starts to develop a deep friendship with Benigno who displays a similar devotion toward Alicia.
651;Talk to Her offers a unique take on the nature of companionship as its two male leads find some meaning in their lives by spending time with companions who may never be aware of their presence.
652;In essence, a strong character study film transforms into a morality tale that asks the viewer whether a wrong can be truly considered a wrong when it produces a positive outcome.
653;Those familiar with Almodvar's work know that his characters are always colorful, diverse, his films being anything but boring and conventional.
654;that being said, 'Talk To Her' plays like a symphony of poetry, colors and even passionate music, that evoke complex emotions within us.
655;Almodvar has a very unique style, he is a true master of his characters, they are what drive his pictures.
656;a film with many themes, the main one being solitude and loneliness.
657;Yes, it has elements of tragedy, but also encompasses humour, wit and thoughtfulness.
658;The short silent film fantasy in which a little man attempts to please a woman with what can only be described as total and complete commitment, both amusing and heartbreaking.
659;It is also a pivotal change in the film's direction.
660;It is a true work of art.
661;The compositions are so well designed, making for an intensely pleasurable visual experience, texturally rich.
662;This is a visual masterpiece.
663;In addition, the inclusion of one of film making's most memorable scenes (you decide which one that is) makes it a film to remember for life.
664;The sound track is amazing integrated with the imagery, making a most cohesive film experience, with the camera moving in and out, and around, as music changes and shifts appropriately, yet never in any staid kitchy manner.
665;The film draws you in throughout!Conceptually .
666;The script behind this film comes with a gripping plot, though very disturbing to many.
667;But it is laced with a unique humanistic dusting of compassion, examining (or exposing) human beings' vulnerabilities in the face of our human condition that causes us to search for connections and love.
668;This carefully constructed script, with great editing work, deserves attention and several viewings over time.
669;Marco and Benigno, both watching the production as the audiecne.
670;And by the time you see what happen to these four characters in the following chapters, you will why Pedro Almodovar is now thought one of the most accomplished film directors in the world.
671;the film looks often melodramatic (in a good sense, of course) and sometimes very surreal, but it always is beautiful, and rich in tone.
672;and then, you will know that this is an Almodovar film, unconventional, daring, but somehow manages to be compassionate.
673;sweet love story, with his taut storytelling skills and confident touch.
674;The film is painful and moving, but finally very rewarding.
675;In my opinion, one of the best movies ever about love, attraction, distances, barriers (both natural and circumstantial), loss,and humor (for how could there be an Almodovar movie without a touch of it) that involve relationships between humans.
676;And 5 stars also for Iglesias musical score.
677;I think he is brilliant.
678;All About My Mother, was in my opinion a masterpiece.
679;Cutting thru the sexual taboo's as with a Rapier, leaving you with your mouth wide open, or walking up the aisle.
680;both men do a great job and you can feel their angst, especially Benigno, as he is not in control of his feelings for Alicia.
681;there was one of the greatest renditions of 'CU, CU ,RU, CU, CU, PALOMA, that I have ever heard, very sexy and moving.
682;also, Almodovar brings in his stars from other pictures.
683;At the nightclub you will see a few actors from All About My Mother.
684;What can I say, this movie is just perfect.
685;It's an original, moving story, with a great cast (Dario Grandinetti is perfect) and an excellent soundtrack.
686;this movie shows the great talent that is Pedro Almodovar.
687;It is also a film about incommunication between couples, and about communication.
688;"About silence as ""eloquence of the body"", about film as an ideal vehicle in relationships between people, about how a film told in words can bring time to a standstill and install itself in the lives of the person telling it and the person listening."
689;It is also a film about madness, about a type of madness so close to tenderness and common sense that it does not diverge from normality.
