1;I believe that a movie accomplishes it's purpose when the viewer actually understands how the charcters in the film must feel.
2;She's very pretty and even does a full frontial nude scene.
3;Ewan McGregor joins another fine ensemble cast.
4;Then a film like this comes along and kicks me squarely on my ample backside.
5;Humor that's dark, witty, wicked, gritty, accurate.
6;Based on a novel by someone with a true appreciation of, and a gift for, the language.
7;i'm sure the novel was fantastic, and I know it must be damn hard to translate such novels to the screen because we've seen so many failures.
8;But with a great screenwriter plus the right production team and actors, it can be done.
9;Trainspotting can't help but be a deeply affecting experience.
10;Ewan McGregor is excellent in his breakthrough role and Robert Carlyle is very strong, if miles away from his role as 'Gaz,' the lead in The Full Monty.
11;As excellent and gripping as it is, I'll be glad to get this out of my system.
12;paced funny, sad, moving picture.
13;The characters are all fantastic and almost all endearing.
14;the original book is an excellent read as well.
15;Being from the USA, I had some trouble understanding parts of the dialog, but after a while you just start hearing it (hint:you'll probably catch more the second time around).
16;This is an extremely well done movie with terrific acting from everyone involved (esp.
17;well worth the time taken to watch it.
18;And oh, yeah, the music is awesome!
19;This is one of the most imaginitive and visionary movies ever made.
20;Danny Boyle is a genius of filmmaking(28 Days Later is another good example) and this movie is no exception.
21;It's the cast, however, who really make this movie great.
22;This movie glorifies heroin in some ways but also gives a realistic depiction of the resulting depravity.
23;this is a wonderful movie with many layers.
24;if you wanted to you can watch it for the symbolism of every scene or a window into drug addiction, but I watch it again and again just for the characters and humor.
25;This film gives a stark portrayal of the life of an addict.
26;There are darkly humourous moments, most supplied by Robert Carlyle.
27;A classic of British cinema which is difficult to watch, but ultimately rewarding.
28;"In 1996, ""Trainspotting"" took the world by surprise
29;trainspotting is certainly not the type of movie to watch if you need cheering up and an extra dose of optimism.
30;It does have its moments of well.
31;fit in British humor, and at many points, we simply want to dish out hugs of sympathy to some of the characters.
32;minded I can find it a good movie if your looking for a documentary on the unrepentant evils of heroin junkies.
33;I would recommend it to addicts to watch, perhaps they would then realize how they are wasting away.
34;Okay this is not a groundbreaking film or anything, but it is smart, catchy, and has excellent characterization.
35;around Fun Movie to watch, and has probably the best ending monolog for any motion picture you'll see anytime soon.
36;*Interesting group of characters, with lots of interesting and memorable moments.
37;*Good dialogue (and good monologues).
38;*Very interesting, broad view of the issue of drug addiction.
39;It accurately captures the good and evil of it.
40;*Accents are intense, almost unbelievably so.
41;stylish and hip, this film is never dull.
42;It is filled with memorable scenes and dialogue.
43;Altogether, it's a very interesting portrayal.
44;Anybody who is interested in this kind of material should check this out.
45;it's one of my favorites now.
46;it's a very unique funny film but also sad, strange, and some parts disturbing.
47;its so much fun in one way but in another way it's dreary and sad but its a great watch.
48;Trainspotting is a gritty film about the horrors of heroin use.
49;It is, however, a great film.
50;the film is bleak and dark but, from time to time, it is also funny.
51;Ewan McGregor as the narrator and chief character is brilliant.
52;These two and an assorted cast of misfits create a true film masterpiece.
53;There are many downs and few high points.
54;There is a glimmer of hope in a sea of distress.
55;this film is a must see!
56;`Trainspotting' is similar in its honesty, yet it differs in its direction.
57;Some have been put off from the way that `Trainspotting' portrays drug abuse, but in my personal opinion the slight comedic edge the film possesses adds yet another layer of honesty to the film.
58;boyle's masterpiece shows the light and the dark side of addiction.
59;The film simply observes their conduct and exposes the reasons they stay hooked as well as the reasons they wish they weren't.
60;what is so devastating about `Trainspotting' is that it nearly blindsides you with its shocking moments of truth.
61;This technique works very well, for it generates in us pure and genuine outbursts of emotion.
62;Some have mentioned a certain scene involving an infant"
63;These are the moments that benefit from the films wicked mixture of drama and humor, for it makes the impact of these scenes even more devastating.
64;the film is propelled by a commanding performance by Ewan McGregor.
65;He is engaging, entertaining, likable and relatable.
66;I just loved watching her.
67;danny Boyle's magical talents are on full display here.
68;I know he is a household name now thanks to his Oscar winning film `Slumdog Millionaire', but honestly he is in top form in his earlier work (see also his ravenous work on '28 Days Later').
69;I've always been a fan of his, and this is probably his best work.
70;Visually he is captivating, but he juggles both the witty and the ominous with such strength.
71;It's a flawless culmination of the two.
72;"this film is as shocking as it is engrossing
73;There are few films that are daring enough to be this honest.
74;This is an awesome film, fun and harrowing.
75;Lots of my friends don't like this movie at all, so it's just a matter of taste.
76;This movie was beautiful, horrible, and unforgettable.
77;A gritty, intimate look at heroin use, this film illustrated instead of proselytizing.
78;Trainspotting was the best film of 1996 in Great Britain and it continues to generate emotional polar opposite reactions today.
79;What is unique is the humor and irrevent cheek of the four boys whose lives descend rapidly while their habits become deadly.
80;The soundtrack is a marvelous compilation of music to shoot up by various artists and now is heard on main stream television spots for automobiles in the US.
81;Trainspotting presents a rather realistic take on life with heroin"
82;Though not a particularly good influence and certainly not a family film, Trainspotting is a must.
83;see for all young people 18 and older.
84;This is a great movie and one of the hippest movies out there directing itself to a younger audience.
85;While it is not for everyone and it could come as a great shock for the squeamish.
86;Great film, realistic, with some nice surrealistic scenes, great drug.
87;induced soundtrack, and most important extremely entertaining.
88;TRAINSPOTTING is an excellent story about addiction, and the chaotic hell it can cause.
89;It has plenty of instances of characters plunging into the depths of heroin.
90;That said, it must be mentioned that TRAINSPOTTING is also wickedly funny.
91;The incredibly nasty, public toilet scene is priceless!
92;Ewan Mcgregor's role is the most accessible, making him the moral center of the film, though he must pay a great price for possible redemption.
93;"I would rather recommend Darren Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream."""
94;The acting is great as you can see the actors' portrayal of thier addictions as they sweat perfusely and go all crazy and on the edge just to get a hit.
95;A true gen. x classic!
96;This movie is one of the best movies ever made.
97;you have to see it to understand how brilliant it is.
98;Ewan McGregor, Jonny Lee Miller, Robert Carlye, Kevin McKidd are outstanding in this film.
99;the whole thing was pretty brutal but if you can handle it, it's quite an entertaining movie
100;As an 83 year old train spotter from Glasgow you can imagine my joy when I heard that there was a wee Scottish movie out about the long misunderdstood joys of train spotting.
101;i went to the cinema in town and was filled with delight as I waited in line with the spiky haired yobbos from town.
102;I knew that my hobby would one day catch.
103;Another glossily realized finally trite/empty celebration of life without ideas, intelligence, foolish hobbies like learning or responsibility.
104;The celebration is stylistic rather than substantial.
105;Brilliantly played and filmed this movie is a reference in cinematography.
106;It gets one of my highest recommendations.
107;i thought it was pretty good.
108;The dialogue is funny and extremly well.
109;The plot is original and keeps you glued to the screen.
110;this is the best acting i've ever seen in a movie.
111;and he is just simply the best.
112;He can play so many parts!
113;And also the music in this just blends beautifully with the film.
114;I especially enjoyed the nightclub scene.
115;this film is the best.
116;if you liked this film.
117;It just shows you that a good script writer makes for a better movie.
118;This show has a great cast of very flawed characters, but their are some great performances by Robert Carlisle and Ewan McGregor.
119;The rest of the cast plays their roles just as well.
120;Still is a pretty good film to have as part your collection.
121;It was hard to understand some of the dialouge but other than that the movie was a great!
122;Can someone please e. mail me and tell me what happened.
123;But it was a great move over all!
124;Easily one of the best films of the 1990s, Trainspotting centers around a group of youngsters who are controlled by their addiction to heroin.
125;the movie is definitely not without its funny points, and the dry humor that is seemingly rapid.
126;fired by the characters as they engage in their normal activities of mischief hold substantially more comic value than is seen in most comedies these days.
127;On one hand, you can definitely see a chapter of someone's life come to an end in a disheartening but nonetheless necessary fashion.
128;What happened to all the beautiful movie stars?????????????
129;the movie follows the fortunes of likable, suede.
130;Exploring the oblivion and depredation of drugs, the film treats us to delights of acute diarrhea, 'toilet diving' in the filthiest toilet in Scotland, crime, unemployment, AIDS, copious vomiting, as well as some football.
131;the fact that such unpromising material makes for compelling viewing is due to the sheer talent at work in the film.
132;weary view: One day their won't be men or women, just wankers .
133;His sullen, hypnotic presence is the film's heart, but he is ably assisted by the other actors, particularly Robert Carlyle's Begsbie.
134;Irving Welsh also makes an appearance as local dealer Mother Superior so called because of the length of his habit!Certainly this is a dark and dirty, violent and sordid movie, but it is also strangely uplifting with a hint of optimism at the end.
135;"The Danny Boyle directed ""Trainspotting"" was a somber view with some comedic overtones into a group of Scottish heroin addicted losers."
136;While the film garnered accolades, I found it to be profoundly disturbing as the seemier side of addiction was vividly depicted.
137;mcGregor and Carlyle and two other buddies eventually have their dreams come true,.
138;i loved this film since the day it arrived in limited screen release back in 1996.
139;the characters are beautifully illustrated and are very true to the characters presented in Welsh's novel.
140;he is surrounded by friends who share the same ambition as him, looking for their next shot of heroin.
141;the emphasis is the world that heroin creates and most certainly stops itself from glamorizing its use.
142;the thing most intriguing about the film is how you find each of the characters to be likeable and endearing in their own unique way.
143;the world of junkie music is woven ingeniously into the film which clearly makes the two soundtracks an ideal accompaniment to the film.
144;all of the performances are memorable and it created a new genre of filmmaking to come out of Great Britain.
145;Visceral, hard edged, truthful and gritty are the words that will lean heavy on you once you've seen this film.
146;Trainspotting, a classic movie that spawned a classic soundtrack, hit the big screen in 1996 and is based on Irvine Welsh's debut novel.
147;Starring, among others, a pre.
148;jedi Ewan McGregor, Johnny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle, the film is mostly set in Edinburgh and London.
149;It tells the story of our 'hero' and his friends : a group of junkies and / or criminals.
150;the most notable exception is Begbie, played by Carlyle.
151;He is also something of an expert on Sean Connery, particularly in his 007 days.
152;"(Miller's grandfather, funnily enough, played ""M"" in the Bond movies until 1979)."
153;For some reason, I found Spud (played by Ewen Bremmer) to be the most likeable character .
154;the soundtrack is superb .
155;While there is a great deal of humor, many of the scenes and situations do not present addiction as an appealing option.
156;This darkly humorous, provocative and hard edged movie interpretation of Irvin Welsh's awesome `Trainspotting' novel follows the exploits of these now famous four and puts working class Edinburgh on the map.
157;The local dialect/vocabulary, characters, theme music and storyline is as distinctive and at time challenging as Burgesses `Clockwork Orange'.
158;Welsh is the bard of the new century Scots working class consciousness in distress and this movie version is pure catnip to his established and first time fans.
159;When Trainspotting was released in 1996, it took the world by storm and caused a sensation not only in its homeland of England, but in the United States as well.
160;This is a very informative track with excellent insights by everyone as one would expect from Criterion.
161;the second disc contains the bulk of the extra material.
162;The Making of Trainspotting featurette was done at the time of the production.
163;It is pretty standard electronic press kit material but still well made.
164;and finally, a gallery of production Polaroids mainly of extras from the movie with some cast included as well.
165;trainspotting has aged surprisingly well considering it was one of those zeitgeist.
166;This reminds me of a Tarantino cult classic along the lines of Pulp Fiction possibly.
167;Very trippy, as well as very entertaining.
168;"I took the chance because of the brilliance of the director, Danny Boyle, who has helmed such cinema classic as ""Slumdog Millionaire"", ""Sunshine"", ""127 Hours"" and ""28 Days Later""."
169;Slumdog is the first Bollywood movie to be a hit in Hollywood.
170;Sunshine is one of my favorite SciFi films on the 2000's, 28 Days Later is mentioned with the best Zombie movies on nearly every list of best Zombie movies and even 127 Hours manages to make that well known troll, James Franco, look decent and like an A. lister.
171;Let's face it, Danny Boyle has the golden touch.
172;You are bombarded with images that transcend visceral discomfort.
173;As he has shown again and again, Danny Boyle is brilliant, but I would prefer not to watch his vision of Ewan climbing into the grossest commode in the long history of cinema (well done, Scotland!)
174;It exists and I will never watch that scene again.
175;i found this movie disgusting and brilliant.
176;Trying to capture it on film is auspicious.
177;This is real life stuff.
178;British Academy Award in the Best Screenplay.
179;Just because the direction is highly stylish (and Danny Boyle, the director, does a great job of being flashy without interfereing with the movie) doesn't mean the movie is a glorification.
180;it's very well written and acted, with Ewan McGregor leading the cast.
181;this is more of a comedy than Requiem For A Dream , probably the best heroin tragedy in a long time.
182;But it's still pretty harsh, and definitely worth seeing.
183;I had heard that this was a great movie, so I had to watch it.
184;On a positive note, the acting was frighteningly believable.
185;"Also: if you can get past the scene, 10 minutes in, of the ""Worst Toilet in Scotland"", then you'll be rewarded with a pretty solid cinematic experience."
186;"despite the ""resulting depravity"" of heroin use, the movie also happens to be quite funny."
187;"Depraved and funny: ""Trainspotting"" is kinda like life in that way."
188;There are 2 to 3 moments of humor in this film and 2 to 3 moments of brutal reality.
189;Traffic has nailed this plague far better.
190;It also features some of the most exuberant filmmaking I've ever seen and a masterful wedding of music with subject manner.
191;It's also rare to see a film so successfully combine harrowing scenes of appalling behavior with laugh out loud comedic moments.
192;out scene may be the most memorable part of this film, it does paint a pretty realistic portrait of highly disorganized young heroin addicts.
193;This dark comedy ranks as one of the great films of the '90s.
194;The acting is good, the story is highly engaging, and the take on life it offers is definitely a reflection of the modern world, albeit a dark one.
195;If you like the boondock saints then you will love this.
196;i actually enjoyed it more than I thought I would!Sure.
197;there are some weird images, but I felt the film had a good linear narrative.
198;largely due to Ewan's excellent performance and in wanting to learn what becomes of his character!
199;"But this Brit production with the heavy Scottish brogue (subtitles in places wouldn't hurt) is fortunately more than that
200;cultural references"
201;blown commercial seduction of contemporary youth, worthy of the talent of somebody at, say, Sony or Pepsi or even the WB.
202;ewan McGregor is excellent in the leading role as a junkie who is as cute as your brother, with fine support by Robert Carlyle, who plays a bantam who likes to cut people.
203;"The script by John Hodge is partly unintelligible, which is good
204;It had a couple funny moments though
205;Process unfortunately frequent in cinema: the use of an excellent soundtrack to support the scenario.
206;In Space Odyssey , Kubrick in fact uses the music to accompany the images but a profound silence would do as good.
207;It may be rather grotesque , it is a superficial, an external perspective on drug nevertheless succeeding to communicate a certain energy , a collective delirium, grotesque and funny situations .
208;If you have a son or daughter who uses drugs, watch this movie.
209;It's amazing to think this was vilified for glamorizing drug use at the time of its release, because it's as stirring an anti.
210;cuff conversations and one giant, trainwrecked final score.
211;Several outstanding selections on the soundtrack unify the scattered emotions very nicely.
212;Maybe the movie got better.
213;I didn't get to watch it back then, but I finally have been able to see the movie.
214;So if you are 20ish, it will be good for you.
215;I enjoyed this movie a lot kudos to the cast keep up the greAt work
216;The film is hilariously conceived with the friends showing the degrees to which they are willing to go in order to support their addictions.
217;Even though the film is generally very upbeat, and frenetic, there is always lurking around the corner the dark side of these individuals' lives.
218;I've now seen this film about 10 times, and it stays fresh every time.
219;The opening scene is especially unforgettable, probably the best marriage of music and film I've seen in a long time.
220;hint: listen to McGregor's voice.
221;at the beginning of the film the narrator reads this laundry list of all our modern """"necessities"""" with scorn"
222;The genius of the film is that at that point you not only suspect he's just going to continue his drug life overseas but also you almost sympathize with him.
223;This is one of favorite movies.
224;The accents do take a little getting used to, so this is a good movie to watch on tape so you can back it up when needed.
225;was that it made the addict feel good.
226;the point is people use heroin, because it is good.
227;This movie works because the characters fill their sterotypes perfectly.
228;this film is very funny.
229;the book is excellent, and the movie is reasonably faithful to the story.
230;The book fleshes out the actions and characters more, the movie has sharper dialogue.
231;this is a great movie.
232;A little hard to watch (especially the dead baby), but will really give you a good picture of hopelessness.
233;Sure its got heroin in it.
234;Trainspotting is movie about moving on, making changes for the better and never looking back.
235;the movie culls lots of elements into the movie.
236;Its funny, powerful, uplifting and for me inspiring.
237;Every part of the movie just screams character and gives it an even more compelling edge with the help of exciting pacing and orignal direcion(well for its time.
238;It's not violent and agressive, it's just a piece of art that makes all us, British People be proud of.
239;"i definately advise everyone to see it, you'll just love (and not only because of the scene when Ewan McGregor dives into the toilet), but because of the scence that this film gives you: if you're older a scence of regret and nostalgia
240;i wasn't old enough to know this existed when it came out, but after hearing some good things about it i gave it a shot, and it was a pretty good film.
241;i can see how it could have a cultish affect on people, it's one of those films.
242;it can be kind of funny, a sick kind of funny.
243;it is a raw look at the life of a guy who goes in and out of heroine addictions.
244;in his eyes it's just another aspect of his life at the moment.
245;the Collector's Edition is a double disc edition, and has all the aforementioned extras as well as additional material.
246;but to my great surprise and delight, the menus on the discs themselves are beautifully done, thematically consistent with the original promotional art work, and has a proper retrospective, relatively distant feel.
247;Great funny movie that the plot keeps going.
248;A gritty and psychedelic account of European youth.
249;Lots of disturbing imagery puts you in the moment and makes you think.
250;got to my house quickly and was in good condition.
251;i also bought spun, requiem for a dream, eyes wide shut, and vanilla sky.
252;It's a passage that sums up the twin futilities of junkiedom and working class life, and it's no accident that this scene begins with a sprint from a store and ends in a courtroom, marking the twin pillars of a free.
253;turns the chase itself into a kind of rat race.
254;culture skills of lying, stealing and hustling make him well.
255;all neatly paralleled by heroin pleasure, heroin addiction, and the brain.
256;so while being terrifically stylish and funny on a number of levels, Trainspotting's foundation is what makes it a great film.
257;This film has got to be the greatest film I have ever seen.
258;The book was fascinating and the film does a terrific job in portraying the true lives of close friends that are heroin addicts.
259;In the book you see the characters for more than their addictions and overall see more aspects of their lives.
260;Nonetheless trainspotting is a good movie(I bought the directors cut which are usually better).
261;This movie gets better every time I watch it.
262;The humor is so outrageous and provides an amazing contrast to the brutal subject of the film, heroin addiction.
263;The best part of the movie, the ending, sums up the whole moral of the story.
264;this isn't a movie for the faint of heart of stomach and it may take a few viewings to understand their accents, but is a very entertaining and well acted and directed achievment and one of my favourite videos.
265;this is probably one of my favorite movies,and one of the few movies ewan macgregor is actually good in (if you dont believe me watch moulin rouge and and those piece of trash star wars movies).
266;I was an active heroin user at the time, but also found the movie extremely good (what I could remember of it).
267;This movie is truly a wake.
268;It's surrealistic and speedy, in a rock video kind of way.
269;But if you are interested about what this crap does to ones life, or have a friend or family member hooked on it, it's a good movie depicting what these people go through on a day to day basis.
270;Trainspotting is one of the sickest movies I have ever seen.
271;But it is also one of the best.
272;Excellant acting and an experience to be held.
273;If you're a drug user or have been a drug user then this movie may hold some appeal for you.
274;The screenwriter did a helluva job.
275;Too much Hollywood in the movie?As I write this I think of how much I thought how cool and stylish the movie was.
276;and how well acted it was and is.
277;And then how superior the book really is.
278;all and all, it's a great movie, it's just not the book.
279;I hate writing that but I'll write it again.
280;it's a great movie, it's just not the book.
281;A very funny movie with several future stars in the cast.
282;Such an oddly compelling story of a guy and his friends as he tries to find solid ground as a young adult troubled by his drug use.
283;I view this film as being on the same level as """"High Fidelity"""""
284;But all that aside, some solid performances by Ewan MacGregor, Robert Carlyle, and Kevin McKidd.
285;This movie is intelligent, funny, and quite thought provoking.
286;Drug addiction is just one way of looking at it, and this prespective is done really well.
287;but this is true for most drugs that have a similar mode of action as heroin.
288;I loved this film when it first came out and I still appreciate it.
289;it is funny, believable, tragic and never dull or boring.
290;For us adults, it is very enjoyable, some laughing ,some crying.
291;I appreciated the fact that it painted a realistic picture of heroin addicts and their recoveries and relapses, European club life, and intertwined Aids, hanging around the wrong people but still calling them friends, and showing some light at the end of the tunnel without being cheesey or cliche.
292;trainspotting is simply a very good film and one of my modern favorites.
293;What I appreciated about Trainspotting is the truth with which most characters are portrayed.
294;this film is about a man who's deep into drugs and it's all his life revolves around.
295;it's funny to see the kinds of things he does to get himself off the addiction but always faulters.
296;I have seen Requiem For A Dream and I certainly don't dig it.
297;it has it's own moments.
298;i laughed out loud 4 times and cried 0 times.
299;This movie is great, it has a great mix of comedy, and some depressing stuff.
300;The good friend in the movie, shouldn't of done what he did.
301;It is so hilarious at times, i laughed so hard.
302;That one part, with spud is the best, omg i laughed so many times, i still laugh whenever i see it.
303;And the part while he's at the interview, hilarious.
304;Trainspotting does a great job of portraying the lifestyle without glorifying it.
305;Excellent movie, with great character development.
306;This is one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen.
307;It's so poetic about the whole drug thing and it's like a peak into the mind of a drugy.
308;The soundtrack was amazing too it fit's every part.
309;SEE THIS MOVIE + Ewan McGregor's a great actor:)
310;Irvine Welsh's startling novel is bought to life for the silver screen and it does the compelling, best.
311;Director, Danny Boyle shows imagination and inventiveness with this origanal, provocative story of four Edinburgh lads going on a self destructive rampage and focuses harshly on the characters physical decline into heroin addiction and the harrowing situation that revolves around this.
312;They all put in powerful, very commendable performances and compliment the razor sharp scripts that are totally astounding and eerily realistic.
313;This well balanced film evokes the harrowing atmosphere and some hard hitting facts brilliantly resulting in a stunningly unique piece of work that is nothing sort of a masterpiece.
314;"I dont need to explain the plot of ""Trainspotting"", as pretty much ever other review has already done that."
315;This is one of the best films I've ever seen.
316;Dark humor and stark realization are constantly presented during the film and thankfully the movie doesnt ever sacrifice one in favor of the other.
317;The soundtrack is also excellent sporting both tried and true rock veterans Iggy Pop and Lou Reed(of the Velvet Underground) as well as modern industrial and techno artists like Primal Scream, New Order and Underworld.
318;"This is definitley one of the ""hippest"" films of the 90's and one of the best movies I've ever seen period."
319;Like I said, simply outrageous in all the best ways.
320;This film is in a way a masterpiece that gives a vision of how young men influenced or organized by older men live in the margin of society, on the fringe of normalcy.
321;They find the morbid pleasure, at times deeply wrapped up in scatological regression, of experiencing these impulses without any limitations.
322;Money, adventure, the power of doing what is forbidden, the thrill of getting into supposedly unexplored feelings and intense emotions.
323;Their life becomes a jungle where emotions and feelings are driving forces and fascinating objectives.
324;And yet we have to come to the conclusion that our societies do enable such young people to find and build this jungle.
325;Being Scottish, maybe I'm biased but this is a brilliant, laugh out loud funny , film.
326;"also, Trainspotting is intentionally funny
327;I have never seen such a powerful indictment of heroin and its effects and I ever had any inclination to try the stuff then a single viewing of the movie cured me forever.
328;There are moments that make you laugh out loud (Spud's job interview for example) and others that are some of the most powerful and disturbing film images that I have ever seen.
329;danny Boyle and co. have do a marvellous job of making a film about real people and real lives while making it compelling viewing at the same time.
330;The soundtrack is excellent just to round off the experience.
331;want a good Danny Boyle movie?
332;Trainspotting is an excellent movie following on in the tradition of Shallow Grave.
333;With witty voice over narration, in a sometimes incomprehensible Scottish brogue, from Ewan Macgregor as the lead protagonist Trainspotting starts of with a delightful introduction to a motley crue of misfits.
334;When we are introduced to these characters that make up his circle of friends, Tommy, Sick Boy, Begbie and Spud all the time moving to the sounds of Iggy Pop's catchy """"Lust for life"""" we know we are in for a treat."""
335;The movie is a humorous, dark, cynical, satirical look at the life of a junkie and the effects of heroin on the lives of himself and his friends.
336;"it also comes across as a social commentary piece, juxtaposing the mundane activites of everyday society with the fixed purpose of a ""sincere and honest"" drug habit."
337;I had not read the book but I figured a movie about Scottish hoodlums who were heroin addicts sounded interesting, so I checked it out.
338;But, McGregor's supporting cast is what really makes Trainspotting stand out above most other films.
339;Robert Carlyle is simultaneously hilarious and chilling as Begbie, the elder statesman of the group who in fact is the only one who is not a heroin addict.
340;witted but ultimately good hearted.
341;Trainspotting is a realistic film.
342;Boyle's characters have heart and you can feel their pain and emotions, you ultimately come to care about them.
343;The look, the genius, the color, the music, the best.
344;A whimsical world of heroine is traced in this Scottish.
345;"I hold it up there with classics such as ""Pulp Fiction."""
346;It is by far my most favorite film in my collection.
347;There's a mix of funny parts and sad parts, and the characters (for the most part) are great.
348;I like the way that the movie is filmed and the soundtrack is GREAT.
349;This movie certainly isn't for everyone, but it's definitely one of my favorites.
350;It was all things to me, interesting, shocking, visually stimulating, enthralling, and highly emotional.
351;The actors themselves did an outstanding job in their respective roles, and were eerily convincing as junkies.
352;this is a great movie that i haven't seen in a long time.
353;forgot how funny it was.
354;Having read the glowing reviews, I was prepared to enjoy some serious laughter.
355;One of the best movies i have ever seen.
356;It is so beautiful, and funny and odd, and sad at some parts.
357;The movie deserves all the amazing reviews that it has gotten.
358;I thought this was a very powerful movie.
359;I myself can really relate to their troubles.
360;It kept me in my seat the whole time!
361;Plenty of reviews have described this amazing movie.
362;An informative correction to the ideas that follow!
363;Lots of people are really, really interested in trains, but trainspotting is kind of the very lowest.
364;one who has pretty much given up on ever doing anything exciting and who absolutely needs to get a life!
365;Collecting train numbers is basically pure, time.
366;artistic interest, investment, etc .
367;It was the background against which the vivid and certainly scary picture was painted.
368;Many keep thinking there's an A in there somewhere.
369;"one even wrote ""defiantly"" which gave an interesting and unintended twist, and of course passed spell."
370;Extremely entertaining and watchable, funny, intense, basically everything a classic movie is.
371;This witty, hallucinatory adaptation of Irvine Welsh's bestseller is an outrageously entertaining glimpse at dead.
372;end lives, peopled with a remarkable cast of over.
373;top characters who made the film an international hit.
374;In his breakout role, McGregor is endearing as a ratty doper who just can't handle the notion of straight life, no matter how hard he tries.
375;Boyle's energetic direction of a sterling ensemble cast.
376;"including Bremner, Miller, and ""Full Monty"" star Robert Carlyle, playing Mark's scornful, hard."
377;"By turns shocking, morbid and funny, ""Trainspotting"" is an honest, scathing look at addiction."
378;This is a really gritty tail about heroin and friendship and survival.
379;Ewen McGreger did a great job.
380;If you like dark humor you'll like Trainspotting.
381;This is a great movie about a group of scottish heroine addicts.
382;I believe it was one of the top 100 of the BFI (British Film Institute).
383;This is a must see for everybody.
384;It's also got some humorous bits.
385;Accents a bit hard to understand sometimes but worth watching.
386;Gee what a vision of a film.
387;I watched it because of great reviews.
388;Not even so much as a theatrical trailer was included, but it was a great movie so we still bought it.
389;I've seen the film 6 times, and it's always the same .
390;Instead it paints a pretty offputting picture of the drug.
391;the film ranges from sad to funny and it is always gripping.
392;i was very pleased with this product, it arrived in a timely manner and as described!
393;"Calling ""Trainspotting"" the funniest film ever made about heroin addiction doesn't begin to do it justice ."
394;Robert Carlyle delights in what has proven to be an unusual turn for him as the completely mental Begbie.
395;but comparing this role to the rest of his work just makes it more fun.
396;This movie achieves to combine the black comedy,intelligent dialogs.
397;This movie is sincere, describes the problems and charisma of a group of junkies in the 80's Scotland.
398;Kudos to all the actors and the director is superb.
399;I also loved the soundtrack!
400;In 1996, director Danny Boyle made a name for himself with his adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel Trainspotting.
401;Over the years, the film has continued to be a great success with critics and audiences, growing a larger fanbase with every passing year.
402;ray so fans can finally enjoy the film in high.
403;This is a film that moves with energy and purpose.
404;with a running time of only 90 minutes, its remarkable how much happens.
405;driven, with very memorable characters and is very funny at one moment and very tragic the next.
406;diving scene, while also functioning as a strong drug movie, allowing the characters to romanticize heroin while showing the tragedy that accompanies the use of the drug.
407;the soundtrack, consisting of both classical and pop music, the brightly colored cinematography, and the overall composition heavily recalls Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.
408;Trainspotting was actually edited by the studio due to the heavy Scottish accents and their fear that American audiences would have trouble understanding them.
409;"Darkly funny, with memorable characters, a stunning performance by McGregor, and uniquely flavored direction by Danny Boyle
410;culture masterpiece that won't lose steam any time soon.
411;The beauty and color of the film nearly pop out of the screen, however, technical aspects aside, the Blu.
412;If you love this film and you want to see it in the most high.
413;Worst movie I've ever seen.
414;Ewan McGregor is a very underrated actor and he's brilliant as a junkie in this film.
415;This movie is a great depiction of the struggles each character goes through in their fight with addiction.
416;Anyway I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie is.
417;I enjoyed it more then any Tarantino movie I've seen and those are all excellent films.
418;Trainspotting is definately a winner so go out and see it if you haven't already.
419;disturbed Scots, June 16, 2004Reviewer: R.
420;And you are seeing Scotland from the viewpoint of junkies and taking their opinion as fact!And another:Still holds up after all these years., June 14, 2004Reviewer: Cubist (United States)""""When Trainspotting was released in 1996, it took the world by storm and caused a sensation not only in its homeland of England, but in the United States as well."""
421;the film itself is brilliant, an accurate portrayal of heroin addicts in Edinburgh (they are not Glaswegian as another reviewer has said) and is well worth owning, the book is even better.
422;i would recommend never actually coming to Scotland as those are the actors not going into a broad edinburgh accent!
423;When I was that age we never did anything to have so much fun.
424;you'll have a great good time.
425;The film shows just how much of an impact heroin can have on a young individual's life.
426;top visuals (the sequence with the dead infant in the crib is one that I won't be able to shake for sometime) and a rapid MTV music video style editing, Boyle makes the film visually fascinating while showing the truth behind the life of the average drug addict.
427;That, in and of itself, makes the film something special.
428;The film is gritty and dark, both qualities that are rarely seen in Hollywood movies today.
429;I still think the ending doesn't work as well as it should as it feels a bit too upbeat but that's a minor quibble of an otherwise fine film.
430;Sharp, witty, superbly acted and directed this film offers bright and clever humour along with deeply harrowing warnings for everyone to take notes from.
431;But how on earth is he going to do that when his loser junkie friends just won't leave him alone?Ewan is good as the guy narrating the story but Robert Carlisle (playing a seriously dangerous psycho) and Ewen Bremner steal the show with their performances.
432;aCTED movie, and yes, you have the right to your opinion, but I can't accept the reasons for your disapproval.
433;He fails sometimes, but once he kicks it, you cheer for him, and you hope he has the capacity to stick to his guns.
434;How powerful a character is that?It's really brilliantly done.
435;And that's damn good movie making.
436;I thought Trainspoting was excelent!
437;A little odd at times but in the end is was great.
438;The actors in this movie played their role great, excpecially Ewan McGregor who played Mark.
439;He was great at the way he portrayed his role.
440;Trainspotting is great, comedy, but some parts were too rough.
441;Trainspotting and the second major performance of Mcgregor redefined cinema.
442;Everything from the look to the feel is brilliant.
443;"I loved this movie because it deals with a time in my life that I just cannot forget
444;It's also moving (that may be because I can relate to it well?)
445;Makes fun of a bunch of heroin addicts.
446;This movie really makes you appreciate your own life, that is for sure.
447;Ewan MacGregor and the rest of this cast truley make this potential serious suject matter a delight to watch.
448;The script is great and its just such a great movie.
449;A moving, funny, horrible, sad, weird picture.
450;There's a lot going on.
451;it's the kind of movie that makes you laugh, cringe and grip your seat.
452;Before I had seen Trainspotting , I asked some friends and family what they thought of it.
453;He gets into real estate in London and, just when life's looking good, his buddies come back and hook him on drugs again.
454;well that's what addicts do!
455;Because of this, the film ends on an upbeat, hopeful note.
456;It's worth checking out, people.
457;Trainspotting is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion.
458;watchable considering some of the most shocking and at times potentially repellant scenes to ever appear in a mainstream film.
459;It still is director Danny Boyle's best film to date.
460;There is a nice filmic layer of grain throughout and I couldn't spot any instances of any digital noise reduction.
461;ray is the best way to go.
462;In terms of a movie based on a book, Trainspotting is an AWESOME interpretation of the book.
463;If these don't apply to you, you will love this crazy emotional rollercoaster and the cast of characters that inhabit it.
464;Wildly inventive, extremely funny (often sickly, disturbingly so), filmed with an insane sense of energy and pace, and aneye for truly inventive surreal images, and a soundtrack full of great songs that all fit perfectly.
465;Not to mention abevy of superb, brave performances.
466;Both take us behind the scenes of dark, dysfunctional works (drugs, porn),but do so with a sense of humor and humanity that transcends clich s and makes us relate to these characters ashuman beings, not just porn stars or drug addicts.
467;These are both films full of ideas about choices and morality,without ever feeling moralistic or judgmental, and both use their central world as metaphors for the bigger worldsaround them.
468;Indeed I'm surprised to read so many reviews claiming Trainspotting's ending is optimistic.
469;Written, directed and acted with a great outcome.
470;Ewan McGregor is in one of his best roles ever.
471;Trainspotting is another film that proves the vitality and originality of the British cinema.
472;The film pulsates with energy, talent and an understanding of the heroin scene.
473;far one of the great modern British films.
474;It takes no liberties, pulls no stops and presents it to us in such a stark, gripping and entertaining manner that we end up feeling that we too have somehow lived that live.
475;some people bashed this film, saying it condoned the use of drugs.
476;But no matter what they're up to, the most important thing is always heroin.
477;a police officer I met, who works the drug/slum area in Vancouver said that this film was the most realistic portrayal of addicts he had ever seen and from what I know I'd have to agree with him.
478;He manages to put some credibility and human qualities to a type of person we would often think of as inhuman.
479;The wit and acuity of the film and dialogue is amazing"
480;Although it's not made for everyone, it's a great view on young un.
481;Trainspotting is one of the most exhilarating movies I have seen in a long time.
482;The novel was equally as amazing.
483;"I love this movie, it
484;i love the soundtrack too.
485;it's an entertaining story for our generation that almost never seems to slow down.
486;really fast paced and engrossing.
487;Original, funny, captivating, well developed characters.
488;In the moive it look like real life you know.
489;Everybody playden a great part they got so into in it look's like there are durg user.
490;I've always wondered how people addicted to heroin can live their lives thinking they are living normally, and the addiction is so powerful it renders them powerless to live any other way, but then I realized almost anything can be considered an addiction .
491;we all wrestle with something, be it our weight, our ethics, our punctuality, etc.
492;Moments when we convince ourselves it will be the last time, until the next time.
493;the film makes some interesting comparisons between a """"normal"""" life, and the twisted lives of these characters."""
494;I particularly liked the ending .
495;there were no sweeping revelations for the characters, they remained true to their weaknesses, true to their characters.
496;there are plenty of sad, sick moments, and there are some very funny moments, even through the darkness, and the wit of each character is fantastic.
497;Some of the most imaginative sequences I enjoyed immensely, but felt as though they could've done without the extremism and still kept a good flowing story.
498;Still, they certainly made a strong point in the scene involving the most disgusting toilet in Scotland.
499;The Scottish accents are the thickest!The acting is terrific, across the board.
500;Plus, I give it extra stars for utilizing my favorite descriptive noun .
501;This vintage 90s movie is still as compelling as it was when I first saw it.
502;It has achieved cult status now.
503;This is a great movie.
504;A truly great performance from Ewan Mcgregor.
505;Ewan Mcgregors's best movie so far!
506;Better than his other movies, potraying an addict going strait is his genre!
507;Plus the remarkable performance of jonny lee miller as sickboy , a distraught fellow who's a conman and such.
508;I just watched it again and enjoyed every minute of it.
509;Ewan McGregor and the rest of the cast are fantastic.
510;I give it 5 stars.
511;Cool movie, great characters, awesome acting.
512;"Most movies make you pick two
513;An upper of an ending which leaves you with a smile at closing credits.
514;It's a mixture of the Miramax theatrical and the true Director's Cut.
515;Trainspotting fans rejoice at last!
516;One of the best movies of the 90's is finally brought to home video justice.
517;I haven't seen the movie in years but it is still a classic with a dark sense of humor and some social commentary.
518;This film crosses those barriers however because it is so well made, such good characters and so HILARIOUS!
519;(ps we invented your loved possesion.
520;Overall, Trainspotting is one of the best movies ever made, it's that simple.
521;What a trip this movie is.
522;The dialogue, setting, acting and soundtrack are exceptional.
523;It is at once incredibly disturbing, extremely suspensful, ridiculously funny and very much moving.
524;Robert Carlyle (Begbie) is insanely funny, and completely psychotic as well.
525;Sick Boy is troubled yet appears successful and happy on the outside.
526;This is a great film that in no way glamorizes drug use.
527;the script is moving, and the actors are terrific.
528;The film acknowledges that the high experienced from drugs is a pleasurable experience (otherwise no one would do it), however we quickly see that not everything is hallucinations of rainbows.
529;This story of a group of friends, also heroin addicts, is so truthful and convincing that it will make your stomach twist.
530;the other characters, Spud, Sick Boy, Diane and Begbie are created so well that they all interact amazingly.
531;The script is wonderfully adapted from Irvine welsh's novel.
532;Many think the story is about how good heroin is, but the story is actually about true life.
533;it's all around a brilliantly told story that is truthful and pulls not punches.
534;It's not everyone's type of movie, but if you're looking for a very well done piece of work, this is the movie.
535;Movies SHOULD make you think, and boy does this film do that!
536;But he's very good anyway.
537;Heroin is not chic nor glamorous as is neither drug addiction, but the movie is sharp, fast and funny.
538;The cast is great and the SOundtrack as well.
539;It's right there with Requiem for a Dream in terms of stunning portrayals of strung out dope feigns.
540;Well watch this move and you question will be answered.
541;I have watched this move at least four times , it is very well done story and a must see in anyone's movie collection.
542;britian was in vogue (music, fashion, and young actors"
543;The Scottish language and humor takes at least three times viewing for Americans to pick up.
544;and i have, and will keep watching it.
545;A very nice movie telling a tale about heroin addicts and the state of edinburgh in the late 80s.
546;good acting by all the characters.
547;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
548;Well, this is a good movie to watch if you want to keep your kids away from heroin!
549;It also takes place in Scotland, and, being an American, it can be difficult at times to understand exactly what is being said.
550;Still, though, it is one wild ride, and it has one great soundtrack.
551;First half of the movie was truly outstanding.
552;The definitive edition of an amazing film.
553;An incredible view inside the twisted destructive lives of junkies.
554;If you are a cult follower of this film, this is a good addition to your collection.
555;Disorder, Confusion, Turmoil, and Discord could very well be considered the supporting cast.
556;Amongst all the craziness is the interest that you will find most enjoyable.
557;This movie will make you laugh, it will make you gasp, and it will make you imagine yourself in the main character's shoes.
558;This film will be most enjoyed by those who find themselves fighting the same struggle.
559;Whether you completely understand or not, this film is still fun.
560;You may not get the most enjoyment out of it if you don't truly understand it, but it is entertaining to watch nonetheless.
561;I rate this film four out of five stars.
562;Since it got great reviews, I went and saw it and was surprised.
563;It was my favorite film of the year!The film deals with four friends that are caught up in the Scottish drug culture.
564;(This leads to one of the most disgusting yet intriguing fantasy sequences.)
565;This is just a great look at the subculture.
566;this is one of director's Danny Boyle's first films and he creates near perfection.
567;"The only actor with any true film background is Robert ""The Full Monty"" Carlisle but everyone is universally great."
568;Very harsh, very true, very good!!!!
569;As many critics waited for that scene where our hero(or anti.
570;Like the lead character in GOODFELLAS Henry Hill, he is unrepentant by the end of the movie.
571;I promise that you won't shift in your seat once before the end.
572;Director Danny Boyle's visual imagination is unending, some scenes manage to be puke.
573;achingly funny at the same time.
574;A film which successfully threads humour with shocking realism.
575;hollywood feel of the film, but for the rest of us, this is a well.
576;made and thought provoking film.
577;Everyone knew the name, the poster, probably some of the dialogue, even if they hadn't seen the film, and if you hadn't you felt like you were missing out on something special!
578;so what makes this film so special.
579;Great performances, cool soundtrack, sharp dialogue, a storyline that is as harrowing as it is funny.
580;It really just captured the mood of a nation, and showed drug use with brutal honesty, not with glamour or with unneccesary preaching.
581;being British in 1996 and seeing this was a very special thing, but it is still a magnificent film for any audience that withstands repeated viewings.
582;A truly unique cinematic experience.
583;This excellent film portraying the grim reality of drug culture in today's society is something every one should see.
584;To prevent us from turning away from the nasty bits in the tale there are some incredibly funny bits which add to the tragedy of the tale, a brilliant soundtrack and a good pace as well as some fascinating, though hardly likeable, characters such as the psychotic Begbie and wide boy Sick Boy.
585;a very good film indeed and is certainly a good public health warning against drug.
586;I loved everything about this film.
587;The cast has this amazing chemistry and each actor really becomes their character.
588;"The opening lines are classic: ""I chose not to choose life."
589;The other thing about this film is the use of music to shift time.
590;What the film uses instead is a brilliant soundtrack in which each track helps shift the movie to new year or a new decade.
591;I have yet to read the book, but if books are better than films that I'm sure to be impressed.
592;This breakthrough film from director Danny Boyle (The Beach, 28 Days Later) was an international hit that deserves all the critical acclaim it garnered and helped launch the career of actor Ewan McGregor.
593;Director Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge manage to transfer what is an unfilmable book to film thanks to the off the wall hyperkinetic humor and the brilliant cast.
594;Robert Carlyle's performance as the fight provoking, hard drinking Begbie is excellent as he goes from humerous to frightening in the snap of a finger.
595;This is one of my favourite movies ever, it is called the Clock Work Orange from the 90s, acting is great and the plot is really movin.
596;My friends and I really enjoyed this very creative and insightful movie.
597;If you like movies such as requiem for a dream, fear and lothing in las vegas, kids, and any tarintino flicks I highly recommend it.
598;One of the best drug movies ever.
599;Truly a must see for children 5 and up.
600;This is a horribly amusing movie full of witty little lessons.
601;I think it works wonders on curious teenagers.
602;Mind provoking, startling, the type of movie you cover your eyes during, but still peek through your fingers because you don't want to miss it.
603;McGregor is extraordinary, Bremmer is charming.
604;While the film incorporates more comic relief than the novel, the story is no less entertaining.
605;One of Ewen MacGregors first big films, I find this one of the most realistic, gritty and at times, digusting films to come out in a long time.
606;a very dark movie, with the most accurate potrayal of junkies perhaps ever seen in a major movie, this movie is also sad, funny, and full of hope in some places, and the depths of woe in others.You find yourself sympathasising with the main character, hoping he can overcome his addiction and move on to a better life.
607;the music was exceptional and fit the ever.
608;The scenery from Scotland is beautiful and provides a nice contrast to the depressing state of the characters.
609;In short, one of my favorite movies ever.
610;Having witnessed many forms of addiction throughout my life, I have to say, this film excellently portrays the sorts of lives addicts lead and the challenges they face.
611;It's unusual mix of horror and humor make it difficult to classify, but its storyline and characterizations are heavily engrossing and keep you glued throughout.
612;Certainly this is great film making.
613;the film lifts its material from the book of the same name.
614;But it's a combination of factors.
615;The film makes one ask, what will be the straw that breaks the camel's back?Aside from a brilliant screenplay, the film boasts one of the best ensemble casts.
616;While known for making Ewan MacGregor a recognizeable face, it also features the talented Johnny Lee Miller as the James Bond obsessed Sick Boy as well as the infallable Robert Carlyle as the sadistic Begbie.
617;It also ports over the Criterion laserdisc extras, including a wonderful commentary featuring Ewan, Danny Boyle, and John Hodge.
618;In addition, there's some newly included production vignettes and, to me what is still the best feature, a number of deleted scenes .
619;This is a feast for fans.
620;I thought it was a really fun watch.
621;i'll give it 1 star for ewan.
622;Trainspotting is an extraordinarily well crafted film in terms of the various elements of film technique.
623;Money is everywhere, as are drugs, those of discontent housewives, and those found in bars, as well as illegal ones.
624;Neglect of youth is generational and a threat to young life and society.
625;Theme is brilliantly expressed via the superb acting of Ewan MacGregor and all the others.
626;Nothing is left to chance, no detail too unimportant to convey, in the brilliant directing work of Danny Boyle.
627;all is incredibly and expertly choreographed to Bowie's and Iggy Pop's title track.
628;It is also rich with blackly humorous dialogue, acting and camera work.
629;The film is visually stunning, poetically inspiring and meticulously directed.
630;And it raises a few more questions about the values of society than it answers, which is what any decent work of art should do.
631;I am one of a small handful of people that pretty much disliked this movie.
632;I gave it 2 stars because it has some uniquely creative aspects to it, but I do not care for the basic style it was made in.
633;I would have really enjoyed this film if was told in a serious and realistic manner similar to that of other drug films like Christiane F., which in my opinion is probably the best film about heroin addicts ever made.
634;the mannerisms of the story and filming technique that are there to get noticed for their flashy artistry.
635;The film had such a powerful story to tell, so why muck it up with a bunch of silly artistic flashiness?
636;For me this style of film making rarely works.
637;And I love his films for the most part.
638;Stone did well with artistic imagery in that film and 'The Doors', which I loved.
639;I much prefer films that have a flair of psychedelia that were made in the 60's or 70's if they are going to be that way.
640;This movie is a true classic.
641;Ewan McGregor is funny, troubling, cowardly and brave all at the same time.
642;"I will say that ""Trainspotting"" is not a movie for everyone, it should be respected for its' ""R"" rating, and it is one heck of a movie."
643;"not long ago, I had the pleasure to watch ""The Full Monty"" which has a greater renown than ""Trainspotting"" and deals as well with the subject of the down and out in urban Great Britain."
644;That movie let us have fun while coming to understand a stagnant society that offered little hope of change to its' citizens.
645;"I will admit that, although I rarely laugh out loud when I'm watching a movie by myself, there is one grossly hilarious scene in ""Trainspotting"" that had me laughing boisterously out loud."
646;"As I saw scene after scene that stung my senses and sensitivity, I could not help but marvel at the ability of the writer and director
647;Even in capitalist America, heroin is a favorite in the Urban Pockets of Social Welfare.
648;Ewan McGregor is a fine looking young man and he has a choice,live or stick a needle.
649;Groovy Dude and the Blue Meanies are so hip, man.
650;Trainspotting is ranked in top ten British movies ever made by some ranking services.
651;So, I bought it and, yes the drug use is off.
652;putting, and the intensity is searing.
653;It is definitely one of those movies I will watch often.
654;Can't say I'd recommend it to anyone (especially don't watch it while you're eating dinner) but McGregor and his fellow cast mates do a fine job of portraying these lost souls.
655;i can honestly say that this is one of my favorite movies.
656;it's tone varies from being upbeat and humorous, to somewhat depressing, and really bizarre, but it stays very entertaining the whole way through.
657;its got a great set of characters, and their constant randomness keeps the movie interesting through what isn't exactly a specific plot.
658;the directing, the constant inner monologue, and the scottish dialect make it just a fun movie to see, and i watch it pretty much whenever i can.
659;Bearing that in mind, I think Trainspotting is quite well done.
660;In some ways it is.
661;the characters are funny, and larger than life, easily able to get through 90% of their troubles even when these things could be profound issues in real life.
662;makes it all worth it"
663;cut look to the part that seems so contradictory to the lifestyle embraced by the character.
664;One of the best anti.
665;And if this film will save even one person from learning about drugs the hard way, then it will have made the endeavor entirely worthwhile.
666;Be advised, this film is more educational than entertaining, and definitely an experience.
667;What was so special that it got Two Thumbs Up?
668;The acting was well, Sick Boy was a great character and the rest were fairly good.
669;After a few months I will watch the film again and see if my views have changed either way.
670;Definitely a heavy, anguish laden story but very well crafted.
671;Trainspotting is in some regards a masterpiece of film making.
672;The portrayal of the deadend heroin addicted lives of a group of friends in Scotland is one of the most despairing looks at drug abuse and it's lethal appeal ever committed to film.
673;It is also incredibly funny in parts at the same time.
674;That is what makes the film so unique.
675;that said I can't recommend the film to everyone.
676;If you have the stomach for it you will be rewarded with one of the best films of the 90's.
677;It is open, honest, and brutally direct.
678;What is amazing about it is how blackly funny they all are, as they dive into toilets, allow babies and friends to die, burst into violent rages, and seek some kind of fantastical out.
679;The acting is so good that you can believe all of their chaotic lives that can go nowhere but down or prison.
680;"Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, there's another reason to watch it again
681;Ewan Mc Gregor's greatest work.
682;I watched this and I thought to meself.
683;Ewan McGregor is absolutely brillant and perfectly cast for the role of our heroic (?)
684;The characters are, by no means, sterling examples of humanity but they're fascinating and irresistable.
685;Other than that it's hilarious and will have you changing your pronunciation of several words because the Scottish way is just more fun:)
686;This must be one of the best movies ever.
687;The surealisum of how live acutally is comes through in this very entertaining movie.
688;Its deep and touchs on some of lifes more harsh side, but also is lighthearted and very comical .
689;I found this film by accident, and I have to say that I really enjoyed it.
690;The baby scene is magnificent.
691;Something to look at, maybe, but not a exceptional film.
692;'Trainspotting' puts the viewer right inside the minds and lives of heroin addicted people, and it's not pretty.
693;He introduces his other friends .
694;For me, this film has two parts.
695;The second (which begins around the time the baby dies) is intense, especially the detox scene.
696;I happen to find every manic, funny, intense moment of this film entertaining.
697;The performances are fantastic, the music great, and the direction innovative.
698;It's entertaining on a sick level, and, of course, Ewan McGreggor fans might be somewhat surprised at what the cheeky.
699;grinned Scot is up to, but for those who can take it, Trainspotting is very, very good.
700;This is one of the best films ever made.
701;I saw this movie when it first came out and it remains one of my most favorite movies.
702;There's an unforgettable scat scene with morning sheets that will be sure to turn your stomach.
703;set to a great soundtrack and filled with witty dialogue (although absolutely filled with flagrant curses) and narrative, 'Trainspotting' highlights not just the differences between """"Us And Them"""" but the differences between the addicts themselves."""
704;if you're a fan of the addiction movie, then this is a must.
705;The movie is ok and certainly has its own cult following.
706;this movie succeeds as a quirky, humorous look at disenchatment in modern society.
707;the main character is played by Ewan McGregor, and he gives a fine performance.
708;The supporting actors are also good.
709;Great actors crawl out of every cut in the film to deliver stunning performances.
710;With its tongue firmly planted in one cheek, it employs glorious wit and a razor sharp narrative to drive home other points.
711;Deleted scenes and a feature length commentary round up the extras.
712;Try getting hold of that one if possible to include this truly grand movie from the 90s into your collection.
713;He and his friends are hopless and addicted to heroin and it isn't pretty.
714;This movie dosen't try to make drugs seem cool or nice.
715;Geezs I sure wish I had their life.
716;I liked that this move covred both sides.
717;and I love the way they didn't come out in a after.
718;Over all this was just a good movie.
719;One you'll remember long after you've watched it.
720;up from all this darkness or to make things even mroe stark, here are also sharp moments of humour, such as Spud's Speed.
721;The guy who said he hated all the band son it must peddle a unique taste in music, as many of these tracks are classics.
722;There is a unique outlook on life and the actual power of friends.
723;I recommend this movie highly and won't spoil any of it for you.
724;That being said, this film is brilliant.
725;Trainspotting is easily one of the best movies I've ever seen.
726;It's hilarious for one, unavoidably engaging in its entirety, and graphically disturbing.
727;It's black and white masterfully intertwined.
728;An excellent source of introspection and social comparison, these are several aspects a free.
729;Danny Boyle and the film crew's biggest success is how in the end they neither glorified nor condemned the 'wonderful world that is heroin addiction'.
730;The energy of the opening scene was Awesome.
731;The whole ride was great.
732;The characters were so real.
733;The collaboration with the amazing Director and uber talented cast gave a us a true to life account of that kind of life ,and not to judge.
734;Most hilarious a rare few so so shockingly sad.
735;I have so much to say about this gem.
736;which made it all the funnier.
737;I worked on this movie and was really proud to be a part if it.
738;Danny Boyle's masterpiece in my opinion on the glamorous and horrific sides of heroin users consequences when addicted to the drug.
739;Outstanding performances by every one in the film.
740;Not only is the movie excellent, so too are the soundtracks, I and II.
741;I reccomend you Watch it!
742;It was an excellent choice to wake up early to watch it!The acting is great and so is the directing!
743;see and if you don't see it your misisng out!
744;Warped and twisted and absolutely aweful!
745;for me, a movie has to stay with you long after the credits roll.
746;It has to make you think and feel.
747;It has to subject you to a roller coaster ride of emotions.
748;pants laugh, think, cheer wildly and discuss it with your friends years after you first saw it.
749;THAT, my friends, is the sign of a GREAT movie.
750;another great feature of Trainspotting is the soundtrack.
751;It features many of my favorites, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, etc.
752;The soundtrack is perfect for this movie.
753;THAT is another sign of a great movie.
754;The acting is fine with McGregor and Carlyle giving standout performances, but this is about all the film has going for it.
755;it was a great movie.
756;And i still want to see it again.
757;It makes fun of and also understands, and doesn't make any excuses.
758;Main character, cool in all of his movies.
759;This movie made me uncomfortable at some parts, but that's because its so real.
760;It has that kind of power.
761;It's raw and beautiful and terrible at the same time.
762;All I have to say is that it is chilling in every sense of the word.
763;I rate this a must see for everyone who needs to learn the horror a drug like heroin can inflict on someone.
764;He finds it is near impossible as his former heroine buddies continue to pop back into his life.
765;One of the blackest of black comedies that has drawn me back again and again.
766;And even under multiple viewing, the story, the acting, the film as a whole, holds up tremendously.
767;very well written in acted on all levels.
768;The film stays mostly true to the incredible Irvine Welsh novel, with most of the dialogue and narration lifted right off the pages.
769;An incredible soundtrack and a star.
770;making performance from Ewan MacGregor and indeed the rest of the ensemble cast top off what in my book is a must.
771;It shows the real life with a sort of second degree which give interrest to the story.
772;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
773;Except for the fantasy sequences, it provides a very scientifically accurate picture of opioid addiction.
774;The narrative structure and pacing is a thing of beauty.
775;It alternates between high excitement and low excitement, good mood and bad mood, and builds to a very satisfying finish.
776;it provides a nuanced picture of addiction.
777;'Trainspotting' definitely lived up to the hype that surrounded the film when it was released a few years ago.
778;Its portrayal of a motley crew of heroin addicts and sociopaths is done with an impeccable eye for direction and is effectively chilling.
779;Ewan McGregor is spectacular in his character's willful helplessness against heroin addiction.
780;The rest of the cast does an exquisite job of portraying the utter meaninglessness that becomes part and parcel of the heroin.
781;The film has its intense and revolting moments.
782;portrayed characterizations, Trainspotting will please.
783;The soundtrack is actually a compliment to this film, rather than a detriment, featuring the music of Iggy Pop and Lou Reed, among others.
784;I am so pleased that Amazon included Trainspotting along with the many other awesome titles included with Prime Instant Video.
785;So buckle your seatbelts and (I hope you) enjoy the wild ride.
786;Through loving parants and a high school student he accidentally had relations with, Mark manages to begin enjoying life.
787;Even when temptation arrives again in the form of his mates he still manages to free himself eventhough he admits to being a bad person he knows he is on the right track with our without the people that made a major impression on his life.
788;this story is one of the most relatable ones I have seen in all the movies I have seen that tell this story.
789;Yet a time comes in all our lives where we must face the real world put aside the childish games and sacrifce our time to jobs and keep our lives in line with modern society.
790;people who bring up this inexistent controversy only shy away from that fact that this is a great movie.
791;the shot sequences are amazing, and the perspective of drugs is eye opening.
792;I thought it would be funnier.
793;Some die, some decline, some question and herein lies the attraction.
794;Questioning is possible, separation is possible.
795;If you havent seen this movie then you better get it because it is one of the best movies in the world if you like movies like Fight Club or The Matrix then im sure youll love this one.
796;"While there is definitely a form of macabre humor to this tail, ""Trainspotting,"" one of the most brilliant films to come out of Britain in decades, is no laughing matter."
797;it captures an entire voice.
798;so what makes it so brilliant?
799;(And it's a favorite movie.)
800;Its setting and subject matter were somewhat grim to put it mildly, but that didn't stop Trainspotting from becoming one of the top movies of the nineties, and having just watched it this morning I can safely state that it holds up well to this day.
801;While I haven't read the Irvine Welsh novel on which this movie is based, I have read some of his other work, and the movie is a perfect distillation of his storytelling style.
802;fire, filled with bawdy set pieces, characters living on the edge of acceptable society, and lots and lots of swears.
803;cool soundtrack, that emerged with such force in the nineties and spawned so many imitations in this decade.
804;Trainspotting is a blunt, unapologetic look a life most of us can scarcely imagine, delivered with a combination of hilarity and horror that effortlessly intertwines these two extremes.
805;Perhaps most impressively, it manages to contain one of my all.
806;"time top ten movie lines (""Who needs reasons when you've got heroin?"")"
807;"brilliant), and more ""Oh my God, did I just see that?"""
808;Really, that's what the movie's about.
809;the relentless pursuit of that elusive and nebulous concept known as happiness.
810;Viewed against this backdrop, it's easy to ask whether the straight life is even worth it.
811;the downside to this is lots of the emotion and effect is taken out of key scenes when doing this .
812;this is the best of both worlds.
813;this is one of the greatest movies ever .
814;it has to be experienced to the fullest!
815;Theres nothing I can say that will explain the greatness of this film.
816;If you like films that explore the seedy underbelly of society than you will love this.
817;This film also has a very serious nature to it as well.
818;Everyone should watch it so they have a realistic perspective on heroin.
819;Very entertaining movie for sure.
