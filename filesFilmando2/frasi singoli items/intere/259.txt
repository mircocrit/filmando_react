I:413;1;The action sequences are awesome.
I:413;2;I recommend this movie to anyone who loves war and action films.
I:413;3;Nothing spectacular about it, but it is enjoyable.
I:413;4;He is another hollywood legend and to mark another notch in this belt with this movie!
I:413;5;"Watch for the football section in the water and listen for ""Wilson!"""
I:413;6;This film has some of the best flight sequences I have ever seen.
I:413;7;"The cinematography is superb, and one gets a glimpse into the speed a pilot experiences as he tries to outmaneuver an oncoming missile
I:413;8;Though some characters are somewhat cartoonish, and the script at times silly, much of the acting is good.
I:413;9;Gene Hackman can always be depended upon for a solid performance, and Owen Wilson does well as the main protagonist, who starts out as being a rather shallow, whiny fellow, and grows with his extreme experience, as he plays a cat and mouse chase with a Serbian tracker , played by Russian actor Vladimir Maskov.
I:413;10;Gabriel Macht is excellent in the smaller part of the fighter pilot Stackhouse.Yes, there are times the plot is contrived and not altogether believable, but this is more than made up for by the dazzling cinematography by Brandan Galvin, a fine score by Don Davis, and astounding visual and sound effects.
I:413;11;and if you like jets and choppers the way I do, you are guaranteed to like this film.
I:413;12;I really liked both of the main actors but I especially like Gene Hackman.
I:413;13;This product was cheep in great condition and arrived before my final for history.
I:413;14;I was very happy with it
I:413;15;Top stars and fast paced plot keep you riveted to the screen!
I:413;16;3 3 it's a really good movie.
I:413;17;:) its intense, emotional, interesting, kind of funny sometimes.
I:413;18;From a technical standpoint the film is very well done, and despite some unrealistic moments, the script is also well thought out and nicely handled by director John Moore.
I:413;19;The action sequences have a nice balance of gloss and grit to create a realistic yet entertaining effect, and even the acting is nicely done.
I:413;20;Owen Wilson is not the type of actor you'd initially attribute to `serious cinema', especially since he can't seem to do anything but mug the camera for laughs (he often seems so insincere to me, which occasionally works, like in 'Zoolander' where it benefited his character), but he actually does a really good job here, handling a conventional character in an unconventional way.
I:413;21;Keeps you on your toes all the way thru the movie.
I:413;22;True to the point it's all about the Politics
I:413;23;noone actually shows himself at his best in a war.
I:413;24;Brave pilot, noble commanding officer, proud civilian helpers, cunning villains .
I:413;25;what else do you need for an excellent action film?!
I:413;26;Plus awesome special effects (the scene when the fighter jet is shot down is just frantic), beautiful landscapes, good actors.
I:413;27;by the way bonus features have some extended scenes and they are gorier than they are in the film.
I:413;28;a few good action scenes.
I:413;29;hackman's and Charles Malik Whitfield's charactersThe overall:I have seen better movies than this.
I:413;30;If you like war movies, I recommend something better like The Patriot or something because this one is not the one.
I:413;31;go some incredible camera work which continued throughout the film and the three main characters were very well acted, how can you go wrong with Gene Hackman and good ol' Owen Wilson?
I:413;32;video style shots and jarring action.
I:413;33;Because of the times we live in, I found this quite chilling despite the supposed noble outcome of Wilson's character's actions.
I:413;34;I really liked this movie.
I:413;35;A lot of people didn't, I'm sure, but as an action movie, it does very well.
I:413;36;The flight sequence was very well done, especially when they start firing the missiles.
I:413;37;Watch this for the action and the pretty well.
I:413;38;Honestly, this is my favorite movie of all times.
I:413;39;Owen Wilson delivers an awesome performance that will make you proud to be American.
I:413;40;Saw it in the theatre.
I:413;41;He said the translations were really well done.
I:413;42;Very good movie, a lot of action and Owen Wilson is really good in this role.
I:413;43;Added it to my collection of other great movies.
I:413;44;Take one standard action film involving Americans, add in a new baddie for them to triumph over, and have the baddies act atrociously and brutally, then let the good guys be victorious in the end.
I:413;45;It has reasonable special effects, a plot that is simple and oh so seen before, and a square jawed handsome hero (although, looking at Wilson's nose, not that handsome).
I:413;46;One thing is certain, though.
I:413;47;as for the movie, the opening scenes are the most rewarding.
I:413;48;This is a very entertaining and visually pleasing film, one that will capture your interest and propel it along for the almost two hours of the movie.
I:413;49;"So, while this is no ""to Hell And Back', it is an exciting escapist excursion you will enjoy watching."
I:413;50;The scenes filmed on the carrier are especially graphic and well done, and the shots of the planes coming off the deck are breath taking.
I:413;51;so too the aerial photography is very well choreographed and accomplished, and the action shots of the plane being engaged by ground batteries fairly realistic in its technical details.
I:413;52;The cast is quite good, with Owen Wilson playing the downed flier and Gene Hackman the Carrier skipper who is trying to get him back.
I:413;53;The special effects are great, especially the aero battle.
I:413;54;that said, I did enjoy it on an action movie parody level.
I:413;55;It plays out like some kind of cartoon and I encourage anyone with a sense of humor to indulge.
I:413;56;You will finish with a smile on your face.

I:413;58;The trouble is, a peace treaty was recently signed between America and those chasing Burnett, so if Admiral Reigart dares and goes after him, his entire command is at stake.
I:413;59;Director John Moore never gives it a rest.
I:413;60;This is one of the all time great military action movies with powerful, compelling and gripping story lines.
I:413;61;Taut, exciting thriller about a gung.

I:413;63;The last third gets extremely ridiculous (resolve all complications with lots of explosions and loud music), but until then the action is jam packed with lots of fun and extreme tension!
I:413;64;what makes this movie entertaining is the slick direction of the action scenes.
I:413;65;Another Great movie with Great Actors, I could watch it over and over again.
I:413;66;But can you honestly deny that the guy is hilarious?
I:413;67;Everything I've seen him in is a riot.
I:413;68;For him becoming a high.
I:413;69;A good movie, not a great film.
I:413;70;In a way, the movie is kind of cheesy, but in a way it is also really good.
I:413;71;I always enjoy watching it!
I:413;72;See it, if you haven't.
I:413;73;Thus, being restricted to whole numbers, I found four to be the appropriate number.
I:413;74;A score of four should for movies that, although not great, are solidly good and have moments of greatness.
I:413;75;In short, it has some nice cinematography and a very nice CGI shoot.
I:413;76;He's great as a comedic actor and I'd be interested to see him in a serious role, but this wasn't quite right.
I:413;77;Gene Hackman is, as always, great as the hard.
I:413;78;Gene Hackman is always good in a film.
I:413;79;This movie is a good shoot 'em up.
I:413;80;ray discs) and he said WHOAA with a capital W.!
I:413;81;Still forsaking the hero being shot to pieces, I still like it.
I:413;82;Most of it seems real, and our hero isn't perfect by any means.
I:413;83;The support cast is great and you love and hate them accordingly.
I:413;84;The scenes are so well photographed that they actually add some reality to what otherwise would be to over the top.
I:413;85;That and Hackman's and Wilson's performances are great.
I:413;86;Lots of action, good actors, interesting story line (based on a true story), and positive view of American Military personnel.
I:413;87;I was very pleasantly surprised.
I:413;88;although not completely accurate, it was still a great action film that kept me interested the entire time.
I:413;89;I thought the acting from Gene Hackman was wonderful, and Owen Wilson did a great job, as well.
I:413;90;Although predictable at times, this is one of those rare films in which, even though you know what will happen, you STILL want to see it.
I:413;91;And I love Gene Hackman, so I wanted, I really wanted to like this movie.
I:413;92;had mentioned it,the movie is generally based on how realistic and good a movie can be made by small budget.
I:413;93;I've always loved this movie!
I:413;94;The whole disinchanted Navy Pilot, gets a lesson in the value of being, an American , and a member of the Armed Forces works well.
I:413;95;Gene Hackman turns in another fine performance, as Wilson's CO.
I:413;96;The part where he starts talking to Wilson over the radio to get his pilot to calm down, and collect himself works well.
I:413;97;Great movie I would recommend it for anyone.
I:413;98;Behind Enemy Lines is an entertaining and intelligent action/thriller starring Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson.
I:413;99;This movie kept me on the edge of my seat, and suprised me with a few twists.
I:413;100;Definitley a great film, I would give it four and a half stars if possible.
I:413;101;Relative to all the mediocre movies out there, this is very good.
I:413;102;Great effects, character development and plot.
I:413;103;In these times, when the world is concerned with terrorism, it seems logical to create a movie based on an American hero who beats the odds and defeats the enemy.
I:413;104;The first twenty minutes are interesting .
I:413;105;the introduction of all the characters, including the rebels, played by Owen Wilson and Gabriel Macht.
I:413;106;it still manages to make you laugh at the same time.
I:413;107;I honestly truly enjoyed the film and Owen Wilson did an incredible acting job in it.
I:413;108;Gene Hackman does a great job playing the commander with compassion.
I:413;109;The ending of the film is not surprise, but it gives you a little, warm fuzzy feeling inside.
I:413;110;This film is certainly worth watching!
I:413;111;He should stick to comedy and helping Wes Anderson create genius movies.
I:413;112;Actually I found myself saying it would be cool if he died right here.
I:413;113;Obviously he's yet another commercial director, based on the frenetic herky.
I:413;114;Behind Enemy Lines is an awesome war/action film!
I:413;115;Its a great film period!
I:413;116;Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman are a great team/cast for this movie!
I:413;117;They are both awesome actors!
I:413;118;This film had a good plot!This film ,while watching it, makes you feel like you are there.
I:413;119;all through the movie you are rigth there with Burnett(Wilson) feeling his pain,joy,ect. and also Admiral Reigart's(Hackman).
I:413;120;I mean its just nonstop action!
I:413;121;And fun!Personally I give this film 5 stars.
I:413;122;s. Owen Wilson is cute!
I:413;123;Behind Enemy Lines is a good movie with the same holes and problems that one finds with any movie that simulates real life military operations.
I:413;124;The storyline is just great it moves quickly and the movie is really over before you even know it.
I:413;125;When his plane is shot down and his pilot murdered Burnett must do everything he can to stay alive.
I:413;126;Although there are several very corny lines by Gene Hackman the movie has generally a very good plot.
I:413;127;If you enjoy watching Owen Wilson this is a great movie.
I:413;128;inspired multilateral lunacy and diplomatic dastardliness.
I:413;129;hueys, F.18 fighter jets, Harriers, Migs, old main Soviet battle tanks, APCs, tac.
I:413;130;"anyway, let's bring it back to the flick: ""Behind Enemy Lines"" is crisp to behold, and follows Wilson on his little trek through a Balkan hellhole: Wilson does what he has to do like a champ."
I:413;131;shined core is a truly killer scene, one that sets it apart from and above the usual whack.
I:413;132;it's a deft, brutal scene, beautifully illustrated and gorgeously paced.
I:413;133;A lot of action is contained in this movie that keeps the audiences interested.
I:413;134;The computer effects are at its prime, remaining realistic.
I:413;135;looking, that keep audiences amazed.
I:413;136;Its sound effects from the weapons offer a more intense experience to the action theme.
I:413;137;Behind Enemy Lines is great for those curious to what happened.
I:413;138;Some mixed reviews may arise upon the movie outcome, but it has many interesting moments.
I:413;139;I like this movie because of the transformation in attitude of the main character.
I:413;140;The flight scene where flight crew gets shot down is spectacular.
I:413;141;This is a classic 'B' movie.
I:413;142;Behind Enemy Lines is a great example of the action film that is so fast.
I:413;143;paced, so visually dazzling, and so tense that the viewer doesn't have much time to think about the film itself.
I:413;144;the tight pacing serves the movie well, as the viewer is thrust from one suspenseful scene to another, with barely time to breathe between each.
I:413;145;Both symbolic of the theme and visually powerful is the enormous statue of the Virgin Mary that Burnett parachutes past, her face beautiful on one side, blown away on the other.
I:413;146;Upon seeing this early in the movie, you know that this action film will have its message.
I:413;147;this thriller provides great, tense escapism, with people, buildings, and trucks blowing up or being shot to pieces every few minutes.
I:413;148;The suspense is aided by several original scenes, such as the heat.
I:413;149;I was riveted throughout despite its over.
I:413;150;The strongest feature of this film is its ability to draw the viewer into the plot and keep him there.
I:413;151;But the film is alot of fun to watch.
I:413;152;The individual is all, damn the big picture.
I:413;153;I do give this movie 2 stars because the action is non.
I:413;154;is this a thrill ride or what.
I:413;155;The action sceens were fantastic.
I:413;156;It's parallel to past situations in western Europe make for a great hero movie.
I:413;157;After you see this movie you will want to start it over from the begining.
I:413;158;This is one of those movies I've always heard about but just now finally watched it.
I:413;159;One of the better movies I've seen in quite a while!
I:413;160;Interesting and exciting from the minute it begins till the minute it ends.
I:413;161;Of course through the whole movie you know the guy is going to survive, but getting there is a real thrill ride.
I:413;162;This is an instant classic to me.
I:413;163;Video telling a story is the essence of cinema, and director John Moore succeeds masterully via a breathless array of action scenes.
I:413;164;"around shots
I:413;165;And it's all grand fun.
I:413;166;wearing Russian actor is the perfect predator.
I:413;167;"To top it all off, director Moore even takes a potshot or two at politically correct international posturing
I:413;168;its a very good movie,my wife and I enjoyed it very much.
I:413;169;Gene Hackman was, as always, a good actor.
I:413;170;one of those that I don't really enjoy, but manages to be just barely interesting enough to keep me watching it, even though I know how it will end.
I:413;171;And Gene Hackman was good as the admiral torn by the duty to the soldier under his command and the orders he received from higher up.
I:413;172;It was also hard keeping up with all the subtitles.
I:413;173;probably people who are more into war movies than I am will enjoy this, but those looking for a good action flick should look somewhere else.
I:413;174;def, when M:I:3 looks a lot better, is packed with features, and costs less.
I:413;175;If you're looking for a movie with action, suspense, blood, and big guns, you'll love this movie.
I:413;176;The effects are incredible, especially the first part of the film, before they get shot down over enemy territory.
I:413;177;The acting is great and, boy.
I:413;178;It's like the writers said merh, good enough, lets shoot the movie now.
I:413;179;If you enjoy war movies.
I:413;180;This is set in Bosnia and just a great story about great men and women that put their lives on the line for others.
I:413;181;Either way, consider the possibility that it takes a pretty cool customer to survive that type of situation.
I:413;182;this movie combined many of the new directing techniques that have been evolving in the last few years.
I:413;183;They contribute to the energy and (I'm assuming) the realism of some action scenes, which are pretty spectacular in this movie.
I:413;184;It added some depth to the story.
I:413;185;The ending belonged in a James Bond film, all we needed was a babe pulling him into the helicopter.
I:413;186;I was pleased enough with the rest of the movie to overlook that.
I:413;187;this is one of those movies you will enjoy the sound effects also the movie.
I:413;188;The movie has great action, one you will see again.
I:413;189;It kept me on the edge of my seat.
I:413;190;Well, despite a few very minor errors, this is a great action movie.
I:413;191;"It's one of those movies that at times tends to keep you at the edge of your seat waiting on ""how is the main character gonna evade his pursuers this time?"""
I:413;192;The movie is great in the sense that it has lots of action for all those action.
I:413;193;junkies like myself, and yet it still makes a lot of sense.
I:413;194;The movie is suspenseful in a sense and has a great story, plus occasional comedy relief from no other than Owen Wilson.
I:413;195;Some do consider Owen to be completely wrong for this part but he kind of has the right chemistry for the role.
I:413;196;"Plus, him and Gene Hackman kind of connect and depict in many ways a relationship between a ""captain"" and his ""troop""."
I:413;197;Plus the movie is directed really well that it makes this film seem so much more realistic.
I:413;198;Overall, a fun, exciting movie for the family, and it really does deserve the full five stars.
I:413;199;It's a great action, and for people looking for a simple tool for entertainment, this movie is definately a must.
I:413;200;That is one of the truest things of the movie, for NATO really did not help ONE BIT.
I:413;201;so again, its was a great movie.
I:413;202;enacting their time of tribulation simply to entertain Americans.
I:413;203;I'd do the same, they made the right choice.
I:413;204;but it has more to it .
I:413;205;"this story has been told more than once in previous films , having ""First Blood ."
I:413;206;"Part II"" as being the most famous , as far as I can remember : The U. s. government decided to leave Rambo behind at the rendezvous point on account of , again , political reasons ."
I:413;207;"I remember hearing the advancement of the Israeli endeavors in ""doing something and bringing him safely home"" ."
I:413;208;emerging , once again , by an engagement of a full.
I:413;209;in the end , I do hope this story would give some food for thought to persons that could find themselves in similar situations in the future to come .
I:413;210;the attempts to dodge the missiles are fantastic .
I:413;211;there has been a while since I was so tensed and thrilled .
I:413;212;this is one of the top performances Hollywood has orchestrated in years .
I:413;213;the two are hit , manage to abort , but the enemy catches the pilot .
I:413;214;That leaves our hero all alone and on the run .
I:413;215;As mentioned , the rescue missions are delayed again and again , due to the region's political agenda , bringing in the extra value I discussed earlier .
I:413;216;in the end , Gene Hackman , the Carrier's admiral , takes matters into his own hands , to come up with a impressive finale .
I:413;217;Rather , he's an ordinary likeable fellow , with the knowledge of survival techniques and great amount of luck .
I:413;218;"I think it is this that makes the story more appealing than the familiar ""run and hide"" type of films ."
I:413;219;gene Hackman , long after his prime , gives a good portrayal of his character's inability and powerlessness at first , then his pains and dilemmas , and ultimately his resolution of doubts and action .
I:413;220;That's also exactly why this movie is so fun.
I:413;221;the scenery in this movie is really great, and so is the sound design.
I:413;222;I think stuff like that is great.
I:413;223;The acting is good, too, if at times a hint shallow.
I:413;224;if you don't take this too seriously, which you're not supposed to, you will really enjoy rooting for the good guys in this movie.
I:413;225;Nonetheless, there were enough good pieces here for me to enjoy the movie.
I:413;226;This movie was great for about the first 30 or 45 minutes of the movie.
I:413;227;"All in all, ""Behind Enemy Lines"" is a great movie with endless possibilities, but no plot."
I:413;228;One of the best fighter jet movies out there.
I:413;229;Actually prefer this over top gun.
I:413;230;Very good action footage and story line.
I:413;231;john Moore is a rookie director that does a terrific job with the technical elements of the film.
I:413;232;He presents a very realistic look and feel in the carrier scenes and the air combat scene is first rate.
I:413;233;"Actually, all the action sequences are outstanding, no doubt in large part due to the work of twenty year stunt veteran Steve Davison (""End of Days"", ""Batman and Robin""), who was the second unit director and stunt coordinator."
I:413;234;This film also blends stunt photography seamlessly with visual effects to produce extremely realistic action scenes.
I:413;235;this is Owen Wilson's first film in the lead and while he does a good job, he just isn't serious action.
I:413;236;Wilson projects a naturally sarcastic, smart aleck personality that works in some of the scenes in this film, but when it gets to the macho action sequences, he just can't carry it.
I:413;237;He was terrific in Shanghai Noon, where the action was all tongue.
I:413;238;In that film, his wisecracking humor was a perfect fit.
I:413;239;gene Hackman plays a supporting role and as always gives us a solid performance as Admiral Reigart.
I:413;240;if you like action films and you are not too fussy about implausible stories, this film delivers.
I:413;241;I rated it a 7/10 based on the marvelous stunt work and visual effects and the realistic military look and feel.
I:413;242;This was a great movie!
I:413;243;Great cinamatography, great casting, great acting, great graphics, great plotline, great story.
I:413;244;Every few seconds I was telling my boyfriend (who hadn't seen it) Oh this is the best part!
I:413;245;It is so well done with the stop action and the thing with the statue in the beginning is so cool.
I:413;246;I recommend this movie to anyone!
I:413;247;Behind Enemy Lines is one of my all time favorites.
I:413;248;keep you in suspense all the time.
I:413;249;also givean inside look to the dedication of our men at war.
I:413;250;it really made me think about the important things in life and what freindship really means.
I:413;251;owen wilson gives another great performance.
I:413;252;gene hackman is great as usual.
I:413;253;defenetly the best and most emotional action movie i have ever seen!!
I:413;254;In the end, he makes a great transition to this genre.
I:413;255;all in all, this is an enjoyable movie that moves quickly and is always keeping your attention with action and drama.
I:413;256;While I am no qualified movie critic, I felt compelled to write on this one.
I:413;257;It was awesome to realize this was based on a true story.
I:413;258;I really wanted to like and enjoy it.
I:413;259;It moved at a lethargic pace.
I:413;260;Actualy Joaquim de Almeida, a very underated actor, came out the most memorable and believable.
I:413;261;Based on a true incident, it's gripping, human, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:413;262;Watch him bring truth and justice to war.
I:413;263;There are some good action sequences in this film, like the one where he's walking through a minefield but there are other parts of the film that are so heavy.
I:413;264;I really wanted to like the movie more than I did.
I:413;265;The two that got on my nerves were: the use of the ever.
I:413;266;Let's make the Muslims the clean.
I:413;267;And let's make the Americans, well, just normal Americans with normal attributes like incontestable honesty, unimaginable bravery, irrefutable nobility, and the rest of it.
I:413;268;Indeed, adding special effects on top of so many clich?s makes the film seem triter, stupider.
I:413;269;when was the last time the US Government made a good movie?
I:413;270;"This film could have been an excellent film, if it would had relied on more ""acting"" and factual realism for the main character."
I:413;271;"Over all it is nothing more than a modern day ""patriotic"" fiction, when it could have been a very realistic portrayal of similar events with real merit."
I:413;272;The fireball is hokey, but overall the sequence is done pretty well.
I:413;273;if you're a war junkie in or around that, then this movie is right for you.
I:413;274;i guess it's all that intense heat it brings, and the bullets, and the guns, and the running, and the pounding.
I:413;275;this movie never gets boring and it has that drama that draws you in.
I:413;276;you feel for this guy going through all this stuff, and you want to help and you just get all into it.
I:413;277;some are very deep, while others are just a bit about it, but they all deliver this satisfying thirst for heroism, bravery, and survival.
I:413;278;terrific storyline, the actors worked very well.
I:413;279;everyone played their part to the tee, and the end results were very good.
I:413;280;owen wilson did a fine job, no doubt.
I:413;281;he's acting was so good he was believable.
I:413;282;the movie was good, the actors were great, and any better i doubt it could have been.
I:413;283;This is a good to very good film.
I:413;284;Visuals are great on Blu.
I:413;285;I really felt the thrill and the terror of being pursued by heat.
I:413;286;Great character development for the protagonist, a young sassy airman who puts in for a discharge in the beginning of the movie.
I:413;287;Gene Hackman's character is complex and realistic as well, caught between the modern political details of war and the simple commitment to keeping his troops safe.
I:413;288;I felt that this movie dealt very well with a lot of the issues and emotions behind the conflict in Kosovo.
I:413;289;Two scenes especially bring home what was at stake during these events.
I:413;290;This is a great modern war movie, and I'd readily recommend it to anyone who's interested in movies about history, the military, or good.
I:413;291;A serious role for Owen Wilson and it's excellent.
I:413;292;Owen was believable, in this serrious presentation.
I:413;293;leave that up to the actors, script writers, agents, director's and producers.
I:413;294;be entertained by it and put it back in your collection!
I:413;295;great oscar caliber performances and a well.
I:413;296;We do enjoy the movie, and while it is not a classic by any means, some people will enjoy it just for the plot, actions scenes, etc.
I:413;297;Fortunately, the end result was positive in every way.
I:413;298;acting self, bringing a degree of believability and solid character to the plot.
I:413;299;Later I found out that he's known for off.
I:413;300;the production of the movie was also above what I'd imagined, with interesting special effects and camera trickery.
I:413;301;What I really enjoyed was what was absent in this film.
I:413;302;Most of the movie was believable with only a few scenes that went over the top (James Bond action style).
I:413;303;That said, if you crave realistic action then Black Hawk Down is a much better movie.
I:413;304;there are a couple unique tactics the director takes with it, such as sudden pause frames and slow.
I:413;305;And the special efforts are of course great.
I:413;306;I enjoyed this movie more than Black Hawk Down.
I:413;307;The only reason you would want to see this film is to make you feel good that the Americans only came into World War 2 at the last minute!
I:413;308;this was a way cool movie.
I:413;309;this is very exciting and action packed.
I:413;310;It is the best war movie I've seen it recent years.
I:413;311;The cast for this movie did a great job.
I:413;312;You should own this movie cause it is so good that your gonna see it more than once.
I:413;313;I just chanced upon this wonderful war.
I:413;314;it was quite a thrill as you watched him running up and down,hanging for his dear life.
I:413;315;After all,he did a pretty good job in a convincing portrayal as Chris Burnett,whose auick.
I:413;316;I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
I:413;317;behind enemy lines is a very,very good movie.
I:413;318;"it doesn
I:413;319;This pattern repeats itself throughout the film.
I:413;320;the story also ignores the general struggle to survive.
I:413;321;It wasnt predictable, it was an edge of your seat thriller.
I:413;322;Behind Enemy Lines had a perfect plot, and a perfect ending.
I:413;323;Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman did an excellent job, as did the other actors and actresses of this film.
I:413;324;They are seen and are shot down, after an incredible fight, and his friend is shot.
I:413;325;It is a perfect hide and seek type movie.
I:413;326;it is action packed and full of excitement.
I:413;327;Behind Enemy Lines was shocking, powerful, and an excellent film.
I:413;328;this is a great action movie, the price was perfect, the shipment arrived safely as well, great job by everyone involved
I:413;329;This is one exciting, roller.
I:413;330;Hackman and Wilson did a great job in acting, and it was good to see Owen in a role other than the lovable goofball.
I:413;331;You will really appreciate our military (again and again) and their professionalism, courage, and teamwork.
I:413;332;The story is loosely based on a real event involving one of our fliers who was rescued in real life.
I:413;333;well, turnaround is fair play.
I:413;334;his character develops, both cinematically as well as personally.
I:413;335;this is a movie that inspires courage.
I:413;336;I consider it to be very watchable.
I:413;337;Great movie with alot of action from start to the finish the cast has very good actors which I enjoy.
I:413;338;The action is intense (although the acting isn't) and this movie provides a good evening's entertainment.
I:413;339;this move was so real and the acting was superb and I have watched it more than once and was still on the edge of my seat!!
I:413;340;Owen Wilson was very believable and he is a very good actor as well.
I:413;341;This was a great movie, very inspirational to anyone in the navy, army and air force or armed forces of any kind and survives an hostility from foreign countries.
I:413;342;I was on the edge of my seat with this movie, lots of action and heroism.
I:413;343;I think that this movie is one of the best I have ever seen.
I:413;344;Owen Wilson did a fantastic job in this movie and although he streamlines with mostly his character he was great in this action movie and held his own.
I:413;345;Makes you proud of the Red, White and Blue and what it represents.
I:413;346;and it's also fun seeing the bad guys get their comeupponce.
I:413;347;This artist is a treasure.
I:413;348;one gets captured and executed immediately.
I:413;349;best of the performances, amazing real time war depictions.
I:413;350;The land scape scenery was really beautiful.
I:413;351;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
I:413;352;I happen to enjoy his mixture of arrogant playboy with being insecure and endearing, and ever.
I:413;353;He mastered this in film successes like Shanghai Knights, Shanghai Noon (both with Jackie Chan), and I Spy (with Eddie Murphy).
I:413;354;protection, this film is one more great Owen Wilson flic, that will not only keep you smirking, but this one will make you feel like your finger is in a wall socket until the end.
I:413;355;The editing was good with lots of modernistic cuts and flashes as the plane takes off.
I:413;356;She did a nice job of looking tired.
I:413;357;I enjoy watching Owen Wilson.
I:413;358;the pilot was captured and executed on the landed spot, while Chris, who had witnessed the gruesome event, managed to escape into the woods.
I:413;359;it was quite fun, actually for a change, to watch Owen Wilson, with his crooked nose, playing a serious and sober character in the movie.
I:413;360;gene Hackman, one of my favourite actors, seemed to have an understated role, but I simply love his character in the movie.
I:413;361;"At the risk of his own career, he eventually took personal command and led the successful rescue attempt (""Let's go and get our boy back!"")"
I:413;362;the final segment of the movie exhibited the spectacular rescue attempt of the downed navigator.
I:413;363;That was his greatest defining moment in the movie, which I certainly enjoyed watching.
I:413;364;"the film starts off very well with a James Bondish beginning and continues so, up until about 15 minutes into the movie
I:413;365;the good things first:1) The cinematography is AMAZING.
I:413;366;The way the camera rolls in and out of the scenes is highly original and highly enjoyable.
I:413;367;More such cinematography would be greatly appreciated.2) The music is really good (!)
I:413;368;, adding to the overall enjoyment.3) It provides for some GREAT scenery with snow.
I:413;369;covered hills and mountains and great shots of cliffs and the sea.4) The special effects are first.
I:413;370;A decent budget and professional work have produced realistic and entertaining special effects.5) Aircraft carriers, fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, personnel carriers, are all there.6) The acting is commendable.
I:413;371;Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman, Vladimir Mashkov and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!
I:413;372;stop and there is a decent story line as well.
I:413;373;i thought it was a great start (mom) and from that point forward.
I:413;374;it was an AWESOME, action.
I:413;375;That said, you can relax and enjoy this film for what it is .
I:413;376;No wonder it has such intense and non.
I:413;377;gene Hackman's performance shines as he is constantly torn between doing what he thinks is right and following orders and adds a very human dimension to the film .
I:413;378;so much so that it actually brought tears to my eyes.
I:413;379;The technical effects are outstanding and I felt the pilot's fear, panic and quick decisions as he dodges a wide variety of explosive devices and bullets.
I:413;380;And the ending, which will leave people thinking this was a true story, is deceptive.
I:413;381;It's hard to imagine this is a true story but it is.
I:413;382;Gene Hackman plays the role of commander as good as you can imagine.
I:413;383;When I want to watch a thrilling show I just pop this movie in and I'm on the edge of my seat all over again.
I:413;384;It's more an action movie that is set in a war zone and has some combat.
I:413;385;There is a cool battle at the end, though a bit unbelievable and a bit over.
I:413;386;I was pleased that the movie combined a bit of political intrigue with generally realistic military action to yield a very enjoyable movie.
I:413;387;During their flight they see something on the ground that causes them to take a closer look.
I:413;388;Using their new digital image recording system they take high.
I:413;389;During the chase there are several incidents that were very creative, though incredible in their coincidence.
I:413;390;top, reminiscent of James Bond.
I:413;391;while the movie contains flaws in how the action is portrayed, for entertainment and patriotism it is a good bet, particularly if you enjoy military action movies.
I:413;392;I absolutely love this movie.
I:413;393;It is very action packed and it's one I could watch over and over again.
I:413;394;"fun"" soundtrack and general attitude."
I:413;395;This is the first time I wished the audience had the freedom to choose the background music in a film!The SAM scene is a first class cinema effect, and the man.
I:413;396;My sentiments was share by my 11 year old nephew .
I:413;397;the movie itself was film quite well with it's use of special effects and scenery with some of the beautiful landscape of the county used for plot line purposes.
I:413;398;i also enjoyed the fact that they did not try to put a romance in a war movie were it did not belongAll in all this was a great movie and will enjoy watching it over and over
I:413;399;I saw this several times, and love watching it!
I:413;400;It has great scenery, great action, great acting, and it's a great story.
I:413;401;All I can say is wow.
I:413;402;the kind that seems to say that war used to be hell, but now it's fun.
I:413;403;Ironically, Wilson is himself an award.
I:413;404;Behind Enemy Lines does succeed in the action department.
I:413;405;The sequence where the jet is shot down is spectacular.
I:413;406;A great deal of attention is paid to details in these scenes.
I:413;407;This is an exceptional movie portraying real.
I:413;408;Not the usual Owen Wilson fare, he was actually quite impressive.
I:413;409;Gene Hackman was incredible as always.
I:413;410;As usual Gene Hackman is perfectly cast in this dark portrayal of the US and international forces monitoring of the Bosnian/Serbian conflict.
I:413;411;"After watching the film again from beginning to end it's become one of my favorite ""war"" type of films, realistic, dark and gritty."
I:413;412;In many films he is cast in comedic roles as in the Jackie Chan films, Zoolander and The Wedding Crashers but this film shows the true depth of his abilities as a serious actor.
I:413;413;This by far is my favorite Owen Wison film.
I:413;414;Lord knows at times like this, we could all use something with a little bit of a positive message about the ole US of A.
I:413;415;As a proud veteran of the U. s. Army, even though I never served in combat, this movie made me feel proud to be an American.
I:413;416;I went to see this movie with my two kids, both young teenagers, and they sure liked this film quite a bit, so much they even wanted to go see it again.
I:413;417;Hopefully Burnett will be able to survive long enough for the red tape to be cut, and the Navy can send in the marines to rescue him.
I:413;418;Behind Enemy Lines can be way over the top, but it really brings back the memories of the good 80's action movies where you left behind your brain and loved to believe that a man in a red head band could single handedly bring down Vietnam, North Korea, or the whole darn continent of Asia if he wanted to.
I:413;419;Ok sure it's nowhere near as good as Rambo, Die Hard, or Terminator, but it is a lot of fun.
I:413;420;Behind Enemy Lines is filled with a lot of cool scenes, and some tense moments.
I:413;421;"while I like the ""Behind Enemy Lines"", it's definitely not the best movie out there, but it is a very fun action movie."
I:413;422;It's close to a 3.5 stars than a 4 star, but hey, I gotta help it out some.
I:413;423;Definitely recommend for the action fans.
I:413;424;Heard it has incredible video and superb audio.
I:413;425;Definitely the best part of the movie to me was the scene where the 2 SAMS were chasing down the F.15.
I:413;426;That was some cool stuff there.
I:413;427;Owen Wilson's performance was OK at best, but the action scences were INTENSE, and the plot twists kept me on the edge of my seat.
I:413;428;While all that was great, the best part of the movie was by far it's audio side.
I:413;429;The sound of explosions, jet engines, and bullets flying was amazing, and the music is more than just the standard heavy metal guitar solo: it actually has good music, music that I would want to listen to more than once.
I:413;430;It's just one of those movies where it's the greatest thing in the world the first time, but makes you want to projectile vomit the second.
I:413;431;I thought this was a good, almost realistic movie right from the start.
I:413;432;There is a final scene with intense action and the movie tends to keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:413;433;It is in my collection as I love the military movies.
I:413;434;a big, rollicking ride that works if you don't look too much deeper than the surface.
I:413;435;Some interesting cinematography (with an obvious influence from _Saving Private Ryan_, esp.
I:413;436;a cool action movie with great set pieces that blow you away literally.
I:413;437;the part where the building explodes and Wilson's hearing goes off is really a neat thing.
I:413;438;The action was pretty good.
I:413;439;time helmer John Moore, who has a REALLY strong eye for visuals, convincingly capturing the chaos of battle, and even showing some ability to direct actors (unusual for a director of commercials).
I:413;440;Director Moore even has the grace to slyly insert a piece of dialogue criticizing Hackman for risking the peace process and thousands of Bosnian lives for the sake of one American flyboy.
I:413;441;In a seriously underwritten part, this actor manages to make the sniper character a convincing human being, which is no mean feat.
I:413;442;Cinematography, stunts, wardrobe, and makeup are all first.
I:413;443;In general, the technical credits are flawless.
I:413;444;"Next time, Hollywood, give John Moore a crack at an excellent script and you might have another ""Training Day"" on your hands."
I:413;445;okay, in two words .
I:413;446;Made me think of how fragile our freedom is.
I:413;447;For those who like suspense, intrigue, great acting this is for you.
I:413;448;I always like a good military movie.
I:413;449;What makes this even better is it is either a true story or based on one.
I:413;450;But to my utter surprise, I enjoyed almost every moment of this thrill ride.
I:413;451;the main reason Behind Enemy Lines works with its story.
I:413;452;line is because it runs two stories at the same time and keeps us enthralled through both of them.
I:413;453;baddies' most exciting scenes and change over to the less adrenaline charged but still interesting Gene Hackman.
I:413;454;This leaves us hanging on the edge of our seats for more action and gives the movie way more intrigue.
I:413;455;the other thing that gives Behind Enemy Lines a kick in the right direction is the stylistic camera.
I:413;456;held camera work is very effective and makes the movie seem more war.
I:413;457;The cinematography is neat in the way it can show endless styles to shoot scenes within the first hour but find plenty more to finish off the movie.
I:413;458;It really shows how cinematography and shooting styles are advancing to new levels these days.
I:413;459;of course, there is nothing more I enjoyed this movie for more than its entertainment value and action sequences.
I:413;460;The action scenes are breathtaking and sometimes a little far.
I:413;461;fetched but they are amazingly stylish and work into the movies plot in many ways.
I:413;462;This action sequence is fabulously original and uses a lot of visual and special techniques to get the overall result of one of the tensest scenes of 2001.
I:413;463;He has just had his plane blown up, fallen through trees, and landed on unknown territory which contains some very dangerous people who were trying to kill him and his fly buddy about 5 minutes ago, and Wilson's character is able to crack smiles and make a joke?
I:413;464;this is one big package with the title ACTION BLOCKBUSTER stamped all over it.
I:413;465;An entertaining little movie, with not bad acting from all involved.
I:413;466;Scenery was great and the action shots exciting.
I:413;467;I loved the camera work.
I:413;468;This innovative style that seems to be infiltrating modern film.
I:413;469;making is fantastic and breaks the monotony of conventional filming angles.
I:413;470;I actually thought it was ok.
I:413;471;I think Owen was a good choice for the movie.
I:413;472;he is good in comedy .
I:413;473;but I think he is a decent actor and would like to see more of him.
I:413;474;Wished I saw it on the big screen.
I:413;475;It is true for ANY movie, as well as for this one.
I:413;476;What is important in ANY movie is: A MESSAGE !
I:413;477;Message of this movie is clear and artistically perfectly made, no matter if some CHETNIKS (and their allies .
I:413;478;"In one sentence: one small story that tells a lot (to those who ""listen"" with their hearts, not only eyes.)"
I:413;479;"Behind Enemy Lines it's with no doubt a good action movie, but you just can't compare it to ""Saving Private Ryan"" or other masterpieces of its genre."
I:413;480;"The director follows Tony Scott's style and has gained quite a successful result
I:413;481;but the action scenes above the average give it some interest.
I:413;482;on the technical side the Dolby Digital and, especially, the DTS track are very good and they really challenge your home theatre thanks to the big explosions provided by the context.
I:413;483;Only one of the two men survives.
I:413;484;as the surviving man struggles to stay alive in his journey through the rugged wilderness to get back to base, he is relentlessly hunted by deadly Bosnian mercenaries . . . a captivating storyline, great character development, and a historical theme makes Behind Enemy Lines a patriotic thriller that everyone should see.
I:413;485;I will say that the sound effects are very cool and even better when in surround.
I:413;486;Owen Wilson's best role I think
I:413;487;The marketing for this film hardly touched on one of the key story elements of a movie like this: the enemy.
I:413;488;Here we have a good chance to make a Hollywood film and touch on the Bosnian war.
I:413;489;With that nose at least he's somewhat believable as a weary soldier.
I:413;490;Would watch it again with the same excitement
I:413;491;Owen Wilson gave a great performance in this, probably one of his best.
I:413;492;Gene Hackman is also great in this.
I:413;493;the rest of the movie is about the game of cat and mouse that ensuesas our hero's pursued by two foes : the forces of the enemy, as wella mercenary employed by them.
I:413;494;there's also some great camerawork and a few good action sequences.
I:413;495;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:413;496;It was good to see Owen Wilson in a serious role.
I:413;497;I must say I'm not usually a fan of war movies but this one was quite entertaining.
I:413;498;I'd have to give this movie extremely high marks in cinematography, action, and casting however it was somewhat lacking in plot.
I:413;499;Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman give a great performance.
I:413;500;This one is better then most.
I:413;501;what makes this film work is the utter determination of it's stars to take it seriously.
I:413;502;He is at least good in everything he does.
I:413;503;While he is only good here, he's still a commanding presence.
I:413;504;the action scenes are also well made.
I:413;505;"The downing of the plane is one of the best made jet action sequences since ""Top Gun""."
I:413;506;It is exciting and tense, and it is a testament to the director's ability.
I:413;507;Wilson's journey through a ruined Bosnia also has some excellent action scenes, such as the attack on the city of Haj, and a harrowing moment in a mine field, in which the director shows some flair.
I:413;508;I won't give away the secrets of the totally absurd final actions scene, but say what you will about realisim, it's fun and exciting.
I:413;509;I had fun watching it.
I:413;510;Suspend your disbelief and enjoy.
I:413;511;This is probably one of the best military action movies I have ever seen.
I:413;512;I especially liked the opening of the movie.
I:413;513;this movie is a must because it reminds us of the carnage that ensues unleashed terror.
I:413;514;We especially enjoy most anything Gene Hackman acts in, and Owen Wilson was great too.
I:413;515;moving war movie that had good continuity all through, from start to finish.
I:413;516;but it's a good stuff.
I:413;517;I also loved the landscape: creepy and desolate and more like a character in the movie than just a background.
I:413;518;"second segment that came directly from the movie ""The Savior"" (great movie)when the main female character is about to be murdered."
I:413;519;The flight scene where the good guys get shot down is the movie's high point.
I:413;520;THE GOOD: Owen Wilson does a fine job as a wise.
I:413;521;I'm a big fan of jet planes, so I get a real kick out of watching the Super Bug turn its tricks.
I:413;522;Once Owen and his pilot find their way onto the ground, the movie combines some somewhat.
I:413;523;stop chase, which is, for the most part pretty entertaining.
I:413;524;If you just close your eyes for about 2 minutes during the end shootout, you'll be fine.
I:413;525;This was a great movie.
I:413;526;I think they had great actors and a good storyline also.
I:413;527;The movie constantly keeps you thinking.
I:413;528;I think they portray very well what the Navy is really like.
I:413;529;gene Hackman plays the role(model) he loves to do best an a promising Owens lives upto expectations but.
I:413;530;The acting is good, the filming is good, the plot is thin.
I:413;531;But anyway, I was pleasantly surprised.
I:413;532;The missile evading scene is pretty intense.
I:413;533;Wilson uses this seat as bait to get the sniper guy out in the open.
I:413;534;Wilson suddenly jumps up out of a snow bank and they fight to the death with shades of a Rambo scene.
I:413;535;Very fun scene with cool visuals and sounds.
I:413;536;this movie uses some very unique camera tricks.
I:413;537;The picture is very clean and sharp with great blacks and shadow definiton.
I:413;538;bit titles, is very well mixed.
I:413;539;this movie is a good showcase for Russian military equipment.
I:413;540;i loved this movie and when it went out in blu.
I:413;541;The shoot down scene is one of the best action sequences on film.
I:413;542;The audio and visual are excellent.
I:413;543;i think the movie is a pretty good action movie.
I:413;544;"In 1998, with ""Saving Private Ryan,"" Steven Spielberg raised the bar for all that would follow in the genre of ""War"" films (just as his colleague, George Lucas, had done some years earlier for Science Fiction with the original ""Star Wars"")."
I:413;545;"One that does succeed, and for a number of reasons, is ""Behind Enemy Lines,"" directed by John Moore, which delivers that expected reality, but offers a lot more along the way, as well."
I:413;546;But Burnett, a seven year veteran, is determined to make it, and to make this mission mean something.
I:413;547;And that means beating the enemy at their own game, and on their turf.
I:413;548;"initially, Moore's film seems destined to become just one more of the brutally realistic and action packed war stories that have evolved since Spielberg's ""Ryan,"" albeit a good one, from all indications early on."
I:413;549;and it takes a turn that kicks it up a notch and takes it beyond anything those other films offered and/or delivered.
I:413;550;And by infusing that decisive human element into the story, it elevates the film to a higher level and achieves the kind of success never realized by either of the aforementioned films, in part because of their failure to effect that very same level of human drama that sets this film apart.
I:413;551;as Burnett, Owen Wilson is very effective, turning in a performance that is quite natural and affecting.
I:413;552;Wilson has something of a quirky appearance and a rather mesmerizing tone and manner of speaking that gives him a charismatic screen presence and makes him extremely accessible and convincing.
I:413;553;"boy"" character, checking his ego and machismo at the door, and it makes Burnett very real and believable."
I:413;554;It also makes the development of his character.
I:413;555;convincing as the story progresses, as well as lending credibility to the overall film.
I:413;556;But to his credit, Hackman does it extremely well, which is the beauty of watching an actor of his caliber perform.
I:413;557;He's the consummate professional, and even when covering familiar ground, he has the ability to make it seem fresh and, most importantly, entertaining.
I:413;558;"Hackman is a gifted actor with a tremendous range
I:413;559;Reigart is merely a character that serves a purpose, and Hackman realizes that intent to the fullest.
I:413;560;A film that offers some insights into politics, as well as the human condition, it manages to be thought provoking while delivering some terrific action, drama and solid entertainment.
I:413;561;"Worthy to be called one of ""Ryan's "" more successful offspring, ""Behind Enemy Lines"" is the watermelon of war films
I:413;562;And that's the magic of the movies.
I:413;563;action thriller and recruitment tool was entertaining stuff.
I:413;564;Always dependable Gene Hackman was excellent as the hard bitten and frustrated Admiral Riegart.
I:413;565;I especially liked the fresh face of Owen Wilson as a recalcitrant Navy officer/mouse locked in a game of survival with a pack of ruthless Balkan cats.
I:413;566;But the point of the exercise was to celebrate and demonstrate America's superior position as the world's greatest military force and rescuer of hapless pilots.
I:413;567;Oh well, war IS hell, but we do love it anyway, don't we?
I:413;568;Sure the basic premise was good and the cause was noble, but the action was inconceivable.
I:413;569;This movie arrived on time and in good condition.
I:413;570;imposed peace agreement, thereby leaving Burnett to fend for himself in the wild, or saying to hell with the treaty and rescuing one of his own men as his gut instincts tell him to do.
I:413;571;when the chase is taking place in a foreign country with very few of the people our hero encounters able to communicate with him much beyond simple phrases and gestures.
I:413;572;the cinematography does a tremendous job capturing the stark beauty of the film's bleak, wintertime setting.
I:413;573;rah tale of American ingenuity and virtue.
I:413;574;Very explicited film, giving the viewer nothing new in the way of the story.
I:413;575;I was on the edge of my seat all the way through especially during the SAM attack on the airplane.
I:413;576;Hackman gives his standard fine performance as the Admiral willing to scrap his career for one of his men, and Wilson does his commendable job fighting against the Bosnia terrorist and running across the dangerous ground.
I:413;577;I've always found this movie to be great since the first time I saw it.
I:413;578;Now I finally own it and it works great.
I:413;579;This was a Great action movie with a lot of edge of your seat suspense.
I:413;580;Very good drama and action movie.
I:413;581;The Aircraft launches were wonderful.
I:413;582;I enjoyed this movie quite a lot.
I:413;583;But if you like war movies (or just action movies, since technically the plot is supposed to be during a time of peace or at least a truce), you will most likely enjoy this movie.
I:413;584;Maintaining our honor and integrity should be of utmost importantance to us as individuals.
I:413;585;This movie in the end reminds us what is most important in life.
I:413;586;the movie is nothing speacial but it's also nothing short of a good time with some good action sequences.
I:413;587;All in all it's a good mindless fun popcorn guzzuling flick.
I:413;588;The track is great and shows off some impressive bass from the missle envaison part.
I:413;589;I love this movie, particularly the sound and special effects and the overall cinematography which made this a natural fit for my blue.
I:413;590;This movie has some memorable moments but the amount of action and fighting in here will keep any fan of war movies happy.
I:413;591;This is a very good movie to give to someone at Christmas time because that is exactly what I did.
I:413;592;Although it may not be the most realistic of movies, it certainly is a wild ride.
I:413;593;Owen Wilson, who produced arguably mixed performances in laughable movies (pun unintended) such as Shanghai Noon and Zoolander, actually does a credible job delivering the pulsating action right to your doorstep.
I:413;594;Hackman, who is superb as Wilson's commanding officer, exposes the true irony of the society that we live in.
I:413;595;Many a time, as we have seen throughout history, mankind will typically do what is best for their own selfish cause, rather than what is necessary to preserve human life and ensure justice.
I:413;596;while the action sequences, populated with spectacular explosions, are both stunning and enjoyable, hard.
I:413;597;But as a viewer with pure entertainment in mind, the intense action and gripping drama make this one movie not to be missed!
I:413;598;Areally good movie, suspensful and gripping, but it doea not have any of my very favorite actors and that for me takes one star out.
I:413;599;Nonetheless, definitely worth seeing .
I:413;600;As these kind of movies go, it's very watchable.
I:413;601;Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson are great in this movie The men play there rolls very well and its a true story
I:413;602;MOst of the story ran quickly and great.
I:413;603;But, beyond that, Behind Enemy Linesis well worth seeing once, twice, and so on.
I:413;604;This was a surprisingly thrilling story about the rescue of an American pilot in the war in Bosnia.
I:413;605;Upon rescue of the pilot, he also manages to rescue the photographs.
I:413;606;Gene Hackman is pretty good in this one, even I have to admit.
I:413;607;Some of the technology shown was amazing.
I:413;608;I hope for our sake that we really have such capability.
I:413;609;The video transfer is really very good and there is a clear sharpness in the details without any noticeable grain.
I:413;610;Miscasting the usually terrific Wilson in the lead only lowers the tone further.
I:413;611;It actually encourages you to interpret the entire film as a post.
I:413;612;John Moore's direction is sufficiently kinetic, as are Brendan Galvin's cinematography and Paul Martin Smith's editing.
I:413;613;This is his movie debut by the way and I hope it's his last.
I:413;614;If you like patriotic action movies, you should enjoy this.
I:413;615;I really like the movie, but the exagerrated nature of many scenes bothered me.
I:413;616;Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson give decent performances.
I:413;617;"Most of the ""extra"" scenes were actually in the movie, but they call it extra because small parts were cut out to get the movie an R rating."
I:413;618;I bought it because it has a great audio missile sequence.
I:413;619;lots of jazzy drumbeat, hyper.
I:413;620;the real height of fantasy is toward the end.
I:413;621;surprise again, Owen wins the fight!)
I:413;622;The overall theme, from Owen's character to that of Hackman's admiral, is a caricature of rugged individualism: I'll do what I please in spite of treaties, agreements, or respect for other people.
I:413;623;courage in the midst of an insane government.
I:413;624;also a big Owen Wilson fan.
I:413;625;one of the funniest actors around.
I:413;626;'Midnight in Paris' showed a serious side, whimsical.
I:413;627;Behind Enemy lines had great sourround sound and :It looks good on the widescreen version.
I:413;628;This is Owen Wilson's best movie if you ask me.
I:413;629;Gene Hackman was a perfect captain and still can act very well at his age.
I:413;630;This movie had wonderful camera angles and great directing.
I:413;631;Wow how blessed we are to have all this new technology so we can make great special effects.
I:413;632;Wow the director even said this movie was origanally going to be rated R because of the graphic violence in the scenes that they deleted.
I:413;633;On the special feautures you can go behind the scenes of the movie and watch tthe Minority Report trailer.
I:413;634;The airplanes in this movie were really sweet and when Owen and his buddy are fixing to crash into a bunch of trees it is just so cool.
I:413;635;Behind Enemy Lines (2001), is one of the few mainstream films set during this period of conflict.
I:413;636;The film does a good job of capturing the cold pure fear of being under fire, and the shock of suddenly being blasted out of the sky, and plunging to the earth, to face a desperate fight for survival.
I:413;637;This is the film's most poignant moment, and while the brutality and suffering of the people is certainly a part of what the film is about, it is soon overshadowed by typical Hollywood style heroics.
I:413;638;The Bosnian army employing an assassin seems a bit much, as is their clever use of the media to misdirect the UN command.
I:413;639;waving overkill, that serves to diminish what could have been an excellent film, with an important message.
I:413;640;despite the hyped up ending, Behind Enemy Lines is definitely worth seeing, for the grim realistic aspects, and an impressive gutty performance by Owen Wilson.
I:413;641;the bonus features include two commentary tracks, one with director John Moore and editor Martin Smith, and a second with co. producers Wyck Godfrey and John Davis.
I:413;642;As the US European Command A.2 (Director of Air Intelligence) during this phase of the disintegration of Yugoslavia, I was surprised to see the ending .
I:413;643;pointing mass graves came from U.2s and satellites (and good coordination with French peacekeepers on the ground).
I:413;644;worthy, but more than adequate.
I:413;645;He was funny and convincing.
I:413;646;i was pleasantly surprised by this films entertainment value.
I:413;647;Yes, it's a bit of a Navy commercial, but it's done well and looks great.
I:413;648;paced and loaded with thrills.
I:413;649;It held my attention throughout.
I:413;650;The special effects were impressive, albeit rather cheesey in their implementation.
I:413;651;But it's spirit and thrills makes up for that type of deus ex machina convention.
I:413;652;I respect all the actors in this film which makes it harder to tell teh truth about this film, No wait.
I:413;653;The ending is just hilarious and manages to spoof itself.
I:413;654;But, it's also one of those movies that you don't really care and you just want to feel good about it.
I:413;655;with great performances by the two leading men, Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson, Behind Enemy Lines is a good movie that keeps you interested throughout and makes you feel like you're a part of it.
I:413;656;john Moore does a fairly nice job as director.
I:413;657;Oh, when I got this video, I'll tell you now: I believed that it was Sunday Afternoon material.
I:413;658;"It really is an epic
I:413;659;It's Christmas: everyone is in a good mood.
I:413;660;He's upset, and ridicules him bigtime.
I:413;661;It's a cat and mouse chase: and to cut a long story short, the young pilot's friend gets shot before his own eyes.
I:413;662;But he gets home safely.
I:413;663;i'll give this video four or even five stars, and as a fictional thing, it really brings home how the military deals with real war situations.
I:413;664;I enjoyed this movie and think it should be part of everyone's collection.
I:413;665;One of my favorite Gene Hackman movies, and the action sequences are very good.
I:413;666;It sheds a good light on the American Navy.
I:413;667;This was a very good movie it keeps you sitting at the edge of your chair.
I:413;668;A must see for everyone
I:413;669;I enjoyed Behind Enemy Lines very much.
I:413;670;The cinematography is fantastic and the acting is amazing.
I:413;671;Even though it is dramatized and emotional, the story is told in a very realistic way.
I:413;672;Thankfully, this film is the right combination between action and plot.
I:413;673;I'm sure it was an emotional endeavor for all involved.
I:413;674;The story of the movie is pretty simple.
I:413;675;What follows next is some of the best action film sequences I have even seen.
I:413;676;One of the guys is an Elvis impersonator while the other young guy in the back is an Ice Cube fan.
I:413;677;As he's sitting in the back of the pickup truck, this young Croat is admiring his 9mm sidearm.
I:413;678;Turns out this guy is big fan of hip.
I:413;679;hop and rap and start rapping.
I:413;680;It's pretty funny, but I guess you just have to see it.
I:413;681;everything eventually ends well and the rescue team does come and get him making this a fun joyful ride.
I:413;682;The special effects are great and you must watch this movie with your volume cranked up.
I:413;683;This is a great movie to show off your receivers and speakers.
I:413;684;Behind Enemy Lines is a good action movie.
I:413;685;comedy kind of roles and Gene Hackman is at his usual best as Owen's commanding officer .
I:413;686;Best to watch the movie to know more.
I:413;687;All in all, an enjoyable experience.
I:413;688;this is someone thats good in comedies, not war (or action) movies.
I:413;689;And Gene Hackman proves once again why he's such a dominant force in film.
I:413;690;It's an awesome action movie that holds your attention throughout, even if the plot seems to be a little dull (which it's really not).
I:413;691;It ranks right up there with Saving Private Ryan and The Patriot as one of the best military/war movies one can view.
I:413;692;"Wilson is great
I:413;693;Grant it, I don't think they'll turn out to be the Ben Affleck/Matt Damon of the 00's, but they do work wonders together.
I:413;694;face of Saving Private Ryan or even The Thin Red Line , it's still a good action thriller you souldn't miss.
I:413;695;Behind Enemy's Line is one of the greatest patriotic movies.
I:413;696;Unlike many other war movies which has a lot of shooting, and not much else, this one has great character development, awesome scenes, and a hilarious stunt the aircraft crew pulled off using a football.
I:413;697;slow motion shots are simply incredible, and the pictures are rich with numerous imageries, some containing messages for the audience, others complimenting the plot.
I:413;698;I liked the last action scene, when the lead character was finally rescued.
I:413;699;another being that much of the movie was shot beautifully.
