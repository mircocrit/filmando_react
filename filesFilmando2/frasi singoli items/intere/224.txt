I:72;1;sold it to a pawn shop for $2 and felt like I had made a good profit.
I:72;2;This was a cool little flick!
I:72;3;"The usual ""I want my share!"""
I:72;4;the actors were good and well cast.
I:72;5;All I have to say to that is.
I:72;6;It featured a creepy little boy a la The Grudge, a creepy little girl and a well a la The Ring, and a scarecrow a la Jeepers Creepers.
I:72;7;gripping music and moments about which you know beforehand what's going to happen.
I:72;8;If you hear horror fans talking about this film, there is a good reason for it, this movie was one of the best independent horror films i've ever watched.
I:72;9;a group of villians rob gold from a bank in the old west, the robbery does have a pretty good bloodbath.
I:72;10;The film has quick jolts every now and again, all last a mere few seconds but effective.
I:72;11;It's paced really well, not too long, and the ending is good.
I:72;12;It seems like such a great time period and setting for scary movies.
I:72;13;out best horror flicks I've ever seen.
I:72;14;The film is well acted, beautifully shot and edited.
I:72;15;It is filled many genuine scares and some seriously creepy visuals.
I:72;16;Its nice to see that some filmmakers in the US are finally starting to do this.
I:72;17;Its also refreshing to actually have to think about a movie sometimes.
I:72;18;Thats quite an accomplishment for a lower cost film.
I:72;19;There are actors here you will recognize, the small amount of CGI is great.
I:72;20;basically everything is so well done that you would think this was a $30 million dollar Hollywood production.
I:72;21;all in all, 'Dead Birds' is about the best horror film I've seen in years and definitely one of the best films of this year.
I:72;22;Its scary, intelligent, well conceived, and beautifully executed.
I:72;23;All I can do is thank the filmmakers for such a great movie and urge everyone else to see it.
I:72;24;know about the film: the filmmaker's got to use some of the set.
I:72;25;town and bank sets)from the just.
I:72;26;I'm sure this is another way that a film with such a low budget has such good production values.
I:72;27;Exaggerated, but great fun for horror lovers.
I:72;28;when the cowboys who robbed the bank ended up in a gigantic creepy house surrounded by a field in the middle of nowhere on some farmland in Alabama with no entrance to the house in sight, and the distant sounds of a thunderstorm started rolling in with a gloomy picture as the cowboys got closer to the home, I KNEW this was going to be a good movie.
I:72;29;This is something those old Silent Hill video games did so extremely well.
I:72;30;It was incredibly important for these cowboys to keep a close eye on the gold.
I:72;31;up to appreciate the actual suspense, and the movie delivers here.
I:72;32;A band of confederate soldiers, led by Henry Thomas, rob a bank, killing everyone inside and out, and head for a plantation.
I:72;33;DEAD BIRDS has an exquisite atmosphere of building dread, that starts right at the beginning.
I:72;34;Good performances all the way around help this solid scipt succeed.
I:72;35;the ending is pretty cool too.
I:72;36;Not the best movie, but certainly worth a look for fans of the genre.
I:72;37;"has some pretty good gore and fairly descent acting for a ""B"" movie."
I:72;38;A band of Civil War.
I:72;39;The creature designs can best be described as amorphous humanoid blobs with black voids for eyes and razor sharp teeth and claws.
I:72;40;Though the film isn't FX heavy, the scenes where we do encounter these terrors are frightening and intriguing at the same time.
I:72;41;This is a solid Indie effort with high production values and a great cast, well worth seeking out for anyone that hasn't seen it yet!
I:72;42;A band of southerners robs a bank and high.
I:72;43;Grow soybeans instead, that's what they'll tell you.
I:72;44;This does happen a little bit as a matter of narrative necessity, but it goes down towards the end of the film and with fairly good reason.
I:72;45;"even after I'd thought about it enough to declare that I ""got it."""
I:72;46;But overall I really liked this thing.
I:72;47;It was genuinely suspenseful for all of its reliance on cliche, and the atmosphere was damn near perfect.
I:72;48;The characters relate in a believable fashion, both to each other and to the encroaching threat, and the special effects were surprisingly good and sparingly used.
I:72;49;but this one is worthy of a watch.
I:72;50;When I bought this movie, I at least hoped for good actors.
I:72;51;Good actors will make any movie, however bad, worthwhile.
I:72;52;When neither of those hopes came true, I laid my last hope on a good story line with scary monsters.
I:72;53;From reading the premise of the film it sounds very good, and for the most part the film does deliver.
I:72;54;The ending feels a bit rushed at times, as some characters kind of just disappear (literally), but I still found it to be pretty good.
I:72;55;Anyway, good price, good movie.
I:72;56;It is a captivating and chilling story of a group of bank robbers who flee to a local and abandoned farm to spend the night during a horrific storm that is brewing.
I:72;57;"although not perfect, since it follows tried and true ""nobody would go in there"" horror film formulas, it delivers wholeheartedly on the spookiness scale."
I:72;58;pop it in, kill the lights and enjoy.
I:72;59;This one rips your spine out of your back,dangles it in front of you and then tickles it while you watch!
I:72;60;truely original and very spoooooky!
I:72;61;Nevertheless, the group continues to the old farm and spend lots of time wandering around the interior (neat old house!)
I:72;62;There is also the subplot of the original owner who turned his children into little sneaky things with sharp teeth via cutting up his slaves.
I:72;63;In spite of the feelings of unrest and the fact that characters regularly walk out of the house and disappear, the group continues to stay.
I:72;64;overall, especially for it being low budget, it was a very good film.
I:72;65;You would do well to start right here with Dead Birds, as director Alex Turner has given us one gem of a horror movie.
I:72;66;well, several bangs, really .
I:72;67;good outlaws rob an Alabama bank in 1863.
I:72;68;it starts out with the usual kind of stuff (e. g., giggles, voices, creaks, etc.) but the cinematography makes it work like gangbusters.
I:72;69;ish, yet it is very effective.
I:72;70;The threat here is external and very, very real.
I:72;71;A good scare can be exhilarating, but it's over and done with in a hurry.
I:72;72;That is exactly why I love this movie.
I:72;73;I enjoyed this flick, great suspence, scares and effects.
I:72;74;As horror movies go, this is the real deal.
I:72;75;Yes, it's far from perfect.
I:72;76;But with horror movies all that matters is.
I:72;77;does it deliver with the scares, and yes it does indeed.
I:72;78;Hats off to first time director Alex Turner on a job well done.
I:72;79;basically, it's still a haunted house movie, but the period setting and use of that era's trappings add an extra dimension.
I:72;80;It has a good number of jump moments, some grisly, fun FX and a good cast.
I:72;81;better than a lot out there.
I:72;82;pretty good actors, good sets, very good effects and make.
I:72;83;up (I've seen a lot of horror movies, and this is one of the scariest.
I:72;84;looking monsters I've seen yet), very effective score and use of sound.
I:72;85;Dead Birds is genuinely creepy and scary.
I:72;86;The setting is suitably isolated by geography and weather, and the Civil War setting adds a nice twist which does actually add to the atmosphere.
I:72;87;still, overall, a solid 3 or 3.5 stars.
I:72;88;It has a great cast, a interesting plot and some really spooky demon.
I:72;89;And the wonderful setting in an old Alabama plantation.
I:72;90;AND the absolutely horrific creatures!
I:72;91;I think this is one of the most truly original horror movies I've ever seen, directed by first.
I:72;92;time feature film director Alex Turner and written by Simon Barrett with the unique setting of the Civil War South.
I:72;93;"The cast is great, led by Henry Thomas (""All the Pretty Horses"", ""ET""), Patrick Fugit (""Almost Famous""), Isaiah Washington (""Ghost Ship"") and Nicki Aycox (""Jeepers Creepers II"") and the production design by Leslie Keel (""May"") is wonderful although I believe that, like the remake of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", most of the movie was filmed in the actual plantation."
I:72;94;Which makes the atmosphere all the more realistic.
I:72;95;"The cinematography is amazing as well, done by Steve Yedlin (""May"", ""Toolbox Murders"" [2005]) in a sort of sepia tone that brings the era to life."
I:72;96;The plot is fairly simple .
I:72;97;"It's nice to see that it's still possible to write an original horror movie, instead of remaking one or ""borrowing"" nearly whole."
I:72;98;the best part, however, is that the creepy atmosphere was masterfully done, and didn't waver during any part of the movie.
I:72;99;i enjoyed its plot and story.
I:72;100;i also thought the acting was pretty good.
I:72;101;I am in agreement that this movie was a pleasant surprise.
I:72;102;It's obviously not the greatest horror movie, but it has a lot of elements of a very good horror movie.
I:72;103;It is certainly better than most direct to video movies, and may have done well if released in theaters.
I:72;104;The overall mood of the film is one that more films in this genre would do well to emulate.
I:72;105;the ghosts are quite scary and yet just a bit too slick to fit in with the Civil War era setting.
I:72;106;but that's because this film is leaps and bounds superior than most films of its genre.
I:72;107;This tape was in excellent condition and an excellent movie.
I:72;108;i'm glad recently independent horror movies have tendency to shows a strong performance, when the bib.
I:72;109;Afterwards, in the end, it return in the good sense.
I:72;110;to sum it up, Dead Birds is still delivers some good scare, and despite the flaw is worth watching.
I:72;111;"If one can get past the poor portrayal of Confederate soldiers and the ""Old South"" during The Civil War, ""Dead Birds"" is actually a pretty chilling and entertaining little modern day horror movie."
I:72;112;Dead Birds does a pretty good job with the haunted house and witchcraft themes by delivering a rich and darkly atmospheric horror movie complete with tension and suspense throughout most of the movie.
I:72;113;"The creators of ""Dead Birds"" were certainly on the right track with this movie as they did a great job of establishing the house and setting in general as a place of supernatural evil."
I:72;114;This effective use of setting works to effectuate the ever.
I:72;115;present creepy atmosphere which makes for a stylish old.
I:72;116;some scary visuals and imagery are utilized to help create horror, but the effectiveness of these visuals was made possible by the establishment of atmospheric tension.
I:72;117;The acting is average for this type of flick and the direction is pretty good.
I:72;118;"With that being said, ""Dead Birds"" can effectively deliver the horror movie goods."
I:72;119;"while certainly no where near the level of a classic horror movie, ""Dead Birds"" is a pretty good and rare stylistic modern day horror movie that is able to utilize setting, atmosphere and tension to deliver an eerie horror movie viewing experience."
I:72;120;I mildly recommend this movie to horror movie lovers, especially late on a rainy night.
I:72;121;Easily one of the better horror releases from last year!
I:72;122;The visuals were creepy, the story line eerie and a real breath of fresh air.
I:72;123;great job to the writer and director.
I:72;124;hope to see more from them!
I:72;125;I love a good horror .
I:72;126;And I'll take a good horror and rewatch it and rewatch it, revelling in the excitement, fear and gore until the cows come home.
I:72;127;(if anyone can explain this movie to me, please please feel free to).1.
I:72;128;This helped set an eerie tone for the rest of it.
I:72;129;Had to pause and step forward to get a good look at them.
I:72;130;A rare thing in these kinds of films.
I:72;131;I wanted to like this movie, I really did.
I:72;132;On top of that the production design was good, the monsters were pretty eerie and the actors did a good job.
I:72;133;also, the music (while very good) never seemed to fit what was happening on the screen.
I:72;134;i was going to rate this one two stars, but really it deserves (a little) better than that.
I:72;135;Really wish this film got more attention than it has.
I:72;136;At least for me it captured a consistent, chilling sense of impending horror .
I:72;137;Its like the director thought a certain effect would look cool and just did it, no matter what the story was.
I:72;138;Although the acting is actually quite good for something that wasnt made by a big studio.
I:72;139;Its actually a period piece, set back in the days of horses and saloons.
I:72;140;An interesting dynamic began to happen in my brain.
I:72;141;You actually see one in the cornfield at the begining.
I:72;142;###Youre left without much of a sense of closure, but it sets up an interesting twist that people can debate on message boards for a good long time.
I:72;143;###Basically this is just a have fun movie.
I:72;144;On that score alone, DEAD BIRDS more than succeeds.
I:72;145;The story is never completely clear (there's a twist at the end that is only fully explained in the director's commentary extra), but the director, Alex Turner, does a marvelous job evoking atmosphere: he is helped out immensely by the film's gorgeously eerie cinematography (by Steve Yedlin) and its disturbing and intelligent score (by Peter Lopez).
I:72;146;It has a wonderfully creepy basement, and the high empty upper.
I:72;147;An interesting story with decent acting and quite a few jumps made this one very enjoyable.
I:72;148;It had very effective visuals that make for a very creepy viewing experience.
I:72;149;The movie started out interesting and I have to admit I did enjoy watching it through.
I:72;150;The movie stops in a couple parts to tell you how they knew of this plantation and who it belonged to, but I never found that story to be fully developed.
I:72;151;"The gentleman who also starred in ""Almost Famous"" (I'm too lazy to look up his name right now) I felt especially did a fine job."
I:72;152;at how good this film was.
I:72;153;A scary movie that was actually pretty scary.
I:72;154;The civil war made a great backdrop for this movie.
I:72;155;"You get the genuine feeling of ""everyday people"" from them."
I:72;156;Wonder if he got Deja Vu.
I:72;157;"Okay, to sum up, there's some half decent production value to this, acting isn't too bad, music is perfect for the film and the overall ""evil stuff"" is good and freaky."
I:72;158;This movie has a great story.
I:72;159;Infact that whole part of the story has a very Lovecraftian feel to it which I really liked.
I:72;160;This is a movie with genuine suspense and some great effects/gore.
I:72;161;It has a great combination of suspense and gore.
I:72;162;The cast is very good even though in my humble oppinion the female lead was the weakest.
I:72;163;Two huge thumbs up in my book.
I:72;164;robbery intro, the first 60.
I:72;165;centric, I was easily able to locate a handful of components that tickled my terror bone.
I:72;166;Impressively enough, Turner was able to wrangle himself some fine actors for his little ghost story, including Henry Thomas, Patrick Fugit and Isaiah Washington.
I:72;167;Actors with actual talent help to elevate familiar material, and such is certainly the case here.
I:72;168;turner's directorial style captures the sweaty doom and late.
I:72;169;west setting seems to exist for no reason other than to let the actors talk with a twang and wear funny hats, so one wonders why Turner and company even bothered using this time frame.
I:72;170;Dead Birds is directed with a lot more flair than it's written with, and Alex Turner could very well be an up.
I:72;171;Okay, it's not The Wicker Man but this is still a pretty darn good flick.
I:72;172;I love that it takes place in the old west.
I:72;173;It's also well shot ( it looks more expensive than it probably is ) and well acted with sympathetic charaters, even if they are outlaws.
I:72;174;For me the pacing just added to the nail.
I:72;175;a great story, decent acting and very nice effects to make you jump out of your seat.
I:72;176;I love this film, and i got it cause i didnt know what to get as a movie.
I:72;177;I was truly surprised how well done this movie is for being a low budget film.
I:72;178;than this film is for you and its worth the money for sure.
I:72;179;But the house proves to be much more of a threat and as the characters are isolated from each other they start seeing and hearing things.
I:72;180;this movie, shot by Steve Yedlin, looks pretty good.
I:72;181;"The cast is pretty good for this type of film, with Patrick Fugit from ""Almost Famous,"" Nicki Aycox from ""Jeepers Creepers 2,"" Michael Shannon from ""The Woodsman,"" Mark Boone Junior from ""Memento,"" Muse Watson from ""I (Still) Know What You Did Last Summer,"" and the best of the bunch, Isaiah Washington from ""Ghost Ship,"" to go along with Thomas, who made some movie when he was a kid."
I:72;182;The bottom line is that this horror film is okay and has some interesting ideas running around in it, so that it is not painfully predictable.
I:72;183;This ups the ante for a 5.
I:72;184;the acting is good, adding a woman and a free black man gives a twist.
I:72;185;Excellent to watch it unfold.
I:72;186;and WOW!Slowly, the viewer comes to the recognition that something else is happening besides the place being haunted and even why, and that 'something' rocks the movie on the creepiness scale.
I:72;187;It is one to watch over and over, because it's a smart one.
I:72;188;If you like scary this is for you!!!
I:72;189;It was a good plot and the actors and the Alabama plantation make this movie a real must for horror film buffs!!!!!!
I:72;190;Hope to see young actors like Steven Green again what a find he is a natural and I thought the scariest one in the film.
I:72;191;"This is a good little horror, quite creepy and shocking, with an atmosphere of deep mystery and growing terror and despair for the ""heroes""."
I:72;192;this is a well thought, well made and well interpreted little horror film, which uses all the possibilities offered by the place of action.
I:72;193;The tension builds up slowly but regularly.
I:72;194;Actors were all unknown to me, but they played well .
I:72;195;"stephen King fans will certainly appreciate the important role played by the creepy field of corn surrounding the great main residence, although just to be clear, this film is in no way related to the already legendary ""Children of the corn"" short story or its numerous (rather pathetic) adaptations on screen."
I:72;196;the ending is particularly strong and I didn't see it coming at all.
I:72;197;so bottom line this is a pretty good, original and really CREEPY little horror, warmly recommended to all amateurs of this kind of things.
I:72;198;A platoon of Confederate soldiers have just delivered a huge amount of gold at a local bank, when a group of bandits ride into town, massacre the soldiers, bank teller and director (some good gore on display here)and make their escape on horseback.
I:72;199;i won`t go into any more detail plotwise, but let me assure you that DEAD BIRDS is a very enjoyable and entertaining horror film that will have you on the edge of your seat.
I:72;200;The film is thick with creepy athmosphere, added by a good use of the location and excellent photography.
I:72;201;The period setting works very well, and it is nice for once to not have the usual stupid teenagers, who much to my annoyance populate the vast majority of US horror films.
I:72;202;All actors are convincing in their roles.
I:72;203;particular mention must be made of the creatures, which really look cool.
I:72;204;The film is presented in its correct aspect ratio and looks good.
I:72;205;Accompanying the movie are several interesting extra features:There is a good making.
I:72;206;This movie is more of a psychological thriller with special effects weaved through out the movie.
I:72;207;I really liked the movie after it got started.
I:72;208;This movie is a movie to make you think about what is going on.
I:72;209;I do recommend this movie for anyone that wants a complex horror flick!!!
I:72;210;With all the hoopla made over the effectiveness of this straight.
I:72;211;But rest assured, DEAD BIRDS is in fine feather indeed.
I:72;212;overnight western is atmospheric cinema at its best.
I:72;213;First time director Alex Turner impressively succeeds in establishing this without losing any of the movie's rhythm, which deservedly spins out of control into the last half.
I:72;214;All the actors, including E. t.'s Henry Thomas are a joy to watch, as are the visual effects.
I:72;215;The people behind Almost Human Inc. really went all the way to make original scary creatures, and the end.
I:72;216;serious piece of period horror that did a great job of scaring me stiff.
I:72;217;"paced horror film might be disappointed
I:72;218;This film also looks great, I loved the horse.
I:72;219;For one, I found the group of characters a little hard to sympathize with.
I:72;220;But despite these minor qualms Dead Birds stands as a stylish, well.
I:72;221;If you want to see a good atempt and maybee see what you can do and try it your self.
I:72;222;DEAD BIRDS is one of those atmopsherically creepy indies that works due to its spooky undertones and an original plotline.
I:72;223;Director Alex Turner keeps the mood eerie and suspenseful, although there is a lot of wandering around with lanterns that tends to get tedious.
I:72;224;But the movie's shock moments are potent and DEAD BIRDS manages to be a breath of fresh air in the straight to video market.
I:72;225;Where did one of the best horror films of 2004 come from?
I:72;226;production status veer you away from this film.
I:72;227;And that's when the real fun begins.
I:72;228;personal hauntings, spirit possessions, attacks by surreal.
I:72;229;And although the closing act ushers the viewer back to the safe, quiet daylight, the film delivers a subtle but eerie finale that makes even gooseflesh crawl.
I:72;230;rate actors who expertly handle the spooky material.
I:72;231;probably best known for his role as Elliott, the best earthly friend of E. t.
I:72;232;she appeared in 2003's JEEPERS CREEPERS II, as well as in genre.
I:72;233;Rounding out the primary cast are young, talented actors Michael Shannon and Patrick Fugit, and the versatile and multitalented veteran actor Isaiah Washington.
I:72;234;house clich s with great flair and reworks them into something that seems new and exciting.
I:72;235;core genre fans that his subtle terror tactics and eerie special FX hearken more to contemporary Japanese horror than to American or British genre tradition, which serves to heighten the horror and the sense of the unexpected, at least for Western audiences.
I:72;236;brilliant camera work and superb sound design also contribute to making this a truly frightening flick.
I:72;237;And the filmmakers see to it that the audience experiences every eerie aspect of the place.
I:72;238;tristar is a gem that should help to bring DEAD BIRDS its deserved following.
I:72;239;The digital transfer is crisp and rich, offering the film in anamorphic widescreen at the intended aspect ratio of 1.85:1.
I:72;240;Also offered is an entertaining and informative feature commentary with the director and cast, as well as a making.
I:72;241;dEAD BIRDS is a must.
I:72;242;I like horror movies and the cover got my attention, so I checked the reviews here on Amazon to see what had been said about it.
I:72;243;So many reviews said it was the best horror movie in ages, so I couldn't wait for it to be released here.
I:72;244;well, I've watched it, and I don't know what the reviews here are on about?
I:72;245;well, thats just me I thought.
I:72;246;The cast does what it does as well to try to hold this as far as it goes.
I:72;247;true methods of scaring audiences.
I:72;248;the acting and production, for the most part, is pretty good.
I:72;249;"Nothing in the movie itself is as pretty as the opening titles, but as far as cinematography, effective lighting, CGI, and editing goes, ""Dead Birds"" is on the upper crust of the DTV production scale."
I:72;250;, but whether anyone will want to see the movie more than once is a fifty.
I:72;251;Dead Birds is a movie I would have really liked to enjoy much more.
I:72;252;It has all the elements that should make a great horror flick: Creepy atmosphere and location, a huge abandoned house, good acting and make.
I:72;253;up effects (especially considering what the budget seems to have been), and good sound.
I:72;254;It takes a while to get going, but once it does, it keeps the level of discomfort quite high.
I:72;255;It is actually one of the creepiest movies I've seen in a long time.
I:72;256;Great sound and setting, and an a fun plot.
I:72;257;The acting was decent and the special effects fairly convincing.
I:72;258;It reminded me of Dog Soldiers, a movie that got hardly any publicity yet turned out to be one of the best horror movies of 2002.
I:72;259;The story is very original and I recommend it.
I:72;260;'Dead Birds' is an interesting and unpredictable horror movie.
I:72;261;it's well acted by a cast of (to me!)
I:72;262;unknowns, has scary effects and drips with American Civil War sweaty intensity.
I:72;263;one with something resembling honest affection and respect for the genre.
I:72;264;He handles the action well, keeps the frenzy and hysteria in check and isn't frightened of clich or homage.
I:72;265;"It works for him
I:72;266;'Dead Birds' is a good, strong beast, fattened by the spirits of Peckinpah and early Carpenter, brought to the table in perfect health, and then had it's throat slashed before your very eyes.
I:72;267;definitely something to crow about.
I:72;268;length debut with DeadBirds, a surprisingly slick Civil War thriller with an even more surprisingly good cast.
I:72;269;Turner, despite having only filmed two shorts previous to this, managed to land some excellent underrated and up.
I:72;270;coming actors for his ghost story, and much of the movie's strength lies in Turner's ability to let the actors do the talking for him.
I:72;271;a solid film, well worth seeing if you're a fan of haunted house tales.
I:72;272;i think the success of the modern school of Japanese horror comes from the fact that the films are genuinely spooky and create real fear.
I:72;273;They are, however, quite good.
I:72;274;dead Birds is quite possibly one of the best Direct.
I:72;275;That is some pretty high praise!There are some scenes that could have used more cohesive editing, but overall this movie is great.
I:72;276;The cast, especially Henry Thomas and Isaiah Washington, are way above average for this type of movie.
I:72;277;Even the ending is excellent.
I:72;278;A worthwhile addition to any Horror collection.
I:72;279;With all the mediocre horror movies coming out utilizing tired and overused plots and schemes, 'Dead Birds' was a refreshing breath of blood.
I:72;280;the costumes, props, and sets were superb, capturing the civil war period with chilling meticulousness.
I:72;281;The special effects, while not spectacular, were very effective and used in the best possible lighting.
I:72;282;dead Birds has a strong script, great acting, and a director (Alex Turner) who cared enough about his work to bring this B movie up to an A rating.
I:72;283;The whole movie plays itself out like an old redition off an old western classic, I mean everything is excellent, even the dialogue is great, lengendary, I mean I assumed this was some old western story, but seeing it was a modern day script I'm impressed.
I:72;284;Nicki was okay, there were a couple of scenes where she seemed like she was overplaying the part just a bit, otherwise she was excellent as well.
I:72;285;Sure all the actors look good in make.
I:72;286;Great mood and setting, reminded me a little of Three Kings for some reason .
I:72;287;I'm a huge fan of the horror genre, and nothing scares me.
I:72;288;Good luck staying awake through this one, and if you do manage to see any action in this, it is very generic, as well as the acting.
I:72;289;paced, but it pays off in the end, and the pacing adds to overall creepy ambience.
I:72;290;Give it a watch, but watch in good company or you'll be checking your closets afterward.
I:72;291;The woman in this scene gives a truly terrifying performance (her fear was very convincing).
I:72;292;Really great movie, surprise ending and lots of suspense.
I:72;293;Always nice to have creepy kids and great ol' Louisianan style homes!
I:72;294;This horror movie will catch you by surprise though with a non.
I:72;295;dramatic title such as this one.
I:72;296;I believe that in this era, when two people found love, it was an especially strong bond.
I:72;297;The man must make human sacrifices as a part of the ritual and starts with his servants then continues on with his children.
I:72;298;They seem to be nice enough.
I:72;299;Now the evil beings have the gold in their possession and they do a good job in using that to lure their next houseguests.
I:72;300;I think it's a great horror movie from beginning to end.
I:72;301;This is a neat, little film, really, well.
I:72;302;Each of the members begins to encounter vengeful spectral spirits in the house as one by one they are led to their dooms.
I:72;303;Another example is that William accidently shoots a child while robbing the gold and tells his Annabelle in a moment of remorse.
I:72;304;a good film with some well.
I:72;305;done chills and nice atmostphere.
I:72;306;After all that is said and done, you have to watch out for the weird things happening outside, inside, upstairs and down, and you have to stay alive.
I:72;307;Something happened, however, and the movie got, well, good.
I:72;308;And, well, I was that impressed by the movie.
I:72;309;Through some nice twists we saw what happened in that house (and I have to say I'm glad I never lived, subletted, or even walked in the place), and other twists kept things going.You have to love greed .
I:72;310;you will like it and it will surprise you, bringing a nice touch of horror into your life.
I:72;311;Good acting, good efx, good scenery, bad screenplay/script writing.
I:72;312;I bought it so I could share the movie with my family.
I:72;313;I think it was one of the best and was very under rated.
I:72;314;very nice scene that slowly create the ambiant, then we hear children and demon kind voice.
I:72;315;i instantly loved it from the start to the finish
I:72;316;The unfolding plot is chillingly rendered and the use of flashbacks to fill in the backstory is effective.
I:72;317;The acting is uniformly top.
I:72;318;"For city kids the cornfield looks ""cool""."
I:72;319;This works to a point.
I:72;320;The light nimbus should move with the actors and the darkness close in behind them.
I:72;321;Real oil lamps glow warmly (and photograph the same)and their light flickers and wavers with movement (the nature of the burning wick and stirring air).
I:72;322;"painted ""smoking"" on the corners, a bulb on the inside, and a battery system in the lantern base."
I:72;323;well if any of the pictures on the back of the movie case scare you then by all means watch it.
I:72;324;The circular ending was very well done.
I:72;325;I actually applauded at the end.
I:72;326;I would highly recommend this movie.
