1;don Cheadle, who I admired in the days of PICKET FENCES, gave a powerful performance in the true story of Paul Rusesabagina's struggle and his heroism.
2;This film won all kinds of awards, and I can see why.
3;It's a powerful story told well, with real people living through a seemingly unreal situation.
4;i find this tidbit interesting, and it pleases me greatly.
5;And you know I love Denzel.
6;Excellent writing, supremely talented cast, superb direction.
7;It's an instant classic, folks.
8;I know I'll watch it a few more times, and if my version had English subtitles I'd be tempted to take it into a classroom.
9;Still find it interesting and enjoyable everytime I watch it.
10;I thought this movie was very moving and a good history lesson.
11;A very well made movie !
12;Hearing good reviews, I watched this movie and was definitely changed because of it.
13;Great acting by the entire cast, especially Don Cheadle, who continues to show off unbelievable range as an actor.
14;Remind you of things that are happening half way around the world.
15;It had a huge effect on the students and they thoroughly enjoyed the film.
16;I love this film, great message and makes you want to make sure your stand up for what you believe in on an international scale!
17;But this film is both painful and inspiring, powerful on many levels.
18;the film stands on its own as an amazing work of art, with an excellent cast.
19;Oscar nominated Don Cheadle in possibly his first starring role is extraordinary.
20;The film works at personalizing the story in a way that Saving Private Ryan did not, and this is in a large part due to Don Cheadle.
21;Hopefully this realization will make more of the world stand up and force their own governments to take appropriate actions to help with similar events around the world.
22;"The Kite Runner may be the best book I have read in recent history, and without a doubt, ""Hotel Rwanda"" wins the corresponding prize for movies."
23;Being only human, and in a crisis situation, he makes crucial errors in judgment, but by his conviction he manages to hold it all together for as long as necessary.
24;there are too many powerful scenes to describe, and you have to watch the movie to fully appreciate the horror.
25;This one is a must see.
26;I highly recommend you watch.
27;Has a few tense moments but it was an eye opening selection.
28;Good drama, great performances and story.
29;Will give you a very good entertainment.
30;Some of the few worthy movies you will find for free in Amazon prime
31;The story line was very touching.
32;This movie is one that is hard to watch because of the subject matter (genocide) but it is an excellent movie nevertheless.
33;The actors did a fantastic job and really helped to shed light on a topic not everyone knows much about.
34;The main character, Paul Rusesabagina, played by Don Cheadle, is such a powerful character and really helps to connect the audience to the movie.
35;I openly wept during certain parts because my heart broke for him and the people of Rwanda.
36;This movie is one of the most powerful of it's type.
37;While each is very good, Hotel Rwanda is the best.
38;It's simple story about a simple man saving hundreds of people, and the personal growth he experienced, reaches out across the Atlantic to touch all of us who watch it.
39;It has opened their eyes to what the rest of the world experiences and shows them more about what they've only heard bits and pieces of.
40;Future generations will need men and women of selfless courage.2.
41;He and his family lived through this time.
42;This film helped me understand their lives better.
43;it is a pretty small country.
44;Marvelous story of heroic and love of one standing for the people around.
45;Movie is successful in portraying the cruelness of war, fighting and killings.
46;really heart wrenching to see how a man could be so beastly to kill women, children and innocents.
47;i'll recommend all my friends and family to watch this at least once.
48;this is indeed real piece of art.
49;This is such a marvelous movie.
50;Don Cheadle is a fine actor but his performance alone can't save this film.
51;My family was on the edge of their seats throughout the film.
52;"played by Don Chedle and the UN Peacekeeper
I:11409;53;But it's true and the world turned a blind eye.
I:11409;54;in an attempt to fill the vacuum, """"Hotel Rwanda"""" is a truly great work of art."""
55;Hotel Rwanda is a must see film for 2005 and it deserves its three Oscar nominations.
56;don Cheadle as the hero, Paul Rusesabagina, is a revelation.
57;Rusesabagina is a 21st century hero in much the same way as Oskar Schindler was in the 20th century.
58;Cheadle plays a great part and I can only hope that others see the depth of his character.
59;to all readers, see this film!
60;It is a story that is unknown to the bulk of humanity.
61;It is a story that is told with grace and impact.
62;It is such a powerfull, moving, emotional movie.
63;I beleive this is based on a true story, which makes the movie even more impacting.
64;Don Cheedle has the best performance I've ever seen by him, he is an underated actor.
65;His acting is definately award winning material.
66;Excellent movie and it stayed close to what really happened in real life.
67;A must see movie for everyone to watch.
68;the triumph of the film is that the actors .
69;Credit director George for recognizing this truth and latching on to a great way to relate the true extent of this tragedy.
70;Think of it as an inside.
71;The result of viewing the two films is to give you a compelling 360.
72;This movie is intense, but NOT in a slasher/horror movie way that devalues the subject matter.
73;Illustrates the sad world we live in but still leave a sense of hope and how ordinary people can be heroic.
74;Hotel Rwanda is one of the most moving and disturbing films I have ever seen.
75;There are no scenes of graphic violence here nevertheless the movie shocks and makes you hold your breath.
76;soaked Africa revenge always looms.
77;The main character is a Canadian journalist who's in love with a Tutsi girl.
78;In April, 2006 Canadian director Robert Favreau released a screen adaptation of the novel .
79;Although I haven't seen it yet, I hope it will be good.
80;saying that such films help us not to let something like this happen ever again is trivial, but it's true.
81;And the more people know the history the better.
82;hotel Rwanda is very much like the movie Schindler's List.
83;Though a realistic thinker, he's also a man of high morals, and gives everything up.
84;Using his influence and his intelligence, he finds ways to continually keep the Hutu militia from his hotel.
85;the character of Paul Rusesabagina is played by Don Cheadle, one of the finer actors of today, and his presence in this movie is felt in absolutely every scene.
86;He knows how to work those around him, and understands more than most that the world revolves around money and bribery, and is more than willing to use this to save those around him.
87;He chooses to be a caring human before saving his own self.
88;respect, and this is what makes the character of Paul so special, both real and in the movie.
89;I'd recommend this movie to anyone, and in fact I wish everyone could see this movie.
90;It's equally as important as Schindler's List.
91;It's a story of human strength and human weakness all in one, and makes a strong distinction between the two.
92;The movie presents the story and events in a very straightforward / unglamorized mannor which makes it all the more realistic.
93;it also explains the root history of the origins of the conflict in Rwanada .
94;very heart touching and truthful movie.
95;Hotel Rwanda is a movie that is emotional and moving, displaying how one hotel manager has a human heart in saving many others' lives when UN abandoned the country to permit violence occurring in Rwanda.
96;And then we keep moving on with our lives, hoping someone else will take charge of it.
97;Maybe the American government has done the best they can to run this country and to keep world peace.
98;Don Cheadle portrayed an excellent role in this eye.
99;opener, thrilling and true story drama.
100;It was full of adventure, suspense,drama and a lot of action.
101;My students all loved it.
102;The truth and sadness of it was moving.
103;Hotel Rwanda is that rarest of movies .
104;which is an outstanding accomplishment given the subject.
105;I was fully prepared to see a hand.
106;"And while the film most properly illustrated the inaction of the West (while noticably leaving out the names ""Clinton"" and ""Albright""), the movie came across more as an accurate portrayal than a partisan fluff piece."
107;throughout, the acting was supurb, and the nuance was excellent.
108;"This is a fantastic example of ""getting your point across"" that the nimrods in Hollywood would do well to emulate."
109;but all of this aside, the measure of the movie is in its impact, and Hotel Rwanda should stand among the greats in this regard.
110;The actors, directors, and producers of Hotel Rwanda should be praised for their brutal honesty, restraint, and courage in bringing such a film to life.
111;but ultimately, the most important thing about this film is that it is based on a true story.
112;The divide betwen the majority of human history and the modern American middle/upper class world is immense.
113;A line that we would do well to demarcate and do well to defend.
114;A very gripping drama on what it must have been like to through that level of uncertainty on a daily basis not knowing if you were going to be alive by the time the sun sets.
115;an amazing performance by Don Cheadle and Nick Nolte.
116;This Hollywood movie is an outstanding telling of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
117;Both actors, Don Cheadle, playing Paul Rusesabagina, and Sophie Okonedo, as Paul's wife, were nominated for an Oscar for their incredible performance.
118;this movie fits multiple genres: drama, history and thriller.
119;fictional events, and a thriller, for its intensely suspenseful scenes that don't let you guess what the end will bring.
120;one of the wonderful things about the movie is, that it isn't just another Hollywood bloodshed, but without concentrating on the dead and how they died, portraits a very realistic image of the struggle between the Hutus and the Tutsis.
121;The movie will open your heart and mind for the Rwandan victims.
122;portraying the real events of the 1994 genocide this movie grabs your attention and pulls you in like an action thriller.
123;Having met Paul Rusesabagina personally and heard first hand that everything in the movie reflects realty, I can only recommend this amazing movie.
124;Acting was great and plot kept me interested.
125;for me, the tremendous strength of the movie was one man's valor, of hotel manager's Paul Rusesabagina humble commitment to do the right thing, even though the world around him was chaotically destroying itself.
126;He worked hard to raise his family, and tried to keep politically neutral.
127;"like ""Schindler's List,"" the antihero's commitment is the redemption of the story."
128;He took the higher road, and tells a story of hope in the middle of a holocaust.
129;If the movie impacts you, please consider supporting relief efforts that continue in Kigali today.
130;The film is one of the most gritty, intense,factual dramas in the past few years.
131;but the crew of this film put together a film that will resonate for many years.
132;It involved politics, culture, family, religion, race, and many other questions of ethics.
133;It told the WHOLE story from all perspectives and made you see the HUMANITY.
134;this film is a must see for anyone who claims oppression or has an interest in international affairs.
135;This was a real event, with real people, and real consequences.
136;It certainly makes one think about how easy it is for us to forget our history and allow it to be repeated
137;This movie deals with some heavy subject matter, and some of the images are quite graphic.
138;The acting is great, Don Cheadle definitely deserved to be nominated for leading actor for his role in this film.
139;It is unbeliveably good and moving.
140;There were moments that tears filled my eyes, and I was also so mad at us as human beings.
141;The actors did their best and they were terrific.
142;Best wishes for your career.
143;That is true, I'm sure.
144;"what makes this film so remarkable, and powerful, is that it takes the ""whole"" story and distills it down to human scale."
145;It gives us people we can relate to and a story we can manage.
146;It becomes the story not of the Rwandan genocide, but of how that atrocity affected real people and how, even in the midst of such horror, love and courage and compassion .
147;and yes, even occasional humor!
148;found a way to survive.
149;Hotel Rwanda is a remarkable film that borders between social commentary, documentary, and character study in the Main Character .
150;filmed in South Africa, it includes documentary film of actual events woven subtly into the film.
151;Bill Clinton in this instance, more than any other, had greatness within his grasp to act with the greatest impact upon Human History and demonstrate the values he claimed to possess.
152;paul Rusesabagina presents a rich study in Character and Leadership.
153;overall, this is a remarkable film.
154;There are few films that have the potential to impact one's life.
155;This film can, if you will let it.
156;It shows you how one person was so compassionate and caring for his people.
157;This movie is an example of the how good film.
158;making can be: powerful performances, a great script, and educating viewers.
159;It was a terrible story, and emotionally draining, but well and fairly done, I thought.
160;this is something that we all need to see and remember.
161;I enjoyed the movie i found it interesting, i enjoy films like this anywayssorry that all i got !
162;It is a good movie!
163;Cheadle's character Paul Rusesabagina is a really, really good and calm four.
164;work despite incredible odds to cope with this tragedy and save their family and endangered community.
165;okonedo and Cheadle's most powerful scenes, though, come when the Rusesabaginas are forced to discuss what to do should their family be slaughtered.
166;He's in almost every scene, and he's magnificent.
167;Though the film isn't unnecessarily bloody, it's a difficult movie to watch, even though the story is a great one.
168;This is such an important film.
169;Chief character was well played and his acts are an inspiration.
170;Have watched this several times and it is an excellent film!
171;You need to watch this chilling film!
172;A wonderful film about courage, survival and both the failures and rewards of our need to rely on each other.
173;The script is extremely well written and the actors are astounding in their respective roles.
174;But it seems the old adage still rings true, that the more things change, the more they stay the same.
175;front, thanks to this movie (and some other very good documentaries on the subject, I hear).
176;the story is so important, because not many individuals can imagine this as something that could be happening right now around us.
177;We see his heart break, and realise our hearts are breaking also.
178;Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte are the hardest to watch, not because of their very good performances, but because the words they say excuse NO ONE from the guilt and responsibility of the slaughters.
179;most impressive of all, are the hutus that support the killings.
180;"Tony Kgoroge (really good is this movie) is very hateful as Gregoire
I:11409;181;I really enjoyed his performance, as a character, he is unforgettable.
I:11409;182;These antagonists are gripping .
I:11409;183;It is a credit to these performances that both horror and humor are communicated so efficiently, giving the story a realistic, relatable, powerful feel.
I:11409;184;(4.0*) DIRECTION:This has to be one of my favorite aspects of this film.
I:11409;185;In terms of the 'PG.13' rating it has received, rather than it being a hindrance, it elevates the movie even more.
I:11409;186;The feeling of not knowing what will happen next, or only being able to IMAGINE what can happen, works really well in the film.
I:11409;187;To the directors credit, a little more graphic violence could have easily made Hotel Rwanda an 'R', but this film really makes clear the difference between communicative, and gratuitous .
I:11409;188;excellent directive decision, and it allows so many more of us younger ones to see this important story.
I:11409;189;like, another way of bringing the viewer deeper into the film, and making the true story seem.
I:11409;190;It is very powerful, and is a credit to the director.
I:11409;191;And that's just two countries, and that's just in Africa.
I:11409;192;The real issue this movie raises is when we DO see it, what are WE going to do about it .
I:11409;193;Just as there really WAS an Oscar Schindler, who didn't follow the crowd who had the power, but followed his own heart .
I:11409;194;These are the reasons I really appreciate this film.
I:11409;195;I'm really glad I got to see Hotel Rwanda, and I hope you get to do the same.
I:11409;196;I highly recommend this film.
I:11409;197;This is an oscar performance by Don Cheedle, the film stays close to actual historic fact without gore.
I:11409;198;I heard this was a good movie,was I surprised this was probably the best movie I have seen in the last 2 years.
I:11409;199;This movie was so realistic and this also was a true story.
I:11409;200;I knew a little about Rwanda, this was a very powerful movie and heart wrenching.
I:11409;201;He is a hero, as no one wanted to help and it was up to him what he did to help others survive.
I:11409;202;as I have tried to do!It slowly creeps in, few details here and there, subtly introduced by a clever director.
I:11409;203;the genocide of Rwanda is told from the eyes and real.
I:11409;204;life experience of a manager (Paul Rusesabagina played by Don Cheadle) of a Belgian resort hotel in Rwanda's capital city.
I:11409;205;The memories of horrors and anguish presented are still vivid.
I:11409;206;the cinematography is impeccable, and this real drama.
I:11409;207;style movie ends like a documentary one, with details on the historical realities of Rwanda 1994 and Paul Rusesabagina's family situation.
I:11409;208;this movie has won the 2004 Audience, and Best Feature award at the 2004 American Film Institute.
I:11409;209;star vote for this intense and positive story .
I:11409;210;first, it showed the amazing contrast between the goodness of Paul Rusesabagina and the forces he opposed (both the rebels and the Europeans and U. n. who abandoned him to his fate).
I:11409;211;One memorable scene shows a photographer (who originally filmed the genocide) leaving town in the rain .
I:11409;212;finally, the film did a commendable job of showing that basic decency, moral courage, and honor can be present even in a time of great depravity, and this compassion and kindness can be so wonderful.
I:11409;213;Don Cheadle does a great job as the noble hotel manager.
I:11409;214;I add my thumbs up to this very popular flick.
I:11409;215;The film is an utter masterpiece and is packed with suspense and sadness (not in a good sense, but representing the feelings that were happening at the time)The movie is a real """"eye opener""""."""
216;the fact that this is a recent event happening little more than a decade ago brings a sort of sickness to your stomach.
217;The acting was supurb, the atmosphere was intense, the fear was lingering and the imagery was tremendous.
218;Both extras work well as good adjuncts to the package and lead to plenty of head shaking as to why the West ignored the genocide of 1994.
219;They also show you how cool a cucumber Rusesabinga is under the most trying of situations.
220;People talk about heroes and this guy is the genuine article.
221;even for fans of real.
222;How one man was able to stay composed under such pressure and intense warfare is a gift and is unbelievable.
223;in this extremely moving and true to life film, an ordinary hotel manager (cheadle) becomes an extraordinary hero by housing tutsis refugees during their conflict with the hutu militia.
224;nominated for three academy awards, including best actor (cheadle).
225;A movie worth watching, but not if you're looking for an escape.
226;Well directed, great acting, riveting storyline.
227;And a reminder that we must have a conscience in the face of wholesale destruction of human life.
228;This is a very real movie and gives the viewer a lot to think about in life.
229;so sad, but well acted and enlightening!
230;I highly recommend this movie!
231;This was an excellent movie, very factual from my studies of the Rwandan genocide.
232;I was glad to be able to watch this movie online as a Prime member.
233;A nice benefit of my Prime membership.
234;"The film, Hotel Rwanda, is similar to Schindler's List and The Diary of Ann Frank, in that it is more than entertainment
I:11409;235;Therfore the film has to be reviewed both as an artistic statement and as a political statement.
I:11409;236;first, this is suberb film making with an incredible cast of actors.
I:11409;237;The film did an excellent job of balancing the tensions and drama within the hotel with the terror in the streets.
I:11409;238;Thus the film demonstrated at the individual, the family, the neighborhood, the ethnic, and the national levels the terror of this genocide.
I:11409;239;Keep it in your collection since it is part of human history.
I:11409;240;And I can tell you what's causing it.
I:11409;241;But watch these movies and documentaries until you have figured it out for yourself.
I:11409;242;He moved me to the core of my being in a way that film rarely does.
I:11409;243;Hotel Rwanda was a touching film that is worth viewing.
I:11409;244;over all the plot of the movie was a good choice because it makes other people aware of the issues that are happening internationally that might be hidden or sometimes even biased from the propaganda.
I:11409;245;That was just nice to note.
I:11409;246;as far as the movie goes, I think they did a great job of telling the story and while they managed to give you an idea of the corruption, aggression and abuse of the continent without making it a blood and guts movie.
I:11409;247;They also balanced this with the story of everyday normal africans.
I:11409;248;This is a really excellent movie that will keep you in suspense and awe at the courage of Paul Rusesabagina and the horrible cruelty humanity is capable of.
I:11409;249;Hotel is a powerful movie.
I:11409;250;It is by far one of the best movies I have seen in my lifetime.
I:11409;251;Cheadle did a great job with the script, the actors.
I:11409;252;I watched this movie last night, and it moved me in a way very few movies have done.
I:11409;253;And on the other, you have a man who is willing to do everything to save the lives of his family and many others.
I:11409;254;this is a true story.
I:11409;255;together movie that is reasonably accurate (which is a very good thing, considering the sensitive subject matter).
I:11409;256;dominant acting performances, just strong showings, another big advantage.
I:11409;257;A real reality check and a must see!!
I:11409;258;Hotel Rwanda tells the compelling and true story of how hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina miraculously managed to save the lives of more than 1,200 refugees during the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda in 1992.
I:11409;259;It is a story well suited to the film medium and the script would seem well thought out.
I:11409;260;Firstly, the acting performances are not convincing, and this is surprising considering the talented cast.
I:11409;261;that leaves the worthy story of Paul Rusesabagina himself and this fairly saves the movie.
I:11409;262;He is a real life hero and should be honoured as such.
I:11409;263;but frankly he deserves a better movie!
I:11409;264;A great visual interpretation of some of the devestation which most of us do not understand or comprehend along with a wonderful cast which was practically flawless
I:11409;265;This is one of the most realistic and engaging docudramas that I've ever seen.
I:11409;266;He plays the real life Hutu man who saves nearly 1300 people from certain death.
I:11409;267;The Tutsis were put in charge of the Hutus by the Belgians, which naturally created an animosity and a clear separation between the two groups.
I:11409;268;what's fascinating is how Don Cheadle's character manages to constantly out.
I:11409;269;smart the enemy on all sides, against all odds no less.
I:11409;270;The performances all around were as authentic as one could possibly expect, and as heart felt as human emotions go.
I:11409;271;How can the west merrily ignore their desperate pleas for help?This kind of film is important to see not only for its artistic spirit and truthfulness, but also to open people's eyes and question the world around us, and it makes people appreciate what they have even more as opposed to taking our peaceful existence for granted.
I:11409;272;perhaps the most poignant moments of the film is when human lives are reduced to the value of trinkets, money and booze.
I:11409;273;It's an interesting study into the heart of madness and the ultimate depravity of mankind, how seemingly ordinary people can succumb to the utmost reaches of deplorability.
I:11409;274;It will chill one to the bone.
I:11409;275;Unfortunatelly this is true about other genocides that are taking place right now such as the one in Darfour, Sudan ([.]
I:11409;276;at some points watching this movie it feels that you are watching a documentary.
I:11409;277;an inspiring movie that helps us realize that even as individuals we can make a big difference.
I:11409;278;Except for the distraction of the miscast Nolte, the acting is strong.
I:11409;279;Don Cheadle was inspired in his riveting performance in director Terry George's superb documentary style dramatic re.
I:11409;280;cheadle, a moderate Hutu, had curried favor with many influential people in his position in the hotel.
I:11409;281;george's realistic portrayal of this horrendous chapter in human history was an eye opening experience of an incident that didn't get the worldwide media coverage it deserved.
I:11409;282;This movie represented an important addition to our social consciousness and was wonderfully executed.
I:11409;283;This is a powerful and moving film that tells the story of the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people through the attempts of one man to save a few from death by machete.
I:11409;284;The protagonist is a simple hotel manager, a real person whose name is Paul Rusesabagina.
I:11409;285;He is an intelligent and resourceful man working at a four star hotel in Kigali.
I:11409;286;He is a Hutu and a member of the majority, but his wife and therefore his children are Tutsis and are part of the resented minority.
I:11409;287;Don Cheadle gives a wonderful performance and deserves his Oscar nomination and probably should have one the award for this performance.
I:11409;288;i think this is a movie that everyone should see and think about, especially with mature young people who need to know what happened not so long ago.
I:11409;289;This was a very compelling film,one that I watched three times, twice back to back.
I:11409;290;Don Cheadle was excellent in his award nominated role of Paul Ruseabagina, and probably would have won the oscar if the film had been about a less politically embrassing subject.
I:11409;291;It is enlightening as it is enjoyable.
I:11409;292;I really enjoyed it, hope you do to.
I:11409;293;Having read Left to Tell by Immaculee Ilibigiza several years ago, when I saw the title of this movie I knew it was something I wanted to see.
I:11409;294;Refused to move from computer until the movie ended.
I:11409;295;And that is very unusual for me.
I:11409;296;For provocation and inspiration based upon a true story, watch this film.
I:11409;297;Amazing dipicting the truth of what went on in Rwanda.
I:11409;298;star hotel which serves as a haven for Europeans and African Elites, gives a performance that is at once measured, controlled and deeply anguished.
I:11409;299;cheadle's Ruseasabagina (a Hutu who is married to a Tutsi, played by Sophie Okonedo )first shows an unremarkable decency that ascends to heroic proportions as he risks the lives of himself and family, attempting to shield and help well over 1200 people.
I:11409;300;The film's intensity is heightened by the fact that many surviving Rwandan refugees from that era were recruited as extras.
I:11409;301;The movie also benefits enormously from provocative performances given by Sophie Okonedo (as Tatiana, his long.
I:11409;302;Does it make you feel righteous, weeping over the long.
I:11409;303;Does it make you feel oh.
I:11409;304;It is a true story with accurate depictions, powerful acting (Don Cheadle's breakdown is one of the moving performances I have seen in a while), beautiful cinematography, and it has emotion due to the movie content.
I:11409;305;It's amazing (with Black Hawk Down) the mistakes that Clinton made that people forget about.
I:11409;306;I felt such a connection with the actors in this movie and just wanted to do whatever I could to help them (as they looked so helpless).
I:11409;307;The ending was powerful as well and after watching the movie Ray, I thought that Hotel Rwanda was looked over for Best Picture of The Year.
I:11409;308;Highly recommended and in my top five movies off all time!
I:11409;309;star reviewers tossing out comparisons to """"Schindler's List""""."""
310;Good heavens, both films deal with mass murder.
311;There is a constant anti.
312;When they do not get involved they are considered callous and heartless.
313;don Cheadle turns in a memorable if unpolished star turn that anchors this survival tale.
314;that's precisely what Hotel Rwanda is: a survival tale.
315;This tells the story of Paul's determination, his love for his family, the people's turmoil, and the peacekeeper's struggle to maintain their heroism.
316;These stories fit amongst one another beautifully, sharing a broader perspective of the events and the motives.
317;this strong, emotional film is wonderfully expressed through the actors in their equally emotional roles.
318;Though everybody offers their full potential talents, Oscar nominees Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo stand out.
319;Cheadle portrays Paul as a compassionate man who knows what he must do.
320;This previously underrated actor finally received the recognition he deserves with his talent.
321;Okonedo portrays Paul's wife beautifully.
322;She expresses her character wonderfully as a family woman and as a victim.
323;I was probably preoccupied with something trivial at the time so I gave it passing attention.
324;"Terry George's film is a piece with other recent depictions of modern atrocity, ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Killing Fields"" come to mind."
325;Cheadle's portrayal of a successful hotel manager who finds himself caught up in the chaos and finds the inner reserve to achieve great acts of human courage is nothing short of a marvel.
326;This is not a showy part and Cheadle demonstrates the quiet dignity of this incredible man.
327;"Nolte uses spicy language, including the ""N word"" to drive home this stark point."
328;Paul is a Hutu and he takes in both Tutsis and Hutus.
329;He resorts to bribery, cajolery, the good offices of the UN, and anything else he can grasp at to save the refugees.
330;Don Cheadle is simply fantastic portraying the courageous Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager who risks everything to save the lives of those targeted for death.
331;Paul and his wife Sophie (Tatiana Rusesabagina) are living the good life.
332;These are unavoidable questions which will haunt you.
333;Director Terry George has put together a great film.
334;There is no question but that Hotel Rwanda earns five stars.
335;He was pretty good all things considered I think so.
336;Hotel Rwanda is an amazing movie that captures the drama of a real.
337;life event in the African country of Rwanda.
338;Paul Rusesabagina, played by Don Cheadle, is a hotel manager that becomes an extraordinary hero by housing Tutsi refugees.
339;This film is a vivid reminder of what can happen if the world turns its back on struggling countries.
340;several scenes in this film are especially touching.
341;Another scene that was touching is one that shows how the U. n. and the world turn its cheek of the situation in Rwanda.
342;rwandans are evacuated a group of nuns and children from a church show up.
343;the film hotel Rwanda really hits home.
344;this film captures the drama of a real.
345;life event and displays it to the world.
346;I give this film five stars.
347;Don Cheadle does not play the leading role in Rosewood, but still gives a great performance.
348;both films are amazing pieces of work and I hope everyone gets a chance to view them for themselves.
349;Paul Rusesabagina was (and is) a true hero in the most purest form.
350;This is a man I would love to add to my wishlist of people I would like to meet, if the circumstances were made available.
351;i like films that deal with human interest storylines.
352;The film works not because the screen is filled with special effects and visions of horror, but focuses on the relationship between two men under horrendous circumstances.
353;Don Cheadle's portrayal of Rusesabagina was seamless and subtle and I really could empathize with his character.
354;The movie is true to life.
355;Even though we know it is a true story, it is so well acted.
356;"Throughout the film, ""Hotel Rwanda"", the protagonist, Paul Rusesabagina (played by Don Cheadle) deceives, flatters, lies, and uses the property that belongs to others for bribery."
357;In Luke 16, Jesus told about a manager whose boss discovered he was cheating.
358;This won him the favor of the debtors.
359;And if we are wise we will use those resources for eternity.
360;This is a true story.
361;It's a very good movie.
362;I have watched it at least 20 times and each time it's just as good as the first.
363;Don Cheadle's performance was outstanding and the film is very well made.
364;Such a good movie from the acting to the directors visions of the movie was so powerful.
365;She is in mortal danger.
366;paul manages a luxury hotel.
367;wise, efficient, suavely diplomatic man who dresses impeccably and who knows how to influence people with well.
368;He is told they come from China at a cost of ten cents each and can be sold for many times that amount.
369;this is the first hint of the horror to come, and the way it is revealed is characteristic of directorTerry George's calculated method.
370;This is most chilling because when one tribe or nation sets out to kill the people of another tribe or nation the essential element is to turn those people into something less than humans.
371;the personal story itself within this greater scenario is that of Paul and his family and how he was persuaded by a moral imperative that he himself felt to save hundreds of Tutsi by housing them in the luxury hotel he managed after the Europeans left.
372;We see how he risked his life and family and how his courage and resourcefulness proved heroic.
373;Terry George tells the story in a straightforward manner with vivid and deliberate detail.
374;the acting by Don Cheadle as Paul and by Sophie Okonedo who played his wife is outstanding.
375;this is a message film.
376;The message goes out to the whole world, and Terry George makes us understand that those people who were slaughtered could be people anywhere, in particular they could be middle class Americans or Europeans.
377;By showing us the ordinary domestic life of Paul and his family at home, their love and affection for one another.
378;and there will be a next time, and a time after that and then another until such a day comes when the rule of law prevails internationally and people everywhere understand that we are all essentially the same and that the baser nature of our leaders must be controlled by law and justice.
379;"Don Cheadle and his supporting cast
I:11409;380;This movie is strong enough to convince you to ask questions.
I:11409;381;The genocide occured in 1994 and it is now finally being revealed to the majority of the American public.
I:11409;382;It will most likely be more informative and enlightening than this movie.
I:11409;383;He played the role of a Hutu manager who is married to a Tutsi.
I:11409;384;His performance stood out as he put his heart and soul into the movie.
I:11409;385;this is a good movie to watch.
I:11409;386;it took courage for the hotel manager to keep refugees to safety in the midst of a civil war and the resentment of his own tribe.
I:11409;387;I cried during several parts.
I:11409;388;there's a good chance you knew nothing of the genocide taking place in Rwanda on the African continent.
I:11409;389;winning film HOTEL RWANDA all the more compelling, as it tells a heart.
I:11409;390;wrenching story about one man's humble heroics to save over 1,200 souls in the face of utter brutality.
I:11409;391;Based on a true story, Don Cheadle gives an unforgettable performance as Paul Rusesabagina, an assistant manager at the five.
I:11409;392;and Paul's heroics all the more compelling.
I:11409;393;HOTEL RWANDA is a lasting tribute to the indomitable human spirit.
I:11409;394;The tragedy unfolds before him, enveloping his family and country.
I:11409;395;it tackles an ambitious topic: hate transformed into genocide.
I:11409;396;What a departure from the amazing Hollywood schlock machine.
I:11409;397;A great film entertains, but it also forces us to examine our moral code . . . to act with decency and justice towards man.
I:11409;398;This was an incredible event that went unnoticed by the rest of the world.
I:11409;399;Don Cheadle did an excellent job in his role!
I:11409;400;There was also an HBO movie, Sometimes In April that was released at the same time and is also worth watching.
I:11409;401;Hotel Rwanda is an extremely dramatic and important film.
I:11409;402;the bonus features are haunting.
I:11409;403;the actress who played Sofia, Sophie Okonedo did a really great job in this film.
I:11409;404;She was very convincing as a worried wife and mother doing her best to protect her family.
I:11409;405;One never knows what goes on behind enemy lines until you experience it yourself.
I:11409;406;I am impressed with this one.
I:11409;407;He is really a talented individual!I shouldn't be so quick to judge though.
I:11409;408;His role in Boogie Nights, also featured some wonderful comedic actors by Mr. Meadows, and he was the comic relief of that movie, featuring Marky Mark.
I:11409;409;definitely pick up this movie!
I:11409;410;All I can say is """"Outstanding Movie"""" on all levels."""
411;Sounds, acting, color, content, and pacing are on the money.
412;Don Cheadle deserved his Oscar nomination and in my book should have won.
413;Written by Kier Pearson and Terry George, this remarkable story has been directed powerfully by George, who makes the wise decision to focus on the plight of Rusesabagina and his family rather than take a more epic approach to what would have been too overwhelming to view in full force.
414;Their situation is compelling enough given that Paul is a Hutu and his wife is a Tutsi.
415;Cheadle plays these key scenes with minimum fuss and makes them all the more emotionally resonant, in particular, when he has a delayed reaction to seeing corpses strewn on a fog.
416;Matching him every step of the way is the superb Sophie Okonedo, who transforms the standard wife.
417;mother role of Tatiana into something quite transcendent.
418;Strongly recommended, in fact, essential viewing of a reenactment of a massive genocide swept under the rug by the Western media.
419;Well acted and good presentation of the heroic efforts in Rwanda of so many during the civil war.
420;I watched it a second time making my teen kids watch it with me.
421;This movie was very interesting and very powerful.
422;I thought the acting in this movie was good.
423;I highly recommend this movie.
424;"In ""Hotel Rwanda"" we are give the story of a man who made a difference and that is wonderful."
425;I feel this is due to the need to make Americans comfortable, to make us not look at what we did to help the murders that happened.
426;This is a great movie!
427;Wonderful acting, gripping real life story.
428;Dan Cheadle is excellent as the main character who keeps his wits about him at all time, doing more for his people than the U. n.
429;The movie deserved the awards it recieved.
430;This movie is just incredible and Don Cheedle is incredible, the story is incredible.
431;If you want to watch a brave, heartwarming, scary, sad, and happy movie, watch this one.
432;Heartwrenching performances and the overall message of bravery and courage were defined clearly by Mr. Don Cheadle.
433;There is a definite lesson in this movie about giving of oneself and the testament of the human spirit.
434;The focus point of the film revolves around real life hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina played by the wonderful Don Cheadle.
435;Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina was absolutely amazing with his subtle performance as the protanganist of the film.
436;Sophie Okonedo as Paul's wife Tatiana was equally wonderful.
437;There were time during the film when I felt that I was watching a documentary than a film based on a true life event.
438;I loved this film because it did not preach or blame anyone for the atrocities, not to mention being biased.
439;"In my opinion, ""Hotel Rwanda"" should have won for best picture at this past Oscars."
440;This film gives me faith that there are films out there that can entertain and move the viewer at the same time.
441;Hotel Rwanda is a very powerful film that touches on hate, violence, and political corruption.
442;It also focuses on family matters and, to some extent, the American media.
443;hotel Rwanda is an excellent and unforgettable film that is quite effective due to the story being true.
444;It's strong, it's unsettling, it's humorless, but most of all, it's important.
445;This is easily one of the best films of 2004, and one of the best of the 2000's.
446;The movie Hotel Rwanda was wonderful.
447;The story tugged at the heart of the viewer and really brought one to realize the significance behind being involved in the world.
448;Hotel Rwanda is a true story.
449;It is hard to rate a true story.
450;Yet it is immensely admirable and inspiring to see the courage of so many to stand up for what is right, to fight for your own people, and to immerse yourself in the internal (and external) struggle of the heart.
451;A very touching story about genocide.
452;this movie is a monumental account of what happened in Rwanda that the whole western world turned their face away from.
453;In this case, I will make an exception.
454;"This movie, like ""City of God,"" is a phenomenal look outside of American culture."
455;and you will certainly begin to question the reality of racism.
456;was absolutely fantastic in his role and his character shows you how quickly self.
457;importance can turn to motivation for a cause.
458;this movie should be compulsory in high schools across America because it is a reminder of the importance of life and tolerance.
459;"The History Channel has a very affordable and superbly done documentary ""Rwanda ."
460;don Cheadle gives an amazing performance as Paul Ruesabagina, a well connected hotel manager who becomes a hero when he decides to stand on his principals and assist Tutsi refugees, orphans marked for death and others who had been put on the Hutu death lists.
461;It is less Hollywood than Hotel Rwanda and excellent on it's own.
462;What a heart breaking movie and to know this is a true story!
463;Really gives you a look into what happen there.
464;at least an idea because living through that is impossible much respect and honor to those who stood up for their rights!!
465;This is one of the better films that I have seen lately, and well deserving of the Academy Award nominations that it received.
466;The film stars Don Cheadle portraying Paul Rusesabagina in a role in which he was nominated for Best Actor, also well deserved.
467;paul is able to get his family and a van full of neighbors back to his Hotel in hopes that United Nations soldiers will protect these refugees.
468;"this story is brutally told
I:11409;469;It's a story of how one man overcomes insurmountable odds to make a difference, and it's graphically depicted.
I:11409;470;Again, this film is not for the squeamish"
471;families, the wounded, orphans .
472;filled roads, he manages to keep over 1,200 people alive in the semi.
473;don Cheadle's performance as Paul Rusesabagina is simply remarkable and heartbreaking.
474;He gives Paul much dignity and strength in the face of such attrocities happening around him.
475;Sophie Okonedo also gives a strong and emotional performance as Paul's wife Tatianna.
476;All this coupled with Terry George's direction make for one of the srongest films of the past year.
477;This is a marvelous movie.
478;"Such a moving story
I:11409;479;She certainly is an unsung star in this film.
I:11409;480;where powerful leaders use their power for personal gain rather than assist others in dire need of help.
I:11409;481;as i said this is a great movie.
I:11409;482;it is based in a true story about the comflit between two african groups(tutsis and the huttus).
I:11409;483;So it succeeded on those grounds.
I:11409;484;The truth and true happenings are stranger than fiction.
I:11409;485;Every good soul should see this one.
I:11409;486;the cast and directors of Hotel Rwanda have done a marvelous work in drawing you into this conflict and portraying a scenario that begs you to care about a people and crisis working outside of your paradigm.
I:11409;487;What you see is a fairly accurate portrayal of what happened in Rwanda.
I:11409;488;Use it as a catalyst to cause you to care for the world outside your backyard and to feel the burden of the worlds poorest spirits.
I:11409;489;this movie is based on a true story of a Hutu man who works at a Belgian hotel and tries desperately through bribes to save Tutsi people who are staying inside the hotel.
I:11409;490;This movie is very emotional and the acting is well done.
I:11409;491;Movies like this are very necessary to watch and see what is going on in the world.
I:11409;492;I urge you instead of watching the latest Hollywood movie where there isn't much to be learned, please watch this important movie.
I:11409;493;it is a well done historical movie,
I:11409;494;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I have seen plenty.
I:11409;495;This movie is definitely a piece of very important history for us all.
I:11409;496;At that very moment I was ashamed to be an """"American""""."""
497;don Cheadle was superb, and the actress who played his wife was amazing.
498;With all that was going on around them, that was a well deserved moment of humor for all of them.
499;the interplay of the characters was interesting .
500;This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
501;It has left me with great sadness and an appreciation for our freedom.
502;A well written movie which shows the horrors of genocide.
503;a brilliant prformance by Don Cheadle.
504;I watched this movie 3 times and will watch it again.
505;One of the best movies ever.
506;"Love it and will recommend it to othersRegards,Matt
I:11409;507;I watched this movie with deep saddness.
I:11409;508;It begins well and we see normal family living amony the people.
I:11409;509;They are working people and they live in modest homes.
I:11409;510;It is very well done.
I:11409;511;I would only recommend this movie to adults who are interested in the genticide that took place in Rwanda.You will feel so helpless when you see this movie.
I:11409;512;HOTEL RWANDA isa great movie.
I:11409;513;he wasalso moved by it.
I:11409;514;With these words written on a visitors' log in a memorial site in Rwanda, the reason for making this stunning film is posed.
I:11409;515;How many of us knew about this incident before now?But this well.
I:11409;516;the cast is exceptional: Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo are brilliant in their roles and the supporting cast is superb.
I:11409;517;This is a powerful film that deals with an atrocity without electing to lambaste the viewer with gore: the message is more powerful for its understatement.
I:11409;518;Hotel Rwanda goes as far as delivering a feel.
I:11409;519;good ending, just the type of movie we might have been watching on a Sunday night of Spring 1994 while overlooking the terribly efficient implementation of a genocide in a vague and far away place.
I:11409;520;Sometimes in April is an excellent movie that focuses on the events as experienced by the Rwandan people and not just one man in a relatively cosy position responding to them.
I:11409;521;And in the scope of this tragedy, learning is essential.
I:11409;522;In one of the darkest days of modern times when the nations of the world stood by as hundreds of thousands were slaughtered this is a true story of how one man risked his life to save his fellow man.
I:11409;523;An incredibly moving film that is both a cautionary tale and the story how one brave man can make a difference.
I:11409;524;It is a moving and tragic story about the genocide that occurred in Rwanda, focusing on this hotel and the man that fought to keep people alive.
I:11409;525;It is absolutely amazing and sad.
I:11409;526;I always enjoy movies that make you think and tackle a difficult subject.
I:11409;527;I highly recommend this to everyone.
I:11409;528;provoking and will tear at your heartstrings.
I:11409;529;It is graphic at times so I do not recommend it for the younger crowd.
I:11409;530;This film is certainly as good as any movie released in 2004 and will stand the test of time.
I:11409;531;Anyone who has the slightest interest in world events knows of the killing of a million or more Tutsis by the Hutus in the mid.90's.
I:11409;532;HOTEL RWANDA is the true story of Paul Rusesabagina who almost single.
I:11409;533;His character is played by Don Cheadle, nominated for an Oscar for best actor for his role as the hotel manager.
I:11409;534;He gives a magnificent performance and in any other year should have won.
I:11409;535;this movie should be required viewing for everyone.
I:11409;536;This film is an absolute masterpiece that speaks about the true events that happened in Rwanda.
I:11409;537;Cheadle gives a hands down absolutely brilliant performance and after seeing Ray, I would have given the oscar to Cheadle even though Foxx was good as well.
I:11409;538;Cheadle's character is a Hutu but his family and most of his friends are Tootsies.
I:11409;539;They succeed in many ways in this horryifying story.
I:11409;540;This is nevertheless a masterpiece that depicts an atrocity.
I:11409;541;Hotel Rwanda is a great movie AND based on a true story.
I:11409;542;Even if you don't know about the internal conflict in Rwanda, you will still get emotionally invested in the characters, and ultimately, you will most likely enjoy this movie.
I:11409;543;While he has to figure out how to hide so many people from corrupt soldiers, he also has to keep his mixed.
I:11409;544;ethnicity family safe, even when the stakes get high.
I:11409;545;I would also recommend it to people who don't know much about the Rwandan genocide, but would like to learn more.
I:11409;546;He used his skills and connections to bribe and intimidate those in power to keep from attacking his hotel.
I:11409;547;this movie is gripping through and through.
I:11409;548;It also is a good indicator of the ineffectiveness of the U. n. and the apathy of the Western World.
I:11409;549;other things mentioned in this film shed light on the events of the 90's.
I:11409;550;Africa, and the West's apathy towards it, will haunt our souls for generations to come.
I:11409;551;When i first picked up this movie at block buster i thought it looked interesting.
I:11409;552;When i started watching this movie it hit close to home.
I:11409;553;It seemed amazing that things like this could happen in my life time.
I:11409;554;It gives you an eary feeling but a one with much hope for the future.
I:11409;555;This was one of the best.
I:11409;556;All those things helped drive home the impact of the events.
I:11409;557;This movie takes you there, and makes it real.
I:11409;558;The courage of Cheadle's character is absolutely stunning, especially in the face of constant death threats.
I:11409;559;This is a brilliant movie which shows the horror of the Rwandan Genecide.
I:11409;560;The acting by all is superb, but the most powerful actor is Nick Nolte, who plays Colonol Oliver, a Canadian UN peacekeeper who is powerless to stop the atrocity raging around him.
I:11409;561;He went above and beyond the duty he had and tryed to help in all ways, even going so far to argue with his superiors over UN involvement.
I:11409;562;hotel rwanda is an excellent movie.
I:11409;563;extremely moving and heartfelt that you can't help but wish there was something you could do.
I:11409;564;it delivers the truth that is happening or has happened in so many countries.
I:11409;565;this film is touching and truly inspirational on so many levels.
I:11409;566;the brutallity of some people, that stands against this one mans courage to stand up and help.
I:11409;567;he is determined to help his people to survive at all cost.
I:11409;568;all the while you see the fear in his eyes, but you also see the courage in his heart.
I:11409;569;he gives everything, although he is in constant danger.
I:11409;570;in the end he is a hero in the eyes of those he helped and is an example to all others, and just when he thinks he can do no more, help has come.
I:11409;571;excellent directing, and if this film doesn't move you in one way or another, damn then i don't know what's up with you.
I:11409;572;i got to hand it to don cheadle, this man is wonderful.
I:11409;573;this is a one in a lifetime performance.
I:11409;574;great actor, and you know he gave it all and then some in this film.
I:11409;575;he portrays brilliantly what one man did to save over 1,200 refugees from the hands of mad men.
I:11409;576;Its gripping nature depicts the scene more as a documentary than a movie.
I:11409;577;it is a superb educational tool.
I:11409;578;Everyone should see both of these movies.
I:11409;579;One of the best and deep movies out there, and it is based off a true story.
I:11409;580;this is a great story for education too.
I:11409;581;Compelling, deeply sad evocation of human cruelty, ignorance, and prejudice, from the lowest to highest levels of society.
I:11409;582;the qualities that make us keep on.
I:11409;583;What a superb film that porttaryed Africa at its worste and its best.
I:11409;584;The film was one of the best ever films to come from Africa and my compliments to the whole crew and the actors for bringing to us a story that needed to be told.
I:11409;585;The sets where superb and costumes where excellent.
I:11409;586;The actors, all and without exception, portrayed the best of the continets people and also their worste side.
I:11409;587;This film about the lives of people during the genocide in Rwanda of the mid 1990's was extremely realistic and graphic, but not in a gratuitous way.
I:11409;588;Don Cheadle in particular was fantastic.
I:11409;589;Don't you get it?That being said, this is a great film.
I:11409;590;and thinking.You pretty much HAVE to recommend it to someone else and you most certainly want to talk about it.You will not forget it.
I:11409;591;Thank goodness for passionate artists like (dir.)
I:11409;592;off but I believe you will be glad if you do take the time to see this film.
I:11409;593;Great film on many levels .
I:11409;594;production, performances and history .
I:11409;595;Love the movie and the shipping was fast and easy and the movie when I popped it in look nice and clear
I:11409;596;hotel Rwanda is an impeccably poignant portrayal of the Rwandans' horror in that godless year.
I:11409;597;In spite of all the horrors he faced, Paul was able to see his family and 1,200 others through to the safe side of reality.
I:11409;598;i was extremely moved by this powerful, unforgettable film.
I:11409;599;i cannot recommend this film enough to every single living person on this earth.
I:11409;600;It's essential that you see this film for your own sake and the sake of our very survival.
I:11409;601;I know it sounds cheesy, but the level of realism in this film is astounding and its lessons are viscerally felt.
I:11409;602;and yeah, it does have a happy ending :.)
I:11409;603;Hotel Rwanda would have been a fantastic film without Don Cheadle"
604;Cheadle is touching, believable and inspiring in this role, and I for one am looking forward to seeing more of his work in the future.
605;It's nice to see some famous faces popping in on Hotel Rwanda .
606;but these are all cameo appearances, and it's the less familiar actors, Cheadle first and foremost, that give their whole and make it the fantastic experience that it is.
607;But it might just be the best movie made this year.
608;At any rate it's an important film, a film that needs to be watched and demands every bit of your attention.
609;It's a true masterpiece that will probably be remembered as a classic for many years to come.
610;As much as I like Martin Scorcese, The Aviator simply pales in comparison to this harrowing and more important film.
611;worthy and 100% convincing in his role as the Hutu Paul Rusesabagina, and Nick Nolte and le grand Jean Reno give outstanding performances in their limited screen time.
612;born newcomer Sophie Okonedo also gives a fine performance as Cheadle's Tutsi wife.
613;Filmed in South Africa as an international (mostly Canadian) production, the faces of the many other important supporting characters looked more than sufficiently authentic, providing a profound human backdrop to the events unfolding on the screen.
614;The plot devices certainly owe a debt to earlier films like The Battle of Algiers, Salvador, The Killing Fields, and Schindler's List, but we should remember that this is essentially a true story.
615;Furthermore, Hotel Rwanda's focus on one family and the strength of its bond provides an element of hope and positive feeling that brings something new and invigorating to this genre.
616;That is something that African Americans, in particular, would be well.
617;full of corruption and a man trying to do what he can to help the ones he loves.
618;This is a tragedy, mainly because it is a true story.
619;It is also very inspirational by showing how Paul Rusesabagina saved over a thousand lives rather than look away and fend for himself.
620;When you take on subjects in a film such as real life events that depicts ethnic genocides, you have a picture that has the potential to do many great things.
621;"I feel though both the real historical events and resulting film on Oscar Schindler is far more interesting than that of Paul Ruisabagina in ""Hotel Rwanda""."
622;"as a film, ""Hotel Rwanda"" also delivers short on the psychological complexities of its various characters, complexities that were painted so vividly in Spielberg's film."
623;To depict a genocide from within is impossible but here the film is admirable because it does not so much show the traumatic horror but the reactions of possible victims.
624;Others will try all they can to find a way out, to stay alive, to survive but with their companions in this drastic situations.
625;Family first, neighbours second, and then friends of friends.
626;This is the spirit of the main character.
627;Others still will be egotistic to the final end of the event and they will run into the fire and literally commit suicide.
628;As for an explanation the film provides none.
629;it is an amazing disconnect.
630;this movie is very accurate, and very telling.
631;This movie is wonderful, but it is so accurate, that it will be dismissed because it is really an indictment of the feckless Clinton regime.
632;every one who cares about humanity should see this film
633;He is a hero and this movie makes that correct judgment unequivocal.
634;he has to oppose it, and by the developed world's interest in saving its own white.
635;This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever watched, and it has evoked a wide range of emotions within me: shame for the West's apathy towards the Rwandan Genocide, disgust for the heartless murders that took place, and admiration for those who had the courage to actually try and make a differance rather than just wash their hands of the affair through hollow words and shallow sentiments.
636;"hotel Rwanda has been called ""The African Schindler's List"", due to the seeming ability of one man."
637;don Cheadle does an excellent job playing Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager.
638;His authentic delivery and emotion throughout the film are incredible, and frankly I believe he deserves the oscar, even though Jamie Foxx himself was outstanding in Ray.
639;The supporting cast all do an admirable job as well, and one of the delights of this film was that the second half is an almost a completely African one, save for Nick Nolte and the faceless UN soldiers.
640;I would highly encourage anyone curious about this film to see it.
641;As remarkable and unexplainably painful this movie was, it will make you question a lot of things around you.
642;Don Cheadle gives the performance of his lifetime, before this I thought he was best in Out of Sight, but the performance in Hotel Rwanda overshadows the one in Out of Sight, and all of his other movies.
643;"terry George's ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a gritty, realistic depiction of this terrible tragedy."
644;The storyline is based on the true life activities of a single, man whose goal was to save as many people as humanly possible.
645;He uses the 4 Star facility as a refuge for as many as the walls will hold, and then some.
646;The almost nonstop fear, suspense and sense of anxiety which permeate this film are due, in part, to Mr. Cheadle's extraordinarily believable performance, and in part, because Director George so clearly conveys here the chilling reality of recent history.
647;"the supporting cast is excellent and features: Sophie Okonedo, who gives an outstanding performance as Tatiana, Rusesabagina's wife
I:11409;648;It is a powerful, disturbing, educationally eye.
I:11409;649;I found myself sobbing more than once.
I:11409;650;This is a brilliant movie with some incredibly uplifting and inspiring moments.
I:11409;651;Hotel Rwanda is a must see film about a period in recent history when most of us were too busy going about our lives to pay much attention to what was going on a small world away.
I:11409;652;The best jobs and favors were given to the Tutsi from the French.
I:11409;653;Hotel Rwanda tells the story of the genocide that took place in that country in 1994 and in particular tells the story of one mans' courage,Paul Rusesabagina, to save the lives of as many of his fellow country men.
I:11409;654;What makes that all the more remarkable is when you realize that Rusesabagina is a Hutu and the majority of the lives he was saving from the genocide that was going on were members of the Tutsi tribe.
I:11409;655;Cheadle has had an outstanding career in acting but his work in """"Hotel Rwanda"""" might very well represent his best work as an actor."""
656;This is certainly my favorite movie that Don Cheadle has made.
657;He plays the part of Paul Rusesabagina with such ease and conviction.
658;Instead you see it through the eyes of Paul Rusesabagina so that the killing that was taking place is more up close and personal.
659;It is easy to see why.
660;Both films are truely inspirational.
661;this is a movie all should see.
662;"It is well worth the time to watch ""Hotel Rwanda"" at least once."
663;Very well done, excellent depiction of fear and tension during that time.
664;Don Cheadle and Nick Nolte are both excellent
665;Hotel Rwanda is an excellent film that has obvioulsy pulled at a lot of heart strings judging from the comments by reviewers on this site.
666;it's all happening again, right now in Darfur.
667;Don Cheadle's performace is amazing in this movie, as is Sophie Okonedo's.
668;What stood out for me in this was their characters' incredible love for each other.
669;While madness ensued, and they were fighting to survive, their family remained most important to them.
670;Their love brought me to tears in the theater, and I'm generally not sentimental.
671;jamie Foxx gave a great performance in RAY, but I truly think Cheadle deserved the Oscar.
672;His work in the movie wasn't as showy as Foxx's, but it was so much more powerful.
673;This movie deserves to win multiple awards.
674;When I saw this movie in theaters, I was so moved by it.
675;One of the best movies I have seen .
676;The writing for this movie was excellent.
677;Don Cheadle deserves some kind of award for his performance.
678;This is one of the most important films ever made.
679;the movie is tragic and inspirational that although we can't stop all of the horrors in the world, each of us can and must do what we can.
680;"Still, ""Hotel Rwanda"" raises important questions about the role of the outside world (media, government, business) in moderating brutality."
681;An excellent view into history and the immense suffering of those who experienced it.
682;This is a much watch for those with an interest in geo.
683;Started with Saving Private Ryan, directors competing to win the most realistic and most horrifying visual affect of physical human beings being destroyed.
684;Judging by New York Times review, there are certainly audiences who demanded to see such scenes.
685;Sometimes, trusting an audiences imagination is respect.
686;Instead of Chopin's immensely pretty piano concerto resounding above the ruins of Jewish Ghetto in Warsaw, we saw the beautiful Tutsi girls dancing their traditional dance in the middle of the massacre.
687;Their heads roll in that lovely curves, the radiant smiles on their face as if shone from the sky like sunlight, so lyrical and so full of joy amidst of all the chaos happening around them.
688;I also liked the fact that the script showed how Paul didn't start out as a saint and savior.
689;Human behavior, human characters, and human psychology.
690;In the middle of the ever more darkened landscape, the characters remained ordinarily human.
691;"Like ""Monster"" this movie angered me so much that I ended up loving it."
692;"Take ""Life is Beautiful,"" make it Black rather than white, make it a tragedy rather than a comedy and you have this film."
693;speaking actors did a great job.
694;African children's singing and rain give rich detail to the story being told here.
695;"given all the controversy surrounding the Simpson trial, ""Waiting to Exhale,"" and baby daddy jokes, it's finally good to see a unified Black family."
696;Devoted fathers of all races and nationalities will be touched by the dynamics of the nuclear unit featured here.
697;"this film was suspenseful
I:11409;698;Throughout this film, a radio station advocates Hutu power.
I:11409;699;It is worthy of all Oscars.
I:11409;700;very eye opening and deeply touching.
I:11409;701;i loved every minute of it and i felt truly engaged in the film.
I:11409;702;this movie teaches a great lesson in having tolerance and love for our fellow human beings.
I:11409;703;it's a pretty sad movie, but one of courage and strength.
I:11409;704;but if you've seen blood diamond, you'll love this.
I:11409;705;This is one of those movies that just anger's you and feel sadden all at once.
I:11409;706;worthy for this film and 100% convincing in his role as the Hutu Paul Rusesabagina, and Nick Nolte and le grand Jean Reno give outstanding performances in their limited screen time.
I:11409;707;born newcomer Sophie Okonedo also gives a fine performance as Cheadle's Tutsi wife.
I:11409;708;Filmed in South Africa as an international (mostly Canadian) production, the faces of the many other important supporting characters looked more than sufficiently authentic, providing a profound human backdrop to the events unfolding on the screen.
I:11409;709;The plot devices certainly owe a debt to earlier films like The Battle of Algiers, Salvador, The Killing Fields, and Schindler's List, but we should remember that this is essentially a true story.
I:11409;710;Furthermore, Hotel Rwanda's focus on one family and the strength of its bond provides an element of hope and positive feeling that brings something new and invigorating to this genre.
I:11409;711;Above all, I loved this film.
I:11409;712;Definitely a good historical lesson.
I:11409;713;I believe that Don Cheadle played a great role.
I:11409;714;In a true story, the manager of a luxury hotel in Rwanda works to save refugees and his own family during civil war in the 1990's.
I:11409;715;rusesabagina uses his connections to keep these people alive, and tries to get help for them.
I:11409;716;The movie is very touching, and it saddens me that the real Rusesabagina is not better recognized for his courage.
I:11409;717;i highly recommend this movie to all.
I:11409;718;I expect that it will be receiving a number of awards because the acting is phenomenal.
I:11409;719;This is a movie that everyone must watch.
I:11409;720;It tells the true story of what really happened in RWANDA in April 1994.
I:11409;721;Don Cheadle gives an amazing performance as do the rest of the cast.
I:11409;722;don Cheadle does a splendid job of portraying Paul Rusesabagina.
I:11409;723;The acting in general is very good.
I:11409;724;I think it captures how suddenly the slaughter began, an event that surprised many people because they felt that a peace agreement was about to take effect.
I:11409;725;for those who aren't so sure they want to see all this, I'll tell you one good thing.
I:11409;726;this is a serious and well.
I:11409;727;But if you want to learn a little about what the genocide in Rwanda was all about, this is a good choice.
I:11409;728;It is a movie that has great impact.
I:11409;729;I would agree with this reviewer who says, """"Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina as he really was during the ensuing chaos: """"an expert in situational ethics"""" doing what he morally had to do, at great risk and potential sacrifice, with an understanding that wartime negotiations are largely a game of subterfuge, cooperation, and clever bribery."""""""
730;great acting, great picture, no doubt about it.
731;It tells the true story of Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a five.
732;the film's power comes primarily from two sources.
733;The second pillar of the film is Don Cheadle's amazing performance as the hotel manager.
734;Here is an example of screen acting at its most sublime.
735;He has one particular scene, played alone, in which his character reacts after.
736;"fact to an earlier crisis
I:11409;737;It is a testament to their abilities as performers (and Cheadle's generosity as an actor) that Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, and Joaquin Phoenix are able to shine so brilliantly in their supporting roles"
738;The visuals are perfectly rendered and the soundtrack, which is so important to the film's emotional impact, is flawless.
739;The extras include two incredible documentaries, one about the making of the film, and the second about the return of the real Paul Rusesabagina to Rwanda for the first time since he and his family settled in Belgium.
740;specific commentary by Don Cheadle which is fascinating indeed.
741;"Captivating, astonishing, and both inspirational and horrifying, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a movie that should ."
742;What a touching, powerful movie!
743;It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
744;Even so, I found the brave acts of Paul Rusesabagina to be inspiring.
745;"Hotel Rwanda should have been nominated for a ""Best Picture"" Oscar!"
746;The cast is awesome, especially Don Cheadle.
747;"I hope he wins the ""Best Actor"" Oscar."
748;My sister and mother have seen this film based on my recommendation.
749;More people should go see this excellent film!
750;This movie was not only a moving tale about a true genocide that you forget about once you leave the theater.
751;This is something you will never forget, the tale of a hotel manager that helped to save 1,000 refugees.
752;This compelling tale of a Hutu that saved hundreds of people, both hutu and tutsie, by risking his life is not only moving but action packed to the very end.
753;round good movie, this is for you!!!!!!
754;Don Cheadle is excellent in this.
755;Cheadle does an excellent job and we are shown what we ignored, to our shame.
756;this is but one of a handful of important movies in the last couple of years.
757;there are award deserving performances all over the place.
758;Another is Tatiana, Paul's wife, played wonderfully by Sophie Okonedo and of course, Mr. Cheadle.
759;a skillful use of his contacts, bribes, blackmail and personal charm are used.
760;I thought it was an excellent movie, full of action, very detailed with realistic graphics of the war.
761;To be a true movie it was well acted out.
762;cheadle is excellent as Rusesabagina, a family man who turns to routine in order to survive chaos.
763;Simple routines become vines of hope, something to cling to when their world starts to crumble.
764;Cheadle approaches Rusesabagina as a simple man of honor, unassuming and willing to sacrifice himself if it means saving his family and friends.
765;He suffers through great moments of reflection, making honest but difficult decisions.
766;Hotel Rwanda effectively allows the audience to undertake Rusesabagina's journey of self.
767;When Rusesabagina's eyes are finally wide open, we are appalled at what he sees.
768;The relationship and conversations Rusesabagina shares with his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) feel genuine.
769;Okonedo is the films emotional rock, a woman who not only understands the severity of her situation, but is willing to make the ultimate sacrifice if it means her family's survival.
770;Paul and Tatiana are soul mates, two people cut from the same cloth.
771;We see what we need to see, mostly in long shots, and in one absolutely chilling moment, becoming unwitting passengers down a body.
772;nolte is powerful in one of the film's pivotal declarations, a truth met with stupefying disbelief.
773;In just a few short words, Colonel Oliver lays it all on the line, and what he has to say will leave the audience equally stunned.
774;I felt the story inside.
775;It made me feel just how delicate life is and how fortunate we are
776;If this film had been released at any other time in our history, it would still be a powerful, inspiring film.
777;don Cheadle, who plays Paul Rusesabagina, does a miraculous job.
778;He is perfectly contrite as a good hotel manager should be, his emotions well contained, and his accents perfect.
779;one of the most interesting moments in the film came when a reporter, played by Joaquin Phoenix asked two women: how can you tell the difference between a Hutu and a Tutsi?
780;He expressed surprise, as did I, for I thought the two could have been sisters.
781;this movie was uplifting, wonderfully acted, and deeply touching.
782;There are many worthy contenders this year.
783;Don Cheadle certainly deserves consideration for Best Actor, but can we honestly say that his performance was more moving and emotive than Jamie Foxx's?
784;my only point is that this movie is just as worthy of Oscar consideration as many other films released this year.
785;It will be an Oscar's ceremony that I will be interested to watch.
786;The 'hero' of this film lied during most of the story.
787;"The themes of Hotel Rwanda"" are reflected through characters."
788;His character displays a kind of emotional weight.
789;a posture, a demeanor, a way of carrying himself.
790;Cheadle's character, Paul, is a very smart man, and his reaction to the violence around him is believable, creating a sense of pathos.
791;It is that good, and more.
792;this is one of the best movies ever.
793;the sound was great and the picture was one of the best.
794;life movie of horror, and yet displaying the strength and power of the human spirit in doing the right thing.
795;Don and crew were outstanding.
796;The story has been explained in previous reviews but I recommend you watch this movie for yourself.
797;I am looking forward to visiting this beautiful place and visiting it's people.
798;Hotel Rwanda is one of the greatest and most touching films in recent years.
799;With this film, there is finally someone who shed some light over something that many people didn't know/care about and few have got the chance to hear about either.
800;With this film, the truth about what actually happened in the small African Republic of Rwanda is portraited, and all in a very realistic way that touches the watcher very emotionally.
801;this film which is also based on a true story captures exactly what the western news stations and UN armies didn't and wouldn't do.
802;Don Cheadle plays the role of his life and is truly fantastic as Paul.
803;Hotel Rwanda is also realistic, interesting and touching.
804;Hotel Rwanda is a truly original film that you will recall for a very long time forward at the same time as your knowledge of the situation in Rwanda 1994 will be much clearer.
805;I appreciate fiction that helps understand history.
806;Don Cheadle should have won the Academy Award for this .
807;it is not that I don't think Jamie Foxx did a great job, but Don Cheadle was truly amazing .
808;I sobbed for hours after the movie ended, and it really reminded me of what the world is like, and how we live in blissful ignorance.
809;cheadle's character, Paul (sp. last name) is a shining example of what human's are capable of doing, and of how brave we are capable of being.
810;So while the movie made me sad and upset about the state of the world and how little we do to help others, it also offers great hope, that more humans have the potential to be like Paul and do what is right, even if it puts them in great danger.
811;It was a great movie.
812;hard to believe people treat each other this way but they have and they will again.
813;I love Don Cheadle and he was very good in this movie.
814;This was required viewing for my son's high school history class .
815;great movie had me on the edge of me seat the hole time.
816;definitely a classic and very touching ive always loved this movie and I was so excited that I could but it for only a penny!
817;Don Cheadle gives an understated yet moving performance of a real.
818;The story is told with brutal honesty and is a demonstration of the world turning its back on a country in need.
819;Cheadle lives by his wits and charm, but is always true to those he cares about.
820;His loving relationships with his wife and children keep him anchored and always on course.
821;This is an excellent movie.
822;Good movie ,keeps u interested through the whole movie.
823;This is based on a true story and an excellent story that needs to be known.
824;After seeing HOTEL RWANDA in a local theater a few months ago, I knew I had seen something powerful and memorable.
825;i wonder if George perhaps took the easy way out.
826;george clearly has something to say with this film.
827;"It is an anger that infuses much of HOTEL RWANDA
I:11409;828;pleasing """"triumph of the human spirit"""" story when such a massive tragedy perhaps cries out for a rawer approach."""
829;"In short, I think HOTEL RWANDA suffers just a little bit from what I can only attribute to Terry George's divided intentions: he wants to tell an uplifting, ""triumph of the human spirit"" story."
830;still, George does tell a powerful story in HOTEL RWANDA, and the film, as a whole, is undeniably compelling and moving.
831;The fact that the film raises such relevant issues at all is to be admired.
832;The character of Paul Rusesabagina is, almost unbelievably, Cheadle's first lead role, and he comes through with an amazing performance.
833;In fact, I think Cheadle may have come up with the most viscerally powerful scene from the movies last year.
834;deserved Oscar on that scene alone.
835;(As impressive as Foxx undoubtedly was in RAY, not even he, in one of the final scenes set at a drug rehab center, came up with something as powerful.
836;One time was good enough for me.
837;Move came in perfect condition!
838;Another broadcast provides more in.
839;The Des Milles Collines has a skillfully diplomatic manager by the name Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), who knows what to say, what gift to offer, and how to make people feel good at all times.
840;It leads into an eye.
841;In a strong scene between Paul and Colonel Oliver, Colonel Olivier describes for him how little this nation is worth to the Western World.
842;Poignantly genuine is the character that Don Cheadle presents, as he depicts a very humane person who realizes that he must use his powers to survive while trying to save as many as he can.
843;The film's success rests within Cheadle's brilliant performance, which is highlighted by the talented cast that surrounds him such as Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, and Hakeem Kae.
844;It could not be considered a wonderful film due to its grotesque nature, but it is an important film that should be seen.
845;He ends up becoming a true hero.
846;the story focuses solely on Paul and the dilemeas he faces in keeping those in his hotel alive.
847;This movie shows that he is one of the greatest actors in Hollywood.
848;This movie will make you want to change the world.
849;well worth it's pricetag and definately a movie to own!
850;Because its a great movie c:& I enjoyed it (: I would recommend it for people who like war movies to watch it c:
851;A very moving, revealing event of today's recent history of troubled times .
852;this movie brought it home to my heart.
853;This movie is the entire reason I have an interest in African politics now.
854;It is a really worthwhile film!
855;This was a very good movie.
856;My mother had seen this movie before and said it was good.
857;As an American I was deeply moved and saddened that we did not do more for those people.
858;I highly recommend this movie.
859;The acting and portrayal of these heroic people deserves to be seen.
860;It was wonderful to see this movie which was from the prospective of a family that was affected.
861;Hotel Rwanda is powerful and brilliant!
862;Don Cheadle's performance is powerful, mesmerizing, and brilliant, one of his best performances to date, thus far!
863;Terry George's directing is excellent!
864;The screenplay by George and Keir Pearson is excellent!
865;This is one of last year's best!
866;The movie Hotel Rwanda is an excellent portrayal of the absolute devastation that took place.
867;Don Cheadle gives an astonishing portrayal of Paul Rusesagagina a savior for thousands caught up in the madness occurring right outside the gates of the Hotel Mille Collines.
868;When the world closed its eyes, he opened his arms, a tagline that fits oh so well into the heartfelt movie that puts you right into the conflict.
869;Don Cheadle gives a performance of a lifetime in this movie.
870;I say that a really good movie can make you tear up, and I was tearing up during this movie.
871;terry George has directed a fabulous film.
872;Everything is woven together wonderfully.
873;This movie never turns to melodrama and has a documentary type feel to it.
874;Like United 93(another great movie)it draws you in and you know what is going to happen, but when it does you still find yourself in tears.
875;That is what great movies do.
876;The movie is amazing, BUT it also gives you a sense of anger at the US and all the big powers, I love the line Nick Nolte uses after he finds out they are only evacuating the whites.
877;Watch this film, it will give you a much better understanding of what happened in 1994.
878;But it is more of a Hollywood that real life production.
879;Because it's a Hollywood production, that's why.
880;This movie was riveting from beginning to end, but to realize that this was a true family who are now living in Belgium is amazing.
881;Don Cheadle as Paul Ruseasabagina is simply amazing.
882;Hotel Rwanda is a true story, and even though we know going in that Ruseasabagina is going to save over a thousand refugees this is still a harrowing story.
883;Ruseasabagina is literally the right person in the right place, because only the hotel could have become a refuge for the Tutsi and only the manager of a five.
884;Cheadle's performance, deservedly nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, is appropriately controlled just as Ruseasabagina had to be in persuading these thugs to help him.
885;"Those who watch ""Hotel Rwanda"" will find themselves counted among that final number and should well remember that even if they were oblivious to what happened in Rwanda history will repeat itself is this regard and give us another chance to do the right thing."
886;during this time of great turmoil, fear, and slaughter, an oasis existed in the capital city of Kigali.
887;this is a brilliant film, deftly directed by Terry George, who keeps the carnage and gore to a minimum.
888;Yet, he manages with just a few well.
889;Don Cheadle gives an amazing performance, low.
890;"keyed, controlled
I:11409;891;The rest of the supporting cast also give stellar performances.
I:11409;892;this is a brilliantly acted, well.
I:11409;893;directed film that deserves a place in one's personal collection.
I:11409;894;Don Cheadle continues to amaze.
I:11409;895;This reality story can't fail to move you and is informative as well as enlightening, especially if you aren't already familiar with the events.
I:11409;896;I've got a real hero for you: Paul Rusesabagina.
I:11409;897;he knows where to find and get the best of everything for his guests.
I:11409;898;He is smooth, poised, and well.
I:11409;899;paul is a Hutu but his wife is Tutsi and so are many of his friends, neighbors, employees and relatives.
I:11409;900;the acting, direction, and script are all excellent.
I:11409;901;It will move you and give you perspective.
I:11409;902;All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is something else)!
I:11409;903;Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide important insight not to mention more than a few tears.
I:11409;904;more relevant than ever, the movie does a great job as an eye.
I:11409;905;The film provides the necessary background as well as an accurate description of conditions on the ground during the few months that the conflict lasted.
I:11409;906;similarly to movies like The Lord of War, The Last King of Scotland, and Blood Diamond to name a few, Hotel Rwanda draws attention to some pretty important issues facing Africa.
I:11409;907;Very compelling movie"
908;And I hoped that somehow, this knowledge might change something.
909;It is simply the true story of one courageous man who helped save more than a thousand people.
910;And, for this reason it is a fine film because I know it was viewed by millions of people, some of whom had never even heard of the country itself.
911;don Cheadle is superb in the lead role.
912;He manages his luxury hotel with sophisticated understanding of human nature and the power of bribes and flattery.
913;How he saves them, as well as all the other people, is a story of courage.
914;He's a fine actor, and he shows complex emotions.
915;His performance was fine, as usual.
916;And I also came away with a real appreciation of Don Cheadle's acting skill.
917;A movie every person should see.
918;while Hotel Rwanda reveals the events of the genocide that occurred in the spring of 1994, it's really a moving testament to the compassion of one person, Mr. Rusesabagina.
919;Just after he's ousted from his home along with his family and a few neighbors, he is given the opportunity to make good with the Hutu killers and free himself but have his loved ones shot.
920;"Someone suggested this is a ""Schindler's List"" of Rwanda."
921;"I disagree
I:11409;922;hotel Rwanda almost succeeds in maintaining a degree of sobriety, and a mood of factuality in the dramatic events.
I:11409;923;and this is its strength and its originality.
I:11409;924;And to give another example.
I:11409;925;A disturbingly true story that will immerse you in the terror of genocide.
I:11409;926;Very well acted and directed.
I:11409;927;Don Cheadle is superb in the lead role.
I:11409;928;Analysing these events makes us feel better, removes us from the emotions of such a tragedy.
I:11409;929;Hotel Rwanda is an edge.
I:11409;930;of.your seat true account of the courage of one man in the midst of cowardice of many.
I:11409;931;accomplished actor Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, assistant manager of a four.
I:11409;932;the movie is stellar on all counts.
I:11409;933;It strikes at your heart, gently takes your face, and makes you look in the mirror.
I:11409;934;A well done movie that gives you a snapshot of events in Rwanda during the genocide that occurred there.
I:11409;935;It was necessary to make this movie so the world does not forget and I encourage you to watch.
I:11409;936;one line sums up the attitue of the world leaders and UN at the time.
I:11409;937;Reminds me of the movie Schindler's List.
I:11409;938;Made me shed tears watching it.
I:11409;939;Great visual and emotional background, but not for the faint.
I:11409;940;don Cheadle did a wonderful job as a moral man in a very immoral position.
I:11409;941;He was well supported by Sophie Okonedo who played his wife and also earned a nomination for best supporting actress.
I:11409;942;There are genuine chemisty between the two and their relationship create the foundation for why Don Cheadle's character did what he did.
I:11409;943;In simple terms, the film worked because Cheadle's character was believable despite of the fact that this movie was based on a true story.
I:11409;944;But casual ease that these Africans slaughtered each other may surprised many people.
I:11409;945;Only Don Cheadle's character was totally fresh out and thanks to the great work by that actor, Paul Rusesabagina came alive.
I:11409;946;this movie is a pretty decent film but only because the two lead actors were so good.
I:11409;947;Hard to believe it is a true movie.
I:11409;948;But I recommend people to watch it, for their own sakes on educating themselves on one of the most ignored genocides in recent history.
I:11409;949;It isn't just a story of death, it is a strong story of love and family, and of country.
I:11409;950;It is enlightening and I believe everyone must see it to educate themselves on this tragedy.
I:11409;951;the story itself is powerful, but so are the characters.
I:11409;952;I reccomend everyone, who has a conscience, see this movie.
I:11409;953;mannered hotel manager and Hutu, manages to save the lives of thousands of Tutsis, including his Tutsi wife and children, by hiding them in his five.
I:11409;954;interest, suggests a higher principle: sometimes altruism can be powerful.
I:11409;955;Everything about this movie is amazing.
I:11409;956;I showed it to my high school students since we were studying geocide and they got completely caught up in it.
I:11409;957;I saw Immaculee speak and it was a powerful and inspiring talk.
I:11409;958;If you liked the movie, you must read this book!!
I:11409;959;This incredible movie makes you feel as if you are actually in the middle of the violence.
I:11409;960;You are absolutely terrified and helpless the entire time, and your heart shatters into a million pieces as you watch the injustice of genocide made very real and very personal.
I:11409;961;, amazing plot and cinematography with believable story line
I:11409;962;don Chedle is excellent and gives a five star performance, but the rest of the characters are wooden stereotypes.you can almost anticipate what their next line will be.
I:11409;963;Such great acting,"
964;The entire cast, with the exception of Nick Nottle, play their roles to the hilt.
965;see movie and feel compassion for those who endured this unbelieveable event.
966;When we first meet him, Paul is the very model of the modern toady.
967;He courts foreigners, pays off black.
968;He is driven by a primal need to save his own family, but as the slaughter continues, more and more friends and neighbors beg him for help.
969;It's all true and, given the context, remarkably subtle.
970;"The triumph comes tempered by the greater tragedy.You might call ""Hotel Rwanda"" the feel."
971;It is so ironic how, in a world of omni.
972;Hotel Rwanda is a deeply moving and inspiring film, especially since it shows how challenging it can be to do what is right.
973;But it was a great movie anyway!
974;It is sad that more than ten years later, we still will only sit still to hear the tale of those with a happy ending.
975;i tremble for the day that the signal may be called for my children.
976;the acting of all main actors: Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, and Nick Nolte was so skillful that at times throughout the movie, it felt like I was watching a documentary up close and personal.
977;The directing, script, and cinematography were excellent.
978;Everyone else has covered the content of this excellent movie.
979;let me just add, this is a powerful story of how one person can make a difference.
980;another great lesson: Subservience can be power.
981;A good loyal servant is owed some level of support.
982;Rusesabagina's loyal service to Sabena demands a level of support.
983;A great lesson in where power actually resides (sometimes in ourselves, not in the authority figures).
984;The film is efficient in its story.
985;The Belgians gave a measure of power to the small amount of Tutsi's, and after Belgium leaves the tensions escalate.
986;Don Cheadle is the heart and soul of this movie, and we are amazed as we watch him save 1,200 lives by bribing, pleading, outsmarting and standing up to the murderous forces that come to the Mille Collines.
987;At one point he is quite certain that the hotel is about to be over.
988;run and everyone inside murdered.
989;He is incredibly calm as he phones the Belgian headquarters of his hotel company (a brief, but effective cameo by the wonderful Jean Reno) and thanks the company for what they have done, then informs him that they are about to all be killed.
990;"nick Nolte brings the right combination of fear and fearlessness to the role of the Canadian Colonel representing the United Nations, leading a tiny force of UN ""peacekeepers, not peacemakers"" ."
991;The accompanying documentaries are enlightening showing the real Paul Rusesabagina, and we get a sense that the heroism shown in the movie is no exaggeration.
992;Based upon a true tragedy, this movie speaks volumes about the depravity and is a stark portrayal of exactly why optimistic humanism has never lived upon to its promises.
993;this film brings out some stark realities in international relations and intervention.
994;don Cheadle does a fantastic job in portraying the main character.
995;It is a great film that will make me understand the horror of genocide.
996;This is a must see movie.
997;My husband and I will watch it again.
998;Amazing story of courage, suffering, and persevering.
999;The compassion and love this man had for his family and his fellowmen.
1000;I love stories based on true happenings.
1001;What a brave man he was.
1002;Hotel Rwanda is one of the most powerful movies of recent times.
1003;He managed to save them all.
1004;A Rwandan himself, he was able to do this because he knew the ins and outs of the corrupt local politics.
1005;The amazing thing about this movie is how powerful it is without becoming gruesome.
1006;I think it's one of those movies that has a strong potential to become a classic.
1007;This film fully captures without showing a fraction of the violence, of the tension of living during these times.
1008;An extraordinary cast, well directed, absolutely amazing achievement.
1009;None the less, a great story of modern day heroes!
1010;A historically based film that expands on the cruel nature of humanity.
1011;A compelling and well written movie.
1012;this shocking yet amazing tale of paul rusesabagina's courage is uttertly astonishing.
1013;this is an unforgettable must see movie that will move you like few films have the power to do.
1014;The director also takes a few other missteps as well.
1015;but despite the issues I addressed above, Hotel Rwanda is an important movie.
1016;This is a powerful and moving story that easily overcomes its occasionally incompetent directing.
1017;Don Cheadle delivers an emotionally charged yet properly subdued performance wholly worthy of recognition.
1018;There are a couple heart.
1019;This film rightfully celebrates the immeasurable heroism of Paul Rusesabagina, and serves as a heartfelt warning against ethical complacency.
1020;Don is a great actor!
1021;I was sad while watching, but so happy on the end.
1022;It brought tears to my eyes.
1023;I watch this movie often.
1024;watching this movie is quite striking, as it is based on a true story.
1025;You can learn about all that in this outstanding movie, directed by Terry George.
1026;all in all, I highly recommend this film.
1027;Hotel Rwanda can do it, and I think that is a reason more than good enough to watch this film.
1028;Some of the scenes were very stark and gripping, with quite a few tear.
1029;Cheadle does a great job.
1030;He speaks well with an accent, and he is very convincing when everything falls apart around him.
1031;When he speaks to the staff at the hotel about calling loved ones, you feel like he means what he says.
1032;Moreso, she is always crying about something.
1033;i previously watched this movie in my 7th period holocaust class because of the subject of genocide and it absolutely blew my mind!
1034;Excellent to rexeperienxe this film during the 20th anniversary.
1035;As always, Don Cheadle gave a moving appearance.
1036;It was so moving .
1037;I cried my heart out.
1038;Its one of those must see movies and it makes you open your heart and your mind to the rest of the world.
1039;"I also recommend the movie ""Yesterday."""
1040;This is one of the best films I've ever seen.
1041;Don Cheadle is superb as Paul Rusesabagina and this important story is something that you'll remember and want to talk about.
1042;"I came into watching ""Hotel Rwanda"" without previously forged opinions (although I had heard other opinions ranging from overly positive to negative) and I found that its power comes from its subtlety of delivery ."
1043;important proclamations from the central character and most importantly, it doesn't marginalize who's the obvious lead character in this story as Hollywood so often does.
1044;but that aside, this is one of the most solid, deeply moving movies I've seen in a long time.
1045;key performances by the actors, and primarily that of lead Don Cheadle who turns subtlety and straightforwardness into strength and passion.
1046;And what we have here is arguably the most gripping and deep.
1047;"screen movie since ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but what puts this one higher on the heartfelt meter is that it's a true story."
1048;and arguably its most powerful scene features only Don Cheadle .
1049;He truly did what he did out of his conscience .
1050;Hotel Rwanda is a difficult movie to review because the intentions of all concerned (director, actors, screenwriter) are obviously deeply heartfelt and thoughtful.
1051;"Think about the hand held camerawork and use of color in Oliver Stone's ""Salvador."""
1052;but, and this is a big BUT: there is the courageous performance of Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina, a Hotel manager who becomes the savior, through cagey.
1053;Hotel Rwanda is not a great movie but it is an important one for it tells a story that everyone everywhere needs to know, understand and digest.
1054;this powerful, intense and true story hits you hard.
1055;it hits you at the core.
1056;A flawless performance by Cheadle giving him his best.
1057;I recommend this movie highly and when I mean highly.
1058;A masterpiece and one of 2004's best.
1059;The fact that it is a true to life picture, great acting and sheds light about what I only heard about in the news .
1060;My whole family watched and was riveted to the screen.
1061;Worth a watch if you want to see what happened in Rwanda.
1062;Don Cheadle delivers an inspired performance as the hotel owner with a heart.
1063;I very much fear that my generation with their Facebook and You Tube's will just allow the world that stands before us to slip further into blackness allowing the genociders and terrorizes of the world to claim victory over an apathetic mass of good men that did nothing.
1064;Hopefully this movie will change a few minds.
1065;very compelling story, with an excellent portrayal by the cast of some very poignant characters.
1066;I would highly recommend this movie.
1067;don Cheadle has been giving solid performances in smaller roles for years now, establishing himself as a great actor.
1068;Hotel Rwanda is his chance to really break through.
1069;He brings tru humanity to a man who does not want to be in the position that he is in.
1070;His struggle to help more than his family is difficult, and Cheadle conveys the difficulty with the grace of a great actor.
1071;"And the fact that one man could take his ""safe"" life in his own hands to save as many as he could is inspiring."
1072;Hotel Rwanda is about the choices we make as individuals and as countries to do what is right.
1073;This is an excellent film that should be seen by all.
1074;This movie is a good one for opening western eyes to what happens in other countries specifically Africa.
1075;This is a must see for all.
1076;Fortunately, his efforts were largely successful as many of the people he took in survived.
1077;the film is marvelous in many ways.
1078;The acting and directing is superb and it seems no expense was spared in this film's production.
1079;I think Terry George was right to pick Don Cheadle for the role of Paul Rusesabagina and he, as well as the other cast members, did an excellent job with their parts.
1080;the whole film is a gut.
1081;There are many well written reviews of this movie that explain the plot in great detail, so I will not rehash all that.
1082;I will lend my agreement that the acting was great all around, and the story was one that most in the United States would probably never hear otherwise.
1083;It is definitely a movie worth seeing.
1084;The film is superbly acted down to the smallest bit part, but special mention must be made of Cheadle, who gives a performance of heartbreaking intensity and purity as Rusesabagina, and Sophie Okonedo, who is deeply moving as Rusesabagina's wife Tatiana.
1085;This powerful film is a stern rebuke to us comfortable Westerners, who.
1086;"While I found the book ""An Ordinary Man"" somewhat boring and slow, the movie adaptation is, for lack of a better word, extraordinary."
1087;Don Cheadle gives an astounding performance as Paul Rusesabagina, who is the manager of the Mille Collines hotel.
1088;Like others have noted, one of the best aspects of this film is that it ends with hope, unlike other depressing true stories of genocide.
1089;Don Cheadle was absolutely amazing in this role.
1090;Balanced story with emphasis on loyalty to employees and love of family.
1091;Great resource for World History on the topic of genocide.
1092;I have used this movie in my classes to illustrate the conflict between rival tribes and it is by far a great film.
1093;The acting was excellent, the imagery was powerful, and even the special features will move you.
1094;I got to watch this film recently&it truly just got at me very early on.
1095;it was said seeing what Power&force can do to a whole place.
1096;the whole Cast was truly in tune with the task at hand.
1097;a Must see film&this film should be taught at all schools.
1098;The characters name is Paul Rusesabagina (played by Don Cheadle), a man who really existed (and still does), and did become more then a hero for those who were protected in the hotel.
1099;This is that story, and I assure you is quite good.
1100;with so many great film aspects too because the acting itself was quite superb, and recognized as many were nominated for Oscars.
1101;What an amazing movie and story.
1102;Don Cheadle is excellent in his portrayal of the courageous hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina.
1103;the bonus features introduce the real Paul Rusesabagina.
1104;a flawless feature, and a great lesson of humanity.
1105;Well worth any moviegoer's time, and moviegoers' taking action.
1106;This movie should have won the Oscar for best movie in 2004, hands down.
1107;Hotel Rwanda succeeds in everything it does, the acting is incredible, and the movie leaves you drained and depressed.
1108;It is a beautiful country and the people are amazing.
1109;I Love to watch true stories and this movie portrayed true events that really happened.
1110;Our fellows die because of war and malnutrition and we gree for more money and more wealth!Don Cheadle(Paul Rusesabagina)is a brilliant actor with his unblievably close.
1111;real rwanadan accent and I love Sophie Okonedo(Tatiana), she is a fantastic actress with mesmerizing emotions!
1112;It is excellent and gave me another look at this horrible situation.
1113;I was completely engrossed in the story and characters.
1114;A well made film that probably hasn't gotten the attention it deserves.
1115;Great acting, touching, historical, true story.
1116;It is completely inaccurate in the locations and in the manner it depicts the actors of the genocide.
1117;Man's inhumanity is portrayed with stunning reality.
1118;Great performances that make the story very authentic and gut.
1119;It is such a compelling story and the movie is done in amazingly good taste to allow viewing as PG.13 without losing any impact.
1120;I like the fact that it was a true story and it helps me remember the blessing we have and take for granted.
1121;This is a great movie, there is no doubt about it.
1122;Don Cheadle turns out his best performance ever and its great to see that a lot of research obviously went into this film from the actors, the writers and the director.
1123;the movie stays very true to detail, and it is so inspiring to witness the courage of one man, who is almost like a modern day jesus christ.
1124;This will definitely leave an effect on everyone who watches it and make you appreciate everything you have in your life.
1125;the special features are very good too, featuring a 30min documentary of the making of the movie which is entertaining and informative and the commentary is very interesting indeed.
1126;i strongly recomend this movie to not only fans of war and history movies but to anyone who likes a good drama.
1127;another highlight is the performance of sophie onokedo, who is actually British, but is exceptional as the female lead, the wife of the hotel manager.
1128;This is a powerful movie that shows a true account of what happened during the Rwandan Genocide.
1129;don Cheadle's performance is stunning!
1130;This film is an exceptional presentation of the issues surrounding genocide in Africa.
1131;This film helps illustrate how those divisions can be exploited to disrupt normal social relationships and bring down civil society.
1132;Excellent film about the wonders of human nature as well as the tragedies of our race.
1133;I don't write many reviews, but I felt compelled to do so after seeing this film.
1134;what a masterful job Terry George has done in portraying the horror of life in Rwanda in 1994.
1135;The intense dread is developed because Paul and people inside the hotel know that the noose is slowly drawing tighter, and that certainly sooner or later they will all have run out of options.
1136;don Cheadle easily should have won the Oscar for this portrayal.
1137;it was powerful because it was so understated.
1138;a fantastic, though horribly sad film.
1139;Because we ignored the problem and allowed the massacre of nearly a million lives, it is important to have books and movies speak out about this crisis.
1140;don Cheadle is amazing in this film, as he nails the accent perfectly.
1141;Films like these are important to bring about awareness, but in the end, its really a calling to us, daring us to take action in whatever way we can.
1142;See this film and may it fill you with a hope to act out whenever injustice rears its ugly head, in whatever form it takes.
1143;Everyone should see this movie .
1144;Great acting and very eye opening movie, however I knew some of the history of the country and the issues, I did not know of this particular story.
1145;This is a great story about tremendous courage and sorrow.
1146;and quite honestly I don't know.
1147;The writers and director of this movie performed an excellent job in telling this story and I highly recommend it.
1148;Watch this movie and learn how to be a beautiful human being.
1149;excellent moving, spell binding ,I really enjoyed this movie such a great story ,very moving.
1150;Hotel Rwanda illuminated the impact of one person who chooses to do what is right.
1151;There is a much more incendiary story to tell here.
1152;The Bottom Line:Hotel Rwanda is by no means a perfect film.
1153;the ending is so blindingly happy it's as if the filmmakers forgot about the genocide.
1154;made, has moments of power, and is a noble attempt to shed light on a terrible moment in recent human history.
1155;This movie shows us how one person can make a difference.
1156;She loved it and so do I. the movie is well done.
1157;But it is a film that every voting adult should see.
1158;excellent performances by all actors.
1159;A brilliant, beautiful, heartbreaking movie.
1160;Don Cheadle should have won the Oscar.
1161;This is the best film I've seen in a long time.
1162;Very sobering look at the reality of prejudice in the country.
1163;Well acted and beautifully filmed, it was a good addition to my movie library.
1164;great story and acting by all cast members.
1165;Hotel Rwanda is a wonderfully directed movie.
1166;Cheadle's performance is truely remarkable.
1167;Compelling but harrowing and a must.
1168;This true story film is an inspiring and noble piece of filmmaking.
1169;It documents how the human spirit is not destroyed even in the worst of moments, so long as it hangs on to courage calm and a sense of unabashed human respect, and even a sense of refined style which the hero of this important history, Paul Rusesabagina, displays.
1170;This is a compelling movie.
1171;serving comfort and affluence succinctly summarized by the news photographer in an early scene of the movie.
1172;The story is, however, more than that of brutality and civil war.
1173;It is the story of the love of a man for his family, and the response of one courageous individual who stands against the tide of atrocity.
1174;that is worthwhile, as well as a filming of the hero of the movie when he returned to Rwanda after several years in Belgium.
1175;"The idea of the UN presence as a ""peacekeeping force"" is revealed for what it is."
1176;I watched this movie today and it kept me so interested in it that the time seemed to fly by.
1177;To know that the character played by Don Cheadle lived through this and saved so many peoples lives was awe inspiring.
1178;So many times we see every day people doing extroadinary things, as in this movie.
1179;Don Cheadle was wonderful in the movie.
1180;The strength that he brought to the roll made you feel that you were living the atrocities right along with him.
1181;As good as this movie was it was not an easy one to watch.
1182;This is a movie that will make you question humanity, and how some people step up to the plate, answer the call and become reluctant heroes while others take lives, just for their own pure enjoyment.
1183;Don Cheadle was most definately robbed at the academy awards though, he was spectacular!
1184;A very real and honest portrayal of the Rwanda genocide from a personal perspective.
1185;it will break your heart.
1186;His quiet gravita carries the weight and he deservedly wins an Oscar's nomination for it.
1187;Not a pleasant movie to watch, but since it is based on a true situation, it is well worth watching.
1188;I can't really come up with adequate adjectives.
1189;from the initial depiction of civilized, stable Rwanda to the ending credits, this movie is gripping and eerily reminiscent of past tragedies (like the Holocaust).
1190;But this is now, or very close to it.
1191;i have never been so touched by a movie before.
1192;They may entertain you for two hours.
1193;It is an intense experience.
1194;It is very done and, from what I understand, historically accurate.
1195;It was interesting to see how these events still happen even in the very recent past.
1196;Very intense and very thought provoking.
1197;This movie was absolutely excellent!
1198;Every other performance, particularly by Nick Nolte and Sophie Okonedo is well done as well.
1199;The main focus is on Rusesabagina and his efforts to save lives but the references to the slaughter and carnage on the outside are still more than enough to get a sense of the horrific atrocities taking place and it's still very powerful.
1200;"I have tested my internet connection, scanned pc, etc
I:11409;1201;the movie itself had some outstanding acting, particularly from Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo.
I:11409;1202;Hotel Rwanda is a fairly absorbing movie about the massacre in Rwanda/Burundi in 1994.
I:11409;1203;this is a very good movie about one man's heroic efforts to protect roughly 1200 people who otherwise would probably have been killed.
I:11409;1204;I found the suspense, frustration and fear to be very well developed in """"Hotel Rwanda""""."""
1205;this is a very good movie and one I would readily encourage others to watch.
1206;"I did not think, however, that is is a ""great"" movie."
1207;This is a very well directed film pertaining to a true story of genocide in Rwanda.
1208;The rest of the World should be ashamed.
1209;An African life has little value, in the eyes of the super powers.
1210;Very good movie, keeps you interested and not filled with bad languge.
1211;very realistic and hard to watch at times.
1212;and that was my typically American response to such a great and humbling movie.
1213;i cried more than once in this movie.
1214;This has got to be one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
1215;I am not really a big movie watcher and most of the movies that I do watch are mainstream movies.
1216;A friend took me to see Hotel Rwanda and I was just totally stunned by the emotions in generated inside of me.
1217;It was a great movie.
1218;Recomended for everyone!Just a very well done movie!The acting from all of cast was excellent and kept you on edge.
1219;everyone including children should view this masterpiece of a film.
1220;This film tells it like it is and believe me you will appreciate your freedom all the more.
1221;We can all thank GOD (Jehovah) for living in this wonderful country inspite of it's political views.
1222;This is a movie that is unforgettable in it's accurate portrayal of human brutality.
1223;The film is incredibly well written, well acted and the scenes are frighteningly realistic.
1224;Don Cheadle is superb as the heroic hotel manager who more than rises to the occassion using his wits to keep his family and hundreds of others safe in the midst of chaos.
1225;He surely deserves great recognition for this role.
1226;The film does much to illuminate and educate.
1227;what an eye opening, gripping, heartfelt film!!!
1228;Paul Rusesabagina was portrayed to perfection by Don Cheadle, rapidly becoming one of our greatest actors.
1229;Both earned well deserved Academy Award nominations.
1230;But everything about this film is done to perfection.
1231;One of the best arguments against Intolerance.
1232;And yet, it seldom even made front.
1233;hOTEL RWANDA is a handsomely made film, and it is VERY well acted.
1234;Don Cheadle is particularly fine in the role that finally got him some attention at awards time.
1235;He is so underrated, because he's so effortless.
1236;Sophie Okonedo, as his wife, is radiant.
1237;I sure hope to see her in more movies in the near future.
1238;The story of this man and wife (he is in a management position at a luxury hotel in Rwanda and finds himself not only taking in refugees who are doomed to be killed otherwise, but risking his own life to save them) is riveting as far as it goes.
1239;We absolutely admire the risks they all took.
1240;cheadle in particular shows great amounts of courage shining through knee.
1241;i'm simply saying that his courage is almost casual.
1242;This was in great part because Spielberg set out to slap us in the face with a visceral reminder of that the people who lived those events went through (and the people who didn't survive).
1243;I found the story fascinating and engaging.
1244;The scene where the couple agree that they will commit suicide with their children if the rebels come (and later, when Cheadle thinks they may have mistakenly carried out their pact) will put a lump in your throat, and move you to the edge of your seat.
1245;by all means, see this fine movie.
1246;so brilliantly and unforgettably acted, it leaves one totally breathless and completely moved as well as drained!
1247;it is an instant classic with the always great don cheadle delivering still another great performance.
1248;The movie is marked by a number of fine, understated minor performances, including small turns from Joaquin Phoenix and Jean Reno, as well as excellent work from Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo (as Rusesabagina's wife), and, somewhat surprisingly, Nick Nolte, whose career has really taken an upswing since Affliction.
1249;His character stays believable even when everything else about him has entered the realm of the ludicrous.
1250;but the closest one could come is:Utterly amazing.
1251;This movie is a must see for the content and follow up information that can be shared.
1252;In addition to showing this movie we showed our students other videos from interviews with people who survived this atrocity.
1253;Every now and then a movie comes along whose subject matter is so important that the art of the film is almost irrelevant.
1254;cheadle is magnificent as the clever, calm, quick thinking, heroic but never larger.
1255;Sophie Okoneda and Nick Nolte co. star in this unforgettable film.
1256;"Superior extras include ""Return to Rwanda"" and a commentary with the real life Paul Rusesabagina"
1257;It's based on a true event, about Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu who worked at four star hotel in Kigali.
1258;Don Cheadle was excellent as an ordinary man forced to do extra.
1259;Paul Rusesabagina and his family came to see the movie and he received a five minute standing ovation.
1260;This is a very important, poignant film that is well done.
1261;It is the story of courage, daring and resourcefulness by a hotel manager who keeps his cool while all about him are loosing theirs .
1262;Such a heart wrenching story.
1263;No matter how many times I have seen Hotel Rwanda it always draws me in from the beginning to end.
1264;It is amazing how much emotion and how real this movie is.
1265;It definitely shows how brilliant and evil people can be.
1266;"unlike many contemporary movies which draw upon the label ""based on a true story"" and feature many embellishments, the movie remains remarkably free from dramatic flourishes or moral sermonising."
1267;"The soundtrack is equally brilliant
I:11409;1268;truly memorable and touching, Hotel Rwanda provides an insight into the traditional and contemporary attitude of the West towards Africans.
I:11409;1269;This is perfectly captured in two particular statements: one by Jack (Joaquin Phoenix) and the other by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte).
I:11409;1270;It also triumphs the role of the individual"
1271;It's was one of the most moving stories about Africa that I have seen.
1272;I found it fascinating as well as horrifying.
1273;I've shared this movie with friends.
1274;The movie held my interest.
1275;I find that is true of a lot of movies.
1276;This is one of the best movies in the world.
1277;hound, I've long enjoyed watching historically.
1278;based films that help bring a sense of truth and reality to our concepts of history.
1279;the scariest thing is that, in the right circumstances, those in Rwanda could be anyone of us.
1280;This is just one example of what man can do to fellow man.
1281;this movie was one of the best i have seen in a long time.
1282;the acting was amazing, the story so sad and heartwrenching.
1283;i reccommend it to anyone and everyone.
1284;while Million Dollar Baby was an outstanding and beautiful film and well earned its Academy Award for Best Picture,I can't believe that it got the award over Hotel Rwanda.
1285;"this movie is as inspiring as such greats as ""Ghandi"",as powerful as ""Ordinary People"",as heartwarming as ""Life is Beautiful."
1286;It is a story of the human spirit at its strongest,of fighting the loosing battle,of living when all you want to do is lay down and die.
1287;Hotel Rwanda is the true story of one man, hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina, who managed to harbor 1,268 refugees inside the upscale hotel he managed until he could find a way to bring them all to safety behind the Tutsi rebel lines.
1288;Not since Shindler's List have I seen a movie with this much power and courage, enough to make even this cold.
1289;the cast in Hotel Rwanda was incredible, with stellar performances by Don Cheadle playing Paul Rusesabagina, Sophie Okonedo playing Tatiana Rusesabagina, Desmond Dube playing Dube, Fana Mokoena playing General Bizimungu, and Joaquin Phoenix playing reporter Jack Daglish.
1290;if there is one movie that everyone should see, it is this one.
1291;I gave this as a gift.
1292;They were very pleased as they had been to Africa that year and said it depicted some of the areas they travelled.
1293;The movie is both heart felt and moving.
1294;Overall its a great movie and I would recommend it thoroughly.
1295;But in the end, this is still a very effective movie with an outstanding performance from the always under.
1296;rated Don Cheadle in an Oscar nominated performance.
1297;paul Rusesabagina is played by Don Cheadle, and he does a tremendous job.
1298;The acting is impressive all the way around, as is the cinematography and the direction.
1299;in the end, you have to consider this an important film because it shines a light on a tragedy that might have been avoided if more people were paying attention.
1300;I was touched by the story and the courage of Paul Rusesabagina.
1301;in college I remember watching movies about South Africa including Cry Freedom and A Dry White season.
1302;Sir Richard Attenborough's film was designed to spur the west into action and was both moving and original.
1303;"The most chilling and powerful moments of the film was at the the end of the movie
I:11409;1304;As a filmmaker he hit you hardest at that moment with music and facts, no actors, dialogue or special effects"
1305;Hotel Rwanda shifts the focus and this adds a fresh perspective.
1306;rwandans are the focus of the story they are the emotional center of this movie and portrayed as complex human beings.
1307;Paul Rusesabagina is shown as an intelligent resourceful kind and compassionate person who acts to save people during the Rwandan genocide.
1308;Mistrust can make people do funny things.
1309;I could care less about an award, the meaning of the movie should be held at the top of the ladder regardless.
1310;He is driven by a primal need to save his own family, but as the slaughter continues, more and more friends and neighbors beg him for help.
1311;It's all true and, given the context, remarkably subtle.
1312;The triumph comes tempered by the greater tragedy.
1313;correct Oscar hopeful related to a civil war in an African country.
1314;One man, a hotel manager in a four star hotel in the middle of the riot.
1315;torn city, must take it upon himself to save the lives of as many people as can be packed into his premises, much to the chagrin of savage rioteers.
1316;a throbbing game of cat and mouse ensues.
1317;The film is finely edited and moves along at a rapid clip as we see sacrifice, grace under fire, valor, love, even an occasional tranche of timely well.
1318;What a truly humbling masterpiece.
1319;This was a terrific movie, if hard to watch at many moments, about the horrific slaughter in Rwanda that the West turned a blind eye to.
1320;Don Cheadle inhabits the lead role with quiet dignity and absolutely no scenery.
1321;chewing, which I find quite remarkable, given the intensity of the story.
1322;Watch this movie and think about how we have the responsibility to hold our leaders accountable when they walk away from violence, unrest and chaos that they create in another country thousands of miles away.
1323;Inspiring story of survival, great actors!
1324;I was enlightened by what really took place.
1325;A range of techniques bring the conflict to life, in an almost documentary style.
1326;This movie is a testament to the power of film to relate the agonies of the human condition and to touch us with them.
1327;It tells a gripping story that is both powerful and true.
1328;You end up thinking deeply about the value of human life and the impact of human action (and inaction).
1329;We are well aware of the holocaust of World War II because it is well documented in literature and it continues to haunt our moral conscience.
1330;don Cheadle did an amazing job portraying Paul Rusesabagina's character.
1331;The movie was very well done from a director's standpoint.
1332;With a movie covering a catastrophe of this scope it's easy to think of how much more could have been crammed into the movie but by focusing on one person's struggles it gives us an orientation and a perspective.
1333;you will also emerge a better person.
1334;Moreover, please recommend it to your friends and help them become better people.
1335;What a powerfuly well done movie to tell the story of people and the country that were ignored.
1336;thank you for producing such a powerful film.
1337;Don Cheadle did an amazing job bringing this story to life.
1338;There's drama, suspense, love, and wrenching heartache, then a bittersweet victory.
1339;I recommend this movie to anyone .
1340;Don Cheadle deserved the Oscar for his amazing performance.
1341;Don Cheadle who plays hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina delivers an outstanding and heartwarming performance.
1342;This is truly a inspirational film.
1343;We see a dedicated man go to great lengths to save his people and try to put an end to the violence.
1344;There are many touching and heartbreaking scenes in this movie but knowing that this is a true story, it makes this film even more riveting.
1345;Paul is a great man of courage and many lives were saved due to his efforts.
1346;Nick Nolte gives a solid performance as the UN commander who is powerless to stop the bloodshed.
1347;Terry George directs this movie according to detail.
1348;See man as both human and animals!
1349;Reports the shameful events that took place in Rwanda recent history with many powerful scenes.
1350;I highly recommend this movie to all.
1351;It was well directed and the cast was great it is a moving movie it makes you wonder how the world is
1352;As political wake up calls go, this is even more powerful than Schindler's List, since it makes us look inside ourselves at what we may have been able to prevent.
1353;This is a moving depiction of the Rwandan genocide, told from the point of view of Paul Rusesabagina, a real.
1354;Unlike the sweeping scope and flamboyant, somewhat off.
1355;putting titular character in 'Schindler's List', another compelling film about senseless human slaughter, 'Hotel Rwanda' succeeds in portraying a down.
1356;Great performances by Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo render the Rusesabaginas' plight very sympathetic.
1357;made, powerful and important film.
1358;the feeling that comes with being a well.
1359;informed and prepared citizen of the world.
1360;hotel Rwanda is the story of an extraordinary man who saved over one thousand Tutsi refugees in the 5.
1361;star Belgian hotel he managed.
1362;not only were the individual cast members fantastic in their roles, the collective energy and cohesion of the entire cast is really what made this movie so powerful.
1363;Powerful story and excellent acting and production values.
1364;I keeps you on the edge of your seat similar to Vargo.
1365;This is a powerful movie about a turbulent time that was ignored by the west whilst it occurred.
1366;It has some poignant and powerful performances, with Cheadle really shining.
1367;It has even more impact when you realise this is based on a true story.
1368;This is a fantastic film and one I highly recommend.
1369;This movie is excellent specially the sequence of the scenes and the cinematography.
1370;I recommend this movie to understand a little bit more not only about Rwanda, but about the world and the human being itself.
1371;This movie is so sad but the acting is wonderful.
1372;The first time I saw it I cried through the whole movie!
1373;This was an excellent family movie.
1374;I absolutely love the loyalty between the husband Paul and his wife Tati.
1375;i remember the massacre of the Tutsis by the Hutus in Africa in 1994 primarily because while it was occurring, I was in the midst of experiencing a paradigm shift: On April 6th (the very day that the violence in Africa was initiated) I had an extraordinary and entirely unexpected encounter with Jesus Christ, and as a result, my world.
1376;view was being transformed daily during that historically important period.
1377;as for the film itself, it is well.
1378;directed and contains an excellent performance from Don Cheadle as the lifesaving, Paul Rusesabagina, and an even more impressive performance by Sophie Okonedo who plays Rusesabagina's wife, Tatiana, a woman of grace, inner strength and beauty.
1379;nevertheless, I highly recommend HOTEL RWANDA to everyone.
1380;Every actor in this film is excellent and delivers a rather understated performances.
1381;Perhaps it's because the harrowing and tragic tale is something the real.
1382;In any event, this film while filled with excellent supporting actors belongs to its lead, Don Cheadle who earned a Best Actor nod for this performance (and should have won hands down).
1383;cheadle has been building an impressive resume with memorable supporting roles in which he nearly eclipses his leads.
1384;Season 1and remainded on the show for it's entire run and eventually emerged as the star of it.
1385;It's all in their subtle gestures, whispered dialogue, and revealing eyes.
1386;It is truly a harrowing tale told with great respect and dignity.
1387;I found no silly cliches or trite treatment of this compelling and important event in history.
1388;this film is outstanding and it that will move you and stay with you long after the experience of viewing it is over.
1389;i was surprised it's real, heavy and fantastic
1390;This was one of the best movies of 2004.
1391;Don Cheadle does a mezmerizing performance.
1392;This deserved to be nominated for best picture.
1393;Even the title song is great.
1394;The whole movie is excellent.
1395;If you want to see a movie were you will be inspired.
1396;I shut the door of my room keeping my son and wife away so that I could prevent them from watching any graphic or violent stuff the movie may have but I am happy it didn't.
1397;Throughout the movie I dreaded seeing such stuff but even without them what a powerful and gripping movie Hotel Rwanda turned out to be.
1398;The powerful acting, screenplay and storyline compensates for all that.
1399;His wife played by Sophie Okonedo also excels in a role that one cannot afford to ignore.
1400;What will they gain by offering help is enough to answer that question.
1401;This is a film that haunts you long after you've seen it.
1402;Hotel Rwanda portrays the sheer brutality of the time, as well as the courage and heroism of people, especially of Paul Rusesabagina, in saving Tutsis and moderate Hutus from being massacred by the Hutu militias.
1403;He was a great negotiator, knew all the important people in Kigali, and was good at bribing and talking his way through difficult situations, a skill that later not only saved his life, but those of many others.
1404;"He fled with his Tutsi wife and children to the hotel
I:11409;1405;Rusesabagina somehow managed to keep the 1,200 Tutsi refugees alive by using his negotiating skills and his contacts, both within the Rwandan government and abroad.
I:11409;1406;hotel Rwanda is a powerful film, with a superb performance from Don Cheadle as Rusesabagina, and Sophie Okonedo as his wife, Tatiana.
I:11409;1407;Nick Nolte is excellent as Col. Olivier, the UN commander, a character based on the real.
I:11409;1408;One of the things that shines through the horror is the love Rusesibagina has for his wife.
I:11409;1409;But it is worth seeing.
I:11409;1410;Hotel Rwanda was successful at naming the truth with out pushing the issue of blame.
I:11409;1411;Unforgettable performances by Cheadle and cast.
I:11409;1412;Performed with unforgettable realism that makes your stomach lurch.
I:11409;1413;A must see for adults and mature teenagers as a realistic look at the unfortunate state of our culture which will hopefully inspire social change in future generations.
I:11409;1414;I've watched this movie numerous times and I still get touched beyond belief.
I:11409;1415;It deeply touches my soul.
I:11409;1416;This movie truly enlightened me on what went on in this part of the world.
I:11409;1417;It's very intense and will keep you on the edge of your seat along with compassion for these people.
I:11409;1418;It does have lots of graphic violence but it brings you to the reality of what happened.
I:11409;1419;An inspiring story of a brave, resourceful, and compassionate man who saves the lives of hundreds of people from evil, genocidal militants.
I:11409;1420;Don Cheadle is fantastic in the lead role.
I:11409;1421;A very touching movie that brought me to tears.
I:11409;1422;This is very touching movie emotionally because it is based on true story from the eyewitness account of events.
I:11409;1423;Then I arrive and find out that this hotel is great!
I:11409;1424;The price was pretty decent (49 guinees a night), and I got lots of free amenities!
I:11409;1425;Lots of wildlife for them to play with!)
I:11409;1426;It helped to educate me about the incredibly lop.
I:11409;1427;I think Don is a superb and talented actor.
I:11409;1428;The entire cast was so Amazing, they made the story come alive.
I:11409;1429;It was an intimate account of this very explosive time in our history.
I:11409;1430;I am honored to have this film as a part of my collection and I am so grateful to the producers, writers, and individuals who made this possible.
I:11409;1431;Anyone who participated in the creation should feel proud.
I:11409;1432;Success of any movie is the ability of you to get involved into it.
I:11409;1433;everyone will like the movie ( irrespective of whether u are opinionated or not) since everyone of us have a 'noble'heart within us and we all crave for such 'true heroics' in life.
I:11409;1434;The movie is very successful in evoking those qualities within us.
I:11409;1435;needless distraction in this classic masterpiece!
I:11409;1436;well, its just amazing stuff.
I:11409;1437;to say more will be to spoil it, but this scene in particular really speaks to our basic human nature.
I:11409;1438;This movie is definitely worth seeing .
I:11409;1439;Bearing this in mind i well believe the film's underlying conclusion about western indifference to the conflict being linked to the colour of the victims' skin.
I:11409;1440;It is interesting how he became the hero he was, firstly he had a Tutsi wife .
I:11409;1441;Let me say now that i feel the Killing Fields is a far superior film.
I:11409;1442;Even if this film were absolutely direly acted and directed i would forgive it for two reasons, the first being that the genocide in Rwanda deserves to be recognised in film along with Cambodia/Auschwitz etc, the second reason is that this hotel manager is a true hero (not the clichy kind)and his story is an inspiration to the entire human race.
I:11409;1443;Having said that the film itself was very good, the acting was fine and the film achieves it's goal of psychological transplantation, you feel you are 'there'.
I:11409;1444;its really easy not to ever be in the mood to watch a war or violent movie, but please give this a watch.
I:11409;1445;I would tell you about the ending, but the movie is way better than any words i could come up with to describe it.
I:11409;1446;Here is a moving tale of a single star in a very dark night.
I:11409;1447;greaser to a resourceful humanitarian.
I:11409;1448;The biracial Briton Sophie Okonedo doesn't look especially African, but she is such an excellent actress that she soon overcomes any skepticism about her part as Paul's wife.
I:11409;1449;Nick Nolte does a fine job as the UN commander who can offer nothing more than empty promises.
I:11409;1450;The general is very pleased, and reminisces between swigs about a trip he once took to a single.
I:11409;1451;The film has been compared to Schindler's List, but cinematically it has more in common with The Killing Fields.

1453;"Nevertheless, this film is a powerful call to make ""Never again"" finally mean something."
1454;"While ""Rwanda"" doesn't live to up the standards set by Spielberg's masterpiece, it does feature its terror in living color, and draws attention to a moment in African history that hasn't been dramatized with much effect before."
1455;"writer/director Terry George has covered the Irish experience thoroughly in his films ""Some Mother's Sons,"" and ""In the Name of the Father,"" and he brings to ""Rwanda"" the same strength of focus to share untold stories to the world."
1456;Rwanda is an important film, sure to open the eyes of many with its taste of the Rwandan holocaust, but it also retains a powerful dramatic arc that might upset some looking for a more documentary feel to the film.
1457;This is Paul's story first and foremost, and the violent overthrow is seen through his eyes, or overheard on heated Hutu radio broadcasts.
1458;This is a touching performance of frantic internal struggling and the craft of smooth talking, and it reveals that Cheadle has something more to offer the art form.
1459;He's wonderful, and the film would be lost without his presence.
1460;Sophie Okonedo gives a fine, emotional performance as Paul's estranged Tutsi wife, earning an Oscar nomination for her efforts.
1461;"Just so certain audience members don't go home and stick their heads into ovens, ""Hotel Rwanda"" does end on a slightly hopeful note, which the right choice for this bleak film."
1462;While it isn't the definitive word on the Rwandan holocaust, George has constructed a fine dramatic feature, and a good first step to educating the masses on this disturbing event.
1463;"A harrowing story told with adequate execution, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a definitive look at the perils of genocide
I:11409;1464;Cheadle gives the performance of a lifetime"
1465;Powerful, yet not supremely spectacular.
1466;A classic and jarring movie about our hypocritical nature regarding the protection of human life from a political perspective, but a triumph on a personal level.
1467;The trailer of this film already got me into an emotional state.
1468;knowing that what I was seeing on the screen happend for real, really made me feel emotinally touched.
1469;It really breaks the heart knowing that.
1470;this gives very emotinonal and dramatic scenes.
1471;But also very tence onces that keep you on the edge of your seat.
1472;the casting of this movie is superb.
1473;Don Cheadle is the perfect choice for Paul Rusesabagina.
1474;He acts with feeling and portrais the hero of the story, an ordinairy man with his heart on the right place, in a way only he could.
1475;They were the perfect choices for these rolls.
1476;hotel Rwanda is shocking, realistic, heartbreaking, powerfull, emotional, but a yet beautiful film that shows a terrible historic event of a country.
1477;"In the distance you hear soft ""bangs"" When you see the people on the screen trying to make to best of it, having a couple of laughs, you expect that the sound you hear are fireworks."
1478;a movie that leaves a mark on your heart and makes you think about the question: Why do these things happen?A beautifully done movie experience.
1479;Great movie to watch and learn about the Rwanda genocide.
1480;It's timeless, poignantly educational, horrifying and then the director manages to make it a love story that insanely ends up feeling uplifting.
1481;This is an African version of Schindler's List.
1482;But the movie is so powerful.
1483;This movie is a work of art.
1484;I recommend Kim Anehall's review of the movie below if that's what you're searching for.
1485;"i recommend the photographic book, ""Inferno"", by James Nachtwey if you want to see the real face of this brutal civil war."
1486;Movies and entertainment make us all numb to the reality of human suffering.
1487;"Examples of this are U571, Last Samurai, Private Ryan (Where one gets the feeling that America ""took"" the beach."
1488;The film does a respectable, and rare, job of offering a fair portrayal of a non.
1489;In many instances you can plainly see his Canadian flag on his shoulder.
1490;The man is a real hero, and deserves more recognition than the world has given him.
1491;I remove one full star for that, and I don't care what their reasoning was.
1492;After ordering 10 of his finest men to secure the Prime Minister of Rwanda, 10 highly trained Belgians, who were among the finest and most experienced in the region.
1493;Good movie, kind of predictable outcome but still very informative.
1494;Gives you a heads up about genocide occuring in Africa.
1495;True stories always have the potential to tear at the heart, and Hotel Rwanda succeeds fabulously.
1496;i enjoyed seeing the house manager outfox politicians, gangsters, and vigilantes.
1497;The slow but steady build in tension as he first does so for profit, and later for survival was subtle and ingenious.
1498;Hotel Rwanda gave us a powerful example.
1499;my one brief editorial contribution here is that sometimes powerful nations should interfere just because it's right.
1500;line: Watch this and discuss.
1501;for those teens mature enough to think through violence that's real.
1502;I use this in my French II and III classes as a cross.
1503;French is the primary language, therefore we listen to it in English with French Subtitles making a vocabulary list of new words and phrases.
1504;We then discuss the historical aspects since most of my students are taking or will take World History II and in that class the civil war between the Hutus and Tutsis are taught.
1505;Ten years ago, as the country of Rwanda descended into madness, one man made a promise to protect the family he loved.
1506;Cheadle is great in this movie.
1507;A very moving and powerful movie.
1508;i was appalled once again at how inhumane we are as a race.
1509;notch in this movie, with Don Cheadle doing a masterful job as lead actor.
1510;Kudos to all involved in this film.
1511;More remarkable thing about this film is that it works brilliantly as first.
1512;rate thriller set against the background of the actual massacre in Rwanda without losing the touch of reality.
1513;Nick Nolte is very good as UN commander, and so is Joaquin Phoenix as journalist.
1514;The film is most convincing (and hauntingly so) at the earlier chapters, where the impending catastrophe is palpably sensed in what you can hear in the radio news or in the rumors people talk.
1515;as many reviewers said rightly, the film is tour.
1516;The real Paul Rusesabagina is a more robust person, but Cheadle embodies the spirit of everyman who just wanted to save his family and do the right thing.
1517;Helped greatly by his riveting acting, the film will grab your heart, being constantly unsettling, gripping, and inspirational.
1518;There are definitely parts that are quite intense and scary to think of being in their position.
1519;It should have ended there with a good ending, but it lead into a near.
1520;In 1992 a new kid moved into my high school.
1521;hOTEL RWANDA is a movie that tells the story of Paul Rusesabagina, a sort of modern day Oskar Schindler, who used his influence, contacts, and limited funds to save the lives of thousands of Tutsis refugees by housing them in the Milles Collines Hotel that he managed in Rwanda.
1522;worthy performance portraying Paul Rusesabagina.
1523;hOTEL RWANDA is a moving film portraying how the courage, compassion, and conviction of one person can make a difference in the world.
1524;Events similar to what happened in Rwanda are happening right now in Uganda, Nigeria, and other African nations.
1525;HOTEL RWANDA is a film that works incredibly well because it forces viewers to taste their guilt for idly sitting by and doing nothing as a continent rips itself apart.
1526;But it is important to realise that the focus of this story is a very personal one.
1527;Hotel Rwanda is film about the good side of humanity and it shows us that one great person can make a difference.
1528;The movie was difficult to watch, but well worth it for our it changes you view of life.
1529;The prevailing storyline may be a moving and inspiring, but it takes place against the backdrop of some of the most horrific events in recent memory.
1530;In a manner reminiscent of Schindler's List and The Pianist, Hotel Rwanda uses its story to shed a stark light on one of those instances where the unthinkable happens, namely the Rwandan genocide of 1994.
1531;Don Cheadle has a tall order in filling the role of real.
1532;life protagonist Paul Rusesabagina, but he manages to bring equal amounts of passion and nuance to a role that demands both.
1533;The movie wisely portrays Paul as less a born hero than one who had heroism thrust upon him, as the narrative sees him emerge from a consumnate businessman concerned with himself and his family (his wife was a Tutsi) to the savior of hundreds, both Hutu and Tutsi alike.
1534;inducing scenes in Schindler's List or The Pianist.
1535;but the film more than succeeds in capturing the sheer terror of what was occurring.

1537;The impotence of the UN is brought into especially sharp relief through the well.
1538;meaning Canadian colonel played in career.
1539;Whatever the case, though, it's certainly a brilliant movie in its own right, filled with powerful imagery, moral indignation, and Cheadle's captivating acting.
1540;What this man did was amazing!!
1541;if each one of us could do just 1/100th of what he did, this world could be an absolutly amazing place!Watch the movie .
1542;be inspired and learn !
1543;Best gift I have ever gotten him
1544;The movie is very worth watching and portrays a difficult time in Rwandan history with feeling
1545;A realistic,visual account of one man`s struggle to save lives during our world`s history of the madness of genocide!
1546;boggling and takes time for ones mind and human spirit to process.
1547;Great cinematography, wonderful resolution :.)
1548;superb acting by the cast.
1549;up movie to this fine gem of a movie.
1550;Diamond's book discusses many factors that go into this and I suggest his book a very important read.
1551;This movie is one of those uplifting movies centering on the power of positive human spirit.
1552;Refreshing to see a story about a black person who uplifts people, no matter what age or affiliation in this case.
1553;Really liked Don Cheadle and his co. star, Sophie Okonedo.
1554;This was a good movie.
1555;it shows a lot that most people dont know about.
