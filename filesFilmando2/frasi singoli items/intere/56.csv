1;people just see the amazing pictures.
2;i like the matrix it is a good filmthe actors a great the computer fx are great
3;this is a decent sci fi my 12 year old thought it was good, didn't watch the sequel yet, but will
4;ray the skynet edition is an excellent upgrade!!
5;Warner Bros. needs to do the same and upgrade the audio to a 6.1 DTS for one of the best action movies of all time to truely experience the dynamic sound that The Matrix should be watched with.
6;what can i say, this movie is truely great.
7;the story had me guessing the action is fast and fluid, the effects are great.
8;I personally feel that they could have been bolder and done decent business.
9;matrix is a awe inspiring cyber.
10;adventure, full of kinetic excitement, and borrows the gravity.
11;goers want a leap of the imagination, not one of those obligatory climaxes.
12;looking, both in its design and in the kinetic energy that powers it.
13;It creates fearsome creatures, including mechanical octopi.
14;Laurence Fishburne finds a balance between action hero and Zen master.
15;anne Moss, as Trinity, has a sensational title sequence, before the movie recalls that she's a woman and shuttles her into support mode.
16;it is really a revolution of the new world.
17;the kids wil lkke it.
18;it looks really expensive!its the second best of the set id say.
19;the third one was excellent but nearly as good as the 1st 2.
20;sci fans and action fans will be most drawn to it but its really likeable by all.
21;the important message is dont trust computers.
22;the special effects are really the story here.
23;in this world,anything is possible,so these guys learned to fight really good.
24;the effects are the best ever and have been emulated by movie after movie,video games, commercials and all else.
25;both of the first 2 matrix movies scored very big at the box office.
26;Simply put, this is a great movie.
27;Everything from the acting to the special effects is perfect.
28;If you haven't seen this movie, go and see it before the second one comes out.
29;This is for damn sure one of the best movies of 1999!
30;The cast was great the action was great and the special effects were great!
31;Hard to understand but you'll get used to it.
32;The soundtrack was great too.
33;The special effects were terrific.
34;paced, original, and wonderfully crafted (e. g., did you know that the red hues were filtered out of the matrix scenes to give the viewer a sense of a drab facsimile of reality?)
35;driven as 2001, the Matrix is surprisingly stimulating.
36;It definitely holds your attention throughout and makes you want to watch it again when you're done!
37;Right from the moment The Matrix starts, you've had it .
38;Great concept, great actors, real great SOUND/music and great special effects!!
39;I have recommended this film to tonnes of people!
40;The final confrontation with the agents in which neo finally masters his abilities is one of those special movie moments you remember for a long long time.
41;This is one helluva movie, and I would recommend it to anyone.
42;Action sequences are cool, fighting is top.
43;I really like this movie, its fast pace action is wonderful.
44;I've enjoyed intelligent sci fi films, such as Blade Runner and RoboCop (the first), and this movie definately fights its way to the top of my list.
45;I am in my forties, a woman, and I still loved it.
46;The story line helps you overlook the flaws in some of the logic, but the special effects are superb.
47;Give it a try, even if you are wary of special effects laded sci fi movies.
48;"You have the blue pill and the red pill, with the first one you can enjoy the effects, the performance, all that ""hollywood"" way in a movie."
49;With the red pill, you can discover in every character a message.
50;Matrix is the best movie I have seen in a long time.
51;My friends kept telling me to see it over and over again for about a year.
52;I finally saw it about two months ago and I have seen it four times since then.
53;The concept of the plot is amazing.
54;It is so original, atleast I never heard of anything like it before.
55;The special effects are wonderful.
56;The soundtrack is awesome too.
57;I love Rammstein and Marilyn Manson and the techno music too.
58;So what I'm saying is see this movie and own the soundtrack.
59;however even more interestingly is that we can now experience the Matrix for ourselves.
60;Recently a new spiritual force has been spreading throughout the world opening up the possibility of experiencing this insight.
61;Before I was blind and now I can see.
62;Good luck and God bless.
63;I succeeded at not giving any spoilers during, and it made me remember the first time I had seen it.
64;Great movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat and cheering at the end.
65;The matrix dazzles you with awesome special effects.
66;this movie was a well planned out movie.
67;I rated this movie a 5 because it has a lot of great action parts.
68;and the affects were great.
69;If you want to see a thriller, action, sci.
70;fi movie then this is perfect for you!
71;Even if you aren't a fan of these genres you will still appreciate this movie a lot!
72;The Matrix is the best film i've seen in many years!
73;It's a good story, the visuals are impressive, and the special effects are simply amazing.
74;But I think it will go down as one of those timely films that captured a snapshot of our cultures myths at a certain point in time.
75;And rightfully so!It was revolutionary, it was fresh and most importantly, it was cool!The special effects were usually top.
76;notch and the characters were good, displaying decent acting.
77;He was strong, and strongly desired by the opposing forces.
78;Now a Myth in movie history, The Matrix is Anime style for real, or at least, close enough to the concept.
79;Conceptually ground breaking, and visually stunning, the film blends Kun Fu (Mega Kick action), along with the appealing Cyber.
80;4 Academy Awards, including Best Editing, crowned the recognition as a Masterpiece, and helped the film sell more for the already trigger.
81;happy Joel Silver (in case you are wondering, money does make you fat, right Joel?)
82;, the rest, is all history.
83;"the Matrix has tree merits that makes its first viewing a crazy ride
I:8405;84;And of course, the amazing and never before seen visual effects that where always in service of the story (the opposite of The Matrix Reloaded, and The Matrix Revolutions, where every visual effect is for free, away from any story necessity), all reunited by a accurate direction, with the help of a First class crew, made The Matrix a cinematic phenomenon.
I:8405;85;The script was good enough to sustain its story weakness and character stereotypes, ending in a great rush of action and Kun Fu fights, stunning from beginning to end.
I:8405;86;The music by Don Davis, is a mediocre work, mostly saved by the good choice of songs blended with his original score.
I:8405;87;time shot the pistols disappears completely, when the scene cuts away from the Bullet.
I:8405;88;time and we see Neo on the ground, the pistols re.
I:8405;89;The transferring is great (the digitally grading of the film can be appreciated at its fullest), with a clean 5.1 Dolby digital, magnifying the Bullet.
I:8405;90;realistic world of computer intelligence and Kun Fu punches.
I:8405;91;The special effects are superb and the story.
I:8405;92;line was generally good .
I:8405;93;I gave it a four star rating because while it was thrilling and exciting .
I:8405;94;I felt a bit more could have been done with regards to the science.
I:8405;95;I still to this date watch this Movie !!
I:8405;96;A good couple of great Killer Action Fights which Defy All gravity!Thers action , Comedy and of course a love story gets envolved.
I:8405;97;in the end it all makes sense that it was a Success !
I:8405;98;It has those great graphics when Neo gets shot at.
I:8405;99;I recommend it to everybody.
I:8405;100;This is still my favourite movie and one that I have seen more than 10 times.
I:8405;101;It is a movie that can be seen on many levels.
I:8405;102;Some will see it just as a great action movie which it is, but there is so much more to this film.
I:8405;103;It is a fantastic depiction of the journey of the spiritual seeker and the difficulties that he encounters within himself as he starts pushing against the prisons of his own mind and the multitude of programs that operates and which keep us small.
I:8405;104;the story is part of a trilogy and all three parts are worth watching more than once, as you will undoubtedly see new things each time.
I:8405;105;The matrix is the best movie i have ever seen.
I:8405;106;It blends the awesome world of CGI technology with live action stunts and actually has a plot!
I:8405;107;it is worth every penny u spend on it.
I:8405;108;for the first time for all I know.
I:8405;109;Other remarkable features are the Lewis Carroll references,the monologue by.
I:8405;110;one of the greatest movie made.
I:8405;111;anyone who likes this movie will most diffinately look forward to the sequel
I:8405;112;Yes, it's Keanu Reeves, but the store line is just fantastic.
I:8405;113;Must see for Sci Fi and will become a classic for sci fi lovers
I:8405;114;But if you went to see the movie with an open mind, you come out impressively suprised and happy (same with Starship Troopers).
I:8405;115;Of course The Matrix was the greatest movie of 1999 and the special effects were awesome!
I:8405;116;The effects are much more effective and will pull you right out of your chair.
I:8405;117;Of course, combine this with a good sound system as well, and this is about as close as you can get to seeing it in the theater.
I:8405;118;It is a really great concept
I:8405;119;Having done so, I, once outside of the theatre, decided to see it again"
120;In that it deals with juxtaposing our world as we know it with the created world of The Matrix.
121;In other words, we create the reality, collectively and individually, we experience at any given moment.
122;Be it our clothes, careers, institutions, constructs, or places of residence.
123;It is the proverbial dream world.
124;great production values, great acting, great plot.
125;watch it and you'll most certainly love it, that is if you mature enough to understand everything what happens on.
126;At first the effects attack you with their jarring edginess, and then the idea of a real Matrix, and finally the philosophy becomes the sharpest edge.
127;My whole family is full of conspiracy theorists, and this is our new favorite.
128;There is alot to absorb.
129;Keanu Reeves' now signiture role is introduced in this soon to be trilogy movie.
130;But even though it was a very technical movie it also had a lot of human elements.
131;ray is excellent,i keep discovering new details , sound was also very good although i would have preferred DTS.
132;ray this is The One.
133;one of the most special effects laden movies of all time, Matrix still holds it ground as one of the best many years later.
134;Add to that a solid story line and terrific casting, and you have the makings of a very good movie.
135;paced action movie that will keep you riveted to your seat from start to finish.
136;This VHS version also comes with 4 behind.
137;scenes features at the end of the movie that shows you how parts of the movie were made, including the awesome bullet scene on top of the building.
138;While you wait for that to come out, go ahead and pick up the original and enjoy it now.
139;Great action, plot, and even Reeves is pretty good.
140;This is a movie than can be watched more than 10 times and still amaze an audience of all ages.
141;Great story line and creativity .
142;After hearing so many good things about this film, I was actually underwhelmed the first time I saw it.
143;It wasn't until the SECOND time I saw it that it really hit me.
144;Very well written, with some philosophical underpinnings hidden throughout, the Matrix is a smart sci.
145;This has got to be the coolest action movie ever.
146;It has a very creative and interesting plot, great acting, great cinematography, and best of all, the coolest and most unique action scenes ever, which have inspired many movies after it.
147;just put it this way, this movie is a work of art.
148;This is one of the few action movies that I feel should have gone up for oscars such as best picture and best director.
149;Take this advice from the master.
150;I'm gonna keep seeing it again because it is by far the most awesome movie ever created.
151;The fighting and special effects are so incredibly revolutionary that it will set the standard for movies to come for the next thousand years.
152;Already you can see the shockwave that it's sending through Hollywood's movies.
153;And after you roll up your tongue, you can watch the movie over and over again until you finally understand the movie.
154;The storyline is so complex and indepth, I found new pieces that I didn't notice before seeing it for the 18th time.
155;I came out of the cinema with my friends and we all looked at each other and said Wow .
156;A superb and thought provoking spin on life as we know it.
157;Superb visuals and 5.1 soundtrack, with house.
158;the matrix it's the best film that i've ever seen.
159;i loved the plot and the special effects and the stars as well for me it was well acted and well made.
160;believe me this movie its a must see.
161;, but also with the fantastic visual effects by John Gaeta, incredible fight scenes by Yuen Wo Ping, and astounding production design by Owen Paterson.
162;Put together, the product of these geniuses made a superb sci.
163;One of the few best movies I have ever seen.
164;The Matrix, as other reviers will attest to, is a slick cyberpunk thriller set in a dismal world.
165;time, though that is cool.
166;The best part of the Matrix is described in one word: Lobby.
167;In it, Neo (Reeves) enters the lobby for a high security building, of purpose unknown, and steps through a metal detector.
168;that is the start for what is the lynchpin, the strongest scene of the film.
169;Take out the Lobby, and you still have a fair movie.
170;The Lobby scene is easily the best gunfight ever recorded on film.
171;The tiles of the floor shatter beautifully as Neo flips around, unscathed.
172;That, more then anything else, makes me crave the Reload.
173;This is a truly great film.
174;The premise is fascinating, the groundbreaking effects and the cast superb, the script full of poetic ideas that spark the imagination.
175;the innocence/wisdom, the physical grace.
176;Like a god/prince in the quest for truth, the part fits him like a velvet glove and he makes the most of it.
177;it's a film that must be seen several times.
178;This is easily the best sci.
179;fi adventure I've ever seen, and Keanu is magnificent.
180;A defining film for the sci.
181;so the movie as itself is very cool you have never seen better one.
182;i would recommend it to evryone who wants or loves actoin/s.
183;A surprisingly deep, disturbng and meaningful plot.
184;the Matrix is godsend for those of you who love their action movies thick and fast with that little hint of intelligence.
185;Keanu Reeves is outstanding as Neo, the person whom the story revolves around.
186;moss (trinity) also play their parts very well.
187;the directors and the production team also deserve high praise for the superb camera work and sounds (they won several Academy Awards).
188;line and script, but the second viewing really does reveal and uncover anything you may have overlooked the first time.
189;Not only will they be impressed by the effects, the above.
190;license and a reprise from more serious films, The Matrix is a must.
191;also recommended (although totally unrelated): Aving Private Ryan, The Truman Show, Bladerunner, The Godfather, Philadelhpia
192;i have to admit, when i saw the this movie the first time i was stunned by the great visual effects and the amazing martial arts.
193;Excellent special Effects, Sounds , cinematography,Stunts and other mind.
194;This documentary was very insightful to the events of our governments actions.
195;I believe that it should be shown in classrooms everywhere, as it is an educational and otherwise honest film detailing the control that the communist have over our nation.
196;All in all an ingenious film
197;The matrix is a film about the human race finding an energy within themselves that will allow us maximum results from our measley existence.
198;To understand the meaning behind a film with such a vast vision, one must be able to step outside himself (as when the film's characters went back to the spaceship) and see a world beyond the tangible one we live in.
199;It's simple: everyone is the one !
200;and the theatrical fact that there was a race of machines smarter than ourselves, which created the world we see and feel while really hiding their true agenda is a fantastic metaphor for finding that space within ourselves that can allow us to 'bend spoons' mentally.
201;And to have the world on a string.
202;The action in the movie serves to keep you focused on plot.
203;Now, having read this review, watch the film again and understand it's true meaning.
204;Everything on this film is great.
205;i can explain it's success only by the lack of something better.
206;It's so delightfully stupid!The costume design is just horrendous.
207;This has got to be the best movie that I have EVER seen!
208;fi action movies this one's for you!
209;There, a review that made as much sense as the film.
210;I understand that most of the viewers are in for the eye.
211;I would have honestly liked the movie a great much better if the plot was more styled toward th thrill and the mystery rather than the special effects (all of which have been fully blown in the commercials .
212;I think this film is a very interesting and exciting.
213;but still what a great movie.
214;also mission imposible 2 is filled with some scenes from a video game called metal gear solid.
215;There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero.
216;With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync.
217;The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky.
218;As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked!
219;role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne.
220;scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.)
221;people will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation.
222;The story was well thought through.
223;The stunts were absolutely amazing.
224;If you have never seen this movie, I envy you.
225;The intentional depth of this movie is astounding.
226;I guarantee you will keep analyzing the movie long after you've seen it.
227;The script is brilliant and the visuals are incomparable.
228;the movie was fun keep you on your toes and the acting was suberb.
229;I recommend this movie for the adult crowd with winter coming settled back and enjoy.
230;Lots of action and cool effects, and suspenseful too.
231;Even years after it came out I enjoyed it.
232;i like this film and i think he is very interesting
233;I have seen this movie 6 times but want to see it again and again, the more you see this, the more you will understand the logic behind the movie.
234;Larry Wachowski, Congratulations on such a great masterpiece.
235;A terrific story with twists turns and lots of action.
236;This is a very enjoyable science.
237;fiction film that explores the nature of reality.
238;The film is very cleverly anti.
239;this is a brilliant film that should be watched by everyone.
240;You can simply watch it as a science.
241;fiction action film, or you can understand the philosophical and mystical messages in it, or finally the revelation: the political and social messages in it.You need to watch the film at least three times, and listen to the dialogue carefully to understand it.
242;This film demands multiple viewings, and is a film that should be owned.
243;With the layers of meanings in the film, and the messages weaved into the story, it makes for a very watchable film.
244;The special effects are also brilliant, as are the sets.
245;The fighting scenes ruled and the action was perfect.
246;Keanu Reeves works a schlub job as a programmer during the day.
247;At night he's a sophisticated hacker.
248;But which of those is his real job?
249;Its technical achievements were recognized at the Academy Award ceremonies, making it that rarity.
250;Number one, the special effects are good, so I won't argue with that.
251;It's one of the best movies there IS.
252;The guy who made it (sorry I don't know who) obviously wanted to create a really fun, really intense and meaningful action movie (with lots of cool effects I might add) and he definitely did so.
253;Keanu himself said he loved it.
254;I had the full effects and advantages of all the fancy technology.
255;A visual feast for anyone, especially those who enjoy sci.
256;Although like most these days, this movie has enough people getting blown away by big automatic weapons to last for me for a millennium, the other details were just so amazing that I was able to look beyond that for once.
257;I liked the fact that Trinity (Carrie Anne Moss), was a strong woman but still had a very compassionate and vulnerable side.
258;Of course, Keanu Reeves is very easy to look at and was good in the character of Neo.
259;An exhilerating action flick with adrenaline.
260;A tribute to late 90's special effects and CGI.
261;On the other hand the special effects were great and the story line and idea were good but if you saw Dark City you would realize where they got the idea for the movie.
262;Best part about it was that it makes you question the reality that you were given and shown to you.
263;If you want to see an excellent movie, see the Matrix.
264;The Matrix is the best movie I have ever seen and it will be made into 2 sequels, so it get with the times and own this masterpice today!
265;while it's the first of a trilogy,it stands on its own.
266;ann Moss is strong as Trinity,the woman who aids him in self.
267;laurence Fishburne is a convincing Morpheus mentor figure.
268;"Neo's ""birth"" sequence in which he frees himself is gruesome,but not gratuitous."
269;The Matrix is one of the best sci.
270;If you like science fiction,this is perfect!
271;One of my favorite films, The Matrix has a complex in.
272;depth story, excellent visuals and cool action.
273;By using martial arts and knowledge from computers that process knowledge into their minds and special powers, these cyber rebels fight for real freedom from The Matrix.
274;The visuals such as the kung fu scene between Morpheus and Neo, and the fight bewteen Neo and Agent Smith are incredible.
275;As a hard working teen, athlete and a one.
276;I just enjoy it and state my review right here.
277;This is the best action movie I have ever seen, plus it's sci.
278;It has a tremondous plot line that's original.
279;This movie has to be one of the most thoughful movies made in the last ten years.
280;The writing has incredible nuance.
281;The attention to detail is a pleasure to watch.
282;If you know the issues underlying the story, you see that this movie deftly delivers on multiple levels.
283;The best film of the 90's!!
284;The great plot, the intense action, and the jaw.
285;dropping special effects, it is all superb.
286;time favorite film, if you care to know.
287;Great effects, plenty of action and a decent story.
288;The makers of this film obviously thought it would be fun to throw some spectacular (which basically means that they could have used some heavy improvement) special effects in with a ridiculous plot and hope to draw a crowd.
289;Keanu Reeves is incredibly hard to take seriously ever since his fantastic outings as Ted in the Bill and Ted movies.
290;This movie can be summed up in a few words.
291;It seems that everybody smart these days have to go against the law.
292;oh well, it was still a good movie.
293;so good, it made me wonder if I was IN the matrix.
294;A fun movie with truth embedded for you to find.
295;If you haven't watched the Matrix, I highly recommend it.
296;It's fast paced, action packed, and will really make you think.
297;It had been a few year since I had watched it, and it was every bit as good as I remembered it.
298;Now with Amazon I can watch movies anywhere!
299;Is an excellent adventure Sci.
300;I loved the filming and effects done in the film.
301;They have excellent actors who did great through the movie.
302;The Matrix is one of my favorite sci fi movies of all time.
303;It introduced the slow motion fight scenes, has a great techno soundtrack, introduces a new twist on machines taking over, and living in a computer.
304;This is a great movie even with all the religious undertones.
305;It is interesting that it spawned a whole new movie experience that others have copied over and over again and again.
306;This is the first movie to ever discuss Anarchist philosophy!
307;I came here to tell how it's going to begin.
308;The Matrix will keep you on the edge of your seat.
309;Also, the special effects are incredible, and the martial arts are good.
310;widescreen is a plus, and the additional making of footage is interesting.
311;I enjoyed this movie on VHS after it came out on video and rewatched it with my son the other day.
312;It's still pretty fresh stuff, if you overlook the Nokia feature phones :) This movie is one of the best at the what is reality concept.
313;Soon, Neo is in the Real World fighting within the matrix.
314;so story but excellent action moments.
315;Brilliant choreography, excellent score and most of all an awesome cast!
316;I just love the matrix movie.
317;It was a good deal from amazon.
318;Lots of the special effects were created for the movie.
319;I thought the whole thing was very innovative.
320;He had a day job with a respectable programming company, and he did a little less honest business on the side.
321;Some problems arise, as you may have suspected, and Anderson, better known as Neo, finds a nice violent solution.
322;Most of it derives from concepts and theories portrayed in several Star Trek and Outer Limits episodes.
323;One of my favorite all time movies and certainly a title that can be watched over and over.
324;first off this movie is simply one of the greatest sci fi movies ever made, much better than the Star Wars or Star Trek films simply because the writing of this script was so well done.
325;The incredible cinematography and special effects that went into making this film would make it worth watching alone even if the plot, story and characters weren't all that great, but thankfully they are that and more.
326;the story is a Christology in part and an allegory that leans so towards the Christian experience that either the writers are believers or perhaps they just feel Christ and the beliefs that surround Him are such good myths that they'd high jack the premise and make a modern science fiction story about it.
327;The quickie dictionary definition of an allegory is this: the expression through symbolism of truths about human experience and this movie does a good job of using symbolism to show us where we really are (at least from the Christian stand point).
328;And to believers this world isn't our true home, we are Strangers in a Strange Land (and like in R. a. h's famous book of the same name, Michael is able to manipulate physical reality as is Neo in The Matrix simply because they see it for what it really is.)
329;But maybe we could all use a reminder to live our lives with such trust.
330;There is a clear message that doesn't get lost in the amazing special effects.
331;They are a little slow, but the movie picks up very well, and stays at the faster pace.
332;There are several unexpected plot twists.
333;The special effects are unbeliveable, yet fit in perfectly with the premise.
334;This is not a we have a great effect, how can we use it movie, but a we have a great script, how can we film it one.
335;This has to be one of the most exciting sci.
336;fi action flicks I have ever seen!!
337;What made it so great was the fact that the actors trained before filming the movie.
338;The graphics and the breathtaking special effects look great!
339;I enjoyed all the movies in the series but the first one, The Matrix, is still my favorite.
340;The characters are all new, lots of action, good effects and a great storyline.
341;I watch it 3 to 4 times per year.
342;excellent script, acting, effects, stunts.
343;I found it reminiscent of Dark City and perhaps Total Recall, in that things are not always as they appear.
344;Hands down my favorite film of all time.
345;The Matrix is filled with action and complimented by a great plot.
346;: A poster, some cards, a box, and a film!
347;I will stick to movies such as Notting Hill.
348;The Matrix is one of the best films ever made, the action in it is fantastic, and it's also a very philosophical movie that raises some very interesting questions.
349;The Matrix is simply an incredible movie.
350;It deals with society in a whole new light.
351;It is action packed, full of guns, although not bloody, and very suspenseful.
352;stylish cinematography, clever concept, cool cast.
353;breaking special effects and stylish action.
354;*Intruiging premise, with a storyline that keeps you hooked.
355;"*Good cast of characters
I:8405;356;It's very original in its own right.
I:8405;357;Each new viewing reveals something new to think about.
I:8405;358;*Filming style is excellent, even when the camera is not doing a 360.
I:8405;359;It's fresh, original, and has many strong motifs.
I:8405;360;The use of colors is excellent as well.
I:8405;361;*Now that I've seen it five times, I can see strong continuity with the sequels.
I:8405;362;All of the fighting is more in the end.
I:8405;363;bending action and effects, the story is swell and has lots of awesome, memorable characters.
I:8405;364;Themes and motifs are strong, and with each new viewing, something new can be discovered.
I:8405;365;It is even stronger now that the sequels are out, and one can see how all three films work together as a whole.
I:8405;366;It is constantly refreshing and exciting to watch this, for it is probably the most intelligent action movie ever made.
I:8405;367;I expect that this will become a cinematic classic"
368;And the Lobby Scene is the best shootout in years.
369;The contents and performances of this movie are more alike animation than most other sci.
370;I liked this movie only for the idea of the matrix itself.
371;but like I said, I found the concept of a matrix interesting.
372;"If you liked this movie, read ""1984"" and merge the two."
373;The concept of a matrix brings philosophical questions.
374;Truman eventually discovered what was going on and broke free from the set and into the real world.
375;The Matrix, without a doubt, is one of the most amazing films out to this day.
376;It is a grandiose twist of the idea of dream skepticism, which aims to entertain wast audience appealing to teens as well as adults.
377;This great film will be remembered for a long time.
378;Interchange the words human being with robot/ai , read the three laws again in this manner and that is the world of the Matrix, the robots rule!
379;well, you'll have to watch this excellent movie to find out.
380;Has alot of great extras on the disk.
381;I also highly recommend The Mummy, Alien Legacy, and the Nightmare On Elm Et.
382;This is the greatest Sci Fi movie of all time .
383;The story and premise are awesome, I love movies that make people's view of the world/universe turn upside down.
384;OK mabye Keanu can bug sometimes in some movies but he works in this one all things considered.
385;The story and concepts are what really make this movie.
386;The special effects and action are just icing on the cake.
387;A very smart movie that is a visual special effects masterpiece.
388;A movie that holds your attention throughout and on that you will want to watch again.
389;My recommedeation: watch it again.
390;But this is told in a very entertaining manner and is very well written.
391;I know that this review is a little vague as to the overall story but that is the beauty of the movie and I would rather not spoil it for those who have not seen it yet.
392;The best movie of 1999, American Beauty (which I also loved) included.
393;I've always thought this was a great movie, even Keanu Reeves does a great job.
394;It's a great movie and very well made.
395;it is packed with extras and is quite simply one of the greatest films of the past 5 years
396;When the Matrix came into movie theatres country wide last year, millions of people knew they wanted to see it because of its science fiction look which appealed to them.
397;"This movie lives up to its exciting preview, and is, oscar winner or not
I:8405;398;Keanu Reeves is Tom Anderson, a programmer by day, and a hacker by night.
I:8405;399;He joins a group of other hackers who tell him a frightening fact: we are living in a dream world generated by a computer called the Matrix.
I:8405;400;The effects are astounding, especially bullet.
I:8405;401;This is the first in a trilogy, and I plan to see them all.
I:8405;402;One of the kings of Hong Kong, Yuen Woo Ping, does a good job with the action and the effects are excellent.
I:8405;403;The mixture of humour, action, suspense and romance simply doesn't click in The Matrix.
I:8405;404;line review before, but here goes: The Matrix is the best movie EVER.
I:8405;405;the best SciFi movie after Star Wars.
I:8405;406;The plot is interesting and to an extent original, as no one in holywood ever came up with anything like it.
I:8405;407;The special FX are mind dazzling, and the soundtrack isn't half bad either.
I:8405;408;That way you're guranteed to enjoy it.
I:8405;409;What can you say about one of the top 50 movies of all time.
I:8405;410;Great movie, and everyone should at least watch it once.
I:8405;411;it has the best special effects ever.
I:8405;412;I think it's the best film I've ever seen, much better than its two sequels.
I:8405;413;i had to watch it for my philosophy class and it was probably the best homework ever.
I:8405;414;But, do yourself a favor and have a look at the original sources on which The Matrix is based.
I:8405;415;The special effects in this movie are great.
I:8405;416;The Wachowski brothers struck gold with this dazzling sci.
I:8405;417;The actors make the story have depth and feeling.
I:8405;418;The matrix is one of the first movies to start the mind/ perception genre and the plot was very unique when it was first released.
I:8405;419;since then many other movies have copied this theme.
I:8405;420;The matrix can make you think about your world and it pulls you in.
I:8405;421;The thought that in the future we could merely download karate into our minds is mind numbing!
I:8405;422;while it's not the end all of science fiction films, it is entertaining, thoughtful when it has to be, and, as I already said, entertaining.
I:8405;423;It does what a movie should: keeps you interested.
I:8405;424;I think this definitely is the best movie I've ever seen.
I:8405;425;It's plot line is perfect and with the graphics and action added it makes this one of the greatest movies of all time.
I:8405;426;One of my favorite action dramas.
I:8405;427;Great action scenes and special effects!
I:8405;428;Wonderfully intriguing plot for a sci.
I:8405;429;fi, open up your mind and go along with the premise.
I:8405;430;My kids love this movie and turned me onto it.
I:8405;431;Think outside of the box for awhile and enjoy.
I:8405;432;There will come a redeemer, who will see through all deception and become the perfect warrior in mankind's cause.
I:8405;433;Talk about entertainment, this film keeps your butt firmly on the edge of your seat and your jaw on the floor.
I:8405;434;The action is intense, the plot is multi.
I:8405;435;layered and the effects are sumptuous.
I:8405;436;You will believe a man can fly.
I:8405;437;With The Matrix however, it is all brought together into a frightening whole.
I:8405;438;At times you will wonder about your own reality.
I:8405;439;dragged kicking and screaming out of the Matrix and into the real world, Neo learns the truth and finds he now has the responsibility of saving the world, thrust on his sculpted shoulders.
I:8405;440;with a little love on the side.
I:8405;441;more philosophical, yet interesting action packed movie ever made .
I:8405;442;the Matrix is truly a masterpiece of Hollywood, in a time when mostly watered.
I:8405;443;there are also very credible parallels between The Matrix and Christianity, as Morpheus is resurrected in the movie, and Neo has to lead his followers to ultimate triumph.
I:8405;444;on a simpler level, The Matrix is a movie which is 100% enjoyable.
I:8405;445;it is filled w/action scenes, cliff.
I:8405;446;hangers, and ideas that will make you think.
I:8405;447;before Morpheus blatantly explains what the Matrix is, and shows Neo to the desert of the real, the watcher has to wonder what IS the matrix?on an acting note, Keanu Reeves is admirable in this leading role, and his supporting actors (forgive me for not knowing their names, im not the biggest movie buff ever) are excellent in being believable in the people they are supposed to be.
I:8405;448;the movie also throws a curve w/one of the characters which keeps it on a very real level, keeping the ideas and characters w/i this world despite delving into great levels of sci.
I:8405;449;do not make the same mistake, it is a fantastic movie.
I:8405;450;please go watch it and make yourself happy
I:8405;451;The best movie you'll be able to see.
I:8405;452;So see It for your self, and the matrix has you.
I:8405;453;The acting is excellent, the fight scenes are excellent, the special effects are excellent, the script is excellent, etc. i'll admit, this movie doesn't create deep thought or anything.
I:8405;454;This movie is a must for everyone who likes action movies.
I:8405;455;The original movie that created evolution in peoples' thinking about the nature of reality.
I:8405;456;as though on a primal level the movie reveals hints of something that the subconscious mind knows to be real.
I:8405;457;Joe was great and you better watch him on the Sopranos because he's great there to.
I:8405;458;Have seen this movie many times amd it continues to amaze me.
I:8405;459;Because the action is now familiar, I focused on the script and it is suprisingly cerebral.
I:8405;460;Best movie of all time?
I:8405;461;The Matrix does have some spectacular moments and everyone looks extremely cool.
I:8405;462;Mr. David Jones rated this movie as a chilly excitement for the masses.
I:8405;463;The tremendous value of this chilly kick and hit movie is that such a message is not just said.
I:8405;464;This is what I consider the greatest sci.
I:8405;465;fi movie of my generation.
I:8405;466;Visually, it is spectacular to see on the big screen.
I:8405;467;I was that stunned by the visuals and the storyline.
I:8405;468;blowing special effects and an absorbing premise about the future that is both scary and quite probable.
I:8405;469;It's not an original idea, but I think the combination of dialogue, effects, and setting along with the deep ideas within it make the movie compelling.
I:8405;470;The movie is fast paced, and a startling concept.
I:8405;471;I find Matrix to be a very satisfying future/sci/tech movie that I highly recommend.
I:8405;472;I loved this movie because it showed the power of love.
I:8405;473;Notice how Neo actually flatlined in the matrix but Trinity's love restarted his heart and brought him back from the dead!
I:8405;474;Finally, I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Agent Smith"
475;The Matrix is an awesome movie!
476;I love the special effects.
477;There's really heavy philosophy, astounding special effects, intruiging music, a lot of kung.
478;best scene: Morpheus is held in custody by the Secret Police.
479;And that chopper that collides with the skyscraper.
480;The Warchowski brothers have succeeded in creating a very clever, almost genial, indeed almost too clever, Gnostic or Hindu.
481;but despite that, I nevertheless give this movie 5 stars.
482;it's far better that any i've seen after it.
483;I've now seen this movie over 15 times, and still enjoy it every time.
484;The extras are great, but the movie itself holds up for multiple viewings .
485;great storyline, incredible special effects.
486;Keanu Reeves is not the best actor in the world, but he was perfect for this role .
487;is one of the best moments of the film, an inflection he carried over from his Bill and Ted Days.
488;This movie has exactly two things to recommend it:1.
489;Best sci fi movie of 1999.
490;It had something Star Wars didn't, a good and original story.
491;He must make a choice.
492;The inquistion gets pretty scary.
493;Then it gets really cool.
494;It really stretches the imagination.
495;i thought the special effects were great.
496;Mind you a bit on the violent side, but that does sell with this generation.
497;keanu Reeves was perfect for this role.
498;He had the look and style to pull it off.
499;It is nice when a person that was a young star matures into his roles and changes with his own seasons.
500;It is easy to see new things in it each time.
501;This movie is simply the best.
502;Laurence Fishburne is the best!
503;This film, in my opinion is a fantastic fusion of action and an excellent plot.
504;This movie uses groundbreaking special effects to compliment one of the deepest plots in any recent film.
505;The plot in this movie keeps the viewer thinking, wile the action keeps you on the edge of your seat.
506;I would recommend this film to all action film lovers as well as someone just looking for a movie that is a technical masterpiece.
507;I prefer the scruffy, complicated, firey man from Nazareth.
508;wize decent people have almost worshipped this film .
509;Spirituality is a world of tiny deeds unnoticed, momentary ecstasys, deep sadness, joys that cannot be comphrehended, momentary brawls with the spirits, midnight fist fights with God, beauty, and service.
510;The spirituality of this film is pure, self.
511;Go out and do something good for yourself and the people you love.
512;This is the ultimate in SciFi.
513;they managed to make a fantastic movie, with him involved.
514;perfectly appropriate for the film, and has a lot of short lines.
515;Somehow the Director made it work, and Keanu was very good in the role.
516;This was probably the best movie I've seen in a long time.
517;It gets weird at parts, but its perfectly understandable.
518;The special effects are amazing and the sound is great!
519;the acting was real and the special effects were amazing.
520;Simply one of the most stunning movies of the last twenty years.
521;Will have you questioning everything around you.
522;What a ride, what effects, what a concept!
523;I really liked the Follow the White Rabbit special feature in which you get to see how certain scenes were filmed.
524;old said afterward that this was the best movie he has ever seen.
525;This movie absolutely blew me away when I saw it at the cinema.
526;the special effects were some of the best I have ever seen.
527;The sound track was dynamic, the casting excellent.
528;I hope the sequel will be as good.
529;i would call this one a classic movie in its genre.
530;I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action/drama.
531;Although the plot is a bit trite ( the one ), this is a wonderful film.
532;are alone enough to make this a must own.
533;The Matrix has to be one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen.
534;excellent action scenes to keep one in never ending suspense.
535;i would recommend this movie a thousand times over.
536;it's a movie that gets the viewer totally involved.
537;At one point, Morpheus offers Neo two pills: one pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small . . . and Neo chooses the one which Morpheus says will show him how far down the rabbit hole goes.
538;somebody (maybe everybody) has considerable experience with psychoactive drugs here.
539;I've got it here, and it seems fitting.
540;"Morpheus believes Neo is ""The One,"" the person they have been looking for all their lives who can destroy the power of the Matrix."
541;All I can say about the movie is that it's a good movie with great special effects and probably, standing on its own is worthy of 5 stars.
542;The special effects are fine, but overloaded (just as said in Amadeus: too many notes).
543;violations of even the simplest principles of thermodynamics and physics aside, this movie is startlingly enjoyable.
544;Absolutely wonderful special effects, a fantastic cyberpunk atmosphere, and a nice enough story if you're willing to shut down a section of brain or two in order to allow the needed amounts of suspension of disbelief to kick in.
545;anne Moss is absolutely stunning.
546;fi fans will probably be upset by this.
547;It's a cool looking movie with great effects and everything.
548;And absolute must have classics for any Science Fiction lover.
549;but weird is always best.
550;^^ The creators of this movie and plot are ingenius but still at the same time fun loving and unique.
551;The actors are so awesome!
552;This is a must have for anyone's collection!
553;I always liked Morpheus the best.
554;Yes, this all the amazing things you heard about.
555;This movie is nothing sort of amazing.
556;This is a great movie.
557;I usually don't like movies my teenagers like, but I must say this was one real neat flick!
558;This one is worth it!
559;The Matrix is, without a dought, is a well writen science.
560;fiction movie, with it's freaky sounds and great speacial effects, it's guaranteed to nock your socks off.
561;He gets freed and is introduced to the Real World.
562;He realizes that he is the One, and he has to fight these supernatural Agents that he is suposed to be afraid of.
563;Overall the is a fantastic movie!
564;I saw The Matrix and let me tell you it was a very good movie.
565;A very good movie but not amazing.
566;I loved this movie but I dont understant the people who bill it as the greatest movie ever.
567;The movie has a very good, yet very complex plot that at times is hard to follow.
568;Great action scenes and extreordinary acting make it a four star movie.
569;He is thrust into the real world and fightes for the humans.
570;I highly reccomend it but please dont make such a big deal.
571;What makes a movie is such an intricate and seamless storyline, which this movie really carries.
572;It has a strong psychological aspect, which many will enjoy, not to mention all out action, which all the rest will love.
573;Overall, one of the most thought provoking and wonderful movies I've seen in a long time.
574;I got this for a friend.
575;The Matrix is one of the best movies i've ever seen.
576;Its graphics and special effects were wonderful.
577;When the movie ended, I was stunned!
578;It is one of the best movies of 1999.
579;This movie is the best action movie I have ever seen.
580;The plot is very interesting, and could sustain the film without the action, but wow, the action!!
581;Scenes from the movie will be etched into your mind.
582;My second favorite action sequences are in the movie Heat with Al Pacino and Robert Dinero.
583;If you liked that, you will love Matrix.
584;this film even though it has a beginning and an end is really the first is a series that unfolds a further truth.
585;This is one of the best popcorn movies of the 90's but it is also extremely smart, has a great premise with an intelligent plot, nicely executed action sequences and breath.
586;Keanu Reeves is great in the role of Neo, who carries the responsibility of disconnecting the human race from the Matrix.
587;"Laurence Fishburne is also great as Morpheus
I:8405;588;Hugo Weaving also draws one of the best sci/fi villains as Agent Smith.
I:8405;589;It ultimately succeds in being an extremely entertaining and well done action/Sci.
I:8405;590;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film an 8!
I:8405;591;The Matrix is by far My favorite movie of all time!
I:8405;592;However when I got it home to play it the size of the screen appalled me.
I:8405;593;I've heard people say this is the best movie they've ever seen.
I:8405;594;I don't agree with that, but I do think it's a pretty good movie.
I:8405;595;The effects are great, the story is pretty good (the idea is especially interesting and discussion.
I:8405;596;An ordinary digital life form can be an extraordinary antagonist.
I:8405;597;And with it's amazing characters who aren't just shallow robots following a script, they all have a life and mind and motivations of their own which to this day make me glad to be a part of it all.
I:8405;598;I really enjoy the special effects in this movie!
I:8405;599;When Blade Runner was originally released in 1982, it was considered to be a truly visionary prediction on what the future could hold.
I:8405;600;We knew that technology would have a profound effect on us, but Rigley Scott's masterpiece envisioned technology embodied in the form of human beings.
I:8405;601;James Cameron, who recently sank the Titanic to cash in $$$, also demonstrated vision in the sci.
I:8405;602;forward 17 years from Blade Runner and The Terminator to 1999 and the birth of The Internet.
I:8405;603;Andy and Larry Wachowski take Kubrick's original vision plus 30 years of technological innovation and blow past Scott and Cameron to create what should be considered the best science fiction /action movie that Hollywood has ever made.
I:8405;604;This is a movie that races beyond almost everyone's imagination and the majority of people's comprehension.
I:8405;605;I have spoken to a number of non.
I:8405;606;net savvy people about their thoughts on this movie and most have indicated that although the action sequences were great, they weren't really sure what was going on with the plot.
I:8405;607;for people who understand the potential impact of the Internet on our society, this movie is generally considered to be a thought.
I:8405;608;All three represent relatively easy concepts to understand.
I:8405;609;in addition to the profound subject matter, the Wachowski brothers demonstrate an uncanny knack to combine all of the """"hip"""" elements of our culture into one very slick package."""
610;Many of the great visionary director styles are demonstrated in this super charged flick.
611;The characters are all great (Amazingly .
612;The concept of virtual reality plays perfectly to the suspension of disbelief and this movie soars because of it.
613;The matrix is by far, the greatest movie I have ever watched.
614;I loved every second of this action packed movie.
615;I recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it yet.
616;For those of you who has seen The Matrix, Knows that this movie is an excellent movie and can relate when I gives it the five Thumbs Up award.
617;This is an awesome movie.
618;If you liked this movie, I would also recommend A Midnight Clear.
619;This is exactly what I wanted.
620;A memoir for my self of the epic movie.
621;The special effects were awesome, the story was creative and thought provoking, and the acting was pretty good.
622;At the time the computer graphics were top of the line and now 12 years later they are still quite impressive.
623;The story line is well.
624;developed and like Blade Runner it does bring up questions regarding morals and values.
625;Reeves is surprisingly good in the role of Neo.
626;Still a ground breaking film that was ahead of its time.
627;A very intriguing and thought worthy film that should be seen by science fictions fans and good film fans alike.
628;This compromised the great ideas and transformed the movie into just another box office hit.
629;This movie is so awesome that I try to give it to all my friends so if my wife ever kicks me out of the house from watching this movie too much, I can stay at their house and watch it.
630;this film takes itself a little bit too seriously, but other than that, it is incredibly imaginative, creative, and well executed.
631;He does a decent job, particularly in comparison to his other work.
632;Each film is strong in it's own right but together they flow continuously following the adventures of Neo (Keanu Reeves).
633;ann Moss save him, making the film terrific.
634;Go ahead, take the Red pill.
635;When you enter this realm ot thought the movie opens up fanthoms of enjoyment and excitement.
636;Thanks to the movie industry for giving us a movie that finally makes us think and enjoy at the same time!!!!
637;This movie is one of the best!
638;The matrix is the best movie ever.
639;The Matrix is hands down the best movie to see this year.
640;The special effects are amazing and the story line is unmatched.
641;If you like movies that throw twists at you you will love this movie.
642;This is one of those rare movies which special effects actually made it what it is.
643;it is a very watchable and interesting action adventure,scifi production.
644;i was most impressed by the performance of Carrie.
645;Lots of action and special effects to keep your interest.
646;I give it two thumbs up!
647;I can't necessarily explain why, but I find them just all kinds of fun.
648;It's a story well told, great visual effects, and solid (if not outstanding) acting.
649;I just like to be entertained.
650;if you like action packed movies, this is for you.
651;Always keeping you on the edge of your seat, The Matrix is my favorite movie.
652;i had three dates last summer,and everyone wanted to see this film.
653;the first time was fantastic.
654;it was exciting,but you have to pay attention.
655;laurence Fishburne is the best actor in the movie,and he explans the Matrix to Keanu and the rest of us.
656;I sat there with my jaw open at times at how clear the picture was.
657;It's a very good movie.
658;It gets better with repeats.
659;He will be the one to free the humans from the evil robots.
660;I think the movie had quite a bit of action so action fans should be please.
661;hope this review helped you.
662;This is a brilliant film in some ways.
663;It is brilliant in the technical execution, the pacing, the atmosphere and tension it creates.
664;most of the fascination of this film comes from the American myths it employs to capture the audience.
665;There is the fight for freedom from suppression (what the American Revolution was all about), there is the individual who fights for self.
666;It is right there in front of us on the screen, or rather, in our heads.
667;The Matrix shows us a world that we are supposed to take for real while we are watching.
668;But the film also promotes violence as an attractive and appropriate means for solving problems.
669;In my opinion, the film also asks us to believe that a savior has the right to kill in order to liberate other people from their wrong beliefs.
670;a savior has the right to kill in order to liberate other people from their wrong beliefs.
671;Thousands upon thousands of murders are committed each year.
672;"As much as I admire The Matrix"" as a film, I think the message it conveys and the beauty of its slow."
673;"And to top it all, it presents the man who fires bullets so skilfully as a savior in the Christian vein: ""Neo"", the ""new man"", ""The One"", reborn after having been shot dead, rising to the skies to liberate us all."
674;One of the greatest films to ever hit the big screen.
675;Thank you for your business.
676;Excellent transaction on time at a reasonable price.
677;getting a classic Matrix item at a reasonable price
678;It's action packed, with mind.
679;There isn't a single wasted scene, the movie moves at a breakneck pace and still has great character development.
680;I know that when i put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my mind that it is delicious and juicy.
681;It's got great actors, an awesome plot, great action, great special effects.
682;This movie was an absolute flawless picture.
683;I ordered this movie for an assignment I'm doing for class, but the very first shot reminded me of how much I love this movie!
684;It's so well crafted and paced.
685;It hasn't really aged much either, a few giveaways such as the cell phones date the film, but it all works so well in the context of the world.
686;This is probably one of the best movies that I have ever seen.
687;the beauty of the plot gets you really thinking about 'reality'.
688;The special effects keep you amazed.
689;Had to watch this film for class.
690;The action in this film, plus the story, was really thought out.
691;I think the production aspect of this film was very impressive, and I think this film sets a high standard.
692;Phantom Menace should have won best effects.
693;and most importantly, a story worth telling.
694;or pretending Laurence Fishburn with that oh so sexy voice and darkly cool good looks standing dramatically like a leather bound Nubian King!
695;keanu aside, this movie was awesome, I cant say enough positive things that adequately describe it so Ill just say it is visually stunning, dark and enthralling in parts, creative and watchable.
696;slightly off the track, Ive heard a rumour that the sequel may have the incredibly talented Jet Li (Hes a martial arts megastar up there with Bruce Lee in my humble opinion! )
697;And the ending where he flies off after making the phone call is so absolutely LAME!
698;This movies has it all, ground breaking visual affects, great fight scenes, jarring sound, decent acting and a great story.
699;This is my favorite action movie of all time to date.
700;The film of the 90's, better than Phantom Menance!
701;`The Matrix' released in '99 is in my opinion one of the most original, entertaining and thought.
702;provoking films in the last 20 years and an undisputed classic in the sci.
703;fi, martial arts, action/adventure genres.
704;Initially you'll most likely be overwhelmed by the technological aspects of the film and focus on the computer lingo.
705;However eventually you'll see that it also has a strong spiritual side and realize that is steeped in Eastern mystical philosophy.
706;What a concept!As is the case with most financially success films, `The Matrix' would spawn two sequels.
707;A very captivating film that will grab you and make you say.
708;The effects are amazing and yet the plot is too.
709;HE ONLY HAD LIKE 10 LINES IN THE WHOLE MOVIE!But seriously, this is the best out there in terms of visual effects, sound, and pure imagination.
710;All smooth and constant picture and sound.
711;And for the next 2 installments, let's pray that Keanu shuts up again!
712;Although the acting of Reves can sometimes get annoying it has a good story line, I really enjoyed it the first time I saw it.
713;This movie is one of the most thought provoking movies I've seen to date.
714;There is an excellent mix of sci.
715;fi and action, and the philosophical concepts woven into the mix only enhance the viewing process.
716;"If you have not already seen this movie, please go out and see it
I:8405;717;The movie explodes into action in the first scene and continues forward, never letting up until the end.
I:8405;718;Even if your favorite stars are not in this film, it is a must see!
I:8405;719;The co. directors do a great job of controlling the special effects so that they do not take over the film.
I:8405;720;They also sculpt the scenes in such a way that, by the end of the movie, the viewer can't help but be immersed in the story.
I:8405;721;Again, this is a must see film, I highly reccomend it!
I:8405;722;A well done and visually incredible movie (too bad the second movie wasn't quite as good and the last one stunk!)
I:8405;723;A spectacular plot coupled with unbelieveable action scenes and special effects make The Matrix one of the best science fiction movies of all time.
I:8405;724;This movie would be very good even without the great plot because of it's original action shots.
I:8405;725;The slow motion shots of Neo and the Agent during the fight scene in the subway terminal are the best I've ever seen.
I:8405;726;This is a film that you must see.
I:8405;727;This is a classic movie that is standard viewing in most philosophy classes because of it's parallels to Classic Plato thought.
I:8405;728;Watch this movie, and try not to question your grasp on reality.
I:8405;729;fi movie claims to be the best since Blade Runner,now there is a new standard The Matrix defines the cyberpunk action movie better than any live action movie ever made.
I:8405;730;I have to thanks Amazon for make me so happy!
I:8405;731;This is the best movie ever in all times.
I:8405;732;And this edition is really amazing.
I:8405;733;In addition to the film we get two feature length commentaries.
I:8405;734;The first is by the special effects designer and the editor with additional comments by Carrie Anne Moss.
I:8405;735;The discussion is rather complicated but interesting nevertheless.
I:8405;736;Ms. Moss chimes in rarely to discuss scenes in which she was a principal.
I:8405;737;the second commentary is more interesting.
I:8405;738;He discusses the score and its creation and integration with other non.
I:8405;739;It is interesting to watch the film in this fashion as one does not always get a sense of the great deal of music involved in the film.
I:8405;740;the usual making of special is included and runs around 26 minutes.
I:8405;741;This is a better than average production special and is well worth a look.
I:8405;742;Follow the White Rabbit allows the viewer to see an extended version of the film with nine production featurettes included that deal with the creation of the special effects and fight sequences.
I:8405;743;I've seen the movie in a theatre, at a drive.
I:8405;744;Watching from the comfort of your own home and experiencing the beauty that is dolby digital surround sound is absoulutely the best way to go.
I:8405;745;This is a good, cyber fantasy film, this is a film for everyone.
I:8405;746;Very good special effects, Good story, Good actors, more matrix films coming in the future.
I:8405;747;Only a 1,000 words"
748;Great special effects and really thought provoking.
749;Acting wise, strong acting, I can give it that!
750;The Matrix was better then one star!
751;That's all I have to say!
752;It has superior picture clarity, sound and awesome special effects.
753;the cast is very good.
754;The action scenes were great and the storyline very impressive.
755;the special features are really cool too!
756;I love the way Keanu can dodge those bullets!This movie is excellent in all of it's areas.
757;I strongly recommend this one for those of you with outstanding taste for expensive movies.
758;This is one of the best sci.
759;Great philosophical musings, amazing special effects.
760;I love movies and this one is my new favorite.
761;I saw it for the first time yesterday and I want to watch it again today.
762;It's one of those movies you have to own.
763;The special effects are incredible and the plot is absolutely mind.
764;It really makes you think.
765;The fight scenes were awesome, the script, the actors, the set, everything was fantastic.
766;This is the best movie ever made.
767;This is one of the best movies in a long, long time.
768;You just got to see it!
769;I liked this film better the first time when it was called TRON.
770;For fans of the Matrix it may be.
771;If I can do that, you can see it atleast once.
772;Keanu shines as Neo, Laurence Fishburne brings intelligence and depth to the roll, and Carrie Ann Moss has a great future in films based on this performance.
773;Simply put: I love this movie.
774;With The Matrix , the Wachowski brothers have crossed stunning visuals with an imaginative and intelligent plot.
775;Clearly, they are influenced by John Woo, Jackie Chan, George Lucas as well as several graphic novel artists.
776;Without a doubt, this is still my favorite movie from the last three years.
777;There are a lot of extras including a Making of and interviews with the cast and directors.
778;Truly one of the best films ever conceived on the desktop.
779;Storyline, special effects, even Keanu's acting are superb.
780;Don't be fooled by the start, this movie gets very good.
781;This is one of my favorite sci.
782;fi movies, up there with Minority Report .
783;The action is great, and the effects are breathtaking.
784;This was a great movie.
785;The action is top notch and very innovative.
786;Matrix was a great film.
787;This is one of the few movies that I have watched more than once.
788;A great movie should be inspirational, but can't be too phony.
789;This is a unique approach, a believable fantasy that good conquers evil and that love conquers all.
790;The Matrix is an outstanding movie.
791;The action sequences (my favorite being the shootout in the looby) will leave you breathless.
792;The shippers are very good.
793;I view movies primarily to be entertained.
794;The Matrix is packed with action and visual effects that had me gasping.
795;there are four truly outstanding, memorable performances by the actors: Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus is erie and casts just the right tone of a man who has seen it all.
796;anne Moss is so right for the part of Trinity.
797;The viewer is invited along for the ride.
798;And what a Fun House ride it is!!
799;It's a fun movie and one that I have watched more than once.
800;i'ts cool, it was a great movie!
801;This was one of the best sci.
802;I've seen it about 4 times so far since I have the movie on tape.
803;The movie has a stellar cast and what I really liked is the fact the movie had a storyline with as much punch as the special effects.
804;I highly recommend this movie!
805;Must watch for everyone on the planet.
806;fi action movie Keanu Reeves gets away with being a star character.
807;The Matrix was so innovative and kick.
808;It is intelligently written and, more importantly, the storyline is maintained throughout the entire movie.
809;The special effects are intensely captivating and are, to say the least, stunningly performed.
810;Everytime I watch it, I find another aspect of the film to enjoy.
811;It is, in my opinion, one the most superior sci.
812;Obviously, this is a great movie for special effects.
813;I would recommend this movie to any who don't already own a copy.
814;it's a must own in that respect!
815;Own the movie that changed the world!
816;Because it is still relevant?
817;He told relatable stories to illustrate the truth he was presenting.
818;The Celestine Prophesy is a modern day kickstart of a spiritual movement, told as an action adventure, but revealing new spiritual ideals along the way.
819;This movie marries the Christ myth and the Buddhist philosophy into one narrative.
820;an important consideration to keep in mind, which is not known by the general population, but important for understanding this movie and its cosmic message , is that Christianity is not a pure religion.
821;Sacrifice is a huge theme in pagan mythology and it becomes the core of the Christian belief system even though its founder never focuses on it, his focus was actually universal love.
822;Neo and Agent Smith are actually one, which is played out in the next two installments of the Matrix trilogy.
823;The Ego wants to rule the world but the soul desires connection, a true communion with the Divine.
824;In order to do this, Neo must wrestle with Agent Smith, overcome the ego, the shadow, by becoming one with it, and step into his power of divinely connected human, transcending all illusion.
825;so what has this got to do with you?
826;Neo illustrates this when he begins to master The Matrix.
827;Stepping back from the illusion, seeing it as a canvas which allows you to create upon it by harnessing your mind, making the mind work for you, rather than allowing the ego to run you with fear dramas.
828;This is the key to enlightenment.
829;Dreams speak in metaphor, the language of the unconscious, and it is from the unconscious that we must awaken to be present to our own Matrix.
830;Morpheus, the God of dreams, is one of your greatest teachers.
831;This is a really powerful name for a powerful player in this story, because the entire point of The Matrix is to awaken from it.
832;Cipher pretends to be on your side to inform you, but is actually planning your demise by engaging you in mental games and enhancing the need to gratify the ego.
833;Switch tells us that we are going to get turned on, we are going to see the light.
834;She is a part of The Matrix, living in both worlds.
835;She is personable, kind, she bakes cookies, she is someone you can interact with and talk with.
836;She is surrounded by children who are gifted adepts, able to manipulate The Matrix at will.
837;She gives each person a key to the puzzle, which in the end, all fit together.
838;She is approachable and speaks plainly even though she is revered by others.
839;All these names are significant.
840;Guns and bullets, the great equalizing balance between the powerful and the weak, as long as both sides are well armed.
841;crisis is often times, the invitation to transform.
842;Whatever you run away from, you will run into.
843;This is what Neo does, he runs right into the confrontation with Smith, there he goes beyond time and space to emerge as master of both his ego and The Matrix.
844;Watch it more than once with this in mind in order to appreciate the subtle nuances, which support all of us in becoming capable of shifting our reality.
845;This is really a movie of the new age, heralding limitless possibilities, where we are the creators of our own worlds.
846;Possessing a truly original plot and splendid visuals, this film was one of the few must.
847;see films of the year .
848;this widescreen release on video more than does justice to the big screen experience .
849;Being driven as it is by its visuals and luscious special effects, you don't want the inevitable losses that come with conversion to pan.
850;to sum up, this is a great film and the conversion to video is terrific.
851;Just shared it with my boys for the first time and they loved it (I loved it again too even after all these years).
852;This is one of the types of movies that would look best in Blu.
853;I never pay extra for special editions, but I really liked this one.
854;It was a landmark movie, and I enjoy having this memento of it.
855;ray, it has the extras on it.
856;This is the top best action film ever.
857;this is an excellent movie.
858;i love the way you have to go see it twice just because the first time you see it you have to wait till the end to get it by then its over.
859;keanu is an awesome actor.
860;This movie was pretty much over all one of the best movies I have ever seen.
861;It's not only a movie about guns and the end of the world, it's also a type of a love story between two characters.
862;I founthis movie enjoyable and ESPECIALLY ACTION PACKED!
863;I hope you enjoy it!
864;Before seeing this movie I thought Keanu couldn't act, but the Matrix let's his talents shine through.
865;Superb cast with special effects which do not smother the plot.
866;I really enjoy watching this movie over and over again.
867;READERS: This movie is powerful, it is extraordinary, it genuinely has the power to make your mind feel like it is being taken on a trip to a land that is terrifying.
868;this movie is a classic, holds up after many many many viewings, like any classic should.
869;The best delivery service and one of the best films ever made.
870;The Wachowski duo, is a duo to remember, they are the heart and soul of this film.
871;I was mind boggled from the outstanding visuals I saw in the beggining of this film.
872;The idea that humans are used as batteries astounds me.
873;This film is most definitly The Best Science Fiction EVER.
874;I have loved this movie since I saw it for the 1st time when it 1st came out.
875;Wonderful effects, fresh innovative story, and a handsome star.
876;Oh well, still a very awesome flick.
877;like following this series has attracted, as though this film contains amazing universal truths previously undiscovered by our benighted species.
878;importance that is truly nauseating at times.
879;importance of this movie reminds me of the comic.
880;and my goodness, does this movie ever revel in its special effects, to the point of almost drowning the audience in them.
881;well it won 3 Academy Awards (beating Star Wars Episode 1 in all catagories), it has revived the career of Keanu Reeves (that left acting to pursue his music career, Dogstar), has elivated Carrie.
882;Rumors say that Jet Li will be in it, check it out!
883;I was surprised that i liked this movie as much as I did.
884;The special effects are unrivaled in my opinion.
885;In fact, as special effects are SUPPOSED to do, it made you think that it might actually be happening somewhere.
886;Great action movie with thrilling scenes, plot and excellent actors.
887;It also offers a deep reflections on how virtual reality may indeed transform human beings, and what is the real core of being human.
888;One of the best science fictions to have been released ever.
889;Good script, good execution, good acting.
890;Everything is good about the movie.
891;I bought this film on the first day it was released after being captivated by it's storyline and style at the cinema.
892;Fishburne acts brilliantly, along with Carrie.
893;Absolutely everyone should see this film.
894;For a fiction to work out well.
895;If you're looking for science fiction with solid plot structure, go for them classic 70's sci.
896;fi flick that goes well of its mixture with fantasy elements.
897;i'm a major fan of the sci.
898;It has something for everyone.
899;still it stands head and shoulders above most of the sci.
900;It has terrific sound and amazing special effects.
901;The story is very compelling and the movie pulls it off nicely with only a few cliches and quirks.
902;It is a great action movie with the best visual effects i have ever seen.
903;this is with out a doubt the best movie that's ever been done.
904;it's a possible future, that the world starts over and the machines will take over the planet.
905;Do you want great sound or a great film ?
906;The sound is brilliant but the movie is average.
907;A great one to borrow from your mates for a while wihtout paying for it !
908;written and Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (Assassins, Bound, The Martix Reloaded, The Martix Revolations) made a terrific, unique, Sci.
909;This film has Win 4 Academy Awards (Winner of all Nominations) including:Best Visual Effects, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Sound Editing.
910;This film has Some of the Best.
911;This film has become a Modern Day.
912;Very rarely have I watched a movie that was both exciting and intellectually stimulating.
913;But the overarching themes of the film are definitely Christian.
914;But beyond this, the film is a technical masterpiece.
915;The visual effects are stunning.
916;I'm not saying that the acting is simply superb and is Oscar worthy but the special effects are what all the buzz is about.
917;Also, when every karate move is shot, they are made into a piece of art.
918;One day, he finds a message on his computer.
919;There he meets Trinity (brilliantly played by Carrie Anne Moss) a girl who will tell Mr. Anderson the secrets of the Matrix.
920;One event leads into another.
921;The band of rebels include Morpheous, the wise leader and father figure.
922;This is also the best of the Matrix trilogy and is a must have for fans of sci.
923;The effects are unbelieveable, the story is great but a little confusing, but overall it is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
924;The widescreen isnt that small, so you can actually see the movie.
925;The special features in the movie are ok which include follow the white rabbit.
926;I like this special feature the best.
927;The acting is also great in this movie.
928;I hope to see more movies like this one in the future.
929;this is freakin' great, right now you can get the Blu.
930;where else except through Amazon are you going to find such a great deal on a movie trilogy, especially on Blu.
931;The Matrix is simply the best film i've ever seen.
932;Keanu Reeves gives a stunning performance as Neo and Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus.
933;this movie has it all kung .
934;KEANU REEVES stands out as super hero NEO, best movie he will ever make , good pick for lead role .
935;over all great movie .
936;best of all a very lovable AGENT SMITH stands miles above the rest as a program that hunts down .
937;and enjoy them for years to come.
938;With a mix of Cyber Punk and Asian Action Matrix delivers a rare combination of where we're going and where we've been with pure fantansy.
939;believable and the fight scenes unreal!!
940;But I will say that this is one of the best movies I have seen in a long long time.
941;the visuals are unbelievably crisp and the sound is very very good.
942;You finally get to see how they do that incredible freeze.
943;frame surround effect, and they also show the actors learning martial arts.
944;as well as thousands of other people.
945;this movie is the best of the trilogy because it can stand on its own, and makes sense after watching it.
946;The last two, while really cool, take a few more viewings as well as a few searches on the internet to really make sense of the plot.
947;the concept of The Matrix isn't really anything new, but the way it was done was amazing and made you think.
948;The action was great, and the characters were fantastic.
949;In the top 5 sci.
950;If you're into a movie that gives your brain a good going over, with twists and turns and amazing special FX, then The Matrix is the one for you.
951;It boasts stars like Samuel L Jackson and Keanu Reeves, who has, I think revived his flagging movie career with this movie.
952;The Matrix also sets the scene for those who are fashion conscious.
953;The very slick costumes and sunglasses add to the very cool, futuristic feel of the film.
954;(fans of Manson and Rammstein will love the music).
955;All in all, I found The Matrix to be a very polished, thought provoking movie about our present and future society and the Big Brother complex that we seem to have in this technological age.
956;I was surprised at how well this holds up.
957;It is rather amazing to realize that everything you've seen in action movies for the last 15 years comes from this.
958;Great picture and fantastic sound.
959;ray and have watched this great sci.
960;fi action classic many, many times.
961;But now I have access to The Matrix anytime (thanks to Wi.
962;I watched this movie yesterday and it looked and played great on my Kindle Fire.
963;5 Stars for being a thrilling movie and looking/sounding good on my Fire.
964;good for the special effects.
965;but there are some totally awesome special effects which are worth watching for their music.
966;the concept is definitely sweet.
967;to be wearing such nice pvc outfits.
968;so i got the matrix.
969;it's nice here and there.
970;One of the best movies ever!!!
971;trinity takes it out and Morpheus tells neo everything.
972;It is so much more than a movie.
973;When I first watched this film and was impressed with it's great detailed artwork, of course that was in 1999 now those kind of graphics are soso compared to some.
974;This movie contains a great story line and great actors.
975;well that's just the point.
976;the matrix contains some of the greatest camerawork, cinematography, and audacious angles in movie history.
977;Its interesting to see just how the amazing visuals of the film were pulled off.
978;The special effects are more revolutionary than Star Wars, the action is suberb, most of the acting rocks, and the plot is spectacular.
979;The plot, which I consider to be one of the most important aspects of a movie, is great because you can see both sides.
980;That sums up why this movie is so great.
981;You can see the point of view of all sides, and the whole thing is enhanced by everything else in the movie.
982;This is quite simply the greatest movie ever made.
983;The Matrix was the most popular R. rated film when it came out in the theaters, and it has reason to be so.
984;ann Moss as Trinity gives a good screen presence, and pulls off a tough.
985;tender mix in her character.
986;Laurence Fishburne is very good as Morpheus, even though he is in manacles for a good part of the film.
987;This masterful actor can convulse the audience with his drawn.
988;the Wachowski brothers, the directors and writers of the film, handle it well with good camera angles and a fine screenplay.
989;for those searching for thrills and a heavy slant toward visual effects, this is a good movie to look into.
990;If you are a collector of movie memorabilia or a huge fan of Keanu, this is a must have for you.
991;This movie has fabulous special effects, and great fight scenes.
992;It puts you in another world and keeps you there from start to finish.
993;A must for anyone who even remotely likes sci.
994;The Matrix not only has a cool, cyberpunk, hyper stylized look and jaw.
995;dropping special effects, it also features an intelligent story that is often overlooked by the mindless action junkies.
996;The story unfolds at a feverish pace while we, the viewers, are given the thrill ride of a lifetime.
997;She's an expert hacker and an ally to Morpheus, a mysterious man that the authorities are after.
998;You believe that you are special, that somehow the rules do not apply to you.
999;When he answers it he hears, for the first time, the voice of Morpheus.
1000;"He's taken into the custody of several strange agents, who interrogate him and plant him with a ""bug""."
1001;"neo wakes up the next day believing that all the events of the previous day had been a dream, until he gets a phone call from Morpheus who cryptically tells Neo that he is ""The One""."
1002;Morpheus tells Neo of a techno.
1003;mystical prophecy that one day a man will be born who will liberate humankind and end the war between the living and the mechanical.
1004;He is also taught how to adapt his mind so that when he next enters the Matrix, he will be able to fortify himself for protection as well as bypass the laws of physics (mainly gravity).
1005;But they also face great obstacles, both in and out of the Matrix.
1006;He is capable of experiencing human emotions such as ambition, pride, and a general contempt for all organic living things.
1007;What makes The Matrix so fascinating is that it combined this metaphysical idea with modern technology, contemporary politics, social counterculture, and martial arts action.
1008;The iconic characters are played to perfection by a talented cast including Keanu Reeves as Neo, Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, Carrie.
1009;It is a high energy, thought provoking modern masterpiece.
1010;ray] has more features than I will be able to watch anytime soon.
1011;Very impressed will the case art, it stands out among the rest of my BD's.
1012;This is a really cool movie about a guy named Neo that's offered to go into The Matrix.
1013;He becomes on of their strongest fighters.
1014;I'm not going to give it away but if you like action/fighting movies you'll love this one!
1015;This movie is a perfect mix of those hard core action fans and those deep thought movie fans.
1016;ray transfer is as good as they, perhaps, have heard.Yes, it is .
1017;The sound also is outstanding.
1018;I've seen this movie three times now and I swear I heard a lot of background talk and stuff I never heard before.
1019;Anyway for a film staring Keanu Reeves who i usualy dont think is very good i think he does star in this film realy well.
1020;If you like the good old sci fi films i think this has to be the film for 99.
1021;not since _Brazil_ have I seen a film worth watching multiple times while it was still in theaters.
1022;"i give the film my highest possible recommendation
I:8405;1023;After having seen Matrix, I felt spiritually relieved, satisfied with life, strong and compelled to do good to all living beings.
I:8405;1024;I figured that it might be that the final message of Matrix is that good overcomes evil, love instills life in the seemingly dead, that helping and fighting for God will succeed in the end.
I:8405;1025;trinity, the Holy Spirit, love, the mother, notice how the movie does not mention sex at all .
I:8405;1026;She has always full trust in Neo and gives him food where none other does.
I:8405;1027;as a means to awaken Neo and others, a gentle and compassionate God, giving humans the offer of using their free will in the choice of waking up to Him!
I:8405;1028;player for it, allthough it truly belongs to the thx theatre!This is my best movie experience ever!!!
I:8405;1029;It's still impressive now if you remember how little they had in the way of special effects when they were making this movie.
I:8405;1030;fi film of many aficionados of the genre.
I:8405;1031;I can also see why a few people dislike it.
I:8405;1032;I think it is worthy of the adjective """"classic"""", but it also has a few flaws."""
1033;day cyberworld twists are added, including the rise of machines with artificial intelligence and the preference that some people (many people?)
1034;It also is a bit hard to believe that human bodies are good generators of energy, the explanation given for why the evil geniuses are keeping so many humans alive with their brains trapped in the artificial world.
1035;"By contrast ""Blade Runner"", my favorite sci."
1036;Given his persona, the way he carries himself and his manner of speaking, he would seem best cast as a laid.
1037;the best performance in The Matrix by far is Laurence Fishburne in the role of Morpheus.
1038;Admittedly this is an even more heroic role than Reeves' character of Neo, but Fishburne does an outstanding job with it.
1039;"He truly commands the screen with his presence, actions and voice
I:8405;1040;Many of the supporting roles are also well.
I:8405;1041;all in all """"The Matrix"""" is definitely worth seeing if you happen to have been living in a cave for the past 13 years and haven't yet seen it."""
1042;visually amazing, well put together, clever, intelegent script.
1043;This i believe is the best sci.
1044;fi film (modern) of them all.
1045;This is a great movie.
1046;The first time I watched this movie, I thought it was pretty good.
1047;The second time through I sat and wondered why on earth I ever thought it was good.
1048;One of the best plots in movie history.
1049;Be that as it may, this film blew everyone away the summer of 1999, myself included.
1050;blowing visual effects are worth watching again and again and again.
1051;Laurence Fishbune is fantastic as Morpheus, the leader of the human resistance.
1052;This film began the Matrix trilogy, and is easily the best of the three.
1053;This movie kept me on the edge of my seat all the time it has great special effects and it has a ton of fighting sceenes.
1054;I discovered something new every time I saw it.
1055;The second time I watched it I learned a little about the story but was still stunned by the special effects.
1056;After watching it 7 times I finally learned that the story is just as brilliant!!
1057;If the VHS version is this good.
1058;Special efects, actors, costumes, edition and specially the plot are awesome.
1059;This is 100% science fiction and yet so true.
1060;The main movie is great too with extra scenes deleted from tv, and enhanced picture.
1061;Obviously, we all know the story of the matirx, a man realizes that his world is a computer simulation, and a man named morpoheus is set to free him from the program , because he believes he is the one who can put an end to it.
1062;But the machines were clever.
1063;It feels strange, he always has the feeling that he is dreaming because.
1064;But before they do that, he has to convince Tom Anderson he's special and that he can do a lot more than what he believes.
1065;what we have here is one of the most interesting and intelligent science fiction films of all times.
1066;I've always liked Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne, but they practically seem like they were born for these roles!
1067;And this film is quite a treat for both the eyes and the brain.
1068;fi, and more especially, if you're into intelligent films, this one's for you!
1069;I loved this movie and I can't recomend this enough to any fan of the actors or actresses in the movie.
1070;Product is an awesome item.
1071;Think beyond what you see.
1072;So if any of you know who does this piece, please email at neo2787@hotmail.
1073;It was excellent for that purpose.
1074;If you look deeply into it and analyze it, the movie has a good lesson.
1075;I got into an argument about this movie with a friend's daughter.
1076;She's only 18 and ignorant, me 42 and wise.
1077;She of course trashed Blade Runner and loved Matrix, which is another story.
1078;One of the most satisfying movie experiences of all time, `The Matrix' will most likely be remembered.
1079;The film is so much more than an action movie, giving us a deep and involving plot that challenges the audience to think hard about what's really going on.
1080;the special affects are out of this world, and the concept is one we've never entertained so it's fresh and exciting.
1081;`The Matrix' is that movie that started a movement, that movie that is beloved and followed and worshiped and campaigned as of one the greatest achievements in cinema and is surely one of the more respected films of our generation.
1082;It raises some interesting questions about the nature of reality and our relationship with technology.
1083;This film has held up extremely well over the last decade.
1084;To this day it keeps me on the edge of my seat, and I'm still blown away by it.
1085;it is unnecessary to mention that MATRX is an excellent movie because we already know that t got 4 academy awards.
1086;there are several interesting themes in this film.
1087;tecnological advantages disadvantages , friendship ,love.
1088;The Matrix is my favorite movie of all time!
1089;The special effects are incredible and the plot is cool.
1090;hero which constitutes much of The Matrix has certainly attracted its share of reclusive techno.
1091;philosophical concepts thrown together to impress and flatter.
1092;True, the movie is an apt metaphor of our world.
1093;So, basically, we are being fed the stuff to keep us quiet.
1094;And remember, as Lenin said .
1095;fi flick until you do.
1096;i thought this movie had a great story.
1097;the story is a good one all the same.
1098;The Matrix is the most incredible movie I've ever seen.
1099;It has incredible action and character developement.
1100;This movie beautifully puts together a scifi with an action movie.
1101;The special effects are amazing.
1102;I love science fiction movies, and I think the matrix is one of the greatest movies in this genre.
1103;matrix is, admittedly, a lot of fun, even if it lacks the maturity of eXisTenz or the more pure Sci/Fi attitude of Thirteenth Floor.
1104;Kind of like what if our life is just a dream of the fantasy and science fiction novels of not so long ago.
1105;Keanu Reeves, in the computer generated world, should have been able to come up with something similarly fantastic.
1106;One of the classic sci.
1107;fi/cyberpunk storylines is that our perceived reality is actually an illusion.
1108;Those who have enjoyed variations on this theme (Total Recall and Brazil come to mind) will be on familiar ground here.
1109;What makes The Matrix so enticing is the latest use of computer.
1110;assisted special effects, particularly bullet.
1111;i will always prefer to watch movies in big.
1112;screen cinemas with the best sound system available.
1113;Otherwise, watching a fun movie like The Matrix at home on a big.
1114;screen TV with an equally excellent sound system makes it just as worthwhile.
1115;The added benefit of commentaries, behind.
1116;As for Macs, OS9 will take care of everything.
1117;The Matrix is an awesome movie.
1118;If I ever need a good sci.
1119;fi action it is there with open arms.
1120;Even though The Matrix was released in 1999, it can easily be considered the first motion picture of the twenty.
1121;The special effects, with an exception or two, were unprecedented in terms of their scope, style, and presentation at the time, and the somewhat complex plot managed to capture the imagination of untold numbers of movie goers.
1122;Combining science fiction, action, and adventure in an entirely new way, The Matrix was nothing if not exceedingly cool.
1123;I will say, however, that I'm a little surprised that so many people embraced this movie with open arms because the plot is somewhat ambiguous, and the ending seemed to invite the possibility of a sequel without coming right out and announcing that it would happen.
1124;anne Moss also blessed the character of Trinity with a humanity that enriches the film.
1125;Keanu Reeves overcomes a couple of what I like to call David Schwimmer moments early on and grows into the type of hero this movie demands.
1126;as for the special effects, I found them exceedingly good but perhaps a tad overrated.
1127;"like movement of bullets toward the end looks a little hokey to me
I:8405;1128;The movie commentary offers more insight into the movie, and the music.
I:8405;1129;only audio track is also a nice touch.
I:8405;1130;As time marches on, this has changed a little bit, but age should only enhance the fascination of movie lovers with this very impressive, unique, and extraordinarily cool film that heralded a brand new century in movie.
I:8405;1131;The Matrix, an amazing and unique sci.
I:8405;1132;fi thriller from the Wachowski brothers stunned the world.
I:8405;1133;It had a unique concept, in addition to remarkable and fresh visual and special efffects.
I:8405;1134;now the premise of this film is probably the hardest to explain,for it surely is intricate and complicated.
I:8405;1135;The film intruced a fascination effect called Bullet.
I:8405;1136;The action in this movie was innovative and inventive, and certainly appealing, from amazing kung.
I:8405;1137;though in comparison to the sequels, the origianly remains the best.
I:8405;1138;Of course in terms of action, the sequels definetly win especially Reloaded which featured the amazing """"burly brawl"""" and """"freeway chase sequence."""""""
1139;Revolutions also featured the amazing battle in Zion, which was groundbreaking in digital animation.
1140;The sequels are a worth addition to the trilogy though and are definetly worth owning too, by the way Revolutions comes out on April 6, 2004.
1141;The violence includes a lot of gunplay, including the amazing Lobby shootout sequence.
1142;The Matrix is suitable for kids 14 and up probably, for the violence isn't over the top.
1143;In my opinion, it IS the best!
1144;They were good at their time but now its The Matrix's time to shine.
1145;Special Effects are common in movies but in this movie they make you go wow.
1146;If you know what I mean then you to know that it was cool as well.
1147;I give it 5 stars for THE MATRIX itself and 5 stars for the bonus features.
1148;awesome thought provoking, intense, romantic, all of the things that make a movie memorable.
1149;This is a movie that will make you think hard, watch it!
1150;It is an awesome movie.
1151;sure, I had a good time in front of my TV during two hours !
1152;if you want to show your culture, at least verify your sources : Know Yourself isn't a Latin sentence but was, Plato dixit, one of the favorite sentences of his Master Socrates.
1153;I just wanted ot add to the reams of people who feel as I do that it is an amazing film.
1154;It was a refreshing change to standard action movies, it has something new and I think many films will seek to copy it's style in the years to come.
1155;The sound is awesome, the picture is excellent, and there are some really nice extras too.
1156;THE MATRIX was the best movie of 1999, you must get it!
1157;A lot of the reviews of this very entertaining film mention the various sources it draws from: other films, comics, cyberpunk fiction (particularly that of William Gibson.)
1158;The real source of the foundation concept of The Matrix is the brilliant 1968 Sci.
1159;Read the book (one of the best SF stories ever written, by one of the most influential SF writers ever) and you'll know what I'm talking about.
1160;fi fan you might love this.
1161;I'm actually astounded by how many people took the time to write a review.
1162;Anyway, I will give this film the two stars for its ground.
1163;That said, I cannot for the life of me understand what so many people find so fascinating about this film.
1164;star reviews and it never ceases to amaze me.
1165;"I loved The Wachowski Brothers' first film ""Bound""."
1166;This movie is perfection, both as a science fiction film and as a movie in general.
1167;Still remember going with my friends to see this movie I'd never heard of at the theater when it came out.
1168;I vividly recall having my mind completely blown away by both the story and the special effects.
1169;A good bit of it is believable, but not when Neo gets shot twelve times and is alive just because some girl kisses him.
1170;This hit asks the question Gee, are we living a life every day that is a part of our imagination?
1171;The special effects are especially good, but having the same gun.
1172;If you love action movies you must have the matrix.
1173;This is the best action.
1174;adventure movie i have ever seen.
1175;It is exciting, and great!
1176;This is, by far, the best combination of complex/fascinating plot, action, special effects and acting ever created.
1177;The special effects were one in a million (ooooh bullet time, one of the best concieved peices of special effects since Star Wars), as was the acting.
1178;Keaunu Reeves was his usual charismatic self (whoah), Laurence Fishburne was brilliant as the mysterious Moebious and local actor Hugo Weaving was brilliant as the evil construct of the Matrix.
1179;Seeing Sydney in an International film like this was particularly entertaining, always trying to spot landmarks that we knew and loved was an extra bonus.
1180;All in all this movie was an entertaining sci.
1181;If you haven't seen the Matrix, you definitely need to do so.
1182;If you have, it's definitely worth another viewing.
1183;This movie blew my mind back when it came out, and it was great to watch it from the comfort of my own home with my girlfriend, who had never seems it.
1184;He'll make a huge hit movie, follow up with a couple of bombs and then step into another role and make it a smash hit.
1185;fi treat is filled with incredible action sequences, GREAT special effects and an interesting story that you need to see more that once to catch all its hidden secrets.
1186;fi story with interesting biblical references (the character named Trinity, Neo being the One chosen to save mankind, as examples) draws you in and keeps you wanting more.
1187;It also has a really good supporting cast, including Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne Moss.
1188;fi fan or a Keanu Reeves fan to enjoy this film.
1189;The Story line being quite complex however, so you might have to sit down and watch this one a few times.
1190;What can i say about the The Matrix, well it's the best movie of 1999.
1191;If you haven't seen this movie, go see it now!
1192;Remembered why I loved it when it first came out.
1193;"The Matrix has done that to me
I:8405;1194;The scipt was incredible in that it managed to put some complicated concepts into very simple, easy to understand lines .
I:8405;1195;delivered in a sequence of events that helped to illustrate those concepts.
I:8405;1196;The character development was superb .
I:8405;1197;If you are into special effects, breath.
I:8405;1198;taking action and maximum sound, this is the movie for you.
I:8405;1199;The special effects (such as the pausing of action as the camera angle changes as well as the slowing and increasing speeds of action sequences)are truly the first of its kind , and has already started to be copied by new movies coming out.
I:8405;1200;I never thought I would like a movie with K. Reeves, but he is actually very good in this movie.
I:8405;1201;fi thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and lift you out of the seat in its action.
I:8405;1202;Part of my classics collection, now on blu ray.
I:8405;1203;As you get to the end of the film, all the bits come into place and then you'll understand what the film is about!
I:8405;1204;This is a spectacular movie with outstanding visual effects!
I:8405;1205;It is by far my favorite movie of all time!
I:8405;1206;Although the plot is a little fuzzy, the action and visual effects(not special effects) are outstanding.
I:8405;1207;The Matrix is a movie that is in a class of its own.
I:8405;1208;It forces you to keep your eyes glued to the screen to see what will take place next.
I:8405;1209;With its unmatched special effects and grade A acting it's easy to see why The Matrix was such a critical as well as a box.
I:8405;1210;site I surmise that there's not much new that can be really said about it, other than it's a great film and a landmark in sci.
I:8405;1211;Having had a quick look through all the reviews for this film, it seems that there is a general consensus that it's a great film.
I:8405;1212;Yes, I admit that the fight scenes are excellent, breathing new life into screen combat.
I:8405;1213;It really wants to be a philosophical allegory, including bits on religion and Alice In Wonderland etc etc.
I:8405;1214;The extras are copious and well put together, with the White Rabbit feature quite fun along with a great documentary on the filming of the bullet time technology, all wrapped up in some snazzy menus (but the commentary is quite tedious).
I:8405;1215;Still, it has its moments.
I:8405;1216;Although I didn't find this film to be as profound as many of the other reviewers did, it is certainly clever and very smartly written.
I:8405;1217;I was impressed at how smoothly the Wachowskis managed to fit the conventions of martial arts films into a technological context.
I:8405;1218;The story is pure comic book.
I:8405;1219;and I mean that in the best sense of the word.
I:8405;1220;A seemingly average guy meets some mysterious types who introduce him to the reality behind our everyday world and becomes a superhero to battle the evil he finds there.
I:8405;1221;One of the most interesting facets of the story is the fact that our heroes exist in two worlds simultaneously.
I:8405;1222;It has been some time since I have seen a great movie, however this past weekend I bought a movie titled the Matrix.
I:8405;1223;Most movies today have poor acting but this movie has great acting.
I:8405;1224;destroy humanity"""" theme a couple of times, notably the progenitor of the notion in """"The Forbin Project""""."""
1225;"The ""Terminator"" series shares the concept as well."
1226;Add to that unprecedented originality the perfect storyline and dialog to bring it to you and you're almost there.
1227;Layer on the cinematic beauty of the film itself and the remarkable special effects and you have a one.
1228;a. kind work of art.
1229;This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
1230;essential film for the end of the millennium, this is it.
1231;fiction, nerve pounding action and philosophical allegory, a movie in which content and style are so in synch.
1232;Keanu Reeves (surprisingly cool in Jet Li mode) stars as Thomas Anderson, a mild.
1233;"the film was written and directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski, whose sexy, stylish film noir ""Bound"" was an extremely promising debut."
1234;The plot is very interesting: it's an exploration of how much we can or can not trust what our minds sense as reality.
1235;With plenty of imagination ant the first.
1236;rate SFX to support it, they crafted one of the most visually stunning films ever.
1237;offy: it always feels natural within the film's universe.
1238;I also love the idea that the characters are able to download knowledge unto their brains.
1239;The Wachowski had the particularly brilliant brainchild to have their heroes use this technique to turn themselves into experts at jiu.
1240;"This is in part what makes ""The Matrix"" so special."
1241;It's the kind of movie that never stops surprising you.
1242;"In a way, ""The Matrix"" is about the magic of cinema itself, about how filmmakers like the Wachowski bros simulate reality and have the power to bend its rules to fit their vision."
1243;Even the way in which the Village Roadshow logo appears at the beginning of the screening is good!
1244;Carrie Anne Moss starts the movie with a solid and heavy act, clearing her way through four groups of guys(agents)in suits to jump from building to building.
1245;As much as I love the movie, Keanu does slightly overact and Carrie Anne Moss goes a bit over the top aswell.
1246;Laurence Fishbourne does an accurate job as 'Morphious' in what to me is definately the best sci.
1247;fi film ever made(and the Star Wars films are sci.
1248;fi)There is a storyline, although I must admit that it does drag on a bit, but we are rewarded with more than expected special effects which in its style has never been seen before in Hollywood(the world)The effects are packed throughout the entire film in a very clever way.
1249;The matrix will surely bring a lot of ideas into the minds of new and future directors and scriptwriters.
1250;The sequel is something to look forward to.
1251;Every minute interleaves so well with the rest of the movie, that if you leave for a bathroom break, be sure to pause the movie or else you'll miss something important.
1252;One of the better movies I've seen.
1253;This movie was an outstanding modern day example of Plato's Allegory of the cave theory, also known as Plato's Divided Line theory.
1254;You will be in awe throughout the movie!
1255;The first and the best of the trio of the Matrix movies.
1256;He learns that his life has merely been part of a computer.
1257;The humans dream their lives away while the machines siphon off their biological energy to power their world.
1258;the movie borrows elements from Tron and injects philosophical and martial arts aspects.
1259;Many of the special effects are outstanding, as are the physical combat scenes between the heroic humans and the sadistic agents (computer programs that serve as assassins).
1260;it is still wonderful storytelling.
1261;The end of the movie is, actually, only the beginning of the story.
1262;Each time I watch it, I pick up more and more allusions to other literary works and historical/biblical references, and each new discovery adds to the amazing power of the movie.
1263;Recommended to all action fans and also a great literary movie.
1264;The effects soon become irrelevent particularly as as technology improves all films will be able to look like the Matrix but I hope at least some will provide a better use of 2 hours.
1265;The special effects were amazing.
1266;Anybody who has not seen this movie should see it.
1267;But, if that's the case, I can make this recommendation: watch this one and forget the other two exist.
1268;alone movie, it was great.
1269;The sequels, well, how to put this lightly.
1270;It was a refreshing change.
1271;Well directed, good story line, and exceptionally successful, even with the surprising and welcome lack of a superfluous and unneccessary nude scene (thank you very much :Reloaded for proving that you somehow feel obligated to throw it in there anyway).
1272;It just proves that a good storyline goes a long way.
1273;"And to that person I say, ""you're welcome!"""
1274;Yes, the special effects are incredible, but for the love of pete people, Total Recall already did the whole what we see may only be illusion concept (and Descartes did it much further back with Meditations on First Philosophy).
1275;If you want to watch a mindless sci fi shoot 'em up action flick and still think you are smart because it has such a deep meaning behind it, then by all means see this movie.
1276;At least that has something interesting to say about memory and the idea of narrative structure.
1277;There are only two things about this movie that I will mention:One .
1278;very unique and quite disturbing story .
1279;Let's hope that second chapter is as good as the original.
1280;This has got to be the best movie I've seen all year.
1281;the Matrix really gets you thinking, and keeps you thinking.
1282;There is NOTHING like this movie, and it is definatly worth watching.
1283;Great Sci Fi, AI, Future, Cool fashion, Spec.
1284;One of the greatest movies ever made.
1285;On the surface you say a pretty good movie, however, you are always on the outside looking in.
1286;Because we are so comfortable here, we don't try to break out and get away from the control of these machines.
1287;the special effects in the movie are great and are well used.
1288;The fighting sequences and the jump sequences when the camera spins 360 degrees around the person are really cool.
1289;There is a scene where someone in the group has to be rescued from the Agents(machines in human form in the Matrix) and the effects of the gunfire and destruction are some of the best you will see.
1290;interesting, how much this movie references Christianity and the Bible.
1291;in general, the Matrix is a very slick sci.
1292;fi thriller with lots of action, a cool storyline, and lots of effects which are real fun.
1293;I recommend this film for any action fan's shelf.
1294;ray upgrade, I found this nominally acceptable.
1295;above average performance (for its class).
1296;I mention this because your experience of this media will almost certainly vary depending on the type of display and the type of player.
1297;on the whole, I do feel I got an upgrade: the images had a sharpness and a depth that improves upon the non Blue.
1298;"ray version
I:8405;1299;Not a lot, mind you.
I:8405;1300;still, I hope this helps.
I:8405;1301;This is one of the best action movies of the 20th Century.
I:8405;1302;It has a great story and the best action sequences i have ever seen.
I:8405;1303;The soundtracks are also amazing.
I:8405;1304;The first thing I noticed with this movie was the sound, it absolutely explodes with it.
I:8405;1305;The special effects are amazing, they are the real star of this movie.
I:8405;1306;This is one of those films that grabs you and sucks you in.
I:8405;1307;The story is a little far fetched but, thats what makes it fun.
I:8405;1308;If you like action, this film is for you!
I:8405;1309;The Matrix is a wonderful thrill ride for the viewer.
I:8405;1310;The intertwining of the fight choreography, and the special effects is superb.
I:8405;1311;It is a visually stunning movie.
I:8405;1312;The philosophical debate on what is real is as old as Plato.
I:8405;1313;In short if you are looking for originality and deep thoughts stop going to the movies and pick up a book.
I:8405;1314;The mixture of a cyberpunk story with Hong Kong style action makes for a fun movie.
I:8405;1315;This is one of the best of the 90's.
I:8405;1316;Very similar to another film called Dark City , in the sense that it makes you question what is real.
I:8405;1317;The special affects are mind blowing, especially if you get to experience it with high end video and audio.
I:8405;1318;Great extra's on the disk as well.
I:8405;1319;The Matrix is an action packed sci.
I:8405;1320;fi epic that has all the elements of a graphic comic novel jammed with incredible visual effects and the most spetacular action scenes to hit the screen since Terminator 2:Judgment Day.
I:8405;1321;this is one of my all time favorites due to the fact that the film is packed with a cast that we can cheer for.
I:8405;1322;hugo Weaving makes a very impressive villain known as Agent Smith.
I:8405;1323;the film is also my favorite because I think it pays respect to the John Woo films.
I:8405;1324;what makes the film work so good is Keanu Reeves.
I:8405;1325;keanu Reeves is one of the most talented actors around today.
I:8405;1326;the Matrix fits Keanu as tight as an iron glove which is why I think Keanu Reeves is the perfect choice for this movie.
I:8405;1327;the idea for The Matrix made me wonder how much of an imagination I have in the back of my head.
I:8405;1328;the Matrix is truly the kind of film that will make you explode.
I:8405;1329;I thought the movie I saw on the screen reflected accurately the movie I saw in my head as I read the screenplay.
I:8405;1330;I was surprised at how close each scene on the screen was to each scene in the screenplay.
I:8405;1331;this movie seemed to have a strong plot that took an unnerving premise and developed it through good storytelling using bigger.
I:8405;1332;life characters that the audience could still relate to in some way.
I:8405;1333;I just thought that some acknowledgement by these freedom fighters that freedom was a relative thing for Cypher and, by extension much of humanity, would be a point worth developing.
I:8405;1334;Especially if the belief system questioned is a spiritual one.
I:8405;1335;directed, and stunning movie at both the visual and auditory levels with a compelling idea .
I:8405;1336;that our reality is what our brains tell us it is .
I:8405;1337;fi movie is worthy to be placed in the same league as Dune, which prior to this movie was the best I've seen on the screen or anywhere!
I:8405;1338;Although it's another version of Disney's Tron, it goes much further into the possibilities of what truth is actually about and who may be controlling your idea of it in the not too distant future!
I:8405;1339;It is beautifully choriographed and there is a brilliant script.
I:8405;1340;This would definately be the best movie I've watched in years.
I:8405;1341;This special effects were great and the acting was first rate.
I:8405;1342;The martial arts effects were also fantastic.
I:8405;1343;A good way to escape the reality for awhile.
I:8405;1344;One of the few movies that could rate a follow up feature.
I:8405;1345;The details in the faces of the characters is crisp.
I:8405;1346;The action sequences were stunning.
I:8405;1347;This movie is visually appealing.
I:8405;1348;Much like that other overrated movie in 1999 called Star Wars Episode 1.
I:8405;1349;this movie supposedly brags a very unique story.
I:8405;1350;the special effects are very good.
I:8405;1351;I saw how they made the revolutionary effects and that was very cool.
I:8405;1352;The sound effects are very good too.
I:8405;1353;the direting is fairly good, escpecially for a sci.
I:8405;1354;The directors of this movie had a box office hit and now they think they can keep the franchise going.
I:8405;1355;They turned out marvelous except the latest installment.
I:8405;1356;This is an exciting story that [draws] you into a whole new world and way of thinking.
I:8405;1357;It's a great date movie because it has tons of action for the guys with a sideline of romance for the ladies.
I:8405;1358;After you've seen the movie a few times (trust me, it's so fast paced, you'll notice something new each time), I recommend watching it in """"Follow the White Rabbit"""" mode."""
1359;Enjoy and remember anything is possible.
1360;Even though you may have seen this film before, it takes on a whole new fascination on Blu Ray.
1361;I highly recommend checking it out ~ the detail is gorgeous and you may not remember the story as well as you think!
1362;The Matrix is an excellent movie that combines science fiction, shoot.
1363;up action, and philosophical questions about the nature of Reality.
1364;If you are plugged in to a computer, and that computer presents you with a reality that is completely indistinguishable from your own, is it any less real?This movie has exceptional special effects, beautiful cinematography, an excellent soundtrack, well.
1365;crafted dialogue, and respectable acting.
1366;Keanu Reeves may be a lousy actor, but I think that the Matrix is probably his best performance to date.
1367;This is a classic to have.
1368;This was one of the best shows of 1999, easily the best science fiction, excluding Star Wars.
1369;The special effects are great and the story is really riveting.
1370;The story is somewhat grim, but that is a touch that adds to its charm.
1371;Definitely a show worth seing.
1372;Most of my friends agree that this flick is worth owning for the effects alone.
1373;But the more you watch it, the more you realize what a truly classic idea this is.
1374;Anyone who has really loved something before instantly realizes that this is one of the coolest movies ever.
1375;If you have ever dreamed of being a super hero before, this is your chance to see it happen.
1376;you all know how good this movie is, so i wont need to tell you about it.
1377;The Matrix is the best Sci Fi flick since Terminater 2.
1378;With the best special effects and some good acting (Keanu Reeves actualy gives a good performance) this has to be the film of 99.
1379;The Matrix is by far the best film Keanu Reeves has been involved with.
1380;This is also the best sci.
1381;The film is kind of a mixture of the Terminator and Dark City, but still seems to be very original.
1382;The action scenes are some of the best since John Woo's Face off, and plays in well with the fast beating soundtrack.
1383;I love this film, and think it's a great film to add to any action/sci.
1384;This movie single handedly slays any of those awesome 80's cyberpunk movies and takes it's place at the right hand of the cyber gods.
1385;so to those that imagine possibilities like that actually being possible in the future.
1386;You need to have an imagination to love this movie, and be in awe of all the far out sci.
1387;fi ideas, that's what all the great sci.
1388;It's like the movie Transformers, a typical person will dismiss it as a regular movie, but a real fan will love it so much, and love the music, and love the hot chick, and love the action scenes, and the special effects, and even the story.
1389;A real fan watches a movie and gets ideas for his own story from it to turn into a movie.
1390;These actors LIVE techno cool, in their full.
1391;You'd better see it just so you can join the conversation.
1392;I thought the special effects were great.
1393;I did find it just a little bit difficult to follow the first time, but the second time around, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
1394;It's one of those movies that you shouldn't take 100% seriously, but sit and enjoy the fast action and the special effects and maybe, just maybe, wonder about this so. called world we live in.
1395;Nah, really, it is a great movie for entertainment.
1396;It's not a movie I'd personally watch over and over, but I did enjoy it and I feel it is well worth viewing.
1397;The Matrix is a fairy tale of the coming of age of the neo.
1398;"other'
I:8405;1399;An excellent study of archetypes through cross.
I:8405;1400;film for the 90s, and an excellent candidate for the study of film criticism.
I:8405;1401;This film is the best film i have ever seen.
I:8405;1402;the special effects are UNBELIEVABLE and for the acting, it was brilliant.
I:8405;1403;this is a must see movie.
I:8405;1404;I love it when I get what is advertised and what is expected.
I:8405;1405;the films main strength lies in it's visual appeal.
I:8405;1406;consistently switching between the gritty harshness of the real, machine.
I:8405;1407;ruled world, and the slick, sterilized feel inside the Matrix and other computer programs.
I:8405;1408;The film impliments visual styles never before seen in any film, and created a world, streching the limits of the human imagination.
I:8405;1409;the films second strength, is in it's mind.
I:8405;1410;Questions such as these that go wild within the human mind but are never able to be truly communicated with others.
I:8405;1411;very few times has such a mix of both action and philosophy been but together in film form.
I:8405;1412;As with many science fiction and action films.
I:8405;1413;part saga, and is what it should really be viewed as.
I:8405;1414;science fiction lovers will (and have) found this film to put a fresh perspective on the genre and will love this movie for years to come.
I:8405;1415;geek people will probably enjoy most of it, particularly the concepts which are introduced in the movie.8/10 stars
I:8405;1416;not quite my type of movie but enjoyed it.
I:8405;1417;Keanu Reeves is great, Carrie Anne Moss is great, Laurence Fishburne is excellent!
I:8405;1418;The fighting scenes are superb, crazy """"running on the walls"""" usually seen in karate action movies."""
1419;The plot was totally unique, like nothing I've ever seen before.
1420;Always fun to watch and I have seen this original version several times and enjoy it just as much time after time.
1421;Everybody always told me to watch the Matrix, so I did.
1422;The special effects and the graphics are great.
1423;And Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne are good actors.
1424;Would have never watched this on my own, but our exchange student V from the Czech Republic suggested it and boy am I glad he did, and we truly enjoyed it, complicated at first as is a lot of movies but if you pay attention it does all make sense in the end and some Iconic scenes throughout.
1425;Enjoyed it and would actually watch it again to get a better grasp on things.
1426;Can see why it is a favorite of many.
1427;Not my cup of tea per say but again I did get entertained by it immensely.
1428;"There even seems to be some block ""reviewing"" from young Christian groups enthusiastically pointing out all the parallels to Christ's life: Neo, ""The One,"" ""Trinity,"" saving humankind, and being lifted up to heaven, etc."
1429;"The main thing to understand is that this is one very popular and very arresting movie, the sort of thing Hollywood producers love
I:8405;1430;Scrolling the credits takes longer than your mother's phone good.
I:8405;1431;The Matrix is an industry in itself, something like Star Wars and Rambo.
I:8405;1432;The cinematography, sound and special effects are first rate.
I:8405;1433;Everybody in the future society is working their nine.
I:8405;1434;pounding action and other sensual pleasures.
I:8405;1435;Absolutely thrilling special effects, great story and awesome music score.
I:8405;1436;Andy and Larry have delivered a rocksock cyberpunk film that is a one of a kind rollercoaster ride.
I:8405;1437;The effects were astounding and the storyline was very crafty.
I:8405;1438;I played THE MATRIX on the computer using Windows 98 and was also able to access the PC features.
I:8405;1439;On top of being a solid action movie, this movie definately brings something new to the world of the sci.
I:8405;1440;A super clean transfer, and great sound.
I:8405;1441;This moive is a must see.
I:8405;1442;No need to ramble about how awesome this movie is, so I'll keep it short and sweet.
I:8405;1443;watch this movie and watch it again and again.
I:8405;1444;Digital Sound and Picture has found it's poster child!
I:8405;1445;this film is unlike anything I have ever seen before.
I:8405;1446;deserved oblivion at the oscars, and Larwrence Fishbourne gave a terrific acting performance.
I:8405;1447;other than that, the sound is the best you will hope to find on dolby digital, very good.
I:8405;1448;Just as the movie began to take off, it suddenly hit me that the whole thing can be viewed as a metaphor for spiritual growth.
I:8405;1449;this is one of the most inspired, complete films ever made.
I:8405;1450;For me, this movie brought together a lot of personal questions and actually led me to a place where it was possible to """"free my mind."""
1451;It's slick, moody, and arguably original in presentation and content.
1452;The acting is great for an action flick.
1453;It's worth watching, and like any movie where the cast and crew gave their best effort, it might teach you something.
1454;maybe it's not the best movie ever made, but I've found that any film that people argue about for years deserves attention.
1455;it is beautifully shot, choreographed and filmed.
1456;His guide into this new world is Morpheus.
1457;unlike most films, the Matrix gets better after each viewing as the action is fast paced and there is a lot of intricacy and nuances that you pick up each time you view it.
1458;It's the visual effects influenced by Japanese anime that save it.
1459;a fan of action movies .
1460;I enjoyed the whole thing, beginning to end.
1461;This is a great movie cause all the special effects and the cinima sceens with doors as the music.
1462;The year is approximately 2199.
1463;The world human beings perceivethrough their senses is an illusion.
1464;He is also engrossed ina search for the One, a person who has the ability to alter the matrixin any way he sees fit and who will liberate humanity from itsbondage.
1465;The fighting scenes are fast paced and expertly implemented.
1466;however, the true beauty of the Matrix cannotbe uncovered in a single viewing.
1467;The Matrix is much, much more thana high.
1468;The film utilizes all these (and others) sources to explorehumanity's perception of reality, the concept of salvation, andnumerous other philosophical themes.
1469;Nonetheless, the Matrixwas written with many levels of meaning, exemplified in thecharacter's names, their actions, and their dialogue, to name a fewexamples.
1470;provoking and entertaining movies I have ever seen.
1471;A wee bit dated now, but still a great story (too bad the sequels were so bad) worth the price.
1472;One of those movies I can still watch once a year.
1473;This movie teases the viewer with possible new insights into various philosophical questions facing the human race.
1474;What The Matrix does, in addition to giving us an entertainment masterpiece, is nudge our subconscious, and consciously or not, make us pause and think about what this game of life is all about.
1475;It's engrossing all right, and I'm suggesting it's not just as a result of the entertainment factor.
1476;Action, non stop really and as a bonus the slower scenes are still absorbing.
1477;What a ride it is.
1478;The climb up that first hill is a little long, but once you start your descent, it is a breathtaking experience.
1479;The Matrix was brilliant, superb special effects, excellent storyline which has the ability to play on your mind for ages afterwards.
1480;This film has to be the best film ever,thought provoking with special events to back up the storyline and make it (unbelievable as it is) extremely believable.
1481;just open wide and take the blue pill!
1482;The special effects are thrilling, and the story is quite original, although it belongs to the general genre of machines.
1483;I loved it (all 10 times!)
1484;, and I was mostly captured by the superbe effects and all that magnificent action.
1485;I just remember the big jumps and the extraordinary kicks .
1486;In any case, it's a great movie, that introduces the new entry.
1487;level action all movies of this genre should have from now on!
1488;The Matrix has its fair share of critics as well as fans.
1489;The critics and I both agree the cast and visual effects are stunning and superb.
1490;(Quote: It's astonishing that so much money, talent, technical expertise.
1491;Also note that the Matrix received the best special effects award at the oscars (or at someplace else I forgot).
1492;I'm only giving this a five star just because the movie is great.
1493;A truly breathtaking movie questioning our reality, and how we truly don't know what is out there.
1494;Chances our I will wear the tape right through watching it so many times.
1495;This is definately must see.
1496;I can honestly say that this is the best movie I have ever seen.
1497;The more you watch it the more you pick up.
1498;The cast was amazing, the soundtrack is equally as good.
1499;Dazzling special effects, an intriguing story and spectacular action sequences make for a unique experience.
1500;seen anything like this before!I feel I must especially mention Hugo Weaving for his excellent portrayal of the sinister Agent Smith.
1501;A wonderful piece of cinematic work that you just can't afford to miss!
1502;I also enjoyed those, but just thought I'd mention they are used with great craft to support the creation of this dystopian hero story of discovery and redemption worthy of Joseph Campbell.
1503;truth is always the most entertaining of all, and this film kicks truth like no movie I've seen in years.
1504;if you feel the world is becoming more and more bizarre by the minute, then The Matrix will resonate deeply with your soul's awakening to this truth and help bring you back home to yourself.
1505;for you are The One to whom it speaks, and your self.
1506;Winner of two Academy Awards, The Matrix is a perfect ensemble of cast, effects (visual and sound), and story.
1507;Through powerful conversations with Morpheus, played by Laurence Fishburne, and Trinity, played by Carrie.
1508;anne Moss, Neo learns that the life of people on Earth is actually a complex system of computer data known as The Matrix, which controls every sense and action known to man.
1509;Working together, they hope to achieve the one thing that they have been dreaming about: freedom.
1510;when the movie came out in theaters, it received rave reviews, and after seeing the film, it deserved all of them and more.
1511;The actors in the film are excellent, both with their intellectual dialogue and their playing out of the action sequences.
1512;The choreography of the film is stupendous, and fight scenes with and without gunplay looks real and unflawed.
1513;animated look, this is the closest to reality that one can get, tying Independence Day for the best special effects ever in a motion picture.
1514;Under superb direction and stellar performances, The Matrix is a thrill.
1515;Sound design utilizes the .1 LFE channel at almost every turn, engaging especially in gunfight scenes and powerful explosions.
1516;The scene in which Neo moves faster than bullets is a remarkable piece of sound effects editing, utilizing the .1 LFE as well as the surround channels.
1517;I recommend this movie for anyone who likes action movies.
1518;Bet you will watch it again within one day after the first viewing.
1519;Has a great story line.
1520;It will keep you wondering.
1521;Watched it with our nine year old son and he loved it.
1522;"Well, because this movie hasn't received enough reviews I thought I would add yet another. . . tHE MATRIX has so much going for it: Dynamic, inventive story
I:8405;1523;time favorite character actors in Joe Pantoliano.
I:8405;1524;Plus the film just flows well, and looks so very, very good.
I:8405;1525;Not only do you enjoy the wonderful effects, the storyline is intellectually stimulating as well, notwithstanding the possible gaps in logic.
I:8405;1526;Keanu Reeves is one of my favorite actors"
1527;Vivid characters in this film.
1528;Another good Reeves movie is Devil's Advocate (with Al Pacino).
1529;It features wonderful visual effects, the music is fabulous and the cast is outstanding.
1530;Keanu Reeves as Neo is the perfect cast.
1531;But you'll feel an uncontrollable urge to see it again.
1532;And once you do that, and you will, you'll find this hidden depth.
1533;You won't be sure of it the first time, so you'll see it again, trust me.
1534;And I'm a happier man.
1535;Superb sharp picture, exceptional musical score, breathtaking special f/x, a handful of some of the better seen extras,not to mention the great plot.
1536;Although watching it again and again does turn tedious, the film is one of the best.
1537;It is the movie that set new standards in the world of movie making.
1538;Not only is the Matrix a first in superb visuals and animation, but it is a dang good movie too.
1539;"It might take a few viewings to understand every nook, but once it all fits into place it is a great theme, ""is this world we live in real, or not, and what exactly defines ""real""."
1540;"The Matrix will explain it all, in the eyes of Neo (aka Mr. Anderson as Agen Smith likes to call him), from his simple days as another man in the Matrix to becoming unplugged and becoming ""The One""."
1541;The characters are top notch and the visuals are to die for.
1542;Many even place this movie into martial arts category, as each fight scene displays true martial arts choreogrpahy intertwined with visual effects of animation.
1543;arguably the best in the trilogy, The Matrix is in my opinion that compared to the other two.
1544;Along comes Trinity played by the fit Carrie.
1545;guess living in a rural area has it's advantages as well as disadvantages.
1546;now let me explain hopw good this movie is,critics praised it,people praised it,it won over twenty awards world wide.
1547;it was nominated for four Academy Awards,and took them all home(they are best visual effects,sound effects,film editing,and sound effects editing,whoa).
1548;the Matrix is a movie you have to watch over and over again to undertsand,and it ultimately is a powerhouse of a movie.
1549;The premise of this film is novel and well covered.
1550;It is better than most, a little dark (similar to The Crow), and the acting is excellent.
1551;Little things start to get annoing (ie the green filter in the Matrix is cool but gets real annoing) Still it is a fun movie to whatch with some great dialog.
1552;This movie is epic, one of the best movies to come out of the 90s.
1553;What more do you need.
1554;Everything showed up great and the movie was great.
1555;hospital like Sarah Connor was Long title,huh?The Matrix may be the best movie I ever saw.
1556;the special effecets are simply astonishing.
1557;the special effects in the fight scene are absublutely amazing.
1558;it has an incredible story.
1559;because of those who have not seen it yet,that is all I will say.
1560;The Matrix is a long, intense roller coaster ride into the future.
1561;What our world is today is a dream world, and The Matrix is the real world.
1562;"I won't tell you what
I:8405;1563;What you believe about the future is the key of life.
I:8405;1564;That's why it got 4 1/2 out of five.
I:8405;1565;The special effects are great.
I:8405;1566;This is the first movie of its kind that the REAL actors do their own moves.
I:8405;1567;This movie should be a big hit across the Pacific.
I:8405;1568;anne Moss (Trinity) were a great pair.
I:8405;1569;It is probably the best science fiction movie I've seen.
I:8405;1570;The Matix is the best Sci.
I:8405;1571;fi movie to date since Terminator 1 2.
I:8405;1572;The fighting choreography was so phenomenally constructed, the newly introduced graphics was superbly enhancing.
I:8405;1573;It is a must see.
I:8405;1574;seen it by my recommendation and has ended up thanking me.
I:8405;1575;Oh well, don't take the matrix too seriously and you'll have a great time.
I:8405;1576;There are certain movies that set new standards for the film industry.
I:8405;1577;The Matrix has moved beyond that.
I:8405;1578;The soundtrack keeps your heart racing a mile a minute.
I:8405;1579;And as if that isn't enough, the story is so fresh and such a great idea, you are left wondering how they thought of it, and maybe even thinking to yourself, 'Is the Matrix real?'
I:8405;1580;Even if you're not a Keanu Reeves fan, you'll still love this flick.
I:8405;1581;He fits the role well, and although his acting has never really been that great, he does a more than adequate job in this instant classic.
I:8405;1582;if you want action through and through, this is the movie for you.
I:8405;1583;The plot is extremely well thought out"
1584;I loved the martial arts sequences.
1585;In the face of technically demanding work, the character remained fresh and real !
1586;I also loved the role of Trinity, who Carrie.
1587;anne Moss portrayed so well.
1588;Finally, a movie where the female character is a very capable strong person.
1589;From the opening scene you know you're in for something special.
1590;The matrix is definitely one the of the best movies I have ever seen.
1591;The action was amazing, the plot magnificent, and the characters were well suited to their parts and their acting was stupendous.
1592;"born"" by 'morpheus', and through his death and resurrection is able to overcome the matrix and defeat the AGENTS(the devil) finalize what he is."
1593;i've heard of many other parallels within Christianity and many other religions as well.
1594;Just keep that in mind the next time you watch it.
1595;I REALLY enjoyed this movie.
1596;action theater, and effects.you will LOVE this movie.
1597;The brilliance that went into this movie amazes me.
1598;This is deep and brilliant.
1599;"i don't think, the plot ever really had what I would call a twist it was just so unpredictable the obvious seemed invisible
I:8405;1600;It was so stunning, so gripping, so real, so powerful.
I:8405;1601;i haven't seen all the actions out there now, but without even really seeing half of them I feel like I could easily say: This is the best action yet in world history.
I:8405;1602;and the special effects are stunning, and the entire creation of the scenery is again amazing.
I:8405;1603;The message behind this movie is simply so incredible.
I:8405;1604;breaking special effects to a highly original sci.
I:8405;1605;fi concept, propelling a capable cast through a unique journey to another reality.
I:8405;1606;His rescue by Morpheus and his companions, including Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss), leads Neo to two stunning realizations: that the reality in which he has been living is a computer.
I:8405;1607;Along the way, the viewer will be treated to some spectacular kung fu sequences as Neo learns to use his new powers, and the famous and visually stunning shootout in multiple dimensions in the lobby of a building where Neo and Trinity go to rescue Morpheus.
I:8405;1608;this movie is highly recommended as a quantum leap forward in the special effects of the day, and as an exciting science fiction story.
I:8405;1609;believed that the Matrix is one of the best sci.
I:8405;1610;provoking, or even that entertaining.
I:8405;1611;Because of this, it's pretty hard to care what happens to them.
I:8405;1612;done and has enough unique nuances to have it stand up on its own.
I:8405;1613;i can keep going on here, but I think you get the picture.
I:8405;1614;Well, I'd like to be merciful in this area, but not even the action scenes make this movie entertaining.
I:8405;1615;provoking or entertaining (both with some), check out these much superior films.
I:8405;1616;This is a very unique film.
I:8405;1617;Exciting, interesting, intelligent, and lost of Fun.
I:8405;1618;Being in the effects field myself, I have read and seen a fair share on the making of this film.
I:8405;1619;I've got to hand it to the Wachowski brothers.
I:8405;1620;They really came up with a gem with this one.
I:8405;1621;The Matrix is one of those movies that is only as good as you make it.
I:8405;1622;But even when horrid stories attempt to become allegories, the fun of interpretation renders the movie watchable.
I:8405;1623;But those viewers willing to put something into the movie are going to walk away with a much more satisfying movie.
I:8405;1624;Indeed, it is funny that Morpheus would refer to his idea of reality as wonderland.
I:8405;1625;The values we are expected to hold are actually inverted by the movie.
I:8405;1626;The agents are capable of emotion, as one snarls that humans are nothing more than a virus destroying the world.
I:8405;1627;I could explore the religious allegory with more detail.
I:8405;1628;it should be obvious, then, that this decent movie is indeed worthy of four stars when one invests some effort in analyzing its themes and symbols.
I:8405;1629;With an unbiased, """"objective"""" viewing, it is a three star movie at best."""
1630;The Matrix is a good movie with great special effects.
1631;It has plenty of extras and the movie itself looks amazing.
1632;There was a reason that The Matrix won all the Oscars for special effects and sound over Star Wars: Episode 1.
1633;I did like Episode 1 to, but the Matrix did all its effects with live actors which makes it that more impressive.
1634;the story is just great.
1635;It really makes you wonder about reality, but its more entertaining than anything.
1636;Its hard to get bored of this movie, I have seen it many times now and i still could go see it again and enjoy it.
1637;so overall, matrix is the best movie to date,PERIOD!
1638;This is a great film, but whta I don't understand is why it got an R rating.
1639;Anyway, this is a great film and will keep you on the edge of your seat.
1640;This movie will remain a gem in your collection.
1641;Good disk all in all.
1642;They'll love it like my 5 year old, 8 year old and 11 year old did.
1643;This one is my second favorite in the series.
1644;tech complexity, the movie proved to be more than just a Reeves spotlight.
1645;there is a new paradigm of thought in town, bringing us in to the 21st century with both precedented and unprecedented power, grace and style.
1646;respecting and including the ones that came before it in its new perspective.
1647;and give us a Jungian anthropological/mythological masterpiece underneath innovative special effects, changing movie making forever.
1648;jungian Mythographer and genius Joseph Campbell.
1649;telling in Hollywood for quite some time, I'm sure.
1650;There is something new to mine from this movie every time you see it, because of the divine truths it thematically and metaphorically underscores.
1651;naturally, you can't ignore the obvious: the special effects and cinematography are from another planet.
1652;because of it being so masterfully written.
1653;and the movie would have still been wonderful.
1654;This is the real reason why you can watch this movie 16 times and still see it again as if it was the first.
1655;another wonderful independent film that heralds the discovery of the secret worlds of INNER space.
1656;The Sticky must agree that the Matrix is one of the finest steak movies around.
1657;One, the steak being eaten by Cipher just looks extraordinary.
1658;Juicy, well presented, and when Cipher puts it in his mouth, Sticky's mouth was well.
1659;but the great thing about it was Cipher's subversive comment about the steak.
1660;The Matrix also asks the questions, what if you woke up one day, and your life as you knew it was never truly a real life?
1661;Cool movie 5 stars, check it out!
1662;See it, Love it, Live it.
1663;Matrix kicks it up a notch and is more entertaining and more technologically advanced (the original is from 1976?)
1664;I loved it a lot!
1665;A great movie, a lot of extras and is a digibook, that I love, with pictures and info.
1666;This is one of the best movies ever made.
1667;the Matrix is as amazing movie that if you have never watched it, it will tickle your brain.
1668;A friend insisted I watch it and after doing so, I was hooked.
1669;Perfectly fitting that the villain is basically a bureaucrat.
1670;The Matrix is probably one of the most clever, original, entertaining and well directed movies of the last decade.
1671;All the FXs are appropriated and go hand in hand with the great plot.
1672;This is without a doubt one of the best sci.
1673;the plot is very imaginative and creative.
1674;the action scenes are very well executed and the visual imagery in the movie is awe inspiring.
1675;wonderful acting performances by all the cast in the movie and the movie keeps you on your toes wanting more.
1676;cyberpunk has truly reached its finest hour in this latest cinematic addition to the genre.
1677;this film appeals to a more educated crowd with its twisted plot and potentially realistic plot.
1678;all in all, the wachowski boys have done themselves proud with the most addictive film released this year.
1679;you can have this really cool movie with lots of cool added features.
1680;this is the best movie there is,and probably ever will be.
1681;special effects are great in it.
1682;The Matrix is a very entertaining movie.
1683;It has great martial arts sequences and John Woo inspired gun sequences.
1684;The story of this movie is solid and very intriguing.
1685;You may say I have to lighten up, but great dialogue could have made this movie perfect.
1686;worth seeing more than once, but just don't listen to what the characters are saying.
1687;You'll have to see it twice!
1688;Just see it, it's beyond words.
1689;The Matrix is a pivotal film in the history of film.
1690;The philosophical influences in the Matrix are obvious to anyone familiar with works of Descartes.
1691;Neo chooses to learn what the Matrix really is, and that's when the fun really begins.
1692;art F/X, relies upon a gripping story, characters who actually grow, and the classic unfolding of the Hero's Journey for its impact.
1693;I had to watch it twice to see it once.
1694;The plot itself is a hipper, more thoughtful and logical extension of questions raised in those films about the nature of reality and how manipulation of reality forms human society.
1695;The awesome special effects and kung.
1696;candy to accompany a meaty, soul.
1697;As Neo awakens to the nature of the reality he thought he knew, the viewer awakens with him.
1698;The message here is that we can accept everything at face value and be comfortable, or we can take the more hazardous course and question it all.
1699;The price of maintaining our humanity is to sacrifice comfort and safety for something greater than ourselves.
1700;It is thoughful and thought.
1701;provoking, thrilling to watch and enthralling to contemplate.
1702;In case you couldn't tell, I really liked this flick.
1703;The story line was good.
1704;The Matrix is one of the best movies of all times!
1705;I honestly don't like Keanu Reeves but even he couldn't ruin this story and he actually fits the character quite well.
1706;WOW, just wow, struggling to find words.
1707;Laurence Fishburn has got to be one of the best actors around today.
1708;The special effects are absolutely incredible and the story line is top.
1709;I mean how can you not list Matrix as one of the most extraordinary films in history,with one of the most intriguing storylines to ever hit the big screen.
1710;It is a movie that can sit in the background of a party, on multiple tv's and everyone is in tune with it.
1711;Visually brilliant and the sound is bar none.
1712;matrix is one of the greatest, and always will be.
1713;Stunning, rich in depth and suspense, totally engrossing and mesmorizing.
1714;This movie is so awesome.
1715;They make so real life like.
1716;Believe me the first time I say it I thought it was real.
1717;It's fresh, it's original, it's deep, and still has a bunch of mind.
1718;blowing effects and awesomely choreographed fight scenes to keep you interested from beginning to end.
1719;The Matrix is now one of my favorite films of all time, and it is definitely a ride I would take again.
1720;It was top notch science fiction action!
1721;What I love about the movie is it's new twists.
1722;These directors are brilliant and are willing to go to any lengths to achieve perfection.
1723;For those of you like myself who can care less about Reloaded and Revolutions, this is the movie for you.
1724;I always thought The Matrix was a great stand alone movie by itself.
1725;The other two lacked in originality and story, and I bypass the two all the time.
1726;The Matrix was so unique, revolutionizing film forever, doing things never been done or tried before.
1727;Just a great movie all around.
1728;Watched it with my 13 year old and he loved it.
1729;But, it was surprisingly good!
1730;He does seem to work well in this genre.
1731;This movie is a real must.
1732;I was blown away by the special effects and intricate storyline.
1733;This is a film which is truely worth watching and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
1734;This is one of the best films of the 90s and I advise all to watch it even those who are sceptical.
1735;This movie was a visionary treat, and had excellent special effects.
1736;An intense plot, incredible music, extraordinary acting and stunning visuals are combined to create one of the most impressive science fiction movies out there.
1737;As juvenile as it seems, the action scenes themselves are so impressive that even if a decent story was lacking from the movie (which is most certainly not true) it would still be worth a viewing.
1738;The amazing soundtracks add so much to the intense, suspense filled movie.
1739;I thought that this movie was awesome!
1740;The special effects are the latest availible and the storyline keeps you guesing until the end.
1741;I especially liked the guns.
1742;I recommend to watch it everyone.
1743;Keanu is perfect like always.
1744;It is a must for any movie library.
1745;this movie reaffirms Laurence Fishburne's pedigree as an actor, lends Keanu Reeves respectability, and launches a bright new star in Carrie Anne Moss.
1746;rated, and I think most people by now have seen this and thought, 'Oh wow, a movie about the world as we think it is, but it turns out not to be what we think it is, so let's just all jump and fight in ultra.
1747;The trailers that I saw for it promised some cool looking effects and possibly a pop philosophy/existentialist subtext.
1748;This is one of the best movies to come out in a long time.
1749;i'll begin with the effects.
1750;Bluntly put, this movie represents the biggest jump in effects since a blue screen was first used.
1751;This is the greatest effect that I have seen in a long time.
1752;The only ones that are better are for sentimental reasons or pure skill, but the sequences in the Matrix look better than anything.
1753;this movie is also very full of style.
1754;as for the movie itself, the plot and subtext is phenomenal.
1755;Even if you ignore all of this, on the surface it's a great Sci.
1756;The gunfights are great and Keanu is actually a good cast.
1757;Laurence Fishburne was a perfect cast for Morpheus and Carri.
1758;the matrix is the greatest movie in my opinion of all time.
1759;seen it 16 times so far,and it keeps gettin better every time.
1760;it is a master peice.
1761;The Matrix is a classic in the same way as Casablanca or Citizen Kane.
1762;the Matrix as a movie is profound and entertaining.
1763;one of the best movies, ever!
1764;Love the movie to see it 2nd time with family together.
1765;The special effects, the format, the movie in general and the actors did a great job.
1766;The sound effects in this movie absolutely raise the bar for any action or sci.
1767;on the whole the story is great, with some minor flaws in the logic behind the matrix that I won't bother with because this movie absolutely ROCKS.
1768;This is one of the all time best most creative future fantasy events on film!!!
1769;The concept and meaning of freedom takes on a whole new dimension.
1770;Neo, a young man in his late twenties, takes a ride in a car in 1999 and is held captive, at gun.
1771;choose the the blue one , continue to live within the dream .
1772;Neo chooses the red one and the trip to the future begins .
1773;It seems like a forewarning .2) find your own path, get in touch with your belief system,remain true to your values,3) freedom means taking a chance, not knowing the outcome.
1774;It is sets human beings apart from the rest of creation.
1775;the realm of getting in touch with one's inner self is explored.
1776;There is an esoteric side throughout the film.
1777;Another memorable statment is To deny our own impulse is to deny the very thing that makes us human .
1778;this thoroughly enjoyable film has artistic, entertainment and philosophical/humanistic value.
1779;It explores many facets of human behavior and the meaning purpose of life.
1780;The Matrix is one of the most brilliant, mind.
1781;The special effects, sound, and action sequences are so spectacular that they move you and absorb you all at once.
1782;The four Oscars this movie won for special effects, sound editing, and other technical achievements were well deserved.
1783;This movie will take your breath away and stimulate the facets of your mind to twist in ways you've never imagined.
1784;Watch this film and you won't be disappointed.
1785;The plot, although it has its holes, is engaging and complex, and even semi.
1786;The action sequences are, IMHO, thrilling and exquisite.
1787;I am NOT a Keanu fan, far from it, but I enjoyed his performance thoroughly, and Fishburne was great as well.
1788;But, if you watch this ready to suspend disbelief and have a EXCEPTIONALLY good time, then that is most certainly what you'll experience.
1789;head battle scenes further illuminated by the next wave in special effect technology, this movie also a number of thought.
1790;the action gives the film its blockbuster appeal, but the meat of the story lies in the philosophy behind it.
1791;but if you want something that both makes your heart race and the wheels of your mind turn, accept no substitute.
1792;watch it when you can pay attention.
1793;Watch it and pay attention.
1794;The message is strong and powerful.
1795;Matrix is the most enjoying movie that I have ever watched.
1796;about the movie I can say that you should watch this because it is a classic.
1797;This movie has basic flaws in its premise, but if you overlook them (or don't notice them, like most people) there's a lot of great action and style.
1798;I was really surprised when I saw this film at the cinema.
1799;The story of `the Matrix` was brilliant.
1800;First Morpheus revivals the real world to Neo!And the trubble ahead is big.You are n for a big surprise!
1801;This movie brings action, science fiction, love, and a little bit of mystery together to make a star hit among the theatrical world.
1802;most people think this is the best film ever.
1803;and almost watchable performances, and chances are you're gonna see a story .
1804;this is also my favorite .
1805;I was impressed with the new camera angles, and special fx.
1806;The staircase sequence (in the opening) has been done before and a lot better in John Woo's A Better Tomorrow II.
1807;The Whackowski Brothers should know better then to take from Mr. Woo, because he is always one step ahead .
1808;creating something bigger, better, and utterly breathtaking.
1809;The soundtrack was very nice, and Don Davis's score was actually decent.
1810;I'm sure, what you're thinkin is .
1811;fi films, and John Woo films that I mentioned .
1812;I know it's been a million years and thousands of reviews later, but something has always mystified me about this movie.
1813;Everything the Oracle told me has come true.
1814;She hesitates, and then Smith shows up to kill them and interrupts her.
1815;"In her phrasing, Trinity distinguished what had already come true (""has come true"") from what had not yet to come true."
1816;This will be important later in this discussion).
1817;It is at this moment she gets it.
1818;and a nice twist on the `Princess kisses the frog' fable.
1819;she kisses Neo and he awakens.
1820;And that man, the man that I loved would be the One.
1821;The above words are not what Trinity spoke to Neo.
1822;And that man, the man that I loved would be the One.
1823;out, a fresh accident scene in the background.
1824;There are a number of other incongruities throughout the film (we of course forgive the brothers because The Matrix is effectively a perfect movie).
1825;One of the fundamental spiritual metaphors the Wachowski Brothers employed was the resurrection of Jesus.
1826;Think about the exchange between Neo and Choi early in the film:Choi: It's Choi.
1827;neo: You got the money?Choi: Two grand.
1828;He is the liberator of the lost souls of the Matrix.
1829;He must die in the matrix, and then transcend the matrix to be born again into a higher plane of existence.
1830;The movie is screaming what she knows.
1831;She gazes upon the dead man she loves who is The One, and there is only one thing to do.
1832;she takes that leap of faith.
1833;She kisses the frog .
1834;One of the best movies ever made, hand's down.
1835;It was totally revolutionary when it was released, and still is fresh to this day.
1836;The Wachowski Brothers are surely brilliant.
1837;time genre, in which was spoofed by over 20 movies, yet this movie does it the best.
1838;pounding action is great, and the special effects are superb.
1839;The visuals are absolutely stunning.
1840;down one of the greatest, no, IS the greatest Sci.
1841;He realizes that he has been living in an artificially created world known as 'The Matrix'.
1842;He meets the one and only Morpheus, who sends him to the real world.
1843;I pretty much love this film from start to finish, and the soundtrack is great.
1844;This movie is simply amazing.
1845;Not everyone will love it, but my believe is that people who love this movie has something inside them.
1846;But here goes:This movie is a great action adventure, with great action sequences, and some very imaginative images (and mediocre acting, but hey, who cares).
1847;You get the best scenes running at the beginning of the movie, and in the background behind the menu.
1848;The transitions are very nice, without taking too much time.
1849;scenes feature is pretty fascinating.
1850;The music track is great.
1851;It's amazing to hear the music without the actor voices or effects.
1852;It's just so cool, and I wish that more movies would do this.
1853;One of the best Science Fiction movies I have ever seen.
1854;A strong plot along with an outstanding cast and dazzling special effects.
1855;You will have a good time watching this movie guaranteed!
1856;It is a visual experience.
1857;The only thing I can say is that The Matrix is the fiction of the 21st Century, an extremely original cybernetic adventure that concerns a real world and a virtual world, the human kind and the artificial intelligence.
1858;A motion picture with astonishing visual and sound effects that transport us to a dream world, a world where anything is possible.
1859;and it's looking for you, and it will find you if you want it to.
1860;Go and watch this movie.
1861;What you know you can't explain, but you feel it.
1862;This by far is one of the top movies of all time.
1863;Everytime it comes on tv I watch it.
1864;Even my baby boomer mother was blown away by this film and all she likes are old westerns!
1865;it's actually a construct made by machines.
1866;but in my mind,it is Hugo weaving whosteals the show as the enigmatic agent Smith.
1867;i will admit the movie hassome great special effects and some spectacular fight scenes.
1868;there are some genuine moments of high tension.
1869;It's visually, aurally, and feature.
1870;i will go into the features though.
1871;If you ever wanted to know how they froze Trinity in the air or how they did the bullet fire, you'll love it.
1872;The featurettes are thoroughly educational.
1873;along commentaries by the actor who played Trinity, special effects wizard, and producer are entertaining.
1874;Check out ANY music artist, and people will ALWAYS tell you that their first album was their best.
1875;i loved this movie when it first came out.
1876;It was undeniably creative, had great special effects, and really revolutionized the way action films would be looked at from then on.
1877;while going this film,i got big anticipations.
1878;I love keanu Reeves as an actor.
1879;The matrix movies are just another great acting of Mr. Reeves.
1880;"Needs to be watched over and over
I:8405;1881;Yes, this is the best action movie I've ever seen with no doubt because a lot of things.
I:8405;1882;one fights, assaults in the air and people being able to do more of what a normal human would do.
I:8405;1883;The special effects are excellent, and the script as well, I mean, the idea of that the world where we live is not the real world, and the conflict established between human beings and machines.
I:8405;1884;Another important thing here is the look of the characters, all in black, wearing sunglasses and carrying mobile phones of the new generation.
I:8405;1885;I also liked their conversations.You should watch it.
I:8405;1886;Much has been said about the cult following the movie has generated and I'm proud to be counted among them.
I:8405;1887;The unexpected spin really, and I mean REALLY caught me off guard!
I:8405;1888;In one flash, the world that you know and feel comfortable in reverses in such a dramatic way that you will hang on every scene thereafter.
I:8405;1889;Stunning visuals, great characters, awesome production design and a script so exasperating you won't have the energy to get up once the credits roll!
I:8405;1890;This is a truly original film, albeit inspired by Star Wars as well as another major sci.
I:8405;1891;fi fan, this is the film to watch.
I:8405;1892;For Tech junkies across this land THE MATRIX has certainly moved to the front of the pack!
I:8405;1893;cool storyline,anyone wanting to start a library should start their collection with this one.
I:8405;1894;the story and direction worked on a more sophisticated level.
I:8405;1895;all of the actors came across great.
I:8405;1896;had more humour in it
I:8405;1897;fi action movie with a brain, amazing special effects, well.
I:8405;1898;developed characters, a cool soundtrack, and so many unforgettable quotes I don't even know where to begin?
I:8405;1899;Yeah, that's what you're lookin' at.
I:8405;1900;Oh, and there are a lot of big explosions.
I:8405;1901;Actually, the action scenes in general are worth watching the movie for alone .
I:8405;1902;haired man in a sports coat, tie and sunglasses who always wields a gun.
I:8405;1903;it more than justifies the two.
I:8405;1904;And the fight scenes are awesome, too.
I:8405;1905;There are some awesome lines in this movie!
I:8405;1906;Heros to root for and villians to root against.
I:8405;1907;Blossoming love and a guy who believes already?
I:8405;1908;The movie is one of the best in the business.
I:8405;1909;Creating wonder and amazement about the world you are in.
I:8405;1910;This film is on the mark at so many levels.
I:8405;1911;From a spiritual and metaphysical standpoint it is deep, from a societal standpoint it is accurate, and for plain fun, visuals and action it terrific.
I:8405;1912;iWhether one is a spiritual seeker or not, this is a special treat.
I:8405;1913;Always a good one to watch.
I:8405;1914;The Matrix is a great movie for anyone who likes action movies.
I:8405;1915;This is the best Sci.
I:8405;1916;The graphics are the best Ive seen.
I:8405;1917;If your into futureistic high actions movies this is a must see.
I:8405;1918;The answer comes in the form of a message on his screen, and this leads to his meeting a mysterious woman, Trinity, who introduces him to a dimension where reality and illusion are fused.
I:8405;1919;Morpheus opens Neo's mind to some startling news: that people are being imprisoned in a form of reality, and that Neo is """"the one"""" who will break this code and free, both physically and spiritually, those who are trapped."""
1920;"one of the refreshing aspects about the Matrix is there is some ""meat"" to a special effects genre that by now has become mostly visual eye candy for the masses, as special effects extravaganzas in the past decade that overdose on CGI could take a lesson from this film."
1921;Neo's existence is pivotal to the world that Morpheus introduces him to, and there is a certain amount of build up between not only what Neo believes is real and what is illusion, but also what his ultimate fate will be.
1922;"the aggravation with a film like this is the poetic license, the proverbial ""easy"" button given once the theme of appearance vs. reality is introduced."
1923;Still, with its flaws, The Matrix has an adequate mix of edge, fantasy, innovation and philosophy without crossing the bounds of outright insanity, and is vastly superior to the spawn of effects clones spewed out in the past decade.
1924;Sequels spoil the fun of this movie.
1925;It truly surprised me: it was new, challenging, mind bending.
1926;I still enjoy the photography and the fight choreography!
1927;I like the premise of the film as it is based in thing science is discovering to be more possible as time goes by, Gives you food for thought.
1928;The Matrix, at its core is about realization/spiritual growth/ enlightenment, the plot, the action, the acting and the specical effects are all secondary however, they do make for a good movie that appeals to a wide audience.
1929;He definitely cannot apreciate a great movie like The Matrix.
1930;For me, The Best Movie of The Year, without exagerating.
1931;I'm not really sure why I'm even writing this review, because everyone all ready knows that The Matrix is one of the best movies to ever come out, but just figured I'd give my 2 cents anyway.
1932;This movie has so much action that it's incredible.
1933;It also has some of the best special effects I've seen in a very long time, and the storyline is amazing.
1934;Who ever wrote the story for the movie, is a genius and I hope is coming back for the other 2 movies.
1935;Should the AFI Top 100 Movies Ever list be updated anytime soon, you can be sure that this film will rank among the top 50.
1936;The whole storyline and premise is so intriquing, acting so good and overall cinematography so excellent that this would be a hit even if it was released today.
1937;The special features has a very good making of documentary and I appreciated the whole white rabbit feature as well.
1938;It'll be interesting to see just how much better the Blu.
1939;ray release of this great film is real treat for fans.
1940;I've always had a soft spot for digibooks and so this already makes for me a worthy double.
1941;of documentaries are extensive and the very long audio soundtrack of a selection of tunes from the movie is also a nice treat.
1942;The fine print on the back of the box says so!
1943;"I also tried it and it's true
I:8405;1944;promptly found it a day after the new one arrived.
I:8405;1945;I'm not really sure how to begin this review"
1946;If anybody here can show me one movie like this one, I'll give 'em fifty bucks.
1947;the second word that comes to mind is action.
1948;There's a reason that this movie won awards for the best fight scene of the year.
1949;this superb display of action in other movies might leave little other room for the third and final word which sets THE MATRIX apart: plot.
1950;Yes, it's there all right.
1951;Every character has a personality from Neo, the absolutely amazing hero, Trinity, the big.
1952;I'll give this movie an extra star for its elegant effects, the rest is overrated.
1953;some of the moves are like dragon ball z moves this is a must see action suspense the best efects in the world and great imagination.
1954;type world, with the same solution .
1955;aliens keep people in virtual reality chambers their entire lives so they can suck out their body energy.
1956;By not taken either of two alternatives, Neo transcends the artificially created reality of computer intelligence .
1957;ultimately it is love which defies computer intelligence in this very intelligently written and this film which is a true masterpiece.
1958;it was just as fun watching it now as it was then, especially since it was my kids first time to see it.
1959;it's one of the main points of my new favorite book .
1960;To me, I have a deep and profound connection to this movie and its meaning.
1961;This movie is truly a masterpeice.
1962;It has a great story and really makes you think about what the matrix is and if it's real or not.
1963;Eye popping special effects, great cinimatography, and mind.
1964;blowing acting make this movie one of the greatest hits of the year.
1965;Oh, and there is a lot of action, guns, phones, and obviously, computers.
1966;Here is what you do to really enjoy this movie.
1967;The first time you watch, just do that, watch it do not think about everything that is going on just watch, and absorb it.
1968;When all this is done watch it again and realize you are watching a great movie.
1969;Keanu and Laurence give great performances and are a great duo.
1970;The plot is a little complicated, but makes the movie great.
1971;As in so many other movies of its kind, thoughtful intelligence takes a back seat to theatrics and mass audience mentality.
1972;The Matrix has to be rated with Star Wars and Blade Runner as one of the best Sci Fi movies of all time!
1973;This movie has it all: a wonderful storyline, excellent acting, the best special effects of all time, nonstop action, romance, wonderful fight sequences and best of all two sequels to follow!
1974;This is one of the few perfect movies I have seen.
1975;This is a aweasome movie.
1976;The action scenes were great.
1977;as well as great acting from the support cast aswell.
1978;People will claim that this is a good special effects movie, a good action movie, and an excellent commentary on the nature of reality itself.
1979;Her performance at least had more depth than that of Reeves.
1980;apocalyptic twist with vague associations to the machine wars of Terminator and Terminator II , was intriguing enough to me that I seriously considered the what if idea of a pseudo.
1981;It's enough to make your mind boggle if you take it *too* seriously, but I think those are the most enjoyable movies.
1982;Just close enough to reality to make you really wonder, and just far enough out of touch with reality to make the movie enjoyable, fresh, and watchable again and again.
1983;the fight scenes are great.
1984;It's stunning to watch the training and the technology of movie making meld together to make a final scene that pushes the bounds of physical reality just enought that you think Damn!
1985;Matrix is one of the greatest sci.
1986;Its special effect is so amazing that my eye balls were almost poped out.
1987;fi or action this is the movie for you the plot is so intense.
1988;ANY fan of science fiction will love this movie.
1989;this is doubtlessly the best movie in history.
1990;Science fiction, action, and originality make this my favorite movie, and hopefully yours.
1991;This is a great movie .
1992;If you're into special effects This is for you!
1993;A somewhat amazing, if not Far.
1994;It certainly keeps my friends attention, 2.3 times per week, a reel.
1995;I watched The Matrix and afterwards I said to myself, Now, that was really cool .
1996;It's a movie you watch and then you sit back with a big grin on your face and you say, Yeah, that was really, really cool .
1997;It's one of the most visually striking movies I've seen in a long time, the helicopter scene, the jump scene, all those washed out olives and browns when they are trapped in the building.
1998;It also has Keanu Reeves, and while Reeves hasn't displayed much evidence in the past that he can actually ACT, here he is perfectly case as an insomniac.
1999;It's nice to watch a movie that is obviously set up for a sequal and find that you actually WANT to see the sequal when it appears.
2000;If you haven't seen the Matrix, you gotta.
2001;High marks for this film in every regard.
2002;here is the use of technical effects as thoughtful and completely fitting.
2003;A completely unique film experience.
2004;the Matrix is a stunning classic by any measure.
2005;fi.You'll love this movie !
2006;With groundbreaking special effects technology, a philisophical / scientific story and easily watchable .
2007;anne Moss is the woman Neo loves and is loved by, Trinity.
2008;a mesmerizing, eye popping visual extravaganza that redefined science fiction and revitalized interest in the theme of man VS machine .
2009;mixed in with religion, philosophy and some great lines from Laurence Fishburne, you have a cyberpunk classic which can be seen again and again .
2010;you saw how many MTV movie awards this movie won ~ THEREFORE this is the ONE to own and treasure for all time !
2011;There is an actual screensaver of the matrix for those of you with a pc.
2012;The digital sound is neccesary for this one.
2013;If you don't have surround sound GET IT!
2014;Discussions of The Matrix manage to send sparks flying whenever a fan and a hater should happen to bring up the topic.
2015;(A phenomenon you can witness simply by viewing other customer's reviewes.)
2016;By day he works for a respectable software company, by night he's a hacker, searching at his computer screen for answers to his question, and for the man he thinks can answer them.
2017;And so begins our entry into the wild, graphically intense, kung.
2018;the most interesting thing about the Matrix though, is the vast variation in people's interpretations of its meaning.
2019;anne Moss turns in an underrated performance as the strong.yet.
2020;And Weaving is delightful as Agent Smith (can't mention him enough!)
2021;"room floor worthy sequences (personally I found the Oracle bit a little silly), and the whole bit towards the end regarding our hero's ""Second Coming"", was, well, contrived indeed."
2022;well, this is more the type of movie you watch *scenes* of then actually watching the whole movie.
2023;substance, but with style to spare, and just enough substance, The Matrix manages to carve out a niche in the Pantheon of Good Sci.
2024;"so, are the fans right about it being ""THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER!"""
2025;I could say that its a good, solid Sci.
2026;The Matrix has got to be,alongside T2,the decade's BEST sci.
2027;why?a)It's got action by the bucket loads,b)it's special effects are clever and artfully done,c)it is original and d)it has BRAINS too!The script is very intelligent(cheers go to the film's creators) and the film itself is very artistic too(in a sci.
2028;I have always considered this movie to have one of the best philosophical messages of all time.
2029;Okay, this film's kinda fun if you don't think about it too hard, but when people characterize it as thought.
2030;all in all, a truly preposterous film, yet strangely enjoyable.
2031;Just phase out the bits where it tries and fails to be profound, enjoy the goofily mindless action sequences, and laugh at the numerous unintentionally funny segments, and you should spend an enjoyable couple hours.
2032;In fact they are more like terroists than freedom fighter's.5)The fight scenes are good then you see a Jet Li movie and you see real figh scenes.
2033;the film is severly overrated and I hope the sequel is better.
2034;I had a chance to see Andy and Larry Wachowski's ground breaking thrill ride a minute movie, The Matrix, last night.
2035;I have to say that as writers the two brothers are very good Directors.
2036;The story is fairly straightforward.
2037;Afew special people are able to break out of this dream life and begin their battle against the computers.
2038;A man who will be able to fight the computers with their own strengths and lead humanity back to the pinnacle of life where we once existed.
2039;Morpheus believes he has found this person when he finds Neo.
2040;The rest of the story details the training of Neo, the discovery of a traitor in their ranks, and the eventual battle between Neo and the Agents of the computer.
2041;The special effects and the action sequences keep this movie going.
2042;for the most part the actors do their best with the roles they have been given.
2043;He is able to draw attention to himself at any time without saying a word and when he speaks his voice wraps itself around you and transports you away with its power.
2044;She is, in a word, BAD.
2045;Ripley would be proud of her.
2046;Keanu Reeves has done a good job as an action hero before.
2047;Some scenes, like when he walks through the metal detector and unleashes an arsenal are great.
2048;His acting ability has frequently been in question and this is one of those times.
2049;Remember my comments concerning the power of Fishburn's voice?
2050;He knows that Morpheus holds the key to the computer myth of the Matrix.
2051;A high tempo soundtrack that gets your pulse kicked into overdrive.
2052;The fight scenes are surreal.
2053;The computer effects are so fluid, you catch yourself gasping at how real it all seems.
2054;the cast is put together nicely.
2055;One of the few movies I can watch over and over.
2056;well this is a great movie that makes you think that what if that was possible and what if we were just dreaming like slaves
2057;This really is a great movie.
2058;screen leave you with a dissatisfied feeling.
2059;But apart from that it's marvellous to just watch the movie for its outstanding special effects!
2060;"I liked this movie, I mean its worth watching, but its all the while a question of ""suspend your disbelif"", because this is just so unlikely."
2061;Simply put, this movie was a marvel of technology.
2062;and a great storyline to go along with it.
2063;Well first let me start by saying that if you like Anime then you will love this movie, If you are into computers you will love this movie if you like seeing a fine woman in tight leather/latex you will like this movie.
2064;the fight scenes are absolutely brilliant.
2065;The cinimatography in this film is superb, the way that the directors use the bullet time is spectacular, not too much like in that TGIFridays commercial.
2066;I already saidThis is a movie collection worthy to by owned.
2067;i think these movies are some of the best out there.
2068;great story line and great acting.
2069;This is the first Matrix movie and it's really the best.
2070;The special effects are ground breaking and the cinematography is as well.
2071;This is the first of the trilogy and its still with out a doubt, the best.
2072;This movie is one of the very best I have ever seen.
2073;The special effects are just so intelligent,I'm sure everyone who worked on this movie was just amazed at what they achived.
2074;I have seen this movie 5 times, it is so fabulous.
2075;Keanu is awesome, Neo and Trinity are great characters.
2076;sufficient, and then when their creaters try to pull the plug, the machines stay alive and enslave the human race.
2077;net), created a nuclear was between Russia and America when their creators tried to pull the plug.
2078;three stars, for originality, action, acting, and I had a really great time watching the movie and felt refreshed afterwards, like I travelled somewhere.
2079;This movie is 100% original with wonderful acting, top.
2080;notch story, wonderful special effects and the latest, best fight and gun sequences ever made!
2081;This visually stunning film introduces us to the world of the future where machines rule, and most of humankind has been reduced to a power source.
2082;With a heart pounding pace this film takes you on a special effects ride through this machine world, with new technologies like Bullet Time and CGI's, along with Hong Kong style wire fight scenes it held me gluded to my seat until the end.
2083;I throughly enjoyed the ride and anxiously await the sequel.
2084;If you go to You Tube you can watch the Matrix Triology decoded by Mark Passio, very insightful
2085;A great achievement in story, concept, and special effects.
2086;This is Reeves at his best .
2087;there are a few themes that films can use that (in my mind, at least) almost always work well.
2088;The Matrix manages to touch on two of them: the fight for freedom and overcoming fear.
2089;Wrap that around a slick sci.
2090;popping effects and you've got something that can keep me in my seat and smiling for a couple of hours.
2091;Simply put, the movie just oozes cool.
2092;And that's a good thing.
2093;overall, The Matrix is at its best delivering the stereotyped Hong Kong style action, but its the surrounding script and Reeves's supporting cast that make this a memorable flick.
2094;Laurence Fishburne gives a great, no.
2095;My vote for the best performance in this one, though, has to go to the small role of the Oracle, brought to life by Gloria Foster.
2096;Foster's performance makes sure this one stays tied together.
2097;But on another note, the cast did an excellent job in this film.
2098;The effects alone are worth the your time.
2099;I cant wait to see the second one!
2100;I give this movie a ten!
2101;There are a few who know the truth and want to help wake up those who don't realize it.
2102;The tension of the film comes when one of the inner circle decides to betray the others.
2103;Call it bureaucracy is better than starving.
2104;an instant hit when it was first released in 1999, it has to be admitted that the film works on the level of story alone.
2105;Computer animation and a multitude of special effects open the way for stunning action sequences (justifying the R rating) and a fast.
2106;It immediately raises a host of philosophical questions about what constitutes reality and what is true knowledge.
2107;Questions like these are precisely the ones that are at the heart of the philosophical discipline of epistemology.
2108;"At times, these philosophical questions become the subject of amusement and humor, such as when Cypher chooses the pleasures of the artificial world rather than the real one, simply because of the material pleasures of a good meal it offers: ""You know, I know this steak doesn't exist."
2109;I know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious.
2110;It takes faith to perceive the true reality of an ongoing spiritual warfare that involves angels and demons, and the rule of Jesus Christ.
2111;"In that sense the story of the Matrix can be used as a parable of coming to faith, and how through the Word our eyes are opened and we learn to ""see"" the ""real"" world for the first time."
2112;"The imagery of being plugged into the false world of the Matrix also bears rich parallels with the appeal of slavery to sin, as Morpheus notes: ""That you are a slave, Neo."
2113;"Elsewhere he states that ""these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy."
2114;"Little wonder that Cypher makes his choice to remain a slave to the Matrix: ""All I do is what he tells me to do."
2115;you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit.
2116;Great literature throughout the ages has drawn on Christian symbolism to make stories more powerful, and that seems to be what is also happening in this movie.
2117;Those symbols have power in themselves, because they are true, and as a Christian watching the movie I am affirmed in my own belief system and can find it powerful that way.
2118;Much more can be said on this issue, and these are just tentative reflections.
2119;paced action, that have combined to make the Matrix the wild success it was.
2120;The spiritual depth is in fact somewhat of an illusion .
2121;dressing remains one of the film's attractions, and makes The Matrix much more interesting than the average cinema experience.
2122;It might not answer all the deep philosophical and theological questions it raises, but it has value in raising them, and gives us a good story besides.
2123;It is a huge movie with a huge plot and a huge cast to carry it off.
2124;And I believed every minute of it.
2125;The special effects are great, but its the ones that are doing it that makes it special I still have the picture in my mind of Trinity walking on the wall, Keanu doing Kung Fu and ducking bullets in slo mo or jumping in the air and getting off 3 kicks before hitting the ground.
2126;Gorgeous blu ray steel book edition cover depicting a human baby being created by the Matrix.
2127;This is a classic story of the loaner who steps up to the plate and saves the day.
2128;The charater development is excellent, the cinematopgraphy is cutting edge and the acting is great from everyone, including the extras.
2129;Although you know how the movie will end the trip there is full of unexpected twist.
2130;Even after seeing this movie numerous times I still get excited, all over again, at some of the best parts of this movie.
2131;This is one of the few movies I keep watching over and over again.
2132;The Matrix is to science fiction as carob is to chocolate.
2133;this movie is beyond your imagination.
2134;the storyline, special effects, the dialoge is awesome.
2135;so many deeper levels to this movie.
2136;I've watched it at least thirty times, and everytime i discover something new.
2137;It is very deep, has cool action, and a great plot.
2138;It really makes you think a lot.
2139;I loved and am sure you will too.
2140;It is great movie though.
2141;This film provokes those uninclined to question the deeper meanings of life and states of being, to ponder theories of What is What if.
2142;For those of us who already ponder the Big Questions, this film is an action.
2143;pleasing adventure into the concepts we play with in our heads.
2144;If not, it seems a very good example of how Dreams work.
2145;face with the reality your sitting on the edge of a deep chasm.
2146;The Matrix really makes you think, cool special effects coupled with good acting make this movie unbeatable.
2147;Good films are rare .
2148;fi films with an engaging message even rarer.
2149;All this in addition to the cleanest, most engaging visuals I've seen since Blade Runner.
2150;When you follow the 3 part storyline you will see everything from Avatar, Terminator, Transformers and many others.
2151;I bought the 3 movie set because my honey (10 years married) loves it so I got it in Blu Ray.
2152;Samuel L. Jackson and Keanu Reeves do an amazing job as do all the actors.
2153;Special effects and the fashions are great.
2154;Have fun with this movie, the Wachowski Brothers are, I mean the film gross $500 million.
2155;To set the record straight, There is a very deep plot to this film but you have to be above average intelligence to understand it to its full capacity
2156;hour of this movie had me pleasantly surprised.
2157;Its premise was going somewhere interesting, the pace was good, and (the biggest surprise of all) Keanu Reeves wasn't that annoying.
2158;When something as technologically amazing as The Matrix comes out, what can you do except get on the ride and hang on?
2159;I saw this movie a while back, and it was incredible!When you enter this movie, you're introduced into The Matrix.
2160;especially when it come to keeping the peace.
2161;everything about the movie was fairly good, though the real treat is the visual effects, as you've probably heard by now.
2162;The computer graphics are seamless and perfect.
2163;they really add flavor to the movie.
2164;a refreshing look into the paranoid.
2165;The acting is good, too, and Keanu Reeves does a great job with his role.
2166;This movie is philosophical and deep at times, and then a few moments later it's full of good guys duking it out with creepy agent guys.
2167;It's not often you laugh because something is soo cool.
2168;fi thriller that will keep you ion the edge of your seat, expand your mind and melt your heart.
2169;Starring the gorgeous Keanu Reeves and a large cast of others including Carrie Anne Moss.
2170;Through the loud music and wild dancing of the futuristic people, Trinity approaches Neo.
2171;She tells him just what he has felt all his life, there is so much more to it than he thinks.
2172;The Matrix is a fantastic film, it has plenty of special effects,action and Keanu Reeves.
2173;FANTASTIC storyline, mesmerizing special effects, awesome soundtrack .
2174;"This movie is kool, i's full of action and it
I:8405;2175;Asks old questions on the nature of our reality in a fresh, new way.
I:8405;2176;for the rest of you it's a great movie to introduce you to the world of Sci.
I:8405;2177;after seeing the trailor with it's sweet graphics and Laurence Fishburne who is one of my favorite,and underrated,actors I had to see the movie.
I:8405;2178;keanu Reeves easily gives his best acting job in his entire career.
I:8405;2179;actually the entire cast does a solid acting job.
I:8405;2180;if you really loved the movie check out Dark City ,which is a masterpiece,and Akira ,an even bigger and better masterpiece.
I:8405;2181;Later in the movie keanu reeves's character get some more character and shows us that wonderful black outfit!Best movie fight ever is to be expected between Agent Smith and Neo.
I:8405;2182;This is a great film with a stunning soundtrack, and fantastic visual effects.
I:8405;2183;I'm a fan of all types of movies, and coming up with a top 10 list is a challenge for anyone.
I:8405;2184;This movie is full of eye candy, drama, action, great acting, comedy, and thrills.
I:8405;2185;The featurette on how they filmed the sweeping 360 degree slow motion scenes is fascinating.
I:8405;2186;I have to say, it was very good.
I:8405;2187;But overall, I really kinda loved it.
I:8405;2188;The costumes were so cool.
I:8405;2189;The Lobby scene has to be my favorite scene, not because I'm a lover of violence (I'm not), but because it must've been so fun to film, and how the guard reacts when Neo goes through the scanner.
I:8405;2190;The script could've been better, and the Agents were a little boring, but it was visually entertaining, and there was something about it that I really felt drawn to.
I:8405;2191;But the first movie was really good, and the costumes are cool, and it's just a great movie.
I:8405;2192;This is the best of the trilogy.
I:8405;2193;This movie will be a classic for ages to come.
I:8405;2194;The special effects of this movie were fantastic, and to think that they even had to invent new ways to film just so that they could get the right shots.
I:8405;2195;It kind of makes a person feel good knowing that they have seen the best movie of the century.
I:8405;2196;I watched it when I was younger and wanted to watch it again as an adult.
I:8405;2197;Its a good solid movie and way beyond its time when released.
I:8405;2198;This movie has been a favorite of mine since it was in the theater.
I:8405;2199;I've always loved this movie and watched it many times.
I:8405;2200;Overall enjoyed watching it very much.
I:8405;2201;I haven't seen a movie this good in a long time and I watch a lot of movies.
I:8405;2202;TThis is sure to be one of my all.
I:8405;2203;potato audiences that they thrill.
I:8405;2204;So it's understandable that ''The Matrix,'' a furious special.
I:8405;2205;Aiming their film squarely at a generation bred on comics and computers, the Wachowskis stylishly envision the ultimate in cyberescapism, creating a movie that captures the duality of life a la laptop.
I:8405;2206;in a film that's as likely to transfix fans of computer gamesmanship as to baffle anyone with quaintly humanistic notions of life on earth, the Wachowskis have synthesized a savvy visual vocabulary (thanks especially to Bill Pope's inspired techno.
I:8405;2207;the most salient things any prospective viewer need know is that Keanu Reeves makes a strikingly chic Prada model of an action hero, that the martial arts dynamics are phenomenal (thanks to Peter Pan.
I:8405;2208;Neat tricks here echo ''Terminator'' and ''Alien'' films, ''The X. files,'' ''Men in Black'' and ''Strange Days,'' with a strong whiff of ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' in the battle royale being waged between man and computer.
I:8405;2209;Nonetheless whatever recycling the brothers do here is canny enough to give ''The Matrix'' a strong identity of its own.
I:8405;2210;And what that function may be is so complicated that it takes the film the better part of an hour to explain.
I:8405;2211;traveling vehicle called Nebuchadnezzar), the hacker is gradually made to understand that everything he imagines to be real is actually the handiwork of 21st.
I:8405;2212;(But on the evidence of Mr. Reeves's beautiful, equally androgynous co. star, Carrie.
I:8405;2213;Mr. Fishburne's Morpheus does what he can to explain how the villain of a film can be ''a neural interactive simulation'' and that the Matrix is everywhere, enforced by sinister morphing figures in suits and sunglasses.
I:8405;2214;''The Matrix'' is the kind of film in which sunglasses are an integral part of sleekly staged fight scenes.
I:8405;2215;fast virtual scene changes (as when Neo wishes for guns and thousands of them suddenly appear) and the martial arts stunts that are its single strongest selling point.
I:8405;2216;As supervised by Yuen Wo Ping, these airborne sequences bring Hong Kong action style home to audiences in a mainstream American adventure with big prospects as a cult classic and with the future very much in mind.
I:8405;2217;The Director, and the rest of the support group did an excellent job with putting the film together.
I:8405;2218;Mr Fishburne did and excellent job in his portrayal.
I:8405;2219;The rest of the cast also did an excellent job.
I:8405;2220;This action packed movie is a thrill ride for just about anyone to enjoy.
I:8405;2221;As we all know, the movie is really great and worth people to watch it for more than one time.
I:8405;2222;The Matrix is a great movie.
I:8405;2223;I ordered it and it arrived in good time and in good condition.
I:8405;2224;I am happy with the service.
I:8405;2225;one of the best movies i have seen in all my nineteen years of existence
I:8405;2226;Very seldom do we see something at the movies that can change the look u have on the reality.
I:8405;2227;the Matrix really opens your mind and makes you think 'WOW, amazing'.
I:8405;2228;The story line is as famous as the well.
I:8405;2229;Although many people didn't understand the film they still enjoyed the cast, the clothes and the action, AKA me at first!
I:8405;2230;The entire trilogy was great in my opinion, the two films that followed were not as mind bending as the original Matrix film, but the action and SFX made up for that!
I:8405;2231;This is one good movie!
I:8405;2232;I went to go see this movie because it looked cool, and I got what i expected and then some.
I:8405;2233;This series is Serial Experiments Lain (extreamly good series!
I:8405;2234;but hey I love anime and I love the matrix.
I:8405;2235;The Matrix is a classic though because it's the first movie that really has the bullet time shooting/dodging effect and has some absolutley brilliant martial art fighting scenes.
I:8405;2236;The first time you see the slo mo stuff, you'll know that this is some cool stuff.
I:8405;2237;fi and martial arts and ends up making a classic movie that is the first of a a kind.
I:8405;2238;This one isn't boring and weird like a lot of parts in the sequels and instead has a compelling story, a unique plot and some absolutely wicked cool fighting.
I:8405;2239;Watch this one, if you haven't already, because it's a one of a kind movie.
I:8405;2240;bTW, I thought the Matrix was/is a great movie for anyone who likes a little thinking with their summer blockbuster.
I:8405;2241;fi/action/conceptial film that I've seen, period.
I:8405;2242;The Matrix is one of the classics of the sci.
I:8405;2243;It also really got me thinking.
I:8405;2244;I recomend this to peeps who like suspencful movies and in a way mysteries!
I:8405;2245;A conservative software programmer .
I:8405;2246;will be designed for the master hacker .
I:8405;2247;morpheus: The Matriz is everywhere .
I:8405;2248;And the truth is the answer behind Neo' s intriguing question is : that you are a slave.
I:8405;2249;The perfect world was a ream that your primitiove cerebrum keep trying to wake up from.
I:8405;2250;designed to this: the peak of your civilization.
I:8405;2251;the film has multiple readings but to my mind you have to go to Dostoievski and the Great Inquirer .
I:8405;2252;and William Blake can give us important references to understand the real state of the things in which we are immersed.
I:8405;2253;this is a film intellectual stimulating.
I:8405;2254;The Matrix is a gem of a movie.
I:8405;2255;I experienced it as a highly emotionaly and brilliantly choreographed science fiction fantasy.
I:8405;2256;The Wacowski brothers are talented directors.
I:8405;2257;And they are just so cool!
I:8405;2258;Anyway, I loved it, everyone I know loves it, and I know you'll love it too.
I:8405;2259;I watched it 4 times and every time I find something new.
I:8405;2260;There is a message in every scene in this movie and you need to pay lots of attention to understand it.
I:8405;2261;This movie is, simply speaking, the best cyberpunk.
I:8405;2262;like production performed so far.
I:8405;2263;The bare story is pretty darn good too.
I:8405;2264;the premise is believable, the acting is superb, we get to watch Carrie.
I:8405;2265;It's just a really wild story.
I:8405;2266;core video game playing would be worth it in the end.
I:8405;2267;It turns out that the world as we know it is actually a super.
I:8405;2268;realistic online computer game and I HAVE THE BEST CHARACTER!!!
I:8405;2269;game playing prowess impresses the ladies so much so that super.
I:8405;2270;Still, while the superhuman leaping and springing were a fresh look two years ago, the technique has become SO overdone in action movies lately that it no longer impresses but rather annoys.
I:8405;2271;I'd MUCH rather see a real martial arts expert show off his (or her) stuff than some CGI.
I:8405;2272;I love it because of the actors and the storyline.
I:8405;2273;The graphics look so real,it is so great!!!
I:8405;2274;i liked it a lot.
I:8405;2275;i think keanu is kinda cute.
I:8405;2276;This movie is worth the price just to get to watch Keanu Reeve's mouth disappear!
I:8405;2277;The most important one is the """"Pullet Time"""" technology which is dedicated to the Matrix"""
2278;but when i actually saw the movie it was great.
2279;neo looks real good in the black.
2280;Ah yes, the classic Matrix.
2281;You can truly call this movie one of the most influencial movies of the past ten years, dazzling all with it's amazing special effects, its amazing plot and top notch action sequences.
2282;depth look at all three movies and how they work together.
2283;the things that stuck with me the most after watching the movie for the first time was the action and the enormously cool agents.
2284;I also liked how Neo eventually accepted who he was and what he could do (interesting fact: Neo does not say anything over five lines long until the end of the movie).
2285;The action sequences are of course top notch and hold up quite well five years later, except that the sentinels look a bit plain and cheap.
2286;On its own, its an incredibly good movie that's well worth seeing.
2287;Just imagine a film that changes your entire perspective on your exsistence.
2288;This film is a masterpiece right from the mind blowing special effects to the excellent storyline.
2289;The visual appeal, the blue.
2290;but there's more : the sexy voice of Lawrence Fishburn, the cool and emancipated Carrie.
2291;ann Moss (The line Dodge This is the coolest line a chick has said in a film for a long time!)
2292;He plays without a doubt the best part in the film, particularly when he gives Morpheus the lecture about the human race being a disease.
2293;You just gotta love his face, his voice, Smith is sexy, funny, merciless and so very, very bad.
2294;This movie is the best Sci/fi to drop for 1999 and none can touch it.
2295;This is one of my best videos for 99 and i'm not losing or selling for nothing.
2296;This is entertainment at its best.
2297;this is one of my favorite movies.
2298;This is the best movie I have every seen.
2299;stop action,thought provoking and romantic movie will have you glued to the screen from beginning to end.
2300;I'll bet you money that you'll watch it twice and keep it for the rest of your life.
2301;Excellent story, excellent special effects, everything ties together seamlessly.
2302;great special effects, great story, great great great.
2303;I've enjoyed the segments I've seen of this movie, but had yet to see the whole thing.
2304;Visually, this movie cannot be beat.
2305;He made the movie, in my opinion.
2306;The angle shown of the agent dodging bullets differed from the hero doing the same thing, and this added to the suspense and the concern for the hero.
2307;the story is a bit on the dark side, without one conclusively knowing who survived except for Neo (Keanu Reeves).
2308;this movie fits into a relativistic mindset.
2309;Neo definitely fits into a substitute Messiah, having skills the others do not have.
2310;The ideal, though, is to be antinomian, that is, without rules.
2311;This is a great movie, especially for sci.
2312;up for The Matrix, which cleverly twists reality.
2313;bending special effects add to the already clever, original plotline.
2314;Keanu Reeves, often a very underrated actor, stars a Neo, the possible savior of humankind from machine.
2315;anne Moss, in her first big Hollywood hit, scored big as Trinity, the female fighter aboard the ship/Neo's eventual love interest.
2316;All actors, who did most of their own stuntwork, pull of their characters better than most actors could manage in a film that highlights its flashy special effects.
2317;Have I mentioned that Keanu Reeves is great in this?
2318;Want to see the future of film.
2319;Truely stunning use of cutting.
2320;making technology combines with a strong plot and great characterisation (Fishburne is particularily good) to produce a film experience that will not be soon forgotten.
2321;it does deliver a lot of potential (that the sequels failed to honor) and has been influential on post.
2322;modern action but no matter how much I know The Matrix is loved I just can't get over the fact that I've seen most of it in other movies.
2323;It's the style of the Matrix that's more fondly cherished than the story.
2324;It won 4 technical Academy Awards, proving that all the Matrix is is eye.
2325;When Hollywood finally learns that less is more it may very well be one of the final signs of the apocalypse.
2326;this movie actually got my interest back, and lost it again, at least twice over the course of the circuitous storyline, but too often fell back on old SciFi cliches, lengthy explanatory soliloquys to TELL what the convoluted plot couldn't possibly SHOW, and flashy special FX, all of which made me long for one of those good old half hour Twilight Zone, is reality just a dream episodes.
2327;She said, You know it will, they're not going to end it here.
2328;What I find much more societally unsettling than this movie's scenario, is that so many people thought this movie was great.
2329;The REAL Matrix is an entertainment industry that keeps feeding stuff like this to an audience that just keeps mindlessly saying, Thank you, sir, might I have another?
2330;The essense of the Matrix is profoundly philosophical and spiritual.
2331;Real vs. imagination pulls me in every time and this film does an excellent job of presenting it.
2332;The special effects are fabulous and the music is excellent.
2333;I recommend it to everyone.
2334;This one makes you think and has application to all facets of life.
2335;This by far is one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood in a very long time.
2336;We are definitely hooked on the Matrix.
2337;anne Moss as Trinity is the perfect female role model, she's beautiful, she's feminine, she knows how to take command of a situation and she kicks major you.
2338;The more times I see this movie, the more I grow to love it and the more questions I have.
2339;The Wachowski brothers have outdone themselves with this gem of a film and I can hardly wait for parts 2 and 3 to come out in theaters.
2340;This movie is and outstanding account of cyberworld philosophy mixed with high.
2341;or at least one of the best movies in a LONG time.
2342;the visual effect is stunning the (in.)
2343;winning special effects specially developed for this movie.
2344;"Laurence Fishburn does a great performance as Morpheus, his voice nearly hipnotizes you into believing what he's telling you about ""the world not really being what it seems""."
2345;One of the best performances is delievered by Carrie.
2346;ann Moss as Trinity, she really gets the right mix of vunerability, beaty, and toughness, and delivers some of the best lines in the movie.
2347;and look out for Joe Pantoliano as Cyprus (I love his acting) and, oh yeah, the Oracle!
2348;Saw the movie 4 times in the theatre, seeing new things all the time.
2349;This movie is probably the most entertaining movie I've seen sofar, and I've seen a gazilion.
2350;The Matrix could quite possibly the movie to surpass Star Wars as the greatest FX movie ever.
2351;I myself am a huge Star Wars fan but in many aspects The Matrix is better then Star Wars: Episode 1.
2352;When you watch this movie, you must use an open mind.
2353;Keanu Reeves is excellent as always.
2354;The Matrix itself is an amazing action movie with mind blowing special effects.
2355;It keep my intrest from start to finish and only a few movies actually ever keep my intrest from start to finish.
2356;The plotline I agree with most people makes you think of that was the real world and your eyes were just open for first time for example when you can say welcome to the real world.
2357;So if your looking for for a great action film with scfi elements and great fight scenes then this is the movie for you to enjoy time and time again.
2358;Of course the movie is good, with much suspense and movement, the special effects are great as usual, Keanu Reeves is very, very charming.
2359;And there's quite much to say.
2360;Open your eyes and you'll see that the fighting sequences have been taken from Hong Kong kung.
2361;As we know, Hollywood has become a master place in the art of imitation and recovery.
2362;"With ""The Matrix"", the big shots can say they made a totally innovative movie (some others said 'the best sci."
2363;He manages to keep away from caricature and makes his bad character one of the most believable and scary ones, in action movie history.
2364;But when I see him fighting and flying all over around in a perfect, high.
2365;Lawrence Fishburne, as the charismatic Morpheus, is excellent too.
2366;"so I'll say that after their very personal and imaginative first film, ""Bound"", the Wachowski brothers, as many others like Bryan Singer, blew up their style and sold their souls to Hollywood."
2367;The Matrix is quite a good movie with a good plot borrowed from mangas but with a too obvious influence of the kung.
2368;fi film with a lot of action and a thought.
2369;Fewer still can completely hold my interest a second time.
2370;This is one of the rare movies that I can enjoy every few months.
2371;ironically, the special effects that draw you into accepting the reality of The Matrix ultimately support a plot that forces you to challenge any notion you may have about objective reality.
2372;I didnt want to see this movie at first.
2373;The plot you can follow and the cast is great in roles which could seem somewhat silly at times.
2374;the most pivotal thing for me in this film is REAL actors doing REALLY good kung.
2375;The fight scenes are amazing if they do suffer from a bit too much wire work for my tastes.
2376;there is also the stunning visual effects utilizing a brand new method of film making.
2377;so subtle use of green through out the film, aside from this is one of the best films of 1999.
2378;A must see for just about any movie fan!
2379;What can I say after so many reviews have been posted, except this was one of the very finest movies I have ever seen!
2380;It ranks right with the original Star Wars Trilogy.
2381;The special effects are breathtaking.
2382;especially the terrific acting job of Laurence Fishburne.
2383;For a most memorable time, you can't go wrong with this movie.
2384;riveting lines like, Whoa , Yea , and Dodge this should have been left for 'Bill Ted 2'
2385;Well the movie describes very well how the thing are working in our world.
2386;It is the time to wake up and the movie can just give you the little hint you need to see the world as it is.
2387;A great take on radical skepticism.
2388;Draws on some incredible modern (and even ancient) philosophy.
2389;I really love the concept, fashion and music of this movie.
2390;THis was the best movie i have ever seen!
2391;This movie is the best movie i ever saw the only flaw is the acting.
2392;The acting is okay but not perfect.
2393;The special effects are great, no better than great, supereffic.
2394;rated movies of all time.
2395;You're the ONE That's it.
2396;You don't even have to see this movie to enjoy the other 2.
2397;I first saw The Matrix the day it premiered in theaters, after I saw a preview that peaked my interest in the movie.
2398;The Wachowski Brothers have succeeded in making one of the most fresh and innovative Sci.
2399;fi/action movies ever made, with a gripping storyline, nonstop action, and stellar acting performances across the board.
2400;I've often heard people talk about Keanu Reeves' lack of acting ability, but he plays the part of Thomas Anderson/Neo to perfection in what I consider by far the finest performance of his career.
2401;Reeves portrays an early sense of doubt and disbelief very convincingly, and makes a smooth transition throughout the film as he comes to terms with the real world and his struggle to save it.
2402;Laurence Fishburne,(Morpheus, the leader of the human resistence) who has long been one of my favorite actors, delivers another riveting performance as his charisma and strong presence shine through in this movie.
2403;His interplay with Reeves is especially good, as he helps propel the film's suspenseful moments.
2404;anne Moss delivers a breakthrough role as Trinity, a member of Morpheus' crew as well as Neo's eventual love interest.
2405;The rest of the cast also deliver excellent performances, as they play their supporting roles to perfection.
2406;The strong acting alone would make this a solid movie, but the script really propels this movie into the stratosphere, making The Matrix one of the most innovative stories ever created.
2407;generated prison for the mind is quite new indeed.
2408;The movie continues forward at backbreaking pace, offering riveting plot twists, suspense.
2409;filled action sequences, and some of the best special effects ever to grace the big screen(The combination still and motion picture technology, which is used throughout the film and detalied in an included behind the scenes documentary, is absolutely amazing).
2410;The behind the scenes documentaries are fascinating, and the disc is also packed with loads of other extras that will satisfy any Matrix fan.
2411;The bottom line is this: The Matrix is one of the most innovative movies ever made, backed by excellent acting performances, an incredible script, as well as special effects that set a new standard in the motion picture industry.
2412;This movie will be remembered for years to come.
2413;The Matrix is an instant classic, a movie truly fashioned for the computer age.
2414;tilt adrenaline rush!The special effects are absolutely mind.
2415;the cast is top flight, Keanu Reeve's chararacter's transformation from naive hacker to saviro of the world is played to a T and Laurence Fishburne plays Morpheous with a mix of slickness and substance that only he can do.
2416;This is a truly original, clever masterpiece of a film.
2417;fi with surreal fantasy and is a brilliant action thriller also.
2418;There are plans for 2 more films to be made but I think this will be the best as it's the original story.
2419;The action was great and the storyline was completely new and imaginative.
2420;It has the perfect combination of great actors, great plot, and great special effects.
2421;With great interactive menus and excellent sound and picture.
2422;If you haven't seen this movie, and you like the Alien, Terminator, and Predator films or just films with excellent plots and storylines, then see The Matrix.
2423;This movie takes me right to the edge.
2424;A very slick, clever movie though not as profound as many would have you believe.
2425;but the backdrop for it is vastly more interesting than most similar movies and the special effects are both excellent and well.
2426;For those that enjoy the genre, I certainly recommend it.
2427;It is the best special effects movie of all time.
2428;it is the best movie of all time.
2429;even if your favorite movie is Star Wars.
2430;They say we were taken over by machines and now we are plugged in the matrix to keep us happy and to power the machines.
2431;He is the one who can battle the machines and free the human race.
2432;A great movie that needs a sequal.
2433;I enjoyed it in the theater but even more so at home!
2434;I love martial arts and ground.
2435;breaking special effects, and this movie combined the two with a suspenseful story and characters that I cared about.
2436;The acting was, I thought, very believable and definitely above average for an action movie.
2437;The cast worked their butts off training for the fight scenes and they really are spectacular.
2438;This to me is quite simply the best film of 1999.
2439;After seeing it in the cinema, I thought a great film .
2440;There is so much more to it.
2441;You really have to see the movie more than once to capture it all in.
2442;Also it's full of extras which enhance the viewing expierence.
2443;The behind the scenes feature is great and just basically the story is so original which sets it apart from the cookie cutter crap which is in movies today.
2444;I put it like a good mystery book.
2445;what is The Matrix?CGI effects were still brand new to filmmaking.
2446;She's not Batgirl, but obviously she has the superhuman strength.
2447;She must run to the payphone to answer it.
2448;a new subject is needed.
2449;"His computer displays for him to wake up and has written, ""The Matrix has you."""
2450;generated feature, with the story set between the first and second Matrix films.
2451;Even Keanu Reeves is good in this one.
2452;What I realized was that this was way more than just an incredible film.
2453;A superb movie, one that I can watch over and over again.
2454;The one that comes with my computer is much better.
2455;It was truly ground breaking both in the story and in the special effects.
2456;The story moves well and the cast really had good chemistry.
2457;The Matrix is a movie that is good, but could have been so much better.
2458;This movie has some truly remarkable scenes that left me stunned.
2459;however, good dialogue and plot could have really carried this movie to a whole new level.
2460;There are many reasonable alternatives that could have made the movie more believable and even thought.
2461;see this movie, because it is fun.
2462;I love the visual effect in this movie
2463;This film has it all, a superb action packed film with good acting and an excellent story.
2464;The film is based upon that our life is all a computer program and we are connected to the program living a dream life .
2465;SFX, spiritual biblical parallels, Sci.
2466;This is a great film for fans of Sci.
2467;The behind the scenes footage is great and rally give an in.
2468;The Matrix won Academy Awards for best sound and best sound effects editing in 1999.

2470;The Matrix is one of those movies that is either loved or despised.
2471;The story is a pretty ordinary tale of a person who is unaware that he is destined to save humanity.
2472;(Keanu Reeves is excellent as a man who is never quite sure what is going on.)
2473;The setting is imaginative and well portrayed, although not groundbreaking.
2474;The special effects, however, most certainly are.
2475;I was told this was a great movie, and before becoming sensitive to violence, I might have liked it.
2476;I think that this might be the best film portrayal of existentialism.
2477;Whether you want to watch a film that gives you a primer on existential philosophy or you love existential film then this is the movie for you.
2478;It was pretty much life.
2479;As Neo (Keanu Reeves) is introduced to existentialism and begins to grasp its power, the viewer is brought along for the ride.
2480;His and our reactions are one in the same.
2481;"The directors use Neo as a surrogate for the viewer, our reaction and his are identical and summed up in his powerful use of ""."

2483;The range of emotion which she displays is absolutely phenomena.

2485;This is an overtly New Age theme: will humanity evolve past illusion and conditioned responses?Other fascinating mystical themes include the nature of reality and truth, Biblical themes such as Messianic salvation, spiritual re.
2486;candy and stunning fight scenes, this is a movie heavy on the symbolic.
2487;What a concept, great story line, great cast.
2488;I've bought it and I watch it over and over again.
2489;Hugo is fantastic in this, does alot for the character.
2490;Really neat steelbook collectible, well worth the money.
2491;I loved watching this movie when it first came out.
2492;All of the amazing cinematography has been perfectly ported in the Blu.
2493;ray version, and the magic of this incredible idea has been preserved in the intervening years.
2494;This movie was so dang good.
2495;the special effects are great, the plot is strong, the acting is enough to keep you interested, and the movie as a whole was just superb.
2496;Sure it takes a lot from the Hong Kong movies, but its SUPPOSED to.
2497;Its a great mix of Hong Kong goodness and American fun and sci.

2506;It's very hard to find a movie that has this kind of impact the first time you see it.

2508;Keanu Reeves was witty as Neo 'The Chosen One' with his trademark 'whoa' saying.
2509;Good cinema worthy of watching.
2510;this movie gives up a lot of cool ideas that i never even thought about before.
2511;The Matrix is the greatest sci.
2512;It is a little hard to comprehend the first viewing, but the second time you watch it you will be amazed.
2513;The special effect are the greatest ever created.

2517;the movie The Matrix, created by the Wachowski brothers Andy and Larry, is one of the best science fiction movies out there.

I:8405;2522;Neo also learns that it is he who will presumably be the One, an almighty figure powerful enough to destroy the Matrix itself.
I:8405;2523;the Matrix is compact of greatly improved actors.
I:8405;2524;Instead, he now faces a much bigger, heavier burden"
2525;"His acting of utter shock and awe as he first learns of the Matrix is thoroughly realistic
I:8405;2526;anne Moss also does a great job"
2527;"It's interesting to see a bit of a contrast between Trinity of the real and the virtual
I:8405;2528;Laurence Fishburne, as the leader of the rebels Morpheus, creates a sense of authority and acts a spiritual supporter of Neo.
I:8405;2529;His gentle conversations of Neo are filled with confidence, and his voice creates a tranquilizing effect when there is great danger ahead"
2530;He is the perfect rival against Neo, also armed with a snappy suit and the strangely cruel smile of his.
2531;The Wachowski brothers certainly make us open our mouths at the right beginning.
2532;The whole progress of this single action scene is so slow, so simple yet so beautiful.
2533;"The cinematography used in this scene is so famous that it even has it's own distinctive name
I:8405;2534;I actually hummed along with the exciting music, hypnotized by such artistic fight sequences.
I:8405;2535;While I watched the movie, I just had to admit that the movie was mainly created for the mass population, who are easily lured and fascinated by some tricky graphics or cool action scenes.
I:8405;2536;overall, The Matrix is quite an awesome movie.
I:8405;2537;It presented to us a whole knew theory"
2538;In addition, some spectacular action scenes spiced up the movie, thanks to the innovative minds of the Wachowski brother.
2539;As the first tale of the Matrix trilogy, this movie has great significance.
2540;The acting, script, and action sequences are wonderfully done.
2541;The soundtrack is one of the best heart.
2542;as for myself, I enjoyed it immensely in spite of the overt Christian symbolism.
2543;A balanced article on this subject.
2544;"can be found at About dot com: search for ""The Matrix and Christianity""Admittedly I am not the biggest Keanu Reeves fan but in this role he plays the clueless Neo well, and Hugo Weaving is one of modern cinema's classic villains as Mr. Smith."
2545;Also something that we rarly see in action films of todays generation is strong acting, something that The Matrix is full of.
2546;Reeves drops the California surfer dude act and is just plain great.
2547;Fishburn is at his best as Neo's teacher, providing insight into his life, and ours.
2548;this movie comes with the highest recommendation possible.
2549;I was right there with Neo every step of the way.
2550;The film had a very bladerunner/film noir type atmosphere and the music made that even better, so the movie has a good setting.
2551;The action was also pretty impressive for the time because that type of action was rarely (if ever) seen in a Hollywood movie.
2552;I'm not happy about their decision to color correct the film so that it can match the two sequels, but it still looks very good.
2553;Sound is great as well.
2554;And all 3 actors who play the agents do a great job.
2555;The musical score on the other hand is really cool.
2556;If you like well written stories, that will twist your brains, The Matrix is for you.
2557;If you like amazing FX and genius camera shots, The Matrix is for you.
2558;style action scenes, The Matrix is for you.
2559;On one hand, you can enjoy this film purely for the awesome action, the great writing, the amazing choreography, but you can delve as deep as you want into the philosophy and even theology present in the subtext.
2560;The movie is great, my problem is that with all the technology of today why don't they do like VHS movies and format the screen.
2561;what can i say this is the matrix the movie that has spawned movies with CGI a the great bullet time.
2562;it also spawned scary movie.
2563;very orginal story the wachoski brothers are a great pair.

2567;warping twists, the special effects will make you say How'd they do that?
2568;this movie truly sets a new standard for the movie industry!
2569;The Matrix delivers one of the best films for special effects and for a storyline.
2570;I love this film and I`ve yet to find anyone who didn`t feel the same too !
2571;Like Star Wars 20 years before, Matrix draws on many cultural elements and ideas and weaves them together in a wholy original, well.
2572;The result is at the very least refreshing, often creative, and always engaging.
2573;"There is a rich, compelling universe
I:8405;2574;notch special effects"
2575;to me, a good movie is one that compells additional viewings and strives for originality.
2576;It's a well paced, action packed, philosophical science fiction master piece.
2577;It looks and sounds superb on Blu.
2578;ray and it has all the special features (related only to the first movie) that come in the collector's set plus a color booklet.
2579;"the digibook package hasn't been received with unconditional love by everyone, but it does give a ""special edition feel"" and provides decent protection to the disc."

2583;however, the rest of the movie more than makes up for it, with Awesome fight scenes, Exellent visual effects, and a great ending sequence.
2584;The Matrix is the definition of high tech visual effects.
2585;Many of the stunts and actions performed in the movie have to be seen to be believed.
2586;The performances of the actors and actresses in the film are also sensational.
2587;I don't want to give anything away but take my word for it The Matrix really gives you a chill with the situation it proposes for humanity.
2588;i highly recommend viewing this film if you haven't already, and if you have well you know what I am talking about and should probably watch it again.
2589;Very cool movie, amazing special effects.
2590;Great story as well .
2591;Weird, huh?Visuals: Amazing special effects, art direction, cinematography, everything!
2592;overall Visuals Grade: A+Acting:They'll probably get nominated at the MTV Movie Awards, but they were all still very believable and good.
2593;Just smooth as a baby's a** writing.
2594;If they have a good sense of real and make.
2595;Fans of writers Phil Dick and William Burroughs will love the paranoia deep at the heart of this stylish movie.
2596;green, the Wachowski brothers have made an intelligent, thought.
2597;I'm especially fond of the way the script slowly unfolds our understanding, rather than trying to lay it all out for us, and the look of the movie is as close to genuine cyberpunk as anyone's yet come.
2598;When I saw the trailer I immediately wanted to see this movie .
2599;The special effects are so great, and the cast is good !
2600;But still, The Matrix is a movie to be seen !
2601;The special effects are awesome.
2602;and just simply one of the best movies of all time.
2603;and robots take over the world we are in now!
2604;Some real neat individual scenes (like stopping bullets in mid air) and a few interesting insights make for a very entertaining film but do not in my opinion put this in the same category of scc.
2605;What I am trying to say is that in both cases the viewer must accept a complete vision of a world that has been captured extremely stylishly by the directors.
2606;anne Moss appealing in her vinyl full body suit.
2607;As a team, they are great when they set off to rescue Laurence Fishburne.
2608;No holds barred, a terrific scene.
2609;Great pacing, high level of excitement.
2610;The Matriz is the best movie i have ever see, and i've seen a lot of movies!
2611;the special effects were amazing, the actors were great, the plot was ingenious, i loved it, the thought that we might be living in a dream outside of real life is amazing, i loved it, and it gets better every time i see it!
2612;I liked this movie because it is thought.
2613;The movie was also fantasy but also delightfully realistic.
2614;This is an exceptional film, full of action, suspense, mystical philosophy and symbolism.
2615;This story is a wonderful allegory for human existence and civilization, and the film has excellent effects, solid acting, and an impressive script for a movie of this genre.
2616;In my critique, the best movie of 1999 was 1.
2617;ETC But MAtrix is the movie that is most imaginary, has coolest special effect, and sound in 1999.
2618;Matirx was imaginary, cool ideas, and most critical movie about human beings.
2619;This is my favorite movie
2620;and that man is Johnny Utah.
2621;Lots of guns, special effects, explosions, lots of fighting, good acting, and dare I say a good plot.
2622;It puts an interesting prospective on our world and it puts a new demension to action movies.
2623;The Matrix works because it repackages themes from older movies, and, indeed, older literature and mythology, in a cutting edge, sci.
2624;It's more than just a wrapping actually.
2625;cinematically, there's a strong thread going back to Kubrick's 2001.
2626;(At the same time, there are nice, even heroic machines: C3PO and R2.
2627;the Matrix takes this to a whole new level.
2628;The Machines have already won.
2629;"The new, ingenious twist is that they are controlled not so much by physical force but by mind: the Matrix software that feeds directly into the brain and leads humans to believe they live normal lives when ""in reality"" they sit in life support pods providing electrical power for the machines."
2630;It truly is the grand illusion.

2635;arnold returns in T.2 to be the good guy, the father figure, humanity's savior.
2636;the Matrix works for many reasons, and has many facets, but its main one, in my opinion, is this age.
2637;We can rediscover our humanity, even in a very insane, often inhumane world, whose technological influence is all.
2638;The Matrix follows the formula to the letter and succeeds.
2639;pounding action movie with jaw.
2640;laurence Fishburne is at his understated best as the leader of the rebellion, while Keanu manages to look appropriately stylish and not botch his lines (which means he's in top form here).
2641;The rest of the cast is essentially scenery and unworthy of comment here.
2642;in movies of this sort, wherein an unrealistic world is created, it is important for the plot to be subject to some hard and fast rules.
2643;The Matrix succeeds admirably as it switches between our world and the virtual one known as the Matrix.
2644;swilling set, The Matrix is great fun.
2645;Love the story and the imagination involved in writing the script.
2646;Still an awesome movie though.
2647;The Matrix is one of the most spectacular Sci Fi Movies of the 20th Century.
2648;Not totally originally, but it combines elements of so many previous Sci Fi flicks that it's more like a tribute to those previous stories.
2649;The movie takes place somewhere in the future, opening with a glimpse of the life of Neo (Reeves in a role he was most likely born to play), a computer programmer working for a large corporation who does hacker work in his off time.

I:8405;2652;The inclusion of high energy martial arts fighting scenes are so ingeniously integrated into the movie as well as other aspects of action, that you have to applaud the writers and directors.

I:8405;2654;fi, or Keanu Reeves movies, I was stunned by how great I thought this one was!
I:8405;2655;The script is great, the directing, cinematography, you name it.
I:8405;2656;fan, I have to admit that he did a very good job in this role, and this movie is a definite winner.
I:8405;2657;This is the type of movie that really makes you think about what's real what's all in your head.
I:8405;2658;Very thought provoking a GREAT movie.
I:8405;2659;After all these years, this movie is still a favorite!
I:8405;2660;Great acting, cool story line, action packed and thought provoking.
I:8405;2661;The most impressive effects are done better in the Gap ads.
I:8405;2662;The tiny viewing box on my large 31 inch tv makes it completely unenjoyable to watch.
I:8405;2663;I think that The Matrix is a brilliant movie.
I:8405;2664;anne Moss, Laurence Fishburn, and all the actors did a wonderful job.
I:8405;2665;To all the special effects and film crew, great job!
I:8405;2666;The first viewing should be spent enjoying it for its eye.
I:8405;2667;popping special effects, for its outrageous action, for its killer industrial soundtrack, and for the pleasure of watching Keanu Reeves and Carrie.
I:8405;2668;laurence Fishburne projects a powerful presence as the wise Morpheus, although it often seems that he employed William Shatner as his dialogue coach.
I:8405;2669;The real standout in the cast, however, is Carrie.
I:8405;2670;She is a real find, and while she is stunning in a shiny black cat suit, her purpose in this film is not simply ornamental.
I:8405;2671;She is responsible for at least half of this movie's excitement, and she gives it its emotional heart.
I:8405;2672;One is a truly awesome action movie, and the other is a deep meditation on the nature of reality.
I:8405;2673;It can be enjoyed equally on both levels, but maybe not on first viewing.
I:8405;2674;See it at least twice.
I:8405;2675;scenes vignettes, one of which shows Reeves, in full wicked.
I:8405;2676;bad regalia, perform a hilarious, unintentional pratfall.
I:8405;2677;Other than that the movie's good, I would recommend watching it to anybody"
2678;This is my all time favorite movie!
2679;The special effects were amazing!
2680;The effects are dazzleing and the whole movie is amazing.
2681;It's really cool to see how they walked the walls and when Neo and Trinity break into the high security building the fight that results is amazing.
2682;It's one of those movies you can keep watching.
2683;It sars lawerence fishburne who plays morpheous, he brings in neo played by keanu reeves to see what the world is really likes and bring him into the real world as they say in the movie.
2684;I loved the Matrix, I thought that not only was the action good but the story.
2685;If you love big time bovie making and lots of action you will love this movie
2686;Definately one of the best movies of '99.
2687;what other movie (other than maybe star wars) boasts action, love stories, and a philosophical backdrop so interwoven it could catch water?
2688;the human spirit shines in its varieties in The Matrix, from non.
2689;up, with silly kung fu fights, hilarious logical inconsistencies, and a cinematic superhero who, true to formula, finds his magical powers just in time.
2690;The visual effects: If anyone thinks that a good film is based on how stunning its visual and sound effects are?
2691;Federico Fellini, Francis Coppola, and Peter Weir can show viewers great movies by catching the expression that actors provide.
2692;He is the one : Holy Cow!
2693;controlled Matrix is a real cool idea and the script writer made the dialogues clear about the technical terms the actors were speeking.
2694;The Matrix is a movie that is great to own, because you may have to watch it more than once to understand everything.
2695;It has hours of interesting extras, including a 30.
2696;minute HBO 'Making Of' show and a really cool video about Bullet.
2697;It's a great story and very entertaining.
2698;Everything about it is wonderful.
2699;I know it isnt perfect, but I'm a sci.
2700;This movie is fast, adventurous, supenseful the whole chi.
2701;Since it brought a new style to the show biz industry that many directors use in movies and television shows.
2702;Its a great movie for parties because it has everything people like.
2703;True, there are some excellent special effects .
2704;it's just one more sci.
2705;and escapism, contrary to what the majority think, can in fact be great and even substantive, when it is done the right way.
2706;This is one of the best sci.
2707;That this movie is amazing?
2708;The booklet attached to it was the reason I bought this magnificent work of art.
2709;i really enjoyed the movie.
2710;It was a fast moving movie with lots of special effects.
2711;it was really good right up to its limp end.
2712;With a title like The Matrix , and with an actor named Keanu Reeves, I was hoping that this movie was going to be a great vision of William Gibson's stories of Cyberspace, as the movie Johnny Mnemonic was.
2713;Action scenes are realistic due to the use of multiple shots, weapons, and speed.
2714;One of the first movies to ever tackle the majic bullets, infinite ammo.
2715;I saw this movie with my boyfriend as a compromise, and I LOVED it!
2716;Action packed with a unique storyline and FANTASTIC special effects!
2717;The visual effects are stunning, and as a bonus, you get a movie with a good, original plot.
2718;Only one actor has been in the best movies of all time, and Hugo Weaving is it.
2719;The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and V for Vendetta.
2720;hugo weaving brings such presence to the screen in every character he portrays.
2721;The Matrix is one of the best cyber.
2722;punk films out there, hell might even be the best!
2723;The action is explosively entertaining, the plot is strong and original and the cast is excellent.
2724;himself Keanu Reeves is actually surprisingly great in the lead.
2725;time effects are truly amazing, it's no wonder films like Charlie's Angels have tryed to rip it off.
2726;There's just so much good things I could say about this movie.
2727;The Matrix is a truly amazing ride that's hard to forget.
2728;the best one of the Matrix Trilogy.
2729;it has done so much for movies these days.
2730;The matrix had all the elements of a great film.
2731;A well thought out plot, a story that captured your imagination.
2732;Action scenes that were creative and well thought out.
2733;The best performance by Larry Fishburn and Keeanu Reeves that I have ever seen.
2734;Include some great and unique cimematography and non.
2735;traditional mood music and this movie becomes the greatest film of all time.
2736;For anyone who hasn't seen the Matrix, you are missing out on probably the best movie of the year.
2737;This movie has it all, suspense, action, sci fi, and some of the best special effects ever created.
2738;That's really all I can say about this film!!
2739;My husband just loves it and eventually got me quite hooked on it.
2740;I am not a Reeves fan, but his chemisty with Fishburne and Moss is remarkable.
2741;The selling point though will be the special effects, for which I initially saw the movie.
2742;The sheer concept though is revolutionary.
2743;It is, by far, the best science fiction movie to come along in many, many years.
2744;This is by far one of the best sci.
2745;In the virtual reality genre, it makes a great triple bill with The Thirteenth Floor and Tron.
2746;The movie brought a new concept to the future of mankind in movies.
2747;The Matrix is one outstanding movie!You will be glued to your seat watching the movie unfold not wanting to miss anything.
2748;its dynamic visual impact along with the intriguing possibility that the Matrix is a real part of our world is a powerful combination.
2749;ann Moss as Trinity are all superb in their respective parts.
2750;What's not?It is one of the most riveting state.
2751;fi movies of all time and one you will want to watch again and again.
2752;The entire Matrix Trilogy is absolutely terrific.
2753;there are also several insightful books written about the Matrix that would enhance your understanding and appreciation of the movie.
2754;first, there is a high probability that you will have an intense desire to see the other Matrix movies.
2755;This has to be one of my top 10 favorite films.
2756;"The plot is unique
I:8405;2757;The shock scenes that reveal the truth are so well done, I can't begin to describe them.
I:8405;2758;the special effects in this film changed forever how such effects are done in film.
I:8405;2759;The actors move in ways you can't imagine.
I:8405;2760;fu scenes are so good, I watch them again and again.
I:8405;2761;Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Ann Moss give phenomenal performances in the Matrix.
I:8405;2762;The score is great, too.
I:8405;2763;This is the first time I have ever watched this movie and I loved it.
I:8405;2764;All I can say is , maybe this is the Matrix in which we live.
I:8405;2765;Oh, Keanu is definitely easy on the eyes and only adds to the movie.
I:8405;2766;My favorite movie of all time.
I:8405;2767;The special effects were great, The acting was incredible.
I:8405;2768;She is an extremely talented actress.
I:8405;2769;keanu Reeves was actually great in this film.
I:8405;2770;But it had alot of spiritual messages behind this film.
I:8405;2771;The computer usage is dated (as are the cell phones) which is a common thing in films relying on technology, but the story, action and special effects hold up very well.
I:8405;2772;Blu Ray is just an amazing format.
I:8405;2773;with The Matrix you get a great version, almost an ultimate version with this 10th Anniversary.
I:8405;2774;The extras are spectacular, though a little hard to access.
I:8405;2775;As for the extras, there are so many features, 4 Commentaries, a feature.
I:8405;2776;I have noticed that Lightning/electricity comes off really good on Blu Ray.
I:8405;2777;In the original Terminator, the electric crackles in your speakers and seems to pop off your screen.
I:8405;2778;In T2 and T3 the lightning effect is more realistic and thinner.
I:8405;2779;It just looks and sounds so real and great, it's hard to describe.
I:8405;2780;It gets top notch recommendation.
I:8405;2781;fi, action, special effects, mystery or movies that make you think and gasp in awe of what you see, then this is a must.
I:8405;2782;a. kind thought chord in your head.
I:8405;2783;And as for solid action and visuals, well, in my opinion, the last two movies to push digital technology to the edge were 1991's Terminator 2: Judgement Day and of course, 1999's The Phantom Menace.
I:8405;2784;One of the greatest movies of all time!
I:8405;2785;Top special effects and excellent story.
I:8405;2786;very cool, thats how cool.
I:8405;2787;but other than that, seriously, is the rest of that movie interesting?
I:8405;2788;thats just my idea hollywood, feel free to steal it.)
I:8405;2789;and its not like the movie is terrible, but people love this movie to an extreme degree, and i just think.
I:8405;2790;these scences make up a good 7/8s of the movie.
I:8405;2791;well, the kung fu fight was rad.)
I:8405;2792;the matrix had some pretty amazing and original ideas, and it was groundbreaking, but its just so over rated i couldn't help myself but to write this!
I:8405;2793;And, I've seen all the sci.
I:8405;2794;i've seen The Matrix 100 times and will see it 100 more.
I:8405;2795;My wife and I saw it in the movie theater and wanted to see it again.
I:8405;2796;A sci fi thriller to say the least.
I:8405;2797;The software is intense too.
I:8405;2798;When most movies are formulaic, this one had an original plot, great special effects that worked well to progress the story, and good music to boot.
I:8405;2799;Hands down one of my favorite sci.
I:8405;2800;This film's got it all: a great story/script, great performances, superb action, thrills and chills, and awesome special effects.
I:8405;2801;Every element falls into place perfectly to create a truly original, and stunning, experience!
I:8405;2802;The Matrix, a film which stunned the world when it was released back in late March of 1999 is still a great film whichis certainly one of my favorite films of all time.
I:8405;2803;I remember how dazzled I was after viewing this film at the cinema, mainly due to the superb visual effects and well I didn't exactly get the plot that well, but I also was only like 10 years old.
I:8405;2804;The story is much more intricate than that, and may need a few viewings to fully grasp.
I:8405;2805;Overall, this is a visually stunning film and really revolutionized the way action would be done in the future, but I still don't think I would call it the best action movie ever made.
I:8405;2806;But the action is definetly amazing to see, the """"bullet."""
2807;"time"" effect is very unique and original and is surely been one of the most copied off visual effects in recent memory, (ie, Charlie's Angels), though that was still an entertaining movie."
2808;I actually appreciated the sequels and enjoyed them, and I feel they are just as much worth owning as the first film itself.
2809;I loved them and thought that visually they were even more spectacular.
2810;"overall, ""The Matrix"" is a one of a kind picture, with a thought."
2811;provoking storyline and script, nice performances (even from Reeves, who isn't as bad an actor as many think he is).
2812;anne Moss proved to be a great female action star.
2813;if you've been living under a rock for the last 6 years and haven't seen this film, definetly see it because it's well worth checking out.
2814;believe and I believed it!It was amazing to see the Bullit.
2815;The movie makes you wonder about what's real with your own life.
2816;The Wachowski brothers got it right with this movie and should have left the remainder of the story up to the imagination of the viewers.
2817;"This is a great movie about an inner journey
I:8405;2818;The one who's looking into the matrix is his conscious and he has a hard time to see what's going on in this world because it's so much information in this world who hypnotizes the human mind.
I:8405;2819;and has an hypnotic effect .
I:8405;2820;This is one of the best Science Fiction videos I have seen.
I:8405;2821;The effects are stunning, but not overdone (in most cases).
I:8405;2822;he actually is bearable in this film!
I:8405;2823;The story line is straightforward, and is blisfully absent of the 42 plot twists that most movies these days seem to feel are necessary.
I:8405;2824;The special effects are unlike any ever seen to date on film.
I:8405;2825;The extra Making of the film commentary from HBO provides the background which details the committment of the cast and crew in getting ready for this film.
I:8405;2826;Slowly he is tracked by those from the true world, while agents of the external controlling force also monitor him in an effort to capture the others.
I:8405;2827;Neo is eventually awakened into the `real world' and the Matrix takes off on it's epic ride of slow motion Kung Fu mayhem and beautifully choreographed gunfights.
I:8405;2828;This combination of cerebral back story and excessive destruction made this movie a hit across all strata of viewing demographics.
I:8405;2829;I enjoyed it then, and now, it's highly recommended.
I:8405;2830;And as such, the vast majority of society is the enemy of those who really know the truth.
I:8405;2831;Our entire educational system (the perfect example) is set up to prepare people not to be individuals but rather automatons answering the bell and following the herd while making wealthy, fulfilled, and happy people out of the few who can see beyound the smoke screen.
I:8405;2832;To me the film makes the case that within us all there is a power that is far greater than we could ever imagine.
I:8405;2833;As Neo says the choice is up to you.
I:8405;2834;the most powerful and important idea expressed though is that whatever your mind believes is ultimately reality.
I:8405;2835;Also the concept that the data your mind is fed in either a conscious or unconscious state will be accepted and believed holds tremendous promise for more enlightened and truly powerful individuals.
I:8405;2836;the story is awesome, the special effects are beyond belief, the action is fantastic and the premise is not as sci.
I:8405;2837;Came out during the same time The Phantom Menace came out but that one was ok but this is far superior in many ways.
I:8405;2838;recommendations: The Fifth Element, Total Recall, Starship Troopers, Robocop, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Metropolis, Dark City, Ghost in the Shell and Con Air.
I:8405;2839;fi and action movies of all time!
I:8405;2840;The Wachowskis after doing Bound and Assassins wrote produced directed a genuine new classic of the genres.
I:8405;2841;In March of 1999, audiences made this one of the highest grossing movies of the sci.
I:8405;2842;fi genre as both critics audiences embraced this movie including me.
I:8405;2843;fi action cyberpunk at the age of 17 watching this in theaters 7 times it got better with each viewing, the performances are terrific including Keanu Reeves at times even if he's a bit on the wooden side.
I:8405;2844;Some of the dialog is a bit silly but there's good philosophy with outstanding unforgettable sequences that echo anime and John Woo's Hong Kong motion pictures.
I:8405;2845;rays shows flawless picture despite a few grains in a couple of scenes, outstanding sound that rockets the sound system to high rolling.
I:8405;2846;The extras are terrific as In.
I:8405;2847;What I might be able to add is that it is not an easy film to understand, I suggest that before viewing it you read a number of reviews and undertake some analysis of the ideas it presents.
I:8405;2848;The main idea has to do with what is real and what is not real, This concept has a long history dating back at least as far as Plato and the cave, While the movie is a science fiction thriller it is much more than that and to fully appreciate it you should do some research.
I:8405;2849;lt marquee The plot to this is the strongest I have ever seen in a movie, and the whole concept of the matrix is truly amazing and original: basically our conciousness, this reality, isn't real.
I:8405;2850;Just about the greatest movie ever!
I:8405;2851;To rival Hamlet's,Wachowski's write KeanuAn epic speech: Whoa!
I:8405;2852;I found this film to be an incredibly well integrated look at the philosophy of modern man.
I:8405;2853;A great deal of the foundational plot twists follow the concept of _Atlas_Shrugged_, and the story's action is first.
I:8405;2854;he is enslaved by the very talents that make him who he is, and his motive power is being used to sustain a world that is, at base, a fantasy.
I:8405;2855;the parallels are comfortably ensconced throughout the movie, and one gains the impression that the writing here was designed for numerous levels of comprehension and enjoyment.
I:8405;2856;In its own right, """"The Matrix"""" is a top."""
2857;"notch action film, but it is also a paean to individualism and philosophical freedom: ""."
2858;rate film with a trememdously solid cast and truly enjoyable writing.
2859;For those of you with the desire for science.
2860;This brilliantly crafted movie, while being one of the best and most original action films ever made, touches on important metaphysical questions:How is our destiny determined?
2861;This movie may get you to think, or else only to have an intensely exciting and fun 2 hours and 16 minutes.
2862;But to hell with that, it's still a very, very fun ride, and I'll watch it many times.
2863;Worth the price just to make sure your player is up to snuff.
2864;This is one of the best SiFi movies ever produced and no one who claims to know SiFi should have missed it.
2865;The scenes are excellent, as are the picture and sound.
2866;A great thriller with awesome special effects.
2867;Even the acting was sort of good.
2868;It was just one of the dumbest things I had ever seen.
2869;i will not deny that this is a good movie, but it is not in any way a masterpiece or worth spending $20 on.
2870;This was an amazing movie.
2871;The story was unique and original without being contrived.
2872;The action in this movie has some of the most amazing scenes I have ever seen.
2873;The actors were all excellent, even Keanu Reeves, who gives a minimalist, yet realistic performance.
2874;you all have at least heard of the movie, and you all know that it is known for the special effects.
2875;But this movie has depth.
2876;the story was cool, but nothing spectacular.
2877;it's more then awesome special effects, it's an awesome movie all around, one of the best sci.
2878;The story is very ingenious, and philosophical.
2879;but the way the effects, music, and everything about the movie comes together is awesome.
2880;this is an inteligent movie, and is more then a bunch of innovative effects.
2881;if you liked the movie for the effects, and didn't really go too deep in the plot, well watch it again, and take in everything.
2882;it's an awesome movie, and one of the best ever in my opinion.
2883;deserves more then 5 stars.
2884;oh, and another thing, it's totally based around computers and that stuff, so you definately need to have some knowledge or interest in that stuff to really enjoy this movie.
2885;We loved this movie for all it's special effects and action.
2886;"Star Wars did it in the 70's and in my humble view, ""The Matrix"" did it in the 90's."
2887;Matrix raised the bar, and I believe that 30 years for now, it will still be apart of cinema culture.
2888;The Matrix is the Star Wars for my generation.
2889;Great movie, advise everyone to see i
2890;Oh well watch it Im sure you'll like it.
2891;The Matrix brings new meaning to the word creative .
2892;the special effects in the movie are incredible.
2893;Because of the situation the movie takes place in, the makers could go to the extreme with special effects, and they did, and they did a great job.
2894;all around, The Matrix is a very good movie, well worth watching, although you may have to watch it a couple of times to fully understand it.
2895;At the third day He created the Man.
2896;See this one and think about life.
2897;This movie will shock you.
2898;The martial arts are cool, graphics are mindblowing and sweet.
2899;The best ever fight scenes in a movie!
2900;I loved it!Plot: The world is a dream, created by machines.
2901;Groundbreaking special effects and fight sequences.
2902;the best sci fi movie ecer next to 2001.
2903;Matrix is a wonderfully built movie that makes the audience think and expand their thoughts on normal everyday life.
2904;It delivers a fine performance with Keanu Reeves as the star Neo, who may be humanity's last hope.
2905;The film has suspense, action, special effects beyond anything you've ever seen before, and even humor.
2906;The plot twists and turns, but the viewer is able to catch up if they get lost.
2907;such a creative film is a very impressive piece of cinematography.
2908;Never has the audience seen such an array of mind blowing special effects and such an intriguing plot.
2909;the Matrix is a compelling, wonderful movie that you will enjoy as well as think about for days after.
2910;This is the kind of film that you must have if you like the ideas that contradict your mind's paradigms.
2911;"The Matrix is a ""cyberpunk"" classic."
2912;There's also loud, energetic action scenes and gunplay.
2913;picture i sharp but grainy looks good on it thoughsounds great but not the best movie to show off ur tv
2914;This is one of the best films I have ever seen!
2915;It is original, well thought out, and some of the effects are stunning.
2916;It is the first time I have ever been to see a film without coming out and thinking I've seen it all before even the best of other films you can see links to other films.
2917;It is also very clever how it REALLY makes you think about your life and it is plausible that it could happen.
2918;but the best is the Follow the White Rabbit feature.
2919;When it ends you are plopped right back into the movie from where you left off.
2920;The worls is about to experience an event that will in many ways, determine the parameters of popular art within the realm of the most popular and influential of the popular arts, the world of Commercial Film.
2921;With THE MATRIX the Wachowski brothers create and present a perfect example of what the Sci.
2922;contained, and received with enthusiasm by the public, would demand a sequel.
2923;question: What if you woke one day to find and to follow a sequence of remarkale evnts that led to the realizaion that the world around you, including all your most intimate associations, those given to you by your senses, was merely an illusion, a construct desined to control you, subliminally, for the beneift of un.
2924;(3) What if the doping, pleasure.
2925;(8) Would you, as one of the fugitive band of time.
2926;Would you confront it's terrifying and powerful agents?
2927;Will you be able to face it and survive?Phrophecy is funny: People only talk about it, when they talk about it, to show they don't believe in it.
2928;But, a voice speaks through the modem.
2929;I came here to tell you how this is going to begin.
2930;"I'm gong to show them a world without rules or conrols
I:8405;2931;but, alas, nobody is perfect.
I:8405;2932;She needs to loosen up her talent.
I:8405;2933;wanna see an awesome collection of good FX and a great story?
I:8405;2934;Without a doubt a landmark and influential film.
I:8405;2935;The Matrix is one of the greatest sci.
I:8405;2936;the art special effects, and eye popping stunts.
I:8405;2937;So that's why I give this 5 stars.
I:8405;2938;One of the greatest sci.
I:8405;2939;The Matrix, a film masterpiece for the 21st century.
I:8405;2940;I had the privelege of viewing this movie on a very large screen with digital sound in Washington, D. c.
I:8405;2941;The sound is so crisp, and when the scenes go in slow.
I:8405;2942;Reeves does a good job of being the main character, Neo, and it seems like the role was written for him.
I:8405;2943;He shines with the interplay between him and Larry Fishburn, and with the Special Agents who are trying to destroy him.3) The themes!
I:8405;2944;All issues you will be drawn into and have to digest as your view the Matrix.
I:8405;2945;The matrix is a movie, you just have to see.
I:8405;2946;paced, slick barrage of visuals that seemingly jumped from the pages of Heavy Metal and were put to a great soundtrack.
I:8405;2947;The Wachowski Brothers struck a perfect balance between thought.
I:8405;2948;provoking """"What If's"""" and heart."""
2949;It is among my very favorite movies, which I've seen many times and have yet to tire of.
2950;Wonderfull story, beautiful special fx and Trinity rules.
2951;Got this at an excellent price.
2952;Looks and sounds great on my home system
2953;It's got everything a good sci.
2954;fi movie needs: Deep story, fabulous visual effects, a powerful score, and a wonderful cast!
2955;This is a movie I'll enjoy for many years to come, and certainly one of the most entertaining, and most well put.
2956;This movie is one of my all time favorite action flicks.
2957;I have viewed it three times and all of my friends love it too.
2958;The sound effects, music, and special effects are spectacular.
2959;Not only does the movie have killer fighting scenes, but it's ability to make you look deeper and actually have to think helps make this the movie of the century.
2960;In this rather serious and deep movie they add just enough comic relief, while still maintening(and not detracting from) the theme and story line.
2961;It's metehpors and symoblism to the bible was also a nice touch.
2962;I enjoyed the casting, because due to the fact that the cast wasn't very well known so it wasn't easy to confuse the actors roles in this movie with those of past works.
2963;Over all this is the best movie, bar none, that I have ever seen.
2964;Always a great movie wonderful story line, great graphics for the time and sick fight scenes.
2965;i love watching this movie.
2966;one of the best movies I have watch in a long tine.
2967;This Matrix is one of the few high profile Hollywood productions that truly makes the viewer think.
2968;At the same time, it is something that is fun to watch (especially the lobby scene.
2969;After watching it, one of my friends and I came up with an appropriate slogan for its theme, a take.
2970;As the modern Lamborghini is to the Model T, so The Matrix is to movies of the past.
2971;The Matrix is also well known for its complex plot.
2972;In order to understand this movie, the average person must watch it twice.
2973;Because of its complexly intriguing plot and outstanding special effects, the allusions or parallels can go unnoticed by the common person.
2974;The Bible and the 1999 film The Matrix have incredible parallels.
2975;There are names given to people, a place, and a ship that make Biblical names.
2976;"The awkwardness of the name of this ship is the fact that king Nebuchadnezzar was an evil king in the Bible, when in the film Nebuchadnezzar is the name of the humans' ship and they are the ""good guys."""
2977;"In this parallel, the author uses a holy city from the Bible to allude to the ""good guys'"" city in the film, as the Bible refers to the final city as well being Zion."
2978;"The most obvious parallel is the one of the key ""good guy"" characters is named Trinity."
2979;Throughout the entire film, Neo seems like the Jesus in his world.
2980;Jesus performed many miracles in the Bible, just as Neo does in the film.
2981;I watched this film twice and loved it!
2982;provoking, tantalizing, invigorating and exciting.
2983;The Matrix requires the viewer to actually THINK and its story is deliciously deep and twisting, its concept both frightening and infuriating.
2984;the pace of the story, and adding to the overall enjoyment of the film.
2985;as you can see, I loved this film.
2986;Don't believe the negative press this movie has gotten, it is a modern classic.
2987;Especially interesting is the Christ.
2988;Also, for those who like mental stimulation, the questions raised about the nature of reality and existence are incredible!
2989;This was probably the best movie of 1999.
2990;It's whole look and feel was so amazing.
2991;By combining Hong Kong style martial arts action and a Hollywood budget, the Wachowski brothers delivered an awesome movie.
2992;I've always thought that Hong Kong movies needed that Hollywood touch and that a lot of Hollywood action movies needed that Hong Kong style, well, it's happened with the Matrix.
2993;I'm not bothered by Keanu like a lot of people, I thought he was great as Neo and seeing him and Fishburne actually do martial arts was just awesome.
2994;I bought it because this movie is one of the most recent and truest milestones in the story of cinema.
2995;And it's funny, because when the movie was released, back in 1999, it was not an instant success.
2996;The Terminator series comes to mind.
2997;The Matrix is an organic, mind blowing science fiction.
2998;There are lots of fluids, limbs, lack of hair, the design of the machines is also very organic, and the viewers can relate to that in a positive way.
2999;this movie concentrates heavily on its characters.
3000;"but ""The Matrix"" is an excellent movie because of all its elements."
3001;The soundtrack is quite appropriate (energic, full of fury .
3002;"What I do know is that they mastered it in ""The Matrix""."
3003;"The first time I watched this movie I was extremely impressed with those ""frozen"" scenes."
3004;The Lord of the rings is another one, too.
3005;"What I want to say is that, no matter how you see it, ""The Matrix"" has a very interesting plot, and scenes that always leave the viewers with their jaws hanging."
3006;And it has become one of the greatest references in movie.
3007;I rank this one up there as one to become a classic.
3008;I've seen this movie eight times and every single character, every line, every scene is part of an intensely complicated metaphor that incorporates elements from Christianity, Zen, Buddhism, the hacker subculture, the drug subculture, various martial arts, etc. those who dislike the Matrix, are probably also uninterested in those subjects.
3009;one must only venture onto the Matrix bulletin board, to witness the vast outpouring of analysis of this incredible motion picture.
3010;Even the acting (considering who they had) is quite good.
3011;This movie will always be in the film library of anyone whose a screen writer.
3012;But the construct of it is brilliant: What is reality, how do you define real .
3013;the acting is not very good, with Keanu Reeves delivering his usual disconnected performance.
3014;But it's still one of the best little mind f. s out there and so worth watching every three months or so.
3015;released in 1999 and written and directed by the Wachowski brothers this film takes the viewer into a dismal future for mankind in the year 2199.
3016;as dependent on machines, the internet and technology as we are .
3017;You decide, this movie is in my personal top three movies I have ever seen!
3018;I went to see this movie with very high expectations, and found it failed to live up to most of the hype.
3019;I always giggle when I read about the deep allegory of the film.
3020;He has all the charisma and acting talent of a piece of celery.
3021;I found myself laughing through most of his serious scenes.
3022;It'll be hard if any other movie gets special effects as good as this one.
3023;As usual great performances of Reaves and Fishburn
3024;All you have to do is look at the numerous 5 star reviews to know that this is one great movie to watch.
3025;its the best that Sci Fi has to offer.
3026;Third time I find more interesting details and realised that Matrix is one of the best action movies ever.
3027;There is also another world where machines live.
3028;The main character is Neo who will come to be a very important mission.
3029;You will truly be drawn in by the cinematography.
3030;The special effects are seamless.
3031;Inovation has always been a key factor in making a movie a classic film (especially in the sci.
3032;It draws you in and when it's all over, it leaves you buzzing.
3033;I saw this movie right when it came out, in a theater with a huge screen and dolby sound and all that, and I LOVED it.
3034;This movie remains a classic with its innovative filming to its imaginative storyline.
3035;A great cast of actors who were willing to try something new.
3036;The Matrix is undoubtedly one of the most innovative and enjoyable movies of this decade.
3037;world special effects and amazing sets and of course the splendid cast, the movie is easily enrolled into the sci.
3038;fi hall of fame with classics like Blade Runner and Terminator.
3039;The Matrix will be a model for future sci.
3040;All my friends and i went to see it the day it came out, and we were not disappointed.
3041;this movie is a must see.
3042;great original story, great special effects, great acting, great action.
3043;I Had to watch for a class.
3044;But it was pretty good.
3045;I hope the rest of the movies are as good.
3046;But while The Matrix lacks in uniqueness, it does have style and some very clever, very well done action sequences.
3047;If nothing else, the movie excels in its special effects and cinematography.
3048;Even the story is entertaining, if not very deep.
3049;I watch it time to time when I want my mind blown again!
3050;Anyhow great action movie otherwise.
3051;This movie was one of the few that I have seen that can balance science fiction, comics, hong kong action and anime films all at once.
3052;It grabbed you and held you as you went deeper into the world of the Matrix.Yeah, it may not be the best movie I have ever seen, but it is high on the list.
3053;Even if Keanu is not an Oscar calibur performer, he is still enjoyable to watch as Neo.
3054;It's a great popcorn flick with a little philosophy and a lot of style.
3055;The movie is outstanding, what else can be said about it!
3056;There is no doubt I enjoyed the amazing clarity of the video.
3057;She explained Amazon gets those discs from vendors like any of the stores.
3058;I bought it because this movie is a milestone for Hollywood production.
3059;As such, I have very high expectation on the time spent on viewing it again.
3060;This is the best action movie I've ever seen, actually the best movie I've ever seen.
3061;I've seen it 8 times, and will continue to see it!
3062;Super special effects, great sound.
3063;This movie is just perfect.
3064;I remember going to the movie to see this when it first came out.
3065;This is the thinking person's action thriller.
3066;A high degree of education and cultural literacy helps a great deal, as does an appreciation for action.
3067;"It's more fun than ""Dark Side of Oz."""
3068;The Trinity fight scene in the beginning is just a great start to a fantastic movie.
3069;the storyline is intriguing, though it's difficult to understand completely the first time.
3070;I've since seen the movie several times and finally understand it better.
3071;The visual effects are incredible, especially with the creation of bullet.
3072;This is probably one of the best sci.
3073;This movie is amazing in that the story, being so complex, is told in a way that makes you understand it.
3074;It takes a great movie to explain a story this deep.
3075;This movie is a great sci.
3076;fi movie I've seen that could possibly be one of the best movies I've seen!
3077;It has been compared to the great Star Wars and rightly so because the screenplay for this movie was written as only the second chapter of a trilogy.
3078;"Think of every genre there is
I:8405;3079;Moreover, this movie has revolutionalized movie making.
I:8405;3080;But the most compelling reason: If you want to fuss over and obsess about something truly wonderful that represents how advanced our culture is, WATCH THIS.
I:8405;3081;Amazing relevance to our life Is that air your breathing?
I:8405;3082;They are just a pretence in order to get the kids to see this movie.
I:8405;3083;It belongs to the bravest productions made in recent years along with 'They Live' by John Carpenter and 'Wag the Dog' by Barry Levinson.
I:8405;3084;this is by far, one of the most spectacular sci.
I:8405;3085;the effects were very well done, and there was actually a plot that kept my eyes glued to the screen!
I:8405;3086;although i'm not a big fan of Keanu Reeve's work, this is his best effort yet.
I:8405;3087;Fishburne and Moss were excellent.
I:8405;3088;The Matrix , for all its unique plot variations, is a simple tale of man wanting more than just this .
I:8405;3089;We'd much prefer to believe our lives are pre=programmed and are a grand illusion than to accept biological finiteness and responsibility for our actions.
I:8405;3090;Blame it on the machines we ourselves create .
I:8405;3091;gotta love it!A great movie with wonderous techno.
I:8405;3092;i give it five stars not because of its message, but because it is entertainment at its best.
I:8405;3093;This is the best movie so far and it would be hard to top.
I:8405;3094;the Matrix is a classic when it comes to Sci.
I:8405;3095;packed with interesting characters and plot, and if you like the movie as much as me you'll get the awesome soundtrack!!!
I:8405;3096;One of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8405;3097;This movie is smart, edgy, and has incredible special effects.
I:8405;3098;The actors all portray their characters wonderfully, especially the lady who plays Trinity.
I:8405;3099;She's tough, but you can still tell when she's hurt, insecure, or vulnerable.
I:8405;3100;It kept my attention with twists and turns the whole time.
I:8405;3101;All in all, I loved this movie and I gave it 5 stars.
I:8405;3102;This film has everything you need.
I:8405;3103;An excellent storyline written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, brilliant acting from Laurence Fishburne, Keanu Reaves and supporting cast, and enough action to keep you on the edge of your seats until the sequel comes out.
I:8405;3104;Very basically the film is about the matrix.
I:8405;3105;This film is done extremely well in every manner.
I:8405;3106;The way the film is shot gives you that almost dreamlike feeling when necessary, the action scenes are better than I have seen in any film before, the lobby scene especially.
I:8405;3107;The script very well put together, has an excellent soundtrack and has the humour all in the right places.
I:8405;3108;The best thing is just about all of it.
I:8405;3109;Special effects are awesome and just love the story line.
I:8405;3110;Because it is exciting and cool.
I:8405;3111;I'd like to recommend you this movie.
I:8405;3112;And the people who don't like the story line must enjoy the special effects ,I'm sure.
I:8405;3113;well, as the Matrix cna be the best movie that i ever seen .
I:8405;3114;i like many movies .
I:8405;3115;It is great not because it is action.
I:8405;3116;packed, but because it is very philosophical.
I:8405;3117;This movie has my unqualified recommendation.
I:8405;3118;It has some of the best action, stunts, and visuals I have ever seen.
I:8405;3119;The story is good also.
I:8405;3120;It has good acting by Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne's parts.
I:8405;3121;Well, the people who live, in their day in and day.
I:8405;3122;out world, believe it is real.
I:8405;3123;That software program that we believe is real, is called The Matrix.
I:8405;3124;Well, sometime in the early 21st century, mankind celebrated over their marvel, their creation.
I:8405;3125;A singular consciousness that spawned a whole new race, of machines.
I:8405;3126;The machines created a """"program"""" to control the people inside The Matrix."""
3127;When The Matrix was first built, there was a man born inside it, who had the ability change whatever he wanted, to remake The Matrix as he so fit.
3128;He was the one who set the first humans free to the real world.
3129;"So, Morpheus found Neo, who Morphues believes is ""The One""."
3130;The Matrix (1999) was a great five star sci.
3131;fi film experience with a great plot, good acting, great first time special effects and lots of action.
3132;Way out there but lots of fun.
3133;That is, the effects are fun but the people are of little concern, since they have no reality .
3134;Brilliant science fiction and a powerful extra chapter to Meditations on First Philosophy by Rene Descartes.
3135;The plot of this movie (without giving away any secrets) is so fresh original and new, yet at the same time it is confusing until it all comes together, which it does.
3136;But the Matrix is one of those mindblowing films that everyone has to see
3137;One of the greatest movies ever shown and I really get what it was and is all about it is a real classic.
3138;See this film for what it is, and think about the irony of millions of people enjoying it.
3139;The movie is incredible and holds up remarkably well today.
3140;This film is definitely on my Top Ten list.
3141;Not only is it entertaining in itself, but it is an outstanding example of the director's craft.
3142;I've seen the film at least half a dozen times, and I pick up something new each time.
3143;it's a gem on multiple levels.
3144;Well worth seeing at least once.
3145;The plot is fantastic, the action sequences some of the most impressive ever put on film.
3146;This film is a unique trip into another world of thinking.
3147;up information, super surround sound.
3148;This movie is special effects city .
3149;Great twists in this classic, dystopian sci.
3150;Fantastic action and plot, effects very slightly dated.
3151;Highly rec seeing this one if you haven't.
3152;One of the best movies of the past 20 years.
3153;Great action, amazing effects, and something to think about.
3154;I am surprised that the few scenes of over the top gun play where the good guys never get hit still plays with the young who seem to love this movie.
3155;'The Matrix' is the complete package: stunning, mind.
3156;bending special effects, perfect casting, brilliant directing, and a story that stands on its own.
3157;the visual effects are truly a marvel to view, and deservedly won an Oscar in this category.
3158;keanu Reeves is perfectly cast as Neo in this film.
3159;He does have a great physique which makes for a fantastic 'action.
3160;"Laurence Fishburne turns in a fine performance as the cryptic Morpheus
I:8405;3161;The real 'star' of the film, though, is Carrie.
I:8405;3162;ann Moss, who lights up the screen as Trinity.
I:8405;3163;Beautiful, smart and independent, she gives this film a soul and prevents it from crossing into a stereotypical sci.
I:8405;3164;Not only is a second viewing necessary, but it's enjoyable.
I:8405;3165;again, the special effects are magnificent and have to be seen to be believed.
I:8405;3166;It's definitely a film you shouldn't miss!
I:8405;3167;The movie is revolutionary in so many ways"
3168;moving Kung Fu, you can get that from The Matrix easy.
3169;but let's say you appreciate well.
3170;developed, finely engrained storylines with awesome depth.
3171;Well, The Matrix boasts one of the finest stories ever created.
3172;It mirrors the anxiety of the classic conspiracy theory movies, yet provides excellent tie.
3173;If they only knew what I know!
3174;The government is behind everything!
3175;the Matrix is philosophically DEEP, and the action is the best around, even nowadays.
3176;This movie is a classic, folks, and it was instantly so.
3177;It set the standard for action movies to come, and it will always be a great watch.
3178;tell her it is a love story.
3179;An interesting story is made all the better by some truly inventive action sequences and the great special effects (most notably the chopper crash and bullet.
3180;The Matrix is one of the most well known films of all time I think.
3181;It had groundbreaking special effects, good acting and an original story.
3182;ray transfers that don't quite get upgraded very well.
3183;The Matrix is an amazing Blu.
3184;Everything about this legendary movie is better now than ever before.
3185;How could a film hosting Keanu's brilliant acting abilitys steal some of 'The Phantom Menace's' thunder.
3186;I find now, when I watch it, I fast forward to all the action sequences cos lets face it.
3187;Everything else about the film on second watching is boring!On a whole, this film is a well.
3188;polished little gem that sneaked up unawares on the public just like in the story of 'The Tortoise and the Hare!'
3189;Its a rare movie that you can watch time and again without being bored.
3190;morpheous is captured,and Neo must engage Agent Smith in battle.
3191;The Matrix is one giant favorite scene.
3192;There are no low points, or slow points, it grabs you right away, and keeps you interested until the final scene.
3193;This film redefines movie making.
3194;The effects are so seamless you don't even realize they are there.
3195;The real star of the film is the dynamic multi level story.
3196;It is such a breath of fresh air to see an original idea in film for a change.
3197;the last half hour is GREAT.
3198;The next two Matrix's may be some of the best movies of the decade.
3199;A real wake up call for 21st century life.
3200;I found myself still talking about this movie a month after I saw it.
3201;And I saw kids in the movie theatre!
3202;this is a very cool movie, fun to watch and i love keanu reeves.
3203;but dispite all this the special effects are the best i've ever seen and the matrix remains on my amazon.
3204;The Wachowski brothers have delivered an exciting movie, though not completely new .
3205;"but knowntheless, good plot and ""what is the real?"""
3206;"and ""Good vs Evil"" theme."
3207;It is amazing, with so much going on, that they are able to deliver, partly because of innovative filming, a concise and interesting movie.
3208;"In one instance, he is a messaih figure, more like ""King David"" than Christ, and in other instances, he is a superhero with extreme power."
3209;"fishburne is perfect as Morpheous, the mentor and ""minor prophet."""
3210;Carrie Ann Moss, is compelling as Trinity, a high.
3211;One Amazon reviewer didn't like the martial arts scenes, but these mostly Kung Fu scenes are a perfect fit for this type of film.
3212;Sure it isn't Bruce Lee, but for a bunch of actors, it is very well done.
3213;the villians, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano are extremely good in their respective parts.
3214;All in all, a masterful film from two young filmakers.
3215;The special effects were amazing.
3216;I loved the story, the clothes, the music, the colors.
3217;Every time I watch this movie, I learn something new about it.
3218;With breathtaking fight choreagraphies and eye.
3219;budget HongKong martial arts movie combined it with the coolest computer generated special effects and outstanding cinematography and made it into a movie on which every other martial.
3220;This is one of the first R. rated films I think I ever watched.
3221;What is important is the film: it is amazing, incredible, unique, beautiful, adventurous, risky, deep, and everything else that makes a movie great.
3222;The story is so original, the writing so impressive, the characters so real, the themes so deep.
3223;Everyone should at least watch this film once, just to appreciate what the Wachowskis have done.
3224;Fantastic Movie with a clever plot.
3225;The special effects are excellent and the acting is also fantastic.
3226;It has a great plot and a astonishing storyline.
3227;time, the special effects is just great.
3228;It is worth every penny
3229;Matrix is a clever science fiction story that triggers reflection in regards to our existence and values, which can be experienced through fast paced action packed entertainment.
3230;provoking, innovative film that causes its audience to question what is truly real around them.
3231;This film was very well done, with amazing special effects.
3232;A real thriller and must.
3233;The Matrix is the best movie I have seen in a long time.
3234;The sound and technology involved in this movie are beyond words, and the acting is the best I have seen in years.
3235;I definite must see, then see again.
3236;The special effects are incredible .
3237;this is one of his best work, since speed.
3238;The special effects were awesome, the fight sequences were my personal favs and if you have not seen it, this is one you really have got to see to believe.
3239;As far as office movies go, this one is ok.
3240;It's no Office Space or Nine to Five, but the office scenes are provocative and full of biting satire.
3241;The Matrix one of those movies that just has something special about it.
3242;This is probably one of my favorite series of movies.You follow a character named Neo.
3243;Neo has lived a fairly normal life as a hacker.
3244;Neo eventually meets Morpheous and a group of people.
3245;he turns out to be in the Real World, and the world he used to be in was the computer program called The Matrix.
3246;the movie has a real Alice in Wonderland feel to it.
3247;The story takes awhile to get going, but once it gets going it is great.
3248;pounding action, great story telling, and insane camera work.
3249;These are all good to watch.
3250;This is by far the greatest special effects, mind boggling movie of all time!
3251;Superbly acted and edited, I completely understand why it won a few Academy Awards, but I can't remember how many or what for.
3252;One of the best movies i ever had the plesure to watch.
3253;really new effects, great sound, rich story.
3254;Everything is done so well.
3255;I like this movie and it has some humor and violence and it is pretty good.
3256;The story line is captivating, you get a nagging what if this was true in your head.
3257;The special effects on The Matrix are state of the art and extremely impressive!
3258;Worse enough, I can also say that while the idea is interesting.
3259;Because I'll have a LOT.
3260;eaten ham and cheese sandwich, right now.)
3261;This movie, it's all just really one.
3262;I absolutly LOVED this movie!
3263;The special effects, the sounds, and ESPECIALLY the plot are the best I've ever seen.
3264;This movie is very exciting and the special effects are great!
3265;This movie is the best movie I have ever seen.
3266;It is a blast of martial art fun, and yet great superhuman moves.
3267;see movie and I highly recommend you get the soundtrack!
3268;I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out, and was surprised when I found I enjoyed it.
3269;it leaves the viewer to do a lot of philosophical insight.
3270;Seen it in 1999 when it first debuted on the big screen.
3271;Incredibly stylized, designed, almost perfect pacing, witty and yet simple symbolic dialogue.
3272;after the first viewing I'd give it a perfect score.
3273;After subsequent viewings you feel that the action sequences really hold back some of the intellectual potential of this film.
3274;however, the original ideas presented and the way in which they are presented is very very nice.
3275;Their technical intelligence is much greater than humans' so why not just build fusion reactors?It would be much more believable if the reason were that machines were conducting an experiment, investigation of human behavior, studying their creators in order to answer questions about their own existence.
3276;"5 stars[as strange as it may sound I actually thought at the beginning that Morpheus and the rest are the bad guys and agents are good, with the whole ""."
3277;It was totally great, the best action movie in a while.
3278;It really sort of makes you wonder is it possible for it to be true?
3279;I encourage everyone who has not seen the movie to do so asap.
3280;You will love it, like I do.
3281;Fast action combined with mind challenging logics.
3282;Advanced effects and animations with hi.
3283;Acting was pretty good as well, even for some unheard of actors in the suppoting roles.
3284;for those of us who appreciate the genre, The Matrix has a creative premise supported by well known sci.
3285;The entertainment of this movie comes from the intriguing and deep thought involved in the story.
3286;apocalyptic world ruled by artificially intelligent machines, the film finds itself worlds away from admittedly second.
3287;What the Wachowski brothers have done is so imaginative that no film has ever come close to its intricacies and futuristic ideas.
3288;Add hints and nudges from Vertigo, classic Western films and Kung.
3289;fu karate films into the story and the amazing journey is made even more fascinating and involving.
3290;"the visuals incorporated throughout the story are absolutely amazing
I:8405;3291;bending lines like: """"It's the smell, if there is such a thing"""""
3292;Regardless, it's a great film, loaded to the retinas with out.
3293;world effects, great villians (Agent Smith!)
3294;pieces and awesome stunts from martial arts expert Wu Ping.
3295;The Matrix Reloaded, the Matrix is a film that not only has affected filmgoers everywhere, but has also leaked into the fan boy culture of the movie world.
3296;I will most definitely use this seller again.
3297;There was just enough confusion to keep me guessing and just enough to make the realization an even bigger OOOOOH!I recommend this to sci.
3298;I won't tell you how many times I've watched it, but let me tell you, it's worth it.
3299;up pure fantasy for adults.
3300;The action scenes are awesome and the special effects are just mind.
3301;Keanu Reeves looks great and Laurence Fishburne owned Morpheus.
3302;"Striking, incredible creation of very young directors, but Orson Welles was also very young when he wrote and directed ""Citizen Kane""."
3303;When was it decided that a movie could not be good because it was simply an entertaining thrill ride.
3304;this movie is the most entertaining and visually intense movie I have seen in ages.
3305;It had an intriguing story idea and incredible imagery.
3306;The lobby gunfight alone makes this movie worth well more than the price of admission.
3307;"It's the best movie yet that prompts people to open up their minds and start questioning whats really around them, metaphorically speaking of course.
I:8405;3308;It's a very interesting story with great effects and photography.
I:8405;3309;I'd also recommend picking up the soundtrack.
I:8405;3310;it's one of the best!
I:8405;3311;The Matrix is simply one of the most visually stunning and intellectually enthralling Science Fiction/Action Adventure films to be produced in recent history.
I:8405;3312;It is the quintessential film of the nineties and now the new millennium.
I:8405;3313;i've never been much of a Keanu Reeves fan but that opinion definitely changed with this movie and I'm sure will continue with its follow on movies """"The Matrix Reloaded"""" and """"The Matrix Revolutions."""""""
3314;He is absolutely perfect in the role.
3315;Laurence Fishburne in the role of Morpheus is outstanding as usual, making it seem as if the role was made for him.
3316;In the role of Trinity is the ever so beautiful Carrie.
3317;anne Moss whose hard work and stunning gorgeousness shines brilliantly on the silver screen and the home theater screen.
3318;Joe Pantoliano delivers another great performance in the role of good guy turned bad.
3319;combining a brilliant story and superb directing by the Wachowski brothers with superb performances by the aforementioned actors brings forth what is most likely one of the best Science Fiction/Action Adventure flicks of the nineties and the catalyst for this years release of the sequels which are both expected to reach astronomical levels at the box office.
3320;What follows from there is as stated above, one of the most compellingly well written Science Fiction/Action Adventure flicks to grace the silver screen and the home theater in quite some time.
3321;"This is a movie that can be watched repeatedly and it's just as exciting as the first time you watched it!I ""highly"" recommend this film to all who are interested in a ""great"" movie that is unbelievable in its scope and detail and perfect even in its minor trivialities."
3322;Simply the best movie this year.
3323;But this movie is simple a masterpiece.
3324;Dazzling special effects, an addictive storyline.
3325;I just want to see it over and over again!
3326;I've watched this movie probably 250 times by the time I'm now writing this, and every time I see it again I still find it to be one of the very best science fiction movies I've ever seen.
3327;and by the end I was wanting to see it again and actually liking Keanu Reeves as an actor.
3328;the Matrix is definitely a package deal .
3329;I thought the special effects of this movie was outstanding.
3330;written, mindblowing, and very original.
3331;I think this movie is definitely one of Keanu's best movies, and it will probably go down as one of the best movies of all time.
3332;I really loved the fight scenes because Trinity and Neo both rock the screen.
3333;I think this is a really good movie and you should see it.
3334;also Recommended: I also enjoyed the Matrix Reloaded and the Matrix Revolutions
3335;The sound is amazing, and the video is great.
3336;frame after seeing all those Kung.
3337;Best money I ever spent!
3338;the movie is the best thing i have ever seen in my entire career of viewing science fiction films.
3339;not only are the special effects and action great, the plot is absolutely fantastic.
3340;how often to you find a great action movie with a good plot?
3341;its the ultimatum of cool.
3342;its higher resolution than VHS and it makes everything a lot cooler.
3343;plus i got a kick out of tha special features!
3344;I'm surprised, because he worked out so well in SCHOOL DAZE and APOCALYPSE NOW.
3345;Wow, we are really in an faux.
3346;"Better roll out some special effects to put a hurtin' to these roving mongoloid footballs."""
3347;That would have been worth the eight bucks.
3348;I offer the darkly brilliant DARK CITY.
3349;This thing is about as sophisticated as a Broadway musical.
3350;Better call Deputy Van Halen in to save the day!
3351;good luck boys, I'm sure the series will be a hit.
3352;First of all this is my all time favorite movie.
3353;It is so clear that you can see the pores on the faces of all the actors.
3354;"This sounds like a ""yuk"" thing, but, believe me, if the pores are so outstanding everything else is even more amazing."
3355;I must mention, however, the one reason I gave this picture 2 stars instead of one: Hugo Weaver is brilliant as Agent Smith!
3356;ray disc and book are a great product.
3357;It is simple enough and nice to have since I loved the movie anyway.
3358;For all the special effects, this disc captures it all.
3359;It's is perfect wich is something you rarely see.
3360;not as good as Animatrix, Akira or Spawn but it's still perfect.
3361;If you liked any of the movies I sayed earlyer you'll love this.
3362;The Matrix is one of the coolest movies ever made and one of my favorite films of all time.
3363;Near the end of the film it has the greatest action and special effects sequence that I have ever seen in my life(The Shootout and Helicopter scene).
3364;The visuals in this film are breathtaking and so totally freakin' awesome.
3365;powerful machines of artificial intelligence.
3366;graphics are excellent (not overdone).
3367;the movie is worth seeing.
3368;This movie was the best!
3369;packed and the female character wasn't a helpless wimp.
3370;It is probably the best movie of 1999 (perhaps exceeded only by Star Wars).
3371;Of course, it will be one of the ultimate classics of the 90's.
3372;Nevertheless, I love the picture and plan to see it at least ten times within three years.
3373;This movie is fun, fun, fun with an originality that opened a whole lot of new doors.
3374;The music is supercharged, and I would have to say that this is the most REwatchable movie of 1999!
3375;see, but it is a must.
3376;The film brings to the screen the story of Neo, a young man, who finds himself in the middle of a war between humans and machines.
3377;the Matrix is a highly entertaining, action.
3378;packed adventure with significant elements of science fiction.
3379;All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!
3380;Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt one that can be watched over and over again.
3381;simply put, this movie has made History!
3382;The Matrix is guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment.
3383;In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.
3384;This is a profound movie that I watched again last night because my wife hadn't seen it yet.
3385;it struck me as ironic that the way Neo was able to survive and eventually triumph over The Matrix was by learning rules, lots of them.
3386;He also had to practice and perfect the programming that was downloaded into him.
3387;fi, but I loved it.
3388;It's the type of movie that grabs your attention to the end, but still gives you a story that boggles your mind.
3389;The Matrix was one of the best movies I have ever seen.
3390;It makes you open up your mind and think about reality and what lies beyond.
3391;It makes you wonder if the world is really what you see it as, or maybe like the movie suggests this world is a cover.
3392;The special effects of the movie were beyond amazing.
3393;The way the characters moved, the technology they used, everything in the movie made it more believable.
3394;I recommend seeing this movie if you have an open mind.
3395;Interesting story about CGI technology though.
3396;The usage of CGI is clever, creating a hyper.
3397;When I first watched this film with a friend, we were knocked out by it and we were already discussing it right in the middle of the film.
3398;When I saw this movie for the first time I was shocked.
3399;I have seen this film in the cinema for three times and then I bought a cassete and watched it at least 10 times before I got satisfied just a little and could think about anything else accept this film.
3400;It's ideas are just great and the film is worth watching it for several times.
3401;I hope you will like it the way I do it now.
3402;I was psyched for an intelligent VR themed movie.
3403;"conceived filmIf Bill Gates had been the star, it would have made it 2000% more exciting (and that is a sad commentary)Not surprisingly, most of the ""positive"" reviews have to do with the EFX."
3404;It is a visually stunning movie with amazing special effects so the perfect movie for this format.
3405;rOM player as well to enjoy half of it.
3406;It was always one of my favorites.
3407;I take my Kindle fire everywhere, so purchasing the movie was a given.
3408;The actors all do a spectacular job, and it seems like everyone and their uncle have seen this movie.
3409;It really is a classic.
3410;I can never keep my eyes open for it.
3411;Seriously though, digital version is worth it.
3412;I have to admit, though, the special effects blew me away from beginning to end, and the plot was surprisingly good too.
3413;I highly recommend this film for everyone, not just for sci.
3414;I found that my friends who work in the Information Technology industry (like me) LOVE the movie and saw it countless times.
3415;The musical score is fantastic and the scene in Governor Macquarie Tower (for all you Sydneysiders) was THE best action scene I think I've ever seen.
3416;I loved seeing the various Sydney spots where they filmed and the martial arts scenes were awesome.
3417;Very well acted and the special effects blew me away!
3418;fi to a new generation.
3419;Keanu Reeves is Neo, who leads a cast of characters with equally cool names on a quest to set people free from the Matrix, a virtual reality that is: our reality.
3420;This Matrix is set up by machines to keep humans happy while we are used as fuel cells for the vast world of the Machines.
3421;this is a movie to watch over and over, as there is such an original and thought.
3422;What makes this movie so unusual is that is is both highly intellectual and action.
3423;making, as well as culture, have moved up a notch.
3424;This movie really got on my last nerve.
3425;I watched it all because my friend thought it was great.
3426;Spectacular picture and magnific package.
3427;So many spiritual connotations throughout the script, which makes the movie so wonderful.
3428;This is a very fun little movie.
3429;Even after almost 15 years, the fight scenes still hold up pretty well.
3430;All the other actors are pretty good, and the agents are a highlight.
3431;Sometimes all you need is a stupidly fun movie.
3432;You'd think THE MATRIX was a very special movie indeed based on all the extremely positive comments preceding this one.
3433;I must admit that it is quite entertaining and has no boring moments.
3434;It features some great special effects and is visually exciting.
3435;A motion picture that tackles this very same question in a much more fascinating manner is 1998's highly underrated DARK CITY.
3436;But this movie's lasting power (like last months number one pop hit) won't be long term.
3437;yes, great or meaningful .
3438;This movie is crazy, astounding, perfect, superboosted as perfectly balanced.
3439;anne Moss is an awesome kind of Trinity.
3440;To be brief, the Matrix is, at best, an OK action film with intellectual pretentions that come off sort of goofy.
3441;Still, it is alot of fun to look at (until you realize the whole thing looks like a Playstation version of a Gap commercial).
3442;The real star (human wise) is the character of Trinity who is absolutely stunning to look at and has some of the best martial arts moves.
3443;dystopic fun, see the film.
3444;More that just great special effects and a lead actor obviously born for the part this is a very Important film.
3445;Much has been said but think of it as a satire on the government, the importance of self, and the acceptence of reality this is a very meaningful film.
3446;This movie has great fight scenes like the one in the lobby with all the guns n sh.
3447;The whole movie is great and I'm glad when Mouse and them others die cause they are annoying.
3448;the action is fantstatic and the whole movie is great.
3449;watch for a good movie
3450;It is a very popular movie among young as they encounter the riddles, myths, and quest of finding truth and the meaning of life.
3451;He sees a rabbit tattoo on a girl's arm and follows them to a party.
3452;Morpheus sees Neo as special, the one he has been seeking, and shows him the truth about the world.
3453;imagination and special effects define the movie.
3454;anne Moss is a thrilling Trinity.
3455;"The Matrix morphs into surreal science fiction and then hits ""earth"" again with surprises big and small."
3456;It is a fantastic mind controlled escape movie, and the special effects define it.
3457;The greatest thing about this movie is that even those who hated it wanna say something about it!!
3458;This movie would be the best i have viewed in my life so far.
3459;The movie has proven to be a popular one throughout a wide veiwing audience.
3460;It has a great story line with great actors to back it up.
3461;I would definitely reccommend this to a friend.
3462;Enter the Wachowski Brothers, two talented filmmakers with a love for cyberpunk and kung.
3463;They got cyberpunk veteran Keanu Reeves as their main character and found a terrific supporting cast in Joe Pantoliano, Lawrence Fishburne, Cary.
3464;Their story was a simple good.
3465;The Wachowskis combined stylized visuals with wild kung.
3466;day classic that has since spawned a new era in filmmaking where computers are as important as the camera.
3467;"But ""The Matrix"" was more than just a revolutionary and visionary film, it was also a heckuva movie experience!"
3468;Not only was the film a new step for moviemaking, it was also an incredibly good movie!
3469;The film recieved awards for its special.
3470;effects, but little was said about its plot or characters, something that is at the heart of this film.
3471;The Matrix is an excellent film and rates as one of the best in the past five years.
3472;or did you ever wonder.
3473;If so, you're in for an thought.
3474;Visual effects are stunning .
3475;Keanu Reeves is a great action hero .
3476;a strong, beautiful and very human woman .
3477;Mr. Smith is memorable as a program with an attitude!
3478;The rest of the cast help bring it all together to .
3479;The Matrix is a fabulous movie.
3480;This movie is about the spiritual world vs. the physical world.
3481;If you are a biblical person it's a must see.
3482;If your not a biblical person you will STILL get the message and entertainment of the movie.
3483;The movie itself is a wonderful meshing of popular culture and religious themes, the acting is superb, and the action is thrilling.
3484;the matrix is one of a small class of films that successfully tells a story on many levels simultaniously.
3485;Fight Club is another movie that pulls this off brilliantly.
3486;The characters are enigmatic and larger.
3487;Once the secret is revealed (what the matrix is and it's implications), the previously enigmatic characters are developed more fully, and the main character (Neo) begins to grow and change.
3488;But watch it several times before making up your mind, so you can fully appreciate all of the layers and aspects of the story.
3489;The special effects were great, probably the best ever.
3490;The story is pretty interesting.
3491;The effects, the acting, and the storyline were more than exceptional.
3492;Stunning special effects edited seamlessly with an edgy soundtrack, edge.
3493;seat action scenes, and a sci.
3494;fi plot that intrigues and catches you off.
3495;This is the movie that I always tell people to pop in to show their new sound systems, the sound and picture are out of this world, especially on an 110 inch projection screen in blu ray with 7.1 surround sound.
3496;Every bullet casing that hits the ground and every fist that impacts flesh, bare or otherwise, sounds perfect.
3497;Best thing about this movie is an idea of story.
3498;Some unique camera shots made this movie famous.
3499;This movie's soooo good .
3500;I was realy excited about the Matrix and for the most part it lived up to my expectations.
3501;It has an interesting plot, great special effects, and some incredible action sequences.
3502;Laurence Fishburne does an excellent job as Morpheus and helps set the tone for the entire film.
3503;Keuno Reeves does a decent job as do villians of the film.
3504;She is ment to be a strong female lead but ends up just being boring.
3505;the story is very interesting but it has a one small problem to it.
3506;I wrote on this movie for the written communications class, (funny enough) I was looking at the biblical contexts and meanings as well the philosophical contents.
3507;I enjoy all of the Matrixes' movies looking for more!!
3508;Now let's take time out to praise the genius of The Matrix.
3509;This movie must be the best movie ever made because when people shoot guns, the bullets can go in slow motion and leave TRAILS (*gasping*).
3510;This movie has to be a treat for all those 'intellectuals' out there, who think sub.
3511;These are all the makings of an American classic, if you ask me.
3512;if you need something to open up the neural floodgates, go with Fight Club, a movie that's truly original and loaded with ideas and doesn't hide behind smoke and mirrors to pass itself off as an intelligent film.
3513;This has become in my mind a sci.
3514;The way in which they were integrated into a the story was just perfect.
3515;The perfect combination for a classic: compelling, universal and not.
3516;This is the most visually stunning and original movie I have seen in a long time easily the Best Movie I Have Seen This Year!!!
3517;effects, Great characters, Mind Blowing Action and Kung.
3518;I believe this movie is a landmark a pioneering film that will be looked back upon as the movie that started a whole new style of imaginative filmmaking.
3519;The story line of this movie is great and very original.
3520;For great entertainment I recommend The Matrix.
3521;I give this flick the ultimate stamp of approval by saying it does more for movies than any other that was released in the 90's.
3522;Any movie that can make Keeanu Reeves look that good at martial arts has got to be good.
3523;This movie will really make you think about the nature of the world in which we live.
3524;Not only is it entertaining, but I believe it suggests some real fundamental truths about what we perceive as 'reality'.
3525;Visually dazzling cyber adventure, full of kinetic excitement, but it retreats to formula just when it's getting interesting.
3526;fi fan you will love this movie.
3527;All this is well designed and put in a great menue.
3528;the complex shots and thrilling action sequences make this one of my favorite movies.
3529;the good: The matrix is entertaing with a good story and superb acting.
3530;i give it an overall of four.
3531;Is saw this movie in theatre 4 times, just because it's one of the greatest SFX.
3532;An instant classic for it's good story and starring actors.
3533;and still enjoy it each time.
3534;The Matrix is imple THE BEST!
3535;If you enjoy action and magic, you'd love the movie.
3536;This is Keanu's best action movie.
3537;I highly recommended ,see it you won't regret it.
3538;If I had to give The Matrix a rating it would be the best possible.
3539;i watched The Matrix a few days ago and the story line was so fascinating it has been on my mind ever sence.
3540;there is something I can't explain about the movie The Matrix that is mind boggling.
3541;OK I thought, good action, breathtaking effects and nicely coreographed fighting.
3542;I've seen it more times than I can count and everytime I watch it something new appears.
3543;The Wachowski brothers have obviously put a lot of work into this one.
3544;"The Matrix is that kind of movie that can make everyone satisfied as it has so much to offer
I:8405;3545;Simply put, this is the best film I've ever seen and it will probably stay in that position for years.
I:8405;3546;You might be confused watching it the first time but I can assure you that you will watch it over and over again.
I:8405;3547;One of the best movies in 1999.
I:8405;3548;the best kung fu stunts that i have ever seen and the special effects were spot on,especially the helicopter sequences etc.
I:8405;3549;, Kung fu, lots of guns, sci fi and most important"
3550;The acting was fine, especialy Carrie Ann Moss, her character trinity is the ultimate female action hero, very tough but very sensible too.
3551;The production design and the special effects are terrific!!
3552;This movie is far better than Episode 1.
3553;I can only compare it with the first Star Wars Movie.
3554;I think he's a good actor.
3555;Laurence Fishburne deserves an Oscar nod for his performance.
3556;Nevertheless, I enjoyed it found it fun.
3557;Movie was a great price and came within a timely maner.
3558;An intresting view of what could come!
3559;this is the second Greatest Science Fiction movie I have ever seen, the best being _Blade Runner_.
3560;aNy Movie that can make Keanu Reeves look like a major asset as an actor is just a perfect example of what a great director , an awesome story and an excellent supporting Cast can do.
3561;and the villians make you feel like our hero's could actually lose, which is a nice change of pace from so many recent Sci.
3562;rom drive you have some neat additional features as well.
3563;The ONE, the ONLY story retold, in a visually stunning format.
3564;god in the act of becoming.
3565;Actors that hit the mark and the mood.
3566;A beautifully crafted gem of a movie.
3567;Still, my favorite movie of all time.
3568;For 1999, the special effects are amazing.
3569;The spiritual parallels are profound.
3570;And lots of great action to boot!
3571;Then follow the white rabbit and probably the most ingenious thing is to watch the movie with only the sound track.
3572;"and WHV sitting on a nice RM for a few years I thought ""Aha!"
3573;I didnt want the whole box.
3574;and now you can bet that will drop with the economy.
3575;they ONLY count you as UE if you are COLLECTING UC.
3576;To the awesome score and special effects the Matrix delivers.
3577;Kick back and enjoy a cool high tech thriller.
3578;This 1999 movie, the Matrix, would be in the top two of my favorite movies.
3579;The special effects were great for example a time when Neo, the main character is shot by 5 bullets.
3580;He sticks out a hand and the bullets drop.
3581;The actors and actresses were also great.
3582;Its hard to imagine The Matrix II will be better than the Matrix I.
3583;You really start to believe in your dreams like they our real.
3584;I truely believe it was right to have the R rating.
3585;He loved the effects but did not understand the plot at all.
3586;The ages for this movie I would say is mature 8 year olds and up.
3587;There Are Like A Lotta Great Scenes In The Movie.
3588;This has to be the best movie I have seen Yet.
3589;who single handedly steals every one they share together.
3590;the Matrix is slick, and it does have its moments, but the story leaves a great deal to be desired.
3591;the Phantom Menace, The Matrix, and The Mummy, The Mummy is the best pick of the bunch.
3592;This movie has great special effects and a great plot and great music and great acting.
3593;The video has a 26 minute behind the scenes look at it, too.
3594;Everything in this movie was good.
3595;a B movie with ingenious special effects.
3596;edward Muybridge must be smiling to himself up there!
3597;The matrix is my favorite movie of all time, but I'm not here to review the movie itself.
3598;It's a sci fi, with awesome special effects, awesome martial arts, cool characters, and the most BRILLIANT story of all time!
3599;Sound Effects and cinematography is unparalled.
3600;This truly is a film that you will watch over and over again
3601;ive always liked this movie because it makes you think.
3602;also the acting and the stunts keep your attention.
3603;and a few images of some very cool action.
3604;I love video games, I like kung fu, I like science fiction, I like comic books, and I like technology.
3605;The one overwhelming mantra of The Matrix is that the Wachowski brothers use everything, pop culture, religion, video games, you name it and blend it all together to make something new.
3606;I loved the story, the action, the cinematography, even the acting.
3607;fishburne and Joey Pants are great character actors and I tend to love their work regardless of the film their in.
3608;Keanu more than fits the bill.
3609;the story was good, but the storytelling was the hallmark for me.
3610;For many people the cinematography was all new to them.
3611;In comic books, the method of storytelling is done through still images.
3612;If anything it gives you a wide latitude with perspective.
3613;For example, one trick that anime uses is to take a still image and have the camera move from left to right.
3614;the Wachowskis came from a comic book background, and one of the things that they were trying to do was bring some of the storytelling style from comic books and anime to the silver screen.
3615;Motion pictures, comic books and animation are all simply mediums to tell a story.
3616;The Wachowski brothers blended the styles and blurred the lines between the mediums.
3617;It would be four years before their story could continue, but it was all worth the wait.
3618;The Matrix is one of the few movies that I enjoy watching over and over.
3619;Each time I view it, I discover something new in the story or scenes.
3620;It has a rare and interesting plot, and it appeals to the imagination, emotions and intellect.
3621;everything, the theme of the movie is a relevant piece of work.
3622;fi movie, it has to go beyond what we normally regard as realistic , and The Matrix certainly stretches way beyond those boundaries.
3623;this is also one movie which is even the more interesting and mind.
3624;All in all, it is a great movie with a good cast, cool, stylish stunts and special effects.
3625;This is just simply one of the best movies of all time.
3626;but I will tell you that this movie has sure won over me and my love and obsession for it.
3627;Free your mind and you might have the PRIVILEGE to enjoy The Matrix as the great movie that it is.
3628;=)(I would just like to say 'Great job!'
3629;Would love the ability to alter the rules of our reality and just have fun.
3630;This is an awesome movie.
3631;The special effets are incredible.
3632;The storyline was original and inventive.
3633;The actors did an excellent job.
3634;The Matrix is a stunning sci.
3635;fi thriller from the remarkable Wachowski brothers, who CO. wrote and CO. directed it.
3636;With just a couple of small independent films under their belts, the Wachowskis were somehow able to propel themselves into the front line of big budget film making.
3637;By day he is an employee at a powerful software company.
3638;One night he is lead to a disco where he meets a strange and beautiful girl called Trinity.
3639;She is also a hacker and can arrange for him to meet Morpheus.
3640;in another irony, I have never seen a film that integrates computer graphics and effects into the story as well as The Matrix does.
3641;Its theme and tone are much like another sci.
3642;despite all it technical wizardry, The Matrix's driving force is its riveting thriller of a story.
3643;Glorious special effects, for once, enhance the memorable characters.
3644;keanu Reeves is excellent as Neo.
3645;Like the late Cary Grant, Reeves is more star and personality than actor.
3646;Grant played Grant better than anyone else, and only Reeves can play Reeves.
3647;Laurence Fishburne gives his usual strong yet thoughtful performance in the role of Morpheus.
3648;Still, most of the big events play reasonable well when shrunk down, and the story itself is perhaps a bit enhanced on video.
3649;both a thrill ride and a thought provoking look at mankind's tenuous relationship with reality, The Matrix is unlike any movie you are likely to see this year.
3650;fi thriller this much since Alien, Aliens and Blade Runner in the early 1980s.
3651;I think that The Matrix is one of the best movies ever.
3652;It has some technical errors (involving the guns and plot) but it still good.
3653;The Matrix was an awesome movie when it was released.
3654;Although the visual effects may be a bit dated, I still think that is an awesome movie to this day.
3655;It provides a nice blend of action, story, cinematography, and special effects.
3656;ray does the movie justice making this the definitive way to watch it, until a more advanced medium is released.
3657;I see new things every viewing.
3658;The commentary track is fascinating but what really surprised me is the music score.
3659;This is a fun sci.
3660;But, if what you want to watch is a fun, silly, but kind of cool movie then watch this.
3661;first off, it's a great flick: a live.
3662;action comic book (which you'll comprehend once you view the behind the scenes extras .
3663;the storyboards for this film were done by talented comic artists.
3664;"I recently watched it on one of those excellent plasma screens and realized for the first time that all of the scenes that take place in the ""matrix"" have a green tint to them ."
3665;the story continues to enthrall me every time I watch it.
3666;The Wachowski brothers are great story tellers and THE MATRIX is a great story.
3667;and Hugo Weaving's performance as Agent Smith is hilarious and nuanced at the same time.
3668;"The feature on ""Bullet Time"" is fascinating."
3669;It will be interesting to see what the future holds for this film series.
3670;As you watch films like The Matrix you can begin to see many thematic elements hatched from previous stories.
3671;"Alice in Wonderland is referred to directly in the movie as ""Neo"", the character played by Keanu Reeves is led into a new, world that is unknown to him."
3672;The story in The Matrix is actually tied closer to an ancient piece of philosophical literature.
3673;"The Allegory of the Cave by Plato is a perfect match with the design for the ""Matrix."""
3674;The basis of The Allegory of the Cave is that man inside the cave believes all that he sees inside the cave is real.
3675;"In the ""Matrix"" the people live out their normal lives thinking everything is real that they see."
3676;The Matrix seems basically to be a modernized version of this classic piece of philosophical genius.
3677;The cave is more detailed and modernized in this wonderful piece of Sci.
3678;The Wakowski Brothers have ingeniously taken this wonderful philosophical story and rejuvenated it.
3679;"the audience begins to see evidence of the ""Matrix's"" unreality, as the movie uses visual and audible clues that give the knowledge that the world ""Neo"" lives in is in fact falsely generated."
3680;Things are depicted in slow motion to the viewer to symbolize that they are moving with incredible quickness.
3681;All that is needed is the open mind and knowledge that the impossible is possible.
3682;"This is because the ""Matrix"" stimulates your mind to make you believe everything is real."
3683;"This argument was made by the famous philosopher Descartes, who believes that a person is made up of two separate parts
I:8405;3684;i highly recommend watching The Matrix as it not only dazzles the mind with its special effects, but it expands ones mind with new enlightened thoughts.
I:8405;3685;The acting is amazingly surprising as Keanu Reeves gives his best performance in this milestone of philosophical theater art.
I:8405;3686;The Matrix is a great story that can kind of relate to our unreal lives today with a certain degree of irony that makes you think.
I:8405;3687;This move should go down as one of the best science fiction movies of the decade!
I:8405;3688;It has a great storie, GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS!!
I:8405;3689;This movie will be an instant classic and i can't wait until the next two come out!
I:8405;3690;The sound effects were great and crystal clear and the extras are the best I have seen.
I:8405;3691;The viewer has the option of watching the movie as normal, except when a white rabbit icon appears, you can click it and see the special effects scene being created.
I:8405;3692;The stunts, effects and action are fresh for a high budget movie.
I:8405;3693;I bought this movie a while ago after hearing raves about it.
I:8405;3694;we will find more and more such movies being favorably reviewed and possibly even win Oscars !
I:8405;3695;The movie has great surround and special effects.
I:8405;3696;Want to watch a good movie with awesome special effects ?
I:8405;3697;Another good one for sound and video Super Speedway .
I:8405;3698;I first saw this movie at camp, and when it ended, I was hooked.
I:8405;3699;The Matrix is a movie of dazzling special effects and equally high concepts.
I:8405;3700;Unlike many recent action movies it delves deep into themes of truth and illusion, meaning and power, good and evil and much more rather than skimming across their surface.
I:8405;3701;strip away the high tech background and you find that this is a very old story, complete with miraculous deeds and healings, sacrificial love, and even resurrection.
I:8405;3702;it works well as escapist action fare, but Matrix is actually much more.
I:8405;3703;Every scene is filled with hidden meanings, and the conclusion is a triumph.
I:8405;3704;It is well worth watching and think about!

3706;When you see the sequel, you'll realize what he means.
3707;"Reloaded is good cause we get new ideas that ""The Matrix"" didn't give us, and that is why I would of given this film 3 out of 4 stars."
3708;Bear in mind this review was written by a 12 year old in a good mood:All I have to say is.
3709;The story line is right on time!
3710;It is the best action movie of the 1990's!
3711;Also it is a new plan of film making, the way the brought animation to real life!
3712;Funky film, good acting, fun story, the Internet was still fairly young back then so the story was unique and brought in a whole new idea of the Internet and virtual reality and computers.
3713;the acting is a little slow except for Fishburne,but the script and graphics make this an excellent movie.
3714;This is a movie full of action, drama, and totally rocking effects.
3715;Well, the film is great, if very much about the talk rather than the action.
3716;After the Matrix, Reloaded and Revolutions had a lot to live up to, and got absolutely slated in the press.
3717;disc set, with a lot of extras.
3718;there's a lot of hard work put into the filming of the Matrix, as you can see just by watching it.
3719;Funnily enough, the actors thought originally this would only take a few weeks!
3720;And there were a couple of good films inbetween that didn't get the recognition they deserved!
3721;i suppose everyone will always say this is the best of the trilogy.
3722;"I am new as a fan to science fiction
I:8405;3723;Heard alot of great reviews about this movie, you need to add this to your collection.
I:8405;3724;this is an awesome movie.
I:8405;3725;the special effects are amazing and the plot is very deep.
I:8405;3726;the plot may be somewhat confusing at first but at the end of the movie, you'll be fully understanding it and thinking how all the events fit into place.
I:8405;3727;the action scenes are incredibly exciting and the music fits perfectly with the movie.
I:8405;3728;altogether it is an awesome movie.
I:8405;3729;The Wachowski Brothers have succeeded in making one of the most fresh and innovative Sci.
I:8405;3730;fi/action movies ever made, with a attention.
I:8405;3731;grabbing storyline, nonstop action, and astrophysical acting performances across the board.
I:8405;3732;Keanu Reeves (NEO) portrays an early sense of doubt and disbelief very convincingly, and makes a smooth transition throughout the film as he comes to terms with the """"real world"""" and his struggle to save it."""
3733;Laurence Fishburne,(MORPHEUS, the leader of the human resistance) delivers another exciting performance as his charisma and strong presence shine through in this movie.
3734;anne Moss (TRINITY) a member of Morpheus' crew as well as Neo's eventual love interest.
3735;The movie continues forward at backbreaking pace, offering enthralling plot twists, suspense.
3736;filled action sequences, and some of the best special effects ever to grace the big screen.
3737;So get it now and be surprised to enter the new world.
3738;The matrix is a classic.
3739;After all these years it's still good.
3740;The Matrix is one of the most eye.
3741;opening, electrifyingly original movies to hit the big screen in years with Keanu Reeves finally bringing a touch of respectability to the much.
3742;One of the most compelling things about The Matrix is its biblical theme on Messianism, the belief that a particular hopeful saviour, who is usually derived from the outside world, comes and saves the world.
3743;He resembles Jesus in being `the absolute One' that is able to perform miracles and in conflict with Thomas Anderson, the Satan in this movie.
3744;the Matrix demonstrates that the story of Jesus is still relevant in today's world.
3745;Although the real Satan may lack the black rimed sunglasses and sophisticated suit, this film is capable of showing us His miracles, teachings, and inevitable love for humanity.
3746;This is one of my favorite sci.
3747;I like the story, too: a young software technician named Neo gets a visit from mysterious woman named Trinity who he embarks and an action journey with.
3748;Should have won fifteen Oscars.
3749;fi spectacular from Wachowski brothers.
3750;groundbreaking both in the spectacular special effects that we've since taken for granted.
3751;Turns out he's right in a big way.
3752;I am a big fan of this movie.
3753;Still a great movie though but not an original masterpiece that I thought.
3754;But Keanu's less than stellar preformance is saved by the amazing concept and theme (not to mention special effects) in and of this movie.
3755;It's great for people who take movies in a literal sense and it's even better for people who will try to analyize it in a metaphoric sense!
3756;with something new in it every time!
3757;It's action packed and meaningful all rolled up into one!
3758;If you didn't like it the first time, watch it again.
3759;Casting for Reloaded and Revolutions is much improved.
3760;imagine that the world you thought you knew and the life you thought you had, were all lies and make believe.
3761;The trick is to keep viewing it until it reveals itself to you bit by bit if necessary.
3762;Morpheus represents John the Baptist as he is the one that continues to tell people the good news.
3763;Nebuchadnezzar (the name of Morpheus' ship) was the greatest and most powerful of all the Babylonian kings.
3764;There are so many new things to see here.
3765;There are many levels and we don't get all of them at the same time.
3766;I do urge you to see it more than once.
3767;They all did some amazing stunt work and really pushed themselves physically and mentally to learn all of the martial arts moves and other dazzling feats.
3768;Yes there are a lot of CGI scenes but the actors are underneath most of it providing the movement for the camera to capture.
3769;keanu finally tries a little acting, and although not oscar caliber,he's still good.
3770;The special effects are spectacular.
3771;They could make this movie worth seeing just for them.
3772;The action scenes that house these special effects are fantastic as well.
3773;The supporting cast of L. fishburne(who is always great!)
3774;and the rest of the crew adds another jewel to this crown.
3775;it is, however, the story that really draws you in and makes you wonder.
3776;It is well thought out and developed, which is rare for an action movie, and it is that story which makes The Matrix a highly recommended film.
3777;No words can really do this film justice, it is easily the best film I have seen in a long time.
3778;The documenaries are brilliant, and the commentary by the editors Carrie.
3779;anne Moss is well worth listening to.
3780;Nice idea to release the Blu.
3781;ray box sets with all four movies, but really this is the movie we have all been waiting to be released as a solo.
3782;order what has to be one of the best sci.
3783;It is the first of its genre and the best.
3784;It opened a whole new way to film fight scenes.
3785;worth owning and watching several times.
3786;story and action set this one a masterpiece of sci.
3787;pure pulasating rock music and fight sequences blend together to make a grand stand of a movie.
3788;changing movie I have ever seen.
3789;The artistry from acting to storytelling to special effects is phenomenal.
3790;Moss is brilliant and strong.
3791;This group of artists is in the moment and knows how to create something human.
3792;I was kind if exited when I bought this but the movie just didn't transition as well as I thought.
3793;The image is crisp as is the sound.
3794;Content wise, this is a wonderful film, which is a metaphor for enlightenment.
3795;Free your mind is its mantra.
3796;This really was a nice surprise.
3797;it's really cool!I recomnend this movie to everybody!My brother likes karate.
3798;that's why he likes this movie.
3799;the visual effects are really cool!You should watch it!The movie is cool!
3800;Excellent Movie to watch unreal special Fx Very imaginative plot.
3801;The creators put a lot of effort into it and it pays off.
3802;A stunning blend of action and science fiction, The Matrix tells the tale of a computer programmer who stumbles into an alternate world that forever changes his perception of reality.
3803;A masterpiece of technical wizardry and storytelling skill, this is one of those memorable films that succeeds on every one of its many ambitious levels.
3804;The superb performances of the actors are equally important.
3805;his is a performance of controlled but passionate intensity.
3806;anne Moss' performance as Trinity brings to the film a tenderness and humanity which greatly complement the high.
3807;The Matrix is a wonderfully literate film whose dialogue includes references from Greek mythology, the Bible, Christian theology, and English literature.
3808;And one of the central themes of the film.
3809;is one that can be found in many of the world's great works of literature.
3810;you'll appreciate the film even more.
3811;The movie is great, when I watched it on the big screen.
3812;Very good movie, it was suspenseful and it was unpredictable.
3813;The best role movie for Keanu Reeves.
3814;tHE MATRIX is just the perfect movie.
3815;It has a great stroyline, great philosophy behind the story, and great action scenes.
3816;It is a movie that makes you think about the nature of the world, reality, metaphysics and much more.
3817;It is a movie that makes you question almost everything in life.
3818;How so many people loved this film, I will never know.
3819;I like Trinity, cause she is an alpha female, and those types of women always intrigue me.
3820;Strong and hard, as well as soft and feminine at the same time!
3821;Great story line that makes you think!
3822;It is truly a visionary film that mixes real human drama about self and the meaning of life into a slick science fiction piece that is truly approachable by sci.
3823;A piece about some of the philosophy behind some of the things that happen in the movies, or the names used, would have been nice.
3824;Excellent special effects, great characters, interesting story line.
3825;One of the best sci.
3826;This is the original classic.
3827;It was the best movie I ever saw.
3828;It some times was a little confusing but if you stick with it you will think it is great too.
3829;It was, overall, the best movie.
3830;The Matrix is one of the best movies I have ever watched!
3831;Keanu Reeves is one of the main characters and does a great job in this movie.
3832;He leads a double life of being a computer programmer and master hacker, but finally finds his true lot in life when he finds out he is in control of not only his future, but the matrix , which controls humanity.
3833;The Matrix at times may seem to be a very serious movie, but there are times when it is funny too.
3834;I would recommend this movie to adults, because for younger childeren they might not get the plot and follow the movie as easily as older people do.
3835;Animated prequels, titled The Animatrix, have also been created based on the success of the original film.
3836;Obviously many are surprised at the success of the series but is the original as great as many claim it is or is all the praise just a lie?The story goes that Thomas Anderson is another run of the mill guy.
3837;He works in an office building during the day but outside his usual job, he sells computer programs and such in his spare time.
3838;No one really knows for sure.
3839;Artificially Intelligent Machines have taken over the planet and have hooked every human being into The Matrix, a computer program created to keep everyone in check, so that the dead may be used for fuel.
3840;The story for The Matrix is probably the best ever created for a film of this genre.
3841;The Matrix blends not only good storytelling and amazing special effects but also blends references and elements from classic literature and mythology which is extremely rare for sci.
3842;Keanu Reeves, who is probably best known before The Matrix for his role in Speed, plays the character of Thomas Anderson, aka Neo.
3843;Reeves' acting is much better then most of his other films and shows that he is really maturing in his choices of roles.
3844;Some of the dialogue sounds weird coming from him and some of his actions seem awkward but that is his acting style that seems right in place for this kind of film that throws all kinds of weird things at you.
3845;Laurence Fishburne is absolutely perfect in the role of Morpheus, the man who trains Neo to free his mind from the machine controlled world.
3846;Fishburne presents a strange yet intriguing feeling with the character of Morpheus that always keeps you guessing at what he character is going to do next, which makes him a favorite among many fans of the film.
3847;annie Moss is pretty good as Trinity.
3848;His character is a great highlight of the film.
3849;overall, The Matrix is truly an amazing experience that must be seen to believe.
3850;The special effects are only part of this film and aren't the main focus, which the Wachowski brothers pull off with great storytelling and direction.
3851;The special effect sequences in The Matrix are probably the best choreographed scenes you will ever see in sci.
3852;It shows that a lot more went into each scene other then just the CGI, which is so rare in most films released today.
3853;The plot for The Matrix is the main focus and it is very well done.
3854;And a lot of things that have to be taken from The Matrix are hidden in the film but that's what makes watching this film so much fun.
3855;The Matrix is probably one of the best things to come along in quite awhile.
3856;This singular film will hopefully change the way we watch movies for many years to come.
3857;It shows that there is more to a film then spectacular effects.
3858;It is the little things like chromatography, plot developments and such that make a truly engaging movie experience.
3859;explosive,deep thrilling adventure that keeps you thinking all the way thru, a must see movie twice no three times to see the underlining truths of this movie, are we in a matrix , i wonder
3860;After all these years it's still a great movie to watch.
3861;The amazon streaming worked perfectly.
3862;If it WAS an original idea, maybe i'd say this is a good movie.
3863;But since it's just a remix of many great stories, i'd say THE MATRIX is just a mirage of a good movie.
3864;f. All of the above.
3865;The answer is a most emphatic F.
3866;An everyday joe (Keanu Reeves) leads a double life.
3867;"By day, he is a program writer for a respectable software company 
I:8405;3868;this movie is definitely a movie for guys.
I:8405;3869;Bombs, martial arts, guns, and even an Old West.
I:8405;3870;fi action films of recent years, where the emphasis seems to be on how well things get blowed up , The Matrix has a brain and knows how to use it.
I:8405;3871;It succeeds on almost every level.
I:8405;3872;most prominently, The Matrix succeeds in showing us violence and action in new and previously unimagined ways.
I:8405;3873;case in point: the hyperkinetic action sequences seek not only to thrill, but also to bend the mind, to introduce new possibilities.
I:8405;3874;instead, we get a visionary, mind.
I:8405;3875;IS the most imaginative sci.
I:8405;3876;The Matrix also has an enviable human element, with Carrie.
I:8405;3877;anne Moss finding a great mix of toughness and vulnerability as Trinity.
I:8405;3878;Laurence Fishburne does excellent work as the enigmatic Morpheus, though I found myself wishing we could spend less time on Morpheus' Zen.

I:8405;3880;And Hugo Weaving is beautifully understated as Agent Smith.
I:8405;3881;driven) than a real extension of the story.
I:8405;3882;Otherwise, it's a masterpiece of action and science fiction.
I:8405;3883;This is without a doubt the greatest movie I have ever seen.
I:8405;3884;It has an engrossing plot and gets better everytime I watch it.
I:8405;3885;Everytime i see this movie I learn new things about the plot.
I:8405;3886;The special effects were great, but not the best reason to see this movie.
I:8405;3887;The story is smartly written and acted out.
I:8405;3888;I own all 3, and this one sets the stage, and then some.
I:8405;3889;i actually got gas from this movie.
I:8405;3890;This is my favorite movie, and that is saying a lot considering I have seen over 500 movies.
I:8405;3891;This movie is gripping right from the beginning, mysterious which draws you in, and consistently provides a dramatic and interesting plot.
I:8405;3892;It is philosophical at times, making it a """"thinkers"""" movie, but there is also all out action, making it suitable for action movie fans as well."""
3893;It really pushes the envelope for special effects and the creation of effective sci.
3894;The Matrix surprised everyone in 1999 by being so utterly brilliant.
3895;A truly original film, it had a similar sort of impact to when Star Wars came out in 1977.
3896;The film follows Anderson's dramatic discovery of the real world, and ultimately, a dramatic discovery concerning himself.
3897;The film is set up for at least one sequal, but works well as a single independent film.
3898;The screen effects are unprecendented in their brilliance, and are enough on their own to keep you on the edge of your seat.
3899;Besides that however, the story is fascinating, and the script very appropriate.
3900;Fishbourne is very cool as Morpheus, and newcomer Carrie Anne.
3901;First time I watched it I was drunk (at the movies) and, I thought it was the best movie I had ever seen.
3902;I had to prove this by watching it again and, I was right!
3903;Exhilarating from beginning to end.
3904;Mind provoking and fast paced, a must see!
3905;Worth the couple dollars for sure.
3906;My 12 year old even enjoyed it!
3907;fis I have seen in my entire life.
3908;It can potentially be an extraordinary sci.
3909;great great film with flaws, but in the way I like it.
3910;But ideas about cyberspace have become more sophisticated, just as they have become a part of the daily lives of more people.
3911;After that jolting introduction to stunning, dark production design and gravity.
3912;defying martial arts, we are transported to more familiar territory.
3913;"Larry and Andy Wachowski, who wrote and directed ""The Matrix"", relied on imagery and ideas that the viewer would recognize to bring us into the world of the Matrix, while they created a truly beautiful cyberpunk aesthetic that audiences would not soon forget."
3914;He is a prisoner of illusion, a slave of an enormous system of inhuman machines.
3915;Kind of abstract for an action movie.
3916;"But ""The Matrix"" cyberpunk tone, its stunning visuals, combined with themes that have variously been interpreted as socialist and capitalist, Christian and pantheist, postmodern and crassly commercial, give it staying power."
3917;It's one of those rare, good, character.
3918;driven actions movies that has wide audience appeal.
3919;The Matrix is a fabulous movie.
3920;But to that audience it is one of the most intelligent and fascinating movie of all time.
3921;Also, the soundtrack is equally as good.
3922;Got the urge to watch movies that I liked when I wore a younger man's clothes.
3923;thrillers of all time, becoming one of the most popular movies ever.
3924;And he must discover his force of power before the Agents who control THE MATRIX can stop him.
3925;THE MATRIX is a sweet kick.
3926;ass ride from beginning to end!
3927;The unique story, acting, effects and action adventure, set the standard for Sci.
3928;The Matrix, my favorite movie of all time I might add, is a phenomenal film.
3929;It's a work of art.
3930;The special effects are out of this world, the story unfolds extremely well, the plot is the most innovative one ever, the script is just plain amazing, and the cinematography is superb.
3931;I will say that this plot is so amazing and so innovative, and it really makes you sit down and think.
3932;I think it's a fact, not an opinion, that the plot is the most innovative one ever written.
3933;The acting is well done as well, and the script, unfolding of the story, and special effects are all top of the crop too.
3934;All I can do now is give my whole hearted recommendation.
3935;Matrix and Revisited are spectacular special fx.
3936;This is edge of your seat spectacular.
3937;The plot is good, too.
3938;I liked the way Hollywood producers.
3939;went to great lengths of working out the effects with the best of comic makers.
3940;loved this movie and the first sequel I gave them as gifts to various family members.
3941;Matrix is an amazing movie, but not just for the entertainment value.
3942;There are many deep truths buried in this movie's metaphorical presentation, if one is willing to open their minds.
3943;A trusted associate recommended I check this movie out.
3944;This is an exceptional movie relating to the art of perception as pertaining to LIFE!
3945;It is very rare to find a complete movie in everything here is one for you.
3946;The Matrix, a great Thrilling ride, sets new standards for the film industry.
3947;Simply, One of the best movies ever made.
3948;Each film is strong in it's own right but together they flow continuously following the adventures of Neo (Keanu Reeves).
3949;ann Moss save him, making the film terrific.
3950;Go ahead, take the Red pill.
3951;explored world of science fiction, carrying the viewer into a parallel world of thrilling martial arts and fighting that gets you so riled up that you feel invincible.
3952;Magnificent mark in special effects as well.
3953;With it's amazing visual effects, gripping plot and storyline, and wonderful acting, it was a movie that kept me on the edge of my seat, and had me walking out of the theater wondering, What .
3954;This movie is definately a must.
3955;edge graphics, intelligent film, cann't watch it enough, I wish I could rate this a 6 star.
3956;This film is a rollercaster ride of excitement.
3957;Neo is the best *anagram for one* knowing that he is the one.
3958;p. s. Morpheous is very cool!
3959;The story is brilliant, the stunts are amazing, esp.
3960;Great movie, but one thing bothers me.
3961;The structure of the movie is perfect.
3962;With its hidden Christian plugs it makes one realize the perfection the film holds.
3963;style violence, but it's engaging enough to pull you into the story.
3964;Keanu is perfect in this part .
3965;his personal quirks fit the character of Neo so well you'd think the part was written around him, Carrie Ann Moss kicks ass, as does the rest of the cast.
3966;The end of this one is perfect, and the other two just wasted the potential that this one created.
3967;First time I concentrated on the hand to hand combat too much but if you can get past these guys playing patticakes with eachother, this is a great movie.
3968;The scene where Keanu and Fishburne spar is still hilarious and the set looks like it came straight form 'Fist of Legend' but it is still fun.
3969;The whole computer world never really appealed to me but it's a ton of fun trying to figure things out.
3970;The shootouts are great and all of the acting is top notch.
3971;there are 2 commentaries but the making of was a look into something that is as interesting as it gets.
3972;Getting a glimpse of Woo Ping set up his action is great and even better trying to figure out what goes on in this guys mind.
3973;I hope we get a new special edition one day with a long piece on him.
3974;This was the best movie I've seen all year.
3975;Keanu Reeves, who I'm not a real fan of, plays the part of Neo perfectly.
3976;The rest of the cast is great especially Laurence Fishburne.
3977;But the real reason the movie works is the story and the fx.
3978;And the special fx are just that special .
3979;I think this film has to be seen twice to be liked, because now I agree with those who say The Matrix is one of the best science fiction films of the century!
3980;It is smart, engaging, fun, action.
3981;packed and thrilling entertainment that impressed the living daylights out of me.
3982;Still, it serves as a great [story].
3983;A very well made picture that still look and feels as intense as it did back in 99.
3984;One of the finest Blu ray experiences out there, from the audio to the video.
3985;One of my favorite sci.
3986;Keanu Reeves is one awesome actor.
3987;The thing I like the most about this movie is the adventure.
3988;Even though they don't really go anywhere, I like how they've been through like a lot of stuff, and the music keeps the intensity and suspense in the movie, and is able to show you exactly what's going on.
3989;I also love how smoothly they take one half of the movie and make it a scientific explanation for what's going on and all that, and the other half with action.
3990;They are able to fit it all in and make it one awesome movie.
3991;Alright you have to admit.
3992;top good guys and villians and a great sountrack.
3993;One after you know what this Matrix is does it really kicks into high gear.
3994;This is a film that I enjoy watching over and over.
3995;I hope to see Reloaded on an IMAX screen since it is being converted to that and being release around the end of May or so.
3996;Have you ever thought if one person could stand up against an extraordinarily powerful entity that keeps updating itself in order to be invincible?
3997;A group of dedicated rebels for the cause of the truth.
3998;The Wachowski Brothers have done a brilliant job of pushing the envelope in filmmaking.
3999;The Matrix is basically the Star Wars of this generation, a science fiction movie so profound and visually appealing that even a decade later nothing else has come close (Avatar looked great, but even its fans agree that it had a fairly unoriginal story).
4000;It's telling of our society that it took 20 years for the Star Wars trilogy to be tarnished by its sequels, yet The Matrix sequels came only 4 years later (along with plenty of games and tie.
4001;The layers in the foreground and background looked fine to me (and almost 3.
4002;This goes away as she approaches Neo to whisper in his ear.
4003;this package comes with tons of great extras.
4004;My favorite is still the music.
4005;I doubt most people will go through all the commentaries and documentaries, but it's nice to have them there.
4006;A movie needs to do more than simply keep you awake.
4007;For the intelligent human however and especially for science fiction fans, this movie holds absolutely nothing.
4008;'The Matrix' was the big unexpected smash of a few summers ago.
4009;It elevated Keanu Reeves to A. list material again, dazzled us with special effects and presented an interesting view of the not.
4010;The central idea is so clever that, with stupendous special effects hammered at you constantly, you almost don't notice how superficial this movie really is.
4011;Along for the ride are Morpheus (Fishburne) and cute love interest Trinity (Moss).
4012;planetary war is absolutely brilliant.
4013;Fortunately he's also ably supported by a good cast and special effects that are truly out of this world, no pun intended.
4014;mo effects of a bullet moving slowly towards a person coupled with fantastic martial arts stunts definitely make it a movie to watch for its special effects.
4015;Still, it will doubtless become a cult classic of it time, especially with its teen demographic, even if it doesn't say one thing about society at the time .
4016;brow or particularly profound film.
4017;give thanks, please, for the moody and perfectly.
4018;placed soundtrack, the clever SFX, and the enthralling fight sequences.
4019;And that's all you can ask from an action/sci.
4020;the most riveting scene in the film for me was a very simple one, the group of rebels led by Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) lead Neo back inside The Matrix for the first time since he learned of its existance.
4021;The Wachowski's only provide hints of this, instead they throw at us incredible action sequences that are unsurpassed in movie history.
4022;Ofcourse this kind of nitpicking would have deprived this very thrilling film of its thrills.
4023;special effects which will be copied and re.
4024;created in many more movies for many more years, including the fight choreography, which was breathkaing and excting.
4025;This Movie rocks, even though it's Old!It gets slow at some point , but overall very entertaining.
4026;The Matrix was filmed in a expertly slick style very reminiscent of Blade.
4027;There was a surprisingly good performance by the often lacklustre Keanu Reeves who plays Neo a young man unhappy with his life.
4028;Laurence Fishburne gives a stunningly cool performance as the `prophet' figure Morpheus who is searching for `the One' his `messiah'.
4029;The supporting cast were also first rate.
4030;the Action sequences throughout are extremely well done and powerful.
4031;There are superb balletic fight scenes as Neo and Trinity take the action to the Agents lair.
4032;Machines as smart at these would be using nuclear fusion for power at the very least.
4033;The unknown possibilities within an enormously complex virtual world inspiring greater limits in the real.
4034;and the ambiguity between what you feel is real and what else may actually be real.
4035;Add this movie to your collection.
4036;a pure adrenaline rush of a movie.
4037;It gets better with every viewing.
4038;i was quite excited to see it.
4039;and all the real clever stuff happens at the end.
4040;The movie is as good as ever.
4041;def look of the movie, but come on folks!
4042;Let's have more behind the scenes extras!
4043;It is a visual feast, and the Oracle as cookie.
4044;screen details in this blu ray version are stunning.
4045;fi thriller that really keeps you interested through the whole movie.
4046;this subversive dystopian superman story was a true ground breaker in every facet of its creation.
4047;the bending of perception and the ability to suspend disbelief have been with us since the beginning of film, but the then new ability of truly seamless special effects shown by this movie were woven with a Phillip K. Dick style story.
4048;line and the gritty worn realism of George Lucas at his best.
4049;but this movie spawned a golden age of science fiction movies that is with us to this day.
4050;for me, it is worth every single cent.
4051;the movie itself is also highly watchable although the story might be a bit blur.
4052;I have never been a fan of Keanu but this one is the best I've seen him do.
4053;Couldn't beat the special effects and it actually has a great twist of a plot.
4054;How often do you feel compelled to talk to the characters outloud?
4055;I have found a new genre of film to enjoy.
4056;great action sequences, intellectual in places.
4057;the more often you watch it the more you pick up.
4058;This film raises some very interesting points.
4059;Reflecting back on the enormous popular and critical success of 'The Matrix', it is refreshing to note that people were overwhelmingly drawn to a film that conformed itself neither to the cynical and pessimistic bent that informs many recent movies nor to an easy and clich d sort of optimism.
4060;This film is especially interesting for the numerous clues it gives about how spirituality is envisioned in the modern, technological world: organized groups and systems of all kinds (social, religious, political.)
4061;it does get caught up in a few noisy and overdone action scenes, but it remains fascinating from beginning to end.
4062;And the movie works well as an introduction to philosophy.
4063;If you have a good sound system, turn it up and you will feel yourself in the Matrix too !
4064;The Follow the White Rabbit is excellent !
4065;It is one of the finest combination of excellent story and amazing cinematography that I have ever seen.
4066;There are plenty of scenes that you can jump straight to.
4067;fi fan to love this story.
4068;I think anyone who is into technology will love it.
4069;, will certainly enjoy this film.
4070;I have seen this movie over ten times and I still enjoy it.
4071;I find that the action and the alternate reality thing going on keeps me hooked onto the movie.
4072;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
4073;The Matrix is one of the best sci.
4074;He believes that Thomas is the Chosen One, the One who would defeat the Matrix and liberate Planet Earth from the controlling grasp of the Matrix dimension . . . the Matrix is a visual feast for the eyes, a special effects extravaganza, which is most noticable in the heavy combat scenes.
4075;But there is also a good storyline.
4076;The film gets that message across clearly.
4077;It gives the viewer a lot to think about.
4078;All this in an awesome sci.
4079;The first half was amazing and mind.
4080;Really I think they really could have done a better job with a more intelligent ending to the movie.
4081;It's still worth seeing for the first half though.
4082;The Matrix, the first time I viewed it, was amazing.
4083;And then I bought the video version.
4084;It was still great, but the non.
4085;The action sequences, the special.
4086;effects, are simply stunning, the premise entertaining, the actors appealing and their acting not bad.
4087;keanu Reeves was good, Carrie.
4088;ann Moss was gorgeous, Laurence Fishburne was fun if a little too self.
4089;absorbed, and the agents were fun, interesting characters.
4090;charm that the similar and superior Dark City had.
4091;This is a great movie for anyone.
4092;It has great effects and good story line.
4093;The Matrix is a great movie!
4094;I wanted to see it again and in the future.
4095;In 1999, Andy and Larry Wachowski took this idea, and completely flipped it on it's ear with this surprise box office blockbuster that some of us love, and others love to hate.
4096;The first time I layed eyes on this film I loved it, I loved everything about it, the idea (even though it mirror's 1998's Dark City, a superior film and another one of my all time favorites), the special effects, the costume design (tell me that Neo, Morpheus, and crew don't look just plain cool), and how the Wachowski Brothers inject kung.
4097;fi epic that fans have waited years for.
4098;breaker for a whole new level of special effects and action sequences.
4099;The story, although based on a old philisophical premise, is a god.
4100;and when you thought it couldn't get any better, The Matrix comes packed with solid extras.
4101;This film is clearly revolutionary to the action and sci.
4102;The groundbreaking special effects have brought the expectations of the viewing public up to new levels.
4103;gore Vidal is undoubtedly a very intelligent man, a gifted writer, and man of excellent reason.
4104;jumbo without the solid theme to back it up.
4105;There is nothing of value behind the excellent special effects.
4106;The story and character developments are fun but not original.
4107;Near the earth's core where it's still warm ?!?!?!?!?
4108;The fact that this adapts in some many ways Christian prophecy (The one.
4109;Goofy musings on the nature of reality are the work of junior high philosophy buffs, and not particularly bright ones.
4110;offs, both serious and parodying.
4111;After all, it's kind of hard to love the ideas behind the film when the machines are so much more amusing than the humans.
4112;I love the first matrix movie, infact I don't even really like revolutions or reloaded that much, but the first one is awesome!
4113;It shipped really quick (only like 2.3 days) and the show looks and sounds great!
4114;it's not he best transfer out there, but the picture doesn't look very grainy and it has some good documentary style special features along with it!
4115;Every scene well done and all fit together in a complete, perfect way.
4116;i enjoyed it so much i went back the following day and watched it again!
4117;excellent special FX , excellent acting, excellent storyline.
4118;I loved the movie it made alot of sense.
4119;The Matrix is a film that has a very personal meaning to me.
4120;Everytime i watch this movie I notice something new.
4121;The Matrix is a truly magnificent film!
4122;From the very start I was excited, intrigued and downright gobsmacked as to the depth and feel to the film.
4123;I truly loved this flick.
4124;The funky urban feel that it had, and the effects incorporated into it were loveable.
4125;You really felt that this was going to be a good film right from the start, and I tell you now it doesnt dissapoint.
4126;A very clever and believable story line, especially in the mad capped corrupted world we live in nowadays.
4127;it came, it impacted and by god I friggin loved it.
4128;I cant say any more than that !
4129;The entire true concept is upon taking the red pill, (A very strong robo cough gel) He disconnects from the reality, the prison that is the matrix.
4130;robitussin is a dissociative and contains a chemical DXM, that can give you out of body experiences, also allow you to feel and hear secret frequencies inaudible to the normal ear, and yes, allows you to disconnect from this reality, upon waking up, you realize that you are a prisoner and a slave to this system.
4131;but it sure is one heaven of a ride for those 8 hours on 4th plateau!
4132;I recommend this movie with some robo cough gels, 2 or 3 bottles of them.
4133;This is an excellent movie.
4134;I recommend it to everyone!
4135;There are a few problems with the story, but it is good for the most part.
4136;But I on the other hand, got the whole story the first time.
4137;From its opening sequence, The Matrix takes you on a wild ride through the senses.
4138;Tight action sequences, terrific martial arts choreography, engrossing plotline, alongside numerous, original cinematic sequences, the movie draws you into a world of its own.
4139;filled with the most original camera work ever done in cinema, the action sequences will leave you breathless.
4140;the Matrix is a highly entertaining and thought.
4141;It makes you think and question our everyday life.
4142;time effect with Neo was one of the best special effects in the whole movie.
4143;It makes you want to move like him and be like him.
4144;Anyway, it makes you wonder if we are really here, if we are actually in a real world.
4145;All the points that they made fit in together very well and almost never contradicted each other.
4146;If one could rate a movie's greatness by how many other copy it, then the Matrix has to be one of the greatest movies of all time.
4147;Combined with the great storyline, dialogue and casting, this movie became a trendsetter.
4148;the storyline itself is incredible, probably the best plot of any movie released in 1999.
4149;This is by far the best movie for Keanu Reeves.
4150;ann Moss was also great.
4151;As a visual effects extravaganza, The Matrix is one of the best films ever made.
4152;The Wachowski brothers, together with a host of now.
4153;winning technicians, have created a bleak yet stunning view of the world as run by computers, with effects that will have you hitting rewind just so you can marvel anew at what can be done with technology these days (the fight scenes in particular are mind.
4154;that life as we know it is essentially a giant computer game.
4155;in fact, everyone in the movie speaks very slowly and deliberately, enough so that it gets to be funny after a while.
4156;Keanu Reeves is his usual expressionless self, but this is definitely a breakout film for Carrie.
4157;The Matrix is a fun movie to watch, no question, but it's not the great manifesto some diehards claim it to be.
4158;When asked at the first session of a recent movie making class I was taking, what is your favorite movie of all time?
4159;this was it!Of course there are breathtaking action sequences, moody camera direction et al.
4160;My first viewing was exciting.
4161;An instant cult classic and a 'must.
4162;As an action film its superb as a sensible film its not.
4163;If like me you prefer deeper films such as la confidential or Young poisoners hand book you'll love it.
4164;If you liked the big lebowski youll love it since every one whos seen the big l i know loves the matrix :)
4165;This is the best movie ever made.
4166;bullet cam shots are some of the best shots in the industry.
4167;up conclusion, the opening sequence is breathtaking.
4168;The kinetic action is perfectly accompanied by Don Davis' score, which at that point evokes the dark feel of a classic, Hollywood thriller.
4169;the story is about a future in which humans created machines so intelligent, that the machines won a war which left the world a desert, and humans their slaves.
4170;actually, gleaming, prosperous Sydney, Australia.
4171;The Wachowskis do a somewhat better job of explaining that part.
4172;"it is the ""agents"" who give the machines a ""human"" face."
4173;"As ""Agent Smith,"" Aussie actor Hugo Weaving is a memorable heavy."
4174;"Enter Neo"" (Keanu Reeves), the hacker whose name is clearly an anagram of One, as in The."
4175;kicking female member of the rebel troupe.
4176;perhaps the greatest accomplishment of The Matrix, is that within a set.
4177;care deeply about these people.
4178;"the cast does praiseworthy work, especially Fishburne, Moss, and in a brief but moving scene, Gloria Foster (""the Oracle""), a woman of a certain age who still looks great."
4179;The stars clearly do a lot of the fighting themselves.
4180;"human ""Frank Black"" from the classic Chris Carter TV series, Millennium."
4181;Computers will never be able to initiate thought and action.
4182;faced white guys, whereas the good guys are a mix of blacks and whites.
4183;all of the above issues must be compartmentalized while watching the movie, in order to enjoy it.
4184;Note that while kids usually love The Matrix, it's also not necessarily a good idea to watch it with very young ones.
4185;At its conclusion, my three.year.
4186;One feature allows you to watch the movie with subtitles, in order to see how Don Davis' music subtly carries it.
4187;style to punk rock .
4188;fashioned to match the unique mood of each scene.
4189;another feature gives you the option of stopping the movie, to view footage of the special effects that went into the scene being shown.
4190;The more knowledge, the better!
4191;Yet another feature, on the making of The Matrix, focuses on the Hong Kong.
4192;"time"" special effects invented for the movie."
4193;Great extra's, awesome soundtrack, great action, awesome concept!
4194;the single most well made and thought.
4195;watch it more than once to get the whole story.
4196;I think that this is one of the greatest movies of all time and I really think you should get it if you havent already!
4197;It is interesting and when you watch it you just won't want to stop!
4198;You've got to get it!
4199;This movie was by far the best movie I've ever seen.
4200;The movie is great all the way around.
4201;The action is fast paced, the story is awesome, and the special effects are superb.
4202;Am I the only person who thinks that this movie got all the positive reaction Star Wars episode I deserved, and Star Wars Episode I got all the criticism The Matrix deserved.
4203;It's about as thought provoking as the question what would you do if.
4204;(you won the lottery, had three wishes etc).
4205;Absolutely A magnificent mind opener, grips you like a fist,you think about it for days.
4206;Everttime you see it, another whole view is opened up!
4207;Where does one begin to critique a movie that was so good?
4208;taking and have developed a whole new level of mind boggling movements to this close to mastered division of movies!
4209;While many movies these days tend to be heavy on special effects and light on substance, I was pleased to see the Wachowski brothers had managed to maintain an excellent plot structure and build it in an amazing sequence of events straight up to the end.
4210;This movie is a classic, not only does it have a novel concept, but it has amazing visual effects and an incredible sound track.
4211;Trust me, he has moments that are funny, but he does a great job on this film.
4212;If you are or are not a Lawrence Fishburn fan, you will find that he really carries this movie.
4213;The machines won, but their domination was incomplete: a single city, Zion, located so deeply underground that their energy source is radiation from the Earth's core, kept alive the resistance movement that Neo .
4214;reality apotheosis, Neo ignores the attention of the female lead, a very sexy, kick.
4215;As it film, it relies heavily on groovy special effects in its crazy.
4216;Most people in this country see similarities between the movie and their own faith and draw conclusions that are mostly untrue.
4217;"In Hinduism, the adage, ""the world is Maya (the world is an illusion)"" plays an important part in the story."
4218;The idea that the world is our own creation and by simply changing our preception and awareness, we in turn change our surroundings.
4219;"In the film, of course, Neo is the stellar man
I:8405;4220;The Matrix is a very good movie.
I:8405;4221;The visual effects are ground.
I:8405;4222;This is perhaps the most incredible movie ever made when it comes to replay value.
I:8405;4223;The cast is perfectly chosen.
I:8405;4224;Don't listen to what any says, Keanu is great in this movie.
I:8405;4225;Amazing special effects highlight this amazing story, which is an absolute thrill ride from start to finish.
I:8405;4226;This was by far the greatest movie i have ever seen.
I:8405;4227;It had great special effects and great music throughout the whole movie.
I:8405;4228;Has it really been 10 years since the matrix brought new meaning to my life?
I:8405;4229;The Matrix is a action movie with a great plot.
I:8405;4230;i've seen it more than 3 times in the movie theaters and each time I enjoyed the plot,action,graphics and great sound track.
I:8405;4231;There was a certain hip ambience, that I found unsettling yet compelling at the same time.
I:8405;4232;The Matrix is more real than we think.
I:8405;4233;That is the purpose that we are exist in this earthly world.
I:8405;4234;This very meaning, if think through thoroughly, can help us understand our existence.
I:8405;4235;The Matrix is truly a masterpiece putting together to teach us one thing.
I:8405;4236;That our existence has a purpose that allows us to elevate to another higher dimension if we understand what life is all about.
I:8405;4237;But when you realize what you can capable of become, you can be on higher level than everyone else and that makes you become the One .
I:8405;4238;This then will help you see what many others can't see.
I:8405;4239;People say, I quote, Knowledge is power!
I:8405;4240;The Matrix is a great movie its starts when a guy named Nio is scerching for an answer to the question that is the main idea of this movie what is the Matrix after he the answer the plot more and more intersting and dangures.
I:8405;4241;This movvie is great and wonderfall don't miss it!
I:8405;4242;The whole concept was so fresh and imaginative.
I:8405;4243;The art direction and graphics still manages to impress and even after all this time, the action and suspense of this film is still razor blade sharp.
I:8405;4244;Laurence Fishburne's superb performance and the dazzling, artful special effects make this movie an entertaining experience.
I:8405;4245;Still, as entertaining as the special effects are in this fun movie, I'll still trade watching Donald O'Connor walk up walls in Singing in the Rain anyday over the wall.
I:8405;4246;Plus, Mr. o'Connor managed his wall walking without benefit of special effects!
I:8405;4247;when i first watched the matrix, i immediately thought, this is my favorite movie!
I:8405;4248;worldly, the acting profound, and the story smart.
I:8405;4249;it was great but after seeing the making.
I:8405;4250;by the fourth, it was great again, forgiving the knowledge of how it all worked.
I:8405;4251;Saw the Matrix as favor to another mature friend.
I:8405;4252;even science fiction has to be believable within its context"
4253;The great mystic vision of the 20th century .
4254;Of the three in the series, this is still the best IMO.
4255;It is a movie moved by meaning and powered by purpose.
4256;The music is great, as are the special effects.
4257;my favorite scene of such is when the helicopter impacts into the side of the building.
4258;And while this is movie is sci fi fantasy.
4259;it offers deep insight into the reality of our illusion.
4260;This is a movie with a message, and it says.
4261;& share a collective psychosis imparted via media mass hypnosis.
4262;& so your minds eye will now begin glowing with otherworldly knowing.
4263;Soon, you will see with xray vision eyes and without ego effort express thoughts deep and wise.
4264;fi classic that set a new course for innovation and creativity.
4265;fi fan will argue that whether they loved the movie or didn't.
4266;This is because, it has the special effects (mind blowing), it has the action, but is has something more, A STORY.
4267;a good science fiction movie will make people think about themselves and their roles in society.
4268;This movie also has wonderful special effects (won an oscar for that), and intense action, for anyone looking for a good time.
4269;either way, this movie will be enjoyed by any fan of Deep Sci.
4270;This movie was light years beyond its time with amazing graphics, cinematography and new ideas.
4271;a scrumptious movie for the mind that I can come back to over and over.
4272;My 14 yr old loved it.
4273;It's nice to watch an intelligently written movie,without cursing and sex.
4274;This movie is absolutely fantastic!
4275;This movie is packed with action and a great story.
4276;"time"" and created a multi."
4277;great story, great effects, if you haven't seen this yet, where have you been?
4278;Nice touch of dark color and cg designs on the bullets!
4279;Over all very cool and very recommended!
4280;possibly the best movie made following the postEra of sci.
4281;Combining mythology, religion, literature and kung.
4282;The movie then follows on to see Neo's triumphant rise to leading the rebels, and most importantly, finding himself.
4283;moss plays the ever so beautiful yet deadly Trinity, who helps Neo in winning the war.
4284;The Matrix smartly uses it's sleek design and cunning special effects (SFX) provided by big man John Gaeta to knock viewers off their feet.
4285;fu scenes are explosive and imaginative (e. g. Walking on walls, blurred punches), picture a Bruce Lee fight scene raised to the 10th power.
4286;The Matrix is definitely worth seeing more than once, I left the theatre with a feeling of ehhhhhh ehhhhhhhh I don't know .
4287;But what strikes me is that's how a movie becomes a classic: it has style (great music and direction), intrigue, pathos and even a drop of love.
4288;(exerpt) Such is simulation, insofar as it is opposed to representation.
4289;Finally we see a worthy descendent of the archetypal.
4290;hero type story: a lone hero on a quest to save the world.
4291;Along with that, the unique connection with our world and our time gives the movie an intimate perspective, forcing us, the viewers, to re.
4292;watch again and again, and keep wondering what if.
4293;watched the Matrix the other night, having just watched its outstanding sequel, Reloaded.
4294;The greater emphasis on philosophical themes in Reloaded casts new light on their more tangential (and thus confusing) treatment in the original film.
4295;The notion of choice, and the value of choice, thereafter reverberates through the film.
4296;Some folk don't want that sort of thing in a kung fu movie, but for me it justifies the price of admission.
4297;It is interesting, but there are better.
4298;Its morality is questioned, its value is medium.
4299;i used to love this movie.
4300;I wont deny its interesting, or that it has some pretty sweet sound effects, but I no longer feel the need to even own it.
4301;The Matrix is a very good movie, with a good plot and X. tremly cool special effects.
4302;I swear who ever thought of this plot is a genius!
4303;Keanu Reeves puts on a proformance of a life time!
4304;if you want to see an action packed movie full of kick A#$ special effects, get The Martrix and you will be so glad that you did!
4305;I will say this, though, The Matrix is an instant classic, which will be looked upon for many years to come.
4306;Color representation is great, with those greens looking very vivid, the blacks are just wonderful, very bold and inky.
4307;Bass is wonderfully strong, dynamics are strong throughout, and the clarity of the dialogue is on target.
4308;Pans are seamless, and even though the mix is 10 years old, it will still impress.
4309;overall, a package that is worth the money, specially if one disliked the other two dissapointing sequels.
4310;I have seen this movie 12 times and I love it more every time I watch it!
4311;The special effects are fantastic!
4312;The dialog and storyline is great!
4313;It has very well developed charactors, and they did a great job casting!
4314;I hope they are as good as this one!
4315;If you loved the Matrix and wanted to get the movie, and just the movie in a simple, cheap, Blu.
4316;ray package, well this is it.
4317;priced extra big packages that are out there.
4318;I loved this movie when it came out so I decided to get the Blu.
4319;It is simply one of the most beautifully made films I have ever seen.
4320;"hued cinematography is a standout
I:8405;4321;His dry, precise delivery and mannered poise is really quite entertaining to watch.
I:8405;4322;Anyway, thanks largely to Keanu Reeves' attractive screen presence, The Matrix makes for a diverting enough two hours or so of your time
I:8405;4323;ray today and I am happy with it.
I:8405;4324;rays and they look and sound great :.)
I:8405;4325;Matrix is an enjoyable action .
I:8405;4326;This film proves thant simple technology still can deliver good visual FX for example: I never imagined that the special secuences were made with the actors hanging on wires with motion control cameras over a green screen.
I:8405;4327;It has so many layers that you'll discover something new each time you watch it.
I:8405;4328;Often ignored is it's strong connection to the gnostic worldview: Perhaps we live in a world that's only a dream and need a savior to show us what is real.
I:8405;4329;generated dream world to the real world?
I:8405;4330;The movie is entertaining without an understanding of Gnosticism, but is absolutely intriguing with insight into story within the story.
I:8405;4331;Neo is born from the womb of an AI into this world and given the illusion of choice or the perception of free will.
I:8405;4332;The Wachowski brothers have managed to infuse a great, up.
I:8405;4333;The art direction is sublime, weaving future noir with comic book and producing a wonderfully believable cloth.
I:8405;4334;scenes is an amazing look into the massive effort involved in bringing something like this to the screen.
I:8405;4335;the fact that the Wachowski bros were able to introduce such important and beautiful modes of thought .
I:8405;4336;while wrapping the whole package in a action.
I:8405;4337;An entire generation of kids will now grow up thinking, howerver subtly, about these motifs.
I:8405;4338;This aspect of the film, historically speaking, makes it hugely important.
I:8405;4339;The fact that it's a fun and wild ride makes it wonderful.
I:8405;4340;You got yourself a winner.
I:8405;4341;Visually stunning and with the dolby 5.1 absolutely like being in the middle of the action.
I:8405;4342;A perfect gift for Christmas.
I:8405;4343;pounding beginning to the suspense.
I:8405;4344;filled end The Matrix captures your attention and never lets go.
I:8405;4345;fi, action, and martial arts"
4346;With a plot that stretches your imagination.
4347;"Morpheous believes Neo is ""the one"" who will deliver them to freedom."
4348;"i can tell you that the special effects are phenomenal and the action will leave you saying ""Wow""."
4349;Every time I see The Matrix I'm always as impressed as the first time I saw it.
4350;I know that this was a beloved movie according to my three sons.
4351;The cancelled Firefly was by far more entertaining and worthy of watching.
4352;Kept hoping for something cerebral, provocative, introspective or at least exciting.
4353;The Matrix definitely asks that question.
4354;I had the chance of seeing it in theaters, and let me tell you that it was one of the mose riveting movie experiences I've had in a long time.
4355;From there on it's a complete and awesome thrill ride.
4356;the special effects, camerawork, and editing are all top notch.
4357;The Matrix plays with your mind at every turn, and hopefully everyone will like it.
4358;we feel we can't go back to nature or escape society's very tight grip, and that's because it's by design, by government , those who want to control the means of extracting our energy to work for them.
4359;If you watch this, you should be able to see what it's really trying to tell you.
4360;One of the greatest movies of all time.
4361;The Matrix was a good movie but it was far from great.
4362;The Matrix storyline takes a backseat to the wow factor.
4363;"These revealing words spoken by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) touch just the very tip of the enormous iceberg that is ""The Matrix""."
4364;"Released in early 1999 without much fanfare, but with surprisingly high number of positive critical reviews, ""The Matrix"" became a science fiction and cinematic juggernaut not seen since the days of the original ""Star Wars""."
4365;bending story dealing with a fascinating take on reality.
4366;It also revolutionized the movie industry through its use of mind.
4367;generated, special effects including the now.
4368;"In the same manner by which George Lucas redefined the special effects industry with ""Star Wars"" in 1977, which created an influence which has been seen in countless movies in the quarter."
4369;A cranial connection into this elaborate computer system is what enables the machines to control the human mind.
4370;The leader of one of these rogue groups, Morpheus, believes he is destined to find 'The One', the individual who will be able fight the machines and defeat them.
4371;"Where this might seem perfunctory in other movies, in ""The Matrix"" it is amazing as each new path inspires a sense of awe in the viewer."
4372;In truth, it is a plot with such depth that this movie has developed an almost religious following among its fans and in.
4373;Each character has a defined purpose and each one fits perfectly into the overall story arc.
4374;"The Matrix also introduces the audience to one of the best cinematic villains to come along since Arnold Schwarzenneger's Terminator and ""Star Wars"" Darth Vader."
4375;Seemingly indestructable and definitely unpredictable, Agent Smith provokes the greatest fear among the brave band who do battle inside the Matrix.
4376;"the beauty of ""The Matrix"" is that it is still as strong four years later as it was when it was first released."
4377;The phenomenal success of this film led the Wachowskis to create trilogy out of this story.
4378;"It has the power and potential to be as strong a remembered as fondly as the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy."
4379;"To be able to be there at the beginning of such an amazing story now lets me understand how audiences felt in 1977 when they saw ""Star Wars"" for the first time."
4380;doesn't change the fact that this movie is one of the best sci fi movies ever made, though!
4381;my estimation of this film goes up and up as I watch it again and again.
4382;One member of one trinity is actually named Trinity.
4383;i also admire the interlocking faith each member of the Neo trinity had in each other.
4384;Each one believed in and rescued the other.
4385;Very subtle and powerful writing.
4386;The everyday world is experienced by you every day.
4387;a man is told the matrix has you.
4388;He discovers the truth about what has been happening his whole life.
4389;He has been in the matrix all along!
4390;He enters the real world and finds out the time is closer to 2199 than 1999.
4391;The special effects are amazing when he jump into an agents body and bursts out!
4392;A woman is told the man you love will be the one .
4393;in the sequels I would love to see time.
4394;it is a great movie with an exciting and unique story.
4395;Sure, the Matrix has incredibly well.
4396;done spfx, cool editing, astounding stunts, and guys wearing shades, but what makes this so great is that the makers of this movie actually put in a few ideas to go along with images.
4397;fi (in literature and film) always makes you think, makes you wonder.
4398;The Matrix is hands down the best sci.
4399;The most overrated film of the year.
4400;Neat underlying themes: There is a difference between knowing the path, and walking the path .
4401;Great religious undertones and faith exploration.
4402;Great action and awesome special effects.
4403;Pokes at our natural curiousity for the truth.
4404;Perhaps the best and easily most fun film of the year.
4405;the martial art scenes are the most innovative to come out since the Bruce Lee movies from the 70s.
4406;the sets are impressive, the special effects mind.
4407;a must see for all fans of the following genres.
4408;hugo Weaving as Agent Smith is superb.
4409;in fact the casting is top notch all the way.
4410;i think that's what gives this film an intense feeling, in which you are totally lost in the story.
4411;an amazing movie really, repeat viewings a must, as it's hard to take in, in just one sitting.
4412;Though I believe that this film was a bit hyped for more than it truly is, it is still one of the best sci.
4413;fiction fan, this movie gave me the perfect balance between the two.
4414;I was amazed at the well.
4415;thought out plot, and I compliment the Wachowski brothers for their excellent work.
4416;I've seen my fair share of action movies and science fiction movies, and this one could be split into two.
4417;and each would still be great.
4418;It's got an excellent soundtrack and simply some of the best special effects to date.
4419;Even if you've heard nothing about it, it's well worth it.
4420;"The best thing about this film is it's look
I:8405;4421;great story, tense action, super.
I:8405;4422;cool villian (thank you Hugo Weaving!)
I:8405;4423;Although the Special Effects and action sequences are great, they are very little compared to the films great script and acting.
I:8405;4424;The best performance in it comes from the comic relief provied my Mouse(matt doran.
I:8405;4425;fi films I have seen that is enjoyed by non.
I:8405;4426;is breathtaking, and I kept wondering to myself, """"How did they do that."""""""
4427;The fight scenes are quite something.
4428;Keanu Reeves acquits himself convincingly but Laurence Fishburne excels.
4429;It is a whole original, in fact the most original plot to be put out by a major picture studio in years.
4430;The cinematography in this film is exceptional, Lawrence Fishborne's voice is more striking than that of Darth Vadar, to those who say its confusing, go back to school.
4431;Oh yeah and make sure to turn the lights way down and the volume way up, its better that way.
4432;I have seen it about 4 times nowand it gets better each time.
4433;This story is so cool, that even Jennifer Tilly could have pulled it off.
4434;I bought this expecting great things from the sound.
4435;If you are a Christian who likes movies then you'll like this one.
4436;Neo meaning New, like we who are Christians are made new when we die to ourselves.
4437;go watch it and discover it for yourself.
4438;If you haven't seen this movie, be prepared for the best sci.
4439;One viewing will leave you with your hair blown back.
4440;Then when you dig into multiple viewings, trying to find errors and inconsistencies, you realize that the Wachowski brothers have put the care and thought into a movie that YOU, the true sci.
4441;"
I:8405;4442;The lighting, camera angles, and special effects combination is like the perfect spice that you just can't put words to, but just want to eat again and again.
I:8405;4443;If they can do this consistently, movie fans can rejoice for years to come.
I:8405;4444;Forget the usual Hollywood cheese, the Wachowski brothers have created a true classic.
I:8405;4445;fiction fan, you will love this movie.
I:8405;4446;The most attractive part of the movie is that it's a flick that makes you think.
I:8405;4447;You'll have to see the movie to know what I'm talking about but it has a theme that anyone who loved philosophy in college will enjoy.
I:8405;4448;(The ending making of the movie short clips are fascinating film.
I:8405;4449;it is one of the greatest Sci.
I:8405;4450;The story makes many powerful suggestions and really leaves you feeling like you could be The One.
I:8405;4451;Everyone does a great job, and the special effects and fight scenes are amazing!
I:8405;4452;These two things are some of what made the greatest movie of the millenium, the Matrix.
I:8405;4453;Everything about it was perfect, the story was amazing, Keanu Reeves easily put on his best performance to date, and the action/kung.
I:8405;4454;the Matrix will be looked one of the greatest movie achievements ever.
I:8405;4455;Even Fishburn, who's capable of great depth and charisma, appears one.
I:8405;4456;The movie is worth seeing however, as the concept and the effects are unique and highly watchable.
I:8405;4457;It's hard to fully summarise this masterpiece of a movie.
I:8405;4458;This ground breaking movie is the second from the Wachowski brothers, manga inspired, it covers a subject touched on before in such films as the Terminator, and many Japanese manga titles, a bleak and post apocalyptic future, where humanity in enslaved by machines.
I:8405;4459;This movie puts a new twist on this genre, in that it suggests that the world around us may not be real, What is real?
I:8405;4460;All movie fans can enjoy this title, my brother (non sci.
I:8405;4461;fi fan) and all my friends love this movie and watch it time and time again.
I:8405;4462;This movie is simply one of the best I've ever seen, going straight on my otherwise very select list of movies receiving a perfect 10 of 10 on the IMDB/Amazon scale.
I:8405;4463;The Matrix, a blend of complex sci.
I:8405;4464;The best special effects I have ever seen since Jarassic Park.
I:8405;4465;This is the Christmas present that keeps on giving.
I:8405;4466;peoples minds hooked up to computer.
I:8405;4467;what is real ius un real.
I:8405;4468;The movie itself is the Matrix, a movie just good enough to help me forget those godawful sequels.
I:8405;4469;sage Morpheus is truly mesmeric, a kind of Kung Fu Obi Wan Kenobi sans light.
I:8405;4470;But hey, its not all bad news as the action scenes are eminently watchable, and any film that can succeed in making hacking/hackers look interesting must have something going for it.
I:8405;4471;I think the actors perform extremely well.
I:8405;4472;the soundtrack is awesome also .
I:8405;4473;it will appeal to classical and techno fans alike.
I:8405;4474;I finally got around to watching """"The Matrix"""" a couple of years after everyone else."""
4475;The notion of manufactured reality was its strong point.
4476;I must note that there are strong resemblances to a film which I'll bet few Matrix enthusiasts have ever watched.
4477;This film was created for me to love.
4478;arts, the two most important things I do in my life.
4479;fi level of The Matrix is very high, and it's nice to watch a film you can feel was made to meet the highest standarts.
4480;the acting is excellent, the special effects are amazing, the pace is fast, the overall experience is MINDBLOWING.
4481;First of all I would like to say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
4482;It was incredibly well done and very enjoyable.
4483;I was not happy with teh formatting chosen by WB but when I finally got it to play it was incredible.
4484;Some people are much more critical of movies than I. I go to a movie to be entertained.
4485;I like to watch a movie and perhaps escape from reality for a bit.
4486;"As far as entertainment goes ""Matrix"" is great!"
4487;I knew it before seing it.
4488;The theme is great, even if not totally original.
4489;The FX are nice, certainly impressive for addicted to the genre.
4490;I really was captured by the first minutes.
4491;This is a great movie, but in a unique way.
4492;If all you want is a sci.
4493;fi flick, you may not be overly impressed, but if you are the type to look more deeply at things you'll see there is a lot more to this movie than entertainment.
4494;This movie has the ability to impart valuable lessons that harmonize with ancient on modern themes.
4495;I waited until just now to watch these movies.
4496;fi treat has a bit of everything for everyone: philosophy, special effects, carrie ann moss for the gents an incredibly sexy keanu for all the lucky ladies out there.
4497;i'd recommend this to everyone :)
4498;The Matrix is a very good film.
4499;There is also a legend: one day a special man will come and he will destroy the Matrix.
4500;Neo has to fight against the Matrix to crack it.
4501;pOSITIVE ELEMENTSI like the film because the idea is very novel, there are lots of fantastic special effects, there is a good plot and the actors perform very well.
4502;If you want to undestand everything, you also have to see the sequel.
4503;I first saw the film with my family and was dazzled by the special effects and the unsual plot.
4504;I have watched it 10+ times and will watch it again and again.
4505;the story is fascinating and makes you think.
4506;the visual and sound effects are simply stunning.
4507;"choose the Follow The White Rabbit version of the film to see how the special effects were created and how ""bullet time"" was invented and put to the best use I have ever seen."
4508;The 10th anniversary of The Matrix is celebrated with this wonderful edition on blu.
4509;"It is a fitting tribute to have the film that solidified ""Bullet Time"" into the film vernacular is treated to this single, solo book edition."
4510;The package is fitting for the Matrix universe, the built in book is a nice addition, it is fairly easy to read without having to damage the packaging, it has some good stills from the film, filmographys of key players and some handy bits of trivia.
4511;"The inclusion of a digital copy is certainly a bonus for those who care about that sort of thing, especially as it is not advertised as a ""2."
4512;the meat of the package is of course the actual blu.
4513;Crisp clean image that really highlights the films cinematography.
4514;One could go on for a long time about how good the disc is and it's special features, but the bottom line is, if you like the film and you like blu.
4515;It is a treat and will do well in any collection.
4516;It was really fun seeing in again now that technology has changed.
4517;This is a great thriller which made me to see multiple times.
4518;It seems to a a film which actually occur, which made it even more exciting.
4519;One day he is sought out by the mysterious and beautiful Trinity (Carrie.
4520;The last hour of Matrix has intense non.
4521;stop action that will just keep your mouth hanging open, your eyes glued to the screen.
4522;This is the ultimate action/science fiction movie I've ever seen.
4523;And not to mention that the acting is fantastic with Reeves, Fishburne, and Moss.
4524;It's also not only that it's a good movie to watch, it's a good movie in which you watch while thinking.
4525;Matrix has a plot with twists and turns, surprises, and action.
4526;after reading all this I'm hoping you feel that you really want to see it.
4527;This has the makings of a truly great movie, that's why it is!
4528;legimate criticism are there, of course, but those criticisms are easily transcends by good pace, great action, and an intriguing premise that can easily become more pretentious if your not careful.
4529;Whatever it is, it's still science fiction to me, with a very cool premise that of course, in real life, would probalby never happen.
4530;I think it's pretty safe to say our world is the ideal world to use us.
4531;If you don't let the Matrix become too pretentious in your eyes, you'll have a blast, and will enjoy this movie greatly.
4532;"It's parallel world itself is interesting, a ""what if"" kind of question (well, okay, some unpretentious, interesting philosphy is on display in this movie) It's true that the Matrix can be pretentious if you try to tout it as some kind of deep meaning akin to religion, but I think I've made my point across that."
4533;Probably the best thing about the Matrix is the action and art direction.
4534;The Matrix's dystopian future is portrayed with a cyber techno thriller, and the Matrix is fully visioned.
4535;"slamming visuals"" also thrive in this world, it's use of green, cyber text ( The Matrix Digital Rain) at the beggining is an example of the many cyber, still cool special effects."
4536;The sound itself is equally crafted well, with those irrerestible sound effects for every action.
4537;indeed, this movie was still a surprise, and I definitely am glad I own it.
4538;As a result, I definitely will see it more than once, and will make sure to continue the story by watching the sequals.
4539;Great story, breaking special effects, great music, and great acting make this movie a pure movie gem!
4540;ann Moss, Joe Pantoliano, and Hugo Weaving bring a great story to breathtaking heights!
4541;I think that the movie was great!
4542;He was so sexy I wanted to rip him off the screen.
4543;This movie is the best I have seen in a long time and I do not know anyone who thought it was a bad movie.
4544;Especially the special effects were the best.
4545;I recommend this movie to anyone.
4546;The Matrix still stands as possibly the best sci fi movie of all time.
4547;But if you look at it impartially, on its own it was one helluva movie.
4548;the final movie, Revolutions, was extremely entertaining however.
4549;It still holds its own.
4550;The special effects still wow me, and Neo's journey of self discovery is still exciting.
4551;punk movie that deals with the rapid evolution of technology and its horrific consequences.
4552;the Matrix is an ingeniously crafted film with ground.
4553;breaking special effects and an absorbing storyline.
4554;Despite the inevitable violence and occaisional language that define today's box office hits, The Matrix is a great movie.
4555;The well written script, highly allegorical story line, and excellent cinematography offer the viewer a rich experience during the movie and much to think about afterwards.
4556;faceted, and bears seeing more than once to appreciate the full effect.
4557;The OSCAR award winning soundtrack,thunders and rocks my surround set.
4558;on unit,I'm using with my 5.1 reciever), the rear center speaker is very active,as are all the rest of the speakers for that matter,for this action packed thriller!
4559;Sometimes there's a bit too much shooting,but the very clever story more than makes up for this slight short comming!
4560;Besides,some of the bullet special effects are ultra cool!
4561;This movie will make your stereo or surround system jump and it sounds even better if you have EX in your system.
4562;The Matrix sounds even better using EX,as do most 5.1 soundtracks I've played thru it!
4563;Wow is it a fine movie and the presentation is X. tra WOW!
4564;This is a great movie to watch!!
4565;Good acting by keanu, carrie.
4566;This film has to be one of the all.
4567;anne Moss was gorgeous as Reeves' romantic love interest whilst Fishburne's Morpheous was just excellent, even haunting at times, when he floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee with his outrageous one liners.
4568;reeves, however, I feel, has redeemed himself.
4569;The definitive view of the future, this is the best sci.
4570;This and Blade Runner and top of the heap in my book!
4571;The movie was good and a fun review of philosophy.
4572;Of the thousands of movies I have seen, I would put this in the top 20.
4573;Science Fiction is a story which can be accomplished without the assist of 'magic'.
4574;interfaces today that could very well be the forerunner of things to come in this area.
4575;the film has a lil bit for everyone and is handled quite well.
4576;The special effect, a necessary component in any movie it seems now.
4577;a. days are well done and add to the overall impact of the movie.
4578;the interesting premise of this movie, is that the 'reality' that we take for granted each day.
4579;the sight, the touch, the smell, the taste, what we hear.
4580;Watching the movie provides the diversion we are looking for.
4581;Everybody has to love this movie.
4582;The *real* real world is a post.
4583;Zion , one of many annoyingly heavy.
4584;symbolic references in the film.
4585;For those love movies with paper.
4586;thin characterisation and an excess of undisciplined imagination it will be seen as a great film .
4587;The impact this film has speaks volumes about the times we live in .
4588;With such cool internet names as Neo, Cypher and Trinity they are distinguished by their just as cool black leather threads.
4589;Indeed, the real star of this film may be fight choreographer 'Yuen Wo Ping' who did great work with 'Fist of Legend'.
4590;An overdirected piece of Hong Kong flash.
4591;It had great special effects and the storyline was great!
4592;It's mind boggling and since I love computers this movie was the best.
4593;I'll be the first one in line.
4594;It's pretty neat to watch how they created all those amazing scenes.
4595;get it today, and you won't regret it!
4596;If you enjoy an intelligent, multi.
4597;layered plot that is absolutely non.
4598;If you delight in meticulous detail and some of the coolest special effects ever created for celluloid, you are going to love this movie.
4599;If you like a story so complex you enjoy it even more on the second and third viewing because of more content you were able to extrapolate, you are going to love this movie.
4600;And if you love to watch smart characters doing logical things while interacting with cogent dialog, you will love this movie.
4601;My attention span must have improved since then, for now I see a fantastic movie, all the way through.
4602;The idea that the human is ultimately the better.
4603;if nothing else, we have one powerful metaphor for the way things really work , which is at a variety of levels and a variety of motivations.
4604;first of all, the movie is an exceptional feat of special effects, and boasts the most incredible and mesmerizing action sequence I have ever seen in any movie (starting with the infamous lobby scene, which is cool, if not vital to the plot).
4605;For the special effects alone you should see this movie.
4606;If you are a science fiction fan, the subtle nuances will appeal to you.
4607;up flick, but if you look closely, there are actually a lot of references to religion, nihilism, and the Bible.
4608;fiction genre is its unusual premise that we are all living in a dream world controlled by sentient machines.
4609;This provides for some thought.
4610;now I must warn those who haven't seen the movie that the action you expect doesn't come until almost half of the film has passed, but when it does, it is well worth the wait.
4611;The first 45 minutes of the movie familiarizes the audience with the Matrix and introduces the main characters, and there are a couple of strange scenes that will weird out some people (or both).
4612;The transitions between menus are fantastic and look good, and there are so many special features that it took me no less than an hour to look at them all.
4613;Action, story, great acting and thoughtful.
4614;The price I was able to get it at made it even better!
4615;I highly recommend this movie!
4616;Keanu Reeves really got me hooked on the story.
4617;He is perfect as the software techie/hacker who moves from virtual reality to reality (they say).

4619;Near the end of the movie, Keanu gets into some real power positions that are highly attractive.
4620;he knows how the world should be, how it deserves to be, and everywhere he turns, he is faced with the fact that there is something wrong with his world.
4621;in order to conquer this world, he has to start to believe he can.
4622;During this fight for what he believes is right, the special effects really capture your attention.
4623;It was not only intellectually fulfilling, but there is a ton of suspense.
4624;fi fan (I'm not either one) to enjoy it.
4625;It's original and I'd recomend it to 15+.
4626;Ah neo, what a great sci fi ride you are.
4627;Amazing cinematography and funky futuristic worlds.
4628;the special effects are great.
4629;It steals from many comic books, and may receive a lawsuit for that soon, but it's a greatly entertaining film, I can't wait for the sequels, to see Keanu, the superhero fly.
4630;have done better work in the past.
4631;winning SFX the flick was no more satisfying than a video game.
4632;One of the most spectacular and visually interesting sci.

4634;This movie would be a great gift alongside Dark City for those with sci.
4635;believable, emotional story, or great acting, or even great concept.
4636;I rate this monster special FX film a 5 because of such great directoral features.
4637;These two brothers were able to come up with some of the coolest, hardest, most intense action scenes ever in a movie.
4638;Some of the shots and moves are so unique that one has to wonder how two people could cooperate enough to come up with this.
4639;If you like neato action and beautiful women in leather, this is definitely your movie.
4640;than go elsewhere, but give this masterpiece of movie making techniques a chance first!
4641;The Wachowski Brothers themselves said it themselves, it is their own version of an allusion to one of the first, possibly most important book written in western culture.
4642;It was a big philosophical book, an allegory to human life.
4643;and so he turns around and finds a huge flame, and behind it he sees stairs leading to the outside world.
4644;He goes up the steps and is astounded as he finds the outside world, and has tries to tell everyone else.
4645;All this coming from a 14 year old kid, you should be ashamed of yourselves.
4646;:PI think that the plot of this story is extremely well thought.
4647;The Matrix is stylized and philosophical.
4648;It also moves very well and has good dialog.
4649;There is an overall emotional depth I really appreciated.
4650;Other than that, it's very well done.

4652;see, as the boys were silent and open.
4653;i think this movie works best on you the first time you see it and is great when just taken as a fun movie experience.
4654;I've seen movies that stayed with me longer, had much more compelling story lines and had more substance.
4655;but when seeing it the first time, the Matrix is just cool.
4656;By far one of the best films i've ever seen and definately my favourite movie of all time!
4657;Thank you Larry Andy for creating a phenomenal movie with a truly enlightening story line thank you to Lawrence, Keanue, Joe, Hugo especially Carrie.
4658;anne for breathing life into your characters!

4660;see again cyberthriller written and directed by the Wachowski brothers.
4661;"In 1977, George Lucas changed the landscape of cinematic Science Fiction forever with ""Star Wars,"" taking the genre light years ahead of all that preceded it."
4662;"Reeves is perfectly cast as Neo, the enigmatic young man who may or may not be ""The One,"" and it's one of the best roles of his career."
4663;He conveys a sense of removed, distracted urgency that defines his character, infusing him with both a strength and vulnerability that coalesces as the story progresses into determination and confidence.
4664;The underplayed, subtle character development (largely unacknowledged and under appreciated) is a nice piece of work by Reeves.
4665;"As Morpheus, Fishburne is dynamic
I:8405;4666;You understand his resolution completely by his countenance alone"
4667;It's a memorable performance by one of the truly gifted actors of our times.

4672;"art
I:8405;4673;This is Science Fiction at it's best, but beyond that, it's a great movie that transcends genre or category"
4674;Enhanced by a driving soundtrack that completes the package, highlighted by incredible action,outstanding performances and memorable scenes to numerous to mention, this is a movie that absolutely must not be missed.
4675;The cosmic battle the ability for evil to change its idenity at will is part of real life as well.
4676;Although not a religious movie, it is in a class far above the Ten Commandments, Jesus of Nazareth, King of Kings genre.
4677;The Matrix was an enormously popular film.
4678;While it would seem to be a rather monochromatic, brooding, recycled work of science fiction, its popularity will lie in its extraordinary visual effects, and a theme which resonated strongly with a generation.
4679;"There is a difference between ""knowing"" and ""walking"" the path, explains Trinity ."
4680;Does he truly possess new possibilities?
4681;The first time I just watched the movie for its special effects and its amazing action sequences.
4682;I think Keeanu Reeves says it best: Whoa!
4683;The visuals do a good job of distracting you from how lame, one.
4684;inspired the story really is.
4685;If a sequel is made, let's hope it's more consistant and thoughtful than this one.
4686;great movie, great special effects, Trinity is hot in the matrix and the whole concept is cool, that the machines could take us over and turn us into batteries wihtout us even knowing.
4687;Which is pretty much what our government has done to us nowdays, slaves to the machine.
4688;incredible action and sound, not to mention a pretty good story line and direction.
4689;The special effects were most excellent but it's the story, the idea that we are and become what we believe, that really hits home.
4690;"It's a great adventure that's worth watching more than once 
I:8405;4691;I give it 4 stars for the visual effects only.
I:8405;4692;This is just such a cool movie.
I:8405;4693;I watched it twice all the way through.
I:8405;4694;It works great on PCs too.
I:8405;4695;Loved it so much I converted to The Matrix look
I:8405;4696;This first Matrix film is just fantastic.
I:8405;4697;Its a great a action packed science fiction, but it is also a reflection of our (and really about every nations) society in which we accept things that are true that might not be (for example particle physics says the universe is an electric simulation, eel its a stretch but I digress).
I:8405;4698;While I had problems with parts of this film's message, my ranking is based on its effectiveness as an action.
I:8405;4699;packed marvel of surreal computer generated special effects.
I:8405;4700;It was refreshing to see some of these issues raised in a major motion picture (even if they were dressed up in some fantastic trappings) and on a superficial level, the film had a great sense of style.
I:8405;4701;lastly, according to this movie, the best way to subvert the dominant paradigm is through superior firepower and fisticuffs.
I:8405;4702;I can certainly enjoy watching movie characters display their skill with guns (Chow Yung Fat inThe Replacement Killers) or martial arts (Jackie Chan inanything), but the excessive amount of blood spilled by the heroes reminded me of African.
I:8405;4703;If the movie intrigues you, you might enjoy a much more sophisticated story about a band of radical freedom fighters battling the powers of conformity and control.
I:8405;4704;Many of the elements of The Matrix bare a striking similarity to The Invisibles, a comic book series written by Grant Morrison and published by the Vertigo line of DC Comics (although The Invisibles has frequent scenes of graphic violence even more intense and disturbing than The Matrix, it also does something that no action film ever does"
4705;for both the killers and the friends and family of their victims.
4706;This has to be one of the most exciting and brilliant sci.
4707;It starts out fast, the action taking you for a ride, and it slows down just enough when Morpheus(Fishburne) first begins to explain to Neo(Reeves) about what the Matrix is and how it works.
4708;This movie was put together very well, and the martial arts scenes showed a lot of time and effort was put into them.
4709;This film has to be the best that I've seen in a LONG time!
4710;The special effects are wild and spectacular and the storyline is superb.
4711;I thorougly recommend it to all those who are willing to let go of 'reality' for a while and submerge themselves in this thoroughly unique entertainment experience.
4712;Not good organize but is still a charm in this one.
4713;time do the spectacular special effects serve their real purpose.
4714;Still, stopping bullets in mid.
4715;dimensional treatment of this motif you could imagine.
4716;"But by now every geek on the planet has grown to ""love"" this movie and embrace it like an anthem for a new generation."
4717;How about maybe SOME suspense worthy of a genuine story?
4718;The commentaries are great enlightening.
4719;The Matrix is the best movie of 1999, it's incredbile sense of Cyber Punk with a mixture of sci.
4720;fi action delivers absolute awe with each passing sequence.
4721;The Matrix is the best film of 1999, hands down.
4722;The fact that no one knows about the evil that surrounds us, that we eat, drink and breath it.
4723;And that the good is hidden in another dimension, another time.
4724;And the fact that the two brothers who made this film make sure we see some of the hottest effects ever recorded during the process is only a credit to them.
4725;We go to the movies to be entertained, and sometimes to be helped to think a bit.
4726;If you want serious thought provoking stuff, read a book or a manual or go watch a documentary.
4727;This was well crafted moviemaking.
4728;This film was absolutly a thrill ride!
4729;With an original plot, the film takes you into a whole new dimention.
4730;This film is a sci.
4731;Great special effects and a great story make this film one of a kind!
4732;This was without a doubt one of the best movies ever!
4733;I have watched it so many times, and it's a phenomenal movie!
4734;The plot is the best, and the fight scenes and special effects are amazing!
4735;One of the best movies I've ever seeen in my life.
4736;Keanu and carry did amazing performances .
4737;If you haven't seen this movie, please run .
4738;See how actors, directors visual effects made a great work.
4739;The movie is worth to watch after after.
4740;Everytime you watch you cacth up another thing.
4741;Its worth to watch .
4742;Its worth to put in your collection.
4743;The story line is very well thought out it dosen't leave anything out for us to try to piece together as far as the computers role in how they harvest humans like crops.
4744;This is definately an energizer that keeps going and going.
4745;This is one awesome movie.
4746;I really love this movie.
4747;Great concept and great innovation in the process of shooting the film from a technical perspective.
4748;i just want the original.
4749;I never saw this movie until I bought it as a gift.
4750;He loved the movie and so did I!
4751;I honestly had no idea what people were talking about when they mentioned the bullet.
4752;But because it has entered into the popular culture as such an influential reference, it's stayed on my mind.
4753;The ideas behind the film are intriguing, and I did finally figure out what bullet.
4754;Because of all this, when it popped up on a movie channel a couple of nights ago, I decided to give it another go.
4755;"filled ""I love you"" scene so the audience gets any clue there's a romantic subplot at all."
4756;A better film could have easily inspired the same amount of discussion.
4757;The MATRIX synthesizes works classical, biblical, and contemporary into a whole that is much more than the sum of its parts.
4758;It is derivative of many works, both cinematic and literary, including a theme from Terminator and Colossus, the Forbin Project, with a twist on the Star Trek holodeck, thrown together with Blade Runner, the Bible, several works of Shakespeare, William Gibson's cyberpunk style, Nietzsche, Buddha, Star Wars, Men In Black, and, visually and and with a hint of humor, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.
4759;Excellent gunfights, high tech slamming, and kick boxing.
4760;but the Matrix justifies the bucks.
4761;it is the most dazzling nearly black and white film ever made.
4762;I am not a Reeves fan but this is by far his best work.
4763;SciFi has been lacking somewhat here lately but the concept and originality of this movie make it a welcome addition.
4764;Fishburn is outstanding, the rest of the cast are good but the special affects make the difference.
4765;When I saw this film some while back, I was pleasantly surprised.
4766;In this film he is the reluctant hero, which he played very well.
4767;Overall I was very pleased with Keanu's performance and I look forward to him coming out with some other good films.
4768;Otherwise, the acting was superb from Fishbourne and others.
4769;It's well thought out, intriguing, timely, original, and is not the least bit porous.
4770;They actually invented new technology to meet the needs of filming.
4771;lastly, I called this film the Star Wars of our generation.
4772;Like Star Wars , The Matrix wowed us with new technology and a complex storyline that makes you believe that these characters and their world are real.
4773;It will be a classic twenty years from now.
4774;This is a great movie based upon the power of belief in one's self.
4775;THe action it heart pounding and the movie is awesome!!!!
4776;the acting is exellent, combined with a really good dialoug, just makes this movie better in every way.
4777;"If you don
I:8405;4778;It is a movie that draws you in, not just with its mind.
I:8405;4779;boggling special effects, but also with its underlying story.
I:8405;4780;The story is so neatly woven into it all, and the whole film is so fast.
I:8405;4781;i'm a relatively smart moviegoer, but I did not totally get all the details in the entire movie myself, the first few times around.
I:8405;4782;I loved it the very first time I saw it, and I knew that it was a great, groundbreaking film.
I:8405;4783;Fortunately, this movie works on so many levels, that it can even be enjoyed on the level of a high.
I:8405;4784;But everytime I have seen it since, it adds something new to my understanding of the incredible world of THE MATRIX.
I:8405;4785;This is the mark of a GREAT FILM: One that makes you want to come back for more, even when you don't understand everything in it, and gives you something new every single time you see it.
I:8405;4786;plus many great ones that you WOULDN'T expect.
I:8405;4787;scenes documentary HBO First Look: Making the Matrix, you get the incredible feature Take the red pills to view two hidden special effects documentaries: What is Bullet Time?
I:8405;4788;which delves much more into what the special effects are and how they are accomplished.
I:8405;4789;Plus, there is the feature that allows you to see the film and, at certain points, a white rabbit pops up on the lower right.
I:8405;4790;anne Moss, editor Zach Staenberg and visual effects supervisor John Gaeta is also very cool.
I:8405;4791;This movie is a timeless classic that can and should be viewed over and over.
I:8405;4792;It communicates many profound and thought.
I:8405;4793;An epic struggle for freedom.
I:8405;4794;choice and free will are constantly highlighted in the Matrix trilogy.
I:8405;4795;can the machines grow like humans and return to the Garden of Eden?The following essays are the best interpretations I've seen on the Matrix trilogy:[.]
I:8405;4796;You'll love it, any sci.
I:8405;4797;when I was younger and more creative!
I:8405;4798;You'll be making a lot of people happy!
I:8405;4799;I keep watching this movie .
I:8405;4800;The story line is very clever and there are echoes of many devices used in some great literary classics, (Lewis Carrol fans should love it).
I:8405;4801;thousands will tell you the same thing over and over that this is the greatest movie yet made for mixes special effects to better the action instead of vise versa.
I:8405;4802;it is as good as people say it is.
I:8405;4803;some of the greatest fights anywhere.
I:8405;4804;This movie has the best of every action packed sci.
I:8405;4805;Great plot, great effects, great actors, and great directing!
I:8405;4806;Certainly sets the bar higher for all sci.
I:8405;4807;The actors are fantastic with an unusual storyline how can you go wrong.
I:8405;4808;Fast paced with some twist and turns placed here and there to keep the edge of the seat thrills coming, So the goodies are still at it and they are trying to save mankind from the .
I:8405;4809;I rated this an A grade plus for the remarkable way this turns out with brilliant ideas that you could never guess.
I:8405;4810;Now it's time for the popcorn and movie so you can sit and relax with your feet up, to a fabulous night in with plenty of entertainment from the first Matrix saga.
I:8405;4811;I love the special effects!
I:8405;4812;And it is also capitalizes on the theory of mind over matter.
I:8405;4813;All These movies are good at least in my opinion.
I:8405;4814;I look for movies that have meanings behind them and all three definitely has a message.
I:8405;4815;If not, you can always see it again and have a great time.
I:8405;4816;This is one of the best science fiction movies ever made.
I:8405;4817;This movie really keeps you thinking and guessing all the way through.
I:8405;4818;The visual effects are stunning.
I:8405;4819;See it on as big a screen as you can with the biggest sound system.
I:8405;4820;It is great at yanking the rug out from under you of what you think is real.
I:8405;4821;Dawn good movie best I've seen in year
I:8405;4822;An example of the first would be Star ship troopers.
I:8405;4823;Where amazing special effects are used to portray amazing ideas.
I:8405;4824;The combination of ground breaking special effects, with an intelligent plot, a pinch of Japanese Animation spirit, and martial artestry second to none, makes this I dare say the best Scifi/action movie since Aliens.
I:8405;4825;This movie was truly great.
I:8405;4826;I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end.
I:8405;4827;The visual effects were unparalleled and the action was breathtaking.
I:8405;4828;The Matrix is one of the most important films ever made.
I:8405;4829;I love this movie, and its message.
I:8405;4830;I highly recommend it to all thinking people who have felt the splinter in the mind.
I:8405;4831;I won't deny it: I enjoyed the Matrix.
I:8405;4832;It's got great special effects, quick pacing, and a compelling story.
I:8405;4833;the special effects are great, the action is quick.
I:8405;4834;paced, and the story is fun to follow, but that's about as deep as this movie gets.
I:8405;4835;the Hong Kong the music and slowmo action were perfectly blended as smooth as silk.
I:8405;4836;I loved the characters and everybody lookin' cool in blackleather.
I:8405;4837;This movie had a lot of twists turns that kept you on edge of your seat and aching for more.
I:8405;4838;This movie is a must see for any one who loves science fiction and action.
I:8405;4839;Can be viewed many times, which is saying something in itself.
I:8405;4840;It's an interesting flick with a thoughtful premise .
I:8405;4841;it is a movie that makes you think and I did enjoy much of it.
I:8405;4842;And one of those good old philosophers (maybe Kant?)
I:8405;4843;i found this movie kind of so.
I:8405;4844;i really really enjoyed watching it again .
I:8405;4845;good basic sci fi with great special effects
I:8405;4846;Move over Phantom Menace and George Lucas cause The Matrix totally destroyed Star Wars 1.
I:8405;4847;under there power to keep us under control for energy.
I:8405;4848;this is an eye popping visually stunning wild ride.
I:8405;4849;all in all The Matrix is a technical marval and a truly entertaining film it's a ride buckel up cause this one sky rockets.
I:8405;4850;so in closing i give this movie a generous 3 stars because i did enjoy it even though i thought it only deserved two stars
I:8405;4851;Finally Keanu Reeves has found the perfect role: his Neo is a human blank slate who goes through a harrowing transformation while discovering the horrific secrets of The Matrix.
I:8405;4852;cool movie astounds you at every turn, and its dizzying pop.
I:8405;4853;psychology and wildly fantastic premise is actually thought.
I:8405;4854;Like all good rides, it moves like lightning, so you better pay attention"
4855;winning special effects require at least a second viewing.
4856;"Four stars instead of five for one reason: for all its slickness and entertaining thrills, the characters in this movie do not illicit the kind of pathos they might have with just a bit more personal history and interaction
I:8405;4857;cool Carrie Moss as Neo's potential babe, just a bit more stylized romance a la The Terminator would have made given this movie more emotional resonance, though as it stands it is a science fiction classic for the ages.
I:8405;4858;The franchise was very popular.
I:8405;4859;I loved everything about this film and cannot fault it.
I:8405;4860;The Wachowski brother have raised the bar for this genre taking the best of east and west film techniques and given us a taste of the future.
I:8405;4861;this is how it should be done!
I:8405;4862;I just bought this movie and hoped the hype was worth it.
I:8405;4863;There are better movies out there, but this one is worth watching once to form your own opinion.
I:8405;4864;My favorite part of this film was the camera work.
I:8405;4865;Overall, I've always liked this idea for a movie.
I:8405;4866;Watch them with an open mind and you might find that you'll enjoy them more.
I:8405;4867;fiction films, the delivery of this concept in """"The Matrix"""" is solid."""
4868;Visually, this film gives you little chance to rest before something even more stunning appears, which is a credit to all those involved.
4869;"despite being two years old), cementing ""The Matrix"" as one of the truly great action films of our time."
4870;who is destined to save the human race, bring balance to the Force, etc.
4871;Instead of coming up with interesting and exciting ways for two people to fight each other in virtual reality, Neo and Co. whip out their guns and start shooting.
4872;As purely entertainment The Matrix is pretty excellent but to provoke any kind of thought process it doesn't make much sense.
4873;For entertainment value there is a pretty great antagonistic cat and mouse battle between Neo and Agent Smith, a virus in The Matrix out to kill Neo and steal the mainframe access code from Morpheus for the last human city outside of the clutches of The Matrix.
4874;Watch out for the I love you so you can now wake from the dead Neo and Trinity moment.
4875;The great thing about it is that it is not just eye.
4876;Sure, maybe it is a complicated movie, but please pay attention.
4877;One fine day, I decided to have a break from my usual routine.
4878;Hearing good things about the city, curiosity immensely grew from my head.
4879;And I told myself, I've got to see that place as soon as possible.
4880;As we walk down the stairs of the plane, I felt the excitement with the air passing through my skin.
4881;"Gasping some breath, ""this is it!"""
4882;of walking, at last, I got a glimpse of the mall.
4883;The food was great, ambience is good and the best thing, all in a reasonable price.
4884;With all those plastic bags of goods I bought, I took a taxi ride back to the hotel.
4885;Great lights, I told myself.
4886;It was beautifully structured, with those life.
4887;And I enjoyed my night in that resto bar, what a night!At around 9 a. m., my cell phone rang and it was my boss!
4888;He was asking me to report that day because of some important matters.
4889;I packed my things and hopped to a cab.
4890;The friggin' acting is well, pretty darn bad.
4891;The set design was sweet and the overall look of the movie definitely portrayed the Wachowski Bros. stark vision of a post.
4892;The Matrix is entertaining, granted.
4893;If you want to see the directors not dumbing themselves down for the masses check out Bound for a great noir thriller with some HOT girl on girl action between Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon.
4894;An awesome mix of Computers and good ol down home old fashioned acting.
4895;This copy looks fantastic on blu.
4896;ray!I got this new for $15 at walmart.
4897;Here are my top ten reasons why this movie is so unbelievably perfect:1.
4898;The movie makes you believe that the human race today could actually exist as a matrix.2.
4899;The fight scenes are magnificently impressive that they make you quiver.3.
4900;The actors all fit their parts perfectly.4.
4901;Neo, a man who lives in a dreamworld, is pulled out of his original setting to see the truth.
4902;He has an ultimate belief that Neo is the one that can save the rest of the human race.6.
4903;The picture's directing is extremely well done.7.
4904;Humans prevail upon their own creations.
4905;it's sooooooooo inspiring that two sequels are spawning from it, and each one still has Keanu Reeves(great actor)!
4906;The Matrix is in a class of it's own with sound and visual technology that is on the cutting edge.
4907;I love it when writers, producers, and directors dare to go outside the box and make a film that is unlike anything we have ever seen.
4908;This is such a good movie.
4909;It is almost hard to review because there is little to say about it, it is just good.
4910;All in all the movie is unlike anything that has ever been on celluloid.
4911;One of the better films of 1999.
4912;I just saw the Matrix recently for the first time, and I loved it.
4913;But the Matrix is still very entertaining, fun to watch, and it did make me think.
4914;the opening scene is great.
4915;Sure, maybe he's a dolt, but he did a decent job in the Matrix (and he's hot!)
4916;One of my favorite scenes is .
4917;"Morpheus kicks derriere (literally)
I:8405;4918;the film gets violenter as it goes, going from a more thoughtful sci.
I:8405;4919;fi film to a nice and violent action movie.
I:8405;4920;neo's cute, Morpheus is cool, Trinity rocks, Agent Smith is my favorite character aside from spoon.
I:8405;4921;well, I can understand his point.
I:8405;4922;all in all, wonderful movie.
I:8405;4923;it's worth the price of admission.
I:8405;4924;life points, The Matrix is THE Best Film Of 1999!
I:8405;4925;If there was any justice in the world The Matrix should have won Best Picture of 1999!
I:8405;4926;This is by far one of best movies that Keanu Reeves has ever made.
I:8405;4927;The special effects is awesome!!!!!
I:8405;4928;I love the kung foo and the action scenes.
I:8405;4929;It had a really great story line.
I:8405;4930;Then he meets Morpheus who tells him that the world that he knows is actually a dream world made by evil machines who years ago took over the world and enslaved human beings.
I:8405;4931;If there is any movie worth seeing the Matrix is one of them.
I:8405;4932;This is a very good Sci.
I:8405;4933;He is the leader of a crew that goes up agenst the odds in the real world and the vurtual world.
I:8405;4934;Altho he's doinf quite good, his crew keeps on dying to agents, in the computer world.
I:8405;4935;One of the key qualities the movie owns is a storyline which is not only unique and original but captures the imagination of the audience.
I:8405;4936;fi film of 2001 but is worth a watch
I:8405;4937;fi fan, and I always thought that other sci.
I:8405;4938;No question as to why this motion picture won as many technical Oscars as it did.
I:8405;4939;This is a picture to which you MUST pay attention to understand.
I:8405;4940;The Matrix is one of those pictures that sort of raises the bar for others of its genre.
I:8405;4941;I understand a sequel is in the works, and I believe I won't wait for it to come out on home video this time.
I:8405;4942;The Matrix is one of those films that will have you intrigued from start to finish.
I:8405;4943;Along with action packed mind blowing sequences it offers a mysterious and intersting storyline that is very gripping.
I:8405;4944;The only problem with the Matrix is that the story line can be hard to understand at first, but give it another watch it's well worth understanding.
I:8405;4945;I have watched this movie several times since it's first release, and each time watching it is like the first time.
I:8405;4946;What truth?That The Matrix"""" is a brilliant film."""
4947;The Matrix is that dream world.
4948;It really does make for great viewing.
4949;but what stands out the most are the amazing special effects.
4950;The explosions, the camera effects as the camera zooms through computer screens, allowing us to see inside the screen, it's all amazing.
4951;another dimension to the film is the score, by Don Davis.
4952;It is great by itself but adds mood and mysteriousness to the movie.
4953;Also, the soundtrack is great, from Rage Against The Machine (The end of the film where Neo hangs up the phone) to the Propellerheads (The shoot.
4954;so the film is breathtaking, but it doesn't stop there.
4955;If anything, it appeals more to younger people.
4956;It is a film that gets better every time you watch it, and you will need to watch it again to notice everything in the film.
4957;Nice to have immediately and now on the cloud for life.
4958;This movie is great, period.
4959;The story is very original for a movie.
4960;Though this movie can get old after watching it a few times the meaning of this movie makes up for it.
4961;In the visually tantalizing movie, The Matrix , a breed of AI computers takes over the world.
4962;It harvests human embryos in laboratories called fields .
4963;This new machine species derives its energy needs from the electricity produced by the billions of human bodies thus preserved.
4964;Ensconced in their shells, they see themselves walking, talking, working and making love.
4965;This is a tangible and olfactory phantasm masterfully created by the Matrix.
4966;Its computing power is mind boggling.
4967;It generates the minutest details and reams of data in a spectacularly successful effort to maintain the illusion.
4968;a group of human miscreants succeeds to learn the secret of the Matrix.
4969;Is it better to live happily in a perfectly detailed delusion .
4970;I must say that this movie has good graphics.
4971;The action was the best part of the movie.
4972;even though it's not got a good story, I give it three stars.
4973;This is one of the best sci fi movies you will ever see.
4974;The sets and wardrobe combine to create a sort.
4975;The soundtrack is very well matched to the action/feel of the film.
4976;but it is very smoothly done).
4977;Fishburn is awesome as Morpheus and really carries a lot of the plot development.
4978;ish in places but has really come a long way from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure .
4979;If you are looking to have your mind blown by an incredible story with fatastic effects, see this.
4980;If you are looking for a masterpiece of the cinematographer's art.
4981;mojo digital magic their new goodies can provide!
4982;At first the storyline confused me and made me question the meaning behind the movie and I am not a Reeves fan so to actually enjoy one of his films is quite rare.
4983;"This movie for anyone who hasn't seen it
I:8405;4984;If you're not into the storyline aspects of a movie"
4985;But the special effects are outstanding.
4986;But this movie is one of a kind.
4987;"Very good movie
I:8405;4988;Would highly recommend to anyone of all ages"
4989;okay, the movie is truly amazing with its' special effects and actors ~ and story line.
4990;The story line is extremely thought provoking, made me think about choices in life, our destiny, .
4991;he delivers an outstanding performance and you truly believe that he IS Neo.
4992;"it is so believable and for a brief moment in your life, you are in the ""matrix""."
4993;I'm not a big fan of The Matrix, but I can still respect it.
4994;The acting by all is good and the special effects are excellent.
4995;The Matrix is not a classic, but it no doubt is still quite cool.
4996;Every time you watch, you'll find something you missed and you'll think more and more about the human race.
4997;It was great to watch over and over even though it was for a class.
4998;This is a great video to watch for a business class or leadership class.
4999;It goes far beyond gunfights and the latest Hollywood special affects.
5000;There is really something to grasp and hold on to in THE MATRIX far after the movie has ended.
5001;I can honestly say that subsequent viewings are almost as good as the initial one.
5002;I've always liked the movie.
5003;It's a modern classic with heavy doses of subtext if you know how to read it.
5004;The first Matrix is the best!
5005;If you haven't seen it and you're a sci.
5006;fi/anime fan, you're going to love it!
5007;Great action sequences, cast well, great photography, highly recommended.
5008;Fast paced action, phenomenal visuals, superb photography, great soundtrack, weird weird plot, and some pretty good acting.
5009;But even Keanu does quite well, along with the rest of the cast.
5010;The visual effects are positively stunning, and synchronized with great sound.
5011;a. tete with Morpheus was quite interesting.
5012;That one aspect of this movie alone with worth the price!
5013;This is the best movie I've ever seen.
5014;The special effects are incredible.
5015;acting of Keanu Reeves: and you have a good comedy with great visual effects.
5016;The plot alone is outstanding, but the movie is also done very well.
5017;I love movies with a twist, and this has a great one.
5018;This movie is famous for the special effects, they have been copied a million times since, but they are still good.
5019;a computer wiz is leading a double life, He has his normal day job, and is a computer hacker by night.
5020;He thinks he is one of the best but because of his insight into the world of computers, he finds there is some kind of conspericy happening, bigger than anyone knows.
5021;I'm sure you'll love it too!
5022;The Follow the White Rabbit feature is the most endearing part of the film.
5023;Open your mind and imagine what if the world we live in today is a dream, a silk.
5024;Great movies make you think and the Matrix is one that really twists your mind.
5025;It is a great film dont get me wrong.
5026;This movie is a great way to show off your home theatre equipment.
5027;"By day, he is a computer programmer, working for a faceless corporation, by night he sells illegal ""narcotic"" software, living in a concealed world while searching for something more."
5028;this is one of the most stylized films I have ever seen.
5029;It is at once dark, sleek, paranoid, lavish, lush and abysmal.
5030;The world that is created in this film is so completely convincing, that moviegoers will be mesmerized by its epic style of storytelling and subtle blending of reality with the computer generated fantasy that Neo, Morphius and Trinity move through, while fighting to gain supremacy over the machines.
5031;the story itself is a common theme.
5032;Technology gains the upper hand on humanity and takes control.
5033;art cameras, the special film effects are incredible.
5034;As she fights for her freedom, she raises into the air, and as though frozen in time, the camera moves impossibly around her.
5035;great Graphics nothing to complain about here.
5036;Hands down, The Matrix is the greatest science fiction movie of all time.
5037;This is an exciting film with superb action sequences.
5038;The martial arts in this movie are absolutely explosive!
5039;"I must reiterate that this film is ""the"" empitome of a classic science fiction thriller."
5040;It takes our fantasy to a higher level with pure ecstasy as its climax.
5041;The Matrix is no doubt one of the best movies of it's time, with in your face action and awsome special effects you could and will want to watch it over and over again.
5042;anyway lets talk about the acting.
5043;Keanu Reeves { Neo}, acually did a great job.
5044;So I really believe he deserves more credit then what fans and critics have given him.
5045;anyway where was I, Lawrence Fishbourrne, he was great in the part of Morph.
5046;He was very confident, in a good way, but he was also able to put lots of emotion into the easily dense part of the captain .
5047;She was beautiful, strong, kick ass, emotional, simply wonderful.
5048;By the way, if you liked her in this you should definatly check her out in Memento, which is my second favorite movie behind this.
5049;The matrix is the best sci.
5050;The graphics, visual effects, plot, and epic dialouge.
5051;All of it is superb.
5052;on and it never really leaves you with a definite answer.
5053;It makes you really think about everything that you have ever seen or done in your life and it leaves you with so many moral and philosophical questions.
5054;They see people in funny black costumes flying around doing kung.
5055;They don't ever see how deep and philosophical the films (or the characters) truly are.
5056;"i appreciate the Matrix and the Matrix sequels because they truly are the ""thinking."
5057;The Matrix is easily my favorite movie of all times.
5058;I can use it as a metaphor to discuss religion, politics, education, and so on.
5059;This film illustrates the fact that the greatest majority of our population will never know.
5060;in, day out world is real.
5061;powerful machines of artificial intelligence that control us.
5062;This movie really makes you think.
5063;Keanu Reeves is awesome in this movie, and I loved the guy with the monotone voice.
5064;The movie is one of my favorites, the special effects are out of this world and I can't wait to see something else from the people who made this movie.
5065;A fantastic premise degenerates into a impossibly crazed shoot em up.
5066;i found it a fun movie that almost touched on some poingant theories about human existance, but then decided it wanted to be about blowing stuff up.
5067;i will say that the fight coreography is up there with Ping's best work in Hong Kong.
5068;I totally love this movie.
5069;It's one of the greatest movies ever made.
5070;The Matrix is a profound movie with loads of symbolism that speak to the soul.
5071;You will see many philosophical and religious tenets and Jungian archetypes in this movie.
5072;The Matrix is pure fluff with some style.
5073;This movie is plain fun.
5074;Lawrence Fishburne, who is always great, comes through again.
5075;This one is worth owning, just to watch the fight sequences at will.
5076;Great effects, great action, great acting, great cast,great EVERYTHING.
5077;fi moveis who hide behind special effects, this acompanied with amazing effects also has a thrilling and edge of your seat story line.
5078;If you're going to watch only one movie this millennium please make it the Matrix.
5079;It was a great movie, although there was some minor inconsistencies.
5080;Special effects were great, and Keanu could not screw up this movie if he tried!
5081;The Warchowski BrothersStupendous special effects and placing Keanu Reeves in the right place at the right time save this film from its insubstantial biblical plot.
5082;the action is skillfully maneuvered and shot with groundbreaking use of film technology.
5083;keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss perform fantastically in exhilarating interpretations of martial arts and the sentient matrix is horrific on an extraterrestrial scale.
5084;as an action film The Matrix is scintillating to say the least, it's definitely one of the most surprising and visual masterpieces made to date.
5085;It truly is a one of a kind film for the sci.
5086;This disc is full of special features including intriguing features including, behind the scenes making, visual effects, Directors' commentary and many more.
5087;The picture is just as clear as ever with this remaster and the sound is so crisp, I was able to hear every gunshot in crisp detail during the famous lobby shootout.
5088;All these scenes pop and it feels so good to see a classic given the proper BR treatment and for the right price.
5089;fi, film or just anyone who is a fan of this film.
5090;Required viewing for the 20th century.
5091;the movie was a spectacular way of using computers and kun.
5092;I liked it the first time when it was called Star Wars, or Alice and Wonderland, or even THE BIBLE.
5093;There are plenty of spiritual connotations here about rebirth, seeing things for what they really are, etc.
5094;headlights performance worked well for his character.
5095;No matter how many times you watch it, you will still get new insights from this great movie.
5096;I really like the actors that they put into this movie.
5097;Undeniably one of the best films of its time, The Matrix delivers a great storyline, action, a little romance, and deep meaning.
5098;A classic tale of man versus machine with a twist is married with the ever more classic story of a savior for the human race, which always gives hope, hope for the characters, and hope to the audience.
5099;This film,in my opionion,is one of the greatest movies ever made!The visuals effects were great at the time of this films' release and they still hold up well today.
5100;also,unlike the sequels,this film makes sense!
5101;All in all,a great film!
5102;Good I got this for my all time collection.
5103;Best part is I got the free digital copy for my ipod is a Thanksgiving offer from Amazon.
5104;It has an intellectually stimulating plot, great acting, the graphix are awesome and so are the special effects.
5105;You have the unlikely hero, the wise and powerful mentor, the love interest, the traitor, the enemy and millions of unsuspecting victims all encompassed in something vaugely referred to as the matrix .
5106;As we watch Neo travel on his cathartic journey to the center of the matrix it is easy to get caught up in the story with him.
5107;It leaves you really thinking in the end.
5108;The martial arts are beautiful, the guns are beautiful, and all the action sequences leave you breathless.
5109;Loved it, love it, and will always love it!
5110;This movie kept you on your toes, the special effects in this movie were out of this world.
5111;I have to say that this is the best movie of Keanu Reeves career
5112;This is a very cool movie, but not necessarily something I would want to see too many times.
5113;It really adds to the life of the movie.
5114;top film, top effects, top banana
5115;is the exceptional sound design.
5116;Understandibly, everyone is captivated by the visual effects and the conceptual genius of this movie, but The Matrix has one of the finest sound designs I have ever experienced in a film.
5117;Instead of constantly overwhealming the viewer/listener with sheer quantity of sounds and loudness, the designers have created a highly refined, artistic soundscape that becomes a character in the film.
5118;They pick and choose the important sonic elements we need to hear in order to completely involve us moment.
5119;The sonic perspective changes constantly.
5120;whichever perspective best emotionally supports the story.
5121;The film is mixed very well.
5122;with a wonderfully dimensional soundstage, great dynamics, clean and clear dialogue and fantastic panning effects.
5123;"I love the moments when we ""break through"" various video display devices to enter a scene."
5124;I also enjoy the imaginative solutions that answer the question of what something not yet invented might sound like.
5125;It is obvious a lot of care, thought and artistry went into the sound design, and that a rare synergy of all creative elements was achieved.
5126;Sound effects work hand in hand with visuals, dialogue and music to create a totally emmersive experience.
5127;which includes several making of documentaries as well as commentary on the music and special effects .
5128;If you are a music buff like me, the commentaries on the score are especially cool.
5129;"Best of is the ""white rabbit"" setting, which allows you to view some behind the scene footage in the context of the movie."
5130;All of the extras are outstanding .
5131;this is the ultimate sci.
5132;to all of us who always read books in this genre and waited for just the right movie to show around and do just what we read in there .
5133;It was really great and I loved the special effects.
5134;I saw this in the theater with a friend of mine.
5135;This film totally surpassed my wildest expectations and hopes for an incredible visual, intellectual and thrilling experience.
5136;this movie has the most incredible special effects you've ever seen.
5137;but special effects are absolutely worthless without a story to back them up and actors that are convincing enough to make the effects believable.
5138;It is easily watchable over and over again.
5139;The cast/crew commentary is enlightening and the behind.
5140;you click when you see it and you get to see how the special effects were created in the exact scene you're watching.
5141;it is a great concept and story.
5142;A new dimention to the action.
5143;This film combines amazing film techniques with an unusual and philosophical plot.
5144;An deserves a lot more than an oscar for them.
5145;The story line is detailed in the Amazon blurb,though those reviews seem a little too starry eyed.
5146;"There are some vertigo inspiring skyscraper shots of the city,which seems to be Chicago, though the landscape here changes a bit perhaps to represent other cityscapes where the ""robots"" roam antlike thruout."
5147;for about 20 minutes of special effects, it may be worth seeing.
5148;"Anyway, several cuts above ""American Beauty"", the Academy Award winner of that dismal year in motion pictures."
5149;"underrated ""Tron"" from the early 1980's, a similar story without the ""punk"" look, more interesting effects,and no cheap gratuitous violence."
5150;One of the reasons given for the war against the agents and their matrix, is the survival of Zion .
5151;definitely not worth fighting for.
5152;An interesting film with dazzling special effects, though.
5153;Great show with all the special effects, being a science fiction fan this movie is a keeper, had it a long time ago and gave it away to someone and missed watching it so I bought it again.
5154;I received the item in execellent condition and before the date due.
5155;Thank you for your excellent cumstomer service!
5156;A small band of rebels, lead by the enigmatic Morpheous, cross back and forth between the real world and virtual reality in search of the one who will help them understand the secret of the Matrix and finally free humanity.
5157;the Matrix takes a very original premise and executes it brilliantly.
5158;It manages to maintain a fairly complex plot while interleaving great action sequences and some fantastic special effects.
5159;There are strong performances by Laurence Fishburn (Morpheous) and Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith), who contribute heavily to the film.
5160;basically he dresses up in cool trendy clothes and looks good.
5161;while some of the techniques used in the film are not new to either Hollywood (see Blade) or any of the Hong Kong actions films, a great many new types of effects were created for the film.
5162;The visual effects and overall look of the film are incredibly well designed.
5163;When using the white rabbit option, you can jump in and out of the movie to see how particular sequences were filmed.
5164;will and, therefore, can live in freedom in spiritual sense.
5165;The Matrix is a must see movie for many reasons.
5166;Keanu Reeves outdoes himself in this one, as does Laurence Fishburne.
5167;Her portrayal of Trinity was both strong and vulnerable at the same time.
5168;The brothers have done it again.
5169;Watching some parts of the movie I found myself holding my breath or gripping the arm rests!
5170;I'm actually going to see the movie for the 10th time this evening and I'm looking forward to it as much as I did the 1st time.
5171;I promise that you won't be disappointed.
5172;And the movie is still packing people in on the weekends.
5173;It is very good and Iwas suprised the movie technikal.
5174;fi/action flicks I love, this is definitely one of them.
5175;"On a more literary note, it was interesting that Neo, our main character, plays a ""messiah"" type of role and discovers that it is up to him to save the world from the artificial intelligence that enslaves humankind."
5176;"Morpheus plays a sort of ""father"" figure to Neo, and the third member of the ""godhead"" is Trinity, who becomes Neo's love interest."
5177;this is the best movie ever made!
5178;it is an excellant movie and i reccomed it to everyone!
5179;The Matrix is an awesome movie.
5180;It is soo good that I saw it in the theatre at least 4 times.
5181;There is good eye candy for all plus an intriguing plot that makes you have to watch it more than once.
5182;Every time you watch you will find a new thing in the Matrix.
5183;Great movie, especially for the sci.
5184;Love the story and of course the special effects.
5185;Only in widescreen, which is cool, but it's a very tight ratio.
5186;Amazing special effects, decent character development.
5187;This is a very stunning movie, that is worth seeing simply for the sake of it.
5188;It is one of a kind, a thought provoking original that will impress all with its intricate, well developed plot.
5189;In the pursuit of creating a concept of fate (as opposed to our lives being one big controlled experiment by our own creations .
5190;:)), a seemingly ordinary hacker with some extraordinary powers goes on a quest to reclaim humanity.
5191;Keanu plays one of his better roles, Laurence is absolutely marvelous as Morpheus and Carrie.
5192;ann gives the impression that she reallly is in the movie business to stay.
5193;Best action pysc flick out there no question.
5194;This movie is filled with it!
5195;Great special effects, great acting, great movie!
5196;ann Moss on a sensational performance!
5197;The Matrix is a one of a kind action film which takes the viewer into a sort of alternate reality, while painting the real world as a fictitious computer program.
5198;The characters take martial arts and gunfighting to a whole new level with their computer enhanced powers.
5199;All of this adds up to an adventure like no other.
5200;It is one of, if not the best film in its class.
5201;"This movie is pretty much a classic
I:8405;5202;fi Thriller and it's fun.
I:8405;5203;com and it made it all the way to Hanoi.
I:8405;5204;Excellent premise, delivery effects !
I:8405;5205;As for the movie, special effect, sound and cinematographic are great, but, the mood of the movie is rather un.
I:8405;5206;the main plot of the movie is very good and interesting.
I:8405;5207;The Matrix is one of the more important movies of the last 10 years.
I:8405;5208;Its story is compelling and it is exciting to watch.
I:8405;5209;I just bought it on Blu.
I:8405;5210;My friends said it was an excellent movie.
I:8405;5211;I'm in high school, and they thought it was great.
I:8405;5212;i loved the special effects though.
I:8405;5213;I found myself rewinding the action packed scenes for a second go.
I:8405;5214;That is because the special effects were wonderful and the other actors and actresses have a fair amount of talent.
I:8405;5215;the matrix is one of the best movies of all time.
I:8405;5216;the special effects in this movie are top notch.
I:8405;5217;this film is a nonstop action packed powerhouse of a film.
I:8405;5218;Watched it again, more stunning.
I:8405;5219;Trinity and Morpheus are great.
I:8405;5220;Seeing how it was put together and how the bullet time effects were done was fascinating.
I:8405;5221;I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
I:8405;5222;fi aspect may repel some viewers, they should still watch it, just for some scenes, (all bullet time scenes and the lobby scene.)
I:8405;5223;Finally, Hollywood comes out with a movie that has great actors, awesome plot, suspense out the wazoo, and the most incredible special effects.
I:8405;5224;Matrix is what humanity is real in life are going through right now.
I:8405;5225;This movie is a monumental achievement in visual effects.
I:8405;5226;Despite the wierd plot and development, this movie still makes for an exciting visual roller coater ride.
I:8405;5227;Excellent movie with Reeves and Jackson.
I:8405;5228;A thinking man's thriller especially for those who are into computers.
I:8405;5229;This is one of those movies that are a must own .
I:8405;5230;For many, """"The Matrix"""" is great special effects and great science fiction, which it undoubtedly is, and undoubtedly one of the best of the genre, but it is much more than that."""
5231;the Matrix is a spot.
5232;The Matrix is a created artificial reality that is so well.
5233;done that actual reality is completely concealed.
5234;the Matrix is a milestone in moviemaking, special effects, fantastic action sequences, and use of an intelligent and imaginative science fiction plot to convey a message.
5235;breaking movie created by the talented Wachowski brothers.
5236;These two brothers share, along with their creative collaboration, a love of sci.
5237;fi, comic books and kung fu movies.
5238;"The plot of the movie is existential
I:8405;5239;Resistance fighters who are aware of this domination by the machines fight back by entering the simulated world and deconstructing it.
I:8405;5240;The world is constructed by thought.
I:8405;5241;lawrence Fishburne brings a mysterious and sexy paternalism to his portrayal of Morpheus, the leader of the resistance.
I:8405;5242;Keanu Reaves does an outstanding job as Neo the computer geek turned freedom fighter.
I:8405;5243;There is an excellent supporting cast.
I:8405;5244;the Wachowski brothers brought in the master Wu Ping, who had created martial artist action sequences for many Hong King martial arts films.
I:8405;5245;This kind of perfectionist artistic vision is what has created the masterpiece that is the Matrix, which I believe is one of the best movies of the 1990's.
I:8405;5246;This is a movie packed with action, suspense, special effects, and a great storyline that basically hasn't been told before.
I:8405;5247;Plus it has a spiritual undertone which makes it a movie I can recommend to my Chrisitian friends.
I:8405;5248;What is really happening in the spiritual realm is scary.
I:8405;5249;the development of Neo's (the lead character who basically plays the Savior ) abilities and skills mimic the development of faith in our lives and our ability to see the spiritual and not the physical.
I:8405;5250;By building his faith, he was eventually able to takes his eyes off what he was seeing and see behind it.
I:8405;5251;challenge yourself to see something deeper than just a great technical presentation of special effects in a suspenseful thrilling science fiction film and you will enjoy another dimension that will keep you coming back to watch this film again and again.
I:8405;5252;Maybe you will even be able to challenge yourself and be able to take the RED pill and become a spiritually aware person, realizing your need for the truth that comes from only one place.
I:8405;5253;A classic science fiction movie, I think.
I:8405;5254;Existential as well as very imaginative.
I:8405;5255;It does manage to put forth some good ideas, unusual for Hollywood, but many of these ideas have already been explored in the aforementioned sci.
I:8405;5256;This and simplicity are the key to using great special effects in a film.
I:8405;5257;The Matrix has a good concept going but ultimately drops it in favor of gunfights, explosions and action, which is fine if you're 12 and that's what you're looking for.
I:8405;5258;This movie has entered contemporary culture and is likely to remain.
I:8405;5259;It has classic elements of action, adventure, romance, with the over.
I:8405;5260;It works on *so* many levels.
I:8405;5261;Awesome special effects, but this film is only nice for newbies in SF and teenagers.
I:8405;5262;respecting Science Fiction reader simply CAN'T take this film seriously.
I:8405;5263;The extra features are a great added value.
I:8405;5264;In my opinion this is a movie everyone needs to see.
I:8405;5265;Even if you do not like sci fi, you could enjoy the specail effects and creative story.
I:8405;5266;I have to list this as one of the best sci fi movies ever made.
I:8405;5267;The special effeccts were great too, they made you think dodging bullets could really happen.
I:8405;5268;If you are looking for a great movie with incredible special effects, this is the movie to own.
I:8405;5269;Oh yeah, and that helicopter scene was neat to!
I:8405;5270;This action and violence packed movie will keep you guessing until the end!
I:8405;5271;The whole SHABANG is great: the actors, the plot, the action, but mostly the special effects!
I:8405;5272;The plot is delivered to you in such a conceiveable manner, that you will find yourself feeling the back of your head!
I:8405;5273;(watch the movie and you will understand) This is a MUST SEE!
I:8405;5274;If you're the type of person who'd want excitement, then """"The Matrix"""" is the one for you."""
5275;It's got action, adventure, and heart.
5276;this thriller, as well as its sequals, tell one story: a futuristic world controlled by artificial intelligence, all depending on humans beings as their power source.
5277;ann Moss) Morpheus is able to free Neo from the Matrix.
5278;The Matrix is a combination of karate, action, and sci.
5279;"This movie's depiction of the futuristic ""real world"" (our world) was both stunning and disturbing."
5280;Its action scenes were are wonderous to behold.
5281;The way Neo dodges bullets is a memorable scene.
5282;Its storyline is very catchy and interesting!
5283;Dodging bullets, running really fast, jumping really high, and doing impossible things?
5284;This movie is a sci.
5285;Acting was good and the casting was very good, but the special effects is the main reason to watch the movie.
5286;The best effects I've ever seen
5287;Watch this movie, it's the best Sci fi since Starwars
5288;it's more like the movie that popularized a special style or extreme action and eye candy styled special effects.
5289;I believe there are a number of good Chinese action films that actually started that trend many years ago.
5290;Aside from this formula The Matrix is a good movie and creative story overall.
5291;Throughout the entire movie you are waiting for it to happen, and it's kind of a let down waiting for him figure it out.
5292;"Of course once you get past the ""how"" Neo kicks major booty for the very short period left in the movie the action aspect is well worth it."
5293;they picked a really good cast for this.
5294;Both of them put a lot of style and attitude in their characters.
5295;The best thing about The Matrix is the action scenes.
5296;It's action sequences are on high.
5297;The way they meld great choreography and special effects is a wonder to behold.
5298;Better CG animation had been done before that movie.
5299;That's a good thing, mind you.
5300;If you thought the movie was beautiful before wait until you see it now.
5301;On top of that you get Dolby Digital 5.1 in French, Italian and Portuguese along with Dolby Digital two channel Spanish.
5302;What you do get above all that is the following:In Movie Experience .
5303;I think this replaces the red pill and gives you picture in picture documentary content.
5304;There's MoreFollow the White Rabbit .
5305;ray release is definitely the best offering to date, which is nice considering a lot of movies had a sad initial release with no special features.
5306;The Matrix is definitely a fun movie to watch.
5307;It makes a world of difference and is very cool.
5308;Matrix 2 and 3 are pretty lame, but the first was innovative and technologically fascinating.
5309;as it moves along, but if you stick with it, The Matrix is a lot of fun.
5310;Then there is the mind blowing back story: it's all an illusion perpetrated by machines!
5311;If you like movies like Memento, Pan's Labyrinth, or Stay you'll find a lot to enjoy here.
5312;It's a great movie that reaches deep within the human psyche and deals with what could easily be considered one of today's biggest fears.
5313;I was very impressed by Keanu Reeves in the role of Neo.
5314;he has come a long way from his Bill and Ted days, and can play any part with flair and panache.
5315;anne Moss was good as Trinity, and Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus was dazzling.
5316;I also loved Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith, the psycho nutjob who does everything he can to destroy Morpheus and Company.
5317;the best part about this movie is that it blends the action and storytelling so well, unlike most action films these days, which tend to be all action and no plot.
5318;The Matrix has a good, well thought.
5319;out plot that fits in quite nicely around the action scenes and makes the movie very enjoyable.
5320;all in all, a wonderful film.
5321;"but then, I've been a big Keanu Reeves fan almost since the beginning of his career
I:8405;5322;I remember being especially impressed with the opening sequence when I went to the theatre, and also really liking the gravity.
I:8405;5323;Trinity was great here, and all the characters.
I:8405;5324;Or is everything just a big fake?This movie did pick up this quite old idea and did bring it into a great movie with fantastic pictures!I loved it!
I:8405;5325;The Matrix was hailed as the best action thriller of the year, and I have to say I have never seen fight scenes like them, the only film that comes anywhere close is the excellent Blade.
I:8405;5326;A brilliant script, fantastic performances from the cast, and a good directing job have combined to make this film highly watchable to anybody.
I:8405;5327;This is him at his best and he is as good as any big name I've seen recently.
I:8405;5328;Laurence Fishburne plays the arcane and sinister Morpheus to a tee, his riddles will drive you insane after a while, but that is part of the film, and watching how the riddles solve themselves is highly enthralling.
I:8405;5329;ann Moss is good in her supporting role as Trinity, but in my opinion it's Hugo Weaver as Smith, the patronising agent who steals the show, he is the character you love to hate, but you can't help but like his character, he's so devious.
I:8405;5330;The Matrix is a brilliant film, it's plot however is highly complicated, and it helps to have someone to explain it to you, or at least watch it twice.
I:8405;5331;You may be tempted to give up due to the complexity of it all but be patient and trust me this film is more than worth perservering with, and even if you don't like it, just give it a try.
I:8405;5332;The the special effect it creates, the story, the characters, the acting of Keanu Reeves, all of these made this classic movie on top of myfavorite lists.
I:8405;5333;I will definitely put it into my collection and watch it again later.
I:8405;5334;Matrix has got to have the best special effects that i have ever seen.
I:8405;5335;The storyline is excellent from start to finish.
I:8405;5336;The cast was an excellent choice they all played their part well and geled together.
I:8405;5337;The special features are very interesting and in depth.
I:8405;5338;They explain how the movie was filmed and give other great insight about it.
I:8405;5339;This is a great gift for anybody remotely interested in Sci.
I:8405;5340;if you suspend disbelief and don't actively search for fault, a pretty entertaining piece of work that deserves the box office response it got.
I:8405;5341;visually stunning, with what I thought were pretty much seamless special affects, it did have it's moments of thought provocation.
I:8405;5342;A great example to show off the not haves or tapeheads' the way of the future.
I:8405;5343;A better than decent transfer, loads of extra material, and great behind the scenes footage, intellegently done, with the white rabbit and red pill options.
I:8405;5344;This is a movie that I could watch over and over again, and I have after I bought it.
I:8405;5345;At first I didn't really understand it, but before I was done watching it once, I loved it.
I:8405;5346;and so did the rest of my family and friends.
I:8405;5347;It puts your imagination to the test and afterwards really makes you think.
I:8405;5348;This review utilized a new Panasonic ZT 65 screen with a fairly esoteric home 7.1 surround system.
I:8405;5349;Very good contrast with a slightly desaturated color grading for backgrounds while skin tones are saturated up a touch.
I:8405;5350;A quick adjustment to my remote's volume control and all was and stayed well.
I:8405;5351;a commentary, trailers and previews.
I:8405;5352;while the Blu Ray is good and would be an improvement over the Standard Def version, do not expect any night and day differences as this film was, to my mind, simply re.
I:8405;5353;This movie is an example of how 2 brothers can come up with something so imaginative and creative and make it into one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:8405;5354;The Matrix is destined to join that pantheon of cult classic Sci.
I:8405;5355;But the environment created to tell the story is very deep.
I:8405;5356;The invigorating, twisted, and psychodelic plot streams it's way though dazzling and memsmorizing special effects.
I:8405;5357;The movie represents many parrallels, for kids (special effects) , average viewer, a (difficult inviting plot), and the analytic mind, (maybe a taste of something real).
I:8405;5358;Definitly a masterpice,as it combines special effects, brilliant wriitng, and anythign but simplicity, into a viewer's dream.
I:8405;5359;fi flicks right up there with Alien, Dune, Blade Runner.
I:8405;5360;The Matrix was the most unpredictable, awe.
I:8405;5361;seat movie I saw this year.
I:8405;5362;The movie started with an interesting idea and great promise.
I:8405;5363;body count movie that Hollywood loves to churn out these days.
I:8405;5364;making ( You're the One, Neo ) and classic story.
I:8405;5365;you know, acting and the like .
I:8405;5366;Keanu Reeves plays the only character he knows how (himself), which is fine, and the other actors/actresses all perform their roles efficiently.
I:8405;5367;BTW, the intensity of this movie means that young children and squeamish adults should stay away.
I:8405;5368;Every decade or so, a phenomenal science fiction film emerges that transcends the traditional Oh, but it's sci.
I:8405;5369;culture, and the internet have the solopstic scenario of The Matrix possible.
I:8405;5370;It's baseless to us .
I:8405;5371;structruralist ontology, and a visual poetry unlike anything seen before.
I:8405;5372;It's like Beethoven's passionate symphonies, Hegel's conquering Spirit, the final scenes of Faust.
I:8405;5373;I can't express how wonderful the film is .
I:8405;5374;perhaps the best part of The Matrix is that it gives voice to the underlying tensions of this era.
I:8405;5375;that the movie is phenomenal and should be bought goes without saying, that it is a powerful representation of our society must be acknowledged.
I:8405;5376;The matrix is one of the coolest movies I have ever seen.
I:8405;5377;The special efects are cool.
I:8405;5378;The fight between Neo and Morpheous was the best fighting seen.
I:8405;5379;This film is defently Keano Reeves best movie next to Speed.
I:8405;5380;A must see for people who are into technology and action.
I:8405;5381;I enjoyed this movie thoroughly from the get.
I:8405;5382;The storyline was interesting and the great acting performances from Fishburne and Keanu Reeves really helped to bolster this film.
I:8405;5383;That's the whole goal of the movie!
I:8405;5384;This movie does have great special effects, very good acting, and a storyline that pulls you in.
I:8405;5385;Since Blade Runner and the original Terminator, both early 1980's, nothing has come close to sparking the imagination like those two.
I:8405;5386;Nicely written and acted by all.
I:8405;5387;this blu ray was very well put together.
I:8405;5388;Let me tell you, this is probably the best movie I saw all year!
I:8405;5389;I go to the movies at least once every 2 weeks, so I have seen it all this year, and nothing can top this movie!
I:8405;5390;The other 2 good movies of the year were The Sixth Sense and Blair Witch but this, this is one of the coolest movies ever created.
I:8405;5391;Highly recommended to anyone who likes to experience something out of the ordinary!
I:8405;5392;I sat and watched this film after listening to all the hype about it and yep, it has got good special effects.
I:8405;5393;Andy and Larry, a pair of obviously talented film makers, have returned to theaters with The Matrix, a science fiction thriller that is every bit the match of their debut effort, Bound, for tension, excitement, and intelligence.
I:8405;5394;The movie is kinetic, atmospheric, visually stunning, and mind.
I:8405;5395;It toys with the boundaries between reality and fantasy in unique and interesting ways.
I:8405;5396;In its approach and content, it reminded me of last year's vastly underrated Dark City.
I:8405;5397;There's also a synergy with two movies due to be released within the next month: David Cronenberg's eXistenZ and Alejandro Amenabar's Open Your Eyes.
I:8405;5398;Neo is dissatisfied with his existence, and, while he's groping for a meaning to it, he is contacted by a mysterious computer presence known as Morpheus.
I:8405;5399;And so begins an amazing odyssey for both Neo and the audience.
I:8405;5400;The goal of the machines is to eliminate all free humans, and their most powerful weapons, the Sentient Agents (who look like Men in Black), are closing in.
I:8405;5401;The Wachowskis have carefully structured the story in such a way that the audience is capable of following the action and understanding what's going on even when all of the secrets have not been revealed.
I:8405;5402;Nevertheless, because The Matrix is intelligent, it will defeat those unwilling to invest some intellectual participation.
I:8405;5403;The payoff is worth the effort.
I:8405;5404;Both films are visually stunning, with images painstakingly constructed and action sequences choreographed to excite the eye and quicken the pulse.
I:8405;5405;The special effects, which are not as numerous as those in many science fiction pieces, are flawless.
I:8405;5406;His role as Neo fits the criteria.
I:8405;5407;It's easily his best work since Speed, where the same kinds of demands were made of him.
I:8405;5408;For more nuanced performances, the Wachowskis rely on the rest of the cast: the always excellent Laurence Fishburne, brilliant character actor Joe Pantoliano (who appeared in Bound), and Carrie.
I:8405;5409;anne Moss, who looks great in black leather.
I:8405;5410;Aussie Hugo Weaving (Proof) brings the perfect mix of dry wit and menace to his role as the head Man in Black.
I:8405;5411;hard science fiction fan will discover a plot that mixes and matches both new and old conventions of the genre in a compelling fashion.
I:8405;5412;As I stated earlier, the way in which the Wachowskis choose to resolve everything seems slightly contrived, but, in the overall scheme of things, that's a small price to pay for one of the most enjoyable science fiction thrillers to reach the screen in months.
I:8405;5413;Not only does it feature revolutionary special effects, but it has a complex storyline to boot.
I:8405;5414;Neo joins Morpheus and his crew, where he is showed the world as it truly is .
I:8405;5415;The purpose of Morpheus and his crew is to disrupt our imaginary dream world that the machines have created to keep us happy (the Matrix), and free our minds.
I:8405;5416;the special effects in _The Matrix_ are absolutely stunning.
I:8405;5417;The Wachowski Brothers and their crew have developed what they like to call bullet time.
I:8405;5418;An example of this is Neo's real name, Thomas Anderson.
I:8405;5419;Anderson, when translated, means son of man.
I:8405;5420;Neo also means new .
I:8405;5421;Neo Anderson, the new son of man.
I:8405;5422;She predicts a Second Coming of sorts, and tells Neo to find his path.
I:8405;5423;Morpheus is absolutely convinced that Neo is the One, the saviour for mankind (much like Christ).
I:8405;5424;what a wonderful surprise the matrix turned out to be.
I:8405;5425;Kind of sneaking in through the back door while everyone was waiting in 5 mile queues for the Phantom Menace and delivering arguably the finest sci.
I:8405;5426;The supporting cast work extremely well, especially Lawrence Fishburne who looks cooler than cool with his pair of little clip on shades and not forgetting relative newcomer Carrie Ann Moss, who plays the hard as nails trinity.
I:8405;5427;but the real stars of the show have to be the effects.
I:8405;5428;I just got my first Blu.
I:8405;5429;The first disc I played in it was this one.
I:8405;5430;The movie played fine, but it looks like the player couldn't read the menu.
I:8405;5431;I was never able to access it.
I:8405;5432;Hands down one of the most innovate and original movies to come along in a long time.
I:8405;5433;aided action and filming is incredible.
I:8405;5434;the best movie i have ever, ever seen.
I:8405;5435;The symbolism is terrific for those who are awake and not just looking at it as a Psy.
I:8405;5436;But The Matrix hit the spot.
I:8405;5437;This movie evokes thought as well as entertains.
I:8405;5438;How to you rate perfection.
I:8405;5439;I found the film so exciting and thought provoking I nearly disconnected myself!
I:8405;5440;It's a good thing this film is in absolutely no way a metaphor for our 'real' social, political, economic, media.
I:8405;5441;That said the effects were wonderful, the twists entertaining, the questions about the nature of reality intriguing, and the sound track intense.
I:8405;5442;I highly recommend this movie to ANY sci.
I:8405;5443;fi fan, or just anyone who wants something to think about.
I:8405;5444;thomas A. Anderson, an orchestrated computer programmer during the day, lives a dual life where he is known as Neo online through his late night computer hacking.
I:8405;5445;neo along with his arch rival Agent Smith, who is a machine within human form, counter each others personalities in a way that makes the distinction between man and machine that much greater.
I:8405;5446;adding to the distinction of the men controlled by the machines and the men aware of the society ran by the matrix, is the acting of Laurence Fishbourne.
I:8405;5447;His elevated presence and his subtle cues of knowing what is to come next lead to the greater disparity between himself and the people around him.
I:8405;5448;These details portrayed by the main actors lead to the best illustration of a thematic idea unprecedented in a movie up until today.
I:8405;5449;The originality of the futuristic film The Matrix questions the viewers perception of what is and isnt real while the actors used within the film support the direction that the film takes which ultimately leaves the viewers questioning and wanting to see more!
I:8405;5450;My family loves the Matrix Trilogy.
I:8405;5451;We love the creativity of the story.
I:8405;5452;The nature of pop cultures influence, the passage of time, and peoples notoriously short memory shows us that art, even well.
I:8405;5453;For the Brothers Wachowskis The Matrix, what their work is most famous for are intense, nail.
I:8405;5454;biting action that pays homage to the influential work of John Woo and other Hong Kong action cinema, and its groundbreaking, trendsetting special effects.
I:8405;5455;For one thing, The Matrix deals as heavily in philosophy and allusions to pop culture as it does in slick, sci.
I:8405;5456;vat thought experiment, the themes behind Alice in Wonderland, and many, many other complex ideas.
I:8405;5457;as for the action, which is the thing most casual film fans are familiar with in regard to the The Matrix, it is, quite frankly, outstanding.
I:8405;5458;The movie deals heavily in religious and philosophical themes, and I give ample credit to this as it is as important to the film as its other strengths, yet at the same time, The Matrix is an action film in its purest form.
I:8405;5459;The film takes its time getting to the action, letting the script build steam while it fleshes out the characters and the conflicts a perfect example of veteran pacing and good writing.
I:8405;5460;The shootouts and fistfights have such a fresh and original flavor, and are so well staged, that it becomes hard to watch a lot of other action films after seeing this.
I:8405;5461;It mixes the action and excitement of science fiction, Hong Kong flicks, spaghetti westerns, anime, and post.
I:8405;5462;apocalyptic worlds extremely well.The Matrix is so influential and frequently referenced in popular culture and (more importantly) is so well made that it HAS to be required viewing for fans of cinema not just the hardcore ones.
I:8405;5463;sCORE: 10/10+ The script not only paces the action very effectively, but it smartly focuses on the human element of its plot and utilizes a huge variety of philosophical and moral concepts to its advantage.
I:8405;5464;+ A modern day Hollywood homage to Hong Kong action cinema, this is as good as it gets.
I:8405;5465;Best end credits song selection ever, thats for sure.
I:8405;5466;The Matrix has the most spectacular special effects ever seen in a motion picture, the acting is flawless by both Reeves and Fishburne, it never gets boring, has a fantastic story line and plot and always keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:8405;5467;My favorite part is the helicopter scene.
I:8405;5468;If you've not seen it yet go check it out!
I:8405;5469;This is, without a doubt, one of the best movies to be released in 1999.
I:8405;5470;It's a visionary tale about mankind, that has superb tecnical values.
I:8405;5471;With outstanding special effects and great camera work all around.
I:8405;5472;The actors manage to give good performences, specially Laurence Fishburn.
I:8405;5473;It's pace keeps the spectator amazed every minute of it.
I:8405;5474;The best since Dark City.
I:8405;5475;The Matrix was a really great movie with amazing special effects.
I:8405;5476;a high tech action thriller involving all sorts of futuristic gadgets.
I:8405;5477;a must see for all those who love action movies.
I:8405;5478;terrific fight scenes (there are plenty of them) and an intriguing story.
I:8405;5479;Most of the casts for those types of series aren't always the best actors, but it makes the movie very unique and enjoyable.
I:8405;5480;The Matrix sriers is worth several viewings.
I:8405;5481;fi's of '99 go, The Matrix was the best.
I:8405;5482;Even the standard version has plenty of extras.
I:8405;5483;rOM and there is included features for that.
I:8405;5484;I hope other movies can follow this technology!
I:8405;5485;The plot is so thick, so well.
I:8405;5486;through (if that makes sense) it is probably the best science fiction story ever written.
I:8405;5487;This is one of the best sci.
I:8405;5488;fi/action films of recent times.
I:8405;5489;The outstanding performances of all those cast in the film is another plus.
I:8405;5490;Very much like Star Wars, all of the cast members are for the most part little known and so talented.
I:8405;5491;Best movie I have ever seen before, special effects are incredible.
I:8405;5492;the directing was great, at first, but after seeing the rotating camera shot for the 10th time i was quite fed up.
I:8405;5493;The matrix has got to be the action movie by which all future action sci.
I:8405;5494;fi movies will be judged well into the millenium
I:8405;5495;I will look for many more movies to collect in the future.
I:8405;5496;The movie was done completely for the special effects, the stop frame photograghy and computer effects.
I:8405;5497;A lot of credit goes to the special effects personal.
I:8405;5498;The plot is simple, and the story line keeps your attention long enough to get you to the next action or special effect sequence.
I:8405;5499;Its simple a movie to watch and enjoy the visual effects.
I:8405;5500;well written, well acted, well directed and clever.
I:8405;5501;It is my all time favorite movie with a great storyline, and awesome action scenes what more could you possibly want.
I:8405;5502;This is the kind of movie I could see over and over again.
I:8405;5503;I've already seen it 8 times!
I:8405;5504;The Matrix is the most exciting and original science fiction action adventure in years.
I:8405;5505;Ranking up there with classics like the two Terminators , Raiders of the Lost Ark , and the Star Wars Trilogy , The Matrix is an ambitious blend of sci.
I:8405;5506;fi themes and thrilling action.
I:8405;5507;From there his adventure begins as a mysterious figure played by Laurence Fishburne in top form, shows Neo what the world really is.
I:8405;5508;This is where much of the great action comes from.
I:8405;5509;Not only abundant but inventive and stylish as well, the action sequences are a major signature in this film and will be copied for years to come, and already have in such big films as Mission:Impossilbe II .
I:8405;5510;There is a hero who is conflicted with his two destinies and a post apocalyptic world ran by machines, sound familiar?
I:8405;5511;So The Matrix is really a promise of great things to come and seeing that two sequels are being planned we don't have too long to wait.
I:8405;5512;Marix is a new, fresh, out of this world movie, focusing on other things beside the endangerment of the earth which is so cliche, this is the begining of greater Sci.
I:8405;5513;fi movies to come and will open the future of dark humor sci fi's and crazy cool action sequences, this movie has it all, Great actors, one of the most greatest storylines in the world, and my favorite, action.
I:8405;5514;If you haven't watched this yet, now is your chance to own the trilogy and you'll witness true hollywood, ture action, fresh sci fi and out of this world storyline.
I:8405;5515;I had high expectations for this movie!
I:8405;5516;Everybody kept saying that it is the best movie of all time.
I:8405;5517;This is a movie that makes you question the existance of everything around you.
I:8405;5518;Exciting all the way to the end.
I:8405;5519;I thought this movie is a visual feast I'll never forget.
I:8405;5520;The action, the plot, and the dream.
I:8405;5521;The visual effects were excellent, and the imagination also ran free about living in a world that is not what you thought.
I:8405;5522;In the film the Matrix, there is an amazing amount of parallels between this film and the story of Jesus in the Bible.
I:8405;5523;The final one is right at the end of the movie, when Neo flies up into the air.
I:8405;5524;This is similar to JEsus' ascension into Heaven, and the beginning of the new way of life for Christians.
I:8405;5525;The special effects and the plot was pretty good.
I:8405;5526;If you want to see a clever, action.
I:8405;5527;packed and truly witty sci.
I:8405;5528;The action is barely solid.
I:8405;5529;It seems to be aimed at the core audience of cybernerds and computer geeks, upon which it has numerous enthusiastic fanatics.
I:8405;5530;neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker who is plagued by thoughts of the indecipherability of the real world and the dream world.
I:8405;5531;utilizing slow motion in a dance of magical cinematography, scenes which would otherwise be exceptional are transformed into pure genius.
I:8405;5532;gun bullets kicking out of a mounted Gatling gun so hard and fast that they fall like metal rain, is only one example of stylized action that is truly beyond unique.
I:8405;5533;fiction action and a good old.
I:8405;5534;oriented acting and character development is outstanding, and drives the film with sincerity and determination.
I:8405;5535;The sinister Agent Smith, played by Hugo Weaving, is immortalized as one of the greatest screen villains and manages to be cool and collected in a disconcerting manner, and startlingly malevolent in his final confrontation with Neo.
I:8405;5536;Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus is stern, resolute and commanding.
I:8405;5537;femme fatale, lithe and sexy in her shiny black leather and skillfully deadly.
I:8405;5538;inspiring characters are intertwined into an intricate world magnificently crafted by the Wachowski Brothers.
I:8405;5539;Their previous feature, Bound, proved they had a knack for eye.
I:8405;5540;the special effects are particularly noteworthy as brand new technology and CG methods were invented for several of the shocking fight sequences.
I:8405;5541;This is the coolest movie i have ever witnessed!
I:8405;5542;one can be told what the matrix is, you'll just have to get it for yourself untill the truth is clear to you.
I:8405;5543;I enjoyed the special effects of The Matrix, but that is all.
I:8405;5544;Many of the story elements are very interesting, unfortunately they never pay.
I:8405;5545;up with the audience the entire first half of the film, which grew on my nerves because I really wanted this film to get moving.
I:8405;5546;the fight scenes are spectacular and original.
I:8405;5547;Yes, I am aware that this is planned to be a trilogy now.
I:8405;5548;I really wanted to enjoy this film, but there were just too many flaws for me.
I:8405;5549;If you've never seen it before, you will love it.
I:8405;5550;I especially enjoy the performances by the great Laurence Fishbourn as Morpheus and the gentlemen who plays Agent Smith (I said I wathc the movie alot, not the credits:).
I:8405;5551;The Wachowski Brothers did a terrific job in making a film about such a topic not usually discussed: the realness of reality.
I:8405;5552;The special effects are mind boggling, including a new technique known as Bullet.
I:8405;5553;Invented for the Matrix specifically by a genius of a man by the name of Mr. Gaeta.
I:8405;5554;A movie that will have you thinking all week about the realness of your spouse, your job, your car, the food you eat, and your friends.
I:8405;5555;A must see for deep.
I:8405;5556;This film blew my mind.
I:8405;5557;What I got was an awesome tour.
I:8405;5558;force of special effects action and one of the most engaging fighting sequences of all time.
I:8405;5559;I also thought that Lawrence Fishburne as Morpheus was a perfect cast (and they were going to cast Val Kilmer.)
I:8405;5560;The Matrix is one of those movies that'll have you questioning your reality at film's end.
I:8405;5561;The Matrix is a gripping thriller with awe.
I:8405;5562;inspiring special effects that is sure to become a cult classic and will be enjoyed for years to come.
I:8405;5563;Held up to time well, and weAre going after the sequels.
I:8405;5564;The whole cast is GReAT and owning a part of this movie is something great as well (something to be proud of).
I:8405;5565;No words can fully describe how great this movie is, you just have to go and watch it.
I:8405;5566;out of ALL the many movies i have seen throughout my life, this is THE best.
I:8405;5567;By now you either love it or hate it, and if you are looking here, odds are you love it.
I:8405;5568;the colors were amazing, as they are in most Blu.
I:8405;5569;I honestly do not often notice the improved sound on Blu.
I:8405;5570;What you see is all you get.
I:8405;5571;It's okay, everything will be all right.
I:8405;5572;the Matrix is a great visual spectacle but that's about it.
I:8405;5573;One extra star was added upon hearing Keenu say whoa again.
I:8405;5574;This movie is excellent for many reasons.
I:8405;5575;Not only does it have fantastic martial art special effects but it also has a somewhat beleivable story.
I:8405;5576;Its a love story a sci.
I:8405;5577;Everyone who sees this movie will love it.
I:8405;5578;popping special effects, delicious fights, attractive costumes and Kianu Reeves.
I:8405;5579;It manages to be a cultural icon, a spiritual launch.
I:8405;5580;point, and one very cool action.
I:8405;5581;frame to see exactly what they are references.
I:8405;5582;Incredibly interesting storyline, the action is unbelievable, this is just an enjoyable movie to watch.
I:8405;5583;If the movie is excellent, just guess how good the special will be, look at it in perspective, The Matrix on VHS was great in itself.
I:8405;5584;what an outrageously innovative plot.
I:8405;5585;One of the best sci.
I:8405;5586;Once again Keanu puts on another performance worthy of Bill and Ted's excellent adventure, and Point Break, but this film has some unbelievable effects and a story that keeps you semi alert.
I:8405;5587;Worth taking a look at, if nothing else just for Keanu's crazy antics.
I:8405;5588;I think that it is one of the greatest movies ever made.
I:8405;5589;It is definitely the movies which could best explain our times.
I:8405;5590;Waking up can be scary for many of you, but The Matrix makes you feel good about waking up.
I:8405;5591;Watch The Matrix and come out here with the rest of us who are awake already.
I:8405;5592;It absolutely redefined the entire action genre, and did so with unrivaled flair and panache.
I:8405;5593;not only are the film's special effects groundbreaking and visually stunning, but the action is superb as well.
I:8405;5594;the movie succeeds on all levels, but perhaps the thing that most clearly indicates the greatness of this movie is that I never tire of watching it again.
I:8405;5595;The special features on bullet time and the commentary tracks are insightful and interesting, making Matrix a must.
I:8405;5596;Amazing, amazing premise and film.
I:8405;5597;old, but my son loved it.
I:8405;5598;multiple angles, commentary, behind the scenes, essays, interactive features, soundtrack, and in my opinion the best part .
I:8405;5599;by the way the second time i watched it i totally got it, and watched it again a couple of hours later, which is rare for me.
I:8405;5600;This movie starts out really good,then it gets very boring in the middle,then it gets really really good in the end.
I:8405;5601;It's was very confusing, but the graphics and special effects were excellent.
I:8405;5602;The more times you see it, the more it will begin to make sense.
I:8405;5603;The Matrix is a world where nothing is real, just your imagination makes you believe it's real.
I:8405;5604;i recommend this movie to people who like action/thriller movies.
I:8405;5605;fi novel, this movie manages to get a right combination of action, special effects and great sense of excitement.
I:8405;5606;It is now one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8405;5607;We all know its the hands down best action movie ever made.
I:8405;5608;the next two movies absolutely SUCK.
I:8405;5609;I will however tell you that I think the Matrix is the BEST sci.
I:8405;5610;It was, fresh, original, had a staggering concept, good dialogue, great action, even great acting from the normally meatheaded Reeves.
I:8405;5611;after what seemed like an eternity, the next movies hit the big screen.
I:8405;5612;The hugely awesome ending to the first one becomes the biggest anti.
I:8405;5613;On a side note, the first movie stands alone perfectly as a complete story.
I:8405;5614;This movie is good on so many levels that it cannot be fully described in less than 1000 words.
I:8405;5615;Aspects such as perspective and shot angle are also masterfully done.
I:8405;5616;paced and engrossing The authors manage to provide a sci.
I:8405;5617;Overall, excellent performances were turned in by the entire cast.
I:8405;5618;besides wonderful special effects and staging the plot to this movie is a one of a kind.
I:8405;5619;15 years later and the film is considered to be one of the best science fiction movies ever made.
I:8405;5620;The crew of the Nebuchadnezzar leads the charge, following an ancient prophecy, that says they will one day discover a human with extraordinary abilities, that will lead to the destruction of the Matrix.
I:8405;5621;Reeves is often put down for being too dark and emotionless in his roles, but that is exactly what the role of Neo calls for, making Reeves the perfect choice to play him.
I:8405;5622;He is the one who discovered the prophecy and who risks everything for Neo.
I:8405;5623;The story of the Matrix is one of the most original to come alone in decades, featuring a perfectly cast group of actors, who are aided by special effects, the likes of which had never been seen before.
I:8405;5624;THE MATRIX is the most popular film to come out in recent years and definitely the best since 1995's CASINO.
I:8405;5625;That's changed a lot with this sci.
I:8405;5626;From there Neo is swept away from what we call reality .
I:8405;5627;generated world created to keep us happy.
I:8405;5628;What we think of as 1999 is actually closer to 2199 .
I:8405;5629;and out of the """"perfect world"""", it shows."""
5630;from the flawless special effects, the great cast, the action.
5631;packed screenplay, the commendable directing and the perfect choreography by martial arts master director Yuen Wo Ping, THE MATRIX is a non.
5632;stop thrill ride that is almost flawless.
5633;I should definitely recommend THE MATRIX to anyone looking for a good time.
5634;After now seeing the movies that followed this masterpiece, I must say that this has by far the strongest plot of the trilogy, since the other two focus on action more.
5635;The characters in this movie are unforgettable, despite me not being a big fan of Reeves.
5636;I especially think that Fisburne takes the cake with his character of Morpheous, and I think that Moss does an outstanding job as the leading lady in Trinity.
5637;So overall, this is one movie that everyone should see and lives up to expectations!
5638;Back in 1999, before the much hyped and anticipated Star Wars Episode 1 was to be released, a little talked about and hyped science fiction movie slipped in under the radar a few months later and dazzled audiences with it's incredible fight scenes and special effects.
5639;"He is rescued by human rebels and told that he is ""the one""
I:8405;5640;The action is wide and varied, from kung fu fights with machines to shootouts in helicopters to a particularly stunning shootout in a massive, pillar filled lobby.
I:8405;5641;We watched other programs and they fine.
I:8405;5642;The story is perfect, the effects are breathtaking, and the acting is great.
I:8405;5643;Once you see this, you'll want to see it again.
I:8405;5644;The Matrix may not be a realistic venture into the future but it's a good ride.
I:8405;5645;The Matrix is a breakthrough on how action films will be made.
I:8405;5646;Incorporating new camera techniques and experimenting with visuals and editing.
I:8405;5647;Others have already well explicated it.
I:8405;5648;Well written with great visuals, directing and acting, including ground.
I:8405;5649;That's what makes it a classic.
I:8405;5650;some have said it can be viewed as drawing on Buddhist traditions as well.
I:8405;5651;any way you slice it, it is a compelling, intriguing and well done story.
I:8405;5652;A fantastic film star rating 9/10.
I:8405;5653;Its has loads of excitment and violence, one of my favorite films.
I:8405;5654;First of all and I think you can all agree with me that the special effects are incredible.
I:8405;5655;So here it is The matrix is a world of everything and anything combined.
I:8405;5656;The matrix is an effective and interesting film.
I:8405;5657;The reason for this is that it is succesful at two levels.
I:8405;5658;This world is based on an original view of the future and is a plausable basis for an action film.
I:8405;5659;The second level is that this is an effective action adventure film set in that world.
I:8405;5660;The plot is taunt and gets you in.
I:8405;5661;the roles are all played well and both Keanu Reeves and the female lead are great.
I:8405;5662;The action scenes are tremendous and you can watch them again and again.
I:8405;5663;Ok whoever looks at this movie as one of the best of the year or of all time for that matter is either glued to their computer all day arguing about klingons on the internet.
I:8405;5664;It is a good action flick regardless, and has mind blowing effects.
I:8405;5665;This movie was fantastic, I saw it first day first show and almost no one was in the theatre, this shows you that almost no one was waiting in line because of MTV.
I:8405;5666;The sound is amazing to, since sound is 50 percent of the movie this plays a very important role, it would win best sound to if it wasn't for Star Wars.
I:8405;5667;The Matrix takes all the elements of all the great action, sci.
I:8405;5668;See this movie, it blew me away from opening to end, I saw it six times in the theatre, it got better every time.
I:8405;5669;There are two realities: one that consists of the life we live every day .
I:8405;5670;Neo thus embarks on an adventure that is both terrifying and enthralling.
I:8405;5671;Top ten favorite all time movie list right here
I:8405;5672;Anyway the Blu Ray is excellent, I loved this movie the first time I saw it and still enjoy it when I see it now.
I:8405;5673;The special effects are still amazing.
I:8405;5674;A great addition to my growing Blu Ray collection.
I:8405;5675;A great idea for what could have been a great movie.
I:8405;5676;If all you care about is great special effects, explosions, and gun fire you'll love it.
I:8405;5677;The Wachowski brothers certainly have a handle on the art of filmmaking for the new millennium!
I:8405;5678;MATRIXillustrates just how insightful and prophetic Marshall McLuhan'sassertion The Medium is the message has proved to be!
I:8405;5679;through a seamless symbiotic blending ofdiverse visual and auditory elements, most notably the 360 sequentialsurround photography of artfully choreographed and precisely executedhuman action scenes, the Wachowski's have achieved a truere.
I:8405;5680;definition of the cinematic experience, on their ownterms.
I:8405;5681;Engaging, engrossing and bombarding your senses with theirsignature style, ultimately transporting you to a virtual world muchmore convincing than any drug.
I:8405;5682;The Special effects in this movie is enough to own this movie.
I:8405;5683;the story line isnt very good but the effects make up for it and a great performance by Laurence Fishburne.
I:8405;5684;This is the best action movie I ever layed my eyes opon.
I:8405;5685;It also kan make you nuts if you start to belive.
I:8405;5686;its an Actin move of the highest class ever.
I:8405;5687;'What is real' combined with 'Karate kid'!
I:8405;5688;Entertaining movie but not the best sci.
I:8405;5689;This is a wonderful film!
I:8405;5690;The characters, the actors, the effects: they are all amazing!
I:8405;5691;The special features are awesome!
I:8405;5692;And the commentary version of the film was very refreshing after having watched the theatrical version a few dozen times.
I:8405;5693;I highly recommend this movie and am very anxious to see what the Wachowski brothers do with the next two pieces of this trilogy.
I:8405;5694;edge technology used in the making of this movie made it a classic.
I:8405;5695;You know a movie is good when you want to see its """"the making of"""" program on television."""
5696;This is the best movie I have ever seen!
5697;The movie is so good words cannot describe it!
5698;The story line is the best I've ever seen, the fx are the best, this is the best movie out there.
5699;The bottom line is this is the best movie ever made in the history of movies.
5700;I loved this movie as did my eight year old son.
5701;The interesting thing to me was that my son usually finds these types of movies scary because of their intensity.
5702;He adored this one, in fact he considers it his favorite movie.
5703;I think it was a combonation of the wonderful special effects, the story, and the fact that there wasn't gore for gore's sake.
5704;Best movie ever great special effects amazing plot and everyone played there part and did a great job i am suspecting good things from moss and fishbone did an amazing job i cant wait for the sequel.
5705;But let me tell you.
5706;He and the rest of the cast were .
5707;I especially liked the still/moving action sequences.
5708;I loved walking out of the theater excited, thinking about how Neo stopped those bullets, and talking about this great movie with my husband on the way home in the car.
5709;This movie is full of great action packed stunts, moves, and special effects.
5710;The director has a way of making you feel like you are part of the action.
5711;He puts you right up close to what is happening, making it almost as if you are that character.
5712;"So know what you're getting into
I:8405;5713;The best movie i've seen in along time.
I:8405;5714;With all the action happening it keeps you hooked.
I:8405;5715;I found it rather confusing in some parts but overall i enjoyed it.
I:8405;5716;The special affects were great.
I:8405;5717;It has great actors, a brain.
I:8405;5718;popping plot, and the best special effects I've seen before from any movie.
I:8405;5719;Greatest movie ever made in my opinion.
I:8405;5720;Cleverly written poetic dialogue, philosophical undertones, action, romance, science fiction, rebellion?!
I:8405;5721;This movie really hit home to me.
I:8405;5722;It is always in the back of our minds.
I:8405;5723;But this movie helps in an essence for us to live out the fantasy and find the truth .
I:8405;5724;There are so many levels to this movie I had to wonder if my life was a dream.
I:8405;5725;And I must say this is one of the best!
I:8405;5726;rOM yet it is definetly worth the cost.
I:8405;5727;I HIGHLY recommend this movie, not only for it's stunningly vivid computer animated effects, but for it's interesting plot, and incredible action.
I:8405;5728;well, everyone has his or her own opinion about """"how good"""" something is."""
5729;I had friends that were able to see the movie on the opening night.
5730;Yes, I waited almost two months for it.
5731;The cool thing about this movie is that it explains so much.
5732;The movie challenges our perceptions and the very notions of awareness and sentience.
5733;In addition, you will want to watch with the commentary turned on at least once and definitely watch at least once with the white rabbit feature turned on.
5734;To the latter group I say Wake up copper top!
5735;says Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), the earnest, elegant John the Baptist figure in the Wachowski brothers' allegorical science fiction masterpiece.
5736;Well, we'll give it a shot.
5737;out of the late 20th century world as he knows it, into the real, post.
5738;Fellow freedom fighter Trinity (Carrie.
5739;The story's a potent mix of buddhism, Greek mythology, and .
5740;Admittedly Reeves is gifted the perfect role .
5741;he has to look good while hitting things .

5743;"nestling next to ""The Terminator"" and ""Metropolis"", this is one the finest sci."
5744;And yes, we admit, you do have to see it for yourself.
5745;It's one of my favorite films.
5746;keannu Reeves is perfect for this role.
5747;His cool attitude really fits the character.
5748;Hugo Weaving is great as Agent Smith.
5749;Really, the whole cast is good.
5750;the cinematography, colors, costumes, sets, and special effects are great.
5751;And there's loads of special effects.
5752;once you understand what i am talking about, the movie will make sense, and so will the fact that the Wachowski brothers have created a masterpiece that should rank in the top ten in our movie libraries for a long time.
5753;I can only show you the door, you must open it for yourself.
5754;the digital sound is so clear and crisp you can hear every single bullet casing tinkle on the floor.
5755;what really make the disc stand out are the extra features.
5756;rOM player, you can access the website directly.)
5757;"The White Rabbit feature is the best
I:8405;5758;as for the movie, it's outstanding as well.
I:8405;5759;I loved the movie, like many others, I saw it 5 times in the theatre.
I:8405;5760;THE MATRIX is a hallmark film"
5761;The special effects are spectacular, the action intense, and the plot extremely well.
5762;fi/action films is the philosophical and allegorical slant of the story.
5763;The film is immersed in the philosophy and religion of the West, embodying everything from Plato to the Bible.
5764;The first movie, here is the best of the best.
5765;great movie, intertwines our human condition in a great science fiction novel,made for the screen.
5766;fi film very well made.
5767;With excellent performaces and graphics.
5768;But The Matrix is still one of the best movies released in 1999.
5769;It deserves an Oscar for it's special effects.
5770;It's great to be sitting in your living room being surrounded by bullets, explosions, etc.
5771;this is one of the most inovative movies of any genre to come out in years.
5772;The Wachoskis are a talent to keep an eye on, they do a great job directing this masterpiece.
5773;The story contains many allusions to Jesus and Buddha and all that which is cool.
5774;In addition i liked the whole what is reality type theme.
5775;By the way, the action scenes, especially a jaw.
5776;dropping lobby shootout, are visually stunning!!
5777;This movie is brilliant and can be watched thousands of times.
5778;This is the clearly the best action/sci.
5779;Yes the movie's cool .
5780;As you watch the film a WHITE RABBIT will appear that you can follow to a look behind the scene you are watching .
5781;it takes you there, shows you how they did it, then brings you back to the film which continues on.
5782;This movie is just full of action.
5783;It has great digital effects.
5784;It also wants to make us think about the meaning of our lives.
5785;Of course, these are all good questions.
5786;This movie is pretty cool.
5787;there are a lot of action scenes.
5788;The Matrix is a modern cautionary fairytale, with a rich cast of characters and visual images.
5789;Definitely one of the best sci.
5790;Filled with awesome action and uncompared martial arts scenes, it is without a doubt one of the most down to earth and well elaborated films of this century.
5791;fi movie this is it!
5792;The Matrix has a great plot concept, one that really makes you think.
5793;It's really just a fun movie to watch.
5794;You might be warry that it might not have a great plot because it does have great special effects, but it has a very interesting concept.
5795;I really enjoyed this movie!
5796;To truly understand this brilliant and original film, you must view it again and again and again.
5797;It blew my mind the first time I watched it.
5798;My jaw dropped during that first opening scene and to this day, the effects can't be matched.
5799;I have always loved a god mind bender.
5800;If kinda liked The Game then you will love this movie!
5801;It is so much better than The Game.
5802;Of course Keanu did a great job of portraying Neo.
5803;I cant wait till the matrix 2!
5804;The Matrix is good in the fact that it takes complex science.
5805;fiction from previous 1990s films that didn't quite meet mainstream audiences (Dark City, 12 Monkeys) and merges it with the spectacular CGI effects of an action film.
5806;As an action film The Matrix is incredibly successful and deserves great recognition as one of the best films of the 1990s, or the past two decades for that matter.
5807;The religious spin on things however does really make it interesting, kind of like a science.
5808;fi film it was very good, regardless of how many of the elements that it was reusing from other films, but I often felt like the production team couldn't decide on whether or not they wanted an action picture, or a thought stimulating sci.
5809;By the end however The Matrix does succeed in balancing these two things very nicely.
5810;The CGI deserved its Academy Award, because it really is amazing some of the things they were able to pull off.
5811;"Reeves has had his moments throughout his career, don't get me wrong, back in the late 1980s (most will remember the Bill and Ted films) he was a rather likable young actor, even in his lesser known performances
I:8405;5812;done, and truly is an eye opener, and as I previously stated the performances are mostly strong.
I:8405;5813;Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) are very good in their respective roles, and both (as most people will say) are embraced as engaging characters in the mind of the audience, while Reeves was more of a vehicle to channel elaborate action sequences (the highlight, in most people's opinion, of the film).
I:8405;5814;Also the Wachowski Brother's film is simply beautiful to look at, from the all CGI sequences to the live sets.
I:8405;5815;this film really does have all it needs to work as a successful film, especially in the mainstream Hollywood of this day and age.
I:8405;5816;I would defend them no matter what, but when you go against the powers if mainstream and the production companies and end up with a good film you'll always have me backing up your film.
I:8405;5817;fiction was ever really intended to be a genre simply designed to create exciting action sequences.
I:8405;5818;the Matrix was a great film, deserving its mainstream applause: Solid 9/10 stars
I:8405;5819;There's very little I can say about the movie that I liked, but I'll try.
I:8405;5820;While the special effects are good, where was the story?
I:8405;5821;Give me The Green Mile any and every day.
I:8405;5822;This movie advances a very intriguing concept.
I:8405;5823;and so are those we dream us,and so on.
I:8405;5824;but what we see in the second part of the movie is a special.
I:8405;5825;sequence,followed by a martial arts combat.
I:8405;5826;Without a doubt, this movie continues to amaze me with its special effects.
I:8405;5827;It is expected that the plot would fall second to its special effects, but it holds its own quite well.
I:8405;5828;Good movie this is my favorite of the series exactly as advertised but pay attention or you will need to rewatch
I:8405;5829;With surround sound is very capturing.
I:8405;5830;I love the special effects.
I:8405;5831;I recommend it to all action movies fans.
I:8405;5832;anne Moss all turn in amazing performances as Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity.
I:8405;5833;dazzling martial arts, dizzying special effects, a plot that questions our entire concept of 'real', an awesome soundtrack/score, and great acting all made The Matrix a cultural phenomenon that hasn't been seen since the original Star Wars over twenty years ago.
I:8405;5834;Take an incredibly bad actor, put him in a story with alot of potential, add awesome special effects, and you still have the viewing equivalent of Star Wars Episode One .
I:8405;5835;these chilling words introduce us, and a freshly black.
I:8405;5836;It gets better every time.
I:8405;5837;If slick special effects and gunplay are all you need in a movie then go for it.
I:8405;5838;This is the best movie ever if you haven't seen it you have to see it right now!
I:8405;5839;by laymen and professionals alike.
I:8405;5840;this one fantastic movie, in and of it's own accord, justifies their having a place of prominence in the pantheon of the all time great producers / directors in movie making history.
I:8405;5841;being an intelligent, thoughtful, highly analytical and conscious individual, the mental stimulation which I derived from this finely nuanced film was enough to make me giddy.
I:8405;5842;with a superb cast"
5843;"the sense that if we can conceive it and BELIEVE it, that we can also achieve it
I:8405;5844;trinity, played by Carrie Ann Moss, believed so strongly in Morpheus, that she risked her life time and time again, delving into the matrix as a liaison between Morpheus and 'the one'.
I:8405;5845;'This movie is so tightly constructed that even the names of these individuals tell a story that is relative to it's character.
I:8405;5846;trinity represents the power of alliance, particularly the alliance of three, as in the sun the moon and the stars, the father the son and the holy ghost, life death and rebirth, past present and future, etc. and she serves as the link between Morpheus' ideology, and it's real life application in the embodiment of Neo.
I:8405;5847;this s**t is the macrocosm in microcosm, finely nuanced in every detail"
5848;"SOUND BYTESNEO: ""So what are you telling me."
5849;It was a summer movie, entertaining for the duration of the show, forgettable afterwards.
5850;satified and flashy, but who cares, give the masses eye.
5851;As matter of fact, it is the standard Reluctant Hero plot: shy young boy/man is told that he is special, The One.
5852;Every aspect of it is fantastic.
5853;The dialog, acting are top.
5854;The Matrix leans heavily on spectacular effects and a decent plot, Dark City relies on strong acting and plotline.
5855;The Matrix is a great movie that you don't have to think very hard to follow, and Dark City is a superb movie you have to pay close attention to in order to follow.
5856;I recommend both with Dark City ranked as a 5.
5857;I agree that the matrix has stunning effects and action sequences.
5858;It's brainless fun and a thought.
5859;provoking conceptualization of life in these fast.
5860;The brothers have an eye for small details, such as reflections and color tints.
5861;As an synthesis of comic books, sci.
5862;fi, and Hong Kong action movies, The Matrix is just fine.
5863;it's a brilliant idea, it's a totally awesome movie, and in the words of Neo, all I can say is woa
5864;I have read about half of the reviews for this movie and there seems to be an overwhelming consensus that this is the best science fiction movie ever made.
5865;Most reviewers are quick to point out the innovative special effects and the complicated plot rewarded by multiple viewings.
5866;They are superb, if not a bit overdone.
5867;Maybe that's why it's such a crowd pleaser.
5868;subtle religious allegory heaped with a bit of watered.
5869;All in all, we have a great action movie with some good effects, but little else to offer, especially in the thought department.
5870;Still, this is a great movie that allows viewers to suspend critical evaluation long enough to really get into the plot.
5871;If you like action movies then you'll love this movie.
5872;tech vs the human spirit, hero gets the girl in the end, a not.
5873;Few mortal minds can watch this movie a second time in a hurry (mine included)!
5874;Proof that GOD is Good.
5875;What surprised me was how uniformly engaging the Matrix is .
5876;"the people in front of me were getting a Disney movie
I:8405;5877;The hero and heroine take on and overcome many bad guys with some great gun.
I:8405;5878;There is great initial framing and the stunts and action are truly impressive.
I:8405;5879;I've never seen another movie hold everyone's attention so completely.
I:8405;5880;this is only one of several fantastic action sequences.
I:8405;5881;And what makes this movie great is the consistency of the plot and elements of the story, which other reviewers have noted in detail.
I:8405;5882;He's rather wooden for the part and I think they could have done a much better job with casting.
I:8405;5883;If you just want something to watch to fill an evening this is fine but I'd never recommend to anyone.
I:8405;5884;This is a great movie.
I:8405;5885;Even though it is confusing at first, if you see it more than once, you will be thrilled.
I:8405;5886;It is a great movie, bit tough to understand, but definitely worth the watch.
I:8405;5887;A soon to be classic film in stunning resolution.
I:8405;5888;Great action scenes and it will keep you what is real throughout.
I:8405;5889;This is one of the most original movies ever created, taking advantage of people's already high techno.
I:8405;5890;Your first impression of this is Great, another conspiracy movie.
I:8405;5891;After she jumps over a great distance from one building to another, and when her enemy does the same, you start to wonder What just happened?
I:8405;5892;The complicated plot then starts to unravel, always one step ahead of you.
I:8405;5893;One last thing is that the cast was great.
I:8405;5894;Good movie, incredible speical effects.
I:8405;5895;my final rating, 4 stars.
I:8405;5896;influencing films of the last thirty years, The Matrix combines amazing acting with a wonderful story and brilliant special effects.
I:8405;5897;I've seen many, many movies in my life, but this one takes the cake.
I:8405;5898;The Matrix is by far the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life.
I:8405;5899;Even if you do not like action movies, you will love The Matrix.
I:8405;5900;The plot line also really gets you thinking.
I:8405;5901;she's hot, she's spontaneous, she's an awesome actress, and she is a major contributing character to both the plot and the action of the movie .
I:8405;5902;Keanu Reeves has another great part in this movie, and the Agents .
I:8405;5903;They're cunning, ruthless, and very well played.
I:8405;5904;The entire movie is phenomenal .
I:8405;5905;If you've already seen this movie, see it again.
I:8405;5906;I would definitely recommend this movie in any format you can get .
I:8405;5907;This is it, friends, an out and out mind.
I:8405;5908;The cast, plot, and effects of The Matrix combine to make this the film achievement of the decade.
I:8405;5909;Overall this is a great movie, Awesome special effects, great acting, Solid plot except that one blooper.
I:8405;5910;It is a work of art.
I:8405;5911;In this world everything is run by """"The Matrix"""", a super computer that controls everything and everybody, body and soul."""
5912;powerful humans and can take control of anybody still hooked up to the Matrix)To accomplish this he is given a crash course in martial arts in a manner that would be great if it were possible today (I can imagine the ads .
5913;Once he reintroduces himself to the Matrix's world the stage is set for some climactic fight scenes, among the best ever seen in cinema history.
5914;to say more would be to give away too much of the plot, but suffice to say The Matrix is one of the biggest, most explosive, most stylish SF films ever.
5915;But it is Fishburne's movie.
5916;it is his presence that holds the whole thing together and keeps you rivetted to your seat.
5917;couple that with an outstanding directors talk.
5918;"What more do you want?And any film that contains a clip of the cult classic ""Night of the Lepus"" is always going to be worth a look."
5919;The Matrix is certainly one of my ten favorite movies ever.
5920;"Plus there is a new ""picture in picture"" mode that's quite interesting."
5921;"For a great Matrix book you can really sink your teeth into, check out ""The Art of the Matrix"" edited by Spencer Lamm."
5922;It had a well thought out plot and credible acting.
5923;The action sequences are ingenious and totally awesome!
5924;fi, action, thriller filcks and all, but the film we saw (and repetitiously enjoy, hopefully) is still undeniably a peice of delicious eye.
5925;apreciated genre by smoothly combining thought.
5926;By the way, for those of you that like The Matrix will surely appreciate Pitch Black as well.
5927;Good movie, wonderful technically, defined the state of the art in special effects.
5928;It is pure genius, virtually flawless, and what flaws you find are the directors' intentional reminders of the importance of being human.
5929;:^)Bravissimo to the new W. Brothers!
5930;The thought that there is some other force guiding our lives and actions .
5931;a dream within a dream .
5932;is a common story theme but in The Matrix, the Wachowski Bro's really take this concept to a new level.
5933;rom features, the disc is innovatively designed to entertain far beyond the running time of the standard film.
5934;It seemed to be a breat of fresh air that the sci.
5935;I normally don't like Keanu but he did really well in this one, and Carrie.
5936;I really love the way this flick starts out because you don't really know what's going on and it's really mysterious.
5937;It has a great plot, visually stunning.
5938;The story is so interesting and the movie is so exciting I have watched it numerous times.
5939;I look forward to watching it with friends that have never seen it before.
5940;The metaphor of this movie is amazing!
5941;The enlightenment of waking up and seeing the world for what it really is versus swallowing the dogma that has been fed to you your entire life is as drastic of a rebirth experience as this movie makes it out to be.
5942;A classic by any measure.
5943;This is a great movie.
5944;Great storyline, real confusing the first time you watch it.
5945;Its a good movie, especially for 10 bucks.
5946;I recommend you check this movie out.
5947;Not much action in this movie, but theres a couple scenes with some good action parts, but a good storyline, it keeps you entertained throughout the whole movie.
5948;I was quite impressed by the film in the cinema.
5949;This is a great film.
5950;at times it can seem like your just waiting for a gun fight at the 'boring bits', but they are worth the wait.
5951;in my opinion the first Matrix film is the best is has become a classic amoung action lovers.
5952;I love this movie and for some reason hadn't added it to my collection yet.
5953;Can't complain about the price for a solid movie.
5954;This movie is a great example of how a movie is suppost to be like.
5955;It has everything action , suspense , and even formed a little of a love content.
5956;The main characters (Neo ,Trinity ,Morpheus) played there roles very well giving the movie a extra aspect .
5957;I am looking forward to the next matrix movie Matrix: Reloaded and I feel that the wolds in for a big impact in this one as well.
5958;Dodging of bullets, fighting agents.
5959;pack movie (Released in 1995) is funny, serious, scary, and TOTALLY OFF DA HIZZLE!
5960;It takes place when Morpheous(Lawerence Fishburne) tells Neo about the Matrix, and the rest, well, is history!
5961;This movie is a classic, and the blu.
5962;ray makes it even better to watch all over again.
5963;Yes, the special effects and all that but nothing impressive.
5964;The plot was complete with a sappy but enchanting love story, breathtaking action and fighting sequences, and an edge.
5965;seat climax of twists that led to an orgasmic conclusion of events.
5966;The cast played their characters to the utmost.
5967;Keanu Reeves (Neo)demonstrated superior martial arts technique (with the help of digitization and wires of course) as well.
5968;The screenplay was absolutely riveting.
5969;The breakthrough visual effects, like Neo dodging bullets in detailed slow.
5970;In my honest opinion, the Matrix is the greatest movie of the decade.
5971;It's one of those movies you watch 50 times and still be able to find some new, integral piece of the story.
5972;The best part of the movie is the fact that it is going to be a trilogy.
5973;Star Wars eat your heart out.
5974;I loved the movie, but by now you know that this movie is exciting, fast.
5975;winning Special Effects and Sound.
5976;With brilliant handfuls of casting, cutting edge visual effects, and top.
5977;notch martial arts Choreography The Matrix is the ONE that will take you on a ride to the next level of movie experiences.
5978;This isn't the greatest movie EVER, but it is still a good action.
5979;music commentary, and (this is creative) where one can set up a white rabbit to flash at the bottom of the screen at certain parts, leading on to show how those scenes were filmed.
5980;In the end, the Matrix is really worthwhile.
5981;An extremely entertaining and interesting film from the Wachowski brothers.
5982;fi story, superb editing and sound, and a hell lot of action and fun!
5983;I'm Sure One Of you Have thought something like the Matrix as a Kid Well with this movie you get to see it in action,a must Have for fans
5984;Think that the reality is a dream .
5985;I love this movie becouse of the amazing special effects and the really good story.
5986;You just have to see this movie!
5987;Becouse there you can watch Interviews and documentary about the special effects.
5988;A hero called the One.
5989;This really is Mr. Sothoth's last review.
5990;The story for the Matrix is incredible, it makes you think and wonder about the world.
5991;Later, I discovered that it was an incredible movie with great special effects and great storyline that was executed almost perfectly.
5992;I really have a love for cinematography, and this movie was filmed very well.
5993;The Matrix movie is great, I recommend it to be seen by everybody, the moves are great and new, lots of computer images and tricks are implemented in this movie as well as the special effects.
5994;this is a film worth watching.
5995;excellent film with wicked special effects.
5996;best one i have seen for a while that makes yout think that there might be another world out there.
5997;Mebbe the Messiah walks among us.
5998;with those three seemingly simple words, the entire concept of the Matrix is born.
5999;Part science fiction, part philosophical musing, part action.
6000;"adventure, ""The Matrix"" is, pure and simple, the most well."
6001;crafted science fiction film of all.
6002;Plus, the absolutely unbelievable/horrible future that awaits us is so unforgiving that viewers can't help but cheer for the protagonists, even if we will go back to our AI the next day at work.
6003;"of course, the special effects in this film are absolutely stunning, what with the use of ""Bullet Time"" (where the lightning action is slowed down to miniscule movements without losing any clarity)."
6004;overall, this is a masterpiece science fiction film, combining an extraordinarily engaging plot, very able.
6005;bodied protagonists and antagonists, as well as special effects that, at the time of the film's release, were cutting edge.
6006;"So, if you are looking for a film that will have you deep in contemplation days after viewing, but will also make you say ""Whoa"" (to quote Neo) while viewing, this film is for you."
6007;The way the effects moe smoothly across the screen and you can barely tell that they aren't real is amazing.
6008;This movie ranks up there with Star Wars as one of the best sci.
6009;The Matrix is the first movie in the trilogy, and the best.
6010;It is a movie about an unreal world that certain people can enter and when jacked.
6011;in the matrix, appear much more powerful.
6012;Through all the action and a hint of love story, this is an awesome movie that will take everyone that watches it into its grip.
6013;"Last night, I have watched one of my favorite movies, ""The Matrix"" as I have seen it many times."
6014;I would highly recommend this movie, and I am not talking about just the full trilogy.
6015;"also, there was alot of dailogues between Neo and Morpheus that is memorable, including this one:""The Matrix is a system, Neo."
6016;That system is our enemy.
6017;The very minds of the people we are trying to save.
6018;But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy.
6019;Interesting, eh?Go out and see this movie.
6020;It is surely a must see and there's a good deal to learn from it.
6021;The greatest Hong Kong action film ever made is an American film.
6022;It meets and exceeds all high hopes and expectations awaiting it.
6023;It is a gorgeous, visionary, and revolutionary film, one of the best films of 1999, indeed one of the greatest films of all time.
6024;the thing that stands out the most in The Matrix is its awesome and well.
6025;crafted action: numerous weapons, high.
6026;bending moves and motion that makes other actions films' fight scenes seem slow and weak in comparison thanks to their powered.
6027;arts combat scenes that are among the most complicated, fast, clever, original, and fun fighting scenes of action films, if not simply the best.
6028;the excellent and sophisticated direction keeps the action alive: beautiful stop.
6029;motion use combined with extremely impressive 360.
6030;"degree rotating and panning of the camera
I:8405;6031;It uses pure, graceful combat.
I:8405;6032;How ironic it is that an American film knows how to do martial arts better than most recent Hong Kong films.
I:8405;6033;And the real world, above them, contains the humans' rulers and enslavers.
I:8405;6034;It's an intriguing premise and an interesting vision of the future.
I:8405;6035;And through the themes on reality and its relativity, the power of belief, the concept of mind.
I:8405;6036;the acting is the sole dent (however small, as will be explained) of this otherwise wonderful film.
I:8405;6037;Fishburne was very good, composed and only sometimes corny.
I:8405;6038;anne Moss was good, too.
I:8405;6039;perfect"
6040;It's one of the greatest films of all time.
6041;Even if it only had superb action and nothing else like plot or direction, it would still be great.
6042;Do yourself a favor and see it.
