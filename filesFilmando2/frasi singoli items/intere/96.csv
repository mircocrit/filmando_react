1;the audio is pristine and the depth in this is unreal.
2;The suspense builds because Tony's watch has stopped.
3;"But Margot manages to stab ""Fisher"" and it is the attacker who is killed."
4;But clever Tony improvises another plan to accomplish his end!
5;Justice triumphs in the end.
6;Dial M for Murder is a great film from Hitchcock.
7;it also has that elusive merit of repeatability.
8;which now brings me to my title.
9;This is a great movie.
10;I love watching it and get caught up in it every time.
11;Watch it and see for yourself.
12;Grace Kelly is truly believable as is the entire cast.
13;I wouldn't put this movie in the top drawer of Hitchcock's output but it's still well worth watching.
14;But his camera angles and the way he switches focus from one character to the next is masterful.
15;This is a superb depiction of an oily, comletely amoral yet charming man.
16;It's part of Hitchcock's genius that the viewer actually sympathizes with him.
17;Grace Kelley is gorgeous as the wife, although not required to act up a storm.
18;Other great performances come from John Williams, the chief inspector, and Antony Dawson, the murderer turned victim.
19;Just watch it to enjoy a master at work, in full command of a superb cast.
20;very good movie for a variety of reasons.
21;Although the plot doesn't contain too many intersting twists, it is executed very effectively as hitchcock often did and raises the movie from good to he would own level.
22;There's a lot of grain over the picture, a colored sand flickering all the time.
23;well that is the plot line here in the film under review, Alfred Hitchcock's Dial M For Murder, as an ill.
24;Why on this good green earth would anyone in their right minds touch one hair on the head of one Grace Kelly.
25;This is one of the best suspense and mystery movies ever, and is still fresh today as it was when the movie was made.
26;the film is interesting in either format, however, to see how Hitchcock actually uses his directorial tricks and choice of actors to make us feel sympathy for Grace Kelly and empathy for Ray Milland, her would.
27;Ray Milland is a great villain and Robert Cummings such a great puppy dog of a hero.
28;Grace Kelly is kind of dumb, but beautiful as always.
29;I wanted to watch a classic and it was great to watch it for free with my Prime membership.
30;Often overlooked, but this is classic Hitchcock fare.
31;Great acting, directing and cinematography.
32;The majority of the movie is shot in one room and the varying camera angles and lighting add to the suspense.
33;Grace Kelly was impressive as always.
34;Great movie, but not the 3.
35;Halfway between Rope and Rear Window, Dial M For Murder is a masterpiece of dialogue.
36;driven thrills, filled with snappy lines, memorable characters and magnificent twists and intrigues.
37;The acting, though not outstanding, serves its purpose admirably, and you feel for the characters and do actually care whether they live or die, which is always a bonus in a story revolving around murder.
38;A number of long takes keep the film moving swiftly onwards, and despite its for the most part one.
39;A lot of people dislike this film because it is plot.
40;driven and not, dare I say it, arty and high.
41;The tension created by the camera circling Grace Kelly when she is on the phone is intense, the frequently astounding camera shots that swoop in from the other side of the room to extreme close.
42;ups of, for example, keys, are ingenious instruments of plot.
43;die shot as the murder is planned is definitely worthy of note.
44;roaring, rousing dialogue at that, then Dial M For Murder is the perfect movie.
45;If youve ever watched more than one episode of Colombo, you will love it.
46;a lot of modern movies stem from this one.
47;l enjoyed watching this alfred hitchcock movie, with grace kelly and ray milland in it.
48;l would recommend it to people wholike his movies.
49;The story itself was gripping, in the usual Hitchcock fashion, and supenseful to the end.
50;On the active shutter plasma, ghosting was much more evident, very much so during the opening credits, and at various points in the film, especially during dark scenes.
51;overall, a very enjoyable film, one which I will watch many times again.
52;Sharp acting, dialogue and intrigue keep you hooked from beginning to end.
53;ray release,but,all in all,I still very much recommend it.
54;Dial M For Murder may not be Hitchcock's best movie, but it is the director at his best: telling a simple story, with some fine twists, a peculiar sense o humor and a catching plot.
55;the cast is small but perfect.
56;Grace Kelly plays the ingenous wife with so much beauty and dignity that it is impossible not to fall for her.
57;The script is perfect: everything makes sense and everything is in its right place.
58;The plot is so interesting and catching, that these `problems' get invisible through the movie.
59;Moreover, hsi peculiar sense of humor makes the film lighter and better to watch.
60;The murdering scene is amazing, and I suggest you not to even blink, in order not to lose any moment of this sequence.
61;murdering develops in a incredible speed, Grace's trial is one of the most inventive of the cinema.
62;And the two films are good in their own way.
63;This is a classic movie with a great plot.
64;He discovered she's really in love with mystery writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings).
65;He's planned it out very carefully, the perfect murder.
66;I saw this movie when it came out and enjoyed it then and I relived the experience again when I saw this Blu.
67;I recommend this to anyone who wants to see a real thriller.
68;If you like cat and mouse mysteries.
69;while it sounds nice it gives me hope the Disney can do the same to Sleeping Beauty!!!
70;Won't the be a treat!?
71;A great deception, great actors, and Hitchcock's brand of scary.
72;True, Big Bill Tilden in the day was still playing excellent tennis .
73;This is a wonderful film with great actors of the period: Milland, Kelly, Robert Cummings (as the American lover), Anthony Dawson (as the bad guy), and John Williams, one of Hitchcock's favorite actors, as the Chief Inspector.
74;Tony is aware of this but keeps it to himself.
75;Dial M For Murder is truly a black and white gem worth watching.
76;"That will always be his trademark
77;what I'd like to remember Mr. Hitchcock for is his ingenious ability to create a sense of pathos psychosis in most of his main protagonists and villains"
78;Mr. Hitchcock masterfully sets up this scene with a changing of the point of view in the story and main characters.
79;(although this changes later in the story)What's haunting and eerie about this film's premise is Hitchcock's use of the point of view throughout the film.
80;The reason is because Hitchcock has conditioned our response with tension and suspense in this highly dramatic situation.
81;"In ""western"" film narrative with all of these suspense elements inter cut together we expect a big payoff."
82;variations of this theme were played out beautifully in Robert De Niro's, Travis Bickle character at the ending climax of Taxi Driver and Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal character in The Silence of the Lambs.

90;Hitchcock was known for his warped sense of humor and as a viewer you'll enjoy the twists in the plot and how Hitchcock can make you feel worried for both the killer and the scheming husband when you shouldn't feel sympathy for either.
91;Peter Bogdanovitch and M. Night Shyamalan have some interesting and funny things to say as they show you scenes from the movie and talk about their take on the scenes.
92;Both have a special fondness for Hitchock but it's Shyamalan who especially gets a kick out of Hitchock and how he ends the film with Ray Milland's sophisticated character offering everyone, including the chief inspector, a cocktail before the police come for the final arrest.
93;Classic Hitchcock with suspense and not knowing who you're rooting for!
94;Very slow paced, but a great old movie to watch.
95;This classic will always be my favorite.
96;For those who like a movie with superb dialogue and suspense, this is it.
97;It's just as entertaining the thirtieth time you watch it as it was the first.
98;It was so clear and we really loved it.
99;We are big Hitch fan's so I am sure that slants our view, but this is truly one of his best.
100;Great performances by all cast involved.
101;Definitely a bucket list movie.
102;Although Hitchcock considered this film one of his lesser efforts, DIAL M FOR MURDER (based on the hit Broadway play by Frederick Knott) contains enough thrills and twists to keep fans happy, and Hitchcock's touch is evident in every scene.
103;Tony accuses his bewildered wife of murder and it's up to the resourceful Inspector Hubbard (John Williams) to solve the case and prove Margot's innocence.
104;"while the film doesn't have the same scope or impact as earlier films like ""Shadow of a Doubt"" or ""Notorious"", DIAL M FOR MURDER is the perfect film version of the Knott play."
105;Ray Milland delivers one of his finest portrayals, and gives the character of Tony a softness and vulnerability that other actors might not have tapped into.
106;In her first Hitchcock film, Grace Kelly is amazing as the targeted wife, looking scrumptious in some lovely gowns.
107;dimensional role of Mark some life but the viewer is always more taken with Milland and Kelly.
108;fated victim) both deliver handsomely.
109;d (and having the distinction of being Hitch's first colour movie), DIAL M FOR MURDER was a sound critical and financial success and remains an enjoyable and entertaining tale from Hitchcock's gallery of films.
110;This is another of my favorite movies, but it did have a big drawback for me: Grace Kelly.
111;If you can get thru that, this movie is really well done and suspenseful.
112;Recently I have noticed that I enjoy the older movies.
113;As the story evolves you have an idea what is going to happen, but it still keeps you on the edge of your seat, until it actually happens.
114;Definitely worth adding to your collection.
115;Alfred Hitchcock is one of my favorite directors.
116;Dial M for murder is an elegant film with wonderful actors.
117;It will remain a classic.
118;I saw this movie many years ago and liked it.
119;times sake and the suspense was still there.
120;I can watch anything that Hitchcock made.
121;His films always had a moral to the story.
122;Loved Ray Milland and of course gorgeous Grace Kelly.
123;I love old movies, and haven't watched this one for many years.
124;It's a little bit corny, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.
125;A truly great movie made even better by the 3.
126;True movie buffs who love classic Hollywood fare should take note here, The recent increase in choices make this a worthwhile investment.
127;This is Grace Kelly at her best, playing high society as well as anyone ever did.
128;This is such an interesting sophisticated mystery w/ o blood and gutsIt keeps you thinking right till the end and love the actors .
129;Wonderful twists and turns It is a perfect Hitchcock movie.
130;A movie for the ages, Hitchcock at his best when it comes to his blondes Grace Kelly is wonderful in this role of victim.
131;"While it is a good movie, and Hitchcock knew how to photograph better than just about anyone, there is an extra ""oomph"" to everything from shots of Grace Kelly, to the murder scenes, down to various bits of mechanical equipment."
132;Back then the ladies did not have a large role, but we enjoyed this one.
133;50s movies are not up to today's productions, especially in the music and dialogue, but this was worth seeing again.
134;Grace Kelly, Ray Milland, Bob Cummings plus a great story.
135;This movie was made when plots were mandatory and the actors made it come to life.
136;Then you have Alfred Hitchcock as the director to spin the entire yarn with suspense.
137;This is one of my favorite movies.
138;A great plot and well thought out suspense and murder mystery.
139;Fourth, it's basically a film of the stage play.
140;He keeps things relatively interesting, but it's basically, it seems to me, a static presentation.
141;Solving the puzzle of how Tony arranged things and then catching Tony is clever.
142;I like Ray Milland, and I think he did a classy job in this movie.
143;He handles the finale, when he's caught and going to the station, with a lot of style.
144;And John Williams, who plays the police inspector, is always reliable.
145;not as charming as Milland, much weaker, a kind of parasite that Margot found, thought she loved and married.
146;And then she meets Ray Milland, a strong, mature, clever fellow.
147;And now it's Robert Cummings who sees his meal ticket being wooed away from him.
148;i found Dial M to be engrossing from start to finish.
149;It has the graceful Kelly, a cool and calculating Ray Milland, still attractive.
150;With an old theme, it also has a third party love interest for the wife.
151;To me, that's a good way to contrast today's films in general.
152;It continues to thicken with Margot's wounded response to her husband's attempting to rearrange the setup his way.
153;He's her husband after all.
154;And, she's a product of her social system.
155;"in any event, as a mystery, this film has an interesting plot, a ""perfect crime"" gone amiss."
156;It is regrouped, with the same touch of genius, but ultimately foiled by a persistent inspector with detection of a subtle element.
157;It sustains interest and suspense and to me, has a satisfactory denouement.
158;As a drama, the mindset of the characters, once placed in their time and social element, are interesting to observe as it all plays out.
159;Great for Hitchcock, Kelly or Milland fans particularly and for those who appreciate the psychological, dialog type of mystery.
160;"not one of the Master's usual ""wrong man"" scenarios, but stunning nonetheless."
161;Dial M For Murder is one of Hitchcock's lesser known movies from the fifties.
162;The film had a strong cast which included Ray Milland, Robert Cummings, and, in her first film for Hitchcock, Grace Kelly.
163;The supporting cast included John Williams and Anthony Dawson.
164;All of us saying nice things to each other .
165;Another of Frederick Knott's plays made into a film was the excellent thriller Wait Until Dark starring Audrey Hepburn.
166;From a director's standpoint, this is by far one of the greatest thrillers ever made and I don't say that lightly (since Hitchcock practically invented the genre).
167;what makes this film such a marvelous gem is the fact that it holds one of Hitchcock's most notable trademarks: telling a story in a single location without it ever being a bore (see Rear Window and Rope).
168;another brilliant thing I love about the film is (if you haven't seen it skip this paragraph!)
169;"What makes Hitchcock films so involving is the control of information
170;It's well made, well acted, well written, and especially well directed.
171;This is the kind of film that, after you see it, you just want to watch it a few more times in a row (or see more of Hitch's films).
172;Ray Milland is the cool, calm conspirator to the last.
173;Great cast with clever police work.
174;the movie 'Dial """"M"""" for Murder' is film adapted from a successful play."""
175;Alfred Hitchcock directed this picture and since almost all of the movie takes place in one setting, it really does have the look of a play put on film.
176;On the contrary, because of a brilliantly conceived story, coupled with superb acting, the film is terrific.
177;Halliday returns to London after an extended absence and Tony knows about this affair and concocts a brilliant plot to murder his wife.
178;the film is rather simple in format and even though there are several twists, the real magic of the movie is how well Tony Wendice, Halliday and the police intellectually involve themselves in the murder plot.
179;Another major strength of the movie is the performance of Ray Milland, who plays a smooth, charming and very cunning mastermind of what seems like the perfect murder.
180;His cool composure from beginning to end in all sorts of troubled spots is an amazing sight to watch.
181;Once the police are involved, Chief Inspector Hubbard played by John Williams shines as well with superb detective work figuring out how and why this killing really occurred.
182;Grace Kelly also does a fine acting job in this film.
183;Overall, its a great movie, but clearly a lesser challenging film for Hitchcock's cinematic brilliance.
184;The sharpness is very good, but not great and there were a few times some of the subjects seems out of focus, but that's probably attributed to the 3.
185;Overall, its still an excellent visual presentation of the movie.
186;This could be the best Alfred Hitchcock movie ever made.
187;Ray Miland does a terrific job being the mastermind criminal.
188;I would recommend this movie to anyone for the intrigue factor.
189;Alfred Hitchcock was the best, why someone thinks they could re.
190;The mystery here is pretty good with enough clever twists.
191;Grace Kelly effortlessly shines as Milland's intended victim.
192;The film stops at certain points to a resounding thud so that we can marvel at the sight of a tray of teacups coming at us.
193;Tolerable Hitchcock but we, and he, deserve better.
194;Grace Kelly's face is amazing she knows it to be true but she does not want it to be true.
195;Even the 2D version has it!
196;The play was perfect for Hitchcock, who showed over and over his ability to do masterful work even when contained in one space for a long period of time (see Lifeboat, and Rear Window, which came out the same year as Dial M).
197;I also loved John Williams as the inspector from Scotland Yard.
198;He also thinks highly of himself and it's great watching him go up against Milland.
199;Watch also for Hitch's cameo in a picture and the neat close ups of the scissors and the telephone number dial.
200;Hitchcock always had the camera telling the story and this film is no exception.
201;Excellent all the way around.
202;"a Alfred Hitchcock motion pictures were released in the year 1954: the spectacular ""Rear Window"" and this other delicious little number called ""Dial M For Murder""."
203;driven, although the attempted murder scene is very well done .
204;I'm guessing that when viewers watched this film in movie theaters in '54, there was probably a huge cheer after Grace did what she had to do to stay among the living.
205;but, for me, the very best part of this stylish thriller/drama comes near the beginning of the film.
206;"i love the way this ""set up"" scene is written and plays out."
207;It has a very realistic (and kind of eerie) feel to it.
208;Tony Wendice (Milland) has certainly done his homework, and that fact is conveyed to us with little doubt.
209;And he's very nearly thought of everything.
210;the moment Swan (Dawson) enters Wendice's dwelling, a subtle feeling of tension and slight uneasiness comes across the screen.
211;And he does a fine job of it too, as it turns out.
212;Dial M For Murder plays out kind of like a Sherlock Holmes mystery, Alfred Hitchcock style, with Williams in the part of Sherlock here, as he pieces together the clues to resolve the case.
213;The film looks clear, detailed, and rich in color.
214;:)Packaging is attractive and colorful, and appears to come from original 1954 artwork for the film.
215;Clips from the film are shown throughout this bonus feature, as are many behind.
216;It's a winning Hitchcock effort no matter how it's viewed.
217;this movie is one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock flicks, being firmly anchored by two highly.
218;that very intriguing lengthy early act in the picture featuring Milland and Dawson .
219;Grace Kelly is perfect in her role, as are Ray Milland and John Williams.
220;The plot is simple but captivating, and the devil is in the details (where Hitchcock shines brightest).
221;My favorite in the genre!
222;This is a fine example of the kind of mystery that little old ladies from Pasadena (or Russell Square) adore.
223;this is certainly one of Hitchcock's best, but most of the credit must go to a devilishly clever play written by Frederick Knott from which he adapted the screenplay.
224;(He also wrote the play upon which Wait Until Dark (1967) starring Audrey Hepburn was based.)
225;Hitchcock does a good job in not tinkering unnecessarily with the material.
226;He also has the exquisitely beautiful Grace Kelly to play the part of Margot Wendice.
227;ray Milland plays, with a kind of high.
228;He lends to the part a bit of Sherlock Holmesian flair.
229;One especially liked his taking a moment to comb his mustache after the case is solved.
230;For those of you who might have blinked, Hitchcock makes his traditional appearance in the photo on the wall from Tony Wendice's undergraduate days.
231;at any rate, Grace Kelly's cool and sublime bearing was on fine display here.
232;Hitchcock cloths her in discreet nightgowns and fitted (but certainly not clinging) dresses that show off her delicate figure and her exquisite arms and hint coyly at her subtle sexuality.
233;old, stunningly beautiful, and in full confidence of her ability as an actress.
234;And though Cary Grant was interested in playing the scondrel husband, Ray Milland does such a great job that one almost wants him to root for him to get away with it.
235;He belongs in the great gallery of Hitchcock villains who are suave and gentlemanly despite being dastardedly like James Mason or George Saunders.
236;"And of course, Grace Kelly, still is the epitome of beauty and elegance as she proved again in Hitch's films like ""Rear Window"" and ""To Catch A Thief"" while proving her chops as a serious actress, deglamorized, in her Oscar winning role in ""The Country Girl""."
237;I had seen this movie before but enjoyed it again.
238;The cat and mouse game between the murderer and Scotland Yard in the best part
239;But all in all it was a good movie .
240;what made the movie was Ray Miland, his good looks and dastardly charm sell the movie, the police inspector puts a smile on your face and Grace Kelly looking off into space for most of the movie wipes that smile right off.
241;I liked the frantic pace of Robert Cummings and I must back in the day this movie was filled with eye candy.
242;I liked it and I still check behind the curtains.
243;I love old movies, but this movie is still good even in 2013.
244;My expectations were high, as this is one of my favorite Hitchcock films.
245;Great storyline and wonderfully written.
246;This has been a favorite movie of mine for years.
247;The combination of Ray Milland and Grace Kelly is wonderful.
248;It is just another wonderful, exciting and entertaining movie by Alfred Hitchcock.
249;The man was a genius!
250;I do like older movies, especially Hitchcock mysteries and John Wayne Westerns and that makes me decidedly middle.
251;All I can say is that 'Dial M for Murder' is a hugely entertaining mystery that rewards the viewer who pays attention (umm, it is a mystery after all).
252;The film never gets really sharp or detailed, but starts to look decent once the film gets going, and as long as we stay inside, everything is okay.
253;definitely watchable, and looks better shown wide (in my opinion).
254;This is a great film that I feel is worth the upgrade to blu.
255;the sound is solid, and the extras okay.
256;Hitchcock was master and meticulous.
257;This is one of the great movies of all time ever one should have it in their collection.
258;Alfred Hitchcock committed many fictional murders onscreen, but I suspect he knew that few of them would plausibly work in real life.
259;the twist: Tony knows all about the affair, and he is the one who stole the letter.
260;There's a wrong woman, a MacGuffin, murder schemes, a beautiful blonde, a high.
261;it seems perfectly designed for Hitchcock's storytelling style.
262;simmering sense of suspense to the story, with events unfolding prety slowly.
263;Despite the languid pacing, he actually keeps the movie pretty lean and nimble.
264;this is probably the best performance I've yet seen from Grace Kelly .
265;Milland gives a chillingly genial performance, although Cummings is just kind of.
266;well, he's enthusiastic, but the character is an idiot.
267;burning tension and intricate plot were beautifully handled by Hitchcock .
268;and the clever subversion of the perfect crime makes a nice brain.
269;I liked it then but didn't realize that this was one of Hitchcock's best films until recently.
270;Hitchcock's immaculate rendering of the stage thriller is one of that rare breed: the underrated classic.
271;"Without significantly altering the action by ""opening it up"", Hitchcock still creates something thrillingly cinematic."
272;This has to be one of the finest stage adaptations ever.
273;It may be one of the best mysteries ever made as well.
274;Indeed, it's amazing how the play's text is riveting even when it's art.
275;Much of how this is achieved is through the stellar cast particularly Ray Milland who turns in one of the great Hitchcock performances.
276;He's really a psychopath, but completely charming and we're thankfully spared any insights into his character or motivation.
277;His scene with Anthony Dawson is mesmerizing and one of the best in all Hitchcock.
278;grace Kelly is terrific in the first half if a little wan in the later scenes.
279;John Williams is marvelous, but seems a bit stagy compared to Milland's effortless command of the screen.
280;Very good score runs throughout.
281;there are good insights in the accompanying documentary from Peter Bogdonovich and M. Night Shyamalan who comes across as an eager Hitch fanboy.
282;conscious reading of the hero is silly and clearly something he's making up on the spot.)
283;"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Dial M for Murder"" is one of his best films."
284;Based on a screenplay of the same name, by Frederick Knott, this thriller is a brilliantly directed suspense thriller.
285;As the novelist in the movie mentions, there is never a perfect murder because there is always something that is overlooked by the murderer, and this is what sets up the intriguing sequence of events that are to take place.
286;d, which was popular at the time, and this accounts for some fascinating spatial arrangements in the film.
287;There is often a heightened sense of space (even without the 3.
288;There is also a sequence whereby the camera angle is held from above the height of an imaginary roof looking down on the actors.
289;This was a clever way for Hitchcock to expand the boundaries of room as well as to create the sense of another person peering in to the proceedings unbeknownst to the characters.
290;He is like a rat in a maze, and we see everything, so it is just a matter of watching how the suspense will play out.
291;Great shots of Milland's liquor collection.
292;Now here's a character you can dislike even when he's a somewhat good guy.
293;He makes combing a mustache cool.
294;d. There's good feature about how it was done.
295;After all these years I finally got to see Kelly in 3 D. Still a good Hitchcock film today.
296;A genuine classic from Hollywood's golden age of filmmaking.
297;I finally saw this movie and loved it.
298;grace Kelly is fantasitc in her role as the murders wife.
299;I see why Hichcock loved to work with her.
300;This is just a great movie!
301;Considering that it takes place in one room, it is a masterpiece.
302;I love the old Alfred Hitchcock movies for the atmosphere, the suspense, the thrill, and a look back at a bygone age.
303;Dial M for Murder provides all of this.
304;Grace Kelly and Ray Milland are perfect in their roles.
305;The action mainly takes place in just one room giving it a feeling of foreboding and closeness that just adds to the suspense.
306;Alfred Hitchcock was fantastic because you always knew something terrible would happen, but he builds and builds and builds until it does, leaving you almost screaming in anticipation.
307;"This movie is up there with his other great thriller ""The 39 Steps"" from the 1930s."
308;Ray Milland is wonderful in a melodramatic turn in an Alfred Hitchcock film made in 1954.
309;The plot and twists are good but maybe not Hitchcock's finest in my view.
310;I think it definitely should be viewed as a period piece and a part of Hitchcock's vast collection of fine mysteries.
311;Discernible from the outset is Hitchcock's mastery.
312;a worthy goal of any mystery/horror.
313;Monologues entertain, characters bloom in complexity, and societal norms remain the subject of challenge.
314;"It looks terrific, the restoration is sharp and pristine
315;The restoration is completely faithful to the original.
316;It's suspenseful and great story.
317;He is a Senior in an art college, and does love old, good movies.
318;up drinks, and enjoyed this complex movie.
319;Amazon Prime is worth it to me in several ways.
320;Item was no longer shelved, but I received excellent, quick and easy refund!
321;I love a murder mystery when the murder part isn't shown for entertainment value, and the main part of the story is the sane people trying to work out what the insane person was trying to do when they plotted the murder.
322;the characters in this movie are great!
323;Great performance by Grace Kelly.
324;After many weeks of planning, Tony sets in motion the perfect plan to kill his wife.
325;this is a classic of suspense from director Alfred Hitchcock, based upon a very successful stage play.
326;all give fine performances, but Milland's as Tony Wendice is a standout.
327;You're instantly won over by his conniving charm, and I admit to following his plan with a tiny bit of satisfaction.
328;top, remaining perfectly cool and collected even when things go awry.
329;As with the play, much of the action takes place in that small space, and Hitchcock uses it to his advantage with intricate staging and camera angles.
330;Even as a flat screen movie, the film works perfectly.
331;This movie is a genuine pleasure to watch and should be part of any movie buff's collection.
332;Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 adaptation was the first and certainly the best one even if the master himself considered it one of his lesser efforts.
333;Dial M for Murder will be remembered as Hitchcock's first color film and the first of three thrillers he had made with Grace Kelly, the future Princess of Monaco, in the prime of her beauty and her talent.
334;Using color proved to be very effective in the film.
335;His plan is perfect and almost works but Margot managed to not only escape the murderer but to turn the table on him while stunned Wendice is on the phone and listens how his well thought of plan collapses.
336;Wendice is very resourceful and he proved to be a master of improvisation because it took him a few minutes in a cab to switch to a plan B that turned a terrified victim Margot into a cold.
337;It breathes and moves freely and we almost forget that we are in the same room for close to two hours.
338;I would not call """"Dial M for Murder"""" my favorite Hitchcock's film but it is enjoyable, clever, and witty thriller with the interesting twists, outstanding performances, and more than one truly memorable scenes."""
339;both Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings, as the faithless wife and her mild.
340;mannered lover, give enjoyable performances, but the real success of the film is Ray Milland, who brings a slightly oily charm to his role of murderous husband.
341;d, and although the scene in which star Grace Kelly confronts her attacker is justly famous, the film is essentially a meticulous recreation of the stage success rather than a Hitchcock original.
342;d format, so we might see how effectively Hitchcock handled the requirements of the form.
343;It might very well breathe new life into an old favorite.
344;The plot line is obviously a great one but these actors are why we watch movies.
345;the script in this one absolutely highlights some of the top dialogue performances in the Hitchcock run.
346;Have fun and enjoy this classic
347;Classic Alfred Hitchcock for mystery and suspense, a great who dunit.
348;Classic characters and Grace Kelly is the best.
349;If you enjoy watching classic movies add this to your collection.
350;There is crosstalk all over the place, including the opening credits.
351;the movie itself is decent as far as the story.
352;Dial M for Murder is #4 on my list of Hitchcock's 5 best movies .
353;it's got more talk and less action than other movies, but it's very well acted and has a good plot with a twist or two.
354;After Psycho, this is one of my favorite Hitchcock movies.
355;I've seen it many times and still love watching it.
356;If you've never seen this movie, it's well worth the time to do so.
357;Ray Milland is chilling as the husband with devious motives and, of course, Grace Kelly is beautiful as ever.
358;Best character is the inspector, who solves the mystery but still has a sense of humor.
359;Since the entire film is mostly in one room, it's interesting to see where Hitchcock shows up in his famous cameos.
360;Everyone should watch this movie It is a wonderful movie.
361;One of the best in the alfred hitchcock collection.
362;I've watched this before, It's a classic.
363;It's nice to remember the way films were made with you imagination taking over, with the music causing the suspense.
364;To be enjoyed on a rainy or Sunday afternoon.
365;Hitchcock is a master at suspense, and the acting is first class!
366;It is just so entertaining.
367;Love Grace Kelly she was one of my all time favorites.
368;This is saying nothing about the actual story and Hitchcock's directing, which is just as good.
369;Ray Milland is particularly creepy, and Grace Kelly is gorgeous as ever.
370;Had it's moments of suspense.
371;I think the problem is growing up watching shows like Law and Order or CSI interferes with the enjoyment.
372;Thrilling, suspenseful and one of Hitchcock's best.
373;Great story line and, of course, the incomparable Grace Kelly is absolutely gorgeous.
374;This version of the movie is so much better than the more recent one
375;One of Alfred Hitcock's greatest films .
376;the English detective won 'all the marbles''
377;A Classic in every sense of the word!
378;DIAL M FOR MURDER shows Mr. Hitchcock as his best as he leads the viewer down one labyrinth after another with much style and intelligence.
379;The acting is fine, particularly that of John Williams who plays Chief Inspector Hubbard, who solves the crime as only a dry, detached British police officer can.
380;Although Grace Kelly is billed as one of the stars, she spends a great deal of the movie time off camera on death row.
381;I'm happy to announce that almost dying becomes her as she is just as refined and beautiful when she leaves the prison as before she went into it.
382;is entertainment at its very best.
383;What a great Hitchcock film.
384;It keeps you on the edge of your seat.
385;Great twist at the end.
386;This is a great movie.
387;I recorded it on TV kind of randomly but I am so happy I saw this film.
388;the remarkable point is interesting since it demonstrates that nobody is innocent , but less guilty .
389;all in theory seems to work out in a perfect level , but as always the human factor appears struggling the neck to the anticipated destiny.
390;grace Kelly is extraordinary and to me , she never was best in any other Hitchcock film .
391;and once the camera working around the hall in almost the eighty per cent of the film is another remarkable asp ct to celebrate .
392;the close up resource is perfect .
393;Hitchock was always a master in this sense .
394;one of my timeless favorites .
395;d version is worth the price of the disc.
396;For Alfred Hitchcock fans this is a good movie.
397;What a lot of fun!
398;It was not my favorite of his, but I really enjoyed it.
399;i am always impressed when a movie can keep your attention for almost 2 hours when the action barely leaves one single room.
400;Good acting, good directing, plot and story, etc.
401;And I loved the ending!
402;The Complete 1st Season, with the great Dick Van Dyke!I was watching the special features, and the one thing I did not agree on was that we, the audience, were supposed to root for the husband.
403;Bob Cummings as the boyfriend was not the most interesting guy ever, nor the most handsome, but I got the impression that he loved Margot a lot more and was a lot kinder to her than the husband, and that was enough for me.
404;Hitchcock builds a whole crime story and its suspense on one single element : the brand new latch keys that appeared after the second world war that, as an inspector says, all look alike.
405;He is a great talker and a very good liar, so we do discover how his mind works full time on inventing new stories and explanations that are all false but cannot be proved so.
406;Rather entertaining, and be sure Alfred Hitchcock managed to set his mug in one or two frames : look for him having some side.
407;kicks in his own film.
408;Pretty much a straightforward filming of the play, done when Hitchcock was out of ideas for another film.
409;One wonders what shape the source material was in.
410;It still kept my attention.
411;I have always enjoyed movies from this era.
412;I enjoyed every minute of this transfer.
413;ray to be one of the best out there.
414;There are so many little touches here and there in this film that I am greatly impressed.
415;I hope future releases look as great as this film did.
416;A great Hitchcock classic that everyone should see.
417;Alfred Hitchcock did a magnificent job.
418;Grace Kelly and Ray Milland are great actors.
419;This suspense thriller about a man who tries to blackmail a criminal into murdering his unfaithfull wife, is one of my all time favorite Hitchcock films.
420;I rank it along side such classics as Rebecca, and Suspicion.
421;One of the most unique things about this film is that it's filmed very much like a stage play.
422;It wouldn't work for some movies but it suits this one perfectly.
423;Frequent Hitchcock leading lady, Grace Kelly is ideally cast as the aloof but sexy would.
424;Ray Milland is at his best as the smooth as silk, but villianous leading man.
425;Robert Cummings (best known for tv's Love that Bob), proves to be just as capable at drama as comedy, as Kelly's charming American lover.
426;This is a must see for any Hitchcock fan.
427;If you liked A Perfect Murder with Gwenyth Paltrow and Michael Douglas, you'll love the original by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Grace Kelley.
428;Great story and it doesn't get dull like some other older movies do.
429;I actually never heard of this one but it was a good one.
430;Wonderful classic movie with great dialog.
431;Other than that the movie was great and the color was great.
432;I liked it a lot
433;But it's fun to add this one to my collection.
434;Cummings is acceptable and Kelly is first rate, per usual.
435;You never see a Grace Kelly type character in modern films completely dominated by the men in her life.
436;This is a fascinating movie in several ways.
437;It's a good story, well and entertainingly told by Hitchcock.
438;His use of the cameras, pacing and interesting angles keeps the viewer from being bored and the actors are very easy to look at as well.
439;It's done so cleverly that you don't realize until afterwards that your own reactions have changed constantly through the film.
440;Milland is a top athlete, a sponger, a cuckolded husband, an unfaithful blackguard, a cunning schemer and blackmailer, an unlucky victim of circumstance, a brilliant improvisor, a dastardly liar and finally, believe it or not, a good loser!
441;I can think of no other director capable of creating such an array of aspects to one character and yet have the character seem perfectly consistent throughout.
442;there is also the fascination of watching the acting conventions of the day, when 'naturalistic' acting wasn't in vogue.
443;the twist at the end is one of the best in movies and the excellent John Williams, in his finest role, does a wonderful job of setting it up.
444;A very good film, not perhaps a tour.
445;force as are some of Hitchcock's movies, but in its way every bit as effective.
446;The casting is inspired, with Milland the essence of oily smugness as Tony, and Williams blandly British as Hubbard.
447;Hunter and quarry thus play off each other perfectly.
448;She is beautiful as always, so that the very concept of doing away with her seems particularly outrageous.
449;And simply stated the 2D version looks amazing.
450;The colors are gorgeous and detail is superb.
451;This is an amazing movie by the greatest director in film history.
452;If you are a fan of Hitchcock, or movies in general for that matter, I highly recommend it.
453;This is a very nice movie, but it is presented in Standard or Fullscreen format.
454;the widescreen version of this movie is a lot better.
455;Even though I have seen it multiple times and know who did it and how they caught him, I still enjoy the acting by the excellent ensemble cast and the way that the story moves so tightly toward its conclusion.
456;Just some quick thoughts on this Alfred Hitchcock classic.
457;The acting is good and Hitchcock's direction is superb.
458;if you want to watch a suspenseful movie that's entertaining, then I highly recommend Dial M For Murder.
459;Great to see a Hitchcock classic re released in both formats on blu ray.
460;An excellent script well presented with a stellar cast.
461;"A great little retrospective documentary (21 minutes)
462;d technology (7 minutes)"
463;Listening to director M. Night Shyamalan's detailed and extensive appreciation of the film was a particular treat during the documentary.
464;Fresh faces and fresh perspectives elevate these extra features from pleasant additions to must.
465;"With his typical understatement, director Alfred Hitchcock describes his efforts on another masterpiece, Dial M for Murder"", adapted from a famous stage play by author Fredrick Knott."
466;"with the assistance and urging of an attractive ""island girl"" who is the product of his daydreams."
467;Surely, there are film historians and Hitchcock scholars capable of providing such a track.
468;the PROS:The Film: Story, cast, and direction are all first rate.
469;"menu Navigation: Menus are attractive and easy to navigate, with the ""added fun"" of depicting the ""cursor"", used to select the various options, as a PAIR OF SCISSORS!"
470;Those familiar with the film cannot help but smile at this little touch.
471;"extra Features:""Hitchcock and Dial M"" (Runs 21:33)."
472;"a ""making of"" documentary, that nicely covers the film, given the lack of a true commentary track."
473;"Oddly, it is the relative ""youngster"" Shyamalan who makes the most interesting and enthusiastic comments of the group."
474;Dial M for Murder is shot in an unusual way (.
475;Again, I thought this was just the director's flair.
476;"i naturally thought that this was in keeping with ""Dial M for Murder's"" origins as a STAGE PLAY."
477;"but this process required both projectors to be ""in service"" at the same time!)"
478;"theatrical Trailer for ""Dial M for Murder""Golden Age Hollywood Movie Trailers were a unique art form all their own, and Warner Bros. made some of the best!"
479;overall:This is a great film with a good selection of Extra Features.
480;It is recommended for Hitchcock, murder, and suspense fans, and enthusiasts of the mid.
481;If you've been thinking about getting acquainted with the classics, this is a good place to start.
482;This was an excellent movie at a great price!
483;I will always continue to order from Amazon!
484;it's probably my third favorite Hitchcock film.
485;Great movie, one for your collection!
486;I like Hitchcock's employment of 3.
487;This was somehow totally unexpected but truly fine.
488;It's a good film, although not one of Hitchcock's best, but even mediocre Hitchcock is better than almost anything most director's put out.
489;"I'm hearing that ""Dial M"" will look better on Blu."
490;ray than it ever has looked.
491;Just two lines for a well directed and acted movie.
492;old is gold and kudos to he entire team.
493;VERY happy with the movie I received.
494;Classic movies like this always deliver.
495;The movie seems very straight foreword but actually surprises the viewer many times.
496;Truly a classic mystery movie if I ever saw one.
497;hitchcock displayed brilliant directorial skills as the film keeps its claustrophobic atmosphere while the camera remains in the center of the Wendice living room throughout most of the film.
498;dial M for Murder offers a terrific cinematic experience as it offers both suspense and some issues to ponder.
499;The details and depth of the film that truly enhance the cinematic experience are directly related to Hitchcock's input on what should be in the mise.
500;scene is absolutely marvelous as it offers detailed information about the characters and adds suspenseful intrigue and surprise.
501;This is one of Hitchcock's most carefully crafted films.
502;In my opinion, one of his best.
503;The acting is well done and the story line keeps you thinking but knowing you must watch it unfold
504;This is a good Hitchcock movie, the plot is simple.
505;"The twists and spinning of tangled webs eventually catches up with Tony
506;Dial M For Murder takes place almost entirely within the confines of one room, breezes by in two acts, contains very little action, features only five characters of any real significance, and yet it feels absolutely epic.
507;Be still, my beating heart!)
508;A clever and calculating man, Wendice orchestrates a brilliant scheme that, if executed properly, will leave his wife dead and him with an airtight alibi.
509;He's a villain that's fun to root for"
510;milland and Williams steal the show here.
511;Their performances are understated but brilliant.
512;Each man is dapper, witty, and charismatic, and they convey a charming sort of arrogance, an awareness of and admiration for their own cleverness.
513;We loved this oldie for its old fashioned story telling, suspense, and great ending.
514;It made for an memorable evening!
515;Again the classics are so wonderfully written.
516;Grace, with her cool blond looks, and Ray, dark, suave, saturnine, lit up the screen with intrigue.
517;Mystery and suspense at it's best.
518;Ageless and still some of the best acting there was.
519;milland and Kelly great together.
520;I know it is a great picture but I don't know how it got in this list.
521;It's really a major event.
522;"There is one startling effect, during the opening credits, where the words ""Directed by Alfred Hitchcock"" pop out of the screen and seem to float 3 feet in front of the TV."
523;I understand there are 50 of them and I want them all!
524;If you haven't seen the film before, there are some twists and it's certainly worthy of a viewing.
525;I'm not a big Hitchcock fan, but this was a nice film.
526;One of Alfred Hitchcock's classic films.
527;Ray Milland is exceptionally good.
528;"Dimitry Tiomkin was one of the finest Hollywood film composers
529;This is a great murder mystery.
530;Ray Milland is terrific as the cunning and manipulative husband out for the ultimate revenge.
531;Grace Kelly is just, well, she's Grace Kelly"
532;"I watch this and ""The Uninvited"" together."
533;Intriguing, and charming old Hollywood mystery and murder flick.
534;The original film, starring Grace Kelly and Ray Milland still far superior than any remake.
535;All performances and suspensful direction, Hitchcock style, outstanding.
536;"This movie is much better that the remake ""The Perfect Murder""."
537;Its a great film, however throughout the film, there is alot of ghosting of images.
538;Dial M for Murder is one of Hitchcock's best.
539;It is by far, Ray Milland's best screen performance.
540;The color is brilliant, the sound is crisp and well.
541;balanced, and, as I said at the onset, the film itself is an excellent suspense thriller.
542;It adds very little to the enjoyment of the movie.
543;It a old movie with a good plot.
544;The actors performance was excellent .
545;That is the reason why he decides that asking someone to kill his beautiful and very rich wife is a good idea.
546;And will he succeed?If you really want to know the answers to those questions, and enjoy a well.
547;If you like the old tried and true classic mystery, this is a great one.
548;If you like Ray Milland, this is a good performance with typical Hitchcock twists.
549;No technological extravaganza, just good entertainment to share with friends and a bowl of popcorn!
550;Grace Kelly, then at the very peak of her career, plays the spouse to elegant perfection.
551;But the leading man is so convincing .
552;Milland is so archly smooth that most observers are pulled along.
553;That reflected its' stage origin.
554;DMM is a perfect example of a basic detective story raised several levels by a talented cast, deft staging and a great Director.
555;It is incredible that in 1954, movie makers created such a thought provoking plot that would be copied by others many decades later.
556;this is another master piece by Hitchcock that is worth watching and having.
557;A real classic Hitchcock Movie, a must see, all his movies are great the Rear window was my favorite make these movies your favorite too!
558;In fact it is more like a stage play, but a good one with good actors.
559;Still a weaker Hitch film still has many fine elements and camera angles that are very good.
560;They will sell and should be out for the rest of us to enjoy.
561;A decent little mystery story.
562;It's wonderful to see it fully restored in its original wide.
563;"Hitchcock established himself as a cinematic master with the 1930 ""Juno and the Paycock,"" his second sound movie, where most of the action takes place within one room."
564;All of this works well in 2D, but becomes a new cinematic experience with the addition of depth.
565;The film has been perfectly restored, with stunningly beautiful color and accurate stereo imaging.
566;Kudos to Warner Brothers for taking on this ambitious project!
567;This movie was beautifully cast.
568;Ray Milland's performance is worth watching this movie.
569;He did it with a good story,good acting and great directing.
570;In these days of computer generated battles in space and earth shaking surround sound, it's refreshing to find a throwback to the kind of mystery which involves the viewer and makes him think.
571;He wants to be rid of her and he's smooth and devious and calculating, and what he comes up with is both brilliant and complicated.
572;smarmy lover, and his character, a mystery writer, adds an important plot element.
573;the cinematic style is thoroughly Hitchcock, which means it's a little dated and flat.
574;footed by today's norms, and the characters are always perfectly dressed and groomed.
575;In this case, it works, as the viewer can be absorbed into the story without being distracted by details.
576;Hitchcock evidently understood that it could be used to engage the viewer and more bring him into the scenes and settings, and it is always subtle.
577;A frequent device is the use of something in the foreground with the characters behind, like a row of bottles or a lamp.
578;It's an involving story in which the viewer finds himself in a small room with a small cast of characters as a complicated and devious plot unfolds.
579;First of all about the movie itself: this is good, if not great, Hitchcock.
580;It's very entertaining if a bit stage bound, and the performances are uniformly fine.
581;I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the team at Warner Brothers had actually gone back and re.
582;up, I took the plunge and bought it.
583;This is borne out by the title sequence, which is so sharp that it looks like it was photographed yesterday.
584;One piece of advice I can give to anyone considering purchasing this Blu.
585;mastering team has done a fantastic job of restoring critical image registration, but they can't do anything about Hitchcock's penchant for using process shots for exteriors.
586;Movie is an excellent Hitchcock mystery !
587;One fine film and suspenseful.
588;and Grace Kelly were outstanding.
589;It is a great movie.
590;So I will talk about the disc.
591;The disc came early and in perfect shape.
592;The atmosphere of the play is perfect for Hitchcock.
593;this was Grace's year with her Oscar winning performance in The Country Girl and another Hitchcock triumph in Rear Window.
594;With her outstanding performance here, she definitely was the star of the year.
595;d, then you will enjoy this.
596;This is a highly intreging, cleaverly constructed thriller with fantastic, sometimes sinister performances from all 3 central players.
597;(Grace Kelly is stunning as well as exuding a sultry innocence).
598;The film relies on intense, absorbing script which works on all levels and is thoroughly entertaining.
599;hitchcock at his 1950s best!
600;This is an awesome movie that will forever be a classic fright night flick at my house!
601;This Hitchcock has always intriged me for several reasons.
602;The way He fit all the pieces of this complex mystery so perfectly in place IS kind of hillarious, however, the aspect of this film that most overlook is the rich, luscious color!
603;This puppy is a beauty!
604;This classic Alfred Hitchcock never gets old.
605;probably my 30th time, and thoroughly enjoyed myself.
606;This is another one of my favorites, I love the flow of the movie, Ray Milland and Grace Kelly where so good in this film.
607;Omg, i forgot see if you can spot Alfred Hitchcock.
608;Love Hitchcock movies and this one tops the list!
609;Watching the husband trying to keep the investigation off track is so entertaining.
610;How clever will he be at keeping the truth at bay?
611;"Like Hitchcock's ""Rope"", this film pretty much sticks to one set ."
612;Some pixelization and shimmering of fine details is detected also.
613;The audio is mono but nicely cleaned up.
614;Great actors actress with a devious crafted plot .
615;Gwenyth and Michael take a look at the real deal.
616;The Bottom Line:Dial M for Murder is much better in its first half than in the predictable conclusion and it can feel a bit stagey at times, but Milland is delicious and the Master's direction is inspired: it's not one of Hitch's best, but it's a solid film.
617;He totally dominates and patronizes her.
618;Better to enjoy To Catch a Thief for spark.
619;an interesting watch, though, just to see the interplay between Kelly and Milland, who fell in love during filming.
620;Oh, well, some day her prince will come.
621;This is in color, mostly like a filmed play.
622;the angle of the viewing pyramid from eye to screen.

626;As I said earlier, this is the quintessential Milland, and he plays the part of Tony with such relish and aplomb, that before you know it, you find yourself rooting for the cad"

628;"Dial M has always been one of my favorite Hitchcock films
629;For other examples see the superlative """"Rope"""" with James Stewart, and what is probably the most extreme example, the magnificent """"Lifeboat"""" with Tallulah Bankhead."""
630;"As you watch the film ""flat"" you'll notice that the camera often moves around the room looking ""up"" at the cast, and there's invariably a piece of furniture, a dresser or a table with a vase on it for instance, between the actor and the audience."

639;Wendice has discovered that his wealthy wife has been unfaithful with an American writer played by Robert Cummings.
640;Ray Milland is magnificent and Grace Kelly is superb.
641;This made me a Milland fan and I have since ordered more movies with him.
642;It is a great movie.
643;'Dial M for Murder' has many of the touches that one associates with Hitchcock, mainly, his masterly use of building up suspense and the way he makes you side with the villain, despite yourself.
644;Ray Milland is convincing as the charming but devious husband who attempts to murder his wife, Grace Kelly, who makes a compelling and sympathetic victim.

647;"Not quite ""up there"" with Hitchcock's best, but an excellent film nevertheless."
648;DIAL M FOR MURDER is an Alfred Hitchcock classic about a man who is trying to have his unfaithful wife murdered for her wealth.
649;Ray Milland does a superb job in the role of the scheming husband.
650;like the movie 1954 wow hitchcock is good.
651;good story, good actors, will rewatch it.
652;He was a World Class Director that made English and American Classic Films.
653;The First One, that I feel started his Style was The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog of 1926.
654;i read several reviews of this film and they varied greatly.
655;Lot's of suspense, interesting situations.
656;Grace Kelly, always gorgeous and perfectly couffed and beautifully decked out.
657;This is one of the best movies of all time in my opinion.
658;Acting is much better than average.
659;The movie started out a bit slow, but rolled into and edge.
660;Ray Milland's acting was brilliant.
661;i will have to watch it again.
662;Dial M for Murder is an excellent movie.
663;Grace Kelly is wonderful as Margot Wendice, the beautiful and rich but somewhat nave wife.
664;in the end it is another well done movie by Alfred Hitchcock.
665;Odds are that if you like Hitchcock you will like this move.
666;I find it's a great film, and I loved it!
667;Grace was beautiful as always, and Ray Milland did an excellent job as the villain of the film.
668;The plot was engrossing, and did I mention Grace Kelly was beautiful?
669;seat Hitchock suspense film, its probably best that you look for Vertigo, Rear Window or North by Northwest instead.
670;But give Dial M For Murder a chance, and be ready to enjoy a great film, definitely deserving of a five star rating!
671;Hitchcock is a classic and this is a great film.
672;Something I always wanted to see that I never got a chance to.
673;Happy I watched it and it was free on prime.
674;A Hitchcock classic, very well done and Grace Kelly.
675;This movie is a rare treat, and one worth the time to whoever gets the chance to check it out.
676;Hitchcock at his best here, making the most of a story which was originally intended for the stage.
677;This is a film I have checked every video store for, and am happy that amazon.
678;com has made it available.
679;I'm a fan of Hitchcock movies and consider this movie one of his beast thrillers.
680;"The suspense is based on a ""brain."
681;This is a suspessful movie , and the acting is superb .
682;I love Hitchcock's EVERY movie (practically).
683;This is another Hitchcock classic murder/mystery movie at its best.
684;The color and realistic London sets are perfect for drawing in the audience.
685;It is a must see.
686;Dial M for Murder is one of my fav Hitchcock films.
687;I'm surprised that this is getting so many high ratings.
688;It has never been considered one of Hitchcock's best films despite the minimal presence of Grace Kelly.
689;Hitchcock was, in my opinion, the greatest filmmaker of all time, but his virtues were overwhelmingly visual, not verbal.
690;the fact is that most film viewers are focused merely on whether a story is interesting.
691;The performances of the actors are all good and the plot is fun, but as a Hitchcock film, it is one of his least interesting.
692;The screenplay makes it perhaps more entertaining than another stagey film, ROPE, but the technical challenges of that other film at least make it more interesting from a technical standpoint.
693;Tony, done by Ray Milland in outstanding performance, is icily intense and incredibly wild.
694;He is easily the best of the three.
695;grace Kelly is the smart but vulnerable Margot.
696;Kelly is ing nue enough to be sympathetic but also tough enough to be respected.
697;He is the weakest cast member bringing so little to the table.
698;john Williams is excellent as the dangerous murder weapon tricked by a clever scoundrel.
699;anthony Dawson is absolutely brilliant, delightful as the eccentric Chief Inspector watching how the easy.
700;milland, a genteel charmer with an icy murderous side, is perfect as Tony Wendice.
701;If ever there was a demonstration of venality, Milland's Tony Wendice was it: courteous on the outside, devious on the inside.
702;We see his cheery domestic manner with his wife.
703;There is something chilling about the way in which Milland operates in these scenes: Once Swan arrives, the polite smile never leaves Milland's face as he switches gears from exchanging pleasantries to blackmail and murder.
704;'Dial M for Murder' holds its grip pretty well.
705;It never reaches the heights that 'Rear Window' did, but it has to be one of the most brilliant stage thrillers ever written.
706;The score, composed by Dimitri Tiomkin, is both eerie and precarious.
707;Dial M for Murder is a film that makes you pay attention.
708;I greatly enjoyed the 2D version of this film in the past.
709;zapping passive glasses, like in the theaters) and see such classics as this as they were originally intended.
710;Had never seen before and loved it.
711;My favorite Hitchcock movie .
712;keeps you at the edge of your seat.
713;as for swapping Cummings and Milland, that's an adventurous thought that MIGHT have worked.
714;A second adventurous change that might have improved the movie would have been to let the viewers see the would.
715;As an old man I can say that Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors ever.
716;his technique of the one room, character helping character come out, every prop important and all for the sake of the story is fantastic.
717;the set is a set up for all Hitchcock's fun.
718;The acting is 50's, but mostly good 50's and good to look at to remember that there is more to mystery than action.
719;Very well done adaption of the play.
720;Ray Milland was great as the husband, the entire cast was superb.
721;A must see for any Hitchcock fan or lover of a good suspense movie.
722;I saw this excellent film in 3.
723;As for the movie itself, it is a true classic, having been directed by the great Hitchcock.
724;And, it had a terrific cast, which included the beautiful Grace Kelly, so what more could you want.
725;I watched the movie as a silent film, because I wanted to see it in 3.
726;I give the film itself four stars, and I give it four stars for the effective use of stereoscopic photography.
727;I absolutely loved this movie.
728;the movie is presented well.
729;Overall, a good, solid disc.
730;One of my favorite movies of all time.
731;The all star cast was great.
732;A must see among the classics.
733;and so he shot a lot of the film with that in mind.
734;In fact she plays second fiddle to the plot: an amazing play on action and suspense.
735;hitch sets up the audience .
736;Milland's character exudes this brilliance and competence .
737;1 and 2] is the visiting American writer .
738;not a lot to love about this guy although his ability to figure out that there is no such thing as a perfect murder and even goes so far as to explain to Milland's character the very way he actually attempted the deed is amazing.
739;getting his wife thrown in prison to be executed sounds like a great way to get out of it!Brilliantly filmed in high saturated color, the cinematography with the pans and the minimalist shots and camera angles and the fact that it was all shot pretty much in one room is amazing to watch.
740;There's an interview with M. Night ShyamalanUnbreakable (Two.
741;up and suspending the resolution of the crime and the smooth sleuthing of John Williams' character make this movie the top Hitchcock film for me.
742;Nevertheless, director Alfred Hitchcock utilizes the 3.
743;Despite slow pacing and theatrical claustrophobia, the performances sustain interest.
744;Grace Kelly looks stunning in 3.
745;first off, i am a huge Hitchcock fan, but even non fans will find this movie suspensful and very fun to watch.
746;the lead roles are played beautifully by milland and kelly.
747;hitch's trademark of letting us, the viewer, in on the important plot point, while the characters have no idea what is going on, creates a lot of tension.
748;great way to spend the day.
749;The suspense is always gripping, no matter how many times I've seen it.
750;Highly recommend this great movie.
751;I haven't seen this film in years but just love it.
752;I had forgotten what a good movie it is.
753;I will most certainly enjoy watching it.
754;This is classic Hitchcock, and is one of Grace Kelly's best roles.
755;"Alfred Hitchcock wasn't called the ""Master of Suspense"", for nothing and while 1954's ""Dial M For Murder"", is probably not his best remembered work, the film contains so many wonderful elements that work together to make a great thriller that it deserves to be included in the pantheon of Hitchcock greats along with the likes of ""Rebecca"", ""Rear Window"", North by NorthWest"", and ""Psycho""."
756;Hitchcock has taken a story very much betraying it's stage origins and managed without opening it out greatly for the screen to create an intriguing story that would hold movie audiences attention.
757;The way he manages to make the apartment and its outside stairwell an integral part of the action, with it almost taking on a life of it's own is pure Hitchcock genius that in the hands of a lesser director would have seemed purely claustrophobic.
758;"Working with his favourite actress in Grace Kelly, here all cool elegance but with a strong inner sensuality as was her trademark, Hitchcock is also totally at home with his favourite theme of well thought out murder and has a field day with the story and visual potential of ""Dial M For Murder""."
759;ray Milland had I feel one of his very best roles as Tony Wendice, the very charming villian who plans the perfect murder only to see it go rather messingly wrong.
760;Despite planning his own wife's cold blooded murder his character comes off the most interesting and multi dimensional of all the leads.
761;His superb scene where he sets up the scenerio by black mailing Charles Swann really reveals Ray Milland's finely tuned ability to play a very likeable and suave villian even when he is plotting the murder of his wife.
762;Grace Kelly had one of her most famous roles in this movie and once again the magic between herself and favourite director Alfred Hitchcok sparked with Kelly's cool patrician looks and demeanour combining perfectly with Hitchcock's style of directing.
763;Grace Kelly always revealed more of herself than just the cool beauty under Hitchcock's direction and for her efforts here she was awarded the New York Film Critics Award.
764;Supporting performances in this small cast are few and th eonly one of note is the always excellent John Williams in his all important role of Chief Insp. Hubbard.
765;A Hitchcock regular over many years, Williams brings the correct level of urbane charm and underlying determination to make a memorable and at times highly amusing Chief Inspector.
766;Hitchcock was wise to not greatly alter the acclaimed stage play and he has preserved the most suspenseful elements in the play such as the ongoing saga of the latchkey and who is in possession of it's duplicates.
767;Appropriate importance is placed throughout the film's running time by Hitchcock on this one key and it's importance as a clue that unravels the whole case finally for the Chief Inspector.
768;Certainly among his other genius Hitchcock was always expert in displaying his cast and in particular his leading ladies to the best effect on screen and Grace Kelly really came into her own in this elegant colour production superbly made up and gowned so that she did look like a real life princess a few years before she actually became one.
769;Dimitri Tiomkin's evocative score is also highly suitable for this very wordy thriller and reaches its emotional peak during the still disturbing and justly famous murder sequence in the apartment.
770;Grace Kelly's attempted murder scene still however packs a real punch and is probably one of the most well known and most often repeated sequences from any Hitchcock effort.
771;Dial M for Murder, has so much to recommend it to lovers of suspense from a veteran director in top form, to at least two leading actors perfectly cast in roles tailor made for them.
772;Thrillers and investigation stories dont come much better than they do here and every lover of Alfred Hitchcock and his directing genius should have this superb film in their collections.
773;I love it's twists and turns.
774;It keeps you interested to the very end.
775;I wolud recommend this to everyone who likes any of Hitchcock type movies.
776;Neatly woven into an excellent finale.
777;We were very happy to watch this again and have it on hand for those nights when Cable TV disappoints.
778;It is another classic Hitchcock.
779;Dial M for Murder, (1954), is a rather early film by the celebrated, greatly talented Anglo.
780;american director of mysteries and thrillers, Alfred Hitchcock (Vertigo (Collector's Edition),To Catch a Thief,North by Northwest).
781;DIAL M clocks in at a brisk 105 minutes, and is considered a classic psychological thriller by most.
782;The sly Scotland Yard inspector, Chief Inspector Hubbard, is played by John Williams.
783;hitchcock, of course, knows how to create suspense, and the plots he comes up with are satisfyingly complex.
784;"Ray Milland inhabits the role of the Machiavellian and cynical Tony Wendice with total believability
785;Cummings had a nice, relaxed, guy next door vibe, but I strongly doubt that he was ever so attractive to any woman as to cause her to risk her marriage to a glamorous figure such as Milland plays.
786;Frankly, much as I admire Hitchcock's great later thrillers, on re.
787;d technology is readily available (see, for example, the ultimate 3.
788;d version as a bonus feature"
789;d as a very significant added bonus!)
790;Not Hitchcock's best but surely a smartly done film in the usual Hitchcock style.
791;A hand coming out of the screen with a key near the end, and the hand with the scissors.
792;The depth inside the screen was great.
793;Dial M had a great picture compared to house of wax.
794;If the dual strip they made house from is the only copy it is going to need a ton of work.
795;Hitchcock is a director you can always rely on to give you something thought provoking.
796;A man concocts a flawless plan to have his cheating wife murdered.
797;It's very fun to try and catch the mistake he's made and see if he did in fact cover up everything.
798;There is a very minimal amount of sets and characters, and a considerable amount of dialogue.
799;ray Milland is excellent as the husband who is trying to off his wife.
800;John Williams also plays a great supporting role as the Inspector.
801;the ending is both satisfactory, and yet strange.
802;A great conclusion, but their reactions are a bit odd.
803;But it doesn't ruin it for me, it's still a fantastic suspense story.
804;Keep your eyes peeled for what may be Hitchcock's briefest and most subtle cameos yet.
805;This was the classic film and it was in 3.
806;The copy was an excellent reproduction.
807;I have started a small alfred Hitchcock collection and Im very happy I selected this item.
808;Thank you for a fast delivery as well.
809;Taut, tense and superbly acted, this Hitchcock thriller has earned its well known reputation.
810;It's a love triangle and a murder plot gone wrong, but with the master director at the helm that's what makes this film so right!
811;Love the camera framing/angles and bold use of primary color saturation.
812;Hitchcock stereotypes women as emotional and men as thoughtful and emotionless.
813;I love Hitchcock films and this is one of my personal favorites!
814;My nine year old niece is an Alfred Hitchcock fan.
815;We both thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it was in color!
816;This movie had great dialogue and a great cast with Hitchcock's direction was a great watch.
817;I recommend it to those you like old fashioned movies.
818;It actually goes beyond that to double image.
819;One of the most striking scenes is the one where Margot and Mark are talking in the livigroom.
820;Margot's hand is resting on the end table in the extreme foreground, showing off that beautiful diamond ring.
821;time favorite Alfred Hitchcock movies.
822;I think that Grace Kelly is a wonderful actress that really fit the part.
823;Alfred Hitchcock has made some of the best suspense movies out there.
824;an elegant film with no wasted motion.
825;Much of the credit has to go to the screenplay, which was by the author who wrote the play Dial M for Murder.
826;And what a superb play it is!The acting is uniformly top.
827;d, but Hitchcock sometimes placed something in the foreground and had the action take place in the background to enhance the depth of the cinemaphotography.
828;d it introduces a somewhat distancing effect.
829;Still, Hitchcock's talent shines through as he keeps you engrossed in the action.
830;very nice to add to Hitchcock collection.
831;While almost the whole thing is shot in a single room, it's one of those perfect movies where everything pays off and the plot keeps you interested throughout.
832;Although the movie does not have as much mystery, suspense, or action as many of Hitch's other films, it does feature terrific acting, a good plot, and great direction, editing, and cinematography.
833;Ray Milland and Grace Kelly put in terrific performances.
834;The ending, while not as famous as those in North by Northwest or Strangers on a Train, is so casual that I think it ranks as one of the best, if not the best, of all Hitch endings.
835;Every time you watch it you pick up new clues.
836;Very clever camera angles add to the appeal
837;I have always been and always will be a Hitchcock fan.
838;This was one of his masterpieces always with the beautiful blond.
839;This classic film is and will always be a masterpiece.
840;Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 color movie Dial M for Murder is one of those movies that you can watch again and again.
841;After 51 years Dial M for Murder still shines with class and great British style that never grows old.
842;John Williams is excellent as the dapper, low keyed Chief Inspector Hubbard.
843;The casting for this movie is just perfect.
844;Ray Milland oozes charm and sometimes menace as his Tony Wendice character purposefully manipulates those around him to become part of his diabolical scheme for the perfect crime.
845;Dawson has the perfect slightly swarmy look for this role as a seasoned petty con man who finds himself caught up in a game he never expected to play.
846;He soon understands that he must comply with Wendice's wishes.
847;this is the kind of movie that has you holding your breath.
848;Most of the action takes place in one room and the camera works magic with its corner and overhead shots.
849;There are close ups of inanimate objects that are integral to the plot.
850;this movie is definitely a must.
851;A gripping thriller which my family loved to watch.
852;The plot is convincing to the end.
853;A story to always make you think.
854;Hitchcock is a great storyteller and one of my favorite Ray Milland and Grace Kelly movies.
855;I ordered this for my brother.
856;I think it is the best performance of Ray Milland.
857;thank you for the good, punctual and prompt service.
858;suspensful, intelligent, sinister and BEAUTIFULLY filmed.
859;Based on the play by Frederick Knott, Hitchcock chose to keep the production simple.
860;An American mystery writer (Bob Cummings)comes to her aid.
861;a delightful and fun suspense thriller, Warner sprung for the extras here with a short documentary and a featurette.
862;"While it isn't a classic in the vein of ""Rear Window"" or ""Vertigo"", it's a delightful thriller full of witty dialogue and strong performances from Cummings, Milland (who replaced Cary Grant when Warner Brothers felt that Grant asked too much money for the part), Williams and the stunning Grace Kelly."
863;Classic Hitchcock with twists and turns!
864;All the actors play their parts great!
865;A great movie with an outstanding cast.
866;A mystery with a British touch and the required suspenseful ending.
867;I think I will watch it again.
868;The stabbing scene was the best.
869;It's just an okay movie to me.
870;if you are a fan of the movie, pick it up.
871;A stylish story the way only Hitchcock could make them, suspense galore and, the beautiful blonde is Grace Kelly.
872;"In ""Dial M For Murder"", though, Hitch puts the mystery itself at the forefront of the plot, with the suspense coming in the detective work needed to solve the puzzle."
873;"Seeing the characters squirm and emote is much more interesting than focusing on the one ""whodunnit"" issue."
874;"plus, as usual, ""Dial M"" is classic Hitchcock through and through."
875;The camera work is interesting, the suspense is palpable at times, and the plot is well thought out and intriguing.
876;"overall, this is an exciting, suspenseful film much in the vein of a ""Columbo"" TV series episode."
877;Grace Kelley was lead actress in both movies and she won the Best Actress Award for 1954.
878;The film leaves you in suspense until the case is finally solved.
