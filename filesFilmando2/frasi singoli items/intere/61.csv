1;i love this movie so much .
2;`Toy Story 2' is a more fluid and intricate sequel than the original.
3;What makes it all fun is an attempt to find him at a local toy store, and a journey to the toy collector's high rise.
4;Witty and freewheeling, 'Toy Story 2' springs to life.
5;Fun from start to finish, 'Toy Story' only begs one question: Toys coming to life.
6;It served its purpose, to entertain my daughter during long trips.
7;Toy Story 2 is my favorite.
8;The first one was good and I just saw the third one and that was good too but this one is just the best.
9;It's great and funny and I loved it.
10;Every bit as good as the first one, defying the sequel law.
11;the song at the end is real too.
12;a take of it is even done by beatles.
13;there are a lot of famous voices here.
14;its one of the best pixar films out there.
15;at the very end,they hint around about a toy story 3.
16;I liked this movie better than the original Toy Story (which was great too).
17;Oh, my kids liked it too .
18;the thing I liked most about it is the way everything was rendered so well.
19;Woody friends move more like people than puppets, the lighting is realistic, details are amazing ( I certainly remember seeing Jessie's reflection in a window).
20;If PIXAR can do so well now (see also Monsters, Inc.)what will they be able to achieve in another 5 years.
21;CGI had never looked so good,and the humor was great, both children and adults could enjoy this movie.
22;Woody discovers not only his roots, but also the true meaning of family.
23;Pop culture references allow adults to get some jokes that kids might miss, but the kids will have a blast watching this animated adventure.
24;and is hence more fun.
25;The second one is better than the third as well.
26;It's definitely a fun movie for boys and girls alike.
27;So grab some popcorn and have a family night with your children.
28;First, I have small children and must see these movies at the theatre and at home (sometimes several times a day).
29;This movie and Toy Story are not just children's movies but are well crafted and engaging in their own right.
30;This is a very enjoyable movie.
31;My daughter and I watched it together and both of us were pleased.
32;I would recommend adding this movie to your home library, since your kids (like mine) will want to watch it more than once.
33;My 2 year old daughter loves this movie!
34;The movie itself is pretty good, but Jessi (cowgirl) is very aggrevating!
35;Ok, everyone knows the film itself is amazing.
36;But Toy Story 2 blew my mind.
37;I actually jumped at one point the sound is so well.
38;The entire soundtrack will most definitely give even the latest, greatest home theaters a true and genuine workout.
39;Once your ears adjust to the insane awesomeness of the audio, your eyes will pop with the extreme detail, depth, and vividness of the picture.
40;A++ for a stellar product Pixar!
41;Super cute movie, I watched it with my girls and they loved.
42;I love Pixar and am collecting all of them on Blu ray.
43;the idea of making toys alive is still creative, imaginative, original and unique.
44;I love all the Toy Story movies, and this one completed my collection.
45;is, I think, the better movie.
46;it builds on what we already know from the original, and principally concentrates on the stars of the first movie, Woody and Buzz.
47;Obviously the characters of 'Woody's Roundup' and Buzz Lightyear's foe, Zurk, are more rounded characters than the minor ones.
48;My husband and I enjoy this movie AND my 2.5 year old son and his 3 year old buddy do too!
49;Toy Story 2 holds all our interest!
50;The kids and I really enjoyed watching this movie
51;This movie is funny and very entertaining.
52;Great movie for ther family and the children.
53;It is so much fun to watch!!!
54;It gives adults and kids an hour and a half of gentle fun.
55;Buzz is a brave hero and Jessie is spirited and childlike.
56;And the bloopers are delightful.
57;very god and more than we had anticipated in the box was pleasantly surprised would d this again if need be
58;I would have returned the whole thing but my son loves the movie so much I figured we would just keep the set.
59;My boys really liked this movie.
60;My three year old son loves the toy story movies!
61;I was nervous about purchasing Toy Story 2 because he was so obsessed with the first, but he loves the second just as much!
62;Good movie for all ages.
63;My two daughters, ages 14 years and 18 months, both love this movie more than any other we own.
64;She loves Buzz and askes to watch him almost everyday.
65;She has a buzz toy, which is her favorite.
66;They are both good clean fun and enjoyable to watch, even for the umpteenth time.
67;It arrived in a very timely manner which made us quite pleased.
68;He absolutely adores the movie and plays it over time and time again.
69;We love toy story and now my little boy can watch it on my kindle wherever we go!
70;a must own for any child over the age of 1, provides hours of uninterrupted joy to the kids who watch
71;My two year old absolutely loves these two videos.
72;Product and Delivery by Amazon was great.
73;My little 3 year old is obsessed with buzz light year!
74;Great continuation from the first movie!
75;Looking forward to ordering toy story 3!
76;He loves woody and buzz in this movie.
77;Buzz lightyear was the funniest to my children !
78;I asked them what was funny about the movie and they simply said buzz lightyear !
79;What can I say, it's a classic.
80;Is good but I really don't like Toy Story much but I am sure your kids will enjoy very much.
81;I bought it for my 5 year old grandaughter and she loves it.
82;My 3 year old grandson will watch it over and over again!
83;He has a Woody toy that he takes everywhere.
84;It kept us both intertained.
85;He has also watched it with his friends.
86;But our family found Toy Story 2 to be more enjoyable than the original Toy Story.
87;Funny and excellent continuation to another classic movie.
88;Both movies are a must see.
89;he loves this movie and amazon offered it at the best price so i got it for him for christmas.
90;Toy story, toy story 2, and toy story 3.
91;I highly recommend all the toy story movies to everyone.
92;John Lasseter's Toy Story 2 is one of the best animated films of the decade.
93;It's even funnier and wittier than its already outstanding predecessor.
94;in contrast to many of today's blockbusters, Toy Story 2 has sharply written characters that are provided with motivations for their actions.
95;It even manages to be very dramatic at times.
96;Despite all that, the pace is furious and the action scenes are always breathtaking.
97;My son loves this movie!
98;Toy Story Part 1 is great but for us, we think Part 2 is even better!
99;contrary to popular opinion, the film is suitable for ages.
100;They all found it 'tres rigole'(very funny)In conclusion it is a fantastic film with a revolutionary way of producing.
101;Thre is a good story line, but the best thing is that its really entertaining for all age groups.
102;The best things about part 2 is that it has just as good of a plotline as part 1, and that the movie is enjoyable for anyone of any age.
103;There are jokes in it for any age, and the wole concept of the movie is great.
104;Like the first movie, this is a milestone in movies, it's probably the best thing I saw in the theatre all last year.
105;This product came quickly and in perfect condition.
106;we all enjoy watching this movie.
107;This took it to a new level with comedy digs to Star Wars and Jurassic Park and yet stayed true to the main theme.
108;Woody and Buzz were great, as usual, but the introduction of the Round.
109;While this is a great stand alone story, it fit seamlessly with the first Toy Story picture, and it will with the third one.
110;The movie is a wonderful wonderful story about toys become people, act like people, think like people and have feelings like people.
111;I saw the first Toy Story movie when it first came out with my granddaughter and we both loved it .
112;now , I have 13 Great grandkids and this is what he asked Santa for r o Christmas.
113;. . . best of the three, but it was really good.
114;The story line was cute and it was very touching in some areas.
115;All of these are worth watching.
116;Still awsome although made in 1999.
117;I would recommend it to everybody.
118;I ordered this movie so that I could watch it on my Home Theatre system.
119;not only did the movie sound terrific in surround sound, it was actually an excellent movie.
120;i'm 45 years old but, once I was able to get over the fact that this was an animated movie, I found the movie quite enjoyable.
121;"s. ""The Incredibles"" is another excellent animated movie."
122;It also sounds great in Surround Sound!
123;"Viewed on a Panasonic 50"" plasma via a Panasonic DMP."
124;not quite as immersive an environment as Up!
125;This movie is funny from start to finish.
126;Our family likes this follow.
127;Has an engaging story, great characters and introduces Jeesie the cowgirl.
128;The story continues and it is good movie although not GREAT as the first part is.
129;Worth purchasing to complete the trilogy.
130;After seeing this movie, I went out and bought it.
131;Toy Story 2 has that added ingredient for sequel success .
132;Just as in Addam's Family Values, she brings her enthusiam to an established character, but allows the original actors to maintain their charm.
133;tom Hanks and Tim Allen reprise their original voice roles to brilliant effect.
134;As long as I don't have to look at them, they're terrific.
135;committee works!Watching the credits, you can realize what a corporate entity Pixar has become (look at all the lines for the Finance office!)
136;, it's amazing that they are able to make a movie that is both so disarming and full o' heart.
137;Every toy story has been great.
138;The first Toy Story was entertaining to watch because of the creative graphics, concept and acting.
139;Its actually really really good and entertaining in my opinion and if you want the same old characters with a new twist then this is the film for you.
140;both Toy Stories are good with cute animation, a good story line and plenty of funny laughs and comedy.
141;I love this move, I thought the case would be in a blu.
142;ray movie and digital copy work perfectly.
143;Looks better than TY1 actually .
144;it's a classic time piece.
145;Of course the rest of the movie is awesome as well!!
146;If you don't have it, I recommend getting it .
147;Buzz Lightyear and Woody are back, along with a bunch of delightful new characters.
148;Disney and Pixar have done it again with their amazing graphics and stunning animation.
149;The comedy and fun contained in this memorable film will bring excitement for the whole family.
150;Say yeehah to all the returning characters as well as the new ones.
151;After Woody rescues Wheezy, he is stolen by Al, an obsessed toy collecter who is the head of the famous Al's Toybarn.
152;Jessie is saved and she and Bullseye have a new home in Andy's room.
153;this is truly a remarkable video, with many surprises popping up in every direction.
154;(my son is 5) And we loved it!
155;When I saw this movie, it was amazing.
156;This is a great movie and even better in Blu.
157;Like the first one better.
158;This is a great movie for my 2yr old grandson.
159;He loved it and Grandma loved that I was able to upload this movie in seconds to keep him entertained.
160;My son loves it he watches it on the kindle.
161;I recommend this movie it's fun and Entertaining so if you have kids get it
162;It's first of all, amazing because of all the graphics and computer animation and second of all, hilarious!
163;This is an excellent movie for anyone and everyone, no matter what age you are!
164;We love all of the toy story movies and characters.
165;daughter gets to watch this in the car, she loves it.
166;Glad I ordered it for her, it came quickly, which made us both happy.
167;You might not think it's the best one of the trilogy so far, but it's really good and a must see.
168;"As it's less than a month away now from the ""Toy Story 3"" release date of June 18, 2010, I felt the need to write a few paragraphs on it's predecessor and my personal favorite to date of the ""Toy Story"" trilogy, ""Toy Story 2""."
169;Meanwhile, Woody who is initially looking to escape Al's apartment is astonished and delighted to find he was the star of his own kids show, with a supporting cast of characters, and is now a collectible.
170;BUT, as Buzz sagely points out to him, he'll be behind glass NEVER to be played with or loved by a child again.
171;Besides the well loved characters from the original all returning, there are endearing fun additions in Jessie, Bullseye, Mrs. Potato Head, Wheezy, Tour.
172;The kids will have lots to laugh at, and experience a few thrills and surprises that will put them on the edge of their seats as well.
173;Bottom line, a terrific story, they will NOT be bored.
174;still there is a complexity and depth that adults can appreciate.
175;"There is a heartbreaking vignette of just this when Jessie tells her story in the song ""When She Loved Me"" sung with a piercing sweetness by Sarah McLachlan
I:9592;176;This was I think the most emotional and powerful part of the movie, the music, the golden haze that filters Jessie's memories of Emily and she, hit my tear ducts, as I'm sure it did many adults in the theatre.
I:9592;177;There are lighter moments as well such as an affectionate homage to the films """"The Empire Strikes Back"""" and """"Field of Dreams"""" which may go over most kid's heads, but will give adults a smile and a chuckle."""
178;"besides the lovely, plaintive ballad ""When She Loved Me"", Randy Newman's classic theme song from ""Toy Story"", ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" gets a new spin with a snappy, big band version with Robert Goulet's booming baritone knocking it right out of the park!"
179;Those are the songs, but the instrumental music effectively enhances the story on the screen as well.
180;the bonus features on this 2 disc special addition are outstanding, starting with the commentary by director John Lassiter, writer Andrew Stanton, and others of the Pixar team that only adds to the pleasure of watching the film.
181;This film will always bring a smile to my face, even 10+ years later, because I will always remember the special first time I saw it back with my boy, and how thrilled he was the very next week when on a family vacation in Disney World he actually got to see Buzz and Woody in person!
182;Once Lion King stopped, an odd shift happened where the great Disney films were now Pixar made.
183;So Pixar on their 3rd film, decided to revisit the characters of their first classic and ends up with a great film surpassing the original.
184;what always makes Pixar films great is the heart: we CARE about these characters.
185;When new toy Jessie tells her backstory of her previous owner, you can't help but sympathize with her.
186;It's quite a delicate mix between story, character, comedy and even action and they still manage to pull it off.
187;memorable childhood of his owner.
188;While it is disappointing fewer and fewer people are still doing traditional hand drawn animation, it's still quite something to see the power of CG and Toy Story 2 shows some of its potential.
189;If you loved Toy Story, you'll love Toy Story 2!
190;The casting is phenomenal, the writing is hysterical and the animation is top notch.
191;Tom Hanks, Joan Cusack, Tim Allen and Kelsey Grammer, as well as the rest of the cast, are terrific!
192;A wonderful movie for all ages to enjoy on family movie night!
193;My wife and I love the animated Pixar movies and Toy Story 2 is no exception.
194;Buzz, Woody, and the whole gang bring everything that the first movie had many years before it.
195;It brings laughter and tears to anyone that watches it.
196;story of Jessie with Emily and how kids grow up but the toys never do really reaches deep inside you.
197;You never fully understand the changes you go through as you grow up, and Toy Story 2 makes you truly look back.
198;i highly recommend Toy Story 2 to not only kids but to adults too.
199;Pixar does an excellent job relating their movies to kids AND adults.
200;We vote that toy story 2 is better than the first film!
201;The product was received in excellent condition!
202;Thanks, again, for the great product and fast shipping!
203;Loved the kids animation show, kids love it, we loved it.
204;Hope you enjoy as much at we did.
205;Where this movie has a good story and is enjoyable to watch, I was expecting more humor that an adult could enjoy too.
206;I liked it, it just was TOO much for children.
207;But, if you have kids, this is the one for you.
208;Here's yet one more sequel that more than lived up to its original great start.
209;The first Toy Story was outstanding.
210;This is just as good, if not better.
211;paced and very entertaining, this doesn't have a lot of laugh.
212;loud parts but is definitely fun to watch with many good lines.
213;when you factor in all the nice characters, music, colors and sounds, this has to be one of the most beloved animated films of the modern era.
214;There are few sequels that meet the expectations of viewers that loved the first movie.
215;The Empire Strikes Back is widely regarded as the best Star Wars film among SW fans, for example.
216;Toy Story 2 may very well qualify in this elite category .
217;it is easily the equal to Toy Story, and may even be better.
218;"It turns out that Woody is just one of the ""Roundup Gang"", and a rare collector's item."
219;that the film looks and sounds great is a given.
220;Pixar had another entire movie (Bug's Life) to perfect the technology started in the original Toy Story.
221;But the emotional heart of the film belongs to Sarah McLachlin, she of willowy voice (and a fellow Nova Scotian!)
222;The film is a meditation on aging.
223;Kids, of course, will not be so philosophical, but will simply enjoy the adventure, the slapstick, and the fun.
224;It's a great film in a good collector's edition, and well priced.
225;pack of the two film together.
226;Love the movie, this is the best of the three, in my opinion.
227;This came out when I was a teenager, and my 2 year old daughter loves it .
228;Well, here's one that accomplishes that unique feat.
229;Again, the voice cast is superb.
230;out, and the pacing is wonderful.
231;defined, and the sound is wonderful.
232;There's a wonderful lesson about friendship to be learned here, as well as loyalty.
233;As usual, the story is phenomenal, though not quite as good as the original (or, now, the third).
234;so I kept it for my self.
235;Beyond that this Pixar instant classic is great.
236;It is a very cute movie and all the characters are great.
237;I would recommend it to anyone who liked the first one.
238;Sequel's are not usually as good as the first but this movie is just as good, maybe better.
239;wonderfully detailed graphics, humorous dialog to tickle the funny bone of both young children and adults, totally engrossing, a tour de force for Pixar.
240;Toy Story is one of those series of movies that does an amazing job of making each one as good as the last.
241;I love the adult humor and the children's story.
242;It makes it enjoyable for me to watch with my kids over and over (cause that's what kids do!
243;The first one is good, the third one is a bit depressing, but the second is just right.
244;This movie is just fun, plain and simple.
245;usa and i love toy story 2 its sooo cool i love jessie she is so cool and buzz and woody are cool too!my lil'sister (who's name is jessie too)jessie and i loved toy story 2 we say: WE LOVE IT!
246;This movie was very good.
247;As well as it came to my house with in two days after ordering it.
248;Most of all my two year old daughter loves it and watches it about a dozen times.
249;One of the rare sequels in Hollywood that's as good as the original from a storytelling and character standpoint.
250;Another wonderful installment in PIXAR's signature series.
251;In disney's pixar's toy story 2, you see the origin of woody.
252;you favorite characters are back and better than ever.
253;This is a very entertaining and perceptive film that remembers the guilt that a child can feel over outgrowing a favorite toy.
254;I hope he's as philosophical and understanding about it as Woody is.
255;The animation and voice talent are also top.
256;It's a classic that your children will enjoy.
257;My youngest granddaughter just discovered toy story.
258;Its not easy for cartoons to catch an adults attention without being perverted and I am glad Toy Story is a clean fun family movie.
259;With a niece and nephew running around this is a great movie for them to watch while i sleep.
260;That's pretty hard to accomplish with any kids movie in my opinion and Pixar always does a wonderful job.
261;The story is so great!
262;There are some great moments in the movie that only an adult would catch (the reflection of the dinosaur in the toy car mirror ripped right from Jurassic Park ) which will give you a chuckle.
263;overall, a great story, some good tunes (Sarah Mclaughlan will make you cry) and lots of fun!
264;This was a gift for a 2 year old grandson.
265;He (and his father) loves this 2nd version!
266;The storyline, acting and animation were superb.
267;"This second installment of the ""Toy Story"" saga is an improvement on the first one because the animation is better."
268;The movements of the humans in the story are more fluid and natural and the story of friendship, loyalty, and deciding where one really belongs is one with which we can all identify.
269;happily, we see that Woody The Cowboy (voiced by Tom Hanks)still has a special place in Andy's heart despite his earlier displacement by the arrival of Buzz Lightyear.
270;Andy still enjoys taking Woody to Cowboy Camp during the summer.
271;Presumably, that incident is based on real life.
272;The story of Jessie's brief time with her owner is beautifully enacted through music.
273;eventually, all turns out well, and this story provides a morality tale about dishonesty when, instead of ending of with rare dolls to send to a museum in Japan, Al ends up with no Round.
274;it's fun to watch the toy ensemble at the end enjoying a musical number by Wheezy.
275;All in all, it's a cleverly written story with great animation.
276;A masterpiece from the crew of Pixar!
277;I'm happy I got this today mAde my day!
278;Its such a delightful movie!
279;Very few sequels are as good as the first movie.
280;But, I believe this movie is even better than the original.
281;The characters are just great.
282;I even catch myself with a tear in my eye when Jessie tells her story about becoming an unwanted toy, and being given away when her little girl out grows her.
283;LOLAnyway, my 4 year old twin girls love this movie.
284;Our whole family enjoys this movie.
285;"In November 1999, the sequel ""Toy Story 2"" was released in theaters and the $90 million dollar film like its predecessor did extremely well in the domestic and worldwide box office making over $485 million."
286;"The first thing one will notice (especially after watching ""Toy Story 1"") is how much detail is included in ""Toy Story 2"" (and after watching the special features, you'll see how much have improved over a decade later with the sneak peak of ""Toy Story 3"")."
287;"for the most part, ""Toy Story 2"" has improved animated."
288;ray, you see the detail and the amazing clarity.
289;also, the movements of the characters are just well.
290;The movements were very good on the first film but they improved on it for the sequel.
291;"Just the first few minutes of the beginning of ""Toy Story 2' as we see the Buzz Lightyear video game sequence, we are treated with an immersive soundscape with the center, front and surround channels being utilized as well as LFE."
292;The film has a good amount of action sequences as Buzz Lightyear #1 takes on Buzz Lightyear #2 along with Emperor Zurg.
293;sound is crystal clear and overall, another impressive lossless soundtrack.
294;"(4:00) A sneak peek at the new characters and the talent voicing the new characters for ""Toy Story 3'."
295;(4:24) In this series of shorts, Pixar artists talk about their career path and share advice to aspiring filmmakers and animators.
296;(1:58) A look at the creation of the live.
297;action zoetrope that Pixar created to capture the principles of animation in a live sculpture.
298;(12:46) A tribute to beloved Disney and Pixar story man Joe Ranft, regarded as one of the industry's most gifted story artists.
299;(3:02) Crew and talent talk about working with John Lasseter.
300;"(3:28) A featurette on how the talent bring the characters to life and the new talent who provide the voices for the characters of ""Toy Story 2'."
301;ray release for the sequel is equally impressive and a title definitely worth owning and worth having in your Blu.
302;although, I enjoyed the storyline for the first film much more, I enjoyed the second film because of the additional characters and the animation showed great improvement nearly five years after the first was made.
303;the voice talent and acting is top notch, the storyline is well.
304;written and Pixar Animation Studios set the bar higher then and they continue to set the bar higher now when it comes to CG animated films.
305;Toy Story 1 and 2 are among those films that just look and sound fantastic but also additional content to keep any animation fan happy.
306;Toy Story 2 is just an enjoyable family film that holds up well today, over a decade later and will still produce plenty of laughs and even in today's world of awesome CG animation, you can't help but see this vibrant film and just enjoy it on so many levels.
307;And the fact that the employees busted their heart and soul to get this film done in eight months vs. the usual four years is equally impressive.
308;ray is definitely well worth it and highly recommended!
309;TOY STORY 2 is one of the exceptional examples that sequels can sometimes outshine its predecessor.
310;With the same cast including Tom Hanks (Woody) and Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen), TOY STORY 2 unravels the bittersweet fate that traditional toys will one day be obsolete, replaced by commercial computer games and toys.
311;It makes a satire at the overconsumerism of today's world and strikes a compromise between nostalgia and leaving behind the past.
312;buoyant and energetic, the rambunctious cast with the sparkling dialogue and great music pumps up the movie with gloss and unexpected humanity.
313;Despite the computer animation, the plot relates to the human life, and for all the marvels of technology dished up with Randy Newman's music including the Oscar.
314;nominated piece When she loves me wins over the audience with its human drama.
315;The exciting cirumstances at the Airport runway, saving Jessie from the clutches of an evil toy dealer are all realistically executed.
316;a family movie that is entertaining and conveys value is hard to come by.
317;looks pretty darn good on Blu.
318;My daughter enjoys all three, but loves Jessie!
319;We love Disney movies and Toy Story 1 and 2 are both awesome movies.
320;This is a classic that will always be loved by children of all ages.
321;Go and get this movie as soon as possible!
322;My kids liked it better than Toy Story, it's just great!
323;My daughter loves this movie, and all the Toy Story movies!
324;Bought brand new and has lasted a long time.
325;My order came within the specified time, wrapped extra good so nothing could h appen to it.
326;My grandsons loved Watching the movie.
327;luckily I found the movie at a local goodwill shop to give as his gift!
328;This is such a wonderful movie.
329;It's one of my family's favorites of all time.
330;Anyone will have fun watching!
331;Thankfully TS2 belongs to the first group and it's not only an excellent sequel, it's one of the best ever.
332;The first TS is a masterpiece and I don't know how but the Pixar wizards match that fate and even supprass it.
333;tS2 continues the toy's adventures in a more epic scale.
334;Woody is kidnapped by an ambitious toy seller, Al, who wants to sell him to a museum in Japan.
335;They created a new engaging story with themes like abandonment, one's purpose in life and of course friendship.
336;They also enlarged the cast with more likeable characters and threw great action sequences.
337;Of course the humor in this film is impeccable and you'll be laughing a lot at smart jokes.
338;This story is very sophisticated and stands heads and shoulders above many other animated films.
339;video and AudioTS2 comes with a pristine transfer to BD.
340;Paths to Pixar: Technical Artists a great featurette that's both fun and informative.
341;Also you have a gallery and trailers.
342;closing Thoughts:TS2 is a rare sequel that matchs its predecessor and a true classic in its own right.
343;This BD shows spectacular video and audio plus fun and informative bonus material.
344;My son loves this movie.
345;In Toy Story's case, Woody and Buzz's second adventure is definitive proof of what a deep, colorful yarn Pixar had actually sewn in their first feature.
346;styled venture through the city in search of an important stolen toy.
347;Stuffed with throwbacks that are sure to elicit cheery memories of the first picture, it's also loaded up with new material that's every bit as charming.
348;The film itself is great and one up's the original film on every level.
349;The animation is much more developed and you can see the growth from film to film.
350;This being the third Pixar film, it is easy to seethe leaps and bounds this film has over the original.
351;The toy collecting frenzy is captured perfectly here and the in jokes are just hilarious for adults.
352;One of our Grandsons favorite movies.
353;Love to watch him view it and see how excited he gets.
354;We watched this while at Disney World in Orlando and LOVED it!
355;Ham is hilarious and the new characters are great!
356;My kids (ages 4 and 6) and I love this movie.
357;my daughter loves this movie and i can't complain!
358;it's fun to watch with her and even to listen to from the other room.
359;The first one was excellent, this is good.
360;Any film I can feel comfortable watching with my kid is a Godsend.
361;Bought as Christmas gift for my nephew.
362;When he opened a small bit of the package, his eyes got really big and screamed TOY STORY!
363;I got a really big hug!
364;I got a message from his mom.
365;It is rare for a sequel to surpass the original movie artistically as well as commercially.
366;"One of those rare sequels is ""Toy Story 2""."
367;Toy Story 2 is that rare treasure.
368;The writing and animation is superb.
369;I really enjoyed the scenes with Woody, Jessie, Stinky Pete, and Bullseye.
370;One of my personal scenes is when the toy collector calls in the old man to fix Woody's arm.
371;The details in the animation is amazing and very realistic.
372;I also loved the scenes when Jessie reminisces about her former owner Emily.
373;It was very poignant without coming off as drippy.
374;Another great moment in the film was when Buzz and the gang were in the toy store looking for Al, the toy collector.
375;Toy Story 2 is one of my favorite Disney/Pixar collaborations.
376;This is a film that can be enjoyed by all ages.
377;It is also one of the best films ever, animated or not.
378;I'm not sure what makes this movie so fantastic.
379;It might be the great characters.
380;Whatever it is, I'm going to keep watching and telling the jokes to my friends.
381;And a note to those who watch this movie, you are in for a real treat if you can stick around for the outtakes.
382;Toy story is truly a Disney classic.
383;My daughters love that it comes with the digital copy so they can watch it on the iPad easily.
384;So Happy with the product
385;A fantastic movie for people of all ages.
386;Heartwarming story of how Woody is trying to decide between a toy museum in Tokyo and Andy's room.
387;1999 was undoubtedly one of the greatest years for film since the 1970's.
388;It was the year that brought us the darkly brilliant Being John Malkovich, the spellbinding film The Insider, and the richly beautiful Topsy Turvy (Please note I am excluding the instant classics The Talented Mr. Ripley, The End of the Affair, The Sixth Sense, The Straight Story, and All About My Mother due to time constraints as I could write paragraphs on how much I adored each one of these films).
389;Yet I make no apologies for saying that Toy Story 2 deserves to sit with these amazing artistic achievments as one of the greatest films of the late 1990's.
390;But what Toy Story 2 is, is the perfect studio film.
391;It is that perfect Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers dance that can be marvelled at time and time again, and coax tears out of the most cynical of souls.
392;The film brilliantly interweaves a magnificent tapestry of comedy, fun, family entertainment, and pathos that is only rarely exhibited in today's cinema.
393;As I watched the film in an audience full of laughing children I both found myself smiling so big that my face began to hurt, and gently crying.
394;Toy Story 2 builds magnificently on the originaly Toy Story movie.
395;His friends come to the rescue and a tough choice is made.
396;This is a rare sequel where it's better than the first.
397;ray and in beautiful colors and in high definition.
398;A rarity, Toy Story 2 is a sequel that bests the original.
399;The tables are turned: Buzz has to save Woody, and once again from a contemptable human.
400;What do you think?The new main toy characters, Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl, and the Old Prospector, are wonderfully voiced by Joan Cusak and TV's Frasier.
401;She should have one the oscar for it!
402;My daughter is 3 and she loves the toy story movies.
403;This movie is funny and exciting.
404;She laughs so much and yells when something exciting happens and it keeps her entertained for a while.
405;"ray considering it was one of the ""older"" Pixar films."
406;The picture and audio was great .
407;Better picture, sound, new features combined with the old features, new animations, and a new sneak peek at Toy Story 3!
408;this is one of the best sequels ever made in the Disney lineup.
409;It is a hit with my kids.
410;I received this item in prestine condition and on time!
411;This is my grandsons favorite Toy Story movie so we have to watch it over and over and over again.
412;I am pleased with this service.
413;Toy story 2 is one of those movies you'll love to watch a billion times because of the atmosphere, related charecters and a great storyline.
414;Most of the places made like, Al's toy barn or Pizza Planet may be imaginary but a job well done, it's now a recognizable name, and last but not least, the new charecters are greatly added to the storyline, begining the phenomemon of Woody's round up.
415;I loved this movie and i can't wait for the third one.
416;I'm pretty sure everyone has watched this movie by now.
417;This movie is great for kids, hilarious for adults, and definitely one that will be watched over and over.
418;It's my favorite of all 3 Toy Story movies.
419;Always love the Toy Story movies.
420;Watched with my grandkids(3 and 5) and they absolutely loved it.
421;What is especially good is the nonstop action and storyline.
422;"How cool that they could follow up ""Toy Story"" with an equally fabulous sequel."
423;Toy Story 2 came out in theaters in 1999, and is as funny and heartfelt today as it was then.
424;Commentary tracks have become one of my favorite extras, and I'm going to cover it first.
425;"They are proud of the new programs that allowed them to make ""Toy Story 2"" look more realistic than ""Toy Story""."
426;"Andy has a new puppy, Buster, received as a Christmas gift at the end of ""Toy Story""."
427;He is much more realistic than Sid's dog, Scud, could be.
428;One of the new technologies.
429;is that we actually were able to put real fur [on Buster].
430;Also, when the characters go outside, all the leaves on the trees are billowing and kind of gently swaying in the wind.
431;Buzz covers many parts of life on the station, including EVA's, Extra Vehicular Activity, AKA space walks.
432;When I was on board I observed that the average space walk was between 3 and 8 hours.
433;Fascinating stuff, and a good idea of what goes into perfecting the animation to look real.
434;For a young person who wants to get into animation, the most important thing is high school math!
435;Somebody hit RM* and in 20 seconds a year's worth of work disappeared.
436;Pixar's Zoetrope (1:58) A zoetrope is an amazing device, sort of an accelerated flip book using sculptures, and Pixar created one using characters from TS2.
437;"Celebrating Our Friend Joe Ranft (12:46) This is a heartfelt tribute to Joe Ranft, who passed away near the end of production on ""Cars""."
438;"John Lasseter says, Joe ""was one of the greatest story artists of all time."
439;He was the heart and soul of Pixar.
440;"And he's a big part of why people connect so deeply with our movies."""
441;My 2 year old loves Woody and Buzz Wightyear (that's how he says it).
442;Of the 3 Toy Stories, this one is my favorite because it doesn't have the sadistic next door neighbor or the heaviness of 'the end'.
443;It's hard to follow the original, but this sequel is quite enjoyable with it's own charm.
444;ray does amazing things to animation.
445;Arrived in time as described and in perfect condition.
446;My daughter loves toy story and we are excited to add another movie to our collection
447;I love the story line in the movie.
448;Be true to who you are and where you came from.
449;The kids love this movie!
450;I got the 1st one as well and they love to have movie watching marathons all weekend long!
451;The movie was new and we were very happy with the deliver.
452;This is a great family film that is easy to watch.
453;My son loves this film so much and will sit and watch it from start to finish which is great for busy Mom's.
454;Happy to recommend this one.
455;My toddler son loves all of the Toy Story movies and watches them over and over and over.
456;It also joins the ranks of sequels that are actually better then the origianal movie.
457;This is the absoloute best movie sequel I have ever seen in my life.
458;In fact its even better then the great origianal.
459;Everything in this movie is fantastic,fantastic story that is more in.
460;depth then the origianal, funny memorable charachters, absouloutly breathtaking animation, fantastic music, no shortage of humor and comedy, and better yet more action then the origianal.
461;The story to Toy Story 2 is great and more in.
462;Buzz and the rest of the fantastic charachters must rescue him while woody tries to figure out a dilema.
463;or will he go to a toy museum in Japan and be loved by children from behind glass for many years to come?
464;The animation for this movie is the most breathtaking you will ever see in a animated movie, every leaf, every crack in the road, every nail, every pebble of dirt is animated in superb style and grace.
465;The music remains pretty much the same tune from the origianal, with a few new themes and a neat woodys roundup song.
466;One thing the origianal Toy Story was famous for was its great sense of humor.
467;There are almost infinate parodys and jokes at big movies (Star Wars and a really funny Jurrasic park one to name a few) The first one was also chock full of inside jokes.
468;This is truly a film for the ages.
469;OMG, even though I'm 16, I thought this was cute.
470;All 3 of the movies are wonderfully humorous, enchantingly endearing, and it displays friendship, loyalty, and love.
471;They both love all the toy story movies, but this one they really like and was able to download on my kindle.
472;it's just like the toy story 1 movie.
473;thans a lot to the people who made the toy story movies
474;My son loves Toy Story and Toy Story 2.
475;I personally think that the second movie is fun because there are new characters.
476;Voices are funny and story line is good.
477;I would recommend this movie for kids and for families.
478;The biggest compliment that can be paid to Toy Story 2 is that it is on a par with Toy Story 1.
479;You see, Toy Story was not just a wonderful movie, it was a piece of cinematic history.
480;Toy Story 2 had to compete with the technical brilliance of its forefather and its immaculate storytelling.
481;in the sequel, Woody is stolen by a toy collector and it's up to Buzz and the rest of the cast to go get Woody back.
482;Seems like a pretty basic plot but the writers flesh out their characters brilliantly.
483;A heartfelt song borders on the sentimental but it somehow works.
484;The comic elements come from the rescuers.
485;A trip to a Shopping Mall is inspired, especially a meeting with Barbies.
486;But the most impressive comic moment is the resurrection of the fearless Buzz Lightyear.
487;tim Allen and Tom Hanks voicework is very important to Toy Story's success.
488;The rest of the toys are well developed and wonderfully voiced.
489;It is a truly remarkable success story.
490;The first sequel to the film that put both Pixar and CGI animation on the map.
491;II isn't quite as good, but then again neither is I. They're both incredibly enjoyable films that will captivate and entertain you whether you're in diapers or collecting Social Security, and everyone in between.
492;Toy Story II certainly ranks among the finest animated films of the latter 20th Century, and on its own merits deserves your viewing.
493;I laughed throughout the movie.
494;The depth of the personalities, the humor and thoughtfulness of each of the characters makes me feel as though these are real people.
495;I have put this movie on my list of All Time Favorites My Niece is 5 and I am 47 and we both loved it.
496;Hats off to Disney and Pixar for a job well done.
497;a must have along with Toy Story a great fun story loved by kids of all ages and grown.
498;Toy Story 1 and 2 are classics!
499;My 3 year old loved this movie.
500;It's handy for us when travel!
501;old grandsons and I loved it!
502;This is a great movie.
503;I got it for a good price and it came promptly to my house in good condition.
504;I would recommend Amazon to others.
505;Toy Story 2 is a good family movie, the kids really loved it and so did we.
506;Our grandchildren love this movie and it is a good one for our library.
507;lt is a fun movie for adults too.
508;MY boys just got this for yesterday and loved it.
509;Buzz Lightyear versus the evil Emperor Zurg!This movie is outstanding, and even better than the original!
510;toy Story 2 concerns itself with what happens when Woody is abducted by an evil, money.
511;The movie gently asserts that toys are for us to play with and to enjoy, not to be stuffed on to a shelf to gather dust.
512;Toy Story 2 also includes some special touches that carry over from the original.
513;The Pizza Planet delivery truck makes an appearance in 2 , and the results are hilarious when the toys attempt to drive.
514;the movie is vibrant, funny, and heartwarming as the first one, the soundtrack is entertaining, and the action is spellbinding.
515;My daughter was thrilled that I bought the blue Ray edition.
516;Bought it for my grand babies.
517;I bought it for my children also.
518;Very cute story, well presented and enjoyable.
519;just fun, funny and kids love it.
520;but it just DOESN'T matter in the case of 'Toy Story' and this particularly amazing sequel.
521;I have to hand it to the producers and writers for coming up with such a great story!
522;They certainly did come up with a plot that seems a perfect natural for this scenario.
523;All of the voices do a superb job of giving life to these animated toys we see, so good in fact that I watched the entire film without once thinking to myself, Hey, that's Tom Hanks and Tim Allen talking there!
524;You find very quickly that you are enveloped in this creative and might I add VERY FUNNY story which moves along at a great pace and well, even if you have seen it before, it is definitely worth another look.
525;and if you have put off seeing this because its a 'kids film' get OVER it and see it.
526;Good stuff no matter HOW old you are.
527;This one is a classic.
528;If you liked the original movie in this series you should also like this one.
529;It is an excellent sequel and is worth a look.
530;I liked this movie better than the first one.
531;The old gang is still here, with Buzz, Woody, Rex, Hamm, Sliky, and Potato Head, but the new characters introduced in this film are what makes it so good.
532;They encounter some funny mishaps along the way, but in the end, everyone ends up safe and sound.
533;I also enjoy watching it with them, and I always seem to get a laugh from it.
534;This is a good movie to watch as a family.
535;The kids and the adults will enjoy it.
536;All three Toy Story movies get five stars in my book, but TS2 is my favorite of the bunch.
537;lot of fun to watch,well written with the voices of some of the best actors and actress on the planet
538;up, we are introduced to more new characters to love and enjoy.
539;I admit I like the original a little better, but this one is just as cute.
540;Great film that displays friendships through thick and thin.
541;He watches this movie every nightit came in great condition and was well packaged
542;It was a good deal for me as well.
543;My little kids love this movie.
544;It's amazing what they did with the animation, and the story line is enjoyable, even for adults.
545;"I have personally seen Toy Story 1 at least 20 times with my children and by watching part 2
I:9592;546;I thought how anyone could make such movies so real until the 2nd one came along.
I:9592;547;life that you take them for real.
I:9592;548;A salute to the cast, crew members, producers, and also Disney and Pixar for a job well done.
I:9592;549;The creative energy and technology that were put into these films remain impressive today, and the themes are timeless.
I:9592;550;Toy Story 2's human characters are just so real and adorable.
I:9592;551;You must watch both, the first, then the second, in any case, to appreciate them both.
I:9592;552;It's a wonderful movie which will touch the hearts of children and adults alike.
I:9592;553;That alone makes it worth while, but adds the fact that it is a great movie and you have a winner.
I:9592;554;It is actually better than the original.
I:9592;555;This is an excellent sequel.
I:9592;556;This is creative and has the tradition of the Pixar group.
I:9592;557;I would suggest you have it around for your children, since the technology is right for the times.
I:9592;558;I bought this movie for my collection.
I:9592;559;It is very good, no matter how old it is.
I:9592;560;My kids and I enjoy the movie everytime we wath it.
I:9592;561;Yea, I have been wanting Toy Story 2 and now found it for a great price here on Amazon.
I:9592;562;I felt Toy Story 2 was by far the best one for them.
I:9592;563;We loved 1 and 3, but (at least for my kids) some images were a little too intense for them.
I:9592;564;My two year old loves Buzz!
I:9592;565;Good movie for the family, not as good as the first one, but sequels rarely are.
I:9592;566;My three year old son loves this movie.
I:9592;567;It is my least favorite of the three Toy Story movies, but is definitely entertaining.
I:9592;568;Toy story 2 is the second installment in one of the most popular film franchise's in America.
I:9592;569;It's a great film that your kids and you are sure to enjoy!This movie introduces the conflict between Buzz Lightyear and The Evil Emperor Zurg archenemy of Star Command, also it introduces the new Buzz with the Anti.
I:9592;570;Watch the movie to find out!Overall this movie is easily a 5 star, a great movie to watch with the family or friends!
I:9592;571;Just like the other two but all three are good.
I:9592;572;Toy Story 2 is a very rare movie .
I:9592;573;There's a lot of fun here, but I think it is the emotional parts that push it a notch higher than its predecessor.
I:9592;574;emerges and the final outcome (of everything) is decided in a very exciting finish.
I:9592;575;This is a gem of a scene .
I:9592;576;a privileged moment for us movie watchers .
I:9592;577;and some very excellent work on the part of the movie makers.
I:9592;578;When Somebody Loved Me (written by Randy Newman) .
I:9592;579;and she was the most perfect person to hire for this job.
I:9592;580;bonanza of great story ideas.
I:9592;581;some of my favorite fun ideas here in """"Toy Story 2"""" are ."""
582;Barbie dolls are given some substantial screen time, and they are .
583;and lastly, the toy repairman scene is a lot of fun.
584;it is also excellent in that there are no credits at the beginning of the movie .
585;"takes"" for us to watch."
586;one that reflects goodness and morality .
587;My 5 year old son loves this movie.
588;He has a lot of fun pretending to be Buzz Lightyear and going after Zurg.
589;"It's a great ""good, clean, fun"" movie."
590;Toy Story 2 is one of those sequels that take the success and beauty from the original picture and create something more.
591;Pixar and Disney created a film that is more entertaining and more philosophical than its predecessor.
592;hearted, easy atmosphere from Toy Story and A Bug's Life, but this time with a plot that comes more from the toy's point.
593;view along with some of the most original humor ever thought up for an animated picture.
594;It's a satisfying trip all the way.
595;it picks up where Toy Story left off: Woody and Buzz made up and everyone's all good.
596;Buzz leads Hamm, Rex, Mr. Potatohead, and Slinky on a mission to save Woody, a mission that will make you cheer and laugh.
597;Toy Story 2 also explores the history of Woody himself, something we never really thought about in the first picture.
598;The rest is up to you to see, because once you've seen it, you'd want to recommend it to friends too.
599;the first Toy Story was amazing.
600;Toy Story 2 built upon that, reassuring that Pixar and the filmmakers are the real thing.
601;Toy Story 2 managed to outgross Princess Mononoke, a film I give credit to since it was Hayao Miyazaki films the Disney animators turned to whenever they needed inspiration.
602;This movie is for everyone.
603;It's delightful and a lot of fun.
604;Pixar and Disney are really going infinity.
605;I got it for my 2 year old granddaughter who loves Woody and Jessie.
606;My granddaughter is a big fan of Toy Story 1.
607;The delivery was quick and Payton was thrilled.
608;The first Toy Story was really good, and i thought the second wouldnt be as great.
609;But i saw it and it was great, maybe even BETTER than the 1st one.
610;Woody meets all new friends of his kind and wants to leave with them.
611;This movie is absolutely brilliant!
612;I hadn't laughed so hard since the first time I discovered Jim Carrey in his brilliant debut.
613;The animation and detail is jawdropping, the jokes are, as said hillarious and the characters are all, even the new ones (Weezy is brilliant), worked out and defined with great love and knowledge by the people who created this masterpiece.
614;But then the piece the resistance, the script that, let's face it was hard to improve the original's because of it's well, eh, originality, works in every way: It's witty, it's clever and it's hard to see through emediately.
615;The opening and Finale of this movie are spectacular.
616;It's Funny, touching and an absolutely, possitively prove that Disney and Pixar are still at the top of the craftmanship that it takes to make instant classics like this one.
617;this is a fun movie, even for adults.
618;I do not even have children, but my wife and I were both able to enjoy this movie.
619;the voice work and artistry were well.
620;done, topping Pixar's previous works, Toy Story and A Bug's Life.
621;The work done by Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were well done, as always, but the addition of Wayne Knight, Joan Cusack and Kelsey Grammer to the cast, were good choices and they played the parts well.
622;this is a great movie for the kids, but there is enough to make this a guilty pleasure for the adults.
623;This is my daughters favorite Toy Story out of the series.
624;It is a great movie.
625;animated flick entertains us wildly, but also teaches a lesson: it's better to be a toy loved and played with by a child than be a toy admired in a collectibles museum.
626;woody learns that Woody the Cowboy had been a very popular puppet in a television series in the fifties.
627;Now he's rare and valuable as a collectible especially to the Japanese market.
628;The toy dealer calls in an expert restorer who cleans up Woody and reclaims the use of his arm.
629;there are wild chases, escape scenes, some very close calls, and a lot of toy ingenuity.
630;stop, and the movie is great for all ages without adult references and innuendoes to throw the kids off.
631;It's a toy trip that most people will enjoy.
632;Bought for the grandchildren and they really enjoyed watching the movie I just don't like to write revidws or make additional comments
633;My son loves Toy Story and Toy Story 2 was even entertaining enough where I could sit through it and actually enjoy it.
634;It's excellent for people the age of 5 through who the heck knows!
635;A superb masterpiece to add to your Disney collection.
636;What could be better than the 2.
637;"superb ""Toy Story 2"" in the same 2."
638;as with the first installment, the movie looks and sounds terrific thanks to a cleaned.
639;up print and, again, the good work of sound master Gary Rydstrom.
640;You can see the bright toy colors and clickety.
641;especially the airport in the final segments.
642;Toy Story 2 also boasts a very clever story line that's both a loving throwback to vintage kiddie shows and good.
643;natured satire on both mega.
644;toy stores and collectible mania.
645;Here's what I really love about this movie.
646;life characters and a nifty cowboy.
647;style theme song, Pixar's John Lasseter and his team create a delightful homage to vintage children's TV.
648;between the mysterious disappearance of Woody and the exciting rescue from a Tokyo.
649;"loved characters from the first ""Toy Story""."
650;"Estelle Harris makes the latter into a classic Brooklyn Jewish/Edith Bunker mother, a perfect match for Don Rickles (""I'm a married spud!"")"
651;Of course, of all the things Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have done, it's their wonderful Woody.

660;drawn (both design and character) enough for literate adults.
661;and, hopefully, its once and future business partners at Disney.
662;keep this franchise fresh and wondrous?
663;Meanwhile, there's much to enjoy here.
664;Great kids movie then and now.
665;I'm hoping that Toy Story 4 is in the works, and I plan on purchasing Toy Story 3 as well as the movie that started it all Toy Story.
666;This new generation of kids are enjoying them now.
667;I thought that the movie Toy Story 2 starring Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, was one of the best disney movies ever made.
668;Jessie the Cowgirl(voiced by Joan Cusack) made the movie more appealing, what with the song When She Loved Me , by Sarah McLaghlin.
669;This made the movie more heartwarming than ever before.
670;Toy Story 2 is a must see movie!!!
671;This is a wonderful animated feature for your movie collection.
672;Enjoyed by kids and adults alike.
673;It is a really good movie that one can watch in loopedframeset, and brings Pixar to great movements of novelty with toys.
674;i really enjoyed the movie and am thankful to have bought it.
675;We love all of the Toy Story movies, especially this one with the introduction of Jessie and Bullseye!
676;We bought this for my daughter for Christmas, and it is a fun movie with unforgettable characters!
677;The movie was in perfect condition.
678;My son has seen it at least 7 times since we received it.
679;The shipping was also very satisfactory.
680;I just wanted to say what a great movie this was!
681;Let me preview by saying I am a 20 year old college student, so I think I can safely say this movie is for everyone!I am not much for cartoons or animations (i wasnt much into the first Toy Story or A Bugs Life), but this movie was incredibly funny.
682;It is very punny and was well worth the $5.50 to go see it!
683;Some of the implied meanings (a few scenes poke fun at Jurrasic Park, etc.) were an interesting twist to see in a G movie.
684;Give it a try and you will see what I mean.
685;are absolutely, totally in love with this movie, and would willingly sit and watch it over and over and over again.
686;This movie is a lifesaver for us.
687;Our 3yr old loves to watch it, and it gives us a few minutes to ourselves.
688;it took a few days to come, and it was quick and easy to order.
689;My 2 year old asks to see Buzz and Woody nearly daily!
690;I bought this for my 4 year old and she loves this.
691;Jesse the cowgirl is great for the little girls.
692;I think they did a good job.
693;It is a family movie.
694;This is an awesome movie.
695;The movie is adorable and the instant streaming is just so convenient.
696;not as good as the original and definitely not one of my favorite Pixar movies, but still a very good movie and enjoyable for someone even in their mid.20s.
697;If you are a kid or have kids, you'll have a good time.
698;They still have the best looking cartoons, but their cartoons have really suffered in recent offerings.
699;Thank goodness for the wizards at Pixar.
700;toy Story 2 is without a doubt one of the best films I have seen this year.
701;It was just so much fun from start to finish.
702;Trust me, the staff went together and everyone loved it.
703;Still, there are plenty of surprises along the way to make you forget the plot's weak points.
704;what really makes this film a classic is the action/adventure mix it has.
705;This film has honestly done what so few live action films can.
706;Those movies had no big ideas, they were just simply, fun, funny adventures that you took along with the characters on screen.
707;You will laugh a lot.
708;Pixar went for broke with this film and has produced an animation classic.
709;One of the few sequels that eclipses its predecessor.
710;the computer graphics are even better than before.
711;The film is everything you could imagine it to be, and more.
712;The rescue mission will certainly made everyone roar with laughter with all the hilarious things the toys do.
713;a wonderful sequel to Toy Story.
714;Like I said before, #1, and #2 are the best movies my son has.
715;He loves woody more than Buzz.
716;Not as original as the first Toy Story, but it is a very cute, well made movie.
717;This is a rare movie series in which I think the middle movie is actually better, just a little bit mind you, than the first and last.
718;"I thought it was very clever to bring the ""Antiques Roadshow"" world of toy collectibles into the story of a boy and his beloved toys."
719;"I loved the ""Cleaner"" who renovated Woody for Al, the ethically."
720;"For more plot details you can read many other reviews here
I:9592;721;On back of the package it lists the Extras, and it says """"and more."""""""
722;"so I thought for sure that performance would be the ""more"" part."
723;Listings on Amazon should be more detailed to show absolutely everything that is on the disc.
724;I had fun with Toy Story .
725;I really enjoyed the animation and the movie was fun.
726;There is something in this movie for everyone!
727;Lots of humour that the children did not even catch on to, and I get a bit more each time I see it!This movie is better than the first, and has even more for the whole family than the first!
728;I really enjoyed it, and my 4 year old daughter was enchanted .
729;Jesse has instantly made it to her sacred list of favorite Disney characters.
730;disney does many things right, but their stories with the messages of being true to yourself and true to your real friends are always outstanding.
731;These messages are so important for young kids, and Disney tells them well and memorably, in many ways.
732;And TOY STORY 2 is clearly one of the best renditions.
733;with outstanding vocal talent, including the return of Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, young and old alike are sure to enjoy this adorable, sentimental, and funny flim.
734;The story is typical happy ending Disney, the animation is excellent, the 3.
735;d effects are great, and the messages are perfect.
736;after the lights came up in the theatre, my wee one and I discovered that her 12 year old sister and her dad were also in the audience.
737;Which is just further proof that Disney is the premier maker of wonderful family entertainment.
738;the movie is very greater then toy story 1 the woody and buzz have become friends.
739;This was a christmas gift.
740;It came in on time and the person who received it as a gift was pleased.
741;Pixar's animation and story telling are absolutely wonderful.
742;This is a great sequel to Toy Story and a very fun movie to enjoy.
743;This is a great video for my son who is into Toy Story in general.
744;Still glad we bought it.
745;This is my favorite of the series.
746;I actually cried and loved the introduction of Jessie and Bullseye.
747;Great film for all ages.
748;I bought this for my boyfriend and it's entertaining even for adults.
749;He turned 3, and he loved it.
750;He plays with it every day now.
751;It is a family favorite.
752;This was a great copy of toy story 2, I looked everywhere for these movies and was very happy with Amazon.
753;hired Tom Hanks and Tim Allen to make this wonderful Toy Story sequel.
754;It's a wild ride, definitely one for the kids, and it comes highly recommended by me.
755;Also, love Jessie in the story.
756;It was such a clever idea.
757;But when Woody is kidnaped by the owner of Al's Toy Barn, He discovers he is a valuable collectors item from a hit T. v. show from the 50's.
758;It's a lot of fun and laughter for the whole family.
759;Love all three of the toy story movies.
760;Great for kids and entertaining and funny enough for adults to watch!
761;Another awesome movie that the kids love and enjoy to watch.
762;this was a gift so did not get to view this movie but I have heard from mother of child that she loves movie
763;They were so happy to get this along with the other two in the series!
764;Great video, brand new as described and my grandson loves it.
765;Toy Story 2 is that rare sequel that's actually as good as the original.
766;My 4 year old was completely captivated and there was plenty of adult humor to keep me entertained.
767;My grand kids love this trilogy and watch it over and over again!
768;This very funny video has such a good script, that grown.
769;ups can enjoy it as much as the kids.
770;"The toy characters are very funny
I:9592;771;Of course, Woody and Buzz Lightyear are the stars and they are witty, brave, and true.
I:9592;772;This movie is outstanding, and even better than the original!
I:9592;773;the movie is entertaining and lighthearted, the soundtrack is entertaining, and the action is spellbinding.
I:9592;774;This is a great movie for all ages.
I:9592;775;well, I have no kids and I figured these movies were primarily for kids.
I:9592;776;No matter who the targeted audience was, these movies will be enjoyed by people of all ages, with or without kids.
I:9592;777;i had a wonderful time watching Toys.
I:9592;778;The animation was great, the voice acting was just wonderful, and the storyline was very enjoyable as well.
I:9592;779;Again, I was very impressed with the clever, humorous and touching scenes.
I:9592;780;And as with the first, the voice acting was very good.
I:9592;781;To top it off, if young ones do watch it, it provides some good lessons on caring and friendship that shouldn't be missed.
I:9592;782;My son LOVESSSSSSSSS this movie so it's perfect for my house.
I:9592;783;The animation is wonderful and I love the soundtrack.
I:9592;784;This really keeps my 2 year olds attention and he loves Woody and Buzz.
I:9592;785;I think the first Toy Story was a little bit more unique/original/quippy, but this is great, too.
I:9592;786;I bought this for my 3 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it.
I:9592;787;She knows the characters and can name them all she as watched it so many times.
I:9592;788;This was just as good if not better than the original.
I:9592;789;I was totally caught up in this movie right along with my 4 year old.
I:9592;790;Cant wait to watch it again!
I:9592;791;Toy Story 2 is funny, exciting, dramatic, and very entertaining!
I:9592;792;Because it turns out that Woody is a valuable doll from the 1950's when he had his own popular TV show!
I:9592;793;The animation is tops, the plot is engrossing, and the movie is excellent!
I:9592;794;warming and wonderful family film.
I:9592;795;the movie is just as good as the first movie.
I:9592;796;with the introduction of new charaters makes the movie very fun and at times wonder what is going to happen next to either woody or what buzz was going to do to get woody back with all the other charaters.
I:9592;797;if you or your child(ren) love the fisrt movie then you will love the second movie just as much as the first one.
I:9592;798;My kids love this movie!
I:9592;799;It is a great product.
I:9592;800;I was so excited to be able to get this movie at such a good deal!
I:9592;801;up story to a good movie
I:9592;802;We have watched it multiple times and love it.
I:9592;803;This movie is arguably better than the first.
I:9592;804;Those are always a laugh.
I:9592;805;what can I say, a delightful movie
I:9592;806;Plus it brings back childhood memories.
I:9592;807;I bought this movie for my 2 1/2 year old grandson.
I:9592;808;It's so funny I had to tape him watching the movie.
I:9592;809;It's a very enjoyable movie for adults too.
I:9592;810;He loves the movie just as much as the Toy Story disk he has.
I:9592;811;It was delivered very fast and highly recommend the seller.
I:9592;812;This movie rocks and it is the best one Jessie is introduced and Buzz is already here we watch this one the most and love it
I:9592;813;It is one of those sequels that are as good or even better than the original.
I:9592;814;My kids are 3 and 18 months and they watch the whole movie without blinking.
I:9592;815;They love the characters and the story.
I:9592;816;We watch it with pleasure every time.
I:9592;817;My daughter was happy to recieve this on her bday!
I:9592;818;I am a huge fan of disney pixar films!!
I:9592;819;The tape is in good condition.
I:9592;820;They did send the item fast and the tape works great.
I:9592;821;GREAT Movie for a collector of Great movies and GREAT Acting.
I:9592;822;Something worth watching with others followed by a group discussion on games played in our youth.
I:9592;823;Another sparkling cutting edge Pixar film.
I:9592;824;this time, Andy is going to summer camp, and decides not to take Woody (Tom Hanks) since his arm is torn.
I:9592;825;Al also owns a toy store that advertises on T. v.
I:9592;826;Al brings Woody to his apartment and has his torn arm fixed.
I:9592;827;He has the choice to make of being behind glass and admired by old fans, or being part of a family with Andy"
828;There is an exciting crosstown adventure as they use the toy store's address to find Woody.
829;Jessie and Bullseye end up being part of the loving family in the end, but such an exciting, poignant adventure can't be missed.
830;There is also a lesson on enjoying and living in the present and not worrying about the past or future.
831;Toy Story 2 on vhs is a wonderful movie, just as good as the first Toy Story movie.
832;i was very happy that I was able to get a copy on vhs to add to my collection.
833;I have seen just about all of the Disney movies and this is among one of my favorites, as well as the rest of my family.
834;Another great movie in the Toy Story series.
835;The movie is enjoyable for just about all ages.
836;I enjoyed every dialog, every detail.
837;It comes as well in french and spanish.
838;We are very happy with this movie.
839;This is a film that is quite didactic and full of personal achievement and camaraderie, something rarely seen these days in theaters.
840;I recommend viewing in the company of children.
841;My grandkids just love it.
842;They like to see it again and again and they have so much fun and laght that is a pleasure to watch them!
843;The movie arrived on time and works great.
844;The theme of making a choice between your heart (stay with Andy), or your mind (live forever in a luxurious museum) makes this and excellent movie.
845;The introduction of Jessie is excellent.
846;I liked the movie my son loves toy story.
847;my son can watch this movie over and over.
848;This one of the best Toy Story movies I've ever seen.
849;The children love the Movie, and it's one movie they want to watch over and over again.
850;Can't beat any Toy Story, though 3 is the best because of the story line.
851;I've seen talking babies, cute animals of every species, heroic youngsters of all ethnicities and the prize goes to the toys.
852;It is better than the original and that was superb.
853;More importantly, I love this tape and would willingly watch it with them.
854;The vocal talents are brilliant.
855;The plot is sweet and poignant.
856;The jokes are actually funny to all members of the family and no person should be the least bit embarrassed to watch this cartoon.
857;Love the movie., great for all ages .
858;Recommend it to anybody .
859;It's always been nice to see a shout out to some of the most favored toys of my childhood.
860;There is much to like about Toy Story 2.
861;It's the perfect child's fantasy.
862;Buzz is an astronaut, and Woody is a cowboy.
863;She puts it in the sale, much to the horror of the other toys.
864;He is spied by a ruthless toy store owner who realizes Woody is a highly prized collectible and is worth a great deal of money.
865;The man promptly steals him, and now it is Woody who must be rescued by the other toys.
866;the story is charming, but the magic is in the animation.
867;This is Disney's third collaboration with Pixar Studios, which mainly uses state of the art computers and skilled technicians to create and animate its characters.
868;In this case, we see the computer at its finest.
869;The colors, the delineation and the attention to detail are all marvels to behold.
870;This marriage of the computer generated and the hand drawn is nearly perfect.
871;the commercial drawback I mentioned is due more to modern marketing than to the movie itself.
872;I wonder if the real toys inspired by these movies wind up being as beloved as the ones in the movie are.
873;The first Toy Story was memorable, but this movie proved itself to be a more than worthy sequel to its predecessor, with another fun toy.
874;They had not seen the first one and still loved it.
875;The oldest really liked Jessi (usually only likes girl characters do it was great that it had one) while our younger daughter was more into Woody.
876;It brought in something for everyone!
877;Buzz and Woody set very good examples of friendship and the rest of the amazing toys show very good team work.
878;Great, my grandson loves it!!!
879;He loves watching it and would watch it over and over.
880;A good sequel is hard to come by.
881;TOY STORY 2 is an example that sometimes this rule has some exceptions.
882;The new characters are outstanding, the scene where they parody the Luke Skywalker / Darth Vader relationship is stupednous, there are few boring Disney's kind songs.
883;It's for every age, but I thing adults will enjoy it more !!
884;Here is a sequel that equals its predecessor in sheer enjoyment.
885;Wonderful new characters make the story fresh.
886;Loved all the references to Star Wars.
887;This was one of the best videos we ever bought for our kids.
888;TOY STORY 2 is one of those sequels that is just as good as the movie that spawned it.
889;With even more brilliant Pixar animation and the return of all the main characters from the first, with some additional new ones, TOY STORY 2 is a delightful tale of toys and humans and the bond that exists in spite of the fact that one day the humans will grow up and abandon their toys.
890;Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammar and all the other great actors who voiced the characters bring life to these delightful toys and the animation once again is superlative.
891;A wonderful film for the entire family to enjoy.
892;"It is at Al's apartment that we learn the truth about why Woody is stolen
I:9592;893;Woody at first refuses to go with them but, as he learns more about his past and Stinky Pete smooth talks him Woody has a change of heart and decides to stay.
I:9592;894;This movie is a great follow up to the original Toy Story and we learn more about Buzz and Woody's past.
I:9592;895;Was a gift for a friend.
I:9592;896;This movie is great with the addition of """"new cast members"""" especially Jessie!"""
897;The humor is fun for both kids and adults and there are some good tunes as well.
898;"the concept of kids and their ""love"" for their toys."
899;I rank this high among the Pixar films that I love the most.
900;He loved both movies equally, he is only two years old.
901;The characters are just as funny and you can see how their bond has grown.
902;My folks just got a Blu.
903;ray player for Christmas, so I thought getting the two.
904;This may be a kids movie, but it is a favorite among the adults too.
905;my favorite is the first one.
906;Joan Cusack does a good job.
907;I also enjoy the adult humor.
908;Like when Zurg tells Buzz that he is his father, which gives it a satire to Star Wars.
909;And then crashes the toy car into everything).
910;And there's comedy that my niece can understand as humorous.
911;kids love this movie so it was worth purchasing the digital copy.
912;I like this movie a lot because it is a funny movie without a single dirty joke.
913;The movie is very funny, but the funniest part are the outakes in the credits.
914;Hilarious movie, a good watch.
915;One of the best movies I have ever seen is the Toy Story Trilogy.
916;I do say, that TS is better than TS2, but TS2 is very good.
917;It is a very good movie, and great for all ages.
918;This was a gift and I had it delievered to my granddaughter's door.
919;Great price and shipping speed, but the Blu.
920;My girls let out a cheer when Jessie appeared.
921;I love this movie for children.
922;Its very encouraging and seem to get their attention pretty quickly.
923;Toy Story 2 is one of the best animated movies in a while!
924;It is better than the original because it has a more fun plot.
925;I also liked the new characters, like Jessie, Bulls.
926;takes at the end were hilarious!
927;My whole family loved this movie and I think you will too.
928;Toy Story 2 is excellent!
929;I hope you have enjoyed my review.
930;"What the first ""Toy Story"" did well, the sequel does as good if not better."
931;The script was smartly written to give added depth to the characters and has them deal with issues that come out of leftfield but don't come off as farfethed, such as having to deal with the aspect that eventually, their owner will outgrow them.
932;Tim Allen and Tom hanks reprise their roles as Buzz and Woody, and they are hilarious.
933;Cowboy movie is what we watch often at our house.
934;one of the best sequels ever made!
935;Pixar did an outstanding job on this movie.
936;Most of the original cast participated in this project and did a great job.
937;Once again, Buzz (Tim Allen) and Woody (Tom Hanks) steal the show.
938;The addition of Joan Cusak as Jessie is a real treat.
939;The story line is amusing.
940;Toy Story 2 is just as good as (or even better than) Toy Story 1.
941;Great animation, very funny and teaches valuable lessons without the sadness.
942;Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 1 have such an original storyline that is so endearing, and it is such a well rounded movie that it is an excellent pick for all.
943;I also like the fact that the toys don't sing and dance as in most animated movies, and yet the music is excellent.
944;Me and my son play along to that part!
945;499 positive reviews and continuing.
946;This will be a classic TO INFINITY AND BEYOND !!!
947;The story was well set up, and actually topped the first.
948;It was interesting and funny.
949;I highly suggest it for every reason: It was funny, quick, intelligent, sweet, kind, enticing and interesting.
950;With Toy Story and A Bug's Life, they took animation into a whole new dimension .
951;There are bigger laughs, more thrilling set.
952;like locations, a song that with break your heart and a hilarious homage paid to Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.
953;In this rare case, the words 'classic' and 'sequel' belong side by side.
954;jokes, a handful of action scenes provide for excitement than we're used to seeing in an animated feature.
955;style baggage fracas, are all indicators of the growing confidence of the Pixar artists and the realization that computer animation has the potential to go head.
956;Nothing is as good as the first time, but this one still held their interest !
957;Grandson loves these guys !
958;This is perhaps Disney's best film yet, even managing to top the original, which is certainly a rare feat.
959;Thankfully though, the film also delivers to the kids though too, with plenty of visual jokes as well.
960;The new characters are great too .
961;I can think of countless children's films that have been spoiled by an overly schmaltzy ending, but this is genuinely heart.
962;Wisely picking Sarah McLachlan to sing the theme 'When She Loved Me', with her achingly sad vocals, works well.
963;quite frankly, this is a movie that crosses all boundaries as well as all expectations.
964;excellent video, great entertainment for kids and adults.
965;great story line and gripping from start to finish.
966;lovely to see this as such videos are a rarity nowadays.
967;Love the movie and my 2 year old is obsessed with Buzz Lightyear.
968;The movie is super cute and totally appropriate for kids
969;"film fans know the history of ""Toy Story 2""."
970;a great film, memorable characters.
971;They introduced Jessie and Bullseye in this film.
972;Buzz Lightyear is my favorite.
973;iF you want just the most and basic extras this is for you.
974;Toy Story 2The even more hugely successful sequal to the the hugely successful original, this is the most hilarious film I have seen for years.
975;Its cutting edge graphics are considerably better even than in the last film, with the human looking much better, if still not perfect.
976;The characters are brilliantly funny, and the storyline is exciting and avoids the cutesiness that could have marred the film.
977;Complete with it's constant film allusions and witty reinterpretations of life from a toy's view, this movie is an absolute gem.
978;Look out for the 'outtakes' during the credits as they are perhaps even more funny than the film itself!
979;Love this movie, got it on iPad for my grandchildren!
980;So convenient to have it available at the touch of their little fingers !
981;Wow this sequel is even better than the first one.
982;It's truely a family movie.
983;Anyone can watch it and smile.
984;The movie itself is one of the best CG animated ever made.
985;The delivery of the product was amazingly fast and brand new, as described.
986;This movie did a great job of turning the table from the first movie.
987;All three are great but I have my own preference for this one.
988;It's got moments of deep emotion without feeling like it's beating you up (which the third one does a little) and keeps the fun and the jokes coming at a steady pace.
989;I love Toy Story 2, and personally think it is the most entertaining movie of the entire Toy Story trilogy.
990;It contains the film, lots of bonus features such as deleted scenes, extra animated shorts, and of course the various interviews with cast and crew.
991;Other than this huge omission, this is a great product.
992;The movie is wonderful, the various disc menus are well.
993;A good sequel to the smash hit Toy Story.
994;A great family film in which the whole family with enjoy due to the humor and the charismatic characters that are involved.
995;With great voice overs by actors and great directing that made this a great film.
996;yes i liked teh movie and was pleased that it arrived when it did, would recommend it to anyone now
997;Toy Story 2 is as good, if not better, than the first one.
998;Unlike Disney's other sequels, this one is so good.
999;Lots of puns, laughs, and cute little moments.
1000;My roommate and I were practically laughing throughout the entire movie.
1001;We received it promptly, and the kids absolutely love it.
1002;It was shipped in excellent condition and I was very pleased with the seller.
1003;I bought this movie for my 5 year old son (and me!)
1004;There are too many good things about this movie to even put down here, just get it and if you don't have kids, get it anyway, it is truly entertaining.
1005;I bought this for my 2 year old since he loved the first one.
1006;This would be a perfect gift for any child or adult.
1007;received in great timing and after shopping around for prices this was the best deal I found!
1008;Toy story 2 another pixar classic that lives in Blue Ray.
1009;"This is a double treat
I:9592;1010;Hours of great entertainment and wonderful animation.
I:9592;1011;My two and three year old nephews love this movie, and can watch it over and over.
I:9592;1012;It tells a lovely story as well.
I:9592;1013;This movie holds up beautifully and is as much fun to watch now as it was when it was first come out.
I:9592;1014;My family loves watching it and you see new jokes and things in it every time you watch it.
I:9592;1015;I've never seen this movie, but I ordered it as a gift to ship to my grandson who is out.
I:9592;1016;the ordering was easy, the price was good, and it was delivered promptly and in good condition.
I:9592;1017;Firstly, it is visually striking, beautifully and artfully made.
I:9592;1018;but more importantly, it is well written, well acted, and well directed.
I:9592;1019;its funny, fast moving, surprising.
I:9592;1020;I'm 19, and I roared from laughter many times.
I:9592;1021;it really has enough in jokes and witticism to appeal to an adult, eventhough its a children's movie.
I:9592;1022;its a much better cinematic evening then most movies, for adults or for kids.
I:9592;1023;It's high adventure as the toys traverse the city without drawing attention to themselves in effort to track down Al and their missing pal.
I:9592;1024;like all of the other Pixar films I've enjoyed throughout the years, Toy Story 2 goes the route of clean models, uncannily fluid animation and detail.
I:9592;1025;Character personality takes the forefront to flashy effects or sheer number of sets used.
I:9592;1026;specific jokes common in films like Shrek or Ice Age.
I:9592;1027;I love the toy story movies and I was sad that they ended them.
I:9592;1028;But all good things must come to an end but I love that it comes with a digital copy!
I:9592;1029;The first Toy Story was amazing.
I:9592;1030;CGI had never looked so good,and the humor was bizarre and hilarious, so both children and adultscould enjoy it.
I:9592;1031;Adults and children are bound to love the sequel too, as shown by the film's $80 million opening weekend.
I:9592;1032;OK, high profits aren't always a good indication of a great movie (take Titanic or Star Wars: Episode 1 for example), but the high returns are actually justified in this one.
I:9592;1033;Woody discovers not only his roots, but also the true meaning of family.
I:9592;1034;Pop culture references allow adults to get some jokes that kids might miss, but the kids will have a blast watching this animated adventure.
I:9592;1035;and is hence more fun.
I:9592;1036;Got this for the growing day care of grand kids we're receiving.
I:9592;1037;Good story, clever, nostalgic, well done.
I:9592;1038;Easy for an adult to watch.
I:9592;1039;I'm surprised I never saw this before.
I:9592;1040;toy Story 2 seems to be their favorite, butToy StoryandToy Story 3are hugely popular with them also.
I:9592;1041;Excellent my autistic son loves this.
I:9592;1042;He was so glad to see it again after all those years of looking for a missing tape.
I:9592;1043;Its A good movie for kids, funny and very well made!
I:9592;1044;My kids like to watch it over and over, I found myself doing the same with them.
I:9592;1045;I Gave it to my granddaughter for Easter along with the Jessie doll, she loved it.
I:9592;1046;Good for children, great for all.
I:9592;1047;I strongly recommend this movie as with any of the Toy Story movies in the series.
I:9592;1048;Boy was I happy that they did!
I:9592;1049;Toy Story 2 is really a great movie that had us all laughing a lot.
I:9592;1050;It also provides for some very emotional moments (Jessie's song remembering her time as a favorite toy, among others).
I:9592;1051;Many of the jokes refer to the first Toy Story, so it really helps if you know that one.
I:9592;1052;What I personally liked best, though, has become a great habit with Pixar: The end trailors where the stars get to be their own self : Here especially Tour Guide Barbie was a blast!Enjoy.
I:9592;1053;We love to watch them.
I:9592;1054;We have all three episodes and enjoy them very much.
I:9592;1055;Tom Hanks and Tim Allen reunite to lead our favorite cast of toys into this exciting sequel and they bring back everything we know and love about Woody and Buzz.
I:9592;1056;notch animation also returns along with a new gang of voice actors who blend in nicely with the returning ones.
I:9592;1057;This movie goes above and beyond the bar normally set for sequels and I can only hope that work like this could actually raise that bar.
I:9592;1058;Nothing compares to the Shrek and Shrek II series.
I:9592;1059;My 3 yr old absolutely loves this movie and has made a great gift also.
I:9592;1060;fit right in with the old characters.
I:9592;1061;As a matter of fact, they are one of the main focuses.
I:9592;1062;What a funny little old man.
I:9592;1063;I believe that not only is it cute, but it has a good message.
I:9592;1064;One of the best sequels I've ever seen!
I:9592;1065;I bought this movie and recievied it a couple days later.
I:9592;1066;It was in perfect condition and I am glad to add it to my bideo library.
I:9592;1067;This was also a great price at the time.
I:9592;1068;I compared to other retailers and this was the best deal
I:9592;1069;I was 9 years old when this was released, and I loved it and the original ever since.
I:9592;1070;This sequel is just as good as the first.
I:9592;1071;Woody meets up with Jessie, Stinky Pete, and Bullseye who tell him just how famous he is.
I:9592;1072;I highly recommend TOY STORY 2!!!
I:9592;1073;I thought Toy Story 2 was just as good as the first Toy Story!
I:9592;1074;Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are just absolutley excellent!
I:9592;1075;Keep up the good work, and keep on making great Family movies like this one!!
I:9592;1076;This movie was a gift for my grandson but the whole family enjoyed it.
I:9592;1077;I loved the first Toy Story and was reluctant to see this one.
I:9592;1078;Disney can never manage a decent sequel.
I:9592;1079;The animation was nicely done and the characters were great.
I:9592;1080;Being a Star Wars fan, I appreciated it.
I:9592;1081;Anyway, the story line was good and I loved Jessie.
I:9592;1082;Finally Disney has pulled off a good sequel.
I:9592;1083;Toy Story is one of the best Disney movies of all time for children and it is also so enjoyable for the whole family.
I:9592;1084;The Toy Story legacy continues with this 2nd movie and I think it was great.
I:9592;1085;I would recommend this movie and the first and third one as well to anyone!
I:9592;1086;package was original and the discs are working great.
I:9592;1087;Kids I've watched watch this movie are totally absorbed in the movie and I found that I was also """"stirred"""" by many parts almost the same way I would be with a well acted movie with real people."""
1088;It held my interest throughout.
1089;It's not often a sequel comes along that is as impressive as the original.
1090;"This is true even for Disney (remember ""Son of Flubber""?)"
1091;"The idea is a good one
I:9592;1092;The answer that we found in """"Toy Story"""" continues with the further antics of Woody and Buzz Lightyear."""
1093;"It's just as hilarious as ""Toy Story"" and just as heart."
1094;"like its' predecessor, ""Toy Story 2"" is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family and that is really saying a lot in this day and age."
1095;Kudos as well to Pixar who has teamed up with them on both movies.
1096;layered in a way that I still can't quite get over, it's got everything from good fun and drama for kids to genuine questions of identity and meaning for adults.
1097;Plus, of course, some great jokes.
1098;Like most good kids films, this one has been played hundreds of times at our place, to the point where I could probably recite every line by heart, but it still has the power to move me.
1099;My kids watch it all the time and easy for adults to watch over and over too!
1100;The animation in the second Toy Story movie is even better than the first.
1101;There are so many funny things in this movie.
1102;Perhaps it is the child in all of us that loves animation.
1103;Through some great detective work they figure out where Woody is.
1104;as a fan of Tom Hanks, I love that he is the voice for Cowboy Woody.
1105;All the voice casting is perfect.
1106;Mr. Potato Head is so cute.
1107;All the toys are animated to their full potential.
1108;I thought the horse was absolutely the best toy and really took on a personality.
1109;Simply amazing computer animation and a must see!
1110;Most of the Pixar films are gems and the Toy Story sequels are no exception.
1111;Love the characters and the story.
1112;This fun for all the family!!!
1113;The video works wonderfully, and it arrived quite quickly.
1114;not that big of a deal for me because I kept it for my son, and he loves it.
1115;Like my title says, I have a two year old that loves this movie.
1116;She loves to scream out the names of the characters as they appear on screen.
1117;This has to be the best movie for 2.3 yr.
1118;As good as the first.
1119;Bought as a gift for a grandchild.
1120;An instant classic with all of the lovable characters back for another adventure.
1121;More fantastic animation, humor, voices, and a great story to boot!
1122;There's a good time to be had watching and finding out.
1123;I loved it as much as my grandchildren.
1124;A good story on friendship and how important it is to all.
1125;loving movie that you can sit down and enjoy and get lost in the story.
1126;That is a good movie!
1127;that aside, the movie itself was pretty durned good.
1128;husband of a collector, I've observed the pathology at close range for an extended period of time, and whoever wrote this part and coached Knight did a superb job.
1129;This is about as good a portrayal of the collector as I've ever seen.
1130;"nemesis
I:9592;1131;the graphics and animation are top.
I:9592;1132;notch, which we've come to expect in a flick that will keep the kids entertained and provides more than enough plot to keep the adults going, too.
I:9592;1133;My favorite part is the Jesse story, with the Sarah McLachlan song in the background, I actually got misty eyed the first time I saw it.
I:9592;1134;This is the best animated movie I have ever seen, period.
I:9592;1135;The rare sequel that keeps up with the original.
I:9592;1136;This film is great fun for all ages.
I:9592;1137;Characters are warm and, dare I say it, human.
I:9592;1138;thanks Disney for remembering that a clean, G. film can be fun and successful.
I:9592;1139;Your whole family will enjoy it.
I:9592;1140;This time Woody gets kidnapped and meets characters from his past which he had forgotten about and now must come to grips and choose between the friends from his past and those he has now.
I:9592;1141;buzz and some of the rest of the gang come to Woody's resue.
I:9592;1142;this is the best movie sequel that I have seen in a long time.
I:9592;1143;The animation surpasses that of Toy Story and the story line is fantastic.
I:9592;1144;this movie has imagination and creativity.
I:9592;1145;so i highly recommend this movie
I:9592;1146;Finally decided to watch this over the summer and it was great.
I:9592;1147;Excellent movie for the entire family!
I:9592;1148;FINALLY, something that keeps his interest long enough for me to clean the house for a little while!
I:9592;1149;The grand children love watching Woody, Jesse, and Buzz.
I:9592;1150;This is the favorite movie of my 3 yr old son.
I:9592;1151;We all enjoyed the movie and shared it with three grandchildren!
I:9592;1152;Great experience for us all.
I:9592;1153;The price was right also.
I:9592;1154;The feeling it gives you is one you may have thought you outgrew .
I:9592;1155;much more than a kid's movie, this is a movie with a sentimental heart for everyone.
I:9592;1156;The toys, their star voices, the computerized.
I:9592;1157;breathing animation are so well thought out and imagined that you are swept up instantly into the simple story.
I:9592;1158;Highlights include the wonderful race through the toy store aisles, complete with Barbies singing and dancing, and the surprisingly moving Randy Newman song, which underscores Jessie's flashback.
I:9592;1159;I loved this movie, and recommend it especially to those who didn't believe, as I did not, that the marriage of computer technology and animation could be this electrifying and delightful and, well, REAL.
I:9592;1160;My children love Toy Story so it is a nice change from the original.
I:9592;1161;My kid loves the Toy Story series!
I:9592;1162;This movie is an instant classic.
I:9592;1163;Toy story 2 is as expected is entertaining and educative.
I:9592;1164;It has a good story and plot.
I:9592;1165;I strongly recommend this movie to everybody.
I:9592;1166;Toy Story 2 is the perfect sequel.
I:9592;1167;It recaptures everything from the first movie but still is able to up the stakes.
I:9592;1168;The main characters return but a slew of new, and as interesting, charactes show up.
I:9592;1169;while ANdy is away at camp, Woody finds himself in a new pickle.
I:9592;1170;A toy collector kidnaps him and introduces him to Roundup Gang.
I:9592;1171;It's great in every way.
I:9592;1172;the two disc set is as packed as the first one.
I:9592;1173;It seems all of the toy stories are a hit with the kids.
I:9592;1174;So here starts the adventure.
I:9592;1175;It is better than the original and that says something by itself.
I:9592;1176;So was Toy Story part 1 but this one is better.
I:9592;1177;The movie plotting is a lot better in this part.
I:9592;1178;I give it five stars(I'd give it six if it was in my hands!)
I:9592;1179;We both liked to watch the credits at the end of the film.
I:9592;1180;Anything with Buzz in it is a real hit here.
I:9592;1181;Love the characters and voices of the actors, a must movie for the whole family.
I:9592;1182;I started collecting metal cars for my Grandkids to enjoy in their later years because of this movie.
I:9592;1183;This movie engaged my attention with every scene.
I:9592;1184;More complex than the original, Toy Story 2 combines several subplots that add to the suspense but are still simple enough for kids to follow.
I:9592;1185;This movie takes the personification of toys to a new, surprisingly deep level.
I:9592;1186;We see here the inevitability of growing up, but also the need to care for others and enjoy childhood while it lasts.
I:9592;1187;The voice work is superb, and the dialogue sharp and entertaining .
I:9592;1188;saga of Buzz Lightyear and his enemy hilarious.)
I:9592;1189;The computer work is also new and improved, with more convincing depictions of humans (though the faces still look a little cartoonish) and one very believable hyperactive puppy.
I:9592;1190;Good clean fun, and a lot of it.
I:9592;1191;OK this movie is a great movie probably as good as the first.
I:9592;1192;Ultimate Box has a whole disc dedicated to the concept and making of TS.
I:9592;1193;it's one for the ages.
I:9592;1194;One of the few shows that improves as you watch it again and again and again!
I:9592;1195;Love the story, love the characters, love the action.
I:9592;1196;I loved the first one, yet this one was far better than the first.
I:9592;1197;It is full of laughs, excitement, and a great storyline.
I:9592;1198;These toys create a world that everyone wishes they could live in.
I:9592;1199;I am proud to say that this is my favorite movie!
I:9592;1200;People of all ages will love this movie.
I:9592;1201;This sequence is much better than Toy Story 1.
I:9592;1202;The neat idea of some classic scenes related to other hot movies (Jurassic park and Star wars) make me laughter to tears.
I:9592;1203;And the storyline is much mature than the previous one.
I:9592;1204;And the music is excellent, the song sung by the female cowboy is very moving.
I:9592;1205;We both love this movie .
I:9592;1206;up to Toy Story 1, and arguably less scary for young children.
I:9592;1207;We have enjoyed watching it many times since receiving it.
I:9592;1208;In this review I actually have 3 subjects to brag about!
I:9592;1209;It was fantastic and I do believe it could be Disney at his best!So then part two came out and I had to go to the theatres to see it plus put it on pre.
I:9592;1210;line make this movie one of the very best from Disney.
I:9592;1211;I can only hope they will make a part three.
I:9592;1212;thanks a lot to Amazon.
I:9592;1213;com and Disney for allowing us to get what we want when we want it!
I:9592;1214;My grandson loves all three movies!
I:9592;1215;Of course, this is an amazing follow.
I:9592;1216;The Toy Story Series is the epitome of excellent childhood entertainment.
I:9592;1217;There are plenty of life lessons included in the fun.
I:9592;1218;My son loves this movie and will watch every chance he gets.
I:9592;1219;Great movie for my little one.
I:9592;1220;Woody's adventure leads to new friends for the toy story crew and does not disappoint.
I:9592;1221;This was an even funnier and clever movie than the first Toy Story.
I:9592;1222;The plot was great and easy to understand for children and yet interesting to adults as well.
I:9592;1223;I would recommend this to everyone who wants to laugh or smile.
I:9592;1224;Exactly, and this extra little bit of fun and humor speaks volumes about the creativity and overall pleasure Pixar takes in the wonderful work they do.
I:9592;1225;A fantastic movie for both adults and kids, expanding on the original, but much more than your typical Disney knockoff.
I:9592;1226;This is a funny film.
I:9592;1227;My daughter (21 months) also liked Toy Story.
I:9592;1228;Later, my son got upset because they took Woody and he was being """"sent away""""."""
1229;It is because of this that I give it 4 stars.
1230;My husband and I thought this was a great movie.
1231;While I don't think this one is as good as the first, this film was entertaining for the adults and the kids.
1232;It still manages to draw on favorite characters and the conundrums they are good at getting themselves into, without being boring or terribly predictable.
1233;The addition of new characters was fun.
1234;the kids really like this sequel, and it's a good, insightful family movie, without being terribly sentimental or insipid.
1235;Good thing, as I'm sure we will be watching for years to come.
1236;I'm a big fan of most of the Pizar movies, and this one is toward the top for me.
1237;I thought the second installment was almost as good as the first.
1238;It's fun, funny, and has good values of sticking by your friends.
1239;It is very rare to find a sequel that is just as enjoyable as its predecessor, but this is one of those rare cases.
1240;Since the first film, Buzz and Woody have become the greatest of friends and all in Andy's room has been happy go lucky until the day of the family garage sale.
1241;this is a touching story, with some great twists.
1242;The animation is flawless as usual and the enjoyment level, and humor are at any all time high.
1243;The video was in great shape and my grandson is very happy to play it over and over and over.
1244;This one is adorable and touching as well.
1245;The animation is even more realistic and lively.
1246;It's the story though, that truly astounded me.
1247;It is sentimental and funny.
1248;The toys can be symbolic of a best friend from childhood, and with the way the world is today, it is easy to grow apart as we grow up.
1249;I believe that this is the true heart of this movie.
1250;while this is certainly a great movie for kids, adults like me, will certainly find the humor and entertainment value in it as well.
1251;I love this movie and amazon delivered on time.
1252;Now I am able to allow the kids to watch the movie at home on the blu.
1253;And considering that Disney standardizes all their prices, this is a great price deal.
1254;My child bit the last cowboy hat so just as well.
1255;"if you like cartoons, you will like all the Toy Story videos that are on the market
I:9592;1256;All 3 Toy Story movies are fun to watch for both the adults and kids in our family.
I:9592;1257;This is a great addition to a family movie collection.
I:9592;1258;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:9592;1259;I got it to watch with the grand kids!I enjoy toy story ALL of them
I:9592;1260;Toy Story 2 is one of those unforgettable films that entertains all ages and exceeds all our expectations!
I:9592;1261;It's got it all .
I:9592;1262;excitement, humor, and tons of fun!
I:9592;1263;It's also a great movie for little 3.
I:9592;1264;year old kids, since it has practically no violence.
I:9592;1265;In another sense, it is also mature enough for an adults with plain.
I:9592;1266;Like I said, Toy Story 2's got it all.
I:9592;1267;I grew up watching it and now that I have kiddos of my own they love it as well.
I:9592;1268;one of the best movies for children and adults.
I:9592;1269;Toy Story 2 has got the most amazing special effects and animation that i have seen, its just a shame that the story was a bit dodgy.
I:9592;1270;Mrs Potatoe Head is Funny, Jessie is pretty good, but i think the little green aliens steal the show.
I:9592;1271;(you saved our lives we are eternily grateful) If you saw the first then you are going to have to see this one.
I:9592;1272;Cute for the children and sophisticated enough for adults.
I:9592;1273;She did see Toy Story 1 and 3 before this one .
I:9592;1274;Love the Toy Story films.
I:9592;1275;My elder daughter enjoyed these films when she was younger, and not my younger one enjoys these films as well.
I:9592;1276;I enjoyed the first Toy Story movie, even thought I couldn't beleive that Tom Hanks was the voice of Woody in the first and is again in this film.
I:9592;1277;And this time Woody is famous.
I:9592;1278;This is one of those movies my grandson and I have bonded over.
I:9592;1279;As usual the transfer is great as is the story.
I:9592;1280;i had been told that there would be a slight delay in receiving this item but I was pleasantly surprised when I received it within 2 days of ordering it.
I:9592;1281;I thought that this one was better that the first, and it was cuter.
I:9592;1282;I hope that they make one!
I:9592;1283;The special effects in this one were great!
I:9592;1284;My 5 year old son loves TS2.
I:9592;1285;Jessie recalling in song how her owner played with her then abanded her is a real tear jerker.
I:9592;1286;The animation is great, the voices really match.
I:9592;1287;Traits like loyalty and challenging oneself are emphaiszed during this movie.
I:9592;1288;I bought this movie knowing it was used and in 'acceptable' condition.
I:9592;1289;Toy Story and Toy Story II proves that good, clean, wholesome movies can be just as profitable as anything else they have made.
I:9592;1290;My thanks to Pixar for their superior film making.
I:9592;1291;John Lasseter, Lee Unkrich, and Ash Brannon's """"Toy Story 2"""" is that rare sequel that improves upon the original."""
1292;By upping the emotional and pop culture quotient in this second outing, Disney and Pixar have succeeded in producing a memorable film that will appeal to filmgoers of all ages.
1293;"performers in ""Toy Story 2"" all do great work again."
1294;Newcomers Cusack and Grammer help make Jessie and Stinky Pete worthy additions to the lineup and the two of them actually steal a lot of the spotlight from Woody and Buzz.
1295;The story this time around has a lot more depth to it and invokes a lot of childhood nostalgia when it is not taking jabs at the modern toy collector.
1296;"Simply put, ""Toy Story 2"" is as much a treat for kids as it is for every adult who lost a little something when they outgrew their childhood friends."
1297;More characters, More laughs, more TOY STORY MOVIES PLEASE!
1298;Pixar knows what they're doing.
1299;They have created yet another unforgettable picture.
1300;The script is hilarious to adults and children.
1301;You know, you'll laugh because you get the joke, then kids will laugh because you're laughing.
1302;It's a funny, touching and remarkable piece of work.
1303;I choose politically correct but safe, over slyly entertaining and wickedly cutting.
1304;"Those ""modern classics"" are great for adults, what with their modern spin, dialogue, etc. but why give the kids a head."
1305;We really loved this movie.
1306;She has Woody and Buzz all lined up next to her when she watches the video.
1307;I was apprehensive after LOVING Toy Story 1 but this one is great too!
1308;my children love this, i have 5 y/o boy/girl twins and they both love this movie.
1309;We enjoyed the second installment of the series.
1310;My boys are enjoying them.
1311;'Toy Story 2' might not be as much of a milestone, but it makes up for it by being a terrific movie.
1312;Look, bottom line: PIxar makes great movies.
1313;Ergo, this is a great movie.
1314;This was an excellent movie!
1315;Although the storyline wan't that great as the original, the characters, the settings, and the humor was much more improved.
1316;If you liked the first Toy Story, you'll love this one too.
1317;though that was good too!
1318;Animation has improved, characters can be sympathised with, they've managed to get out of the shadow of the first film, and it's good for kids, adults and teenagers alike.
1319;Rarely do I find a movie that enthralls me, keeps my attention throughout, and has a perfect ending, but I've found all this in Toy Story 2.
1320;My family loved Toy Story.
1321;But the sequel is even better.
1322;have for movie lovers, especially Pixar aficionados.
1323;Toy Story 2 deserves five stars : 1 for the crisp clear animation,2 for the sound,3.
1324;I love this trilogy and can watch it over and over again.
1325;So, it did the job during the trip.
1326;The movie is great and the multiple viewing options with this package makes it a great value.
1327;My grand son loves this movie.
1328;It is brilliant, the animation is excellent and the script even funnier than the first movie.
1329;All the old crew are aboard as well as some excellent new additions.
1330;Plus those cute little aliens get a slightly bigger part and probably provide the funniest moment of the movie.
1331;If you think you are too old for this type of movie you are wrong, the humour is there for everybody and believe me you will laugh.
1332;I brought the tape in good condition.
1333;The one bad thing is the day after I ordered it I found it at the local second hand store for 79 cents.
1334;up copy since it took me so long to locate one at a decent price.
1335;I recommend getting media from this site it was quick and fast from the time I ordered it to the time I got it within a week.
1336;The kid's will watch it over and over and over again,Trust me.
1337;My family loves this movie!
1338;Prefect for the whole family.
1339;A great sequel to Toy Story with even more characters added.
1340;It was as described and works likes new.
1341;Shipping and transaction was great.
1342;Woody finds out he was part of a major children's puppet show (Like Howdy Doody) and that he is a very valuable doll.
1343;He meets Jessie who is part of his round.
1344;Woody still holds loyalty to Andy.
1345;"Jessie sings a beautiful song ""When she loved me"" about her child Emily."
1346;this is a great story about loyalty and frienship.
1347;Toy Story 2, as well as the first movie, gives a possitive message to children and are a refreshing change of pace.
1348;There are some children that do have an enotional attachment to their toys and do keep them into their adulthood.
1349;Toy story is a movie that can be enjoyed by both adults and children.
1350;I actually like this movie better then the first!
1351;year old daughter loved it .
1352;that is the best barometer for success that I know, for these type films!
1353;I will give the film credit for Buzz and the gang 's rescue mission which I admit got a laugh here and there, and the film does have a strong message.
1354;I just have my own personal issues with this film.
1355;This one is just one of my least favorite Pixar films.
1356;This was a great follow up to the original Toy Story movie.
1357;My 3 year old loves it.
1358;This is the movie that will take you to another world as you feel for each of the characters.
1359;You become involved with their adventures, cheering them on and when the movie comes to an end, you will be asking for more.
1360;I felt that this movie was better than the first.
1361;"Don't get me wrong, I also really enjoyed the first one
I:9592;1362;They took something great and made it better.
I:9592;1363;overall, an absolutely wonderful show for all in your family.
I:9592;1364;I had seen this one at the movie theatre but watching it with my wife and daughter made it more special.
I:9592;1365;I think Toy Story is the best animated movie.
I:9592;1366;I recommend you read my review of """"Toy Story"""", which reviews the entire trilogy."""
1367;This is a very great movie.
1368;Watching this happan is why this is the greatest trilogy in Hollywood history.
1369;My 3 year old grandson loves Toy Story 2.
1370;He has Buzz, Woody and Jessie and brings them over to our house almost every day.
1371;The action in the movie keeps him watching and he has his favorites and I have my favorites.
1372;(Rex) There is some humor that the little ones don't pick up on but the adults will :) Disney puts out some good movies.
1373;This movie is an incredible animation great for the whole family.
1374;Mr. Potato Head gave an outstanding performance.
1375;Just like the original movie, TS 2 is awesome!
1376;This is a movie that any kid will love!
1377;The kids love this film because it's more good fun with Buzz and Woody.
1378;I love this film because it has a surprisingly sophisticated storyline.
1379;Woody's dilemma (full life vs. sterile immortality) is presented in a way that is touching without becoming maudlin.
1380;jokes, movie spoofs, and eye.
1381;popping Pixar animation make it a hoot to watch!
1382;Now i can watch them all back to back to back!
1383;One of the best sequels and best films in cinema history,Disney and Pixar's 3rd film and the blockbuster sequel to Toy Story.
1384;"Woody learns he is not an ordinary toy, he is actually legendary toy from the 1950s and a pop culture icon on a tv show called ""Woody's roundup and other products."
1385;This film is spetacular,brilliant,the toys still rule,funny,incredible.
1386;Featuring the original voice talents of Tom Hanks , Tim Allen and the rest of them.
1387;also Featuring new voice talents such as Joan Cusack,Kelsey Grammer and Wayne Knight.
1388;bring home the thrilling adventure of the toys in this nonstop funny animated classic.
1389;'Toy Story' was a landmark film for Disney and animation in general.
1390;A sequel rarely lives up to its predecessor and history had shown that a great deal.
1391;'Toy Story 2' did a great deal of things that were right on target to making a great movie.
1392;The first positive was bringing the cast back.
1393;Tom Hanks and Tim Allen reprised their roles as Woody and Buzz and just did what they did in the first movie.
1394;Of course with a new movie it means new toys.
1395;We are introduced to some great new characters that have just as an important role to play as the originals.
1396;The second positive was the story its self.
1397;This new movie put these wonderful characters into a much larger situation than just hanging around in Andy's room.
1398;The toys encounter the challenges of the outside world, at least for a toy and the humor that is thrown in as well as a few movie references all worked perfectly.
1399;Of course along with the adventure side of the movie another major positive in this movie comes with a very emotional and very real message.
1400;'Toy Story 2' introduces the fans to the concept of children growing up and leaving their toys behind.
1401;The message is summed up by the new character Jessie and a wonderful song preformed by Sarah MacLauchlan.
1402;The montage that goes with the song is just so real and somber you can't believe that this is something that ends up in a movie like Toy Story.
1403;I think that is why people of all ages love this movie.
1404;It's because of the fact that Pixar, while it has the opportunity to make a sequel, they want it to be loved by everyone.
1405;Pixar films, while they may gross millions at the box office are just filled with so much emotion and heart.
1406;Each one is such a great film and filled with so much that people appreciate and it's because of the thought and heart that is added to each distinct film is why they are appreciated as much as they are.
1407;Once you have seen the final installment, you will find out just how important this film is to the saga and it will make you appreciate it so much more.
1408;I enjoyed 'Toy Story 2' so much and would recommend it to anyone young or old.
1409;This is a great sequel to the first Toy Story.
1410;It was great and I love the toy story series of movies.
1411;This was received very timely and in excellent condition and works great.
1412;The Toy Story series was a genius movie series.
1413;You and your family can watch this movie over and over laughing every time.
1414;Many very big stars voiced these characters.
1415;An all around great movie.
1416;I love Disney and I love Toy Story.
1417;I saw this movie when I was in high school in the theatre and loved it.
1418;Needless to say my son is a huge fan of the Toy Story Triology too.
1419;Toy Story 2 is a great movie!!
1420;By the way 2 is a lot better than 1.
1421;In this movie, Woody gets stolen by Al and what else is really exciting about this movie is that the characters go to a toy store, and a airport.
1422;Rex is my favorite character in this movie.
1423;2 also makes me into laughter compared to 1 which was nolaughter.
1424;The animation is fantastic, the story is great and the character interactions are terrific.
1425;in one memorable scene, Buzz Lightyear meets another who is still new and in the box.
1426;Watch for a hilarious Bug's Life/Toy Story crossover outtake in the closing credits.
1427;in short, a film that will be loved by grown.
1428;Toy Story 2 continues to keep the imagination alive with even more funny references to various movies recreated in toy form.
1429;I'd still recommend it, but bring the tissues.
1430;My 20 month old son loves Toy Story, it's the only moves which really keep his attention and they really keep him happy even the emotional sections.
1431;I may not have liked it all that much but I give it 4 stars because my kids loved it almost as much s the first.
1432;The back story on Woody is interesting and the siren.
1433;call of fame and glory shows interesting aspects of Woody's character.
1434;And the movie elicits many laughs!
1435;seat adventures of Woody's would.
1436;I already loved the Toy Story series of movies.
1437;Made watching this movie again seem new and exciting!
1438;Kids seemed to be extra entertained!
1439;Yes it's true and people didn't think it could be done, Buzz and Woody back for a second adventure.
1440;woody is stolen by a rare toy collector when he accidentally ends up in a yard sale.
1441;along the way on this mission we encounter a few new toys who are also a part of the Woody toy collection.
1442;My son loves Toy Story, and this is a very nicely translated Chinese edition.
1443;It kept the story intact with some interesting Chinese twist.
1444;Haha blu ray is the best!!!!!
1445;Not as good as the first but it is still good.
1446;Of course, the entire film is also filled with hilarious sight gags, situations, and jokes that both children and adults will enjoy with equal enthusiasm.
1447;In terms of both humor and storytelling, this effort eclipses the original by quite a wide margin.
1448;plus, the addition of the Bullseye and Jessie characters are welcome (and vital) new additions to the show, as their presence leads to some pretty tense emotional drama.
1449;The best part of it is, you won't even feel as if you are watching nothing but a bunch of carefully constructed pixels.you will come to view them as characters as real as you or I. thus, in a remarkable feat, Pixar was able to improve on the ground.
1450;As good as the first, my son loves Woody, Buzz and the whole Toy Story gang.
1451;And of course he watches it over and over again, good one, we love it.
