id;spiegazione
1;but i wanted to see this one cuase it looked good.
2;It's a good movie, it's not bad.
3;but i do like that fact that this movie is based on a true story or true events.
4;This film was inspired by a true story.
5;A man walks through the streets.
6;There is a gambling casino in town.
7;He recovers and returns home.
8;The casino operator owns the town.
9;Cris takes a big stick and returns to the casino to recover his special force medallion that was stolen from him.
10;Cris is arrested and represents himself at the trial.
11;[This plague of the country is seldom mentioned in Hollywood films.
12;Guess who wins?The original 1972 film had a raw and gritty story that was far, far better.
13;i went to see this movie and was very pleased with it.
14;i thought the rock did an excellent job.
15;i loved the rundown so i had to check this one out too.
16;but found it very entertaining.
17;that's really all that can be said about this.
18;"This was one of his earlier films and still a great film
19;Hollywood has a habit of taking and doing re.
20;This movie however, relying on The Rock's star power from his days in WWE did quite well.
21;i was impressed by this.
22;I like the Rock and he flexes his muscle in this film with as much charisma as ever.
23;This is a good one with enough raw violence to satisfy those who are becoming bored with the same old martial arts formulas.
24;He was one person who lived a life with even more adventure and blood and guts than is potrayed by the fictional characters of this film.
25;The supporting cast basically utters filler dialogue throughout the entire movie, and the main characters do their best to ignore them"
26;You see, both movies came out on my twenty.
27;"I loved this movie
28;I'd recommend it to anyone that's into exciting action movies complete w/ comedy,drama, and a dash of irony!
29;To this day, this is *still* the best movie I've seen the Rock star in.
30;I share the opinion that the Rock never should have left wrestling, but seeing a remake of an old 1973 classic titled 'Walking Tall' helps me see that the Rock is a decent movie star after all.
31;It's just a movie that's above average, with good, memorable action segments.
32;It is enjoyable though and while the story is based on a true story it still makes you scratch your head sometimes.
33;Dwayne Johnson Makes this remake worth seeing, I really enjoyed this sleeper.
34;Lots of action and he speaks Proper English.
35;gridiron Gang (Full screen)is pretty close.
36;That goes south so he joins the military.
37;He comes home to """"heal his mind"""" and everything has changed."""
38;His hometown has turned into a place for drugs and gambling so he has to clean it up.
39;walking tall is a great remake.
40;this is a great movie to watch and it will never get boring.
41;i actually enjoy it, full of lively characters in the good people and the villians you root for the good guys.
42;but it is pretty violent and it does have mild strong sexual content involving girls lap dance a pole , but thank goodness there's no nudity .
43;Johnny Knoxville is Great in this film,i'll never look at wood the same way again , you'll get the joke when you see the film.
44;I love this movie starring The Rock.
45;It has enough action to entertain any action junky.
46;As he stands over the jury he claims he is going to run for sheriff and clean up this town and that is why he is innocent of smashing private property and assaulting 6 people.
47;"At once he fires the entire police force and hires one friend
48;from here on it is ass kicking all over the place.
49;i give it three thumbs up.
50;First, I love Dwayne Johnson, second Johnny Knoxville is great in this movie too.
51;I'm not a fan of his Jack Ass movies, but this was great!
52;Some really good action in the film, plot was ok as well.
53;Kept my interest for the most part.
54;Walking Tall has the basis to become a classic movie.
55;It shows he has the potential to become a great leading actor.
56;In Walking Tall, The Rock walks tall and is a class act throughout.
57;It's noted that Johnny Knoxville did a great job playing his character.
58;In all, the movie was The Rock's best film by far.
59;This is a wonderful remake/tribute.
60;The Rock did an outstanding job in this role.
61;And I was actually surprised how close to the original story this movie followed.
62;God Bless You Buford and god bless you Rock for a great job!
63;Knoxville and The Rock are a good pair of longtime friends in a small rural Washington town overun by corruption.
64;Check this film out, a reasonably done film good for a thrill or two.
65;I love it!Funny move at some pointsI really loved the action in the movieAny thing with The Rock I'm in!
66;I actually really like but as I said, a totally new story.
67;Movie is great to watch over and over.
68;I enjoyed this new release.
69;It is definitely a movie.
70;I do believe """"The Rock"""" has that screen presence that carries a project."""
71;I don't see his acting winning a lot of awards, but I do see action fans backing this guy for the next ten years or so.
72;the Audio Commentary by The Rock was absolutely hilarious.
73;The Rock has a great sense of humor.
74;He, like The Rock, has a great screen presence and it should have been used more.
75;With respect to their opinions .
76;in this remake they change the name and move the town to the Pacific Northwest.
77;It is a decent action flick with the hero and his comedy sidekick, Johnny Knoxville, going head to head with the bad guys.
78;Good action film for Dwayne Johnson.
79;Drugs, gambling, and pornography have seeped their way into this once proud town.
80;On a visit to the casion, Vaughn decides he has seen enough, and things start to happen.
81;the Rock brings his charisma to the role of Chris Vaughn.
82;He successfully pulls off the role of likeable, respectable returning soldier.
83;While the role doesn't stretch his talents as an actor, he was perfect for the part.
84;Johnny Knoxville also shines in this movie.
85;Templeton becomes Vaughn's deputy and helps clean up the town.
86;I'm not usually a fan of Knoxville's, but he managed to give just the right performance for this movie.
87;There is the 'making of' documentary in which all the actors talk about how they approached their characters and wonderful everyone else was to work with (once you have watched enough of these, you can begin to fill in the dialogue yourself).
88;What it is is a lot of fun and a good movie to pick up when you need something to do that doesn't take a lot of thinking.
89;Its also good when you are looking for a movie that doesn't have a bunch of tired special effects.
90;I'd recommend it to fans of the rock, fans of old westerns, and fans of simply fun action movies.
91;It is filled with action from beginning to end, and the chemistry between Johnson and Knoxville is incredible.
92;There are many good lines scattered throughout the movie, and it is quite funny.
93;It gives a feel of the originals but with more humor.
94;I was pleasantly surprised to see the movie dedicated to Sheriff Pusser.
95;all in all, I'd say this movie is worth a watch.
96;It's not an academy award winner, but it is entertaining.
97;He was even good in that movie, and I felt that he would become the newest action star.
98;The actor that will make many action movies, they will all hit number one, and make tons of money.
99;It wasn't really that good of a movie, but it was good for what it was.
100;He sees his friend Ray, and the two then go check out the casino.
101;He becomes under arrest, and at the trial he vows that if he is innocent, he will run for sheriff and bring good to the two.
102;I enjoyed it for what it was.
103;I love this movie it so rocked the rock rules this movie everyone should have it lol love it lol
104;if you like the rock dwayne johnson you will love this movie i got 10 or more movies of the rock but i love this one the most so take my word on it you will like this on
105;This is a good Dwayne Johnson movie.
106;It is a man who stands up for his town.
107;I hope The Rock gets some good sci.
108;He is fun to watch regardless and if you want a late night no.
109;brainer then this will work.
110;This is a great movie it has alot of action suspense and alot of humor,it's a must see I enjoyed it very much
111;Yes walking tall did meet my expectations and it's a really good movie and my sons watched it over and over again
112;Entertaining as action movies go.
113;He is a severly underrated actor, and I hope he gets the attention he deserves soon.
114;If you don't really expect anything from this movie, it's totally fine.
115;Saw it in the theater, don't know why, but was totally fine with it.
116;I really liked the previous review of this movie.
117;Still, considering that the original was based on a true story and this one is fiction, there are discrepencies as the previous reviewer pointed out.
118;"Rather, it is an ""adaption"" of the original to modern times."
119;Let the obvious problem with reality and connections to the original pass you by and enjoy this movie.
120;If you are a fan of The Rock, you will like this.
121;His character is very likable.
122;That comparison, for me, is spot on.
123;definitely a 4 star movie for me.
124;Walking Tall is a better film than I had hoped it would be.
125;Which is a good thing, it doesn't drag but keeps up the action.
126;The Rock and Knoxville both show that they are both incredible actors when they want to be and I have to say that I was impressed with both of them as well.
127;The basic theme of the movie is stand up for what is right, to walk tall, and in The Rock's attempt to do so, the movie serves its entertainment purpose.
128;I like the Rock and I have agianst him beating people up with a 4x4.
129;Nevertheless, fans of The Rock do not watch his films for his superior acting ability and will probably love every moment of it.
130;comparing this to other films starring The Rock, this is one of his better films.
131;The original movie, itself, also spawned two sequels and a TV series.
132;This was a really good movie for the money.
133;Walking Tall a movie base on a true story, Excellent !!!!
134;would recommend this movie to anyone.
135;Dwayne Johnson is a stunning man.
136;The Rock stars as Chris Vaughn,who just returns home from the army after being gone 8 years.
137;The main attraction of the town is the casino,whose security guards are selling drugs to kids.
138;there's lots of great action and a little bit of humor thrown in.
139;"iF you love the Rock or just want to watch a great action film go watch ""Walking Tall""."
140;The Rock certainly has a future in film.
141;He has a style and certainly has a future in motion pictures outside of the slam bam action thrillers.
142;I really loved this movie and have watched it several times on the disc and on cable.
143;I like fact action movies.
144;Revenge and Cleanup are the themes here, a lot of good guy/bad guy encounters, and more destruction of property and sets than you can imagine.
145;and his rehabbed sidekick Johnny Knoxville who actually make the film watchable.
146;A good film if you're working out personal frustrations and need to identify with a superhero.
147;This was a great movie, even with some of the usual hollywood BS fight scenes.
148;I actually like the Rock and I have liked all of his movies except Scorpion King.
149;He'll do just fine in action movies and I hope to see more.
150;The movie has its funny moments complete with sidekick and it also has a very good villian.
151;What really makes it stand out is the fact that the rest of the fight scenes are pretty realistic.
152;A great movie, all in all.
153;In this remake of the great action classic WALKING TALL The Rock carves his niche into the role made famous by Joe Don Baker and creates an enjoyable good time at the movies with his own sense of style and charisma.
154;The Rock can definalty hold his own in the action sequences and his sense of humor is really hard to match.
155;I truly beleive The Rock will be a force to reckon with In Hollywood's action genre for years to come.
156;The Rock comes back to his hometown after serving in the military and sees it turned around.
157;Drugs are running the streets, and his nephew is on them as well, as is most of the town.
158;He makes his best friend, Johnny Knoxville, the deputy and they start to take down the bad guys.
159;the movie is based on a true story, and it has a lot of action and jokes as well, but in only an hour and 25 minutes long.
160;A good movie to watch however and I'd recommend it.
161;Not to mention the Rock does give a good performance.
162;Would recomend it to a friend, or anyone who likes a good movie.
163;special Forces Chris Vaughn (Da Rock) returns to his hometown of Kitsap County, Washington after 8 years in the soldiering business.
164;He intends to fulfill his dream of working at the town sawmill, but finds that it has gone out of business.
165;to wit, getting elected Sheriff.
166;But this movie version has the Rock, filmdom's newest big action star, and is therefore invested with Rock.
167;oriented, with the action scenes more slick and kinetic.
168;gritty, quickly delivering what the fans crave .
169;the Rock's physicality and charisma.Yes, the Rock is an action star.
170;But, in his specific genre, he shines.
171;be stars such as Van Damme and Seagal is that the Rock is imbued with a self.
172;A very good and formidable villain indeed.
173;It is what it is: a short, enjoyable movie that's sure to give the audience a good time.
174;It certainly beats Son of theMask, or a fork in the eye.
175;This yarn is a funny movie that works out as a deserved homage to Buford Pusser.
176;the Rock with his well known charisma makes the best he can and he achieves it in this entertained film.
177;"As far I could tell, ""Walking Tall"" propels two polar opposite responses."
178;down, explosive tumult splashed onto a silver screen.
179;That is, if it is done properly.
180;The Rundown, The Rock's most recent film prior to this one, serves as a prime example of this.
181;I was thoroughly entertained, applauding myself for $6 well spent.
182;"(Rest assured, a second viewing of ""Kill Bill: Vol."
183;"2"" acted as my salvation."
184;Good golly, Mr. Tarantino is a marvel.)
185;He finds out the mill has been shut down, a casino has sprung up and neighborhood kids are suddenly all crack addicts.
186;It has its ups and downs but worth watching at least once.
187;The soldier fights against the owner and his thugs with just one friend and succeeds.
188;the film raises an interesting question to viewers who pay close attention to what the soldier does.
189;I'd refer it to others.
190;Suspenseful, good acting, good all over.
191;When Johnny Knoxville is, by far, the best thing about your movie, you're in trouble.
192;My boyfriend LOVES this movie and could watch it weekly!
193;It is action packed and the story line is very motivational.
194;The fact that it is based on a true story is pretty nice as well!
195;When the Rock is in a movie about cleaning house, beating the tar out of people, and all out manly shenanigans, there is pretty much a guaranteed good movie on the horizon.
196;It turns out that there is a town.
197;Along the way he hooks up with a former classmate (Ashley Scott), who is basically in the movie because she's gorgeous, looks great in a red bra, and fulfills the minimum of one hot.
198;i have no problems with the Rock, he has been a blast in everything he's done so far, and you can see he is improving every role.
199;Johnny Knoxville is fine as his best friend, they are an amusing team that blended well together.
200;But that's it, she looks sexy, but not the world's strongest actress.
201;the Rock comes back from his military duties to find his town has become a dump and his nephew hooked on drugs.
202;i do own the original, and while it is a far superior movie, it does not have the charm that this version contains, this is mostly because of The Rock, he is so much fun to watch, and I do agree with most reviewers who say he could be the next big action star.
203;This could have easily been a 4 star movie, but it's a solid 3.3.5.
204;enjoyacting.3 stars, Rock and Knoxville are great, Scott's notdirecting.2 stars, Dropped the ball with the love story and the movie's lengthspecial effects.3 stars, Not to much here, explosions and gunplay galore.
205;The movie is based on actual events and I have to say was pretty good.
206;Besides that the movie is full of action and has that comedy appeal as well.
207;he is a very good actor and very great wrestler,I like Dwayne Johnson.
208;great movie it was worth it
209;The original is way better.
210;I give it 3 stars for the action.
211;I really like the Rock in this role, something he's just natural at.
212;A good action movie with plenty of villians the boo at and heroes to cheer for.
213;I honestly think the movie shouldn't have been advertised with that.
214;It takes the fun out of them and plus this is about as realistic as a Steven Seagal movie.
215;the Rock shines in a more serious role for him although he still kicks ass and has fun in the role.
216;His character is a new sheriff who walks around with a big club to try and take control of the town he once grew up in.
217;Helping him bring order to the town and bring down criminals is his friend who.
218;He's well played by Jonhy Knoxville surprisingly and Knoxville makes for a fun partner for the Rock.
219;Plus the Rock still has a more promising acting career than fellow wrestler Hulk Hogan.
220;This flick has a big good guy who is right at home knocking the bad guys around.
221;Though the story line is familiar, Dwayne Johnson ( The Rock ) gives it new life.
222;He brings to the screen a fresh mixture of brawn, humor and talent that I find enjoyable to watch.
223;I've seen him in several movies now and I've liked them all.
224;If you look forward to seeing the good guys win for a change, you'll most likely be satisfied with this version of Walking Tall.
225;Along the way, he pays a hefty price.
226;He kicks butt and has his own kicked a few times as well.
227;its nice to see the good guys win.
228;Take the time to enjoy this moive.
229;They end up stopping him and restoring the town back to decentcyI liked this film mainly because of Dwayne Johnson's performance, He is well suited for action films, he has the build, the stanima, to do all the stunts.
230;As usual, Johnny Knoxville keeps us laughing as the deputy.
231;OMG I love the Rock and this movie is awesome.
232;I won't tell you all about the movie, but if you like action(but not overloaded on it) a decent plot line and the Rock, I'd definitely recommend this movie.
233;The Rock fans will enjoy this action filled movie with a great script, excellent acting, and just a fun time to enjoy your day with a great movie.
234;Its one of those movies that you can watch over and over again.
235;This 1 of The Rocks's best movie imo.
236;He tells him he's lucky he's still alive cause he tore up The Casino.
237;"He messes Hamilton's cronies and the place up good then he throws the bat at this window and smashes it he has a brief face to face with Hamiltion who says ""I guess this changes are relationship."""
238;He shows his scars from the beating he took.
239;He is found not guilty he beat The Sheriff in the election fires the entire department.
240;This scene was fun and The Rock and Johnny Knoxville have a decent back and forth.
241;Kevin Bray did a good job.
242;Ashley Scott did a pretty good job.
243;and im so glad i did, the film is excellent a (no.
244;This was a great remake of a classic show.
245;I love this kind of movie that The Rock is in
246;It also disappoints him that the town has turned into a corrupt haven for criminals and thugs where ordinary people have to fear for their lives and see their children being lead into drugs and lives of crime.
247;The Rock and MGM Studios put on a very entertaining movie full of action and emotion.
248;chris Vaughn, played by The Rock, returns home from the Special Forces.
249;chris goes out with his friends to the casino to have a good time.
250;He quickly recruits one of his best friend's, Ray, to be his only officer.
251;Ray is played by Johnny Knoxville and he does a great job of bringing a comical sense to this movie.
252;It creates a good balance.
253;chris's weapon of choice is a large piece of Cedar.
254;That's right, he uses a huge piece of wood to put the hurt on people.
255;This leads to some great action scenes.
256;They use guns later on in the movie, but the scenes with the cedar are much better.
257;There are two extra commentaries worth listening to.
258;One is by The Rock and the other is by the Director and Crew.
259;Both of them are worth listening to.
260;Well, I thought it was good, to a point.
261;My favorite man, Kevin Durand was in it, and up until he died the movie rocked.
262;Lots of the Rock fighting and grunting.
263;I'm not a big Rock fan, but Johnny Knoxville was pretty funny.
264;The Rock continues to prove that he is worthy of movie stardom by not taking himself so seriously and putting a degree of fun into the role.
265;casted addition to the cast as The Rock's right hand man.
266;Although there isn't anything new to offer, sometimes it's fun to take the same ride with all new friends!
267;how can anyone suggest this is good and worthy filmmaking when the hero is more of an antihero than Dirty Harry ever was?
268;There is a trial because since the police will not do anything about what happened to him our hero decides to take matters into his own hands.
269;the Rock is certainly an engaging action star with a likeability that I usually do not find in this genre.
270;"He has a nice sense of humor that works in several scenes throughout ""Walking Tall,"" although, again, the idea that you can have a comic scene of Vaughn recooperating from having his chest cut to ribbons strikes me at least extremely odd if not outright wrong."
271;One thing about films with the Rock, they usually have a co. star who turns in a surprisingly good performance as well.
272;By the end of the movie, I was very impressed.
273;His acting in this movie made the movie that much more enjoyable.
274;His performance in the movie matches up with Dwayne's, which makes a great fight scene near the end of the movie.
275;the climax of the whole movie was during the huge fight scene, which I mentioned above that happened between Neal's character and Dwayne's character.
276;Johnny comes across as witty, yet plays off his character very well.
277;Even though they have been apart for eight years, you can tell the first time they see each other they still have those feelings.
278;I really liked how his dad didn't want to use guns.
279;The Rock is learning to act.
280;I was impressed with him in Welcome To The Jungle, and although the action is not as thick and fast here, The Rock adds more drama to his character.
281;The story is based on a real.
282;This new film is solid through and through, but although the run time is an hour and twenty.
283;the Rock is a good actor, he is gorgeous, and the movie is inspiring.
284;He's an honest actor, humble and willing to always do his best.
285;I also liked this movie because it does not use high tech gimmicks and stuff generated by computer specialists.
286;otherwise, is a fine action movie, even whent it stands a bit in the shadow of the 1973 version, but still with high honors.
287;Not only is Dwayne Johnson hot in it, but when I received it in the mail it was in great condition which made me very happy.
288;This movie was awesome,I really liked the characters.
289;also the action was great,It's really cool to see a character with a lot of heart stand up to curruption in a big way.
290;Dwayne Johnson was very good in his part.
291;This is a great movie of someone taking control and getting rid of evil instead of joining it.
292;The Rock is so perfect for this film.
293;The muscles, the tattoos, perfect for this film.
294;The plot was pretty good, as it was a remake from an earlier movie by the same name, and Knoxville was likeable in his role.
295;love it a lot it is great it is funny it i nice it is wonderful i like it ilove it
296;The legal basis for everything that happened is the movie was a hilariously childish view of justice.
297;believable human emotion, or a plot, or a vague connection with reality .
298;I've never seen the original, but I sure do like the new one.
299;He's a former special service soldier in the army who is returning home to settle down.
300;After becoming sheriff he apoints his friend Ray(Knoxville) to help him restore justice to the town.
301;I liked Johnny Knoxville in the movie.
302;When this guy isn't killing himself on Jackass he seems to be a real cool guy.
303;He does a great job playing the side kick of the rock.
304;He has a future in acting if he wants it.
305;His fans will like him a lot in this.
306;He's funny and so are his fight scenes.
307;It was a fun story.
308;i liked Ashley Scott who plays Deni in the movie who is love interest.
309;It's great to see Ashley on screen again.
310;She is hot in the movie.
311;i liked this movie a lot.
312;Lots of great action that isn't likely possible to ever happen.
313;There's also a piece of cedar you like to see get used.
314;It's a fun film and if you can look past the whole town thing it really is a fun movie.
315;I'd give this movie 3.5 stars if I could.
316;It's a good B. movie to watch when you have nothing better to do.
317;The Rock is great, and its fun watching him kick butt!
318;but it likely kept the attention of the guys.
319;Johnny Knoxville played a great comedic side kick, his timing is perfect.
320;not great, but has its fun moments.
321;i was happy to see that the new version stuck pretty close to the original movie.
322;the Rock and his friends go to the casino and our hero catches cheating in the pits.
323;he gets a cedar4x4 and beats up on the security personnel.
324;he is arrested and placed on trial.
325;after showing his wounds from his previous fight with the casino people he is found not guilty.
326;a very good movie that I enjoyed.
327;in fact both movies were good.
328;Check it out I really recommend it.
329;Vaughn wins the case by appealing to squeamishness of the jury, who wince once he shows them the scars from the box cutter.
330;What happens next is a good old.
331;whupping from a big man with a big stick.
332;There are lots of thuds, grunts, and crunches.
333;He's handsome and sleek in a way that other muscle.
334;good tale about a tough guy who stands up for his hometown in an era when nobody seems to be standing up for anything anymore.
335;His victory over the old sheriff all but ensures another showdown with Hamilton.
336;Inspired by a true story, Walking Tall is a remake of a movie of the same name that fictionalizes the true story more than the original did.
337;This is a movie that really did not need to be made, but The Rock once again steps up and salvages some enjoyment out of it.
338;He has the charisma and presence to be the next big action star.
339;this movie is a perfect example of pro.
340;appointed leader must rise above the law to do what is right.
341;"i like the idea of the rock's character, and i think more movies should made about decent people like this character
342;simplifies the good guy/bad guy thing even more than most action movies.
343;i have met the rock, and he seems like a real sharp guy (and very nice as well).
344;This movie is great, and full of action.
345;flicks, I figured this was the best choice.
346;Great movie choice for ladies wanting to please their boyfriend with a non.
347;It came in plenty of time, just like they said it would and she was very excited to open it up yesterday.
348;thank you for your professionalism.
349;This movie is decent but it has some issues that hinder it a bit.
350;This movie kicks ass and is definitely worth checking out.
351;Have some originality and make some good family movies.
352;I really enjoyed the non.
353;A good Saturday night movie to watch at home and chill out.
354;I think The Rock is so nice.
355;Nice modern version of the earlier picture.
356;Funny humor (thanks to A Dirty Shame's Johnny Knoxville), """"Rock"""" solid action and great storyline makes Walking Tall a great movie!"""
357;The Rock is charismatic and could be an amazing action star if someone would give him a decent script.
358;I think it's the best movie The Rock has done so far!
359;No Oscars here, but beautiful Pacific Northwest scenery and great action scenes.
360;This is a fun watch and a diversion from the daily grind.
361;Much better, The Rock has finally made a more adult film.
362;this a good update of the orginal, the action is good both he and Johnny Knoxville are very watchable.
363;The basic premise : Take a very large, strong man (who is known for inflicting pain on other large, strong men with his bare hands in a wrestling ring), send him back to his beautiful hometown to see his family.
364;Yip, short and sweet and to the point.
365;Great movie, great action and a truly interesting performance from Knoxville .
366;his casino is what keeps this town going.
367;With only a long 2X4 The Rock gives his best effort so far to keep the audience wanting more!
368;Are you looking to see a brand new, emotion filled action packed masterpiece?
369;"Well, you won't get emotion filled, but with this movie you certaintly will get ""brand new"" and ""action packed""."
370;also, the movie has humor.
371;And I was questioning how good of an actor he is before seeing this movie.
372;To my suprise, he is quite good!
373;I love this movie, but I did not order this.
374;Overall the film is still entertaining but there are better movies out there.
375;when i first went to see Walking Tall, i loved it.
376;the credits felt longer than the movie, but for this, the shortness of the movie is a good thing.
377;the characters are all awsome, the acting is realisitic and the story is very real.
378;Very Great movie based on the remake!
379;The Rock did a great job and the price was excellent and well worth it!!
380;This is a great remake that pays tribute to Sheriff Buford Pusser.
381;It seems like this version has more action, suspense, and comedy.
382;A childhood friend, Jay Hamilton owns a corrupted casino.
383;When he discovers that his nephew, Pete got Crystal Meth from the security at the casino, Chris gets revenge by taking a huge piece of cedar and beating up the guards and trashes the casino.
384;He wants to run for sheriff so he can take a stand and fight back against all the corrupted people in the town, with the help of his best friend, Ray.
385;This movie was real good because it has one of the best actors, duane johnson aka THE ROCK.
386;Anyway I recomend this movie to anyone who likes movies and action in movies and funny guy Johnny Knoxvilll!
387;If films this bad are being made, maybe the end of good movies is nearer than we thought.
388;There is no doubt in my mind at all that he put all his efforts in making it a successful hit according to all his fans.
389;This is movie is great.
390;all found favor with mass audiences, although critics tended to dismiss them as, at best, reactionary, and, at worst, neo.
391;which eliminates most of the grittier elements of the story and turns it into a rock'em.
392;When Chris has finally had a bellyful of malfeasance and sleaze, he decides to run for sheriff, vowing to bring the criminals to their knees, and thus allowing the good folks of the town to reclaim their community.
393;usually, in a film based on true life events, when the names are changed, it's to protect the innocent.
394;"There is a particularly disturbing scene in Barry Blaustein's brilliant wrestling documentary ""Beyond the Mat"", which haunted me ever since I saw the film."
395;"Rowdy Roddy Piper scored the starring role in John Carpenter's ""They Live"", a solid cult classic by any standard, why couldn't this formula work?Enter The Rock!"
396;The most electrifying man in sports entertainment!
397;If any wrestler had the look and charisma to carry a feature film, it is the great one.
398;"The brilliant script for that film manages some near impossible tasks, it makes Seann ""Stiffler"" William Scott painfully unfunny, Christopher Walken pathetic (Tooth Fairy speech!?)"
399;"Of course this won't stop J. r.'s endless plugging, how many wrestlers have being ""walking tall"" on their way to the squared circle lately?I want The Rock to succeed, sincerely want his films to be good, he's one of my favorite wrestlers along with Mysterio and Flair."
400;The Rock on the mike is brilliant, in fact better than brilliant, he's electrifying!
401;The Rock on talk shows is charming, funny and totally entertaining.
402;I saw this movie in April And I loved it!!
403;It has great action in it,and the THE ROCK is one bad mudder!!!!
404;If there is one one word that I would have to describe this movie is spectacular.
405;from the beginning I was at the edge of my seat,and I remained thier throughout the whole movie.
406;dwayne Johnson (The Rock) is my all time favorite actor, I thought he was good on the mat but he is even better on the screen.
407;Well I have to go now and see this movie a couple more times c.ya.
408;Good family movie for the Rock fan.
409;Delivered quickly and in great condition.
410;Action packed all the way through.
411;"if you love Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, you will love this movie!"
412;based (i'm sure loosely) on a true story and its a remake , fits the time period very well and if you like BLOWING UP stuff , this is good .
413;got a good grade for the report
414;it's based on a true story and my husband and I really enjoyed The ROCK and how he portrayed the character.
415;He can come to my place an clean up any crime he would like.
416;I love the Scorpion King, Rundown and Walking Tall is one of his best.
417;This was a great early Rock movie.
418;Definitely kick started his career and stands the test of time as a great re.
419;Honestly prefer it to some of his later work.
420;This is the type of movie where the Rock shines.
421;great movie, Dwayne Johnson is a great actor and is great in all his movies.
422;ray movie on a classic story.
423;The Rock is a great actor and this was a childhood favorite of mine.
424;I always look for movies we would watch over and over and not get tired of, this movie belongs in that collection!
425;"Walking Tall is an easy enough timepasser and overall decent film that, hopefully, will encourage fans of ""The Great One"" to be curious enough to check out the original ""Walking Tall""."
426;the Rock stars as Chris Vaughn, a retired member of the Special Forces, returning home to be with his family and settle down.
427;The plus side is the characters are likable enough to enjoy.
428;Knoxville gives his best performance to date as Vaughn's, Deputy giving the film some great, funny moments (especially the truck chopping sequence.
429;The Rock is cool as Chris.
430;"He comes off likable as ""The Average Joe"" trying to make his way in life."
431;"The beginning to ""Walking Tall"" is an homage to ""First Blood"" (the first ""Rambo"" film), from the Northern Mid."
432;west Town the film takes place in, to Chris Vaughn walking the road into town.
433;Walking Tall is a decent film to watch and is an easy enough timepasser.
434;Being from a small Tennessee town that is riddled with corruption and crooked politics, I can understand the true meaning of the storyline.
435;Maybe then you will understand just how great a man he was.
436;This movie is a must.
437;This movie is full of action and Dwayne The Rock Johnson proves that hometown heroes still exist.
438;Catch this movie if you can.
439;The acting,the storyline everything the Rock did, was awesome in this movie.
440;The story is mildly gripping, and the action is fresh and entertaining.
441;With 'Rundown,' The Rock proved he would be the action star of the next generation, and though 'Walking Tall' is not as good as the predecessor, it is still an enjoyable action film with bone.
442;but the charisma of The Rock is presented intact, even when he is in an obligatory love scene with Ashley Scott.
443;The film's script is made with pieces from the old traditional Western films, and like these Western someone must right the wrongs.
444;And it's The Rock, who does it with a piece of cider, and later an oak bat.
445;But The Rock, even when he is not doing actions, is always watchable, brief conversations with Chris' troublemaking nephew, or comical dialogues with Knoxville.
446;make wisely avoids the Charles Bronson.
447;the Rock (Chris Vaughan) manages to pull off a decent role in this film as a man returning to his home town only to find it corrupted by drug dealers and a bought off police force.
448;In typical macho bravado this movie contains more fight scenes than dialogue but at least the fight scenes are worth the wait.
449;The story is pretty basic but interesting enough to sustain a film that only lasts 75 minutes.
450;overall if you like action movies this is a decent bit of entertainment.
451;"It will definitely inspire a bit of ""whoop."
452;I saw this movie at a preview in Knoxville, TN and I will definitely say that this is the Rock's best work to date.
453;The movie not based in the orginal setting of the story really captures the essence of what Buford Pusser stood for.
454;The Rock is well on his way to becoming the next big action star of this generation.
455;His movies have a feel much like Lethal Weapon with the seriousness of the role captured along with having funny and lite hearted moments.
456;I would tell anyone that has the chance to see this movie, that is well worth the price that you pay.
457;I would rate this movie as Excellent!
458;Dwayne Johnson is gorgeous and the role he played in this movie fit him like a pair of comfortable slippers because he just slipped right into it.
459;Great movie that I will be watching over and over again.
460;This movie provided entertainment, excitement, and a desire to watch the complete movie uninterrupted with a degree of anticipation from start to final.
461;"It is such a ""feel good"" movie all the bad guys got it one way or another."
462;"For a remake
463;His friends take him to the casino to celebrate his return, and he catches a """"dirty dealer"""", and calls him on it."""
464;Good action, decent story, some humor at times.
465;A decent 90 minutes, check it out.
