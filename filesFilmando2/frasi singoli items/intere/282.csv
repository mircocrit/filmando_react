1;As a film lover who has despaired of seeing Jack Nicholson ever giving a fine performance again, I can happily report that his handling of the role of Jerry Black in this film is exceptionally fine.
2;the writers and director (Sean Penn) have crafted an excellent film which is part thriller, part psychological drama.
3;sean Penn has done a superb job in involving the audience in this ultimately poignant and tragic film, and has been rewarded with wonderful performances from Nicholson, Robin Wright Penn, and several other famous actors in small but critical roles (hardly cameos, as their involvement is crucial to the plot).
4;The use of the camera is very imaginative throughout, and the editing is crisply compelling.
5;the sound is also excellent.
6;outs in this film, so the soundtrack merely has to support the excellent dialogue and eclectic music score, and succeeds on every level.
7;The suspense is built up well of a serial kidnapper who preys on little girls in small towns.
8;If you want to watch a film that's fairly decent all the way until the end, this is a good choice.
9;This movie definitely will polarize viewers.
10;People that like happy endings where all the plots are easily sewn up will detest 'The Pledge'.
11;Those who are more comfortable with a 'real.
12;I like the movie genre, and Jack of course, so this seemed like it could be a hit.
13;this is a beautiful movie, about life in all it's glory.
14;Yes, it's a bit long, does not contain Bruce Willis flying out a window screaming his loungs out, but what it does contain is a great story, great characters and a chance for the viewer to think, and to face life's more darker side.
15;Jack Nicholson's portrait of the inspector is haunting.
16;"He was ""brilliant"" by his own colleagues' estimation."
17;honed detective skills, building a growing body of circumstantial evidence and triangulating Evil's suspected whereabouts, placing himself right in the middle to ensure Evil's capture.
18;jerry is a wise and cynical man, at the end of his career, having witnessed man's various depravities, scams, and failures.
19;Over those years he also developed a deep compassion, distinguished apart from his insensitive colleagues and the reflexive flock.
20;The mountainous landscape as a backdrop to the film serves to punctuate man's impotence in the face of Evil's basic structure within the timeless order of nature.
21;the plot is timeless and builds purposefully, the acting is superb, and the directing clean and modest with a few creative flourishes, alongside a poignant soundtrack and cinematography.
22;Nicholson's carefully controlled performance is, as usual, first.
23;The inner conflict between seeking justice and placing a family at risk is played very well by Nicholson and director Penn.
24;benicio Del Toro is gripping while on.
25;It works, in its own way2 .
26;Penn sets up the film well, but everything leading up to the ending leads the audience to believe that their expectations are going to be met.
27;For that aspect alone, 'The Pledge' is worth viewing.
28;BUT I'S TO LATE !
29;There is much to recommend in this complex and deeply layered psychological thriller featuring Jack Nicholson in what seems to have evolved into a continuing exploration into the dark side of human nature in his roles over the last decade.
30;This is a gorgeously photographed and quite penetrating drama which on one level involves Nicholson as a dogged, troubled, and obsessed retired detective convinced the actual killer of his last gruesome juvenile homocide case is still at large, while on another level it is a stunning and all.
31;minded concentration can do to a fragile and vulnerable personality.
32;While it is not a movie I would recommend to the faint of heart, it is an absorbing exploration into this character's heart of darkness and the perils associated with such risky adventures.
33;the movie is set supposedly in Reno and the surrounding Sierras, and the natural scenery that provides the stage for this drama is simply breath taking, and is worth the viewing experience for this experience alone.
34;Thus Robin Wright Penn, Mickey Rourke, Sam Shepard, Vanessa Redgrave, Harry Dean Stanton and a number of notable others blithely (and sometimes painfully) slip past the rather remarkable qualities in Nicholson's character as well as in Wright Penn's memorable turn as a woman with battered background and a beautiful little girl who lights up the screen and who also just happens to exactly fit Nicholson's bogeyman serial killer's profile.
35;thus, his motives for the subsequent involvement are confused at best, yet he seems to genuinely care for the new family he adopts along the way.
36;I recommend this, but also caution against letting one's impressionable children watch this.
37;I love Jack Nicholson and saw this film as an undiscovered gem.
38;This created a good measure of suspense for me, but as I mentioned, the excessive time trailing after each punch .
39;It's an honest and real movie worth watching.
40;The reasons for my posting a review of this movie is twofold: Firstly, it's one of the finest movies I've seen in quite a while.
41;The best movies have the power to hold you in its grip and don't need to cater to the tidy.
42;This movie is a standout.
43;performance by Jack Nicholson and near perfect direction by Sean Penn.
44;A must see for real movie fans.
45;The acting is good and the story is awesome as Nicholson plays a cop retiring in 6 hours when a murder occurs and the mother of the slain child freaks him and puts a scarring memory into his head of how he must solve the murder of her dead daughter.
46;There is a great cast in this film but the film in itself could of had a more fatness to the storyline and add a few .
47;Jack Nicholson gives a solid performance in this crime mystery produced and directed by Sean Pean who also directed Nicholson in the film THE CROSSING GUARD.
48;He relocates to an area where other murders of young girls have occurred and starts a new life.
49;The ultimate question of the movie is, in the end which will be stronger, Jerry's feelings for Laurie and her daughter or the deep seeded promise he made to the murdered girl's mother.
50;The first keeps him grounded and secure and the second slowly drains him of his soul and his sanity.
51;This psychological crime drama has one of the best group of supporting actors in film today.
52;I have never seen such a great ensemble of actors put together in smaller budget film and their acting really bolsters the credibility of the story.
53;The cinematography is also gorgeous especially the scenes of winter in the western U. s.
54;All in all great directing by Penn and wonderful acting by a topnotch cast in a good but not great psychological thriller.
55;By movie's end he's definitely on the far side of sanity, though convinced he was right all along.
56;Handsomely photographed, the winter scenes are especially striking.
57;Jack Nicholson turns in a superb performance as a cop who suddenly retires but then comes back to solve one last puzzling case.
58;Sean Penn does a superb job of directing and setting the mood for the movie.
59;It is an ultimate mystery thriller that keeps you involved till the end.
60;The movie, which stars Jack Nicholson (and features appearences by Benicio del Toro and Robin Wright Penn), is, quite simply, the most amazing work of genius I've ever seen.
61;garde shades of depression and a growing insanity hold the viewer tight for the entire film.
62;Several parts in the film (including the aptly titled Gone Fishin' scene) have imagery that is so beatiful and free it brings a tear to one's eye.
63;To go along with this amazing work of art comes another: the sountrack.
64;music god (composing the films greatest song, Nwahulwana.)
65;The verdict: Truly the absolute greatest movie ever made by man, showing the contrast of happiness that grows to the insecurities of onesself, dealing with his promise to Mrs. Larsen that he will find her missing daughter.
66;Nicholson plays a retiring police detective and really does a great job.
67;It has just one heck of a supporting cast and directed by Sean Penn.
68;My wife liked it and I liked it better the second time I watched it.
69;This movie is very good, as other reviewers have said, it has an exceptional direction and some very good acting by almost every character on the film.
70;As I could read, many people weren't happy with the ending (which I won't tell here, that's not the idea) but I encourage thriller fans to watch it and then stablish their own criteria about it.
71;the movie itself, just excellent!
72;The writing is complex and finely nuanced, taking no predictible Hollywood plot or character turns.
73;The film is also highly artistic.
74;Actors must love to work for Penn because he obtained the very best for even single scene roles.
75;He has an incredible amount of patience in setting his lure, much like his favorite avocation, fishing, requires of its followers.
76;He even outdoes his Traffic performance.
77;I read that this film was a sensation when it screened at the Cannes Film Festival and I can certainly see why that experienced audience was so impressed.
78;Nicholson's closing moments of acting in the film are amongst the finest in his long acting career.
79;The Pledge is a clever and disturbing pyschological thriller which sticks with you long after the final ending.
80;Instead of a conventional whodunnitthat is concerned with solving the mystery, its a character study interested in examining the impact of the hunt on Nicholson's character.
81;for the thinking viewer, this is a small price to pay.
82;It would be fascinating to watch and discuss it with a group of people.
83;for a guy who's known as one of the best actors in the business, most of Jack Nicholson's roles in the last 10 years or so have consisted of Jack doing his impersonation of somebody else's Jack Nicholson impression.
84;This is also a credit to director Sean Penn who has created a really affecting film, even if its not one for everybody.
85;The Pledge is an interesting story about Unsolved murders.
86;Jack Nicholson is great, as usual.
87;An honest police detective Jerry Black (Three Time Oscar.
88;winner:Jack Nicholson) has promise to a woman (Patricia Clarkson), her daughter is raped and killed to fine murderer to Justice.
89;On the same day, he has retired from the force.
90;winner:Benicio Del Toro) may have killed the little girl but Jerry knows he`s not the murderer.
91;This is one of Nicholson`s best films.
92;One of the best and most underrated crime thrillers.
93;The skin tones are remarkably even and realistic, the clarity and detail are astounding and the black levels are deep.
94;highly recommended for both its artistic and technical merits.
95;The plot is simple and leads up to a classic confrontation .
96;"baked ""background"" scenes, and you have a high."
97;I'm sure the actors in the movie have some talent.
98;As it stands, the fairly interesting story was butchered and nobody will even remember it in two years.
99;Most movies that I think are good stay with me for a few days afterward.
100;Many really good ones stay with me for far longer than that (I am still brooding about 21 Grams.)
101;centered violence or violation, but the lure of Penn and Nicholson got the better of me.
102;This movie is very good.
103;Myself, I'd rather feel good at the end of the film, but I really liked this movie in a strange kind of way.
104;On the second viewing, knowing what to expect, it didn't haunt me but it was worth that second look.
105;shocking twist at the end all make this an intriguing movie.
106;wise, but this is truly a great movie.
107;When first popping this little number into my VCR I had very high hopes for a film with such talent as Jack Nicholson, and Vanessa Redgrave.
108;And if he accomplished his goal, well, congratulations to him.
109;Bravo to Sean Penn and Jack Nickolson for making a bold, and powerful movie.
110;The story keeps you riveted, and terrified.
111;The ending is unlike any that audiences could have anticipated.
112;The sorrow lets you feel alive, and think about what tragedy could be.
113;There are occasionally interesting sequences (such as the interrogation of the Indian like the sexual abuse he's been accused of).
114;handed, and the performances from an amazing cast are uniformly atrocious, with the exceptions of Aaron Eckhart and Stanton.
115;And Jack, the one reason 'Pledge' remains at all watchable, keeping all the mysteries of motivation and feeling to himself, and all the more intriguing for that.
116;This leads me to believe that the nature of movie making is make the film much longer than you think it needs to be, then trim the extra bits, leaving only the most important aspects.
117;It draws you into the mystery like a Hitchcock film, as it mesmerizes and enchants like Atom Egyoyan's The Sweet Hereafter .
118;Nicholson is far too often typecast as an abrasive maverick and in this film he is able to show off another side of his acting skills.
119;This movie is a delight all the way through: Good acting, good, slow.
120;the end is incredible, both from an acting point of view, and from the view that it fits so perfectly with the rest of the movie, but is so unexpected from a Hollywood film.
121;If that describes your kind of film, see this, 5 stars.
122;Murder on the Orient Express is best remembered for its great cast, although each star had only a few lines.
123;This is a treat, admittedly, but it throws things off.
124;"The cast is pure stock and trade stuff
125;Here Nicholson is working hard for the Santa Claus prize, but what makes all this worthy of all the craft?
126;All the talent is in service of what?
127;The 1994 original movie The Cold Light of Day is significantly better than Sean Penn's interpretation.
128;penn's real life wife Robin Wright Penn is very convincing as the mother who accepts the generosity of the much older retired officer.
129;Only the true fans of Jack Nicholson will find it worth viewing.
130;The previously mentioned The Cold Light of Day, though, is highly recommended (four stars) as a something of a hidden gem.
131;The audience actually gets to understanding the sick motivations of the child killer.
132;Van Berg's direction is not pretentious, and he accomplishes a lot with almost certainly a smaller budget.
133;A study into the depths of madness.
134;Jack Nicholson delivers the performance of a lifetime as an obsessed cop who will do anything to catch the killer.
135;But it is extremely thought provoking and the ending leaves you stunned and mesmorized.
136;Once again Sean Penn and Jack Nicholson team up to stuff their finger firmly into the eye of Hollywood, and with tremendous results.
137;His subseqent investigation yields a string of similar murders, convincing Nicholson that he is dealing with a serial killer that has gone undetected until now.
138;Nicholson's faith in the much younger Penn's direction is remarkable to behold.
139;But Penn does a marvelous job and constructs a wonderfully developed film that utilizes Nicholson's patented sneers and onscreen orneryness to perfection.
140;This movie's greatest attribute is that it keeps you guessing.
141;before I go into my personal feelings of the movie, I will have to agree that Nicholson's performance of the retiring police officer was good.
142;Many people wonder if the man can continue to do a stellar performance and it's evident that no matter how old Nicholson is, he will always be a talented actor.
143;Some people found Arlington Road brilliant.
144;The ending of this movie, of which we see glimpses in the beginning, is an example of the sort of cosmic irony that some world.
145;renown writers apply to human affairs.
146;disturbed Native American, played convincingly by Benicio Del Toro, is genuine.
147;Nicholson, as usual, totally becomes the character he is playing and gives an outstanding performance.
148;the direction by Sean Penn is uncluttered, focused and visually astute.
149;For example, note the way the little girl playing in the swings between the highway and the gas station affects our expectation of what is to come.
150;Penn also captures well the high country atmosphere around Reno, Nevada and attendant lifestyles, and for the most part keeps his auteur ambitions secondary to the telling of the story.
151;kromolowski is artistically true with crisp, direct dialogue and a fine dramatic structure.
152;The film is also nicely cut so that everything is clear without any belaboring of the obvious.
153;, who is just perfect in her experienced skepticism) are very well done.
154;received by the mass audience.
155;For those who are wondering who really did kill the little girls, I will give you a hint: he got his just deserts in a symbolically appropriate manner.
156;bottom line: a fine artistic achievement, an excellent diversion, and a treat for those who are fed up with films that play out in a tiresome, predictable manner.
157;He takes in a battered wife and her child.
158;Jack eventually uses Wright's daughter to bait the murderer, and Wright flips out!
159;The ending is realistic, like the film, and reality can be cruel .
160;according to Penn's interesting direction.
161;Jack Nicholson is, to me, one of the best actors of this generation, and his acting in this movie was typical Nicholson.
162;There is only on cuss word in the whole movie, and used at the appropriate time, it is a suspenseful story set in a beautiful location.
163;The movie starts out very nicely.
164;I will say that the movie does leave you in constant anticipation of something's about to happen.
165;That part of the movie I liked
166;This film is easy to keep up with and has a wonder plot and exl ending it is a must see !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
167;The camera work of the inside of the coup, with the chickens, each seemingly walking around in his/her own world until some unexpected sound or vibration grabs their attention and they notice one another, is poetry of the highest order.
168;This one will make a fine roast, you can almost hear the person picking it up saying to themselves.
169;the scene is sublime poetry because for the brief moments the chickens are focused on they seem to take on human characteristics.
170;sean Penn's directing in this film is a triumph on many levels.
171;And yet as many others have said, the character work of others is equally compelling, making this masterful ensemble film a profound experience: Benicio del Toro as a mentally ill Native American whose mind is weak, but whose broken heart full of regret and fear is acute"
172;and the screenplay stands toe to toe with them all and becomes part of the masterful ensemble.
173;And yet the entire movie stands as a testament to the complicated nature of human existence that makes it obvious some promises were made to be broken.
174;a profound movie that is a great work of art.
175;If you like movies that are completely depressing downers, well you'll love this one.
176;the film was well acted and suspenseful.
177;Great small guest parts and Nicholson was great.
178;Nicholson plays Det. Jerry Black with stark earnestness.
179;He has everything he wants, a simple, happy existience.
180;The film's ending is a startling one.
181;His gloomy, effective cinematogrophy, combined with fine performances by all makes this film worth seeing.
182;Was a real dissapointment for me and my Wife.
183;We are Jack Nicholson lovers and bought the film before we ever saw it.
184;The film was very good until you got to the end.
185;Sean Penn's third directorial project portends a promising future behind the camera.
186;While the film drew criticism for its deliberate pace, every scene adds another brushstroke to the human canvas and develops the characters richly.
187;penn keeps the film intriguing, giving us subtle clues that cast suspicion on numerous characters as possible murder suspects.
188;nicholson is at his moody and sardonic best in this film.
189;He has an innate ability to play the complex and offbeat character to perfection, always believable despite being on the fringe of mental instability.
190;Robin Wright Penn takes an unglamorous role portraying a hard working lower class mother and gives a tremendous performance.
191;this is a good film with a mediocre story and a promising outing for Penn.
192;Action junkies will be bored but for those who enjoy a good character study it is worth a look.
193;The way he does that takes up most of the motion picture.
194;It is a psychological drama as he deals with his obsession.
195;His obsession eventually destroys friendships.
196;The story takes a major twist at the end, and you somehow feel that he has been left hanging.
197;it is not the type story that appeals to everyone, but it is a solid performance by Nicholson who carries most of the story.
198;This movie had all the ingredients of a great film: great cast, score, and director (The Great Sean Penn).
199;Great performances by Sam Shepard, Robin Wright.
200;An opportunity lost with a great cast.
201;Great performance by Aaron Eckhart as the cocky police detective determined to close the case.
202;He kept the movie entertaining.
203;Jack as always does a good job acting, the problem is the story and it's finale.
204;His relationship with a female bartender and her daughter develops wonderfully and then deteriorates when a set.
205;The relationship that you admire is shattered by mistrust, and the killer is never exposed.
206;I highly recommend seeing those two and skipping THE PLEDGE, the third filming.
207;Recently director Penn lamented the gun culture of contemporary cinema.
208;This is NOT a happy ending movie.
209;Sean Penn has a very disapointing directing style.
210;I very much enjoyed this film, and recommend it to viewers who appreciate fine acting and storytelling.
211;Just don't expect easy answers and an ending that warms the heart.
212;Sean Penn is one talented dude!
213;The Pledge, directed by Sean Penn, is very well filmed and acted.
214;Lots and lots of time.
215;He loves them both, so what does he do?
216;He uses the daughter as bait to catch the killer.
217;The acting was good and I was interested half.
218;Sean Penn proves he's a worthwhile director, he sets things up in an interesting way and what about Jack's performance?
219;There's this other camera still here.
220;If you want to watch a truely great director, watch Sam Raimi flicks.
221;The trailer misleads the viewer in a major way.
222;If you look inside through the dramatic core of this play, you will find a heartfelt homage to Rashomon: that glorious masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa.
223;as you see the concept of the truth appears in all its nakedness: it is an elusive idea that it makes us feel safe.
224;We just are able to see part of it: and that's all.
225;But this word has such hypnotic power, and fascinating charm, that seduces the mass since the dawn of the mankind.
226;One of the most intelligent films of that year, not for great audiences.
227;mesmerizing performance of Nicholson and excellent work behind the camera by Penn.
228;I didnt enjoy it the first time i watched it.
229;I guess its a real good movie if it is a lot bettter the 2nd time around.
230;We get to see a lot of stars in brief roles in this picture.
231;i thought that the film had a certain unique feature about it.
232;The certain twist at the end of the film puts a grin on your face and meks you think jack nicholson went crazy.
233;I highly recomend this movie.
234;You will enjoy this more if you like police movies.
235;While Jack Nicholson and Robin Wright Penn did an incredible job of acting that were Oscar worthy, eventually you just wanted the movie to be over.
236;The only reason I give this movie for stars is because of the superb acting by the entire cast.
237;But there's something similar I found on every review (with what I agree), Jack Nicholson performance is outstanding.
238;First, Jack Nicholson's performance is really outstanding (but again, that's something Jack has us used to).
239;Also I believe it's a good movie, which maybe wont be so enjoyable for the ones who are waiting for a police/action/drama movie.
240;I recommend this movie for the ones who liked psychological dramas.
241;But I think that's actually the best thing of the movie, because it's something you don't expect and it's new.
242;The keyword is new, with no doubt and unusual ending for an unusual movie.
243;This is good considering that for the last years we've been watching movies that seem more like remakes of old ones.
244;The pledge is a new and unusual movie to watch.
245;He plays a cop in such a way to make you believe that that's what he was always supposed to be.
246;One has to wonder how he totally immerses himself as he does.
247;this was my first Sean Penn movie, and while his style does take getting used to, it's worth it.
248;He builds suspense in much the same way Hitchcock did.
249;There were a few scenes I could have done without, but over all it showed a master's touch.
250;This was the first excellent film of the year for me.
251;It was a stunning bolt of filmaking from Indian Runner and Crossing Guard director Sean Penn and was acted intensely well by Jack Nicholson.
252;penn brings a intricate and sprwaling thriller of a story about a retiring detective, played with calm yet fierceness by Nicholson, who makes a promise to the mother of a child who was killed to find the killer.
253;This leads him into a journey into another woman's life (Wright.
254;Nicholson is equally exceptional in one of his best recent roles.
255;I liked the plot of the movie, but it was one of the slowest moving ones I have seen in a while!
256;This movie is really good.
257;But other than that, the story is very very interesting.
258;Nicholson's character is such a good cop, but only us, the audience, notices this.
259;He is chasing a serial killer.
260;She has a daughter, that fits that distinct taste for young girls the killer has.
261;One moral of the story is, always respect your elders opinions and beliefs.
262;i couldnt' take my eyes fof the screen.
263;everything is set up so wonderfully.
264;this is reallya smart flick that people who know how to thinm should watch.
265;The storyline is somewhat good but there should be something happening for the first hour and a half.
266;the acting is fine, and the story generates plenty of dramatic tension, but then the movie just fizzles out.
267;When I first saw the previews to this movie I was very excited.
268;This film caused quite a debate with my 20 year old son who found it pointless .
269;But he makes this last promise, uses his skills developed over many years, and is convinced to the point of obsession that he is right.
270;Everything is set for his ultimate triumph in front of his peers, the woman he loves, and the family he made the promise to.
271;It was the perfect ending from an existential point of view.
272;I agree with most of the other reviewers on the performances and direction.
273;Sean Penn is slowly becoming one of our best.
274;The Pledge opens with Detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) mumbling to himself and begins to unfold in flashback.
275;On the eve of Jerry's retirement, a young girl is found murdered in a small, neighboring town.
276;Aside from being one of Hollywood's greatest actors, Penn also shows himself to be a confident and talented director.
277;It sets up scenarios but allows you to draw your own conclusions about what they represent.
278;There's nothing flashy about the film and Penn (along with his cinematographer Chris Menges) creates a subtle miasma that complements the intelligent subtlety of the script.
279;After only three films, he's a remarkably assured director that very quietly led his film into places that mainstream films hardly dare to venture.
280;made on a fairly small budget, The Pledge is peppered with familiar faces filling out the supporting roles.
281;The Pledge is a master class of acting from all involved.
282;"The old homily ""big things come in small packages"" is a perfect description for Rourke's small part as the father of a missing girl."
283;With barely over a minute of screen time, Rourke delivers an emotional monologue that is heartbreaking and unforgettable.
284;then of course there's Jack Nicholson, one of our greatest living actors.
285;Despite such an eclectic and mesmerizing body of work, Nicholson has always had a persona that he injects into his roles.
286;i first saw the film nearly five years ago and I vividly recall how frustrated I was by it.
287;The film enjoyed a wide release, but not commercial success.
288;It's surprising, shocking, and initially very unsatisfying.
289;This is a film that demands your attention.
290;mystery and the ending does justice to that intent.
291;hollywood endings I've seen in years.
292;It defies audience expectation and will frustrate many who see it, but few will argue that it is unforgettable.
293;this is an unforgettable, hopeless, and haunting film that boasts one of Jack Nicholson's finest performances.
294;I assure you The Pledge is a masterpiece, albeit a forgotten one.
295;A very underrated but powerful film in which your attention is riveted to Nicholson's face as he lets you see into his troubled mind and his obsession with keeping a pledge to a mourning mother.
296;A great investment which will stand up to many viewings.
297;I am one of the most avid collector's of Jack Nicholson's work.
298;I have to date all but 2 films he has EVER done.
299;1995's Crossing Guard was a far superior collaboration between Penn and Nicholson.
300;Nicholson's performance is solid, if not off kilter.
301;If you like to come out of a movie with a warm, glowing, fuzzy feeling, give this one a wide berth.
302;A happy ending would have betrayed this (although, for those interested, the novel by Friedrich Drrenmatt has an even bleaker ending).
303;The Pledge is more of a character study than it is a Cop/Crime drama but that is a very good thing.
304;There is action in this film but it's more about a good man that will do anything to live up to the promise that he has made.
305;He makes a Pledge to the mother of the victim to find the murderer and you can tell that when Black makes a promise he keeps it.
306;when watching this film, keep an open mind.
307;many stars make cameo appearances which is nice to see but these cameos aren't just for show, they all contribute to the film's success.
308;Everyone is so believable that you find yourself not star hunting but losing yourself in the brilliant acting performances.
309;This movie will make you upset.
310;But after you have digested what you have watched you realize that you have seen something special and Penn has made you think.
311;"Nicholson avoids the ""over the top"" stuff he is well."
312;"The juxtaposition of the splendorous, pristine Sierras in the background and the seedy, violent ""civilization"" Jerry moves through make for a sincere and accurate depiction of much of the modern American West."
313;The performances are uniformly excellent, right down to the young boy who discovers the murdered girl in the opening scene.
314;there was some fairly good work here by some excellent actors.
315;in spite of moments of impressive acting and cinematography .
316;and that, my intelligent and unintelligent friends alike .
317;it starts off well enough with a quite interesting premise being set up, and although you probably surmise exactly where it's going, things seem promising and you sit back for the story to develop.
318;The performances are good enough, .
319;Jack Nicholson gives a very even keeled performance, restraining his natural essence to give a somewhat schizod personality to his character.
320;Sean Penn lets the story unfold artistically, not giving away to much so we are surprised at what happens next.
321;A virtuoso performance by Del Toro and Eckerson.
322;A real creepy confession, another artful turn by the director to take us off the beaten path.
323;I really liked the film and recommend it.
324;"this story is strongly based on an earlier film ""The Cold Light of Day"" that came out about 4 years earlier."
325;the production values are much better in this updated version.
326;"winning movies, not of which left me with anything
327;I knew nothing about The Pledge before I saw it, the best way to see a movie.
328;Sean Penn deserves cudos for taking on this existential story, and develop it into a visually beautiful, totally believable film.
329;Nicholson's portrayal of this sympathetic character, going deeper and deeper into his quest of honoring a promise kept the film going.
330;Too many movies pander to the audience's need to the neat, pat conclusion, when in reality, life is not like that.
331;elegant movie that doesn't cop out at the end.
332;The story is intriguing, the characters are realistic (mundane?)
333;, and the twist, if you can call it that, works perfectly.
334;It's shot beautifully, with all kinds of angles / close.
335;ups / still shots / symbolic images, and the music is just right .
336;But again, it's so good when a smart film like this doesn't slide into a zany, face.
337;While the cast of characters, setting and storyline all indicate a fair amount of promise for this movie.
338;installing, and still end up with a movie that you can't play.
339;The first time we got a look at Sean Penn was twenty years ago in the outrageous hit comedy, Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
340;His was one of the great breakthrough performances.
341;The Pledge is his latest directorial tour de force, and, like his previous efforts, it is heavy stuff.
342;On his last day, the body of a brutally murdered little girl is discovered.
343;this is Nicholson's best role in some time, and he is supported by a remarkable cast.
344;Some of these players have just one scene, but each of them still brings a power that the movie might not otherwise have had.
345;The movie knows that in life there are few pat answers.
346;After seeing and musing the import of this movie I have determined primarily that Nicholson is the consummate actor.
347;Sure, it is an ideal.
348;His character embarks on the very personal mission to find a killer: A promise made.
349;Evil in all forms wins most of the time.
350;In terms of accomplishment, it's easily Penn's best work as a director so far.
351;The story is also fleshed out but an amazing number of brilliant performances in smaller roles (Benecio Del Torro, Mickey Rourke, Helen Mirren, Harry Dean Stanton).
352;This movie is absolutely brilliant!
353;It is in my opinion one of the best mystery movies of all time.
354;the clues are very subtle in this film but I managed to discover them"
355;that said one should pay attention to the details the director has subtly shown and you will be left with an unforgettable, brilliantly fascinating film!
356;But that's all you will get from this movie, fellow.
357;This is another flop from Franchise Pictures after Battlefield earth, Get Carter, Art Of War, 3000 miles to Graceland, but this is the best movie to come out from Franchise Pictures.
358;Jack Nicholson gives another oscar caliber performance.
359;The ending is unusual, but I think it is very interesting.
360;The picture is excellent and the sound is OK as most of the movie is dialogue anyway.
361;I actually enjoyed it much more the second time around.
362;stop thrill ride like Silence of the Lambs or The Bone Collector.
363;This movie is somewhat of a thriller, but it is more of a film noir.
364;Now that I know what a film noir consists of, I was able to appreciate this movie for what it was.
365;don't get me wrong, in no way is this film flawless.
366;Now knowing what I was going to see, I can appreciate how it ends more.
367;sean Penn did a great job of making this film.
368;He wanted to make a film that he could be proud of, and one with great artistic value.
369;This is more of a watch.
370;All in all, The Pledge is a great film noir with a few thrills that enriches the movie even more.
371;The movie, at some points was a solid 3 and a half star film (out of 4) I was happy with the characters, I had a feeling everything was going to work out in the end, and I was content.
372;Penn coaxed some incredible performances out of his actors, and he is to be commended.
373;This is a great movie!
374;I have watched it several times and will watch it again.
375;Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite actors.
376;He connects with viewers in a personal way because he shares the emotions and experiences of his character with his audience.
377;He is familiar with bait.
378;This is one of those times.
379;That said, it has a nice twist to it and doesn't follow the typical parameter of its genre which is refreshing.
380;It is a totally engrossing film that will take you on a dark journey of the soul, the soul of one retired detective seeking justice he believes was not served , and at the same time battling his inner demons of loneliness and obsessions.
381;It is their ability to totally be the character without visible effort or 'acting', and at the same time, pulling the viewers with them into the world they have created.
382;in the Pledge, Nicholson manages it again, offering a very powerful performance worthy of any award.
383;like Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn proves that he is an excellent director, doing a wonderful job behind the camera, and not only he is an actor's director, but quite visual too, as the cinematography is top class,and the scenery breathtaking (Penn allows time to linger on it inan almost meditative eye).
384;the score is haunting and complements the scenes perfectly.
385;and the amount of top actors in small supporting roles is very interesting and adds a lot of weight to the film: Del Toro, Mikey Rourke (in a very short but well acted scene)Vanessa Redgrave, Harry Dean Stanton and Helen Mirren, whose character as a psychologist offers the viewer the first hint of Nicholson's tortured existence in a very memorable scene.
386;the Pledge is therefore an excellent underrated film that is a feast to the eyes and most importantly to the soul, to be added the collection of every 'cinema' lover.
387;thriller, and in Nicholson's admirably restrained performance the obsessive detective is a noble melancholy loner, fascinating and deeply flawed.
388;The casting throughout is canny: Penn not only makes shrewdly judged use of the saturnine Del Toro's feral features but also puts Tom Noonan in a pivotal role.
389;killer Francis Dollarhyde in Manhunter, Michael Mann's masterful version of Red Dragon.
390;it leaves a similarly haunting impression.
391;Its easy to get wrapped up in this film.
392;Its classic film noir, unorthodox, grim, yet completely satisfying.
393;Penn did an excellent job, and nicholson givesa magnificently understated performance.
394;As with his previous work it is very much a study of human beings, their strengths their weaknesses and their flaws.
395;Beautifully photographed, it is also morally ambiguous and ultimately downbeat portrayal of a good man obsessed with fulfilling a promise and unable to let go of the past in his attempt to give his life meaning.
396;jack Nicholson (who previously collaborated with Sean Penn, on the also excellent Crossing Guard) delivers one of his finest performances, in his subtle portrayal of a good man trying to keep a promise but at a personal cost.
397;And whilst this is far from the type of feel good movie such as `As Good As It Gets' that won him his last Best Actor Oscar, this is in my opinion a far superior movie and a far superior performance, in that although this haunting movie will not send you to bed with your faith in the human spirit restored, it will make you think and stay with you for much longer than any of your typical Hollywood fare.
398;Also excellent is the supporting cast, especially including a cast against type dowdy single mother, Robin Wright Penn, as well as Aaron Eckhart, Sam Shepard, Beniccio Del Torro, Helen Mirren and Tom Noonan.
399;the Pledge is a disturbing film but it is beautifully filmed and for this praise must be directed toward Chris Menges (Local Hero) for his beautiful cinematography.
400;The Indian Runner and The Crossing Guard) subtly allows his actors to shine.
401;Penn is as far as I'm concerned, one of America's finest character actors but he can surely now add to his resume the title of, one of America's great young film directors and I highly recommend this very intelligent movie (though clearly it will fly over many peoples heads).
402;"Sean Penns 3rddirecting job is outstanding since the similiar one ""THE CROSSINGGUARD""."
403;Jack Nicholson does a perfect job in this role.
404;Aside from the beautiful cinematography, and thoughtful editing, and Nicholson's stunning acting .
405;most reviews here mention the way the story ends .
406;the ending is exactly what lifts this movie out of the *merely good* bracket, right into the *damn powerful* category.
407;telling that doesn't resort to formula, and that can still grip us right to the end and linger afterwards in our mind.
408;I mean, from the previews and such, I thought that The Pledge was going to be a really good movie.
409;I went to see The Pledge purely because of its very good director and an excellent cast.
410;Jack is always at his best and he did very well here again.
411;The acting is superb and the story is moving.
412;Jack Nicholson did a great job in this film.
413;While it is not a happy tale, it is great!
414;If you are looking for a serial killer film that moves in a more realistic fashion with non.
415;mainstream plot elements then The Pledge will deliver.
416;The crime evidence is hard to obtain and the investigation leads are miniscule (as with most real.
417;the film's realism is what makes it so good.
418;In short, this film is much closer to a real.
419;the ending will annoy some, but personally I love it.
420;So this film really does play out the realism very well.
421;This is a very good character device and you do not see that done very often.
422;this is a very original movie that stays on rational ground.
423;This is a touching film .
424;a touching journey into the darker crossings in life that some do go through.
425;"this is a very good movie with some ""reservations"" for those who hate anything less than ""mainstream"" murder mysteries."
426;In what a local Los Angeles critic affectionately coined as his Trilogy of Anguish (in a brilliant review).
427;This is an emotionally ravaging story of an honest man's slow descent into madness.
428;while the flow of life around him will continue undisturbed regardless.
429;His own visual sensibility is astounding, and has been since The Indian Runner .
430;Special bravos to Nicholson, cinematographer Chris Menges, and the entire supporting cast.
431;You are a beautiful soul.
432;There is a great message in the movie about strangers and kidnapping.
433;He made a promise to one of the girl's mother to get to the bottom of it and not to quit until they find the person that killed her little girl.
434;He keeps (or at least tries to) his promise and even though he was now retired, he still continued to search for the person that killed the little girl.
435;I don't recommend the movie, to long, to predicting.
436;Another great film by the man himself .
437;It's so much like real life it'll turn you inside out and leave you screaming.
438;i've recommended this movie to several people, and never did I get a nuetral reaction.
439;powerful performance by Jack, playing a man losing everything close to him but trying to hang on to the one thing that gave his life meaning.
440;His acting here is much more affecting than As Good As It Gets.
441;You can truley empathise with Jerry Black who is at times resembling a mute in the way he doesnt say anything in the heat of the moment like the main twist at the end when his life seems to be going up after retirement but to start come crashing down again by a twist of fate.
442;Until there the movie is good.
443;If you are looking for a suspenseful thriller that will keep you entertained, do not see this movie.
444;This film has a grocery list of some of our finest actors,Benicio Del Toro, Aaron Eckhart, Robin Wright Penn, Sam Shepard, Helen Mirren, Patricia Clarkson, Beau Daniels, Michael O'Keefe, Vanessa Redgrave, Mickey Rourke, Eileen Ryan, Sam Shepard, and Harry Dean Stanton.
445;Each scene was a gem, and the last third of the film has you on the edge of your seat.
446;Jack Nicholson, Detective Jerry Black, is a good policeman who on the eve of his retirement is brought into a grisly crime of a young girl who is murdered.
447;He has found that the killer has a pattern, and he thinks that this town is near the area where the killer may next strike.
448;What happens is that the psychiatrist is able too draw out Jerry, and the first signs appear that something is not right.
449;The film is gripping and the characters are so intricate and nvolved that we are drawn in as more than just viewers.
450;The photography is beautiful and the back areas of Nevada are shown in all its glory.
451;Jack Nicholson delivers the role of his life and once again shows us what this type of ability can give to a film.
452;it was a riveting, emotional.
453;ridicule of his former police mates, Nicholson has the audience on the edge of our seats rooting for the proof of his redemption, as well as the gratitude of the mother he made the initial promise to, and the mother who's little girl he was in the process of saving, when lo and behold, the whole thing just sort of falls apart with an all.
454;Jack Nicholson gives a good performance and is the only cement that holds this film together.
455;The later is a fairly good film by Leonardo DiCaprio, the former by Sean Penn is a flop.
456;The Pledge, directed by Sean Penn, is an incisive, probing drama of a driven man who is psychologically and emotionally incapable of letting go of an event that.
457;"And it explores that aspect of human nature that, in certain individuals, at any rate, refuses to allow disregard of even a perceived infraction of justice
458;detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) of the Reno P. d. has come to the end of an illustrious career"
459;is going to solve this case, and he's going to do it his way, and to his satisfaction.
460;"Until then, in his mind anyway, this case is still ""open,"" and will remain so, until he deems otherwise and the forces compelling him at last subside."
461;And leave him in peace.
462;"as an actor, Sean Penn has demonstrated a range and depth of emotion that at times fairly implodes (as with his portrayal of Matthew Poncelet in ""Dead Man Walking""), and with such strength that the outward reverberations of it have a decided impact on the film."
463;And his subtle approach as a director has the same effect here.
464;His studied presentation and deliberate pace creates an underlying tension that runs through the film like a wire being slowly drawn tighter and tighter until it is taut to the point of breaking, and his hand is constantly on that wire, controlling it.
465;it back again, and making the drama of the story riveting in a way that definitely keeps the attention of the audience.
466;"He attaches you to Jerry Black as he quietly leads him through a field of emotional land mines, and it keeps you involved
467;This is commendable work by Penn, who has taken a basically good story (the screenplay is by Jerzy Kromolowski and Mary Olson.
468;kromolowski, based on the book by Friedrich Durrenmatt) to a higher level and turned it into a penetrating, insightful drama.
469;the combination of Penn and Jack Nicholson makes for an effective collaboration, in that Nicholson approaches his character, Jerry, with that same sense of reflective introspection that Penn brings to the film as director.
470;And it works splendidly"
471;And the fact that Nicholson can convey all of this so well, even in his (or Jerry's) most guarded moments, is what makes his performance so powerful and convincing.
472;He plays it entirely from the inside out, and the result is an absorbing, unforgettable character.
473;"Sean Penn has a way of telling a story that is uniquely his own, and it's that distinction that sets ""The Pledge,"" apart and makes it so engaging."
474;And I wanted tyou to know, Thank you!
475;The ending reminded me of Brando's directorial effort in One.
476;Instead, the editors chose to keep the girl alive, and have the two ride off into the sunset.
477;toy, and the picnic rendezvous with the little girl?
478;But perhaps that's the way life really is.
479;Instead of focusing on the main character's downfall and making the film into the same brilliant character study the book is, the film focuses on the subplot that is simply the catalyst for the main characters downfall.
480;He promises the child's mother that he will catch the murderer.
481;The next day, the police have a suspect in custody, thanks to a witness who can place him at the scene.
482;It's a tried and true mystery formula, and it could have been made to work here.
483;Mediocre minds can become famous and powerful: this film attests to this fact.
484;boy, oh boy, Sean, I'm impressed!
485;Jack Nicholson is a shadow of his former rudely endearing self.
486;"paced film with great moral weight and complexity, try 'Ordet' by Carl Dreyer, or 'Andrei Rublev' by Andrei Tarkovsky
487;will the good guys win?
488;it also takes in the world outside your movie theater (or home) as part of engaging you.
489;But since he's a cop, the world is still not right to him until he resolves this crime"
490;He does everything he knows is right, yet the world has its own way of resolving the problem without regard to his needs.
491;It tells us not to expect the wrong resolution, and expect slick.
492;He has a beautiful retired life, and a chance to use his skills to heal both a shattered family and his own misgivings at turning his job over to lesser men.
493;"He had thought of everything, planned masterfully
494;This could have been a great movie, and more's the tragedy, because so much comes off so well in the first 100 minutes you actually have hope for Sean Penn's directorial career.
495;All that said, Nicholson turns a great performance .
496;probably the best we've seen since The Witches of Eastwick .
497;the people in this film are about as perfect for their roles as you could ask.
498;Friedrich Durrenmatts novel provides a solid core upon which the filmmakers can build their case.
499;nicholson does a superb job playing out the many aspects of Jerrys mind and personality and Robin Wright Penn provides strong support as the waitress he comes to love through the course of the film.
500;He also does a fine job exploiting the small town, rural atmosphere in which the film is set.The Pledge starts out like a conventional thriller, but it ends up, much to the satisfaction of its audience, as something strangely unique and compelling.
501;Jack Nicholson is, as always, very good and he's the only reason I stuck with it to the horrendous end.
502;The story has great resonance.
503;possibilities for the symbolic if not archetypal.
504;On the day of his retirement, the detective played by Jack Nicholson has one more opportunity to perform an act worthy of Ingmar Bergman's knight in """"The Seventh Seal,"""" who is seeking to perform one significant, possibly redeeming action, in the face of death that is plaguing the homeland to which he has just returned from the Crusades."""
505;"To receive one more chance to set things right, and take a pledge to do so, is an opportunity almost too good to be true, though the very possibility stirs us with thoughts of a ""life well."
506;"lived,"" a journey ""successfully completed."""
507;"But in the end he throws his audience under the bus as assuredly as he does the anonymous, unapprehended killer Nicholson has pledged to bring to justice ""on his very soul."
508;"Poets, novelists, musicians, and especially scriptwriters study ""closure"" as though it were a form unto itself."
509;it can make or break all that has preceded the end.
510;selective in what it chooses to reveal to the spectator.
511;mouse game, even at the climactic moment.
512;"Some may defend the ending on the grounds that in some wacky sense The Pledge"" is completed, since the rapist who motivated Nicholson's valiant, self."
513;sacrificing quest is brought to a swift and sure end in a fiery inferno.
514;"a scene lifted from Eisenstein's ""Potemkin""), the unattended, rising ballon is an ""inside"" allusion that only the film."
515;"It's from Fritz Lang's powerful movie, ""M"" (1930), as daring a film as any that comes to mind."
516;to spare the offender the usual justice.
517;One sees an emotional side of Nicholson, rarely captured.
518;By the end of the year we had a lot on our minds, least of all best actor nominations.
519;for me, it was and still is Jack Nicholson's finest performance to date.
520;You know, where Nicholson plays Nicholson, and wins an award.
521;I can tell when you go beyond your acting skills and get into the skin and bones of a character.
522;Because, we see a single well formed character and relate to him and him only.
523;or is he?By the way, the music is haunting.
524;I found the ending a big let down.
525;It would have been a great movie.
526;It is none the less a finely crafted film, with great performances by Patricia Clarkson, Benicio Del Toro, Dale Dickey and of course Jack Nicholson.
527;Kudos to Sean Penn for delivering this psychological thriller with such clearity and suspense.
528;The Pledge (2001) is, in my opinion the last truly great dramatic performance he has done.
529;While I'm certainly not writing him off, I sincerely hope Jack can find several more roles that challange his formitable skills at delivering rivoting and compelling dramatic performances.
530;Until then The Pledge remains a latter day masterpiece by the single greatest actor of his generation.
531;If all you know about Jack Nicholson is As Good As It Gets this is a movie that will surely convince you that he is one of the greatest actors of our time.
532;I was completely drawn in by this film and all of the actors.
533;If you want a good guy always wins in the end kind of flick, forget The Pledge.
534;But, if you want a fantastic, thoughtful film, this is a winner!
535;Some movies are heavy and deep, others appeal to you because they are fun, picturesque, exciting, or nostalgic.
536;Others are movies you can watch again and again.
537;i love most genres and types.
538;Slow movies, fast movies, classics, courtroom dramas, action, suspense, independent, thrillers, foreign, nonfiction.
539;The Pledge features a slew of actors I know are talented .
540;and yet rarely feel compelled to watch.
541;The centerpiece is the great Jack Nicholson, a guy who never gives a boring performance and is doubtlessly even more interesting in real life.
542;The whole thing has the potential to grind to a halt under its Oscar.
543;"Instead, ""The Pledge"" is a compelling story, mostly because everyone works so hard to never get in its way."
544;The Pledge quite simply works.
545;There is a heinous, bloody murder of a pretty, blonde.
546;He discovers the M. o. is like that of a few others in a certain area.
547;it's close to a traditional detective movie, with much suspense.
548;It is one thing to be melancholy when there is a point to be made or human aspect worth exploring.
549;The brutal murder of children is a chilling and horrendous subject matter but Sean Penn directs the film with great restraint and intelligence.
550;I actually loved it as it stays and stays with you long after the film has finished.
551;A more conventional, audience friendly ending would have lent the film a great disservice since the screenplay is so well written and main characters so well established with their moral dilemnas, especially Jack Nicholson's Jerry Black, one of the more complex and compelling characters that he has ever played.
552;"Nicholson's performance greatly compliments Penn's direction
553;the Pledge also benefits greatly from one of Hans Zimmer's (along with Klaus Badelt)most haunting soundtracks, perfectly establishing the mood of beauty and danger in the Nevada settings.
554;The Pledge is a brave film that deserves a better audience than it has received and proof that not all really good films need to have cut and paste characters, a predictable plot and neat, tidy ending.
555;He sacrifices his retirement and the respect of his peers to keeping this pledge, and as we follow him in his quest the story becomes less about solving a mystery and more about the degenerative effects of obsession .
556;Penn has assembled an impressive cast for this film, which is easily the best of the three he's directed.
557;Penn is developing into a great director.
558;His preference for foregrounding performance, which threatened to undo his early films, is more controlled here and is aided by an economical screenplay.
559;Just as in his acting career, he continues to go from strength to strength.
560;First, let me say that I consider Jack Nicholson to be one of most underrated actors of his generation.
561;The supporting cast is excellent, Benecio Del Toro, Robin Wright Penn and even Vanessa Redgrave (one of the best performances in the film, although a brief one.
562;Sean Penn's direction is superb, with the intercutting of nature scenes with the main plot (watch for the symbolic flock of birds throughout the film).
563;Truly a haunting and poignant story, with excellent character studies all around.
564;I enjoyed watching him as this character.
565;Mickey Rourke has a small but memorable role in this that I also enjoyed.
566;Easy ordering from Amazon and fast delivery.
567;My opinion may not matter to anyone else but myself, but this movie had me riveted the entire time I watched it with a packed house at a matinee showing.
568;1) A suspensful thriller about a serial killer that would keep them riveted to their seats in the same way Seven or Silence of the Lambs did.
569;it's a deep psychologocial character study of one man's using his own unrelenting hunt for absolution and justic as a means for getting up in the morning.
570;plot, it's Black's personal descent that is the focus of the movie.
571;I personally am a fan of both intense mystery/thrillers and deep character studies, so having a really profound look at the typical cop role was fresh.
572;Yet, the film has to stand on it's own, despite any pre.
573;The Pledge is an emotional investment that, depending on how one likes their movies, may or may not pay off.
574;It certainly did for me, and if nothing else just watch it for what is the defining moment of this phase of Jack Nicholson's career.
575;the story was pretty simple and straightforward.
576;One thing leads to another, and they rob a bank, using toy guns.
577;Needless to say, The"""" Ending for """"The Pledge"""" is a lot like that."""
578;Personally, I liked the direction and cinematography.
579;I'll put it this way .
580;the Characters were beatifully potrayed by jack nicholson and penn. brilliant work!
581;I was somewhat surprised at the time, given the success of dark films like Seven and the pedigree of Nicholson and Sean Penn, but it makes sense in retrospect.
582;but with Nicholson, the consummate pro, and some good use of the Nevada setting's stark beauty (the night.
583;don't get me wrong, it's well acted.
584;Jack Nicholson gives a fantastic performance, but so do the other actors.
585;The Pledge is the newest film directed by Sean Penn and stars Jack Nicholson in one of his best performances.
586;jerry Black (Jack Nicholson), is a detective with the Reno, Nevada police department about to retire.
587;As he is set to leave on his retirement trip, a deep sea fishing trip paid for by people in the department, he has second thoughts and returns to the case.
588;These people are played by an impressive array of character actors, but their roles are very small.
589;This provides Nicholson with a showcase.
590;Nicholson plays Black quietly, making him real, making him human.
591;He could be a real detective on the police force.
592;Believe me, it is a welcome sight to watch Nicholson become a real human being rather than a character become Nicholson.
593;The Pledge works as a character study, and at times, the slow pace of the film help it seem all the more authentic.
594;The investigation scenes in the snowy drifts are also very believable.
595;This is the way life is in this town, in this area, but it doesn't help the story in the long run.
596;i also enjoyed the ending.
597;It seemed more authentic than most conventional thrillers.
598;The impressive list of character actors was welcome, but their roles were more distracting than anything else.
599;She's always great, but I wanted more of her.
600;She merely reiterates that the victim was very sweet and innocent.
601;Benicio Del Toro creates another vivid character, who has a large part in the overall mystery.
602;In the last month, we have seen three films with Del Toro, each of which has proven that he is a very, very good actor.
603;"i think you will find Nicholson's performance in ""The Pledge"" worth the price of admission alone."
604;( Mars Attacks is something I could do without.)
605;So I went to see it.
606;"I'm leaving a job working for a person whom most think has an outstanding work ethic
607;So the film is a portrayal of a very real life situation!Thanks, Sean Penn.
608;I think the film is brilliant.
609;going population is more intelligent than it really is.
610;He played everything perfectly, but for a simple twist of fate, he ends up being the bad guy.
611;Not perfect, but vastly underrated.
612;I look forward to Penn's next behind.
613;She goes home with the bait (the little girl).
614;this is a beautiful looking move with a near haunting soundtrack (which I can't find anyplace) that absolutely keeps the viewer sucked in .
615;I liked this movie up to the point that I realized that he was using the girlfriend's daughter as bait for a serial child murderer.
616;This is a good movie and it is an interesting story and it flows well from the beginning.
617;I was enjoying the movie until it got to the end.
618;The critics thought this was Jack's best pic, but I thought it bit the big one .
619;Jack Nicholson has more talent than this.
620;packed Hollywood movie with a typical happy ending.
621;It is an exercise in great acting and psychology.
622;There are some incredible scenes in the beginning of the movie where Black looks at pictures of himself when he was young, he also catches a glimpse of an elderly man using a walker to get around outside his window.
623;The Pledge is an intelligent work of art with an incredible performance from Nicholson.
624;Nicholson and Penn make a great team and they have made a great great movie here.
625;Then he has to give a promise to them and to God that he'll find the killer .3.
626;This film is more about the human mind than the investigation in this case .
627;The Pledge is IMO one of Nicholson's best performances because he actually creates a great screen character, Detective Jerry Black.
628;Jerry is well respected by his fellow cops both young and old for his retirement present they send him on a fishing trip to Mexico.
629;the Pledge is a great movie but it may not be for everyone especially people who like happy Hollywood endings.
630;I recommend this movie highly because of Nicholson's great acting and also a cast that includes true Hollywood royalty like Aaron Eckhart, Robin Wright, the movie was directed by her then husband Sean Penn.
631;The Pledge also includes some solid chameos by Benicio del Toro, Helen Mirren and Mickey Rourke!
632;the movie is good enough if you need time to pass.
633;Very telling story full of pathos.
634;Great movie in the jack Nicholson style
635;Very few movies provoke us the way a film should, as soon as we leave the theater we have totally forgotten what we have just seen.
636;The Pledge is, as another reviewer stated, a breath of fresh air in the days that popcorn movies rule the box office.
637;Those who hated this film were expecting a big, fast, chase the killer movie, but what we get is one of Nicholson's best performances, and one of the best films of the year!
638;in one crucial scene, from the events of which the film takes its title, Nicholson vows to the murdered girl's mother that he will find her child's killer and bring him to justice, swearing by his own soul's salvation that he will do so.
639;The ambiguity that characterizes every turn of the plot is suggested by the opening titles, and is reintroduced when Nicholson makes his pledge.
640;nicholson turns in a great performance, as usual.
641;The location filming is beautiful (I say that with an element of bias, of course), and the film is visually compelling.
642;The haunting score, when it avoids cliches at the hands of veteran composer Hans Zimmer, complements the film's visual beauty.
643;Penn is a big Bruce Springsteen fan and it shows in his ambiguous treatment of the characters .
644;he focuses in on them, shows a snapshot of their lives, and then pulls the camera away, giving barebones exposition, and trusting the audience to reach their own conclusions.
645;The questions left unanswered at the end are similar to those of """"Mystic River"""" and make the movie so good."""
646;Penn trusts his audience to be smart.
647;as for the performances, Jack Nicholson and Robin Wright Penn are fantastic.
648;It's one of Nicholson's best films of late and doesn't just rely on him to do his Jack thing
649;I like movies that remain with you a couple of days after you watch them.
650;In that regard, The Pledge is right on target.
651;Sean Penn (director), Jack Nicholson (lead), and the rest of the cast did a fabulous job in this film.
652;But to Penn's credit, the relationship between Nicholson's and Wright.
653;okay, now to the ending.
654;I think a more creative ending could have been wrought from such a marvelous build.
655;But this was still a good movie that shouldn't be missed.
