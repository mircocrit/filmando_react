I:8652;1;Peter Benchley's best selling novel comes to life in Jaws.
I:8652;2;In other words, Brody has to do something about it, and fast.
I:8652;3;But the whole plot and storyline is very well laid out.
I:8652;4;I haven't read the book Jaws, but I'm guessing it's pretty similar to the movie.
I:8652;5;the acting is really good in Jaws.
I:8652;6;Roy Scheider does a great job of portraying Martin Brody.
I:8652;7;Everyone else does a great job too.
I:8652;8;Also, the movie is pretty good for being filmed in 1975.
I:8652;9;so the bottomline for Jaws is that it's a good movie.
I:8652;10;If you enjoy this movie, you're in for a lot more Jaws movies.
I:8652;11;There's actually 3 more Jaws movies.
I:8652;12;Greatest and best priced JAWS movie set on the web.
I:8652;13;This movie is great!The plot is great!The charicter's are great!This movie is fantastic.
I:8652;14;A great movie that I love to watch anytime.
I:8652;15;I seems silly to even rate a movie that is so widely known.
I:8652;16;The character and plot development were really well done, and the closing action was really drawn out, but in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:8652;17;And the 'Making Of' feature was impressive.
I:8652;18;A buoy clangs its warnings.
I:8652;19;A couple goes to the water's edge.
I:8652;20;The next morning a man gets a telephone call.
I:8652;21;There are body parts on the beach, with crabs.
I:8652;22;One man offers to catch the shark for $10,000.
I:8652;23;The people see something in the water.
I:8652;24;A barrel floats close to the boat.
I:8652;25;Quint puts another harpoon and barrel into the shark.
I:8652;26;There is a new development for a happy ending.
I:8652;27;Note the message from the ending to this story.
I:8652;28;Note the freedom to keep and bear arms then.
I:8652;29;I refute this with the style of direction by Steven Spielberg.
I:8652;30;He is a genius for focusing the story on the attack of the shark, rather than on the shark itself.
I:8652;31;We don't actually witness the shark until well into the story.
I:8652;32;This is the true definition of a horror movie, a flic that scares us using our minds rather than our eyes.
I:8652;33;also, Shaw, Dreyfuss, Scheidner, and Hamilton are brilliant in portraying their characters.
I:8652;34;Few movies have been able to capture the audience's attention with such a simple opening scene.
I:8652;35;The brilliant combination of surrealistic lighting, the twilight becoming dawn, and especially and PRIMARILY one extremely haunting theme song ensure that Speilberg and co. have your undivided attention.
I:8652;36;But Jaws takes that which we can conceive as very real, the Great White Shark and makes the audience feel that this could really happen to you.
I:8652;37;The movie's buildup is fantastic and the climax is simply unforgettable.
I:8652;38;The sheer malevolence with which Scheider delivers his coup de grace in the face of an unblinking monster is definitely one of the greatest cinematic sequences ever captured on celluloid.
I:8652;39;time with his toy shark.
I:8652;40;"My son loved it of course
I:8652;41;Jaws will always be Classic!
I:8652;42;This movie brings me back to my childhood, watching in anticipation as the ominous music plays.
I:8652;43;The collector edition was a great gift and my boyfriend was very happy to add it to his collection.
I:8652;44;"YOU'RE GONNA NEED A BETTER MEDIUM., 2 Sep 2012JAWS THE BLU RAY""What we have here is a perfect movie, all it does is entertain, terrify adults and give little kids nightmares all night long."
I:8652;45;Like most people from my generation, I have a strange but very personal history with this movie.
I:8652;46;"My older brother saw it when it first came out and being a kid who lived inside his own head most of the time
I:8652;47;Weird or what, right?I loved the movie and still consider it to be one of the most perfect movies ever made, great, mind blowing opening, and great pace, characters you care about, funny, frightening, and suspenseful with a great ending that makes you want to jump up and down on your chair and cheer.
I:8652;48;i later read the novel in school, the version without the steamy affair between Hooper and Ellen Brody, and I loved that too.
I:8652;49;there I got in the best line in the movie.
I:8652;50;great novel, great story, great actors, Roy, Richard and Robert, great screenplay, great cinematography, and brilliant directing from a guy young enough not to know the difference between courage and stupidity.
I:8652;51;"The underwater shots of the shark are especially good and one has to include the eeriness of the SS Indianapolis scene with the whales singing to each other in the background
I:8652;52;"and as for the extras, well, we still get all the extras from the 30th Anniversary Edition, including the great Making Of, which ran at 1 hour and 40 minutes and I thought when I first saw that that it was brilliant, I loved all the behind the scenes information
I:8652;53;I remember seeing this when it was released and was telling my son how scary it was.
I:8652;54;At the time they were amazing.
I:8652;55;So with fresh eyes, the best review I can give it is that the transfer from the original film is amazing.
I:8652;56;The sound is great, the picture is PERFECT, and it gave me the sensation that I can only imagine it was like to see it on the big screen when it first came out.
I:8652;57;Saw this movie in the theater when it came out and I can honestly say I love this version.
I:8652;58;ray are worth getting alone.
I:8652;59;JAWS is, in my opinion, one of the movies that saved Hollywood and revitalized the movie industry.
I:8652;60;the movie includes an assemblage of great actors.
I:8652;61;The casting is superb, and the acting is top.
I:8652;62;Bruce the huge shark mechanical used in the movie actually takes on a character of its own, one that develops as the story moves along.
I:8652;63;main and supporting characters are all outstanding.
I:8652;64;there is suspense, story line, acting, and nearly tactile horror that grips you as you are drawn into this story.
I:8652;65;a true classic by an outstanding director, featuring an excellent cast.
I:8652;66;both are wonderful treats for anyone who enjoys tales of the sea.5 stars all the way!I hope this review was helpful to you .
I:8652;67;I never get sick of watching this masterpiece of suspense, it's your classic man against nature story and I love it.
I:8652;68;Steven Spielberg's second feature film (and one of his most challenging projects), Jaws was THE blockbuster event of 1975.
I:8652;69;Based on Peter Benchley's novel, this very effective thriller set box office records higher than any previous film.
I:8652;70;What he deduces is chilling: the deadly creature prowling out to sea is a great white shark.
I:8652;71;jaws is one of those rare movie adaptations that is better than its source novel.
I:8652;72;The screenplay is crisp and taut, yet with enough light moments and scenes of sometimes wry humor that ease the ever increasing tension, particular when Brody, Hooper and Quint set out to hunt the great white shark.
I:8652;73;becoming the hunted in the process.
I:8652;74;Jaws also put composer John Williams on the map with movie audiences with his now.
I:8652;75;The documentary on the making of the film is also first.
I:8652;76;get for Spielberg (and action film) fans.
I:8652;77;It also came with a UV code so I have access to it digitally.
I:8652;78;Especially the fact that it's Universal's 100th anniversary.
I:8652;79;Jaws is the best movie ever made.
I:8652;80;in my lifetime (or, one of the best, for certain).
I:8652;81;But I will say that the main characters in this movie (not counting the shark) are what makes a good movie great.
I:8652;82;I am, along with being a big cat, hyena, and wolf lover, also a shark lover.
I:8652;83;Sharks are both cool and beautiful.
I:8652;84;And Steven Spielberg is a jerk.
I:8652;85;My favorite movie of all time!
I:8652;86;One great story, combine with great acting, great sound, and directing, and you got a masterpiece.
I:8652;87;Highest possible recommendation, for those who saw it back then, enjoy it now on Blue.
I:8652;88;this is one great movie to keep you out of the water.
I:8652;89;this is one of Steven Spielberg's first movies that he made.
I:8652;90;Just the best movie ever!
I:8652;91;You can really see it when viewing the deleted scenes.
I:8652;92;It's great to see one of my most loved films restored beautifully on Blu.
I:8652;93;I wonder how the young generation today, those who grew up with only CGI, will take to Bruce and this film.
I:8652;94;Good scary movie that I saw years ago at the theater and thought I might want to look at it again.
I:8652;95;It was shipped to me in good condition and in a timely manner.
I:8652;96;Now I can watch when ever, and the Blue ray makes it even better, bonus stuff too.
I:8652;97;the way the shark looked was so awesome and real!!
I:8652;98;they didint have computers to make affects or anything like that but they still pulled through and had made a very real looking life like killer shark.
I:8652;99;the charecters are great and have lots and lots of depth.
I:8652;100;its realy thrilling to and has lots of scares and action.
I:8652;101;it has a pretty high body count and its not that gory but its still cool to watch after jaws draggs his victims down into the cold abbyis and then you see all this blood cloud over the water.
I:8652;102;the most thrilling part id say is at the end when the ship is sinking and the main charecter is up on the sail and has to figure out a way to kill jaws before the boat completely sinks and he becomes a meal for the killer shark!!!!
I:8652;103;Still holds up after all these years.
I:8652;104;In the first version, you can only see most of the shark's head and one of the people on board.
I:8652;105;In the widescreen, you see everyone.
I:8652;106;Spielberg has a terrific eye and knows how to compose a frame.
I:8652;107;And the widescreen format is the only way to do justice to this fun and scary film.
I:8652;108;The sound is great and will remind you why John William's soundtrack is famous 25 years later.
I:8652;109;This, along with many other interesting tidbits, was revealed to me with a behind.
I:8652;110;There's interviews with the cast members today, as well as a fun trivia game.
I:8652;111;I also found the deleted scenes interesting, although I'm glad Spielberg didn't use them.
I:8652;112;If you're a fan of the film, you will want to own this.
I:8652;113;All I can say is WOW!
I:8652;114;The colors are extremely vibrant and in your face gorgeous!
I:8652;115;Jaws is and was one of the great classic Movies that made movies fun to watch.
I:8652;116;Kids loved it but .
I:8652;117;One of my all time favorite movies .
I:8652;118;They did a great job remastering this movie for the blue ray release, and the bonus features are great .
I:8652;119;This is a movie everyone should have in their personal library.
I:8652;120;Without a doubt, this is still one of the most suspenseful and scary movies of all time.
I:8652;121;This really will make you 'afraid to go into the water'.
I:8652;122;I honestly don't think I have seen this well done of a restoration .
I:8652;123;so sharp, looks natural .
I:8652;124;to paraphrase Spielberg in one of the extras on the restoration process .
I:8652;125;this one sets the benchmark!
I:8652;126;The two hour making of documentary is worthy of release on its own.
I:8652;127;Probably the best feature ever on the making of a film.
I:8652;128;The bonus copy is interesting, it tells the back story of how the movie was made (however, it does take away some of the magic ).
I:8652;129;JAWS, one of the finest films in Cinema historyFrom start to finish, this film will have you captivated.
I:8652;130;forget what it may do to your perception of ocean activities, it's worth viewing.
I:8652;131;Brand new great price, was looking for a box set unfortunately they don't have one but this is a good start!!
I:8652;132;In this classic movie, I liked how realistic the shark seemed.
I:8652;133;this movie will be loved for a long time.
I:8652;134;The original summer blockbuster, Steven Spielberg's JAWS quickly became my favorite film growing up, having devoured it on VHS and on ABC's Sunday Night Movie presentation (the one with the added footage) so many times I could recite dialogue before I was out of grade school.
I:8652;135;Spielberg's miraculous direction took advantage of every difficult production situation to create an all.
I:8652;136;time film masterwork that's always been as satisfying for its unforgettable characterizations, surprising humor and memorable atmosphere as it is a white.
I:8652;137;"As I write in my review of the terrific ""Jaws: Memories From Martha's Vineyard"" book a year ago, ""Jaws"" itself was a collaborative success, one that saw actors from Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw down to extras improvising their lines, giving the film a real, human center that we seldom see in modern filmmaking."
I:8652;138;combined with our unpredictable and ever.
I:8652;139;"universal has produced a number of ""100th Anniversary"" Blu."
I:8652;140;rays this year with remastered transfers .
I:8652;141;res 35mm original film elements, this is one of the most satisfying catalog releases the studio has produced on Blu.
I:8652;142;It's at least a noticeable improvement in that regard).
I:8652;143;"minute ""From The Set"" segment includes candid footage of the production's first few days on."
I:8652;144;It's a wonderful segment and it's a shame it doesn't go on longer than it does.
I:8652;145;ultimately, Universal has done one of their crown jewels proud with a Blu.
I:8652;146;ray that boasts one of the format's finest catalog transfers .
I:8652;147;That giant fish proves to this day to be one of the most horrifying and successfully bone chilling creatures in movie history.
I:8652;148;I stand by the belief that `Jaws' is one of the greatest movies ever made.
I:8652;149;It has all the components of a good thriller and satisfies the moviegoer from start to finish.
I:8652;150;The film really takes a turn for the superb as these men soon realize that they are indeed being hunted by the shark.
I:8652;151;The madness sets in slowly and the film's finale is jaw dropping.
I:8652;152;i think that everyone who has ever seen `Jaws' can attest to the fact that the opening sequence with young Chrissie Watkins decides to skinny dip in the dangerous waters stands alone as one of the most heart racing and all around gut wrenching scenes in motion picture history.
I:8652;153;This is the reason that `Jaws' is a classic.
I:8652;154;steven Spielberg is a masterful director and he turns out yet another brilliant picture in `Jaws'.
I:8652;155;The mood created by the lighting, the music and the camera angles (I know the whole `shooting from the sharks perspective' was done on account of the mechanical shark being `out of order' half the time, but it was brilliant) helps terrify the audience.
I:8652;156;the cast is all at the top of their games here.
I:8652;157;Roy Scheider manages to make Martin Brody relatable and real to the audience, and Murray Hamilton captures the pompous selfishness surrounding Larry Vaughn perfectly.
I:8652;158;It's Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss though who take the cake so.
I:8652;159;speak in regards to electric performances.
I:8652;160;Shaw is magnificent as Quint and Dreyfuss breathes so much life into Hooper.
I:8652;161;I just love Dreyfuss and this performance is yet another reason why.
I:8652;162;Anyone who has ever seen this film must admit that it had a huge impact on how they viewed a leisure swim.
I:8652;163;I still hear that fear inspiring composition every time I get in the water.
I:8652;164;Even though I knew exactly what would happen my adrenaline would always rise during certain parts of the film (the severed head, the girl being tossed around during the opening sequence, and Chief Brody's last desperate attempt to kill the monster shark, etc.) This is essentially a perfect film where the characters are developed enough so that we care about them when they are put in peril.
I:8652;165;The special features were also quite interesting.
I:8652;166;Overall this is one of the best blu.
I:8652;167;This is exactly how classic movies should be released on blu.
I:8652;168;This film is the heart of all new ideas for movies, the movie is basically a large shark which has inhabited an area where sharks are not usually found.
I:8652;169;i loved this film beginning to end, after the first shark attack i knew this was going to be a classic!!!
I:8652;170;The movie itself is a solid 5 Star (one of the all.
I:8652;171;time greats) but a spectacular Blu.
I:8652;172;def) transfer has yet to come.
I:8652;173;It makes for a great addition to any movie collection.
I:8652;174;Now she really likes scary movies.
I:8652;175;She insisted so I bought it for her.
I:8652;176;I bought it for my son and he loves it!
I:8652;177;No one can deny this is one of Spielberg's top 5 best films.
I:8652;178;superbly acted drama, suspense, action and adventure.
I:8652;179;They loved it, but were forbidden to talk to me about it.
I:8652;180;If you like scary movies, this is it.
I:8652;181;steven Spielberg's first and perhaps greatest masterpiece (of many) also epitomizes the summer blockbuster.
I:8652;182;the three main characters are somewhat clich d, but the talented actors portraying them manage to keep these men from being laughably cartoonish.
I:8652;183;Richard Dreyfuss is a boy genius icthyologist whose family wealth allows him to turn a hobby, the study of sharks, into a career.
I:8652;184;by story's conclusion, Ryan joins his prototype in death, the boy has become a man nearly eaten by the Great White he tried to poison, and Scheider learns he actually likes the sea.
I:8652;185;But what brings them to these ends is unforgettable cinema, and the reason this film was the blockbuster of 1975, a phenomenon that has yet to be equalled in public hysteria and popularity.
I:8652;186;john Williams' famous score is one of his best, subsequently imitated yet never topped.
I:8652;187;screen action and helps turn what could've been an average monster movie into a screen classic.
I:8652;188;This is an all time favorite of mine.
I:8652;189;The video presentation is stunning, with an orchestral score to match.
I:8652;190;The supplements are so bountiful it will take either a long afternoon or multiple days to go through them!
I:8652;191;style extras and the trailers.
I:8652;192;The Film:Jaws, as most of us know is the story of a lonely shark looking for love .
I:8652;193;Hailed as an all time classic by most, this is the film that put Spielberg on the map.
I:8652;194;The emotion from the characters jumps out and grabs you.
I:8652;195;A fine assortment of toys that would round out any film, but accent this one perfectly.
I:8652;196;dum thriller, I would highly recommend this movie to them.
I:8652;197;Everything about this movie is great.
I:8652;198;Renegade great white shark vs Roy Scheider, a gizzled fisherman, and Richard Dryfuss in one of his less annoying roles.
I:8652;199;Of course Jaws is one of the best movies ever made.
I:8652;200;This version just adds more good stuff to the original.
I:8652;201;Jaws is, without any doubt, a true classic.
I:8652;202;Jaws personified the horror genre and perfected true fear in a film without even seeing the antagonist fully until about halfway through the film [the first half has the audience seeing through the shark's eyes].
I:8652;203;Jaws was something of a classic already when I was a kid.
I:8652;204;And when Great White started attacking Steven Spielberg's ridiculously small boat, I yawned.
I:8652;205;I doubt Great White Sharks can become this large.
I:8652;206;"One of my workmates (let's call him Happy Chappie) actually likes ""Jaws"", claiming it's a real classic and one of the best films ever made."
I:8652;207;Alien is a real horror movie.
I:8652;208;"Every time I see ""Jaws"", I want to feed Spielberg to the xenomorphs!I'll give it two stars for old times sake."
I:8652;209;What more do I have to say.
I:8652;210;One of the best movies ever made, and an instant classic in my book.
I:8652;211;JAWS (1975), IMHO, is the best film in the 1970s.
I:8652;212;That's my story and I'm sticking to it!
I:8652;213;Spielberg's timeless tale of a New England island terrorized by a maneating shark is the seminal Hollywood blockbuster.
I:8652;214;It's got something that EVERYONE can latch onto and enjoy.
I:8652;215;a wealth of great characters, suspense, drama, thrills, action, adventure.
I:8652;216;The genius of Steven Spielberg's early works is that he managed to make us part of the action, the same way that Alfred Hitchcock did, but I dare say that Spielberg upped the ante quite a bit because films of the 70s had a palpability and realism that the primary filmmaking career of Hitchcock (the 40s and 50s) just weren't allowed to possess.
I:8652;217;fact) are scarier than seeing the creature itself.
I:8652;218;Layers of character are revealed throughout JAWS.
I:8652;219;rounded, diverse LEAD characters that complement each other so well?
I:8652;220;nope!Modern filmmakers of summer movies ought to watch early Spielberg just to see how to handle not just lead actors, but also supporting characters and extras as well.
I:8652;221;The cinematography in JAWS puts you right there along with the characters.
I:8652;222;"Whenever I watch JAWS, I feel like I'm right there with these guys battling that shark!The story of JAWS is so simple, yet is told with such forthright confidence and clarity that it comes across a lot deeper than many more ""complex"" films."
I:8652;223;The 2 major supporting actors, Lorraine Gary as Mrs. Brody and Murray Hamilton as the town mayor are just as authentic as the main characters.
I:8652;224;The woman who plays the grieving Mrs. Kitner shines in her brief scene (the most emotional, authentic scene of the entire film).
I:8652;225;As impressive as Spielberg was with the pulse.
I:8652;226;"chasing moments in the last act, I was equally impressed with the way he incorporated and handled these ""little"" moments, which are a huge reason why JAWS still holds up all these years later."
I:8652;227;And that is a testament to how much effort and work was put into the process.
I:8652;228;professional move script writers agreed with me that the plot of this movie is very thin, and here's a perfect example.
I:8652;229;I mean, knows that this is happening.
I:8652;230;* = well, okay, there were about thirty.
I:8652;231;The movie that kept us on the beach, has resurfaced once again in Blu Ray form!
I:8652;232;The detail is perfect, and the colors are so rich.
I:8652;233;The visual scope of this movie is stunning in this format, and Universal has taken great steps to ensure it is top of the line in the restoration process.
I:8652;234;Spielberg is even pround and he tells you so!
I:8652;235;"It is a very good retrospective on the movie, not to mention adding a lot to the otherwise known ""Making of Jaws"" that is once again included."
I:8652;236;"The Shark is Still Working brings more of the human element on the making of the movie, and actually shows more than the ""Making of"" feature in some respects."
I:8652;237;That would've been the ideal package for me!
I:8652;238;"I'm a ""behind the scenes"" type of viewer, especially to the classics, but the main meat of this whole thing is the actual movie itself."
I:8652;239;But it does bring you in and grip you like it always did, but now with a little more intensity.
I:8652;240;I did, and will continue.
I:8652;241;I knew I was getting a great movie.
I:8652;242;And the movie is great.
I:8652;243;The performances are great, particularly that of Robert Shaw whose Quint is portrayed as not.
I:8652;244;The musical score creates suspense.
I:8652;245;I was on the edge of my seat.
I:8652;246;This movie is a credit to everyone associated with it, from the stellar cast of actors and actresses to the direction by Steven Speilberg to the original story (a novel) and screenwriting by Peter Benchley.
I:8652;247;This is a riviting tale superbly told, with excellent cinematography and special effects, and a scary soundtrack that builds the edge of mystery to a crescendo each time it musically announces the shark's appearence.
I:8652;248;"the idea for the movie is deceptively simple
I:8652;249;Inject into this some interesting and novel subplots regarding a burned.
I:8652;250;out city cop and unlikely undersung hero, a brainy, affable but basically misunderstood young marine biologist, and a wonderfully crusty old mariner turned professional shark fisherman and you have the recipe for an entertaining rollercoaster ride.
I:8652;251;this movie is a modern classic, one with a young Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and the late Robert Shaw.
I:8652;252;Watching their characters interact is an afternoon's entertainment well deserved, one that is durable and repeatable.
I:8652;253;This 1975 blockbuster by Steven Spielberg became the first real summer blockbuster film.
I:8652;254;Having grossed about $260 million at the box office, it opened the doors for the epic summer film.
I:8652;255;Notmany of the films in years since, has been able to equal the sheer brilliance of Jaws.
I:8652;256;There are numerous scenes that are classic and incredibly memorable.
I:8652;257;There are scenes that are destined to make your heart beat faster and your pulse to race.
I:8652;258;Spielberg executes it so well, and gets his actors to deliver such real performances, that it all comes off as very real and believeable.
I:8652;259;This is one of the finest thrillers ever made hands down.
I:8652;260;Jaws is still one of the best movies ever made.
I:8652;261;As good or better than I remembered.
I:8652;262;one of the best (mostly) realistic thrillers of the last few decades.
I:8652;263;Perhaps even superior to the original Benchley novel.
I:8652;264;This film truely set bars in terms of effects and has a theme that everyone knows.
I:8652;265;Classics films are ones that deserved to be watched and can be enjoyed no matter how long after it has been made.
I:8652;266;This IS one of those films.
I:8652;267;It told a classic story of man versus nature, but with a modern (1975) twist.
I:8652;268;I loved the build up to the final battle and felt the acting was both real and sincere.
I:8652;269;I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good scare!
I:8652;270;ray remasters I've ever seen.
I:8652;271;I strongly recommend you watch the remastering featurette included on the Blu.
I:8652;272;ray disk prior to watching the movie so you can have a greater appreciation for the improvements made to this version.
I:8652;273;This movie is so deeply scary in a wonderful, classic way.
I:8652;274;I like that this movie has you on the edge with it's drama screens.
I:8652;275;I think any one over the age of 12 could enjoy it.
I:8652;276;A few screens with language bleeps but other wise a family movie.
I:8652;277;ray just to watch the new Documentary actually.
I:8652;278;If you already have a previous edition of it, then you are fine with the one that you have.
I:8652;279;this edition features some excellent bonus features, including a two hour long documentary on the making of the movie, as well as a nicely put together scrapbook of pictures and quotes from the cast and crew.
I:8652;280;It's still a scary, taut, perfectly pieced together thriller.
I:8652;281;Transfer on this flick is just AMAZING, done in great JOB and is in 2:35 ratio wide screen .
I:8652;282;beautiful transfer, Superior JOB they did on this blu.
I:8652;283;tHANK YOU and that's why I ordered it and worth every penny!About the movie .
I:8652;284;is the classic well done amazing JAWS movie EVER MADE TILL NOW HANDS DOWN and must have in ur collection >> A+
I:8652;285;Not really much to say here since this is one of the most iconic movies ever made.
I:8652;286;Very well put together and has a few extras that are nice.
I:8652;287;The joys of us getting to let our daughters watch the movie for the first time is truely priceless.
I:8652;288;when first watching it at the age of 5 i just loved the shark scenes but over the years i have learnt to appreciate the finer aspects of the film and the attention to detail to which Spielberg and his crew went to.
I:8652;289;everyone knows by now that what makes the film so frightning is the music by John Williams(SUPERMAN,JURRASIC PARK)and what you dont see.
I:8652;290;Remember using your imagination is the best tool to scare yourself.
I:8652;291;in my opinion JAWS is is near enough the perfect film.
I:8652;292;Roy Schieder is so right for his part and was born for the role as the chief of police in Amity island.
I:8652;293;on the other hand Brody uses the names Quint and well this is interesting because only on the odd occasion does Brody use Hoopers name, the only occasion i recall is 'Let Hooper take a turn'.
I:8652;294;what sets JAWS apart from other films of similar type is that the film builds up to a grand finale.
I:8652;295;in deep Blue Sea you see the the shark in the first 5 minutes need i say more.
I:8652;296;the way Brody was always worrying,trying to do the right thing and him hating the water was a terrific combination.
I:8652;297;hooper who although rich ,really did love and was dedidacted to his work.
I:8652;298;while on the Mayor he plays a very good part as a stubborn son of a a bitch.
I:8652;299;he is very intimidating and has a strong presence around the room in the the very first scene we see him and ihe Indianapolis classic scene.
I:8652;300;i recommend you see that documentary if you are an avid Jaws fan.
I:8652;301;thats about it ive spoken my mind in the last half hour and i hope you enjoyed my review.
I:8652;302;thank you for making the film, Jaws Mr Spielberg is the best piece of work you have ever done.
I:8652;303;in fact its just the best piece of work.
I:8652;304;A must see on the hottest day of summer.
I:8652;305;Spielberg took a simple story and stretched it to limitless proportions and along the way created one of the highest grossing films of all time.
I:8652;306;Along with 'Casablanca' this is one of cinema's greatest 'happy accidents'.
I:8652;307;But still he managed to create one of the most shockingly suspenseful films of all time using the Hitchcock method 'less is more'.
I:8652;308;The story is simple, a huge 'great white' terrorizing the small summer island resort of Amity.
I:8652;309;Scheider and Dreyfuss are both excellent in their roles but Robert Shaw is unforgettable as the eccentric Quint, a Captain Ahab for the cynical 70's.
I:8652;310;But still the best and most suspense.
I:8652;311;filled moments of the film are the shark.
I:8652;312;biting suspense is given an adventurous air thanks to John William's brilliant score.
I:8652;313;A technical marvel with brilliant editing and cinematography.
I:8652;314;John William's score became one of the most famous of all time, simple but extremely efficient, it also informs us of the shark's presence.
I:8652;315;pleasing machine that also happens to be one of the best movies of all time.
I:8652;316;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film a 10!
I:8652;317;great actors, great location, great story line .
I:8652;318;Love the Jaws movies, they are second best to the Jurassic Park movies.
I:8652;319;Best movie made UNTIL Jurassic came alone.
I:8652;320;i mean come on, with all the technology out there to fake the moon landing, this is the best you can do????
I:8652;321;otherwise it was good and worth saving what local retailers charge.
I:8652;322;Some of the things they had to do to make this movie seem as real as possible will truly amaze you.
I:8652;323;Well, it's a classic and it still scares the.
I:8652;324;Steven Spielberg's second feature film (and one of his most challenging projects), Jaws was THE blockbuster event of 1975.
I:8652;325;Based on Peter Benchley's novel, this very effective thriller set box office records higher than any previous film.
I:8652;326;What he deduces is chilling: the deadly creature prowling out to sea is a great white shark.
I:8652;327;jaws is one of those rare movie adaptations that is better than its source novel.
I:8652;328;The screenplay is crisp and taut, yet with enough light moments and scenes of sometimes wry humor that ease the ever increasing tension, particular when Brody, Hooper and Quint set out to hunt the great white shark.
I:8652;329;becoming the hunted in the process.
I:8652;330;Jaws also put composer John Williams on the map with movie audiences with his now.
I:8652;331;The documentary on the making of the film is also first.
I:8652;332;get for Spielberg (and action film) fans.
I:8652;333;I have watched the VHS version many times and always marvel at how poorly a really good picture can be transferred to tape.
I:8652;334;"This is the movie that really reminds me of high school
I:8652;335;"Jaws was the ""Psycho"" of my generation."
I:8652;336;Jaws was also Steven Spielberg's first (and I think best) blockbuster.
I:8652;337;It could only help boost the careers of the 3 lead male actors in the film: Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss (this was the role that made Dreyfuss a star).
I:8652;338;It spawned one of the most classic and oft.
I:8652;339;It was also technically a very innovative film, with a mechanical shark that by all accounts was a great deal of trouble.
I:8652;340;But I recently got the 30th Anniversary Edition, and saw it again last night, in the dark, in widescreen, through the stereo (gone is the full.
I:8652;341;"the ultimate, and best, of the ""Scary Summer Movie"" genre."
I:8652;342;available interview with Spielberg, archives, and a two.
I:8652;343;"The deleted scenes and outtakes are a riot
I:8652;344;winning film editing, sound, and a now.
I:8652;345;classic score by maestro John Williams.
I:8652;346;In keeping the Great White offscreen, Spielberg was employing a strategy used by Alfred Hitchcock throughout his career.
I:8652;347;Simply one of the best movie ever made!
I:8652;348;I picked it up and thought it might be interesting, so I bought it.
I:8652;349;I had read the book and I knew the movie wouldn't be as good as the book.
I:8652;350;the movie was better than the book!
I:8652;351;Such an ending in the book was believable, but not very exciting.
I:8652;352;By all accounts, the monumental success of George Lucas' Star Wars was the father of the modern blockbuster.
I:8652;353;But when you consider that an adult ticket was less than three bucks at the time, that makes it a bit more impressive.
I:8652;354;this movie broke all previous box office records, and it held those records for two years until audiences were swept into that galaxy far, far away.
I:8652;355;I remember the absolute mania surrounding this Spielberg classic.
I:8652;356;This brings Brody, Hooper, and Quint together for the greatest water adventure filmed to that point.
I:8652;357;JAWS is a genuine masterpiece of suspense and horror.
I:8652;358;The movie studios really love to stick it to you.
I:8652;359;well what do we call them?
I:8652;360;As long as the studio execs can turn a dime this won't be the last re release of jaws I guarantee it!
I:8652;361;He had never seen it and loved the movie.
I:8652;362;What happens during the course of that hunt is going to surprise you.
I:8652;363;based on the novel by Peter Benchley, Jaws was directed by Stephen Spielberg(as you all know) and, after viewing the movie, I believe it is one of Spielberg's biggest achievements in filmmaking.
I:8652;364;The movie itself was well.
I:8652;365;It was the highest grossing film of its' time, in 1975.
I:8652;366;honestly, I've always been more interested in Spielberg's Science.
I:8652;367;Jaws is a great movie and one that should be viewed by everyone at some point.
I:8652;368;It truly is worthy of its' accolades.
I:8652;369;Great classic film in spite of the sometimes hokie special effects.
I:8652;370;I lived on the water on the east coast when this was released and it made a big impression on visiting tourists.
I:8652;371;If you haven't read Close To Shore, I recommend it.
I:8652;372;good job Universal, I take back all those bad things I thought about you when you were trying to force me into Ultraviolet digital copies.
I:8652;373;So have plenty of kleenex on hand.
I:8652;374;I am familiar with this movie when it first came out many years ago and now I have a 8yr grandson who loves sharks.
I:8652;375;But the extra features, of this edition,provide an in.
I:8652;376;depth discussion of the making of this film.
I:8652;377;They interviewed the actors and got their perspective.
I:8652;378;It shows how and where the film was shot I learned a lot about how films were made.
I:8652;379;"The ""Original Summer Blockbuster"" should be part of everyone's movie inventory."
I:8652;380;this monster rogue great white shark terrorizes and feeds on the town's beachgoers and boaters.Ya just have to see this if you haven't already.
I:8652;381;Roy Scheider does a great job as the leading actor of this film.
I:8652;382;An excellent ( Speilberg type ) twist.
I:8652;383;This is scary, but good.
I:8652;384;One of the classic shark movies.
I:8652;385;Must see for anybody who has not watched it.
I:8652;386;Good for a teenager movie night as well.
I:8652;387;"When director Steven Spielberg set out to create the motion picture ""Jaws"", he had no idea how much trouble the film would cause him nor just how incredible, exciting, and important it would eventually become."
I:8652;388;"eating Great White shark enters the town's beaches, it is up to the town sherriff (Roy Scheider in perhaps his best performance outside of ""The French Connection""), a geeky graduate scientist (the always admirable Richard Dreyfuss), and the town fish gamer (played by Robert Shaw, the film's best performance by far) to save the day."
I:8652;389;"What makes ""Jaws"" so great is not just the fine soundtrack by John Williams, the special effects and the lovable shark machine ""Bruce"", but the fact that it allows the childish fears in all of us to creep up on us and still make the hair on our necks tingle."
I:8652;390;"spielberg would later create even more popular and elaborate masterpieces such as ""E. t"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", but for those who truly enjoy film and its impact on an audience, ""Jaws"" can certainly bite with the best of them."
I:8652;391;In the small town I lived in when Jaws came out the line to get into the drive.
I:8652;392;It was worth the wait.
I:8652;393;I have watched this movie many times since and I enjoyed it every time.
I:8652;394;The acting was phenomenal and the Bruce was a BIG Shark!!
I:8652;395;And you'd definitely need a bigger Boat!!
I:8652;396;Jaws has always been and will always be my all time favorite movie.
I:8652;397;And the 25th Anniversary Edition is brilliant!
I:8652;398;done sound effects and 75 minutes of bonus footage are great!
I:8652;399;If you haven't seen Jaws, see it.
I:8652;400;Shaw, Dreyfuss, and Schieder are perfect(it is these scenes with the three of them on the ORCA that are best).
I:8652;401;Everything about this movie is perfect, 1975!
I:8652;402;its still down there and it can kill, and your swimming above, hows that for a scary idea, well thats what brilliant upon brilliant Peter Benchly created up there in his old noggin of a brain that sared the heck out of thousands of people across America.
I:8652;403;Bringing Steven Spieldberg to this review is wise, after finishing Duel, he came to this after reading the novel by Peter Benchly, they decide to make the movie, Peter Benchly with the screenplay, Robert Shaw makes the part on the spot, Richard Dreyfuss who implied to have the part of Hooper that was originally given to someone else, got the part, and after thinking about it Roy Shcieder took the part of the Sea struck Rode Island Police Chief.
I:8652;404;These guys were remarkable in this film, they were too real asuming the coincidence of this happenening never, they were also extremly funny especially Drefuss and Shaw's little quarries.
I:8652;405;The acting, directing, shots etc.
I:8652;406;New documentary the shark is working is a great addition.
I:8652;407;This movie is slick, and it actually offered a few surprises, including several hugely entertaining performances.
I:8652;408;Yeah, the ending is kind of ridiculous, but Spielberg manages to craft a terrific ride along the way.
I:8652;409;if this movie truly marked the beginning of the rise of Hollywood's blockbuster mentality, then it at least began that hike with a tight, well.
I:8652;410;Jaws is Spielberg's most influential movie, and if haven't seen it yet, you should, as its cultural impact is incredible.
I:8652;411;'Jaws', directed by Steven Spielberg was released in '75 and still stands as one of the biggest box office money makers of all.
I:8652;412;The real strength of this film lies in the teaming together Richard Dryfuss, Roy Scheider and the ever elusive Rober Shaw as the three valiant souls willing to way anchor and search for the great white killer shark terrorizing the little seaside resort community of Amity.
I:8652;413;Watching their transformation from initial hostilities slowly evole into deep mutual respect is the best part of the film.
I:8652;414;Their constant banter is hilarious, insightful and packed with great quotable dialogue.
I:8652;415;if you don't like scary films just pretend the shark isn't there and watch for the great acting!Also a wonderful performance by Murray Hamiliton as Amity's Mayor.
I:8652;416;I think pretty much everybody can agree that this movie started the whole Blockbuster thing and also the big monster genre in general.
I:8652;417;After 25 years it is still a chillingly good piece of work.
I:8652;418;Even the shark looks surprissinly good for its age.
I:8652;419;When Jaws showed on tv a while ago I wasnt that excited.
I:8652;420;I thought maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it.
I:8652;421;Without flashy special effects but with a little something called tension and suspense.
I:8652;422;The picture is very clear for its age and the colors are bright.
I:8652;423;Its got several trailers which are interesting to see since they are after all 25 years old.
I:8652;424;Also included is a interesting documentary which shows how they got the shark to work.
I:8652;425;This movie is full of suspence and action.
I:8652;426;Steven Sbielberg is a director who will bring terror with action and adventure anytime, like JAWS.
I:8652;427;I loved this film and so will you!This is a great film to watch at sleepovers!
I:8652;428;For the price, this is an outstanding edition to my collection.
I:8652;429;Excellent picture along with 7.1 DTS Surround.
I:8652;430;The audio was phenomenal on my audio system and the picture was vibrant.
I:8652;431;Along with this you get a 42 page book with color pictures.
I:8652;432;Highly recommended since it is about 10.12 dollars cheaper than the previous release.
I:8652;433;Still not happy about getting in the water!
I:8652;434;Jaws was the movie that made Speilberg a great hit.
I:8652;435;The suspence, fear, and brilliance it provided made everyone love it.
I:8652;436;the beginning of the movie was realistic.
I:8652;437;She was eaten, and was perfectly clear to be eaten.
I:8652;438;The panicking while attacked was realistic.
I:8652;439;The next scene, he was moving it fine.
I:8652;440;Jaws did a good job with suspence and action, but realism lacked, causing its ratings to drop in my eyes.
I:8652;441;Steven Spielberg's breakout film, Jaws is the quintessential summer blockbuster, creating all the horror, thrills, suspense, and special effects you would expect from such a film.
I:8652;442;Based on the true story of a great white shark which terrorized the shores of New Jersey in the summer of 1916, Jaws is an ingenious adaptation of Peter Benchley's best.
I:8652;443;selling novel inspired by the incident.
I:8652;444;Jaws tells the story of man's eternal struggle against nature, a story so compelling it captures the imagination of every generation who hears it .
I:8652;445;with brilliant direction and state.
I:8652;446;art special effects (satisfactory even by today's standards), Jaws is a true edge.
I:8652;447;seat thriller wrought with suspense.
I:8652;448;The unknown is masterfully woven throughout the movie with a crescendo effect that keeps the audience guessing until the end.
I:8652;449;This approach effectively combines fear of the unknown with the already present fear of the shark to create a chilling atmosphere for movie goers.
I:8652;450;Like a fine murder novel, the scenes draw the audience into the setting, forcing you to identify with the characters.
I:8652;451;And any movie that can have that type of effect must be good!
I:8652;452;True cinematic magic from beginning to end.
I:8652;453;Iconic to say the least!
I:8652;454;When director Steven Spielberg set out to create the motion picture Jaws , he had no idea how much trouble the film would cause him nor just how incredible, exciting, and important it would eventually become.
I:8652;455;eating Great White shark enters the town's beaches, it is up to the town sherriff (Roy Scheider in perhaps his best performance outside of The French Connection ), a geeky graduate scientist (the always admirable Richard Dreyfuss), and the town fish gamer (played by Robert Shaw, the film's best performance by far) to save the day.
I:8652;456;What makes Jaws so great is not just the fine soundtrack by John Williams, the special effects and the lovable shark machine Bruce , but the fact that it allows the childish fears in all of us to creep up on us and still make the hair on our necks tingle.
I:8652;457;spielberg would later create even more popular and elaborate masterpieces such as E. t and Saving Private Ryan , but for those who truly enjoy film and its impact on an audience, Jaws can certainly bite with the best of them.
I:8652;458;JAWS is one of the few horror movies that exemplifies filmmaking at its best.
I:8652;459;Spielberg's direction can't be beat (even if the limited use of the shark was unintentional).
I:8652;460;Underscoring all of this is the suspenful and mesmerizing theme by composer John Williams.
I:8652;461;For being an older movie, it still makes me jump, still has good special effects!!!!
I:8652;462;This special feature does'nt go into that part of theproduction but I'm glad I knew the true story.
I:8652;463;recommend the movie and this product very highly.
I:8652;464;If you like this movie you will love the blu.
I:8652;465;The pictures are so real.
I:8652;466;The special features are fun to see.
I:8652;467;I watched it with him and found myself on the edge of my seat like I'd never seen it before.
I:8652;468;The special effects are just as effective as in some of the new computer generated movies.
I:8652;469;This is definitely one of my top 10 favorite movies.
I:8652;470;Still, this is a great movie.
I:8652;471;Good acting for its time, good suspense, good plot, good evrything.
I:8652;472;This movie was great on the big screen when it was released back in 1975.
I:8652;473;and it's even better now that we have our very own big screen at home!I love the Amazon Instant Video, so now we can watch it from anywhere .
I:8652;474;It's a super movie, mind you, and I can easily sit through it (and often do), but I can't bear to go to the ocean.
I:8652;475;Not only does it included the feature film, but the special features really are cool.
I:8652;476;"Sure, it's entertaining enough, but in a more ""shark in the water!"""
I:8652;477;One of our favorite movies of all time, it is what it is, you have to love it.
I:8652;478;ray, it was worth the wait.
I:8652;479;I watch Jaws every few years, to me it's something of a classic.
I:8652;480;I recommend to all who have not seen it to check it out.
I:8652;481;In 1975, Steven Spielberg had taken Peter Benchley's novel entitled, JAWS, and made it the one motion picture that will continue to be one of the best films in all of Horror/Suspense history.
I:8652;482;the residents of AMITY ISLAND, NEW YORK are quite happy.
I:8652;483;They live on an island complete with a beautiful beach.
I:8652;484;Some of the young residents have a party on the beach.
I:8652;485;mARTIN BRODY (played by Roy Scheider), Amity Island's chief of police resides, obviously, in Amity Island with his beautiful wife, ELLEN BRODY (played by Lorraine Gary) and his two sons, MICHAEL (played by Chris Rebello) and SEAN (played by Jay Mello), where a few months ago, they had moved to Amity Island from New York City.
I:8652;486;He wakes up the next morning and gets a call about Chrissy's murder.
I:8652;487;He calls shark expert MATT HOOPER (played by Richard Dreyfuess).
I:8652;488;The two team up and find a way to put to end it.
I:8652;489;By the next morning, the three continue on with their job.
I:8652;490;He grabs one of Hooper's air tanks and throws into the shark's mouth.
I:8652;491;Afterwards, Hooper arises from the water, still alive and unharmed.
I:8652;492;I mostly watch it during the summer when in Florida for two weeks.
I:8652;493;Everybody should have seen and own this film.
I:8652;494;This movie looks looks great and still is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8652;495;Give us a choice of how to download the digital copy we paid for.
I:8652;496;To me it is nearly perfect, a well crafted monster movie that seems to effortlessly invoke a sense of phobic terror whenever anyone gets anywhere near, much less in, the water.
I:8652;497;A happy accident that only served to increase the film's already considerable power.
I:8652;498;An essential action/monster movie for any film buff's library.
I:8652;499;the disc is nearly as good as the movie.
I:8652;500;I love Steven Spielberg's JAWS which is based on the novel by Peter Benchley.
I:8652;501;I was originally gong to get the 25th Anniversary edition but, when I saw the 30th Anniversary edition I bought that instead because it looked very promising and a good place to start JAWS.
I:8652;502;I like movies that are based on good books.
I:8652;503;I also recommend that you see the sequel JAWS 2 next, because it is very good too.
I:8652;504;"I thought the film ""JAWS"" was very good."
I:8652;505;it wasn't the best best in the entire series I thought this was the 2nd best behind JAWS 2!
I:8652;506;but this one was actually really good.
I:8652;507;they are great movies that will keep you out of the water.
I:8652;508;For film class my daughter is watching this movie.
I:8652;509;This movie is a great movie and at the time really showed us what a great director Steven Spielberg would become.
I:8652;510;This is such a nice movie!
I:8652;511;I wanted it in my collection and this movie fit the bill!
I:8652;512;I was received brand new and the product and price was exception!
I:8652;513;I love this movie and will view it over and over, its a must have classic!!
I:8652;514;Acting was great, scenery great, music great.
I:8652;515;It was that believable and that damn good.
I:8652;516;Jaws holds up very well, indeed, after 40 years.
I:8652;517;As a teenager, I saw it in the theatre three times.
I:8652;518;This was Steven Spielberg's breakthrough mega.
I:8652;519;He knows how to go for what is primal, then pace it just right.
I:8652;520;Universal did an amazing job and even provided a featurette highlighting the process.
I:8652;521;Steven should have walked away with the Oscar for this one!
I:8652;522;I found a book that told the true story and found it facinating.
I:8652;523;I've watched all the Jaws movies but really like the first one the best.
I:8652;524;The cast is the best and the first movie set the bar that has not been reached in any shark movie since.
I:8652;525;Terrific adaptation of Peter Benchley's novel has a great white shark picking off swimmers off Martha's Vineyard.
I:8652;526;Spielberg delivers some terrific suspense scenes but wisely never goes over the edge.
I:8652;527;The 25th Anniversary edition includes a well done documentary with interviews with Steven Spielberg, Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Lorraine Gary, and producers and crew members.
I:8652;528;Great bang for your buck here.
I:8652;529;This movie is great and looks fantastic on blurry.
I:8652;530;The best part of this classic brought back to life was the behind the scenes interview with Steven Spielberg.
I:8652;531;It offered really good insight on the film, and how it came to be one of the better horror/adventure movies of the 70's.
I:8652;532;It goes to show why Spielberg is one of the best directors of all time.
I:8652;533;Everyone knows that Jaws is a classic.
I:8652;534;It's gives everyone what they could possibly want.
I:8652;535;Lastly, the Blu Ray transfer is really good.
I:8652;536;This show is such a classic!
I:8652;537;We were able to watch it with the kids.
I:8652;538;Excellent movie that still keeps me out of the ocean.
I:8652;539;Steven Speilberg knows how to make tension build.
I:8652;540;"Great film, excellent ""Anniversary Edition""."
I:8652;541;It was so nice to introduce her to the classics.
I:8652;542;"Great characters
I:8652;543;"Jaws never gets old for me
I:8652;544;Spielberg is one of the great directors of his generation.
I:8652;545;The special effects were cutting edge at the time.
I:8652;546;Great movie to watch around Halloween time as well.
I:8652;547;First time it came out at theater, I sat on front row.
I:8652;548;It's still terrifying to me today, but I still watch it over and over.
I:8652;549;Still one of the best action and suspense movies starring Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and JAWS, a big shark.
I:8652;550;A timeless, classic movie directed by Steven Spielberg.
I:8652;551;Great script,acting drama suspense COMEDY!
I:8652;552;And ofcourse good all fashion HORROR!
I:8652;553;Not only is it a great Spielberg film, but it's a great adventure film period.
I:8652;554;But audiences got freaked then went back and it's the first film ever to surpass the 100 million mark.
I:8652;555;quoted lines, memorable images and performances and really good pacing makes this not only a Spielberg classic but a classic in general.
I:8652;556;One of the great movies of the 70's and when the hell is Close Encounters coming out?
I:8652;557;I was able to see this movie last night in an old theater (it helped that it was right by the beach) and invited a large group of people to go.
I:8652;558;conscious era ever), Jaws remains a timeless seafaring adventure that holds up well three decades later.
I:8652;559;And by the way, I give the movie itself 5 stars for sure!
I:8652;560;This classic movie made the blu.
I:8652;561;ray conversion with outstanding results.
I:8652;562;"All I really wanted was the movie, but this is a treat for any fan of ""Jaws""."
I:8652;563;The extras (documentary,makeing of, etc) are great.
I:8652;564;A must for old fans and new fans alike.
I:8652;565;The film's brilliant exploitation (or exploration, depending on how you look at it) of our primal fears of drowning and of being eaten alive by a natural predator is still stunningly effective.
I:8652;566;generated Imagery), the film remains a chilling and exhilarating adventure/thriller.
I:8652;567;the film features a superb cast including Roy Scheider as the neurotic Police Chief, Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as the charmingly sarcastic Hooper, Robert Shaw as the stubborn Quint, Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife, Ellen, and Murray Hamilton as the persistently unwise Mayor Vaughn.
I:8652;568;The entire cast gives multi.
I:8652;569;faceted performances and Robert Shaw, in particular, is wonderful as the salty, cynical, and fiercely competitive Quint.
I:8652;570;without minimalizing the talents of the fantastic cast, the film's greatest stars are those behind the camera.
I:8652;571;Steven Spielberg was aided by special effects expert Robert A. Mattey, experienced shark photographers Ron and Valerie Taylor, production designer Joe Alves, and director of photography Bill Butler.
I:8652;572;As far as adaptations go, it's unusual for a film's screenplay to live up to the expectations of the fans of the source material.
I:8652;573;The film, in many ways, is superior to the novel, which at times drifts into the realm of pretentious melodrama.
I:8652;574;jaws was also given a tremendous boost by renowned film composer, John William's brilliant score, which has become instantly recognizable.
I:8652;575;the original Jaws film was so successful that it spawned three sequels: the adequateJaws 2, the regrettableJaws 3, and the abysmalJaws: The Revenge.
I:8652;576;also recommended:Close Encounters of the Third KindIndiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost ArkE.
I:8652;577;We got this for my daughters sleepover shark party and we all loved it!
I:8652;578;At its heart, Jaws is simply a monster movie.
I:8652;579;but it's a monster movie with depth, humor, and skillful direction.
I:8652;580;The performances are flawless, and the special effects are (for the time) quite good.
I:8652;581;The shark in this film is a malevolent force of nature, preying on a small seaside town.
I:8652;582;The suspense is really what makes this so great.
I:8652;583;"Like Hitchcock and ""Psycho,"" it certainly was his most shocking and scariest film."
I:8652;584;Few people knew what a Great White Shark looked like, but they have ever since this film came out!No, it doesn't hold the terror it did when released about 30 years ago, but it is still scary, still entertaining and moves at a fast pace.
I:8652;585;The music has held up even better than the special.
I:8652;586;One of the greatest movies of all time obviously, and it is tied for my all time favorite.
I:8652;587;Jaws is a very simple film, without the convoluted side.
I:8652;588;The film works wonderfully, and is filled with great performances, great filming, and sure direction from Steven Spielberg.
I:8652;589;The filming and effects are superb, even by today's standards.
I:8652;590;In fact, the film benefits from this method because by the time you actually see the shark, you are so immersed in the story that you don't notice the effect.
I:8652;591;the human performances are consistently good.
I:8652;592;The trio at the heart of the action are well cast and have great on.
I:8652;593;The supporting actors are also good.
I:8652;594;The photography, much of it on the sea, gives a feeling of menace (beneath the waves) and isolation (one ship on the vast ocean).
I:8652;595;winning soundtrack is a masterpiece of mood.
I:8652;596;The picture and sound are as good as expected.
I:8652;597;long documentary on the making of Jaws that is fun and informative.
I:8652;598;A film with as storied a history as this surely deserves a commentary from Spielberg and/or the producers.
I:8652;599;I remember when I first saw Jaws and what an exciting experience it was.
I:8652;600;What had dimmed after all these years was the wonderful first half of the movie on Amity Island.
I:8652;601;Seeing the family sequences again, and the struggle that the Islanders had in coming to terms with the reality of this predatory shark and what it meant to their financial survival is really quite touching and painful.
I:8652;602;Implying the shark is supremely effective.
I:8652;603;Lorraine Gary adds a wonderful reality to Brody family trying to fit in as newcomers to Amity Island trying to fit in.
I:8652;604;be fishermen are wonderful splashes of color on the film canvas and add humor to relieve tension and set up the second half confrontation so well.
I:8652;605;this is a superior film that has been imitated so often that we forget how good the original actually is.
I:8652;606;This is a good disk with a good copy of the film and extras that help us appreciate how the film came to be.
I:8652;607;This is by far my favorite movie of all time.
I:8652;608;Spielberg did a fantastic job bringing the book to life.
I:8652;609;In many ways it's superior to the book (Spielberg removed a lot of the rough language and the sexual stuff that is found in the book) The acting in this film is excelent.
I:8652;610;Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw are all very believable.
I:8652;611;You can feel their fear, excitement, and anger.
I:8652;612;Steven Spielberg's groundbreaking blockbuster about a killer great white shark loose on the beaches of a small summer tourist community is still one of the most terrifying experiences in cinema.
I:8652;613;knuckle thriller has kept beach.
I:8652;614;violet and One for iTunes which is really nice.
I:8652;615;I love the cover art, and the inside cover art is great too.
I:8652;616;Many people have jaws in their top five.
I:8652;617;I have never liked this film though it is in my legendary 5 year golden age of horror filmmaking.
I:8652;618;i will be the first to admit that Jaws is well shot, well acted, and well written.
I:8652;619;But it is something even deeper that espouses fear during the viewing of this film.
I:8652;620;THAT is the beauty of JAWS.
I:8652;621;It feeds off that universal 'Jonah and the whale' fear that all human beings have experienced at one time of another.
I:8652;622;Except now the whale is a giantic great white shark with rows of razor sharp teeth.
I:8652;623;I simply do not enjoy watching it, though I appreciate what a well made film it is.
I:8652;624;Great movie now on Blu.
I:8652;625;I still think this is the scariest movie of all time.
I:8652;626;The Deleted scenes, the outakes, and of course the making of documentary.
I:8652;627;It is really cool to see how they made this film.
I:8652;628;If you enjoy classics you should definitely look at this one.
I:8652;629;I guess most people like it because it has a lot of names involved with it.
I:8652;630;There are far better movies as far as I am concerned.
I:8652;631;jAWS is one of my least favorite films, never liked it even as a kid.
I:8652;632;So in order to be able to cram the entire movie, trailers and the documentary onto one single disc, the phenomenal 2.
I:8652;633;Luckily, I still have my original laserdisc set and can see this documentary in all of its nostalgic glory.
I:8652;634;four stars for the film masterpiece, zero stars for the extras.
I:8652;635;Universal, please give us fans what we want!
I:8652;636;Restore your original grand homage to one of the great contemporary cinematic classics!
I:8652;637;Jaws has something for everyone.
I:8652;638;"It has a bit of the classic Hitchcock suspense films like ""Psycho"" and ""The Birds."""
I:8652;639;the casting and character development in the movie are excellent.
I:8652;640;Dreyfuss and Scheider also create characters with nuanced depth.
I:8652;641;The deleted scenes are worth watching, though appropriately deleted from the final version.
I:8652;642;The trivia game is nice once through.
I:8652;643;jaws was one of those movies that was an instant hit and continues to impress.
I:8652;644;and with good reason: it's simply an excellent movie.
I:8652;645;The dominance of the Hollywood summer blockbuster can be attributed (or blamed depending on how you feel about them) to two filmmakers: Steven Spielberg with Jaws and George Lucas with Star Wars.
I:8652;646;But Spielberg was there first with Jaws, an exciting adventure film about a great white shark terrorizing a small, seaside town that scared the crap out of millions of people the year it came out.
I:8652;647;jaws holds up today because it is an adventure film that doesn't rely solely on exciting action sequences.
I:8652;648;Its foundation is a strong story and engaging characters with memorable dialogue (most notably the famous monologue that Quint delivers with chilling intensity).
I:8652;649;Spielberg and co. essentially created a contemporary monster movie that works so well because it plays on a primary fear of being in the water and not having control of one's environment (i. e. drowning).
I:8652;650;Gone from the previous version is the trivia game, the Shark World documentary, the trailers and the screen saver so completists might want to hold on to their old discs.
I:8652;651;A British film crew follows a young Spielberg around and interviews him, providing an interesting snapshot of the then up.
I:8652;652;This is a fascinating, in.
I:8652;653;depth look at how Jaws came together, the challenges that a young Spielberg faced and the eventual phenomenon that developed as the film thrilled audiences all over the world.
I:8652;654;finally, there is an attractive 60.
I:8652;655;I love the original movie trailers.
I:8652;656;I remember seeing these in a theatre back in the 70s.
I:8652;657;I remember how much everyone anticipated Jaws after seeing these.
I:8652;658;it tells about the acting history of Roy Schieder, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss.
I:8652;659;It is also in real widescreen.
I:8652;660;It's a matter of personal choice.
I:8652;661;Since then I've seen this classic countless times and I enjoy it every time.
I:8652;662;There's just something about the atmosphere in the film that I find infectious.
I:8652;663;The casting is the most natural I've seen.
I:8652;664;I've yet to see interaction like this between 3 actors.
I:8652;665;The love\hate atmosphere on the boat is just gripping.
I:8652;666;I thought the original effect added much more to the atmosphere of the film.
I:8652;667;But it is cool to see it digitally touched up.
I:8652;668;Space Odyssey 2001 springs to mind but even that masterpiece borrows from the classical world.
I:8652;669;I loved the book too, but I have to say the movie is better.
I:8652;670;I know it's strange but it's true.
I:8652;671;Jaws is King and very underrated in my opinion.
I:8652;672;Come the next day when Brody is summoned to the beach you see Amity Island shine with glourious color and detail!
I:8652;673;The soundtrack is one of my favorites of all time!
I:8652;674;"You can never replicate the ""Hitchcockian"" vibes that ran beautifully through the film, instead you would get a gore fest in tune with films that are being offered now like Shark Night."
I:8652;675;It really blew my mind!
I:8652;676;A movie that still holds its own today and will withstand the test of time, Jaws will always have a special place in my life.
I:8652;677;It both created great fascination and terrorized me at the same time!
I:8652;678;It will definitely make its way into my top 5 of 2012.
I:8652;679;Great for a rainy/snowy night.
I:8652;680;This is truly one of my favorite movies and when I saw it on television with the never before scenes, I couldnt wait to get that version on video.
I:8652;681;It is one of my favorite movies of all time and I would recommend it to every one I know
I:8652;682;One of the greatest movies of all time and the best horror/suspense of all time.
I:8652;683;People quibble about why it was so successful, but I tell you, it is just a brilliant film.
I:8652;684;The best of the best of it's genre.
I:8652;685;The great thing about this film is the way Speilberg directed it, keeping us glued in suspence, never showing us the shark really until the very end.
I:8652;686;Just hearing that alone makes my skin crawl.
I:8652;687;Up until that point you see a fin and blood.
I:8652;688;The reactions of the town folk, espiecially the mayor, is also pretty accurate.
I:8652;689;the final frames of the film are chilling.
I:8652;690;All involved give great performances, from shark hunter Quint (Shaw) who offers to take Hooper and Brody out to find the shark.
I:8652;691;to Brody's wife Ellen (Gary) the entire cast is brilliant.
I:8652;692;it really does stand alone as one of the scariest and smartest films to date!
I:8652;693;The special features are fantastic.
I:8652;694;one of the best films ever made.
I:8652;695;My mom loves this movie.
I:8652;696;Here is Steven Spielberg's best film, not surprising since it is also one of his earliest, a movie that reflects not only commercial savvy but artistic passion and a true love for the moviemaking process.
I:8652;697;This is Spielberg displaying as much virtuosity as Quentin Tarantino would later show in Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill.
I:8652;698;Jaws is quite simply one of my favorite films, probably among the top 5.
I:8652;699;"Spielberg's direction has done more than withstand the test of time
I:8652;700;talented studio hacks like Stephen Sommers, Michael Bay, et al.
I:8652;701;the characters, and the actors who play them, are the real magic of Jaws.
I:8652;702;The shark is a wonderful special effect, to be sure, one of the most effective movie villains ever, but Brody, Quint and Hooper are the real stars.
I:8652;703;Spielberg had a lot of faith in the ability of his actors to compete with the special effects, a faith he does not display today ( A. i., anyone?)
I:8652;704;This is just one reason why Jaws continues to work so well after 30 years.
I:8652;705;a masterpiece of blood and guts (Quint's death scene is still hard to watch), Jaws is also underrated as a character piece.
I:8652;706;What a great movie this is.
I:8652;707;So says Quint near the climax of Jaws, the first summer blockbuster and one of the greatest, most exciting movies ever made.
I:8652;708;Face it, few other movies can match the intensity of the narrative, or the credibility of the characters.
I:8652;709;The shark, when it is finally seen, looks rather fake, but the characters seem real and that is what sells this movie and makes it surpass the likes of Armageddon.
I:8652;710;but still, it's Jaws, the most exciting movie released this year (excepting North.
I:8652;711;And a quintessential popcorn muncher.
I:8652;712;See it before you go into the water.
I:8652;713;I am super happy to be able to watch this movie anywhere and anytime
I:8652;714;It's still among our favorite thrillers and we're very pleased to have it available to view again.
I:8652;715;It's just as fun watching all the speacial features, too.
I:8652;716;One of the most influential movies of all time is finally on Blu.
I:8652;717;The timeless film has been restored from the original prints for perfect picture and sound under the supervision of director Steven Spielberg.
I:8652;718;Comes with a great selection of extras including The Making of Jaws, and the highly anticipated The Shark Is Still Working.
I:8652;719;This movie, with its soundtrack, caused an entire nation to be scared to go into the water.
I:8652;720;Near perfect picture and sound.
I:8652;721;and always swim with a buddy.
I:8652;722;John Williams' theme to Jaws is immediately recognizable on both an intellectual and emotional level, whether you've seen the movie or not.
I:8652;723;this movie works on so many levels.
I:8652;724;When a young lady is killed in the movie's memorable opening scene, pretty obviously by a shark, he allows himself to be dissuaded from closing the beaches by a slimy mayor who cares more for the holiday tourist season than the lives of the men, women, and children vacationing there.
I:8652;725;This first real look at the mammoth twenty.
I:8652;726;"six footer is brilliantly shot
I:8652;727;up a memorable surprise to the audience and, most especially, Brody.
I:8652;728;The hunters soon become the hunted, leading to an increasingly suspenseful, riveting conclusion.
I:8652;729;The shark is nature's perfect killing machine, perhaps the most magnificent and certainly the most efficient animal on this planet.
I:8652;730;This particular shark is as smart as he is huge, making him the most formidable of opponents for the Ahab.
I:8652;731;Certainly, such a rogue killer has to be either starved out or killed in the interest of human life, but I mourn the eventual defeat of this magnificent animal.
I:8652;732;"Spielberg shows his genius early on in his directing career by holding back our first look at the shark for so long
I:8652;733;"One of the most compelling scenes of the film, however, does not involve the shark at all
I:8652;734;The main attraction, though, is the feature Spotlight on Location: The Making of Jaws, which delivers incredible insight on the making of the film.
I:8652;735;After watching these interviews with important cast and crew members and behind.
I:8652;736;scenes looks at the grueling, exceedingly challenging making of the film, this viewer's respect for the cinematic wonder that was created here grew by leaps and bounds.
I:8652;737;A Great movie and still gives me the chills.
I:8652;738;The blacks are deep and solid and the colors are vibrant and jump off the screen.
I:8652;739;It's amazing the work they put into this film to clean it up from the 1970's print.
I:8652;740;the regular sound is good enough.
I:8652;741;The scenes on the ocean sound fantastic, and the dum.
I:8652;742;scenes stuff is alot of fun and even the deleted scenes are a nice touch.
I:8652;743;The trivia game is short, but good for a few laughs.
I:8652;744;One of Steven Spielberg's earliest films and his first true masterpiece from a directing standpoint and a box office success, this movie is rare masterpiece.
I:8652;745;The local sheriff (Roy Scheider) works with a local fisherman (Robert Shaw) and a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) to go after the shark who has fatally attacked several people, and the rest is history.
I:8652;746;you would get it because its a timeless classic, Spielbergs best monster movie if you ask me.
I:8652;747;i would love to hear wat the great man steven spielberg has to say bout it.
I:8652;748;i have watched the movie and was totally involved immersed and entertained by the movie as i was when i saw it for the first time.
I:8652;749;this is a great blueray transfer of this movie.
I:8652;750;audio and picture are great.5 star in my opinion.
I:8652;751;Hey guys, Here is a young Spielberg here directing Roy Schider.
I:8652;752;Spielberg directs a great film that was nominated for best picture but lost.
I:8652;753;A great job by all who are part of this mega hit!
I:8652;754;From the first killing to John Williams' fantastic theme, there has yet to be a shark movie that combines suspense, action and drama.
I:8652;755;Anyway, enough prattling on how good suspense should be done.
I:8652;756;Roy Schieder gives a great performance as Chief Brody.
I:8652;757;He's an average person thrust into this extraordinary situation.
I:8652;758;And Richard Dreyfuss is down to Earth and believable as Hooper.
I:8652;759;All three actors have great chemistry together when they're on the boat.
I:8652;760;That famous line, uttered by a near.
I:8652;761;When I did see it in a re.
I:8652;762;The film is a well.
I:8652;763;crafted suspense tale, directed by a green Spielberg with confidence and aplomb (in my opinion, Spielberg permanently lost it with and after Empire of the Sun ).
I:8652;764;And like 1933's King Kong , the shark in Jaws seems to get bigger in every scene, so by the end of the film he beats good ol' Moby measure for measure.
I:8652;765;The classic movie that taught people to be afraid of the water using visual imagery and a haunting score.
I:8652;766;The original summer blockbuster .
I:8652;767;Everything from the music, cast, special effects, and limited viewing of the shark until near the end, is perfectly done.
I:8652;768;It held a nation in fear of what lies beneath the ocean, and it is simply a masterpiece.
I:8652;769;"The first half leads perfectly into the conclusion, where three men are pitted on a boat against the ""monster""."
I:8652;770;In the year 2050, Jaws will still be considered one of the top 10 greatest movies ever made.
I:8652;771;The picture is so fresh and clean.
I:8652;772;And the extras are as interesting as the movie, itself!
I:8652;773;It's interesting to watch how the career of Steven Spielberg, arguably the greatest director working today, has evolved.
I:8652;774;"In his second feature film, Spielberg seems to have taken his cues from the master, Alfred Hitchcock, most notably ""The Birds""."
I:8652;775;On what was probably a limited budget and limited technology of the time, Spielberg elicits enough scares to put today's CGI driven film.
I:8652;776;editing, and most effectively a great John Williams score to maximum effect.
I:8652;777;Spielberg was also blessed with the perfect cast in Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfus.
I:8652;778;Murray Hamilton even gives a good performance as the mayor who would sacrifice vacationers for the all.
I:8652;779;One of the more effective scenes in the film is the one where Robert Shaw as Quint, the shark.
I:8652;780;The extras were good including the making of doucumentary.
I:8652;781;Jaws really is such an incredible movie the acting in this film is incredible.
I:8652;782;Jaws is such a scary film I mean its more realistic then most horror films in the regards that Sharks are real and they do sometimes attack people not just the Great White Shark but Bull Sharks, and Tiger Sharks all pose a great threat to Humans.
I:8652;783;Okay back to the review this movie is so scectacular I just love it.
I:8652;784;I really find the man who directed this movie Steven Spielburg to be one of the best altime movie directors ever hands down He can do an incredible job Directing a horror movie, Scifi film like Star wars or a movie like American Graffiti.
I:8652;785;You wont believe the ending to this incredible film.
I:8652;786;Steven Spielberg's ultimate shocker still holds up great after all these years for the exact same reasons it was a huge box.
I:8652;787;office hit back in 1975: amazing score, powerful performances from an extremely talented cast, great special effects, and perfect direction.
I:8652;788;Shaw's delivery of the scene still chills to the bone and stands as one of the greatest moments in film history.
I:8652;789;of' documentary and an extensive art and design gallery are nice additions.
I:8652;790;Still, this is the definitive version of a classic film, one that deserves to be viewed multiple times both on the screen and in your darkest nightmares.
I:8652;791;Have fun swimming in the ocean after this one!!!
I:8652;792;My wife and I watched this video again last night and it still works.
I:8652;793;The screams still come even when you know what is coming and we cheered again at the ending.
I:8652;794;And seeing the trailers again made us remember to check the water.
I:8652;795;The DTS sound mix is incredible, and the pic is great also.
I:8652;796;A great movie at a good price.
I:8652;797;The movie was in excellent condition and I received it very quickly (just a few days after my order was placed).
I:8652;798;But this, in the final analysis of this landmark picture, actually proved to ADD to the suspense of the final cut!
I:8652;799;proving once more the theory: the scariest things are the things we CAN'T see!
I:8652;800;And when we finally see those huge jaws opened for the first time.
I:8652;801;"I still jump when I see it!This film has all elements that make up a classic thriller: tension beyond belief, suspense, great acting, and the occasional ""Oh Jesus!"""
I:8652;802;I would love to see this in Imax.
I:8652;803;Bass response is very good and deep.
I:8652;804;There are extra features on this disc including the making of JAWS and trivia.
I:8652;805;Thanks Universal and a thank you to Steven Spielberg.
I:8652;806;the changes that really got to me in paticular were the ones during the movie's climactic showdown between Brody and the shark.
I:8652;807;Now how climactic is that!?
I:8652;808;I thought it would be great for my kids to finally see it, and they thoroughly enjoyed it despite the shark looking a little fake in a couple of scenes.
I:8652;809;They liked the movie so much that they want to see Jaws 2 now.
I:8652;810;Jaws is simply the greatest monster movie, and it is also a great film on many levels, and considering its worldwide notoriety, I wont go off on that tangent.
I:8652;811;i have the distinct pleasure in saying that I have seen all the Jaws movies at the theater, some of them on opening day.
I:8652;812;Now thats entertainment with numerous possiblities.
I:8652;813;But noooo!Jaws 4 on the other hand at the very least has good people eating scenes.
I:8652;814;The special effects are better than Jaws 3, and the attacks are more frequent.
I:8652;815;and a tasty new DTS track.
I:8652;816;Without a doubt, JAWS is one of the best movies ever made.
I:8652;817;It has been my absolute favorite movie for over 20 years.
I:8652;818;The good news is that its still a great film.
I:8652;819;I mean it has it all in a hestitant hero, greedy locals, a lousy Mayor, A Crazy Ship's Captain, a smart alack rich kid expert and a perfect eating machine.
I:8652;820;The book is great too .
I:8652;821;Given the period that this film was made, the effects are really amazing.
I:8652;822;Directed by a young Steven Spielberg, it was a huge undertaking .
I:8652;823;stories about the filming are legendary .
I:8652;824;he triumphed over the difficulties and made a truly amazing movie.
I:8652;825;I recommend the film to anyone that loves a great thriller, a great drama, a great adventure, a great script, great acting, and great film.
I:8652;826;The crispness the clarity were excellent.
I:8652;827;'Jaws' is a landmark, and very important piece of movie history.
I:8652;828;Spielberg put his magic, along with a strong cast (including Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss), and a script which was original at its time (ok, since we've had the sequels, Lake Placid and numerous other 'when animals attack' type movies) to make a film which everybody in the World has at least heard of, and which had incredible success at the box office.
I:8652;829;Benchley, wrote about the Great White shark, and there is good reason why they choose this type of shark.
I:8652;830;"The Great White is the most impressive living creature in the planet today
I:8652;831;the music by John Williams really adds to the tension, and delivers maximum suspense.
I:8652;832;The shark does look a little dated when compared to 1999's 'Deep Blue Sea' (a fun film), but this has a lot more to offer.
I:8652;833;this film is in my all time top ten, and always will be.
I:8652;834;It still has me checking the water before I swim in the sea.
I:8652;835;This copy is beautiful .
I:8652;836;Jaws is the best shark movie ever made and it is my absolute favorite movie of the 1970s.
I:8652;837;It is also a big hit at the box office in 1975.
I:8652;838;But, it is a cinematic masterpiece.
I:8652;839;Amazing trip down memory lane, with outstanding performances all around [especially the shark].
I:8652;840;The horror film with real side.
I:8652;841;splitting laughter in it too.
I:8652;842;The story is written by a brilliant author, masterful performances by Roy Schieder, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss, and a realistic and voracious Great White Shark.
I:8652;843;Now, I'm 12 and to this day Jaws remains in my top spot for horror movies.
I:8652;844;For all horror and shark fans alike, this one is for you.
I:8652;845;It will remain a classic and will still be able to make entire generations be afraid to go into the water.
I:8652;846;The Jaws directed by Steven Spielberg is classic horror/thriller movie, released in 1975, about one summer on Amity Island when Sheriff Martin Brody discovered the remains of a shark attack victim.
I:8652;847;Although movie plot is fantastic, the movie excels with beautifully created characters played by Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw and even after all these years it's impossible to imagine any other actor playing their roles.
I:8652;848;Another outstanding movie element that contributes to the atmosphere is John Williams score which fits perfectly with the action on screen, contributing to the effect of fear and anticipation.
I:8652;849;Colors are strong, black levels deep and shadow detail is acceptable considering that greatest part of the movie was shot in sunlight, helping in creation of nicely saturated and rich colors.
I:8652;850;The 5.1 remixed track is using mostly the forward speakers but it displays very good range, while the rears are mainly used during underwater scenes.
I:8652;851;The DTS track seems a bit more active and it's giving much better feeling, the effects and music sounding more natural.
I:8652;852;Included are also few Deleted scenes and Outtakes which were also shortened but they are still fun, and a 12.
I:8652;853;ray this edition could be recommended at least because of the movie with decent picture and sound.
I:8652;854;This movie is a classic and the mother of all sea animals vs. humans.
I:8652;855;Sure there has been movies about killer whales, big snakes and other movies with sharks and also other JAWS movies but the first movie will always be regarded as the best out there right now.
I:8652;856;So, the audio is great and the movie looks pretty good despite the fact that it has been 25 years.
I:8652;857;Jaws is on of the best horror movies ever made, dealing with a rogue great white that terrorizes a small beach community.
I:8652;858;Like the main review, I thought the boat sequence was great, you realize it's the shark doing the hunting!
I:8652;859;In DTS or Dolby Digital sound you will amazed by the clarity of the sound, and become even more frightend all over again.
I:8652;860;And this shark is HUNGRY!
I:8652;861;"Brilliant acting, lots of action, and a great musical score [ who could forget the ""do."
I:8652;862;makes Jaws a pure classic.
I:8652;863;The bloopers are funny, too.
I:8652;864;[There's a blooper about a gun.
I:8652;865;:)PS: For a funny Jaws parody, check this out: [.]
I:8652;866;Keeps getting better with each view.
I:8652;867;If you like horror and you like good acting.
I:8652;868;Cinematography, music, acting are all superb.
I:8652;869;the movie is a timeless classic and the 100th anniversary Blu.
I:8652;870;ray makes it even better.
I:8652;871;This is a great film under the cliches of modern films about this subject matter.
I:8652;872;What this movie excells in is its suspense and control over the audience.
I:8652;873;"It works very well and nobody can deny that it scared them when they first saw it, unless they saw ""Open Water"" or ""Deep Blue Sea"" first."
I:8652;874;This movie can also be called the first summer blockbuster.
I:8652;875;It became the most successful movie of all time for good reason.
I:8652;876;Today, it still has the ability to do that.
I:8652;877;stars is terrific, the music has become classic, and the editing won an Oscar.
I:8652;878;If you're looking for a great, scary movie that will entertain as much as it scares, this is a good one.
I:8652;879;I think it's worth it.
I:8652;880;Sound was very good too.
I:8652;881;i was quite suprised to see this film available in the format, PLEASENTLY suprised.
I:8652;882;The very begining in which the pulsating theme is first heard fills the entire sound field.
I:8652;883;Bass is greatly emphasized here.
I:8652;884;great picture, great sound, for a film thats 25 years old.
I:8652;885;The game is fun too.
I:8652;886;fi, horror classic for the ages, Jaws is the first of many Steven Spielberg movies that rank as blockbusters.
I:8652;887;It has a musical score unlike any other (especially the opening sequence) by John Williams.
I:8652;888;Jaws stars Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss with co. stars Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton.
I:8652;889;It is one of the top 100 movies of all time.
I:8652;890;This movie is one of the most beautifully put together movies of all time.
I:8652;891;It has a great storyline that is backed up with great special effects for the time at which it was made along with great acting.
I:8652;892;Every aspect of this movie was put together nearly perfect to create a not only terrifying story, but also a fantastic movie.
I:8652;893;The special features added are quirky and fun.
I:8652;894;And for someone who absolutely loves the movie, they are must have collector's items.
I:8652;895;It's still one of the greatest movies ever created and has definitely cemented it's place in movie history.
I:8652;896;It is the best presentation of this film since it was first released.
I:8652;897;I have always loved this movie.
I:8652;898;The DTS sound is phenomenal, much more spacious than the standard DOLBY version.
I:8652;899;knuckling the arms of my seat.
I:8652;900;What a great time I had, all those years ago in the cinema, as watching this thriller was one whale (shark?)
I:8652;901;Duh. . . but aside from all the obvious plusses (great story, suspense, characters, timing, musical score, dialogue, etc.) that make watching this film, over the years, such a delight, I tend to marvel at two noteworthy components of this instant classic.
I:8652;902;"The first is the interaction of the Big Three (Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss)
I:8652;903;is perhaps the most riveting monologue in all of cinema.
I:8652;904;Just think of it: The difficulties of simulating the power of a giant shark tearing apart a boat in the open ocean (with the limited technology at the time) must have been extraordinary, yet Spielberg and crew accomplish the insurmountable.
I:8652;905;and make it look totally believable.
I:8652;906;Accordingly, JAWS is the product of filmmakers at the pinnacle of their craft, which makes it as much fun to watch today as the first time I spilled my soda.
I:8652;907;Jaws is a motion picture that was well ahead of it's time.
I:8652;908;Have always loved watching this movie.
I:8652;909;Arrived on time and packaging was fine.
I:8652;910;loved Robert Shaw with his soliloquys and poems, and the best facial reaction from Roy seeing that huge chunk of cheese or silly putty (your choice), bravo!!!
I:8652;911;While today's horror films continue to pour on the blood and guts and sacrificing B. actors and a poor story/script, Jaws shows us that a horror film can be big, directed well, contain a tight story and feature top A. list actors in Hollywood.
I:8652;912;That's the beauty of the horror surounding this film.
I:8652;913;That is the real scare to this film.
I:8652;914;One scene still compete's today with any blood.
I:8652;915;what makes the film so accomplished in the end is much more than the horror.
I:8652;916;The characters are superb, and the wonderfully written script is used so well by the actors.
I:8652;917;Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw share incredible chemistry in this film, with scene after scene of frustrations, anger, joy and cooperation.
I:8652;918;Though not known for its comedy aspects, I found little lines and scenes here and there to be extremely funny, given the nature of things.
I:8652;919;jaws is a 5 star classic .
I:8652;920;It has gone down as one of the greatest horror film accomplishments of all time.
I:8652;921;In fact, there is nothing spectacular about either the sound or the picture.
I:8652;922;Along with the movie, there are enough extras to keep the viewer entertained for several hours.
I:8652;923;long documentary offers a great many insights into the making and marketing of the movie.
I:8652;924;And it's always fun to see the appearance many years later of the actors and filmmakers from a 25.
I:8652;925;Their comments reflect how well this film has aged.
I:8652;926;The movie is still as much fun as it was the first time we saw the shark rear its head from the water and heard the police chief utter, You're going to need a bigger boat.
I:8652;927;It's a fun time all the way, from the opening scenes to the last production note.
I:8652;928;Okay, so there have been multiple releases but this release is the grand daddy of them all and fans of the classic shark tale will be pleased.
I:8652;929;Jaws was director Stephen Spielberg's first huge blockbuster movie.
I:8652;930;The film also did wonders for Martha's Vineyard's tourism industry.
I:8652;931;The best thing I like about the set is that it includes a full color booklet.
I:8652;932;It includes a 2 hour documentary about the film.
I:8652;933;Another feature on the disc is the Jaws Archive which includes production photo's, storyboards, and more.
I:8652;934;It's an older but a good movie to watch again and again.
I:8652;935;This is one of the best films ever made.
I:8652;936;However the Bruce did not always work properly, but Spielberg had to shoot something, so we get a classic.
I:8652;937;i used to be scared of it,but i now think it is a great movie to watch.
I:8652;938;i really recommend this movie!
I:8652;939;This was a gift for my daughter and she loved it.
I:8652;940;The first one was the best out of all the Jaws movies.
I:8652;941;And it frustrates me how people proclaim it a great movie and a classic, and it's a terrible movie!
I:8652;942;Why is it so suspenseful?
I:8652;943;It never goes over the line to become too maudlin and, thanks to the performance of Dreyfuss and Shaw, ably abetted by straight man, Scheider, possesses the element of humor which saves it from being a horror film.
I:8652;944;Well worth watching another time if you saw it some years ago.
I:8652;945;after a short and sweet coverup by the business.
I:8652;946;Therein lies the charm of Jaws .
I:8652;947;If and when we return to the beach at the ocean, we will find ourselves suddenly reminded that we are not at the top of the food chain.
I:8652;948;Quint goes the way of Captain Ahab, right into the beast's mouth, still kicking, stabbing, shouting and fighting.
I:8652;949;One is longer and is touted as being new and improved over the last release.
I:8652;950;"available interview with Steven Spielberg""."
I:8652;951;This is the best film of this generation, based upon the novel by author Peter Benchley and directed by the most successful director of our time, Steven Spielberg.
I:8652;952;see classic from Universal Pictures.
I:8652;953;If you don't own this movie yet or haven't seen it quite yet (which I very highly doubt), watch this awesome thriller!
I:8652;954;Anyone clicking on this product is familiar with the beloved movie, so I will skip straight to the technical specs.
I:8652;955;"unreleased and highly entertaining documentary ""The Shark is Still Working."""
I:8652;956;the movie is timeless and is a prime example of a good scare without being TOO bloody.
I:8652;957;"Jaws does have some great extra: a 12 question trivia game, deleted scenes, and a few outtakes
I:8652;958;The movie is a classic, however, and worth every penny.
I:8652;959;That is one of the most classic lines in the movie, JAWS.
I:8652;960;and along with that the movie itself is classic.
I:8652;961;From the brilliant screen adaptation of Peter Benchley's book to the excellent direction of a young Steven Spielberg to the chilling, all too familiar orchastra music by John Williams .
I:8652;962;He should have won it!
I:8652;963;and of course, Richard Dreyfeuss is brilliant in everything he does.
I:8652;964;The acting all around is just great.
I:8652;965;It is full of great suspense, action, a great story that gets you hooked in everytime.
I:8652;966;I can see clearly that Hitchcock was one of Spielberg's inspirations.
I:8652;967;It is merely the suspense of the movie that brings us to the edge of our seats.
I:8652;968;I think that is what makes this film one of the best of it's genre.
I:8652;969;On one hand, I love this movie as high adventure/suspense thriller.
I:8652;970;no matter how many times I watch this movie, I am still riveted by the opening sequence.
I:8652;971;The casting is sheer perfection (especially Richard Dreyfuss as oceanographer Matt Hooper).
I:8652;972;The music is beyond perfection (I put it up there with Bernard Herrmann's score for Psycho).
I:8652;973;The story is simple and to the point.
I:8652;974;Fake shark and all, this is one fantastic movie.
I:8652;975;One of the best funnest movies.
I:8652;976;If you haven't seen it, please do.
I:8652;977;Now I have to write 7 more words: here they are.
I:8652;978;The picture was excellent and clearer than any VHS.
I:8652;979;The kids loved playing the shark game trivia.
I:8652;980;Even if saw when it first came out, see it again!
I:8652;981;Jaws is the story of a great.
I:8652;982;This is the best shark film ever made and was genuinely scary, even to this day.
I:8652;983;the story is from a best.
I:8652;984;The acting was very good.
I:8652;985;Shaw, in particular, was amazing.
I:8652;986;His quirky portrayl of a shark hunter, is the highlight of the cast.
I:8652;987;Scheider plays the everyman role here well.
I:8652;988;He just keeps the movie afloat until the meat of the flick kicks in.
I:8652;989;I thought Dryfuss did a great job, as well.
I:8652;990;I think it is a classic and definately a must.
I:8652;991;I enjoyed watching this movie again and reliving the fears that it brought with it.
I:8652;992;special Features: There is a very good documentary about the making of the movie.
I:8652;993;A trivia game, shark world, and a few trailers round out the supplements.
I:8652;994;Still jumped out if the seat!
I:8652;995;This is an outstanding movie with a brilliant cast and fantastic special effects.
I:8652;996;And, needless to say, the music is a standout.
I:8652;997;To me this is the greatest movie ever!
I:8652;998;But once I got over that is is just a great movie.
I:8652;999;I saw this at Emory in Atlanta a few years ago and the guy who was running the film for a festival they were having mentioned about all of the firsts that JAWS had done or set records for but he ended his speech with flat out it is just really a great movie I think that just somes it up.
I:8652;1000;Plus I love watching all the young people still screaming there heads off at certain moments in the movie.
I:8652;1001;If you ever get to see this in a theatre please do!
I:8652;1002;It was just as advertised and enjoyed very much.
I:8652;1003;jaws is a great suspense movie and the edition is very very good.
I:8652;1004;Sound, Picture, package and extras.
I:8652;1005;The movie creates compelling, realistic characters whom you actually find yourself caring about.
I:8652;1006;Viewers never really see the shark until the end of the movie, but the film does a brilliant job playing on the audience's suspense.
I:8652;1007;Overall, it's Spielberg at his finest and is a wonderful example of how a good script and careful editing can go a long way.
I:8652;1008;Jaws is my all time favorite movie.
I:8652;1009;Speilberg's summer thriller of 1975 is still the best shark movie of all time.
I:8652;1010;It will have you on the edge of your seat until the very end.
I:8652;1011;the digital restoration is amazing, especially in regards to Bruce (the shark).
I:8652;1012;The feature AND most of the extras are all in 7.1 sound.
I:8652;1013;The BD is slammed full of special features covering everything from the musical score, extras, interviews, and all sorts of chum in the waters.
I:8652;1014;Dollar for dollar, quote for quote, this is the version a true JAWS fan wants.
I:8652;1015;the Shark Still Works, and it looks great!
I:8652;1016;The extra footage is massive!
I:8652;1017;the movie itself is classic.
I:8652;1018;I remember being so scared of the water after seeing this movie.
I:8652;1019;The acting/directing here is superb, and the shark itself is terrifying.
I:8652;1020;The absence of the shark actually builds the suspense in the movie.
I:8652;1021;Everyone knows the story of jaws and everyone has seen the movie.
I:8652;1022;The digital picture really makes the movie more life.
I:8652;1023;I have loved this movie all of my life and finally finding this movie makes the overall view of jaws in my mind a whole lot better.
I:8652;1024;but with the great technology that we have today, you, the people, are allowed to view this classic like you ever thought possible.
I:8652;1025;Honestly folks, you gotta check this one out.
I:8652;1026;You'll love it!Thanks for reading my review and have a nice day!
I:8652;1027;Jaws is one of those movies that gets better the more you watch it.
I:8652;1028;After all these years and at least 20 viewings of this movie since the premier its still a blast to watch.
I:8652;1029;I'm not a big Spielberg fan (I'm more for Kubrick and Burton), but I really do enjoy his classic films.
I:8652;1030;And boy is it a movie!
I:8652;1031;"Plus, the dialogue is easily recognizable (""I got no spit."")"
I:8652;1032;but other than that, this classic remains a classic.
I:8652;1033;Part Three was good, but Parts Two and Four are the weakest.
I:8652;1034;great movie from the 80's
I:8652;1035;Transfer qualiy is first rate on this disc.
I:8652;1036;billion dollar box office blockbuster, but excellent cinema to boot.
I:8652;1037;With Steven Spielberg as director, and a trio of leading men who give high.
I:8652;1038;caliber performances, it's no wonder that this remains one of the top movies of its kind.
I:8652;1039;the film's plot is well known: Amity Island is beset by a series of attacks carried out by a mysterious Great White shark, and the powers.
I:8652;1040;Richard Dreyfuss is the shark expert who confirms the presence of a Great White in the local waters.
I:8652;1041;true method of mere suggestion.
I:8652;1042;Like Spielberg's 1971 suspense masterpiece DUEL, it was now very much in the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock, specifically the Master's 1963 film THE BIRDS.
I:8652;1043;Spielberg's use of Hitchcock's suspense.
I:8652;1044;building techniques, combined with the fine performances of Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfyss, helped to drive JAWS to the top of the box office charts and onto three Oscar wins: editing, sound, and John Williams' now.
I:8652;1045;It is essential viewing to this very day, especially for horror and suspense film buffs.
I:8652;1046;This was a Christmas gift to my son.
I:8652;1047;He loves the movies however, it's more for adults.
I:8652;1048;And the sound is much better, too.
I:8652;1049;It is my favorite movie poster ever.
I:8652;1050;what a pleasant surprise to find Roy Scheider narrated the documentary The Shark is Still Working.
I:8652;1051;I should have realized it before but this was the documentary that made me understand just how incredible this undertaking was, to have a mechanical shark on the ocean and get it to work?
I:8652;1052;It always has been, always will be.
I:8652;1053;i still get an indescribable feeling at the end when Hooper and Brody are kicking back to shore and that wonderful ending music by Williams is playing.
I:8652;1054;The best reproduction of Jaws on Blu.
I:8652;1055;I take issue with those who are grumpy about Universal's decision to re.
I:8652;1056;As new technology is invented, there will be other, future editions, I assure you.
I:8652;1057;The Academy Award winning sound has more bite than before, cleaner and more gripping.
I:8652;1058;To be honest, the one.
I:8652;1059;hour version actually gives us everything we need to know, and is edited with great care.
I:8652;1060;steven Spielberg, as usual, provides no commentary.
I:8652;1061;"Spielberg recalls ""Jaws"" as a ""fun movie to watch, but not a fun movie to make."
I:8652;1062;Richard Dreyfuss and Roy Scheider vie for camera time, spinning terrific stories.
I:8652;1063;He looks like a pop star but talks like a savvy pro.
I:8652;1064;This is arguably the first great modern blockbuster and it had such a tremendous cultural impact.
I:8652;1065;Jaws is the classic man vs. nature story and proves how deadly it can turn out.
I:8652;1066;This early Speilberg film was a glimpse of good thing to come and successfully began his great career.
I:8652;1067;I remember being very young and seeing this movie when it first came out, and being afraid to go in the water for awhile.
I:8652;1068;The story of a Long Island town that is terrorized by an enormous great white shark is done with great direction.
I:8652;1069;There is not too much of the mystery surrounding the shark given away in the first half of the movie, and this creates a good build up of tension and suspense that this genre of movie needs.
I:8652;1070;The suspense comes in waiting for the great white.
I:8652;1071;Jaws is still a classic, and the kind of movie that you think about when you go to the beach and take your first step into the water.
I:8652;1072;ray transfer is like watching the movie for the 1st time, it is excellent.
I:8652;1073;"Thrilling action, good characters, great music
I:8652;1074;I think the best thing about it is that it's about a shark.
I:8652;1075;Sharks are very exciting, aren't they?
I:8652;1076;So it only makes sense that a movie about sharks would be one of the greatest movies ever produced, and I don't say that lightly!Men on the sea battling a fierce eating machine, oh what a thrill!
I:8652;1077;I can't wait to see it again and I look forward to seeing more movies about sharks.
I:8652;1078;I understand there's a sequel to this movie out there, well I promise you that it will be joining its brother on my shelf.
I:8652;1079;Jaws is a classic movie.
I:8652;1080;Packed with sheer terror, suspense, and the best score films could ever have.
I:8652;1081;It's 50% percent of the film's success.
I:8652;1082;This blockbuster film adapted from Peter Benchley's novel has a huge killer shark terrorizing a New England summer resort.
I:8652;1083;The people who are trying to stop is Chief Brody (Roy schiender, great performance), shark specialist Hooper (Richard dreyfuss, in fine and humerous form) and crazy shark hunter (Robert Shaw, I love this actor, he gives the best performance in this film, who can forget his USS Indianapolis speech?)
I:8652;1084;But first I got to give nod to Steven Speilberg, he's the master of suspense (after Alfred Hitchcock).
I:8652;1085;back to my favorite scenes.
I:8652;1086;I love the opening scenes with a pretty girl being chewed up by the shark.
I:8652;1087;I also love the ending with Quint(Shaw) also being chewed up.
I:8652;1088;In summary, it's one of the greatest movies of all time and should be in everyone's film library.
I:8652;1089;Now available with documentary which add to the enjoyment.
I:8652;1090;Everyone who is anyone has heard of Jaws and more than likely has seen the amazing film in some form or fashion.
I:8652;1091;I'm not here to praise the film itself, which I can accomplish by simply saying One of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:8652;1092;Never has this film looked so crisp and gorgeous.
I:8652;1093;The sound is engaging and powerful.
I:8652;1094;And the supplementals are classic.
I:8652;1095;The documentary is fantastic, illuminating the troubles with Bruce the mechanical shark and providing some cut scenes.
I:8652;1096;Bruce the Shark continues to thrill after a quarter century.
I:8652;1097;They did an awesome job restoring this film!
I:8652;1098;Love the movie an absolute classic done the right way!
I:8652;1099;It is a thriller just like it was almost 35 years ago.
I:8652;1100;One of the best movies ever made.
I:8652;1101;They really liked the movie!!
I:8652;1102;Super clean image, great sound, wonderful featurettes detailing not only the creation of the movie, but also the restoration process.
I:8652;1103;It is, and everybody should see it at some time.
I:8652;1104;"As far as I'm concerned, this is one of the greatest films in history, even better than the original ""Star Wars"" and certainly Mr. Spielberg's best."
I:8652;1105;Jaws is nearly perfect in every way.
I:8652;1106;It was the first real summer blockbuster, and to this day it's still the best.
I:8652;1107;Unlike most of today's blockbusters, Jaws was blessed with a superb cast, a fantastic director, and a good screenplay.
I:8652;1108;most of Jaws's success can be attributed to Steven Spielberg's masterful direction.
I:8652;1109;He brilliantly utilizes the Hitchcockian method of showing less, thereby giving the audience more.
I:8652;1110;By not showing the shark for the first hour of the movie and only showing the evidence of its strength and the aftermath of its attacks, Spielberg triggers the audience's imagination making the film all the more thrilling.
I:8652;1111;peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb's screenplay is well written.
I:8652;1112;Evidence of the screenplay's strong characters can be found in the extraordinary chemistry between them and their motives for their actions.
I:8652;1113;the cast does a fantastic job at giving life to the characters of the script.
I:8652;1114;Roy Scheider wisely underplays his character, Martin Brody, making him very believable.
I:8652;1115;Robert Shaw is absolutely wonderful as the sea.
I:8652;1116;Richard Dreyfuss is very convincing as the energetic, young scientist, Matt Hooper.
I:8652;1117;Lorraine Gary gives a very naturalistic performance as Brody's wife, Ellen.
I:8652;1118;"Murray Hamilton does a nice job at playing the greedy mayor of Amity
I:8652;1119;bill Butler's cinematography is first.
I:8652;1120;He brings the ocean right into our laps by placing the camera at the water's level.
I:8652;1121;Despite the fact that the shark is not seen for the first hour of the film, the movie still manages to be suspenseful and interesting.
I:8652;1122;john Williams's musical score, for this film, has reached legendary status for good reason.
I:8652;1123;His simple use of a few notes to characterize the shark was ingenious.
I:8652;1124;He brings the suspense/action scenes to life with his energetic score.
I:8652;1125;all of these fine qualities are why Jaws has remained one of my favorite films for quite some time.
I:8652;1126;This is a great movie, and I love to watch it again every so often.
I:8652;1127;the opening scene with a beautiful young woman, Chrissie Watkins (Susan Backlinie), skinny dipping and then being sucked under the water to her death, sets the scene and made Susan into a celebrity though she played such a short part (short but memorable).
I:8652;1128;the movie always keeps up the suspense anytime anyone is swimming, and keeps one wondering always who the next victim will be.
I:8652;1129;good scenes at the beach, especially the mass panic that was created everytime the shark was sighted and all the bathers stampeded out the water.
I:8652;1130;good scene with the kids waving to the camera during a news report.
I:8652;1131;fanatastic and chilling close ups of the Great White during the second half of the movie.
I:8652;1132;It still gives you the shivers!
I:8652;1133;it's nice to go back and be shown how it's really done.
I:8652;1134;Based on Peter Benchley's novel, Speilberg directs masterfully, exhuding masses of tension from his principle trio and obviously from the shark itself.
I:8652;1135;This armed with John Williams' unforgettable score will get far more hearts beating than any CGI monster .
I:8652;1136;As his feet scrabble up the wood to safety, you'll finally realise how simple Speilberg's techniques are .
I:8652;1137;there's a real human element here.
I:8652;1138;but even so, John Williams helps keep things thumping along.
I:8652;1139;It's best just to watch the original, be awed by a fantastic screenplay, some nailbiting direction and economic use of the titular monster, and really see where Hollywood's going wrong these days.
I:8652;1140;It is like seeing it again for the first time.
I:8652;1141;The goodies on the second disc are real treats.
I:8652;1142;I really enjoyed 'The Shark is Still Working as well as Jaws 'The Restoration', which shows how painstaking the process was of going through the original print and cleaning it up frame by frame.
I:8652;1143;"star review because I do think that the movie is great, that this is a wonderful presentation of it, and because I hadn't bought any of the previous ""special editions""."
I:8652;1144;When Dreyfuss is looking at the girls remains in the office he holds up her hand and starts to explain what happens when a shark attacks then it seems to cut off and he's talking about something else.
I:8652;1145;'Jaws' is one of the greatest films of all.
I:8652;1146;The shark holds up very well considering how long ago it was, and the performances are first.
I:8652;1147;rate, with particular note going to Robert Shaw as Quint, with his deservedly legendary monologue regarding his experiences on the sea in World War 2.
I:8652;1148;this film works as drama, adventure and horror, and is still Spielberg's best film.
I:8652;1149;Speilberg tapped into this fear and tapped into it rather well.
I:8652;1150;Today, JAWS still remains a classic.
I:8652;1151;It had a certainly personality.
I:8652;1152;The story of greed at the expense of human life is truly interesting to see.
I:8652;1153;It also boasts some great characters as well, namely, Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and especially Robert Shaw as Quint, the old shark hunter with a Captain Ahab syndrome.
I:8652;1154;It's just magnificent!Yes, JAWS does contain its fair share of frights, but Speilberg was wise in inserting genuine moments of humor as well to relieve that certain tension.
I:8652;1155;Certainly, that scene with Chief Brody at the dinner table with his young son copying his every move was both humorous and quite touching.
I:8652;1156;Today, many movies seem to crack that mark with ease.
I:8652;1157;JAWS did to sharks what another great monster movie, KING KONG did to gorillas .
I:8652;1158;This is the movie that created the term Summer Blockbuster,and it's not hard to see how this film could have influenced movie making into what we know today.
I:8652;1159;it has a terrific script,great direction from Spielberg,a fitting cast and great thrills.
I:8652;1160;This blockbuster movie definitely deserves a five star.
I:8652;1161;I liked its originality and the way the movie created an impact to water particularly swimming in beaches.
I:8652;1162;I also have to add the fact that this movie was made in the 70s and back then, there were no extraordinary special effects made possible in movies right now.
I:8652;1163;the score made upon the shark's approach was great in keeping the mood creepy and haunting.
I:8652;1164;Overall, this is one of the most original movies of all time and any other shark movies will never compare to the wonder that is Jaws.
I:8652;1165;"doo"" That day they caught a baby Great White between where we were and Catalina Island, the next day a world record Great White off of Catalina."
I:8652;1166;It was fun to watch this movie again almost 30 years later and how movies were made then.
I:8652;1167;My children heard about this and wanted to see it.
I:8652;1168;I remember when it came out, the special effects were cutting edge.
I:8652;1169;It's a classic in every sense of the word.
I:8652;1170;But that should tell you something.
I:8652;1171;Love the movie, always have.
I:8652;1172;I'll keep it short and sweet.
I:8652;1173;JAWS is my favorite film of all time, so I had high hopes for the just.
I:8652;1174;Bring back the REAL POSTER!
I:8652;1175;art technology to clean up/restore the original print, now FADED and GRAINY in several spots.
I:8652;1176;white shark arrives and starts killing beach.
I:8652;1177;That's the basic premise of Peter Benchley's famous novel, brought to screen by Steven Spielberg with some major changes to the plot.
I:8652;1178;The first half is the most enjoyable, as director Spielberg evokes a sense of fear from the outset with the gruesome discovery of the remains of a shark victim.
I:8652;1179;"There is a constant and strong sense of impending doom: ""who will be next?"
I:8652;1180;Rather, splendid directing creates an emotional fear with small and brilliant touches throughout.
I:8652;1181;"goers as ""shark bait"" through the eyes of the Chief of Police and share his fear."
I:8652;1182;John Williams impressive score with its recurring shark theme turns up the chills all the higher.
I:8652;1183;But here two wonderful characters come to the forefront to join the police chief in the quest for the shark: the kooky shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw), and the eccentric shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) who is humorously and completely impersonal in his passion for sharks.
I:8652;1184;The conclusion is rather more graphic than a PG rating would suggest, but is quite satisfying.
I:8652;1185;fashioned about the sense of terror and suspense it evokes.
I:8652;1186;"tingling atmosphere that has made the chilling story of ""Jaws"" an unforgettable classic that will continue to grab viewers by the teeth in years to come."
I:8652;1187;I give jaws a 5 star rating due to the fact that it has so many bonus features to choose from and it's a classic film that has stood the test of time.
I:8652;1188;JAWS was a great movie.
I:8652;1189;"I thought it was cool how people got attacked by ""JAWS""."
I:8652;1190;It was kind of scary which was cool.
I:8652;1191;Now, I need to see Jaws 2!
I:8652;1192;One of Steven Speilberg's finest hours.
I:8652;1193;It is a great film because of the story, the characters and the actors and actresses that make the film happen.
I:8652;1194;I highly recommend watching the making of, just to gain an appreciation for what making this film entailed, and the nave director of Steven Spielberg at the time.
I:8652;1195;"ray release of ""Jaws"" includes a bonus feature about the restoration and shows how the beach scene, formerly yellow, is now bright and blue
I:8652;1196;While still a phenomenal movie, the Blu.
I:8652;1197;If you want a good fright but not too harsh, this is a perfect movie.
I:8652;1198;JAWS is indeed one great movie, and no creature film has touched it since.
I:8652;1199;It is a complete joy to watch.
I:8652;1200;value at their endings, and with Field of Dreams because of the subject matter touching me so very deeply).
I:8652;1201;What a great, sorrowfully underrated, actor he was!So, pick it up, take it home and pop it in your player, and sit on your hands so you don't chew your nails down to the knuckles!
I:8652;1202;Thus is one of the lines in this classic film with Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider, and others, in what has to be the best terror film of modern times.
I:8652;1203;Of course now we have to watch out for crocodiles and their ilk, but overall, this is one of the best.
I:8652;1204;So hold on to your seat, and get the popcorn popping, and belt in for quite a ride.
I:8652;1205;"Now, when you see a film like ""This is Your Ocean: Sharks"" ."
I:8652;1206;Bad idea!The excellent music composed by John Williams will always make me think of JAWS.
I:8652;1207;all an enjoyable movie, but not right before you go on vacation at the beach.
I:8652;1208;Still one of the great thrillers of all time.
I:8652;1209;rated film in movie history.
I:8652;1210;Even the special effects suck.
I:8652;1211;I got the wrong movie (DaVinci Code) in the mail but it was a good movie so I kept It
I:8652;1212;I'll keep it short and sweet.
I:8652;1213;the visual clarity, booming surround sound, and full.
I:8652;1214;I love to watch Jaws every few years, and this upgrade to what's been available for the last 30+ years is a joy to experience.
I:8652;1215;as these classics of 70's and early 80's cinema are being restored, it's a joy to experience them again in Blu.
I:8652;1216;Not sure there's much more to be said about this, it's a fantastic restoration that manages to somehow stay true to the original look, feel and style of the cinematography.
I:8652;1217;live that era in such clarity again, from the objects, clothes, hair styles and elements, are amazing to see in this manner.
I:8652;1218;It's impressive to see what a difference this sort of treatment makes.
I:8652;1219;Not to long ago, I tried seeing Jaws again since I was a child and I liked the movie to my surprise.
I:8652;1220;i recommend this movie for anyone who likes Spielberg films and isn't afraid of watching a ocean movie.
I:8652;1221;THE movie that created the term SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER and greatly deserved!
I:8652;1222;ray combo as a present for myself and a second one to give to one of my dear friends.
I:8652;1223;What an experience again and to my surprise even the younger audience went wild with shear terror and young girls covering their eyes!!
I:8652;1224;The masterful direction and adaptation by Mr. Steven Spielberg GENIUS!
I:8652;1225;The excellent cast Mr. Roy Scheider (R. i. p.) Mr. Robert Shaw (R. i. p.) and Mr. Richard Dreyfuss all in top acting form and of course THE GRAND DADDY OF ALL MONSTER SHARKS JAWS !!
I:8652;1226;Excellent restoration of a true classic.
I:8652;1227;The visual detail is outstanding and it has new life!
I:8652;1228;I'm sure there are many fans out there who love this new soundtrack.
I:8652;1229;i would have given it 5 stars, but still it's a great release.
I:8652;1230;Jaws as a novel was a bubble gum read.
I:8652;1231;Jaws as a movie is a terriffic thrill ride.
I:8652;1232;This builds up the suspense and terror, and is the main reason that Jaws was the success that it was.
I:8652;1233;They'll tell you the story of how the success of the film kept people out of the water at the beaches that year (which had towns that run beaches hopping mad because no one was coming to their beaches and they were going broke).
I:8652;1234;the strength of the three leads is also one of the pillars of this film.
I:8652;1235;Scheider, Dreyfuss and the late Robert Shaw are all extremely believable in their roles.
I:8652;1236;"And Scheider gets to deliver an actor's dream
I:8652;1237;after a short and sweet coverup by the business.
I:8652;1238;Therein lies the charm of Jaws .
I:8652;1239;If and when we return to the beach at the ocean, we will find ourselves suddenly reminded that we are not at the top of the food chain.
I:8652;1240;Quint goes the way of Captain Ahab, right into the beast's mouth, still kicking, stabbing, shouting and fighting.
I:8652;1241;One is longer and is touted as being new and improved over the last release.
I:8652;1242;"available interview with Steven Spielberg""."
I:8652;1243;I soon saw the original JAWS movie and loved it instantly (funny thing is, they never scared me much.
I:8652;1244;I have always been a huge fan of this movie and still get a jolt out of seeing certain scenes, and am horror.
I:8652;1245;it takes up the whole TV screen and shocks you into silence).
I:8652;1246;The characters are believable and more real than most people I know!
I:8652;1247;The directing, writing, cast, and even the effects make it the greatest film ever (in my humble opinion!)
I:8652;1248;This movie is absolutely spectacular!
I:8652;1249;When I was 10 years old I first watched it and I loved it since then!
I:8652;1250;I got this special VHS edition of it and it is excellent.
I:8652;1251;The making of it and theatrical trailers are cool too.
I:8652;1252;I recommend everybody to get this video for their collection!
I:8652;1253;I remember seeing it at the drive.
I:8652;1254;The picture is so clean and crisp.
I:8652;1255;If you love the movie then this is definitely a must.
I:8652;1256;The thrills are still at potent as in 1975.
I:8652;1257;thanks to the genius of Spielberg, Verna Fields and a GOOD screenplay by Garl Gootlieb and author Peter Bencheley this is both drama, horror and suspense on a high level.
I:8652;1258;JAWS is indeed high art.
I:8652;1259;Enjoyed it as much as the first time.
I:8652;1260;This movie is so great and always such a joy to watch.
I:8652;1261;the special effects at that moment and the suspenseful atmosphere are of first rate.
I:8652;1262;This movie is now part of the legend, and the first artistic triumph for Spieleberg.
I:8652;1263;the best of the saga, without any doubt.
I:8652;1264;The story plot is simple.
I:8652;1265;See Shark, See Shark terrorize a small coastal town, see people die, see people kill shark!
I:8652;1266;Although I have become accustomed to 21st century techniques in Hollywood, this story will be forever a classic.
I:8652;1267;This one really let's your imagination go.
I:8652;1268;You can watch it a dozen times and still get startled by it.
I:8652;1269;An oldie but still a goodie.
I:8652;1270;Jaws is easily one of the best films ever.
I:8652;1271;i loved the first time, and i loved it the tenth time.
I:8652;1272;the best part is the fact that this movie is 25 years old now and the effects dont look more than ten years old.
I:8652;1273;the suspense is wonderful and the score by john williams is a treasure.
I:8652;1274;sharp, colors are lush and vibrant, sound rumbles and screams beautifully.
I:8652;1275;Robert Shaw's USS Indianapolis monologue should be required viewing for anyone considering getting into acting.
I:8652;1276;THIS is what true acting is all about.
I:8652;1277;he is absolutely RIVETING to watch.
I:8652;1278;It's worth this movie just for this scene alone!
I:8652;1279;frame restoration they went through took a ton of work and really made the film look new again.
I:8652;1280;You can see the details on how they did this in the special features.
I:8652;1281;The special features also include a 2.
I:8652;1282;hour long documentary about how they made the film and although this is in SD it looks fine and was very interesting.
I:8652;1283;For me, the best thriller ever made (I'm 93 and have seen ????
I:8652;1284;"And with ""The Making of"" you see the physical problems and hear the comments of the superb cast."
I:8652;1285;This and the movie DUEL have been the best Steven Spielberg movies that I have ever seen!
I:8652;1286;This movie is funny adventures and has alot of action!
I:8652;1287;the fact is that this is Speilbergs finest moment.
I:8652;1288;But it is a classic.
I:8652;1289;the John Williams music is still as chilling as ever.
I:8652;1290;i saw this movie as a kid and now that i have my own kids they loved it as well.
I:8652;1291;This has been my favorite movie since the day it first came out.
I:8652;1292;It's always fun to watch even with the mechanical shark!
I:8652;1293;It's bound to make you afraid of the water!
I:8652;1294;If you like sharks you've got to see this.
I:8652;1295;When I saw this I knew I had to have it.
I:8652;1296;Jaws remains one of my favorite books and movies of all time.
I:8652;1297;The movie is very clear and the music is nice and loud.
I:8652;1298;The 1st movie was better than the last one.
I:8652;1299;year old film even for new viewers (the suspense build up brought about by John Williams' now classic score really helps!)
I:8652;1300;Not only does it provide rewatchable and timeless entertainment, but Jaws certainly stimulated my interest in the subject of sharks, which has thus far proven to be a personally rewarding one.
I:8652;1301;My friends and I got together to watch the film recently.
I:8652;1302;They hit it out of the park!
I:8652;1303;It just looked and sounded fantastic on my system.
I:8652;1304;A classic that's appropriate for all but the youngest family members!
I:8652;1305;This was really liked by all our family, including our 10.
I:8652;1306;JAWS remains a classic tale of adventure featuring one of the best 'monsters' in film history.
I:8652;1307;It has an excellent script, characters, action sequences and a great villain .
I:8652;1308;But, what truly makes this film a classic is the aura and feeling created by Steven Spielberg.
I:8652;1309;He perfectly crafted a movie from a great adventure book (written by Peter Benchley), presented characters (beautifully and emotionally portrayed by a mixture of veterans and newcomers (Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, and Murray Hamilton), dramatic conflict between man and beast (nature) and a story of fear of the unknown and uncontrollable.
I:8652;1310;Add to this a menacing villain (a monster shark) and you have a classic thriller which is one of the best films of all.
I:8652;1311;We see the conflict grow from man and man, man and beast, man and nature and ultimately man versus man's emotions.
I:8652;1312;I consider this a film of perfection thanks to Spielberg, Joe Alves (technical) and Carl Gottlieb (script) and the incredible cast.
I:8652;1313;I remain a fan of this massive undertaking by the makers of the film.
I:8652;1314;I still consider this one of the top twenty films of all.
I:8652;1315;Jaws is great in every department.
I:8652;1316;The acting is flawless, with Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw bonding in their search and detroy mission of the ultimate great white shark.
I:8652;1317;Spielberg, from the opening night sequence shocks us(one of the most terrifying in history) when we don't even see the shark, but see the first victim from the shark's eye view and John William's brilliant soundtrack telling us the terror is just starting.
I:8652;1318;With this masterpiece, Spielberg, at a young age, set the bar higher for horror and adventure films, and showed he was a genius in making action movies.
I:8652;1319;ray transfer is outstanding and the documentary, along with the other extras make this a great collectible.
I:8652;1320;I love the movie JAWS, and I agree with the AFI that it's one of the 100 greatest American films of all time.
I:8652;1321;"I just want everyone to know that the quote ""smile you son of a B****"" was edited to ""smile you son of a"" boom."
I:8652;1322;One of my all time favorite movies and needed the upgrade to blu.
I:8652;1323;Exciting movie to watch and my kind of movies.
I:8652;1324;I also love the background music as that also helps add to the excitement of the movie.
I:8652;1325;It also prepares people for when they go into the oceans to swim.
I:8652;1326;The acting was very good and the scenery too.
I:8652;1327;former) friend demanded to see it up front.
I:8652;1328;"Now that I'm around the same age as Roy Scheider in ""JAWS"", I can sit and watch this film every time I see it on."
I:8652;1329;"Writer of the ""JAWS"" novel, Peter Benchley is an interviewer on the beach."
I:8652;1330;amity is actually Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Sound.
I:8652;1331;what this film started was a mass hysteria, if you will, of people afraid of going to the beach and in the water.
I:8652;1332;Surfboards can look like a seal to eat.
I:8652;1333;jAWS was nominated for Best Picture and won the Academy Award for Best Sound, Orifinal Music Score.
I:8652;1334;the falling star you see in this film is a trademark of Spielberg's.
I:8652;1335;their are other films you might enjoy, SHARK!
I:8652;1336;this time however it appears that they finally have done it justice.
I:8652;1337;very interesting bonus features with details about on set and filming.
I:8652;1338;hOWEVER: they do give you a very nice 60 pg booklet which is what we all wanted anyway.
I:8652;1339;All the action, thrills and shocks are still there, no matter how many times you've seen this film.
I:8652;1340;And if you're lucky enough to own a home theater system to allow the full impact of the sound/music hit home, a huge extra dimension is added to the viewing experience.
I:8652;1341;John Williams' excellent score turned up to a high volume will help drive up the tension.
I:8652;1342;there are amusing outtakes (not nearly enough), deleted scenes and a fun trivia game.
I:8652;1343;Highlighting this entire package is an excellent making of documentary, benefitting hugely from the participation of director Spielberg.
I:8652;1344;Fascinating is learning all about how the shark and the scenes involving it were done.
I:8652;1345;Richard Dreyfuss is the shark expert.
I:8652;1346;Great whites grow up to 20 feet.
I:8652;1347;This movie still in the top 10 all time .
I:8652;1348;this one in DTS (digital theater sound), will be so incredible you might want to join Quint at the table for some apricot brandy.
I:8652;1349;I give this movie in its new format and sound two fins up!
I:8652;1350;i love sharks and Jon Williams.
I:8652;1351;Can't beat a classic flick from the 70's.
I:8652;1352;Now I have all four movies and I have a Jaws Fest every once in a while !!!!
I:8652;1353;This is a classic thriller no doubt about it!
I:8652;1354;I still remember the first time I saw this movie.
I:8652;1355;Of course now people look at it and say the shark is fake but back in 1975 this was one of the scariest movies!
I:8652;1356;The casting was great and the storyline was so thrilling it made you dying to get a good look at the shark!
I:8652;1357;Overall JAWS was and still is a great movie!
I:8652;1358;I always enjoy watching this one and every time I still get the same thrilling feeling as if I were with Schieder, Shaw and Drefeyuss on that junky little boat in the middle of the ocean waiting for the most vicious shark in the world!
I:8652;1359;A shark is terrozing a beach.
I:8652;1360;We got a great white.
I:8652;1361;The shark gets on the boat and eats Quint.
I:8652;1362;"well, five years ago, I bought the 25th anniversary edition of ""Jaws"" on VHS."
I:8652;1363;Jaws is atypical for a blockbuster in that the second half of the movie is basically a stage play with a cast of two scenery.
I:8652;1364;class fisherman act and Dreyfuss's hi.
I:8652;1365;"it's great to see ""Jaws"" still kicking hard 30 years later, in the way that ""War of the Worlds"" probably won't do in 2035."
I:8652;1366;Literally creating the summer blockbuster season, Jaws is one of the most entertaining films ever made.
I:8652;1367;Speilberg took a mediocore book and turned it into a true classic.
I:8652;1368;The characters, especially the three leads, are fully realized and developed.
I:8652;1369;With the addition of John Williams and his classic score and the supberb editing of Verna Fields, both won Oscars, it is perfect is almost every way.
I:8652;1370;Williams' score can finally be heard for what it is.
I:8652;1371;Lots of great extras,and a great widescreen presentation of the classic film!!!
I:8652;1372;The first and best of the Jaws series!!!
I:8652;1373;Spielberg was brilliant to not show the shark for the better half of the movie, which lets the viewer use his/her imagination.
I:8652;1374;Plus, William's score is without a doubt the best picked score in relation to a movie's plot.
I:8652;1375;Now, that takes talent, and Jaws is filled with it!
I:8652;1376;The dialogue, the score, the sheer terror.
I:8652;1377;Jaws is the best movie ever made.
I:8652;1378;I will spend the rest of my review explaining why.
I:8652;1379;Jaws is a thriller, a horror film, a drama, an adventure, it has comedy and tragedy.
I:8652;1380;It has elements of a revenge movie and it has elements of redemption story.
I:8652;1381;The film succeeds on all these levels and it did so by accident.
I:8652;1382;By the time the crew of three sail out to see to hunt the shark, each character is fully developed and realized.
I:8652;1383;also the fact that the mechanical shark did malfunction actually improved the movie.
I:8652;1384;Spielberg and the crew also were very good at getting the most out of visual representations, such as the barrels and the unforgettable score by John Williams.
I:8652;1385;In addition I contend the shark is a very compelling character of the film too.
I:8652;1386;A flawless example of storytelling, Jaws has remained and will continue to be my favorite movie of all time.
I:8652;1387;Jaws was one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:8652;1388;It would be great to hear the directors commentary.
I:8652;1389;Spielberg was in top form when he directed this 1975 action/thriller.
I:8652;1390;One of the most perfect films I've ever seen.
I:8652;1391;The casting is spot on, the acting is amazing and the pacing is perfect.
I:8652;1392;There is also quite a bit of comic relief moments that are very funny.
I:8652;1393;It looks just as good as it did when I saw it in the theater 40 years ago.
I:8652;1394;My pleasure in this movie was almost sapped by an American Studies Professor assigning a class in the American Horror Film to read her study: Jaws as Patriarchal Myth.
I:8652;1395;i just wanted to take this opportunity to share some Jaws trivia: Jaws was the first summer blockbuster, the first summer movie released as an event (same.
I:8652;1396;By doing so he delayed the appearance of the shark until so far into the movie that there was unintended suspense.
I:8652;1397;Any viewer will tell you that suspense makes the movie work very well.
I:8652;1398;This creative improvisation on Spielberg's part is evidence of his strong, strong talent.
I:8652;1399;Robert Shaw's story of the Indianapolis is true.
I:8652;1400;i recommend making a viewing of Jaws a Spring tradition, also Bull Durham.
I:8652;1401;Good ways to get into the summer spirit.
I:8652;1402;I am also just fine with a classic modern thriller told as a fish.
I:8652;1403;The anniversary edition has extras about the producer, director and the actors that I found fascinating and humorous.
I:8652;1404;all these years later, we still watch this master piece.
I:8652;1405;she watched and enjoyed it
I:8652;1406;Always wanted to see the cut footage.
I:8652;1407;a great film with an amazing cast.
I:8652;1408;Roy Scheider plays the ambivolant Chief Brody with ease and finesse.
I:8652;1409;The direction is expert, courtesy of Steven Spielberg.
I:8652;1410;The pacing is perfect, following a slow.
I:8652;1411;build pattern that ends with an incredibly tense climax.
I:8652;1412;it's one of my favorite movies ever.
I:8652;1413;One of the first movies I remember watching in the late 70s.
I:8652;1414;gets better all the time.
I:8652;1415;It's the humorous and believable characters that compel the story.
I:8652;1416;The dog and cat chase between these three characters and the monster shark will have you on the edge of your seat.
I:8652;1417;the John Williams score is brilliant.
I:8652;1418;"who among us hasn't mimiced the ""shark approach"" tune on occasion?This film is timeless."
I:8652;1419;There is another timeless classic that launched him into stardom released in 1975, Jaws.
I:8652;1420;"They get to the shark on the ""Orca"" and lured it with chum."
I:8652;1421;He gets on a pole and shoots at the shark and causes it to explode.
I:8652;1422;Hooper catches up to Martin and they paddle back home.
I:8652;1423;I saw it with a friend some time ago and it was timeless.
I:8652;1424;The acting was splendid, the shark looks pretty real, and the score by orchestra legend John Williams is so powerful, almost on par with Star Wars.
I:8652;1425;Seen this a long time ago when I was a kid and it's still a lot of fun to watch now.
I:8652;1426;"Visuals are not that great of course, but the humor is funny and there are lots of interesting ""fun facts"" to learn about various parts of the film."
I:8652;1427;Jaws is not only a great movie, but a sensation as well.
I:8652;1428;Roy Scheider is great as Police Chief Martin Brody, Richard Dreyfuss is outstanding as marine biologist Matt Hooper, but the real knockout of the movie is none other than Robert Shaw who plays Quint, the colorful shark fisherman.
I:8652;1429;"The extras are interesting to watch which take you back to the shooting days
I:8652;1430;Steven Spielberg's breakthrough hit gave audiences a glimpse at the future of one of the best directors in Hollywood history.
I:8652;1431;handidly made movies what they are today.
I:8652;1432;jaws is still considered his best movie by some fans and critics, it's acting, pacing and suspense are something movie fans should never forget, it's too bad films like Deep Blue Sea couldn't capture the magic quite as much as Spielberg did on this movie.
I:8652;1433;Spielberg is one of those who knows how to give movie fans a good time at the movies, and Jaws will forever hold a candle up for blockbuster.
I:8652;1434;I loved this uncut version and seeing the whole thing with all the original scenes was great.
I:8652;1435;It flowed so much better!
I:8652;1436;I saw this movie when it came out in the theaters and I loved it, so I bought it on VHS.
I:8652;1437;The shark scenes are intense and the movie is just scary fun to watch over and over.
I:8652;1438;Great way to start the summer beach season.
I:8652;1439;In all its wide screen glory.
I:8652;1440;My favorite movie of all time.
I:8652;1441;Will spend the whole summer watching this movie.
I:8652;1442;Saw this movie at a drive.
I:8652;1443;So suspenseful, camera in and out of the water, not knowing what the shark looks like until at last half.
I:8652;1444;Speilberg managed to put an intense fear of the ocean in the entire population, i still have a twinge of fear walking into the breakers.
I:8652;1445;the shark effects are brilliant.
I:8652;1446;The anticipation that builds up before you can even see the shark turns into amazement when you get your first glimpse.
I:8652;1447;The film crew did a fantastic job on Bruce the mechanical shark (unlike Jaws 2, 3 and 4).
I:8652;1448;Jaws has everything from top to bottom.
I:8652;1449;It is truly a great movie.
I:8652;1450;I love this movie, ive seen it about 40 or so times in my life and I will still watch it if it happens to be on amc.
I:8652;1451;Great movie to watch with friends or family.
I:8652;1452;This is the best Jaws.
I:8652;1453;The greatest movie ever made is finally complete on Blue.
I:8652;1454;It's restoration is stunning and is an absolute must.
I:8652;1455;I read where it took nearly a year to train the shark for all his sequences, which is amazing considering this was filmed in the early seventies.
I:8652;1456;They succeed thanks to terrific acting, frighteningly good photography, a lightning pace, and great background music by John Williams.
I:8652;1457;The film is timeless and will still give viewers of all ages all that they can swallow.
I:8652;1458;Jaws is one of my favorite movies of all time, everything about it is fantastic.
I:8652;1459;I can't recommend it enough if you haven't seen it, you definitely need to!
I:8652;1460;Loved it when it first came out.
I:8652;1461;Still one of the best shark movies ever!!
I:8652;1462;One of my top 10 movies of all time.
I:8652;1463;Not going to review the movie, everyone knows it is perfect.
I:8652;1464;the picture is phenomenal, crisp, clear and flawless.
I:8652;1465;The special features are great, especially about the restoration.
I:8652;1466;28 years ago this summer, an almost.
I:8652;1467;unknown director named Steven Spielberg, at the ripe old age of 25, released a film that caused a stampede at the box office and single.
I:8652;1468;"handedly started the phenomenon of the summer blockbuster with ""legs"", the movie you had to see again and again and again."
I:8652;1469;"Even after all this time, the ominous opening music from ""Jaws"" still sends a delicious tingle down the spine."
I:8652;1470;Spielberg's genius lay in turning Peter Benchley's mediocre novel into a well.
I:8652;1471;Spielberg brings all this to us in vivid detail and reminds us that, after all, sharks will be sharks.
I:8652;1472;spielberg has a gift for humorous touches as well, and he's a master at contrast.
I:8652;1473;"And the scene in which Quint smashes the boat's radio with a stick, effectively cutting off their communication with the outside world, is a masterpiece
I:8652;1474;"The film still delivers on its premise
I:8652;1475;Great movie :) Still terrifies me when I see Bruce going after the guy in the row boat!
I:8652;1476;Great documentary on the making of!
I:8652;1477;Great movie deal for the fan of great movies, actors, and the folks who made it!
I:8652;1478;The only new features are an interview piece with Spielberg that was shot during filming (and is thus quaintly and enjoyably archaic) and a booklet of photos from the film which is spotted with quotes from Spielberg and the stars.
I:8652;1479;This is a nice print piece, but it's highly debatable whether it makes the re.
I:8652;1480;ray release, but they also went back and performed a full frame.
I:8652;1481;ray will have the movie looking as good as (if not better than) a fresh film print that you would have seen in the theater in 1975!
I:8652;1482;ray will also have an upgraded sound mix, in the form of DTS.
I:8652;1483;Those who have a 7.1 setup in their home will be even more immersed in the sound effects and John Williams' haunting score.
I:8652;1484;Spielberg monitored and approved the blu.
I:8652;1485;seen footage and interviews with cast and crew including Steven Spielberg, Richard Dreyfuss and Roy Scheider.
I:8652;1486;depth look at the intricate process of restoring the movie.
I:8652;1487;From the Set: An insider's look at life on the set of JAWS, featuring an interview with Steven Spielberg.
I:8652;1488;"To this day, people are scared to go near the water because of it
I:8652;1489;"the beauty of this film is that it's subtle
I:8652;1490;The superb acting and camera work only enhance the tension, and the fact that the action takes place in a summer paradise creates an uncomfortable dichotomy that pushes it over the top.
I:8652;1491;Jaws is one of the great films of all time.
I:8652;1492;The fact that it is a genuine crowd pleaser makes it all the more special.
I:8652;1493;For these reasons the bonus feature on the making of Jaws is all the more interesting, because it shows how a movie that seemed almost cursed became a hit.
I:8652;1494;Still as strong as it was 30 years after it came out.
I:8652;1495;The original will send shivers down your spine.
I:8652;1496;the subtlety combined with the sharks frenzy will make you jump out of your seat.
I:8652;1497;"Jaws is one of the true great ""monster movies"" ever made ."
I:8652;1498;"it may be the best of the genre since ""King Kong"", and it hasn't been surpassed."
I:8652;1499;"Somehow, though, everything fits together, from the strong performances from every actor involved (except for Bruce the mechanical shark,), to John Williams' score (I've heard that Spielberg laughed when Williams first played the score for him, thinking Williams was joking, but those couple of notes are as scary in their simplicity as the ""Psycho"" score)."
I:8652;1500;I'm sure this film is constantly dissected in filmmaking classes .
I:8652;1501;even as a casual viewer, I catch something new every time I watch it.
I:8652;1502;Jaws is a textbook example of effective moviemaking, and a great rollercoaster ride of a movie.
I:8652;1503;This is what suspense, scary movies should be like.
I:8652;1504;if you saw him in From Russia With Love or Battle of the Bulge, you'll be surprised this is the same guy.
I:8652;1505;Absolutely perfect!Beyond that, Jaws is one scary movie.
I:8652;1506;John Williams' creepy shark theme has become iconic.
I:8652;1507;after the first scene, it will drive you crazy with suspense every time you hear it.
I:8652;1508;"Spielberg's direction has less flash than in some of his later movies, and this allows the performances to draw the viewer into the story
I:8652;1509;JAWS is probably the best film ever made in a century besides Citizen Kane.
I:8652;1510;Picture transfer is O. k., and it's great to see it in full wide.
I:8652;1511;jaws is the Greatest movie.
I:8652;1512;Now I hope JAWS 2 will be released in Blu.
I:8652;1513;ray with the original cover art featuring the shark with the water skier with hopefully some new extras as a bonus.
I:8652;1514;Jaws is one of the classics!
I:8652;1515;13 years later I didn't think the film could still give me a fright but I still hit the roof a few times even when I knew what was coming.
I:8652;1516;One of the greatest movies of all time.
I:8652;1517;i'd also recommend Close to Shore which is the non.
I:8652;1518;this also adds to my fear since I grew up and vacationed every summer on the exact non.
I:8652;1519;Still under age 30 when released, wunderkind director Spielberg hit the big time with this runaway box.
I:8652;1520;office hit, based on Peter Benchley's novel.
I:8652;1521;John Williams's unforgettable score and Spielberg's clever mounting of suspense recall the best of Hitchcock, and Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw make up an unlikely but appealing trio of protagonists.
I:8652;1522;Jaws broke box office records BECAUSE people of ALL AGES found it amazing.
I:8652;1523;It succeeded because all aspects of the filmmaking process were done excellently.
I:8652;1524;He softened the characters making them more likable.
I:8652;1525;He obviously changed the ending to make it more spectacular.
I:8652;1526;Perfect casting choices all around, from the 3 leads to the smallest part (secretary Polly is a riot with that voice).
I:8652;1527;Beautiful beach is made ominous at night.
I:8652;1528;this is one of my favorite movies, I usually watch it around the fourth of July.
I:8652;1529;That aside, enjoy this marvelous film that will make you feel you are on that boat, that beach, or most chillingly, in the water.
I:8652;1530;DTS really makes the movie come alive.
I:8652;1531;Can you remember a film that actually touched a nerve with the public?
I:8652;1532;But come on, you can always sell it and shell out 16 bucks for this.
I:8652;1533;and enjoy the reason people escape into movies.
I:8652;1534;Jaws is one of those movies that is ALWAYS entertaining to watch, no matter how many times you watch it.
I:8652;1535;But the suprising part of this film is the humor.
I:8652;1536;Very well acted by all parties, and what can you say about Speilberg's direction?
I:8652;1537;It is all very human.
I:8652;1538;Quints telling about the story of the USS Indianapolis is one of the greatest speeches in any movie, emotionally powerful.
I:8652;1539;The print is clear, and the sound clean.
I:8652;1540;The extras on the disc are a great asset, and only make a great movie better after watching them.
I:8652;1541;JAWS is one of those movies that really strikes the viewers as classic.
I:8652;1542;It is one of those movies that you will remember long after you watch it.
I:8652;1543;The scenes are really (well, its really a matter of opinion) really tense and, at the least, suspenseful.
I:8652;1544;i would strongly recommend this movie if you like the whole action.
I:8652;1545;Jaws directed by Spielberg is so well known it hardly needs an introduction.
I:8652;1546;When you think of the 1970s this film always comes to mind.
I:8652;1547;Saturday Night Fever may have been the favorite of the trendoids but this was undoubtedly the greatest film of the decade.
I:8652;1548;I remember being on the beach and the radio was playing over the public address system.
I:8652;1549;It speaks volumes for the film that every film production class studies it at one time or another.
I:8652;1550;It strikes a chord with everybody who sees it.
I:8652;1551;Brilliantly directed with competent acting performances this is a film which automatically qualifies for the time capsule of the 20th Century.
I:8652;1552;The transfer was nice but the extra features weren't fantastic.
I:8652;1553;available interview with Steven Spielberg.
I:8652;1554;available interview with Steven Spielberg.
I:8652;1555;And it's part of a documentary, which means .
I:8652;1556;jaws Archives Take a peak inside the Jaws archives including storyboards, production photos, and marketing materials, as well as a special segment on the Jaws phenomenon.
I:8652;1557;wording previous content to make it appear fresh and new.
I:8652;1558;(E. g. Saving Private Ryan, Saving Private Ryan Collector's DTS Edition, and D. day Commemorative Edition, which didn't even include the DTS track!)
I:8652;1559;It's clear as day that the companies are just after money, and Spielberg's popularity is letting them do this.
I:8652;1560;This is my favorite movie of all time and also the first I ever saw at the tender age of 4.
I:8652;1561;THe acting is good, the story is great, and the action is top notch.
I:8652;1562;The deleted scenes are kind of funny, especially the one with Quint mimicking a young boy playing an instrument.
I:8652;1563;The documentary shows how hard the film was to make, yet the success obviously eased the pain.
I:8652;1564;I cant say enough about this movie so go get it now!
I:8652;1565;enter Steven Spielbery, Carl Gottleib, John Williams and their band of merry men.
I:8652;1566;These people trimmed a lot of the aforementioned gore and sex and political malarkey from the book and what they came up with a very lean, tight and gripping suspense story.
I:8652;1567;You don't even get to see the shark in his entirety until well over an hour into the film, and the fact that the shark's first appearance is preceeded by a very funny line of dialogue makes the effect triply powerful.
I:8652;1568;"This film does of course has it's ""blood and guts"" moments."
I:8652;1569;done as in the novel.
I:8652;1570;peter Benchley and Carl Gottleib wrote the script here and the dialogue is 100% compelling and effective.
I:8652;1571;No matter how good a script is you NEED good actors to pull it off.
I:8652;1572;The chemistry they have on screen is evident.
I:8652;1573;Brody is the normal guy we all identify with that goes above and beyond the call of duty to save his town and conquer his fear of the water.
I:8652;1574;Hooper is a young, wise rich.
I:8652;1575;mouthed sea dog that you LOVE to hate but he's cool in his own way and you sympathize with him as he faces his destiny in the film.
I:8652;1576;The theme he wrote for the shark is of course, classic stuff.
I:8652;1577;It crackles with tension and adventure.
I:8652;1578;"The scene for the preparation of Hooper's diving cage features a brilliant cello melody that gives a real sense of ""Okay, now we bring the war to the shark, go get 'em Hooper!"""
I:8652;1579;The music throughout all the beach sequences and the final hunt for the shark has touches of lighthearted playfulness, nail.
I:8652;1580;biting horror, and lots of rousing adventure and mystery.
I:8652;1581;Kudos for a job well done.
I:8652;1582;in short this film has everything a great film should.
I:8652;1583;A very intense and involving story of man vs. a force of nature gone totally berserk.
I:8652;1584;A wonderful script and some of the BEST acting to date in ANY horror, suspense, drama, or adventure movie.
I:8652;1585;The TNT network has run this film many times over the last few years, and the copy they show has been beautifully restored and the color tweaked a bit.
I:8652;1586;We should be able to let our kids experience it that way, much like George Lucas did when he re.
I:8652;1587;There is at least one generation of people who never got to see JAWS 20 feet high and 48 feet across.
I:8652;1588;The trio of seamen that attempt to destroy the beast is perfect filmmaking.
I:8652;1589;This Spielberg mega classic still has the same effect on this viewer nearly four decades after I saw it for the first time the summer it came out.
I:8652;1590;This movie has good acting, the movie is frightening, the characters are memorable, and the script is excellent.
I:8652;1591;You need to see this blockbuster mega classic.
I:8652;1592;the presentation of the film itself is outstanding.
I:8652;1593;i am also amused that this is rated PG.
I:8652;1594;good film to add to your library, just remember.
I:8652;1595;A perfect marriage of mystery, suspense, action, horror, and romance.
I:8652;1596;The romance of Hooper and the ocean, and even the romance of Quint and the shark.
I:8652;1597;the film is a breathtaking homage to Hitchcockian thrillers.
I:8652;1598;Jaws was my favorite film as a child and still ranks as one of my all.
I:8652;1599;In on scene, the man with the gun holds the gun, and shortly after pulls the trigger, firing a bullet into the man and killing him.
I:8652;1600;The suspense builds and builds and builds, yet the man does not fire.
I:8652;1601;"Sometimes, it's scarier to imagine the hunter than actually seeing it, and that is what makes ""Jaws"" such an amazing film."
I:8652;1602;The colors are rich and vibrant, and the fine detail that is present is incredible.
I:8652;1603;I have personally seen 'Jaws' well over 100 times in my lifetime and I can easily say that the film has NEVER looked better.
I:8652;1604;This movie is an original, great to watch.
I:8652;1605;Jaws(1975) is a classic Steven Spielberg movie based on the suspense novel by Peter Benchley.
I:8652;1606;In the Jaws movies, Ellen Brody is a more sympathetic character.
I:8652;1607;John Williams' music score for Jaws is a classic in itself.
I:8652;1608;Jaws(1975) is a classic Hollywood movie.
I:8652;1609;It is an excellent adaptation of a pretty good book.
I:8652;1610;Universal has put together a very pleasing presentation of this classic film.
I:8652;1611;Along with that, we have a 60 minute documentary, The Making of Jaws , which includes interviews with Steven Spielberg, Roy Scheider Richard Dreyfuss and deleted scenes with outtakes.
I:8652;1612;"like I said previously, the film is presented in an anamorphic widescreen format, with very natural looking colors and few artifacts
I:8652;1613;Both soundtracks sound very good, with the dts soundtrack having an edge in the low frequency effects and surround activity.
I:8652;1614;the extras are well presented.
I:8652;1615;The trailers look good, and the numerous production photos will be enough to whet even the most ravenous appetite of any JAWS fan.
I:8652;1616;perhaps one of the most anticipated parts of the disc is the documentary.
I:8652;1617;It includes most of the better parts of the original documentary, but it still would have been nice to fit the entire 2 hour one on the disc.
I:8652;1618;kudos to Spielberg Universal for an excellent job!
I:8652;1619;rod Steiger is excellent and so is dreyfuss and who can forget the captain and Jaws!I still dislike Spielberg but love this movie.
I:8652;1620;The New England island community of Amity is gearing up for the summer tourist season with high hopes.
I:8652;1621;jaws was a major blockbuster in its day and still holds up pretty well.
I:8652;1622;The acting is strong whether talking about the stars or the supporting cast.
I:8652;1623;John Shaw attacks his role with particularly gusto and the script offers him many of the best lines.
I:8652;1624;jaws isn't perfect, but it is an enjoyable film.
I:8652;1625;It was one of the films that created the whole concept of summer blockbusters and those who haven't seen it should check it out just for its historical significance.
I:8652;1626;Beyond that, it's second half provides a suspenseful thrill ride as the struggle of man vs. shark unfolds.
I:8652;1627;Great Plot, cast, and photography with peerless direction.
I:8652;1628;Jaws is a great horror movie because its true that sharks eat people.
I:8652;1629;The movie is a classic, but the high def didnt seem to me to be all that great, overall four stars
I:8652;1630;I love Jaws, and this made me happy.
I:8652;1631;The film is about a town.
I:8652;1632;It is about a traditional sea of income, and the shark swallows the hope of needy men and women.
I:8652;1633;Man's survival through another's decline is one significant theme.
I:8652;1634;The shark, I believe can be symbolic for a moment.
I:8652;1635;He loves this movie and enjoys watching it often.
I:8652;1636;Also the prices are very reasonable.
I:8652;1637;A shark is chompy the people.
I:8652;1638;Better than the classic 1960 horror movie that inspires this genre of monstres.
I:8652;1639;quint is herilious he made me laugh.
I:8652;1640;This movie has some comedy as well.
I:8652;1641;Watch The Deep Blue Sea.
I:8652;1642;This also contains many of the deleted scenes which (although clearly left out for a reason) are still quite enjoyable to watch.
I:8652;1643;In my opinion one of the greatest movies of all time.
I:8652;1644;A book and movie that hit a nerve.
I:8652;1645;To this day Jaws is still part of our American culture, especially the music.
I:8652;1646;A fast paced movie, a complete movie with great acting.
I:8652;1647;This movie is a realistic account of a rogue shark terrorizing a New England resort (in book its a Long Island town) that is scary, full of suspense and fun.
I:8652;1648;While the ending with the oxygen tank is very Hollywood, its simply a movie for the ages.
I:8652;1649;For example with shark week and all those jumping great white shots and others photos, compared them to some shots in Jaws and even the outtakes.
I:8652;1650;You will see what a good job they did.
I:8652;1651;The best movie of the 1970s.
I:8652;1652;This is a true classic movie with outstanding actors.
I:8652;1653;Even after 40 years I'm still glued to the movie.
I:8652;1654;As near perfect a movie could be!
I:8652;1655;Jaws is definitely one of the great summer movies of all time.
I:8652;1656;Though the shark looks fake, there is character development and genuine thrills in this film that most modern.
I:8652;1657;Not just a shark movie, it has excellent characters and actors.
I:8652;1658;their stories unfold nicely between shark attacks and this makes for a very interesting and engrossing movie.
I:8652;1659;I think everyone will agree that this movie is a classic.
I:8652;1660;I grew up watching these movies and still enjoy them.
I:8652;1661;The special effects are pretty good given the age of the movie.
I:8652;1662;All in all this movie is great and will continue to be so for a long time.
I:8652;1663;This is one of the most superb films ever made.
I:8652;1664;Spielburg out did himself in this masterpiece.
I:8652;1665;This film held on to drama while still dispensing bone chilling fear.
I:8652;1666;The outtakes and trivia game are wonderful.
I:8652;1667;I recomend this film to you without reservation.
I:8652;1668;Entertaining movie that scared lots of people from going into the ocean when it first came out.
I:8652;1669;good special effects for it's time
I:8652;1670;Absolutely one of the very best in shark drama, pure classic, audiences will love and also remember this one for a very long time to come, depite it's compititions.
I:8652;1671;Unforgettable soundtrack (Theme from Jaws),brilliant plot ( man X mighty wild nature),one of the greatest and most creative directors of all times,great effects and tons of tension,extraordinary cast.
I:8652;1672;this is JAWS!It's a unique experience .
I:8652;1673;It will be certainly remembered in the 21st,22nd and all other centuries to come.
I:8652;1674;it's a classic about our greatest fears: hydrophobia!
I:8652;1675;This is definitely a classic movie.
I:8652;1676;One of my favorites to watch any time.
I:8652;1677;A year or two later I got to see the original Jaws when it was re.
I:8652;1678;I was genuinely enthralled by this landmark classic as a kid and to this day Jaws hasn't lost any of its bite!It's simply amazing what Steven Spielberg pulled off despite the legendary problems that was faced throughout the production of the film.
I:8652;1679;This adventure/horror story based on Peter Benchley's original novel, is exciting, terrifying and even funny.
I:8652;1680;Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and the late Robert Shaw made a unlikely but highly memorable team as they went about hunting down a 25 ft 3 ton Great White Shark named Bruce.
I:8652;1681;Jaws is filled with memorable images and scenes from the opening credits to the very end.
I:8652;1682;a combination of skilled direction and editing, terrific acting, and a highly charged and unforgettable music score by John Williams create of the greatest films of all times.
I:8652;1683;Jaws still delivers the goods 25 years later.
I:8652;1684;It is certainly deserving of it's classic status.
I:8652;1685;Always fun to sit down and watch this movie.
I:8652;1686;One the best films ever made.
I:8652;1687;A great cast and holds up after all these years.
I:8652;1688;this is a classic movie that as a film maker i needed in my collection the fact that i needed to teach a class made me have the urge to show case it.
I:8652;1689;thank you for the timely delivery!
I:8652;1690;This is the original shark tale.
I:8652;1691;My friends and I watched it together and really loved it.
I:8652;1692;The action is great even though it is a bit implausible.
I:8652;1693;The movie is fabulous and a classic.
I:8652;1694;Loved this when it came out when I was a kid and love it now!
I:8652;1695;This is a great summer movie!
I:8652;1696;My grandkids had never seen this movie so I bought it as a gift.
I:8652;1697;It was an early example of Spielberg's great work and even greater work to come.
I:8652;1698;I remember seeing this film in the summer of 1975 with my wife and a group of friends who all felt we had watched something very special at the time.
I:8652;1699;"this was one of the first films to take advantage of full size ""robotic"" animals, but it was good film technique and editing that made the movie work as the mechanical shark was very difficult to operate."
I:8652;1700;A good documentary was included with this package.
I:8652;1701;It is a worthwhile re.
I:8652;1702;recorded soundtrack and the abridged documentary, this disc is well worth the double.
I:8652;1703;marketed VHS title, simply with new box artwork, and possibly some cross.
I:8652;1704;issuing its animated classics every 7 years both theatrically and on home video for a new generation of potential fans, so don't be so quick to judge any studio that uses a number to re.
I:8652;1705;issue a classic film for a new generation of consumers.
I:8652;1706;was then, and still is an all time classic!
I:8652;1707;My kids love to watch this oldy but goody.
I:8652;1708;If you need a movie to give your kids a good scare from a classic or you need a go.
I:8652;1709;"to because nothing else is on, or you need the stuffing scared out of you one more time, ""Jaws"" fits the bill every time."
I:8652;1710;some odd years, this is still my top rated scary movie.
I:8652;1711;One of those movies that you like to see again.
I:8652;1712;The script has even had an impact on our language today.
I:8652;1713;Jaws remains one of my favorite films of all.
I:8652;1714;It's the movie that jump started Steven Spielberg career as a filmmaker.
I:8652;1715;universal Studios Home Entertainment did a great job at restoring this film on Blu.
I:8652;1716;One of the greatest movies of all time without a doubt!
I:8652;1717;This is a must see!
I:8652;1718;This is a classic thriller!
I:8652;1719;The scores play a key role in scaring people.
I:8652;1720;The price was just about the best I found on the net.
I:8652;1721;This movie will always remain a classic for all time.
I:8652;1722;This is one of those movies that it doesn't matter how many times it comes on, it's good everytime.
I:8652;1723;And this movie is a classic!
I:8652;1724;The horror and suspense that Spielberg creates is incredible and no one can do it like him.
I:8652;1725;Jaws is literally the original blockbuster movie.
I:8652;1726;Spielberg did a good job in building the suspense by not overtly showing the shark in the first half of the movie, only its victims (or remnants of them).
I:8652;1727;In this regard it is as good or better than any Hitchcock movie.
I:8652;1728;all the actors did a tremendous job.
I:8652;1729;This movie is the absolute best movie ever made.
I:8652;1730;I can only hope they will bring it back to the theater again.
I:8652;1731;Every summer it is a must to watch at least one of the movies in the Jaws collection.
I:8652;1732;I can't help but wonder how CGI could make the shark look more realistic.
I:8652;1733;This is the first classic animal film to be remembered for generations to come!
I:8652;1734;Lots of blood and guts!
I:8652;1735;Jaws has always been one of my favorite movies and now I own it.
I:8652;1736;Thank you for shipping it so quickly and in excellent condition.
I:8652;1737;excellent picture on the blu.
I:8652;1738;With JAWS, Steven Spielberg burst upon the Hollywood scene, coincidentally inventing the summer blockbuster (for a while it was the highest.
I:8652;1739;lest you wonder, JAWS is sci.
I:8652;1740;"dum"" theme is familiar enough a part of popular culture to make swimmers look around nervously 'til today."
I:8652;1741;"Every sailor knows the scat dialogue, ""Get away from that radio!"""
I:8652;1742;quite possibly one of the ten best films of all time, JAWS entertains immensely even a third of a century later.
I:8652;1743;No doubt one of the top 10 greatest movies of all time!
I:8652;1744;This film was a masterpiece of suspense.
I:8652;1745;i remember seeing it in the summer of '75.
I:8652;1746;Being a New England Native, it's also fun to play Spot the Martha's Vineyard Beaches.
I:8652;1747;Great performances by all, especially Richard Dreyfuss.
I:8652;1748;This is an excellent example of a great movie which will be enjoyed generation after generation.
I:8652;1749;Universal has spend a great amount of money and time, to ensure that picture perfect for Blue Ray release.
I:8652;1750;The theme music is also one of the greatest movie sound track.
I:8652;1751;storyline is simple and clear with great acting from all the leads.
I:8652;1752;It is far better from CGI images as compared with modern movies making as all the stuff are real.
I:8652;1753;It deserves a place in all movies lover's home again with this Blue Ray release.
I:8652;1754;This strategy is left unexplored in Jaws, lauded as the first great summer blockbuster, and the highest.
I:8652;1755;edge animatronic robot named Bruce.
I:8652;1756;"Spending the summer in the Hamptons was a mark of status
I:8652;1757;She was a summer person, but fell in love and moved to Amity permanently, despite the scorn of her upper.
I:8652;1758;He reminds her of the world of wealth and privilege she left behind.
I:8652;1759;Robert Shaw as the professional fisherman, brought in to slay the shark, is perfect .
I:8652;1760;ray remaster is fantastic and worth every dollar you may pay for it.
I:8652;1761;I mean this with all my heart.
I:8652;1762;this was such a good movie Spielberg did a great job with it this is the best jaws movie in the franchise.
I:8652;1763;In some ways i recommend the 30th anniversary widescreen edition rather than the fullscreen anniversary collectors edition because the bonus features in the 30th anniversary widescreen edition are longer.
I:8652;1764;jaws was a phenomenom when it came out in 1975 and it still a fabulous movie.
I:8652;1765;Spielberg can thank bruce the shark for what he has become thanks to this film and the producers Richard Zanuck and David Brown.
I:8652;1766;Big sharks, dismemberment, salty sea captains.
I:8652;1767;It was a fav back in the day and now I get to enjoy with my children!
I:8652;1768;I was born in the 70's and have always loved JAWS!
I:8652;1769;stuff's gotta add up, right?
I:8652;1770;They did a great job re.
I:8652;1771;The anamorphic picture is great and reconstructing the soundtrack in DTS was terrific.
I:8652;1772;Overall I was impressed with the effort they put into enhancing the detail and coloring of the film.
I:8652;1773;I mean, for a 37 year old movie, they did a great job!
I:8652;1774;Well, this is definetly a classic in the horror world.
I:8652;1775;And if there's anything memorable about this movie, its the sountrack.
I:8652;1776;I also love the fact that an additional Blu.
I:8652;1777;I received this item in perfect condition, in a timely manner, and watched the movie as soon as it arrived.
I:8652;1778;I would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it.
I:8652;1779;Jaws is one of my favorite movies .
I:8652;1780;this is a edited movie version and not the original.
I:8652;1781;Was very glad to see it was available from amazon in digital format.
I:8652;1782;Always loved this movie and now I am so glad it is on blu.
I:8652;1783;I would absolutely recommend this movie to anyone.
I:8652;1784;Jaws is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8652;1785;Great memories of this movie.
I:8652;1786;Delivery and customer service was excellent.
I:8652;1787;Jaws might be one of my favorite films.
I:8652;1788;Really, it's a masterpiece of story telling and as director Steven Spielberg often states, full of happy accidents.
I:8652;1789;Remastered in 5.1 with new effects added.
I:8652;1790;The interview extra with the cast members was great.
I:8652;1791;The movie continues to make us jump and turn our heads.
I:8652;1792;This format is the BEST way to go, best way to watch a movie, especially with a 60.
I:8652;1793;If you're a die hard fan of movies, WS (Widescreen) is the best way!
I:8652;1794;And a big fan of Steven Spielberg!
I:8652;1795;I even got to hold an Oscar that night!
I:8652;1796;"Caught him while he was running up the steps onto the stage, and I said ""Mr, Spielberg"", he turned around, I shook his hand, and just told him that I think he is the greatest director and that he is my favorite, and to keep up the excellent work!"
I:8652;1797;This film WILL scare you!
I:8652;1798;"This movie ""rocks"", it is EXCELLENT, and THE BEST ."
I:8652;1799;And I will argue that point to the day I die!
I:8652;1800;Spielberg continually criticizes his choice to film on the sea and even the making of the film but I believe that he succeeded beyond his wildest imagaination.
I:8652;1801;The suspense, the feeling that something big is going to happen, something that really hits home (it could really and truly happen.)
I:8652;1802;When you compile the best Horror movies of all time there are some great ones.
I:8652;1803;Dracula, Frankenstein, Halloween and scores of others.
I:8652;1804;The one that really stands out in my mind is JAWS (the original.)
I:8652;1805;The Original worked not just because of a great story written by Peter Benchley but because on a great cast of actors.
I:8652;1806;Every scene in the movie is very believable and is just captivating.
I:8652;1807;Jaws has it all, sure it's scary, but it is very funny, sympathetic, exciting too.
I:8652;1808;it also takes place on and in real water in a real ocean.
I:8652;1809;the charecters are memorable, and developed and perfectly cast.
I:8652;1810;This classic of the genre is a must.
I:8652;1811;The animatronic shark still holds up well against today's special effects.
I:8652;1812;Spielberg is a master .
I:8652;1813;great movie, I still remember when I went to see it in the orginal theatrical release.
I:8652;1814;Good extras, but still a time tested classic.
I:8652;1815;The picture transfer is really, really good and so is the audio.
I:8652;1816;the original, the best, and you need this!
I:8652;1817;Our introductory characters are doing what all young adults do, partying and having fun, never imagining the menace lurking.
I:8652;1818;"in its own way, this movie combines the drama of ""The Old Man and the Sea,"" with far more action, and the thrill of a well."
I:8652;1819;This movie, while involving a host of protagonists, is ultimately a battle between Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) and a great white shark, which represents not only itself, but all Brody's personal demons.
I:8652;1820;it is amazing that a mechanical shark could generate such terror.
I:8652;1821;Stephen Spielberg used clever camera work in combination with the intensity of each shark appearance to keep your focus on the story and being held in suspense, completely ignoring whatever flaws there may have been in his excellent mechanical monster.
I:8652;1822;what enhances the terror of the shark attacks is that they occur at a public beach where millions journey each year.
I:8652;1823;The audience knows what is coming and yet the innocents on the beach insist on throwing themselves into harm's way.
I:8652;1824;the final sequence in the movie is excellent and provides an inexorable buildup to the climax, fast yet slow.
I:8652;1825;This sequence also provides what is probably the goriest portion of the movie.
I:8652;1826;This movie is still suspenseful and well worth watching more than 30 years after its release.
I:8652;1827;One of the best monster movies ever, and just enough basis in reality to be considered a drama as well.
I:8652;1828;Five stars for a movie you can watch over and over again.
I:8652;1829;I have always loved Jaws.
I:8652;1830;It is spectacular, just crystal clear!
I:8652;1831;ray of this version ASAP!
I:8652;1832;Without a doubt one of the best movies ever made.
I:8652;1833;All the great reviews pretty much say it all.
I:8652;1834;Let's just keep our fingers crossed.
I:8652;1835;We got a new television and system and picked up this blue.
I:8652;1836;Detail, color and clarity were fantastic.
I:8652;1837;Picture perfect after all these years.

I:8652;1841;ray with the original masterpiece.
I:8652;1842;Lets face it, even the people who haven't seen JAWS are still humming that unforgettable eerie theme.
I:8652;1843;It's that feeling watching JAWS gives you.
I:8652;1844;That tense, anxious, painfully exciting, agonizing joy where you can feel your heart pounding right through your chest.
I:8652;1845;A happy summer beach town gets hit with a leathal shark attack just off it's beach.
I:8652;1846;all in all this is a great film, filled with thrills, romance, comedy.
I:8652;1847;It's a true american classic that is to be shared with generations and generations to come.
I:8652;1848;This presentation, with the uncut 2 hour classic documentary from the collectable laserdisc along with deleted scenes and a slew of production extras, AND a collectible book.
I:8652;1849;The formats are going to be constantly changing and new editions are going to be getting released and re.
I:8652;1850;Again, I am happy that Universal put out this new edition and will happily support it.
I:8652;1851;The 20th anniversary laserdisc included it all.
I:8652;1852;anyway, the movie is great.
I:8652;1853;I think it's Spielberg at his best.
I:8652;1854;i remember goin to see Jaws 2 with my Dad and my brother.
I:8652;1855;ever since seeing Jaws I've had a interest in sharks.
I:8652;1856;i rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!
I:8652;1857;I love this movie, I always have.
I:8652;1858;What was interesting was showing this to my Grandson and seeing his reaction.
I:8652;1859;this is a movie you can learn from and have some fun watching and be able to watch over and over
I:8652;1860;The final shark scene is the best!
I:8652;1861;Quick and easy on the kindle or computer.
I:8652;1862;I enjoy watching this movie when I'm depressed, the suspense in it is very exhilarating and at times Roy Scheider can be a bit funny.
I:8652;1863;This version has a much clearer picture, better sound, and a spectacular image.
I:8652;1864;"The first summer blockbuster
I:8652;1865;It was an incredible opportunity to find out about all facets of the making of this classic and to meet the production people involved, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
I:8652;1866;Although it is short, it's very interesting to hard core Jaws fans.
I:8652;1867;There are a few bits of additional deleted scenes and outtakes which have been added to what we got five years ago.
I:8652;1868;"It is nice to have the complete two hour ""making of"" documentary now."
I:8652;1869;The DTS is very special, but the purist in me really enjoyed the mono from the good ole days of 1975 when I first saw the film.
I:8652;1870;Needless to say the shark is rubber and not very good, but the film itself is so brilliant you hardly realise it.
I:8652;1871;nice job on the blue ray.
I:8652;1872;A great movie, of course, too.
I:8652;1873;First scene is very cool in blue ray.
I:8652;1874;"when Spielberg did it again with ""Raiders"" and ""E. t.""I envy the person watching ""Jaws"" for the first time."
I:8652;1875;ride of the highest possible magnitude.
I:8652;1876;Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw bring their vivid characters to life .
I:8652;1877;the police chief who moved to the small beach community to escape the excitement of New York, the geeky scientist shark.
I:8652;1878;expert and the salty old fisherman.
I:8652;1879;The results are edge of your seat, white knuckle tension.
I:8652;1880;all of these principles made other fine movies .
I:8652;1881;If you consider this movie as a Horror or an Adventure movie, it is still great.
I:8652;1882;The movie is about a 25 foot Great White Shark(Bruce) that terrorizes a Summer resort town.
I:8652;1883;Jaws is a classic seaworthy tale of a dangerous man.
I:8652;1884;jaws has spectacular effects for that time.
I:8652;1885;As much as I absolutely love computer effects, you can't replace the horrifying shark named Jaws.
I:8652;1886;I loved this movie as a kid, and I think it held up well over time.
I:8652;1887;The shark looked cute on the cover but when I watched the movie and saw what it did to people I soiled myself!
I:8652;1888;Speilberg's cocky youthful directing mixed with a juicy plot and a divinely inspired performance from Robert Shaw make for a timeless film.
I:8652;1889;lines, facial expressions, even LAUGHS!
I:8652;1890;Loved it the first time I saw this in 1975 and still love it now.
I:8652;1891;Now I'm sharing it with my family.
I:8652;1892;Ignoring the fact that this is a great film, I'd just like to affirm what others are saying.
I:8652;1893;ups you can count hairs and pores , and unlike so many older films, the colors are not washed out, but are (with a few exceptions) vibrant and natural.
I:8652;1894;This started the series of great films that came from Steven Speilberg.
I:8652;1895;Plot, action, suspense and thrills .
I:8652;1896;Get your popcorn ready and enjoy!
I:8652;1897;This is a movie classic and a must have for any collection.
I:8652;1898;So much better than discovery, at least with this you know it is fiction from the beginning.
I:8652;1899;Although I Don't know why this was voted most scariest movie.
I:8652;1900;Jaws is back in 2001 with it's new special edition and telling finally that they had to make it before July.
I:8652;1901;helps it was 1 of my all time favs.
I:8652;1902;A classic thriller that is semi.
I:8652;1903;based on a true story and with a music score that is sure to bring chills to anyone who hears the music.
I:8652;1904;This is a good movie to have at home.
I:8652;1905;The acting in this movie is excellent and the huge great white shark was the best in the movie.
I:8652;1906;Steven Spielberg did an excellent job of making this movie and the actors did a wonderful job.
I:8652;1907;Over the years, this movie became my #1 favorite movie of all time, supplanting Star Wars.
I:8652;1908;The performances in this film are top notch.
I:8652;1909;Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and especially Robert Shaw expertly bring their characters to vivid life.
I:8652;1910;the Blu Ray video is excellent and the sound is top notch.
I:8652;1911;Narrated by Scheider, it provides an in.
I:8652;1912;With a movie that brings out true emotion with you and especially what it's aiming for you know it has done its job.
I:8652;1913;This is the 30th anniversary of one of the greatest films of all time, by perhaps the greatest director of all time.
I:8652;1914;Be happy it's the 30th anniversary, look back and remember why you love it so.
I:8652;1915;The movie is very good and the behind the secens are eve just as good this is one of the best movie editions ever!
I:8652;1916;I remember seeing it on television a few months before and thought it was a great movie, although it scared me when the boy was eaten.
I:8652;1917;time favorite movies (though it would have been better if the shark's presence was more suggested and you only saw the mechanical shark when you had to).
I:8652;1918;Because it is a great action film!
I:8652;1919;This movie set the standard for the summer blockbuster, in fact, it created the summer blockbuster event.
I:8652;1920;Make no mistake, this is an action/thriller, but it has a lot of humor in it and the characters grow, evolved tthroughout the movie and you get to feel for them.
I:8652;1921;Up to that point, all you see is hints and clues of its presence.
I:8652;1922;See 'Deep Blue Sea' for example.
I:8652;1923;I was very surprised at how good the picture was.
I:8652;1924;ray will make you fall in love with it all over!
I:8652;1925;Everyone's so disgruntled at the release of a 30th anniversary edition of one of the greatest adventure films ever made.
I:8652;1926;I've only seen Jaws once, and that was many years ago, and my friend and me spent the entire time talking throughout it.
I:8652;1927;My mum loves the movie, and she owns the sequels, but I've just never got round to watching it.
I:8652;1928;Disappointed, slightly, but the rest of the movie was still good.
I:8652;1929;Brody, played by Roy Schneider, was excellent, as was the supporting cast, although I didn't know any of them.
I:8652;1930;Predator for example, is a lot more scarier, than if we'd actually seen the Predator more.
I:8652;1931;jaws has held its own, against many other contendors/spoofs over the years, and has proved to be very successful.
I:8652;1932;I wasn't even around (never mind thought of) when it was first released, and I enjoyed it.
I:8652;1933;Jaws will always be loved by generations old and new.
I:8652;1934;Special effects were great too.
I:8652;1935;jaws is in fact one of my favorite movies, it has a raw quanity that makes you scared.
I:8652;1936;the movie is about a resort town terrorrized by a great white shark.
I:8652;1937;the terror is big and the sequences are breathtaeking, this will remain one of the best creature movie made.
I:8652;1938;the condition of the movie was great and received in a timely manner.
I:8652;1939;It is nonstop action from there on out.
I:8652;1940;the special effects in this movie add to the scary influence of themonster shark.
I:8652;1941;There are many struggles with the killer shark.
I:8652;1942;the ending of the movie is truly worth waiting for.
I:8652;1943;this is anoutstanding movie that you will indeed enjoy watching.
I:8652;1944;Classicis the perfect word for this movie.
I:8652;1945;jaws is pretty much a perfect movie in every way possible.
I:8652;1946;The casting and acting are perfect.
I:8652;1947;top, and not only do the actor's give great performances but you actually start to care and feel for them unlike many movie's nowaday's.
I:8652;1948;My point is, Jaws is a realistic film that, like real life, is not alway's perfect.
I:8652;1949;"now I will talk about my favorite thing about Jaws
I:8652;1950;Mixing shot's of real life footage of shark's, puppetry, prosthetic's, and editing to make a very scary and beleivable shark.
I:8652;1951;it actually took some talent to create realistic special effect's.
I:8652;1952;It add's a lot of suspense to an already suspenseful movie and is some of the best music in movie history.
I:8652;1953;* I notice a lot of people complaining about this 30th anniversary edition because of the realease of the 25th special edition a 5 year's ago with basically the same special feature's, except for the DTS audio track's and a 2 hour documentary.
I:8652;1954;release movie's with more and more extra's as they come along.
I:8652;1955;I have seen this movie at least 50 times and loved it every time.
I:8652;1956;My Son loved it so much he became an expert on sharks.
I:8652;1957;best movie of this kind ever.
I:8652;1958;Amazing direction, script, acting, cinematography, score and editing remain impeccable!
I:8652;1959;Two great feature length documentaries are included in this set.
I:8652;1960;I have watched this movie over and over, and will continue to do so.
I:8652;1961;to tech), but it is still a great movie to own.
I:8652;1962;A classic movie,only they should have made it Megalodon size!!!
I:8652;1963;generation print for this beautiful transfer, as this is truly one of their landmark, groundbreaking, legacy releases.
I:8652;1964;There's a REASON this film scored record.
I:8652;1965;office, Oscar accolades and critical reviews.
I:8652;1966;It is a timeless classic!The 7.1 surround sound is expansive.
I:8652;1967;"sounding mix overall, but many Jaws fans, like myself, will actually PREFER the mono track, for really hearing John Williams' music, and for restoring Jaws to its classic, legendary, ""nightmarish summer of 1975 horror film"" status."
I:8652;1968;"tale ""thump thump"" music, and text saying ""This summer."
I:8652;1969;"Especially amusing is JawsFest, a reunion at Martha's Vineyard, where fans got to meet cast members, touch the mechanical shark in its original mold, and see Jaws projected on a giant screen right in front of the water, the docks of ""Amity"", where Jaws was filmed!"
I:8652;1970;hard fans recite their favorite lines with the film, Rocky Horror Picture.
I:8652;1971;style, is a real treat!
I:8652;1972;that plays at the end of every (TV) 'House' series episode is from this movie!I also agree with S. s. when he says he was glad the shark was broken so much since being unable to film numerous scenes made the suspense build more and better.
I:8652;1973;This was a surprise Christmas gift for a fine neighbor.
I:8652;1974;When he opened it up, he gave out a wild whoop and yelp of delight.
I:8652;1975;Guess I made the right choice.
I:8652;1976;A great movie to watch while sipping a peaty, smoky Irish whiskey such as Connemara.
I:8652;1977;This is liking watching a brand new movie, with a sharp sound track and crystal clear picture.
I:8652;1978;Highly recommended for all JAWS fans.
I:8652;1979;Jaws is one of the best movies ever and definately on my top 3 list.
I:8652;1980;I've seen this film countless times and it's one of the few films that I can watch over and over again and right when I finish watching it, I want to watch it again.
I:8652;1981;If you are an aspiring filmmaker and do NOT like this movie, please change professions now.
I:8652;1982;Trust me, watch this movie more than once.
I:8652;1983;Most of them take the original sound effects, music and dialog and give some spaciousness to them.
I:8652;1984;release after 5 years corrects all the issues that fans of the movie had with the first release and has a nice little book to go along with it.
I:8652;1985;It really makes you feel the terror and suspense of the movie, even though I've seen it dozens of times.
I:8652;1986;In our lives we come across great books, great films, great plays.
I:8652;1987;This movie is simply one of the greatest movies ever made, put it on the same shelf as The Godfather and The Godfather II.
I:8652;1988;After his 2nd feature film, young director Steven Spielberg took up the task of filming Jaws.
I:8652;1989;changing shooting schedule and a shark that didn't work, Spielberg did finish it, and used his images and John William's 2.
I:8652;1990;our story takes place on the island of Amity, a small community where peace and tranquility reign, that is until the mangled corpse of a young woman is found on the beach.
I:8652;1991;This is mainly due to the fact that the peak of tourist season is about to arrive on Amity Island, and the townspeople need those dollars to pay through the winter months.
I:8652;1992;the movie works great because of what we don't see.
I:8652;1993;The rest is left to our imagination, the music, and the shark fin in the water.
I:8652;1994;The character's are also played to perfection.
I:8652;1995;Richard Dreyfuss as MAtt Hooper also plays up well with great lines, and one of his best roles to the time (his last being in American Graffiti.
I:8652;1996;The best of all horror / fantasy films.
I:8652;1997;The DTS sound makes the movie a fitting tribute to Spielberg's inspired direction.
I:8652;1998;See It Before You Go Back In The Water.
I:8652;1999;ray, but I do collect this memoribilea for fun.
I:8652;2000;This is spilburg at his best I just hope they do not remake this movie.
I:8652;2001;can you imagine a film being made today about a killer shark.
I:8652;2002;That makes it a true protagonist in a dramatic sense.
I:8652;2003;and a great counterpoint to today's action films, in which silly one.
I:8652;2004;liners and overacting count as great villainy.
I:8652;2005;it shows great faith in the intelligence of the moviegoer on Spielberg's part.
I:8652;2006;Jaws has other charms as well.
I:8652;2007;The performances are excellent, especially Robert Shaw's turn as the crusty, slightly crazy and ultimately very likeable Quint.
I:8652;2008;The scene in which he describes his experience with the sinking of the USS Indianapolis is absolutely riveting.
I:8652;2009;the John Williams score is a classic, and it's a tribute to the craft of the filmmakers that very few of the film's special effects (including the shark) look the least bit dated today.
I:8652;2010;all in all, this is a classic, but I don't need to tell you that.you've probably already seen it a few dozen times yourself.
I:8652;2011;This is still one of my favorites and you don't even see the shark for the first time till what, 50 mins in?
I:8652;2012;It would rate 5 stars , even if it was a new release today, great acting, action , special effects and directing
I:8652;2013;I have liked this ever since it was in the movie theaters in the 70's.
I:8652;2014;It still has the impact it had then.
I:8652;2015;JAWS stands as one of Hollywood's most important moments, being a certified blockbuster and ushering in the age of big thrills and terrible monsters.
I:8652;2016;Although monsters had been around a long time in the movies, Spielberg, with this being only his second theatrical release (following the commercial flop THE SUGERLAND EXPRESS, although critically it stands as a very fine moment in Spielberg's career), wisely tempers the monster with a first rate story and an uncanny sense of realism.
I:8652;2017;As he has only had one directorial film theatrically behind him and one TV movie called DUEL, this stands as even more impressive.
I:8652;2018;That is a credit to Spielberg.
I:8652;2019;The story is grisly and realistic in setting and tone, although when you know the true habits of sharks you realise this is very uncharacteristic of them and they would not behave that way in nature.
I:8652;2020;He meticulously crafts this to be a first rate thriller, and this, along with STAR WARS two years later, would pave the way for what is now called popcorn blockbusters.
I:8652;2021;just so Spielberg doesn't get all the credit, the cast turns in a great performance as well.
I:8652;2022;Robert Shaw makes a wonderful Quint, who adds that local colour to the movie, and the interaction between Sheider and Dreyfuss works magic on the screen as one who loves the water and sharks and the other who hates it.
I:8652;2023;The mayor also stands as a good post.
I:8652;2024;modern character, who, although he can be viewed as a man with dubious character, is acting in the best sense of the town, or so he thinks, garnering both sympathy and dislike as well.
I:8652;2025;Truly a suspenseful movie and very well.
I:8652;2026;It also shows what a talented movie.
I:8652;2027;And it also proves that technology (read STAR WARS: EPISODE I) proves no substitute for skillful movie making and a first rate story.
I:8652;2028;Other than that, it is nice to watch it in wide.
I:8652;2029;p. P. S. I don't know how this happened, but I forgot to mention John Williams, who has scored several of the top grossing films in our culture.
I:8652;2030;Everyone who knows even a little about movies will recognize the main theme.
I:8652;2031;So that ,in a nutshell, is what makes JAWS one of the best.
I:8652;2032;the Making Of is very interesting and with interviews from most of the people involved gives it the added touch.
I:8652;2033;i highly recommend this title as a must have for anyone interested in movies.
I:8652;2034;amazing howintimidated people can get from a really well made movie.
I:8652;2035;The new Blu Ray edition is beautifully done, no doubta new set of millions will be clinging to the sand this year.
I:8652;2036;This movie is a classic.
I:8652;2037;Jaws is a one of a kind Thriller.
I:8652;2038;Still love this movie, the fear of what we can't see, may be lurking underwater.
I:8652;2039;"Whenever I watch Jaws on TV, they always show the ""deleted scenes"" as part of the movie (I always crack."
I:8652;2040;up at Quint singing along to the boy playing the clarinet, and at the additional footage of the crack.
I:8652;2041;It also has 5.1 mixes in Spanish and French, and it has new subtitle options, also for Spanish and French.
I:8652;2042;It's an excellent documentary, worth seeing in its entirety, but if you're already well.
I:8652;2043;also new is a 9.
I:8652;2044;There's also a nice 60.
I:8652;2045;The visuals are stunning .
I:8652;2046;White Death, Great White Terror and Man.
I:8652;2047;eater are all names that have entered public vocabulary to describe the Great White Shark, one of the most efficient predators of the oceans.Yet, surprisingly, only very few people have actually encountered one, and fewer still had had the misfortune of been attacked by one, yet why is it that the name alone is enough to strike terror in our hearts and inspire awe and fascination?The answer is simple,Peter Benchley and Steven Spielberg.
I:8652;2048;the collaboration of a best selling author and a director at his creative best resulted in one of the all time classics of cinema, an original film that has spawned dozens of imitations, and one responsible for keeping a lot of viewers out of the waters for a while, afraid of Jaws.
I:8652;2049;the success of Jaws is due to many factors, all as important:The direction of Steven Spielberg is flawless, pushing the right buttons at every turn, starting with one of the best ever opening scenes in cinema history, then keeping the suspense brewing till amazingly appx.
I:8652;2050;the 81st minute before the shark shows its toothy grin!
I:8652;2051;The fact that this 'monster' was unseen for the largest part of the movie was a genuis decision from Spielberg and contributed to tickling our imagination, and increasing the tension.
I:8652;2052;it is by sheer good luck that Marvin and Meredith declined to take this role for varying reasons, for in my opinion no one could have played the experienced, weary and tough fisherman Quint better than Robert Shaw.
I:8652;2053;You just have to listen to his speech about the 1945 Indianapolis shark attacks to know what I am talking about,it is one of the most chilling scenes ever filmed.
I:8652;2054;the success of Jaws is also due to the soundtrack.
I:8652;2055;surely the musical themes of films like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, Godfather and Dr Zhivago are instantly recognizable classics the world over, but John Williams score is in a league of its own.
I:8652;2056;it is an integral part of the movie, as if a character in its own right.
I:8652;2057;another element of success lies in the fact that Benchely's book touched a very interesting and sensitive nerve: Monsters that prey on humans.
I:8652;2058;this has always fascinated and scared people since the dawn of history, and many books and tales have imagined countless such monsters in the oceans,mountains or jungles.
I:8652;2059;the fact that people are vulnerable to another predator in an environment they do not or can not tame, have always been a source of fascination and fear.
I:8652;2060;and this is exclusively due to the success of the film and the creative genuis behind it,Steven Spielberg.
I:8652;2061;A beautiful print in its widescreen glory brought those memories back to life.
I:8652;2062;A great movie and great presentation of it.
I:8652;2063;Ah, this is a true classic.
I:8652;2064;I love every moment of the movie.
I:8652;2065;He enjoys, we enjoy it, it's truly entertainment.
I:8652;2066;And I love how they build a fake shark, it really looks like a real one.
I:8652;2067;This restored blu ray version is a remarkable achievement to say the least.
I:8652;2068;The transfer is that good.
I:8652;2069;for those not familiar with the plot, Ms. Backlinie's character is but the first victim of a huge Great White shark, trolling the shoreline for a meal.
I:8652;2070;Between the ominous John Williams score that opens the film to the exciting conclusion, Spielberg grabs the audience and never lets us go.
I:8652;2071;It is a perfect thriller.
I:8652;2072;The colors, in particular are just spectacular.
I:8652;2073;Even the nighttime scenes carry more frightening weight.
I:8652;2074;Excellent blacks, startling blues and their various shadings.
I:8652;2075;As noted earlier the audio track is superb.
I:8652;2076;The beach scenes should be enveloping and they are.
I:8652;2077;the special features include two length documentaries.
I:8652;2078;Fans of film will want to own this package
I:8652;2079;30 years later it's still a great suspenseful movie.
I:8652;2080;Jaws is my favorite movie of all time and the new Blu.
I:8652;2081;The movie is a timeless horror/thriller tale about a 25 foot hungry shark that feeds on local swimmers on the beach.
I:8652;2082;After viewing this film you will think twice about swimming in the ocean.
I:8652;2083;Now that's the movie I remember!
I:8652;2084;This blu ray is like seeing the movie through new eyes.
I:8652;2085;I have NEVER seen this film look so beautiful.
I:8652;2086;My jaw (no pun) dropped when you can finally see the detail of the night opening shot.
I:8652;2087;Rest of this masterpiece looks just as brilliant.
I:8652;2088;I fell in love with this brilliant movie all over again!
I:8652;2089;Better yet, if you don't have blu ray yet let this title be the one that gets you on the hi def bandwagon.
I:8652;2090;But really, this great film doesn't need much explaining.
I:8652;2091;We have these great documentaries on this blu ray for that.
I:8652;2092;He discovers that a great white shark is in the water, so he brings over marine biolegist(Hooper) to study the shark's victims.
I:8652;2093;They then hire a man who is very well experienced with sharks(Quint) to catch/kill the shark.
I:8652;2094;the three men then sails out on a dangerous, but also very exciting adventure, and with Steven Spielbergs direction and John Williams' music, makes this movie into an all time classic!
I:8652;2095;Jaws is one of the best 70's movies ever made!
I:8652;2096;"The extras are wonderful including the ""Making Of Jaws"", the deleted scenes, and the outtakes."
I:8652;2097;ray is one of the best transfer of the film yet (until the next Video format hits) 4 Stars.
I:8652;2098;changing films we remeber or release both version on the same Disc set, and let us the fans choose with one to watch.
I:8652;2099;That is until Jaws came through and broke Sound of Music boxoffice record.
I:8652;2100;that is the importance of Jaws, not that it is a great film.
I:8652;2101;spielberg is a technical director.
I:8652;2102;He is best at scenes that do not involve words and emotion.
I:8652;2103;He is best at minipulating the audience through camera angles, editing and music.
I:8652;2104;And in this we have the great Robert Shaw who steals the movie as the rustic shark hunter.
I:8652;2105;About 6 years ago I pick up 'Jaws at a video store and i was great.
I:8652;2106;I mean the deleted scenes, The making of it,and the trivia game are all great.
I:8652;2107;So they team up with the local fisherman{Robert Shaw}, to go get the shark.
I:8652;2108;This Steven Spielberg movie successfully combines the fear of the unknown with a plot that stays within the borders of realism.
I:8652;2109;The result is one of cinema's enduring movies that is effective today as it was when it was first released.
I:8652;2110;Each of the actors plays a convincing role to keep everyone watching intrigued.
I:8652;2111;"despite the overwhelming production mishaps, ""Jaws"" is an exceptional movie."
I:8652;2112;tremendous care with shipping and handling here, and it usually arrives well before the expected date given on the web page.
I:8652;2113;Top marks to Amazon once again for the service provided, a real treat of an import.
I:8652;2114;executed horror / action movie that combines winning performances, some memorable quotes ('We're going to need a bigger boat' is on a par with the 'You've gotta be kidding me' from 'The Thing'), and a great score, 'Jaws' touched a nerve in the 70's and started off a wave of cheaply.
I:8652;2115;Characterisation and acting are excellent .
I:8652;2116;and responsible for all kinds of great things, 'Jaws' is foremost great, crowd.
I:8652;2117;pleasing entertainment, the kind of film that you can watch any time and it's still fun.
I:8652;2118;Cineastes have read a wealth of depth into the film, but at heart it's a very simple tale of great white hunters going off to tame the wilderness, and finding that the wilderness is not so easily tamed.
I:8652;2119;I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it, and every time I catch it on TV I have to sit down and watch it.
I:8652;2120;I love love love it.
I:8652;2121;"It's still a great ""anti."
I:8652;2122;I can still smell the salt and anticipation in the air as my friend and I waited in line to see Jaws on opening night!
I:8652;2123;The famous head scene is the biggest jolt and it scared the you know what out of everyone in the theater!
I:8652;2124;Living in Wildwood N. j. one block from the ocean, made the film all the more real and it kept most of us from enjoying the ocean for quite some time.
I:8652;2125;i own both the 25th and the 30th anniversary editions and I watch one of them almost on a yearly basis.
I:8652;2126;One of the best films ever made and probably the scariest.
I:8652;2127;Even so, the extra length of the documentary and the original and DTS soundtrack make this a worthy upgrade.
I:8652;2128;Could this be Steven Spielberg's greatest masterpiece?
I:8652;2129;A true horror story that unearths your deepest fears.
I:8652;2130;Carl Gottleib and original novelist Peter Benchley certainy did a most congratulatory job on the screenplay, and John Williams' music score.
I:8652;2131;that's just a classic into itself.
I:8652;2132;The young ichthyologist Matt Hooper, played by the renowned Richard Dreyfuss, developed a real friendship with Brody which was one of the film's real strongholds.
I:8652;2133;all of these moments will haunt you forever.
I:8652;2134;foot cruiser Orca , is probably the most exciting part of the film.
I:8652;2135;The barrel chase, the Indianapollis story, the cage attack, and the boat's destruction are portrayed toghether marvellously to produce one of the most outstanding films of all time.
I:8652;2136;To Steven Spielberg, Roy Scheider and the rest of the cast and crew, congratulations on making the most remarkable thriller ever.
I:8652;2137;Having seen it, I immediately (together with my friend) loved those fascinating, majestic fish .
I:8652;2138;Having seen it, I immediately (together with my friend) love those fascinating, majestic fish.
I:8652;2139;to this day they remain among my favorite animals and remember everything about them, even though I'm as far from biology and zoology as can be!
I:8652;2140;I love this movie and appreciate the effort that Stephen Spielberg puts into his films.
I:8652;2141;ray it enhances the movie.
I:8652;2142;This movie looks amazing on Blu.
I:8652;2143;Classic physiological thriller that holds up to days standards.
I:8652;2144;You'll get the behind the scenes from Spielberg, the actors, photographers, and the producers.
I:8652;2145;In today's film world this movie could be made rather easily, but back then you'll see the tremendous undertaking that went into this production.
I:8652;2146;The movie itself, of course, is just amazing.
I:8652;2147;At one point Spielberg says that the shark is the star, but the scenes on the boat will show you 3 stars at the top of their game.
I:8652;2148;The sound coming from the front 3 is great, but they could have done more.
I:8652;2149;This movie is just as suspenseful as when I saw it in the mid.
I:8652;2150;Shaw's USS Indianapolis speech is about as good as it gets, while Scheider's everyman performance really rings true.
I:8652;2151;its worth it alone for the 5.1 sound,the whiners should call a wambulance.
I:8652;2152;Still jump at all the scary moments with large screen and home theater surround.
I:8652;2153;This is the status as of 30 Dec 2012.
I:8652;2154;The 1st and the best of the Jaws movies produced.
I:8652;2155;Steven Spielberg made his bones with this flic.
I:8652;2156;It is at this point in the film that we really, for the first time, see the shark, who is actually the star of the film.
I:8652;2157;Roy Sheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw offer outstanding performances in this Steven Spielberg classic that has stood the test of time for over twenty.
I:8652;2158;And on top of all that, the video transfer is excellent!
I:8652;2159;It offers a nice crystal clear presentation of the film in its widescreen (2.35:1) aspect ratio.
I:8652;2160;It's as simple as that!
I:8652;2161;You can hear the dialogue better than ever with the beautiful soundtrack in the background.
I:8652;2162;John Williams score is incredible!
I:8652;2163;I have always loved this movie and now love it even more a great blu.
I:8652;2164;I upgraded and very happy I did.
I:8652;2165;I still remember seeing this in the movie theater when it was released in the 70s.
I:8652;2166;A classic movie that has remained in my personal top 100.
I:8652;2167;Thank goodness for movies on demand.
I:8652;2168;This movie is scary, sad, funny and excellent!!
I:8652;2169;They all play great parts and keep your attention!!
I:8652;2170;Recommend for the family of teenagers and adults!
I:8652;2171;They hire crazy man Quint to get the shark, Very hard to understand some of the awful things he does, but it all brings more suspense to the action.
I:8652;2172;Richard Dreyfus brings comic relief, and Roy Scheider brings the intensity.
I:8652;2173;Robert Shaw is crazy Quint and the supporting cast is wonderful.
I:8652;2174;Still scary after all these years.
I:8652;2175;the color and detail is very much enhanced.
I:8652;2176;For my husband to replace the one we have on VHS and he loves it.
I:8652;2177;Having the ability to view this film from anywhere that I can access to my Amazon collection is tops!
I:8652;2178;Just allow me to watch my Amazon collection from my Nexus 7 and it'll be perfect!
I:8652;2179;This is a terrific film with a legion of fans who deserve better.
I:8652;2180;I found it great fun to see how they filmed this phonemonel masterpiece of a film.
I:8652;2181;Now that i live in florida owning the whole series is a must.
I:8652;2182;This movie 30 years later is the BEST ocean thriller ever made.
I:8652;2183;I have watched it so many times I know every line and I can watch it again and again.
I:8652;2184;It is fun to watch the extras and deleted scenes, it gives you a sense of the making of this movie, and how innovative it was for the mid 70's!
I:8652;2185;A classic thriller/suspense/horror movie that kept many out of the beaches for some time.
I:8652;2186;jaws is one of my favorites.
I:8652;2187;im a movie collector but the best out of thousands of movies is sweet hostage.
I:8652;2188;That's what makes this Steven Spielberg's best movie.
I:8652;2189;But he gets to see increasing evidence of the works of Bruce's .
I:8652;2190;What juices the story, is that the shark has something else in mind.
I:8652;2191;winning score is the sound of the hunt, the sound of fear.
I:8652;2192;"(Fields won an Oscar for her work
I:8652;2193;The acting, particularly by Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss, is similarly naturalistic.
I:8652;2194;The most understated performance is by Roy Scheider, who is perfect as Police Chief Martin Brody, an uprooted New Yorker whose facade of restraint belies a nervous nature.
I:8652;2195;on the fate of the Indianapolis' crew is spellbinding.
I:8652;2196;(In addition to being one of the most powerful character actors of his day, Robert Shaw was a novelist, screenwriter, and the author of the acclaimed play, The Man in the Glass Booth.)
I:8652;2197;As good as some of Spielberg's recent work .
I:8652;2198;"has been, none is as good as Jaws, because he now strives for ""importance,"" ""significance,"" and ""symbolism,"" and for satisfying various constituencies (think Schindler's List), rather than for telling a great yarn."
I:8652;2199;Let us hope that he can someday recapture his early simplicity, and wed it to the technical savvy he's since learned.
I:8652;2200;In 1974, Steven Spielberg was basically an unknown director who had just directed his first motion picture, THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS.
I:8652;2201;office, but they knew that Steven Spielberg was a director to watch.
I:8652;2202;Steven Spielberg, while visiting the producers at their offices, noticed the script of JAWS on their desk.
I:8652;2203;In March of 1976, JAWS was nominated for four Academy Awards including Best Picture.
I:8652;2204;Though it did not win the Best Picture Award, it won three awards.
I:8652;2205;Through the years, JAWS has stayed has one of the biggest success in movie history and proved itself to be an american movie classic.
I:8652;2206;It just gets inside your soul and you can't help but think about it anytime you get around the ocean or Gulf.
I:8652;2207;It is one of the three best creature movies I have seen in my life.
I:8652;2208;It offers everything that a great horror movie should have: the psychological tension, the building suspense, the sudden appearance that makes you jump and scream, and enough gore to make you cringe.
I:8652;2209;This is a classic in horror!
I:8652;2210;This is considered to be the very first blockbuster ever made.
I:8652;2211;It is also considered to be one of the best.
I:8652;2212;After all this time, this movie still has the power to scare many people, and it works like a charm.
I:8652;2213;through Speilberg's genuis, as we watch this movie, the tension builds up all the way to the heart pounding climax.
I:8652;2214;It was also very smart not to show the shark until the 2nd half of the film because what scares us most, is what we DON'T see.
I:8652;2215;this is a rare film that combines tense action moments, with the art of good filmmaking.
I:8652;2216;though the shark is big and scary, providing much more heart.
I:8652;2217;Their bonding is intense and exhilerating, and at the end of the movie one feels that Brody has finally been redeemed, and Hooper has finally found a home.
I:8652;2218;There are dozens of wonderfully.
I:8652;2219;drawn minor characters, like the stammering mayor or the dumpy housewife whose son is eaten by the shark, and Amityville is a character in its own right, beautifully photographed and absolutely real .
I:8652;2220;its nice to see a beach for once populated by actual people, not gym.
I:8652;2221;This movie will always be great.
I:8652;2222;Really enjoyed the extras although most of them were released with the VHS special edition years ago.
I:8652;2223;witted power playing to keep us all tuned in.
I:8652;2224;Girls get beaming drunk and go swimming as if it is a good thang to do!
I:8652;2225;Amity is Sharkville for good reason.
I:8652;2226;When you couple the dummies stupidity with a monster on the loose you got yourself heaps of suspense!
I:8652;2227;How could anything not go wrong!Yes the Berg pretty much got it right on all counts.
I:8652;2228;Here the Berg gives the rats' great dialogue to play with and shoots the whole sequence of events from quite savoury angles.
I:8652;2229;a fantastic summer blockbuster movie about a town called Stupid being eaten up a dangerous rubber johnny !!
I:8652;2230;dun.You can't help but shrink back into your seat, heart thudding with the suspense, hands gripping the armrests tightly as you await the next victim's fate with bated breath.
I:8652;2231;Spielberg scared the nation out of skinny dipping in the sea with this amazing and powerful movie, and it is not in the slightest bit dated.
I:8652;2232;"head with the beast
I:8652;2233;a true masterpiece in film making.
I:8652;2234;Is exactly what I wanted a lot of extras just for fans, this kind of classic!
I:8652;2235;worth the money and the movie.
I:8652;2236;My neice wanted to watch it so I watched it with her and in still heald my attention.
I:8652;2237;jaws is one of those movies you can watch again and again.
I:8652;2238;day movies you don't have spectacular and unrealistic CGI generated action sequences, both the human actors and the shark are believable.
I:8652;2239;personally I also enjoy being transplanted back to the US as it was 30 years ago, when in a town like Amity you could still leave your house door and car unlocked.
I:8652;2240;The sheer craft displayed herein makes the film remarkable.
I:8652;2241;The performances are all nearly perfect, the score, while perhaps overly conventional, is powerful and emotive, the cinematography is consistently stunning and the period detail is utterly convincing.
I:8652;2242;Again, this is a world we seldom see, it makes the film nearly mesmerizing even in the scenes where little is actually going on.
I:8652;2243;When the Great White finally surfaced, a collective gasp could be heard throughout the theatre.
I:8652;2244;But, ultimately, in the end, we let out a whopping round of applause and got right back in line to see it again.
I:8652;2245;The suspense, the music, the chemistry of the stellar cast and, of course, the big rubber shark kept us coming back for more.
I:8652;2246;The print itself is crisp and clean.
I:8652;2247;The entire soundtrack, most notably John Williams' chilling score, is greatly enhanced by the DTS.
I:8652;2248;For my money, the Making of Jaws documentary included within is worth the price of admission alone.
I:8652;2249;Overall, a job well done and quite befitting of this all.
I:8652;2250;The most frightening water flick EVER splashed on screen, Stephen Spielberg's Jaws will remain one of the best horror tales of all time.
I:8652;2251;Tension is tight and riveting, attack scenes drawn out just right but not weighed down by too much melodrama, and the score complements the scenes perfectly.
I:8652;2252;Effects wise Jaws doesn't look like a giant ball of rubber, and they were wise to keep his appearance to a minimum for this reason.
I:8652;2253;"the first half is on land
I:8652;2254;"I especially enjoyed the touch of the killer whale in the background
I:8652;2255;some genuinely tense, scary as hell scenes, a score that should go down in the books as one of the greatest, perfect chemistry among cast and injections of action and troubling imagery when it's needed the most.
I:8652;2256;Sum it all up and it's easy to see why it added up to such a dynamic hit.
I:8652;2257;lol a classic and outstanding pic bonus footage was great too just cant wait to find jaws 2 in a set like this one thank you
I:8652;2258;Loved this movie as a kid!
I:8652;2259;It's a classic that will never grow old.
I:8652;2260;It takes a good movie to clear the coeans for pretty much close to a year and even beyond.
I:8652;2261;Still bodies continue to pile up and a reward is offered for who ever can bring in the shark.
I:8652;2262;So this takes 3 mean on a trip into the sea to come face to face with the shark that has haunted the town.
I:8652;2263;Now its man against nature in this all out fun ride.
I:8652;2264;very good adaption from the book and it will surly make you think about swiming before you step into teh ocean again.
I:8652;2265;"Was there ever a better suspense thriller than Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws""?"
I:8652;2266;Jaws became the biggest moneymaker up to the date it was released (1975) and helped to create the summer blockbuster.
I:8652;2267;It also made a young unknown director into Hollywood's golden boy, a position that Spielberg has kept for the past two and a half decades.
I:8652;2268;Jaws is better written and directed and has better characters than almost all thrillers made since.
I:8652;2269;certainly the characters are more interesting than in your average thriller.
I:8652;2270;Roy Scheider manages to exude just the right amount of masculinity and vulnerability as Brody.
I:8652;2271;I found it interesting learning about Brody's fear of the water.
I:8652;2272;I also really liked Richard Dreyfuss' nutty performance as the eccentric ichthyologist.
I:8652;2273;I thought the speech that Shaw gives about his experiences with sharks after the sinking of the Indianapolis to be one of the highlights of the film.
I:8652;2274;Spielberg would collaborate successfully with Williams in many subsequent films.
I:8652;2275;the ending is also very satisfying.
I:8652;2276;Unlike a lot of horror thrillers that leave you feeling unnerved and upset, this film's ending leaves you feeling happy and exhilarated.
I:8652;2277;There are plenty of reviews of this one so I'll hit on some specific points:1.
I:8652;2278;"the people in the roles are pretty much ""as expected"" and I thought that took away from the movie."
I:8652;2279;It's a good story, a great white shark plagueing a resort town, and the subsequent political and other conflicts between the mayor, the police chief, the marine biologist and, the shark hunter.3.
I:8652;2280;The suspense was really great .
I:8652;2281;"few movies, short of ""The Birds"" achieve this level of keeping you on the edge of your seat."
I:8652;2282;hour documentary, and scrapped the original, Oscar.
I:8652;2283;winning sound mix in favor of a surround.
I:8652;2284;"scanning wrecks the movie's visual coherence), ""Jaws"" has long since become an inadvertent classic, with at least two of its best characteristics."
I:8652;2285;Summertime blockbusters, of which this was the first, have improved on the effects since then but have generally declined in storytelling ability compared to this.
I:8652;2286;Appears a little campy by today's special effects standards, but will still scare you good.
I:8652;2287;Robert Shaw is great as the captain.
I:8652;2288;Spielberg did a great job in using devices to resemble the shark without actually showing it .
I:8652;2289;all of these new shark movies never ever even touched what this movie did.
I:8652;2290;oh, also the acting is superb.
I:8652;2291;A young, up and coming director, Steven Spielberg took an ambitious book by Peter Benchley, a turned it into one of the most memorable films of all time.
I:8652;2292;The haunting performance by Shaw is capped by his memorable Indianapolis Speech, while Dreyfuss' youth and stubbornness lend well to his character.
I:8652;2293;Perhaps one of the unsung stars of the movie is the town of Amity Island (Martha's Vineyard, MA) where the local townsfolk, the scenery, and the quaint New England mood make this more than just a horror flick, but rather a sea.
I:8652;2294;faring epic of the ages.
I:8652;2295;The bonus footage, including the stellar documentary The Shark Is Still Working make this a must have for any cinema buff.
I:8652;2296;profit, love of Jaws documentary which explains why this film is such a legend in film.
I:8652;2297;The documentary goes on to explain how the film was the first true summer blockbuster, and the highest grossing film at the time.
I:8652;2298;dun of William's theme is widely used today.
I:8652;2299;Get this remastered, superb audio and visual treat, and be sure to watch The Shark Is Still Working to appreciate how truly unique of a film Jaws really is.
I:8652;2300;You know how good the film is, now see how beautiful it can look.
I:8652;2301;The bountiful supplemental material will further enhance your appreciation of this classic.
I:8652;2302;this was fast service came in great condition,packaging ,etc.
I:8652;2303;This is a great copy .
I:8652;2304;an excellent reproduction onto Blu.
I:8652;2305;If so, you'll recognize that line.
I:8652;2306;i loved this film when I first saw it a billion yrs ago, back when the earth was cooling, and I love it still.
I:8652;2307;Benchley's original book is pretty faithfully rendered in Spielberg's screen version.
I:8652;2308;viewing discretion advised for those of tender sensibilities.
I:8652;2309;Came very well packaged and brand new.
I:8652;2310;This movie was extremely good!
I:8652;2311;Jaws is a non gory good thriller movie.
I:8652;2312;The end is a little bloody but still good :)!
I:8652;2313;Definitely a first time movie
I:8652;2314;Jaws is a tremendously entertaining action/adventure film.
I:8652;2315;Director Spielberg draws superlative performances from his main characters played by Robert Shaw (old sea dog), Roy Scheider (local police chief), and Richard Dreyfuss (shark expert) and it's their interplay which is particularly memorable.
I:8652;2316;Brilliantly directed and conceived by Spielberg and featuring the iconic John Willams theme .
I:8652;2317;this is a film classic.
I:8652;2318;Delivered new in package and right on time as always
I:8652;2319;This is still a stand up and cheer film.
I:8652;2320;Stop sticking it to those of us that are the biggest movie fans.
I:8652;2321;"edited to respond to those who say ""get over it""."
I:8652;2322;I would love to have every single version available.
I:8652;2323;Jaws launched a trend that has continued ever since, as people flock to the movies during the summer to be scared, thrilled or tickled to death by the best effects and pop.
I:8652;2324;spectacle that Hollywood can deploy.
I:8652;2325;Director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb took Peter Benchley's rather pedestrian best.
I:8652;2326;selling novel and, with the help of Verna Fields, the veteran film editor, the brilliant music of John Williams, and the tremendously appealing performances of the three lead actors and the entire supporting cast, streamlined it into an express train of a thriller.
I:8652;2327;It grabs you from the very first deep bass.
I:8652;2328;"and about whom Spielberg wrote: ""He has made our movie more adventurous, gripping and phobic than I ever thought possible."""
I:8652;2329;and its surprising amount of humor.
I:8652;2330;This many years later it remains one of the very best of the summer blockbusters.
I:8652;2331;One of the best movies of all time.
I:8652;2332;Canceling our beach vacation for this coming summer.
I:8652;2333;The picture is crisp, colorful and pops off the screen.
I:8652;2334;The moonlit scenes, chiefly the opening sequence, is stunning in its clarity.
I:8652;2335;I also noticed how incredible the sound is.
I:8652;2336;"Plentiful extras include 2 documentaries, the best being the most recent ""The Shark is Still Working"" which contains fascinating interviews with actors (even those in bit parts) and an intimate look at Verna Fields studio."
I:8652;2337;ray edition is a must have for fans!
I:8652;2338;The character development is superb.
I:8652;2339;The story fits together well.
I:8652;2340;The special effects are amazing for the period in which the movie was made and are still pretty good even considering what we are accustomed to with today's technology.
I:8652;2341;The pacing is slow compared to today's movies and some of the acting is a bit hammed up at times but a very entertaining movie overall.
I:8652;2342;Jaws is one of my favorite films.
I:8652;2343;The movie is still great and the picture looks and sounds excellent in BD.
I:8652;2344;I enjoyed hearing the many great lines and speeches again.
I:8652;2345;It's interesting and fun to watch too.
I:8652;2346;The restoration is incredible and what I would imagine this film looked like when originally released in theaters.
I:8652;2347;This is another classic from my childhood, it was scary then, and so it is now.
I:8652;2348;I adore these three actors in Jaws, and Spielbergs' directions is the early work of a genious in progress, you know, I find Jaws among Spielbergs' best work ever .
I:8652;2349;the best before Schindlers' List (though very uncomparable) .
I:8652;2350;jaws is a movie with soul.
I:8652;2351;"elements behind the story captured on screen are so facinating and impressive and unlike anything else ever made, the effects are ""simple"" (like the barrels) but function extremely well, and still today ."
I:8652;2352;And that probably because is a movie much more than just a horror movie about a great white shark.
I:8652;2353;"It is more ""realistic"" ."
I:8652;2354;Anyway, the movie is still impressive, just as entertaining and loveable.
I:8652;2355;i think Robert Shaw earned an Academy Award for his role in this project, a great actor.
I:8652;2356;its directed by steven spielberg who is easily one of the all time best directors.
I:8652;2357;The movie is based on Peter Benchey's best.
I:8652;2358;This is one of the rare instances where a movie is actually better than the book it was based on.
I:8652;2359;The movie streamlines the book and the changes made bringing it to the screen actually improve on the book.
I:8652;2360;The performances of three stars are superb.
I:8652;2361;Richard Dreyfus adds some comic relief to the film as the wise.
I:8652;2362;The real star of the film could be its score by John Williams.
I:8652;2363;The music adds tension and fear to the suspense much like the music from Psycho.
I:8652;2364;This is a must see for all fans of the film.
I:8652;2365;After 25 years, this movie remains a classic.
I:8652;2366;Steven Spielberg's 1975 masterpiece shows what Jurassic Park could have been if Spielberg had been serious about the dinosaur film.
I:8652;2367;Jaws owes much of its success to a superb cast with three.
I:8652;2368;While the conclusion is riveting with the shark in full view, it owes much to the build.
I:8652;2369;This is one of those rare cases where the film is better than the book.
I:8652;2370;As everyone knows this June 2000 will be the 25th anniversary of the original release date of one the best thrillers ever made.
I:8652;2371;It also illustrates a noble dimension to the estuary victims' earlier question to the boys of .
I:8652;2372;I guess it will be put to the test this summer!I recommend this movies to those looking for a good movie that keeps you in suspense.
I:8652;2373;It's actually the music that's the scariest part.
I:8652;2374;It builds up the anxiety.
I:8652;2375;I mean, everyone knows that this epic tale of carnage is one of the most difinitive films in history!
I:8652;2376;Jaws had quite an impact on people when it came out, and, I believe, it still does.
I:8652;2377;Jaws is clearer, sounds better and has some great extras!!
I:8652;2378;This is an awesome scary classic movie!
I:8652;2379;It has awesome shark sequences, and awesome characters.
I:8652;2380;If you love horror and classics, you'll love JAWS!!!
I:8652;2381;The best part was when that shark fed on that human!
I:8652;2382;I saw this movie when I was an embryo, and it still excites me to this day!
I:8652;2383;After I saw it, I immediately wanted to go into the ocean and become a feeding for a great white shark!
I:8652;2384;Some poeple say this movie glorifies the violent nature of shark feeding, but I think it is a wonderful, natural process which is part of the whole balance of nature.
I:8652;2385;Being eaten by a shark was the best thing that ever happened to me!
I:8652;2386;It amazes me that Spielberg, who had never been eaten by a shark, has given us such a human.
I:8652;2387;And the best part was that you didn't know what was going to happen!
I:8652;2388;There is no shortage of shark feedings here, and that's what makes a good movie.
I:8652;2389;This movie also has a large sense of comic relief.
I:8652;2390;Spielberg truly develops his characters in this cinematic masterpiece.
I:8652;2391;In another part of the movie, the shark feeds on this human, and you can really feel the hunger of the shark and his need to consume food.
I:8652;2392;It is the ultimate shark movie!
I:8652;2393;It's so good that I'd say it's better than all the other shark movies.
I:8652;2394;Bought this as a gift.
I:8652;2395;Brings this classic so clean on my 43 .
I:8652;2396;It is comparable to a new release that you would watch on BR.
I:8652;2397;Sound and extra features are great too.
I:8652;2398;Brother Les played a part in it.
I:8652;2399;Watched with greatgrandchildren,we enjoyed it alot.
I:8652;2400;passedit on to my children and grand children.
I:8652;2401;"After seeing ""Jaws,"" you'll be afraid to go in the shower!"
I:8652;2402;time classic at the same time.
I:8652;2403;a quiet New England summer town is terrorized by an enormous Great White Shark whose appetite for human flesh seems to know no limits.
I:8652;2404;the three leads all deliver unforgettable performances, but the real star of the show is Spielberg, who deftly plays on the fears of the audience to create a thriller worthy of Hitchcock (yes, I realize how original it is to bring this up when talking about this movie).
I:8652;2405;Cranking up the suspense by more than a few notches is the classic, inspired soundtrack by John Williams.
I:8652;2406;Spielberg manages to create an atmosphere so tense that the mere sight of the ocean is almost enough to make you jump out of your seat.
I:8652;2407;It's just as well, because this is a true classic, regardless of the bastardizing effect its box office had on Hollywood films.
I:8652;2408;Spielberg has said that although he hated making the film, he loved planning the film, implying that the mere thought of scaring the bejesus out of the audience was an immensely enjoyable experience for him.
I:8652;2409;vivid colors and better sound.
I:8652;2410;also like the extra disc that explains the process and interviews
I:8652;2411;I saw it again after many years and I was very impressed, need I say more!?
I:8652;2412;Sure the extras are good.
I:8652;2413;It is immaculate, and the guys who did the restoring work on the original print deserve a Nobel prize.
I:8652;2414;I love all 3 of the movies.
I:8652;2415;there was a 4th one,but please dont bring it up)i had a foot.
I:8652;2416;so yes,i love this movie.
I:8652;2417;bought the widescreen VHS, bought the anniversary 2.
I:8652;2418;the picture is great,and the sound is more vivid.
I:8652;2419;Perhaps not intentional and not as epic as the changes made to re.
I:8652;2420;still,the transfer is commendable,so if you can enjoy it,go for it
I:8652;2421;Very well done, I enjoyed the classic like it was new again.
I:8652;2422;Viewed well, no jumps or skips.
I:8652;2423;I love everything about JAWS, and the extras are great.
I:8652;2424;The ultimate beach novel translated to cinema.
I:8652;2425;He wanted the Collection so I bought it.
I:8652;2426;it is a great gift set to give to anyone.
I:8652;2427;This is the best movie ever made?
I:8652;2428;I think that they are the most beautiful animals on the planet.
I:8652;2429;But, lets survey the facts here.
I:8652;2430;Jaws is a great movie!
I:8652;2431;It is the greatest movie of all time.
I:8652;2432;It truely is the greatest movie of all time.
I:8652;2433;something like, a bigger BRAIN!!!!
I:8652;2434;Now I can see it on Blu Ray and enjoy it all over again!
I:8652;2435;The film is just as intense as it was close to three decades ago.
I:8652;2436;Robert Shaw's performance still ranks as one of the most Oscar.
I:8652;2437;"the bonus feature of viewing the early television work of director Spielberg is fascinating, especially when one recalls the shows, as I do, that he had a hand in shaping (""Night Gallery"" and ""Columbo,"" for example)."
I:8652;2438;Jaws is the original FISH.
I:8652;2439;and all of a sudden, the discover it's because of a great white shark!
I:8652;2440;This movie is one of the best I've ever seen.
I:8652;2441;This movie scares me every time I watch it.
I:8652;2442;Young, relatively unknown, mastermind director Spielberg directs.
I:8652;2443;Support from a wonderful cast: Roy Scheider (the town sheriff), Richard Dreyfuss (the out of town shark expert), and the late great Robert Shaw (the fisherman his boat).
I:8652;2444;This movie is tied together very well .
I:8652;2445;Awesome ahead of it's time.
I:8652;2446;Sometimes it's not simply that a movie is great, it's also the memories that surround the first time you watched it.
I:8652;2447;For me one of those great reminisces is when my older brother Rick took me to see `Jaws' in the summer of 1975.
I:8652;2448;This was such a revelation that I remember telling a friend about the movie and he was totally aghast at such an iconoclastic beginning.
I:8652;2449;of course this is a fantastic scare.
I:8652;2450;The dialogue is smart and the characters are interesting and very well developed.
I:8652;2451;From the central troika of Brody, Hooper and Quint to lesser characters such as the chief's wife and the mayor the players satisfy and represent what we want them to.
I:8652;2452;Awesome stuff love it all jaws is a classic the wine wrack is awsome also hope you like it also.
I:8652;2453;I loved the movie JAWS.
I:8652;2454;Now that i am 14, the movie is just awesome and well put together.
I:8652;2455;I think after 30 years, this movie is still really amazing.
I:8652;2456;It is so cool to watch the movie that pretty much catapolted the three main actors, and Spielberg's carrier.
I:8652;2457;I think Spielberg made this a film from the book, becaus he thought it would make a good story.
I:8652;2458;What do you know, it became the first summer blockbuster.
I:8652;2459;The new digital restoration is amazing with vibrant colors and sharpness for a film that goes back to 1975.
I:8652;2460;The film is crisp and clear, and letterboxed the way it should be, but certain sound effects are not the way they were or should be.
I:8652;2461;Now for the film review, As we all know, this film opens wonderfully underwater with John Williams spooky score done brilliantly.
I:8652;2462;Of course after a few deaths, one being the opening attack and devouring of a cute female swimmer, and the other being a water loving little boy, the towns chief played wonderfully by Roy Scheider wants something to be done, mainly close the beaches and hire someone to kill the beast.
I:8652;2463;The films chase scenes between the men and the shark are done expertly and professionally.
I:8652;2464;And we generally feel at one point as if the shark has won, leaving the ending to be truly explosive.
I:8652;2465;Spielberg knows how to direct a great cast and this film will leave you thinking twice about returning to the water trust me.
I:8652;2466;This movie is a good thriller.
I:8652;2467;This film is fun, but flatter than a pancake.
I:8652;2468;Always one of my favorite movies.
I:8652;2469;Great Movie, I love that it came out in Blu.
I:8652;2470;this is a classic movie and it was inexpensive.
I:8652;2471;When Steven Spielberg finished making the smash hit action film DUEL, he began venturing to make another film, scarier, more exciting, and, as well, a money maker.
I:8652;2472;Somebody handed it to him, Spielberg read it, and he was interested in making a movie out of it.
I:8652;2473;jAWS: The Movie is simply amazing.
I:8652;2474;Scary, exciting, and overall, enjoyable.
I:8652;2475;ray version looks better than the theater.
I:8652;2476;Saw it with the grandchildren and they were really transfixed with the movie.
I:8652;2477;But turn it the other way around and, well.
I:8652;2478;The mayor decides that Brody is exceeding his authority.
I:8652;2479;A modest reward is offered for anybody who can get rid of the shark and a brash sea dog type (Robert Shaw) named Quint insists that he's the only one who can do it.
I:8652;2480;for more than three times the reward offered.
I:8652;2481;We get a crowd shot including one tourist.
I:8652;2482;"day viewer who sneers obsessively over New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's weight as if having major weight issues makes a person subhuman, one of the ""new nerds""."
I:8652;2483;This is a movie I can watch again and again.
I:8652;2484;The way the shark is a constant presence throughout the movie without being shown much at all is amazing.
I:8652;2485;One of my all time favorite movies.
I:8652;2486;I have seen it a number of times since then and finally bought the disk.
I:8652;2487;It is still one of the best suspense films ever made.
I:8652;2488;Jaws is the most scariest film from Steven Spielberg.
I:8652;2489;a shark attacks a beach and it takes shark hunters to catch the shark.
I:8652;2490;the final ending is the best.
I:8652;2491;best music score by John Williams.
I:8652;2492;I just recently viewed the film, JAWS, in it's entirety.
I:8652;2493;My brother Michael, who is now deceased, loved this film, so I figured why not get the film?
I:8652;2494;Those of us who feel no need to pay the studio will move on with our lives.
I:8652;2495;"And yes, so long as you keep purchasing new and updated editions, they will continue to make ""anniversary editions""."
I:8652;2496;Just keep that in mind.
I:8652;2497;So I always watched it on VHS full screen.
I:8652;2498;"one of the greatest movies ever made
I:8652;2499;Jaws is simply the best nature.
I:8652;2500;steven Spielberg was unarguably the genius behind the execution of the film, but everyone from the excellent cast, to the special effects gurus (remember this was done before digital special effects were even dreamed of), to the editors and sound effects people coalesced to produce an amazing film.
I:8652;2501;i am sure that everyone knows that the film is about a giant rogue shark terrorizing a resort community, and the man.
I:8652;2502;beast battle which ensues, but to me the real genius here is in the development of the lead characters into real, believable people thrust together in a very trying situation.
I:8652;2503;I personally believe that Robert Shaw and Roy Scheider are the true stars here.
I:8652;2504;"Shaw's ""USS Indianapolis"" monologue is one of the most effective in film history (the ""Making of"" feature discusses this at length in an interesting segment), and Roy Scheider's ""bigger boat"" adlib is possibly the best line in the entire film."
I:8652;2505;"there are many extras, including an interesting ""Making of"" feature, which is highly recommended viewing, even if you normally don't enjoy such things."
I:8652;2506;Forget the extras if you wish: this is a film worthy of being called a true cinematic legend.
I:8652;2507;Jaws, from the mid.1970s, still holds up very well today and does not seem especially dated.
I:8652;2508;Very good video, very good audio, so I very much recommend this Blu.
I:8652;2509;Let me get right to the point.
I:8652;2510;Jaws is a classic, a masterpiece, the standard by which all modern horror and action thrillers are measured.
I:8652;2511;Spielberg's 1975 adaptation of Peter Benchley's celebrated novel may well have ignited a new era for the movie industry at that time: the era of the Summer Blockbuster.
I:8652;2512;going experience, and the result is one of the greatest films of all time.
I:8652;2513;This is the dilemma that's brilliantly played out between the rational.
I:8652;2514;Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw formulate such perfect chemistry that we can't peel our attention away for even a moment.
I:8652;2515;In fact, the movie's final hour may be one of the finest ever filmed in terms of drama, suspense, and sheer horror.
I:8652;2516;All performances are commendable, the dialogue at times is brilliant, and the mechanical shark (Bruce) is as terrifying as any computer generated effect from that moronic film Deep Blue Sea.
I:8652;2517;John William's score ranks among the best ever composed, on a par in terms of ground.
I:8652;2518;"This strategy increases our anticipation as well as the emotional impact of each encounter with what shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) calls ""the perfect eating machine."""
I:8652;2519;"this is an especially entertaining ""horror movie,"" possessed of crisp and sure direction, solid acting, and an effective integration of cinematography, musical score, and special effects."
I:8652;2520;The film opens with a shot of a group of teenagers enjoying a campfire out on Amity beach.
I:8652;2521;A couple leaves the group for a midnight swim.
I:8652;2522;Her dress, bra, and panties fly toward her drunk admirer who can't make a fist to catch them.
I:8652;2523;in a delicate splash, Chrissie goes swimming in the cold ocean, drawing herself into deeper water.
I:8652;2524;She struggles with all her forces, but she is soon submerged in a horrifying scene.
I:8652;2525;but as Amity is a beautiful summer resort with clean air, clear water, and beautiful white sand beaches.
I:8652;2526;brody, Quint and Hooper become allied in a life.
I:8652;2527;shaw is absolutely convincing as the colorful master fisherman whose obsession for destroying sharks was triggered by an actual incident in World War II.
I:8652;2528;scheider is quiet likable as the dedicated family man who doesn't even like the water, swimming or boating.
I:8652;2529;dreyfuss manages to humanize the picture while stealing it.
I:8652;2530;spielberg alarms us with unexpected twists, and heart.
I:8652;2531;spielberg uses an imposing classical score to prepare the audience for something really scary that is about to show up.
I:8652;2532;with every breath, every thought, heart beat and movement, the realism of the increasing menace is present from the opening to the end.
I:8652;2533;Great movie spielberg outdid himself!
I:8652;2534;The video sales did well as well.
I:8652;2535;Ahh finally on Blu Ray, and every bit as beautiful looking.
I:8652;2536;Plus you get TSISW, which is sweet!
I:8652;2537;Jaws is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8652;2538;Some parts are funny and some are more gruesome so beware.
I:8652;2539;Thanks for ruining the beach for 30 years, Spielberg!P.
I:8652;2540;The suspense that builds in this film is so visceral and real.
I:8652;2541;Otherwise, a flawless film of the highest calibre.
I:8652;2542;This is, quite simply,one of the best horror films ever made.
I:8652;2543;spielberg effectively meshes stark terror, a bit of realism,and a little humor to create this excellent film version of a rather horrible novel.
I:8652;2544;superb acting,superb direction,superb score,almost everything worked about this film.
I:8652;2545;As a refreshing change,Spielberg chose to present each of his characters as completely fleshed out human beings, and not just fodder for the shark.
I:8652;2546;I just saw Jaws for the first time last night, and I loved it!
I:8652;2547;The cinemetogrophy is wonderful, there are several scenes that just plain work.
I:8652;2548;The plot is a rarity in a modern movie, cohesive and well put together.
I:8652;2549;The slimy Mayor is just one of the great parts, and they all fit together seamlessly.
I:8652;2550;It is very good, with suspense, laughs, and some popcorn spilling frights, but it still is not perfect.
I:8652;2551;It is a classic 4/5 stars.
I:8652;2552;It holds up very well after all these years.
I:8652;2553;It remains an infinitely entertaining adventure story, populated with wonderful characters and a captivatingly simple premise, via Peter Benchley's clever but soppy book.
I:8652;2554;winning score succeeded so brilliantly you forget that someone somewhere actually CREATED that ba.
I:8652;2555;da shark theme that will forever resonate in our minds .
I:8652;2556;and call forth the thrills of this expertly made movie.
I:8652;2557;I've loved this movie from the time it came out.
I:8652;2558;Either they lightened it up a notch or just the higher definition brings out the detail to it.
I:8652;2559;Great clarity, color and definition.
I:8652;2560;As my first experience with JAWS was a seminal event in my life I wanted to share that experience with him.
I:8652;2561;The fact that I saw Jaws in one of those old.
I:8652;2562;It really is a remarkable film and it deserves to be part of that canon of life.
I:8652;2563;even ones in the genre of summer blockbusters.
I:8652;2564;Watching it 35 years after I had first seen it six times that summer (it played on that one screen for the entire summer), I was truly impressed at how it didn't feel dated at all.
I:8652;2565;It is a testament to Spielberg et al.
I:8652;2566;Regardless, please watch this movie again and pass it on to your next generation!!!
I:8652;2567;The special features are also excellent.
I:8652;2568;This is a must have for even the casual Jaws fan.
I:8652;2569;This movie is both incredibly dramatic and horrifying and at other times it is just hilarious.
I:8652;2570;Maybe I ought to try the holiday roast) The main characters are very well acted by Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfus, and Robert Shaw.
I:8652;2571;You really can believe that Roy Sneider is the Average.
I:8652;2572;joe police chief Martin Brodie and Richard Dreyfus as Matt Hooper seems to actually possess a great deal of knowledge about sharks.
I:8652;2573;Robert Shaw as Quint steals the show with hilarious tirades about his fair Spanish Ladies.
I:8652;2574;Lorraine Gary's (As Brodie's Wife) reaction to Quint was also amusing in that scene.
I:8652;2575;The supporting cast was also believable.
I:8652;2576;All the actors were believable for that matter.
I:8652;2577;Good acting can make the unbelievable actually believable.
I:8652;2578;I thought the twist of irony in Quint's death was engaging because it kind of made him like those that lost their lives on the U. s. s Indianappolis.
I:8652;2579;From the smile you son of bitch line to the final line of this classic script.
I:8652;2580;The final line is what explains the purpose of the movie as well.
I:8652;2581;From the start of the classic score in the opening scene until the final scene this movie is truly a classic in everyway.
I:8652;2582;This film has it all.
I:8652;2583;I bought this movie as a gift for my dad.
I:8652;2584;I'd already owned 3 or 4 copies in various anniversary editions, but this one has the most complete set of extras.
I:8652;2585;Jaws has always been my favorite movie since I saw it at the drive.
I:8652;2586;As far as I'm concerned, this is Steven Spielberg's masterpiece as it is successful on so many levels.
I:8652;2587;I loved this blue ray copy of one of my favorite movies.
I:8652;2588;Another person had recommended this one over some of the anniversary issues.
I:8652;2589;I tried it and it was the classic movie in a wonderful clear presentation.
I:8652;2590;Everything is successful here: casting, story, photography.
I:8652;2591;This is a classic movie and is edition is a good one.
I:8652;2592;Not only did he create an effective and terrifying tale.
I:8652;2593;He created a movie that still gives some goosebumps 30 years later.
I:8652;2594;still as refreshing as the day it was first shown, Jaws is a classic.
I:8652;2595;It also has a documentary and a few other fun things.
I:8652;2596;The big draw will be the 60 page Commemorative Booklet.
I:8652;2597;The music, the cinamatography, the acting, and the effects.
I:8652;2598;This film is a movie unlike no other.
I:8652;2599;A fair adaption from Peter Benchley's terrifying best seller, Jaws was the first of the summer blockbusters, earning $100,000,000 at the box office.
I:8652;2600;Other movies previously before Jaws delivered the shock horror value without brilliant effects (example: The Exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) The film is definately a cinematic classic, with a eye.
I:8652;2601;popping opening, and a edge of your seat ending.
I:8652;2602;Felt like it was even better than seeing it on the screen in the mid.
I:8652;2603;That's all I can say.
I:8652;2604;The picture and sound are 100 times better than any previous versions (and I've bought them all).
I:8652;2605;There are literally hundreds of fascinating details in the blu.
I:8652;2606;I watch it on a 58 inch Samsung plasma and it's truly a beautiful thing.
I:8652;2607;"The new documentary ""The Shark Is Still Working"" is fantastic as well."
I:8652;2608;I have throughly enjoyed this movie time after time, in fact, I am watching it right now!
I:8652;2609;This is one of the greatest films of all time in my opinion.
I:8652;2610;I'll spare you the obligatory review of something everyone's seen fifty times.
I:8652;2611;ray release is nice .
I:8652;2612;Worth every penny, plus it's got fun documentary extras.
I:8652;2613;Easily the best shark film ever made, Jaws was a box office blockbuster and placed rightly so on the American Film Institute's 1OO Greatest Movies.
I:8652;2614;in the lead role, Scheider rightly underplays Chief Brody, displaying admirable charisma with a sense of darkness.
I:8652;2615;Robert Shaw is simply excellent as Quint, giving off a sense of ruggedness and intimidation.
I:8652;2616;He emits a commanding presence especially during the Indianapolis and courtroom sequences.
I:8652;2617;Lorraine Gary does a fine job as Ellen Brody, and Murray Hamilton portrays stubborn mayor Larry Vaughn just right.
I:8652;2618;spielberg's direction is excellent, he was snubbed at the 1975 Oscars when he didn't receive a Best Director nomination.
I:8652;2619;The script by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb is occasionally spotty but overall well done.
I:8652;2620;Bill Butler's cinematography is beautiful, it captures the suspense and the terror very well and was suprisingly not nominated at Oscar time.
I:8652;2621;The soundwork by John Cater and Robert L. Hoyt won the Oscar as well as Verna Fields' sensational editing.
I:8652;2622;I can remember in the documentary in the special edition saying that the sound crew's boat was sinking once and one of the crew members was yelling to save the equipment.
I:8652;2623;john Williams' music score is one of his best work along with, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the Star Wars films, and the Indiana Jones films.
I:8652;2624;It brings out the horror and suspense perfectly while displaying beauty and genius.
I:8652;2625;wrenching finale with the shark pounding the boat.
I:8652;2626;shot is beautiful, with the boat silohoutte, the water sparkling, and the music and the shooting star.
I:8652;2627;Overall, Jaws is Spielberg's best film and is my second favorite film of all time.
I:8652;2628;Jaws is a great thriller.
I:8652;2629;I have liked this movie for years.
I:8652;2630;The acting is very good, and the character development is satisfying.
I:8652;2631;I've seen this movie over a hundred times but it's always great to revisit a classic.
I:8652;2632;I realized that I had never seen this movie and watched it with friends who have seen it multiple times!
I:8652;2633;It's a great movie to watch for the first time or the 10th!
I:8652;2634;So I thought I would treat myself to this and it was great!
I:8652;2635;JAWS is one of the greatest films in all of cinematic history.
I:8652;2636;LOVE Robert Shaw, but as Quint he excels himself and turns in a great performance, esp the relating of the story of the USS Indianapolis.
I:8652;2637;It is quite lengthy and provides many fascinating factoids and gives a new light and dimension to the movie.
I:8652;2638;god Bless and RIP Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw, and TY for so many excellent performances.
I:8652;2639;My kids both watched this movie on tv and my oldest loved the movie.
I:8652;2640;Classics are the best way to enjoy the movies in my opinion.
I:8652;2641;What can a person say when he is confronted with the incedible task of reviewing one of the most influential movies of all time.
I:8652;2642;Robotical tricks crafted by the movie master, Steven Speilberg, bring Jaws side by side with Star Wars.
I:8652;2643;The music is truly one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard come out of a movie.
I:8652;2644;A familiar name comes to mind with these marvelous compositions, Jon Williams.
I:8652;2645;Jaws has lived through 2 and 1/2 decades as one of the leading movies of all time, I am overwhelmingly confident that it will continue to shine bright as the ultimate showcase for Steven Spielberg's incredible talent.
I:8652;2646;"When future generations examine the Steven Spielberg canon, three motion pictures will stand out: ""Schindler's List"" (1993), ""E. t."" (1982) and ""Jaws"" (1975), the director's breakthrough thriller."
I:8652;2647;somehow managing to transcend Peter Benchley's source material.
I:8652;2648;Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss make a formidable ensemble while Spielberg keeps a tight grip on the watery suspense.
I:8652;2649;"No matter how many times you see it, ""Jaws"" still packs a powerful cinematic punch."
I:8652;2650;Far superior to the contemporary Hollywood blockbuster.
I:8652;2651;An outstanding achievement in every respect.
I:8652;2652;took me right back to the first time i saw it.
I:8652;2653;What's the point in me going in to detail about other scenes?It would spoil your'e enjoyment of what must be,one of the greatest films of all time.
I:8652;2654;the actual picture ranges from sharp to extremely sharp.
I:8652;2655;that classic,haunting Jaws theme is re.
I:8652;2656;It is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:8652;2657;I love this movie because of the unbearable suspense and excitement it causes.
I:8652;2658;This movie is, on my behalf, almost perfect.
I:8652;2659;My favourite character is Quint, and Scheider is exceptionally good.
I:8652;2660;A lot of them are still unreleased.
I:8652;2661;But digital restorations such as this make the wait almost worth it.
I:8652;2662;i've never seen a film this old be restored to such perfect clarity.
I:8652;2663;There is absolutely no grain or imperfections.
I:8652;2664;When reading all these reviews the first thing you should note is that Amazon has for some reason combined comments for previous releases of this movie with the new 2012 Universal's 100th Anniversary Release.
I:8652;2665;Many of the comments you see here are actually for an older release which is not very smart of Amazon.
I:8652;2666;It has to be one of the best transitions to Blu.
I:8652;2667;ray is beautiful so get it.
I:8652;2668;it is a beautifully made piece of cinema and a great story.
I:8652;2669;Quint is the physical, working class man.
I:8652;2670;The shark doesn't quite match up to todays computer generated effects but this films so good you won't care and I assure you you will jump once or twice and it will by the end be real enough for you to not want to be there in the movie with them.
I:8652;2671;Its even got a good sense of humour and the music by speilberg regular John Williams is just first rate.
I:8652;2672;Jaws is a remarkable film whose stature and reputation have been marred by a plethora of poor sequels.
I:8652;2673;Whether this is true or not this film is amazing.
I:8652;2674;The fact that you don't even see the shark until the last 30 minutes of the film is ingenious.
I:8652;2675;All the performances are unforgetable.
I:8652;2676;Robert Shaw's speech is one of the greatest deliveries ever captured on film.
I:8652;2677;It is a true classic film that makes you think is it really safe to go back in the water!!!!!!
I:8652;2678;Jaws has it all great story,great cast, great setting, and most of all a true master piece of film!!!!!!
I:8652;2679;One of the best Blu.
I:8652;2680;Jaws has to go down as one of the best films ever made.
I:8652;2681;The script is simple and superb.
I:8652;2682;The dialogue is right on target.
I:8652;2683;Characters are well thought out and well difined.
I:8652;2684;The cinematography, that gets pretty dated if done poorly, like fine wine gets better with age.
I:8652;2685;Mr. Spielberg is at his best dierecting a cast at their best with a story from a writer at his best.
I:8652;2686;The acting is supurb, the storyline is brilliant, and the sharks effects are awsome for a movie of it's age!
I:8652;2687;Anyone can enjoy this movie.
I:8652;2688;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:8652;2689;Saw Jaws when I was a kid, and could see the detail, effort and workmanship that went into it.
I:8652;2690;That's what made JAWS a success.
I:8652;2691;Arrived as described and in good timing,
I:8652;2692;This time Hollywood made a great movie from a so.
I:8652;2693;Lots of fun even tho it's an old movie.
I:8652;2694;"I thought the booklet that was included was very ""special"" and worth the price alone."
I:8652;2695;Still fun to watch and makes me jump.
I:8652;2696;Seriously great acting by Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfus on the boat all the way to the end!
I:8652;2697;pretty much THE most well made films i have ever seen, with an amazing attention to detail and creatvity in scene shots.
I:8652;2698;I have to hand it to the production team for their role in planning the sequences.
I:8652;2699;it tells the story of three men, hunting a great white that terrorizes the swimmers and people of a quiet beach town in New England and of the tourists coming to celebrate 4th of July.
I:8652;2700;some of my favorite were1.
I:8652;2701;farewell and adieu to you fair spanish ladies.
I:8652;2702;But the best part was the award winning score by John Williams, becoming a part of pop culture in reference to any shark or animal stealth attack.
I:8652;2703;Jaws is a classic masterpiece about an ominous great white shark that attacks unsuspecting beach.
I:8652;2704;This film is filled with suspense, action, and horror.
I:8652;2705;biter of the story is the suspenseful and haunting score.
I:8652;2706;Spielberg is a marvelous director!
I:8652;2707;I definately recommend this film for horror and suspense fans.
I:8652;2708;"I enjoy seeing the theatrical trailer and the making of ""Jaws""."
I:8652;2709;This film invented the Summer blockbuster, however unlike some that have followed this is a classic movie.
I:8652;2710;Directed by Spielberg and with a fantastic cast, how could it go wrong?
I:8652;2711;Scheider gives us a quietly determined man, whereas Robert Shaw's performance as Quint, a grizzled fisherman, is loud, aggresive and energetic.
I:8652;2712;Richard Dreyfuss completes a great trio of leading actors.
I:8652;2713;The mixed chemistry between them is perhaps the strongest point in the film.
I:8652;2714;the film won 3 Oscars, most noteably of course for John Williams evocative music score (which also won a BAFTA as well).
I:8652;2715;Jaws is an all time great.
I:8652;2716;I saw this movie on the big screen when it was first released, and when the shark suddenly appeared on the screen,most of the people in the theatre involuntarily leapt from their seats with shock!
I:8652;2717;arguably steven spielbergs masterpiece this film deserves to go on the list of the one hundred greatest movies of all time.
I:8652;2718;the sound and music is incredible and unforgettable.
I:8652;2719;easily surpasses the book it is absolutely magnificent.
I:8652;2720;the chase at the end is gut wrenching.
I:8652;2721;the line we're gonna need a bigger boat is one of the best phrases ever uttered in history.
I:8652;2722;Just a great all time classic movie!!!
I:8652;2723;after all these years this movie holds up in every aspect.
I:8652;2724;For a 1975 movie, Jaws still remains a classic.
I:8652;2725;What a great movie for the decade.
I:8652;2726;Great acting, great special effects, great writing, great everything.
I:8652;2727;Why Jaws is a study in perfect storytelling:1.
I:8652;2728;It makes you care about the characters and their predicaments.
I:8652;2729;It's a thriller first and a monster movie second.
I:8652;2730;Half the dialogue is quotable / memorable(ditto)6.
I:8652;2731;It has a beginning, a middle and an end.
I:8652;2732;The roles are well conceived and have character depth, and the acting is first rate.9.
I:8652;2733;It is believable as a story.
I:8652;2734;Because it is a perfect example of what happens when you remove / do the opposite of all the the above points in making a film.
I:8652;2735;It is remarkable it that it manages to do this, and just has to be seen if purely as a comparison to Jaws.
I:8652;2736;comparing the two should be done, as it makes you appreciate Jaws as a fine film, and also shows you the depths to which Hollywood sunk in it's wake.
I:8652;2737;This has to be one of the most perfectly paced films ever made.
I:8652;2738;This is perfection and I even support the practical FX as opposed to CGI.
I:8652;2739;Jaws is one of my fav movies of all time.
I:8652;2740;the fact that Universal is restoring it from the film's original negative is beyond awesome.
I:8652;2741;This new Jaws be like watching a fresh new print so crystal clear it will be like picture for today's movie standards.
I:8652;2742;That is what makes Jaws a great classic.
I:8652;2743;It was made in an age where there was no CGI and that's what made movies wholesome and great to watch back in the day.
I:8652;2744;The actors also give amazing performances and put all there hard efforts in to this film and making you believe that there is a dangerous shark that is out there killing people and the shark has to be killed.
I:8652;2745;People have been inspired by this movie to study sharks, go into the movie business, and even become film makers because of this one great, scary, and glorious classic movie.
I:8652;2746;This blu ray release is perfect!
I:8652;2747;The sound is incredible and the picture is amazing!
I:8652;2748;The night scenes are clear and the underwater shots are pristine!
I:8652;2749;The story is just as powerful as it was on its original release, the acting brilliant and the shark attack scenes are still horrifying!
I:8652;2750;This movie is still a marvellously acted film, even in this age of over digitalized special effects.
I:8652;2751;It is well worth a rewatch.
I:8652;2752;This one, while not a particularly scary movie, is suspenseful and filled with great characters who acted very well by this cast.
I:8652;2753;JAWS is one of those movies that I see audiences enjoying for a few more decades because of the solid writing and the restraint to use special effect in the mid 70's.
I:8652;2754;A great movie that if you haven't seen it, you will understand why it is so beloved.
I:8652;2755;An original that is filled with extra bonuses throughout I believe this movie is good for the whole family, as long as your children aren't too easily scared.
I:8652;2756;Saw it for the first time decades ago and it definitely had an impact.
I:8652;2757;Without a doubt this 30th Anniversary Edition of Jaws is wonderful.
I:8652;2758;my 11 year old loved all the jaws movies.
I:8652;2759;she was so cute when she would jump and yell at the tv get out of the water.
I:8652;2760;Jaws is the absolute best movie to scare the pa.
I:8652;2761;I watch this movie once a month.
I:8652;2762;Martin Brody's best line of the movie.
I:8652;2763;a great white, the mother of all sharks.
I:8652;2764;this is more than a movie about some guys going fishing.
I:8652;2765;There is tenson throughout the movie.
I:8652;2766;telling (with Hitchcock's Birds and Psycho being important models .
I:8652;2767;Where Hitchcock would have shot, say, the beach scenes in a studio.
I:8652;2768;A rare movie indeed, suprassing not only the original novel by Benchly, but also the rocky beginning it suffered.
I:8652;2769;How did it turn out so crowd pleasing and simply terrific?
I:8652;2770;whatever troubles this movie was forced to undergo (including the studio's initial hatred of it), it finally erupted onto the big screen, and became an immediate classic.
I:8652;2771;Held up by strong peformances from Schnieder, Dreyfuss, and an exception Shaw, as well as clever dialogue and a unique usage of camera angles, Jaws defies its original horrid pretense and instead blossoms in the American film history.
I:8652;2772;A rare breed of film is this, one to be collected and admired for years to come.
I:8652;2773;The video transfer to Blu Ray is just about the best you can or will find anywhere and is completely demo worthy.
I:8652;2774;The details in each frame, the coloration of the entire movie are totally outstanding.
I:8652;2775;Even the extra which documents the reproduction of Jaws onto Blu Ray was interesting and informative.
I:8652;2776;Deleted scenes, outtakes, making of and many more extras are included.
I:8652;2777;My home theater is fairly esoteric and hi end and audio is something I am always aware of.
I:8652;2778;if you can do it here, you can do it for any of your films.
I:8652;2779;a great release, a must release.
I:8652;2780;the blu ray transfer is great as are the specials.
I:8652;2781;The extras are fairly good, but not great.
I:8652;2782;The bonus materials include an hour long documentary that is very good with some recent interviews with the major players.
I:8652;2783;I got this movie in my collection because I remember that as a kid it scared me silly.
I:8652;2784;Now the shark looks really fake and it's not as scary, but the video is good and sound adequate for such and old film.
I:8652;2785;Worth having in your collection if you like the movie or for nostalgic reasons.
I:8652;2786;Anyway, the excellent transfer on this movie has to be seen to be believed.
I:8652;2787;I really hope this movie continues to attract audiences, both new and old.
I:8652;2788;I admire the painstaking effort of the cast and crew that went into the making of this movie and I especially applaud Steven Spielberg for sticking his neck out and making movies like this one and Saving Private Ryan.
I:8652;2789;This movie was the first summer blockbuster and it's in a league of its own.
I:8652;2790;In a way, I'm happy to find that I'm open to all types of film.
I:8652;2791;grossing movie ever made in its day.
I:8652;2792;The first hour of the movie sets everything up.
I:8652;2793;Although there's nothing particularly bad about the first half, it's far from remarkable.
I:8652;2794;chief Brody (Scheider) is my favorite character.
I:8652;2795;He's intelligent, sensible, practical and calm under pressure.
I:8652;2796;The most colorful character is Quint (Shaw), who is experienced and outspoken.
I:8652;2797;The fear exists in our minds and we fill in the gaps.
I:8652;2798;the best scene in the movie takes place on the boat.
I:8652;2799;It's a moment of release and humor while they wait for the shark to appear.
I:8652;2800;John Williams created such a simple score, and yet we will never forget those two notes every time the shark is poised to attack.
I:8652;2801;The movie picked up two Oscars in the technical categories, and also won for Best Original Score.
I:8652;2802;jaws deserves its place in movie history.
I:8652;2803;This was one of the first ocean thrillers, and maybe the best.
I:8652;2804;Jaws is probably my favorite Steven Spielberg film, and also one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen.
I:8652;2805;The three actors [Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss] are so perfect in their roles.
I:8652;2806;"The scene where Shaw and Dreyfuss are comparing their scars is priceless
I:8652;2807;This was Spielberg's first big film, and I think it's his most perfect and entertaining.
I:8652;2808;jaws, in my opinion, is an okay movie.
I:8652;2809;The plot is fairly interesting, but I've seen a lot of movies and shows about giant animals wreaking havoc so.yeah.
I:8652;2810;^^ Especially since great white sharks are one of my favorite animals.
I:8652;2811;another thing I notice now that I didn't notice when I was little, is the great chemistry between the three leads.
I:8652;2812;Watching these three together is magic, and it keeps this movie from being yet another people get eaten by monster flicks.
I:8652;2813;But as a people get eaten by monster flick, this is undoubtably the best.
I:8652;2814;measures up pretty dang good, if you ask me.
I:8652;2815;I'm loving these hour long documentaries on the last couple of Spielberg discs.
I:8652;2816;This one is way informative about all aspects of production with interviews with the producers, actors, production designers, shark photographers, and Spielberg himself, this baby lets you in on the trials that went down to make this movie.
I:8652;2817;Great movie, excellent copy and great price.
I:8652;2818;I now have the other three added to my library and look forward to ordering many more.
I:8652;2819;I waited a long time to watch the classic film JAWS because I always heard it was so scary and full of gore.
I:8652;2820;The film is a true landmark in the horror genre mostly because the three main characters (the marine biologist, the police chief and the shark hunter) are so well developed with complete back stories and very well portrayed by fine actors.
I:8652;2821;The plot of the story is rich in themes that go well beyond the man vs giant toothy sea monster we usually think of when someone mentions the film JAWS or hums the trademark theme song.
I:8652;2822;JAWS has truly earned a lasting position in our popular culture.
I:8652;2823;was a gift for my grandson, Thank you
I:8652;2824;five years later, this classic among classics retains its thrilling charm and status as a true (among other things) nail biter!
I:8652;2825;"This edition has a 2 hour ""making of"" documentary in addition to a lot of the same features that the 25th anniversary edition has."
I:8652;2826;A great movie I haven't seen since I was a kid!
I:8652;2827;One of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8652;2828;The acting and story is incredible.
I:8652;2829;I watch it every time it's on TV.
I:8652;2830;Now I can watch it anytime I want!
I:8652;2831;He was thrilled to receive it and now hosts Jaws film nights.
I:8652;2832;This classic has been so lovingly remastered that it looks pristine with details I've never noticed before in any previous version on home video.
I:8652;2833;Must see movie for all younger generation to give an example how good movies are made.
I:8652;2834;All the characters have depth, and add to the movie in their own special way.
I:8652;2835;If you have never seen this movie (which I can't imagine) watch it!
I:8652;2836;Jaws is without a doubt the greatest shark movie ever made and one of the very few of its kind out there.
I:8652;2837;induced audiences and a good load of excellent acting.
I:8652;2838;Starring paranoid Roy Schnieder, nerdy Richard Dreyfuss, and, in one of the best film performances in history.
I:8652;2839;and backed with a chilling Academy Award.
I:8652;2840;winning score, Jaws is a must see in my family.
I:8652;2841;its' because my grandfather, musician Oscar Meza, played the infamous Jaws theme on the bass.
I:8652;2842;Seeing this movie makes our family proud of him.
I:8652;2843;But anyway, Jaws is a classic action film that should be seen by audiences everywhere!
I:8652;2844;It was great watching this classic again.
I:8652;2845;It is however an excellent film in the horror genre.
I:8652;2846;The haunting theme music, composed by John Willimas, still remains the most chilling movie theme in history, and it won Williams an Oscar for Best Original Music for a film.
I:8652;2847;"Jaws is also one of those rare Hollywood films that made the cover of ""Time"" magazine in 1975."
I:8652;2848;"Nowhere near as great as the original, ""Jaws 2"" is a worthy sequel, also starring Scheider."
I:8652;2849;I'll explain why at the end of my review.
I:8652;2850;Not only that, you get an amazing two hour documentary which is worth the cost of the disc alone.
I:8652;2851;If you love this movie, you will treasure this documentary.
I:8652;2852;My son loved the set.
I:8652;2853;It was beautiful on the flat screen.
I:8652;2854;The best in the series and one of the best 100 movies of all time.
I:8652;2855;I never got to see this film upon it's initial release, however I felt it's shock waves even at the tender age of 7.
I:8652;2856;It's the type of film a young lad would sell his entire comic collection to see based on the hype alone.
I:8652;2857;JAWS works on so many levels, that it apeals to ANYONE who loves movies.
I:8652;2858;This movie inspires awe the first time as well as the 20th time viewed.
I:8652;2859;John Williams score is simple and sublime.
I:8652;2860;Jaws Gets 5 Stars because, it is in fact, a flawless film.
I:8652;2861;Pros:Great actorsgreat scenic shotsquint is funny until (see cons)Cons:you can tell the shark was fakeA friend of mine imitates QuintGreat shark movie due to steven spielberg.
I:8652;2862;There are shots so crisp and clear they look like they were shot with a RED Epic last year.
I:8652;2863;I can actually read the labels on the bottles of the medical examiner's office.
I:8652;2864;This title easily competes with the magnificent Blu.
I:8652;2865;ray transfer of THE ROAD WARRIOR and THE SHINING as one of the best possible Blu.
I:8652;2866;It's even better than THE GODFATHER and CHINATOWN Blu.
I:8652;2867;the film gets 6 stars in my book.
I:8652;2868;that brings it up to the 4 you see above.
I:8652;2869;ray (best old movie on blu.
I:8652;2870;ray, by far), but it's pretty good.
I:8652;2871;"Alfred Hitchcock once said ""blondes make the best victims."
I:8652;2872;Steven Spielberg was obviously influenced by these two films, and the proof lies in the fact that his first victim in Jaws is also a blonde young woman.
I:8652;2873;this is the most Hitchcock.
I:8652;2874;esque of Spielberg's films, and arguably it's also his best motion picture.
I:8652;2875;Famously, it is often acclaimed and sometimes blamed, along with Star Wars, as the death of ambitious American filmmaking.
I:8652;2876;invent ambitious American filmmaking in the form of a summer blockbuster?Although there are a handful of great blockbuster films, Jaws is arguably the greatest.
I:8652;2877;It is greatly supported by its three lead actors, it showcases some of the finest editing in a motion picture, and it has a score that, according to Spielberg, is the reason for half the film's success.
I:8652;2878;A great white shark is identified as the underwater devil, and when it has its share of a third victim, the mayor finally gives in: he closes the beaches and allows for an expedition to kill the shark, which is undergone by Brody, Hooper, and a professional shark hunter called Quint (Robert Shaw).
I:8652;2879;some of the power of Jaws lies in the relationship between the three men: Quint is stuck up and proud, while Hooper takes many pre.
I:8652;2880;Brody is the man standing in between them, the one that holds everything together.
I:8652;2881;And what also makes this trio work is the character acting, as this has perhaps the strongest acting of any of Spielberg's films.
I:8652;2882;it would also help that Jaws has a really strong screenplay.
I:8652;2883;It is not Sunset Blvd. to be sure, but it has perhaps the most accomplished dialogue and character dynamics of any blockbuster film.
I:8652;2884;Every character that needs to be strong is strong, and Spielberg's direction is intense and heightens an already great experience.
I:8652;2885;And the pacing is excellent, clearly the best in a blockbuster film.
I:8652;2886;It shows off what a phenomenal director Spielberg was, and it shames all blockbusters made today.
I:8652;2887;up on Brody's face for reasons of fear after a wonderfully suspenseful buildup.
I:8652;2888;Her work was honored with an Oscar for Best Film Editing, and that is a sign of where the Academy made the right decision.
I:8652;2889;In this film, there is no sugary treatment, and that's what separates it from the rest of Spielberg's works: it is the epitome of his action/adventure films, and it is his best film because it plays out like the most real adventure of all time.
I:8652;2890;still the question stands, though: did Jaws and Star Wars destroy great American filmmaking?
I:8652;2891;And the main reason is because all of the elements of the film, especially in the screenplay, are handled with such care, and a good screenplay is seldom seen in today's blockbusters.
I:8652;2892;Both films shed light on a new opportunity for filmmakers, but most of the care is in the action: it can be frivolous and big, but there must be something justifying it.
I:8652;2893;The tail., the whole damn thing.
I:8652;2894;Its up to the town's Chief Of Police (who's afraid of the water), an ictheoligst, and a modernday Ahab to take down the shark.
I:8652;2895;Its still, after thirty years, one of Steven Spielberg's best films.
I:8652;2896;"As a consumer and film buff this is bulls*it, plain and simple (the latest release to ""First Blood"" is also a good example)."
I:8652;2897;the complete unabridged documentary is finally released and it is good.
I:8652;2898;The slipsleeve and coverart has a black foreground and has a photo.
I:8652;2899;for this version) and the music has been, as I said, superbly restored.
I:8652;2900;(This is particularly effective in the underwater music when they find Ben Gardner's boat.)
I:8652;2901;as for the story itself, a few things stand out: this film had some terrific dialogue and insightful scenes of family life, throwaway bits that show Spielberg once had a heart and soul.
I:8652;2902;Just watch, 20 years from now people are going to be just as scared as they were 31 years ago.
I:8652;2903;The movie is what TRUE horror movies are, with the Alfred Hitchcock style of not really seeing the blood and gore during most of the movie, as well as terror and suspense at an all time high.
I:8652;2904;This movie is just a timeless classic.
I:8652;2905;Hard to believe it was released 39 years ago.
I:8652;2906;Have seen it many times and, even though you know what's going to happen, I still find myself watching intently and surprised in all the right places.
I:8652;2907;When this movie came out I was a teenager and that made the film even more suspenseful and scary.
I:8652;2908;I enjoyed watching this again and found that I still got scared at all the proper places.
I:8652;2909;I enjoyed, especially, the fun they had together aboard the fishing vessel before the shark attacked.
I:8652;2910;one and all, I recommend this movie.
I:8652;2911;You will be entertained, spooked, and delighted.
I:8652;2912;we love to see it AFTER we have our vacation at the beach.
I:8652;2913;Jaws is the original summer blockbuster, setting the standard by which all others are measured.
I:8652;2914;"Based on Peter Benchley's bestselling novel, ""Jaws"" centers around the fictional North Atlantic resort island of Amity, which finds itself terrorized by an enormous great white shark."
I:8652;2915;"Our hero is Martin Brody (Roy Scheider in the most underrated performance of his career)
I:8652;2916;estate business) is worth the gamble.
I:8652;2917;What ensues is an epic, archetypal man vs. beast quest that would make Herman Melville and Joseph Campbell proud.
I:8652;2918;Our shark, it turns out, is way above average size, terrifically swift and powerful, and uncannily smart, to boot.
I:8652;2919;Robert Shaw's Quint is one of the greatest anti.
I:8652;2920;heroes the movies have ever seen.
I:8652;2921;He is funny and frightening all at once, and the famous soliloquy in which he recalls the tragic sinking of the USS Indianapolis, where, over the course of a week waiting for rescue, at least 90 US Navy personnel died from shark attack wounds, is one of the most chilling and unforgettable performances ever committed to film.
I:8652;2922;'Jaws' is the movie that made Steven Spielberg's career, and it's among his finest.
I:8652;2923;It's easy to forget because of his enormously successful blockbusters that Spielberg is a phenomenally skillful and artful director.
I:8652;2924;His timing is superb, he mixes horror with comedy to brilliant effect, he gets great performances out of his actors, and his love for special effects has never overwhelmed his understanding of the importance of story and character.
I:8652;2925;That said the most brilliant aspect of 'Jaws' was a serendipitous accident.
I:8652;2926;note theme to create the illusion of the shark's presence in the early scenes.
I:8652;2927;Jaws succeeds on almost every level.
I:8652;2928;Roy Scheider's Brody is a quintessential everyman, an average guy beset by fear and guilt who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances and rises to the occasion.
I:8652;2929;righteous, and his friendship with Brody becomes the backbone of the movie (Spielberg and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb wisely deviated from the novel in regards to the character of Hooper, who was originally Brody's nemesis).
I:8652;2930;Robert Shaw's Quint is a modern.
I:8652;2931;day Captain Ahab, a worthy foe for the malevolent shark.
I:8652;2932;The suspense is potent and the action thrilling, but the humor, emotion, and character development make this movie much more than a summer blockbuster.
I:8652;2933;and amazingly enough, Hollywood has kept its respect for the film and Steven Spielberg .
I:8652;2934;who got vaulted up to the greatest of heights after this, and has a place on Hollywood's Mount Rushmore to this day .
I:8652;2935;It's the story of abnormal shark behaviour (this is important to remember, for the critics who question it .
I:8652;2936;It all comes to a head in the last act, as the Chief and two shark experts hunt the shark at sea and have a confrontation every bit as epic as Moby Dick.
I:8652;2937;It's a adventure ride that hooked me as a young man and never let me go.
I:8652;2938;Certainly the greatest horror film.
I:8652;2939;It's got great acting and the most legendary score of all time.
I:8652;2940;Of all ot the movies I have rated 5 stars, Jaws is definetly the best!
I:8652;2941;The music that is played when the great white shark is about to attack is first rate.
I:8652;2942;Steven Spielberg did a fantastic job directing this movie.
I:8652;2943;This movie is the best movie ever created.
I:8652;2944;The reason this movie was so popular was the sharp plot.
I:8652;2945;This movie is a very scary thriller .
I:8652;2946;What they think is going to be an easy capture, they are wrong and they are in for the thrill of their livesSo if you like thrillers, shark movies, and great classics, check out JAWS you'll never want to go in the watter again.
I:8652;2947;There are bits of Moby Dick the novel here, but really it is pure Hollywood, near its formulaic best.
I:8652;2948;What's great is the mighty trio of Shaw, Benjamin, and Scheider, well beyond formulas.
I:8652;2949;Bought the deluxe 20th anniversary laserdisc.
I:8652;2950;For someone who knows the film frame by frame, it's well worth the 15.20 bucks to be rid of that awful surround mix.
I:8652;2951;The full documentary is nice to have, the booklet's cool, and on and on.
I:8652;2952;"plus times, seeing it and HEARING it the way it's supposed to be is the most ""deluxe"" feature of all."
I:8652;2953;Jaws is ABSOLUTELY one of the 5 best movies ever made, its just what position on your top five list it lands in thats variable.
I:8652;2954;If you have already seen it, its a movie that holds up through countless viewings.
I:8652;2955;Packaging was clean and it arrived within a few days.
I:8652;2956;From the legendary theme from John Williams to the image of a monstrous shark approaching from the depths, Jaws is a classic, a legend, and a masterpiece.
I:8652;2957;jaws has all the elements of a masterpiece.
I:8652;2958;Spielbergs visionary directing is, as always, outstanding, driven by a bubblegum.
I:8652;2959;paced action, complete with likable characters and even some lightheartedness just adds to the experience.
I:8652;2960;What a great movie, scary, funny, dark, and more.
I:8652;2961;Universal did an excellent job of restoring this film.
I:8652;2962;The picture is clear and bright.
I:8652;2963;Even the trailers were polished up for this release.
I:8652;2964;"I loved to go to the Beach and always would swim wayyyyyy out there, well, after seeing ""Jaws"" back in the day, I no longer did that."
I:8652;2965;this movie really affected people and watching it on this new Blu.
I:8652;2966;ray with my very large screen and great sound system, just reinforces how good a movie it is.
I:8652;2967;There are a lot of wonderful elements here, but it's the three lead characters I think, that I like most about the movie.
I:8652;2968;This is really everything you go to the movies for.
I:8652;2969;Obviously, this film is a classic.
I:8652;2970;It's one of those movies that everyone has seen at least once.
I:8652;2971;The cinematography is great, the acting is great, and the script is great.
I:8652;2972;when you think of the films of the seventies,the are a handfull that come to mind right off the bat.
I:8652;2973;with brilliant direction from a then young Stephen Spielberg,an Oscar winning score by John Williams,sensational film editing by Verna Fields, and terrific performances by Roy Schieder,Robert Shaw,and Richard Dryfuss, Jaws is still the ultimate warm weather hit.
I:8652;2974;It is an adventure classic.
I:8652;2975;Got to love Jaws, even after all these years it still is fun to watch.
I:8652;2976;In the beautiful quaint beach resort of Amity Island, something hideous, something so deliciously evil has vanquished the tranquility and shattered the peace.
I:8652;2977;Next, it moved its attention to the children, ripping and tearing as blood turned the calm waters red.
I:8652;2978;Now, something must be done, before it returns to feed.
I:8652;2979;'Jaws' succeeds on almost every level.
I:8652;2980;The suspense is potent and the action thrilling, but the humor, emotion, and character development make this movie entertaining.
I:8652;2981;dU, the most famous music cue brings you in as the words Jaws comes on the screen.
I:8652;2982;jaws is the ultimate it in horror/thriller movies.
I:8652;2983;Steven Spielberg works his directoral magic in new and moving ways, like in the first shark attack when we see a girl swiming in the ocean, as she is attacked, the audience is put head level with her.
I:8652;2984;In a place that we will feel most vulnerable and afraid.
I:8652;2985;Fear of water, is an obvisious one, but also the fear of the unknown.
I:8652;2986;The shark also looks very realistic even today, at least I found it most realistic then the sharks in Deep Blue Sea (I know, I don't like that movie and it shows).
I:8652;2987;john Williams, Steven Spielberg's right hand music man, provides a soundtrack that gives such dynamic effect.
I:8652;2988;bottom Line: The ultimate psychological thriller that will still scare you, even if you know what happens in the end.
I:8652;2989;And we gotta do it quick, that'll bring back your tourists, put all your businesses on a payin' basis.
I:8652;2990;I value my neck a lot more than three thousand bucks, chief.
I:8652;2991;But you've gotta make up your minds.
I:8652;2992;If you want to stay alive, then ante up.
I:8652;2993;A glorious restoration, looking better than any previous incarnation on home video.
I:8652;2994;Obviously, this movie was a big hit years ago and now it gets even better.
I:8652;2995;One of the legendary and most terrifying thrillers ever made, from the future director legend Steven Speilberg, is the first summer blockbuster.
I:8652;2996;The Movie that scared you out of the water and on the edge of your seat.
I:8652;2997;This film is nonstop terrifying thrills,breathtaking and spetacular.
I:8652;2998;A Movie so legendary that it got it's self a thrilling ride at Universal Studios Orlando and Hollywood and I have been to both of them.
I:8652;2999;See this thriling masterpiece it's been in our lives and scared us for 29 years and it's timeless.
I:8652;3000;Oh and See it Before you go swimmingHA HA HA!
I:8652;3001;Movie was brand new and in perfect shape.
I:8652;3002;it was a most enjoyable transaction from beginning to end.
I:8652;3003;It is such a great film to watch.
I:8652;3004;I always enjoyed this film.
I:8652;3005;Robert Shaw should have won best actor for this role.
I:8652;3006;The end of the film will have you cheering for the heros.
I:8652;3007;A good launch for Speilberg, too.
I:8652;3008;Easiest review ever!One of the best films of all time!
I:8652;3009;amazing picture and sound restoration!
I:8652;3010;"see Jaws legacy documentary: ""The Shark Is Still Working""!"
I:8652;3011;Plenty of other extras in this set to enjoy.
I:8652;3012;My favorite film of all time on Blu.
I:8652;3013;There are few movies that truly stand the test of time.
I:8652;3014;No matter how many times you have watched this movie, the story, cast and director pull you back into the water and remind you that the next time you go to the ocean beach, be very afraid!
I:8652;3015;ray picture and sound are fantastic!
I:8652;3016;It makes you jump every time!
I:8652;3017;He has seen it again and again.
I:8652;3018;this as a graet special effects,story,settings,and cast.
I:8652;3019;for more Shark fun see JAWS 2(starring Roy Schiender)
I:8652;3020;My son is a movie collector and really wanted this film on blue ray.
I:8652;3021;it is a welcome addition to his collection.
I:8652;3022;It's a great movie, watch it you don't believe me!
I:8652;3023;One of the top ten movies of all time.
I:8652;3024;There is alot of suspense in this classic monster movie.
I:8652;3025;Yes it really is a sea monster movie, and there are none better.
I:8652;3026;Best movie ever made to begin with.
I:8652;3027;They really cleaner it up and it is like watching it for the first time!
I:8652;3028;The movie Jaws is an amazing movie if you like horror movies, especially shark horror movies.
I:8652;3029;i think this is the best shark movie created, its way better than Deep Blue sea, NOT CHEESY.
I:8652;3030;This is a great movie because it shows the development of the people such as Brody and skipper, from being a police officer and marine biologists, to shark hunters, and how they change in dangerous situations.
I:8652;3031;Not only that the story is great but the characters act perfect.
I:8652;3032;Even my dogs love it.
I:8652;3033;Excellent upgrade to a classic movie.
I:8652;3034;"Same as the original as far as content
I:8652;3035;Jaws transformed the film experience for all of us.
I:8652;3036;"Basically combining ""Moby Dick"" with a monster movie, ""Jaws"" continues to be one of the best films Spielberg directed and one of his most suspenseful."
I:8652;3037;I'm giving 5 stars to the original film.
I:8652;3038;Since they were an important part of the success of the film and they were GREAT trailers, I would love to have them here as well.
I:8652;3039;ray for Jaws looks positively stunning which helps intensify the experience.
I:8652;3040;Colors pop and the film has considerably more depth and detail than previously.
I:8652;3041;the audio sounds stunning as well with an immersive lossless mix that puts you in the action.
I:8652;3042;He was happy to be wrong on all accounts.
I:8652;3043;one of Spielberg's finest films receives a nice, deluxe edition on Blu.
I:8652;3044;ray and is well worth picking up.
I:8652;3045;Jaws may have a slight wrinkle or two but this is probably one of the best digital facelifts that a film has received in recent memory.
I:8652;3046;It comes with the unabridged documentary that was found on laser.
I:8652;3047;Ok lets make this simple.
I:8652;3048;JAWS is my # 1 Favorite movie of all time for an easy reason, it is just a great movie!
I:8652;3049;the acting is good, the action is thrilling, and the story is intense!
I:8652;3050;and it started what we know as the summer blockbuster event season!
I:8652;3051;It Stars Roy Scheider,Richard Dryfus, and Robert Shaw and Directed by future 2x Oscar winner Steven Spielberg.
I:8652;3052;The comunity of Amity Island is terfied by a huge great white shark who finds that Amity Spells lunch!
I:8652;3053;Is this Spielberg's finest film?
I:8652;3054;It is brilliant in every way, and shows how a movie doesn't have to sacrifice plot and character for action and suspense.
I:8652;3055;Jaws touches a primal fear in humanity.
I:8652;3056;When I was a kid it was one of those films that was inescapable.
I:8652;3057;It did scare me, but it also exhilirated me, and inspired my deep and lasting love for movies.
I:8652;3058;Having such colorful characters allows us to escape into the film.
I:8652;3059;The climax is terrific, a blueprint for later action movies.
I:8652;3060;This film is a classic.
I:8652;3061;Stop sticking it to those of us that are the biggest movie fans.
I:8652;3062;This is taking it's toll on the studios.
I:8652;3063;If this trend doesn't stop, we're going to see drastic changes in the entertainment world.
I:8652;3064;Great movie, great writing, great scenes all around 5 star.
I:8652;3065;Jaws is the perfect example of a classic.
I:8652;3066;Even after 25 years , Jaws can be ranked along The Exorcist as a true classic , both films still have the power to conjure our deepest fears and both can still leave our mouths parched after each viewing.
I:8652;3067;ray release of Jaws is spectacular!
I:8652;3068;The extras included on the discs are informative and fun.
I:8652;3069;But the restored version of the film itself is stunning!
I:8652;3070;Colors pop off the screen, everything is sharp, focused, and brilliant.
I:8652;3071;"What better way to wrap up my horror ""reviewing streak"" than to pay tribute to one of the lead actors in the best monster film ever made."
I:8652;3072;I've always said that the best horror films are the ones that hit close to home, with factors anyone can relate to.
I:8652;3073;Jaws made a lot of people so afraid to go into the water.
I:8652;3074;"Masterfully directed by Steven Spielberg, based on Peter Benchley's novel which was inspired by the New Jersey Shark attacks of 1916 dubbed
I:8652;3075;The film is truly an enduring classic and such a phenomenon.
I:8652;3076;to have a great time.
I:8652;3077;"everyone knows the film's plot and premise, honestly, I've seen ""Jaws"" countless times."
I:8652;3078;I can tell you that the film is so well.
I:8652;3079;directed and effective that even an 8 year old could feel the chills and excitement.
I:8652;3080;"So what made ""Jaws"" so great?"
I:8652;3081;The haunting music, the feel of the unknown in the beginning, the well.
I:8652;3082;rounded and interesting characters, and of course, the giant Great White Shark.
I:8652;3083;The film was fated to be in the annals (yes, Chris, I said it again LOL) of excellent film.
I:8652;3084;Jaws had the hand of fate working for it.
I:8652;3085;"the characters in ""Jaws"" are actually the ones who really carried the film."
I:8652;3086;"The performances by its cast headed by the trio of Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw ""clicked"" so well
I:8652;3087;"Dreyfuss is a marine biologist with a passion for sharks
I:8652;3088;He uses his own money to fund his research most of the time.
I:8652;3089;"The most interesting character for me is Quint, played by Robert Shaw
I:8652;3090;"Although ""Bruce"" may be a bit dated by today's standards, but trust me, this film is timeless, not because of its special effects, but the excellent script, direction and well."
I:8652;3091;winning musical score by John Williams, the film definitely exudes intimidation.
I:8652;3092;I truly thought that the film was made with care and creativity.
I:8652;3093;JAWS was so successful that it spawned 3 sequels and a lot of knock.
I:8652;3094;"off
I:8652;3095;The film is definitely one of the most brilliant, defining moments in film.
I:8652;3096;It is a timeless masterpiece, which will undoubtedly endure forever and make future generations afraid to go back in the water.
I:8652;3097;[5 stars]This review is dedicated to Roy Scheider.
I:8652;3098;The 25th anniversary deluxe repackaging of Jaws gives this classic the presentation it deserves.
I:8652;3099;full of goodies like interviews,behind the scenes vignettes(particularly entertaining) as well as a trivia game to test your knowledge of sharks,this is a must have.
I:8652;3100;the film itself,is ,of coarse,one of the best ever,a beautifully simple story told with pitch.
I:8652;3101;perfect skill and executed grandly.
I:8652;3102;great performances,spectacular direction,instantly recognizable score.
I:8652;3103;Now I've introduced it to my daughter at the same age.
I:8652;3104;ray is so much clearer than the original it is like watching a new movie.
I:8652;3105;I also liked the extras where they interviewed the cast and director.
I:8652;3106;Even though I have only seen the trailer and previews in the past the full movie was still a thriller and kept my interest throughout the whole movie.
I:8652;3107;In the Lawrence of Arabia special features is an interview with Spielberg.
I:8652;3108;One of the greatest directors in Cinema and he has never provided any commentary on any of his films.
I:8652;3109;This is a great film, done well in Blu.
I:8652;3110;I go surfing about twice every year it's great for the soul but I get freaked out every time not gonna lie
I:8652;3111;it was so clear and bright.
I:8652;3112;the DTS sound was ok I give it 4 star for it,the widescreen format is good too is better then pan.
I:8652;3113;Good performances by the cast.
I:8652;3114;A good mix of humor and fright.
I:8652;3115;There are some films that no matter how much time passes after their debut, they still completely hold up.
I:8652;3116;Jaws is EXACTLY one of those films.
I:8652;3117;"in terms of suspense, ""Jaws"" may just take the cake for the top prize all."
I:8652;3118;A remarkable piece of filmmaking, for sure.
I:8652;3119;It also features a collection of iconic characters that still remain a joy to watch.
I:8652;3120;sheriff lets us relate to the story in a much more personal aspect, while Dreyfuss' Hooper is insightful, hilarious, and provides some of the best dialogue of the whole show.
I:8652;3121;Of course, Shaw as Quint nearly steals the show at times with the complexity and jocularity he manages to portray in the single character.
I:8652;3122;its a good movie i have always liked it but its even better in high definition.
I:8652;3123;"This movie is one of those ""life altering"" movies."
I:8652;3124;The dry humor and sarcasism between Quinn and Hooper are worth the price of admission alone.
I:8652;3125;"The deer in the headlights look by Chief Brody when he finally sees the shark while ""chumming"" is my favorite part!"
I:8652;3126;The terror gets passed to another generation.
