I:9943;1;Fairy tale for adults: I hear that a lot, that expression.
I:9943;2;Pan's Labyrinth comes to mind.
I:9943;3;(Ebert is a national treasure.)
I:9943;4;Read into it what you will, if you feel the desire to do so.
I:9943;5;I myself have mostly just enjoyed the imagery and I think the film is an unabashed celebration of film as primarily a visual medium.
I:9943;6;I can't recommend this film enough, it's a real stunner.
I:9943;7;If you are a fan of Terry Gilliam's Brazil then you'll really admire this film.
I:9943;8;ive played the game in 1997 n playstation , now i watched the movie , amazing story line , great atmospher , wonder if they will remake it , itll be good hit for bluckbuster , .
I:9943;9;City of Lost children is an original, zany, beautiful masterwork that captured my imagination with every frame.
I:9943;10;Even in its darkness is remains uplifting and extremely funny at moments.
I:9943;11;out gutsy to make it, and I am grateful.
I:9943;12;"The music in this video is amazing, not to mention the story, I like it for the fantasy theory as well as the ""tripyness"" of the plot."
I:9943;13;The charactors played their parts well, and I will watch it again and again.
I:9943;14;When you watch it the first time you will watch it once again, and again.
I:9943;15;The music is simply the best.
I:9943;16;The set design and the effects are wonderful.
I:9943;17;But I kept watching, and I was drawn into the story.
I:9943;18;The adventure by itself is fascinating, and the characters live on in your mind long after the credits roll.
I:9943;19;"The entire movie is reminiscent of a dream itself
I:9943;20;paul Gaultier add to the overall lush style.
I:9943;21;See also Delicatessen, by the same director.
I:9943;22;The City of Lost Children gets two platinum stars and also moves up to one of my top ten favorite films of all time.
I:9943;23;This is the style that due to a connection of unrelated events something extraordinary happens.
I:9943;24;Let me give you an example from this film: There is a scene where the girl and One (Ron Pearlman.
I:9943;25;imagine this times ten, and you have this film.
I:9943;26;keep in mind this is a French film with English subtitles, so you are not only getting the true voice of the film, but seeing the darkness of the cinematography without any American input.
I:9943;27;This really shows the purpose behind making this film, it really takes you to a new place so dark and dreamlike that you the viewer actually feel like you are in the picture itself.
I:9943;28;City of Lost Children is a great movie.
I:9943;29;It is a great movie you will watch time and time again.
I:9943;30;Ron Perlman plays a great roll in this film.
I:9943;31;This is one of my ultimate favourite movies.
I:9943;32;The visual effects are simply stunning and the expressions and faces of the characters are incredible (Daniel Emilfork makes Rowan Atchison look like a slacker)!
I:9943;33;pierre Jeunet's eerie cinematic genius.
I:9943;34;A pact is formed, and the strongman and the children (particularly a girl named Miette) delve into the dream.
I:9943;35;This is one of my favourite films of all time.
I:9943;36;The cinematography is unique, I find it odd and slightly out of focus how a previous reviewer mentioned, it had a look similar to The Matrix, that's like comparing poop with hand cream.
I:9943;37;The film isn't bounded by CGI at all, and the story line is nicely thought.
I:9943;38;out and ambitious with marvelous acting.
I:9943;39;great film, so watch it!
I:9943;40;Nice to know that Terry Gilliam is a fan and supporter of directors Caro and Jeunet because one thinks immediately of his masterpiece, Brazil when watching this visual phantasmagoria.
I:9943;41;top visual inventiveness where everything familiar is suddenly unfamiliar.
I:9943;42;There is also an overpowering sense of place, the directors have created a world and we are consumed by it.
I:9943;43;Lost Children is every bit as dark as Brazil, but there's a sweetness also, mostly emanating from the friendship between One, Ron Perlman, and Miette, Judith Vittet.
I:9943;44;Perlman is perfect, able to communicate more with a nod of his head than most actors can with a well crafted speech.
I:9943;45;Miette is an ideal foil for him and Ms. Vittet brings extraordinary assurance to the part.
I:9943;46;In a film of bizarre, often hilarious excess, their relationship is treated with quiet delicacy, providing a welcome ray of hope.
I:9943;47;according to the commentary, Daniel Emilfork, Krank, was no pleasure on the set, but his performance is brilliant.
I:9943;48;The further into this dream you dig, the odder it gets.
I:9943;49;This is a lovingly crafted film, one could watch it over and over and still see things for the first time.
I:9943;50;the City of Lost Children is as foreign, fascinating, and vividly real an atmosphere as can ever be found .
I:9943;51;I had seen this movie a couple of years ago and I have always wanted to see it since.
I:9943;52;"I bought it finally and I'd have to say that I liked it alot more the first time, and it is not a movie I can watch ""over and over""This movie is very dark, and there are alot of subtle funny parts to it."
I:9943;53;The cinematography is beautiful, and the children in the movie are superb actors.
I:9943;54;I suggest this movie if you don't mind subtitles and you have an open mind and a good sense of humor.
I:9943;55;If you like this movie you should also see Delicatessen.
I:9943;56;all I can say is this movie is messed up.
I:9943;57;"looking woman, and a brain encased in a box filled with liquid and a megaphone so it can ""speak"")."
I:9943;58;For anyone that appreciates art and cinematography this is a must see.
I:9943;59;The brilliant team of Jeunet Caro, creative genuises behind Delicatessen , have developed the masterpiece of dark fantasy 'City of Lost Children'.
I:9943;60;This film, a mixture of stunning special effects and provacative cinematography is no doubt a creation well before its time, (the cinematography, set and character designs are shadowed in more recent American productions such as 'Dark City').
I:9943;61;Doomed to a place in the Cult Classics section in any video store, this work combines haunting visual effects with steady dramatic acting.
I:9943;62;Placed in an elaborately designed world, and composed to a stirring score by Angelo Badalamenti, this film will no doubt capture the passion of all movie.
I:9943;63;This is a beautiful film, a surreal fairy tale, with a quite interesting metaphorical story.
I:9943;64;The cinematography is brilliant, as is the music and acting.
I:9943;65;What is most fascinating is the writing.
I:9943;66;It takes a simple story and with subtle clues and symbols, tells another story.
I:9943;67;Krank and the Clones have been working closely with the Cyclops to kidnap children so Krank can steal their dreams.
I:9943;68;If you enjoy thinking a bit, watch this movie.
I:9943;69;This is a really cool movie.
I:9943;70;This is definitely a French film.
I:9943;71;i'm a big fan of Ron Perlman (as is anybody who's seen Hellboy most likely) and he's wonderful in this.
I:9943;72;The entire cast is compelling and a joy to watch, even if you're confused.
I:9943;73;I especially loved Daniel Emilfork as a very sad bad guy.
I:9943;74;this is probably not the movie for those who don't like quirky humor and surreal visuals, but I loved it.
I:9943;75;This filmThe City Of Lost Childrenby directors Jeunet and Caro is not easy to understand, but it IS very good.
I:9943;76;I preferred listening to the original French language audio track because the inflections and voices of the named actors is much better in the original language than it is in the voices of the dubbed version, but they also are good, just not as good as the actual actors.
I:9943;77;the commentary track is really quite insightful and pleasant.
I:9943;78;Ron Perlman shares helpful information that is doubly enjoyable when you listen to him.
I:9943;79;His comments reveal an intelligent, articulate, and compassionate man who is also very respectful of the directors and other actors in the film.
I:9943;80;In other words, I don't always want to know how something was done or how much it cost, but occasionally it is interesting.
I:9943;81;If you don't mind reading subtitles, you might enjoy this film as much as I!
I:9943;82;This story was twisted in a fun way.
I:9943;83;I loved the colors used to create the children's storybook look to it.
I:9943;84;a few of my friends didn't like it because it was too confusing and subtitled, but if you just let yourself go and relax it will be a fun ride.
I:9943;85;The special effects are fluid and not overdone.
I:9943;86;there are a lot of hidden layers to this movie, much like your classic children's stories.
I:9943;87;I like it more each time I watch it.
I:9943;88;I think, personally, that movie is novel and great.
I:9943;89;TCOLC is a french movie and inherits all its attributes.
I:9943;90;Kind of a slow movie, but a very good one!
I:9943;91;Outstanding eye candy, and a decent story line to boot!
I:9943;92;The concepts in this film are also quite enthralling, and .
I:9943;93;It is the most truly dream.
I:9943;94;like movie I have ever encountered, with dream.
I:9943;95;While the story is an excellent one, hovever, working complex and believable charcters through glorious surrealism into a satisfying whole, it is the *look* and *sound* of the thing that are absolutely unmissable if one harbors any taste for the wierd.
I:9943;96;see it in French, subtitled.
I:9943;97;The sense of entering another land entirely is heightened, pleasantly so, by so many gravelly, chirpy, and strident voices all nattering on in a language one can't quite understand.
I:9943;98;even if it means eating Top Ramen for a while, it will be entirely worthwhile.
I:9943;99;Well crafted dystopian fantasy for anyone that enjoys a masterpiece.
I:9943;100;Very sarcastic with strange sense of humor.
I:9943;101;A friend of mine, whose opinion I usually respect, called this movie overproduced.
I:9943;102;design with a purpose, which thereby carries meaning.
I:9943;103;"The creators intentionally draw your eye away from the characters to the details of the city which surrounds them
I:9943;104;It's about cities and about children , and about the relationship that children have, as a human demographic class, to life in cities, which is the Primary Effect of Modern Life.
I:9943;105;"For the city has its child survivors, and they are creatures of pure intelligence
I:9943;106;effect also sustains and provides luck for the clever.
I:9943;107;The City of Lost Children stands as a telling caricature of such indifference that actually exists in our world, and a testament to the survival power of children.
I:9943;108;Still if you have a chance to see this film I suggest you do!
I:9943;109;There's so much to look at you'll never take it all in with one viewing.
I:9943;110;The makers of City have created a world unlike anything you've seen outside of Terry Gilliam's Brazil.
I:9943;111;Even if the story totally sucked (it doesn't) I would own this just to sit back and watch the gorgeous visuals!Almost as stunning as the picture is the sound.
I:9943;112;The vivid sound effects are spot on.
I:9943;113;If you hate subtitles then this movie may make it worth your while to learn some french!
I:9943;114;I for one enjoy the sound of the french language.
I:9943;115;THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN is a fantastic film from visionary directors Caro and Jeunet.
I:9943;116;Later Jeunet would helm ALIEN RESURRECTION, and they created the fantastic DELICATESSEN.
I:9943;117;But here is one of their most beloved creations in all its glory!
I:9943;118;Along the way their adventures are painted in big splashy set pieces populated with oddball characters that loom larger than life.
I:9943;119;See it in widescreen, dubbed or French, or listen to the revealing commentary with American star Ron Perlman and Jeunet.
I:9943;120;Fans of BRAZIL and DARK CITY will be delighted.
I:9943;121;Fashionistas can revel in the incredible costumes from Gaultier!
I:9943;122;The story and the imagery were so amazing, the characters so compelling that I watched right over again (I never do that).
I:9943;123;the performances were amazing .
I:9943;124;Gaultier's costumes were subdued (for him), but so perfect for this film.
I:9943;125;This is a wonderful movie for anyone who likes dark, surreal steampunk with a heavy dose of what.
I:9943;126;bombing bug, the people with mechanical third eyes, or cloned brothers and conjoined sisters and a deep.
I:9943;127;pierre Jeunet (DELICATESSEN andAmelie) THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN is an intensely imagistic film you don't really HAVE TO understand to catch the gist of it and, as a great fan of his work, I can tell you that this is a movie made for people who are driven by uniquely assembled images and intensely visual story telling.
I:9943;128;"caro and Jeunet's audience come to see movies crafted for people with terrific imaginations
I:9943;129;caro and Jeunet know their movie's target audience is the kind that would be happy to study single frames of the movie, marveling in their intensely crafted genius.
I:9943;130;"The set pieces are filled with lush and active eye candy that packs the screen with vibrant activity: dripping waterworks
I:9943;131;in such a movie, sets are often full of imagery that shrink the power of the individual: steel girders and impenetrable iron walls surround them in maze.
I:9943;132;"like fashion
I:9943;133;so who CAN win in a topsy.
I:9943;134;The answer makes as much sense as the movie: children.
I:9943;135;tHE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN is a movie for those who want to gather and marvel at images, for those who love irony and bewilderment and visual punk.
I:9943;136;From the opening frames of a little boy's Christmas eve dream turned nightmare, this remarkable film by Jeunet and Caro (Delicatessen) is a singular cinematic achievement.
I:9943;137;This comictragic nightmare boasts some of the most extensive sets ever constructed (the entire city was built in a huge warehouse)and elaborate special effects that were so cutting edge they still boggle the senses today.
I:9943;138;the score is lush and haunting, a great enhancement to a unique and in its own way, perfect film.
I:9943;139;This version is far superior to others I have seen.
I:9943;140;The dubbed version was much improved over older releases.
I:9943;141;If you can't figure out what is going on, it's OK.
I:9943;142;Jeunet, in fact wanted to keep his cast unsettled and in the dark, and a dark place it is indeed.
I:9943;143;All the villains, and even the hero, One, (Ron Perlman in another highly idiosyncratic role), are groteques.
I:9943;144;In that respect, the movie is a reflection of how all children sometimes see the world of adults through the filtering lens of their active imaginations.
I:9943;145;Jeunet wants us to see that world from a similar perspective.
I:9943;146;the cast is uniformly excellent.
I:9943;147;The young actress playing Miette (Judith Vittet) is personable and beautiful.
I:9943;148;The cinematographer is a genius.
I:9943;149;It's such a unique and captivating movie that I tried it in all three modes.
I:9943;150;creative, original film making, by all means check this one out.
I:9943;151;The City of Lost Children (Cite des enfants perdus) is perhaps the most visually striking film I have ever seen.
I:9943;152;The film is also one of the most difficult but with patience the careful viewer will be rewarded.
I:9943;153;Directed by Jeunet and Caro the film is a fairy tale for adults.
I:9943;154;It is an exploration of the idea of innocence.
I:9943;155;The innocence of a child and the innocence of a childlike adult.
I:9943;156;in a magical world a scientist (Daniel Emilfork) who cannot dream on his own is kidnapping children and stealing their dreams.
I:9943;157;Along the way he meets Miette (Judith Vittet)a nine year old girl wise beyond her years.
I:9943;158;Together they brave the strange and mythical world of the City of Lost Children to recover the brother.
I:9943;159;The visuals created by Jean Rebasse are truly stunning as are the costumes of Jean.
I:9943;160;Watch it for the visuals and the story will begin to emerge.
I:9943;161;the disc contains a commentary track by Perlman and Jeunet, talent files and production and costume galleries.
I:9943;162;pierre Jeunet always does a fantastic job with his films, if you liked this check out his newest film Mic.
I:9943;163;If you love movies from director Terry Gilliam, as I do, you will really dig this one as well.
I:9943;164;Somewhat in the spirit of Time Bandits, it is very French in many ways.
I:9943;165;But it is a beautiful, fantastical world that is created, and definitely funny.
I:9943;166;man, is this nicely done.
I:9943;167;The subtitles are in yellow and below the frame line, for the most part, leaving you with an unobtruded.
I:9943;168;Shot entirely in studio, the attention to detail in all locations from the Dickensian style city to Krank's gothic lair is phenominal.
I:9943;169;i enjoyed it the first time through.
I:9943;170;most notably Pinon's that sounded impossibly aristocratic!
I:9943;171;I therefore switched to the original French with English subtitles and would certainly recommend that as the preferred audio option.
I:9943;172;All of the children in the film are beautiful and all the adults are grotesque.
I:9943;173;As a European film, the plot and imagery are influenced by Freud, especially around the topic of the love a child may begin to feel for an adult.
I:9943;174;putting because you will be totally entertained during that period of perplexity with odd characters doing odd things for odd reasons.
I:9943;175;The opening scene where some frightening Santa Clause clones come down a chimney to steal little children from their crib clues you in that the images in this film will be unique.
I:9943;176;My favorite characters were the Siamese twin sisters who organize a pack of orphan thieves.
I:9943;177;They were brilliant in every scene.
I:9943;178;There are pet fleas with the ability to inject deadly drugs and one.
I:9943;179;ron Perlman is excellent in the lead, a character called One, a giant circus strongman with curly red hair who is searching for his tiny kidnapped brother with curly blond hair.
I:9943;180;Daniel Emilfork is also great as the evil scientist Krank.
I:9943;181;in regard to style, I found Marc Caro and Jean.
I:9943;182;pierre Jeunet's esthetic approach to be most like American director, Tim Burton.
I:9943;183;Jean Paul Gauthier's costumes were great, never over the top or the center of attention, but always unique and in keeping with the darkness of the film.
I:9943;184;I recommend it for the film esthetics and unique storytelling.
I:9943;185;Fascinating movie, one that I recommend to my buds.
I:9943;186;Everything about this film is simply amazing.
I:9943;187;defined characters, the brilliant costumes and sets, the film score, the effects .
I:9943;188;Watching The City of Lost Children is like seeing the very best of Terry Gilliam's films mixed with equal parts The Wizard of Oz, The Dark Crystal, and Labyrinth.
I:9943;189;Its a very weird movie, but its extremeley well thought out and well done.
I:9943;190;This is in my top 5 favorite films of all time!
I:9943;191;Such a brilliant and original title.
I:9943;192;the beautiful, yet dull use, of reds and greens in the imagery.
I:9943;193;Nevertheless, he doesn't speak as much as I'd thought he would and his acting is still wonderful and well.
I:9943;194;The entire cast was excellent!
I:9943;195;This movie was inspired by a video game, The background scenes look very much like they do in the game.
I:9943;196;I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy/adventure flicks, or those who remember playing the game.
I:9943;197;I liked Judith Vittets' character .
I:9943;198;the most, She was a smart and likeable character.
I:9943;199;I have watched both versions of this movie, therefore, I recommend the french version w/english subtitles!
I:9943;200;This film, from the directing team of Jeunet and Caro (also behind Delicatessen), is best approached on its own terms.
I:9943;201;and this French film, as well as his English work.
I:9943;202;I was enthralled by the visuals in this film.
I:9943;203;The effects involving having three or more clones onscreen at the same time are particularly impressive.
I:9943;204;Obviously the plot is a bit odd, but it's the way the story is told that is so engrossing.
I:9943;205;And the acting is superb, specifically the young heroine, who seems years beyond her age.You will fall into this picture.
I:9943;206;But I simply became entranced with the incredible characters and fantastic story line.
I:9943;207;The setting is so dark but the story was so sweet and fairytale like.
I:9943;208;All in all a great movie with stunning visuals and a unique story.
I:9943;209;THis is a very strange movie, and that is a good thing.
I:9943;210;While not a perfect movie, the actors and story are engaging and interesting.
I:9943;211;"Suffice it to say that if you like strange movies that are ""outside the box"", you will enjoy this."
I:9943;212;"This is one of your ""most of what I learned about the film came from reading the plot summary"" kind of movie."
I:9943;213;It's fascinating in its dark, fantastical way, of course, but I would really have liked to have a plot I could follow.
I:9943;214;Fortunately, the film does have one saving grace .
I:9943;215;basically, the film is about this strange man who steals children, hooks them up to machines, and steals their dreams because he is incapable of dreaming himself.
I:9943;216;the relationship between One and Miette is really the heart of the story.
I:9943;217;Theirs is a bond much like an older brother to a younger sister, but I'm one of those who felt that the relationship really walked a fine line between something wholesome and something a little beyond the pale.
I:9943;218;there is, fittingly enough, a dream.
I:9943;219;A tighter story line, though, would undoubtedly have made this otherwise lush and intriguing film more successful.
I:9943;220;It is true that City of Lost Children is a visually stunning movie, with some truly breathtaking sets and a feeling of atmosphere that few American films can match.
I:9943;221;The movie is part dream, part fairy tale, with bold, simple characters and a bold, colorful setting.
I:9943;222;It's ultimately a fairy tale for adults, and doesn't aspire to reinvent the dramatic wheel.
I:9943;223;Very few movies create a compelling, absorbing sense of time and place, and many of those rush through them self.
I:9943;224;It allows you a good, long look at this other time and place, and I found that a highly rewarding change from the average movie experience.You owe it to yourself to watch this at least once.
I:9943;225;It's a gorgeously made film, and film is ultimately a visual medium.
I:9943;226;The world follows it's own twisted logic which enchants the viewer and draws them deeper into the director's vision.
I:9943;227;the entire movie combines to create a sort of fairly tale nightmare.
I:9943;228;It combines otherworldly beauty with twisted evil to create a haunting dreamscape.
I:9943;229;I generally enjoy weird, off.
I:9943;230;the sets are wild and wonderful.
I:9943;231;The characters are certainly unique.
I:9943;232;Anyway,it's a weird movie but enjoyable.
I:9943;233;This is easily his best work, and I like Amelie just fine.
I:9943;234;Now everyone knows Ron Pearlman as Hellboy.
I:9943;235;It is visually unique and even unlike other Jeunet films.
I:9943;236;that still has grip on my inner child.
I:9943;237;Amelie has a lot of green and is very pretty.
I:9943;238;I saw this film several years ago and found it striking and memorable.
I:9943;239;Gorgous, witty, stunning script, superb acting,bent and twisted plot, NEED I SAY MORE.
I:9943;240;you seldom encounter a movie that has a very simple yet interesting story that is well rendered for viewing with a basic fairy tale structure and the finishing of an intellectual.
I:9943;241;Probably the most visually interesting movie to date.
I:9943;242;making like this might not ever come from the US: it's smart, funny, dark, interesting, very strange.
I:9943;243;the music is eery and quaint and wonderful.
I:9943;244;If you truly enjoy movies such as the new Godzilla then you might want to pass this one by.
I:9943;245;If you liked Cube or Pi or Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai or Baron von Munchausen or Time Bandits or Princess Bride etc. then you will love this one.
I:9943;246;the colors are just amazing.
I:9943;247;highly creative and inventive, with some distinct Rube Goldberg and Terry Gilliam influences
I:9943;248;A great fairy tale movie for adults that won't disappoint.
I:9943;249;The cinematography is so beautiful and so well done, that I can find new things in the background each time I watch it.
I:9943;250;There are some parts that may disturb children, but the main reason I don't recommend it for them is because it will fly right over their heads.
I:9943;251;a child he has captured is the brother of a strongman named one and one is determined to get him back.
I:9943;252;this film is now in my top five
I:9943;253;It took me about three times watching it to understand the plot completely, but it was well worth it.
I:9943;254;The children in the movie are fabulos, and the visuals are really amazing.
I:9943;255;this film has so much potential.
I:9943;256;Some of the characters, while weirdly surreal and bizarre, are remarkable.
I:9943;257;The Siamese twin masterminds are both amusing, as well as a little frightening.
I:9943;258;There is the former master of the flea circus, who now uses his fleas to perform assassinations.
I:9943;259;It's a fairy tale in film noire.
I:9943;260;It's a visual delight, and an enjoyable trip.
I:9943;261;enjoyable until we sort out what's between One and Miette .
I:9943;262;Having thorougly enjoyed the film up to this point, I spent the remainder thoroughly loathing it, and many scenes and interactions between the two protagonists literally made my jaw drop.
I:9943;263;there are other issues that make this film unsuitable for children, namely that there is a tremendous amount of violence directed AT children.
I:9943;264;Not something to give children pleasant dreams, to be sure.
I:9943;265;This movie is a truly wonderful exaple of what fantasy storytelling can be.
I:9943;266;This is truly a cinematic marvel for your eyes, combined with excellent acting.
I:9943;267;I guarantee you will love it!!!
I:9943;268;The City Of Lost Children is an excellent and outstanding film.
I:9943;269;I admit the first time I viewed the film, I liked it, but I was not a huge fan of it.
I:9943;270;But on subsequent viewings I found it to be a great film.
I:9943;271;The film itself is in French, with subtitles.
I:9943;272;I myself prefer the French with English subtitles.
I:9943;273;If you like films with outstanding visuals, look no further, this film has it all.
I:9943;274;The surrealism in the film must have been a cinematographers and special effects persons dream come true.
I:9943;275;And although Ron Perlman and cast did an excellent acting job, the kudos in this film belongs to the set designers who must have had a field day with this one.
I:9943;276;although I continually find myself looking at the visuals when I view the film, the story itself is rather unique.
I:9943;277;[And the children in the film do a superb acting job too!]
I:9943;278;"The film is very moody
I:9943;279;He is simple minded, which is important to the story, because it is due to his simple.
I:9943;280;mindedness that the children in the city are able to trust him, and later help him.
I:9943;281;This is due to the fact the children feel comfortable with him: As the adults in the film are not to be trusted.
I:9943;282;But it is well worth the extra viewings.
I:9943;283;This is a very good film.
I:9943;284;I believe the film is great.
I:9943;285;I'll have to say that this movie is one of the scariest and saddest movies that I've ever seen, although it is very unique and even enjoyable at times because of the insane amounts of creativity that is present in every single scene.
I:9943;286;"another note
I:9943;287;well, those are my thoughts.
I:9943;288;An excellent movie with a classic sub.
I:9943;289;Ultimatly, he destroys himself and his creation at the end of the movie, leaving the rest of mankind to fend for themselves.
I:9943;290;The only smart people in the movie are the children, while 'The city of lost children' are really the adults.6) Organized religion is reflected in the 'Cyclops' religious cult who cuts out their eyes so that they may 'see the light' more clearly.
I:9943;291;City of Lost Children is a great movie that is hard to find due to it being a foreign movie.
I:9943;292;Thanks to it being available on Amazon @ a good price, I now own the movie.
I:9943;293;This will capture you from the first scene to the last.
I:9943;294;She is an Adorable Child.
I:9943;295;She has so much natural talent.
I:9943;296;His facial expressions are Incredible and show tremendous emotion.
I:9943;297;Ron Perelman is Great and convincing.
I:9943;298;sound system you will really Experience this movie.
I:9943;299;I have seen it about 8 times and I have started to look around the screen at places you usually don`t look at during the first few times of viewing.
I:9943;300;There is such intricate detail it is mezmerizing.
I:9943;301;i highly recommend setting the language to English with English sub.
I:9943;302;It is Definately worth putting up with these two things and follow the journey into the dark, archaic, bizarre world.
I:9943;303;To my way of thinking, this is the best of the three.
I:9943;304;Cool story, comic bookie visuals, great, efficient acting, just all.
I:9943;305;Like anything by Terry Gilliam, this fantasy world is perfectly self.
I:9943;306;A wonderfully strange film, with a beautiful story (a love story?)
I:9943;307;, crisp cinematography, amazing production design, and a rich score by Angelo Badalementi (he composed music for all of David Lynch's films).
I:9943;308;I can honestly say that it still ranks in my top 10 all time favorite films (although I'm not sure what the other 9 are).
I:9943;309;I absolutely love this movie as it is unmatched in artistic vision, unless of course you count Gilliam, Burton, and Jackson (Heavenly Creatures before LOTR).
I:9943;310;After the third of fourth viewing, the story began to make much more sense.
I:9943;311;Give it a few more viewings and I'm sure you will agree that the open.
I:9943;312;Every great song, film or piece of art takes needs time to marinate in order to fully appreciate every dynamic layer.
I:9943;313;This film was very artistic and more surreal than anything!
I:9943;314;I love surreal artsy missunderstood movies such as these.
I:9943;315;pierre Jeunet are incredibly imaginative visual artists, reminiscent of Terry Gilliam at his best.
I:9943;316;placed subtitles,and menus and special features that are in Korean or some other S. e. asian language.
I:9943;317;that one also has better features,e. g.,commentary by Jeunet and Perlman etc.
I:9943;318;A beautiful film ratcheted through the small window of a deep sea helmet, where images of the eyepiece appear alongside those of The Artful Dodger, where the science of the codpiece went terribly wrong, so much so as to cause one to wonder, Will anyone ever offer a better definition of steampunk?
I:9943;319;A mad scientist has lost the power of dream and kidnaps children in order to steal their dreams.
I:9943;320;once more the innovative minds of Marc Caro and Pierre Jeunet could make it possible this weird but poignant story .
I:9943;321;You may consider this movie extremely fantastic , only if you watch it with rational eyes abandoning the dark poetry involved in it .
I:9943;322;a triumph of the fertile imagination of these two creative authors .
I:9943;323;inmensely entertaining and visually stunning!
I:9943;324;Although plot can be a bit confusing for the average viewer whose first language is not visual, the story of the mad scientist kidnapping children to steal their dreams is fascinating and metaphorically accurate.
I:9943;325;A brain floating in a glass aquarium, commands a set of clones made from the original scientist.
I:9943;326;Through these clones and the innocent children, the filmmakers show that childhood can embody both selfishness and cruelty as well as joy and innocense.
I:9943;327;Visually stunning, the evil, sinister, and moody tone is balanced by humor.
I:9943;328;Such combinations are not only a mark of sophistication, but also of grace.
I:9943;329;The superior technical efforts only added to the overall storytelling process
I:9943;330;fest that the cover may make you believe!
I:9943;331;The movie has a sense of humor that goes perfectly with its theme.
I:9943;332;i found this movie amazing!
I:9943;333;The effects were excellent, and the sets were bewildering in their attention to detail.
I:9943;334;Dominique Pinon plays his (7) clones very well, and the guy playing Krank is perfect for the part .
I:9943;335;he has the mad scientist look, and he plays it like a master.
I:9943;336;the characters in the Krank family brought back memories of playing the game Maniac Mansion.
I:9943;337;Cool idea though!Everyone played their parts superbly, but I think the one who stole the show was the pretty little girl who played Miette.
I:9943;338;She has acting talent far beyond her age (which is now about 16 or 17, but at the time she couldn't have been older than 9 or 10).
I:9943;339;packed flick or anything like that.
I:9943;340;p>This is a very, very good film, but not for all types!
I:9943;341;He captures and kidnaps children to plug them on his sarcophagi in order to predate and devour their minds.
I:9943;342;The siamese sisters meet with an end that is the righteous peak of their career.
I:9943;343;The virtual adventures of the little girl are frightening and reassuring : there may be some good genius and nice wizard behind the wings of this crazy world.
I:9943;344;Besides this it played well the rest of the way through.
I:9943;345;"The French know art
I:9943;346;I enjoyed the film, it was uncanny, bizarre, and colorful.
I:9943;347;It' was a nice family movie.
I:9943;348;This is one of the best foreign movies I have seen.
I:9943;349;It is simple and has lots of really incredible scenery.
I:9943;350;If you are a B movie fan and love art you will love this film.
I:9943;351;Remember the wonder of flipping through a great illustrated book when you were a child?
I:9943;352;every character, every shot, everything about this movie is perfectly rendered and perfectly surreal.
I:9943;353;It shares the same kind of unique vision that made Wizard great.
I:9943;354;It holds up to repeated viewings because its so beautiful to look at.
I:9943;355;And you'll enjoy sharing it with others.
I:9943;356;In fact I bet you could watch it without subtitles and still enjoy it very much.
I:9943;357;Riding on the success of Amelie, the works of director Jean.
I:9943;358;the power and meaning of nocturnal images.
I:9943;359;modern farce and a brilliant piece of art.
I:9943;360;"It's not a film for ""smart people"" or movie geeks (although they like to talk about it ad nauseum)
I:9943;361;Darkness wrought, this film mixes a delightful solution of French noir with the apokoliptic feel of The Crow:City of Angels.
I:9943;362;It's humorous, interesting, and downright strange.
I:9943;363;The cinematography is amazing (as Jeunet and Caro's films usually are).
I:9943;364;it is revealed that Krank is an artificially created man with superior intelligence.
I:9943;365;It later turns out that Denree is a special child, one able to provide Krank with the ability to overcome his condition (due to the fact that Denree has no sense of fear).
I:9943;366;"One sets out to find and rescue his ""little brother"", with help of a nine.year."
I:9943;367;master plays his barrel organ and his scenes are the best in the movie.
I:9943;368;"directed by the french duo of Jeunet and Caro who also did the yummy canniable flick ""Delicatessen"" (Jeunet later did Alien Reserection and the french film ""Amelie"") The story telling is wonderful the direction is flawless and the special effects are some of the best you could ever see in the mid 90's cinima."
I:9943;369;Intriguing and curious story plot with dark settings i love every moment of it!
I:9943;370;Because a film this great has to speak for itself!
I:9943;371;This film is worth watching if you're a film buff.
I:9943;372;or a student of films interested in seeing what an imaginative director can come up with.
I:9943;373;the sets are very cool.
I:9943;374;and the story and characters are unusual to say the least.
I:9943;375;so if you fall into those categories of film viewers I'd recommend it for you.
I:9943;376;i discovered the only way I could enjoy the movie was to put on the original language track (French) and add English sub.
I:9943;377;where I understand it was very successful.
I:9943;378;It does include a commentary track by the director and Ron Perlman which is interesting.
I:9943;379;Visually stunning, and a unique story unlike anything I have ever seen.
I:9943;380;Subtitles, or dubbed are both excellent.
I:9943;381;Subtitles are difficult to appreciate the Visual look of this film, but it's worth hearing the range of original voices.
I:9943;382;This movie is one of my favorite.
I:9943;383;Great sets, great story, just a fun movie experience from this classic.
I:9943;384;Dark, steam punk mood and feel.
I:9943;385;Though canny at times, this movie is an excellent example of french cinematography in the fantasy/sci.
I:9943;386;The story has twists and turns with unforgetable characters on the curve of every loop and keeps the viewer entranced.
I:9943;387;Defintetly a fantastic movie for anyone that appreciated such films as Mirror Mask, The Labrynth (and Pan's Labrynth for that matter), and The Dark Crystal.
I:9943;388;this movie would be most enjoyable on mute.
I:9943;389;That one word will always attract me to a movie.
I:9943;390;This movie certainly attracted me.
I:9943;391;i absolutely hate the French, but I loved this movie!
I:9943;392;Very few movies nowadays encourage anything resembling thought.
I:9943;393;altogether, a jolly good movie.
I:9943;394;If The City of Lost Children was a book first, please let me know.
I:9943;395;Had Great Visuals, I Think I'll Remember It For A Long Time!
I:9943;396;"brilliant, dark and surreal French/Spanish/German Science Fiction Fantasy for adults from directors Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro who did the equally bizarre but great ""Delicatessen""."
I:9943;397;"The film plays as a cross between Oliver Twist and Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"" as the film blooms with great performances, a twisted sense of humor, atmosphere and darkness abound."
I:9943;398;"This movie became a cult classic since 1995 as it helped influenced movies like ""Dark City"" and even video games like ""BioShock"" for you can see why."
I:9943;399;The way this movie was made and story behind it makes this movie an instant classic.
I:9943;400;What an amazing movie, strongly recommend this to anyone.
I:9943;401;This is definitely a two handed movie.
I:9943;402;On the one hand, the relationship between One and Miette is beautifully wrought, the sets and art direction are fabulous, the evil Siamese twin sisters are deliciously over the top.
I:9943;403;(Judith Vittet in the role of Miette is especially noteworthy in that she plays a strong, forceful child without a touch of saccharine.
I:9943;404;And there is one sequence in which the power of a single tear in a sympathetic universe to stop evil is brilliantly played out.
I:9943;405;"the mushiness of central plot keeps this very interesting movie from being more, than ""interesting"
I:9943;406;I am not a Christian or god fearing soul but found the innocence of children and the magic of Santa totally trashed by this movie.
I:9943;407;This movie is a superbly done dark fantasy.
I:9943;408;Though dark and perhaps somewhat disturbing because of how warped the graphics can be, it presents its audience with a circus of both crazy and endearing characters.
I:9943;409;An orphan girl who is tough as nails and a circus strong.
I:9943;410;man who is soft as a marshamllow take us on a wondrous journey in search of the city of lost children.
I:9943;411;the special effects and cinematography are so unique and effectual, it's like nothing I've ever seen.
I:9943;412;i really recommend this movie, it is visually AMAZING!
I:9943;413;i really love that it's in french, as i took 2 1/2 years of french in high school.
I:9943;414;i recommend this to my friends all the time.
I:9943;415;This movie is simply something which must be experienced.
I:9943;416;The visual effects are amazing and the language is beautiful.
I:9943;417;I truly recommend getting the subtitlted version since listening to the French is a hundred times better than the English dubbing could ever be.
I:9943;418;who knew one movie could encompass so much, and do it so easily?I have to say this is my favorite movie of all time.
I:9943;419;It's perfect in every way.
I:9943;420;for me, what put it over the top, among so many other great things, was quite simply the girl.
I:9943;421;"This movie has impeccable cinematography, characters, and plot: A mad scientist preys on the dreams of children
I:9943;422;smart child theif older than her years, and One, the strongman whose heart and courage compensate his own innocence, can save them from the dream stealing mad man.
I:9943;423;A brain alive in an aquarium.
I:9943;424;My brother still swears to me it is in English.
I:9943;425;It is a movie that draws you in by its innocence that is almost not there and by it's bizarreness that seems normal.
I:9943;426;Watch it once than watch it again because you HAVE to.
I:9943;427;A fantastic cult movie along the lines of 'Freaks.'
I:9943;428;Haunting and intriguing are how I would describe this movie.
I:9943;429;Simply watching the movie is a visual feast, and probably too much to absorb in one viewing.
I:9943;430;The story is marvelously complex, and the viewer is rewarded in the end for struggling in the beginning to put all the pieces together.
I:9943;431;This is a fantastic movie, but not one for the timid.
I:9943;432;I would recommend watching it with the English dub, although it is not as good as the original French, simply to help understanding
I:9943;433;"Put aside the fact that the great Ron Perlmen is in this movie and put aside the fact the the director of Amiele nad Delecatessen directed this film
I:9943;434;But the fact that it is so incredibly dark and beautiful is another reason.
I:9943;435;Great acting from many of the children and the adults as well!
I:9943;436;THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN is a film the likes of which you will see rarely in a lifetime.
I:9943;437;ron Perlman shines in his role as the gentle circus strongman who goes by the simple name of 'One', searching for his 'little brother' who has been kidnapped.
I:9943;438;The young girl who plays Miette, whom he adopts as a 'little sister', is perfect.
I:9943;439;There are a ton of baddies in this incredible film .
I:9943;440;genius clones, and an army of mechanically.
I:9943;441;this film is a great example to Hollywood of what special effects should be .
I:9943;442;The mood that pervades the film is extremely dreamlike .
I:9943;443;the director that came to my mind as I was watching this is Terry Gilliam .
I:9943;444;THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN is a modern masterpiece .
I:9943;445;This movie has more imagination than all the big blockbusters combined.
I:9943;446;Ron Perlman was a great selection for the part.
I:9943;447;"Created by the brilliant Belgian duo
I:9943;448;it is a twisted, dark fairy tale about a genius created by an even greater genius.
I:9943;449;The genius creator, however, manages to jinx each of his creations (rather, a wicked genetic fairy casts a spell on the creations) and Krank.
I:9943;450;This is one of my ultimate favourite movies.
I:9943;451;The visual effects are simply stunning and the expressions and faces of the characters are incredible (Daniel Emilfork makes Rowan Atchison look like a slacker)!
I:9943;452;pierre Jeunet's eerie cinematic genius.
I:9943;453;A pact is formed, and the strongman and the children (particularly a girl named Miette.
I:9943;454;played by the superb Judith Vitet) delve into the dream.
I:9943;455;The costumes, characters and strange sets are wonderful.
I:9943;456;It's very rich, visually, so if you are an artist you will probably appreciate it.
I:9943;457;The characters are also interesting and so is the story.
I:9943;458;This is a favorite in my house.
I:9943;459;it has an excellent feel similar to that of Coraline:Something dark and twisted but with a pleasant side that warms your heart.
I:9943;460;A balance of character strength, warmth and sensitivity.
I:9943;461;Beautiful tale exemplifying the simplicity of friendship, and how strong it can be.
I:9943;462;"Ron Perlman does an astounding job playing ""One,"" a simple."
I:9943;463;the acting is fantastic and the music score is exceptional.
I:9943;464;Marianne Faithful is an extraordinary vocalist, providing voice for the haunting lyrics to the song's end credits.
I:9943;465;and remember that not having everything still allows us to enjoy what we DO have.
I:9943;466;This is as good a description as I can think to fit the overall look and feel of this movie by Jeunet and Caro.
I:9943;467;It has brilliant cinematography: it's a movie that takes place in a very dark setting, which is essential for the dark purposes of the plot.
I:9943;468;The scenography was definitely one of the most amazing things of the movie, with a city by the water, where night never seems to go away.
I:9943;469;Most people call the movie brilliant.
I:9943;470;in a lush, dark, gorgeous world .
I:9943;471;it's a cult classic and I enjoyed listening to the directors commentary for the first time.
I:9943;472;The movie is very visual, with many wonderful things to look at, and something always happening, but I didn't completely understand the movie.
I:9943;473;ron Perlman, of Beauty and the Beast fame, plays One, a circus strongman who is looking for his brother, one of the little children who was kidnapped.
I:9943;474;I can't say this is really a great movie, but it did hold my attention, mainly because of the visual splendor of the whole thing.
I:9943;475;I, at least, kind of enjoyed that moment.
I:9943;476;I'm glad that I did watch it b/c the characters are very interesting.
I:9943;477;"Known better for his highly successful 2001 film ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Am lie Poulain"" (known simply as ""Am lie"" in the U. s.) and his 1997 film ""Alien: Resurrection"" (Part 4 of the ""Alien"" series), Jean."
I:9943;478;The City of Lost Children earned no Oscar nominations, but did receive several nominations for the French C sar Awards, including Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Music Written for a Film.
I:9943;479;The film did win the C sar Award for Best Production Design.
I:9943;480;pierre Jeunet and co. director Marc Caro also received a nomination for the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival.
I:9943;481;memorable scenes in the film include the children dreaming of multiple Santa Clauses, the Cyclops henchmen at work, the Cyclops cult gathering, Miette and One over the water, the discussions with Uncle Irvin, and Miette's dream.
I:9943;482;The dark and mysterious set designs and cinematography are superb and elegantly demonstrate the clarity and depth of color that Jean.
I:9943;483;If you enjoy surrealistic and avant.
I:9943;484;pierre Jeunet's work, you will more than likely enjoy the film very much.
I:9943;485;This film has a visual strength that put its in league with The Wizard of Oz and Cocteau's Beauty and The Beast.
I:9943;486;will hold you, will make you laugh, will make you cry.
I:9943;487;And a great cast too.
I:9943;488;don't detract from this wonderful, flightful fantasy.
I:9943;489;If you liked The Crow, or Dark City, then you will enjoy the atmosphere of this film.
I:9943;490;The special effects were simply amazing and the music was well tuned to the style of the movie.
I:9943;491;Watch it, and realize how much other movies stink.
I:9943;492;I can always support a movie that embraces its own dichotomies and hypocrisies so readily.
I:9943;493;pierre Jeunet's world, as many have said before me, is very much akin to Terry Gilliam's cinematic dream worlds.
I:9943;494;They both have a fine sense of the underground rising, revolution in the sewers, and hope where no hope could ever grow.
I:9943;495;But where Gilliam can sometimes be cold and detached in his futuristic depictions, Jeunet gives his worlds a European sense of poeticism and beauty.
I:9943;496;The City of Lost Children is built on a solid foundation of just those two elements.
I:9943;497;He has an obsession with complex chrome gadgetry, and novel inventions.
I:9943;498;It's overcomplicated, which enhances the aesthetic beauty of the thing, and makes it frighteningly poetic.
I:9943;499;His camera studies their faces, as if they were beautiful.
I:9943;500;In the end, they become beautiful.
I:9943;501;I suppose this is one of the reasons why the film has an abundance of cyclops imagery (a master scientist with a HAL.9000.
I:9943;502;see how Jeunet treats Ron Perlman, a gorilla of a man with a pronounced jaw and sloped forehead.
I:9943;503;But bathed in Jeunet's camera, and armed with the character's innocence, he becomes something else entirely.
I:9943;504;Much of the credit should be given to cinematographer Darius Khondji, who got his start with Jeunet and did enough excellent work after that to allow me to say he is my favourite lens man working today.
I:9943;505;Enjoy the lively visuals that Jeunet has given you in the meantime, and you'll get to the end nicely.
I:9943;506;The most amazing artwork ever put to celluloid?
I:9943;507;and the effects are fittingly perfect.
I:9943;508;a person could want no more It is a film that will pull you in to it's weirdness and hold you like a dream.
I:9943;509;You will feel that you have to watch it again just for the effect it has on you.
I:9943;510;a tear saves MIETTEGREAT FILM.
I:9943;511;The entire cast in this film is fantastic, but then, this director often uses the same great actors.
I:9943;512;Even the children were great.
I:9943;513;Ron Perlman is young and very emotive, and the film allows for a blooming human relationship that focuses more of innocent family love than romance (considering the great age difference.)
I:9943;514;Even during serious scenes, the viewer may pleasantly enjoy him/herself.
I:9943;515;"the gadgets are truly intricate
I:9943;516;i highly recommend this film to just about everyone.
I:9943;517;The subtitles are easy to read, in case that's a concern of yours.
I:9943;518;I almost pulled the plug on this critically acclaimed French fantasy from 1995.
I:9943;519;The girl is beautiful and a wonderful actress and her presence overcomes the silliness of the story.
I:9943;520;I can't get all gooey about this movie but the visuals and this young French actress are worth watching.
I:9943;521;I really liked most of the visuals and quirky style.
I:9943;522;as far as being stylized, it was very interesting.
I:9943;523;it's visually far superior to the Matrix but at the same level storywise.
I:9943;524;This movie is gothic eye candy, dreamy, the stylized world created is worth viewing alone.
I:9943;525;The characters, themes, moods and ambience are all quite pretty.
I:9943;526;At any rate, lots to think about here and to admire with your peepers.
I:9943;527;Lose yourself in a mesmerizing world and don't dissect, I already did it for you.
I:9943;528;take generous helpings of Oliver Twist and Dune and mix well.
I:9943;529;if you enjoy the work of Lynch, Gilliam etc, and indeed other Jeunet and Caro offerings, this wonderful film will also be for you.
I:9943;530;(After a second viewing I was in love!)
I:9943;531;You feel much better about the film when the pieces start to fit together, and then you can really get into all the positive, optimistic aspects of the story.
I:9943;532;"The tender, heart warming friendship between the streetwise young orphan ""Miette"" and the gentle giant ""One"" is just delightful."
I:9943;533;"All the characters are unusual and interesting, but the evil ""Krank"" is wickedly entertaining."
I:9943;534;angelo Badalamenti's score is hauntingly beautiful, and perfectly suited to this film.
I:9943;535;The two most enjoyable and impressive features are the commentary, and the language selection, which has the options of French, English and Spanish soundtracks and subtitles.
I:9943;536;If you do not speak French I strongly recommend that you switch on the subtitles.
I:9943;537;Really weel done with more surealism than I've ever been able to sit through!
I:9943;538;A young boy is kidnapped so that a monstrous villain can extract his pleasant dreams, dreams that he himslef can longer have.
I:9943;539;It has a capturing colorful gothic feel to it and cast of characters provide a backdrop every bit as effective as the wonderful stage sets that take place in an underwater laboratory, a seedy harbor side slum area and a number of other memorable locations.
I:9943;540;the movie is visually stunning!!
I:9943;541;thats it take it or leave it!
I:9943;542;granted, the film is visually opulent, with it's shimmering vistas and expansive dystopia's, but if this is the yardstick against which films should be judged, then Tarsem Singh (The Cell) would be an uber.
I:9943;543;director by now (with his eye.
I:9943;544;This movie has one of the best atmosphears ever, scenary, Color's, Images, Caracters and city's created in this film are a dream.
I:9943;545;This is a great film.
I:9943;546;Jeunet (and Caro) have made some of the most extraordinarily graphically beautiful films of the last 20 years.
I:9943;547;"Amelie virtually defines ""charming"" and is easily worth 5 stars (maybe 6)."
I:9943;548;that's quite a body of work!
I:9943;549;but I'm still working on it.
I:9943;550;So few movies these days really capture my mind.
I:9943;551;This is one of those movies from start to finish hands down one of the best.
I:9943;552;City of Lost Children is not for everyone but it's smart creative storytelling is all there.
I:9943;553;Dark humor and twisted effects set the tone for this film.
I:9943;554;if your a fan of a sweet films and dark humor than give this movie a try
I:9943;555;returned it and got my money, but very good seller
I:9943;556;It's not clear whether little brother is a real little brother or has been adopted by the strongman, but he loves him and takes care of him just the same.
I:9943;557;It has action and adventure, some fantasy elements, some comedy, and at times can be a little gruesome.
I:9943;558;But aside from that, the movie is 99 percent clean, and that's fine in itself.
I:9943;559;But the plot is good and the visuals and colors are eye candy, so if you like such movies as Oliver, Brazil, Baron Munchausen, and James and the Giant Peach, you will find some similar details that are enjoyable.
I:9943;560;this is one of my favorite films of all time.
I:9943;561;it has a fascinating, intricate and detailed story, and a huge cast of characters and ideas.
I:9943;562;children from the city are disappearing, and the answer to these mysteries is so exquisitely, uniquely and poignantly rendered that i observed people emerging from the theatre with tears in their eyes.
I:9943;563;pay very close attention as you watch.
I:9943;564;in the theatre, the translation may not have been perfect, but it serves the film well enough.
I:9943;565;the english voice performances are inferior, and some aspects of the dialogue are clouded.
I:9943;566;if you ever have the opportunity to see this incredibly unique and beautiful film in a theatre, i highly recommend it.
I:9943;567;As visually interesting as the story was, i don't believe there are any interesting nor sympathetic characters.
I:9943;568;Sure, the sets are both blaring and mysterious, simultaneously evoking a mid.
I:9943;569;The problem is that the story around the interesting visuals is.
I:9943;570;Each time I see it, I like it more and more.
I:9943;571;The best way to describe the movie is surreal.
I:9943;572;It seems a bit odd, but that's why the movie is so great.
I:9943;573;I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that is imaginative and open minded.
I:9943;574;"The setting is a very ""steam punk"" sort of world where technology is based on something right out of the turn of the 19th century era."
I:9943;575;The storyline centers on something easy to relate to.
I:9943;576;It's anything but common and certainly something that you will find memorable for years to come.
I:9943;577;This has got to be one of Ron Perlman's earliest works and quite possibly his most unique.
I:9943;578;Directors Juenet Marc ( Delicatessen ) once again create a fascinating and unusual world all their own, carrying the torch as the Fellinis of our generation.
I:9943;579;The imagery is truly fabulous.
I:9943;580;I must say, though, that Jeunet was absolutely incompatible with the Alien series, and never should have been involved with the fourth film.
I:9943;581;I had the great honor of seeing this film a few years ago when it was on it's first run in American theaters.
I:9943;582;I was captivated by the very surreal and dark look of the sets as well as the plot.
I:9943;583;this movie stuns you visually and warms your heart, all at the same time.
I:9943;584;visually, the movie perfectly combined aspects of both future and past.
I:9943;585;everyone who i've shown this movie to instantly comments on it's beauty.
I:9943;586;but there's also a very touching story behind the aesthetics.
I:9943;587;a gentle giant of a man goes in search of his kid.
I:9943;588;the leader of this group, a very pretty and charming girl named miette, grows attached to this strong.
I:9943;589;man and very sweet brother.
I:9943;590;I prefer the French version.
I:9943;591;I loved the setting, filming, special effects.
I:9943;592;It ranks very high in my list of really great weird movies.
I:9943;593;The City of Lost Children is absuloutely the greatest film ever made.
I:9943;594;Together, the strong man (One) and Miette.
I:9943;595;So now they kidnap children and steal their dreams.
I:9943;596;All of the adventure is jammed pack into one movie.
I:9943;597;The Directors and great and also directed a similar film, Delicatessan.
I:9943;598;pierre Jeunet is an astounding talent, one of Belgium's true living treasures.
I:9943;599;Along with his longtime collaborator Marc Caro, he's created two of the finest films of the nineties, Delicatessen and City of Lost Children.
I:9943;600;It's a subtle difference, but an important one.
I:9943;601;the story is complex and surreal, and certainly too twisted to relate here.
I:9943;602;The basic plot is that an old scientist (Daniel Emilfork, likely best remembered by American audiences from Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?)
I:9943;603;One, along with Denree's best friend Mariette (the charming, sassy Judith Vittet) sets off on a quest to discover the location of the scientist's secret hideout.
I:9943;604;There is much more to it than this, of course.
I:9943;605;The humor to be found herein is always close to that hysterical edge, and often plunges well over the line.
I:9943;606;loving heart on its sleeve in many, many ways).
I:9943;607;world War II: an analog tale of orphans, kidnapped children and captured dreams.
I:9943;608;for their dreams the very young children have their brain.
I:9943;609;sailor circus strong man saves the day while rescuing his brotherwith the help of a very resourceful orphan girl.
I:9943;610;it is a wonderful movie that most people wouldn't take their children to?
I:9943;611;This film is truly a hidden gem and a rare find.
I:9943;612;If you enjoy artful foreign films.
I:9943;613;also if you enjoy post apocalyptic films like the classic dark city, you may enjoy this as well.
I:9943;614;its just one of those movies that will entertain your brain.
I:9943;615;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
I:9943;616;This is an awesome movie.
I:9943;617;The background music is also great.
I:9943;618;I highly recommend this movie for adults.
I:9943;619;I believe it would scare small children and perhaps children up to the age of 12.
I:9943;620;I felt like I was alone in enjoying this movie.
I:9943;621;"And yet, they thought ""The Matrix"" was so wonderful for the visuals."
I:9943;622;The trailer sold itself well as a wordless collage of cool visuals, and a haunting instrumental passage.
I:9943;623;Perhaps, that's probably an important point about watching this movie.
I:9943;624;A beautiful set and costumes give this film its dark and haunting appeal.
I:9943;625;It is all very fantastic.
I:9943;626;It personally reminds me of Tim Burton's film and set design.
I:9943;627;It truly is a visual haunt.
I:9943;628;this movie is worth checking out.
I:9943;629;It is a visual masterpiece and although the script isn't to fantastic it is quite a good movie.
I:9943;630;It is almost a modern day fairy/horror tale.
I:9943;631;This film is one that you have to watch.
I:9943;632;this is the story of Krank, his 'brothers', and dreams.
I:9943;633;Ron Perlman plays a seminal role and well.
I:9943;634;Krank is an evil, created being who uses the Cyclops to kidnap children for him so that he can steal their dreams.
I:9943;635;He manages to enlist the help of Miette, one of the older girls in the gang.
I:9943;636;'City' is a complex and sometimes confusing film, but is so richly done and bizarrely plotted that it is entertainment at its surreal finest.
I:9943;637;First of all, this is a French film, and the dialogue is French.
I:9943;638;City Of Lost Children has the feel of a play, using expert sets and backdrops, and winds out being a visually stunning treat with good, old fashioned sets rather than a lot of CGI.
I:9943;639;All of these features combined mark a distinctive feel of bizarreness throughout the entire film.
I:9943;640;also to note, there are a couple of amazing sequences in the film, one in which we follow the events caused by a single teardrop, and another where we follow the journey of a flea.
I:9943;641;If this is you, then you will love this film as much as I did.
I:9943;642;I enjoyed this movie a great deal.
I:9943;643;if you like movies in the vein of Tim Burton films, or Pan's Labrynth, I belive you'll enjoy this one.
I:9943;644;well, then it gets strange from there.
I:9943;645;"But a beautifully filmed movie from the same guys that brought you ""Delicatessen"" and stars one of my favorite character actors, Dominique Pinon, in many rolls."
I:9943;646;You are promised many visual delights, a fantasy that will take your breath away, many amazing and memorable characters, even those appearing for only moments.
I:9943;647;if you want to see a modern tale this is the right movie.
I:9943;648;It was worth the wait!
I:9943;649;This is a delicious piece of surreal steampunk, tying together elements of fairy tale and mythology.
I:9943;650;some reviewers focus on the scenery of this movie, which is admittedly top.
I:9943;651;A lot of attention is paid to bare feet.
I:9943;652;the City of Lost Children has obviously become an influential movie.
I:9943;653;All with the likes of one side.
I:9943;654;man, Mr. One played excellently by Beauty and The Beast's Ron Perlman, evil, pilfering, child corruptors and Fagin.
I:9943;655;mix these colorful characters in with a band of homeless, criminal children a la Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist style, pet fleas that inject drugs, a talking brain in a tank named Uncle Irvin, a midget named Mademoiselle Bismuth and her six cloned sons, and finally a group of blind people called Cyclops who eat children and you have a marvelous mixture of fantasy, horror, sci.
I:9943;656;the visual effects are stunning and the costumes by Jean Paul Gauthier are breathtaking.
I:9943;657;The young, Judith Vittet turns in an especially wonderful performance as Ron Perlman's sidekick and heroine of the story, Miette!
I:9943;658;i highly recommend this film!
I:9943;659;Quirky in all the right ways and characters who are charmingly novel, not run of the mill.
I:9943;660;The fact that I have seen it easily over 100 times now shows how fresh something can be putting together all the parts that make a great movie.
I:9943;661;"ron Perlman, as ""One"", plays a great fish."
I:9943;662;wise, and still manages to draw sympathy from the watcher.
I:9943;663;"Judith Vittet, ""Miette"" in the film, does a wonderful job showing how a person can develop, given the right set of circumstances."
I:9943;664;"And Daniel Emilfork, as the evil ""Krank"", still shows patience and respect under that vicious surface."
I:9943;665;The rest of the characters, from The Professeur to Marthe, from the evil sisters to the little brother, all come through well throughout the film, enhancing the movie by showing character depth.
I:9943;666;But somehow it works in this film, and works well.
I:9943;667;"As ""One"" meets ""Miette"" and together they take the weird twists and turns through their journey, you can't help but cheer them on."
I:9943;668;"Even on the ""evil"" side, some characters rise above it, showing wisdom, humour, and regret."
I:9943;669;"this film is much enjoyed by me, and I highly recommend it to everyone (as long as you can tolerate subtitles
I:9943;670;Disturbing, surreal, superb visual effects, unique storyline are all the reasons I highly recommend this truly cool movie.
I:9943;671;If you appreciate this movie, I would highly recommend Delicatessen as well.
I:9943;672;Both are guaranteed to let you see into the darkest corners of humanity.
I:9943;673;The City of Lost Children gets two platinum stars and also moves up to one of my top ten favorite films of all time.
I:9943;674;This is the style that due to a connection of unrelated events something extraordinary happens.
I:9943;675;Let me give you an example from this film: There is a scene where the girl and One (Ron Pearlman.
I:9943;676;imagine this times ten, and you have this film.
I:9943;677;keep in mind this is a French film with English subtitles, so you are not only getting the true voice of the film, but seeing the darkness of the cinematography without any American input.
I:9943;678;This really shows the purpose behind making this film, it really takes you to a new place so dark and dreamlike that you the viewer actually feel like you are in the picture itself.
I:9943;679;He grows insane and has developed a technique to view and capture children's dreams so he can thereby inject them into his own mind.
I:9943;680;Krank himself is a clone.
I:9943;681;One day strong man, One (Ron Perlman), and his little brother are ambushed by Krank's men and One's little brother is kidnapped.
I:9943;682;It's all good fun this film and while the story is simplistic it's a kind of delightfully Grimm fairytale sort of story that keeps your interest.
I:9943;683;Ron Perlman is one of those cult actors who everyone seems to like and he has hit it big with the recent success Hellboy.
I:9943;684;He is a strong presence and unlike many musclemen of his stature he can act, something which has held him back somewhat,is because people have never really cast him as a leading action man, although in truth he's not blessed with good looks.
I:9943;685;The interestingly named Rufus, a Juenet stalwart is also very good with the clones, while Daniel Emilfork is excellent as Crank.
I:9943;686;Also good and a charming innocence is Judith Vittet as Miette.
I:9943;687;anyone who loves a visually stunning movie should watch this film it looks amazing.
I:9943;688;It is typically French in it's verve.
I:9943;689;This is a fantasy fans wet dream, believe me!
I:9943;690;Both of them in a good way, for the most part.
I:9943;691;Oddly enough that picture tells you a lot about this movie.
I:9943;692;It is also so well planned out that it appears well aligned and perpendicular.
I:9943;693;In other words it is perfect chaos and everything you see has a special place.
I:9943;694;It is also heralded as a steam punk masterpiece in certain circles.
I:9943;695;A sailor named One (Ron Pearlman) does his best to save the day.
I:9943;696;The City of Lost Children is a full on cultist extravaganza.
I:9943;697;This film is straight up health food for the imagination:Indulge.
I:9943;698;That of course is pretty much for you to decide.
I:9943;699;That is one of the many charms found in The City of Lost Children.
I:9943;700;Krank, a sinister madman is stealing children to take their dreams, and One, child.
I:9943;701;visually, City of Lost Children is a masterpiece.
I:9943;702;Its performances are universally superb, making singling out any particular one superfluous.
I:9943;703;Its score, composed by Angelo Badalamenti, is eerie, haunting, beautiful.
I:9943;704;"as the credits finally role to a close, the viewer feels that he has just awakened from an incredible, bizarre, frightening but amazing dream, with one difference
I:9943;705;In fact, I prefer them.
I:9943;706;What good are visually imaginative scenes if the story and plot are a jumbled mess?It seems breathless fans of this film have gotten too caught up in the stunning sets.
I:9943;707;And yes, they are indeed provocative.
I:9943;708;If you want to save some money and still get a similar experience to watching this film, eat a rich meal before going to bed.
I:9943;709;"This is no flashy introduction meant to grab the attention of the viewer
I:9943;710;CoLC is a film noir which takes place in a fictional Victorian era port city in France.
I:9943;711;While this film is a bit confusing, and certainly bizarre, the viewer will find himself emerged in a richly detailed fantasy with endearing characters and a thought provoking story line.
I:9943;712;The complexity of the film in fact makes repeated viewings more rewarding.
I:9943;713;Also to the film's credit are its many endearing and original characters.
I:9943;714;genius who kidnaps children and uses an anachronistic device to monitor and enter into the children's dreams.
I:9943;715;He finds some unexpected help from Miette, a young, street.
I:9943;716;smart girl from a local orphanage.
I:9943;717;CoLC is a rare experience in lieu of the by.
I:9943;718;book filmmaking that makes up the film industry today.
I:9943;719;This is certainly how I felt when I first experienced it.
I:9943;720;The cinematography is undoubtedly breathtaking.
I:9943;721;A gritty urban setting is the stage for most of the film's events.
I:9943;722;Other aesthetic locations are the inside of the Scientist's laboratory and the cloud covered night Sea that our heroes must traverse in a rowboat to reach it.
I:9943;723;The CG special effects are also nice to look at and are used sparingly and in unconventional and inventive ways.
I:9943;724;the movie has a bit of a controversial aspect in the fact that ultimately the movie is about the love that develops between the two mismatched characters, the little girl and the strongman.
I:9943;725;the genius and his underlings who need the children, the Cyclops who are kidnapping them for him, and the orphanage that forces children to steal for them.
I:9943;726;the film is filled with the fascinating, yet fictional, Victorian inventions that are ubiquitous in Steampunk: clockwork, steam, and analog devices.
I:9943;727;the music is a beautiful and original classical suite of music composed by Angelo Badalamenti.
I:9943;728;The score perfectly fits the dark and rarely cheerful world of the film.
I:9943;729;Jeunet has since moved on to direct the international hit Amelie.
I:9943;730;The two started work together on short films, cartoons, and advertisements after meeting at a film festival in 1974.
I:9943;731;They perhaps worked well together due to a shared dark outlook that is signature to their films.
I:9943;732;After the relative success of Delicatessen, the two were able to make CoLC, the masterpiece that they had wanted to make for some time.
I:9943;733;Also included is a commentary by Jeunet and Ron Perlman, trailer, and some concept art.
I:9943;734;Quite easily one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:9943;735;Every time I see it I feel like a kid again.
I:9943;736;Maybe when it came out it was more interesting.
I:9943;737;This movie is a fairytail about a little girl and a strong man trying to find a little boy.
I:9943;738;Many of the actors from Amelie are in this movie as well.
I:9943;739;If you haven't seen AMELIE you have to, it is incredible.
I:9943;740;Will special effects and a unique style, this movie is one of my favorates.
I:9943;741;Every single aspect of this film is just amazing.
I:9943;742;I'm certainly not one to care at all about set design and costumes, but this film has such fascinating, mysterious and gorgeous production values that one can't help but fall in love with the movie, if for no other reason than physical attraction.
I:9943;743;that aside, this esoteric and enigmatic film provides a wealth of adorable and sympathetic characters, namely One and Miette.
I:9943;744;Somewhat remniscent of Luc Besson's Leon, in the respect of the fatherly/sexual attraction between the two lead characters, the film manages to take that ancient story and do something indescribable to it.
I:9943;745;Somehow there is an unidentifiable heart in the film.
I:9943;746;The power of the themes of innocence and protection and envy and love (in every sense of the word) is so intense and personable that one can not resist falling completely in love with the film and the characters of One and Miette.
I:9943;747;as long as one can see past the eccentric style and mood of the film, he will find a truly heartwarming story that is propelled by truly problematic and frightening events, as opposed to the extremely American concept of cramming trite and inconsequential twists into love stories.
I:9943;748;From the duo that made the visually innovative and exhilarating Delicatessen, the City of Lost Children exhibits the same ability to translate dreams to the screen, share a poetic and original vision, as shown since in Alien Resurrection and Amelie.
I:9943;749;it really would be very unsettling to some children, albeit wonderfully rewarding for adults.
I:9943;750;Dark, unsettling, twisted, to the point of almost defying the ability of description, yet also touchingly beautiful in it's portrayal of the spiritual nature and devotion of unrelated people who become family.
I:9943;751;It's fine lines and Ron Perlman does a great job walking those subtleties and capturing innocence.
I:9943;752;the nine year old female lead, Miette (Judith Vittet), an orphan thief who helps One, has the look of youthful, lovely adulthood and the attitude of a child who has had no childhood.
I:9943;753;A great, character defining moment is when she is being carried on One's back and tries on an earring and checks herself out in a mirror.
I:9943;754;"A telling juxtaposition of ""father/daughter"" and ""blossoming woman"" imagery."
I:9943;755;perlman and Vittet have lovely screen chemistry.
I:9943;756;The spiritual connection that develops between their characters is the beating heart of this film.
I:9943;757;"(asked of a woman with a metal arrow through her body) ""Yes."
I:9943;758;A quirky fantasy movie with fair casting and excellent, though dark, visuals.
I:9943;759;You must experience great Junet Caro's world.
I:9943;760;The movie is presented in such a way that you feel as though you are watching a dream.
I:9943;761;The movie is engrossing to say the least and the actors are well bred.
I:9943;762;The story is pure fantasy and fun.
I:9943;763;The dreamlike atmosphere and story is very interesting and entertaining.
I:9943;764;But its mostly tongue in cheek and you can see that they figured it as something good, not just a patch job.
I:9943;765;But o well it's still spiffy.
I:9943;766;By far, one of my favorite films.
I:9943;767;This is a very interesting film.
I:9943;768;"It has the dark and ominesence type of story, and environment, of Dark City
I:9943;769;A movie to be recommended to anyone above 8 years old (although it may be a bit frieghtening to some children), this is a well balanced story that captures your attention with a tale of morality, life, and love.
I:9943;770;An important note is also that I have only viewed the French audio version with subtitles, so I cannot comment on the dubbed audio.
I:9943;771;Just an incredible film, the special effect stands up to time and the storyline and strange characters and to the surreal feel of the movie.

I:9943;775;Amelie is a much lighter feeling movie overall, so there are bound to be a few people who loved Amelie, but do not like City of Lost Children and perhaps vice versa.
I:9943;776;(And you will notice some of the same actors in both movies as well.)

I:9943;782;It is simply one of the strangest dream.
I:9943;783;This film is also a defining moment in the Steam Punk Genre.
I:9943;784;There are some scenes that are quite interesting from an artistic point of view.
I:9943;785;when you have a strong man, a flosting head in a jar, a clever girl and burping little boy you have a pretty good story, but throw in some villains who are kid.
I:9943;786;napping, tubes and engines farting, and oozing you get magic!
I:9943;787;The soundtrack is outstanding, one of the best I have ever heard.
