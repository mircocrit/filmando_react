1;i think id4 is a great forth of july movie towach with the family
2;I'm just kidding there but this movie is a great piece of movie history.
3;This is a great summer movie and one that you can bring to a friend's house and enjoy, you could probably bring it to a formal dinner party and become the biggest hit at the party!
4;Trust me, I have liked this movie since I first saw it on TV and not I own 4 copies!
5;That is how good this movie is!
6;But there's A LOT more to it than that.
7;This is definately one of the top sci.
8;fi movies I love watching again and again.
9;Not only does the alien spaceship look real, but the aliens themselves look great, too!
10;fi fans out there, this is a must for you!!!
11;"OK, ""it's just a movie""."
12;Star Wars for the next generation I spot a reviewer claim?!
13;STARSHIP TROOPERS is both a brilliant satire AND highly entertaining, well crafted sci.
14;Stuff that works: I like seeing the White House explode and other stuff.
15;The alien ships look pretty cool.
16;Graphics are corny, some of the lines are corny, but it's a fun movie to watch with some friends and some fireworks.
17;I remember when the previews came out, it looked like an amazing movie.
18;I give it 2 stars for some of the special effects.
19;The picture and audio are excellent.
20;I saw this piece of work in the theaters, and at the time I thought it was okay.
21;Seeing it for the second time here made me reconsider.
22;Science fiction is Star Wars, 2001, and Starship Troopers.
23;The special effects are incredible, the sound is extremely good, the alien ships do look, alien.
24;Pancake characters round out this film that was so successful the first time they are selling it again so that the company can get more cash to make more movies like this.
25;The story is a little weak in some places but it is a solid one.
26;just laugh at the actors hamming it up next to some pretty decent FX.
27;Overly flag waving, IMHO, but still fun.
28;I actually saw Independence Day on its opening day in the theater on July 2nd, 1996 (it opened a day ahead of schedule), and it was a total blast.
29;Independence Day definitely kept with the tradition of top.
30;notch summer Hollywood blockbusters, which started in 1993 with Jurassic Park, and ended in 1997 with Men in Black.
31;"For those out there who like to politicize Independence Day: Notice how he did *not* say ""Welcome to the U. s.""After having seen Independence Day once in the theater and countless other times on video, I will admit that this is one of those movies where you obviously have to suspend belief, but it is one hell of a ride if you just let the movie immerse you."
32;The special effects are still better than what you see in movies nowadays, plus the cast is excellent (Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman!)
33;This is my favorite movie.
34;Independence Day is a really good movie.
35;It shows the strength of the human spirt.
36;The human's in this movie were able to win against all odds.
37;There is a lot of action in this movie and some funny moments as well.
38;If you like Science Fiction and Will Smith then this is a movie for you.
39;Independence Day is entertaining if not taken seriously.
40;I watch and read science fiction for the fun of it.
41;While I am trained in the sciences myself, I enjoy the occasional side trip to escapist worlds and stories.
42;Well, Earth takes a beating before things come together for the underdog earthlings, but it all turns out for the best in the end.
43;On the other hand, this film is amazing!
44;There is tactile suspense, good character development, a great assemblage of talented actors (though Dr. Okin at Area 51 is not all that believable), and great visual candy.
45;The special effects make this movie a great one to see.
46;Smith, Pullman, Goldblum and friends put on a great show.5 stars for the fun of it.
47;Totally satisfied by the product.
48;This is a well acted classic, with the special effects enhanced with the blue ray edition.
49;This is one of the dumbest movies I ever seen.
50;Independence Day Offers Fireworks and ThrillsOne of the best science fiction films made in recent years, Roland Emmerich's Independence Day highlights a clever script, an A. list cast (which includes Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Margaret Colin, and Robert Loggia, just to name a few of the actors) and eye.
51;"The plot is essentially the same as most ""alien invasion"" movies of those Red."
52;"future ""retro"" feel that is the heart of Independence Day's appeal."
53;"It takes all these clich s and makes them work in such a way that audiences familiar with ""invaders from space"" can recognize the tongue."
54;cheek tone of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's screenplay and smile, and there are lots of visual and dialogue tips of the hats to films such as Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and other science fiction series.
55;Still, the strongest influence is War of the Worlds, not only thematically but structurally as well.
56;style light show with a violent show of force.
57;20th Century Fox Home Entertainment also released a pricier 2.
58;I could watch this movie over and over again, It is one of our favorite Alien Movies.
59;It's a good movie with a good cast and I fail to see how more words would improve anything.
60;This is a fun, fun popcorn movie, the likes of which we haven't seen in a few years.
61;We get three making of specials, one of which is cool .
62;It is a FANTASTIC homage to Hollywood movie.
63;making of the 1940s in that it worked the angle of strong characters who band together to over come odds, etc. and with a focus on the love relationships between the main characters.
64;A tale for the ages.
65;The documentaries are standard promotional stuff (although the 'mockumentary' is quite a cute idea), the trailers are actually interesting, and the commentary tracks are.
66;well, make up your own mind.
67;One of the iconic great movies of all time!
68;Best movie line: I got to get me one of these.
69;I will say that the image was sharp on the large.
70;I own this movie and I think it is one of the better movies I have seen in a long time.
71;Good guys win/bad guys lose, lots of patriotism and great special effects.
72;Great Movie for the 4th of July.
73;Watch it all the time.
74;I like this movie and Will Smith is a good sing and actor.
75;This is a great show and has become a Fourth of July tradition with our family.
76;Best part is at the very end when the aliens are vanquished and everyone is cheering the heros.
77;The world waited for the Americans to lead .
78;The American spirit, our courage, our innovative ways and our indomitable thirst for liberty, won the day.
79;Made me proud to be an American.
80;fi movie it always was.
81;Still worth watching if you liked it the first time around.
82;The screenplay is literally unrecognizable to those who have read the novel .
83;The move is much the same as it ever was.
84;Weak story but good special efects.
85;Its just a fun move that just about anyone can enjoy.
86;fi buff's this is really a good movie.
87;The thought put into the making and the actor's make this a believable event that could happen.
88;It show's how the entire world put's all their differences behind them and band together to bring these alien invaders down.
89;will Smith's acting is GREAT as always as only Will Smith can do.
90;This is one of the best sci.
91;Will Smith, Bill Pullman, and Jeff Goldblum are great together.
92;There are three or four scenes in here that are my favorite.
93;The Good Things*Excellent action and special effects.
94;*Good film style and good production design.
95;*Storyline is engaging, filled with lots of drama and comedy.
96;*Very accurate to White House politics and military strategem.
97;this is one of the most entertaining blockbusters ever made.
98;It has loads of excitement, action, and special effects.
99;And it even has room for comedy, drama, and interesting ideas.
100;It's not a particuarly deep movie, but it's a lot of fun.
101;I love this movie,one of my favorites.
102;The speech the President gives to he fighter pilots before they get in their planes is one of the best movie speeches ever.
103;With a larger screen at home it would of been just as good.
104;The behind the sceens really take you into the making of the movie.
105;It reveals everything about the special effects!
106;This is a movie that is fun and funny the first time you see it.
107;Fun to watch brain candy even after all the years since it first came out.
108;Looks great while steaming on my amazing Kindle Fire.
109;The special effects really hold up, even today.
110;You will see a message stating, Please Check Disc.
111;I'm one of Amazon's biggest fans.
112;and I usually love their pricing too.
113;Love the movie but hate the price.
114;The Sci Fiy movie that showed us the alien experiments of Area 51 and the attempted take over of our planet is now here for you in a classic Retro format the Laserdisc.
115;With extended play hosting 55 min of video per side this Laserdisc will keep you entertained and on edge.
116;Overall it is a great movie on a great medium.
117;Good special effects, yes, but that only goes so far.
118;fi movies of the past, but they played it so straight.
119;Mars Attacks is a way better movie to me because they went all the way with the camp humor and sci.
120;fi references and it came out as it should be: a lot of fun.
121;Since it first came out, it's earned its place at the top of my most.
122;The special effects were unquestionably spectacular.
123;And mind you, that takes a lot of imagination.
124;"I just want to have fun."""
125;written, rousing salute to the Fourth of July.
126;"some noise"" exhortations, baseballs that race across the Jumbotron as fans cheer their ""favorite"" and the animated clapping hands prevalent at most major league ballparks."
127;Lots of pyrotechnical special effects?
128;But I happened to enjoy this flick immensely, and I consider myself someone with an IQ far above plant life.
129;While I know there are better scripted films out there in this genre, I couldn?t help but enjoy this movie despite its predictable plot on the premise that it was intended to make one feel good about ones fellow human beings, and it did.
130;While it certainly isn't cerebral by any stretch of the imagination, it is a good family film.
131;As other reviewers point out, there is a little for everyone in this film: a brave, decent, pilot.
132;"president
133;This is a film that attempts to fulfill the need for fantasy in all of us.
134;Like The War of the Worlds it's an """"us against them"""" sort of film, but unlike the latter, it has it's funny moments, in fact many of them."""
135;everybody's favorite synthetic life form.
136;gives a wonderful performance as a slightly off beat and out of step director of Area 51, while Randy Quaid does a brilliant characterization of a derelict and ditzy hero who rises to the occasion once again when duty calls.
137;Will Smith is constantly getting off witty one liners that seem to capture the moment in pithy humor.
138;Jeff Goldblum played Jeff Goldblum, just as he always does, but as always too is very entertaining to watch.
139;Vivica Fox, as Jasmine, had the most active and interesting role among them, her motivating force being the well being of her little boy and the man she loved.
140;"The fine CGI finale makes one want to ""salute the flag,"" at least of the United Nations, as humanity once again defeats those nasty aliens with our human ingenuity and determination."
141;A fun movie for everyone in the family to watch.
142;The story is solid as are the performances and the special fx still hold up.
143;I want a good story and a good time.
144;I've never understood the success of the movie.
145;It has no script and nothing that approaches the storytelling elements of the great special effects films of a Speilberg or Lucas.
146;"I don't know exactly what I mean here but there is perhaps an economy and repetition of visuals whereas a movie such as ""The Fifth Element"" always has something new that you did not see before."
147;I love this movie like I love no other.
148;I can easily recite so many parts of it from memory.
149;the Limited Edition provides new content not seen in the original release.
150;The most notable of these additions is more back.
151;Will SMITH is a prodigy of steady humour and when the E. t COMES INTO BEING in front of his house after a good night when he bring out his dustbins what is his surprise to see his vision to see every body in his road and then, his neigbours departs HOTFOOT !
152;I really have to say that this movie is a real crowd pleaser because it appeals to the whole of the audience.
153;Are the new scenes super spectacular?
154;The new added scenes just add to character content within the movie.
155;That really adds alot to the movie by giving us a dose of reality that nothing bad happens to the good guys.
156;Disappointed as I love the movie.
157;A classic feel good film.
158;There is a lot of action in this movie and fabulous special effects.
159;The cast is excellent and Will Smith also interjects a bit of humor into this exciting alien invasion flick.
160;This is one of those films you must have in your film library.
161;The film is saved by the supporting characters who take turns being funny, touching, or panicky.
162;this film is an answer to ET and the optimism it expressed.
163;The odds of us meeting a similar civilization and have 'wars' with them would be precisely .0.
164;They were absolutely brilliantly cast and a lot of fun.
165;Take the Fresh Prince, Lonestar from Spaceballs, and a bunch of aleins looking to kill the human race and you get ID4.
166;Just enough romance to keep the ladies interested, and a pleasing emphasis on family values.
167;A really fun escape movie, lots of action even though the outcome was a forgone conclusion.
168;it was just as good as Armageddon with Bruce Willis.
169;Sure enough, only a few minutes into the film, we were hooked: the fantastic opening sequence shows Earth's moon, and suddenly, the supposedly.
170;In a fashion similar to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, people world.
171;although the plot may feel familiar, the development of the storyline is thrilling, and it is enhanced by an excellent cast.
172;Bill Pullman is surprisingly believable as the President, and the fine Robert Loggia is a natural general.
173;top, yet they are completely appropriate for the mood of the film.
174;And also like in Star Wars, this movie does have its cheese.y moments, but again, the goofiness fits right in.
175;A final comparison to Star Wars is the way I felt just after seeing the film for the first time, which is to say, amazed, exhilarated, and eager to view it again (which I did just two days later).
176;This is Sci Fi at its best!
177;The male leads in this show are so funny at times .
178;Kinda like real life, you gotta laugh if you don't wanna cry
179;This has always been one of my favorite big.
180;The bitrate stays consistently at 30Mbps (BLU.
181;this was a very impressive movie the first few times i saw it.
182;the original version was totaly in the prespective of the humans witch was good, i liked it, it was intended to be this way.
183;a commentary of the special effects guy is included within the normal version of the movie.
184;It is well worth listening to.
185;good Documentary and well worth the price for just the extras.
186;It aims to please, and sometimes does quite well.
187;It also is filled with seen.
188;Wish it were deeper and less of a slick, cute blender full of other movie moments.
189;Actually, ID4 can only be judged (by me anyway) as a tribute film, dedicated to the great sci.
190;Still, it is the perfect tribute to an era of science fiction that I grew up watching.
191;The actors are all characters that make itenjoyable every time I see it.
192;The first time I saw it, I thought it was great, but.
193;Great suspense when the UFOs arrive, a great soundtrack, great acting and very good SFX, but after 50 minutes, after the alien.
194;This movie shows that if we all pull together as a team instead of trying to do everything ourselves we can win.
195;this movie is old enough that its a great one to get on blu.
196;17 years after the original release, I watched this film with my family again.
197;Nothing really exceptional about it, but still entertaining for the genre and holds up against similar, more recent movies.
198;Star Wars took some imagination.
199;In this version the acting was good, and the dialogue was perfectly OK.
200;The story moves along at a great pace, and there's always something interesting to gawp at.
201;This is exactly what I like to see: heroes saving the world, baddies coming to bad ends, leaders leading from the front, family values and true love conquering.
202;Just the stuff to fill in some time with a bit of escapist fantasy, humour and entertainment.
203;I enjoyed this movie, but it wasn't quite as good as Robin Hood, which was much more realistic and credible.
204;But better than Saving Private Ryan.
205;The plot line is as predictable as predictable can be, but you love every second of it.
206;"When the President delivers his ""we will not go quietly into the night"" speech, you want to leap to your feet and salute."
207;I don't know how many times I've watched this movie (it's got to be on the high side of 15, but I still love it every time.
208;ray is outstanding, with magnificent color and resolution, and the soundtrack, well, puts those ugly suckers right in your living room with you.
209;well done, Mr. Emmerich, well done.
210;The product was great and I've enjoyed watching the video.
211;love this movie watch it every fourth of july.
212;great movie a classic must see anytime of the year!
213;The effects are great, the acting is about what you'd expect, the story's a zero.
214;Best Fourth of July movie ever!
215;'I got to get me one of these!'
216;I have seen it a million times and like it more and more.
217;It is fun, moving, cheesy, sweet, exciting, and has Will Smith.
218;What more do you need to be entertained?
219;find a good movie with huge screen and lates sound equipment, leave your IQ at home, and go enjoy it.
220;beware the other production of this film's makers.
221;ID4 had an extremely dumb story but you at least could enjoy the effects.
222;That will worth your money and time.
223;"This fulfills all of the expectations of a summer blockbuster
224;rah film can take you to a certainpoint, but it is easy to step over that line.
225;the virus did itfor me in this oneany film that uses classic dialogue such as this is reallife .
226;It's a smart, funny, suspenseful, sometimes even scary, and even touching cinematic masterpiece.
227;The story flows nicely and the characters are very human.
228;The one actress who is always overlooked (especially in the credits), Vivica A. Fox, gives the performance of a lifetime as a brave single mother who works at a strip bar and tries to save as many people as she can when the aliens attack.
229;I was thrilled to finally be able to watch this movie with the best sound available.
230;released in '96 `Independence Day' was the film that brought the possible threat of the OTHER aliens back into the forefront of our collective consciousness while also proving once and for all that Will Smith was more than just a comedian.
231;sublte comedic moments in the storyline along with an eclectic and somewhat oddball cast set this one apart from other movies in the sci.
232;fi genre, making for a truly unique and enjoyable viewing experience.
233;Add to that awesome special effects and a solid soundtrack, you've got a hit on your hands!
234;Awesome movie, I've watched it several times.
235;Will Smith is one of my favorite actors anyway.
236;but this is still a great movie.
237;The effects are amazing at times then extremely crappy at other moments!
238;Overall this is and ok movie and will probably become a camp classic in the future (You know its true!)
239;The US president, and a drunk cropduster manage to master the intracacies of an F.18, to save the world from invading aliens.
240;The audio is a bit unbalanced at times, particularly with the effects shots (overwhelmingly loud), but the score is powerful and well balanced (Dolby 5.1).
241;So sit back and enjoy a good ol fashioned American movie.
242;Winner of the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, Independence Day is a true summer blockbuster in the traditional sense.
243;fi thriller one of the biggest commercial draws of its time.
244;From an entertainment standpoint, it deserved every bit of attention.
245;Because Independence Day is an epic that a wide.
246;goers will find fun and enjoyable.
247;As the world's leading governments and militaries go on high alert, the world holds its breath waiting to see what will happen next.
248;as refugees crowd into the rural areas of America, Capt. Hiller is brought to Area 51 and introduced to the president.
249;with a new plan, David and Hiller fly the alien spacecraft right into the bowels of enemy territory.
250;Captured inside the mothership, Smith and Goldblum act out one of the more memorable scenes of the movie when they enjoy a pair of cigars while held in captivity.
251;In fact, it makes me want to go light up a fine Arturo Fuente right now!Overall, I didn't expect to like this film, and I did.
252;Surprisingly similar in its plot devices to the George Lucas hit The Return Of The Jedi, Independence Day is nevertheless a fun and enjoyable film.
253;see as a result of its overall entertainment value.
254;Take a chance and go see it if you haven't done so already.
255;The bonuses are okay, and there are a lot of them.
256;The commentary by Devlin Emmerich is funny, though.
257;In 1996, a film called Independence Day exploded onto the world and caused a frenzy in the Box Office.
258;The film is the second most successful sci.
259;the highest box office gross of a sci.
260;Independence Day is without a doubt one of the greatest films of all.
261;Yes, the script may be corny at times, but the special effects are absolutely mind.
262;And that's waht makes a good action film, isn't it?
263;People want to see the special effects and be entertained.
264;they're purely there to entertain you and Independence Day definitely does that!
265;The storyline to Independence Day is pretty basic really.
266;She's the president's communication director, and when David tells her what the aliens are up to, she convinces the president to listen.
267;They realise that all the space ships have an incredibly powerful protective barrier around them.
268;Independence Day really is the BIG and ultimate sci.
269;Director by Ronald Emmerich does a brilliant job with giving the audience a fantastic, thrilling time.
270;Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum are the main two and are excellent in their roles and the comedy factor of the film works rather well, unlike in some other films that are disasterous in trying to get the audience to laugh.
271;The way the film is worked around is an ingenious idea .
272;the fact that all this happens around the days on July 4th and that the world fights back in unison on Independence Day is brilliant.
273;fi films with an overall Star Wars feel (I hate all the Star Wars films), you will enjoy this film because it's so gripping and suspenseful.
274;but in this case it's definitely the former.
275;The final battle where they finally gain access to destroying the space ships is absolutely incredible .
276;like the Titanic sinking (in the film) but 100 times more epic and monsterous!
277;I feel like Will Smith overdid it a bit, and the acting was a bit blah, but it had enough drama and humor to back up the great special effects and good plot.
278;It's a very enjoyable story.
279;The 9 minutes of extra footage also allows for greater character development and explains more of the story.
280;My wife had never seen it and enjoyed it immensely.
281;The effects still hold up.
282;Will Smith is perfect as always, funny, tough, real.
283;Vivica Fox holds her own, and this is a perfect vehicle for Jeff Goldblum to play himself again.
284;Will Smith leads a cast of amazing actors to fight against an evil race of aliens.
285;It is still amazing to me that this film was the top grossing movie of 1996, followed by """"Twister"""", which in many ways was equally cheesy."""
286;Oh, yeah, I almost forgot about that incident 3 years ago.
287;the reason I am even giving this film two stars is for one, the special effects are impressive in a movie that has precious little else going for it.
288;Even with what the writers/directors give him to work with he steals the show.
289;"Plus, the ""buddy"" thing he has going with Jeff Goldblum's character when they go to deliver the computer virus to the alien spacecraft comes off well."
290;I absolutly love this movie.
291;I would so recomend this movie to everyone!
292;A favorite of mind Will Smith is really a good actor and person.
293;Plus I like the way he has included his whole family in the movies.
294;By the way the movie was a really good movie also.
295;Very happy that it was in great condition.
296;Will smith is great and the aliens are gross.
297;Thank you do much, will order from you again.
298;Action, Drama along with a bit of humor proves Independence Day a want to view time after time!
299;This movie was great on the big screen when it was released back in 1996.
300;and it's even better now that we have our very own big screen at home!I love the Amazon Instant Video, so now we can watch it from anywhere .
301;Great special effects, ending was silly.
302;Its a great movie that everyone can enjoy.
303;it's a good movie and i like how you guys at amazon can help me get what i need even toys that you can't find in stores for my kids.
304;If you like sy fy and Will Smith you will like this movie.
305;No doubt Independence Day is a pretty entertaining film.
306;Vivica A. Fox provides a touching, well.
307;and his characters speak under their breaths as well).
308;Thoroughly entertaining in many ways.
309;Overall, Independence Day is brilliant save for some acting.
310;Just received this and it DOES NOT have DTS.
311;It has good character developments and acting.
312;This was a blockbuster movie on the big screen, not to mention being one of the largest grossing films in the last ten years.
313;Throw in some amazing special effects, an incredibly inspirational speech by the President, a sexy, yet seemingly out.
314;place exotic dance scene, and the comedic acting of superstar Will Smith, and you have one really enjoyable film.
315;the special effect were truly remarkable, and complimented nicely with a good sound.
316;The acting, for the most part, was good.
317;Will Smith was truly perfect in his role, with outstanding timing, and the perfect mix of humor and seriousness.
318;You cannot help but be moved and inspired by his candid words.
319;Jeff Goldblum also added in a good performance as the scientist trying to save the planet, and Judd Hirsch was super as his hilarious, witty father.
320;overall, this was a good film, guaranteed to bring you a couple of hours of entertainment.
321;fetched, keeps the viewer intrigued right through to Randy Quaid's heroic performance at the end.
322;This film will make you cheer out loud.
323;Watched it the day I received it and it played flawlessly!
324;as with most really good blu.
325;The sound is absolutely spectacular and will give your subwoofer a workout.
326;I got this movie already and am so happy about that.
327;A bunch of really nifty explosions, which is great if you were fortunate to see them on the big screen.
328;This really is a film best experienced in a movie theatre.
329;All of his action flicks are amazing.
330;His humor and his laugh makes the movie.
331;back when will smith was cool and squeaky clean.
332;lite popcorn flick, and that's EXACTLY what it is.
333;fi movies I have ever seen+that is precisely what makes it so enjoyable.
334;There are holes in the plot big enough to drive a starship thru,yet the film somehow allows you to ignore them+still have fun.
335;The performances are excellent given the material.
336;one of the reasons this film works is that the actors do not take themselves or the film that seriously.
337;My advice is very simple:Turn your brain off+enjoy the ride.
338;Every single cast member was invited onto at least one of the talk shows at least once a piece before the movie even hit theatres.
339;"wide and excited
340;The actors playing the array of characters are priceless.
341;Now that's great writing and acting!
342;I really do love this move!
343;It is a classic plus is looks and sounds even better in Blu.
344;A must have to check out any system!
345;I've seen it about 30 times, or so and I love it more every time.
346;The special effects are great even by todays standards, much better than the soulless 98% computer generated """"Star Wars: Episode 2."""""""
347;And therefore, a band of American heros form, so on and so on.
348;Plus, you can choose the theatrical version, or the special edition version with 15 mins of extra scenes.
349;A good movie, well produced, great actors.
350;A movie for the whole family.
351;Love this movie, I like to watch it on NEW YEARS EVE because I am usually up later and don't go to parties
352;well judging by the the other reviewers.
353;this generations classic science fiction motion picture.
354;well made , great, ahead of its time for yes its special effects and to a degree .
355;you cant help but cheer for it in spite of its self.
356;an all time great that will stand the test of time.
357;Really enjoyed Emmerich's vision and purity of it as the vision was seen to fruition through the various stages of its creation.
358;The action is fun, and Will Smith is funny.
359;Good Film, Picture is greatly improved from Standard Definition and slightly upgraded from 1080i, If you enjoy this movie and you can nab it at a decent price on amazon you wont be disappointed by the sound either.
360;Yes, and many of the scenes are unbelievable last second escape, but this is what adds to the excitement and value of this movie.
361;The graphics are awesome, and the movie keeps moving for 2 hours and 15 minutes.
362;It is also good to see alians that are not the usual primate like most films.
363;The film is so filled with little details that go so fast that the film is worth watching again and again.
364;But I guess if you steal enough ideas, you can make it look original.
365;The fact that the mother ships are impervious to even nuclear weapons was stolen from the great 1950s version of War of the Worlds.4.
366;are made for one purpose alone: to make money.
367;i am very happy to have this movie on Blu.
368;be nice to be an un.
369;It's a great movie and I wanted to add it to my library!
370;Bill Pullman does some of his best work!
371;Still and excellent Watch for July 4th !!
372;I am an avid scifi buff, I love it.
373;ID4 is a great movie, even though it is overplayed on TV.
374;I enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it in the theatre and continue to enjoy it on Blu.
375;Emmerich did a great job when he did Stargate and Universal Soldier but then made this and I have seen it 11 times already but each time I hate parts of it yet I always go back, go figure.
376;high flames and destroys the city.
377;This movie has certainly aged well these thirteen years, and the special effects are still terrific even today.
378;of feature, trailers, and cast/crew interviews.
379;"layered ""special edition"" version will come out over the next year or so."
380;but to review this movie, its one of my all time favorites, you can't go wrong with it and this will be an extremely worthy addition to your growing Blu.
381;It was a gift to my son.
382;It was on his wish list and he was delighted when he got it.
383;Brings both tears and joy in the watching.
384;Aliens (from outer space) use Apple computers!
385;I cheered in the theater when they started blowing up things.
386;It is amazing that George Pal's War of the Worlds still is one the best alien invasion movies ever.
387;"The solution in Hollywood nowadays is to ""up the ante"" within the movie itself AND from movie to movie."
388;A lot of the best Sci fi were also popcorn films too.
389;I walked away forgetting most of it right away.
390;A good popcorn film always stays in my memory.
391;now, the second half is worth Jeff Goldblum's weight in gold.
392;the play between Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith is fantastic.
393;defiantly a film to see, the second half that is.
394;The special edition if ID4 has both the original theatrical version and the 9 minute longer Special Edition which skews the story quite a bit.
395;The original lacked details of some of the key characters lives and backgrounds and those extra 9 minutes certainly add a lot of it back in.
396;bill Pulman, Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith still make a great combination of talents in what has to be one of the SFX extravaganzas of the decade.
397;It has personal drama, planetary threats, romance, humor, excitement.
398;The eye candy of Jeff Goldblum's muscles and chest in this one and everything Will Smith is a bonus.
399;ID4 has many new twists though and an expanded story.
400;Overall, ID4 endures as an excellent movie with good acting, superior special effects, and a compelling story overall.
401;This movie is really just a special effects bonanza, but it's a lot of fun and suprisingly enough can make you feel very patriotic towards the end.
402;The plot is simple but it works well.
403;This is a great film that has lots of action thought provoking scenes to bring up all your patriotic feelings.
404;It's also great to see Will Smith and Bill Pullman who are both great actors!
405;You'll enjoy this movie watch it over and over!
406;A wonderfully acted science fiction story that reminds us of how precious freedom and independence are.
407;He loves watching this movie and it looks amazing in Blu.
408;Many stars appear here, and several give top.
409;Judd Hirsch gives a great turn as Jeff Goldblum's dad, and Will Smith gives a star.
410;Jeff Goldblum gives his usual intense performance as the lead scientist who happens upon the code the aliens are using and also helps save the human race.
411;I know this sounds VERY hokey, but it's all part of the special charm of the film.
412;All this is secondary to the special effects here.
413;This film won the Academy Awards for best visual effects and best sound, and believe me, it richly deserved them.
414;inspiring now as when the film came out in 1996.
415;Believe me, this film is a fun ride from start to finish.
416;sharp, and the sound is staggering.
417;Check out the original biplane ending feature, it's so great to see that something so outrageous as an old biplane taking out a huge alien ship was actually considered at all!
418;Anyway, this film is nonstop fun, and should make a great addition your collection.
419;i did enjoy the film at the theater.
420;I love the story and the cast.
421;Bill Pullman makes a great president.
422;It's a comic book with great special effects and lots of one.
423;this is great movie, I can not wait until they come with Independence Day 2.
424;ID4 was a fun event movie.
425;It is the cinematic equivalent of going on a ride at a carnival.
426;That being said, what is interesting is how many people have had such strong differing responses to this movie.
427;Cigars are regarded as a victory dance.
428;I did, however, agree with the other reasons for changing it.
429;Now there is a great Popcorn movie!
430;From the audio commentary to the original ending (cleverly hidden in the menu of disc 2) to the 3 documentaries on the making of this film, this a great collector's item and a very enjoyable movie to boot.
431;Independence Day is the quintessential summer blockbuster movie.
432;Not only do I love this movie, I love it just as much every time I watch it.
433;We see into the hearts and souls of an impressive number of very realistic characters, and I for one feel myself as one with all of the brave survivors of the initial alien onslaught, watching, hoping, and praying that America and the world can come together and defeat yet another seemingly unbeatable enemy.
434;I sometimes enjoy pulling for the bad guys in films, but the aliens that arrive suddenly on earth with a plan of exterminating every human being on the planet are pure evil, guaranteeing that the feelings of one and all movie viewers will rest completely with the forces of good.
435;In the end, the survival of humanity itself comes down to the brave acts of America's real heroes .
436;good old regular, every day, anonymous Americans.
437;President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) also stands head and shoulders among the crowd of heroes, as does Capt. Steven Hiller (Will Smith) and Levinson himself.
438;independence Day is blessed with both amazing special effects and a wonderful cast.
439;I'm no big fan of Jeff Goldblum or Bill Pullman, but they are both superb in this film.
440;"Will Smith is both inspiring and hilarious as Capt. Hiller
441;His interplay with Levinson toward the end of the film offers some truly high caliber comedy, just the thing needed to try and hold one's blood pressure down as the final battle for earth itself is being waged.
442;The special effects are simply tremendous, boasting some especially well.
443;The sight of the White House being destroyed in the blink of an eye by alien firepower is now a staple of pop culture, and it is just one of a huge number of similarly impressive explosions to be seen here.
444;The manner in which the film opens is quite eerily effective, and the director obviously went to great and rewarding pains to try and show just how huge these ships are compared to earth's structures and inhabitants.
445;this really is the most exhilarating movie I own.
446;I just cannot say enough good things about Independence Day"
447;stirring films I have ever seen.
448;The added stuff in the Special Edition part wants to repeat itself several times.
449;This was an excillant film the first time I saw it.
450;I've also heard it has a lot of cool extras.
451;Picture/Audio is extremely good with Audio being OUTSTANDING on blu.
452;I rate this item because this movie is a perfect item to have.
453;i love this item because this item is a good movie to watch with family.
454;One of my all time favorite movies.
455;the good parts of the movie stops when Will Smith flies through the grand canyon.
456;Featuring the dumbest lines in movie history, ( WOMP!
457;and some of the dumbest actions ever (let's upload a virus into the Alien computer!)
458;This is by far one of the best science fiction films of all time.
459;It is incredibly suspensfull, the special effects are incredible, and the plot is fantastic.
460;Also the acting was pretty good, but more importantly I felt truly attached to the main characters unlike the way I feel about many other films.
461;I have a version of this movie on LaserDisc and have enjoyed it immensely many times.
462;"ray edition provides excellent sound and picture with heavy involvement of the surround speakers
463;i was impressed all over again with the depth of character development found in this film, especially in comparison with some of the newer releases on the subject.
464;For that price it's a great value for those who love the movie and is available with free shipping with Prime.
465;Haven't seen it for a while, and strangly wanting to see it again.
466;It's got great actors, great special affects, and a simple and flowing story.
467;Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) expression when the ships first get through the atmosphere is telling of how good the rest of the movie might be.
468;I can't say how much I'm drawn in by the special affects, but this 1 has got watch again value.
469;Will Smith was probably the best part of the cast for me.
470;Yes, of course, that was a major part of the fun.
471;Will Smith was at his classic best.
472;The president's speech at the end makes You want to stand up and salute.
473;What a joke of a movie, it only got good attendance because of the special affects.
474;Will Smith is over rated and over acts.
475;He took offense to it, and actually tried to convince me it was a good movie.
476;You'll only be encouraging more movies like this.
477;I enjoy this movie alot.
478;Its a make you feel good type of movie.
479;Plenty of action and good flying scenes.
480;Nice fourth of July movie to watch.
481;Great special effects, and I liked the way they mixed humor in with drama .
482;Just for the fun of it, go see all his other reviews.
483;This is a truly awesome movie.
484;None of this changes the fact that this is one heckuva great action movie.
485;I've seen reviews that ran this movie down because it was too biased"
486;This is the best movie!
487;I hadn't seen it for several years and thoroughly enjoyed seeing it again.
488;Wil Smith's lines are wonderful!
489;One of the best Alien invasion action movies, amazing effects, great acting and an awesome story, highly recommended!
490;Very good story and is a collectors item for me.
491;Another great Will Smith movie.
492;He is just fun to watch in action and great actor.
493;The storyline was a little bit silly but in general, it was well done.
494;This is a very fun movie, especially with the 5.1 sound.
495;this movie IS a good movie.
496;a lot of fun,just check your brain at the door and enjoy.
497;i remember it in the theater.
498;i like everybody and everyone.
499;"it was the movie ""airplane"",the scene where the boy walks up to the girl(both white) and offers her a cup of coffee."
500;two good movies,yes they are.
501;thanks for reading if you've made it this far.
502;This is one of my favorite all time movies.
503;ray version knowing that it would be fantastic!
504;I am extremely happy with the product.
505;It is so much better in blu.
506;Independence Day is a very entertaining movie.
507;The special effects are excellent and Will Smith's humour is as usual, spot on.
508;line is pretty weak, but that's okay, this is a movie designed to entertain, not make you think.
509;"Nice line ""Welcome to earth"", but the whole scene is a real let down."
510;What about his curiosity as to what else is inside the craft, he is a pilot who wants to be an astronaut for crying out loud?
511;Then there are other ridiculous scenes such as the President giving his patriotic speech, which sounds like it was written to be given to a whole nation, or nations and he delivers it to a handful of people.
512;Independence DayThis is a great film for anyone who is a fan of Sci.
513;fi, and Action combined with humor.
514;Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum have a good chemistry with their respective roles.
515;I enjoyed Judd Hirsch playing the role of Jeff's father.
516;Lots of spectacular special effects.
517;Very good and great to hear loud!!
518;This is my favorite alien invasion movie and for good reason.
519;this is a great film to add to your movie collection.
520;I still remember very vividly when my mom yelled Oh My God!
521;upon seeing it, I have to say that Independence Day is one of the greatest sci.
522;fi action movies that I have ever seen.
523;this is a truly magnificent movie.
524;The movie is a superb package of stunning visual effects and an entertaining, adrenaline.
525;The action spans through the length of the feature, and Independence Day will undoubtedly remain one of the most masterful science fiction films to date.
526;It's pure escapism, a vehicle to take us away (if only temporarily) from the trials and tribulations of our busy lives.
527;This is a science fiction Disneyland, complete with laughs, thrills, drama, intrigue, and heartpounding action.
528;if memory serves me correctly, this was Will Smith's first major role on the big screen.
529;Not only is he very funny, he projects a commanding presence that subsequently launched his cinematic career.
530;Jeff Goldblum is wonderful as nervous computer guru David Levinson, and his chemistry and timing with Smith is fun to watch.
531;So pull up a chair, relax. . . escape.
532;Great movie, wish there were more extras, but the movie is the important part, and it's a modern classic.
533;It is the best sci.
534;fi films of today and praise so many of the so called movies with a message .
535;If entertainment is what you are looking for this is a great two hours of intense sci.
536;Once again i have discovered what the reviews say is bad, i seem to enjoy.
537;It does give you two hours of entertainment and something of the same kind of feeling that watching and hearing the spectacular 3000 person band play at University of Michigan's stadium in football Season (as it did, at least once, some sixty odd years ago).
538;The stunts, impressive on normal TV must be pretty spectacular on updated equipment.
539;The score does an excellent job of reinforcing and enhancing the plot, and the supporting actors do a good job in roles that were well delineated from early in the life of films.
540;While 4 stars is probably pretty generous for this film, it is entertaining, nonetheless.
541;It most certainly has some of the best special effects I have ever seen.
542;It's kind of like a remake of a 1950s movie with an updated SF package.
543;will Smith is certainly not my favorite actor, but he turns in a suprisingly strong performance as a Marine fighter pilot ace.
544;Bill Pulman is a likeable, youthfull president who was a fighter pilot himself during Desert Storm.
545;That said, this movie does pass as good eye candy.
546;It is such a good film that it is too bad.
547;summer special effects, over the top, action flick.
548;the special effects are good for their time, and still hold up fairly well.
549;will Smith is just fine for me as a Marine Corps fighter pilot.
550;I for once actully enjoyed his part in a movie.
551;He gives the best he's got, and comes across as a decent choice for the role, but I really do feel that the role could have been cast more beleivably.
552;the most likable characters are the 'second tier' actors.
553;It makes alot more sense and seems to flow better.
554;But it's a two star movie for me.
555;If you keep paying to watch movies that pander to the lowest common denominator like this movie does, they will continue to make such pabulum.
556;There is so much packed into 2 discs its crazy.
557;First off, I really love this movie to begin with, so this set is for any ID4 fan.
558;On disc one there is a special edition of this movie with about 9 minutes of additional footage, although it actually seems like a lot less.
559;The second disc is packed with suppliments.
560;My favorite was seeing an alternate ending using the biplane, it was quite funny and i'm a little surprised they didnt stick with that one.
561;There is also a neat hidden easter egg on this disc which most people will likely miss.
562;The spaceship in the background will start to move, once it lets you, quickly go back to the main menu and press 7 then 4 and enter and it will kick you inside the ship where it has a lot of cool extra features.
563;At that moment, the concept for their next film was born.
564;What it does have is a love for old sci.
565;fi B. movies like The Day the Earth Stood Still, movies made to be more fun than based in heady subtext or scientific fact.
566;happy government suit whose only response to a problem seems to involve firing all available weaponry at the enemy despite the repeated failure of said weaponry.
567;But the special effects are the real stars here (though some shots do look noticibly green.
568;screened if you look closely), and the underdog story of outgunned and outmatched Earth forces taking on a seemingly invincible alien threat is a crowd pleaser.
569;This is probably the best film by Emmerich and Devlin to date, something that doesn't look to be changing anytime soon.
570;It shows he ability to be an action star and him and Jeff make a good combo.
571;plus it add a berief felling of strong in a moment of trial because of our heros.
572;Overall it is a good movie.
573;This is definitely one of the cooler testosterone.
574;fueled movies I've seen in a long time!
575;I4 is pure entertainment, out to do nothing but excite you.
576;The special effects were satisfyingly awesome and the overall pace quick.
577;funny at the right time, hair.
578;I love action films and I enjoy sci.
579;This movie is well worth the money.
580;Even though this movie has all the flaws a script could have, including plot holes the size of Texas, unbelievable shortcuts and clich s abound, the overall result is both, technically and visually impressive.
581;The image, sound and fxs are top notch, not to say a landmark for sci fi movies.
582;On the other hand, you could argue some of the decision's taken, like Bill Pullman's miscasting as President of the U. s. but, nevertheless, it's a very entertaining movie.
583;All the extras give added value to the original and help us understand and admire it.
584;This may not be art, yet, its a skillful treat.
585;One of my favorite summer movies of all time, enjoyed it even more on blu ray.
586;Paying extra for it sure worth it.
587;if you have not seen this move you need to, a great action classic in my book, had to have it for the family collection.
588;This movie as off the charts with the special effects.
589;It is movie that gives you alot of action, fun and some good laughs.
590;I thought Independence Day was great because it provided exactly what it was suppose to provide, action, fun and laughs.
591;I also think that Judd Hirsch's character and the interaction between him and Jeff Goldblum was very funny.
592;The documentary on disc 2 about how the aliens were filmed helped him really understand that this is just a movie.
593;Thank you for showing us how the movie was made.
594;Regardless of its shortcomings, this is an enjoyable fun ride.
595;(I was happy to learn that there might be two sequels in the works.
596;I hope this is true and not just another rumor.)
597;Great performances by all especially Randy Quaid.
598;My family and I enjoyed this movie very much.
599;It was so exciting and suspenseful.
600;and still want to see it more .
601;Seriously, this movie is amazing.
602;For a bonus round, spot all the Star Wars homages!
603;This is my favorite Will Smith movie.
604;Leave it to Roland Emmerich to take classic theme and massacre it with a bunch of flashy special effects.
605;"This film totally apes ""War of the World"" and ""V"", two of my favorite movies that involves aliens trying to take over earth."
606;Gotta love the last shots of the film where the Egyptian pyramids and the Australian opera house manages to stay intact despite the destruction around them.
607;"this whole theme of alien invasion has been played out and ""Independence Day"" definitely helped make this popular scifi theme tiresome."
608;"V was campy and fun which ""Independence Day"" doesn't even come close."
609;all great Special Editions with extras.
610;The same is true of Independence Day.
611;Disc 2 is just full of Extra Features.
612;Great Special Effects CGI throughout the movie.
613;Great performances by Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Will Smith, Randy Quaid, Robert Loggia, Judd Hirsch and many more.
614;Movie gets a 4 .
615;As always, I really enjoyed watching this movie again.
616;Nonetheless, I ponied up so i could see it again.
617;if you enjoy an action packed film, this might be a good pick for you.
618;Seven years ago, I remember seeing Independence Day in theaters.
619;I remember thinking it was an extremely entertaining time at the movies, but bear in mind, I was all of 11 at the time.
620;Independence is most certainly not a good movie, and while it might make for so.
621;As a matter of fact, ID4 can't even take the claim for best alien invasion flick of 1996.
622;independence Day has a lot of things going for it: a great premise, energetic action sequences, first.
623;rate special effects, a number of good laughs, and the occasional bit of awe.
624;wise, thus avoiding a huge crash on the target below them.
625;The film does deliver some thrills, but inconsistently in a movie that runs for nearly two.
626;There are two scenes in this movie worth seeing: the White House being destroyed, and Will Smith punching out the alien, saying Welcome to Earth .
627;Watch it for the pretty special effects, enjoy throwing popcorn at the screen, and go home wondering why Randy Quaid still has a career after mouthing Here I am Mr. President .
628;Watch it for what it is: an suspenseful action.
629;The subplots are interesting, and the special effects won't really disappoint.
630;The actors and their characters are memorable (the chemstry between Goldblum and Hirsch is a plus for the father.
631;David Arnold's music is spectacular, and it's one of my favorite scores.
632;Oh, if only I had been able to see this on the big screen.
633;What an experience that would be!
634;"INDEPENDENCE DAY is one of the best movies I've ever seen
635;Casting is perfect, music is spectacular, and special effects . . . . . . .
636;It's no wonder they won an Oscar for them.
637;wracking suspense and simple, wholesome humor), and turns it into a modern masterpiece of epic proportions.
638;In my opinion, it should've won Best Picture of 1996!
639;of documentaries are insightful and very interesting, the mocumentary is pretty entertaining, and the menus are just plain awesome!
640;Every single new scene/addition brings more depth, characterization, and humor to the story.
641;I thought that was a great gesture that never really comes all that often.
642;I know that feedback means a lot and you are so right, if I am happy I rarely leave feedback.
643;The movie works wonderfully and I am very happy with my product, price and the professional service.
644;I will continue to order from this company from now on.
645;special mention has to go to an incredible score by David Arnold.
646;This was his follow up punch to his amazing Stargate score, and he has never come close again to the heights of ID4 and Stargate music compositions.
647;Product came in fine and viewed fine .
648;Very pleased with Amazon's handling of my order.
649;one of jeff goldblum's and will smith's best.
650;in addition you get a making of special, a promotional spoof, trailers, and commentaries out the wazoo.
651;picture and sound qualities are impecable and recreated the theatrical feel perfectly.
652;the price is a bit high but damn its worth every penny.
653;His constant asinine comments throughout the film.
654;And he has these kinds of scenes throughout the film.
655;series V had a more realistic approach to dealing with the aliens than this film.
656;This movie is an excellent vehicle for special effects and Will Smith.
657;It is a good blend of action and science fiction with enough humor thrown in to keep it entertaining after many viewings.
658;Still, the action scenes help tie it all together in a neat, slick package.
659;This isn't film but it is entertaining and destined to be a standard in the video collections of many a movie buff.
660;This is undoubtedly one of the most fun sci.
661;From Dean Devlin himself (Producer), it's really a popcorn movie.
662;Sit down, eat your popcorn, and enjoy the ride.
663;Nonetheless, this movie still succeeds.
664;The story is fun and easy to follow, the characters are believable (and equally fun to watch!)
665;, and the special effects are still (4 years later) among the best you'll ever see.
666;The special edition edits sometimes seem a bit rough, but the scenes are still worth watching.
667;You got it, and LOTS of it!
668;You've got ALL the trailers and TV spots, some cool interviews and movie specials, and more.
669;This disc is recommended in every way.
670;First off, I can tell you that I have always loved this movie for what it is and always has been.
671;a better than average sci.
672;And it's got IMHO one of the best written speaches that ever hit the big screen (the president's speach to the pilots).
673;Kudos to the writer who wrote that.
674;ON THE OTHER HAND, if you love this movie.
675;rays and I will be the first one to say that the technology is well worth the price tag of these disks and getting a new player.
676;it's worth double it's price tag.
677;It's played in it's original format.
678;Seeing the original format after watching the blue ray version brings it all into perspective.
679;The detail on the new Blu.
680;There are problems with it plot wise, etc. but it is still a very good sci.
681;America has a new independence day.
682;This is the story that is full of action, some romance, a little comedy and more action.
683;By the time it concludes you're worn out and proud to be a human.
684;Have fun and watch this fantasy?
685;Fine then, 17 stars it is!
686;Movie is entertaining but Blue Ray transfer dissapoints!
687;hit Independence Day, I'm still amazed, and amused at the people who insist on questioning the science behind.
688;It really brings a smile to my face.
689;Those people (even if they have a point) also make me laugh.
690;cheek tribute to 50's sci.
691;Before Roland Emmerich found success (thanks to this film) and tried to make the end of the world his ongoing obsession (along with taking himself too seriously) he made two gems that us movie fans will love forever: Stargate and this film.
692;first the transer which, I think, is pretty outstanding.
693;the military uniforms are a perfect example of this.
694;There is some grain but I'm fine with that.
695;Even the effects, which were done right before the onset of CGI hold up very well.
696;All the model work, motion control shots and blue screen compositions look seamless.
697;In this case, the hiding was very well done or the people who transfered the film really did their homework.
698;The mix is pretty outstanding too.
699;It only includes the theatrical version which is fine but here is the thing: The best extra by far in the package is the pop.
700;up track that gives you little details of the film and it's production as you watch the film.
701;The track is very insightful and fans of the film will really enjoy learning all the details, bloopers and stories.
702;independence Day is a very entertaining film and it has aged very well.
703;The Fresh Prince of Bel.
704;fi epic quells any critical acclaim """"The Secret of Nimh"""" or """"Poetic Justice"""" received."""
705;Her underrated performance emoted the strength of a Mr. Miyagi crane kick, yet tendered the loving care of Sophia Loren's bosom, despite the fact that her character's primary profession is exotic dancing.
706;Just like many other movies that has come out, are not made for anyone els then the american audience, and for us european it's just another reason to laugh at america!But this movie is not really about that, and if you can put aside all the plot holes, bad acting and save the world nonsence, this is a great movie.
707;Just try to keep in mind that this movie was made for 14 year olds, and you'll see that this is truly fun!
708;The film uses very subtle tongue.
709;"cheek humor throughout (at the beginning of the movie, the SETI personnel are listening to ""It's The End of the World As We Know It"" on the radio) and takes the audience on wild ride."
710;Special effects are great and so's the story.
711;The Fourth of July was never so much fun
712;The diffrence is that it's a good one, a really really good one.
713;ID4 has been my favorite movie since I saw it in '96.
714;Smith does a nice job of playing the hero, and Goldblum fits into his genius role once again with his natual smooth talent.
715;Actors were fun to watch and their interaction was well.
716;will Smith brought it all to gether!
717;What a great movie it is.
718;For everyone in America, this will doubtless be the feelgood blockbuster of the year.
719;the story is nice and simple.
720;Now I've had my go at that subject, I'll continue.
721;"For the English we have the likes of ""crikey, aliens are invading!"
722;"Better put the kettle on"" and so forth."
723;Nobody seems to mind that aliens invading the world actually involves the rest of the world.
724;anyway, if you can swallow the absurd jingoism, is it actually a good film?
725;yet again playing his terminal character, the scatterbrained noble genius, but he does it well and is amusing in all his scenes.
726;Bill Puttman is a questionably brave and strong president, probably ranking above the rest of the rather over.
727;comical cast (Will Smith, love him or hate him, does what he does best .
728;yell, do action scenes and come out with one.
729;the effects are, of course, grand and good.
730;And of course it's entertaining throughout, delivering nothing but eye.
731;pleasing action and lots of loud noises.
732;it's well worth the title of blockbuster, and is truly suited to those with brains firmly switched off.
733;So I can watch it and like it if I don't think about it .
734;and some of it's moments (Puttman's speech, from a certain perspective .
735;for example) are touching and funny.
736;So there is definitely fun to be had, and it is, as much as it pains me to say it, definitely worth watching it.
737;americans it will prove a guilty pleasure, and for those for whom it was made, it will prove a heart.
738;So watch it, laugh at or with it, and enjoy it anyway.
739;One of the best classics, the plot is great, action, actors makes your eyes stay glued to the screen till the very end.
740;This is a great movie!
741;The special effects are brilliant.
742;It's a really good plot, as well.
743;I have watched this movie so many times, it's great.
744;It makes me feel good that I don't live in a big city like New York.
745;Anyway, this was a huge blockbuster hit and it's no surprise why.
746;The cast was excellent and the special effects were really really cool!
747;My favorite shot it when all of the RV's are driving through the white desert, it's really funny, but cool!
748;The special features didn't realyl excite me that much, but the movie is still great.
749;I reccomend this movie to anyone, it's really great!
750;This is American patriotism at its very best, yet you forget all of that with the amount of action, comedy and typical plotlines.
751;There one liners always crack you up, and once again, America is always the one that saves the day!A simple plot .
752;aliens threaten the world's (more so America's) existence and someone (America) has to do something about it.
753;To my surprise, I was impressed with the acting performance of Will Smith, and basically the entire cast.
754;The pics of the spaceships and aliens are astonishing, and sound effects are awesome.
755;I have watched this thrilling movie over 15 times, because I enjoy the acting.
756;There are emotional moments that bring silence, and tears to your eyes.
757;In addition, there are extremely funny moments such as Will Smith screaming at an unconscious alien, while dragging him through a burning desert.
758;My family and I went to see this at the show when it came out, I think it was on the 4th of July, and we loved it then.
759;bill Pullman's speech to rev up the troops is one of my favorite from any movie.
760;I have seen it 3 times and have added this to my collections.
761;Some exciting moments, good special effects but not too much logic or reality.
762;ID4 is a fun, little movie that harkens back to the good old days of 1950s sci.
763;It's witty, funny, and jammed full of action.
764;This film has it all.
765;Very impressive as it appeals to all levels intellectually and emotionally.
766;It covers the entire gamut splendidly delivering pure entertainment.
767;The US is the most aggressive nation ever.
768;No doubt the star here are the Oscar.
769;Some parts of the story sound totally oddball but carry the film just enough to hold our interest.
770;fi films of the 1950's helps a lot.
771;Mankind uses its ingenuity and indominable spirit and band together to defeat the aliens against incredible odds.
772;this is a movie that may very well have set out to poke fun at its own genre, which is something it must be commended for, intended or not.
773;fact is that this is a visually incredible movie with a plot that holds the viewer at the edge of thier seat.
774;It's a spectacular piece of eye candy and you can't help but root for the good guys.
775;I realise that by writing a disfavourable review to a popular movie, one sets themselves up for criticism.
776;Good movie, but the disc skips, had to send this one back.
777;Great movie: action packed, funny, and very patriotic.
778;"We all love our country and hope the USA does well in all endeavors
779;fi classic like """"Colossus: The Corbin Project"""" for something more nutritive than this high."""
780;This has been a family favorite for years.
781;Good wholesome entertainment for the family.
782;an exciting thing has happened.
783;if aliens have technology advanced enough to cross so many light years, that would suggest very sophisticated mental ability.
784;An old craft that has been hidden by the US government for several years is uncovered.
785;Two men (played by Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum) somehow learn to pilot the craft and fly it to the mother ship out in space.
786;So deep down, I always wanted to check it out.
787;And, yes, the visuals were stunning even in this antiquated format.
788;Before seeing this movie, I had always wondered how well Bill Pullman (an actor I genuinely like) would pull off being presidential.
789;He's presidential in that youthful John F. Kennedy/Bill Clinton kind of way.
790;But also unlike Kennedy, he's still young and able enough to enter into actual battle once again himself.
791;He's got that cute and newly motherless little tyke (the one who later showed up on CHICAGO HOPE) to take care of, so he cannot allow himself to fail.
792;Somehow Quaid is able to inject some humanity and some wit into his stock loser.
793;These mostly very good, widely respected actors have their work cut out for them if they want to move their characters at all beyond the level of the stereotype.
794;Funny thing is, most of them do.
795;Margaret Colin is stunning and sassy as a Presidential Aide.
796;"Her performance is good enough that you have to wonder why she never became ""Then Next Big Thing"" after all, and I say this with utter conviction, even though I must admit that at the same time, I still keep mixing her up with Elizabeth Perkins."
797;But in a tongue in cheek way, you understand.
798;fi flicks is that their dazzling special effects are so overwhelming that you really don't want to be bothered with much else.
799;and yeah, it's just cornball enough.
800;And yeah, danged if it doesn't all work somehow.
801;This is one of my favorite movies.
802;It has a great cast and is enjoyable to watch each time I see it.
803;ray is really nice on this film and the color is exceptionally nice too.
804;I'm glad they put this in 2:35:1 aspect ratio so you can see the whole movie as the director wanted it to be seen in.
805;Aliens invade Earth and the peopleunite to fight back.
806;fi flick with a good cast and cool effects.
807;on story structure works perfectly to create an exiting, if implausible, crowd pleaser.
808;Sports fans must love this movie.
809;I am highly satisfied with this movie and would recommend it to anyone.
810;And Will Smith was so great to watch on film.
811;This movie is pure escape, and well done.
812;This movie is about the MYTH that is us, and that's why it works.
813;Will and Jeff were great in this, but the best scene was the suicide/kamikazi drunkard pilot who takes out the mother ship after telling his rag.
814;tag, mixed race children that he loves them.
815;That one pulls at your heart strings and SHOWS you what it means to be a hero and a human and a recalcitrant mutt (American) at the same time.
816;And in that way it is very real.
817;There was absolutely no love between the older sister and the younger brother.
818;Also, more scenes showing Dylan with his mom (Vannessa Williams, excellent as usual) were needed.
819;Good action, but more sentimentality was needed.
820;Independence Day certainly succeeds in that regard.
821;The movie comes with a French soundtrack.
822;the movie is still superior in the theatrical edition.
823;the second disc is crammed with extras including various theatrical and television trailers, a documentary about the special effects, and an amusing mockumentary about the invasion.
824;I love this movie and really wanted to see it on July 4th.
825;It's an all around fun movie.
826;Sure, right from the get go we know WHO will win.
827;The cast is a hoot.
828;They just seem to have enjoyed making the movie and it shows in their work.
829;This is one worth watching each and every Independence Day.
830;Great movie in the theater because of the special effects.
831;So it's War of the Worlds updated, but some sequences are absolutely awesome.
832;Still good on television, especially if you have a large screen.
833;Very good movie with good effects.
834;it's an old plot, but wonderfully done with good acting.
835;The movie is very entertaining.
836;It is a 2 disc release that is packed with special features including the extended version of the movie.
837;In a way this movie reminds me of another great movie Armageddon .
838;Both has the same thrill and suspense not to forget the amazing computer effects.
839;i am not a big fan of Will Smith but I must admit that I see he did a great job.
840;especially for giving a light sense of humor to the movie.
841;This one covers a of of bases.
842;the plot is a great fantasy that shows great imagination on the part of the writers.
843;the special effects are really cool.
844;lastly, in spite of the fact that the story IS a fantasy, there are some great messages interwoven throughout the film.
845;i have watched it several times since I first bought it, and I have enjoyed it every time!
846;love the actors as well as the many goofy, funny, inspirational (yes there is at least one) and unforgettable lines.
847;It's eye candy and melodramatic!
848;This is the cotton candy of movies and fun to boot.
849;It is an action movie of epic proportions, filled with explosive action, and good characters.
850;I have always loved this movie and still do.
851;"Independence Day,  or ""ID4"" as it has come to be known."
852;It had everything to make it an instant hit and a classic for people to enjoy years down the road: a touching story, engaging characters, humor, lots of stars, even more explosions, and something most big blockbusters forget to include.
853;"All and all this adds up to hours and hours of ""ID4"" fun."
854;"Even though Independence day is over and done with, celebrate our freedom with the cast that's thought of every Fourth of July
855;fi fans and especially fans of Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Vivica A. Fox, Randy Quaid and Jeff Goldblum, this is a must.
856;Very exciting and amazing movie.
857;Thanks for your service will look forward doing business in the future
858;I love the 2 offsetting personalities played by Will Smith and Jeff Bloomberg.
859;I did feel that a couple of scenes were over acted, especially the part where the president gives his speech and the reaction afterwards.
860;On the other hand I loved the scenes where Will Smiths girl friend organizes a group of survivors, finds the presidents wife,who is dying and takes them basically cross country to find help.
861;Lots of good special effects.
862;Good for the whole family .
863;sometimes it is good to see a show with no.
864;just sit back and enjoy the action kind of show.
865;Good flick for those needing a ton of special effects.
866;The critics did not seem to like the film, but I enjoyed it.
867;independance day has lots of fancy visual effects, that is for sure.
868;Now Independence day is a fantastic movie that will hook you in the first minute of playing.
869;It is incredebly patriotic and moving.
870;It sets the mood perfectly and grips you the minute you hear it.
871;It is so good in fact, you might expect it to be blasted over big speakers during WWIII battles.
872;The special effects are spectacular.
873;alien fighter sequences are stunning.
874;The story is good and moving and will keep you engrossed to the very end.
875;The last hour or so are by far the best.
876;The moments when Jeff Goldbloom and Will Smith zoom up into the alien head ship is just incredible.
877;The last jet battle is incredeble and extreamly well done.
878;The music also helps a lot here, with incedibly patrisam and heroic tunes.
879;Overall this is a fantastic movie that should not be missed.
880;Disc two holds all of the extras, and this is where the disc shines through.
881;All in all, if you are a fan of the movie, just go ahead and treat yourself, you could do a lot worse.
882;budget special effects extravaganza, chock full of breathtaking pyrotechnics, thrilling dogfights, and hideous alien beings.
883;I know some people find hidden references to great movies, or find some of the lines in this movie funny.
884;Saw this movie thousands of times and this was the first time I seen it in Blue.
885;So much better than the other once.
886;This one has great characters that I love to watch over and over.
887;But, add a mix of a great cast and a great story, and you have a great movie.
888;The action sequences are superior and effectively convey a massive sense of scale.
889;It has the same intellectual value that cotton candy has nutritional.
890;It will satisfy a craving and is fun every so often, but will not fill you up or sustain your health.
891;Films such as these will have the same effect on your imagination.
892;Have fun, enjoy them when you can, but do not subsist on them.
893;Independence Day is a movie where you need to suspend your belief a bit, but it has many moments of humor and goodaction scenes.
894;The actors are more than competent.
895;i particularly liked the interplay between Judd Hirsch and Jeff Goldblum.
896;That would take away from the fun.
897;america, pulsating infectious positive vibes with its booming economy, popular President running for re.
898;election, a summer crammed with iconic, action.
899;Then, as we got closer, a new trailer synced to the theme of Crimson Tide came out, mesmerizing audiences with then revolutionary visual effects.
900;The second round of promos sold it as a Will Smith movie.
901;He's really a secondary character in a cast filled with secondary characters.
902;It's astonishing to think that his director's cut is even longer.
903;be greatness, only David Arnold's rousing score truly entertains.
904;ID4's enjoyment has long since expired.
905;the movie itself is great but the way it was advertised implies the extended edition.
906;it would've been a great movie if they really delivered the extended edition.
907;independence day is the greatest sci.
908;Sometimes it's nice just to sit down and watch a fun movie.
909;Independence Day is in my viewpoint one of Will Smith's better roles and I manly own it just for the special effects.
910;For the time frame it was release at the special effects were quite stunning.
911;I also enjoy the acting jobs of the other actors in the movie some very talented actors that have gone onto better roles in tv shows and movies.
912;But if your looking for a good science fiction movie and a fan of Will Smith movies or in general a fan of his then you will like this movie.
913;But like most people who have watched this movie you end up saying it's one of those you like it, love it, or don't.
914;But for myself I will always keep it in my collection of action movies because no matter how much time passes it still impresses me to this day and it came out in 1996.
915;I may be biased as I love the style of filmmaking from the 90s but I really enjoyed this film.
916;Plus, the flying sequences are cool.
917;The effects were probably groundbreaking back then and still hold up today, and the film looks great visually.
918;Definitely check this one out if you havent seen it already.
919;I hope Independence Day 2 gets made.
920;The actors try to do what they can but it is so incredible that they seem to be acting with a tongue, or maybe two or three tongues, in their cheeks.
921;Though in this case this campaign succeeded quite well, even if it seems to have come to an end.
922;With the talents of Will Smith, Bill Pullman, and many others, who can ask why this movie was such a big hit.
923;Brilliant special effects, an outstanding cast, Independence Day is a movie the whole family will enjoy.
924;This is a perfect example of how movies can become succesful based on their special effects alone.
925;Make no mistake, the effects are outstanding.
926;Computer imagery at its best.
927;Some of the computer generated scenes, especially the explosions and the destruction of capital cities is breathtaking.
928;I've seen better movies on Mystery Science Theatre!
929;I can put pretension and artistic concerns aside and simply enjoy a movie for sheer entertainment value.
930;Will Smith somehow knows how to pilot an alien spacecraft!
931;And his stripper girlfriend still has to go to work even though the mother ship is floating over L. a. Give the girl a break geez!
932;Reminiscent of Star Wars, especially the aerial combat scenes.
933;Great visual effects and photography, but I was not left wanting to see it again, or the upcoming sequel.
934;I know it a bit jingoistic but I mean to be, I'm proud to be a Ugly American.
935;It is one of my favorite movies!
936;the special effects and the feel good message of a united mankind make the movie a fun way to kill an evening with a group of friends.
937;You can all cheer loudly when the classic scene of the White House getting blasted shows up on screen.
938;I love this type of Action.
939;Will Smith is always a great actor, this movie is no exception.
940;Just the right mix of fun, bizarre superman/woman situations, and Hello .
941;Great movie where you just forget about life for awhile and get absorbed in big story.
942;Will Smith is a favorite!
943;Independence Day is a 4th of July classic!
944;In spite of a few obvious plot holes, we enjoy watching this movie every year.
945;It's showing its age, perhaps its the nostalgia but it was enjoyable.
946;The sound transfer is amazing.
947;My system loved this movie.
948;Macintosh, the power to save the world .
949;This is the one to show off your system to your friends and family!
950;Independence Day is one great film.
951;It's truly authentic and has more special effects than any other movie, with the exception of """"The Matrix"""" and """"Armageddon""""."""
952;The film has a superb cast, with Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Vivica A Fox, and Bill Pullman.
953;The film grossed #9 of the highest grossing movies of all.
954;With some of the greatest special effects, a great cast, and even better, refreshing storyline, this film will remain with everyone forever.
955;They do the best with what they were given.
956;I actually like a lot of big.
957;It is quite simply pure entertainment.
958;The special effects are amazing and very well conceived.
959;The cast does a fine job with the dialogue that they were given.
960;Of course even they knew that the real stars of this film were the visuals.
961;Although this is a pure theater picture the small screen is still a worth while place for ID4.
962;Man, what a fun movie.
963;There are other subtle references in the movie as well.
964;Throw in a good mix of underdog, regular Joe characters that have to come together to save humanity and you've got classic sci.
965;This is purely an American flick.
966;in short, it's classic sci.
967;There are at least 2 additional plot lines added in to the movie with the restored footage.
968;ID4 is the best movie ever (not ocunting the Star Wars saga).
969;It's a pack full of awesome special effects and the ilusions are stunningly perfect.
970;How amazing that when this movie first came out, it was the greatest special effects and the most talked about movie at the time.
971;When an idea is brought up, the world gets together and celebrates its own Independance Day.
972;A pretty decent movie and a good sci.
973;The supplimental disk has an excellent menu of the Area 51 hanger and includes 3 documentaries, and plenty of trailers.
974;It would have been nice to see some storyboards, production art, merchandise, or even some UFO stuff but it's still cool.
975;All in all it's a good set, but the Armageddon 2.
976;Has great acting and straigh faced humor and it makes it believable.
977;And your favorite part willbe the big speach that happens at the end right before they take out the aliens.
978;Loved it the first time I saw it and every time after that.
979;Lots of fun to see.
980;Exactly what I wanted and I appreciate your prompt exchange policy.
981;I really enjoyed the movie and have watched it many times.
982;It is one of our favorite Saturday night films.
983;This movie is so much fun you have to count the smiles whiles its on.
984;Sure this has more amazing coincidences than a James Bond movie.
985;i thought Jeff Goldbloom was great in this movie and if there was any doubt about Wil Smiths shotting star, this movie ended that.
986;It was a big box office hit.
987;Totally great excitment with totally 5 great stars!
988;There were craft painted onto walls by prehistoric peoples.
989;Humans are doing a magnificent job of threatening the survival of humanity, thank you very much.
990;industrial complex portrayed as our great salvation in movies like this.
991;THERE is the real shocker!
992;This was one of the largest grossing movies at the box office when it was released in theatres in 1996, and it is still fun to watch on video.
993;Other effects, such as the large alien ships and the dogfight sequences between aircraft and alien ships make this a fun movie to watch.
994;rate performances throughout the movie.
995;The special effects and the actors make this a movie worth watching several times.
996;Anyway, I think that this is a pretty good movie.
997;but it has a good story line, and it made artfully.
998;the speech about Independence Day is pretty good too.
999;I particularly liked Jeff Goldblum's character in this movie, and Goldblum himself is such a good actor.
1000;His lines and gestures are always so natural!
1001;I would recommend this to any fan of science fiction as a great addition to their home collection.
1002;it's great, One of the best movies out there.
1003;Glad I four it on Amazon for such a great price
1004;The movie trailer shows a picture of the White House.
1005;"Many people are justified in stating that the success of ""Independence Day"" comes from the fact that its nothing more than what its intended to be: FUN, period."
1006;Perhaps it symbolizes the power and determination of the human spirit to prevail against all odds.
1007;"You've got Will Smith, a fighter pilot with a mouth of a wise guy but having a heart of gold
1008;Put them together and you have a trinity (respectively the heart, mind and soul) of the ultimate good guys to rally """"mankind,"""" a word as Pullman in the film eloquently states, """"should have a new meaning to us all."""
1009;The spirit of this movie owes much to past multi.
1010;If you are an avid fan of sci.

1014;I love this movie and wanted my kids to see it since they love anything Will Smith does.
1015;They enjoyed his humor and even the serious conflict.
1016;I like the actors in it and I like the storyline.
1017;This movie is a classic and the only thing better than this movie.
1018;Granted, it doesn't have the most complex or thought out script ever made, but this movie is fun.
1019;Great to just pop in and enjoy without worring if you missed anything.
1020;Good combination of special effects and a strong cast backed up with an interesting story line.
1021;The movie is mindless fun, we all know that.
1022;Fox did a great job with this set, and the menus make you feel like you're interacting with the film itself.
1023;The second disc is chock full of behind.
1024;Action was good, the comedy was enjoyable.
1025;Good for a night on the couch.
1026;This is an awesome movie!
1027;Other scenes, everything was perfect.

1030;what follows is a pretty good Sci.
1031;fi movie with some laughs built in.
1032;The special effects are pretty good and the story line is not bad if you take out the alcoholic crop duster that can fly an F 18 Hornet with no flight training since the Vietnam War.
1033;there is a lot of action, special effects and some decent plot lines within the movie.
1034;If you just look at it as 2 hours of entertainment you will enjoy it.
1035;The collection of miscellaneous personalities overcomes a superior force and technology to win the day.
1036;It is worth watching and you will have fun enjoying it.
1037;Despite it's general outrageousness, Independence Day IS a good movie.
1038;the actors' preformances are on the whole good.
1039;"Roland Emerich delivers good material as usual (""I Robot"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"")."
1040;The extra scenes, though nothing major, are entertaining to say the least.
1041;It is mostly character development along with a couple of funny scenes.
1042;The picture is beautiful and the THX sound is what it should have been in the theatre!
1043;It is filled with lots of cool behind the scenes documentaries, including the Fox special wich aired just prior to the films release.
1044;If you are a fan of the movie, worth the upgrade.
1045;This fit the bill perfectly!
1046;He invites friends over to watch it on movie night and they all enjoy it.
1047;A great movie to watch.
1048;Will Smith's character is wonderful.
1049;The story line keeps you on the edge of your seat.
1050;I give it 1 star on special effects alone.
1051;a great inspirsational movie on the survival and spirit of the human race.
1052;I love all the talented actors and their parts in the movie of triumph over alien evil beings
1053;"honestly, Smith is the best thing about this movie

1056;Somewhere in there we get strippers, a marital reconciliation, a wedding and a computer virus, plus a lot of heartfelt moments carefully lifted from better movies.
1057;Granted, the effects are sharp and the battle scenes are truly massive.
1058;Actually, you might have more fun playing with the special features and just avoiding the movie altogether.
1059;Independence Day is a really good movie.
1060;I hate fantasy movies but this one was reall good.
1061;This is a great movie with an even greater picture.
1062;anyhoo, this was a fun film on many levels.
1063;simple but that seems to be a good thing.
1064;Will Smith played his flyboy character well"
1065;And the tarnished hero/father figure rising to the occasion was a nice touch.

1069;"So, despite its ""flaws"" I love the movie."
1070;the film does look great on Blu.
1071;I've seen this movie about 10 times and enjoy it each time.

1077;Independence Day is indeed a great thrill ride, offering at.

1079;The movie offers a number of great battle scenes between the heroes and the seemingly.

1082;star Amazon reviews of this movie.
1083;Superficially, this alien invasion movie is exciting, loud, and suspenseful, as long as you keep your brain from participating.
1084;The movie is a lot of fun if you take it for what it's worth .
1085;The sale and the receiving of the product was excellent.
1086;You're a great nation, we get it already!
1087;it's just one heck of a good time.
1088;Lighten up, appreciate it for what it is and is meant to be, and enjoy.
1089;One of the best movies ever.
1090;This film about freedom from the destruction and colonization of aliens is more fun than any movie before.
1091;Although there's probably no chance that a virus uploaded into an alien mothership would shut down its systems, this movie has plenty of epic explosions and classic science.
1092;fiction to make this a grand movie.
1093;And while I have no idea how they opened communications with the president, this film really sets a positive mood.
1094;it helps to have a great orchestral score by David Arnold, as well as great actors such as Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum and Vivica Fox.
1095;And boy, Will Smith had fun with this movie.
1096;"aliens movie, it has been one of the best science fiction films in the 90s, more fun than ""Armageddon"" or ""Godzilla""."
1097;"Probably the only film that has this much fun is Will Smith's follow up action/comedy film ""Men in Black."""
1098;The most positive aspect of the movie was the fight scenes.
1099;I have to say that the fight scenes were very well done, and I actually found them preferable to the space fights in the newer Star Wars movies which are famous for their special effects.
1100;The looting, and the congestion due to a disorderly panic induced exodus was a very believable and realistic reaction.
1101;Finally, the blasting away of those alien worshiping hippie types was a nice touch, which also added realism.
1102;the Plot:The best way I could describe the movie, is that it was like a comedy or spoof with all the humorous elements taken out.
1103;For a movie it is ideal to have about two or three main characters, plus a few ancillary characters.
1104;The only time having lots of characters works well, is when you have a TV series.
1105;A TV series offers more time to properly develop the characters and build up concern for them on the part of the viewer.
1106;What I saw in this movie was a makeshift one world government formed, and it appeared to me as though one world government was being touted as a good thing.
1107;Director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin struck gold with this action packed popcorn movie.
1108;ID4 is one of the movies that turned Will Smith into a movie star.
1109;David Arnold's ID4 music score is very loud, epic, and energetic.
1110;edited version of the film.
1111;ID4 is a popcorn movie at its best.
1112;For him it is a change from his normal space adventure.
1113;I saw this screen on Australian television 2 weeks ago and I must say it had a profound impact on me.
1114;I didn't mean to watch it, I was just flicking through the channels but I felt strangely compelled and connected to it while watching.
1115;The first time I saw this in the cinemas when it was out in that domain I got my relatives to watch with me the second time round.
1116;This is just perfect for the big screen and I hope one day it reaches cult status enough to re.
1117;It is a movie that has special effects on a grand scale.
1118;A modern day fairy tale that one days might just come true.
1119;I truly believe science fiction aka Star Wars is the best and ultimate genre and beats Lord Of The Rings and Harry Potter any day.
1120;Hence ID4 combines all the best elements of the overlapping modernity (that is SCI.
1121;anyway, this movie takes you all around the world and of course a bit of luck is what causes the good guys to win.
1122;interesting the graphics of the larger buildings being the target of the aliens.
1123;i can still remember the look on the man's face while looking up in disbelief as the alien ship over Manhattan begins to ignite the Empire State Building.
1124;This as a fascinating movie and fun for the most part.
1125;One of the best movies ever.
1126;ray makes it even better.
1127;Amazon was one of the first to sell this movie.
1128;Full of special effects, aliens, airplanes, UFOs, and big big explosions.
1129;All kinds of fun stuff!
1130;hungry aliens, the President and a group of unexpected people must help save the world.
1131;this has got to be one of the funnest movies out there.
1132;The extensive cast is full of A list actors and actresses, as well as some unknowns, and all pull through with great performances.
1133;I also enjoyed how each group of characters were given their own subplots, and those subplots were closed and didn't leave the viewers wondering how what would have happened.
1134;The special effects in ID4 were amazing.
1135;It was pretty fun to see Washington DC, Paris, and other big cities get blown to pieces.
1136;The chapter list even tells us when things are added and extended.
1137;Although there's only a 9 minute difference, it was still interesting to see it.
1138;The alternate ending is also very interesting.
1139;amentaries and news reports are fun to watch.
1140;There's plenty of stuff here to keep you busy for at least a couple of hours.
1141;independence Day is a fun action romp, and is fun every time you watch it.
1142;This is an awesome movie!
1143;There aren't many that start so exciting, finish exciting and keep it going through the middle!!
1144;The special effect are great and the acting is great.
1145;A true gem of a movie and would give it 10 stars if I could.
1146;One of my favorite movies of all time.
1147;Humor, action, character interaction, social commentary, graphics, favorite actors, political commentary, aliens.
1148;The movie is a well worth watching the cast and movie are great I enjoy watching a very good action movie.
1149;enjoy it every time i see it!
1150;It had been a long time since I'd seen it and it's still a great film!
1151;The additional footage was worth waiting for.
1152;would someone in Hollywood please actually write a somewhat logical first.
1153;This film will entertain you to death, it has the right dose of action, sf/x, and even some humor.
1154;the performances are great, will and vivica have great chemistry, and bill pullman is a very convincing president.
1155;I highly recommend this film for a rainy day.
1156;If your looking for a film to enjoy,laugh,and maybe shed a tear,Ind Day is it.
1157;a great transfer to disc,great acting,great casting,in color,and fabulous visuals effects.
1158;so grab the popcorn and enjoy.
1159;cracking heroes ( Welcome to earth! )
1160;One of the best movies Emmerich has ever made (compare it to the soggy 2012).
1161;I've always loved this movie and have had it since it was available.
1162;The shipping was great, the product in great condition and a wonderful price!
1163;The existence of life outside of our planet is an idea that has long captured the minds of many people.
1164;The thought that maybe their might be some other forms of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe is a concept that is both alluring and somewhat frightening at the same time, mostly because no one knows what the aliens (if they exist, which I don't believe they do) would be like.
1165;"terrestrial"", ""Men in Black"" (the good aliens), and even the 'Star Trek' series at times."
1166;One of the most successful entries into the alien invasion sub.
1167;Now, with the attempted annihilation of the human race in full swing, our last hope rests upon humanity's ability to work together in the face of adversity, and on a daring mission led by a cocky pilot (Will Smith).
1168;here is a movie that beyond a shadow of a doubt, absolutely lives up to the term 'summer blockbuster'.
1169;"What makes ""Independence Day"" such a great movie is not the fact that it is one of the best alien invasion movies ever made, of course that helps, but the mass appeal it has to such a wide audience."
1170;"The film contains something for everyone
1171;the acting for """"Independence Day"""" was completely solid throughout, which was a pleasant surprise given the material of the movie and the fact that some of the actors aren't exactly known for their high."""
1172;Pullman surprised me because I hadn't really seen him do a whole lot of dramatic work, which was primarily his job in this film.
1173;Surprisingly, Randy played things with just the right amount of crazy without going overboard, and he even handled the dramatic aspects of his character, that appear later into the movie, with an earnest sincerity that was refreshing to see.
1174;Probably the biggest surprise in the movie was Will Smith's performance, though he was but one part of an ensemble cast, whenever he was on screen he made the movie his own with relative ease.
1175;But once things got going, Will proved that he definitely had what it took to solidify his place among Hollywood's A. list stars, and his continuing success within the film industry is evidence of that.
1176;notch special effects work is a key component to making any good science fiction movie, if you don't get the effects right and just wow the crowd, the audiences will turn on you in an instant.
1177;The effects in this film were so top.
1178;line at the time the film was made, that most hold up very well to this day, a little over 10 years later.
1179;It's a fun movie with great explosions.
1180;very briefly, I agree with most of the other one.
1181;still, Will Smith is an amusing guy and the special effects are as good as advertised.
1182;I recommend you don't give them any more.
1183;War of the Worlds was certainly was a more suspenseful movie.
1184;for excitement and effects, this is a movie that is worth watching.
1185;If it's a good story with suspense and a little bit of intelligence that you want to see, than the original War of the Worlds is a much better choice.
1186;I think that Gene Barry is a much better actor than Will Smith is and his character was more interesting than the Will Smith character we have in this version of the film.
1187;It would be nice for Hollywood to have an ounce of creativity and originality in making movies these days, but they won't do that.
1188;The amount they spend on one explosion could certainly pay for a writer with talent and ability.
1189;coaster ride, but it's fully aware of it.
1190;The alien threat is introduced in a grand fashion and ratcheted up with an almost poetic rhythm.
1191;"basically, this is the perfect film for you if:You don't want to watch anything that engages your brain in any sense.You want to watch stuff blow up.You want to punch the air and yell, ""F*** yeah!"""
1192;this is just one of those films that you have to be in the mood for to enjoy.
1193;Thank you the great video.
1194;My Husband loves this movie and it came in time for Father's Day!
1195;President's speech reminds you it is ok to be proud to be an American.
1196;Summer blockbuster at it's best.
1197;We just got the idea that the cast and crew of this movie had a blast filming it.
1198;Will was excellent in this.
1199;The movie is all an American movie can be.
1200;I loved the serious note mixed with humor in this movie.
1201;Will Smith was at his funniest best, along with Jeff Goldblum and Harry Connick Jr.
1202;They complimented each other perfectly.
1203;This was a fun movie that took a serious storyline of Alien invasion and injected humor, fun and pure silliness into it.
1204;Happy Independence Day World !!
1205;Of course I love the movie, everytime I watch it.
1206;I would love to rate this movie 10 stars but the language is outrageous.
1207;This is my absolute favorite movie.
1208;One of the best alien movies of all time.
1209;I enjoy it every time we watch it.
1210;I personally LOVE this movie.
1211;It was made for fun!
1212;The special effects are awesome.
1213;The firestorm that occurs afterwards is also fantastic.
1214;It's a good deal for anyone who loves action and sci.
1215;Independence Day (Single Disc Widescreen Edition) (1996) was a very entertaining 4 star film.
1216;Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum are always good as were most of the well selected crew.
1217;This film featured a good story, great cast, and fine special effects.
1218;The creature design for the aliens was imaginative and very credible.
1219;They desired to, however, and were very happy with the patriotic plot and the positive light it placed the US Air Force in.
1220;Now when I watch a SD movie it looks washed out, HiDef is the only way for me, compare your old SD ID4 with the Blu Ray ID4, you will see the difference.
1221;This is one of my most favorite movies!!
1222;Will Smith was funny at times and yet still the tragic hero.
1223;Jeff Goldblum was more likeable in this movie than I have ever seen him in the past.
1224;I also thought Robert Loggia and Bill Pullman were well chosen.
1225;While the script was similar to movies done in the past, there was a new spin on it.
1226;It's a pretty doofy movie.
1227;ID4 delivers the fun.You can still get the summer blockbuster goosebumps watching it again.
1228;And a nice interface for the menus also.
1229;Independence Day could have been a great film.
1230;It's got the huge explosions that draw in big summer crowds, it's loaded with fodder for popcorn popping, but after that.
1231;It will hold your attention for the entire duration of the film.
1232;The visuals, especially the opening sequence showing you just how tiny the moon and our little neck of the universe can be, are fantastic.
1233;The special effects are top.
1234;notch and the acting is over.
1235;Now if you've read my review of Emmerich's Godzilla, you already know that I liked that movie.
1236;fi movie that's fun to watch, but just not fun enough.
1237;For a better time, Starship Troopers has explosions galore, including some cool bug guts.
1238;It has that whole end of the world thing going for it.
1239;Both of these movies don't take themselves too serously, and they are a lot more enjoyable to watch.
1240;Some films are important because they are original and imaginative.
1241;Others are important as they epitomize a culture, an era, etc.
1242;I remember Bob Dole liked this one.
1243;I like the movies he chooses to film.
1244;They have you feeling a wide range of emotions.
1245;fi and I'm not a Vivica Fox fan so I never saw this when it came out but it turned out to be quite good.
1246;One of the best moves and action.
1247;I love the cast and director.
1248;Done very well and wanted to collect this for the future.
1249;seen this movie many times and still is one of the best!
1250;It's not Shakespeare or Bruce Willis, but I find it very inspirational.
1251;often on what divides us as human beings rather than our commonalities, this movie gives me hope.
1252;It has become an Independence Day tradition for me to which I always look forward with great anticipation.
1253;The sound and picture go hand in hand.
1254;This is a very entertaining movie.
1255;Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum both do good jobs with their characters.
1256;I see this movie on all the time on television and I still stay and watch it from time to time.
1257;I love the ensuing hilarity as Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum team up to take out the mother ship, as well as the intense special effects for the aliens, the air battles, and the destruction.
1258;INDEPENDENCE DAY was one of the huge summer blockbusters of 1996.
1259;"background"" black and white alien invasion epics of the 1950s, INDEPENDENCE DAY has all the requisites: The goofy scientist who's been locked in his lab too long, the cynical government official, the smart general, the President willing to save the world by leading the good guys into battle, the cocky superheroic fighter pilot, the discredited scientist who saves the world by discovering that the aliens are fatally allergic to room freshener, the wise elder, the washed."
1260;it also has really yicky.
1261;The day is saved by Washed.
1262;You can watch this thing 500,000 times and it's still amusing, exciting, and even, cornily, moving in spots.
1263;we can assume that a few people have seen this movie and liked it.
1264;Of course Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch add to the fun.
1265;good tone that works well within the caveats of the genre.
1266;But the film gets four stars for action, visuals and some well.
1267;the SFX utilised are astounding, with some truly breathtaking visuals, and that now.
1268;famous shot of the white house getting blown to smithereens by aliens!
1269;natured, brainless fun, that while predictable and silly, is still one impressive movie that is a must.
1270;"The extras are great, with commentaries on the first disc, and on disc 2 a wealth of extras including that famous Superbowl trailer ""Enjoy the Superbowl, it may be your last"", tons of ""making of"" docos and lots more production info."
1271;Those reviewers who trash this movie have to relax and not take it so serious: it's just a movie, and first and foremost, its purpose is to entertain.
1272;"On the other hand, those reviewers who think this movie is ""awesome"" or ""the greatest movie ever made!"""
1273;But I briefly want to touch the whole plausibility of the subject of this movie.
1274;Clealry, humanity's triumph as depicted in this film and others of the genre is just not going to happen.
1275;Overall, though, movie is entertaining, and so I'll give it three stars.
1276;I could watch this movie again and again
1277;And yes, the characters could be developed a lot more.
1278;A lot of humor is embedded in not only what the characters say but also in the acting, the photography, and the plot.
1279;Some of the visual effects are pretty cool as well, but the humor is what makes me watch this movie over and over again.
1280;Good sound, generally good picture, but the film 'artifacts' (that is, the picture becomes jumbled, broken up, and stops completely) during high.
1281;We love this around the holiday and the family watches it every year.
1282;never surrender is the best way to describe Will Smith's character.
1283;"It's practically a Rocky Horror experience: we recite the script and talk back to the characters
1284;As I've said, I love ID4.
1285;directors' commentary and special effects supervisors'.
1286;The movie is as always great with the spectacular scenes only improved with 5.1 sound.
1287;This was a great, fast action film.

1291;wife is one of the president's top aides, and tells the president of his findings.
1292;He manages, however, to bring in a captive.
1293;Notwithstanding the gravity of the premise of the film, there are moments of comic relief interspersed throughout.
1294;A second counter attack is launched world wide, which leads to some terrific action scenes and heroics by a most unlikely candidate.
1295;It is not the victory itself, however, but what leads up to the victory that makes the film so entertaining.
1296;The special effects are dazzling.
1297;Will Smith is charming and funny throughout.
1298;Bill Pullam is appropriately presidential, and Jeff Goldblum is a most convincing computer geek.
1299;All in all, this is a marvelous film.
1300;It is a moment that gives the viewer pause in remembrance of what was.
1301;It is, indeed, a moment to remember.
1302;Independence Day is pretty much a perfect example of a """"Summer Blockbuster"""" done exceedingly well."""
1303;Sit back and enjoy very well done entertainment.
1304;Excellent movie with portrayl of what could happen and a compasonate president, and excellent hero will smith and jeff goldblum
1305;Anyonw who saw Men In Black and liked it is sure to love ID4.

1318;An absolute MUST HAVE if you love America and love the freedoms we enjoy compared to the other nations on the planet
1319;is one of the best sci=fi movie and fx I have ever seen.
1320;This movie has a really cool base plot, over.

1324;An amazingly simple statement by Julius suddenly triggers a brilliant thought in David, and bingo, a solution to the alien problem is created.
1325;the rest of the movie is aerial battles and a huge self.

1327;this movie is full of corn and coincidence, and yet it is darn fun to watch.
1328;This has to be one of Will Smith's best pictures ever.

1337;One interesting thing about this extra material is that I could finally find the relationship of drunken pilot Russell Casse with his son Miguel.
1338;I love this movie .
1339;It's getting a bit dated, but still lots of fun to watch.
1340;"This movie has been called ""wonderful"" and ""a great sc."
1341;"Then there's the whole thing about them just saying, ""Anyone who can fly or, heck, as even looked at a plane, come over here and we'll give you some top of the line jets to use."""
1342;Its a great movie one of the best sci.
1343;fi of it's time with a great cast all around.

1349;It's amazing how well the movie holds up even after almost 20 years after its release.
1350;total destruction of US landmarks, aliens, Air Force One, Area 51, internet technology saving the world, an unlikely hero, Will Smith, a dog, a stripper, witty dialog.
1351;I always watch this on July fourth.
1352;Was really pleased with the clarity and sound.
1353;Would recommend for the whole family.
1354;Classic move that I still enjoy watching every few year.
1355;Very happy with this 2 disc collector's edition.
1356;It's entertaining and lots of extras.
1357;Artwork on sleeve is pretty nice too.
1358;Non stop action, and good special effects.
1359;This is a good movie.

1364;jeff Goldblum is superb as the eco.

1366;Will Smith is also outstanding as the scrappy Marine pilot who never quits or freezes, and only gets more determined to shoot down the invading ETs.
1367;bill Pullman is believable as the former.
1368;Judd Hirsch is both endearing and hilarious as Goldblum's father.
1369;Although I doubt they could top this great movie!
1370;makes War of the Worlds look like an Oscar award winning movie.
1371;An Awesome Movie, Video[with a 3.
1372;This is another really great action/adventure flick about aliens coming to conquer earth starring Will smith and Bill Pullman and when it comes right down to it a pilot flys up into an alien craft with a nuculear weapon that blows them away will smith and jeff goldblum are great buddies going out to kill the hostile aliens.
1373;Sure it's a colossally stupid film, but it's entertaining in much the same way as console video games are entertaining.
1374;It is very nice to note, however, that they completely ignore Canada, and when they finally turn Washington DC, New York, LA, Moscow, etc. into craters, guess who's in charge, boys!
1375;It does entertain, has great special effects and a terrific musical score by David Arnold, so I can forgive a story that could have been written by any five year old.
1376;This movie has excellent effects, graphics, etc. with an all.
1377;star cast to make a high.
1378;Finally, science fiction the way it used to be: rousing, cosmically xenophobic and ferociously patriotic.
1379;Will Smith always makes good movies.
1380;"(Wicky) Wild Wild West and his heavily sampled music albums are just a couple of examples of his ""full sale"" entertainment career."
1381;Great movie to watch over an over again .
1382;Just a good movie to have on hand
1383;And the president's speech is still relevant.
1384;Great movie and I can turn the volume up so pups don't hear the neighbors fireworks.
1385;He loves all the apocalypse type flicks so this was right up his alley.
1386;I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.
1387;The special effects are really brought to life in the blu.
1388;Independence Day is a summer blockbuster film.
1389;this is such a fun film to watch and is for many reasons.
1390;You have to love the special effects in the film.
1391;The alien weapons are cool and a lot of the explosions are on a big scale.
1392;The movie won the Oscar for best special effects and rightfully so.
1393;His one liners and overall toughness really help make the film.
1394;They also helped make his carear and he wouldn't be where he's at today without this film.
1395;His one liners are great and you love to like his character.
1396;this is another hit movie for Roland Emmerich.
1397;This guy has taken the Steven Spielberg mold for summer blockbuster hits and has made quite a carear for himself.
1398;the music is great in Independence Day.
1399;David Arnold has written a fantastic score.
1400;It has a great patriotic feel to it.
1401;The music is well worth the price of the movie.
1402;Fans of the movie should look at the soundtrack as well.
1403;independence Day is a great film.
1404;Independence Day is a great summer blockbuster movie.
1405;It reminds us why we go to the movies and that to be entertained.
1406;Still fireball blasting in her direction had time to call her dog.
1407;(Amazing Virus compatibility) Mac is a great computer, but it's amazing just how the aliens had the same operating system as we do that we could download a virus to their computer.
1408;This movie is a blast!
1409;This movie has great special effects.
1410;Excellent story line and great new added scenes.
1411;The acting in this movie is good and the actors also did an excellent job.
1412;wifes favorite independence day movie must have
1413;It's enjoyable from start to finish.
1414;This is a cool movie.
1415;Independence Day is the best alien movie i've ever seen.
1416;Not because of all the action and explosions, it's just a great sci.
1417;jeff Goldblum, Will Smith, and Bill Pullman give it there best in this monumental achievement.
1418;Independence day is one of my favorite movies and I enjoy watching it over and over, hardly can wait for part 2 and 3
1419;This may not be the most profound movie about aliens and prospective human enslavement/extermination, but it's sure the most fun!
1420;The computer generated special effects, like those of Jurassic Park, were examples of the most impressive technological developments in cinematography in years.
1421;developed and likeable for a testosterone.
1422;It has enough love story elements to keep the soft.
1423;The most impressive part of the flick is that the whole thing could really happen.
1424;Emmerich delivers a film with good special effects and an embarrassingly vapid story.
1425;True this film had great commercial success and mass (herd) appeal, but it is best viewed in a theatre on opening day (thankfully come and gone).
1426;us theme is aptly served by its narrow, linear plot peopled with equally narrow characters played by an under utilized/over paid castID4 is a popcorn movie worth viewing once, not worth purchasing until it hits the bargain bins.
1427;For special effects see The Matrix.
1428;Now that I have it, I can watch it whenever I want.
1429;also, I am a Will Smith fan.
1430;This movie launched Will Smith's career.
1431;This movie was also funny, sad, and happy all together.
1432;This is a classic movie with aliens who want to take over the world, and the humans have to come up with something to stop them.
1433;The computer special effects for this movie are rather impressive, with a solid storyline and acting.
1434;Armageddon is one of my favourite movies, and I can see a lot of similarities between that Independence Day.
1435;i was shocked to read that this was the biggest box office success of 1996 .
1436;I saw Titanic twice at the cinema, and watched the video about a zillion more times.
1437;Some great actors appear in this film .
1438;this must have been great to see at the cinema.
1439;I enjoyed this movie a great deal and will continue watching it over and over!
1440;This was a very entertaining movie.
1441;You have an outstanding hero model with Will Smith.
1442;This role made me a Will Smith fan.
1443;The special effects that are used in this movie are also great.
1444;thereis also a good rescue of planet earth by Will Smith.
1445;It is well worth your viewing time.
1446;Well done action movie, entertainment at it's best.
1447;The movie has everything that a movie of this type should have: action, humor, good acting, a decent plot, and .
1448;This is a classic movie however putting it on blu.
1449;It's just as good on VHS as it is on blu.
1450;Watching skyscrapers being destoryed now, has a bit more resonance and less entertainment value.
1451;To Bill Pullman's to good to be true President.
1452;This is the perfect summer movie.
1453;It's got humor, heart and great special effects.
1454;, and even though the two movies are about as far apart as possible, both kept our evening guests riveted.
1455;Give your brain a rest, and enjoy yourself.
1456;This one has it all.
1457;I am a big fan of this kind of movie.
1458;it was a thrill ride for me from start to finish.
1459;roland Emmerich is a fine director who brought us GODZILLA and THE PATRIOT.
1460;with a steller cast,award winning special effects,this film is a must have,and a must see family favorite for many years to come.
1461;i highly recommend it along with other sci.
1462;While there may be a plot hole here and there, this is an enjoyable film that will not leave you hanging at the end.
1463;A worthy addition for the discriminating sci.
1464;On the one disc you can have either the orginial theatrical version or the special edition with the added footage.
1465;The sound and picture was excellent.
1466;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
1467;I think the acting is excepional, and the special effects are spectacular.
1468;Can you please tell me what the name of the movie is?
1469;well I wont touch much on that one since that is subject to opinon.
1470;all Ill say is watch it again.
1471;and Jeff Being a 8 year MIT Grad probably has a good understanding of reading binary.
1472;what, you want them to show you how they make it so you know it works and then you can say this is a beliveable movie?
1473;but all that is to just make the movie more fun.
1474;There is action, drama, romance, special effects, fear, excitement and more all wrapped into this gem of a movie.
1475;Bill Pullman is a refreshing politician, and the romance between Jeff Goldblum and his ex.
1476;wife (in the movie) is great.
1477;I admit that there are one or two corny lines, but they are overpowered by all the greatness this movie has to offer.
1478;That was the extra footage.
1479;It was neat to see about 9 minutes of extra pieces that were not in the original movie.
1480;This was sent in great condition just as promised and very quick on time as promised.
1481;I have yet to receive the movie I ordered last Wednesday even tho I'm a prime member and was suppose to receive it by Friday
1482;Great movie and pretty awesome plot aliens who would have thought
1483;But this time it's Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman, along with a great supporting cast, terrific special effects and very moving music.
1484;so, take a chance and give it a view.
1485;On everything else (background music for example), LF comes rich and vibrant, and the opening THX effect made my house tremble.
1486;And at that i feel it excels greatly.
1487;It is full of great special effects and some nice action sequences and of course really big explosions.
1488;I feel that when you watch a movie you have to put it in its genre and rate it accordingly.
1489;Independence Day is about as mindless an entertainment as you can get, but it IS entertainment, and it works beautifully on that level.
1490;Things get blowed up real good indeed.
1491;so good, in fact, that the movie loses a LOT of steam after things stop getting blowed up.
1492;still, Independence Day is a lot of fun, and features some funny performances (especially Will Smith, who actually trash.
1493;but the point of this movie IS watching things get blowed up real good.
1494;"Everybody likes to watch a train wreck
1495;Back on Earth, the TV picture is fuzzy.
1496;independence Day was intended as a throwback to the alien and monster pictures of the 50s as well as an homage to some great sci.
1497;As the cast of characters romp from one implausible situation to another, it all works because the movie is inspired fun.
1498;speaking of inspired, there's some good casting here.
1499;Like Stargate before it, this movie brings together a lot of disparate elements that you wouldn't expect to find in one film.
1500;Really though, this is a great movie.
1501;The plot is there, the cast is strong, and it is really interesting.
1502;It is very cool throughout, and """"in your face""""."""
1503;Honestly folks, this is one of the best Sci.
1504;This movie is so cool.
1505;I loved the part when the aliens blew up all of those major cities.
1506;I also liked how the movie got started quickly unlike movies such as It came from Beneath the Sea.
1507;I watched it 12 times and never even began to make sense of what was going on But people like to say it was a great movie to make themselves look smart.
1508;Still watch this movie from time to time.
1509;I know now this doesn't hold the same respect it did in the mid 90s, but I remember when this came out, it was the best movie ever made.
1510;"I have always loved this movie and I watch it anytime I find it on TV
1511;Terrific movie, although its a little dated.
1512;Always enjoy the whole alien vs human thing.
1513;Aside from that, portions of the movie are humorous and there is even some good cinematography in certain places.
1514;I love the actors, especially Will Smith.
1515;They all do a great job.
1516;I'm delighted to have my own copy
1517;Independence Day (1996) is a great film.
1518;The movie was well done, good computer animation for special effects like the explosions and alien spaceships, great action, and an all star cast, like Bill Pullman, Will Smith, and other actors.
1519;Bond composer David Arnold also gave a great music score that went along with the film.
1520;Well done, a recommended movie!
1521;Great fun and I play it every July 4th.
1522;sparce dogfighting footage still looks top.
1523;notch, and the alien vessels still seem extremely impressive.
1524;there's an alternative ending, one which makes you glad that they ditched it, some extra 'special edition' sequences, two 'Making of' documentaries, an amusing 'Blair Witch' / Orson Welles.
1525;As pure escapist fun it's the top of its range.
1526;The premise is childishly simple: have a group of alien ships hover over the world's great cities and watch how the humans react.
1527;Smith especially shows his star potential, and can obviously carry a movie by himself.
1528;The special effects are mind.
1529;cheek and this is a cut above most blockbusters.
1530;I am, and always will be, a fan of this old movie.
1531;It's nice that I can watch in the original form or the remastered version with 9 extra minutes.
1532;I'm not usually one for action and too much excitement but this movie was exciting and funny and had a great message to it.
1533;I loved the movie and I think you probably will too.
1534;where?We should be able to watch a film and accept it for what it is .
1535;the start of the film is promising and from the word go the special effects are awesome and at times breathtaking.
1536;Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith carry the movie, along with the special effects.
1537;One of my favorite Will Smith movies.
1538;Goldblum did a damn good job i think he made the movie as his character was the best.
1539;Independence Day is still a fun movie to watch, despite its obivous techilogical flaws.
1540;The movie plays great without any issues and has a few additional features.
1541;My kids loved the movie.
1542;They thought it was funny, scary and exciting.
1543;This is one of those movies you go and see on a hot summer afternoon.
1544;The special effects of this movie are spectacular.
1545;A new ending is included on the bonus disk, I won't ruin it for you, but it is great.
1546;The behind the scenes stuff is good too.
1547;shot pilot, and Bill Pullman, yes the guy from Spaceballs, pulls off being the President.
1548;Get that movie and watch them right after another.
1549;Love the Presidents speech ~ he was powerful and to the point!
1550;Very good movie with lots of good actors!!
1551;I would recommend this to family and friends!
1552;This movie has some of my favorite actors and not to mention all the wonderful special effect.
1553;The whole family enjoyed watching it together.
1554;Independence Day is a comic book movie and is best enjoyed watching it with that mind set.
1555;ray version of this movie is amazing although I was disappointed to see a black dot artifact hanging around on the upper left portion of the screen during the opening and for the first several minutes of the movie.
1556;but overall, it is a good transfer and the sound is incredible.
1557;ID4 is one of those movies you have to see in THX at the biggest theater in town.
1558;I loved it so much I went downtown to the rat infested Dolby stereo theater and it stunk (not just the seats).
1559;, but it is pure magic in the theater.
1560;This movie is my favorite sci.
1561;There is absolutely nothing negative to be said about this movie.
1562;This is easily one of Will Smith's best and funniest roles in my opinion.
1563;Jeff Goldblum shines with his dry, sarcastic wit.
1564;Randy Quaid is priceless and hilarious as a drunken crop duster who believes he was previously abducted by aliens.
1565;I have seen this movie off and on many times in the past 18 years, and it still makes me laugh every time.
1566;its better the the theater plays great and i watch it alot and got it at a great price and got it fast
1567;fi and was very excited when I heard about this movie coming out.
1568;I loved the trailers and told all my friends about it.
1569;amazing they managed to develop the technology for interstellar travel!
1570;So give us all a break!
1571;Yes, the United States is made to look like the world savior, but how far is that really from the truth?
1572;Yes it is a feel good about being American movie and so it should be we were riding the high from our victory in the Persian Gulf and a resurgence of patriotism and this movie capitolized on this in spades it was meant to make you want to stand up and sing proud to be an American at the end of the movie.
1573;All in all its a decent movie with some good humour and great special effects and the video transfer onto digital is superbly done, the sound in 5.1 will give a great workout to all our expensive surround systems and isnt that what they are bought for.
1574;bought this as a gift for my father it was a good price and came with an instant video version of the movie which we didn't use but if we wanted to watch it sooner than the delivery then it would have been useful.
1575;decent, heavily overhyped B. movie.
1576;This film, IMHO, launched Will Smith as an international action star.
1577;but in this case its a formula that actually works.
1578;This story takes a simple what.
1579;Anyone at any time can become a hero and can become your brother.
1580;Good script, descend acting and one heck of a feel good movie.
1581;Always a great movie to watch over and over.
1582;Very well done characters are the type you cheer for.
1583;Special effects are very good, but, as most others have said, don't look too deeply beyond them for a substantial script.
1584;Just watch and enjoy without thinking too much.
1585;Yes, the movie is not very well written, and the acting is just terrible (I can't believe Will Smith got an acting career from this) but it is harmless fun.
1586;It's an action blockbuster in its purest form.
1587;This is one of my absolute favorite movies.
1588;Like that of a B. grade movie.
1589;I think this is one of the best films i have ever seen!
1590;I hope they make the sequel to this!
1591;the theme of aliens conquering Earth and after initial success receive a good kick in the a. from humans is eternal and it raises our self.
1592;One of my friends, an American, said: When watching this movie, during first hour I was proud that I'm American, after it finished .
1593;Even so, there are some interesting and appealing parts of this movie.
1594;Many scenes and subplots are entirely unforgettable and the acting for many of the parts is sub.
1595;par, however this film works because it appeals to most people on a gut level.
1596;jeff Goldblum does a good job as the """"cable repair guy"""" who saves the day through learning the aliens code and finding a way to use their code against them."""
1597;Bill Pullman as the President is good in some scenes and not so good in others.
1598;Certainly not an oscar worthy performance.
1599;i welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.
1600;did the fresh prince really get into a spaceship.
1601;proud to be an American!
1602;"We celebrate
1603;What is really celebrated is : .
1604;Worth watching once for the novelty only.
1605;This is a great film until you get to the part where Will Smith punches the alien and says """"Welcome to Earth""""."""
1606;"Will Smith is excellent
1607;This is an action pack and well down movie.
1608;All the actors were well cast, as well as being well produced.
1609;It is well worth getting.
1610;The movie was fun and entertaining"
1611;A good movie has the ability to draw the person into the action just like a good book.
1612;This movie is exciting, scary, fun and campy all rolled into one, with some great one.
1613;Plus it's full of wonderful actors.
1614;fi and Disaster film buffs, this is a must see.
1615;Best movie from Will Smith
1616;The director created the quintessential blow up movie!
1617;amazon does a great job
1618;Will Smith, Bill perfect hair Pullman at their finest.
1619;Independence Day is perhaps, one of the greatest films I've ever seen.
1620;I can't understand why it has had bad reviews, Centropolis Entertainment put a lot of hard work and effort into this film, the script was excellent, the special effects were fantastic and I must add that Randy Quaid's performance as Russel Casse was the most touching character of all of the film.
1621;Another favourite of mine from ID4 was the masterpiece patriotic score by David Arnold.
1622;Roland Emmerich's directing for ID4 was brilliant, as was the the production design by Patrick Tatopoulos and Oliver Scholl.
1623;I could go on forever saying good about this film, but all in all, it deserves an excellent 5 stars.
1624;Great Movie and special effects it makes you wonder what would really happen if we were invaded would we win?
1625;was a special gift for a friend who loves this movie more than anything.
1626;He was thrilled to have this special version and has watched it umpteen times!
1627;The cast if top notch and the special effects are wonderful.
1628;Of course, it's pure escapist so it should be judged on just what is presented to you.
1629;How this movie merited a special edition is beyond my understanding.
1630;Watch it and judge it by yourself.
1631;I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes good science fiction movies.
1632;The movie was great, and the acting was great.
1633;I loved the aliens, their planes, and all the action.
1634;We have enjoyed watching this movie more than once.
1635;And, we will enjoy watching it again.
1636;For us it has a 'patriotic' feel to it and we like it very much.
1637;I know this movie has gotten mixed reviews, but it is worth watching.
1638;I've seen it many times, every time it's on cable, I always find myself watching it again.
1639;but, well, I'd have to see it for myself.
1640;fi, adventure, comedy, so with all these genres mixed in, it's fun to watch.
1641;as far as the characters, if you liked Will Smith in Men in Black, you'll certainly like him here.
1642;You'll get a good laugh either way.
1643;Jeff Goldblum is pleasing as the genius cable guy who happens to crack the code that no one else noticed.
1644;Goldblum's character's Jewish dad, played by Judd Hirsch, is likable with his memorable wisecracks.
1645;overall, it's not the best movie in the world, but it is entertaining and has many good moments.
1646;And of course, some of the special effects are really cool.
1647;It is also safe enough for a family, esp.
1648;Mary Whitmore plays the first lady and is very beautiful too.
1649;the White House sure gets blown up.
1650;ID4 was a great movie.
1651;It was well written and well directed.
1652;is the beautifully BALANCED action sequences and special effects.
1653;The 5.1 Surround is so pure and extremely exciting.
1654;ID4 is a great flick, always fun to watch .
1655;"This movie is TRULY one of the best and names itself the Science Fiction version of ""Top Gun""."
1656;"Will Smith got ""jiggy with it"" as a hotshot F/A.18 pilot in the movie
1657;But the film comes into its best moments when the action sequences hit the screen.
1658;Buildings explode and men die in beautifully choreographed fashions that raise the bar for many modern action films today.
1659;The sound is also wonderful.
1660;Regardless, it's amusing and impressive in parts and is a good """"popcorn movie"""" that offers 2 1/2 hours of mostly mindless entertainment."""
1661;This is true, and normally this would upset me.
1662;ride of a movie that's just perfect if you just want to sit back and be entertained.
1663;, but it's still fun, and has a sprawling, epic feel that's very rare in todays movies.
1664;You've gotta admit, if nothing else it's still much better than the creative teams later god.
1665;"You get the feeling a ""Airplane!"
1666;Now that's a close encounter!
1667;"Another fun sequence is at ""Area 51"", where the President encounters a humanoid still hanging out after about 45 years
1668;comic expositions really work"
1669;And you will be launching the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind.
1670;Perhaps it's fate that today is the Fourth of July, and you will once again be fighting for our freedom.
1671;We are fighting for our right to live.
1672;"Today we celebrate our Independence Day!"""
1673;[crowd cheers]Probably my favorite speech in American History.
1674;This movie is an absolute gem.
1675;Great movie in the theather and still a great movie in this format really happy that it was finally released on blu.
1676;talks about coming together against tremendous odds and not giving up.
1677;Thinking things thru and coming up with a probable solution.
1678;This edition has a seperate edition in it that has extra footage/scenes.
1679;this is far from being a favorite of mine it still has its' moments.
1680;I've bought it, the sound and picture (still today) is very good indeed, and the effects .
1681;There are plenty of those.
1682;patriotism, well as mentioned .
1683;Independence day has its' moments and highlights, and some remembarable scenes.
1684;"Because despite the critics, ""I. d"" was a big hit when it came ."
1685;fi/alien movies, but I think it does a great job of entertaining, and I have watched it many times.
1686;what I liked about the movie the first time and on each successive viewing, were the great special effects (I cannot understand the reviewers who found them to be deficient) and the way that humor is used throughout the movie.
1687;I also enjoyed the subplots and the fact that the characters are developed enough to be individuals, not just a group of anonymous Earthlings.
1688;jeff Goldblum and Will Smith are great together, and seem to be enjoying themselves.
1689;The other actors are good in their roles, too.
1690;The movie sets out to accomplish a few basic goals, the primary one being to entertain the viewer, and on that level, it succeeds as well as any other recent film of its type.
1691;"My first thought was, ""wow what a good movie!"""
1692;All the explosion and the excitement makes this movie even more captivating.
1693;There was a lot of potentials.
1694;I wouldn't say this is the best Will Smith film, but it's a fun film to check out.
1695;Here, he is a wise.
1696;Bill Pullman is probably best known for being Meg Ryan's dull, dependable fiance in 'sleepless in seattle'.
1697;hand characterisation was so that they could really try and strech our imaginations, great.
1698;I will confess to being almost impressed in the first half hour, with the actual arrival of the alien ships, visually it was impressive.
1699;It is really just another summer blockbuster.
1700;Let's be honest, they never amount to much anyway.
1701;throw in the humor of the supporting actors like Randy Q and others.
1702;it is a feel good movie that doesn't pant us as the bad guy's.
1703;lots of joyful explosions, jingoism and rallying around the warrior president.
1704;"this quote from ""Patriotism"" by Emma Goldman is dedicated to Will Smith, who in the movie is a pilot who is driving the new jet."
1705;The powers that have for centuries been engaged in enslaving the masses have made a thorough study of their psychology.
1706;And the more gorgeously the toy is dressed, the louder the colors, the more it will appeal to the million.
1707;an army and navy represent the people's toys.
1708;this will be the demo disk for every video story in the country and with good reason.
1709;Perhaps they sweetened it up a bit for the release.
1710;the 5.1 was so good that at times I thought there were people talking behind me.
1711;The dynamic range was outstanding and the special effects?
1712;Some helped and some deserved to be cut.
1713;a few hours of great entertainment in an impeccable package.
1714;I love the movie and I have been waiting to own it!
1715;As a SyFy fan this is one of my favorites in the younger offers.
1716;So much going on and so well done.
1717;The acting is superb and Will Smith just as in I Am Legend and I Robot is superb in his roll.
1718;Good to catch a few cameo performances as well.
1719;Just so enjoyable I've watched it at least 8 times.
1720;In honor of today being 4th of July, I thought I'd write this review!
1721;On July 4th, the humans take a stand and fight back for their freedom.
1722;This is my favorite movie since I was 9.
1723;I love this movie for its special effects and cool dialogue.
1724;The best part is the way the movie's score and action parts intermix.
1725;I used to work on an National laboratory and the movie show how things are done in real life.
1726;disc set from Fox, the first disc contains the feature.
1727;Great picture and an excellent new Dolby 5.1 mix are just the beginning.
1728;The movie also has two audio commentary tracks.
1729;One from director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin, and another from Oscar.
1730;winning special effects supervisors Volker Engel and Doug Smith.
1731;minute documentary on making ID4, the second is a 22.
1732;minute mockumentary that is quite entertaining, and the third is the 30.
1733;The disc also has the original ending to the movie(thank God they didn't stay with it), Storyboards, artwork, and production stills.
1734;I saw it in the theater when it first came out and it had me cheering for the good old U. s. a Great affects, great acting, and has a few funny scenes in it.
1735;A must see for those who enjoy this type of movie.
1736;I was so happy when I frist got it.
1737;This is a wonderful movie and I'm not selling it or trading it for anything else!
1738;I will keep it and I will treasure it for life!
1739;This one makes all the inhabitants of Earth see a very real possibility.
1740;The endingis an exciting stretch of posibilities.
1741;I remember seeing this and really being wrapped up in it up until after the end of the countdown (when the extermination began).
1742;A fun initial hour, a yawner thereafter.
1743;Good effects though and some nice performances from some of my favorite actors.
1744;One of the best movies made.
1745;Will Smith does a great job once again.
1746;Independence Day is by far the best Sci.
1747;The director did an excellent job of keeping your interest and moving the movie along at a good pace.
1748;I would recommend this movie to all fans of movies in general, not just the sci fi crowd.
1749;This is a must see.
1750;This movie is so well made.
1751;modern and sort of new (only been around a decade or so), this brings together a good mix of using scale models and CGI.
1752;I love watching this movie at least once a year (especially with a big screen and surround sound).
1753;fi adventure thriller with a touch of comic relief.
1754;Fans of Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith will enjoy this galactic romp.
1755;I believe this of our young men and women in our Armed Forces today.
1756;I know that a lot of people like more adventure and cut 'em up, blood and guts, but this is as far as I like it.
1757;the movie came faster then i was told and that was great popped it in the blu.
1758;The picture is quite nice.
1759;This is a popcorn movie if there ever was one.
1760;You will enjoy watching it, and it certainly won't tax your intelligence.
1761;This is not the best action film and certainly not the best science fiction, but you have a big cast, big explosions and a really cool story.
1762;So, the entire message of the film is unity amoung us, as humans.
1763;An HBO special I think, hosted by Jeff Goldblum the star of the film, Inside ID4, very extensive footage on the making of the buildings, such as the White House, New York buildings and the aliens, that was a really great segment.
1764;Even if you do not like the movie, the time and effort put into the second disc is just worth it right there.
1765;A truly representive film of how the people of the world may react when facing a comon enemy.
1766;I saw this movie in the theater originally and had a decent memory of it.
1767;It was a fun summer movie and the special effects were great.
1768;the special effects are still decent, but can't really compare with what they do nowadays.
1769;well casted, well scripted, well acted, and well produced.
1770;Any way this movie is great i recommend it!
1771;It is just a something to do on a week.
1772;Great pic to watch on the 4th of July!
1773;Exciting and well acted film.
1774;Love the humor and the special effects for the film.
1775;some of my favorite actors also made this film a keeper!
1776;"ray actually ""jitters"" up and down."
1777;I have another 20th Century Fox movie that does this during the opening Fox fanfare (Ice Age), but the movie itself is perfectly fine since each frame there is computer animated.
1778;I thought that this was a very enjoyable movie.
1779;It's one of those movies that you watch again and again because there are several moments that are just unforgettable.
1780;notch, especially in the early parts of the film, as we see city.
1781;I agree with those who maintain that the plot is paper.
1782;But, if you can suspend your disbelief successfully for a couple of hours, this movie is a lot of fun to watch.
1783;the cast is pretty good.
1784;Will Smith shines as the gung.
1785;Jeff Goldblum is also great as David Levinson, the computer geek who just happens to be the ex.
1786;The underrated Robert Loggia is the Chairman of the JCS.
1787;to me, the best parts of the film are all the sly in.
1788;"(3) ""Good Morning, Dave"" ."
1789;If you can just relax and enjoy it for a couple of hours, you will love this film.
1790;This movie will be considered a classic 1960's style sci fi flick forever.
1791;Great movie for the holiday weekend!!
1792;I think that this movie will achieve a cult classic.
1793;great film, great acting,nasty aliens that are trying to take our resources away, makes this an awesome movie!I highly recommend this movie to everyone!!!
1794;I really enjoyed this movie.
1795;liked Will Smith min fact all the actors were great.
1796;I llikes the story line.
1797;the most amazing thing for me was the strange parallelLets's see we have a young president with a can.
1798;do attitude He has a cute daughter.
1799;Now, push enter and a disc will slide into the computer, and a secret code will apear.
1800;The movie started off with state of the art special effects and high suspense.
1801;In a movie with so much build up in the beginning, I like to see a more intelligent and well thought out conclusion.
1802;Mainstream America will enjoy this film.
1803;The acting ranges from good to Good God!
1804;It is big, loud, flashy and designed to appeal to the part of our brains that love Big Macs and ice cream.
1805;It hits you right in the face from the first minuet and never slows down.
1806;when I saw the trailers for this movie, I thought this was going to be one of those great movies that really caused the viewer to pause and consider the possibility that alien invasion really could occur.
1807;"This movie could have been an epic masterpiece, but the producers decided to go with the ""Hollywood formula"" and ended up creating a typical, predictable yawnfest."
1808;Excellent Movie and very good to watch for everyone.
1809;Thanks great movie to watch
1810;Additionally the invaders from both movies even use a force field to protect their fighting craft.
1811;the casting director did a grand job of picking the players.
1812;All in all performances were quite good.
1813;This was complemented by David Arnolds stirring music.
1814;It's a great popcorn flick to while away (and waste two hours).
1815;it was delivered as promised and came very well protected in its packaging.
1816;"I love this movie
1817;I received this product faster than I had expected in excellent condition.
1818;I watched Independence Day the other day for the first time in years, and finally noticed that the invading aliens were a metaphor for mankind despoiling and stripping the earth.
1819;Jeff Goldblum's scientist character is one of those nags constantly pestering people to pick up their pop cans and rattling on about saving the earth.
1820;Now this makes a lot of sense.
1821;Facing certain defeat and extinction of humanity, and knowing exactly what the invaders have in mind (remember the mind meld?)
1822;art special effects (in its day), solid acting, humor, and action.
1823;An entertaining movie with a few serious brain.
1824;rays are annihilated by swarms of enemy fighters that fly in huge, insect.
1825;But one man has the brainstorm that may save the world.
1826;ID4 combined the right mix of FX, can.
1827;Will Smith is the Marine who flies his F.18 like something out of Star Wars, and comes up with some of the flick's best lines and most of its sheer gusto.
1828;wHY THIS MOVIE ROCKS (ANYWAY): The flick's imperfect FX are still spectacular and remain so nearly a (Star Wars.
1829;But above all, ID4 excels because its makers took an idea that was never really original but also took the bold step of handling it all .
1830;militant, locust like aliens, epic.
1831;scale dogfights, huge motherships, impenetrable force.
1832;That they were able to finance and create it in the first place amazes me, and the reception at the box office undermines my faith in the American public to a great degree.
1833;Always a good one to watch, great actors, storyline.
1834;If I remember right, this was one of the first extra long sci.
1835;It's still one of the better movies, mainly due to Will Smith's light.
1836;footed character that made it worth watching again.
1837;like but they speak creditable English with a good accent.
1838;Independence day is a great movie with will smith, jeff goldblum and Bill Pullman.
1839;There are so many special features and an hours worth of hidden features.
1840;i recommend this movie to ages 13 up.
1841;This is one of my favorite movies, so when we bought a Blu.
1842;Great movie, great price, great service and shipping from Amazon.
1843;I am not one for special effects, mostly a good story written by great writers and acted by great actors.
1844;My favorite scene is at the end where a certain unexpected person saves the day.
1845;It brings me to tears, it's that touching!
1846;it is indeed a film of pure pluesur to all sceinse fiction lovers.
1847;I love Will Smith as an actor as well as his son.
1848;Action packed all the way!
1849;This is a good movie.
1850;excellent movie and played well on my tv.
1851;This is one of those movies that we watch over and over again.
1852;I found Independence Day to be a fun, visually exciting experience.
1853;This is hands down one of the best Blu.
1854;ray transfers I have seen so far.
1855;The video is crisp and clean with no visible artifacting.
1856;The audio is clear and defined with super nice bass.
1857;It was a pleasure to watch this movie again.
1858;It's a wonderful, imaginative, intense, movie experience filled with humor, tears, Action, Explosions, sci.
1859;packed movies, then you will like this movie.
1860;Independently Exciting Sci Fi!Director Roland Emmerich, who has pumped out exciting sci.
1861;it's quite the action fest.
1862;dozen times, you know what's going to happen, but when you watch it that sixth time, you are interested to see how well you remember it.
1863;And you get to enjoy the parts you liked before, again.
1864;Welcome to Earth indeed!It's an entertaining flick that is enjoyable time and again.
1865;kilter bumbling genius schtick again, and really well.
1866;Will Smith is a winning personality, though you wonder how his ego would fare in the modern military.
1867;I thought the movies was very good.
1868;The effects were good and the story too.
1869;ray looked good and sounded good also.
1870;It was worth the price.
1871;One of the best movies ever just got better on Blu.
1872;The picture is crisper and the sound is awesome
1873;this could have been one of the best sci.
1874;fi movies ever if they would have deleted every scene with will smith and randy quade.
1875;the story is good and it has stellar special effects.
1876;the movie actually does a good job portraying the helplessness of trying to defeat a vastly superior foe.
1877;good triumph of good over evil (Star Wars made us all cheer) of the 70's, gave way to the explosions for the short attention span audiences at the close of the 20th Century.
1878;I love this movie since the very first time I watched it to the 10th time an amazing movie nothing else like it a must watch
1879;Story of love, honor, and salvation.
1880;This is a really good family movie.
1881;Now the country faces many conflicts this movie still has the strong theme of not giving up even when all seems impossible.
1882;This movie plays just as stated: widescreen, with English subtitles, great picture and color!!
1883;Director Roland Emmerich was the first filmmaker to make a movie that completely pulls the wool over the audiences eyes and then cheats them out of over $300 million dollars in ticket sales without providing them with a well written, well acted or even entertaining film.
1884;the first trick to making the viewer believe they are watching a good film is loading the film with special effects, especially CGI.
1885;According to this film about an invasion of EARTH only AMERICA can save the world from these evil aliens.
1886;In the end Will Smith And Jeff Goldblum even get to shake the Presidents hand on a job well done.
1887;ID$ blitzed moviegoers viewers with those stunning visuals of explosions, and patriotism for several months before the release.
1888;Because of the hype most viewers thought since the CGI effects were good the film must be good.
1889;Thanks for destroying the creativity of the American cinema.
1890;The movie has great special effects.
1891;Can't beat the team of Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum and boy do they look amazing in blu ray.
1892;It has action, adventure, humor, a good plot, science fiction, and a wonderful ending.
1893;Simply put, it is an entertaining movie to watch for its special effects, its comic relief and enjoyable storyline fantasy.
1894;for the year, good effects, story line.
1895;Loved watching it again but this time with my granddaughter who was born 3 years after this was first shown.
1896;She is 13 now and loved it too.
1897;One of the very best alien sci.
1898;The performances by the outstanding cast and the special effects make this one of my favorite sci.
1899;It is highly interspersed with comic relief efforts by several fine actors, and with the exception of perhaps one scene in a stripper bar (no.
1900;this movie has always been a great favorite of mine and my family's.
1901;ray adds to the enjoyment of watching it again.
1902;In my mind, Independence Day was very good.
1903;The story is about aliens invading our sordid planet but the director has a deeper meaning in store for us in this classic film.
1904;His speech of world unity in the face of catastrophic crisis is an inspiration for world peace.
1905;The film """"Deep Impact (Special Collector's Edition)"""" also gives the audience a similar view."""
1906;lastly, the comic element of this film brings about a sense of comedy in this 'serious' message the film is trying to convey to the viewers.
1907;Will Smith's acting is superb as usual and I would definitely recommend this film to UFO fans and fans of Will Smith.
1908;wife is one of the president's top aides.
1909;Naturally, mankind is victorious on July 4th giving Independence Day a new meaning.
1910;this is a fast paced film, with a cast that is not only well kow but also talented and they work wonders together.
1911;This is one of my favorite movies, and Blu.
1912;ray just makes it look even more incredible!
1913;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
1914;I think the acting is excepional, and the special effects are spectacular.
1915;Can you please tell me what the name of the movie is?
1916;well I wont touch much on that one since that is subject to opinon.
1917;all Ill say is watch it again.
1918;and Jeff Being a 8 year MIT Grad probably has a good understanding of reading binary.
1919;what, you want them to show you how they make it so you know it works and then you can say this is a beliveable movie?
1920;but all that is to just make the movie more fun.
1921;just a Kick A$$ joy ride!
1922;enjoy it for what it is and don't cut it down for something that it isn't even trying to be.
1923;in that respect this is a much better movie than 'War of the Worlds' where Spielberg tries to avoid the genre cliches.
1924;The original craft was 1/4 the size of our moon.
1925;Somehow these aliens have developed warp speed technology and yet Jeff Goldblum can disable their defenses with a simple computer virus so earthlings can win the day and return to bureaucratic corruption as usual.
1926;Hollywood movies go, this one leaves no cliches unturned and if you can go with it will make you feel good.
1927;I remember watching this film the weekend it came out.
1928;The film blew me away with its special effects.
1929;It's still entertaining enough to recommend.
1930;minute special effects feature the commentary by the director producer.
1931;I've seen many of the movies in this series and I loved them, but this one doesn't have the silhouettes of the guy and his two robots at the bottom of the screen, supplying most of the dialogue.
1932;this movie, especially the extended version was even more fantastic than the original!
1933;everyone around the world bands together to save the world and celebrate an international version of the most important american holiday independence day !
1934;fi film well done, roland emerich!
1935;ID4 is one of the best alien thrillers in a while.
1936;Will Smith's performance is great and full of humor.
1937;He is, of course, the best actor in the film.
1938;Jeff Goldblum's prformance is wonderful too.
1939;His speech to the fighter pilots is unbelievable and unforgettable.
1940;The scene is moving and makes you feel like you could do anything.You will not be dissapointed!PS: Watch the skies!
1941;I've always loved alien invasion stories, and Independence Day is the best I've ever seen!
1942;"From the first scene to the last, this alien invasion story is a veritable feast for the senses, with flying saucers, ""kewl"" explosions, and aliens that make even the classic movies' aliens look like pussycats by comparison."
1943;what makes Independence Day so wonderful for me is the fact that there is also a genuine story to it that gives it dimension and depth.
1944;It tells the tale of President Thomas Whitmore (the always charming Bill Pullman), a man who is suddenly forced to confront something he'd always thought was a figment of science fiction writers' imaginations.
1945;One of my favorite movies.
1946;This is a truly worth.your.
1947;What's really great about this is they list what new scenes have been included and some of them are really funny and some of them make the story a lot more heartfelt.
1948;Also included is a second disc that includes a really cool mockumentary called The ID4 Invasion which is truly a priceless gem in this great collection.
1949;When I first found it, this was a wonderful video, and took me back to watching it on the big screen when it was first released.
1950;Later, I ran across the Limited Edition of Independence Day and I must say the restored nine minutes of original footage made the film much more enjoyable.
1951;This is the perfect summer movie, with a lot of great moments in it.
1952;Will Smith is tons of fun in this movie along with Jeff Goldblum.
1953;The movie isn't art or literature, but it's a fun ride.
1954;All in all this film can be enjoyed if you don't expect too much from it.
1955;The movie also has a few famous buldings/landmarks.
1956;This might make a good film to watch if you love violent movies, or you love the country of USA.
1957;But please look at other film instead of this one.
1958;the Standard Def 5 Star Collection had both the theatrical release and the extended version along with a ton of cool extras like alternate endings and alternate scenes which I always enjoy far more than endless commentaries and performers telling the camera how great every other performer or director was.
1959;the Blu Ray has only the theatrical version , a useless Ultra Violet download which will not go into iTunes, a silly game where you find objects during the course of the film and it brings you to additional scenes, more commentaries, a trivia track and trailers.
1960;the transfer is really very clean with good contrast, realistic lighting and skin tones.
1961;Though much of the color grading produces a softer effect unlike the color popping you might find in a Transformers movie, the color reproduction is very good.
1962;"The audio levels are very good and there is a fine balance of volume between the dialogue, foley audio and soundtrack
1963;Love every minute of it.
1964;The three documentaries are good"
1965;The commentary by the director and producer was interesting.
1966;Information like the US military did not support the film because Area 51 was mentioned, makes you wonder.
1967;Most of the interesting information on the special effects was covered very well by the documentaries.
1968;"Most of the special effects commentary is reduced to the commentators saying, ""That's a model,"" and ""That's CGI."""
1969;I watched this movie in theaters when I was younger and to this day it still has that ow inspiring visual effects, acting, story, everything.
1970;The sound is terrific, with rock.
1971;house lows and some marvelous surround work.
1972;so than I'd like, but does have some good features.
1973;The Emmerich/Devlin commentary is a hoot, because neither of them are po.
1974;faced about their work, and the irreverence is refreshing.
1975;ray?PROS: The visual clarity and detail were obvious immediately.
1976;This comedic moment was cut.
1977;Will Smith plays his usual regular guy charm to make this quite entertaining.
1978;Also, like always the Americans are smarter than everybody else, so they come back and save the world.
1979;The first part of the film holds up well with lots of suspense and tension, but after the aliens start to pound earth the whole thing just comes apart.
1980;My husband and I love this movie even though it has obvious flaws in the reality department.
1981;It's great to just turn your mind off and watch the action.
1982;They are also not believable, but lots of fun.
1983;What more do you want from a movie.
1984;It had laughs, chills, make you go wow scenes, and tears.
1985;Jeff Golblum, as always, is an entertaining presence in the movie.
1986;His unique style speaks for itself and works extremely well in this movie.
1987;Will Smith, love him or hate him, brings all his energy to his role as Capt. Steven Hiller.
1988;Personally, I thought the cast was perfect for the movie.
1989;as we all know, the special effects where great, but despite some complaints that that's what all this movie is about, I liked the story, too.
1990;Trailers galore, behind the scenes features, the original Biplane ending , which they made a wise choice in changing.
1991;Pretty much, most of these scenes don't add too much to the movie, but they are nice to see.
1992;I happened to love it for one simple reason.
1993;This was a great movie when I first saw it and now with what is going on in our country I think everyone should view it.
1994;It shows America is willing to fight for the right to be free.
1995;Will Smith and Jeff Goldbloom do a great job.
1996;It's a very good movie!
1997;I like it and watch it several times.
1998;It's also good for kid.
1999;Love this movie the first time I saw it, and every time after.
2000;one day I caught the extended version on a rare cable play.
2001;The extra scenes are a MUST to the story.
2002;Anyone that is a fan of the theatrical version needs to see the extended version.
2003;5 Star fun, interesting story lines, great acting, and excellent special effects.
2004;They enjoyed the action and the bad puns.
2005;It's a thrill ride and thoroughly enjoyable.
2006;It satisfies everyone who can imagine a world in which the possibility of life beyond earth exists.
2007;Will Smith is, and always has been, FABULOUS in his role.
2008;loved what they did to destroy the aliens lol
2009;I love Will Smith in an adult roll and still be funny.
2010;This is one of those movies that make you feel good after you've seen it.
2011;There are a lot of good actors in this movies.
2012;It's exciting for the whole family, but may be a little scary for young kids.
2013;This movie is spectacular, a bit unbelievable but excellent graphics for the time.
2014;With the war scenes, the alien scenes and the under story love scenes It has something for everyone.
2015;This is easily my alltime favourite alien.
2016;Besides the normal screaming and running, it contains some great realistic portraits of humankind.
2017;Of course, there are always those superheroes, one of the strong type and the more intelligent type, but Jeff Goldblum is always terrific to watch.
2018;On the whole, this is a pretty intelligent movie with some realistic aspects and also just great special effects, can't wait to see The day after tomorrow.
2019;One of my most favorite movies of all time.
2020;i have seen this before it is a good movie fun to watch Will Smith is good in this movie I think it was creative.
2021;This movie is simply escapism, it's true.
2022;off of war of the worlds, but it's enjoyable to watch and Will Smith is pretty good.
2023;I ordered the movie for a good price.
2024;I thought it was to good to be true.
2025;Great story, action and acting.
2026;The whole world works together to stop the alien invasion from wiping us out.
2027;This is a great movie.
2028;The special effects are great!
2029;Independence Day is one of Hollywood's best action/disaster films of all.
2030;"Filled with remarkable special effects and a good script, ""Independence Day"" has gone on to be not only a beloved thrill."
2031;ride movie, but one of the biggest blockbusters in movie.
2032;"Independence Day is a combination of the movies ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""The Day After Tomorrow"", and many of the neat disaster epics from the seventies, but produced on a much more high."
2033;"minute documentary on the making of ""Independence Day"", an HBO feature entitled ""First Look: Independence Day"" a 33 minute feature hosted by Jeff Goldblum, plus much more."
2034;I remember when this movie came out and we watched on the 4th of July, seeing it again was still very entertaining.
2035;"the now deceased former longshoreman and popular philosopher Eric Hoffer once said, ""The nature of the American is that he is a hustler."
2036;in contrast, the films of the late sixties and seventies were experimental, creative and interesting.
2037;In plain and simple english, ID4 is massive entertainment full of inventive visual effects and an all star cast.
2038;It's just plain fun all around.
2039;Think Day the Earth Stood Still meets Aliens with a dash of V: The Final Battle .
2040;One bit of inspired writing has the president and his team going to the mysterious Area 51 to find a way to fight the aliens.
2041;ID4 continues to entertain on a massive scale and not many big blockbusters have accomplished that much.
2042;invasion film, I still stand as one of its defenders.
2043;For sure, it doesn't hold a candle to Close Encounters., but it's still a watchable, above.
2044;The special effects are good but not great, and the suspense leading to the attack keeps the viewer glued to the story.
2045;It's far more interesting than anything Jerry Bruckheimer will ever produce.
2046;The special effects are good, just the sight of the White House being incinerated and Air Force One flying in front of a wall of flame are thought provoking enough.
2047;on the flip side, imagine a stripper and the first lady becoming friends.
2048;But hey, it's the movies and anything is possible.
2049;But in the short run while you are watching and for some time after it will certainly be interesting.
2050;It's patriotic, has lots of action, some humor regarding the humans involved, bigger than life scenery, good alien creations, some romance and true love between family members.
2051;One of best movies with alien beings that looked reasonable and not comic while being strange.
2052;The world pulled together to face a common enemy.
2053;Can be enjoyed over and over, by the family.
2054;It's a movie you can get involved in feeling the struggles, and the joy of winning, yet it is not emotionaly draining.
2055;The special effects were great.
2056;The action was fast moving from the very beginning to the very end.
2057;The plot was quite good with many twists.
2058;This is a 5 star movie all the way.
2059;One you will want to own and watch over and over.
2060;"of all the ""Aliens Attack Earth"" movies, I cant think of many as good as this one."
2061;I have enjoyed this movie many times over the years ~ it never fails to entertain me, even though I have seen it at least 20 times.
2062;The actors are excellent and the acting is good, the story line is plausible, and considering this is an older movie, the special effects are pretty awesome.
2063;Watch it for a good time and then watch it again.
2064;"I don't love it because it's great filmmaking
2065;Stay clear of this tat .
2066;but throw in Will Smith in his prime, Jeff Goldblum, and a very good supporting cast and you cant help but love this film.
2067;a quintessential example of the """"summer blockbuster"""", """"Independence Day"""" is a full."""
2068;fiction epic with a likable cast, astonishing special effects, and a unique style of direction from Roland Emmerich.
2069;It is a film that emphasizes the American dream, patriotism, and perhaps is a stab at communism, in which the war against the all.
2070;mighty alien terror is actually symbolizing the decades of struggle that the United States dealt with against socialist countries such as Nazi Germany and the U. s. s. r. will Smith is excellent as a rogue fighter pilot who finds himself preparing for an unusual enemy.
2071;Bill Pullman gives an adequate role as the gung ho president who must trust his heart and not let political issues determine the fate of the world as he knows it.
2072;Jeff Goldblum play his usual scientist role, but is wittier than usual and is a grand compliment to the Fresh Prince.
2073;The three main stars engage in an all.
2074;"Director Roland Emmerich basically states ""screw your cool."
2075;"looking dinosaurs Spielberg, check this out!"""
2076;"The second half of ""Independence Day"" is truly enjoyable as the audience gets to konw the characters better and they are intertwined in a battle for mankind."
2077;em adventure that will delight the whole family.
2078;Still probably has the coolest looking spaceship ever created on film.
2079;It's not the deepest movie, but it's fun to watch, especially on July 4th.
2080;Good humor from Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum.
2081;A fun movie for the family, and a few thrills too!
2082;but it's heart is in the right place, and a lot of things are destroyed in this film.
2083;Packed with two disks that really deleiver added value and repeat viewing, you get alot.
2084;Commentary (which is actually pretty good and insightful), three MAKING OF's.
2085;pLANE ending, and excellent menu interfaces that take you into AREA 51 .
2086;we have an EASTER EGG, a hidden menu that takes you inside the alien space craft.
2087;but are uncut and very interesting to watch .
2088;each one seperated from the rest to demonstrate how a film is put together.
2089;Move right one time to highlight the light above the disk drive.
2090;You will then move into the ship and see a hidden menu.
2091;see if you can find them.
2092;It enhanced the experience the whole way.
2093;The whole point of the movie was to be entertained, and it is one movie you can watch when you are bored with everyday life and you want something to excite you and give you a real adrenalin rush.
2094;ID4 was a feel good movie.
2095;fi films, for it pretty much stands on it's own.
2096;That is something you don't see everyday!
2097;The two men fly an alien spacecraft and go back to space to take out the mother spaceship.
2098;Because today is our independence day!
2099;Both of those contain logic and real actors.
2100;Errors occured with the added cuts.
2101;One of his best movies!!
2102;too much fuss for nothing!Too many heroes,extraordinary unreal characters and behaviours.
2103;armageddon, Deep Impact and Space Cowboys were FAAAR better films, more believable I would say.
2104;It is just a fun movie to watch.
2105;I like Will Smith, I think he is one of the best, and he has more class in his little finger than many other entertainers have in their whole body.
2106;LOL No kidding Classic movie, good family movie, great entertainment.
2107;Fun to watch all year round.
2108;Bill Pullman is one of my favorites too.
2109;I recommend this movie 100%.
2110;Ok, so this movie may have lacked a lot of elements that make movies great movies great, but it did have something most high.
2111;budget movies don't, a good plot.
2112;up one building at a time) and lots of other things of that nature, but it did it in a believeable way.
2113;The actors held the script together.
2114;I saw this film long before war of the worlds, and I loved it!
2115;The acting is good, the charecters believable, and the special f/x are excellent!
2116;jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman and Will Smith do the best job, and Margaret Colin, Vivica A. Fox, and Judd Hirsh are pretty good too, this film was 10 times better than Mars Attacks!
2117;Such an epic speech from one of the best movies of the 90s.
2118;This thing may be one of the best alien blockbusters ever made.
2119;This is a great science fiction flick.
2120;"It has super special effects
2121;The survivors devise a plan to fight back against the enslaving aliens, and July 4th becomes the day humanity will fight for its freedom.
2122;This is the way you portray an alien ivasion movie.
2123;I loved the characters, the story, the special effects, the action, the love, the whole load.
2124;Independence Day is an entertaining sci.
2125;I know a lot of people enjoyed this action.
2126;From an entertainment perspective, the movie was moderately entertaining at times.
2127;it's loaded with features(on disc 2)and the film looks and sounds great!
2128;I loved it when it came out.
2129;Now my kids loved it too, it is a good decent movie from back in the day.
2130;This movie can entertain, if you do not think too much about the details of its plot.
2131;the special effects are fantastic, the acting is OK.
2132;At any rate, it's nice to know we can defeat vicious aliens, if they ever get here.
2133;If you haven't seen ID4, you're in for a treat!
2134;There's some outlandishness in this movie, some coincidences only Hollywood could pull off, but there's a lot of fun, humor, warmth, action, and drama in it as well.
2135;If you're looking for some fun, adventure, and popcorn munching fun, look no further!
2136;ray made a big difference.
2137;All I need know is a good surround sound system!
2138;I am very happy with the order and would highly recommend the place to anyone.
2139;An excellent addition to our movie collection.
2140;I'm gonna have to admit that I enjoyed this film when I saw it on the big screen.
2141;I paid the matinee ticket price, so that redeems me somewhat.
2142;but there's some nice energy here, great special effects, and I'm always glad when female strippers make an appearance (in a PG.13 movie, no less!)
2143;personally, I enjoyed the creature design and most of the action.
2144;Okay, yes, a computer virus is a good idea, but it'd probably take years to learn and develop programs for an alien computer network.
2145;so, the movie is a bit silly albeit exciting, and I'd much rather see Special Editions of more important films.
2146;, it is passable and can be entertaining.
2147;pros: Will Smith is good, and there are some cute/funny bits.
2148;Will Smith is top notch in this futuristic alien space film.
2149;Several great actors in this one.
2150;Definitely worth the money, in my opinion.
2151;This supercharged War of the Worlds ripoff is worth seeing just for the special effects.
2152;watch that scene, and remember the news videos about the Twin Towers.
2153;This is an excellent way to spend the evening.
2154;If Hollywood wants me to believe a MAC can control an Alien computer, fine.
2155;This is a fun movie with good action, and a happy ending, and some of the best One.
2156;Sit back, grab a drink and some popcorn, and enjoy your evening.
2157;I saw a packed house applaud this film twice and I think I know a reason why.
2158;hidden in all the stupidity (although there are some incredibly well done scenes.
2159;this movie also makes real everyone's ultimate fantasy of super aliens taking on a super power .
2160;probably why the blowing up of the White House caused such a reaction .
2161;the message of everyone working together is somewhat lost in the jingoism of the film, but seeing an Arab/Israeli pilot team kind of brings home the message.
2162;Most movies today are more cynical, so it's interesting that this one works.
2163;Goldblum discovers the alien's use of our satellite system .
2164;ID4 serves that purpose quite well.
2165;It's never pointed out that we have already done a good job of the same thing.
2166;stock characters aside, ID4 works because of the sheer epic scale.
2167;The visuals are pretty good eye candy and the commentary on how they were achieved is also quite good.
2168;Yes, it's unbelievable but it's fun in a B movie sort of way.
2169;In fact, that about sums up ID4"
2170;I have it in vhs and have always wanted it in Blu.
2171;I thought this was going to be one of the greatest movies ever, after I saw the trailer way back when.
2172;There are so many eye.
2173;Will Smith is somewhat likeable in this film and Judd Hersch is funny (although he could never top his work in Taxi).
2174;This is an American film, displaying a rare air of American Patriotism in modern cinema.
2175;It has plenty of cliches, it has its silly moments, but it is also a great film to cheer the heroes.
2176;I loved the movie because I liked many of the characters.
2177;I liked their stories, their sacrifices, and their joys in the face of impending doom.
2178;I agree, it has those aspects married to some modern special effects.
2179;If you don't hate America or if you don't think being American is an embarassment, you just may enjoy this movie.
2180;the acting's not bad, and the effects are top.
2181;Everything was fine for the first hour.
2182;"This is the ultimate ""Us VS Them"" epic."
2183;It has great special effects, great music, plenty of humor, and characters who are more sympathetic than most.
2184;as usual, Jeff Goldblum is the scene stealer as a quirky genius, and Will Smith does his usual tough, smart, funny persona bit.
2185;Judd Hirsch is fun as Jeff's dad.
2186;The destruction of the cities are well done and the climax is rousing in the tradition of the classic Star Wars trilogy.
2187;Awesome digital transfer to this blu.
2188;"I liked the story line and the special effects
2189;other than those things that directors could find out but are too lazy to, this is a good film.
2190;I had a good time.
2191;if you can calculate a 15% tip without a calculator, check your brain at the door and disregard the flaws in computer science, political theory, fluid dynamics, and everything else and you'll probably enjoy this movie.
2192;if you think that aliens with the intelligence and technology to travel between stars can be outsmarted by Jeff Goldblum, this is the movie for you!
2193;It does this very well, with fast pacing, lots of explosions and interpersonal drama.
2194;The effects have held up a lot better than I'd have thought they would as well.
2195;the Blu Ray version of the movie is *very* impressive.
2196;This particular movie helps show how nice hi def can be on a big screen, better than most.
2197;I didn't think the audio was as impressive as the visual, but it was still certainly decent.
2198;And what better way to celebrate Independence Day than by actually watching the movie that started it all!
2199;but you can still watch this fun movie and eat a bowl of popcorn!
2200;He was great and the movie kept you on the edge of your seat.
2201;This is in my personal opinion one of Will Smiths best movies, it didn't recieve that much love from the critics but i personally adored every minute of this movie.
2202;that is all i am going to tell you about the movie as i feel i may have ruined the best part of it for you but i must say this that this is an incredible movie and for it's time had some of the best special effects.
2203;Full of action and in a way holds some truth by showing how vulnerable our planet would be if something like this where to happen.
2204;fi movies up to that point taking parts of 1950's classic sci.
2205;fi, most notably WAR OF THE WORLDS.
2206;When in terms of real human conflict, it takes months and years to resolve anything.
2207;This is Hollywood and it's only a movie.
2208;Great production values, great casting and decent script makes I. d.4 one of the few modern sci.
2209;fi movies that would be considered a modern classic on an epic scale.
2210;The creators took on something old and made it new again.
2211;The special edition was awesome great work 20th century fox!
2212;Love the movie, but I don't like being taken for a ride.
2213;ordered on 7 July 2012 and received today.
2214;When making a movie of the """"summer blockbuster"""" type, there a number of elements that must be present, such as action, adventure, a bit of humor, some sort of seemingly unstoppable enemy, and (if the film studio really cares) some interesting characters to latch onto."""
2215;Independence Day scores high marks on all those elements.
2216;"to put it as plainly as possible, ""Independence Day"" is primarily a rousing success because of the gravitas the ""Fourth of July"" theme lends it."
2217;to be fair, however, this film is well.
2218;constructed enough to stand on its own merits.
2219;star cast and their character development on screen.
2220;"overall, ""Independence Day"" is easily a flick that can be enjoyed every July 4th (at the very least)."
2221;It's one of those movies where you pop the popcorn, turn out the lights, and just get swept away in the scope of the action playing out on the screen.
2222;But for some reason I rather enjoy viewing this neat little epic.
2223;And to this day, I've yet to view a movie that boasts more realistic visual effects than this effort (although many of the rear.
2224;They blew up REAL good, huh huh.
2225;a good portion of the restored Special Edition footage helps to further flesh out the subplot involving Randy Quaid's character, who plays the stereotypical ne'er.
2226;well who redeems himself in the end character.
2227;All I'm going to say is you'll have to see it to believe it.
2228;Cliches usually freeze me right out of an entertainent like this, but there's so much that's really good, and that goes without expressing my own delight that the movie doesn't take itself seriously at all.
2229;guessing the casting director, but definttely not here.
2230;iD4 is lots of fun and in may ways more like a ride at an amusement park than a movie.
