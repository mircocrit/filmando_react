5;"A tale of glory, of pride, and courage in a time of treachery and anger
6;I have been viewing this film every few years since it first came out.
7;Those facts are more captivating to me than this long piece of work.
8;please stop this and take some responsibility and post reviews ONLY for their specific versions .
9;Simply one of the greatest films ever made, starring the greatest British actor of all time, Obi Wan Kenobi himself.
10;See it or miss out on a grand adventure.

15;2001, Blade Runner and The Dark Knight are all excellent, but for too many reasons, Lawrence of Arabia bests them all.
16;The film grain is accurate.
17;Colors look accurate and Freddie Young's lighting is impeccably and naturally reproduced.
18;There are a few shots that look as if they were photographed yesterday.
19;sound is as good as you could hope.
20;ADR and other effects show their age, but they do fit the production time.
21;It's all faithful to source, which is what matters the most.
22;oh yeah, it's also one of the five greatest films of all time in case you cared.
23;LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is, without a doubt, the greatest historical epic ever filmed and the crowning achievement of David Lean's career.
24;It's also the film that makes best use of the majestic desert landscape with shots of extraordinary rock formations, dunes, shimmering """"mirages,"""" and caravans making their way across seemingly endless sands."""
25;even though there are battle scenes in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, this film is, first and foremost, a character study of Lawrence who was, by anyone's account, a fascinating figure.
26;omar Sharif is impressive as Sherif Ali Ibn El Kharish.
27;known when they starred in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, the film's supporting case is certainly stellar: Alec Guiness, Anthony Quinn, Jose Ferrer and Claude Raines.

31;This is by far, the greatest shot film of all time!
32;In widescreen formate, the viewer is transported to a gorgeous Arabia, full of scintillating scenes that look almost too good to be real.
33;The power of the film, lies within the viewer.
34;If on the other hand, you are a little more jaded, then the cinematography should at least please the gallery.
35;It may not be the best film ever, but it may be the most beautifull, and the one the stirs the heart toward far away things.
36;The result is an epic adventure with both action and intelligence, for which Lean earned his second Oscar for Best Director.
37;"The film boasts stunning cinematography and a crisp, thoughtful script full of memorable lines, which range from the dramatic thunderclap quoted above to the humorous:General Murray : ""I can't make out whether you're a bloody madman or just half."
38;Omar Sharif plays Sherif Ali, whose intelligence, practicality and casualness toward human life play perfectly off of Lawrence's (Peter O'Toole's) own ideas about the value of life and his at times larger.
39;"lawrence was intelligent, witty, and conflicted
40;This movie has everything in it but romance.
41;Cleopatra, Gone with the Wind, Spartacus, and many other movies, were made the real way, real actors, and real movie sets.
42;Although this movie isn't a completely accurate depiction of Lawrence's life, it is a great movie about life.
43;The nice thing is you don't mind, because there is so much more to tell.
44;I never do that, but I figured it had to be good since it won best picture and I love war movies.
45;There are, but I'd say both in time and atmosphere that this is more a journey movie about a man going somewhere both physically and spiritually.
46;i highly recommend this movie.
47;Already a stunning classic, with impressive photography and acting, this new format adds greater clarity and definition tothe non Blu.

53;It is filmed beautifully, the actors are amazing, and the story is compelling.
54;52 years ago when I watched this in a theater, I was amazed and impressed with the scope of the movie magic and the breadth of the character T. e. Lawrence.
55;It is still a masterfully crafted movie, entertaining to the fullest, and reminds us all that not all great men are necessarily sane.
56;One of the great epic films of the 60s.

61;This is the greatest epic ever filmed.
62;Back in the day when religious and historical epics were more abundant, this one stood out above the rest.
63;It's amazing to think that David Lean could sustain this level of brilliance for three movies in a row.
64;It as a tour de force in every way.
65;The directing is wonderful, the writing, the editing, the acting.

68;It takes more than just a big budget to make an epic, you need a larger than life character, great story, and it has to be presented in an interesting way.
69;David Lean and Peter O'Toole bring everything that they have to this movie.
70;A Stunning achievment of the highest level.
71;This film is an absolute classic.
72;It's an amazing story of one man's influence on an entire culture.
73;A great cinematic portrayel of the arabs' life in the vast expanse of the desert.

77;The contrast in Lawrence is an intersting historical perspective on the man, and a great allegorical perspective on men in general.

85;The extra features on the 2nd disk are great including the documentary.
86;the paper insert from the original movie program is well done.
87;The interactive map viewable on a PC was also well done and it provides a good illustration of the superhuman efforts T. e. Lawrence pulled off on foot and camelback.
88;Even the case with the cloth like feel is really nice.
89;Each scene is a work of art.

100;Just some of the greatest production and cinematic values ever put on film.
101;It was breathtaking 40 years ago, and it is breathtaking today.
102;making performance by Peter O'Toole as the driven, enigmatic Lawrence at its center, surrounded by an exquisite cast, and with, as Steven Spielberg says perhaps the best script ever written David Lean's obsessive perfectionism created a masterpiece for all time.

104;", blending with Maurice Jarre's majestic soundtrack
105;All these elements were moulded under the hands of director David Lean into a film that has become an enduring masterpiece.
106;His vision, understanding of the subject matter, mastery of technique, eye for detail and uncompromising standards present us with a riveting desert saga based on the exploits of enigmatic British army officer, T. e. Lawrence, during the Arab Revolt in the First World War.

108;It is an epic adventure story staged in a landscape of austere and perilous beauty.
109;For newcomers to the film I should do no better than to quote the Lawrence character: """"It's going to be fun."""""""
110;"No one was a more masterful film maker than was David Lean, the British director who brought us such unforgettable classics as ""Bridge Over the River Kwai"", ""Doctor Zhivago"" """"Ryan's Daughter"", and of course, ""Lawrence of Arabia""(see my reviews of all these films)."
111;The cinematography is always spectacular and breath.
112;taking, and one has to agree with the comments of a previous reviewer that here the desert plays a well.
113;Lean always focused his films on the ways in which individuals and their personal characteristics clash and meld with the larger social, cultural, and historical surround in which they are located, and so each film is a particularly captivating study of the specific dynamics of each such situation.
114;Each of these films is also a well.
115;choreographed and photographed excursion into the topography, climate, and landscape of the geographic location in which the drama unfolds.
116;The eyes and ears are always delighted by what Lean displays.
117;The film captures this unlikely and somewhat quixotic personal odyssey most memorably, and a very young Peter O'Toole is masterful in his edgy portrayal of the enigmatic Lawrence as a time.
118;boggling adventure of a lifetime, an adventure that broke all the rules of convention and upper.
119;And in capturing the comically mismatched skills, expectations, and romanticism that Lawrence launched into the larger picture of what was going on, by viewing his personal odyssey in the context of the much larger cultural framework of Arab ambitions, jealousies, and cultural differences, we are magically transported into the strange and marvelous world of the desert and all the romance and mystery of that region.
120;"Viewing each of David Lean's splendid and classic films is a treat and a privilege
121;Lawrence of Arabia is one of his finest films, and as such represents a wonderful standard of excellence in storytelling and film experiences.
122;here, though, that inevitable break in the movie is put to good use: Lawrence of Arabia is really two great movies.
123;especially a film that will take the question seriously, rather than use it as a chance for Movie of the Week schmaltz.
124;The decline and fall of Lawrence is as gripping as any other film I've seen, and would stand on its own as a film classic even without the lead.
125;together with beautiful vistas .
126;the greatest moments of some classic actors (see why Omar Sharif actually deserves his big name recognition) and amazing set pieces decades before Braveheart, Lawrence of Arabia has something for everyone: It's a serious art piece, it's an action movie, it's an adventure.

136;O'Toole's sensitive interpretation of the man is simply brilliant, balancing a larger.
137;an amazing film, truly David Lean's masterpiece!
138;It is one of the classics still of our time.
139;the basic story is about a British officer that sees past the varied politics of the time and is able to find unique ways to help the Arabs create their own homeland whether they want it or not.
140;The underlying music will stay with you for years.
141;For me this film was excellent.
142;This is truly one of the best films of the century.
143;It belongs in everyone's movie collection.
144;The book that comes in the package is also a collectors dream and is filled with the background stories and thought processes of the director and his actors.
145;It is incredibly interesting and fascinating.

148;If you don't own this film, you are missing out on a truly spectacular movie experience.
149;An excellent movie, and actor Peter O'Toole is outstanding as Lawrence.
150;This was a true spectacular in it's day, what am I saying in my day too!
151;This film, of course, is the best ever made (in my opinion).

166;For all purposes, the movie is flawless.
167;And if I helped increase the movie's enjoyment for you, this review was well worth writing.

188;For me, this has been a eye.
189;It is an absolute must see.
190;Even with all of the problems, this film is simply phenomenal in every way.
191;Time has borne out that Lean was absolutely right to leave it that way, rather than guessing at the man's motivations and hidden life.
192;Beyond that, the amazingly rich photography, the loving attention to detail, the perfectly pitched pace of the story and the multiple relationships among the characters, and even Alec Guinness in """"brownface"""" as Prince Faisel, combine to create an incredible work of art that will never grow old."""

199;Until the last half century the Arabs and Brits got along fine.
200;I'm suresome liberties were taken by the screen writers but the primary story is interesting.
201;It's hard for the small screen to do justice to such a sweeping cinematographic epic, but there is much more to this film than its visual majesty.
202;The film has one of the most beautiful and recognized scores in the history of cinema, a fascinating subject in the person of T. e. Lawrence himself, one of the most literate screenplays ever written, and a wonderful supporting cast nearing perfection.
203;It is precisely because of its length that it is seldom seen on TV anymore.
204;however, this is really an oversimplification of a very complex film.
205;Ali is a man who has a good bead on who he is and what he believes.
206;"This becomes immensely clear when at the end of the film Prince Feisel, who has always seemed to be genuine towards Lawrence, says during negotiations with the British ""Lawrence is a double."
207;By the way, the role of Ali has to be Sharif's finest hour as an actor.
208;I always thought Dr. Zhivago was that finest role, and it is still a great performance, but this one is even better.

251;In amongst all the thoroughly deserved praise that LoA gets for acting, cinematography and directing, (all thoroughly deserved by the way: Peter O'Toole is one of my great heroes as an actor) I just want to add a huge round of applause for Robert Bolt, the writer of the screenplay.
252;for those of you who don't know, Robert Bolt was a VERY successful playwright in his own right.
253;anyone who can come up with wonderful pithy dialogue like the famous match scene, or the following exchanges deserves major credit:General Allenby: I'm promoting you Major.

255;What can I say about the greatest movie ever filmed?
256;Stunning restored version, colour saturation perfect and the extras truly make this a film buff's collector item.
257;This wonderful classic is worth watching again and again.
258;My sixteen year old son watched it for the first time and was very impressed (a pleasant surprise.

264;On that day, I learned that I had been depriving myself of some of the greatest movies that had ever been made.
265;Lawrence of Arabia, my now favorite movie, opened my eyes to the greatness of cinematic epics.
266;When I finally received it, I watched the movie from beginning to end.
267;The cinematography of the movie is astounding.
268;Peter O'Toole magnificently plays Lawrence with a passion and complexity now rarely seen in today's actors.
269;Omar Shariff and Alec Guinness also do a superb job in their individual roles.
270;The subtlety of the scene transition allows the movie to flow through the various stages of Lawrence's travels, and the bold musical score by Maurice Jarre blends harmoniously with Lawrence's complex personality.
271;I vigorously recommend this movie to anyone looking for an excellent movie based on a fascinating man.
272;Hopefully, someone else will discover and enjoy it as I have.
273;The movie is a masterpiece.
274;An outstanding international cast, a gripping story, superb cinematography, and exeptional directing.
275;This is David Lean's masterpiece.
276;This films deserves a large screen format.
277;ray of Lawrence of Arabia is outstanding.
278;The picture is vibrant and clear.
279;This must be the best it has ever looked on screen.
280;The film itself is an epic masterpiece, and is highly recommended for anyone interested in classic cinema, epic film making, grand and sweeping landscapes, intriguing characters, and beautiful music.
281;The beautifully filmed scenes of the rolling Arabian sand dunes will absolutely take your breath away!
282;The film is perhaps one of the most daring and ambitious films ever made.
283;Utilizing an amazing screenplay written by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson, Lean created a film that is an intimate character study, a harrowing war epic, a spectacular adventure and one of the greatest achievements in the annals of filmic history.
284;It won seven Oscars and garnered international acclaim.
285;the film tells the tale of staff.
286;He managed to with the help of a senior officer, obtain a new position with the Arab Bureau.
287;equipped soldiers, Lawrence came to the conclusion that they were not only adequate as fighters but also courageous and dedicated.
288;Lawrence's confidence at first offended the Arabs, who saw him as another cocky British officer, but they eventually came to respect his bravery and tenacity.
289;This treacherous journey tries them all and along the way Lawrence earns the respect of the Bedouin, especially Ali (who he first met on his way to meet Prince Feisal, when Ali killed Lawrence's guide for drinking from a Harith well).
290;Finally they reach Akaba and their surprise attack is successful.
291;He's tasted power and held many lives in his hands, and on some level or another he knows that giving him more responsibility would be a dangerous thing to do.
292;Yet he agrees to Allenby's proposition when Allenby subtly builds up his ego with talk of making history.
293;when Lawrence returns to the desert he brings British ammunition and armored vehicles.
294;His name becomes infamous and he is viewed by many as a hero.
295;There Turkish soldiers capture him, though they never discover his identity.
296;He decides to give up and allow the Arab revolt to be carried on by others.
297;when next the Arab army assembles, Ali sees a great change in Lawrence.
298;He sees a man who is over confident and vengeful, bloodthirsty and guilt ridden.
299;Even those men who once admired him now look on him with fear and trepidation.
300;clearly he was in real life a tragic hero, a complex man with great dreams and aspirations.
301;Peter O'Toole is riveting in his portrayal of the enigmatic Lawrence and Omar Sharif, as Ali, gives a complex and multi.
302;The cinematography is breathtaking in its scope and gives the illusion that the desert is unending.
303;The music by Maurice Jarre is incredibly powerful.
304;It's no wonder the film is recognized as one of the best ever made.
305;The first is a bare bones single disc release, the second is an impressive 2.
306;ray restoration is really extraordinary making it appear just as it did at that time.
307;the writing directing and acting are first class from beginning to end.
308;This move on this disk is simply amaizing.
309;This is much better than the orrigonal, and I thought it was the greatest.
310;ray edition of Lawrence of Arabia, David Lean Great epic.
311;But it is the best compromise possible, for the 4.
312;disc version offers so much extra material, not available in the best biographies and critical works on David Lean's works.
313;disc edition will easily fill some of those gaps with lively narratives and comments from the likes of Peter O'Toole, at 80, Martin Scorsese, or Eddie Fowlie.
314;There is plenty here to enjoy.
315;"The book features the actual notes from from Maurice Jarre's theme of ""Lawrence,"" reviews from the time the epic movie was released (1962), and a sources/bibliography section that mentions such important works by scholars on Lawrence as Robert Morris's and Lawrence Raskin's ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" and Adrian Turner's ""The Making of Lawrence of Arabia,"" along with works by Kevin Brownlow, Sandra Lean, and Gene D. Phillips."
316;but the real bonuses come in the high definition Blu.
317;Disc #2 opens with a contemporary narration of Peter O'Toole, whose memory at 80 seems to be flawless, and his sharp wit adds to the variety of recollections of the epic adventure of filming.
318;"O'Toole pays tribute to Lean as a great director and leader as only he can
319;Disc #3 is the real treasure trove for both collectors of trivia, film buffs and scholars.
320;The next feature is an impression by Martin Scorsese, who gives his insights about Lawrence's enigmatic personality, as Scorsese only could.
321;The disc contains other features, the most endearing of which is a 120.
322;It is informative and fun to watch and hear.
323;perhaps too much at $67 (down to #57 since), but, for me, it shines, and I got my money's worth.
324;As always the director's cut is the best!
325;Great movies like this just are not made anymore.
326;There is an exclusive documentary entitled The Making of Lawrence of Arabia , which is outstanding.
327;Also, a conversation with Steven Spielberg, original newsreel footage of the New York premiere, advertising campaigns, and talent files.
328;this is an outstanding film that will go down in history as one of the all time best!
329;This is quite simply the best movie I have ever seen.
330;One of the best directors of our time tells the true (if dramaticized) story of a remarkable man in a remarkable time and place.
331;The time Lean spent developing the environmental backdrop and the characters was well worth the effort, as it adds a complexity and depth to the plot rarely seen in movies today.
332;Oh, did I mention that O'toole and Sharif are at their very best in this film?
333;(Then go back and see the movie again.)
334;a comparable film, and even Dune .
335;which seems to share some of its roots with the Lawrence story.
336;if you haven't seen this film, and you like complex stories, you're in for a real treat.
337;I will see this movie any time, any place.
338;a superb cast, especially Anthony Quinn as the indomitable Aouda"
339;And all the elements are cooked like a sumptous meal into a utterly brilliant film.
340;The viewer is transported to the time and place of WWI Arabia completely.
341;And Lawrence of Arabia succeeds like very, very few others.
342;This 50 year old masterpiece of film making looks and sounds as good as or better than any of the modern movies in my library created for this format!
343;Whether the scenes are indoors or on the sprawling sands of Arabia the detail is spellbinding.
344;A great experience just got even greater.
345;The classic epic about one man's triumphant journey through the Arabian Penninsula during World War I is not just a story, but a cultural and historic landmark in filmaking.
346;The cinematography, soundtrack, and acting come together in choreographed perfection to create a marvel of sight, sound, and magic.
347;O'Toole brilliant performance was nominated for his role as leading actor in the portrayal of T. e. Lawrence .
348;a whole story in itself.
349;this is filmmaking at its absolute best.
350;the first, longer part of 'Arabia' is especially magnificent, daring the audience to submit to its pace, to feel the monotonous vastness and unknowability of the desert.
351;so rich and detailed is the first half, that Lean seems to have gotten bored, and the second is a mostly dispiriting sequence of noisy, cluttered crowd scenes that is much closer to Lucas and Spielberg, with barely an interesting, never mind beautiful shot.
352;Great history film, great actors and a super story.
353;He seems to remake possibility by sheer force of eerie will.
354;who knows who really won the Levant campaign?
355;So many claimed to have done so.
356;but the consideration of that question is more entertainingly carried out with the stunning imagery of this film on one's shelf.
357;Its widescreen sequences of men on camels in almost borderless desert stretches the imagination.
358;The package is beautiful, the supplementary materials fascinating.
359;I merely wish to note that as, a home theater fanatic who has adopted today's wonderful new high definition front projection technology as my means for enjoying such films as this David Lean classic, the new Blu Ray restoration of the film is a dream come true.
360;The film was one that I saw in New York City during its opening run.
361;The pristine 70mm print, shown with the cutting edge projection and sound technology of that time, on a truly massive screen, left you feeling, for decades thereafter, that you would never experience the movie that way again.
362;The elimination of dirt and scratches, the magnificent sharpness of the screen images, the vibrance of the color, the richness and clarity of the soundtrack combine to make a viewing experience that will be a joy to any serious fan of this picture.
363;It gorgeously takes its epic genre to a level of intelligence and maturity that was never surpassed.
364;This is an epic movie, the cinimatography was excellent, as is the acting.
365;His motivation is a mystery.
366;As great as this human dimension is, the raw beauty of the desert is what makes this film as great as it is.
367;What an extraordinary job of location filming.
368;A large cast engages in military charges on horseback and camel.
369;The actors had to learn to ride camels and they did so convincingly.
370;Also, there is a great documentary in the second disk in which Shariff, the late Quinn and others are interviewed.
371;I recommend this great Oscar winner.
372;There are perhaps five movies in history where it all comes together: story,direction,acting,cinematography and music.
373;ray was introduced and it doesn't disappoint.
374;I thought this movie was good and relaxing.
375;"This is the greatest film ever made.Yes, better than ""Gone With The Wind"", better than ""Citizen Kane,"" better than."
376;It has the scope and vision of an epic, which for me is still Hollywood's grandest contribution to the art form.
377;"Spielberg and company have probably destroyed the genre with their digital monkey business
378;It is certainly the greatest desert film ever made.
379;Claude Rains comes to mind, of course, but virtually every role is filled by the best British stars of the war generation.
380;The cinematography is breathtaking, even today when we have all been everywhere through television.
381;Bolt's script works, balancing the sweep of the epic structure with numerous moving, personal scenes between two or three characters.
382;Surely it is one of the greatest and most memorable of all soundtracks, a haunting, powerful evocation of the Arab peoples.
383;In terms of politics, the film is provocative, anticipating political correctness by some thirty years in its depiction of the clash of cultures.
384;Lawrence himself was devoted to the cultures he visited, so the theme is built into this sensitive portrayal of a most extraordinary of men.
385;the movie: A few items that particularly interested me:1.)
386;ray version of Lawrence of Arabia is stunning.
387;The color saturation and tones are perfect.
388;The level of detail is so fine at times that it is almost as if you are seeing the characters and scenes in real life.
389;This is exactly what a viewer wants with a movie full of scenic vistas and exotic locations, like this one.
390;The sound is also superb, with distinct dialogue and a soundtrack that soars.
391;Thank you, Sony, for doing justice to this remarkable film.
392;This is one of the best blu.
393;ray transfers I have seen of an old classic.
394;A great film that shows the world one of the real odd birds that the British Military puts out every once in a while.
395;The story resists this impluse and so makes itself a legend in itself.
396;Lawrence Of Arabia is easily one of the best movies ever made.
397;It's my favorite David Lean picture.
398;The movie is based on a true story about T. e. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole, Oscar.
399;The movie is so damn long, but I saw all parts of it and it was great.
400;Lawrence Of Arabia is the winner of 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director (David Lean).
401;with the success of """"The Bridge on the River Kwai"""", both producer Sam Spiegel and David Lean decided to take on a film that would be based on the life of T. e. Lawrence."""
402;And lead to even more success in supporting Lawrence's dream of an independent Arabia.
403;"but around the world, the greatest honor for T. e. Lawrence was David Leane's film ""Lawrence of Arabia"" with the magnificent performance of actor Peter O'Toole as T. e. Lawrence."
404;"While in Britain, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" would receive five ""British Academy Film Awards"" nominations and would win four including ""Best Film from Any Source"", ""Best British Film"", ""Best British Actor"" and ""Best British Screenplay""."
405;while the film has received quite a bit of editing to shorten its duration in the '60s and '70s, a 216.
406;"vIDEO:The anticipation has been high for videophiles and cinema fans for the ""Lawrence of Arabia"" Blu."
407;"Rarely do you get to see films that receive a digital restoration that receives an 8K scan/4K intermediate digital restoration but in order to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of ""Lawrence of Arabia"", Sony Pictures Home Entertainment definitely went all out."
408;"The details and the overall look of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is beautiful."
409;Flesh tones are now natural instead of soft, black levels are nice and deep and the colors really pop when it comes to scenery, especially with Lawrence walking through the desert.
410;Possibly the biggest difference that I personally noticed with the soundtrack is Maurice Jarr's musical score.
411;The music sounds absolutely fantastic via lossless.
412;wind, Sand and Star: The Making of a Classic .
413;"jUDGMENT CALL:When it comes to renown epics, David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is one of the most amazing films ever created."
414;"From its beautiful cinematography, its impressive and moving musical score and its powerful acting by Peter O'Toole, believe it or not, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" was a major risk."
415;"the cinematography by Freddie Young (""Doctor Zhivago"", ""You Only Live Twice"", ""Battle of Britain"") is vast, beautiful and amazing."
416;The shots of Lawrence in his robe walking through the desert is breathtaking.
417;"But the music by Maurice Jarr (""Ghost"", ""Doctor Zhivago"", ""Dead Poets Society"") is equally fantastic as it creates the mood before the film begins, but is rich, emotional and moving."
418;for any cinema fan, you can easily see how this film is a masterpiece by taking a character, that probably is not well.
419;known outside of Britain and craft a story with a unique vision by filmmaker David Lean and given incredible life and once again, adding yet another masterpiece to the filmmakers oeuvre.
420;david Lean is one of the few filmmakers of that era who has been able to make his films appreciated throughout the world because of his grand vision and big ideas that influenced many significant filmmakers today.

422;but it's impressive how far things have come with the release of this film, considering that over 20.
423;"length version and the best presentation of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" yet."
424;This is a magnificent release of the film and while I am aware of the debate by scholars of the historical accuracy of the film, the fact is that the film's screenplay was based on one man's writings and human nature has shown that there is a stretching of truth at times for well.
425;"but the fact is that ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a unique undertaking and will continue to be seen as one of the grandest epic films created in cinema history."
426;"ray release is a true and wonderful celebration for the 50th anniversary of ""Lawrence of Arabia""."
427;understated in many ways, this film maintains an amazing humanity, filled with pathos and dignity.
428;It is deserving of a considered viewing.
429;Since then and periodically I have revisited this classic and have come to the conclusion that had David Lean never made another movie after this.
430;he would still be considered one of the genius of cinema.
431;Keep in mind that this film influenced a young Steven Spielberg to enter the field of filmmaking (in fact he and Martin Scorsese had contributed to its restoration).
432;And Peter O'Toole's debut performance is still one of the greatest ever captured on film!!
433;"Aurally and visually arresting with much food for thought,""Lawrence Of Arabia"" deserves to be in the top ten of great films that the AFI have designated along with ""Godfather"" and ""Citizen Kane""."
434;Since there are countless reviews of the film (which is amazing, gorgeous, and thrilling beyond compare!)
435;complete opening, intermission, and closing music.
436;but it does provide subtitles in a variety of languages which I think is always a nice addition.
437;It was worth the extra cost.
438;The book was a nice coffee table type book.
439;I wish there had been more substance to the book and more interviews in the specials but I was very happy with what was there.

445;It is a dramatic adaptation, but most of the events in the movie really happened.
446;Sound track and other features added to enjoyment.
447;This is simply an amazing film of such grand sweep and majesty that superlatives are not sufficient to describe it.
448;Lawrence of Arabia is simply the best film ever made.
449;Lawrence Of Arabia is perfection.
450;This film is my choice for the best movie ever made.
451;With its gorgeous photography, memorable score (from Maurice Jarr ), great script (from Robert Bolt amongst others), meticulous direction (from David Lean), and memorable performances from Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quayle, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif, this is a film to savor.
452;but this is redeemed by Lean's determination to provide a warts.
453;Excellent job on this porting to Blu.
454;All in all, pretty good stuff.
455;The gods of cinema and of film restoration blessed film and Blu.
456;Lawrence was the centerpiece of my film class unit on epic/war films so I saw it twice a day on some occasions.
457;ray would be worth every one.
458;initially, I was impressed by the complex brilliance of Peter O'Toole's characterization ( for me, the best of the decade and of his career) and Robert Bolt's and Michael Wilson's fine compression of Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom , rendered through Freddie Young's superlative cinematography and Maurice Jarre's haunting score, all unerringly supervised with consummate vigor, taste and grace by David Lean at the peak of his career.
459;Lean, Young, Jarre and editor Anne Coates won well deserved Oscars, as did the film itself.
460;Claude Rains's elegant chess player of a diplomat emerges as the prototype of the British and French imperialists who carved up the remains of the Ottoman Empire into the unsteady states afflicted by tribalism and factionalism that we see today.
461;in an all male cast anchored by Alec Guinness's supremely intelligent and smooth as silk Prince Feisal, Omar Sharif of the elegantly liquid eyes offers the possibility of parliamentary democracy and Anthony Quinn, Hollywood's all purpose ethnic brawler, is his opportunistic and tribal.
462;anne Coates's razor sharp and always judicious editing is even more notable in this majestic Blu.
463;"Behold it and wish that you could step into the screen
464;See it in a theater!A vastly experienced guerilla leader with a gifted political and cultural understanding of the the desert.
465;But the book, just like the lengthy movie, is worth the effort for a peek into the desert nomad's mind.
466;Amazing how the movie reflected Lawrence's personal accounts!
467;after visiting some parts of Arabia and United Arab Emirates, I find the movie still holds true to the geopolitical area it covers.
468;The Arab world is unique and fascinating: a barren, unforgiving land that creates basic, philosophical, and spiritual human conditions.
469;Great acting by all involved.
470;A great novel, rich in detail.
471;If you ever get to see it on the big screen by all means go!
472;Director David Lean's film's leave you satisfied after viewing.
473;This version of LOA kicks ass!
474;The acting, the locations, and of course the music were all superlative.
475;As noted in the product description, the set includes a """"making of"""" book, the soundtrack, a film frame, and loads of extras."""
476;The film itself looks great in blu.
477;Some fans might not like that as it might not look quite like the Lawrence they all know and love, but it really helps bring out the stark colors in the movie.
478;If you love this movie, this set is a must.
479;I was in high school at the time and I was overwhelmed by the film.
480;The film is first rate and is probably the best film I've ever seen.
481;Peter O'Toole is excellent as Lawrence but it is the photography that gives this film its greatness.
482;it was all done the old fashioned way and it was done superbly!
483;Maurice Jarre's score is unforgettable.
484;"The Limited Edition contains extra documentaries and ""making of"" features."
485;The extra features on the limited edition are nice, but you'll probably only watch them once.
486;Even the Superbit version has some flaws in mastering, but it is cleaner and clearer, so bear this in mind.
487;But whereas the Lord of the Rings had to rely on digital trickery for its vast battle scenes, Lawrence shows real people, hundreds if not thousands, in a story that is both a sweeping epic and a personal journey.
488;(Much like Lord of the Rings.)
489;more relevant than ever now, with our intense involvement in the Middle East.
490;It's beautifully filmed, directed and acted.
491;This box set is amazing.
492;It comes in a nicely designed box with three Blu.
493;ray disk contains a new restoration of the entire film, along with intermission.
494;the box set was worth the wait.
495;Lawrence of Arabia is universally acknowledged as one of the greatest biographies in film history .
496;a brilliantly nuanced and insightful portrait of one of the 20th century's most compelling and enigmatic figures.
497;Of course, it is also one of the great spectacle films .
498;"providing sights as epic and stirring as any found in ""Lord of the Rings"", with the added impact of being absolutely real and (with sad certainty) of a kind never to be seen again."
499;Yet amazingly, it is also one of the greatest love stories.
500;And in fairness, the film does celebrate the virtues of courage and fortitude from a purely masculine point of view.
501;as any woman who has given childbirth can tell you.]
502;legendary intro shot as swoon.
503;But when Lawrence heroically brings Gasim out of the Nefud, Ali can finally give up his proud heart.

505;set to the silent music of a dream too beautiful to last .
506;also one of the greatest philosophical dramas.
507;the conflict impulsively expressing itself as clownish displays of foppish eloquence.
508;Like the Prince, Lawrence finds no triumph in the achievement of his quest .
509;As you can probably tell by now, this film is an epic in many ways other than running time and number of extras.
510;sized screen, you will only experience its greatness in translation.
511;And once you do, people will be able to say of you .
512;Lawrence of Arabia is a rare and masterful film that few directors can bring to the screen in all its glorious facets.
513;Of course, what can I say about Director David Lean, except to thank him for his amazing accomplishment.
514;I think a film like this stands the test of time, like a fine work of art.
515;And the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking.
516;Many thanks to Maurice Jarre for a moving score!!
517;The music is just unforgettable .
518;perhaps the greatest movie sound track ever.
519;Two of the greatest scenes ever filmed are in this film .
520;All indications are that this restoration is fantastic.
521;Adventure, ideals, action, beautiful scenery, suspense, music, script.
522;This film has it all.
523;Nonetheless the movie was riveting.
524;Now seeing it again at age 70, with some accumulated knowledge of both subjects, it is truly spellbinding.
525;"This has to be one of the greatest films ever
526;whatever one's political persuasion about the present turbulent Middle East and The West's role in it, one can gain a feeling, an insight into the people and region from this film that simply cannot be conveyed in print.
527;The film imagery of the agile camel rider Omar Sharif and the robust horseman Anthony Quinn is stunning.
528;This is a new perception, that of Arab as athletic, splendid.
529;I think a perfect companion read would be David Pryce.
530;ray edition of """"Lawrence of Arabia"""" is absolutely Blu."""
531;The long delay has been worth the wait and is most gratifying.
532;ray edition stuns the eyes.
533;It is as perfect a Blu.
534;ray film as I've ever seen, and a great relief it is, since I've been disappointed by Blu.
535;But still, the reds are perfectly sharp and are more stunning than garish.
536;This has to be one of the finest Blu.
537;"Terrific performance by Peter O'Toole
538;T. e. Lawrence was perhaps the first perfect example of a mass.
539;an achievement which prepared him very well for service in the Middle East by 1916.
540;it took almost two years to finish filming director David Lean's epic masterpiece.
541;And this will always be better seen on a wide screen.
542;It is a place that can only be conquered by those with the right fortitude of body and mind, and in the film Peter O'Toole (as Lawrence) demonstrates (or should one say.
543;In campaigns in the desert, Lawrence inspired his men with his willingness to share their extreme hardships, and fought on even after being flogged by the local pederastic Bey in Dera (played by Jose Ferrer), and perhaps because of that incident, it transformed him into a more complex man.
544;By showing how he transformed a motley gang of tribesmen into an effective guerilla force and becoming the chief strategist for the whole Bedouin army, temporarily converting its self.
545;It is just one of the spectacular scenes in this film.
546;though it never tried to explain why he was impelled sometimes to embellish his achievement and then repudiate the fame they offered him, this is one great film about one chapter in the life of an enigmatic and complex man.
547;This film defies description as it needs to be seen to be believed!
548;Everything about it is magical and if you thought director David Lean's work on """"Bridge Over the River Kwai"""" was good """"Lawrence of Arabia"""" even surpasses that great work handily and is his crowning achievement in an excellent career of films."""
549;The cast is brilliant, the screenplay excellent, the camerawork inspired making this a film fully deserving of its 7 Oscars and like a true classic never shows its age making for a thoroughly enjoyable viewing experience and greatly rewards repeated viewing.
550;disc version is also a treat as it comes with good making.
551;lover can go without having this film in their library and this is a must see for all film buffs.
552;ray version will be and I wait with bated breath!
553;Lawrence of Arabia is easily one of the greatest films ever made and there are plenty of reviews and comments already out there, so here's my review of the 50th Anniversary Blu.
554;It looks and sounds absolutely stunning.
555;The Anniversary packaging is very nice and the book looks great, though I've only browsed through it so far.
556;ups and they were pretty good.
557;One of the best films ever.
558;I rank it right with his The Bridge on the River Kwai.
559;Both films are magnificent on Blu.
560;", it was with great pleasure that I discovered that the evening's entertainment was ""Lawrence of Arabia."""
561;scenes crew is truly enlightening, as are the comments of Steven Spielberg.
562;Quayle's sterling performance complements and completes this phenomenal ensemble cast.
563;This is an amazing story brought to the screen by an amazing Director and a Fantastic Cast.
564;The filming of this film is a real feast to the eyes, Especially now that it's on Blu Ray.
565;The score is more brilliant then I've ever hear it before.
566;In making such a study, one inevitably and repeatedly encounters the name T. e. Lawrence, then and now one of the most controversial military figures of the 20th Century, a remarkably complex man who combined an unassuming manner with an astonishing flair for self.
567;Still, between the press coverage and the man's own gift for self.
568;It is the myth, a vision of Lawrence as he himself wished to be seen, and the covert indications of his hidden nature adds greater depth to both his character and the film as a whole: as the story progresses we become acutely aware that there is much more that we do not know, a fact that lends a tremendous sense of mystery to the film.
569;But in its entirety, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA achieves an artistic truth that transcends any mere notation of fact pure and simple.
570;it is, in my opinion, the single finest film of epic scope to ever reach the screen.
571;The episodic story, scripted by Robert Bolt (author of A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS), casts a remarkably wide net, not only following Lawrence's adventures but placing them within a finely drawn context of diplomacy as well.
572;David Lean's direction is flawless, as is the astonishingly beautiful cinematography, artful yet unobtrusive editing, and truly memorable score.
573;"it is true that LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is best seen on the big screen, where its visual power may be seen a full power
574;pristine picture and excellent sound, and I recommend for those who are not greatly interested in the history of the film itself.
575;scan versions do a tremendous disservice to both the film and the viewer.
576;An unedited presentation of overture, intermission, and exit music is also included to great effect.
577;alternatively languid and violent, beautiful and disquieting, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is a remarkably fine film that deserves every praise heaped upon it since its 1962 release.
578;It is one of the greatest and most honored epic films of all time.
579;Boy, those where the days.
580;It is all for real.
581;(Thats what I love about The Dark Knight Rises.
582;I find that scene breathtaking.)
583;And everything in Lawrence of Arabia is breathtaking as well.
584;It was and still is a spectacular achievement.
585;if you have the money to spend, I really recommend this 50th.
586;ray is gorgeous, the best I've seen.
587;There are three other discs, one of which is the beautiful soundtrack of this film.
588;There is a new interview with Peter O'Toole on the film and a Martin Scorcese discussion of the film as well.
589;There is a very nice short feature on the various advertising campaigns for the film.
590;And numerous other special features.
591;finally, there is a new, beautiful hard.
592;Finally, there is a frame of film from the picture, nicely packaged and included as well.
593;ray, this is the way to go.
594;one of the greatest movies ever made!You won't be disappointed.
595;This 'restored' version of the film looked as good as I remember the original looking in the theater!
596;The music is still echoing in my head over two weeks after watching it!
597;I would highly recommend this version of Lawrence of Arabia to anyone seeking an excellent, high.
598;I know it's an additional $20 for the dual.
599;My memory of the motion picture Lawrence of Arabia goes back to seeing it in glorious 70mm at a first run theatre in Philadelphia back in the '60s.
600;The viewing experience doesn't quite come up to seeing in 70mm on a huge screen in a theatre, but it's as good as it gets on a home screen.
601;This is certainly one of the movies that I would call art.
602;It was called the first """"thinking man's epic"""" and to this day, can probably still hold that claim."""
603;"Probably because, it wasn't afraid to be nearly 4hrs long (before miniseries or BBC serials), because Robert Bolt (of ""Man for All Seasons"" fame) did a literate script adaptation, and of course, because of the glorious cinematography, editing, soundtrack, and competent acting."
604;He was a masochist, extremely intelligent, and made sure he had great physical endurance.
605;Wilson's bio is probably the best.
606;Peck is good for a psychoanalysis.
607;And Cave also did good documentary work.
608;But the original is best.
609;This quote comes from Lawrence early in the film and it shows us that this story is basically a character study of Lawrence, which also applies to many other great warriors, explorers and others who confront great physical and psychological hardship while attempting to accomplish great and important things.
610;regarding the film, I can only agree that it is a pleasure to watch.
611;we also see the usual criticism of the British military mentality we have come to associate with David Lean films.
612;all, a film that lives up to its reputation as one of the greatest of all time.
613;You're in for a treat.
614;Award winning acting and script.
615;like many films in theaters in the 1960's this one comes with a break in the middle, an intermission.
616;If the length of this film is too much for you for one sitting, break it up by watching to the intermission, then come back later and finish it.
617;Peter O'Toole is the enigmatic T. e. Lawrence.
618;It is an indelible performance.
619;The entire film is mesmerizing and captivating from the opening to final shot.
620;This is David Lean's masterpiece.
621;Maurice Jarre's score is a true classic evoking images that are eternally grained into our memories.
622;The movie focuses on Lawrence's fiercely independent and enigmatic spirit, which rebelled against the British regime under which he served, yet enabled him to be successful in his mission.
623;Lawrence goes against the grain by treating the Arabs with respect, despite their unfamiliarity with the guns, machines and bombs of modern warfare, and successfully forges important alliances with their leaders.
624;He secures their enduring respect and near religious devotion by risking his life for others, and accomplishing the impossible.
625;Lawrence's own character struggles and development are the focus, as is his interaction with Arab and British leaders.
626;With epic cinematography that leaves you feeling the desert wind and heat, viewers feel exposed to the elements as Lawrence was.
627;"The fierce conditions in the desert and wild passions of the Arabs are wonderfully contrasted with the strict military discipline of the British army at their base with their generals sipping tea, and priding themselves in mundane achievements (""We've just built a new squash court"")."
628;There are a few battles scenes, featuring thunderous hooves, rifle shots, and war whoops, in an epic sequences involving thousands of men, camels and horses.
629;But on the whole the movie is about the man Lawrence, his passions and eccentric personality.
630;But this aside, it's a wonderful movie with adventure, epic sequences, extraordinary scenery, and good characterization.
631;Most memorable are portrait of the man Lawrence (Peter O'Toole was relatively unknown prior to this film, but produced an immense performance in the starring role) and the spectacle of the harsh desert scenery (no doubt best viewed on the big screen!)
632;The passion of the characters, conflicts and cinematography are as powerful today as they were in 1962.
633;It's no wonder that this movie won seven Academy Awards in its time, and thirty years later is still regarded by many as one of the top ten of all time movie classics.
634;But even if it's somewhat of a mirage, this classic is worth digging up from the desert of the past to watch all over again.
635;and in a stunning new transfer to boot!
636;As for bonus features, pretty.
637;all in all, this is easily the best version of the film to pickup.
638;even at a glance at the AFI's roster of classic films, it was pretty clear that a wide variety of subjects, styles and genres would be open to us.
639;We began our series with CASABLANCA, certainly a classic of its era.
640;but one that caught its audience, the critics and, yes, even the actors and filmmakers by surprise.
641;Cinema can do many things, and in the right hands, a screen epic can be a wondrous thing to behold.
642;that separated CASABLANCA and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, the two films do have a number of points in common: both speak to a certain fascination with exotic locales, the machinations and intrigues of war, and both pose questions about the nature of heroism and sacrifice.
643;And is it just coincidence, that both feature veteran character actor Claude Rains in co. starring roles?
644;LAWRENCE OF ARABIA remains one of the most widely respected and influential films ever made.
645;While some have questioned its historical accuracy, others have championed its cinematic beauty (and, yes, this is definitely one to view in letterbox format).
646;its visual style has influenced directors as diverse as Martin Scorsese, Sam Peckinpah and George Lucas.
647;"the film is also noted for its literate screenplay (another trait it shares with CASABLANCA and so many other ""classic films"") and for Peter O'Toole's impressive star turn in the title role."
648;O'Toole had appeared in smaller roles in three movies prior to making this film.
649;and the rest, as they say, is movie history.
650;"it probably can be said in more recent years, ""epics"" tend to be more in the sci."
651;fi and fantasy realm, with the vert occasional historical filmsurfacing from time to time.
652;one of the last true examples of the genre.
653;What a fantastic job they did with the presentation of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA on its 50th anniversary.
654;Background noisesare easily distinguished well not overpowering the vocal tracks.
655;the image is superb and it shows a studio dedicated to getting it right.
656;ray release outdoes them all easily.
657;"The interview with Peter O'Toole wasquit good along with the ""making of"" which was slightly over an hour in length."
658;if you love the movie and have a blu.
659;If you want a slice of a slice of the events of WWI or you want to see how history is repeating itself, this is well worth the having to fast forward during the interminable desert crossings.
660;Peter O'Toole is magnificent as is Omar Sharif.
661;The book, Lawrence In Arabia is a must for anyone wanting to learn more.
662;This is probably the best movie I've ever seen!
663;The cast used in this movie is outstanding in playing their roles.
664;It's brilliantly shot, edited, scored, acted, and directed.
665;It's a literate, intelligent epic, and it was a box office smash.
666;It shows that audiences can indeed appreciate (even though this was 1962) a great film if given the opportunity.
667;Films like this inspire people to be great, to go beyond what they think they can do and do the impossible.
668;The director David Lean and the screenwriter Robert Bolt are both British, and they should be commended for telling the truth about Lawrence.
669;It makes you feel more for the man than a sanitized biography would have.
670;They thought it was one of the greatest films they've ever seen in their lives, and they were right.
671;A good film is a good film, regardless of the length.
672;I would rather sit through a great 5 hour film than a 90 minute piece of [.]
673;I have a Dolby Digital sound system and watched it on a large screen using a video projector, and it was a spectacular treat to watch and hear!
674;David Lean was truly a master, and this was one of his very best.
675;star cast (including Alec Guinness, Jose Ferrer and Claude Raines), there is plenty to see and hear.
676;O'Toole is simply handsome and completely reckless as Lawrence, as daring as the man himself, I dare say.
677;He radiates charisma, fire and passion in every scene.
678;Omar Sharif (who would go on to greater fame as Doctor Zhivago several years later) is simply outstanding as Sherif Ali.
679;"hur""), Claude Raines is practical as Dryden, George Kennedy is loyal to the last as Colonel Harry Brighton and the rest of the cast and crew (especially costume designer Phyllis Dalton) did a remarkable and fantastic job on this movie."
680;The transfer shows it, one of the best Blu Ray movies ever.
681;The story is exciting and moving, A five star recommendation.
682;Excellent movie that never ages.
683;great , clear , and vivid colours in blue rayVery enjoyable to watch again and a again
684;There are other editions of this film (special editions, etc.) but the single disc is a real bargain.
685;The remastering of this film as presented in the single disc version is simply fantastic.
686;The picture is sharp and clear and the colors are rich and accurate.
687;then the single disc version is a real bargain for this masterpiece.
688;This is movie is an excellent WWI desert war film.
689;What a strange character but he gets the job done.
690;He gets the job done but whose job is it in reality?
691;Jos Ferrer as the Bey is perfect as the homosexual Turkish commander who leaves an indelible mark on Lawrence.
692;This film is complex and perplexing in nature.
693;This is probably David Lean's greatest directorial effort.
694;This is simply , a towering movie.
695;Just a few films show with so splendor the epical sense as this one.
696;all the cast was incredible.
697;When he arrives with the half dead man , he states those brilliant lines: the destiny is just right here and he touches his head.
698;The hero has completed his mission , has completed his own cycle and the time comes for him to fade .
699;"this work is much more than simply an extarordinary film 
700;Lawrence is a rather """"odd"""" or """"fantastic"""" man, depending upon your taste."""
701;The many fine actors make even lesser roles fun to watch.
702;ray edition of Lawrence of Arabia is spectacular in every way.
703;The clarity, minute detail and brilliant color of the picture made it difficult to believe I was watching a fifty.year.
704;Every facet of the filmmaker's art is showcased here at an extreme level of competence and inspiration.
705;Lawrence of Arabia's revered status with film fans can only be further enhanced by this high definition re.
706;With the success of his 1957 Bridge On the River Kwai (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor Alec Guinness) the necessary funding became available.
707;The effort and expense were rewarded with another raft of Oscars for 1962, including Best Picture, Director, Cinematography, Editing, Musical Score, Art Direction and Sound.
708;two of the ten special features are exclusive to the Blu.
709;ray, one being an interview with Peter O'Toole many years after the film was made.
710;It is an extensive combination of commentary, maps and historic photographs.
711;These are all intercut and superimposed on live action from the film, from opening scene to closing credits, including soundtrack.
712;This extra feature offers superb detail, allowing one to construct a more nearly complete and accurate story.
713;this is a superb Blu.
714;ray production, fully worthy of an exceptional film.
715;Perhaps in the near future they can put the whole movie onto one disc.
716;Transfer is pretty good to my non.
717;this is the true story of T. e. Lawrence, a smart.
718;The rest of the cast is really just supporting, but the overall acting should have at least been awarded some Academy brass.
719;anyone who's seen the Sergio Leone westerns can enjoy this film from start to almost the finish, because the cinematography is amazing.
720;The sweeping desert dunes and sandstorms and rocks is incredible.
721;To add to an already great look, Maurice Jarre's breathtaking musical score further amplifies the feel of the film to an epic level.
722;At first from all the hype and some background into the story, I thought this was going to be a fun Indiana Jones.
723;type adventure with plenty of action, shown in an entertaining way.
724;Yes, this is a war film set in WWI, but this is more of a war drama than an adventurous action romp.
725;It deals primarily with Lawrence's turmoil of being a soldier first and a human being second.
726;, and at the moment of his returning with the man it creates the most memorable scene of the whole film.
727;i would highly reccomend this one for anyone who appriciates great cinema.
728;A sweeping look at a man who was made by the Great War.
729;lawrence, working with Prince Faisal, did manage to organize the Arabs after a fashion to attack the Turks but the Arabs were using the British as much as the British were using the Arabs.
730;the movie is a great action film but not necessarily great history.
731;Lawrence was successful because he took up the Arab cause as his own.
732;so, why 5 stars?As a film it's superb cinematic art.
733;A rousing story, exotic locations beautifully lensed with an exceptional cast headed by a star.
734;David Lean was a master at the top of his game when he made 'Lawrence' and managed to meld a sprawling epic with a highly personal drama.
735;ray format which preserves the richness and depth of the original 70mm image.
736;If you love this movie then you must see it fully restored.
737;This is arguably Sir David Lean's greatest work .
738;a great film among other greats, such asThe Bridge on the River KwaiandDoctor Zhivago.
739;Part of Lean's skillfulness as a filmmaker was his ability to bring a story to life no matter what its scale.
740;lean's films are rich in story, character development, and sense of place and time .
741;and Lawrence of Arabia, especially, excels in all these ways.
742;With the backdrop of the Arabian desert, Lawrence of Arabia is perhaps the most visually striking of all of Lean's films, and the political context in which it takes place, along with the depth and complexity of Lawrence's character, add immeasurably to the richness of the film.
743;For those who are interested in teasing apart what's fact and what's fiction, Wikipedia and other sources offer more details.
744;obviously, the great scope of historical events and the range of events in an individual's life must be pared down to fit within the context of a film (and even a longer one, such as this).
745;Though people may argue about how appropriately this was accomplished, that this film is a great artistic achievement is beyond question.
746;O'Toole is perfect for role.
747;The cinematography is just amazing.
748;The film is at its greatest when it immerses you in the stark beauty of the desert.
749;lawrence was a wild man no doubt, with the passions of a British Tommy prophet and the self.
750;doubt of any man, constantly questioning himself, and always going back for more.
751;I think the movie touched on that well.
752;This movie captures his adventurous side, and the wickedness of politics when the fate of entire country is at stake.
753;The Good: This may well be the greatest film ever made.
754;The story is based on the real life exploits of T. e. Lawrence during WWI.
755;"The music by Maurice Jarre sounds amazing on a 5.1 surround system
756;Production values are also high.
757;the locations are absolutely majestic.
758;rOM features an interactive map that allows you to trace the actual journey of Lawrence and provides actual historical photos of his exploits in Arabia.
759;The first thing that strikes the viewer about this movie is the stunning cinematography.
760;Sand dunes and rocky crags stand in the background of the film with grim oppressiveness as well as stunning beauty, either pressing down on the small humans wandering among them or embracing them depending on the circumstances.
761;Just as important as the climate are the characters, and to fill these roles Lean chose his cast very wisely.
762;The venerable Alec Guinness injects an air of gravitas mixed with incredible humor into his role as Prince Feisal, a central figure to the Bedouin tribes.
763;Claude Rains, Jose Ferrer, and Jack Hawkins turn up in critical roles, too.
764;By all accounts, T. e. Lawrence was an incredibly enigmatic, complex individual impervious to definitive character study.
765;He is, in other words, an everyman and an extraordinary man with the same strengths and foibles we all share to some degree.
766;What impressed me most about the film.
767;No woman emerges to cast her charms on our lead character, which is incredible for any film.
768;Four featurettes, a documentary, original newsreel footage, and a few other odds and ends will keep you glued to the television set long after the movie ends.
769;An epic that Hollywood probably couldn't pull off today, """"Lawrence of Arabia"""" is an exceptional piece of cinema every fan of the medium should watch at least once."""
770;This is an epic and powerful tale, both an international political thriller and an interpersonal drama about the amazing character T. e. Lawrence.
771;Lawrence of Arabia is a masterpiece that manages to impart an important history lesson in addition to some outstanding cinematography, brilliant acting by Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, and Sir Alec Guinness, beautiful landscape vistas, many quotable exchanges, and an intense character study of the conflicted T. e. Lawrence.
772;Every scene served an important function.
773;I think the film is even greater due to these warts and imperfections.
774;The lack of a female lead makes the movie great, because it is realistic, and not contrived to some Hollywood standard movie formula.
775;time best movies in American cinema.
776;This film shows so much going on in those days, and Lawrence's own actions were well beyond those that most people could even do, but he did them and came out okay .
777;The film is a big one, but is worth its size since it shows so much so interestingly and so well acted and shown to us.
778;This movie is so fantastic.
779;A story of perserverence and determination, and a story of fighting to build a new beauty on an ancient canvass.
780;War, and Arabian culture, and British pride express themselves over magnificent desert scenery.
781;It is inspirational and beautiful and tragic.
782;The desert is brought to life in this epic.
783;David Lean does a fantastic job in casting and directing, and Peter O'Toole is perfect.
784;Laurence of Arabia is a movie that everyone should watch.
785;The merits of the film itself go without saying but the blu.
786;ray is breathtaking in its own right.
787;David Lean's epic film shines in every frame.
788;I have no problem saying that Lawrence of Arabia is one of the best looking catalogue releases available on the blu ray format.
789;Maurice Jarre's unforgettable score comes to life in a way that could on be surpassed by seeing the film in a high caliber theater.
790;It's expensive but completely worth it for diehard Lawrence of Arabia fans.
791;good movie, I like very much.
792;I know this movie by heart and so I appreciate this edition of it.
793;I particularly enjoyed the interviews with the stars as well as the making of it.
794;Lawrence is visually astounding, with panoramic desert vistas and jaw.
795;Beyond the epic elements, legendary director, David Lean snatched the promising newcomer Peter O'Toole to star as the desert dwelling Brit.
796;Lean surrounds the young actor with a top cast including Omar Sharif (in his first English.
797;But O'Toole, handsome and assured in the lead, carries the film, conveying the essential mystery of this heroic figure.
798;I highly recommend the movie to any David Lean fan.
799;"David Lean is among my handful of favorite directors
800;The wonderful performance Lean extracted from newcomer Peter O'Toole is amazing, and the great collection of supporting actors includes Claude Rains, Jose Ferrer, Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins and Anthony Quinn.
801;ray restored edition is stunning and includes several excellent extras.
802;I really can't add much to what is already known about this movie, but I will say that Peter O'Toole is the most glorious actor in the history of motion pictures.
803;How much more can one accomplish after making a masterpiece?
804;The scenery is simply stupendous and all the other actors are almost as good as O'Toole.
805;Epic in scope and superbly acted and directed.
806;Just love these old movies.
807;This one is a classic and one of Peter O'Tooles best.
808;This is one of my favorite movies and the restored version makes it even better.
809;Beautiful scenery and wonderful acting, no wonder it won so many awards.
810;excellent directino by lean, great acting, excellent script.
811;the long running time is well worth the watch.
812;Lawrence of Arabia is a legendary movie.
813;Watching the film and it's imagery, it's clear that a movie theatre would do the best justice to it.
814;but few people will actually have a chance to see this in the theatre.
815;Hard to believe since the picture in this film looks so good, it could have been filmed last year.
816;He's an actor like William Hurt or John Malkovich.
817;In my personal opinion, Lawrence of Arabia is, above all, one of the most beautiful films ever made.
818;Its cinematography is almost poetic in the way it pans over the vast desert landscapes.
819;top heroic score that would seem more suited for a movie like The Mummy Returns.
820;It works here though and makes these scenes even better.
821;The movie is well acted and truly deserves the title of """"one of the best films ever made."""""""
822;If it played at my local multiplex, I'd definitely go.
823;hour movies than it is for me to watch 1, 4.
824;It's a great movie, though, and one that people should definitely see.
825;It took two years to film, involved thousands of extras and even the construction of an entire city.
826;It comes with a documentary and the aforementioned Spielberg interview.
827;This is the greatest epic film not just because of the sheer manpower involved in making it but also because of a subtle and magnificent script by playwright Robert Bolt, legendary performances by young Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif, and mind.
828;Therefore, the Columbia Classics version is best overall.
829;O'Toole at his finest as The lead character.
830;Action and top notch cast.
831;The best movie ever made, as great now as when I first saw it in 1962.
832;Some technical details have been improved, all of which are immaterial to the superb story.
833;At the heart of this movie's success however is a compelling and true story of a man who became a leader when he found himself in the midst of chaos.
834;The story of Lawrence of Arabia is a metaphor for life, applicable to recorded history as well as the individual lives we all live in the 20th and 21st century.
835;this movie is a great contribution to human civilization.
836;that's how good a movie played by the british actors could achieved.
837;enhanced the scenes, the characters, the story so seamlessly perfect.
838;two word to describe this movie: forever amazing!
839;The film is a big, sweeping epic of duty, discovery and nature.
840;he was magnetic, and displayed all the right nuances of a conflicted officer during the First World War.
841;time favorite film (co. favorite is GWTW).
842;I get very emotional, so pls. bear with me.
843;peter O'Toole is so perfect, so great in his destined, born.
844;Unforgettably classic performance in unforgettable classic film.
845;"The restoration of 1988.89 is almost like a miracle, seeing it almost whole again
846;This is one of the greatest.
847;I've loved Lawrence of Arabia ever since I saw the restored version in theaters in 1988.
848;It's wonderful to have this top.
849;ray for the best experience of it outside of a theater.
850;he was the illegitimate son of a well.
851;who starts out taking the traditional view that It is written.
852;Lawrence's return into the searing heat on 'The Anvil' to rescue Gasim (though indeed based on a real.
853;life incident) also stands as a metaphor for man's place in the universe, the social outsider making his own rules, the contrast between the values of the Arabs and of their European allies, and provides a commentary on the self.
854;discovery, and that this brilliantly understated 'sub.
855;text' is one of the primary reasons why the film has remained so popular for so long.
856;when this film was made, most people living in Britain still remembered at least a part of the age of the great British Empire.
857;with this idea in mind it is interesting to watch the interplay between the quintessential 'white man', Lawrence (even down to the colour of his robes) and the Arab 'hordes'.
858;Note, for example, Lawrence's several announcements that the Arabs shall have this or that because *he* will give it to them.
859;I find the film endlessly enthralling.
860;the screenplay, by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson, and David Lean's direction are as profound and intelligent as you will find in ANY film from any country at any time.
861;It's the most amazing film I've ever seen, with a FANTASTIC score (the main theme with the strings is GORGEOUS) and probably the best acting I've ever seen in my life.
862;purely phenomenal acting (and Omar Shariff was wonderful, too!)
863;I will always think very highly of this film.
864;Real movies, real backgrounds, real actors.
865;Not only is it an aweseom look at Lawrence, but it is also a fine look into WWI era history to see what was going on back then.
866;Having seen (and fallen in love with) this film when it was originally shown in theatres in 1962/63, I always wanted a copy of my own to relive the wonderful experience.

882;ray, in film restoration as well.
883;unknown actor Peter O'Toole's contribution in this film remain influential in the five decades since the film's initial release.
884;with a great film restoration as the basis, a digital scan in 4K resolution of the negative, and the great capacity and superior video and audio specs of a Blu.

886;perfect levels, making the gorgeous deep.
887;focus photography by Freddie Young an absolute pleasure to look at.
888;The overture, intermission, and the exit music are all played to a black screen, as per director David Lean's original wish.

891;A couple of surprises here.
892;new extra is a new 21.
893;"of documentary, a Steven Spielberg interview, a newreel of the New York premiere, a montage of publicity material, and vintage shorts ""The Camels Are Cast"" and ""Wind, Sand and Star""."
894;A nice touch: the disc case resembles Lawrence's diary in the movie.
895;David Lean's masterpiece is a beautifully artistic retelling of this piece of history.
896;But, I hope I can find a less starkly compressed version of this masterpiece of a movie.
897;ball, yet had a particular intensity about him that brought a lot of depth to the character, and real life persona of T. Lawrence.
898;The film also features a top notch ensemble including Omar Sharif, and others.

900;ray is superbly restored and looks fantastic.
901;disc collector's edition (which has the extras and the superbit version of the film which is an excellent version also) .
902;The box set is beautifully presented, the book is gorgeous, soundtrack is fantastic with two bonus tracks.

904;Not only do we get the fully restored Director's Cut, complete with the full orchestral introduction entre'act, letterboxed to view the full magnificence of the picture, the sound has been remastered wonderfully, the picture itself is sharp, vivid alive.
905;there are many fine reviews of this film, most of which are much better than I can write.
906;This collection though, is worth mentioning.
907;"The additional features are excellent, although sometimes redundant
908;The documentary itself is quite good and very informative.
909;this film is one of the greatest ever made.
910;This edition is the best yet.
911;If I was forced at gunpoint to name the best film ever made .
912;but this film, boys and girls, this film is more than film.
913;A man drawn to destiny, perhaps, at least in terms of this telling, and the people around him who were swept up in it with him.
914;If you liked Gladiator you will love Lawrence.
915;The scope, beauty, drama and O'Toole's manic performance will leave you amazed.
916;I consider this film, along with Seven Samurai, to be my favorite movie of all time.
917;What are you waiting for?David Lean directed this masterpiece and the film world doesn't give him nearly enough credit for it.
918;Definitely a great epic and an all time classic, Lawrence of Arabia, brings to the screen the story of Lt Lawrence a British military officer during WWI as he tries to unite the Arab Bedouin tribes against the military occupation of the Ottoman Turks.
919;There are no words to describe this multiple Oscar winning movie.
920;Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif (both major Hollywood heavyweights) as well as the rest of the cast truly outdid themselves in this one!
921;It is simply amazing how a movie made in 1962 surpasses by far most movies that have been made in later years.
922;one must keep in mind that these classics must never be compared with today's Matrix.
923;You and the couch and the whole 21st century will disappear into a timeless sea of sand turned red by the brutal conflict between the Ottoman Empire and the British Empire.
924;Not only are we entertained by the acting, the action, and the cinematography, but we can witness the very birth of the oil based geopolitical quagmire in which we live today.
925;He captures Lawrence's mannerisms, expressions, and words as they probably happened.
926;if you get a chance catch a showing on a big theatre screen, which alone can capture the grandeur of the locales that were transformed as the entire region was chopped up into the present day countries.
927;And how director, David Lean, brought this epic to the screen is a result of pure genius.
928;And thirst is something that the Bedouins learned to live with.
929;The film is full of adventure.
930;This all comes alive by a vision, one that had never been done on screen before.
931;It was an ambitious undertaking.
932;It's a refreshing difference to computer.
933;And a type of filming that we will not likely see again.
934;For that alone, the film stands as a testament to human ingenuity.
935;Some of the sound had been lost at that time and I found it fascinating as to how they brought back the actors to dub in their own voices again.
936;I love learning about all the background and hearing the actors talk about the experience.
937;Just make sure that you give yourself enough time to watch the film in its entirety.
938;And add on another couple of hours to see the special features.
939;You'll come away with an experience of your own that goes beyond merely watching a film.
940;Clearly, it rates one of my highest recommendations.
941;The line I always remembered best, from David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia , is said neither by nor to the eponymous Lawrence played by Peter O'Toole.
942;Here's a movie that really is a feast for the eyes, as nearly every few minutes there's an incredible shot of desert caravans or looting armies or a triumphant Lawrence ego.
943;the acting and the imagery was superb.
944;History is intertwined with biography in the film.
945;A great epic, beautiful and accurate.
946;In a world where we can only take YouTube videos for 10 minutes at a time, or have commercials that are a brief 30 seconds long, it's amazing to expect people to sit still for 217 minutes straight in order to watch a long, drawn out epic story.
947;It's much more subtle than that.
948;get yourself set up front for a long, thoughtful experience.
949;Watch this on a widescreen TV if at all possible so you get the full sweeping experience of the hot desert, the enormous landscapes.
950;This movie really does transport you to another world .
951;this really is a journey.
952;As he went, he grows, matures, and learns to take a stand.
953;it is up to each of us, as a human, to make a stand for what we believe in.
954;The messages from the early 20th century are just as meaningful today.
955;Peter O'Toole is so wonderful in this epic drama involving a man who takes over a group of Arabs and teaches them how to fight for what they want, not for England but for Arabia.
956;He is conceited but in a good way.
957;He has to be in the limelight and believes that he is blessed to overcome all obstacles.
958;Lawrence of Arabia is one of the finest films ever made.
959;It lacks a happy ending, but it is one of the most beautiful, sweeping, romantic, thought.
960;provoking, historically accurate, and realistic epics ever made.
961;Lawrence's cinematography and music are sublime.
962;There are many, many very good actors in minor roles.
963;the film tells the true story of T. e. Lawrence, a British officer who was stationed in the Middle East during WWI.
964;in the film, O'Toole plays the strange and unique Lawrence perfectly.
965;O'Toole's intense blue, searching eyes, his handsomeness and his golden hair lend to create and immortalize the mythic figure of this warrior.
966;One thing you know right away is that they broke the mold when they made Lawrence.
967;His brave and courageous acts leads a sheik to become his friends.
968;the scenes up until Lawrence's capture and abuse by Turks are glorious and inspiring.
969;sharif is so passionate, and an incredible actor.
970;It is difficult to describe one of the greatest films of all times.
971;This film may even be the greatest film of all time.
972;let's begin with the peripherals.
973;The desert scenes are all real.
974;The music, most especially the theme, is unbelievable.
975;The Arabian deserts are as immense as the American west.
976;Also important were the costumes, which were highly detailed and seemingly quite authentic.
977;Each and every aspect of this movie was so exceedingly well executed that it approaches perfection.
978;The black and white documentaries are short but interesting.
979;the movie itself is a classic of classics, the story of an English map maker in service to his country.
980;Bored by what he is doing, he wants to see some action.
981;The movie is about how T. E. Lawrence grows from an idealistic young man to a battle hardened man who discovers that he likes killing, and yet is repulsed by it.
982;The movie also provides as much imagery about Lawrence's psychology as it does about his actions, because his psychology, from being able to put out a match with his bare fingers to calling for the elimination of a fleeing column of Turkish troops with the taking of no prisoners, provides insights into the complex psyche of the person of T. E. Lawrence.
983;the battles are exquisitely executed.
984;The fights are extremely well choreographed, and I admire the stamina and dedication of the hundreds of people involved in the creation of this movie as they created this movie in desert temperatures.
985;ultimately, the art, the story, the locations, the music, the script, the costumes and the action all come together to create an incredibly compelling and realistic story of T. E. Lawrence.
986;This movie is a must.
987;have for a collector of great films.
988;The most amazing restoration ever produced.
989;If you are a fan of this film, this is the ultimate experience.
990;David Lean's Bridge On the River Kwai is said to be his best work.
991;not in my opinion, it's second to this epic masterpiece.
992;his wide span of the camera over deserts and mountains in this film is breathtaking.
993;His characters become remarkable by the end.
994;But most of all, the film's narrative study of the title character is sumptuous of all.
995;o'Toole, Sharif, and Quinn gives career making performances.
996;And like those three other masterful epics, this is a film that will stand the test of time.
997;Lawrence of Arabia was surely one of the best films that exist and one of the best I've seen.
998;It looks like Braveheart in many ways and it's even better.
999;The backgrounds looked good and there were so much good messages and influences in this film.
1000;It is considered as an important film in the history of movies.
1001;The whole thing is simply stunning, brilliant!!!
1002;If you liked Braveheart, The Ten Commandments, it is for you.
1003;most people who have a real interest in films have watched it, but if you want to introduce yourself to great cinema, maybe you should start with this.
1004;What a price drop| Very satisfied.
1005;This restoration and high definition re.
1006;release is a pleasure to discover all over again.
1007;Now that I'm older and have studied film making a little more carefully, I can truly say that this is unquestionably one of the greatest historical epic films ever made.
1008;The dialogue is intelligent and beautiful to hear, the direction flawless, the acting superb on all levels and the production values first.
1009;Atticus Finch is a saintly, upright, model father and lawyer and the movie does a good job balancing the two halves of his life.
1010;He knows in his heart he's not going to win the case because he's defending a black man in court against a jury steeped in racism but he still stands up for what he sincerely believes is the truth.
1011;The world would certainly be a better place if there were more fathers like him but they don't always make the most fascinating characters in books or movies.
1012;The most entertaining heroes are the ones that have shades of gray and black.
1013;a naughty side as well as a good side.
1014;to show that they are `real' people with strengths and weaknesses.
1015;Lawrence is an English soldier prone to ego and eccentricities but if you look beyond his odd exterior you'll see that he really does care about his friends and comrades.
1016;He returns to his Arab comrades, a humbled person, and helps them finish the war.
1017;Peter O'Toole gives a magnificent, four.
1018;He brings out Lawrence's strengths and weaknesses and glides smoothly back and forth from subtle to melodramatic.
1019;the rest of the cast offer strong support.
1020;Omar Sharif gives a refined, smooth, subtle, polished performance as Sherif Ali, the Arab Lawrence is closest too.
1021;key Ali, Jose Ferrer was absolutely perfect as the sadistic Turkish captain.
1022;anthony Quayle is a good.
1023;natured English colonel who makes friends with Lawrence out of pity when he sees that he's being used back and forth by the Arab and English politicians and Alec Guinness is regal, eloquent and dignified just as a king would be.
1024;maurice Jarre's music is a magnificent blend of Middle Eastern and European elements to portray the clash of Arab and English culture.
1025;The cinematography and set design is absolutely gorgeous and richly deserved their Oscars.
1026;It had been years since I had seen this film, it is an excellent film, I would recommend it to anyone who likes true adventure.
1027;The restored version is a pleasure to watch: colors are gorgeous and the music is even more beautiful.
1028;Fantastic film, worth watching a million times over.
1029;After I leave this earth my children will be able to enjoy this classic.
1030;An excellent, dateless, ageless film.
1031;The countless extra footage is priceless"
1032;No wonder the film won so many awards.
1033;genre films substitute noise and special effects for the excellent filmaking displayed in this film.
1034;It's more a rosey spectacles view of events, but still a good movie with excellent cinematography.
1035;Definitely deserves to be seen on a big screen.
1036;loved it then ( well sorta because I was 14 Years old) .
1037;This film is a well deserved 7 Oscar winner.
1038;A huge production effort, 10 M dollars in 1962 was a record.
1039;second: the music score of Maurice Jarre with some remarkable compositions that remain as a trade mark of the movie.
1040;the more than beautiful photography from Freddie Young (with an extended career that include more than 130 films), desert pictures are overwhelming, both winning Oscar.
1041;"Lawrence's internals contradictions: he enjoyed killing a man
1042;Best looking Blu Ray for a classic film.
1043;This is David Lean's masterpiece.
1044;And Peter Toole's performance as Lawrence is as legendary as the man himself.
1045;See the landscapes, the color in full glory on the widest screen you can.
1046;History and spectacle galore, plus fine acting and Peter O'Toole's blue blue eyes!
1047;Music and photography is breathtaking.
1048;This epic is true to the era in every way.
1049;The wide shots are awesome.
1050;The movie is its own personality.
1051;The movie builds up as well, from the first minute to the last it transforms to one of the greatest films ever.
1052;one of the most interesting things is that T. e. Lawrence blows part of the famous train away.
1053;He does this so that he can raid the train.
1054;It is certainly one of Hollywood's most memorable moments.
1055;It is better to travel on the train, watch the train as cuts across the desert .
1056;This is so much better than tearing the train apart for personal gain.
1057;Make a great gain by purchasing this wonderful film.
1058;Lawrence of Arabia is an incredibly rich and challenging movie to watch and devour.
1059;It has breathtaking cinematography, convincing actors, as well as a well.
1060;four hours (I was unable to watch the entire movie in one sitting), it is certainly well worth watching.
1061;Plus it has interesting segments on the making of the film.
1062;A great movie with an all.
1063;The filming still stands up to the highest standards.
1064;This film, sweeping in its grandeur and subtle in its portrayal, tells the story of T. e. Lawrence in the desert campaign of World War I.
1065;It is perhaps the best film David Lean ever made, and certainly one of his most complex.
1066;This movie, based on Lawrence's """"Revolt in the Desert"""", is the greatest insight into the motives behind the discontent of the Arabs in today's middle east."""
1067;"David Lean has made several award winning movies, and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is one of his true masterpieces."
1068;I mention all this because going to the movies, at least when I was young, was an event.
1069;"I still remember seeing ""The Ten Commandments""(1956) and ""Ben."
1070;"With this new restored version of ""Lawrence"" finally making it to Blu Ray at least everyone can enjoy what it was like seeing it for the first time(aspect rato of 2:20:1)even though it's on a flat screen TV."
1071;This Blu Ray is stunning to say the least and the restoration team at Sony deserves at lot of credit for the hard work they put into it just in time for it's 50th Anniversary.
1072;"David Lean's films are perfect subjects for Blu Ray and with this release all of his films since ""Bridge on the River Kwai""(1957) until ""A Passage to India""(his last in 1984) have now been issued on Blu Ray."
1073;"For those who love great filmmaking, enjoy ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in all it's Blu Ray glory."
1074;I bought this as a gift for my husband.
1075;we both love epic movies and 'Lawrence of Arabia' is one of the best ever made!!
1076;I still watch this movie any time I can.
1077;It is, without a doubt, one of the greatest movie ever made.
1078;The story is absorbing but the filming is amazing!
1079;If you're a Lawrence/O'Toole fan, this is a must.
1080;This set is wonderful, and at a great price.
1081;Lawrence of Arabia is the true story of T. e. Lawrence, the enigmatic, controversial British army officer who rose from obscurity to become one of the great military heroes of World War I.
1082;It is a fascinating story, based loosely on Lawrence's book Seven Pillars of Wisdom.
1083;As film biographies go, this one os very good indeed.
1084;performances in Lawrence of Arabia are superb.
1085;These actors brought their characters wonderfully alive, without once sinking into hyperbole or stereotype.
1086;His portrayal of Sherif Ali seems strident and one.
1087;but the film's best performance is that of Peter O'Toole, playing in his first major film role.
1088;rate character study of the tormented man who was T. e. Lawrence.
1089;Lawrence of Arabia is a superbly crafted film biography of one of the great men of the early twentieth century.
1090;It's a movie which will hold the viewer spellbound start to finish, mainly due to the dramatic intensity of O'Toole's brilliant performance, and the gorgeous desert cinematography.
1091;david Lean managed to make a tight three and a half hour movie.
1092;The story moves forward with impeccable thrust, never offering a dull moment.
1093;"The greatest testament I can offer is that I didn't look at my watch once
1094;i was awed by this movie's epic beauty.
1095;That sounds like an odd statement to make about a David Lean movie, but I was still surprised at how beautiful it managed to be.
1096;besides being a skilled visual director, Lean also manages to be a great storyteller as well.
1097;It is a very effective narrative.
1098;what surprised me most about the movie is its perfect use of comedic relief.
1099;A great line, that), and the foolish actions of some of the characters (such as Audar's perfect over.
1100;top buffoonery, and Allenby's gross military pomposity).
1101;The humour is paced perfectly.
1102;It never gets in the way of the narrative, and provides opportunity for further character development.
1103;all that being said, the greatest aspect of this movie is its impressive cast of actors.
1104;What a great group of legendary actors we have here.
1105;Omar Sharif is cool and majestic"
1106;Even Jose Ferrer and Claude Rains in supporting roles add key elements to the picture.
1107;And of course, Peter O'Toole is perfect as Lawrence, capturing all of his boyish charm, beauty, and British snobbery.
1108;And eventually, he manages to capture his courage as well.
1109;for all of these reasons and more, this film manages to live up to its reputation as a great and entertaining work.
1110;In its entirety, the film colors are rich and true.
1111;Omar Sharif's robes are totally black not grey and Peter O'toole's white robes are breathtaking.
1112;Omars eyes are rich and liquid brown, the skies are blue with white clouds, and the camels harnesses are beautiful bright and multicolored.
1113;The desert sands are tan colored, light brown and all hues in between, shifting ever so slightly from scene to scene.
1114;And the acting is beyond any I have seen in many many years.
1115;'Perfectly cast and beautifully photographed, this should be part of everyone's library.
1116;The colors and resolution are breathtaking.
1117;The dialog is razor sharp and the Maurice Jarre score is magnificent.
1118;I first viewed this film in the old Grauman's Chinese Theatre (recently renamed TCL Chinese Theatre) with its wide screen and excellent acoustics.
1119;The desert scenes were more captivating than ever since my appreciation of real photography (not phone pics) has grown over the years.
1120;Patience is the watchword in capturing the right light and shot.
1121;My family and I loved this timeless classic.
1122;A very good Movie,love it,and a great book.
1123;The majestic beauty of the Arabian desert is now a site to behold on Blu.

1133;This was an excellent restoration.
1134;Colors and picture were outstanding.
1135;If you had an older version, this one is much better and worth the price.
1136;Well, Lawrence of Arabia defied the odds, and became the best movie I have ever seen.
1137;Shot mostly on location in the deserts of the Mid East, this film features fantastic artistry, breathtaking performances by greats such as Peter O'Toole (Lawrence) and Ben Hurr (Prince Feisal), and a brilliant script that not only explores Lawrence's life, but the human psyche.
1138;Yes, it is long, but it is well worth it.
1139;Lawrence of Arabia is the sweeping, grand and brilliantly conceived fictional account of the life of T. e. Lawrence.
1140;In his debut film, Peter O'Toole delivers a tour de force performance.
1141;Omar Shariff is ideally cast as Ali.
1142;The evergreen chameleon, Alec Guinness is marvelous.
1143;Claude Raines and Jack Hawkins are their usual stellar best.
1144;Columbia has my greatest disdain!
1145;Excellent casting in this tale of war in the middle east during world war 1.
1146;Delves into the arab psyche as well as delivering the tale of a man who dared to differ from his own race and class, and find a temporary home among the arabs.
1147;A great movie for a dark cold night.

1149;a must see for all those that want to enjoy one of the all time classics.
1150;This has to be one of my all time favorite movies.

1152;This is THE greatest film of all time.
1153;It is simply amazing and nothing short of breathtaking!
1154;Wonderful cinematography, haunting music and dazzling performences.
1155;This film has influenced many modern films that work in its shadow.
1156;Peter O'Toole is just wonderful as Lawrence in this movie.
1157;The musical score is beautiful.

1159;The movie is larger than life and despite the length, I love to watch it in the comfort of my own home.
1160;After the success of his 1957 hit 'Bridge On The River Kwai', David Lean returned with his 1962 direction of 'Lawrence of Arabia.'
1161;A visual feast in every respect, the film brings out all of the drama and tension that pervaded T. e. Lawrence'sspectacular yet turbulent life.
1162;this is truly another example of Hollywood at its very best.
1163;The sweeping cinematography of the desert, in addition to being a visual feast, provides a strong thematic backdrop for the Arab culture at that time.
1164;All of this is done by first class acting and the impeccable direction of David Lean.
1165;in conclusion, this is one of the greatest films ever made in which its images speak for themselves.
1166;This is all enhanced by the performance of first.
1167;rate actors under the guidance of a talented director.
1168;Came as described with both discs in pristine condition.
1169;This is one of my husband's favorite movies.
1170;Don't get me wrong, the movie riveted me from start to finish.
1171;Here's mine: Lawrence, as portrayed by Lean, is a megalomaniacal adrenaline.
1172;"trip to Cairo, informs Allenby about the two people he had killed and that he ""liked"" it."
1173;raid, his incredulous look screams genuine surprise.
1174;there are many more such episodes that helps one decipher the enigma that is Lean's Lawrence.
1175;"One of my favorite episodes was the existential subplot concerning ""what is written."""
1176;Lawrence goes anyway, and is successful in bringing the man out of the desert alive.
1177;Also, when Lawrence is captured by the Turks, Lean does an excellent job showing the atrophy of the Ottoman Empire.
1178;Truly, this is one of the greatest movies of all time!
1179;This is a movie that really demands to be seen projected on a big screen.
1180;Yet the movie is a masterpiece.
1181;Subtle performances from the legendary supporting cast, plus a star.
1182;It's a complex movie that demands some involvement from the viewer.

1188;Imagine my surprise (and delight) when last weekend for Father's Day my son presented this gift box to me as a Father's Day present.
1189;He knows I am a movie buff, but I certainly did not expect him to spend his hard.

1192;The richness of the colors on this Blue.
1193;ray edition are nothing short of stunning, making this movie now eye.
1194;candy from start to finish.
1195;The comments from Martin Scorsese are, as always, enjoyable and insighful.

1197;brings the epic soundtrack to the movie, and is a very nice item to have (I have been playing this in my car this past week).
1198;And that I got this as a Father's Day gift, makes this even more special for me.
1199;i was amazed to see individual grains of sand sparkling on dunes from the suns reflection.
1200;The desert scenes now have a magical, alien aura for the strange man in a strange land.

1203;poetic arc of triumph, failure, ennui, hubris and the nature of humanity.
1204;a film for the ages, Essential for fans and people who haven't seen it yet!
1205;As much as I agree with the reviews that point to the wonderful balance of spectacle and intimate biography, I've recently discovered something else about this film: running deeply .
1206;throughout it is the insightful story of how the Middle East became what it is today.
1207;If you haven't seen this movie in 10 years or so, take a look again.
1208;This is the true story of a young British man whose arrogance defies everything and everyone.
1209;Lawrence Of Arabia is poetry on film, from one incredible scene to another.
1210;It defined the modern epic.
1211;It has a rare visual artistry and beauty that will never date itself.
1212;Lean is a painter and his canvas is the silver screen!
1213;Received this yesterday and watched it well into the night!
1214;ray ranks with Barry Lyndon and The Searchers as the best looking Blu.
1215;ray of a classic film I have ever seen.
1216;Columbia did a very nice job on the restoration.
1217;You will be pleased with the visual results, and the sound track is pretty good though not as impressive as the image.
1218;reams have been written about this flick, and all I can say is Peter O'Toole gives maybe the greatest performance in the history of cinema as Lawrence.
1219;it is so nice to watch an epic film without cgi at all.
1220;truly one of the great ones.
1221;We really enjoyed this beautifully restored version.
1222;A captivating, interesting, historic screenplay, terrific photography, marvelous cast especially Peter O'Toole and with wonderful music which still echos.
1223;Finally, we fast forwarded until we got a picture and the streaming worked perfectly.
1224;Lawrence Of Arabia is one of the biggest and grandest films ever made.
1225;Director David Lean crafted a stunning epic that tells the tale of World War I British soldier T. e. Lawrence.
1226;Lawrence joined the various desert tribes of Arabia against the Turks and the desert battle scenes are breathtaking.
1227;Peter O'Toole is amazing as Lawrence in what would be a star.
1228;His direction provides sweeping shots of the desert vistas and gives the film its big look, but he also allows the story to flow and we really get inside the complicated head of Lawrence and see his psychological foibles.
1229;The movie is an all time classic !
1230;The greatest movie ever made, with great extras AND with Dutch subtitles on all discs !
1231;I love their scope, their feel, the time they take to go over all the details of their subjects' lives.
1232;A good epic immerses you into their world.
1233;telling the story of T. e. Lawrence in his attempt to bring the feuding clans of Arabs together during the World War II, this film is beautiful in its leisure ness, exciting in its action, and absolutely breathtaking in its cinematography.
1234;At the time of its release, it had to be the most beautiful filmed motion picture ever made.
1235;fresh from his success in the film Bridge on the River Kwai, director David Lean sought to make a film of equal greatness.
1236;Its influence in modern filmmakers alone is amazing, Steven Spielberg in particular.
1237;fantastic performances by a young Peter O'Toole, Alec Guinness and the rest of the cast bring the story to vivid life.
1238;It's clear the actors believed in their characters, and in the movie.
1239;filled with classic moments that still to this day inspire awe and power in its audiences, such as the slow approach by stranger on horseback to the well Lawrence and his companion drink from, this film is fantastic on all levels.
1240;This is the greatest movie I have ever seen.
1241;Whatever he learns will help the British campaign function more effectively for their own purposes.

1250;Instead, stirring dialogue and tracking shots get a strong enough reaction that the guns and casualties don't really matter.
1251;"the dialogue is sharp enough to rival ""Casablanca"" or ""Pulp Fiction""."
1252;Screenwriter Robert Bolt's dialogue is so truthful, poetic, and eloquent .
1253;it's a thrill just to hear these characters 'speak'.
1254;another remarkable acheivement is Maurice Jarre's music score.
1255;Simply put, it's amazing and legendary!
1256;The filmmakers took great pride in the best presentation possible for a film that took about 2 years to make.
1257;Lawrence of Arabia is as much as pleasure to listen to as it to watch it.
1258;credit for the portrayal of T. e. Lawrence belongs equally to the entire production team.
1259;This strong collaberation of artists results in a rarity: we, the audience, can relate to a historical figure who a total 'enigma'.
1260;He's a central war figure who inspires many, but eventually rejects his talents.
1261;I forgot to mention the supporting characters who give their take on this bizarre man.
1262;They, I believe, is the heart of the film.

1269;Even if you don't share my praise for the film, you will admire the patience and hard work that everybody invested into it.
1270;"This was not one man's vision
1271;This movie is by far one the greatest of all films.
1272;This is largely due in part to its superior screenplay and dialogue.
1273;The movie is loaded with various motiffs and symbols.
1274;The overall theme of the movie is the psychological transformation of T. e. Lawrence.
1275;Once he undergoes his mission to """"appreciate the situation"""" he states that he will accomplish a """"miracle"""" which he eventually does."""
1276;He eventually goes so far as to compare himself to Christ as he walks in splendor and transfigured white on top of the train.
1277;The more you see the film the more you will love and understand it.
1278;Lawrence of Arabia is one of my top 3 favorite movies.
1279;It's an epic cinematic goldmine featuring one of the greatest screenplays ever written, excellent performances by a terrific cast led by Peter O'Toole, and superb direction from the masterful David Lean.
1280;The experience was mind blowing.
1281;The new remaster is a technical marvel and the film was just as entertaining and engrossing as it's always been.
1282;"Shot by legendary cinematographer Freddie Young, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is, for my money, the most beautifully photographed film ever made."
1283;Every shot is breathtaking, with its epic desert landscapes and deep blue skies.
1284;Sony is to be commended for the hard work and money they put into restoring this amazing film.
1285;Maurice Jarre's monumental score is tremendous on this Blu.
1286;In addition to the bonus disc featured on the standard 2.
1287;"For ""Lawrence"" fans, the biggest treasure will be the legendary deleted balcony scene."
1288;This was noted by screenwriter Robert Bolt to be the finest scene he'd ever written.
1289;It's a great scene, and it's a bit of a shame it hasn't been restored to the movie.
1290;The disc also includes an interview with the ever.
1291;Anyway, a great set that'll please any fan of the film.
1292;This is one of the three great David Lean classics, along with Bridge On The River Kwai and Doctor Zhivago, all shot on 70mm film providing unbelievable clarity.
1293;and who succeeded, only to later learn that even for the most exceptional of men, there are limits on what one man can do.
1294;This movie defines the term epic , and is rich with actual history, mixed in with the life and times of one truly extraordinary man.
1295;p. s. Most people (in the modern U. s. at least) are grossly ignorant of history, including myself, however I must share one rather remarkable fact.
1296;This movie is a product of two of the century's greatest minds, one an author and soldier, the other a film maker.
1297;The power of Lawrence's descriptions of the desert matches the great cinematography.
1298;"No film could fully project the power of the inner thoughts of this most introspective man
1299;Many of the scenes take on a much deeper meaning once you have read the book in detail.
1300;What has always been able to stand as one of the best cinematographic movies of all time has now turned the corner for the serious home movie watcher.
1301;The sweeping deserts, the Arab persona.
1302;The internal strife Lawrence faced as a British officer, and an Arab brother.
1303;This is one fine film.
1304;This is one of those magnificent films that rises and shines and stays shining over the years.
1305;A compelling, gorgeous, starkly tragic wonder.
1306;For the rest, it is simply splendid.
1307;The retored footage makes a real difference.
1308;Peter O'Toole played the part of T. E. Lawrence perfectly.
1309;My Great Uncle Frank knew T. E. Lawrence and said when he visited us from England in the early 60's that he was even more of an odd bird in real life than O'Tool portrayed him.
1310;best lists and the rather heavy concentration in them of """"old"""" movies (for the purposes of this argument, we'll define """"old"""" as """"made before 1970""""."""
1311;"There's certainly some validity to this point
1312;He implies, by linking this to some of his older films (1969's Women in Love and 1971's The Devils.

1315;A surprising move, perhaps, and I have little doubt there was carping at the studio over using two unknowns in the top slots of what was to be a lavish, expensive effort.
1316;nominated for his role here, has become a legend both on the screen and at the card table.
1317;two Oscar nominations over the years, with four wins"
1318;Still, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Picture, not a bad haul.
1319;All you have to do is sit back and watch two great actors at work.
1320;"O'Toole's Lawrence may not have won the Oscar, but AFI called his Lawrence the finest screen performance of all time
1321;Equally impressive is Sharif's Ali, but the interplay between them is more than the sum of its parts.
1322;Lean and screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson never let the viewer assume that the friendship between Lawrence and Ali is on firm ground, even when one is risking his life for the other"
1323;an amazing, beautiful piece of work that must be seen to be believed.
1324;Lawrence of Arabia is one of the great epics.
1325;A film that is captivating in its scope and grandeur.
1326;Director David Lean has here his best film.
1327;made film with a fantastic screenplay by Robert Bolt and dynamic performances by Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif.
1328;The vistas are breathtaking and it will be a very long time before anyone films the desert like Lean did with this film.
1329;It is even more breathtaking a movie to watch when you know this was released in 1962, long before computer graphics were essential to visuals.
1330;Everything is REAL, alive and thundering.
1331;And whatever beautiful visual side.
1332;The action sequences are also great to this day.
1333;This film is epic and grand, heroic and exhilarating yet beautifully artistic.
1334;And there is of course, the romantic, wonderous musical score by Maurice Jarre.
1335;It is one of the great masterpieces of the cinema.
1336;A true classic that still stands the test of time.
1337;of documentary is fascinating and very informative.
1338;It is a worthy treatment.
1339;Here is one of the truly great films.
1340;Its one of the Greatest films ever made.
1341;Excellent story line and the movie flowed!!
1342;A definitive masterpiece I'd recommend to anyone.
1343;Definitely worth the asking price, the book is especially great and the film frame adds to this great edition even more.
1344;blowing, as the cinematography is crystal clear and gorgeous.
1345;David Lean's employment of the desert as a beautiful object unto itself was flawless and truly one.
1346;The writing for this great film (by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson) is also fittingly powerful and serves to emblazon in the memory the characters and their struggles.
1347;The musical score by Maurice Jarre is nothing short of brilliant and stirs the passions for adventure and heroism.
1348;what I found most impressive, was that every actor seemed to be at the absolute pinnacle of his talents in this film.
1349;in terrific performances, but Alec Guinness was flawless as Prince Feisal.
1350;Amazingly, this was Peter O'Toole's first film .
1351;and he gave a powerful, courageous, award.
1352;worthy performance as the brave, educated and troubled T. e. Lawrence.
1353;It will be one of the most powerful, encompassing films you'll ever see.
1354;The less you know about T. E. Lawrence, the more enjoyable this movie is.
1355;There is always controversy regarding the extent to which the accuracy of the presentation of a historical figure should impact one's assessment of a work of art.
1356;It is unquestionably one of the most beautiful films ever made, with inconceivably gorgeous cinematography, one of the great musical scores in movie history, and one magnificently epic vista after another.
1357;arabs playing major Arab roles), Peter O'Toole dominates the screen in every shot in which he appears, with the most piercing blue eyes one can remember.
1358;Lawrence was easily one of the most complex personalities of the 20th century.
1359;still, this is a great movie.
1360;If you don't know much about Lawrence, see the movie before learning more about him.
1361;You'll love the movie a great deal more if you do.
1362;"David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is one of the few films that legitimately deserves to be called great."
1363;"It appears on virtually all ""ten best"" lists and reveals deeper layers of meaning with repeated viewings."
1364;"lean, a man devoted to the art, gives ""Lawrence of Arabia"" its spectacular values."
1365;Lawrence of Arabia is a prodigious labor, a masterful mixture of fact and artistry, a masterpiece of intimate moment and spectacular largesse, a film that literally excites the senses.
1366;In a visual sense, Lean combines a sure sense of place with an approach to the action that he borrows from an unlikely source.
1367;In many of the early scenes, the stately gait of the camel's walk gives the film a slower pace, and this is precisely what Lean is trying to achieve.
1368;"Lean even manages to surpass Ford with his understanding of the relationship between his characters and the landscape
1369;Throuhout the picture one has a sense of a man discovering his own unique dimensions.
1370;It is accomplished through a semi.
1371;the photography, the script and the acting are so superb that """"Lawrence of Arabia"""" becomes a lavish epic winner of 7 Academy Awards for Best Picture, Directing, Color, Cinematography, Sound, Muscial Score and Film Editing."""
1372;It is certainly one of the greatest movies ever made.
1373;The life of T. e. Lawrence is definitely worth a HBO miniseries, no doubt about it.
1374;He was such a fascinating brilliant man.
1375;He spoke numerous Middle Eastern and European as well as Classic languages and was an experience archeologist.
1376;One of the things that might characterize this film and the supplemental materials is nobody really understands T. e. Lawrence.
1377;He was in the end a man with his own ideas who had the initiative to prove himself right and an ability to sell his image to the press that made him cut such a heroic figure.
1378;Now out of uniform and wrapped in Arab garb he returns to the British command who now also believe maybe this man can accomplish anything.
1379;His prestige grows among the Arabs and he is built into a hero by the British press.
1380;His press and continued successes inflate his own self.
1381;it is interesting to watch the story of Lawrence of Arabia as not about Lawrence but as story of modern Arabia.
1382;lawrence of Arabia is a big movie.
1383;So the larger the screen you can watch it on the better.
1384;This is the restored version and while it is as good as you will ever see it.
1385;But occasionally you can spot where some of the inspiration for the film's spectacular images were derived.
1386;"To me ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is one of best and great film of the 20 century."
1387;"Peter O'Toole is at is best as Lawrence and story telling is every well told with every moment of your eyes and your ears, seeing and feeling what is ""Lawrence of Arabia""."
1388;To me, just a great all time film for all to see and still hold up today, in so many ways and more.
1389;One of cinema's greatest films and so breathtaking to see and enjoy anytime.
1390;This is one of the top movies I never get tried of seeing.

1556;be stars, including Claude Rains, Anthony Quinn, Omar Sharif, and Jose Ferrer.
1557;The score by Maurice Jarre is grand and perfect for the film.
1558;And it all sounds great in updated Dolby Digital audio.
1559;the word that best describes this film has to be spectacular.
1560;Sometimes the age is obvious in films like this, but Lawrence holds up so well, it has to be considered timeless.
1561;It's awesome to watch and a must.
1562;The extras include a good hour+ documentary.
1563;This is the film that elevated Peter O'Toole to stardom.
1564;O'Toole is mesmerizing as the enigmatic and mystical Lawrence against a backdrop of the incredible, stark beauty of the desert (no CGI or blue screen effects here) with a stellar supporting cast, all of whom are in the shadow of O'Toole's performance.
1565;This is film based on a true story and except for the personal scenes, I believe to be historically accurate.
1566;The movie itself is epic and how was restored is incredible.
1567;I think every intelligent human being has to have it
1568;'Lawrence of Arabia'one of the finest films ever made has withstood the greatest test of all, time.
1569;As beautiful today as ever and improved technology has certainly made this possible.
1570;You'll notice I said pretty good not exceptional or excellent or even outstanding.
1571;There is an excessive amount of halos and a shimmering like effect that you see with edge enhancement.
1572;To give this edition of Lawrence its due, this is probably the sharpest, most vivid transfer I've seen of Lawrence and it bests the Laserdisc edition as well.
1573;It's a solid transfer and looks good if you don't notice edge enchancements or issues with how sharp the resolution or how accurate the color might be.
1574;With a supporting cast consisting of Claude Rains, Jack Hawkins, Omar Shariff, Alec Guiness and others, that's no small feat.
1575;The single disc has the entire film with no extras (that I recall), while the double disc edition does feature many extras that are worthwhile and it has a collectable case, booklet, etc.
1576;"This is a rarity among epic movies
1577;Lawrence won a total of seven Academy Awards in 1962 including Best Picture.
1578;Every shot seems choreographed to show the beauty and danger of Arabia.
1579;We see sandstorms, twisters and miles of beautiful sand dunes.
1580;There are some beautiful shots of sunrises or sunsets (One of them part of a memorable edit).
1581;The movie is full of many great images, one of the most memorable being the long entrance of Sharif's character, coming out of the mirage.
1582;Another memorable image is when Lawrence and his companions reach the Suez Canal.
1583;the script, as I already stated, is surprisingly strong for an epic.
1584;The conversations between people are interesting and sometimes even exciting to listen to (Though this can also be attributed to direction, acting and/or editing).
1585;prince Feisal: You are merely a general.
1586;t. e Lawrence: I don't think that's a very good idea.
1587;lawrence lived to see himself become a legend.
1588;ray restoration of this classic is absolutely incredible.

1590;The camera work is my favorite part of this movie and still to this day some of the best work ever done.
1591;The scene where they take the town with hundreds of horsemen riding in is absolutely stunning.
1592;Maybe I will come back and rate it five stars after another viewing.
1593;Still comes highly recommended and is without question an all.
1594;Filmmaker David Lean has directed some of the best epics of all time.
1595;He set the standards so high that most filmmakers find it almost impossible to live up to Lean's sheer epic, cinema craftsmanship.
1596;david Lean shows off his and his many co. filmmakers talents with cinematic panache.
1597;Lawrence won many Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Photography.
1598;It was Peter O'Tool's first film and a great beginning for the career of Omar Sharif who went on to star in David Lean's next film: Dr Zhivago.
1599;lawrence of Arabia is well placed on many people's """"Best Picture of All Time"""" list, including my own."""
1600;See it on a big screen and be absorbed in the experience, because on the small screen it looses some of it's magic.
1601;I may be a younger viewer of the classic films (age 25) but I really enjoy these films.
1602;They have very good story lines, acting, and directing as well as capturing the audience.
1603;I added this film into my collection so that I may share them with my future kids to enjoy and see what real film making used to be.

1612;T. e. Lawrence was an enigma to himself as well as those around him.
1613;the project of bringing Lawerence's fascinating life to the screen was a challenge of veteran British director David Lean, who also crafted The Bridge on the River Kwai and Doctor Zhivago .
1614;In the manner of Lawrence of Arabia, the other films were also magnificent technicolor dramas with broad international scope.
1615;Screenwriter Robert Bolt crafted his superb script from Lawrence's autobiography, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom.
1616;I found Lawrence fascinating enough to concentrate a lengthy chapter on him in my Middle East historical work, Struggle for the Holy Land.
1617;Lawrence is brilliantly captured on screen by Peter O'Toole,who vaulted to international stardom with this role.
1618;The film won 7 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Cinematography.

1630;One of the greats (and an obvious forerunner of another Oscar.
1631;An essential part of any movie library.
1632;all the edge enhancement is stilll there.
1633;I had the great honor of seeing the restored Lawrence of Arabia in a pristine 70mm print in the late 80's.
1634;part of the joy of watching this film is the knowledge that almost everything you see on the screen was REALLY THERE.
1635;The film's most exciting sequence, the takng of Akaba, was staged full.
1636;"big, ""spectacular"" films are still made."
1637;The film deftly reveals these possibilities without politicizing them or judging them.

1647;Peter O'Toole, thank you for putting your all into this film.
1648;et al. /bowthis is the tale of actuation of the soul and the spirit of man.
1649;This film is the closest i've ever experienced to capturing the universalism ideal and also the concept of man breaking the boundries and freeing himself in order to allow the explosion of actuation occur.
1650;the macro and microcosm of true being.
1651;Lawrence of Arabia is a film that elevated the art of cinematic storytelling to new heights, and it shows.
