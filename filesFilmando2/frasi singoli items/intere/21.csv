id;spiegazione
1;Clever and entertaining take on the time travel vein of science fiction.
2;The film has even been parodied on Family Guy , so it must be good.
3;Has a great message for live: Your future is not written!This movie makes me feel possitive about myself.
4;Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, time travel and an ingenious story.
5;All of these terrific actors disappear melting into their original characters.
6;robert Zemeckis has crafted a fine story envolving a paradox and simplicity.
7;I consider it to be one of the funniest and incredible movie's ever made.
8;This is not my first time watching this movie and every time I really enjoy it.
9;he loved it and can't wait to see Part II and III.
10;Would not recommend this for kids under 13 years of age.
11;Nice fun movie that I watched when my 19 year old daughter and I were both home sick.
12;Great story that I remember watching on the big screen.
13;love all the extras on it.
14;I recommend this blu ray, especially since I only wanted the first movie, not all 3.
15;A great movie, a classic.
16;"This 80's classic is Spielberg at his best
17;This one is the best of the trilogy.
18;It's fun for the whole family to watch.
19;Now she knows where it comes from!
20;Back TO The Future is classic science fiction film that will I will always remember.
21;It is a film which I saw when I was younger, and still watch to this day.
22;Michael J. Fox is perfect as the seventeen.
23;Christopher Lloyd is great as Doc.
24;Doc builds a time machine from a Dollorian, and asks Marty to tape his first experiment.
25;After the first time travel experiment is done perfectly, terroists try to kill Doc and go after Marty.
26;There he meets up with his teenage mother and father, and a much younger Doc.
27;Well, you'll have to watch and see for yourself.
28;anyway Back to the Future is a great movie from kids to adults.
29;The 1980s jokes are still funny if you remember that era and the rest of the movie held my kids' attention.
30;I got this movie as a gift for my husband.
31;Thirty years later and it's still a great movie.
32;80's movies, however, the kids (and I) loved this movie.
33;This has always been a classic in my book.
34;I think they enjoyed it just as much!
35;This is one of the best comical and family oriented movies from years past.
36;enjoy with family and friends for a fun evening
37;This movie is a classic!
38;It has action, humor, romance, and a great plot.
39;Finally, something my entire family can enjoy!
40;Of the three Back to the Future films, the original has aged the best.
41;The sequels are still good but the original is the crown jewel of the series by far.
42;this movie is hilarious, and the actors are all great.
43;I think some of the funniest jokes are the ones where Marty implies future events to unsuspecting people.
44;If you like this movie, see the rest of the series, but you must see them in order.
45;I highly reccomend these films.
46;It's truly the classiest, most fun and exciting """"adventure comedy"""" of all time."""
47;We enjoyed watching this classic again with our third grade son.
48;It was fun seeing him think through the intricacies of time travel and realize that 30 years in the future from 1985 is almost upon us!
49;It was awesome it was fun it was cool it also teaches you science it also has good graphics it was good
50;Now Marty must return to the past and try to set things right before he simply disappears.
51;If successful, he then has to find a way to go: back to the future!A modern classic if ever there was one.
52;(It's the power of love!)
53;Marty McFly has got to be one of the greatest film characters ever!Back to the Future is a classic to watch over and over!
54;This movie was fun but it didn't teach me how to travel back in time because I saw pictures of my mom from the fifties and she was hot so I wanted to make out with her in a car.
55;This is one of my favorite movies.
56;Marty McFly is the part Fox was born to play, but there are other great performances here, as well.
57;Christopher Lloyd is excellent as Doc Brown, and Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas Wilson also help to make this a very entertaining movie.
58;There is an extra attraction here for those of us who can remember the 1950's, and some of the gags based on Fox's out.
59;This is not the cleverest or most sophisticated comedy around, but it is definitely great fun.
60;It's a classic that can be watched over and over again.
61;Michael J. Fox is amazing in this movie.
62;We have seen this movie multiple times over the years and everyone in the family enjoys it.
63;It is a fun move to watch.
64;A bit dated now but if you can get past that very funny and original at the time.
65;This is a great classic 80's movie!
66;now I have to see the rest of the movies!
67;Viewed: 1/08Rate: 91/08: Excellent stuff.
68;I remember seeing this film when it came out in theaters.
69;Another one is that the car has the years: present, destination, and past.
70;Anyway, apart from the faults, Back to the Future is a one great, fun journey with many zany scenes but with excellent performances.
71;Of all players, Crispin Glover steals the film as the father George McFly with Christopher Lloyd, as Dr. Emmett Brown, running for second.
72;I love the characters, I love the story, and I love the uniqueness of the incidents: how one specific moment can alter the rest of history.
73;Michael J. Fox will always be memorable as Marty McFly (cool name indeed!)
74;When I am watching Back to the Future, I make sure I kept everything in mind and let my mind be satisfied later in the film.
75;Was Back to the Future meant to convey a message that it's better to have cool, well.
76;That's pretty discriminating of the filmmakers.
77;Back to the Future is the one for all ages.
78;Back to the future is one of the most classic new films of the last 20 years.
79;I think that this film is catchy and will delight all ages young and old.
80;on a scale of 1 to 100 I'd give it a 1,000.
81;I hope you will make the first one available soon !
82;Lucky enough to see it again in the theaters with my son.
83;I have always been a fan of this CLASSIC!
84;A fun movie that we've all seen, I felt like it should have been a free movie, considering how long it's been out.
85;Like a few other films I've reviewed, this is one of those movies that is a great memory of certain points in your life.
86;This film, and a few others, sort of defined great moments from my childhood.
87;In the film, directed by Oscar winner Robert Zemeckis(Who Framed Roger Rabbitt, Death Becomes Her, Forrest Gump, Contact, What Lies Beneath, Cast Away), young high school student Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox), is transported back to the 1950's, thanks to a time traveling delorean that belong's to Mary's slightly nutty friend, Dr. Emmett Brown(Christopher Lloyd).
88;The script is brilliantly written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale.
89;The movie is exceptionally made and acted.
90;The sets and clothes that defined that era in time are solidly done.
91;The movie is funny, touching, and tender.
92;It has real heart, charm, and depth.
93;Look real closely and you'll see Huey himself in a cameo early on in the film as a teacher.
94;The film is fantastically plotted and drawn out.
95;This also includes Parts 2 and 3 in the trilogy.
96;, because it was good.
97;This is a genuine film classic.
98;This is most definetly one of the best films ever made!
99;Its so funny, charming, and thrilling.
100;Marty McFly(Fox) is a teen who is friends with the Doc.
101;Lots of hilarious jokes the all tie togther.
102;A beautifully done film, its a classic.
103;He had invented a time machine, and his friend Marty McFly (played by Michael J. fox), was about to be the first person ever to go back in time.
104;steven Spielberg presents 'Back to the Future', an action packed, comedy, drama story about love, life, and growing up.
105;"So get some popcorn and grab a seat
106;I feel it was a perfect blend of comedy and drama.
107;Plus it really makes you think.
108;Also, Chistopher Llyod was fantastic in this film!
109;Back to the future was the most successful film of the year 1985, and it is not hard to imagine why.
110;This gloriously entertaining movie is still director Robert Zemeckis' best film to date.
111;the story itself is hardly original, but how it is told is outstanding.
112;An atmosphere that you can feel and which distinguishes good movies from classics.
113;You really connect with all the characters on screen.
114;Michael J. Fox was born to play this role and Christopher Lloyd is simply sensationel as Doc Brown.
115;They both will always be remembered because of this film.
116;The score by Alan Silvestri and the Songs by Huey Lewis also became classics.
117;each time someone asks me which movies I find the most entertaining of all time, I mention titles like: Raiders of the Lost ark , The Empire Strikes Back , some early Marx Brothers movies, Pulp Fiction , and for sure Back to the Future .
118;Micheal J. Fox can thank this trilogy for making him a star, as well as Christopher Lloyd.
119;lloyd playes doc Brown, the man who invented time travel.
120;Alan silvestri scores the movie With Huey Lewis providing songs for the movie, a great movie all in all.
121;All of the actor shine in this movie, I would highly recommend this movie.
122;Back To The Future is a great movie which starts out a great series.
123;I liked the whole concept of travelling through time.
124;He even beats up Biff and that makes his family a happier family in 1985 when he comes back to the future.
125;And Biff is washing his new car!
126;Watch part 2 to find out!
127;Overall this movie is very innovative and fun to watch, and I recommend it to everyone 9 and up, because I was 9 when I first watched it.
128;well Doc (Christopher Loyd) made a time machine out of a Delorian.
129;Marty being his friend gets to help with the experiment.
130;She knows he is Kelvin Kline because it is written on his underwear.
131;All the kids loved it (the 3 year old didn't really watch it).
132;Aside from the tiny bit of language, this movie was a hit for all of us!
133;Watched with our 8 yr old.
134;What a blast from the past.
135;It was fun to see our daughter get interested in the movie
136;All you need to hear are the first three notes of that infectious musical score from Alan Silvestri, and you know where it's from.
137;You remember the laughs, the catch phrases, the wild special effects, and that souped.
138;Back to the Future, arguably the single most enjoyable comedic sci.
139;fi fantasy, still holds up to this day as a favorite, not only of mine, but of virtually any dedicated film buff who can recognize when a film has real smarts behind the flashy visual effects and snap.
140;And it's funny as hell!
141;But it also provides a nice Capra.
142;now, after all these surprises have come and gone, we are subjected to one of the best action sequences ever filmed.
143;As you can guess during a sequence set up as intricately as this one, every possible thing that can go wrong does, and to watch it unfold to Silvestri's excellent music and Zemeckis' stunning, electrifying directing style is one of the great guilty pleasures of film history.
144;Of course Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are spectacular in the lead roles, complimenting each other perfectly in every scene"
145;scientist energy of the Doc.
146;Crispin Glover is appropriately flaky yet likable all at once.
147;Lea Thompson delivers her lines of then.
148;mother with just the right straight.
149;this is an immensely enjoyable film experience, from the first frame to the last.
150;It's a film that ages well, despite the changes in our culture, and the spunky 80s attitude that we all laugh at now actually adds a bit of nostalgia to the film, giving it a classic feel.
151;And it is a classic in every way a film should be.
152;Great casting,Michael J. Fox, Crispin Glover,and especially Christopher Lloyd, he and his flux capaciter[?]
153;and the great facial expressions, and some improvising he did in the movie are just great,a very memorable character.
154;Just remember, if you do go back to 1955 look Doc Brown up.
155;Michael J Fox at his peak (as Marty McFly), and Christopher Lloyd (Doc Brown) in his best performance since Rev. Jim in the Taxi TV series.
156;The film does a great job of showing the change in Hill Valley from the 50's to the 80's, and the differences between the two decades (diet soda, music, and clothing) all with great gags attached to the comparisons.
157;The best time travel movie ever made!
158;My son and I watched this movie again, and we loved it.
159;A great entertainment and learning experience movie experience for kids!!!!
160;It is one of the best films ever made, and corroborates the recent astrophysical theories of non.
161;This is quite an amazing feat, considering that the film was made almost thirty years ago !
162;He seems to be doing well, but we don't get the impression that he is happy.
163;but this is a comedy, and Marty deals with the comical disillusionment of seeing his mother at his age.
164;overall it's a good sci fi film with the right amount of tension and laughs, and even some really touching moments.
165;Overall, it's a great 80s icon that combines sci fi, comedy, romance, and even really poignant moments.
166;This movie came out the year before I was born, and I have watched this movie countless times since about the age of 3 or 4.
167;it is a little cheesy, but it is still a good movie.
168;Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are good actors and do well in their roles.
169;Just as good as I remembered it when It first came out in the 80's.
170;Good then, and still good now.
171;Back to the Future was one of several of the crop of very original and entertaining comedies to come out in the 80s, which seemed to be a decade for highly creative and well executed comedies (Ghost Busters, Tootsie, A Fish Called Wanda, Blues Brothers, Caddyshack, the list goes on and on).
172;"There we get entertainment and laughs from both the 50s set piece and the ""fish out of water"" adventures of Marty."
173;This is a true classic.
174;It is Michael J Fox's landmark film, and a must see for his fans, or fans of comedy.
175;Still just as good as it was when it came on.
176;Still good after all these years.
177;but in terms of wish fulfillment, a fun story line, and a big smile on my face at the end of the movie.
178;This is a classic and I love the film.
179;shipped fast and in great condition.
180;i like 2 and 3 also but this one is the best
181;originals still funny and good, can remeber seeing it in theaters and thinking it awesome.
182;This movie is filled with jokes and fantasy and action to go along with it!
183;I give it two thumbs up!
184;BTTF is my favorite movie.
185;Oh well, maybe for the 25th Anniversary.
186;Still giving 5 stars because this is the best film ever.
187;This movie is the greatest!
188;I watch it a zillion times!
189;So there is a little summery on the greatest movie of all time.
190;Amazon you have to get it back on here!
191;it is both hilariously funny while it makes you think.
192;It keeps you on your feet constantly waiting for the next scene.
193;It is Micheal J. Fox at his best and christopher Lloyd delivers an amazing performance.
194;They took the story and told it perfectly in a way anyone no matter their taste in movies will love it.
195;This is a classic film that's great for the whole family.
196;My nine year old son saw it for his first time and he loved it.
197;This film has it all Brilliant acting,great special effects and Great characters.
198;I recommend this movie to all Sc fi fans and to every one else.
199;I think it is a great but simple movie, It is full of laughs, and little depth, so it is staight entertainment.
200;Michael J Fox is great.
201;This is an all time classic.
202;This is another of my most favorite movies of all time.
203;It's such a fun movie and I never tire of watching it.
204;It's a fun family movie and everyone who's watched it has just loved it.
205;Great actors and great story.
206;We enjoyed the movie but it did not need the swearing.
207;Amazon instant viewing is awesome.
208;Hard to believe it is 30 years into the future.
209;, masterfully directed (Robert Zemeckis, who did a fantastic job of telling a chronologically complex story so well that a child could love it.
210;i was in second grade when it first came out), and possibly one of the only films to showcase and elevate a DeLorean to legendary status.
211;There was a fantastic documentary/making.
212;it's pretty much called for.
213;My kids, ages 9 and 10 enjoyed this movie.
214;I just wanted to say that I grew up watching the Back to the Future trilogy and will be the first to say that these movies are absolutely brilliant.
215;They are good on so many levels.
216;The great thing is, the older I get, and the more I watch them, the more I catch that is interesting or funny.
217;it just keeps getting better.
218;these movies are so quotable, my whole family is always dropping lines from these movies and friends as well.
219;The cast is so perfect, Micheal J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Flea, and whoever plays Biff, every one of them.
220;spielberg is to be commended on blessing this world with something so truly enjoyable.
221;some of the great elements of this movie include the great acting done by the main stars.
222;Fox plays his character almost to perfectly, so well that it can't be imagined being done by anyone else.
223;Lea Thomson as his mother also seems to fit the role as both his 80's mom and the teenager he will meet up with in the 50's.
224;All in all the actors as well as the story make this a timeless classic.
225;Its full of great special effects, brillient story and it could have been made at any time, it still is a wonderful watch every time.
226;The original is always the best.
227;Nearly 30 years after it was released, this fun, clever and unpredictable movie is still a delight to watch.
228;produced 80's nostalgia, Back to the Future is a masterpiece that works on so many levels.
229;The screenplay is what truly breathes life into this film.
230;crafted, filled with rich, relatable characters, and has some of the most inventive and exciting scenes in film history, ones that are repeatedly parodied and paid tribute to.
231;Robert Zemeckis' sharp camerawork perfectly keeps up with the non.
232;Every single actor in the film is so well suited for their respective characters, especially Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, and Crispin Glover.
233;Back to the Future is the model for 80's family movies, a genre which thrived in that decade for one simple reason: they weren't afraid to take chances and be weird!
234;I was so impressed that I actually went out and bought the video, and I didn't even have a VCR at the time!
235;I watched it at least once a year for the next 8 years, and it never got old.
236;I hope sincerely that the studio considers re.
237;We remembered this movie and that it had a good storyline, but we did not remember the extreme use of offensive language.
238;Cromulus enjoys Back to the Future.
239;Michael J Fox in one of his best roles.
240;and we are only about 2 years away from the cubs winning the world series and hoover boards
241;I've always loved this movie, and everything about it.
242;The directing, production, acting, story, just literally everything.
243;I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone!
244;time best, most enjoyable movies for ages 13 and up.
245;Our adult children know the wording by heart.
246;He should enjoy putting the car together more after he's seen the movie, I hope.
247;wise, I did find the direction quite good.
248;He also successfully introduced all the major characters .
249;i liked the 50's sequences as well.
250;overall I found it enjoyable.
251;I prefer old movies as a rule.
252;and I doubt if I'd watch it very often, but I can very much recommend it to you if you want something fun for an evening.
253;I enjoyed viewing this film that I have not seen since 1986.
254;o. Marty McFly: Jesus George, it's a wonder I was even born.
255;Marty McFly: Yeah, well, let's keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay?
256;dr. Emmett Brown: There's that word again.
257;This is a great movie.
258;I enjoy just relaxing and watching this movie and would recommend it to everyone
259;Loved going back to 1984 and 1955 in this movie with Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd.
260;It is a good movie to watch again.
261;Marty McFly and Doc Brown will forever be a great duo.
262;A great movie for its time.
263;Back To The Future is always a fun movie, one of the best family movies of the time for science fiction I enjoyed it again so much I bought the trilogy
264;Wonderful movie that has aged well.
265;The story is original and the dialogue is witty.
266;This is a cult classic for a reason.
267;This will always be one of my favorite movies.
268;I always notice a new detail every time I watch it.
269;I have been a longtime fan of back to the future, and am fortunate enough to have an extremely rare VHS copy of the movie ()Not some garden variety ripped off of TBS version.)
270;This is an awesome movie.
271;back to the future is one of the best movies of all time.
272;this is such a great movie.
273;this is a classic christopher lloyd and michael j fox are great together in this movie.
274;it is full of comedy and surprises.
275;We watched this movie for the first time in many years because our grown daughter had seen it again after a long time and said she enjoyed it very much.
276;Sure enough the movie charmed us again and we had a good time laughing along with it for almost two hours.
277;my wife, who is not a fan of this sort of movie, had fun watching it and stayed through the entire movie and that is a big compliment as she will walk out the moment the movie stops holding her attention in a pleasant and entertaining way.
278;after watching it I have developed an interest in seeing the other two although our daughter warned us they are not as good as the first one.
279;this one I can recommend for the entire family.
280;Great movie, looking for the trilogy for my father for christmas.
281;This is a classic story for the times and will always be going forward.
282;Fantastic story line, action, acting and music.
283;There is some really great entertainment from the 80's afterall.
284;Bravo to Amazon for having these older films available to stream on demand.
285;Image looked great and we had a lot of fun watching good old fashioned entertainment with our daughters.
286;I loved this movie and the actors.
287;Also, the whole Trilogy was great.
288;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen!
289;Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic.
290;Robert Zemeckis, who later on would direct such jewels as Forrest Gump and Castaway, shows just how good of a director he is and his ability to have a little fun while doing it to.
291;If you have not seen it yet, you will have a blast with this outstanding film from the eighties.
292;You've gotta love this movie!
293;Love, love, love Michael J Fox!
294;She now wants to see them all.
295;This film shows a rare understanding of time paradoxes.
296;The special effects are well up to the standard we would expect for a Spielberg film (O. k., it's a Zemeckis film!)
297;, and the idea of the car being the time travel ship is very clever.
298;Added to this are a good, but rather Doctor Who influenced portrayal of a scientist by Christopher Lloyd, and a very likeable lead actor in Michael J. fox and the result is an enjoyable adventure story for all the family.
299;BACK TO THE FUTURE is crisp, clean, witty, ingenious pull.
300;michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd strike up such an incredible chemistry.
301;that I was hoping these guys would subsequently open up a sports bar on Long Beach and continue their interaction in front of wide.
302;"Marty's subsequent quest is delightful, entertaining, and downright funny
303;kudos to director Robert Zemeckis for providing such an entertaining, finely crafted, well.
304;old son's first time viewing this movie.
305;But the movie is graced with outstanding performances by Fox and Lloyd (who have a great on.
306;screen rapport), and with great supporting turns by Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas Wilson.
307;Zemeckis paces Back to the Future perfectly, and leaves us all wanting a sequel even before we spy To Be Continued in the credits.
308;There are films that are good, and there are films that exhibit that extra something special that renders them truly great, endlessly entertaining no matter how times one sees them.
309;Back to the Future is a great film, one that might appear to some people superficially slick and commercial, but which after repeated viewings clearly proves itself to be a cinematic triumph, an effort that will stand the test of time.
310;The three BTTF films actually comprise one long, inventive, clever, and hiliarious presentation that never disappoints.
311;Everything about this film is thoughtfully crafted and gorgeously executed: the casting, the acting, the writing, and camera work, the editing, and the music.
312;Even a lot of the little details in casting and dialog are unforgettable.
313;Of course, one of the true highlights of the first BTTF film is the impressionistic but highly accurate portrayal of Hill Valley, 1955, including the hilarious sequence in which a car pulls into the Texaco station and is promptly greeted by four uniformed service station employees providing old.
314;As long as one doesn't take too seriously or think too hard about the time travel paradoxes that abound, this film is sure to please.
315;I have seen this movie at least 20 times, and it is always a great one to watch.
316;Legendary film that should be in everyone's collection.
317;Zemeckis may have since descended into madness with computer animation, but here he's on top of his game.
318;We watched it Christmas day and really enjoyed it.
319;I've aged and films have been subject to many technical improvements"
320;Others should also be entertained.
321;This show is funny as hell!
322;Everybody should own this show period!
323;The perfect role for Michael J Fox, and Christopher Lloyd is perfect as well.
324;Excellent picture starring Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd.
325;This movie had the magic and the chemistry all the way through that make family pictures great.
326;well he does affect history in a good way for Marty's dad and family.
327;a great role for Lloyd) has to get McFly back to his time 1985.
328;This is really full of suspense and comedy.
329;Biff was just a great heel in this movie.
330;A highly recommended family science fiction/comedy movie.
331;This film is an all out classic in my mind.
332;The plot is very smart and quirky.
333;Also Christopher Lloyd as the stereotypical Mad scientist with the big hair and excentric voice is all out hilarious.
334;This Film is worth seeing again and again.
335;Fun for the whole family.
336;There are a few bad words in the movie, but if you can get through that, the kids will enjoy it too.
337;My 11 year old son loved it and is telling all of his friends about it.
338;It has been tackled umpteen times in films before, but I believe that in Back to the Future it has never been done in such a great and captivating way.
339;It's all just so well done.
340;The attention to detail is also very good.
341;It ranks up there with my favorites.
342;Even though this movie is 15 years old it's still fresh and I doubt it will age with time.
343;A wonderful film for the family.
344;This is one of my favorite movies.
345;It is one of the most highly entertaining movies to come out of the 80s'.
346;while the idea isn't all that original, I think the approach is unique.
347;I also think that the actors, both Michael J. Fox and especially Christopher Lloyd really make this movie a great one for multiple viewings.
348;i really loved this movie when it came out because it made me laugh and it was very entertaining.
349;I was also a big Huey Lewis fan, and both him(a very small role in the beginning) and his music are in the film.
350;this was a very popular movie when it came out, and with the Universal Studios ride, I think it's popularity emerged back up.
351;There are two sequels, but this is the best of the series.
352;it's funny and the acting is great all around.
353;i think it's a good film for the whole family to watch together.
354;One of the best movies I've ever seen.
355;Probably one of the best movies from the 80's.
356;I watch this when I was young and now I'm watching it with my kids!
357;This is a classic, no need to write too much about it.
358;This is a family favorite of ours, from my 4 year old to my hubs, this trilogy is one of our go.
359;Grab your popcorn and take a trip back in time!
360;Well worth revisiting if you haven't seen it in awhile.
361;It's a perfect movie for a family night.
362;We knew he would enjoy it.
363;It was perfect on the computer though.
364;This is a great classic movie from my childhood years.
365;Amazon Instant Video was easy to use and worked good.
366;"strict school principal, Strickland
367;makes a protagonist for whom you really want to stick around (thanks in great part to the inimitable Mr. Fox), and Christopher Lloyd as Doc creates a mad scientist character who is insanely brilliant, funny, and heroish all at the same time.
368;Love the actors, love the time period, love the sets, love the story, and love Einie Doc's beloved dog named after Einstein!
369;This was just as good as the first time I saw it when it was first released .
370;Just watched it the other day with my 13 yr old grand daughter and she loved it !
371;What a timeless movie !
372;With some of the movies that are coming out these days, this movie will never be challenged as my favorite movie of all time.
373;This is the kind of movie that you can watch again and again"
374;micheal J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd really steal the show in this movie.
375;Lloyd is perfect as the zany scientist.
376;This movie will be a classic for a long time to come.
377;You know you love this movie.
378;Stop what you're doing now and watch it.
379;Watch it four times in a row.
380;"Look at me
381;Just watched this film again for the first time in well over a decade and except for a few """"future"""" references, I was pleased to see the film is just as much fun as when I first saw it."""
382;still a lot of fun and I'm glad I went back and watched it again.
383;Very happy with the movie.
384;This is a classic for the entire family to enjoy.
385;No matter what year it is, the movie still rocks.
386;It is the only movie I know that deals with time travel in a humorous yet surprisingly realistic manner for the 80s.
387;Always loved this movie, fun to watch and of course the actors who are in it really make this a good family film.
388;The trilogy is so much fun.
389;I'm not very happy at this item.
390;I like a happy endingD.
391;I like having to struggle to survive, U. square.
392;This movie is a classic of all time.
393;A true trilogy, but every film does hold its own.
394;Great casting of Christopher Lloyd to play the senile and crazy Doc Brown who invents time travel.
395;Great movie, great cast (including BIFF) and a movie I watch over and over and over.
396;always will be an icon of my younger days!
397;Anyway, for anyone who hasn't seen this, this is a timeless classic.
398;It is a fulfilling movie with a growing fandom which is filled with wonderfully creative people.
399;The thought of time travel appeals to so many, I hope it appeals to you too!
400;I would absolutely recommend both the film and of course Amazon, who I promote regularly.
401;One of the few of its type that actually has decent sequels.
402;Christopher Lloyd won best supporting actor in this for a reason.
403;See it and watch him steal the show.
404;Great for the whole family.
405;It has everything: action, romance, comedy, drama, and a cool car too.
406;Thoughtful and inventive writing with acting playing on ones fantasies and hopes.
407;Fun adventure and very entertaining.
408;BACK TO THE FUTURE is a well.
409;Couldn't the writers have given him at least some sense of humanity?That aside, the film is very entertaining.
410;It came in a nice and secure package.
411;It had been a long time since I had watched this and my husband I thought it would be fun to watch with my two boys.
412;/ My kids loved it and can't wait to watch 2 and 3!
413;this one is even better than I remembered.
414;I love this blast from the past although this movie does not go into the future like the title states.
415;This movie is still having a huge impact on me 14 years after it's release.
416;The soundtrack is brilliant I play it atleast every other day.
417;It is a mind blowing experience, and a wondorous trilogy.
418;From a time of great hits, the early to mid 80's brought us the likes of Gremlins and Ghostbusters.
419;Despite all these setbacks and more Back to the Future finally hit the screen to become the highest grossing film of 1985, and launching one of the most loved trilogies of all time.
420;marty McFly is a regular high school teenager.
421;He has a hot girlfriend.
422;His best friend is a local scientist and inventor.
423;written by Bob Gale based on the concept of would him and his dad be friends if they were in high school together, Back to the Future is a masterpiece.
424;All of the characters are well written and rounded (with the possible exception of the school bully, Biff Tannen) and the plot takes us somewhere foreign yet familiar, magical but still down to earth.
425;BttF is a true testament to all the components coming together to make a film perfect.
426;everyone in this movie is practically known for who they play in this movie, not because they haven't gone on to do other great things, but because they fit the characters so perfectly.
427;Same for Christopher Lloyd, he'll always be Doc Brown.
428;I love sci fi and I love this movie.
429;it has scratches on it.
430;Childhood favorite that I still love today.
431;Really gets the imagination going.
432;Great for kids and great for adults!
433;Christopher Loyd and Michael J fox are awesome in this movie!
434;Excellent visual effects and the actors are great.
435;Sounds really good in suround sound!!!
436;Sound track is done very well.
437;the movie is one the whole family can watch, it is rated PG.
438;What else can you say about this movie, it is a classic film and a good addition for a collector.
439;Still, know it about word for word and enjoy memories of.
440;great story line that never grows old.
441;One of the best damn trilogy's ever!
442;Because the idea and script are sharp as are Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd's performances.
443;Nevertheless the acting by the supporting cast is good all around and the directing is top notch!
444;I liked the movie very much.
445;The actors are perfect in their parts and blend well together.
446;Also this movie fits well with Back To the Future II.
447;Love this movie so much.
448;Can't wait to share it with the next generation in my family.
449;my 9 year old loved it.
450;a classic, my whole family loves this movie!
451;would definitely recommend to watch with family.
452;fiction, comedy, action, adventure, romance, and a teen movie.
453;Combining all of that with the direction of Robert Zemeckis and the charm of Michael J Fox and you pull a really good movie out of something that could have been really cheesy and dumb.
454;Doc calls Marty and tells Marty to meet him at 1 am at the Twin Pines Mall.
455;As the car hits 88 miles per hour, Marty is sent back in time (the particular day is the day Doc came up with the idea for time travel).
456;this is such a sweet movie.
457;It is funny, and is still a blast to watch after all these years.
458;What helps make this movie as good as it is (besides the absolutely stellar performances by everyone in the cast) is the attention to detail.
459;Every action affects something else, both in the era the scene happens in as well as in the future.
460;Back to the Future is one of my favorite movies (and movie series) and it is a welcome part of my collection.
461;I love time travel movies.
462;package received in great condition.
463;One of the greatest modern classics.
464;A friend of mine .
465;award movie, but it's good.
466;It has a pretty good sci fi story plot.
467;if you like action, you'll like this one.
468;Back To The Future is a true classic.
469;This movie is so 80s, and I love the 80s.
470;This movie is full of laughs and excitement from beginning to end.
471;Alan Silvestri's score is wonderful!
472;The special effects are top.
473;The actors are wonderful in their roles!
474;Watched it with kids for the first time.
475;They thought it was hilarious.
476;Funny to see that 80s garb.
477;It was in perfect condition when it arrived.
478;Today, we have amazing capabilities in CGA, capture technologies, and special effects.
479;"But feel the love here: they built a town square set, meticulously remade the 1950s, and then ""aged"" it for it's run."
480;Most great movies are just that.
481;We identify with the protagonist, the archetypal wise.
482;But finally, we identify with everyone.
483;"Even the scientist, who, in a wonderful moment in all screen history, expresses the Dr. Frankensteinian triumph but in a way that makes us all share his joy: ""It Works!!"""
484;What could be more American than that?The final reason is found with the second and third movies.
485;I think this movie was the best of all the time travel movies, the comedy is fun, the adventure is breathtaking, and the stars are wonderful.
486;I love the part when Michael J. Fox gets to meet Christopher Lloyd for the very first time in 1955.
487;Back to the future is a thrill ride for any viewer and should be considered one of the #1 movies of our time.
488;Then you continue to watch it and as you do you notice things you didnt notice the first two times.
489;It is a fun movie you can watch again and again and even continue the fun with part two and three of back to the future one of the greatest movie trilogies.
490;Watched this with my 4 boys and loved it all over again!
491;I look forward to watching the sequels with the boys as well!
492;Back to the Future(1985) is still a classic.
493;He comes from an unhappy family and he's friends with the eccentric Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd).
494;Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale jam packed Back to the Future with suspense.
495;Alan Silvestri's epic, sweeping, energetic, multi.
496;layered music scores for all three Back to the Future movies sound great.
497;It spawned two solid sequels and a cartoon show on CBS.
498;Back to the Future The Ride at Universal Studios was cool and I got a chance to ride it before it closed down in 2007.
499;Douglas Trumbull's visual effects for the ride were first rate!
500;The movie is of course a classic.
501;This series is great and one of my first introductions to the sci.
502;This is a classic favorite that all families should see.
503;There are three movies in the series and every one of them is unique and worth watching.
504;Its not very often to see a movie these days that becomes a true classic.
505;When you see a great movie, you immediately know that its destine to become a classic and that's the feeling I got when I first watched this movie.
506;Time travel has always captivated if not amused audiances for years and never has it been accomplished more cleverly than in this film.
507;The script is really good, the director (Zemeckis) does what is expected of him, and the cast is perfect for the characters.
508;Christopher Lloyd has just the right mad.
509;scientist face to fit Doc Brown, Michael J. Fox is the eternal teenager always unconsciously falling in some kind of trouble, Crispin Glover is the likable idiot by the hilarious name of McFly (Hey McFly!)
510;"It's a question everybody makes sooner or later, and ""Back to the future"" answers it in a brilliant way."
511;The catastrophic nature of young Marty McFly is a hook for lots of good jokes and scenes through the whole movie.
512;machine is a beautiful car, and has a strange story of its own.
513;some of the dialogue and the scenes are forever impressed in my mind.
514;what happened to the actress Claudia Wells, Marty's girlfriend Jennifer in the first movie?The other two movies in the series are also very good, but this one is the best, and one of the most entertaining movies I've ever watched.
515;If you are a car buff of any type, you must see this.
516;Back to the Future is, in my humble opinion, the best movie of all time.
517;My kids loved it, and it was fun to see again after 20 years!
518;The original proves that a great story can stay alive for many future generations.
519;This movie is a classic.
520;I enjoy introducing my grandchildren to this movie.
521;It is a movie for all ages.
522;The humor in this first movie is good for all ages.
523;Just enjoyed introducing my six year old granddaughter to it.
524;The action is great, as well the music.
525;For critics that enjoy seeing films that are intelligently entertaining than this might be or become your favorite film.
526;Mostly others will enjoy it's special effects, acting, originality, and comedy.
527;Surely this is Michael J. Fox's and Christopher Llyod's milestone and movie of remembrance!
528;One will enjoy the film's approach to the theory and portail of time travel and it's traits.
529;This movie captured the minds of many and still intrigues many people today.
530;The first installment went so well that Zemeckis made two additonal sequels and Universal extended its enjoyment and boundraies of stimulators when Back to the Future the Ride was built.
531;The most amazing aspect is that Back to the Future lives on today thanks to Universal Studios.
532;the RideLooking Back to the FutureBack to the Future NightMichael J. Fox QFor the bonus features, I will double dip for this special edition.
533;Very creative and fun family movie that we enjoyed very much.
534;"The acting and storyline went hand in hand
535;This a good movie, on video.
536;The concept of the three movies was terrific .
537;the continuity was absolutely superb, its as though the trilogy was planned from day one, with the additional camera angles, etc.
538;One of the three best movies EVAR.
539;My children love it as much as I do.
540;This is one of my favorite 80s movies, and this is from a guy who was to young to comprehend movies before 1985.
541;I saw it for the first time on video many years ago, and I still can't forget the craziness that happens with the mix of 50s and 80s.
542;Watch this movie and you're definitely in for a jolt of 1.21 jigowatts!
543;old from crying or wanting to go to the bathroom during it's showing is a EXCELLENT piece of cinematic art, and this movie is definitely that.
544;A great film to share with a younger generation.
545;Both kids enjoyed it as much as I did when I was a youngster!
546;Amazon, if you want me to rate your stuff, keep it simple.
547;i fairly enjoyed this movie.
548;i recomend it to anyone.
549;This movie has incredible writers.
550;The storyline is well developed, the acting is incredible.
551;So many things done well: foreshadowing, twists and turns, and enough action to keep you on your toes.
552;Always enjoy the nostalgia of the first one since I was born in 1955.
553;The trilogy is fun to watch back.
554;enjoyed watching this w/our kids .
555;it was a great way to relive our teenage years, w/our now teenagers.
556;My kids enjoyed this as much as I did when it first came out.
557;And they loved the ending.
558;Marty gets to see his whole family when they were younger.
559;Robert Zemeckis' excellent film starring Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd is one of my favourite movies of all time.
560;Back to the Future has so many clever moments and a sense of fun throughout the film.
561;Michael J. Fox is excellent, and Christopher Lloyd is in trademark crazy scientist mode.
562;Add Alan Silverstris' memorable score, Spielberg's nice homage's.
563;the theatre in 1955 when Marty goes back in time is showing a double bill: A Boy's Life (the working title for Spielberg, Steven's E. t. the Extra.
564;terrestrial), and Watch the Skies (the working title for Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977).
565;The film, when it was released got excellent reviews, and became the biggest box.
566;The sequels are great too, but this is still the best, and the most inventive.
567;The film I like the most is 'Back to the Future'.
568;The boy moved by 30 years before.
569;I also liked very much scientist's speculations on the collapsion of Universe when someone sees himself in future or past.
570;This was a gift for a friend, but it is a great, classic movie, and the receiver was ecstatic to receive it!
571;But with the help of the Doc in the past, Marty has hope after all.
572;The night of a famous Hill Valley lightning storm lies to be the answer.
573;When we first got our old VCR, this was our first tape!
574;:)Love Michael, the movie and the series.
575;release this wonderful movie on video.
576;It is a one of a kind treasure.

586;I enjoyed seeing it with her after I'm.
587;with respect to the actual movie, it is great.
588;It is just the way I remember it.
589;If you are nostalgic and have seen it once, see it again.
590;If you've never seen it and are in to science fiction, see it for the first time.
591;For the price, it's worth taking a chance even for the one or two fuddy duddy's with limited sense of humor and imagination.
592;This has been one of my favorite movies since I was little!
593;I loved this movie when it first came out in 1985.86.
594;The third sequel was better, and took us back again to a more nostalgic era in time.
595;Thumbs up on the whole lot.
596;it was okay as well.
597;recently starting introducing my 13 and 9 year old to movies i grew up watching and they love them and they loved this movie and we are all looking forward to seeing part two!
598;both Marty and the Doc are hilarious!
599;I got this movie to show my kids and grandkids about the time were movies were funny and entertaining without nudity, violence or foul language.
600;Twenty something years later, Back to the future still rocks!
601;also the coverart is awesome.

604;old high school student whose best buddy is Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd).
605;One night, Brown introduces Marty to something extraordinary: a time machine made from a DeLorean.
606;It remains director Robert Zemeckis' best work.
607;This is a wonderful story for those who love science fiction and are a big fan of Michael J. Fox.
608;This, the first and original film, if the best of the trilogy.
609;Great fun and wonderful performances
610;Back to the Future is one of those movies that you love to watch over and over again.
611;caricatured characterizations to the various clever time travel ideas.
612;One gag that really is funny is the time traveler's amazement at a super.
613;Always a fun movie to watch.
614;Well casted and still funny.
615;I Love This One I Bought The Video In 1986 When It Was Available On Video But I Also Seen It In Theathers In July '85 But I Love It This One Is The Best If You Wanna Talk Talk Sci.
616;I enjoy Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd as actors.
617;He knocks Biff out cold and gets together with Lorraine!
618;I highly recommend this movie.
619;It's hard to think of a movie that manages to have so many truly great and well defined characters in it.
620;Couple that with the great story, time travel enigmas, and an epic 1980's car, this movie has it all.
621;There is no dead space in this movie, it is unforgettable scene after unforgettable scene.
622;This is one of the best movies ever, whats taking so long Zemeckis?
623;And I hope it will be loaded with special features like: interviews with the cast, deleted scenes, scenes never seen before and all the works.
624;With a great cast including Michael J. Fox as Marty Mcfly and Christopher Llyod as Doc Brown.
625;If you have any info on the release of this please e. mail me.
626;The audio commentary by Fox, Zemekis, and Lloyd are a hoot!
627;Hi, this is the best movie ever!!!
628;all the actors are perfect for their part.
629;The original Back to the Future is still a gem for the entire family.
630;Almost all the laughs are still funny.
631;Back to the Future really is just a very fun movie.
632;After seeing this movie, it might really be fun to do just that.
633;And then of course we have Doc Brown, who Christopher Lloyd played perfectly.
634;honestly, I could go on and on and on about this movie and just tell the whole story.
635;But what fun would that be.
636;I love watching old 80's flicks and seeing all the stuff that was cool back then.
637;I love this movie and have watched it many, times in the last 30 years.
638;Last night I introduced it to my 20 year old son and he really enjoyed it as well!
639;Michael J. Fox is a fresh.
640;faced boy in perfect comedic form and Christopher Llyod's crazy antics keep you laughing throughout as the mad scientist who created the time machine.
641;This movie is so funny, and never dull.
642;I enjoyed watching this with my kids almost 30 years after I first watched it.
643;This is a pretty fun movie which is a cool look at time travel.
644;Of the 80's, this is definitely one of the best films of the decade.
645;My boys love these too.
646;This movie was made in the mid 1980's and is still just as fresh today as when it was first released.
647;And everyone seems to remember the flux capacitor!Christopher Llloyd and Michael J. Fox give the performances of their career.
648;This film is on my favorite movies list, and I would gladly recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor!
649;Besides the Blues Brothers, this is my favorite movie.
650;I'd reccomend this movie to anyone!
651;This movie holds up amazingly well after all these years.
652;BACK TO THE FUTUREthis experience is as good a movie now, as it was in 1985.
653;back to the future is a rewarding family experience that combines learning about technology and science """"no this sucker is electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts for the time distortion field"""", family values """"marty you have got to save your father now, or else he will be ERASED!"""
654;and a fun time into one great experience.
655;It's a great and funny scene.
656;also included is the footage of the back to the future ride that used to be at Universal Studios.
657;I went on that ride in 1993 (who cares), and it was great to see it again.
658;it's like a news cast and security camera video telling you about Doc's 1 day ride into the future (fictional) and the second video is what you actually saw when on the ride as you chase Biff Tannin through time.
659;Just take note that the ride itself, you sat in a 6 seat Delorean and it moved and rocked around, so it may lose some translation while your sitting on your butt.
660;If you are like me, and love anything you can find of BTTF, you will enjoy this one.
661;in release, it does actually have brand new features to enjoy.
662;There are few movies that I will watch more than once or twice, the entire Back to the Future trilogy is part of that last.
663;The creativity of this film is unmatched.
664;I love the acting from Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd.
665;Show it to your kids and watch it again and again.
666;My whole family enjoyed this movie.
667;In my view this is one of the greatest films ever made.
668;I tink it is the best of the trilogy and cannot be missed.
669;Everyone has seen it at least once in their lives and everyone I know that has seen it thought it was amazing.
670;Chris Lloyd plays the mad scientist and does it with enthusiasm and great character.
671;It might not appeal to some but it has a great story and will keep you watching for the whole movie.
672;Robert Zemeckis did an amazing job of bringing this film to where it is now with some of the best special effects in the 80's.
673;Michael J Fox is fun to watch along with Christopher Lloyd in this classic film.
674;Waited until my kids were old enough to understand (age 9 and 11) and they loved the funny antics as well as the concept of time travel.
675;I choose this rating cuz it was a good movie I loved this movie cuz it was the back to the future.
676;Michael is a wonderful actor I did not like how you could tell that a lot of the effects in the movie was fake but it is a classic movie.
677;I would recommend this movie to a family that has movie night or to anyone.
678;this film is a great film.
679;going back in time making it all work is the charm of this film.
680;but this is Arguable Michael J Fox's best film.
681;What really made Back to the Future interesting was the 30 years cultural difference the movie brought in to you.
682;We enjoyed watching this a family this past week.
683;This is a movie that both children and adults will love.
684;It's entertaining, funny and very enjoyable.
685;Michael J. Fox was wonderful as Marty McFly.
686;Wanted to share this movie with my teenagers, and they loved it.
687;We had fun watching it together.
688;Micheal J Fox rocks and Christopher L superb!!
689;This is a great movie, from the first time I saw it I loved it, and could not wait for part 2.
690;It's worth watching, at least the first movie.
691;Anyone who knows Michael J. Fox knows this would be a great movie!
692;Don't like the sequels but this movie is the best!
693;Love the music and how they go back to the future!!
694;Love Michael J. Fox ~ he plays a great part!
695;A real feel good movie!!
696;Michael J Fox was great.
697;We enjoyed the plot and it was simply entertaining.
698;screen brilliance of director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg in this cinematic treat, and is a prime example of two actors feeding off of each other's draw and thrusting their film into a classic rank among others of its kind.
699;Full of friendly, funny quotables.
700;The most compelling, wonderful movie.
701;It's so magical and perfectly integrated.
702;i absolutely love this movie.
703;It will be #1 in my book for all time!
704;I'm glad my own children are at an age to appreciate this great film from my high school years from the 80s.
705;A Bit of rock n' roll, love, a mad scientist.
706;"Only the ""alien creature"" that he uses to scare his father (the whimpy teen) reinforces the idea in his mind to marry Michael J Fox's mother!The stereotypes are silly but enjoyable, the plot is easy to follow and you have sense of affinity with the ""doc"" and Michael J Fox's role."
707;any Back to the Future movie is good.
708;No. 3 is my favorite though.
709;it sucks how Michael has Parkinson's disease now!
710;But still, great movie and great concept for kids.
711;if you believe that the product you are reviewing is unsafe, please report this information to the
712;it reminds me of a child watchen the movie thats why i bought it it works great and in good shape
713;I always humm the theme song.
714;This movie will always be my favorite
715;I personally enjoy this movie :) I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good movie and some great action from the 80's!
716;This is probably my favorite movie trilogy of the 80's very funny and interesting.
717;if you watch the first one your going to love 2 and 3.
718;The 3rd one is my personal favorite but overall all of them are great movies.
719;Your going to love it
720;This is a very well written script that stands the test of time.
721;But still, this movie has everything, laughs, lite.
722;suspense, and just an all around good, clean family fun.
723;A classic I had to show my kids the movies of my younger life.
724;One of the funniest movies ever made.
725;My grandson loves this movie even though it is a oldie.
726;We enjoyed it ourselves when it first came out.
727;"I remember this movie as being an ""American Classic""
728;In an age where real entertainment is hard to come by, this modern classic is all the more welcome.
729;A script that is alive with wit and invention.
730;enlivening this highly original spin on the time.
731;Scriptwriters Robert Zemeckis (who also directed) and Bob Gale create a highly polished, tightly constructed narrative in which all events and dialogue are unified (so rare these days)"
732;Zemeckis adds to a stellar screenplay delightful pace and warmth in proportions reminescent of the old Hollywood masters.
733;Michael J. Fox, perhaps this generation's Mickey Rooney, is energetic and lovable in by far his best tailored role to date.
734;A big plus, the sexual themes are, for once, handled with a reasonable amount of discretion (and a minus, some of the language).
735;All in all, a refreshingly intelligent and exciting modern adventure!
736;It has been more than 20 years but it is still exciting, a fun movie to watch!
737;I loved it as a kid, I enjoy it even more as an adult.
738;Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are brilliant!
739;I have seen it in 1985 and again now!
740;Indeed, the humor is great, the action clean and fun and some good one liners.
741;it shows that we do not need gratuitous violence like in some of the movies now, to have a really Must movie to see even have!
742;the whole family loves this movie.
743;It has always been my favorite movies of all time.
744;I had a blast sharing the experience with my 10 year old who loves it too!
745;One my most favorite movies of the 1980's I highly recomend watching this :) This is also a good family movie too
746;The Back To The Future trilogy ig absolutely awesome!!
747;One of the best modern movies ever made.
748;Combines action, great acting and a mix of comedy and suspense.
749;My wife and I got a bit nostalgic as we were talking about movies from the 80's.
750;Exciting action/scifi movie with all the standard attributes:car chasings, gun fire, fist fights.
751;as long as you don't object to the impossible time travel,the rest of the movie is entertaining and energizing.
752;and there is nice jazzy muzic, when they reach 1955.
753;the time travel is accomplished by using a remote.
754;all in all, it's a very well done movie!Over the course of our lives, we see things change, just as it is portrayed in the movie,so the movie makes sense to me.
755;that's why I give it a full 5 stars rating and two thumbs up!
756;Probably the most perfectly cast movie too.
757;Great characters, great blend of action/comedy/suspense.
758;George McFly steals the show.
759;This is the quintessential feel.
760;good movie of the 80's.
761;It's terrific just the same.
762;Supposedly this screenplay got rejected and laughed at for several years until Spielberg got his hands on it.
763;This is a great movie when you need to step back from the rat race!
764;It puts a smile on my face every time I watch it!
765;I remember watching this when I was about their age and wanted them to share in the fun.
766;Dr. Brown has invented the most fantastic time machine, one where you can travel 'in class', in a plutonium.
767;Finally, I got my chance while visiting my relatives.
768;And I must say, I enjoyed this movie IMMENSELY!
769;"Steven Spielberg (the director) has certainly been very successful in his movie making and ""Back to the Future"" is surely a classic!The plot is actually very well written, interlacing good action, suspense, and plenty of humor."
770;The movie is filled with sarcastic and hilarious lines (Ronald Reagan becomes president!)
771;But one of the best things about the movie for me is the utterly satisfying ending.
772;And yet the ending is so well.
773;written you can't help but feel a bit surprised.
774;"Also the music is very terrific, ""Johnny B. Good"", ""Power of Love"", and ""Back in Time""."
775;but the best thing about the movie is the outstanding performance by Michael J. Fox.
776;Wow, he is such a terrific actor!
777;And him being who he is, he handles the role of a 17 year old perfectly.
778;He is so absolutely cool from where he kicks his skateboard up, when he at the end slides across the hood of the DeLorean, where he 'plays' some very mean guitar, and where he teaches Biff and his gang a lesson.
779;A bit of trivia, Crispin Glover who plays Michael J. Fox's father is actually three years YOUNGER than him!
780;":)Well, my conclusion is, if you still haven't seen ""Back to the Future"", I highly recommend it!"
781;This is an awesome time.
782;In case you are new to the series, I'll give you a brief synopsis.
783;I highly recommend that you go BACK TO THE FUTURE!!!
784;This is a classic movie of the 1980's!!
785;Just a fun movie that has some nice reenactments of the past!!
786;Great movie for the whole family.
787;This one made it to our family library, movies that we want to own (because watching once just isn't enough!)
788;this one is the best of the trilogy, but if you've got this one, you've got to have the other two .
789;Great movie, best of the trilogy.
790;There are movies that inspire, movies that educate, movies that thrill an audience, movies that make us laigh etc.
791;"Occassionally there comes along a movie that is pure fun
792;Back to the Future is one such movie.
793;filmed fun """"what if"""" story of time travel."""
794;"well, ""Back to the Future"" will show you just what it could lead to."
795;as I mentioned, this is a fun movie.
796;There's an irreverance in this movie that works well.
797;I like message films that can deliver the message but sometimes it's nice to sit back and just enjoy a masterful bit of fun.
798;Back to the Future is just such a movie.
799;ray player that can stream and my two Roku boxes.
800;The convenience is great and the movie streams nicely.
801;I believe without a doubt that back to the future is the best film ever!!!!
802;It has everything you'd want in a film exitement, comedy, action, adventure, you name it, it's got it!
803;Michael J Fox is my all time favourate actor and this is one of his best acting credits along with the two sequels which are also very good.
804;(Michael J Fox is gorgeous!!!!!!!!)
805;Still it was worth the amount I paid.
806;My family loves watching this movie!
807;It's funny with a great story line!
808;I just watch with my 9 year old son and he loved it.
809;One of my favorites classic that anybody can watch at any age.
810;Great movie for all ages.
811;It has many life lessons we share with our church youth group.
812;Love this old movie, and my kids (9, 7 and 3) all stayed glued to the tv!
813;Reminds me of my childhood, go 80's!
814;It keeps taking me to the directors commentary.
815;I just want to watch the freakin' film!
816;Just give me a VHS tape, so it will work.
817;Hols up very well ( except for projecting flying cars by 2015).
818;Highly recommend it and Part 2.
819;I loved this movie always.
820;I saw this when it was made and loved it.
821;age 9 and this is his favorite all time movie(so far).
822;When he receives these gifts he will be so excited.
823;While this was never a perfect story, it still holds up well after all these years.
824;It is still funny and I got a kick out of letting my 10 year old know some hints ahead of time as the story was unfolding to try and keep him interested.
825;Michael J. Fox does a great job as Marty.
826;And Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown is a hoot.
827;The Calvin Klein scene is so funny.
828;hard fan and want the new flashy packaging, II and III are the same as in the trilogy pack.
829;Good 80s classic, great for family, especially middle schoolers that are unfamiliar with the mid 80's, Pepsi Free anyone?
830;Director Robert Zemeckis and actors Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd created a film that will last the test of time.
831;The 1980's brought about some pretty hair raising bands, but also brought us a movie that was ahead of it's time.
832;I can still sit around today almost 20 years later and enjoy the film as if it were the first time I had seen it.
833;Doc creates a time machine out of an autombile and plutonium after he had hit his head on the shower and had a vision of the flux capacitor.
834;Kind of crazy huh!Not to give it all away this is an excellent film that has sci.
835;fi, comedy, drama, teen romance, and adventure all in one package.
836;There have been a lot of movies about time machines, but this one seems never to grow old and Michael Jay Fox helps you feel like you are along for the ride.
837;highly recommend watching this movie so that you to can go on an adventure with Marty Mcfly.
838;Not much else to say, but this is a modern classic, and if you watch closely, the acting is actually really really good, in spite of being a comedy.
839;it should have less bad words but overall it was great.
840;Loved from beginning to the end , a movie that the whole family can enjoy, bring on the popcorn and enjoy
841;I enjoy them all so much.
842;Watched it for first time in my adult life and it's even better than I remembered.
843;I was in High School in 1985 and one of my memories of that year was going to see the movie Back to the Future .
844;Other then that, everyone enjoyed it.
845;Opens up kid's minds about science and also how we deal with adversity and opportunity in our present moment can impact our future.
846;What a thrill to see them again.
847;Michael J. Fox is a wonderful Actor.
848;I got this for my grandchildren and they loved it.
849;A viewer from L. a. rated this movie two stars.
850;Don't listen to him!Back to the Future is a great film to watch.
851;this is my favorite movie!!
852;it actually arrived well b4 the date it was supposed to come!
853;I really enjoyed this movie the first few times I saw it, but after that it just isn't exciting, moving, or believable enough to enjoy over and over again.
854;this is a wonderful little movie about travling to the past, and Michael J. Fox is wonderful at making his character work.
855;Christopher Lloyd is always fun to watch and he fits the character of the mad scientist very well.
856;This is one of the many movies that should be required for viewing.
857;Introducing my kids to some of the great movies I watched at their age.
858;Worth purchasing for your library.
859;I bought this for my younger nephew as a gift because he said he never heard of it.
860;I know he will love it.
861;I got this rerelease mainly because of the BTTF ride footage and the Leslie Nielson documentary.
862;This is a great 80s film and if you grew up in the 80s or just love retro 80s goodness, you should get this set.
863;Pretty funny still, maybe a little corny.
864;One look at the sequels and your appreciation for the original will be amply reinforced.
865;Michael J Fox in his usual funny, cute form.
866;This was probably one of his first movies and was such fun to watch.
867;Another good 80's movie that is one for the whole family.
868;Full of excitement and fun!
869;I have always LOVED the Back to the Future Films.
870;The movie itself worked great and the shipping was fast.
871;america, Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) enters a time machine created by an eccentric inventor(Christopher Lloyd) and goes back to the year 1955.
872;Zemeckis successfully and convincingly captures the look and feel of 1950s.
873;Christopher Lloyd and Crispin Glover are two of the greatest character actors in recent cinema.
874;i definitely plan to see this movie again on video.
875;BTTF is for people of all ages who loves movies.
876;It's a fun classic suitable for kind and adults.
877;Very enjoyable and very entertaining.
878;i wonder if Hollywood would still allow 'Libyan Terrorists' in the script.
879;This movie is great for the family even 20 years after it was made.
880;The story is great, the acting superb (especially by Christopher Lloyd .
881;Lots of great little jokes throughout.
882;old and was a bit surprised that the film that I remember as family entertainment has so much bad language in it, but that's okay .
883;we're all adults here, right?
884;This will be an all time great movie!
885;I got this for my nephews who are 14 and 11.
886;I think they are finally old enough to appreciate this funny movie.
887;The 1st in a series of 3 movies made popular a few years back.
888;I recommend seeing all 3 movies for fun, but this is a classic.
889;So I bought a copy.
890;It is pure entertainment and great acting.
891;Except I can't find the first Back to the Future to complete the set!
892;"The Back to the future&Dagger
893;the last scene that the father beated the boss is happy to me too.
894;but the story was very wonderful.
895;Anyway old, young, woman,man, it is the movie that everybody can enjoy.
896;One of the greatest movies of our time,,, How can you watch this movie and not love it?
897;this is entertainment at it's best!
898;Wholesome message and inventive story line.
899;The kids loved it and I always have.
900;I love This movie and I love Michael J. Fox.
901;What can I say other than this is just a fun movie filled with action, love and great lines.
902;Great family movie for all ages
903;This is a great film with plenty of action, suspense, comedy and a great story.
904;see if ur a fan of either science fiction, adventure or comedy.
905;Back to the Future may be the most enchanting comedy/adventure there is.
906;The film is a science fiction tale about a young man accidentally travelling back in time 30 years to the 1950's.
907;While lesser science fiction films would focus on the ideas of time paradoxes and hardware, Back to the Future focuses on open eyed wonder, charming characters, and plenty of good humor.
908;Marty's friend, Doc Brown, has perfected a plutonium powered time machine fashioned from a DeLorean sports car.
909;Back to the Future is the most perfectly balanced blend of science fiction, comedy, and adventure.
910;It is a film suitable for children from the 80's and 50's alike.
911;A great modern classic that should be in everyone's collection.
912;If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.
913;The film that rocketed Michael J. Fox to stardom is still one of Director, Robert Zemeckis' best films is a modernday family classic.
914;his dad, George, is a complete wimp and ultimate nerd, right down to the pocket protector.
915;Marty's brother, Dave works the night shift at the local Burger King (the one next to Doc Brown's lab), while Marty's sister is still in high school.
916;Marty, after some convincing, gets some serious help from a younger Doc Brown.
917;Then again, if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.
918;When Fox did come home he found people camped out on his front lawn waiting for him and his autograph!Christopher Lloyd is great as Doc Brown and should have gotten an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor.
919;He's the best mad scientist since Dr. Frankenstein himself.
920;the comic timing and chemistry between Fox and Lloyd is classic.20 years after its release, """"Back To The Future"""" still looks bright enough to wear shades."""
921;One of the greatest movies of all time.
922;Crispin Glover should have won an Oscar for playing the role of George McFly.
923;You know it and you most likely love it.
924;I have loved it since the first time I saw it back in 1985.
925;Back to the future is no doubt one of the best movies ever made, and maybe the greatest.
926;Moreover, it has such of genius plot that never seen before, and I'm afraid will never be seen either.
927;The 3 movies of Back to the Future are great.
928;Great story with great characters and setting it in 1985.
929;It lifts you and allows the mind to just enjoy the entertainment.
930;Zemeckis and Spielberg hit on all cylinders with this classic.
931;Fantastically energetic, inventive and clever.
932;All of the details and perfect blend of science fiction and comedy are brought together by three great actors in the movie (Christopher Lloyd, Michael J. Fox, and Crispin Glover).
933;It is truly aspiring to see how the world would be like with a time machine.
934;Definitely deserves my five stars!
935;We love this move and just showed it to our kids, now they love it too and are quoting it all the time.
936;Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking that it is impossible to forget about it.
937;The casting of every character involved is absolutely perfect, and the performances are spectacular.
938;Love this movie and had to share it with my 11 year old son AND he loved it too!!!
939;Still the best family fun movie!
940;This is the hit movie classic that made both Michael J. Fox and Christopher Llyod famous.
941;Created in 1985 is still reaches out to a generation 15 years in the future .
942;and I reckon it'll be popular past 2015 as well.
943;It's a classic, fast paced and very ingenious.
944;Not to mention the excellent casting.
945;This movie is as good as it was 30 years ago.
946;Especially that it was fun and sexy but not nasty.
947;Something to be said for romance!
948;these movies are comfort films to me and bring about memories and emotions not unlike those feelings I get from comfort foods, they just make me feel good.
949;Michael Fox reacts perfectly to the travel back in time scenario.
950;christopher Lloyd is a comic genius whose body language and facial expressions will have you in stitches.
951;As a nutty professor type trying to invent a time travel machine (and succeeding), he is also perfect for this film.
952;the headlong pacing, plus the humorous and inventive situations make this a fun movie for the whole family.
953;I think it really stands a testament to the story and film making abilities of the people who create a movie that over 20 years later it still is a good movie.
954;A very well crafted tale, good music and talented cast made this movie a hit.
955;Even the next two movies were well done and that made the whole experience of watching one right after the other a very good night for me and my family.
956;Love, commitment and a zany plot line that will race you through the lives of families and friends that genuinely care about each other.
957;Definitely something you don't see enough of in todays theatres.
958;Great movie and Christopher Lloyd does a phenomenal job in this classic movie.
959;The whole family gave it a thumbs up.
960;It's perfect in practically every way: premise, story, writing, dialogue, characters, direction, acting, editing, and music.
961;"i think this is the first ""time travel"" film in which the voyager returns, not to where he had been, but to a new and much improved reality."
962;"Back to the Future is a hilarious movie full of great performances that is entertaining time after time
963;One of my favorite movies.
964;Thats the power of love.
965;Enjoyed this when it first came out and enjoyed sharing with my son.
966;It is a great movie .
967;Watched this with my 13yo son.
968;Many stops and I have a solid connection.
969;That being said I should have bought the disc so we can watch it more often.
970;Back To The Future is a classic which consists of a great story, great acting and interesting, entertaining action.
971;Even the sound track is pretty good.
972;It is hilarious (""""Why don't you make like a tree."""
973;, and full of enough action and adventure to rival a Stallone or Schwarzenegger flick!The acting is also some of the best that cinema has to offer.
974;"Even the ""bit players"" are superb in their short, yet very important/meaningful appearances."
975;perhaps the most impressive thing about this entire film experience, though, is the detail put into each and every scene.
976;"thus, on my list of ""greatest movies of all."
977;Watch with confidence knowing there will never be a dull moment!
978;up performance by Christopher Lloyd (who I loved as Reverend Jim from Taxi ), and I've got yet another reason to enjoy it.
979;travel, the story plot is fairly simple and straightforward, with few complications.
980;Kinda like those Luke Leia moments in the Star Wars trilogy, only intentionally funny.
981;good comedy couched in a sci.
982;Just kick back and enjoy the ride.
983;joke, and it adds a humorous touch of irony to the scene.
984;Back To The Future is simply a timeless classic.
