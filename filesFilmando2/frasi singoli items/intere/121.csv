1;I bought this as a gift to my boyfriend.
2;Those are two reasons, right there, why the story is relevant.
3;Anyone who can stir up that much controversy is surely worth hearing.
4;As authors, most of us spend our lives spouting for all we're worth and hoping somebody .
5;i laughed out loud several times.
6;It's about life in an exciting and sometimes frightening time, and about some folks who liked to have fun, and just very cool in general.
7;It's quite an enjoyable bio about a quite interesting guy.
8;I respect his mind, and I was pleased to hear what he had to say, whether I agreed or not.
9;It's about one man's extraordinary journey, in pursuit of truth, whatever the hell that is.
10;I have nothing but respect for everyone involved with it.
11;Nothing to lose, brilliant, and just mean as all get.
12;Eat your heart out Snoop Dogg, and Malcolm dressed better than Deion Sanders to boot.
13;this film is very relevant, very moving, very important.
14;Most of it is terrific.
15;There are two discs of this film: part 1 and part 2.
16;I love the switch from ghetto to the change.
17;so it's a good thing I got this in my collection.
18;Beautiful movie and beautiful digi.
19;SAMUEL L. jACKSON was the directors's first choice to play the part, but he quarrelled with SPIKE ,so DENZEL got it.
20;it is interesting to see that the man made a few mistakes early in his life ,but he was able to recover and redeem himself.
21;any person who does something in helping his people to earn their rights deserves the highest praise.
22;This movie explained to me, and will to you, how this great American, yes .
23;helped the cause of Civil Rights.
24;Spike Lee is a great film maker.
25;Denzel Washington is a great actor (Could any other actor have given the spirit of Malcolm such a realistic treatment?)
26;Still, this film is a good primer in order to learn how the most honest revolutionary black liberation fighter in 20th century America earned his place in history.
27;see movie about an icon.
28;"rate performances
29;Nonetheless, you're getting this disc for the movie, which is one of the great ones, in my opinion.
30;plus there is lots of high.
31;The direction was a masterpiece!
32;Spike lee and Denzel at their best.
33;Hopefully people are able to grasp the full story.
34;This was truly an amazing movie.
35;It was both educational and entertaining!
36;That was the true turning point in his life.
37;My favorite month is February due to African American History (Black History Month)!
38;Malcolm X is definitely an inspiring individual.
39;This film is incredible and that's not even the half of it, you know it's phenomenal when they cast Denzel Washington as the main role.
40;much has been said about the 1992 film, so I'll concentrate on the extras.
41;It's at a good porportion.
42;But the edited scenes are really interesting.
43;A lot of people who miss the point about Malcolm's transformation should see those scenes (which actually appear in the original book).
44;there is also an excellent documentary about the making of this film.
45;The raw, uncut REAL Malcolm talking strong and taking numbers!
46;This is a brilliantly edited collection of chronological clips of Macolm, Elijham Muhammad, the young Louis Farrakhan, and all the other major players into an excellent biography without additional narration.
47;College and high school teachers will REALLY want this for their history classes.
48;Director Spike Lee presents a courtroom epic,very much like Oliver Stone's JFK,about the assassination of Malcolm Little,a civil rights leader,commonly known as Malcolm X. Malcolm X of course,followed in the footsteps of another now.
49;Denzel Washington plays Malcolm X. I'm sure Lee thought Washington was born to play the role.
50;Denzell's performance is almost as true to life as an actor can get.
51;islam """"husting"""" days, but I found it to be extrememly enjoyable, and essential."""
52;After Denzell, I think he gave the most impressive performance.
53;The Ossie Davis eulogy was moving, and brought tears to me even though I'm not black.
54;But all in all a spectacular film.
55;would recommend it to any and everyone !
56;There is no doubt, that this movie will be a classic enjoyed by generations to come.
57;This is a must see
58;It arrived within the time that was stated and I am very pleased.
59;Simply an amazing performance by Mr. Washington and shines an important spotlight on a misunderstood American hero.
60;This is when he realizes his own potential, leaves the organization, and rediscovers himself.
61;This movie deserves to be redone, and if its done right, could be phenomenal.
62;If we are to move in the future we must discuss and learn about the controversies of the past.
63;This includes Malcolm X, Nathan Bedford Forrest, and George Wallace.
64;He was proud of his race, loved the African American people and his family, and his rejection of the Nation of Islam to embrace Whites as brothers were very positive in improving race relations.
65;Very good and honest view of Malcolm X.
66;"He has learned a lot
67;The writing and directing capture the complexities and dynamics of Malcolm's progress.
68;perhaps even more amazing than the writing (which closely alligns with Malcolm's autobiograhy) and the directing is Denzel Washington's performance.
69;It may be the best acting in the history of American film.
70;Malcolm proclaimed that to release the human potential of the black man, he must first accept who he is, and more importantly be proud of his color.
71;this is the importance of Malcolm X: from his life (and legend)propagated the concept of black pride.
72;Indeed, Malcolm preached that in order for black people to gain respect, they must first develop respect for themselves.
73;What is even more admirable is his openness to change.
74;When I watched Spike Lee's Malcolm X on TV, it was a pleasurable surprise.
75;it tells the story of Malcolm X and shows the enormous changes he went through in his remarkable life.
76;Though the film often fails to take a really intimate look at Malcolm X, Denzel Washington's superlative performance successfully counters this weakness.
77;He keeps us interested in this man, despite the fact, that Lee's film, though it is exquisitely filmed, lacks the courage to explorethe person Malcolm X.
78;The film rather deals with the historical figure of Malcolm and the key events of his life.
79;Still, Malcolm X is one of the best biopics, not only because of Denzel Washington and the other very good actors.
80;I also liked the cinematography by Ernest Dickerson, the music and the production design which added to the authentic mood of the movie.
81;This is an excellent representation of black history in the '60s a story we ALL can learn from its very important that young people of all races know about this story not just that it was made but actually watch because it shows Malcolm's evolution like a butterfly from a caterpillar from violence to cultural and social awareness and holding our government accountable
82;I am saying I liked this film very much.
83;the acting overall was extremely good.
84;Denzel Washington here I think made a terrific performanceThe characters were interesting as was the story.
85;however as I do not know much about the characters, I cannot comment about the accuracy, but I suspect that for a movie, it is good.
86;the actual filming was very good.
87;A sweeping biopic of an admirable man, who, while his ideas were wrong, had the will and the determination to defend his ideas and to say them publicly.
88;A powerful film, with a sweeping force and excellent production values.
89;A compelling study of a complicated, angry man, and whether you agree with his ideas or you don't, the movie remains a riveting biopic that is one of the best movies of the 90's.
90;The reason the film works so well is mainly because of the performances and the assured direction by Lee.
91;Denzel Washington delivers a powerful performance that ranks among his best.
92;Also Angela Bassett is great in support.
93;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film a 9!
94;With tremendous performances by Denzel Washington (Malcolm X) and Angela Bassett (Betty Shabazz), Spike Lee delivers what is arguably his greatest movie which will stand the test of time.
95;lee does a masterful job in showing how this was truly a partnership between husband and wife, which .
96;lee takes cinema to a powerful and dramatic level that is rarely achieved.
97;This is an epic tale of spiritual growth, family and how jealousy and hatred can destroy so much in the instant it takes me to finish this sentence.
98;ray and was very pleased.
99;I saw the movie many years ago in the theatre, but this experience was just like viewing it for the first time.
100;The colors are vibrant and you get the feeling that you are part of the movie.
101;If you don't have this movie for your collection, I highly recommend that you order this one ASAP!!!!
102;This film was excellent based on the Autobiography Of Malcolm X by Alex Haley this film goes deep and is just a great movie about a great leader.
103;I credit this movie with introducing a generation to an important man in American history.
104;His evolution as a man stands as a lesson to us all.
105;This movie helps the audience appreciate the formulation of his views and how they changed over time.
106;What I admire most about him, which is depicted masterfully in this film, is his conviction and commitment to his beliefs, his quest for the truth and his willingness to admit the error of his ways when the facts took him in another direction.
107;Few have the courage to do the same, especially in the full view of the public.
108;A great movie about a great man.
109;Denzel owned it so well that I have a hard time separating the two!
110;I still come to the same conclusion: This film is, for me, by far the best and most important movie that has ever come out of Hollywood.
111;it is the story of one man's journey through life, but it is much more than that: It is the story of a family, a society, a nation .
112;As its foundation, the story of Malcolm X is as American as apple pie and the U. s. flag, but it crosses cultures and transcends national boundaries to speak to the strength of the human spirit as a whole.
113;The heart and soul that the filmmakers and financial backers gave to this film shine through after all this time like the sun.
114;To Spike and the """"Malcolm X"""" filmmaking family: Thank you for creating this film and presenting it to the world."""
115;And after that, if you've got a mind to, go out and make history by changing the world around you in a positive way.
116;That is the way to keep the spirit of Malcolm X alive forever.
117;But I got just what I ordered so I can't complain.
118;What can I say Malcolm X is a great movie love the acting and it plays well get it while you can
119;Denzel really got into the character of Malcolm X.
120;It brings back a lot of memories of those times of racial upheaval.
121;One of my favorites movies.
122;Denzel should have won the Oscar from this movie.
123;He made me believe he was Malcolm X
124;This is a beautifully film about a true black hero who would not back down or fold to the establishment.
125;He was committed to a cause and new that his life was in danger.
126;He wanted to educate black men.
127;The set and customs are absolutely fantastic.
128;This is one of the best movies ever made and deserves to be a classic which it is becoming.
129;This is, without a doubt the best movie I've seen in my entire lifetime, and if you haven't seen it, then it will become the best movie you will ever see.
130;I'm actually shocked by some of the 1 star reviews, especially the one calling it a dangerous movie.
131;For one, this movie keeps very loyal to the events and people talked about in his autobiography written by Alex Haley.
132;It accurately documents the rise and fall of Malcolm X and accurately displays the reasons for that rise and fall.
133;The story of the mans religious beliefs and strong heart was inspiring and a story that showed you can really achieve anything if you set your mind to it.
134;denzel Washington is possibly the best casting choice for a movie I've ever witnessed and this casting.
135;The start of this film is Malcolm (Denzel) delivering one of his infamous speeches which sends the electricity down your spine.
136;What's special is even the delivery is akin to that of Malcolm.
137;The spectacular life events of such a man are just un.
138;Making such high profile friends such as film star Ossie Davis and working with other, more integarationist activists like Martin Luther King, he managed to truly change the world and is probably one of the main reasons as to why America now has a black man in the White House.
139;looking at articles about Malcolm and his wife Betty X, I found out something truly heart wrenching.
140;She was just as strong an influence on the life and times of Malcolm, as the blight of the black American was.
141;I loved it soooo much I bought the tape and watched at least 20 times over and plan to watch it more than that.
142;The story is about the life of the great civil rights leader Malcolm X.
143;This was and still is Spike Lee's best film yet.
144;"And I don't care what a lot people, especially those at Motion Picture Academy thinks, Denzel Washington should have won the Best Actor award for this film and Spike Lee should have won Best screenpaly, best director, and best movie and every other ""best award"" that he should have as the director of this film."
145;Really in depth story of Malcolm x. Spike lee gives you the backstory on the historical figure without going to far from the book!
146;Denzel Washington gave a stellar performance in his role as Malcolm X.
147;He was superb in showing the transformation of a man from a thug to a man who cared about humanity.
148;is the best way to describe Malcolm X, Denzel Washinton's greatest work in cinema so far.
149;It tells the story of Malcolm X, the strong.
150;there are many other great performances in the film, and Spike Lee makes Malcolm X his best joint ever.
151;i thoroughly enjoyed watching Malcolm X, and it ranks as one of the best film of the '90s.
152;After studying the life of Malcolm X in a sociology of religion class, we watched this film to relax a bit.
153;The script seems fairly accurate to history, and the imagery helps bring the conflict, drive and sincerity of Malcolm X to life.
154;I'm grateful to Denzel and Spike for bringing me this joint.
155;I can almost recite it line for line and I am very familiar with the scenes and people in this film as well as the sound.
156;THAT is a perfect use of surround sound panning and it stayed precise!
157;It is so nice looking that when you watch it, you find it hard to believe that twenty years have passed!
158;layer disc that was perfect for what I liked .
159;I believe that the grain and slightly smoother look was a style choice kind of like JFK.
160;Once Malcolm becomes an official Nation of Islam member, the picture is as crisp and as clean as you expect it to be.
161;Denzel Washington is amazing in this movie about the life of Malcom X.
162;This is also a movie that showcases Spike Lee's movie making talents.
163;It's obvious that he researched down to the last detail, from the clothes to the cars of the period and the slag and words that were used at the time, to make a movie that is totally realistic and grabs you right from the beginning.
164;I like the movie a lot to begin with and Mr Washington is a great actor all his movies I've seen are amazing
165;His mannerisms, speech and passion is pure Malcolm.
166;And his likeness to Malcolm is uncanny.
167;a gripping film which is inspirational and confronts all Americans to the reality of racism during those turbulent times.
168;A special visit by none other than Nelson Mandella at the end was surprising and very fitting.
169;this is a classic drama which you will surely love as much as I did.
170;I was honestly scared to go, to tell the truth.
171;They are a very rare, well.
172;those of conviction rarely have great intellect or eloquence.
173;this is a man that I truly DO respect, a man who reinvented himself repeatedly after having invested himself completely, facing such tremendous loss and sorrow head.
174;He paid the ultimate price, and deserves our love and our respect.
175;spike Lee and Denzell Washington have done a tremendous job here in re.
176;The zoot suit,couched hair and the walk was so real.
177;Excellent movie about the evolution of a landmark African American civil rights leader of the early sixties, a must see!
178;He did such a super job in this movie (he made Malcolm almost likeable).
179;I really enjoyed this movie even though I don't know how entirely accurate it was fact wise, but,thanks to Denzel, it was a terrific movie.
180;one of Denzel Washigton best portrait as the charismatic Malcom X. if you like movies based on true story ,you wont be disappointed.
181;For years after, when you hear of an event from Malcolm X's life, the visuals of the film will be entertwined with the real visuals you may see.
182;denzel Washington's voice will be the voice you hear in your head when you read Malcolm's words.Yes.
183;denzel Washington turns in an amazing performance which was completely deserving of his Oscar nomination that year (if not the win he didn't receive).
184;"spike lee's greater work
185;the cover is pretty cool.
186;Its the greatest moive ever made and it is a great chance to see a great actor play as as great man.
187;This is a fabulous film.
188;The acting is excellent and the film tells a great story of the life of this man and his role in the civil rights movement.
189;Spike Lee did a fabulous job with this film and was a great character in the movie as well.
190;It is amazing how much Denzel Washington looked like Malcolm X in the film!
191;I highly recommend this film.
192;see' film is it's depiction of emotional, spiritual and logical growth of not just one man but a nation.
193;nOTCH and mezmerizing to say the least.
194;As X, Washington shows his growth from confused young one to racist and then finally to mature man of the people who understands what it really takes to lend a helping hand.
195;This film is perfectly exicuted on all fronts and shows the after effects of racism but also what we can do as people to help battle any further issues.
196;but as Malcolm learned, when putting aside the color of ones skin and seeing them for the person they are inside we can all make a difference and learn to live together as brothers and sisters.
197;Washington's portrayal of Malcolm X was, is and will always be stunning.
198;It speaks volumes about the most misunderstood aspects in American History.
199;It was great for me to show my kids a piece of our history during Black History Month as well.
200;Spike Lee's account of the life of Malcolm X is an excellent one, however, Spike could have made the film about an hour shorter than it was, primarily by editing the beginning and ending of the movie a little tighter.
201;Truly the most powerful performance I've ever seen in a biographical context.
202;This is a very good biography of Malcolm X that follows his Autobiography with some exceptions.
203;Malcolm X is an undeniably great film released in 1992 starring Denzel Washington (""""Training Day"""") and Angela Bassett (""""What's Love Got To Do With It"""")."""
204;"This powerful film directed by Spike Lee (""Do the Right Thing"") follows the life of the great and controversial civil rights leader Malcolm X."
205;The effects of racism in the US project themselves greatly, giving the film a more powerful theme.
206;Meanwhile, the passion and the struggle maintain their standing throughout, keeping audiences' attention through the entire three.
207;though all the actors give great performances, Washington and Bassett's state themselves the strongest.
208;nominated performance (Best Actor), portrays Malcolm X beautifully through his emotions and his charisma.
209;As in every film, he proves that he's one of few modern.
210;day actors who has pure talent.
211;Bassett portrays Malcolm X's, wife marvelously.
212;This underrated actress acts out her character's life hardtimes like she's actually living them.
213;Such acting strengths from them give this film the extra powerful theme that it deserves.
214;This is sure to please many audiences for years ahead.
215;Though this film presents only three hours of Malcolm X's life, this offers a great perception of his life and his beliefs.
216;This is a great movie.
217;Denzel Washington is a wonderful actor and the movie depicts Malcolm X as a person with many layers.
218;Knowledge is power to change the world and Malcolm X was a great teacher of knowledge.
219;This was an excellent movie.
220;It showed the moral, intellectual, and spiritual evolution of the man and the numerous external forces that attempted to block his development.
221;It is necessary to see the various experiences and stages of life to appreciate the man he became before his death.
222;Director Spike Lee carefully constructs the story of a fallible, intelligent, and driven man that disputes much of the media package presented to white America at the time.You definitely need a comfortable chair for this marathon of a film.
223;The cinematography is sweeping, with a sepia palette for Malcolm's pre.
224;islamic days, and conveys in gorgeous, riveting images the power of the man and his cause.
225;The special features, though worth watching, would be best left for another sitting, since the film demands introspection afterward.
226;Interestingly, Washington does such a fantastic job at channeling Malcolm that viewers will be amazed when watching actual footage.
227;see film for anyone with a serious interest in cinema, civil rights, and/or biopics.
228;Denzel Washington deftly captures the incendiary spirit of the civil rights leader who made many white Americans appreciate the proposed non.
229;one dramatic confrontation by the NOI to see justice done on behalf of a wrongfully treated African American leaves quite an impression on an NYC police officer(Peter Boyle).
230;another civil rights activist, Ossie Davis reiterates the beautifully profound and touching eulogy he initially delivered for Malcolm X back in 1965 for this film.
231;I was so happy to have this movie!
232;I can't tell you how many times I've watched it, thanks for making it available and in such great condition!
233;Denzel should have won for best actor
234;I agree, and when you consider that Denzel did win a Oscar for Training Day.
235;you have to wonder what denotes a great performance.
236;Spike Lee did an excellent job with this movie.
237;Denzel did a great job impersonating Malcolm X and sometimes i thought he was Malcolm himself.
238;I loved the book better but this puts the book into a three hour movie which gives viewers a good view into the life of Malcolm X.
239;spike Lee did an exquisite retelling of the Autobiography of Malcolm X!
240;Creatively conceived, visually stunning, insightful, heart.
241;wrenching and above all inspiring with an auspiscious cameo appearance by Nelson Mandela 2 years after his prison release and 2 years before his Presidential election.
242;I was delighted with this 2.
243;disc special edition and its price.
244;The art of filmmaking is amazing.
245;Here's another example of the genius (and skill) of Spike Lee.
246;As 25 years later it commands a heft retail price and an anniversary edition.
247;this one is beautifully colored but chronicles pivotal moments in his life.
248;The directors out takes also add valuable insight into not only the making of this masterpiece but also, Malcolm X's life.
249;spike of course takes the creative liberty to insert himself into the film, he's funny but not a real actor, as was customary for him at this time of his film making.
250;A must for All families with young hearty males but particularly young males who may be getting erronious labels because of their differences from what mainstream deams is acceptable in a young being.
251;should of won a Oscar one of the best performance ever given.
252;great movie one of my all time favorite
253;denzel Washington is a great actor.
254;very good movie long but very interested movie everone should wash this movie benzel at his best at this movie
255;This is probably one of the best coming of age black movies ever.
256;this movie has a stunning appearance by Denzel Washington.
257;I think it is the second best movie Spike Lee made.
258;(Note: THey need to make movies on MArtin Luther King Jr, Nelson Mendela, and Ghandi, all being wonderful black leaders.)
259;This is both a totally egaging biographical story of a great and complicated man's epic life AND a great film.
260;Spike Lee is in top form here.
261;For that matter, so is Washington, who is absolutely convincing as Malcolm X, as if he has channelled Malcolm's spirit.
262;In fact, Lee brings career.
263;best performances out of a lot of actors in this film.
264;I would definitely recommend this movie to others.
265;It was historically accurate and such a great story.
266;This is a must watch movie.
267;'Malcolm X' is a classic.
268;This is a sweeping adaptation of the book Malcolm X wrote with Alex Haley is one of the finest American bio pics ever, at once devastatingly tragic, angry and exhilarating.
269;A blistering, deeply moving portrait of a great, complex man and a vivid recreation of time and place.
270;it's Spike Lee's best film, beautiful to look at and powered by one of cinemas great performances.
271;Plus no Best Picture, Director or other actor nods and Ernest Dickerson's outstanding cinematography didn't get nominated either .
272;And it's a testament to Lee's fine script and direction that despite being 3+ hours long, 'Malcolm X' is never boring.
273;washington's brilliant acting is the heart of the movie, as he shows Malcolm driven by righteous anger, compassion and personal revelation.
274;It's a dynamic, multifaceted performance.
275;hindsight carping aside, this film deserves to be seen and looks fantastic on blu.
276;This ls a lengthy piece of work, but well worth watching, not only for Denzel Washington's remarkable central performance, but for the points it makes about the African.
277;american's status in American society.
278;In between he manages to preach a message of integrity and self.
279;determination that it as important today as it was when he first delivered it way back in the late 50s and early 60s.
280;Spike Lee's direction is controlled yet includes some remarkable moments .
281;A tremendous effort to tell a story that must be both told and remembered as a significant moment in the history of the African.
282;Excellent portrayal of the life of the Great Malcolm X. Denzel played an excellent role and the production by Spike Lee was perfect.
283;I and my friends had long since come to the conclusion that Spike Lee had made one of the most important films of the latter half of the 20th Century with this, his masterpiece of masterpieces, and that Denzel Washington had stepped into immortality with his eerily accurate portrayal.
284;but because of his immense knowledge of both the medium of film and the subject matter, we listened on, and found ourselves consistently challenged to understand the nature and the purpose of film, and the actual characteristics of the art form of cinema.
285;in the end, the students and myself began to question what I think is now still slowly becoming self evident: Spike Lee created another art form with this movie.
286;A general theme underpinning this representation of the life of El Hajj Malik El Shabazz, aka Malcolm X, is actually missing.
287;just one so profound, so elemental, so transcendentally human, spiritual and universal that it could only be expressed through the telling of the story.
288;He tells the story of Malcolm in such a way as to practically have the spirit of Malcolm telling you the story himself.
289;This is not just a magnificent film, worthy of five stars easily, and cheated ridiculously (albeit expectedly) during the Oscars.
290;This is a new art form, masquerading as a fantastic film.
291;this is a must see move.
292;He speaks to us from the grave even now.
293;We see him courting his beloved Betty and eventually fathering some four children.
294;We see him as inquisitive and stern.
295;assured with a desire to know everything.
296;Influential but, at times, easily influenced by circumstances in which he found himself.
297;It is that humanity that we celebrate today, regardless of our own skin color.
298;What a profound and dynamic man to portray!
299;This is one of my favorite movies .
300;A must see movie, very educational and historical!
301;i like classic's and im glad it came on time, it was at an awesome affordable price, yes i recommend it
302;My boyfriend loves this movie.
303;American history is something he is very interested in.
304;"Denzel Washington did deserve an Oscar for his performance in ""Training Day,"" but he should have won it earlier in his career."
305;Malcolm X truly showcases the man's greatest acting abilities.
306;Here, he portrays a legendary figure known throughout the world as Malcolm X.
307;"The man is one of the most important and most interesting African Americans of the United States, and Washington ""became"" him in the film."
308;Just listen to the speeches that he gives in the film.
309;Spike Lee's direction, the beautiful shots of Mecca, the period sets and costumes, the memorable performances of Angela Bassett and Delroy Lindo, and the tearjerker ending are just some of the reasons why this film should be watched.
310;It's a classic film that will never die.
311;One of the most brilliant films ever made.
312;Without question, the portrayal by Denzel Washington of Malcolm X belongs with these two classic efforts.
313;wonderful casting including Angela Bassett as his wife Betty, DelRoy Lindo and particularly Al Freeman Jr. as Elijah Muhammad.
314;This three hour look at the great Malcolm X was rich and poignant.
315;With this work, Lee brings you to laughter, to tears, to righteous indignation, and even to a silence as you process the depth of both Lee and X.
316;winning portrayal of Malcolm X.
317;The similarity in looks is almost eerie and Washington captures the essence of the strong leader who eventually saw unfairness in some of his thoughts and ideas.
318;Should be required viewing for any American history course covering this period in time.
319;It presents Malcolm in a fair, thorough, and interesting way.
320;Oner of the best performances I have seen Denzel Washington in.
321;Love the movie and the whole cast.
322;He is a good leader.
323;Denzel nailed his performance, and Spike remained faithful to the autobiography (which the movie is based).
324;That was an important reminder of how both Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and other leaders were all converging on a similar, anti.
325;Dolby Digital sound which really booms in selected points, and the movie is crisp and sharp.
326;The documentaries are an added plus.
327;this remains one of my favorite films.
328;"The film did a better job of selling ""X"" hats than cinema tickets upon release in 1992, partly because of its running time of about 3 1/2 hours."
329;The film relies on audio from Malcolm X's speeches for most of its narrative drive.
330;The devil is the white man, Malcolm X informs his audience.
331;One great scene shows Malcolm X toying with an overeager volunteer.
332;People don't realize, he had a great sense of humor, Lee said.
333;joining the director on the commentary are longtime collaborators Dickerson, editor Barry Alexander Brown and costume designer Ruth Carter.
334;One great thing is how Malcolm X thinking changed over the years.
335;denzel does a great job acting as usual.
336;Historically very accurate as far as I could tell.
337;I can watch this over and over because each time I see something I missed this is a great teaching tool.
338;This is a great movie.
339;Spike Lee's presentation of Malcolm X was very successful because the Malcolm's character, played by Denzel Washington, was very beleivable and the storyline was real.
340;first, Denzel Washington made the character realistic.
341;also, the story was excellent.
342;Every scene in the movie was well played out, and the most realistic part in the movie was in the end.
343;in conclusion, this movie was really realistic.
344;The actor and story were really well played.
345;I really enjoyed the film.
346;the end is REALLY REALLY good.
347;denzel Washington at his finest also great directing by Spike Lee Oscar Performance in the making superb job
348;I have two favorite movies of all time, and this is one of them.
349;He had the intelligence and the charisma to bring about the necessary change that the black community needs today starting with our men.
350;worth in his people, ultimately it cost him his life.
351;Spike Lee did an amazing job bringing to life his story, and Denzel Washington portrayed him such a way, that he became Malcom X without flaws.
352;I enjoyed the scenes of his younger life, but his time growing into the men he was when he was fatally shot is motivational.
353;he was a man of integrity especially with family life.
354;Those supposed followers reacted to certain aspects of their ideas I believe, just to announce that they were a part of a group with some power.
355;Gotta love brand new items for a great price.
356;A very good movie for anybody who appreciates history as I do.
357;"In spite of the scant attention that Hollywood has paid to Spike Lee's ""Malcolm X,"" there can be no denying that it was one of the decade's best films, right up there with ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""Saving Private Ryan."""
358;The cast is marvelous, the writing is superb, the music is intoxicating and the cinematography is downright unbelievable.
359;Without a doubt, this is Spike Lee's greatest film, and one for which he truly deserved more acclaim than he ever recieved.
360;If this is Lee's best film, its also Denzel Washington's.
361;"Sure, he made us wince in ""Training Day,"" but the challenge here is a much greater one."
362;Here, Denzel has to portray a well.
363;His job is to break through that stereotype, while still providing us with a realistic look at Malcolm the man.
364;in part, he's able to do that because of the writing.
365;splitting one could do over the minor details, the fact remains that the movie is highly faithful to Malcolm's life and work.
366;Perhaps the biggest revision is the character of Baines, wonderfully portrayed by Albert Hall.
367;This is clearly one of those instances where the writers do an excellent job of changing the facts in order to tell the truth.
368;His portrayal of West Indian Archie is as intimidating as it is engrossing.
369;In the meantime we'll just have to make do with what we've got.
370;But with a film as good as this one, there's little room for complaint.
371;"This is my favorite Spike Lee ""joint"" (personally, I hate that characterization, but Spike likes being Spike)."
372;Despite the fact that the film is 201 minutes long, and there was no intermission, it was absolutely riveting, and one of the better epics ever made.
373;Denzel Washington is utterly amazing as Malcolm X, bringing the fire, passion, intelligence, and dignity the man had.
374;He should have won the Oscar.
375;Spike's direction is really assured, and he doesn't use too many visual tricks here, because the original story is so good.
376;Spike is also good as Shorty, one of Malcolm's friends from his crime days.
377;Originally, I thought Lee had just added the character to give himself a role, but Shorty is mentioned in The Autobiography of Malcolm X.
378;The Mecca scenes are mesmerizing and visually stunning, but it almost didn't happen.
379;Regardless, this is a magnificent, balanced, and very thorough biopic of a fascinating man.
380;It's one of Spike's best films.
381;This movie is great and white people all around the world should be forced to see it in school.
382;Anybody who isn't a racist loves this movie.
383;What can I say but the man is amazing.
384;The way he personafies Malcom in this movie is incredible.
385;Denzel and Spike, you've outdone yourselves with this one!
386;This is a landmark in world film, and I recommend the two.
387;It distinguished Malcolm X from the Nation of Islam quite clearly and showed the amazing transformation from his beginnings as a poisoned hoodlum to a clear.
388;visually, this is brilliant, thanks to some beautiful cinematography by Ernest Dickerson, and very true.
389;the acting is solid throughout.
390;Denzel Washington obviously deserves the most credit for his seamless presentation of Malcolm X, both visually and verbally.
391;Kudos as well to Delroy Lindo, Angela Bassett, Al Freeman for some equally solid performances.
392;Minor points, but worth noting.
393;in contrast, however, the opening sequence, although very heavy as well (with Malcolm's strong rhetoric superimposed over a burning American flag and the Rodney King police beating in LA) worked well as a powerful point of departure for the controversy and image of Malcolm X and a brilliant image of the history of race relations in America.
394;The movie, at 3+ hours, feels as seamless and as significant as another memorable film, Gandhi.
395;, and I equated it with self.
396;fortunately, this is 2007, and the film holds up very well today, and I'm assuming that it will stand on its own 50 years from now equally well, if not moreso.
397;i got it just to watch such an incredible life of a martyr that changed the powerful nation, U. s. a.
398;You want a good movie full of black actors go see Ray.
399;This movie was basically made to glamorize this enigmatic and powerful figure in Spike Lee style.
400;Malcolm X cannot truthfully be said to be one of Spike Lee's best films, but it was an important step for him, perhaps the most important one of his career.
401;This biopic, and Spike's fifth full.
402;"up to his greatest classics, Do The Right Thing, Mo' Better Blues and Jungle Fever, the three films in which he created and developed his unique voice and made a name for himself as one of the most prominent independent filmmakers in the US
403;so Malcolm X is less a work of art and more a statement than Spike's previous films.
404;It's scope is immensely larger than anything he did before .
405;and is therefore, naturally, not as tight and focused as Do The Right Thing or Jungle Fever"
406;drama, the most important factor is for the director to care about the subject, and I'm yet to see a director who's more passionate about his subject than Mr. Lee.
407;malcolm X boasts a huge ensemble casts, with wonderful performances by Delroy Lindo, Angela Bassette, Al Freeman Jr. (in a harrowing performance as Muslim extremist Elijah Muhammad) and Spike Lee himself .
408;but the movie is still entirely Malcolm X's, and therefore Denzel Washington's.
409;Spike's prot g gave a lifetime performance in Mo' Better Blues two years earlier, but he surpassed it with his gut.
410;wrenching portrayal of Malcolm X, which earned him an Oscar nomination (unfortunately lost to Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman) and based him as one of the best actors of his generation.
411;although Malcolm X is not Spike Lee's best film, it's an important film that needed to be made, and it's a good thing that Spike was the one to do it.
412;More than it's an impressive, moving, beautiful movie .
413;Malcolm X's story is a story that must be heard, and this biopic is a film that, truly, every cultured and intelligent person needs to watch.
414;Tells a what is believed by many to be a clearer version of the truth.
415;Shows a truer vision of the man, his family, and his religion.
416;I read the Autobiography of Malcolm X and this movie captures his life perfectly.
417;Before I get into the movie, let me first and foremost say that Denzel Washington is a great actor who excels at nearly every role he takes on.
418;many can point to faults in people like Martin Luther King and George Washington Carver and other notable and truly honorable African Americans who deserve to be hailed in these truly inspired films and deserve the respect of being characterized by great actors such as Denzel Washington but this is because we are all human and none is perfect.
419;The story of Malcolm X (El Hajj Malik El Shabazz) was dramtically and fantastically brought to life by Denzel Washington and director Spike Lee.
420;His struggles and achievements are displayed in the most truthful of fashions.
421;One of Denzel's best acting performances of all time.
422;It is a must see movie!
423;This beautiful, normatic movie about a great man is a contribution to everyone's movie collection!
424;Yet I recall how X's passion, eloquence and honesty permeated every page.
425;"Spike Lee's ""X"" is a superb rendering of the bio."
426;Denzel Washington is the ideal man to carry off X's simmering rage, sense of justice and golden tongue.
427;the film gives us X's life .
428;minded and dedicated to the betterment of his people.
429;Whether as a shy youth getting his hair conked for the first time, or a small time hood bluffing his way into leadership, or as a charismatic preacher wrestling with betrayal and uncertainty, Washington's portrayal is pitch perfect and believable.
430;"His ""Chickens coming home to roost"" comment after JFK's death statement is well known
431;And calling Martin Luther King, Jr. an """"Uncle Tom"""" horribly misrepresents King's approach and his courage."""
432;while, at one time, X would have dismissed this white boy as unhelpful to his cause, I was impressed by the power of his words and the depth of his commitment.
433;Malcolm X is a work of love for a man who continually sought justice and the truth.
434;I would say that this is a a very good watch.
435;It is a long movie but it's worth it.
436;I love everything about this film.
437;It is well written, well directed and the performance by Denzel Washington is the best, in my opinion, of his career.
438;Our class deemed it so important and fundamental that we chose to go to the theater and see this movie and make a class trip out of it.
439;surely, this movie should have been nominated for an academy award for best picture and Denzel Washington should have won for best actor for this movie.
440;Regardless of the politics, the life and times of Malcolm Little as portrayed in Malcolm X is a true American story.
441;Malcolm X can truthfully be said to be one of Spike Lee's best films, which was an important step for him, perhaps the most important one of his career.
442;This biopic, and Spike's fifth full.
443;"up to his other hits, ""Do The Right Thing,"" ""Mo' Better Blues"" and ""Jungle Fever,' the three films in which he created and developed his unique voice and made a name for himself as one of the most prominent independent filmmakers in the US
444;This film was more of a statement than Spike's previous films.
445;Its scope is immensely larger than anything he did before .
446;Spike tackles """"Malcolm X"""" head on the very subjects he treated with symbolism and subtlety in this film, and therefore is a natural and important progression for him."""
447;In a biopic, the most important factor is for the director to care about the subject and Mr. Lee clearly proves that.
448;malcolm X boasts a huge ensemble casts, with wonderful performances by Delroy Lindo, Angela Bassette, Al Freeman Jr. (in a harrowing performance as Muslim extremist Elijah Muhammad) and Spike Lee himself .
449;but the movie is still entirely Malcolm X's, and therefore Denzel Washington's.
450;"wrenching portrayal of ""Malcolm X,"" which earned him an Oscar nomination and based him as one of the best actors of his generation."
451;malcolm X is an important film that is impressive, moving, and beautifully film.
452;This film is highly recommended to every culture.
453;This is an outstanding movie and a great Black History Item.
454;I will add it to my many meaningful collectable possessions.
455;He has probably one of the best speeches known to man.
456;"Denzel Washington I believe captured the essence of Malcolm X to the ""T""."
457;I rate this movie 5 stars.
458;Good price, fast shipping, very movie, much fun.
459;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
460;Not only is Malcom X a historical icon of mine, but Denzel play one of the best roles I've ever seen him act in.
461;Spike Lee is a great director and actor.
462;"El Haj Malik El Shabazz is a personal hero of mine
463;The Power Of Truth in the words one speaks is an awesome thing.
464;As I see it, what makes a man great is his capacity for positive change at any cost when the end goal is the welfare of ALL people.
465;won Oscar performance and get to know The Man.
466;Built around a commanding performance by Denzel Washington, Spike Lee's """"Malcolm X"""" is the writer."""
467;director's most ambitious, impassioned film to date, as it presents a turbulent and eventful life filled with self.
468;"notch cast, and Ernest Dickerson's fluid camerawork creating immediacy, ""Malcolm X"" bristles with energy and impact."
469;Great movie, but read the book also.
470;Lee should have stuck to the book, which is superior to the filmas an inspirational story, as pure entertainment,and as a message piece about race relations.
471;This was a great movie on Malcolm and Denzel played it just as Malcolm himself would have been there.
472;I really enjoyed this movie.
473;I would recommend it to my friends.
474;Denzel is one of my favorite actors.
475;This movie gave a great depiction on Malcolm X, an unsung hero of the Civil Rights movement.
476;This movie was a great adaptation of the book, yet I highly recommend reading the book first before watching the film, like most books which became film.
477;denzel Washington did an outstanding job playing the role of Malcolm X and should have won an Oscar for it.
478;You can tell he researched the character and met with family and friends of X and got personal with the depiction when filming.
479;i just saw it for the first time a few weeks ago and it's just as compelling, moving, vivid, and spot on as you can imagine.
480;it is magnificent the way it evokes chapters from Malcolm's life, from his criminal past to the streets of Harlem to the pyramids of Egypt.
481;It was beautifully filmed and brilliantly acted by Denzel Washington and it is a crime that he did not win an Oscar and Al Pacino did!
482;"Yes, Pacino is a compelling actor and talented but his acting in ""scent of a woman"" in no way approaches the amazing tour de force performance of a lifetime done by Mr. Washington here."
483;i honestly think it is one of the most spectacular performances of all time.
484;Spike Lee of course deserves the most accolades for being the visionary behind this movie, this project, this filming.
485;"You will not be bored
486;Ya, ya Denzel is a fine actor .
487;Watched the film and all I came away from the story .
488;Denzel Washington, in the best role of his career, conveys the eloquence and the passion of the man who captivated the hearts of hundreds of millions of people around the world.
489;the movie is based on the Autobiography of Malcolm X, and it sufficiently conveys the essential elements of the book in many ways.
490;To this day, Malcolm X is one of my all time favorite films.
491;not only is Malcolm X one of Washington's greatest performances, it is Spike Lee's greatest achievement so far and I own all of his films.
492;It is a daring, insightful, and moving experience.
493;Brother Malcolm's entire experience can be an inspiration to us all, regardless of our background.
494;I feel it is an important film for all to see.
495;I thought the movie was written and produced well.
496;Overall it was a good movie.
497;Spike Lee and Denzel Washington are an awesome pair
498;An excellent film by Spike Lee.
499;Denzel is outstanding as always.
500;I love Malcolm, I love Spike, I love Denzel.
501;Excellent masterpiece of acting!My family and I watched it twice in one day!
502;True to life performance by Denzel Washington and a glimpse into the life of an ever.
503;You can see the weaves of clothing material type of detail.
504;You can now see film grain, if you like that!The best addition was the 1972 documentary of the real Malcolm X.
505;You get to see extended views of certain sittuations and his murder along with public reaction on the scene!
506;That alone is the main reason I bought the new one.
507;This is one of the best work of director Spike Lee and the Denzel's amazing performance as Malcolm X.
508;It for sure deserved an Oscar for best picture/best actor which we all know was snubbed.
509;****(*)MALCOLM X is Spike Lee's masterwork film, his most generally accessible work, and a biopic and homage to the oft.
510;misunderstood Malcolm, here portrayed brilliantly by Denzel Washington.
511;It is little wonder that the light.
512;american community, calling for their liberation """"By any means necessary!"""""""
513;inclusive force in the world.
514;Spike Lee's film is both a record of and a memorial to, Malcolm X, who he was, and who he was becoming.
515;What a great performance by Denzel Washington.
516;Great directIing by Spike Lee.
517;she is such a classy actress!!!
518;however, this movie something just wasnt good.
519;the over all acting?Spike, you make some great movies, Summer of Sam is one of your best, Do the Right Thing.
520;The dude is bold man, I'll give him that and I applaude him.
521;give them a mic and let them talk and will put it on TV and let the world see it for the fools they are.
522;promoted her to the most powerful black women ever in the United States history, and that does not mean anything.
523;Movies are never good as the book, but its good to see a visual.
524;Malocom X was so great, but always thought he would come back to the N. o. i. give thanks to Malcom X our living Ancestor.
525;Black angst, extreme predjudice, and injustice reflected through the Rodney King beating and racial tension of the '90's, and it's nothing new, because Spike Lee takes it from there.
526;He tells us another story that happened almost 30 years prior.
527;The story of a man, a human, a hero, a sinner and a saint, Malcolm X. after seeing Bamboozled and reading the Autobiography of Malcolm X by Malcolm X with Alex Haley, I thought X would be worth a look, and it really was.
528;Spike Lee tells X's life story with amazing detail and realism.
529;The 3+ hours that follow are absolutely astounding.
530;But for his efforts to create a sense of unity and pride amoung his people, he will be a legend, a hero, a human, and a man in the greatest sense of the word.
531;denzel Washington unleashes a full calibre performance as X, and Angela Basset does an equally performance.
532;It's a shame that X failed to do as well as it did on screen at the Academy Awards, but it can be said that Spike Lee is definitely a man with a message.
533;american lifestyle and all the issues and pertenance to our contemporary society as Spike Lee.
534;Whether it's X , Do the Right Thing , or Bamboozled , Spike Lee captures on film the multi.
535;faceted feelings of the people he represents and the feelings of our nation.
536;Spike Lee is an essential component, and an outstanding filmmaker, in our culture today.
537;X is his masterpiece, and certainly a must.
538;Denzel Washington is one of the most influential black actors since Sidney Portier and Morgan Freeman in my own opinion.
539;I loved this movie, and I think nobody could have portrayed Malcolm X, a icon in African American history better than Denzel Washington.
540;Great movie, it educated me about a man that was rarely understood.
541;Denzel Washington really outdid himself with this movie.
542;I never knew much about Malcolm X so this made for interesting viewing.
543;From all appearances Denzel Washington did a fantastic job and I couldn't help but like the beginning of the movie with Spike Lee and Denzel in their zoot suits.
544;On the more serious side I did a good idea of who Malcolm X was and who he was becomming had he not been killed.
545;Great condition, great movie based on Alex Haley's biography written from research and interviews with Malcolm X. Spike's best work.
546;Furthermore, Denzel put his heart and soul into this role.
547;This is a film that you will enjoy forever.
548;"In my opinion, ""X"" is not only Spike Lee's greatest film to date, but also one of the greatest, and most sophisticated films Hollywood has ever seen."
549;"However, ""X"" is still a masterpiece, and although fictional at times, it's still one of the most heartfelt stories I've ever seen captured on film."
550;This is an amazing film.
551;I bought this for me, but I've watched it a few times and cried each time.
552;it starts with the beginning of the life Of Malcolm Little and how he saw the world being a black man.
553;It is both funny, sad and its cinematology is amazing.
554;I love this film and I'm touched every time I see it.
555;if anything, the performances of Denzel Washington and Angela Bassett are truly amazing.
556;The story itself will live within our history as one of the great leaders during the 60s.
557;Denzed as excellent in the role.
558;Will make A nice gift.
559;The story of Malcolm X is so dynamic and strong.
560;The performances of the actors, especially Denzel Washington, are well worth watching and deserving of the attention they received when the movie was shown in theaters.
561;I recommend this to anyone who enjoys first rate acting and a powerful stroy.
562;crafted movie by Spike Lee.
563;At the beginning of the movie, before Malcolm becomes politically aware, we see Malcolm and his friends, seemingly happy, emulating the larger societies dress and mannerisms.
564;Personally, I noticed a parallel between these fawning citizens of yesteryear, and contemporary, going along, happy whites of today .
565;He decides to join the Black Muslims.
566;Malcolm X's influence and legacy loom larger than ever.
567;One of keeping resistance alive.
568;In the movie, Lee focuses intensely on the scene where Malcolm and his friend (shorty?)
569;This movie is a great testimony to what truth was about!
570;Spike Lee did a tremendous job and lots of good work in getting this movie out.
571;Densel Washington deserved to win the Oscar as best actor, to be denied is an understatement.
572;Malcolm X was a man of truth and honesty.
573;Thank you Spike for your courage in bringing this to the light!
574;Densel and the rest of the actors and actresses who played major roles did so with character !!!
575;Spike Lee hit a home run in this film by selecting Denzel Washington to portray Malcolm X. Denzel delivers a stunning performance.
576;By far one of his best works.
577;This was a role he was born to play.
578;You can tell the energy was high on the set.
579;Anybody can portray someone in a film, but to really embody that person's character, to make it believable from start to finish takes someone whose skilled, trained and has a passion for what they do.
580;It's really an amazing film in which Mr. Freeman does an magnific interpretation.
581;It hit you in your stomach the way it present the black people in the american society and really think.
582;I saw the film when I was younger and loved it even then.
583;I think as an adult, I can appreciate the struggle and stress Malcolm X, and his family, must've gone through.
584;This movie is what got me into watching Denzel Washington because he totally owns the role.
585;For me, hearing people who were on the frontline of the Civil Rights movement speak about that time period is more poignant than reading it in a book.
586;His underlying mission, to lift the social oppression of the black race, was a commendable one, yes.
587;Well worth it a must see film.
588;great value for money will be revisiting your site when I want more.
589;I can have them delivered right to my door.
590;Interesting depiction of the life of Malcolm X.
591;Great movie, in great condition.
592;Good reenactment of the actual Audubon Ballroom assassination, based upon multiple sources.
593;Suggest this for everyone, one of spike lees best movies.
594;Thanks a pile for the extra stress and hassle!
595;The good: The acting by Denzel Washington is great.
596;He brings life to a man that most of us knew only as an angry man.
597;His smile and spirit (and almost dead on physical similarity to Malcolm) brought so much to humanize him.
598;"It was also nice to see Ernest Thomas aka Roger from the TV show ""What's Happening"" ('hey hey hey Raj!"")"
599;Since he wrote and delivered it at the actual funeral, it was a brilliant move to have it recreated by him for the film.
600;i am not a huge fan of Spike Lee's work, but this movie is epic and he did an amazing job of condensing a great book.
601;The life of Malcolm X was perfect for a movie.
602;It really is a life in 3 acts, and the third act has the rewards of his life before, but also the penalty of his previous life, which he can't escape.
603;She was pivotal in the book, and even one scene with her would have helped explain where he got the money to go to Mecca.
604;The 2 disk set has a great deal of extras that make it worth it.
605;but Lee was very smart to not include most of them.
606;He finally embraced a new self and Denzel played it so well.
607;Luckily it is one of the deleted scenes so enjoy it.
608;The music fights the moods so many times it really reminds you that you are watching a movie.
609;promotion, or something less laudable?Politics aside, this movie has high production values, the acting is good and the story is faithful.
610;the history of Malcolm X excites me!
611;As someone who likes all kinds of movies, I thought that this selection would be a worthwhile watch.
612;This movie was so well made, the sorty is true and demonstrates how the turn of events in this country actuall transpired.
613;He should be honored as well.
614;So with his Islamic conversion in prison, he set out to change the world as best as he sought, and, thanks to this film and the autobiography it was based on, we can now truly understand this struggle, inner and outer, for justice, liberty, and the pursuit of all to have happiness.
615;With Denzel Washington, traditionally a great actor, playing Malcolm X you knew the movie would at least be spearheaded with strength.
616;"i'd be lying if I did not say this is excellent, and then highly recommend it
617;The sound was awesome, I thought I was in a theatre.
618;Watch for the Nelson Mandela cameo!
619;An epic piece of amercan history performed incredibly well.
620;This is a must see.
621;incredible piece of work by Washington
622;Everything about this film is great.
623;All of that for a great price.
624;The life of this man and the story told is a must read and watch.
625;I was hoping for an exciting history lesson and I got a blah history lesson.
626;Malcolm X's autobiography may give you more details, but it's best to watch the movie first to get a better understanding and imagination.
627;Also, Denzel Washington plays an excellent role.
628;So to sum this up, X is truly an excellent choice.
629;I thought the beginning was pretty boring but the ending was good.
630;I remember reading the book because it was the first one I read with the art of discipline .
631;A man's story that is full of rich conversations about topics that will forever be relevant.
632;I bought it several years ago and was just thinking about looking at it again.
633;He was murdered at a very young age.
634;Denzel of course is wonderful as always.
635;Overall this movie is just great.
636;That is what Denzel shows you in the amazing life of this man.
637;But then to continue on and turn his life around to be something so positive, dynamic, to stand up face the evil and fight, only to have so many forces (inside and out) against him in the end shows the tremendous strength he had.
638;the story and his performance make this movie worth getting.
639;I love how the movie portrayed him from beginning to end!
640;1 Also Denzel did such a wonderful job of acting!!
641;Stellar performance by Denzel Washington.
642;His portrayal of Malcolm X was so convincing that I no longer saw Mr. Washington on screen, but instead, was transported back in time to witness Mr. X's journey.
643;That Spike Lee's (""""Malcolm X"""") and Mr. Washington were ignored for Oscars, speaks more about the Academy's fear of the subject matter (the incredible evolution/creation of Mr. X), than the performance of Mr. Washington and cast, under the direction of the inimitable Spike Lee."""
644;"I HIGHLY recommend ""Malcom X"" as a premier lesson in the civil rights movement in America."
645;Great movie Denzel is the man
646;A great feel and a positive revelation of historcal fact.
647;That's what he is good for.
648;A great movie that is well acted.
649;Spike Lee's vision for Malcolm X is incredible.
650;It also deals with the events that lead to his assassination.
651;denzel Washington's best performance was here and what does he win an award for?
652;Denzel role as Malcolm X is just as flawless as Will Smith's role of Muhammed Ali.
653;I still get goosebumps when I hear him speak and Ive seen a lot of Malcolm X's actual speeches.
654;Angela Bassett did a great job as his wife and the supporting actors and actresses were great too.
655;Kudos to Spike Lee for doing his best with the information he was given.
656;This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen.
657;I also highly recommend the book.
658;It's got WAY more information in it (obviously) and is an excellent read.
659;A good depiction of injustice in America.
660;denzel nailed the role, in every aspect!
661;this truely is one of Spike Lee's best films ever.
662;ray cancilation of this film.
663;For what Spike Lee is doing in this film i think he captured alot of it reasonably well, but it's got to be hard to make a film on one of the defining people in history.
664;Though Malcolm x is not the most lucid of films it still makes good viewing and Denzel Washington himself makes a very admiral and well acted performace.
665;This is probably one of the best films I've ever seen.
666;One of Denzel Washington's best role.
667;Kudos to Spike Lee for telling the story of Malcolm X.
668;The music was even awesome and accurate for the time periods.
669;'Malcolm X' depicts the best acting Denzel Washington has ever given in any movie.
670;american leader, Denzel almost perfectly embodies the early thuggish ways of Malcolm Little during his life of crime, and his born.
671;in general, the movie features an excellent cast of characters, such as Spike Lee (director) as shorty, Malcolm's partner in crime, Angela Basset (superb acting, by the way) as Betty Shabbaz, Malcolm's wife, and Al Freeman, who does a terrific job emulating the clipped, choppy speech of the real Elijah Muhammed.
672;For this one I can understand why Lee chose a more subtle approach.
673;but that aside, the movie is good enough to educate the audience about the life of this great revolutionary.
674;The plot is very well.
675;crafted, the acting is outstanding, and the short narrative with real takes of Malcolm X that ends with Nelson Mandela's reflection at a elementary school classroom is just terrific for a golden finale.
676;i recommend this movie to get you started on Malcolm X and his ideas, but after you see it, get the autobiography, his definite, ever.
677;lasting legacy as told by the man himself.
678;Denzel seaweed an Oscar for this hands down.
679;Washington gives a nuanced performance of this complicated character in American History.
680;There appears to be a debate by reviewers here that Spike Lee altered some of Malcolm's history to make a more entertaining movie.
681;"But, ""Malcolm X"" is totally engrossing from start to finish, with great acting from not only stars Washington and Bassett but from Albert Hall (""Baines""), Delro Lindo (""Archie"") and a remarkably realistic portrayal by Al Freeman, Jr. as the Honorable Elijah Mohammed."
682;veteran actors Lonette McKee, Peter Boyle, Christopher Plummer, and Ossie Davis round out the superb cast and add a touch of clout to the proceedings.
683;whether or not all of the story is true, the outstanding performances make up for any inaccuracies.
684;For someone who knew little about brother Malcolm, this movie was a fantastic educational tool.
685;This film is a great depiction of Malcolm's struggle, ideology and transformation.
686;Denzel Washington is phenomenal in this film.
687;One of his best performances.
688;Content was very good, just the story line moved, way, way too slow.
689;Nice overall movie with Denzel Washington playing the leading role.
690;Spike Lee's masterpiece, and visually one of the best films ever made.
691;Denzel Washington gives his best performance by far, and probably should have received that year's Academy Award for Best Actor.
692;Even denying it any other well deserved Academy Award nominations.
693;but to all true fans of cinema, do yourself a favor and view this film, if you haven't already.
694;"You will have to agree
695;Spike Lee's Malcolm X is a riveting masterpiece that's thrilling and emotionally moving and powerful.
696;Lee does a great job capturing Malcolm X as does Denzel Washington in his best performance ever.
697;This is a film that lets us know the character and his times.
698;I also loved the structure of the screenplay and film itself.
699;The first half is noirish with the gangster feel of Scarface, the second is a riveting historical document like Oliver Stone's JFK.
700;This is powerful filmmaking at it's best.
701;Malcolm X is brutal, powerful, hard.
702;hitting and full of great performances.
703;Not even Lee's recent Summer release, Summer Of Sam, reaches the level of power and intensity of Malcolm X.
704;This is one of the greatest films of the decade, a true gem.
705;It was a great shock for me to read Haley's autobio, but utterly fascinating and important to understand who we Americans are.
706;In my viewing, it is almost completely successful in evoking an extraordinary life.
707;You get the factual outline, and better yet the feeling for what it was like in X's times.
708;It is superlatively acted by Washington, who is one of the greatest actors alive.
709;I completely believed the portrait of how he grew into all of these roles with extraordinary ease as well as the mercurial energy of a genius.
710;These are deep questions, and Lee is content to provoke, in my viewing, leaving the audience vexed and interested in finding out more.
711;It is positively Brechtian in ambition, and here it truly works here.
712;And there is a raft of extraordinary personalities who appear and re.
713;X tells us all a lot about who we are as Americans and even as humans.
714;I believe he continues to fascinate because he died at a moment when he was ripe with potential to change.
715;This film made me weep, once again, as I did in my youth with the book.
716;All I'm going to say is Spike Lee and Denzel Washington, both should have received Oscars, for this excellent ode to Malcolm X !!!
717;Malcolm X is one of my favorite movies ever, a classic film that puts all of Spike's and Ernest's talents into one enjoyable, visually and stylistically spectacular piece.
718;i can't possibly imagine how this made it past discussion and into production.
719;yet you have two documentaries and other extras, also split between the discs.
720;she did a great job on production design, granted, but i want to hear from Spike and Ernest, the cinematographer.
721;i want to hear about the scenes themselves, about the classic """"Spike"""" touch and technique, and after years of waiting for a commentary track, classic scenes don't have Spike's comments, but some completely irrelevant comments about an antique store that had this lamp, it was a charming store, they had lots of nice items, blah blah blah."""
722;He most certainly should have won for Malcolm X. I remember back in 1993.
723;I turn on one channel, and it's Malcolm X.
724;I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wanted free acting lessons.
725;This is a masterful work of art that takes you through the history of Malcolm Little to Malcolm X to Malik El Hajj Shabazz.
726;I rate this movie on the same list of importance as visiting Washington D. c. and New York City.
727;If you think being an American is more than just a birth right you will definitely appreciate this movie.
728;This is a very entertaining, but complex movie on a very complex man.
729;A stunning performance by Denzel Washington (Oscar nominated) carries this film literally into cinematic excellence.
730;He stars as the titled character, the controversial Black Nationalist Leader who is easily one of the most interesting people who lived during the 20th Century.
731;Spike Lee's uncompromising direction focuses on X's life.
732;A good supporting cast helps, but this is Washington's show from the very start.
733;Malcolm X was a great man who influenced millions through his teachings and words.
734;This film does him justice, beautifully acted with a witty and intelligent screenplay .
735;this is a must see for anyone.
736;The ending is most tender with Nelson Mandela telling the next generation about Mr. x and how he taught our society to be more humane towards others.
737;When the credits started to roll I felt all warm and teary eyed, evidence for a perfect film.
738;Denzel Washington proves again he is a Oscar deserving recipient and I love his acting.
739;Malcolm X was so wonderfully made and I am proud I bought this for my son!
740;Denzel Washington gives the performance of his career in this film.
741;washington's work in/as Malcolm X was unquestionably the best by any actor in 1992, truly capturing the man's ascension from street hustler/convict to revolutionary/national figure.
742;Angela Bassett is wonderful as Malcolm's wife Betty, Delroy Lindo is sharp as West Indian Archie, and Albert Hall is excellent as Brother Baines.
743;measured direction, but that should not dissuade you from seeing this amazing motion picture.
744;Malcom lived a very interesting life filled with many transformations.
745;This movie touches on the civil rights movement and life for African Americans at the time, and also has a spiritual aspect regarding the muslim faith.
746;The special features were also excellent.
747;This is Spike Lee's best film ever!
748;Excellent movie for student who may be out of touch about Malcolm X. Spike Lee did a wonderful job directing, Denzel is awesome with the mannerisms.
749;Its the best movie I have ever watched.
750;very clear and easy to shift through.
751;Good movie loved it, its a great story mainly true facts of his life and absolutely great actors, i dont want to spoil it for you.
752;The best one can hope for is that a point of view stops short of propaganda, that it doesn't fall prey to a white.
753;Lee's movie and Washington's performance are both so powerful that one can easily forgive many of the broad strokes, enjoy the film, and evaluate the sum effect.
754;which at least has the potential to bring about a fuller understanding of race and religion than the daily political.
755;malcolm comes across as a practicing idealist, a man of the highest integrity and most rigorous discipline capable of realizing his vision of a brotherhood whose awareness of its lineage will bring forth the very best moral intentions and practices.
756;"Although the problematic divisions of Islam into Sunni (Malcolm's alignment) and Shia, along with the distinctions between Islam and the Nation of Islam, are merely suggested and the break with Elijah Muhammad due to the latter's ""woman problem"" is glossed over, in the end the movie's importance rises above attention to such details."
757;Malcolm is a hero, a role model and, most importantly, the inspiration for a meaningful, potentially constructive, mythic legacy that, like similar narratives centered on Lincoln or JFK, cannot outsize its human source beyond the point of credibility.
758;fledged member of a human race empowered to pursue and achieve excellence regardless of (not because of) color.
759;at its best, cinema has the potential to be a reflective screen, a mirror of our social and private lives, exposing the best and worst in us all.
760;make for a potent mix, a powerful chemistry that, we can only hope, will continue to exert its clarifying powers on the diversely colored stage that is being set for the coming year's test of a nation's ability to practice the democracy that it professes to prize above all else.
761;Malcolm X is one of the best films I've ever seen.
762;The overall portrayal of Malcolm X from class president to street hustler to convict to political leader is as good as it gets.
763;And director Spike Lee delivers massively here!
764;There are many things to learn here: the charisma, the fiery rhetoric and the sacrifices.
765;The documentaries on the disc are an added bonus as well.
766;It is long and there are some parts that move by really slowly, but taken as a whole this is truly one of the best films ever made.
767;Denzel is perfect as Malcolm.
768;this movie is moving and dramatic.
769;no matter your views about Malcolm, Spike Lee, or the Civil Rights movement this movie is entertaining and stands on its own merit.
770;Spike Lee did his best with this film.
771;With an excellent choice of Denzel and Angela as Betty, this film truly is an inspiration to all Black and non.
772;It truly captivates the beauty of our religion and how one man truly believed in hard work and dedication.
773;The ending was truly the most touching of all and still brings a tear to my eye even today.
774;May the real Malcolm rest in peace.
775;A must see film that's powerful enough to change the way you look at life.
776;Elijah Muhammad is greatest teacher black men and women will have in America.
777;As a white man,I have tons of respect for the late great Martin Luther King Jr. he was all about peace and unity.
778;which is a beautiful and wonderful thing.
779;"however, as I watched it
780;after watching the movie, I took the time to review the documentary on the second disc and it was very powerful.
781;i first read the Autobiography well over 23 years ago, and after reading it"
782;"The book had a powerful impact on my psyche and when I went to see the movie in 1992
783;spike Lee should have won for best director that year"
784;this is very important history and must be given the respect it deserves by our culture.
785;This is the amazing Spike Lee film looking at the life of Malcolm X.
786;You see Denzel Washington in probably his best ever role, breathing life into this complex historical figure.
787;It really makes you understand what things shaped Malcolms ideas and vision as he progressed through his life.
788;The music is superb, the acting is great and the direction is an unique and captivating as ever.
789;Not only is this great to watch and will keep you engrossed throughout, but you will come away learning something about this influential man.
790;But what happened to him later on in his life and the change that he underwent is one of the most influential and inspiring true stories that have ever touched my heart.
791;spike Lee, the director of Do The Right Thing, brings Malcolm X to the big screen with Denzel Washington portraying the late Black leader.
792;"Malcolm educated himself in jail and turned out to be what many never expected
793;The movie successfully reveals the inner conflicts between Malcolm and the Nation, and the result of Malcolm breaking away to become an independant activist.
794;The film also does Malcolm's story justice by showing his pilgrimage to Mecca .
795;one of the best movies I have seen.
796;Incredible acting, incredible story line!
797;What more can I say about a very powerful moment, movement and the human spirit!
798;In that movie, I was very impressed with his ability to play a very confident, smart, and super.
799;Now, watching """"Malcom X"""", a movie made by Spike Lee in 1992, I realize that he has always been that kind of actor."""
800;His portrayal of Malcolm is full of power and subtlety.
801;I've never had that much interest in Spike Lee's films, but I have to say that this one is very well done, and very interesting, no matter where you fall on the political spectrum.
802;A classic motion picture with a superb performance by Denzel.
803;Malcolm was portrayed by Denzel in a fine performace, befitting his superb acting ability.
804;Spike was funny in his part, as a Director, he was right on.
805;Delroy and the rest were great.
806;Surely the most expected and critically looked at film Spike has made, he did an excellent job.
807;It remains a movie, in the Spike Lee tradition of great music, interesting and characteristic shots, like seeing him sort of sliding towards the camera, a common device in Spike Lee movies.
808;While I thought Denzel wouldn't look like Malcolm X, who was light skinned and lanky, he does such an amazing job.
809;It stays pretty true to Malcolm's autobiography, and the ending scene is rather positive and uplifting.
810;Along with Gandhi, this is one of the best film biographies ever made, a true epic, and an achievement for Spike Lee.
811;He deftly blends his artistic side with the true and sober representation of an American icon.
812;It was great and it showed how Malcolm X evolved as a person.
813;Arguably the best representation of Malcolm X ever conceived on film.
814;This is one of the all time great performances and portrayals of a historical figure by a young Denzel Washington.
815;Denzel is simply immense in this film, and this surely must rank amongst his greatest ever performances.
816;He excellently portrays the life of a truly remarkable and fascinating figure in Malcolm X, going into real detail and giving the viewer a real insight into his life and time period.
817;I would recommend this as essential viewing to anyone interested in Malcolm X, and particularly any students studying this area of Civil Rights, it really will provide a great overview of this period and plenty of detail around the key moments in the life of Malcolm X.
818;I remember while I was growing up the turmoil that was created during this time.
819;The movie showed the true honor and life of Brother Malcolm and how his life was and how he influence his people bye speaking the truth and what needed to be said.
820;His words are as powerful today as they were back then.
821;His words are what's happening right now, he was ahead of his time.
822;great documentary and history of an amazing man that is often misinterpreted.
823;Denzel Washington and Spike Lee are a great combination of true talent!
824;Denzel Washington was born to play this role.
825;It's wonderful that Spike Lee was able to take his audience through the entire history of Malcolm X. Not just his life as an adult.
826;But we are able to see how this wonderful man became to be.
827;Great job with the clothes, the zoot suits like my papa used to wear.
828;and this movie is undeniably a superb example of a film biopic.
829;he also discoverd that their are plenty of white followers of the Muslim faith.
830;it teaches peace and love.
831;which is a complete twisting of the words of the Q'ran as a representation of what the Islamic faith is about.
832;please read, educate yourself before you speak on the matter at hand.
833;This movie is hands down the very best of Spike Lee's career!
834;Spike Lee outdoes himself in this movie.
835;he should have gotten an Oscar for Best Director.
836;This movie will keep you glued to the screen for the three hours that it runs, and will bring tears to your eyes.
837;It was really the film he was born to make.
838;It's my sincere hope that Warner Brothers will revisit this film and come out with a deluxe 2.
839;MALCOLM X is a powerful and compelling biography, chronicling the struggle, the rise and the tragic fall of a great American individual.
840;Denzel Washington SHOULD have received his Oscar for this performance.
841;"A blond, blue eyed ""devil"" offers X a drink from a tin cup."
842;take the log out of your own eye!
843;please keep in mind that I haven't read X's own words regarding gender discrimination, but this little moment is a bit seminal in films like this.
844;as a package this movie is very good, and as one of the white devils, I appreciated the anger of black (men) better.
845;This is a good movie it's deep!
846;What a complex and rapid change of a life Malcolm X went through in the few short years he was on this earth.
847;spike Lee did a wonderful job as well as all the talented actors involved.
848;He was a visionary and Spike Lee's movie portrays him as such.
849;Denzel Washington's performance is absolutely riveting.
850;The screenplay is 98% accurate, and I should say all of the supporting actors are just fantastic.
851;A Must See For All People Around The World!
852;This is the movie that Denzel Washington as well as Spike Lee should have won an Oscar for.
853;The acting is superb, and the story line provided much information into the life of Malcolm X. I really like this movie, and have since the first time that I saw it.
854;MALCOLM X was an interesting movie.
855;ernest Dickerson did a wonderful job with the cinematography.
856;Denzel's acting was superb along with Delroy Lindo and many others in the film.
857;The sets were outstanding for the location scenes.
858;Spike Lee's malcolm X in my opinion is one of the great fil Bio pictures of the 90's.
859;It's easily Spike Lee's most ambitious effort to date.
860;The film scope is expansive.
861;The films look is very rich, with vibrant colors and sets.
862;The cinematography is excellent as usual from Ernest Dickerson who goes into his usual bag of visual tricks.
863;Malcolm X has a look that's all of it's own.
864;It has the look and polish of a big studio movie.
865;There's even a dance number that's a sight to see.
866;Stand Out performances go out to all of the cast.
867;His role should have at least earned a nomination for best supporting actor.
868;Delro Lindo also stands out as the wicked number runner West Indian Archie.
869;And Albert Hall is splendid as the ficitious Baines.
870;But the real star of this movie is Denzel Washington.
871;His performance simply towers above the rest of the cast.
872;arguably Spike lee's best film, although Do the right thing is very close.
873;It's a wonderful sprawling oddesey of the life of one of the most influential Black leaders of the 20th century.
874;Demonstrated by Denzel Washinton's snub at the Oscars ( Best Actor ) , for his piercing , haunting , and unforgettable portrayal of Malcom X.
875;This film is very poignant, as it tells the story of one of the most influencial , charismatic , and feared revolutionaries of his generation.
876;Spike Lee, does a phenominal job at capturing the essence of this story , with affection , direction , conviction and sensativity.
877;As a matter of fact , this is by far the best feature film , the director has put out.
878;With riveting supporting performances by such notable actors as Delroy Lindo , Theresa Randle , Angela Bassett , Albert Hall , Al Freenman Jr. , Lonette Mckee ,Kate Vernon, Christopher Plummer , Giancarlo Esposito , and a host of other cameos.
879;"Although largely snubbed by the Oscars , "" Malcom X "" was nominated for 2 ( Best Actor: Denzel Washington , and Best Costume Designer : Ruth E. Carter )."
880;One good footnote is that Denzel Washington did win Best Actor by the Golden Globes , aka : Oscar's little brother.
881;The cinematography is fabulous and the score is memorable.
882;"This is truly a film that all the crew and cast loved passionately and it shows in the final product. """
883;"Malcom X "" is a very poignant and important film."
884;It illustrates the necessity to understand one another and the need to somehow cooperate with each other on a human level.
885;Hard to believe that a single film can capture these elements.
886;Needless to say , I highly recommend this film.
887;After I got done reading the book, I decided to watch the movie again, seeing as I had come into the middle of the movie on the TV.
888;I recommend reading the book, so you get a real portrait of who Malcolm X was.
889;He was so surprise that I remember.
890;He just enjoying watching it.
891;This is a great educational movie, to help everybody learn about Malcolm X. Denzel Washington gives an outstanding performance, no one else could have done it so well.
892;Malcolm X is the best bio.
893;It is very important that there are more filmmakers and media artists for marginalized people's voices.
894;To all justice seeking artists, be systematic, and persistent, and do as much as you can, always.
895;As S. lee has shown, doing true, good work and earning a comfortable income is very doable.
896;I watched this film years ago, and felt moved by it.
897;Malcolm X the film stands comparison with the two films I just mentioned because Malcolm X is an important person in the history of civil rights in America and perhaps the whole world.
898;malcolm, in his life, went from being a tough thug and former jailbird, into a civil rights leader for his people, with an extremely sharp brain and some of the most uncompromising and electrifying speeches you've ever heard.
899;A really good film, notwithstanding its length, and one that I could watch again and again.
900;Denzel Washington is absolutely convincing as Malcolm X and is as usual enormously charismatic in the role.
901;It is a sad end of an amazing life.
902;"As the film, and Malcolm's life progresses, there is the feeling that Malcolm is shedding his skin
903;I feel this made a strong impact on him and he began to see all humanity, not just black people, as worthy of concern, love and consideration.
904;in the racial climate of America in those times, it could be easy to understand that someone black would despise white people and the mainstream white culture of America"
905;He was a great man.
906;mr Lee is one of the few film.
907;for anyone who knows nothing about the history of the black people around the world, and why black peoplef Africa and Carribeans seem to be behind in every aspect of this life, this movie is an excellent choice
908;Great additional features and booklet to accompany movie.
909;This was a great movie from beginning to end.
910;Mr. Washington's portrayal of the slain civil rights leader was riveting.
911;This is a must see!
912;I enjoyed this movie a great deal, and I think Denzel Washington performed excellently.
913;"The end result was a much wiser and humble yet strong individual, who believed in good people of all ""races""."
914;I believe he was very good at heart, and his life was a journey that taught him many things.
915;THAT is the best movie I have seen of him to date!
916;"This movie is obviously about the life of Malcolm X. Denzyl Washington's performance is comparable to Fox's in ""Ray"" so what happened?"
917;"Denzel deserves an honorary ""oops we forgot to honor you in 2000"" Oscar."
918;Watch this movie, read the book, and enlighten yourself.
919;deznal wsshingtoni ois in one fof ghies best role s ever here!
920;speike's direceting is amdong hsi tops!
921;Is always good, but he brings Malcolm X to life in here and shows a man in transition just perfectly.
922;Denzel Washington is super in the title role.
923;Very good film, well made movie has a lot of interesting parts a must see movie taking you back to the roaring twenties.
924;So this film really adds as a reference to back it up.
925;This film paints the most balanced picture of malcolm ever produced.
926;This movie is one of the best films ever made, and it is a tribute that is balanced, fair, and truthful!
927;I absolutely love this movie always have since the very first time i saw it.
928;The likeness that Denzel Washington shares with Minister Malcolm is astonishir, the way he speaks, acts and looks is just uncanny to the original man himself.
929;i won't tell you what happens next as that will spoil the film for you and i want you to see it because it is amazing and nothing like.
930;3 hours long but every minute will keep you captivated and your eyes glued to the screen.
931;The best movie Denzel has ever made!
932;spike Lee ur a genius.
933;I love this movie and I am just overjoyed to have it in my very own collection.
934;Everytime I watch one of Mr. Lee's movies, I learn something else about the subject of his movies.
935;Spike Lee should've won best director for this film, and Denzel should've won an oscar, but Denzel lost the oscar to Al Pacino for Pacino's performance in Scent of A Woman (which, I believe, is inferior to Denzel's portrayal of Malcolm X, but that's just one man's opinion, innit?)
936;Denzel Washington was masterful in his performance of the much maligned leader of the Nation of Islam.
937;Washington's performance demonstrates why he should be considered one of the greatest actors of our time.
938;The scenes at the barbershop and the dance are humorous and light and well performed.
939;Washington's delivery of Malcolm's various speeches are also well done.
940;Malcolm X was a brilliant orator, and Washington was able to capture that skill.
941;The film is a must see.
