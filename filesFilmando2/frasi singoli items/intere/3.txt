I:8676;1;I was glued to the movie and Chaplin's Tramp was always getting into trouble.
I:8676;2;I just got this in the mail today and immediately popped it in when I got home from work.
I:8676;3;The picture is so vivid it's as if I'm in the room with the cast.
I:8676;4;you know, you just have to say his name and you start to smile.
I:8676;5;The funniest parts are when he's in the feeding chair, and when he keeps tightening the bolts on everything, including that lady's buttons.
I:8676;6;I think the funniest stuff is the 1st half.
I:8676;7;I can't help but have a big smile on my face whenever I watch Charlie Chaplin.
I:8676;8;Maybe it's because whenever I see him I think back to when I was younger, and spent several hours in front of the tv watching his movies, or maybe it's simply because, the man was funny!
I:8676;9;This movie has what I feel is one of the most heartfelt endings in movie history.
I:8676;10;As we see the tramp and his then wife, the very beautiful Paulette Goddard walk into the sunset.
I:8676;11;But what they do have is their love for each other.
I:8676;12;It's a very emotional scene.
I:8676;13;He could create some of the most funniest things ever filmmed and at the very same time could think of the most heartfelt.
I:8676;14;We have Charlie actually getting caught inside one of the machines!
I:8676;15;This is a movie filmlovers of all ages should watch.
I:8676;16;A wonderful movie by one of the funiest people that ever lived.
I:8676;17;A real treasure for everyone to see.
I:8676;18;I love the guy and the use of the camera was so great for the time period.
I:8676;19;The skating scene is great and the plot's good as well.
I:8676;20;The hearding dissolve at the beginning is a great touch.
I:8676;21;The only down side is that many people today might not conect as well to the humor, but the character is definately something to remember, and it's worth watching.
I:8676;22;It must be sme form of genius, what he did.
I:8676;23;I know he probably put so much of himself into it, because as slapstick as it may be, there is honesty in what he did and the messages he tried to get across using a good medium.
I:8676;24;Chaplin is timeless in this comedic tour de force.
I:8676;25;It is a classic in comedy.
I:8676;26;From start to finish CHAPLIN delivers in grandy.
I:8676;27;ray is a remarkable transfer considering this film is close to 75 years old and a very worthy addition to any collection.
I:8676;28;This masterpiece left me wanting more.
I:8676;29;The most interesting thing about rewatching this classic is to see how Chaplin invents cinematic technique as he goes.
I:8676;30;expressionist production design are both striking.
I:8676;31;Chaplin's Modern Times provides what you would expect from a Chaplin film: slapstick humor, a serious theme, fantastic acting.
I:8676;32;this is a film that I can watch over and over again.
I:8676;33;It's that each aspect of the filmmaking pulls together to form something greater than each individual part.
I:8676;34;The story ranges from big topics concerning the Great Depression and dehumanization, while successfully balancing that with the small love story between the tramp and the gamin.
I:8676;35;this is rightly hailed as the last great silent movie, albeit one made several years after sound has become the norm.
I:8676;36;Chaplin is making a silent film using sound technology, meaning he has the option to take the best of the both worlds.
I:8676;37;His next film, THE GREAT DICTATOR, wouldn't quite get this mixture right, but it's a success here.
I:8676;38;They analyze the film's jokes, its metaphors and its themes.
I:8676;39;Also included in the documentary is some footage of Chaplin meeting Gandhi.
I:8676;40;Great rendition of a great song.
I:8676;41;It's a fascinating look at what film means to people who have never actually watched one before.
I:8676;42;But the villagers laugh at the right places and seem genuinely enthused.
I:8676;43;The documentary is well worth watching and will fascinate anyone with an interest in the societal ramifications of film.
I:8676;44;the picture restoration on the main feature is also fabulous.
I:8676;45;It's a great film, but it's also extremely representative of his body of work.
I:8676;46;It has comedy, it has pathos, it features the tramp, it has a message.
I:8676;47;And it's also one of the most influential movies that Chaplin ever made.
I:8676;48;And if you haven't seen it before, then this is absolutely worth a gander.
I:8676;49;You'll be surprised at just how modern and fresh this classic movie is.
I:8676;50;I like the silent Chaplin best, without his political preaching.
I:8676;51;I use it in acting class.
I:8676;52;You know it's a good movie when 13 year olds yell at you not to turn it off when the bell rings.
I:8676;53;It's a classic, with footage that's been used and reused for years.
I:8676;54;Of note it is kind of cool to Chaplin doing coke jokes .
I:8676;55;Silent film comedies never seem so edgy .
I:8676;56;ray edition of Chaplin's masterpiece on modern life contains:* New, restored high.
I:8676;57;I rate this movie 5 stars or 9 over 10.
I:8676;58;This movie is timeless, a masterpiece, a pleasure to watch and watch over and over again.
I:8676;59;The theme of the movie is how technology alienates the human being.
I:8676;60;"There we watch one of the funniest scenes of the movie, the lunch with some ""white powder""."
I:8676;61;In the times of the Great Depression, Chaplin portraits the unemployed and the hunger.
I:8676;62;A classic, a masterpiece, a timeless movie!P.
I:8676;63;This is truly Chaplin's masterpiece.
I:8676;64;One of the best films he ever made.
I:8676;65;Charles Chaplin's amazing subtle approach to the modern society is so vibrarant through this film.
I:8676;66;The eternal song Smile so tragic but so optimistic, there is still road ahead, you have to just put up a smile in the face of worries, and move on.
I:8676;67;After approximately 60 years this film is still quite applicable to our present day society.
I:8676;68;Man turning into machine and we swimming amongst the sprockets of the mechanical age, is a sight worth seeing.
I:8676;69;Truly a masterpiece, in every right.
I:8676;70;Chaplins Modern Times is stupendous social satire of the living and working conditions during the depression.
I:8676;71;Godard is brilliant in the role as the woman living by her wits and she sure is very attractive and quite beautifull and one does not have to think twice why Chaplin picked her to star in this movie.
I:8676;72;Chaplin is an amazing actor and he plays the role with dedication, fortitude and he must be ranked as one of the best actors of the begining of the 20th century.
I:8676;73;This is a movie that was considered one of the top 100 comedies of all time and I totally agree.
I:8676;74;It is the least sentimental of his great pictures, and might be his most popular because of it.
I:8676;75;he's happy in jail and taken care of: it's better to be there than in the world of no work or where he's brutally victimized.
I:8676;76;"He befriends an innocent ""gamin"" (Paulette Goddard) living by her wits, and the scenes with her are lovely (minus the pathos)."
I:8676;77;a movie screen, a radio, a phonograph.
I:8676;78;For once at the end he gets the girl.
I:8676;79;She loved it and has watched it several times.
I:8676;80;Funny th think of her watching this classic which I so enjoyed as a youngster!
I:8676;81;My favorite scene is that with the feeding machine.
I:8676;82;Fantastic Criterion Collection copy of this great work, which uses the amazing comic vernacular that Chaplin himself invented to convey his view of the human consequences of early 20th century industrial capitalism.
I:8676;83;It's still a must see, and this is a perfect, clear copy with great audio.
I:8676;84;"If you've never seen a Chaplin film, ""Modern Times"" is the one to sample first: it's more accessible than Charlie's silent movies and the plot, theme, acting, music and ambiance of the movie is superb in every way."
I:8676;85;He was a genius of the highest realm.
I:8676;86;"He wrote, directed, composed the music and starred in ""Modern Times"" and his inimitable charisma surrounds the entire production."
I:8676;87;The way Charlie moves his body is always a joy to behold.
I:8676;88;Indeed, Chaplin's gifts as a compsoser are in full force here, the music is beautiful throughout.
I:8676;89;Modern Times has it all: laughter, tears, pathos, as well as a social message 50 years ahead of its time.
I:8676;90;Charlie points this out in comedic ways, as well as more serious undertones.
I:8676;91;paulette Goddard, Charlie's third wife (we think, their marriage certificate has never surfaced), is excellent in the supporting role of the homeless gamin.
I:8676;92;up anda simple hairdo, she is stunningly gorgeous.
I:8676;93;Charlie always had good taste in judging women's beauty and Paulette is no exception!
I:8676;94;Modern Times is a timeless cinematic masterpiece.
I:8676;95;Cherish your initial viewing, you'll never forget its impact as you laugh, cry and reflect on the genius of Charles Chaplin.
I:8676;96;This two disc edition has good bonus features.
I:8676;97;Charlie Chaplin's cinematic comment on the machine age and arguably his greatest film, MODERN TIMES has been given the boost to blu.
I:8676;98;If you're already familiar with this wonderful, bona.
I:8676;99;There's also a wealth of extras, idncluding the entire short subject by Chaplin and Alistair Cooke filmed during a yachting excursion.
I:8676;100;For such an enduring, enjoyable film the upgrade is definitely worth it.
I:8676;101;This movie in my opinion was Charlie's best work ever.
I:8676;102;It's really close to The Great Dictator though.
I:8676;103;He's the greatest actor that ever lived!!!!
I:8676;104;this movie just packs so much into its 89 or so minutes and it all flows beautifully from one frame to the next!
I:8676;105;now I have this wonderful new 2 disc Mk2 version from the Chaplin Collection box to pull out every Christmas Holiday season.
I:8676;106;tell you everything about this wonderful one of a kind film!
I:8676;107;Modern Times is probably one of the most recognized silent films of all time.
I:8676;108;Funny thing is, its not really a silent film.
I:8676;109;This was Chaplin's way of poking fun at talking pictures.
I:8676;110;The music, written by Chaplin is very poignant.
I:8676;111;It is a genuine classic that deserves its position in film history.
I:8676;112;Chaplin fans all around the world know that Modern Times is one of his best films.
I:8676;113;ray is an incredible experience.
I:8676;114;Sharp, crystal clear, as if one could reach in and actually touch the characters on the screen.
I:8676;115;I have always loved classic films and it never occured to me how great B&W movies could look in high definition.
I:8676;116;It is so sharp that even the film grain can be seen.
I:8676;117;Back during the early 80's I owned a Super 8 film print of Modern Times that had cost me over $200.00.
I:8676;118;If you love Chaplin or classic films in general, get this.
I:8676;119;"Charlie Chaplin's outstanding 1936 flick ""Modern Times"" clearly demonstrates that he was one of the most significant creators of physical comedy."
I:8676;120;Not only did he write, produce and direct the movie, he composed the musical score!
I:8676;121;Modern Times is a testimony to Chaplin's comedic genius.
I:8676;122;In the final screen appearance of his celebrated character The Little Tramp, he appears as a factory worker in a huge and modern industrial complex.
I:8676;123;He hilariously goes running wild through the factory until he is captured and sent off to convalesce.
I:8676;124;in this satire of modern mechanized society, Chaplin's comic wit shines brightly.
I:8676;125;Modern Times is an absolute laugh riot amid Chaplin's commentary on society.
I:8676;126;The scenes in the dilapidated house and as a watchman in a department store were some of the funniest I've ever experienced.
I:8676;127;This movie is the work of a genius.
I:8676;128;"It is so clever and original and unique: the ""events"" of the ""story,"" his facial expressions and his physical genius, not to mention that he is credited with writing the music!"
I:8676;129;"I especially love the ""feeding machine"" at the factory
I:8676;130;This film is more than a gem.
I:8676;131;I enjoy watching it over and over.
I:8676;132;If that's is the version you prefer, than you'll be happy.
I:8676;133;The restoration is lovely, and most of the edited parts are available as bonus features.
I:8676;134;But for those who want to see this film as it was original released, it's best to look elsewhere.
I:8676;135;Still, her hair and lipstick always look perfect.
I:8676;136;A wonderful movie to watch.
I:8676;137;Very funny from start to finish.
I:8676;138;One of the all time classic comedians.
I:8676;139;This was an interesting surprise.
I:8676;140;I watched this with my son and my mom and we all were laughing and enjoying the movie.
I:8676;141;Good for all to watch.
I:8676;142;amazon insists that i write a review when all i wanted was to give this movie 5 stars and move on.
I:8676;143;It helps that Modern Times is one of Chaplin's best films, period, running a close second behind City Lights (I hope that's next on the re.
I:8676;144;the film itself is the most briskly paced of Chaplin's feature.
I:8676;145;And his writing is sharp, unhindered by the sermonizing which permeates his last works.
I:8676;146;The dilemma facing our Little Tramp this time is something all of us can relate to: For the first time, we see him thinking ahead, wanting to have a future, to form a family, and working towards that end.
I:8676;147;comedy skills are at their peak: Witness the extended takes of the rollerskate scene, and the factory assembly line.
I:8676;148;Even if the 18fps (sometimes 16fps) film speed made everything look faster than it really was, it's still impressive physical co. ordination requiring flawless execution, since Chaplin rarely edits using coverage.
I:8676;149;in Modern Times we see one of the first truly well.
I:8676;150;The radiant Paulette Goddard was Chaplin's best leading lady, her high spirits and lively presence being a much better foil for Chaplin than the starry.
I:8676;151;some of the best in the Chaplin canon.
I:8676;152;pierre Dardenne, the French filmmakers behind the film Rosetta, and though their film.
I:8676;153;It's a wonderful presentation of a comedy classic.
I:8676;154;It is one of my favorite movies from the childhood.
I:8676;155;Worth a watch, not as good city lights, but still classic Chaplin humor.
I:8676;156;We watched with with our grand kids and my 8 year old grand daugther is now a Chaplin fan.
I:8676;157;This is one of Chaplin's most funniiest and heartwarming films.
I:8676;158;A great movie with a lot of great supplements.
I:8676;159;classic comedy, laughs and a real great story.
I:8676;160;I have the Criterion Blu Ray version of Modern Times now and it's the best copy yet of this film.
I:8676;161;I didn't even realize what a genius he was with special effects.
I:8676;162;This was one of my introductions to Charlie Chaplin's brilliant body of work in film.
I:8676;163;While other kids were out watching Luke Perry and Tom Cruise, I had a growing love for early film.
I:8676;164;Modern Times is a timeless, laugh.
I:8676;165;"loud, very intelligent and insightful little picture about modern life, the plight of the assembly line worker and the ""pick them up by their bootstraps"" mentality that has been attributed to the growth."
I:8676;166;This time, he is working in an assembly line, working the nine.
I:8676;167;It is the era of the Great Depression, and a new job is not easy to come by.
I:8676;168;This definitely works to its advantage.
I:8676;169;a great example of Chaplin's genius.
I:8676;170;subtle critique of the change in America's popular attitude during his professional heyday, decrying the abundance of automation in local factories while the great depression still raged on city streets.
I:8676;171;Despite the weighty deeper implications, it remains a genuinely charming set of skits and Chaplin is at his emotive, expressive best from curtain to curtain.
I:8676;172;The film gets bonus points for throwing its star into so many unique, visually spectacular situations, including what's probably his signature scene inside the belly of a giant, mechanical assembly line.
I:8676;173;I remembered it from a biography I saw of Chaplin on television.
I:8676;174;The more I watch this cute little movie, the funnier it becomes.
I:8676;175;The picture is good enough for a 30's film.
I:8676;176;The music is very good, and confirms my opinion of Chaplin as a very multifaceted man of many talents.
I:8676;177;This is classic Chaplain showcasing his brilliance as actor, director, dancer and creative spirit!
I:8676;178;the second disc has an introduction by biographer David Robinson documentary, in which Robinson explains that Chaplin was very concerned with and educated about economics and the role of industry in causing the Great Depression.
I:8676;179;the documentary features a commentary by two French directors.
I:8676;180;overall, an excellent work, and highly recommended.
I:8676;181;Oh yeah, the film's good too.
I:8676;182;An incredible accomplishment since these are Silent Classics.
I:8676;183;in summary this silent (digitally restored picture, sound effects musical soundtrack) classic Modern Times is a great picture to watch.
I:8676;184;He believed the true motion picture was to be a visual experience not a talkie.
I:8676;185;To challenge our ability to see the humor and drama unfold through his eyes.
I:8676;186;one classic scene where Charlie is swimming through the large gears machine sprockets like taffy shows us the great imagination genius of Charles Chaplin.
I:8676;187;Indeed his greatest leading lady.
I:8676;188;this is the movie to experience the genius of Charles Chaplin.
I:8676;189;Arguably the first great superstar of film, Charlie Chaplin was the man known simply as the Tramp in his silent movies.
I:8676;190;For this reason Modern Times seems like the perfect bridge between the early silent era and the age of talkies starting in the late 1920s.
I:8676;191;Because of Chaplin's popularity he was able to make one last great silent picture.
I:8676;192;In this film the iconic Tramp character finds himself up against modern technology and the Great Depression.
I:8676;193;With that being said, this is a great film which exhibits everything that made Chaplin famous.
I:8676;194;He still has that walk, that mustache, and new hilarious antics to accompany everything else.
I:8676;195;Yet again there is a love story, between a tramp and a beautiful homeless girl played by Paulette Goddard (Only in the movies).
I:8676;196;Despite all the hardships they face this resilient pair amazingly still have hope.
I:8676;197;Fittingly, in the end the two lovebirds walk off into the background, seeming to bring the end of the Chaplin golden era, but also leaving us with a feeling of hope for the future.
I:8676;198;bought as a gift for a friend, he is into film and blu.
I:8676;199;making (yet subtle) ending, but this is a very close second.
I:8676;200;paced look at modern times that will make anybody who has ever had a fast.
I:8676;201;paced job wince and laugh.
I:8676;202;Chaplin's masterful use of the mostly stationary camera and relaxed editing is on full display here.
I:8676;203;"skating, the prison dinner table, the famous assembly line scenes, the reminder to ""smile,"" it's all here."
I:8676;204;ray]and I am still impressed at just how good they are at restoring classic old films to as close to perfection that they can.
I:8676;205;Kino did an excellent job with the Fritz Lang film that this film borrows greatly from i. e. the Complete Metropolis [Blu.
I:8676;206;The special features are also very good as is usual for a Criterion release.
I:8676;207;There are just too many excellent sequences to mention and so you'll have to watch it yourself to truly appreciate the genius of Chaplin.
I:8676;208;"Chaplin himself preferred ""The Gold Rush"" as his personal favourite film which is also a classic and while ""City Lights"" is also very good ""Modern Times"" for me is still overall his best silent film."
I:8676;209;"Like Lang before him in ""Metropolis"" Chaplin shows how technology and innovation can only be helpful to humanity if compassion and common sense is used."
I:8676;210;this is one of the best movies of all time and like any classic, I find myself enjoying it more every time I watch it.
I:8676;211;The answer, the antidote: watch Charlie Chaplin.
I:8676;212;I've seen this film before and each time it just reaches into my heart and tickles me till I'm alive with laughter.
I:8676;213;Modern Times is such a masterpiece and it came at a critical junction in film history.
I:8676;214;He rose to the occasion by creating one of the most famous dramatic and comedic masterpieces in all of cinematic history.
I:8676;215;"while speaking per se is not what you notice in ""Modern Times"", the few speaking parts are funny and used with great effect."
I:8676;216;What we do notice is Chaplin's unmistakable and incredible physical humor.
I:8676;217;These are hilarious and typical Chaplin moves.
I:8676;218;In one scene he just goes over the top in what must be one of the most sensational moments.
I:8676;219;He puts on roller skates and suddenly starts skating around like he has been doing this all his life, showing remarkable ability.
I:8676;220;Here is a really great film, written, directed and scored by Charlie Chaplin.
I:8676;221;Another one of Chaplin's best with another killer ending.
I:8676;222;Paulette Goddard does an excellent job as his leading lady.
I:8676;223;My dad laughed so hard he could hardly catch his breath on father's day when watching the slapstick comic genius of Charlie Chaplan in Modern Times.
I:8676;224;The script, music and acting that he wrote, composed and performed make him I believe a man born ahead of his time.
I:8676;225;the scene in jail with the smuggled nose powder by another inmate that was stashed in the salt unknown to the Little Tramp, and his reaction after salting and eating his food, was hilarious.
I:8676;226;I don't condone drugs, but the way Chaplan finds humor in things that happen to us out of the blue is great.
I:8676;227;It definitely should be part of your collection, I believe it is one of the top 20 movies ever but on film.
I:8676;228;This is a classic film!
I:8676;229;Chaplin's Modern Times leaves us awed with various noteworthy marks.
I:8676;230;Not only the background music but also occasional sound effects bring out the brilliance of the director.
I:8676;231;Those laughing spots fairly spread in the entire film proves it.
I:8676;232;time silent Little Tramp finally open his mouth to sing!
I:8676;233;for the first and final time, unless you count The Great Dictator (1940), the following film and another masterpiece of Chaplin.
I:8676;234;What he performed in this Titina sequence, singing in the stateless language (still obvious it is conjured up with a few languages such as French or Italian) and storytelling by his brilliant pantomime.
I:8676;235;The audience in the film reacts the same way as we do: get a nice.
I:8676;236;With its theme song Smile , composed by Chaplin, the performance of Charlie the Little Tramp is definitely one of the highlights of this film.
I:8676;237;Modern times was a smart comedy in the previous years to WW2.
I:8676;238;And the machine who feeds you without waste of time for your employers is a classic.
I:8676;239;in the middle of the film will appear a deep inspiration.
I:8676;240;he is a guy with good feelings.
I:8676;241;the sequences in the dinner hall with the chicken that never comes to the impatient client is a masterpiece.
I:8676;242;Literally it's a funny coreography dance in the purest sense of the word.
I:8676;243;"smile 
I:8676;244;a remarkable film and one of the landmark pictures of this timeless genius.
I:8676;245;This film will never dissapoint you , at least in the next three hundred years.
I:8676;246;"It was his first trip back in America in years and he said to the audience, ""you dear people"", with tears in his eyes."
I:8676;247;He did do films that were speaking roles.
I:8676;248;He was so brilliant in A King In New York (1957).
I:8676;249;Modern Times (1936) is Chaplin at his best.
I:8676;250;The first 18 minutes with Chaplin as a factory worker is hilarious.
I:8676;251;I was shocked to see the muscled.
I:8676;252;he finds a dropped flag from a truck and he picks it up.
I:8676;253;He continued in films with speaking roles until 1967.
I:8676;254;This is one of Chaplin's best movies!
I:8676;255;The scene when Charlie is working at an assembly line is one of the most classic and most hilarious of all time.
I:8676;256;It's a must see, not only for the humor, but also for its message of social criticism.
I:8676;257;It's a clear criticism of Chaplin's time and the Great Depression era in the U. s. However, with global competition at its highest in our day, the movie also has a message for us.
I:8676;258;In either case, it is still a great comedy for young and old.
I:8676;259;Chaplin achieves that rare mix of brutal satire and sweet, affectionate filmmaking that helps this film maintain its relevance almost eighty years later.
I:8676;260;when TCM airs it, their version is nearly this good.
I:8676;261;Chaplin was truly a genius.
I:8676;262;His body movements and eyes speak so eloquently.
I:8676;263;I watched and enjoyed this movie as a child and had longed to see it in the years since.
I:8676;264;I found it to be even more humorous.
I:8676;265;I was delighted over it's ability to hold up over all this time.
I:8676;266;This movie is still amazingly funny and pertinent to modern day versions of David vs Goliath.
I:8676;267;He proves he can still get ahead and find happiness, while doing it his way.
I:8676;268;Modern Times (1936) is quite possibly the defining picture of Charlie Chaplin's career.
I:8676;269;The funniest stuff is in the factory as Chaplin lets loose with his trademark physical humor.
I:8676;270;I think this is Chaplin's best and most well.
I:8676;271;crafted films and if he is only remembered for one film, it should be this one.
I:8676;272;this title works as initial exposure to Chaplin for kids, with Goddard an adorable foil.
I:8676;273;Chaplins's genius on display as he rails against a system that is still slowly driving us all insane.
I:8676;274;Chaplin was ahead of his time, ironically, with a silent movie.
I:8676;275;He has a romance, gets some anti.
I:8676;276;A classic keeper for all times.
I:8676;277;"Absorbing the genuis of Charlie Chaplain is always a good investment of ""recreational"" time."
I:8676;278;This film offers no exception as a display of his incredible aptitude for thought provoking entertainment.
I:8676;279;Let's see, Charlie goes insane in a factory, look for the 'tweaks' he gives the large bosomed woman!
I:8676;280;Charlie Chaplin is without a doubt one of the finest filmmakers of the 20th century.
I:8676;281;He manages to pack so much complexity into such a deceptively simple story.
I:8676;282;"This is his last silent film before moving to ""talkies"" like the Great Dictator and it stands the test of time as a brilliant monument to humanity and optimism."
I:8676;283;Made in the era of talkies, Modern Times is a silent film, but includes just the right sound effects, and the famous Chaplin sings scene.
I:8676;284;Just watch it and see!
I:8676;285;This is one of my favorite films of all time!
I:8676;286;Kudos to Criterion for releasing this film and a great job to the restoration team.
I:8676;287;This movie will make you laugh out loud if you like physical comedy, and I do.
I:8676;288;At the same time, the film displays gentle love and care that provides a base for hope and dreams for those who are struggling for a happier and better life.
I:8676;289;Overall, Modern Times presents an excellent cinematic opportunity that gives both laughs and tears, which will leave some pondering the structure of the society.
I:8676;290;He teachs us a lot through his movies.
I:8676;291;The genius of Charlie is very evident in this wonderful movie.
I:8676;292;Charlie's Little Tramp is one of the most well drawn characters to ever come out of Hollywood.
I:8676;293;Charlie communicates well, how life really is, by pulling laughter out of bad luck and tragedy.
I:8676;294;It is first and foremost a comedy of amazing proportions.
I:8676;295;The funniest scene in the whole movie is the scene with the automatic lunch feeder.
I:8676;296;Next to The Gold Rush, Modern Times is probably Chaplin's best film.
I:8676;297;There are many, many memorable moments (among others, the famous scenes in which Chaplin goes through the gears of a machine) along with social commentary, something that is present in most of Chaplin's feature films.
I:8676;298;there is no better way to see Modern Times than on this two.
I:8676;299;The picture is crystal clear and razor sharp, and Chaplin's interesting and memorable musical score sounds great.
I:8676;300;the many extra features are located on the second disc.
I:8676;301;David Robinson, one of Chaplin's biographers, gives a good introduction.
I:8676;302;For the more serious Chaplin fans, there is a Chaplin Today documentary that goes in.
I:8676;303;pierre Dardenne (they did Rosetta, which won the Golden Palm at Cannes).
I:8676;304;There are a bunch of archival films, including Behind.
I:8676;305;, and, best of all, a Cuban film called For the First Time.
I:8676;306;Extras are rounded out with an enormous photo gallery, a few trailers, a poster gallery, and some scenes from other Chaplin films.
I:8676;307;Modern Times balances humor and pathos extremely well.
I:8676;308;way television monitors are installed in company bathrooms to keep employees moving and even the advent of talking pictures.
I:8676;309;In fact, I laughed quite a bit.
I:8676;310;This is, perhaps, Chaplin's funniest film and easily one of his very best.
I:8676;311;way televised monitoring system that his words can be heard.
I:8676;312;Modern Times is one of the best films I've ever seen.
I:8676;313;Charles Chaplin is at his best here and Paulette Goddard makes a wonderful leading actress.
I:8676;314;"I highly recommend this film for Chaplin fans
I:8676;315;This is a tremendous and beautiful movie.
I:8676;316;Since I'm not a Chaplin scholar, I won't describe or analyze it in full here, but suffice it to say this is an excellent movie and worth a look for anyone with an interest in economics, sociology, film, history, film history, Charlie Chaplin, etc. as for the edition itself, it's great, as Criterion Collection usually is.
I:8676;317;Modern Times is one of Charlie Chaplin's most memorable films.
I:8676;318;"Like all Chaplin films, ""Modern Times"" features numerous slapstick routines that are just as funny today as they were 80 years ago when this film was made."
I:8676;319;"Chaplin also composed the score to this movie, which includes ""Smile,"" one of Chaplin's most famous songs."
I:8676;320;This is a truly fantastic film that people will continue to enjoy for many years to come.
I:8676;321;This is the best film of Chaplin's that I watch many times over.
I:8676;322;The transfer is indeed unbelievably beautiful.
I:8676;323;Chaplin was a fantastic actor, comedian, composer, writer, and sometimes director, but I question some of his choices as film editor.
I:8676;324;This movie is simply one of the best of all time!
I:8676;325;Charlie Chaplin is a genius and if you see only one of his works this is the one.
I:8676;326;This was bought as a gift and the recipient was delighted!!!!
I:8676;327;This was the first Chaplin film I'd ever seen, and I was astounded by Chaplin's genius.
I:8676;328;His physicality was simply amazing.
I:8676;329;The famous scene when he sings in nonsense French is hilarious.
I:8676;330;Watching Modern Times does show how great Chaplin was at directing movies.
I:8676;331;It was interesting to see how he was able to convey the lifelesness of factory work and of modern society.
I:8676;332;This collection comes highly recommended.
I:8676;333;This is Charlie's best film!
I:8676;334;It is as true as ever and will leave your sides hurting for the whole day!
I:8676;335;A comedy about a factory worker who goes insane by the machines of the modern age!
I:8676;336;Had to watch this film for a history class.
I:8676;337;Chaplin does a fantastic job evoking humor and sympathy in the viewer while prodding the viewer to question the direction technology is taking society in.
I:8676;338;I saw this because it was chosen as one of the best of the century.
I:8676;339;Charlie Chaplin had a sort of magic with film and it shows in this one.
I:8676;340;First of all, the seller was very good and prompt.
I:8676;341;(I hope they do a lot of business!)
I:8676;342;As for the movie, very good.
I:8676;343;It shows the talent that Chaplin was.
I:8676;344;He was brilliant at making people laugh and cry.
I:8676;345;:product is very good(just as the seller said it would be!)
I:8676;346;and the movie is very good and very touching.
I:8676;347;Chaplin's immortal comedy about industrial society is as funny and hard.
I:8676;348;except for sound added in primarily to create a feeling of abuse.
I:8676;349;Instead of trying to get the girl, the girl gets along quite fine staying with him.
I:8676;350;"But what's most interesting, especially to Chaplin fans, is the finally where the Tramp ""sings."""
I:8676;351;"Finally the image of sound as oppression is discarded, the Tramp learns to be vocal, everyone loves him and thinks he's brilliant, yet still the world oppresses and he's forced to walk away with the promise that ""We'll manage."
I:8676;352;it is quite a powerful film (even while it splits your sides with laughter) and definitely one of his best.
I:8676;353;I understood that he parlayed his popularity into power and control over his work and that he made a huge contribution to American cinema.
I:8676;354;But I found Chaplin the performer, cloying and sentimental.
I:8676;355;"after watching ""Modern Times"" however, I understand why he is one of the great performing talents of the 20th century."
I:8676;356;The film is nearly silent and mostly a series of comedic set.
I:8676;357;pieces, each one a virtuoso display of Chaplin's boundless talent.
I:8676;358;"what struck me most in watching Chaplin was both his ability to come up with a routine
I:8676;359;"It is also a great testament to his acting that we never question Chaplin's ""little tramp"" an average, slightly ludicrous character who has amazing talent that deeply undercuts his character's supposed mediocrity."
I:8676;360;"my other surprise was how effective and nuanced the satire is in ""Modern Times."""
I:8676;361;Chaplin's little tramp is the perfect protagonist in a story about the perils of automation and technology.
I:8676;362;The little tramp is never defeated and always optimistic.
I:8676;363;This is a movie for all time and well displayed in this offering.
I:8676;364;i laughed about 4 times during the whole thing.
I:8676;365;This film is pure luditism.
I:8676;366;The great moral stance that this movie takes is that it glorifies bunglers and thieves.
I:8676;367;Chaplin's stunt work (I assume that was actually him) in the blindfolded rollerskating scene is mindbogglingly good.
I:8676;368;If you really want to see art on the screen, watch Chaplin's work.
I:8676;369;Chaplin's genius is on full display throughout.
I:8676;370;"An amazing crossroads moment as Chaplin maintains the silent film aesthetic with some concessions to the new ""talkies"" technology."
I:8676;371;the story succeeds as a social satire, as a love story and as a comedy all in one.
I:8676;372;"Chaplin's costar and ""wife"" Paulette Goddard is stunning and he frames every scene she is in with a close up that shows her face to be one that the camera loves."
I:8676;373;if you have any hesitation about watching older silent movies this is a great place to start because despite the age of this film there is enough here to delight any movie lover.
I:8676;374;One of the earliest stops on this new journey of mine was Modern Times, Charlie Chaplin's 1936 extravaganza that makes it into critics' 100.
I:8676;375;best lists with almost alarming regularity.
I:8676;376;"i know there's a great deal of social commentary to be found here
I:8676;377;What I found important, and enjoyable, about the film is that it's a wonderfully.
I:8676;378;choreographed piece, a remnant of the silent era in the age of talkies (there is very little actual speech in the film), and an excellent showcase for Chaplin's talent for physical comedy.
I:8676;379;Add to this the eye.
I:8676;380;perfect sense of pace, and an array of sets that rivals most of what gets turned out seventy years later, and you have the recipe for a truly classic film.
I:8676;381;It is also Chaplin's last truly great film, though THE GREAT DICTATOR and even MONSEIUR VERDOUX had some marvelous moments.
I:8676;382;unlike Keaton, who too often tended to have actresses far beneath his skills, Chaplin loved to have strong actresses with him.
I:8676;383;That, and a host of somewhat risqu jokes early in the film, make one surprised that it managed to pass muster with the Hays office.
I:8676;384;The picture is sharp and crisp, with absolutely no hint of a worn print.
I:8676;385;The way we see it here is as good as it has ever looked.
I:8676;386;"The musical score, which was composed by Chaplin, is marvelous, culminating in his most famous composition the exquisite ""Smile."
I:8676;387;The camera cuts to behind them, and we see them together walking down the road.
I:8676;388;It is an absolutely perfect image for the last seconds the Little Tramp will ever appear onscreen.
I:8676;389;"Modern Times offered a variety of minor attractions: it featured Chaplin's wife, Paulette Goddard
I:8676;390;Charlie the rebel, Charlie the poet, Charlie the invincibly human, had been turned into a machine.
I:8676;391;A couple years back, in 7th grade, during History class, everyone in the classroom was introduced to one of entertainment's greatest stars, Charlie Chaplin.
I:8676;392;Why haven't I seen this earlier?Honestly, I don't think there's a lot that I can say that hasn't been said already, but I still highly recommend this movie.
I:8676;393;Not only is it extremely wonderful and hilarious, but it is also one of the most interesting movies I've ever seen, too.
I:8676;394;and this film definitely reflects a future beyond the initial year this film was made.
I:8676;395;anyway, I saw this film on cable TV about 30 years ago, and so I do remember that I thought that it was way ahead of it's time for being filmed in 1936.
I:8676;396;ray, I knew that I would want to have it now.Yes, with Paulette Goddard with her greasy hair, and dirty black dress, and her beautiful eyes and her lovely smile, I cherish this movie all the more.
I:8676;397;This is definitely a keeper on Blu.
I:8676;398;Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times is one of my favourite films and arguably one of the best films ever made.
I:8676;399;The movie remains incredibly funny while also managing to be a significant artistic achievement in cinema design and social commentary.
I:8676;400;The film does include music, sound effects, and the occasional voice, including a segment at the end where we get to hear the tramp sing a short nonsense song.
I:8676;401;It presents perhaps the most famous silent film character in a film that purports to be silent, yet it features futuristic factory machinery (reminiscent of Metropolis) and large close.
I:8676;402;ray release from Criterion continues their standard of releasing historically important films with significant audio/video remastering and a variety of enticing special features.
I:8676;403;ray version contained noticeably better detail and superior contrast.
I:8676;404;as far as special features go, the Criterion version really shines.
I:8676;405;It adds a new and informative commentary by Chaplin biographer, David Robinson.
I:8676;406;There is also a very interesting new featurette about the visual and sound effects used in the film.
I:8676;407;It includes some fascinating explanations of effect shots presented in the film, although their very detailed explanation of a glass matte shot used in the roller skating scene does not seem to take into account that the camera moves during the sequence.
I:8676;408;also included is a very interesting interview with music arranger, David Raskin, taken from an old Laserdisc version of the film.
I:8676;409;I was glad to be able to see this again.
I:8676;410;criterion also includes a nice 36.
I:8676;411;overall, I think this is a nice package.
I:8676;412;The film presentation is more detailed than it has ever been in any previous release, although some additional digital manipulation of the picture and cleanup of artefacts would be welcomed by my eyes.
I:8676;413;All vintage box office information I have seen related to the film indicate that it was one of the top five grossing films of the year.
I:8676;414;Then or now, it is a fun ride.
I:8676;415;Modern Times (1936) endures as Charlie Chaplin's best feature.
I:8676;416;comic look at the machine age and the Great Depression, it recaptures the effortless spirit of Chaplin's Mutual shorts while toning down the pathos of his previous efforts.
I:8676;417;In fact, the film's episodic structure is a delightful throwback to his early two.
I:8676;418;The inspired chemistry between Chaplin's Little Tramp and Paulette Goddard's Gamine forms the heart and soul of this cinema classic .
I:8676;419;beautifully evoked in the memorable closing shot.
I:8676;420;"No matter how many times you have seen it, ""Modern Times"" remains an unforgettable film experience."
I:8676;421;I haven't seen this in years and it was great to watch it again.
I:8676;422;The picture and sound are really good for how old it is.
I:8676;423;The more I watch it, the more I feel that Charlie Chaplin's sublime silent MODERN TIMES (1936) is his finest film.
I:8676;424;The scenes with Goddard are heartbreakingly lovely, while Charlie is having a great time in prison.
I:8676;425;She tags along when he gets a job as an all night watchman in a department store.
I:8676;426;Eluding the police, the two of them head off into a sunrise and bright new future in one of the loveliest endings in all of modern movie history for me.
I:8676;427;Disk two bonuses that will take you a good two hours to see.
I:8676;428;mODERN TIMES is, quite simply, one of the great comedies of all time and, arguably, Chaplin's most sublime masterpiece.
I:8676;429;With so many wonderful Harold Lloyd silent comedies now available in restored 35mm archive prints, along with the same for Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin is getting ignored again.
I:8676;430;Do watch MODERN TIMES to see the great Charlie at his greatest.
I:8676;431;This is Charlie at his best.
I:8676;432;This is a must see for anyone who loves the movies.
I:8676;433;It is a timeless classic and its humanity rings as true today as when it was first made back in the Great Depression.
I:8676;434;Kids just love the old silent movies just as much as cartoons.
I:8676;435;Expecially if there are as comic and timeless as Chaplin.
I:8676;436;A day in a life of Charlie!A true classic and a funny look at the industrial revolution, any one who has worked for a tyranical supervisor will enjoy this movie.
I:8676;437;But with this film, Chaplin was indeed getting with the times, and it was his last true silent film his next film, The Great Dictator, was a transition film in that it was a talkie, but it was also spoken largely in jibberish (he probably still wasnt comfortable with the idea of being judged as a proper talking actor and competing with the likes of Orson Welles and Clark Gable).
I:8676;438;This is where we get the amazing blind roller skating scene, as well as the beautiful and hilarious nonsense song.
I:8676;439;the scenes and stunts are hilarious beginning to end, and we could hardly stop laughing scene after scene.
I:8676;440;Chaplin was a real genius of physical comedy.
I:8676;441;As bonus materials we also look over the shoulder of Philippe Truffault and Jean.
I:8676;442;They note that theres always food in Chaplins films, and how the film is a documentary of the times, going all the way to the shack and shanty.
I:8676;443;We see a great outtake of Chaplin interacting with a stern traffic cop at one road crossing.
I:8676;444;We see the cool opening animation of TOBIS studio, with the rooster crapping out the I into TOB S (who came up with this stuff??
I:8676;445;Great photo collections show the factory, from jail to paradise, factories re.
I:8676;446;behind The Scenes In The Machine Age is a film created by the Department of Labor of the US government showing how industrialisation has robbed men and women of jobs, how it has created labour efficiencies, and how job efficiencies still need to be created, even as the enforcement of good conditions for workers is being promoted.
I:8676;447;Symphony In F shows the production of a car, from the arrival of crude rubber to the creation of tires to the production of a car, with a special event showing the creation of the 28 millionth Ford.
I:8676;448;Theres a cool surf guitar intro, we meet the passionate projectionists, and then we meet the villagers.
I:8676;449;I have 12 children, and who knows how many grandchildren.
I:8676;450;Uncomplicated and fun for all ages.
I:8676;451;This is a movie I love watching over and over again.
I:8676;452;The film's plot is too well known for me to focus on it so I will review the added content.
I:8676;453;included is a very good audio commentary by Chaplin biographer David Robinson who describes various aspects of the film and some of the controversy it generated including some of the sound effects.
I:8676;454;The Criterion edition has a magnificent Blu.
I:8676;455;it is a timeless classic that every person should see.
I:8676;456;Yet, his Tramp is the most religious and iconic figure in all of cinema.
I:8676;457;He was still making silent films nearly a decade later.
I:8676;458;This film was a last, in many respects, for Chaplin: his last silent film and the final indisputable appearance of the Tramp.
I:8676;459;The Factory task master talks through a Orwellian screen.
I:8676;460;Rather, it adds up to a silent with clever, carefully chosen, cartoonish sound effects.
I:8676;461;all the happy things that civilization has produced like Chaplin movies, are all gone and done with.
I:8676;462;Chaplin's Tramp, as a screen persona, has emotional resonance in his reflections and labors, inspired by his intimate intertwining and quintessential recognition with the Gamin (Goddard).
I:8676;463;His Tramp is the socially devalued of the Beatitudes.
I:8676;464;A misfit in respectable society, he embodies that blistering critique of status.
I:8676;465;"humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness."""
I:8676;466;Banana in hand, knife clenched in her teeth like a cocky Captain Blood, she stands, with legs apart, barefoot and defiant, as an overtly sexual woman: a refreshing change of pace (and rarity) for a Chaplin leading lady (which were normally of the child bride variety).
I:8676;467;He will belatedly see the waif as a gift of wisdom.
I:8676;468;together short film vignettes, they will embark on a seemingly ill.
I:8676;469;Such simplicity is personified in the suburban comic strip.
I:8676;470;this Criterion Collection edition of the film is, naturally, exemplary.
I:8676;471;My husband and I really enjoyed this, the comedy is genius.
I:8676;472;Really timeless work for fans of Chaplin and those new to his films.
I:8676;473;This film is an excellent introduction to the talent of charlie chaplin.
I:8676;474;I would (and have) recommended it to my entire family.
I:8676;475;My family happened to find this on TV one night and we had a great time watching it.
I:8676;476;The genius of the man is on display to the fullest in this delightful disc.
I:8676;477;While it is only the first Charlie Chaplin movie I have seen, I am already prepared to say that this is one of his best works.
I:8676;478;In this memorable, hilarious and touching movie, Chaplin takes on the modern era along with his newfound girl friend (Paulette Goddard) in a quest for happiness.
I:8676;479;There are countless memorable sight gags in Modern Times.
I:8676;480;His memorable song at the end, however, seems to show that he had given up and was ready to enter the modern times of cinema.
I:8676;481;"If only all ""Comedians"" these days could be as funny or creative."
I:8676;482;A life, a shedule from.
