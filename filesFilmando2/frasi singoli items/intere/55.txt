I:8408;1;it is a bit much for the squaemish.
I:8408;2;arnold gives one of his best performances even though he doesnt say much.
I:8408;3;the important message is:do not trust machines!this movie is intense!this is arnolds third best movie.
I:8408;4;I'm all for the extra features and superior sound.
I:8408;5;What it does have is an excellent sci.
I:8408;6;Even if they do release a Special Edtion with all the goodies, its nice to have the old edition, in its original splendor (if you can find it).
I:8408;7;Shot on a tight schedule with an even tighter budget The Terminator shows what James Cameron can do with a story.
I:8408;8;No need to go into detail on the plot but this movie saved Arnold Schwarzenegger's career and he was excellent in the title role.
I:8408;9;Great movie, pretty impressive FX for it's time.
I:8408;10;But I look at it now, and I can tell how old it is.
I:8408;11;Terminator 2 is alot better than this one, and the special effects look clean even 12 years later.
I:8408;12;Still, its a must see for all Terminator fans.
I:8408;13;This is one of the best movies ever, and is certainly Arnold's best.
I:8408;14;Linda H. is much better in this movie than in T2.
I:8408;15;The Terminator is a great piece of Sci.
I:8408;16;fi, and provides great action sequences, but it's not the star.
I:8408;17;Next thing she knows she's attacked and then in the middle of a shoot out.
I:8408;18;He was a legend, a savior, a leader.
I:8408;19;Throughout the night she hears more about John and the legend she herself will become.
I:8408;20;She starts using Reese's first name, Kyle, after he gives her a message from John.
I:8408;21;Next thing Sarah knows it had hijacked a gasoline truck, and is coming to run her over.
I:8408;22;Splitting up Sarah runs, while Kyle manages to plant an explosive on the truck.
I:8408;23;Kyle activates as many machines as possible, to make tracking them harder.
I:8408;24;Finally touching the strength inside her, Sarah re.
I:8408;25;Sarah catches a piece in her leg, and Kyle is killed.
I:8408;26;Her speech patterns, her facial expression, the look in her eyes, and her entire entire body language shifts.
I:8408;27;Taking on the form that Kyle, and the Resistance used.
I:8408;28;I love the entire science fiction concept of time travel and destiny, but also how we as human beings have choices and can shape our futures depending upon the ones we make.
I:8408;29;This movie nails all of these on so many levels.
I:8408;30;This movie is the perfect blend of classic sci.
I:8408;31;Now I realize that this has a lot to do with the way the movie was done and the age, (it was done in 1984) but at night especially, you can see the fuzzy specs in the background.
I:8408;32;Get it and be happy.
I:8408;33;When this first came out, I loved it.
I:8408;34;see because it sets the stage for the remainder of the trilogy.
I:8408;35;The movie is a great classic.
I:8408;36;"character, so is James Cameron's breakthrough film, ""The Terminator."""
I:8408;37;Securing its status as a sci.
I:8408;38;fi classic almost immediately upon impact, it made a star out of a certain Austrian bodybuilder, introduced Hollywood to one of the finest blockbuster directors of our time and forever changed the landscape of both the science fiction and action genres.
I:8408;39;the film opens with a muscle.
I:8408;40;paced and well oiled it really is.
I:8408;41;Sure, there are action scenes galore and you can bet it'll keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:8408;42;Crucial to the film's success though are moments where the film breathes, letting in moments of social commentary and humor like fresh air at all the right moments.
I:8408;43;To be sure, the Terminator's pursuit of Kyle and Sarah is made all the more intense because you believe in them and are placed amidst the chaos via your own investment in the characters.
I:8408;44;while Schwarzenegger is absolutely unforgettable as the unstoppable killing machine, the film is certainly helped a great deal by Biehn's intensity and commitment to material that may have sounded ridiculous on paper.
I:8408;45;Shame her career never really extended beyond this film and its sequel, as she really embodies a character you want to root for.
I:8408;46;Keeping true to such a theme, the film is intense from front to back.
I:8408;47;while there are certainly things that date the film .
I:8408;48;it has held up remarkably well over the years.
I:8408;49;At close to 30 years of age, there are few films that have come along in its wake that can even compare.
I:8408;50;"Truly a bonafide classic, ""The Terminator"" stands in a class by its own."
I:8408;51;The Terminator is a classic!
I:8408;52;And it was a great price as well.
I:8408;53;She got ripped for 2!
I:8408;54;Although a bit dated, it still holds up.
I:8408;55;This is an excellent movie.
I:8408;56;It has a terrific plot and excellent effects for it's time and money.
I:8408;57;one of the best sci.
I:8408;58;The Terminator is the first installment of one of the best Sci.
I:8408;59;fi franchises, but this movie not only is one of the best Sci.
I:8408;60;fi movies that you can find, it's also one of the best action movies as well.
I:8408;61;The story in this movie is so clever that it doesn't matter if some of the visual effects look outdated today, or if some music tracks sound kinda silly, because the plot of this movie must be the most intelligent story about machines.
I:8408;62;the main characters have a lot of depth, specially when we are talking about robots.
I:8408;63;Arnold Schwarzenegger is just perfect for the role of a killer cyborg that travels from the future whose mission is to kill Sarah Connor, the woman that eventually will give birth to John Connor, the leader of the humanity in an apocalyptic future.
I:8408;64;michael Biehn is also great as Kyle Reese, a warrior that travels from the future to protect Sarah from Arnie.
I:8408;65;James Cameron also built a strong reputation with this film, Cameron is one of the best directors in the Sci.
I:8408;66;fi or action genres, also he knows a lot of stuff about technical aspects like visual effects and action sequences.
I:8408;67;The Terminator is one of the best Sci.
I:8408;68;By far the best sci.
I:8408;69;fi movie of the 80's if not the best ever.
I:8408;70;Oh well, maybe in terminator four right?
I:8408;71;A must see and a must own.
I:8408;72;It not only showed that Ahhnold could handle a more challenging role than Conan the Barbarian, but that he was quite capable of taking career risks.
I:8408;73;The pace of the movie is, like the villain, full of purpose and relentless.
I:8408;74;Brad Fiedel's effective musical score, Stan Winston's amazing make.
I:8408;75;up effects, and Cameron's directing helped make The Terminator a classic of the action/science fiction genre.
I:8408;76;definition transfer widescreen version with both its original mono sound track and a new 5.1 Stereo Remix.
I:8408;77;The extra features (such as deleted scenes, making.
I:8408;78;Based on that it appears they have done a good job.
I:8408;79;This is such a wonderful movie I can't even begin to describe it!
I:8408;80;"The fights are absolutely superb(few are more intense)there is lots of funny stuff, such as the quotes ""Yar clothes."
I:8408;81;There is love and fear in this movie, as well, and Ah.
I:8408;82;nold does a wonderful job.
I:8408;83;I especially liked the last fight, where we see the Terminator's real form.
I:8408;84;All laid out, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and if you like intense fighting and iron determination, this movie is for you.
I:8408;85;It is a fantastic science fiction thriller that not only keeps you on the edge of your seat but also gives you food for thought of the possibilities of the plot line really happening.
I:8408;86;The special effects only add more to the impact of this film as well as the superb acting abilities of those not only in major roles but also in minor roles.
I:8408;87;My favorite trio of fast action and sci fi movies are Terminator and its sequals.
I:8408;88;They are fun to watch.
I:8408;89;This is a great classic that is a staple in many personal movie collections.
I:8408;90;The action and suspense scenes are great.
I:8408;91;The most improvement is in the on.
I:8408;92;"ray is not just ""nice."
I:8408;93;The SUPERCLEAN video is the best I have seen.
I:8408;94;definition transfer, well I GUESS SO!
I:8408;95;And the added 5.1 audio is a nice bonus.
I:8408;96;and definitely close enough to make it sound great.
I:8408;97;The effects are definitely dated, but the concept is still solid.
I:8408;98;I had a college class in which one of my professors made us watch this flick so he could explain that it's actually an allegory for the abortion debate.
I:8408;99;I don't know if I'm willing to credit James Cameron with such a sophisticated agenda, but it does make one view the film in a new and interesting way.
I:8408;100;The whole family really enjoys this movie.
I:8408;101;I recommend this to anyone
I:8408;102;The Good Things*Good amount of action and special effects.
I:8408;103;There's not as much as the sequels, but there is enough to make it edgy and exciting.
I:8408;104;The scenes of the future war are stark and frightening.
I:8408;105;It's very fresh, original, and memorable.
I:8408;106;It's very simple but also very original.
I:8408;107;this is still one of the most quintessential sci.
I:8408;108;Its simple premise is executed effectively, leaving lots of room for strong characters, gripping action, and some good emotional moments.
I:8408;109;filmed, and contains some good special effects for its time.
I:8408;110;Still, it really is one of the best.
I:8408;111;This is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen, it is almost as good as the second one.
I:8408;112;this fast paced time travel thriller is definetly worth purchasing.
I:8408;113;Almost eveything is great about it, the action, the story line, the suspense, and even the roar of kyle's pump shotgun is nicely done.
I:8408;114;I just received this blu.
I:8408;115;"There is still a small amount of ""dust or dirt"" and a few small scratches but this film is still in excellent condition in my opinion."
I:8408;116;"keep in mind this film was low budget, the film medium used was ""rough grain"" and that NO high."
I:8408;117;def transfer will ever yield a sharp and crystal clear image.
I:8408;118;"A perfect example: The new Battlestar Galactica series was purposefully shot ""grainy"" and it will never look crystal clear in a high."
I:8408;119;This movie was a favorite from my past and re.
I:8408;120;watching it with my kids was fun.
I:8408;121;The beginnig of one of the best franchies of all time, arnold at his almost best.
I:8408;122;`The Terminator' is one of those cult films that every `guy' in America, and quite possibly all over the world, has seen and has loved.
I:8408;123;the film takes place in the present (well, the 80's) but the real story is what happen in the future, the year 2029 to be exact.
I:8408;124;this brings me to my point mentioned in my title.
I:8408;125;Is this really a classic?
I:8408;126;`The Matrix' for example is much smarter, much sleeker and constructed much better.
I:8408;127;The synth music is great I think, it gives it the whole robot 80s feeling that the 2nd movie couldn't make with the stupid strings and steel clank noises.
I:8408;128;Anyways, this movie is classic and it doesn't make me scared anymore because 1997 has already passed and that's when the war was supposed to happen.
I:8408;129;All in all a great flick
I:8408;130;with that cryptic message, the heart.
I:8408;131;"pounding music begins and one of the most awesome opening title sequences starts and ""The Terminator"" is underway."
I:8408;132;Few movies have the audacity and confidence in their audience to reveal their plots as gradually as The Terminator.
I:8408;133;It's a movie that's got it all: action, horror, a love story, and, above all, old school science fiction.
I:8408;134;"in the rare event that you know little or nothing about ""The Terminator"" franchise, this movie is much more enjoyable if you don't know the plot of the movie before you see it."
I:8408;135;This movie is worth the price so don't read any more reviews after this one.
I:8408;136;For such a low budget, this movie is very well done.
I:8408;137;The story is very well.
I:8408;138;written, the actors are great, especially Arnold, and for the money they had, the special effects aren't too shabby.
I:8408;139;In fact, this movie was so well.
I:8408;140;This is a classic sci.
I:8408;141;Oh, speaking of classic, look for all of the old 80's fashions, just for fun.
I:8408;142;This is anolds fisrt big role and james fisrt big movie and great.
I:8408;143;this one of fist films and just like his later films its just as good.
I:8408;144;and see the seuel which is just as good.
I:8408;145;All I can say about Terminator is that it has class!
I:8408;146;I'm not really a Science Fiction movie fan, but this movie was amazing!
I:8408;147;He is the 'good guy' of the movie (not to mention cute!)
I:8408;148;He is a person from the future and has come to help Sarah.
I:8408;149;A very thrilling, yet touching movie.
I:8408;150;One of the best classic movies to exist
I:8408;151;art 5.1 stereo remix and also a fantastic hi.
I:8408;152;But I just have to say that this was a job well done.
I:8408;153;Love those old Schwarzenegger movies.
I:8408;154;This movie is an absolute classic.
I:8408;155;It was fun watching this one.
I:8408;156;Arnold's being himself, acting wise, the machine part was the best.
I:8408;157;Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton did great performances, a classic.
I:8408;158;It is now accepted that The Terminator , the predecessor of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, is a classic science fiction film.
I:8408;159;I am happy to lavish praise on both movies.
I:8408;160;Consider though that T1 had a production budget of less than one fifth of T2 and you may start to get a feel for what an outstanding job was done on it.
I:8408;161;When you get down to it, that is the essence of the film and also the source of the suspense and empathy we feel for that character.
I:8408;162;Everyone else has said it so I may as well.
I:8408;163;Schwartzenegger was perfectly cast in the role of an emotionless machine of destruction.
I:8408;164;Played by Michael Biehn, Kyle Reese is determined to save the woman that he loves.
I:8408;165;In my opinion, it is Biehn that shines in this picture.
I:8408;166;terminator was a fast paced film with a relentless series of suspenseful chases and terrifying action sequences.
I:8408;167;I could not at the time imagine a film that could be as gripping, that is until I saw Judgment Day, otherwise known as T2.
I:8408;168;The special effects in T2 were ground braking and the attention to detail was flawless in every part of the movie.
I:8408;169;sets, which get distorted, as he passes them.
I:8408;170;while you normally watch a sequel with an appreciation of where it came from, in this case, you watch the original with an appreciation of what it led to: the film that many praise as one of the greatest sequels in cinematic history.
I:8408;171;In fact, it's a lot of fun.
I:8408;172;all adequate performances, and most of all, terrific action sequences.
I:8408;173;motion animation, a technique that had by this time lost its appeal), is not a great movie, just a pretty good one.
I:8408;174;It has everything: story (true love, drama, and an unstoppable bulletproof cyborg with a hyperalloy combat chasis), great acting, stunts, and some funked out '80s music.
I:8408;175;I love the terminator movies, and even though this one is kinda bad with the specail effects, its awsome.
I:8408;176;The Terminator is considered one of the greatest action movies of all time.
I:8408;177;THE MOVIE: 5/5Terminator (or The Terminator, if you prefer) is and always will be an excellent movie.
I:8408;178;It expertly combines the two genres of science fiction and action.
I:8408;179;After this, he made classic movies such as Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator 2, and of course, Titanic.
I:8408;180;Terminator truly is a modern classic.
I:8408;181;fi B. movie) It's definitely a nostalgic experience in sound.
I:8408;182;Still, it was a great video improvement.
I:8408;183;It added new sound effects and made the dialogue sound normal.
I:8408;184;To top it all off, I found that the Blu.
I:8408;185;ray as it looks modern and sounds technically better.
I:8408;186;Part thriller, part romance, part time travel paradox, The Terminator was a blast when it first came out and is just as much fun to watch now.
I:8408;187;an 18 minute retrospective with James Cameron (JC) and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the new one.
I:8408;188;There is a lot to see here and it is all interesting.
I:8408;189;There are some fascinating revelations here .
I:8408;190;I just receive my copy and what a surprise !
I:8408;191;Viewed: 11/03, 6/07, 6/12Rate: 106/07: The Terminator is so good that it is an absolutely devastating picture.
I:8408;192;The bodybuilding work in the former days has served Arnold extremely well because he was born to be ready to play the Terminator.
I:8408;193;His Terminator is a magnificent villain.
I:8408;194;There are many great scenes in The Terminator, and even the ones when the Terminator goes in a slow.
I:8408;195;He totally set the tone of the picture by heightening the realism along with the stark tone in how he described the Terminator and the future.
I:8408;196;He really created The Terminator the film by his attitude, and Arnold Schwarzenegger did the rest of the work.
I:8408;197;His performance as the Terminator is 100% pure Oscar work.
I:8408;198;Meanwhile, we can thank Stan Winston and his staff for their excellent special effects work.
I:8408;199;Yes, The Terminator is one of the greatest and most influential films ever made.
I:8408;200;A haunting, devastating, and thrilling picture.6/12: This is the film that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a household name, and he will continue to be one forever.
I:8408;201;Also, it's just may as well be so that all of the three end up in a factory that happens to be unlocked for them, and it seems perfectly capable of dealing with the Terminator.
I:8408;202;"Reese summed up the film succinctly well and what it means to face the Terminator, ""Listen, and understand."
I:8408;203;All in all, despite the logic flaws, The Terminator is filled with classic scenes and will always be regarded as a masterpiece.
I:8408;204;The Terminator is, by most accounts, one of the true sci.
I:8408;205;fi classics of all time.
I:8408;206;Even going by dated 1984 effects, this is the true affecionado's movie, whether you like action movies or sci.
I:8408;207;Even though you know how the story will eventually end (there are no real plot twists), the action will keep you gripping at the edge of your seat from the very beginning to the very end.
I:8408;208;this is a classic movie that belongs in every movie fan's collection.
I:8408;209;fold, because not only do I think 1984's THE TERMINATOR (T1) is the best and undisputed of all the Terminator movies, I also think it's the best and undisputed of James Cameron's films!
I:8408;210;It has fantastic effects, but ZERO character development or story!
I:8408;211;Cameron got it right with T1.
I:8408;212;t1 is an superb amalgamation of several genres working in perfect synergy: science fiction, horror, action, love story, AND speculation!
I:8408;213;arnold Schwarzenegger's performance is a wonder to behold to this day!
I:8408;214;Both Michael Biehn (as futuristic rebel soldier Kyle Reese) and Linda Hamilton (as Sarah Connor future mother of resistance leader John Connor) deliver knockout performances as well.
I:8408;215;"The actors really ""sell"" the movie and lift it to a higher level than lesser or miscast actors would have."
I:8408;216;t1's main draw is it's claustropobic, unsettling, atmospheric, noirish tone and feel throughout, thanks in large part to the memorable beating, bouncing score that accompanies the Terminator whenever he shows up.
I:8408;217;I think it is due to the condition of the original master.
I:8408;218;There is much grain throughout.
I:8408;219;The rest of the audio is top notch.
I:8408;220;Probably the best this film has ever sounded.
I:8408;221;All in all, it is a modest transfer.
I:8408;222;This futur is fort probable and very easily conceivable !
I:8408;223;An sure the terminator who's describe in this movie will be !
I:8408;224;Honesty, this is my favorite movie of all time.
I:8408;225;I've seen it at least 20 times and every time I see it I pick something else that makes me realize how truly great it is.
I:8408;226;my favorite part is when Kyle descibes a picture he had of Sara and then confesses his love for her.
I:8408;227;What I would give to take her place!I could go on and on forever about this, but I'll end here by saying that both this and sequel are excellent, but this one is better.
I:8408;228;The Terminator is likely one of the most widely screened movies of the last twenty years.
I:8408;229;"In many ways its effects on popular consciousness have been notable, and it also made a major star of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who up to that point had appeared only in supporting roles in minor films like ""Stay Hungry"" with Jeff Bridges and ""The Villain"" with an aging Kirk Douglas."
I:8408;230;wrenching action, and the viewer is assaulted by both sights and data that intrigue and astound him or her, for this is science fiction very well done, a story that has meat and bones over its substantial interior, and like the cyborg that Arnold plays, is ready to slay you into submission.
I:8408;231;This is a classic thriller, folks, one that has already spawned another hit movie (T.2), and rumor now has it that Schwarzenegger and company have T.3 ready to begin production soon.
I:8408;232;Just grab this, some popcorn, and a box of Jujifruits.
I:8408;233;Which makes this casting of Arnold as the terminator, a robot with a human flesh covering, perfect.
I:8408;234;the Terminator is a classic action film but it does have a sub.
I:8408;235;Terminator is a classic sci.
I:8408;236;ray version does the best it can with the very old special effects.
I:8408;237;Special feature about creating some of those effects was interesting.
I:8408;238;James Cameron's The Terminator is not only one of the best actionmovies ever made, it is also among the most influential sci.
I:8408;239;Even films like last year's The Matrix were at least inspired by the man vs. machine.
I:8408;240;from the beginning to the end, this film is packed with incredible action scenes.
I:8408;241;It is especially wonderful that the action is not just there for its own sake.
I:8408;242;The fine screenplay motivates everything that happens onscreen.
I:8408;243;The film never lets up for one moment.
I:8408;244;It also put director James Cameron on the map.
I:8408;245;I can say with confidence that I dislike Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor.
I:8408;246;His movies were once really exciting and adrenaline.
I:8408;247;Michael sure has his work cut out for him as far as convincing Sarah he's actually the good guy!
I:8408;248;This makes a compelling storyline.
I:8408;249;Back in the day this was considered an enormous deal and a total surprise to everyone.
I:8408;250;and watching them move around is comparable to watching a movie within a movie.
I:8408;251;It has to due with my love of science fiction when executed a certain way.
I:8408;252;The Terminator succeeds on both counts.
I:8408;253;This is a *wonderful* way to enable my heart to pump with unbelievable nonstop excitement.
I:8408;254;It's just really freaking freaky!Overall, a highly recommended film.
I:8408;255;Does it hold up well?
I:8408;256;A young girl running for her life presents a ton of suspense.
I:8408;257;This is how a good action/science fiction should be in my opinion.
I:8408;258;One of The best movies ever.
I:8408;259;Also, one of Arnolds best perfomences.
I:8408;260;The Terminator series is classic entertainment.
I:8408;261;ray transfer is very good.
I:8408;262;The picture is good and the sound even better.
I:8408;263;"The phrase ""I'll be back"" conjures up pretty much one image in today's world
I:8408;264;what is so intriguing about Sara Connors (Linda Hamilton)?
I:8408;265;When I was 15, I snuck into the movie theatre with my friend to go see this movie.
I:8408;266;to me, it's a lesson in our own history.
I:8408;267;First, the introduction of time travel as an element of adding to the possibilities of life.
I:8408;268;Second, is the concept that robots can and quite possibly are a very real part of our life.
I:8408;269;If you're a science fiction fan and futurist as I am.
I:8408;270;The idea that the future can collide with the present day just boggles the mind, and this is among the first movies .
I:8408;271;anything is possible in this amazing reality.
I:8408;272;and such magnificent presentation too.
I:8408;273;Arnold, I love you in this movie.
I:8408;274;A perfect role for the Schwarzenegger, an emotionless robot.
I:8408;275;Arnold has never been a good actor, and this movie was the perfect showcase for that ability.
I:8408;276;He didn't have to act, and he did a good job.
I:8408;277;james Cameron turned in his usual well detailed showcase, the whole plot and storyline were fantastic.
I:8408;278;Michael Beihn and Linda Hamilton were the real actors of this film, and their performances were believable enough to carry the film, especially Hamilton's.
I:8408;279;This is Arnie's best role still to date, although he doesn't talk much.
I:8408;280;Hamilton delivers a good performance as a young woman frightened out of her wits.
I:8408;281;Director James Cameron does an excellent job putting the film together, and I found it hard to believe that this was only his second Hollywood film.
I:8408;282;Its a fun, suspenseful movie to watch!
I:8408;283;Huge fan of the original Terminator.
I:8408;284;OK, I had my suspicions after seeing Conan The Barbarian, but this movie proves it beyond any shadow of doubt.
I:8408;285;He is now governor of California!
I:8408;286;Soon, SkyNet will be established and Arnold will become our king!
I:8408;287;James Cameron's intense masterwork of sci.
I:8408;288;ray edition and found them identical .
I:8408;289;maybe one day this wonderful movie will receive the treatment it deserves and be digitally remastered and have it's frames scanned with a high definition camera .
I:8408;290;Terminator is as close to perfect as any movie can be.
I:8408;291;Many times when people talk about this film, they talk about the great action.
I:8408;292;This movie is as much about love as it is about action.
I:8408;293;This is an excellent movie with wonderful performances.
I:8408;294;Also, look for Bill Paxton in his first Cameron movie as a punk that gets beat up by Arnold.
I:8408;295;Though the film has some serious problems, Schwarzenegger fans will love this classic.
I:8408;296;At a certain point during what is really one long huge over the top epic chase scene the cinematography editing acting movie making coalesce into moments of high art .
I:8408;297;Like the other Terminator's , films, they are full of action and and what might happen if the MACHINES take ove.
I:8408;298;The Terminator holds up surprisingly well against most of the big budget stuff made today.
I:8408;299;It's dark tones, rapid pace, and terrifically appropriate music make it a landmark in the action/sci.
I:8408;300;I can see why the whole mis.
I:8408;301;It was on the Discovery Channel a few years ago)The Terminator is a wonderful movie.
I:8408;302;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
I:8408;303;ray is only a high rate MPEG.
I:8408;304;Never heard this movie with such clarity before.
I:8408;305;"It is a brilliant action adventure dealing with the subject of modern technology
I:8408;306;In THE TERMINATOR, and every other film he has done since then, Cameron demonstrates how story and characters are the most essential thing to any great movie.
I:8408;307;by now, everybody knows the story.
I:8408;308;The story is rather clever.
I:8408;309;If you really pay attention to the film, you'll discover what I was talking about in how everything that happens, from the future to the present, is completely tied together.
I:8408;310;It looked like a really wild ride of an action movie.
I:8408;311;I knew about Arnold Schwarzenegger as a champion bodybuilder, and also from the two Conan movies he did in 81, and 82.
I:8408;312;He succeeds this task with the way he moves his eyes, head, and body.
I:8408;313;Watch carefully and you'll see he never blinks except in one scene where he fires a handgun.
I:8408;314;You see Arnold slice into his arm to work on the mechanism that controls his hand movements, and pull out his human eye from the socket, revealing a red metal eye.
I:8408;315;It is amazing how Winston makes this illusion completely real.
I:8408;316;It wasn't until I saw the other films Cameron wrote and directed, including ALIENS (1986), THE ABYSS (1989), and TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY (1991) I discovered something else about the movie after I watched it again: It is still a violent movie, but it is also extremely intense.
I:8408;317;The more intensity a motion picture delivers, the more it drives you to the edge of your seat.
I:8408;318;It made Arnold Schwarzenegger into a star, and James Cameron into a real director.
I:8408;319;He has been one of my favorite filmmakers ever since that day in 1985 when I first popped this movie into my VCR.
I:8408;320;Deleted Scenes, Retrospective Trailers, the works.
I:8408;321;All I can say is it's about time.
I:8408;322;The Terminator is a terrific movie and a hallmark of American cinema.
I:8408;323;It has strong charecters, a good plot, awesome and exciting action sequences, a great music score, supreme acting, and great direction.
I:8408;324;The second film is YES a very good movie.
I:8408;325;It one two more oscars than the first, and has supreme special effects, but the first film is much classier, and has much stronger charecters than T2.
I:8408;326;I always wished that a special edition of T1 would be made, and now, here it is!
I:8408;327;It's a great, brand new version, with Original Mono Sountrack, AND a brand new.
I:8408;328;Also, the explosions are much more detailed, in terms of sound.
I:8408;329;I love the original, the way it was seen in theatres.
I:8408;330;This one's got more info about the making, and was very interesting.
I:8408;331;Most of the scenes are just tiny little bits, but some are interesting.
I:8408;332;There are two scenes that are longer.
I:8408;333;I thank reviwer alan5973 for telling me the hidden stuff.
I:8408;334;There's some cool stuff here.
I:8408;335;This picture's very good though!
I:8408;336;He does on the deleted footage, and it would be nice to have a whole commentary.
I:8408;337;Get the special edition!If you found my review helpful, please don't forget to give me a vote!
I:8408;338;This has got to be one of the best and most dark sci.
I:8408;339;fi films ever made . . . The characters and effects were beyond their time!
I:8408;340;I loved this movie the first time I saw it back when it came out, and have seen it several times since.
I:8408;341;changing example of cinematic art, but it is a satisfying way to kill an afternoon.
I:8408;342;This is a great movie James Cameron if awesome,and it's on blu.
I:8408;343;ray and found some slight improvement.
I:8408;344;keep in mind that this Blu.
I:8408;345;Arnold is Arnold, the rest is the rest, no other comments necessary, he brings the best of his character, and also is in great shape.
I:8408;346;It satisfied me and the story is still quite clever given the time period of making films in the eighties.
I:8408;347;As usual Amazon has been promt with most of my orders.
I:8408;348;Good 'ol Arnold's finest performance comes to Blu.
I:8408;349;This film is known for being one of the most popular Sci.
I:8408;350;It's a classic for a reason.
I:8408;351;Arnold did too, with another fine film you should check out:Terminator 2: Judgment Day (Skynet Edition) [Blu.
I:8408;352;Lots of grain, and not just during the darker scenes (you will see this immediately at the start).
I:8408;353;This is the only one really worth watching.
I:8408;354;This is one of my favorite action movies and I recommend it for anyone who likes them.
I:8408;355;Tripping, dude in real life is pumping iron and winning Mr. Universe awards, beating out that Ferrigno guy that played the Hulk.
I:8408;356;This may be the greatest science fiction film ever made.
I:8408;357;It was a perfect story in this single film.
I:8408;358;Some are still very well done.
I:8408;359;Despite that flaw this is the perfect sci.
I:8408;360;It is a fully realized visual story and I give it 5 stars for it's impact on the science fiction genre.
I:8408;361;First time I saw it in the movie theater, I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie.
I:8408;362;fi classic was the first of it's kind, and the film that launched both Arnold Schwarzenneger and James Cameron into cinema juggernauts they are today.
I:8408;363;Says Schwarzenneger when he returns as the Terminator in action epic, T2:Judgment DayUnfortunately he's also back in T3: Rise of the Machines.
I:8408;364;If you love arnold schwarzenegger then this movie is an classic for you.
I:8408;365;This is the first installment of a four part movie collection for you who have seen this you will understand what I am saying and for all of you who are younger who love scifi movies with lots of action and some gore you will love this.
I:8408;366;It will be a great addition to your movie collection.
I:8408;367;I have loved this movie for years, and it stands up surprisingly well to the test of time.
I:8408;368;While the fashions and technology are dated, all you have to do is explain it as happening in the past.
I:8408;369;My 14 and 17 yo daughters thought it was a very good movie, although I had to explain that the years would have to be adjusted to make it work.
I:8408;370;The action sequences are quite good, and the early part of the movie where the police don't believe the time.
I:8408;371;travel premise is completely believable.
I:8408;372;"Michael Biehn is wonderful in this movie as Kyle Reese
I:8408;373;among the films arnold schwarzenegger has made over the years.
I:8408;374;I really hope they make a sequel to this, because there are lots other things that could be done.
I:8408;375;Like making the T.1 able not just travel through time, but actually control it.
I:8408;376;picture is very good for all these years later, sound is a bit iffy.
I:8408;377;retrospective documentary is very good with lots of trivia.
I:8408;378;a gret film that still has the biggest paradox known to movie making.
I:8408;379;fi film was set in the modern world as we knew it at the time as opposed to outer space.
I:8408;380;this film will be 20 years old next year, but nobody can have any doubt that it's a modern classic.
I:8408;381;fi offerings of the past decade, however, the brilliance of this film is in the telling of the story and of James Cameron's ability to convey the story by using other characters to talk about other events that have happened ie.
I:8408;382;If you are a big fan of all things sci.
I:8408;383;The Terminator is an original work, that represents both the top in action movies and a model for all action movies to follow.
I:8408;384;Schwarzenegger puts on an amazing performance as the no.
I:8408;385;Look, it was the first of its kind, it has great action scenes, can't go wrong there.
I:8408;386;I know some early James bond films from the 60's look better than some from the 90's when in theory the 90's films should look way better, but it has to be the source.
I:8408;387;Terminator is one of the greatest sci.
I:8408;388;Schwarzenegger is awesome in this movie.
I:8408;389;There is a love story mixed into the plot and the actors have great chemistry and intensity.
I:8408;390;This is the movie that turned Arnold into the world's greatest action star.
I:8408;391;See this movie, and then go watch Terminator 2, which is also great!
I:8408;392;Sound is good as well, and you don't have to crank your volume to stupid levels .
I:8408;393;well recommended, then, and fingers crossed for 'Aliens' and 'The Abyss' when they come out.
I:8408;394;One of the best movies ever made, this has everything.
I:8408;395;The action is crisp, the situation powerful and the whole film delivers right across the board.
I:8408;396;The Terminator remains the great 80s B. film.
I:8408;397;"up ""Outer Limits"" plot with a brilliant conception of a futuristic war against self."
I:8408;398;the Terminator was a breakthrough film that altered the Sci.
I:8408;399;But all of this cultural relativism aside, The Terminator is a well.
I:8408;400;esque poetics of the first film and goes for pure commercialism.
I:8408;401;The movie is good and entertaining and terrible in outcome.
I:8408;402;Schwarzenegger is at his best in one of the old hits of the ninety's.
I:8408;403;The Terminator has become a major franchise that has spawned three sequels, and several video games, and has even spawned action figures for collectors to keep as memorabilia of such a great film.
I:8408;404;fi fan to miss out on this classic, The Terminator is really a one of a kind film.
I:8408;405;First of all i would just like to say that The Terminator is a masterpiece that will never die, and i agree with you guys when you say that it is way better than the second film.
I:8408;406;It's best you don't seek it out.
I:8408;407;it's pretty cool watching this film as even though he hasn't had a whole lot experience, James knows how to shoot a film.
I:8408;408;Action scenes are well done and they're pretty simplistic in its terms too unlike the ambitious sequel.
I:8408;409;In T2, a lot of the effects still hold up despite advancements, here, they look old.
I:8408;410;But of course, the terminator's so cool you're thinking who cares?It's the movie that launched James Cameron's career, made Arnold a star, and was a launching pad for more advancements in technology.
I:8408;411;It looks its age but it's still no less fun
I:8408;412;Great movie, and this disc doesn't let down.
I:8408;413;A classic movie and a great disc.
I:8408;414;This one is a classic.
I:8408;415;She lives with a roommate and has a pet lizard life is good.
I:8408;416;At that same time a human warrior from the future has come to protect her, Kyle Reese.
I:8408;417;in my opinion this is Arnolds best movie, it won't be forgotten easily.
I:8408;418;It is suspensful and will keep you guessing, will the terminator get her?
I:8408;419;The beginning is quite amazing, I mean it isn't mind blowing graphics for our time.
I:8408;420;James Cameron did a superb job in filming this.
I:8408;421;The third one is better than the second one because it actually shows judgement day.
I:8408;422;The second one is alright because it has Linda Hamilton.
I:8408;423;There's one superb scene between Reece and Connor when she realises they should take out Cyberdyne systems itself.
I:8408;424;Not as good as the sequel, but great features, great menus, great packaging and good special features.
I:8408;425;and it's famous for good reason.
I:8408;426;From the first chilling images of a charred and ruined Los Angeles to the same metropolis some 45 years earlier, this film is thoroughly excellent.
I:8408;427;the plot is intrisically simple, and therefore chilling and effective for that very reason.
I:8408;428;a Terminator, a computer system with a metal skeleton and surrounded by human tissue created for one thing.
I:8408;429;the plot is helped immensely by the directing of James Cameron, which is quite superb.
I:8408;430;everything about the terminator itself is done quite realistically.
I:8408;431;And, of course, Schwarzenneger is the perfect choice for such a role.
I:8408;432;A good actress is important for such a key role, and Linda Hamilton certainly does a good job, even though she, at about 28, was playing a 19 year.
I:8408;433;date, since the movie was made in 1984, but no movie can be expected to upgrade itself for the changing times, and for the time they were quite good.
I:8408;434;the the sheer effect of a skeletal terminator still pursuing his mission even after being in the middle of a semi explosion is good enough, and the failings of the special effects can be overlooked.
I:8408;435;and certainly the action sequences are tremendous.
I:8408;436;makes for a wide array of tense and suspensful scenes.
I:8408;437;all a superb film, except for the fact that Reese and Connor end up producing John illegitimately.
I:8408;438;but if you see it edited, it's an superb film!
I:8408;439;My son was hooked, really a great series of movies.
I:8408;440;My husband remembers watching it for the first time and now our son is old enough we shared it with him!
I:8408;441;"There are also ""terminated"" scenes, two documentaries and the oringinal tratment."
I:8408;442;In my opinion a great movie got even greater.
I:8408;443;"Here's another film from the 1980s that has reached ""classic"" status."
I:8408;444;"here, Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are the ""good guys."""
I:8408;445;The first time I remember those words.
I:8408;446;Turn the disc to the other side, and the special extras will keep you drooling.
I:8408;447;Its the definitive version you must own if you love the first movie.
I:8408;448;apocalyptic murder and mayhem is still the thrill.
I:8408;449;ride it was when I first saw it in the theater in the mid.80's.
I:8408;450;making that transcends the genre.
I:8408;451;week gorefest, The Terminator manages to create characters you care about, characters .
I:8408;452;who actually, and believably, mature over the course of the movie.
I:8408;453;wrenchingly realistic moments during the Terminator's self.
I:8408;454;in addition to the movie in full.
I:8408;455;There are a couple nice documentaries, and the production artwork is actually worth checking out (James Cameron's days in Roger Corman's art department really show here).
I:8408;456;About all that's missing are cast and crew commentaries, but a lot of that kind of content is included in the documentaries.
I:8408;457;fi/horror films of all times.
I:8408;458;A surprisngly great Start to Terminator group of movies.
I:8408;459;Plenty of action and well acted and just well done.
I:8408;460;Really the best of three although all were well done increasing in the 2nd 3rd ones with more Digital action.
I:8408;461;This one before that Digital stuff has it's place and is terrific.
I:8408;462;nothing to say, wonderful classic best movie still today the best this and the second movie, the best of Cameron, and Arnie of course.
I:8408;463;ray format has given this great movie an extra charge the sound is incredible and the special effects really pop.
I:8408;464;Of all the Terminator movies this is my favorite.
I:8408;465;The story starts, and the saga begins.
I:8408;466;The memory of the 'Not Knowing' of the first movie comes with emotions.
I:8408;467;This one is my favorite by far.
I:8408;468;Thank you for finally giving this movie the audio remaster it deserves.
I:8408;469;Excellent movie for its time and when it was made.
I:8408;470;I highly recommend watching it from the beginning to the last one made.
I:8408;471;I enjoy all the terminator movies.
I:8408;472;Terminator is awesome best science fiction movie since star wars.
I:8408;473;Arnold Schwarzenegger is awesome he is The Terminator and always will be.
I:8408;474;This classic SF action picture put both Schwartzeneggar and writer/director James Cameron on the map, and rightfully so.
I:8408;475;The script is efficient and lean, moving effortlessly from thrill to thrill with not a wasted scene in between action set pieces.
I:8408;476;This film was clearly made on a budget, but the effects hold up well, even today.
I:8408;477;The modern classics of science fiction have been able to infuse crowd.
I:8408;478;pleasing action scenes with truly thought.
I:8408;479;From the chillingly violent social commentary of Paul Verhoeven's Robocop to the stylish and brainy conceits of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, few genres are able to balance the scales so well, yet depressingly so seldom.
I:8408;480;One such classic was unleashed in 1984 under the title The Terminator.
I:8408;481;The stunningly clever framework that Cameron provides (he also wrote the script) is only one of the many delightful aspects of The Terminator.
I:8408;482;Though he's played a hero more times than I can count, Arnold delivers his most entertaining performance ever as the unstoppable beast.
I:8408;483;"As Reese, Michael Biehn (Aliens) hits the right ""action."
I:8408;484;"hero"" buttons, and while he falters a bit in the movie's more tender moments, that's okay, because Biehn's a cool actor."
I:8408;485;"and the ""tender moments"" last about three minutes in total."
I:8408;486;with one of the more clever sci.
I:8408;487;fi screenplays of the last part of the 20th century, and some truly exciting action sequences, Terminatorevery bit as good as you might have heard.
I:8408;488;I thought it was a great movie then and it is still a great movie.
I:8408;489;A man from the future also comes back to try and save her from the Terminator.
I:8408;490;the movie has a great story to it.
I:8408;491;It has a very dark and moody atmosphere to it mainly because of the perfect music that goes along with the movie.
I:8408;492;The plot line will really make you think all the way through.
I:8408;493;You will be on the edge of your seat all the way through with very few scenes to catch your breath.
I:8408;494;the acting in it is superb.
I:8408;495;Arnold makes the perfect Terminator.
I:8408;496;Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton have excellent chemistry together.
I:8408;497;the special effects are very nice.
I:8408;498;The effects are very realistic and you will never say anything looks fake.
I:8408;499;You will probably be surprised when you watch the documentary.
I:8408;500;I have seen quite a few action, sci.
I:8408;501;fi movies that have great multi.
I:8408;502;channel sound and this movie sounds the best so far.
I:8408;503;Fantastic!The extras including two documentaries and deleted scenes are worth the price of admission alone.
I:8408;504;Some very interesting facts about the movie that will make you say, that's how they did that?!
I:8408;505;This movie is as fresh as it was in the mid 80's and will be fresh thirty years from now.
I:8408;506;This was a great and classic flick.
I:8408;507;But this is the one that made Arnold a legend.
I:8408;508;T1 and T2 are the only ones worth watching.
I:8408;509;Probably the best B movie ever made.
I:8408;510;The story is exceptional and the effects are excellent.
I:8408;511;the Special Edition offers many extras.
I:8408;512;I didn't have that high of an opinion of Cameron after his 'King of the World' thing at the Oscars, but after seeing the docu's I have a new respect for his talent and vision.
I:8408;513;special effects a little dated but probably excellent for that time.
I:8408;514;you all know the story, and i just wanted to write my opinion about this movie.
I:8408;515;i think the best part of it is at the dance club when the three main characters first meet.
I:8408;516;the song they used there in that scene fit perfectly, ( you got me runnin' ).
I:8408;517;on the whole the music in the movie added such adrenaline to the whole that you can't help but love it.
I:8408;518;Tv is high def btw.
I:8408;519;this version is much better.
I:8408;520;smart computer system, sends back a machine.
I:8408;521;The Terminator was as good as I remembered it.
I:8408;522;I told my grandson it was the best of all of the Terminator movies.
I:8408;523;Arnold was perfect in the part and I am a big fan of Linda Hamilton.
I:8408;524;T3, was the first Terminator movie I saw, and I greatly enjoyed it.
I:8408;525;When I heard the first two were better, I bought both without watching them and I was satisfied.
I:8408;526;Though I will admit I'm a very tiny bit underwhelmed.
I:8408;527;like film, then look no further, this is it.8/10 good, compelling and thought provoking (though not in a peaceful way) a good film that's sets it's own standards.
I:8408;528;It'll always be one of my favorites!
I:8408;529;If you've never seen this film, you're missing one of the greatest movies of our times, it's classic sci.
I:8408;530;It has some interesting twists and turns during the movie, I would recommend that you pick this up today.
I:8408;531;"There are countless ways to describe how I think of this film
I:8408;532;The first in the classic Terminator movie series is a ground.
I:8408;533;breaking cinematic work of art of absolutely stunning proportions and put Arnold Schwarzenegger on the map and made him one of the biggest movie stars of the 1980s and early 1990s before several commercial duds would temporarily dampen his success later on (Batman and Robin anyone?)
I:8408;534;It also brings to mind that it is possible to actually build a machine that could do the same things that Terminator actually does in this movie.
I:8408;535;In top of it all, it is very chilling as the movie's story does brush very closely with reality at the possibility of all of the things happening in this movie actually occurring in real life especially with all of these computer virus attacks that have crippled businesses these past few years although time travel may not be possible because it would likely have messed up the timeline already.
I:8408;536;While parts of this movie really show signs of being extremely dated, particularly the futuristic battle scenes in 2029, the low budget spent on making this incredible movie really went into good use thanks in part to a strong story and stunning directing thanks in part to the blossoming talent of James Cameron.
I:8408;537;Terminator is arguably one of the best movies from the 1980s and also one of the most fascinating and most innovative sci.
I:8408;538;The Terminator is a highly essential film for the ages.
I:8408;539;"From here through the next two movies, we hear that unforgettable line ""I'll Be Back!"""
I:8408;540;Whether to see cinematic innovation or just simply have fun, or just have some 1980s nostalgia, this movie delivers all of the above and is an essential film and the success of it resulted in two dynamite sequels.
I:8408;541;fi flick into a timeless modern masterpiece.
I:8408;542;All three of the Terminator movies are masterpieces.
I:8408;543;Almost eighteen years after its original release, The Terminator still remains one of the best science fiction movies ever made.
I:8408;544;the 1984 sleeper hit that catapulted both Arnold Schwarzenegger's and director James Cameron's career to stardom revolves around a young woman who .
I:8408;545;will play a stellar role in the survival of humanity.
I:8408;546;the brilliance of the story lies with the fact that the horrid science fiction of a devastated 21st century world comes to the familiar nighttime streets of 1984 Los Angeles.
I:8408;547;a fascinating storyline, superb acting from all three main characters, brilliant special effects and spectacular chases through the dark moody nights of a seemingly hostile Los Angeles make for an absolute classic in its kind and a movie that no science fiction fan should pass up!
I:8408;548;I love your movies and would love to hear your comments!)
I:8408;549;Audio and video are crisp.
I:8408;550;But still a good movie.
I:8408;551;Very original at the time it was made and one of the all time best films ever.
I:8408;552;amazing job with the camera from lengendary filmmaker James Cameron (Avatar, Titanic, Aliens).
I:8408;553;The only thing I didn't like were the special effects, but at the time they were very good, so I won't complain.2.
I:8408;554;good writing by James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd.
I:8408;555;It was an original story at the time it was made and it had good characters and dialogue.3.
I:8408;556;amazing job because of the all.
I:8408;557;Very good job with the cast.
I:8408;558;There are many people that get shot throughout the movie.
I:8408;559;This is an amazing movie by an amazing director.
I:8408;560;I got hundreds of 'em.
I:8408;561;I was digging through them the other day and, to my delight and surprise, rediscovered THE TERMINATOR, a great action thriller that put director James Cameron and Ahnold on the superstar map.
I:8408;562;schwarzenegger is absolutely perfect as an unemotional cyborg that travels back in time to 1984 to terminate a young woman (Linda Hamilton) destined to give birth to a man who ultimately will lead humans against the machines of the 21st Century.
I:8408;563;Hamilton as the constantly running victim is very good at screaming and looking terrified, while Michael Biehn is solid as her futuristic protector.
I:8408;564;As entertaining as this movie is, the special effects are dated and quite laughable by today's standards.
I:8408;565;And a great kick to watch.
I:8408;566;Still is a great movie to watch.
I:8408;567;if you are looking to see a great SiFi movie.
I:8408;568;What the heck, where is that superb, almost life like imagery?
I:8408;569;And stand by for the plot twist that comes with T2!
I:8408;570;This classic was well worth the price.
I:8408;571;I love the movie and will continue to watch this movie.
I:8408;572;I have always enjoyed seeing the actors as they developed throughout their carears.
I:8408;573;it is one of my all time favorites.
I:8408;574;Instant classic for any Sci Fi fan.
I:8408;575;Watching it now is even better than before, so much missing in todays movies.
I:8408;576;The sound and video is excellent.
I:8408;577;"The acting is solid
I:8408;578;anyways, a very good one if you don't think about the massive flaws in the plot of the movie.
I:8408;579;While almost 25 years after its release, the Terminator franchise is still going strong.
I:8408;580;Lots of bang for the buck with this film as the action and stunts are thrilling and brutal.
I:8408;581;I recommend it for adults 18+.
I:8408;582;THE TERMINATOR is probably the best science fiction film about machines ever created and it helped to make Arnold as big as he is.
I:8408;583;packed and has a very original plot.
I:8408;584;The acting is great and so are the special effects, considering this film is from '84.
I:8408;585;It's filled with thrills, chills and kick.
I:8408;586;The Terminator has been one of those movies that I've been a fan of since the 90's, and it seems like with age, you end up loving it even more.
I:8408;587;With Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies, I consider this among his absolute best, second only to the mighty Total Recall.
I:8408;588;it's also interesting to note that if you ask around a lot of Terminator fans, most will tell you that Terminator 2: Judgment Day is their favorite movie.
I:8408;589;cHARACTERSWhat makes this movie such a great one is the characters.
I:8408;590;Sarah steals the show since she's very easy to relate to, since she feels like a real person.
I:8408;591;arnie did a great job as the Terminator.
I:8408;592;The Terminator lives up to his name, and is one terrifying entity that could easily make him among the best antagonists in film in the last thirty years.
I:8408;593;Especially with Kyle explaining to Sarah what cyborgs are, he does so in a really cautious and quiet manner, since he knows that the Terminator is looking for him.
I:8408;594;An example would be with time travel.
I:8408;595;fi action/thriller entry, the action movies are top.
I:8408;596;since the characters are developed well, these make the action scenes that much more tense.
I:8408;597;Among the best scenes in this has to be when the Terminator enters the Tech Noir club and finds Sarah Connor.
I:8408;598;the action scenes also show Sarah and Kyle as vulnerable characters, which make you root for them even harder as the movie runs.
I:8408;599;cINEMATOGRAPHYAdam Greenberg's cinematography for this was perfect.
I:8408;600;I thought it was perfect to have the final fight take place in a factory loaded with robotic assembly machines, helping to further the feeling of industrialized, metallic terror.
I:8408;601;This was simultaneously gross and impressive to look at.
I:8408;602;Even with the effects that could have aged better, the special effects overall help the movie greatly than harm it.
I:8408;603;sOUNDTRACKBrad Fiedel's soundtrack for this movie is one of the best I've ever heard in cinema, whether it be live.
I:8408;604;"Some may complain that the music is ""dated,"" but I think it matches the tone and style of the movie perfectly."
I:8408;605;The soundtrack perfectly shows that a genius with minimal resources can make something brilliant.
I:8408;606;layers are superb, especially in the scenes where Kyle has a flashback to when he fought giant war machines and automated gunships and during the end fight in the factory.
I:8408;607;fINAL WORDThe Terminator is easily among James Cameron's brightest jewels in his filmography.
I:8408;608;A tight and fast paced view into an alternative future.
I:8408;609;Though slightly dated stylistically as well as technically, it holds up quite well.
I:8408;610;After watching this movie, see T2 .
I:8408;611;one of the greatest sequals of all time.
I:8408;612;great sci fi , for those who complain about sound and picture , well this was 1984 , how could any one complain about a person who became a superstar for speaking only something like 35 words in the hole picture.
I:8408;613;I'm sure it'll look the best it's ever going to at a forty dollar retail price.
I:8408;614;This disc really helps the movie sound more like the second film.
I:8408;615;The truck explosion, the police massacre and the famous I'll be back sequence has a smashing new sound to the audiance.
I:8408;616;The shotguns and the terminator's gun give the film a better experience.
I:8408;617;If you own T@ this installment is a must have!The delelted scenes are great because you get a chance to see some great scenes that never made it to the movie.
I:8408;618;So add this to your collection and enjoy the new features!
I:8408;619;The deleted scenes included are great, if one has never seen them before.
I:8408;620;Out of all the three terminator movies, this is the best one.
I:8408;621;But this movie is still lots of fun: excellent camera work and film editing keep it brisk and moving, many funny and famous bits of dialogue, Arnie's exaggerated accent and wooden acting, a generous amount of carnage done in a half.
I:8408;622;That is the reason I bought it.
I:8408;623;setting action masterpiece is finally getting the treatment it deserves.
I:8408;624;Cameron shows his extraordinary talent for action.
I:8408;625;suspense pictures in this film, it is engrossing its entire running length, never once letting up.
I:8408;626;It is a truly satisfying action thrill ride.
I:8408;627;Everybody knows Arnold as the tough metallic T.800.
I:8408;628;This is the movie that started it all back in 1984, and IMHO, is the best one in the great trilogy.
I:8408;629;But the human resistance sends back a soldier, Kyle Reese, to protect Sarah so John will be born and the human resistance can still fight on.
I:8408;630;this movie is fun, scary, funny, and it grabs your interest from the very first five minutes and does not let go.
I:8408;631;It also has many intricate plot twists, so play close attention.
I:8408;632;"As Rich Eisen (ESPN) said in ""I Love The '80s"", it's a fun story."
I:8408;633;It really helped to make sci.
I:8408;634;I guarantee you'll love it.
I:8408;635;Still holds up in almost every area for a modern audience.
I:8408;636;most know the story and have seen the movie, but the reason for my review is to outline exactly how effective this movie alone is, and how it succeeds and why.
I:8408;637;before I begin, I must say that James Cameron has done an incredible job directing the first two Terminator movies.
I:8408;638;terminator 1 is the basis for the next two sequels, just watch it and note how well the plot, action and Kyle's emotional flashbacks blend together.
I:8408;639;this may even be the most perfect sci.
I:8408;640;actually I find the first Terminator movie to be the best of the three.
I:8408;641;actually most of the movie is aswell, and I find that to suit the movie very well and I must not forget to mention the soundtrack.
I:8408;642;it is absolutely dark and chaotic.
I:8408;643;without any doubt in my mind I can honestly say that this is the most touching one of the Terminator movies.
I:8408;644;This movie is still awesome even today.
I:8408;645;fi, action, a love story and a morality check all in one!
I:8408;646;There are many storyboard and stills that aspiring artists will enjoy and they will take a good hour to go thourgh all of them, as well as the orginal story treatment of the movie which was a lot more dark and violent then the cut is now the terminator skins people and it's pretty gross, I prefer this version, but it's intreasting to see the way it was in the begining.
I:8408;647;well, how can they sell such a Blu Ray disc.
I:8408;648;And to top it all off, the Special Features best aspect is a decent range of subtitles.
I:8408;649;so, the movie itself is a classic, we all know that.
I:8408;650;And occasionally I enjoy the old school grainy pictures.
I:8408;651;"Since I'm a HUGE Terminator freak (I've read ALL of the books I could get my hands on about the Terminator series),I also know the history of this movie and it's rather quite interesting:James Cameron actually made this movie after he had a nightmare about a killer robot from the future and from there, he created one of my favorite movies of all time
I:8408;652;"at the time Linda Hamilton was dating James Cameron
I:8408;653;cyberdyne decided to send a machine back into the past to kill the mother of John Connor back in 1984, but along with the machine comes John's father Kyle Reese to help Sarah and to help train her into becoming the soldier of the future so she can train her son into the man that he is going to become.
I:8408;654;I loved this movie came out.
I:8408;655;The action is still great, but the advances in movie making really come to mind.
I:8408;656;this is an awesome film, and while I do love the sequel much more than the original, I love this one for its dark and chilling atmosphere.
I:8408;657;Iam pleased that this came in fast in two days.
I:8408;658;Amazon Prime is an awesome way to watch many great movies, as well as free two day shipping!
I:8408;659;I am very pleased with.
I:8408;660;ray transfer itself, and that the master film can be restored to better clarity in the future.
I:8408;661;I honestly had never seen this movie entirely until now, but I love it.
I:8408;662;It's a great story with lots of action and violence.
I:8408;663;Darn but he looks good from head to toe in that scene!
I:8408;664;This film has great acting, great special effects and even a tender, love story in addition to the science fiction aspects.
I:8408;665;I would recommend this film to anyone who loves science fiction and action.
I:8408;666;packed adventure and great chases.
I:8408;667;This is truly a classic.
I:8408;668;The special features and behind the scenes are worth watching.
I:8408;669;Great special effects, even for today's standards.
I:8408;670;Terminator is one of the greatest movies ever made and is among the top favorites for almost anyone I know.
I:8408;671;This is the film that really made James Cameron and Arnold, stars in their field.
I:8408;672;an excellent story, with perfect theme music, made this an instant classic, one you can watch over and over again.
I:8408;673;fi, action horror classic, with a bit of a love story mixed in.
I:8408;674;edited into the film as they did in Aliens.
I:8408;675;I wish they had done that or given you the option too, because I really enjoyed it that way.
I:8408;676;I find it really enjoyable to watch deleted scenes on older favorites like this.
I:8408;677;The movie is fun imo.
I:8408;678;Instead, it's about humanity fearing the machines might get too smart(and then, of course, someone just outwiting the machines) and destroy us wonderful smart humans.
I:8408;679;science/technology behind the making and the fame of this movie rather striking.
I:8408;680;Special Edition gets it right on the second time around.
I:8408;681;this movie definitely set Arnold Schwarzenegger to the super star level.
I:8408;682;A complex plot with lots of action special effects that we expect from a Schwarzenegger movie!Brief movie summary .
I:8408;683;This makes for a real interesting twist of fate for the woman.
I:8408;684;Lots of extras including Interviews with Schwarzeneggar.
I:8408;685;if you love the BIG THEATRE this one brings it home!!!!
I:8408;686;In one of the greatest sci.
I:8408;687;fi action movies of all time, this amazing film was a breakthrough in cinematic history.
I:8408;688;"time director James Cameron became a hot property with his highly original screenplay and masterful directing in ""The Terminator."""
I:8408;689;This film is pure genius!In the year 2029, the world is rural wasteland.
I:8408;690;The human resistance, led by the brave John Connor, rallies the rest of civilization to go up against the machines.
I:8408;691;"His ""I'll be back"" line is the greatest, or one of, movie line in history."
I:8408;692;His best role ever doesn't have that many lines, but his demeanor, fiercing look and powerful screen presence makes him the perfect choice for the Terminator.
I:8408;693;Michael Biehn(Kyle) and Hamilton also give great performances whose characters onscreen can't help but love each other and fear the cybernatic organism after them.
I:8408;694;It has a good picture and new digital sound transfer, documentaries, deleted scenes, trailers and storyboards!
I:8408;695;This a good movie, but do not expect the audio to be in 5.1 dolby digital surround stereo.
I:8408;696;I'm sure most reviewers have given some background information about the storyline of Terminator Spec.
I:8408;697;I'm sure the fans of T1 are perhaps more into the original movie and like this film best of the 3 T's.
I:8408;698;The original mono has a cool sound of what seems like swords interacting with each other at the opening title.
I:8408;699;i shook my head that the experts wanted to place additional sound fx into this classic.
I:8408;700;if you've never seen the movie before, I'm sure you'll appreciate the newly.
I:8408;701;excellent script and an 80's atmosphere which doesn't feel too cheesy.
I:8408;702;There's a bit of wooden acting in places but the movie works so well that I can forgive it that.
I:8408;703;This movie is just a year younger than me, but even after all of these years, this movie still holds up today.
I:8408;704;The suspence and pacing of the film is amazing and watcing it the 30th time is just as fun as watching it the first.
I:8408;705;You gotta give credit to Arnold, he is probably the best cyborg on screen ever.
I:8408;706;this was so great, and the sequel is just as good.
I:8408;707;please make a third one!
I:8408;708;It was very entertaining and provides a baseline for the rest of the story line that is built upon.
I:8408;709;All Terminator fans must see this first to truly experience the series.
I:8408;710;Great introduction to the terminator movies.
I:8408;711;A very thought provoking concept!
I:8408;712;Brynner's obsessively determined performance was brilliant in that film.
I:8408;713;Schwarzenegger's performance is not exactly endearing but he does come across with a certain amount of misplaced aplomb, which adds to his absurdity and fascinating screen presence.
I:8408;714;Has it really been that many years since this came out!
I:8408;715;got the regular edition instead, and other customers have written that as well, i shoulda listened and gone to store and bought in person.
I:8408;716;the movie is gud and very entertaining, but not having the special features sucks.
I:8408;717;This film has, perhaps, the best scriptwriting ever for a Sci.
I:8408;718;As well, the elegantly simple opening scene is the most attention getting opening scene I've seen in my 67years.
I:8408;719;This is an adult film that appeals to childhood fantasies in all of us.
I:8408;720;orion not a household name deserves a ton of credit for givingthe best scifi movie in the 80's.
I:8408;721;wow, visually speaken this is the best looking scifi filmsince Star Wars.
I:8408;722;his casting choices of Bien, Hamilton and Arnold were right on the money as it became a huge success.
I:8408;723;But if my theory is right, then this is the best screen adaptation of the Book of Revelation ever made!
I:8408;724;My son loved the first movie and could not wait to see the rest.
I:8408;725;Thanks Amazon for keeping old movies available.
I:8408;726;Highly recommended for Arnold fans and Science Fiction fansGunner January, 2008
I:8408;727;It is THAT good, no questions asked.
I:8408;728;There is only so much you can accomplish with real live action anyways, so get over it!Honestly, the way that Arnold was able to maintain a consistent level of indifference with regards to the surrounding action was very convincing that the character he was portraying was a machine that lacked fear, emotion or pain.
I:8408;729;overall, this movie is one of the best science fiction/action masterpieces ever made, even for its time.
I:8408;730;This is the best Terminator movie in Arnold Schwarzenegger's retrospect.
I:8408;731;In the first film Arnold Schwarzenegger is the super cool.
I:8408;732;He is handsome, masculine, super.
I:8408;733;"dated"" and that she or ""it"" is a more powerful and far more effective killing machine than himself."
I:8408;734;in the end, the T.101 turned out to be the worst terminator, with the highest body count.
I:8408;735;it was interesting seeing this movie again after almost 15 years and i liked it.
I:8408;736;some interesting extras and making of films.
I:8408;737;Although Terminator 2 is definitely the best Terminator film, as many people would agree, Terminator was still a classic, defining sci.
I:8408;738;fi film that deserves worthy credit without a shadow of a doubt.
I:8408;739;The original Terminator helped in definining the sci.
I:8408;740;fi action movie industry and is, in my opinion and many other people's opinion, one of the all time best sci.
I:8408;741;ray and decided that I simply had to have this edition of it, and now I do.
I:8408;742;The Terminator is a true classic that really made Arnold famous.
I:8408;743;The movie is absolutely wonderfully made.
I:8408;744;the movie is very suspensful and absolutely brilliant thanks to Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor and Arnold Schw.
I:8408;745;when you watch this movie, remember that it's a classic and that it made Arnold famous.
I:8408;746;So, just sit back and enjoy a classic.
I:8408;747;i remember an interview with Gurdieff in which he was asked about the unavoidability of the destiny in the life of the man and Gurdieff's words still keep in my mind due his wisdom and courage.
I:8408;748;I will face the destiny and I' ll break it its neck .
I:8408;749;arnold Schwarznegger was perfect in this role adequate and calibrated for him.
I:8408;750;Linda Hamilton will be our beloved female hero.
I:8408;751;The script is filled of mesmerizing sequences and special effects.
I:8408;752;The man is the measure of all the things.
I:8408;753;ups look truly marvelous, and exhibit a depth of field and clarity that is rarely seen on a film of this age.
I:8408;754;Incredibly deep bass, active surrounds and dynamic front sound fields make for one of the best home theater experiences you can have.
I:8408;755;The gunshots are loud, bassy and crisp, exactly as they should be.
I:8408;756;This genuinely sounds like a new 5.1 track, so big props to MGM's top.
I:8408;757;It's a fun movie with plenty of thought put behind the time travel story line.
I:8408;758;we watch it with our son and now he is 28 years old.
I:8408;759;He says the Terminator is the best.
I:8408;760;"With a very imaginative plot by director James Cameron, this film and it's sequels (specially ""Terminator 2"", which in my opinioon is the best action movie EVER made), are great fun to watch."
I:8408;761;Great now I know how it all began.
I:8408;762;For those who have read other reviews by yours truly, this will be review, but I divide science fiction into three categories: true science fiction, science fantasy, and science horror.
I:8408;763;This movie will terrify you.
I:8408;764;"this movie does an excellent job with its twists and turns in the plot
I:8408;765;Schwarzenegger is excellent as the villain, and Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn turn in good performances.
I:8408;766;This successfully achieves that goal.
I:8408;767;i would recommend this movie.
I:8408;768;The Termintor was one of the most ground breaking film of it's time, it also cemented the career of Arnold Swartzeneger during generations to come.
I:8408;769;this is James Camerons work at it's finest and sets the stage for T.2Judgement Day, T.3 Rise of the Machines, and the latest Terminator Salvation.
I:8408;770;I was fortunate enough to see a new digital print of this film with a new Dolby soundtrack.
I:8408;771;The new sound rocks and is a major improvement over the Mono from before.
I:8408;772;The Technoir scene is a great example.
I:8408;773;Michael Beihn makes for a good hero and Linda Hamilton is just as good as Sarah Connor.
I:8408;774;it is quite scary in parts too.
I:8408;775;Where are the rest of the bones?The Terminator theme is very cool but the rest of Brad Fiedel's score is absolutely terrible.
I:8408;776;See the new version of this movie if you can it's a great improvement over the older print.
I:8408;777;The Terminator is by far a classic among movies even to this day and age I still enjoy watching this first movie in a set of movies that gave meaning to science fiction action movies.
I:8408;778;But back to this one this movie set the stage for all over action movies of this style, plus it gave us one of the memorable movie lines ever because of the Police station scene.
I:8408;779;Between all the car chase scenes, gun fights, things being blown up just makes the action and drama and few other elements even more enjoyable of a movie.
I:8408;780;It's well worth the money.
I:8408;781;The special features set up the second movie better.
I:8408;782;It's interesting how time travel travel is portrayed as a one person, one way trip.
I:8408;783;It is in a way optimistic.
I:8408;784;It has ben nerly 16 years since The Terminator came out, and it is still a great movie.
I:8408;785;Cameron manages to squeeze a great deal out of a miniscule budget: the special effects are good but do not overpower the story (something that almost derailed the sequel).
I:8408;786;Biehn and Hamilton are also good fleshing out the typical hero/heroine roles without needless exposition.
I:8408;787;i have never seen this film look and sound so good.
I:8408;788;good movie for its time on my 60' tv and my oppo picture and sound good but not great!but for the money cant complain
I:8408;789;The plot is simple and this is still a fan fave and a cult sci.
I:8408;790;He is from the future.
I:8408;791;he comes across three punks (Brian Thompson, Bill Paxton, Brad Rearden) that make fun of his naked appearance.
I:8408;792;also in the cast: Paul Winfield, Lance Henriksen, Rick Rossovich, Earl Boen, bess Motta, Dick Miller, Marianne Muellerieile, William Wisher Jr., Franco Columbu, David Hyde Pierce, Tony Mirelez.
I:8408;793;love the original theme score by Brian Fiedel.1984 was a good time to be living.
I:8408;794;He stood for America, he was Christian and decent and wholesome.
I:8408;795;Music and movies were fun.
I:8408;796;"Click ""enter"" for a discussion about a deleted scene with pictures."
I:8408;797;The first disc is the classic movie and the second is full of special features.
I:8408;798;other Voices is interviews with the actors and key staff, where they reflect on moments in the film and on being cast.
I:8408;799;All companies but Orion rejected the movie idea as well as other background facts make this entertaining and educational viewing.
I:8408;800;Worth watching just to see what these famous people looked like back then and very interesting too.
I:8408;801;The theatre trailers are interesting for those of us too young too remember them.
I:8408;802;T2 Ultimate Edition is also excellent.
I:8408;803;This is a good transfer.
I:8408;804;the Terminator will always stand for the concrete and steel in us all.
I:8408;805;I love the action, the characters, and just about everything about them.
I:8408;806;I'd recommend them to anyone who likes science fiction.
I:8408;807;Simply put this was Arnold's best action flick ever.
I:8408;808;The story, acting, special effects are all superb for a movie that was released in 1984.
I:8408;809;Terminator 2 was also a great movie, but moreso for the incredible (at least for 1991) special effects, and not as much for the story.
I:8408;810;The Terminator is a great movie.
I:8408;811;As far as James Cameron's mindless blockbusters go, this is one of the classic greats.
I:8408;812;Recommend to a friend that likes Arnold Schwarzenegger.
I:8408;813;Schwarzenegger is perfect as a Terminator with minimal personality and lines.
I:8408;814;Hamilton is very good in her role, and Biehn is, as always, excellent.
I:8408;815;the story is original (for Hollywood).
I:8408;816;It's also simple enough to fit in a movie.
I:8408;817;controlled future is quite good.
I:8408;818;It is believable (for those who can accept this type of story), and enough is left to the imagination that it isn't spoiled.
I:8408;819;This one is very focused.
I:8408;820;What I came to realize later is that the world is not a happy place.
I:8408;821;We have happy moments, but what really keeps us going is knowing that no matter how dark the world is now or may become, it will get better.
I:8408;822;There are many very good reviews of this film below.
I:8408;823;Yeah just another way to enhance the experience of digital video and to make everyone start their collecting all over again but still a fantastic movie.
I:8408;824;Sarah, played by Linda Hamilton, is a powerful heroine on a par with Ellen Ripley, and just as tough.
I:8408;825;Between the three of them they lift this movie up and make it something special.
I:8408;826;This is one of the best Sci.
I:8408;827;A definite Classic to have, from the first to the 3rd, superb.
I:8408;828;ray, I hope it's not a Chinese copy.
I:8408;829;Ok I recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it.
I:8408;830;It's cool to see Arnold so brutal in this movie.
I:8408;831;James Cameron has to be one of the finest Directors of our time.
I:8408;832;Thankfully the girl has a common name and lives in Los Angeles where several women exist with the same name.
I:8408;833;This eliminates many complex elements in the story, as well as some costlier special effects.
I:8408;834;It keeps grounded a little more.
I:8408;835;This movie sounds like a cheesy love story within an action movie but there is a special chemistry between the two leads and Cameron juggles them all like a professional circus performer.
I:8408;836;Reece has never known deep emotions of love, and the only women he has ever known are tough soldier types.
I:8408;837;The chemistry between Biehn and Hamilton is strong and believeable.
I:8408;838;The action scenes are intense and you always know what's going on.
I:8408;839;I would highly recommend this film.
I:8408;840;It set a standard for many other Sci Fi films, as well as gave birth to one of the greatest sequels of all time, Terminator 2, Judgement Day.
I:8408;841;known franchise that has action and science fiction combined into a blender.
I:8408;842;The first is a great start in the franchise.
I:8408;843;He eventually found the right one with Kyle and begins a battle that would continue throughout the rest of the film.
I:8408;844;The visual effects were so real, the acting was well.
I:8408;845;done, and the storyline is so convincing you would want to see it.
I:8408;846;Judgment Day is a possible candidate for best sequel (like Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, and The Dark Knight, for example), and best film in the action/science fiction genre.
I:8408;847;I was born in 1974, so I'm now old enough to remember two entire decades .
I:8408;848;hopeful, PC 1990s, it's amazing to see how dark, terrfying, and graphic many mainstream 1980s movies were.
I:8408;849;The Terminator embodies many qualities of such dark movies, and serves as a historical social record for the paranoid, technophobic, cold.
I:8408;850;it's also an awesome, balls.
I:8408;851;fi film that pretty much set the standard for action movies.
I:8408;852;this guy embodies the movie concept .
I:8408;853;Death, destiny or doom, love, and courage are all themes wrapped into this outstanding movie, which refuses to be dated or made obsolete even in the face of advanced computer CGI that flood movies made these days.
I:8408;854;action animation in this movie, but it still looks good even 18 years later.
I:8408;855;It just gets right into the action at the beginning and I love that.
I:8408;856;Not the best of the trilogy series, but still great.
I:8408;857;Time travel can be hard to comprehend but that's part of what makes this movie so good.
I:8408;858;The action is super charged and the Terminator, seemingly unstoppable because he is only a machine, appears human, and is a force to be reckoned with.
I:8408;859;Sarah has a real hard time believing Reese when he explains to her what is happening but as events continue she realizes what he is telling her is true.
I:8408;860;while this latest sequel fails on almost every level, the original continues to thrill, delight and fascinate.
I:8408;861;Linda Hamilton is fantastic and she'll always be known as the original Sarah Connor.
I:8408;862;the others are equally dynamic but its the brilliant way that director James Cameron keeps his story simple, uncluttered and just delivers a breathless race of hero and heroine trying to escape an unstoppable evil.
I:8408;863;The musical score by Brad Fiedel adds immensely to the power of the film.
I:8408;864;The final sequence of Sarah Connor riding off toward a horion filled with storm clouds gives this masterpiece the perfect ending.You sense that she knows the battle she faces and that she'll survive.
I:8408;865;audiences like me will return to the original to be really entertained and thrilled.
I:8408;866;at least we'll always have James Cameron, Arnold, Linda and Michael Biehn to keep showing us what a true masterpiece is.
I:8408;867;The special effects by such great Hollywood masters as Sam Winston (Jurassic Park,Predator,Aliens) delivers a great mechanical muscle man played with great cold qualities by Arnie, who picks up weapon after weapon, vehicle after vehicle.
I:8408;868;The music by Brad Fiedel has become a great staple for sci.
I:8408;869;I love this movie to death.
I:8408;870;Arnold was perfectly cast as a relentless killing machine.
I:8408;871;Hamilton and Binhen's story really touches me as well.
I:8408;872;This is the one that started the franchise and still entertains today!
I:8408;873;The Terminator despite being made off a low budget managed to be a very effective Sci.
I:8408;874;the Terminator is original and well directed by James Cameron in his first outing directing.
I:8408;875;In widescreen, absolutely the only way to go, the film looks great and is loaded with some really neat extras.
I:8408;876;What an excellent premise it is too.
I:8408;877;The film is best when it is in the cat and mouse mode that Arnold and Biehn are continually engaging in.
I:8408;878;in addition to a pretty darn good film, we're given two good documentaries.
I:8408;879;One of those is an informal conversation between Schwarzenegger and Cameron about how the film came to be and some of the things that went on during production.
I:8408;880;I found it interesting that before the film was made, Director Cameron was literally broke and had to rely on his mother to send him hamburger coupons.
I:8408;881;The Terminator, while fun, has never really been held up as a great film.
I:8408;882;But it is most notable for pushing Schwarzenegger into the stratosphere.
I:8408;883;Still, the crisp, clean sound and video are great, and show how a scene contained a real mixture of the two.
I:8408;884;Watch it once to enjoy the scenes (or scene snippets), and then watch it with the commentary track and find out why it was not used.
I:8408;885;This classic looks great on blu ray!
I:8408;886;This film stays with you and makes you think even while being completely entertaining action.
I:8408;887;Call me a nostalgic but I loan for the days when action movies were intelligently crafted, fun to watch and even easy to follow, the movies of John McTiernan, Walter Hill, Don Siegel and James Cameron.
I:8408;888;Even worse is that all these movies are shot with rapid cuts and quick edits, disrupting the visual flow and causing more headache and confusion than pleasure and insight.
I:8408;889;that's why watching The Terminator for the first time in five years is a breath of fresh air.
I:8408;890;But through James Cameron's skillful direction, this potential candidate for Z. grade turkey of 1984 was transformed into a stunningly well.
I:8408;891;For example, in a clever use of exposition, Cameron has Biehn tell Hamilton what is going on in the midst of a car chase.
I:8408;892;Even though it's 108 minutes, The Terminator finds the perfect balance of great action and human drama, using special effects for the sake of storytelling instead of the other way around.
I:8408;893;But the movie is also rich with character development, particularly the relationship between Hamilton and Biehn, which forms the emotional core of the movie.
I:8408;894;Hamilton is excellent as Sarah Connor, who throughout the movie undergoes a transformation from a sweet, confused innocent to a strong.
I:8408;895;willed female warrior, a recurring theme in James Cameron's work, from Aliens (1986) to Avatar (2009).
I:8408;896;Biehn is terrific as Reese, whose battles against the machines in the future have drained him of so much pain and feeling.
I:8408;897;This is Schwarzenegger's best performance, in which he uses his limitations as an actor to make the character come to life and even add doses of black humor.
I:8408;898;office hit in 1984 and launched the careers of director James Cameron and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger.
I:8408;899;the Terminator (1984) remains one of the best action movies ever made and a necessary tonic to today's soulless headbangers.
I:8408;900;ray has made it possible for moviegoers to venture through movie history and make startling discoveries.
I:8408;901;The Terminator is definitely one of those great discoveries, especially for anyone who loves the medium of movies and action movies in general.
I:8408;902;Everything's relative and, in 1984, Terminator's special effects were extraordinary.
I:8408;903;This is the magic of the Terminator: it's a human story.
I:8408;904;The action, the special effects, the camerawork, the actors.
I:8408;905;the special effects in Terminator takes a back seat to its human storyline.
I:8408;906;terminator is James Cameron's best movie.
I:8408;907;"It has the perfect atmosphere
I:8408;908;The big `70's cars in the Terminator's chase sequences are reminiscent of the big cars in The French Connection's chase sequences.
I:8408;909;Being made in the early 80's, the Special Effects, story and acting are all really good, right up there with The Running Man .
I:8408;910;The terminator is the best as a bad guy, because that makes him such a love.
I:8408;911;The terminator's nonstop chaos causes you to remain focused, and it creates a certain stamina inside of you cheering for the terminator and a special liking for the fact that he is indestructable.
I:8408;912;They set the plot well.
I:8408;913;this film has special effects that makes the battle scenes ten times more wicked, my favorite was when Arnold was on fire in mid air and punched through the windshield.
I:8408;914;, Schwarzenegger is both frightening and funny, even as he brutally destroys anyone who interferes with his mission.
I:8408;915;Hamilton and Biehn handle their roles splendidly too, with credible intensity, fear, and against.
I:8408;916;Full of dazzling special effects and far better than its buffed.
I:8408;917;fueled fun ride into the future.
I:8408;918;The TERMINATOR is a true definition of how movies should be made.
I:8408;919;a big hit of the 80's and even after 22yrs it's still enjoyed by fans worldwide today.
I:8408;920;the movie also has a great cast of stars which includes Linda Hamilton and Micheal Biehn.
I:8408;921;While lacking the superior effects and epic preachy scope of its successors, the original film serves as a taut and gritty introduction to the Terminator mythos of James Cameron.
I:8408;922;There's also the original treatment, and Cameron's artwork.
I:8408;923;A fun movie for thise with apocalyptic leanings.
I:8408;924;It comes with a very quick shipp and delievery, was quite surprised at the efficiency.
I:8408;925;an original Science Fiction/Action thriller that has became a runaway success back in 1984 and is now reguarded as a classic among the genre.
I:8408;926;"What makes it a classic is it's original storyline, the infamous ""I'll be Back"" line, great acting, perfect direction by James Cameron ( which this is his debut film) and Arnold Schwartzenger was just perfect to play the title bad guy in this movie."
I:8408;927;There are a few special features on here like deleted scenes, a short behind the scenes thing and then some hilariously dated early 90s interviews with James Cameron and Arnold.
I:8408;928;The transfer of this film is beautiful.
I:8408;929;There are 2 well made documentaries but the first thing you will want to check out are the delted scenes.
I:8408;930;oh, I like T2 well enough on its own terms, but even though it's got much higher production values than this one, it pretty much wrecks the premise on which the series is based.
I:8408;931;This first one is complete as it stands.
I:8408;932;"thrillers (admittedly a pretty narrow genre
I:8408;933;known one is _Timecop_, and it's far from consistent).
I:8408;934;there's lots of cool action, too, and even the low.
I:8408;935;budget special effects have held up well against the last twenty years of cinematography.
I:8408;936;it's still one of my favorites, and it's still every bit as watchable as it was twenty years ago.
I:8408;937;But mostly, it's just a great movie.
I:8408;938;Great movie that started something great that is until terminator 3 .
I:8408;939;it's a classic movie story that so many people remember.
I:8408;940;The Terminator is pretty intense, with guns and explosions peppered through the movie.
I:8408;941;this is a memorable film for Sarah Conner actor Linda Hamilton, who would later play the futuristic law enforcer, Robocop.
I:8408;942;And the love story is surprisingly compassionate.
I:8408;943;While we've all seen the masochistic male terrorist with weapons of mass destruction many times before, this is one of the first films in which the heavy.
I:8408;944;michael Biehn also does a splendid job as Kyle Reese, the no.
I:8408;945;of his life in the future are pretty dramatic, portraying a post.
I:8408;946;"But ""The Terminator"" was a great start, with minimalist special effects and hard."
I:8408;947;This movie Terminator more popular in the 80's my conutry in the so many people going theater.
I:8408;948;this is a sci fi gem.
I:8408;949;it is a master peice amoung movies.
I:8408;950;it is smart and it has good action.
I:8408;951;watch it and then watch it again
I:8408;952;It was a good movie that came out of nowhere.
I:8408;953;The music score by Brad Fiedel is good and sounds better in the sequel.
I:8408;954;This film helped boost Schwarzenegger's career.
I:8408;955;Arnold Schwarzenegger is superb as The Terminator.
I:8408;956;Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen are good as police officers.
I:8408;957;Bess Motta is good as Sarah's friend Ginger.
I:8408;958;The Terminator(1984) is a classic, action packed, science fiction.
I:8408;959;Micheal Biehn is great as a rebel soldier sent back in time to protect her.
I:8408;960;Schwarzenegger is great as a cyborg and this was one of his best films.
I:8408;961;I love these blu ray book editions, they are filled with info and trivia on the production of the film.
I:8408;962;The terminator gets this treatment and rightly so, a landmark film in the realm of action, sci.
I:8408;963;The improved sound of Blu Ray, the crisp video, you can't go wrong.
I:8408;964;This is the best way to see one of Schwarzenegger's earlier films since the big screen!
I:8408;965;This movie is just so great!
I:8408;966;Arnold is amazing and menacing in this film.
I:8408;967;This is the movie that started the franchise and is honestly just as good as the second Terminator.
I:8408;968;"The these are great
I:8408;969;5 Stars for originality, story, effects and action!
I:8408;970;this film capitalized on that fear and introduced us all to a new terror .
I:8408;971;the evils of machines rising up against mankind.
I:8408;972;Many other reviewers will relate every detail, but I suggest you watch the movie.
I:8408;973;Film has a dark tone that is compelling.
I:8408;974;Lots of action, weapons, and some Sci.
I:8408;975;The Terminator set the bar for Tech Noir films, and is the best of the series of three (T2 Judgement Day and T3 Rise of the Machines).
I:8408;976;Effects are awesome for the 80's.
I:8408;977;This version (special ed) is worthy of a place in your collection too, although a boxed set may be coming out with all three sometime.
I:8408;978;The first of the series with a memorable bunch of catch phrases and a great bunch of performers.
I:8408;979;The guy who plays the shrink is a riot.
I:8408;980;Arnord's first really good movie and Cameron's firs classic.
I:8408;981;linda Hamilton is a perfect choice for Sarah Conner's shoes.
I:8408;982;at the beginning of the film she is like anyone young woman,who has a job and she likes to have fun with her frieds.
I:8408;983;This film provides something for anyone: kids like to see great action, woman loves to see Sarah and Kyle's romance, man likes car driving situations and elder peolle will enjoy a fine sript.
I:8408;984;Until this day, it is still the best science fiction and action movie I have ever seen.
I:8408;985;Terminator has a very good story, not just blowing up stuff like many of the Hollywood movies these days.
I:8408;986;There are two behind the scenes feature which contain interview with the actors, director, producer and the special effect team.
I:8408;987;"With the new television season in full swing I find myself bombarded with a plethora of new shows vying for my attention, few will actually succeed in gaining it in the end
I:8408;988;Now that the new season of this show has gone on for a few episodes, I recently found myself wanting to re.
I:8408;989;watch the original movies that spawned this entertaining weekly sci.
I:8408;990;ray copies of the Terminator trilogy and had myself a thrilling, action.
I:8408;991;fiction movies when done well can be extremely entertaining pieces of cinema that on occasion become important facets of our popular culture.
I:8408;992;That is, until a little known director named James Cameron released a movie starring a former Austrian body builder that would become the first true blockbuster for both men's careers, and cement Arnold Schwarzenegger as a cinematic icon, causing his character to become one of the most quoted and recognizable characters of all time.
I:8408;993;The concept of having a cybernetic killer come back from the future to end the life of an innocent woman and her as yet unborn child was an intriguing one.
I:8408;994;"An interesting element within this movie is that the future may not be set in stone, which introduces some really interesting consequences into the story depending on what happens
I:8408;995;It was nice to see that even back in 1984, long before the recent crop of sci.
I:8408;996;fi/superhero films set against a realistic, modern day backdrop, writer/director James Cameron was smart enough to create a fairly realistic world for his characters and his far fetched idea (although it doesn't seem nearly as far fetched with today's technology) to exist within.
I:8408;997;"leading the cast for ""The Terminator"" we have Arnold Schwarzenegger, who found great success as one of Hollywood's new action heroes in films such as, ""Predator"", ""Commando"", and ""Total Recall"", and all of it was due to his star making performance in this movie."
I:8408;998;All the while you'll find yourself wondering is this possibly the future of our machines with the way A. i. is becoming more and more advanced these days.
I:8408;999;the supporting cast led by Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn was surprisingly solid, providing intriguing characters that were easily accessible, allowing for us to quickly begin rooting for their survival and ultimate success against the onslaught of the Terminator.
I:8408;1000;"Over the course of this movie we see her character run through a wide range of emotions
I:8408;1001;Linda proved in this movie that she was definitely star material, by creating such a three.
I:8408;1002;"Along with Linda, actor Michael Biehn (""Aliens"") created a very human, yet at times almost superhuman hero in Sarah's protector, Kyle Reese."
I:8408;1003;His devotion to not only his mission, but also to Sarah, was a nice twist to the character, because it made him into a much more realistic hero.
I:8408;1004;lastly, writer/director James Cameron did an excellent job of creating a visually thrilling science fiction experience with a significantly smaller budget than anything produced in movies or television today, and yet still his visuals hold up better than most from that time.
I:8408;1005;That is as much to do with the excellent work on behalf of James Cameron and his crew as it is with the talented people working with Stan Winston to create the stunning, yet sometimes frightening images of a future where machines rule over the humans with an iron fist.
I:8408;1006;"Granted there are moments within the film where it definitely shows its age, and the practical and visual effects definitely look dated
I:8408;1007;"overall, ""The Terminator"" is an excellent science fiction thrill ride that grabs you early on, and only occasionally slows down long enough for you to catch your breath before quickly rushing forward once more."
I:8408;1008;With an outstanding story, a surprising cast, and mostly solid visual effects work, this is a movie that kicked off one of the greatest sci.
I:8408;1009;fi movie series' of all time, and should definitely be on everyone's must see list!
I:8408;1010;Anyways, this movie is one of the coolest movies that I have seen.
I:8408;1011;For the year that it was made it has great special effects, better than any other movies of it's time.
I:8408;1012;I love this movie every part great movie a mustHave in every blu ray collectionI am a huge Arnold fan and he nailed this part down perfect
I:8408;1013;This movie was definitely a breakthrough movie.
I:8408;1014;It had a great story, good effects, (for an old movie,)and good acting.
I:8408;1015;I know that they are planning to make T3 and 4, and I really hope that (if any of you have played it) they refer to the game, and concentrate more on John Connors father, Reese.
I:8408;1016;I like the new soundtrack which greatly enhances the experience of watching the film.
I:8408;1017;"THE TERMINATOR has become a classic
I:8408;1018;This is the movie that made the Govenator a star.
I:8408;1019;adventure, THE TERMINATOR stands the test of time and remains a favorite in the hearts of its fans.
I:8408;1020;His performance as the merciless, unstoppable killer is chilling.
I:8408;1021;Linda Hamilton is terrific as Sarah Connor, a young woman who is stronger than she thinks and is able to overcome incalculable odds.
I:8408;1022;The special effects are excellent, especially for 1984, and they still look great today.
I:8408;1023;And I still enjoy it after all these years.
I:8408;1024;it was awsome picture and was the best movie in the 1980s a pure classic on blu.
I:8408;1025;The menu design (at least that of the British version) is very cool.
I:8408;1026;while entering Cyberdine Systems, and suddenly your TV is filled with the endoskeleton of the Terminator, constantly moving, showing its high.
I:8408;1027;scenes/who did the director think of that great story .
I:8408;1028;The movie is great, has ever been, but finally gets the treatment it deserves!
I:8408;1029;order it today, so you'll have it as soon as possible.
I:8408;1030;While this film may be the most violent of the Terminator trilogy it certainly sets the stage for the continuing story of John Conner and the Terminator.
I:8408;1031;The sound is outstanding so if you have your system hooked into a home theater system turn it up and enjoy the show.
I:8408;1032;This movie also propelled Linda Hamilton's (Beauty and the Beast tv series) career as well as Michael Biehn's (Tombstone, The Rock and The Abyss) career.
I:8408;1033;Also a little know actor Bill Paxton (Tombstone,Aliens) This movie is one of the best sci.
I:8408;1034;Not only that, one of the best movie lines ever said and parodied.
I:8408;1035;An unexpected hit for sure.
I:8408;1036;It has a good mix of story and action.
I:8408;1037;This is a fast paced, chilling and violent adventure in which the acting, characters, plot and directing just work very well together.
I:8408;1038;I was at the edge of my set the whole movie, yet I was also amused by some of the subtle humor, symbolism, and little hidden messages that the director through in.
I:8408;1039;Many people, with due right, consider T2 to be a modern classic.
I:8408;1040;disc bonanza is welcomed with open arms.
I:8408;1041;The extras are great (apart from the script drafts .
I:8408;1042;, and the package is nicely designed with a modern metallic take on the T1 poster.
I:8408;1043;There's even a great deleted scene where Michael Biehn gets all emotional about grass!
I:8408;1044;It boosted Arnie's career, and still remains one of his best performances to date.
I:8408;1045;But 5 stars it deserves, and 5 stars it gets.
I:8408;1046;Somewhat outdated, but still great!
I:8408;1047;The effects are kind of cheesy, but are still very fun to watch.
I:8408;1048;ray, with rich detail in the night scenes, good color balance in the few daytime scenes, and a killer soundtrack.
I:8408;1049;The extra clarity and sharpness of Blu.
I:8408;1050;ray make this classic even more enjoyable.
I:8408;1051;the T.101 gets terminated in the end, right under a hydraulic press.
I:8408;1052;Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast as the cold.
I:8408;1053;Though the FX weren't exactly innovative even in 1984, they're good enough to make the futuristic sets and high.
I:8408;1054;octane action scenes more than believable.
I:8408;1055;Cameron and co. scripter/producer Gale Anne Hurd created a story around a skeleton of realistic characters and some clever twists on the traditional time travel plot, which Cameron himself then molded into a masterpiece of cinematic suspense.
I:8408;1056;"be of mankind's eventual savior and her protector
I:8408;1057;The French language edition of this cult classic.You know the movie, here it is in French.
I:8408;1058;it is amusing to listen to Arnold speaking in the language of love, killing machine that he is.
I:8408;1059;"have"" and I bought it."
I:8408;1060;"famous line, ""I'll be back"" (which is actually a surprisingly less."
I:8408;1061;and it established Arnold as a serious force to be reckoned with.
I:8408;1062;And I'll be honest .
I:8408;1063;The Terminator is a movie from The Good Old Days of action films .
I:8408;1064;The best of the terminator movies you bet!!
I:8408;1065;I have always liked this one the best Arnold is great as the terminator!
I:8408;1066;James Cameron showed the world his modus operandi for the first time in this spectacular sci fi action.
I:8408;1067;the action is thrilling, heart.
I:8408;1068;Director Cameron, (Let's forgive him for Piranha 2) here shows what he can do when it comes to action, and boy, does he do it well!
I:8408;1069;This is truly one of the most explosive, thrilling and amazing sci fi action films ever made.
I:8408;1070;shredding pace of the film, production info and more.
I:8408;1071;Classic movie which is very enjoyable.
I:8408;1072;another note, terminator 3 is in production.
I:8408;1073;"With its dark vision, extraordinarily well laid out plot and ""Arny"" starring as the bad guy, this film was destined to succeed."
I:8408;1074;Not only was there an outstanding script, written and directed by James Cameron, but those starring in the film made it the success that it is and only to be matched by its sequel.
I:8408;1075;the Terminator is James Cameron's first film and arguably the best film of his career.
I:8408;1076;"While ""Conan the Barbarian"" put Arnold Schwarzenegger on the map, The Terminator put him in the dead center of the map and launched him on a streak of highly successful action movies."
I:8408;1077;It was extremely interesting to watch a couple of the Special Features and find out that James Cameron and crew were basically putting this outstanding sci.
I:8408;1078;Michael Biehn's performance as the sacrificial hero of the film is perfect!
I:8408;1079;Along with the outstanding leading cast, look at the secondary characters, to name just a couple, Lance Henriksen and Paul Winfield.
I:8408;1080;Even one of James Cameron's favorites, Bill Paxton has a small role in this extraordinary film.
I:8408;1081;Jumping forward a bit, the Terminator has made his move and Reese has stepped in to try and save Sara.
I:8408;1082;i highly recommend this outstanding science fiction classic to all who haven't seen it yet, for it is truly one of the best films in the history of the genre and well worth repeated viewings.
I:8408;1083;The movie is good, I have all three terminator movies now, all three are really good, I just felt like getting all three terminator movies
I:8408;1084;Great movie that started it all.
I:8408;1085;the terminator was and still is one I my favorite movies of Arnold's expertise of all time.
I:8408;1086;I remember seeing this movie when I was about 8,and this movie instantly got me hooked on Arnold's acting because the only movie of his tht I have seen before this is jingle all the way which was poodoo.
I:8408;1087;it is very intense thrilling movie with sharp turns and great plot.
I:8408;1088;if you like 80's action,or are an arnold freak.
I:8408;1089;this classic will give you you're money's worth!
I:8408;1090;The Terminator is one of the most important films of our time.
I:8408;1091;James Cameron is a genius.
I:8408;1092;tech special effects in the first Terminator compared to the wizardry we have today, you have to realize this is an all time great!
I:8408;1093;James gives us a gutsy female heroine (Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor) long before they became popular.
I:8408;1094;The always underrated Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese is as superb as he is darling and appealing.
I:8408;1095;And wonderful Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect as the single minded killing machine.
I:8408;1096;Arnold and James make wonderful movies together.
I:8408;1097;he takes direction very well and can physically and emotionally do exactly as the director envisions.
I:8408;1098;Arnold is just great and just keeps getting better.
I:8408;1099;When I first saw this film, I told friends I thought that was funny when Arnold said ''I'll be back.''
I:8408;1100;It is a truly captivating line.
I:8408;1101;That line became Arnold's most famous ''catch phrase''!
I:8408;1102;Yes, this movie is A#1 in my book.
I:8408;1103;exciting, frightening, riveting, romantic and unforgettable.
I:8408;1104;This one is the best of them all.
I:8408;1105;"also Recommended: Alien
I:8408;1106;You know, like Casablanca, the first Star Wars, Blair Witch and Funny Cide (the horse).
I:8408;1107;even judged by today's standards, when CGI and over the top special effects are run of the mill stuff, this 1984 film holds up very well.
I:8408;1108;The piercing, red robot eye that Arnold's Terminator reveals behind his human flesh exterior is haunting, revolting and amazing, all at the same time.
I:8408;1109;The final confrontation scene, when the Terminator has been reduced to his naked, mechanical skeleton, is also extremely well done for the time, and again, those Satanic red eyes add to the suspense and uneasiness that the viewing audience feels as they watch this machine relentlessly pursue Sarah Connor.
I:8408;1110;"And, the famous ""I'll be back"" line that leads to an incredible police station shootout is as great as ever."
I:8408;1111;Overall, it was a very satisfying experience both video and audio wise.
I:8408;1112;this is the first film in a great action series, and I highly recommend it.
I:8408;1113;It'll be a classic, for sure.
I:8408;1114;This is Arnold Schwarzenegger's best film yet.
I:8408;1115;Great acting by the entire cast.
I:8408;1116;Arnold makes a perfect villion.
I:8408;1117;This is the best of the three films.
I:8408;1118;Great film, good for anyone.
I:8408;1119;There was a lot of creativity and thought put into Terminator II, but this one has the better story.
I:8408;1120;The Terminator now acknowledges the work of Harlan Ellison, whose teleplays of Solider and Demon With a Glass Hand on Outer Limits are clearly antecedents for this tale, but in many ways Cameron's movie is a high.
I:8408;1121;Keep in mind that his previous directorial effort was Piranha Part Two: The Spawning, and from this film he moved on to Aliens.
I:8408;1122;Furthermore, it turns out the stakes are a whole lot higher than that as well.
I:8408;1123;fiction fans who enjoy a good time travel paradox narrative, whatever the problems in logic and physics.
I:8408;1124;In fact, that is true of the entire trilogy, which has ended the series without every providing a moment when the lead character and the rest of us can believe that things are going to be okay.
I:8408;1125;even though the end scene is really crappy looking (i mean it was stop motion) it was a great 80's movie.
I:8408;1126;the special edition looks really cool with the new scenes and the new 5.1 sound.
I:8408;1127;i just hope they fully restored the picture also.
I:8408;1128;Hope this review helps everyone.
I:8408;1129;Disc arrived on time and in perfect condition.
I:8408;1130;The movie looks and sounds great and i have no complaints at all.
I:8408;1131;Got it at a fair price and would definitely recommend to any and all Terminator fans.
I:8408;1132;Yes, the hero of the story speaks of how in the near distant future a nuclear war happens and wipes everything that is seen today out for good.
I:8408;1133;She had finally learned to have the guts and courage Reese had spoken to her of.
I:8408;1134;Arnold usually is a good guy.
I:8408;1135;About Arnold as a robot and has a lot of guns.
I:8408;1136;This was absolutly one of the best movies Arnold did.
I:8408;1137;I'm sure I'll watch it again.
I:8408;1138;the plot is simple, actually too simple for me.
I:8408;1139;first, you have to remember that in 1984 when this first came out, the whole gritty future.
I:8408;1140;That transformation is just amazing.
I:8408;1141;there are just so many touches in the movie that show the care that James Cameron put into the film, making it truly the 'baby' of him, Arnold and Linda.
I:8408;1142;linda Hamilton in this was always a huge role model to me and many of my friends.
I:8408;1143;But she saw what had to be done, and she gathered her strength and did it.
I:8408;1144;a great movie in its own right, and a must.
I:8408;1145;see for anyone interested in T3!
I:8408;1146;I think most of the shootouts was good.
I:8408;1147;I think most of film look sharp and detailed.
I:8408;1148;I like that the colours looked good.
I:8408;1149;I think all those explosions sounded good with clear deep bass.
I:8408;1150;All the shoouts in the present time sounded good in my opinion.
I:8408;1151;Apart from those 3 mentioned things, i think it sounds very good.
I:8408;1152;As i said earlier, the subwoofer channel is used a lot to good effect.
I:8408;1153;I really liked that the rear speakers was used a lot.
I:8408;1154;I was on the edge of my seat, biting my nails, and forgot to finish the wonderfully greasy popcorn I was so involved in fast paced action and how it was going to end.
I:8408;1155;ray transfer helps and it is still a wonderful sci.
I:8408;1156;A good thriller type of film to watch on the TV or Theatre.
I:8408;1157;The effects were very cool at the time and the robot and mechanical effects were pretty impressive.
I:8408;1158;but this one had a simple story and motivated the characters to really move.
I:8408;1159;linda Hamilton and Michael Bein were great together and the action very intense.
I:8408;1160;With the obvious exception of special effects, The Terminator is far superior to the sequel in every way, and remains James Cameron's masterpiece.
I:8408;1161;The writing, direction, and acting are all outstanding, with a sense of style being maintained throughout the entire experience.
I:8408;1162;The action sequences are truly brilliant with slow motion, foreboding music, and razor sharp editing all combining to create an original and brutal benchmark for both action and science fiction films!
I:8408;1163;I thought you could only get better with time!
I:8408;1164;There is some action with good shooting and the Infrared gun is used a lot by the Terminator.
I:8408;1165;This is a great movie so watch it.
I:8408;1166;The Terminator is thrilling, edge.
I:8408;1167;This is expanded upon in T2 but the original appeals to me more because the viewer has to do the thinking.
I:8408;1168;The colours are rich and warm, considering much of the movie is at night.
I:8408;1169;The Terminator is a violent and chilling action film with spirit and humanity.
I:8408;1170;I thought that this movie was perhaps one of the best movies of the eighties.
I:8408;1171;Arnold is great in this movie, and so is Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn.
I:8408;1172;It has a great storyline and a very intricate plot.
I:8408;1173;He is too smart for that I think.
I:8408;1174;"In spite of its low budget and sometimes cheesy visual effects, ""The Terminator"" is definitely a spectacular sci."
I:8408;1175;It has a lot of action in it.
I:8408;1176;The story and the idea are amazing.
I:8408;1177;This movie is kind of like matrix.
I:8408;1178;A wonderful modern version of the oldest of all tales.
I:8408;1179;tERMINATOR is a movie purely incredible in many ways, but the two best things in it are first the successful modern retelling of THE tale mentioned in the title, (a tale which appears at least once in all human cultures since the dawn of time) and then the unique and powerful love story.
I:8408;1180;This Dragon is a powerful and cunning monster .
I:8408;1181;Few of those who will cross his path will live to tell the tale .
I:8408;1182;and even those lucky few will be marked by its passage for ever, in their chair and in their mind.
I:8408;1183;The Princess name is Sarah Connor and she bears a strong resemblance to young Linda Hamilton.
I:8408;1184;She is absolutely not aware of her importance and being born in a very average family, she lives a rather banal life of hard labor and simple pleasures.
I:8408;1185;but in fact she is the most important woman in human history since Virgin Mary!
I:8408;1186;And if the Dragon finds her and kills her, all humanity will perish with her!Lucky for her and the whole humanity, the Dragon has been tracked and followed by the Knight (the Prince, the Paladin, the Hero, the Warrior, the Monster.
I:8408;1187;slayer, the Great Hunter, etc.) who swore to save the Princess (and therefore the whole humankind) no matter what the price, without any regard for his own safety.
I:8408;1188;And surprisingly TERMINATOR, when one looks carefully, is in fact a story about an incredible love.
I:8408;1189;And it may well be, that by this love the whole humanity will be saved .
I:8408;1190;There is the excellent camera work, great music and an incredible atmosphere of a great city (Los Angeles) at night with its game of lights and shadows .
I:8408;1191;all of which is the trade mark of great James Cameron, who signed here his first masterpiece.
I:8408;1192;There are excellent second roles of Paul Winfield, Lance Henriksen and Earl Boen.
I:8408;1193;There are action scenes which still are impressive 28 years later and which did not age at all.
I:8408;1194;i can not find any more words which could praise this movie enough, so I will stop here, inviting you with all my heart to discover this immortal tale, in which the Dragon, the Princess and the Knight will meet their respective fates.
I:8408;1195;but in the same time they will also all win (as it is explained with more detail in the less magnificent, but still very honest sequel).
I:8408;1196;James Cameron made much more than just a action Picture The Terminator is a brillent film with a very good story.
I:8408;1197;I liked this movie and its one of my favorite's there is not much more I can say except that its a good movie and I loved it.
I:8408;1198;This is a great sci.
I:8408;1199;fi and a brillent movie thanks to James Cameron.
I:8408;1200;did these scenes lol)but overall good job on special effects.
I:8408;1201;but anyways great film/an instant classic!i hope the new terminator flik is as good as 1&2.
I:8408;1202;but a nice addition to your B. ray collection.
I:8408;1203;in spite of the early CGI limitations it's the story that carries the viewer to a world imagined having taken the wrong path.
I:8408;1204;The movie is a little bit dark but nevertheless very entertaining and after the sequel I would like to see it's prequel for a change.
I:8408;1205;I hear the rumours of a Terminator III, but the first one remains the best.
I:8408;1206;released with a new score.
I:8408;1207;THe action is classic, the story is first rate, and the new sound IS GREAT!!!!!!
I:8408;1208;It's much better than the old sound it used to have.
I:8408;1209;This updated version of the classic Terminator movie is by far the best this movie's ever been.
I:8408;1210;The sound must be heard to be believed, with the remixed 5.1 digital making good use of all surround sound channels.
I:8408;1211;I brought this movie 'cause.
I:8408;1212;Anyone who has yet to see this or the franchise, well you have to start here, but remember this movie is going on 30 years old, so the effects aren't as they are now, but the movie was great for its time and the story still holds up!
I:8408;1213;A good action/SciFi movie for its time.
I:8408;1214;The Terminator stands as one of the truly great movies ever made in my books.
I:8408;1215;Like many people, I maintain a fluid list of favorite movies in my head, however, the top three spots have never changed.
I:8408;1216;James Cameron's opus will always be Aliens, but the Terminator is his second best work and his directorial debut.
I:8408;1217;This film is exquisite start to finish and a masterpiece of contrasting imagery that spans forty years between the stark, rain swept night time streets of `present day' Los Angeles in 1984, and a dark, foreboding future where mankind clings to life in a terrific struggle against the machines.
I:8408;1218;Silvery aerial and tracked hunter.
I:8408;1219;It is implied that the humans capture the facility, are able to send a protector to look after her, and make it possible for John to be born.
I:8408;1220;part of what makes this movie so perfect is the lead heroine.
I:8408;1221;Nowadays strong female characters, the Mara Jade types, are usually confrontation, arrogant, and mean.
I:8408;1222;Sarah Conner, like Aliens' Ellen Ripley, is a wonderful mix of very attractive qualities.
I:8408;1223;She is thoughtful, intelligent, and possessing of an inner strength that even she doesn't believe she has within her.
I:8408;1224;But at the same time she is depicted as lonely, which leads to a great sense of isolation when she realizes that she is next on the killer's list.
I:8408;1225;The dynamic between Hamilton and Biehn is electric.
I:8408;1226;There is real passion there, because in many ways they are the same person, just reversed.
I:8408;1227;Kyle is a warrior, with a sensitive caring soul held just beneath the surface that Sarah brings to the surface.
I:8408;1228;It's an epochal event as the Terminator finally comes face to face with her.
I:8408;1229;visually, the film is first rate.
I:8408;1230;skeletons are some of the finest moments in Science Fiction film making.
I:8408;1231;everything, the rear projected, stop motion animated Terminator effects are still very good, standing up well in the light of eighteen years of technological innovation.
I:8408;1232;One of the most popular sci.
I:8408;1233;Multiple sequels guarantee this will be bought for years to come.
I:8408;1234;nold is great in this movie about dystopic America in the first of the Terminator series.
I:8408;1235;Not as outright funny as T2 but a great movie.
I:8408;1236;Along with the improved sound the viewer can enjoy interesting deleted scenes with director commentary and also some interesting interviews.
I:8408;1237;One thing I like about this movie is it has a very good story and it's not drown out by special effects.
I:8408;1238;A must see for Sci Fi fans.
I:8408;1239;Classic, one of the best movies ever.
I:8408;1240;One of my all time favorites.
I:8408;1241;This has to be one of Arnold's best.
I:8408;1242;The Terminator is one of the greatest action sci.
I:8408;1243;It has one of the best performances of Arnold Schwarzenegger's historic carear.
I:8408;1244;in 1984 the world is safe.
I:8408;1245;He has a skin outside with a metal exo.
I:8408;1246;skeleton and he has one purpose.
I:8408;1247;She is skeptic at first but goes with Kyle.
I:8408;1248;arnold Schwarzenegger is the man in this film.
I:8408;1249;He plays it to perfection.
I:8408;1250;The whole look with the glasses and leather jackets and with Arnolds body makes one of the best bad guys ever.
I:8408;1251;Arnold really is good enough in the moive to earn an Oscar nomination.
I:8408;1252;You don't think they will ever take him down in the film, and the ending is great.
I:8408;1253;linda Hamilton is great as Sarah Connor.
I:8408;1254;This is one of the best performances of her carear as well.
I:8408;1255;the special effects are great in this movie.
I:8408;1256;James Cameron's movies have always had great special effects Terminator is no exception.
I:8408;1257;The movie is made so well.
I:8408;1258;He also needs credit for writing this masterpiece of a film.
I:8408;1259;the Terminator is one of the greatest films ever made.
I:8408;1260;It's a huge movie and especially with pop culture today.
I:8408;1261;The famous line I'll be Back is from this movie, but it's always been here.
I:8408;1262;If you haven't seen this movie you must go pick it up and watch it.
I:8408;1263;The Terminator is one of the few action science fiction movies with an interesting, well a storyline at all.
I:8408;1264;the terminator is a cyborg with human tissue around a mechanical skeleton inside it could pass as a human in a crowd, it is so powerful almost indestructable.
I:8408;1265;it's purpose to go back in time and murder the mother of it's enemy so that he would have never existed.
I:8408;1266;ray movie you always need to keep in mind what you're working with.
I:8408;1267;Sorry, I'm a huge fun and they came out with an impressive product at the time, but not all the special effects hold up well.
I:8408;1268;ray book is great packaging.
I:8408;1269;It's actually a really cool feature for collectors to have.
I:8408;1270;All in this is easily worth the money spent.
I:8408;1271;fi movie is just a treat for buffs like me.
I:8408;1272;the story is now, well known.
I:8408;1273;the film follows this wild chase with unfaltering skill giving place to high voltage anthological scenes as the irruption of The Terminator in the police station and the motorcycle pursuit.
I:8408;1274;arnold Schwarzenegger gives his best interpretation, of his early actor's career.
I:8408;1275;His stolid unflinching personification of deadly android is paramount and it will remain a trade mark for him.
I:8408;1276;Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, the fleeing girl, is very good.
I:8408;1277;"director James Cameron carved a name for himself with this ""hit"", allowing him a successful career that includes ""Aliens"" (or ""Alien 2"") and ""Titanic""."
I:8408;1278;fi and action film's fan.
I:8408;1279;This movie is one of my favorites.
I:8408;1280;The thrill of the movie keeps you on the edge.
I:8408;1281;picture is so real it felt like they made it 2 months ago.
I:8408;1282;I'll admit that I watched Terminator 2 before I saw this movie (and was rather young to see T2, lol) but this movie actually helped to explain the events of T2.
I:8408;1283;overall this is a pretty good movie which helps to kick off the Terminator saga, and in my personal opinion, the best installment in the series.
I:8408;1284;ray master, go ahead and pick this up.
I:8408;1285;I also prefer Arnie in the later movies than this one.
I:8408;1286;see Aliens and The Abyss.
I:8408;1287;The terminator has two other lines onscreen, one with the voice of a police officer overdubbed, and one with the voice of Sarah's mother overdubbed.
I:8408;1288;There are also many lines with the voice of Sarah's mother, and we learn that the terminator is actually saying them, but we don't see it.
I:8408;1289;personally, I'll always prefer the second and third movies to this, but it's still great, as it really introduced the whole story to the viewing audience.
I:8408;1290;The second and third have slightly better effects, plus the third has a female Terminator plus Arnie!
I:8408;1291;Always a must for the guys in the audience.
I:8408;1292;Once you wrap your head around the premise, the sequels are fun and exciting!
I:8408;1293;The movie Terminator throws us into a world beyond imagination, beyond our own worst fear, and its storyline grips us in its hand as we watch the fight for humanity begin.
I:8408;1294;Our survival rests in the hands of one woman, who will give birth to the one to save us, John Connor.
I:8408;1295;As the days of our future's end unfolds, we are dazzled with brilliant and chilling special effects, glimpses of a world gone dark, and the hope of survival.
I:8408;1296;The music strikes the chords of our soul, and our eyes drink in the passion and strength of two characters brought to life by talented actors.
I:8408;1297;This movie truly defines what we hunger most, which is to know what is waiting for us in the end and will we be able to save ourselves.
I:8408;1298;This was the premiere movie that thrust Arnold into the spot.
I:8408;1299;light of action film heroes.
I:8408;1300;The result is some of the best special effects you will ever see in a movie.
I:8408;1301;Action in this movie is nonstop as wellas breathtaking.
I:8408;1302;This film will keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:8408;1303;Arnold is the dominant force in this film.
I:8408;1304;This is one of the best action movies you will ever see.
I:8408;1305;great to watch with family on a relaxing afternoon.
I:8408;1306;co. actors perform awesome as well.
I:8408;1307;Terminator is the perfect sci.
I:8408;1308;It is dark, gripping, well acted, great effects, great story and timeless.

I:8408;1312;It is at times tense, funny and above all exciting.

I:8408;1319;The story gives the term Immaculate Conception an ironic and tender new meaning.
I:8408;1320;elaborate SFX of the 1991 sequel, but the effects work as it is does the job quite nicely, notably in Kyle's flashback where he and a squad blow up a walker machine and are then attacked by an aerial raider .
I:8408;1321;shades of The Empire Strikes Back and Battlestar Galactica nicely rolled in one.
I:8408;1322;there is chilling humor as well, from The Terminator's accosting of a trio of degenerates to the afforementioned I'll be back tagline to his curt dismissal of a janitor at a low.
I:8408;1323;Director James Cameron has Schwarzenegger speak in the monotone of a Cylon, albiet without the synthesized harshness, and it pays off perfectly.
I:8408;1324;This is a true classic of the sci fi genre.
I:8408;1325;a five star movie classic, That being said Warner Brothers made no attempt to clean up the print for the blu ray release.
I:8408;1326;They since have released many flicks with excellent cleaned up pictures.
I:8408;1327;Dear readers,I belive the Terminator is an amazing film.
I:8408;1328;this is a sweet movie so check it out!Michael Howell
I:8408;1329;It shows its age from the aspect of the special effects, but will forever remain a favorite movie of mine
I:8408;1330;This film is very inventive in terms of story line.
I:8408;1331;The film is expertly directed and established James Cameron as a real talent.
I:8408;1332;This movie is one of a kind.
I:8408;1333;It is certainly the type of movie a 9 year old boy would enjoy.
I:8408;1334;hi i am the terminator fans and i really enjoy this film and can not wait to see the terminator 5.
I:8408;1335;A chilling electronic score sets the tone.
I:8408;1336;One notable exception to my lukewarm attitude toward science fiction films is a 1984 James Cameron film that I consider to be one of the very best of its genre.
I:8408;1337;"The Terminator, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Michael Biehn, is a very, VERY good film indeed!Before this week, I had pretty much forgotten just how good ""The Terminator"" is."
I:8408;1338;introduced to the film recently when I received in the mail my latest order from Amazon.
I:8408;1339;this film is just as good now as it was seventeen years ago!
I:8408;1340;pounding excitement, none of its originality.
I:8408;1341;"Recently, as I watched ""The Terminator"" for the first time in perhaps ten years, I found myself once again transported to the dark world created by director/screen writer James Cameron, and brought to life by Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, and Biehn."
I:8408;1342;"The acting in ""The Terminator"" is actually pretty good."

I:8408;1345;linda Hamilton is excellent as Sarah Connor.
I:8408;1346;Her evolution from a cute, all.
I:8408;1347;michael Biehn is also very good in his role as Kyle Reese.
I:8408;1348;He delivers his lines powerfully and demonstrates a wide spectrum of on.
I:8408;1349;Like Schwarzenegger, he possesses tremendous physical acting ability.
I:8408;1350;"ish"" feel that greatly adds to the film's overall suspensefulness, tension, and excitement."
I:8408;1351;"mY VERDICT: Although it's seventeen years old now, ""The Terminator"" remains an intense, exciting film, imbued with a highly original story line, excellent special effects (at least for its day), and pretty darn good acting to boot."
I:8408;1352;fact is, it is better but NOT mountains better.
I:8408;1353;There are more special features on the 2.
I:8408;1354;bUT until then, if you wanted the best possible picture and sound of this movie, the blu ray is the way to go.
I:8408;1355;I bought this movie for about a dollar from cyberzoo, the disc was in excellent shape and played well.
I:8408;1356;I absolutely loved the movie when it originally came out in the theatres, and up till now i never realized how cheezy the special effects are.
I:8408;1357;All in all its a great movie and everyone should have this movie in their library.
I:8408;1358;Wow have films have come a long way!
I:8408;1359;"The ""Terminator"" made Arnold a superstar, James Cameron a hot product and a franchise going ito its third movie."
I:8408;1360;The visuals and special effects are a little crude, but Cameron injects a kinetic style that makes up for it.
I:8408;1361;Their cat and mouse chase is gripping, and Arnold is chillingly cold as the machine.
I:8408;1362;We also have superb action scenes, such as a car chase through a tunnel, the Terminator rampaging through a police station, and especially Resse's flashbacks to the future.
I:8408;1363;Also, Linda Hamilton is effective as Sarah, a usually timid LA girl who learns of her future, iconic like status.
I:8408;1364;this is one of the best action movies period.
I:8408;1365;The story is mythic, the acting well done and the direction top notch.
I:8408;1366;Even 20 years after its inception, this is still one of the premier action movies around.
I:8408;1367;I collect movies and most popular movies are released several times on the most popular media form.
I:8408;1368;Michael Biehn did a good job playing Kyle Reese as well.
I:8408;1369;Even though Terminator 2 is as good if not better than The Terminator, I still think this movie is one of the best!
I:8408;1370;Keep this in mind when you order.
I:8408;1371;that said, Terminator is as exciting and fantastic now as it was when it first released, and this is the closest you'll come to seeing it as it originally appeared.
I:8408;1372;The lurching endoskeleton of the terminator itself in particular looks wonderful in hi.
I:8408;1373;"def
I:8408;1374;making Terminator 2: Judgment Day, is finally going to arrive in theaters.
I:8408;1375;The original, filmed in 1984 when Schwartzenegger was still considered young and strong, was the one that actually broke all the rules of movies.
I:8408;1376;With a brilliant story and believable characters as well as a not too short yet not too long screenplay, Terminator exploded with beautiful action scenes, explosions, and gun.
I:8408;1377;The Terminator truly does not have as much action as T2 but it brims with suspense and a romance story which fuels the addictive part of the film.
I:8408;1378;And personally, I enjoyed Schwartzenegger more as a villain than as a world.
I:8408;1379;schwartzenegger along with Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn star in this original.
I:8408;1380;The machines have destroyed a large amount of humans but the humans are nonetheless winning the war because they are led by a strong and courageous leader by the name of John Connor.
I:8408;1381;When you think about it, there are only about three or four actual fight scenes in the film but to see the plans that Kyle and the Terminator plan to kill each other are brilliant.
I:8408;1382;Kyle is after all able to take pain.
I:8408;1383;This movie is a great movie with nice action, decent effects, great actors, and an excellent, although very confusing story line.
I:8408;1384;This movie is the oldest movie of James Cameron's that I know, and it is amazing.
I:8408;1385;It is probably my favorite James Cameron movie.
I:8408;1386;The Terminator has made it's mark in the realm of science fiction, and it shows.
I:8408;1387;Biehn's performance grabs me every time I see it, just as Arnold's agressive coldblooded behavior also draws my attention.
I:8408;1388;I can't even balance my checkbook )yet is still able to draw strength from her pain and loss and fight to stay alive.
I:8408;1389;Of course the special effects are better in the sequel.
I:8408;1390;The arm surgery is very impressive.
I:8408;1391;Looks pretty realistic to me.
I:8408;1392;Take these things into consideration the next time you want to take pot shots at the visual effects of the film.
I:8408;1393;They really put a lot of work into making these explosions even more memorable.
I:8408;1394;It's a very nice Easter Egg find.
I:8408;1395;ray releases, but I wanted to note that the Blu of Terminator makes for a nice companion piece with the T2 Skynet Edition, and is a good watch in its own right.
I:8408;1396;Remember that it's a 20 year.
I:8408;1397;Even saying that, the depth and clarity were nice, and the soundtrack/effects were a blast!
I:8408;1398;Initially, it sets up a complex, engaging plot in a few scenes.
I:8408;1399;It then develops the plot with the minimum of fuss, moving swiftly through a mid.
I:8408;1400;section that doesn't really pause for breath, before a striking climax and a neat, thoughtful ending.
I:8408;1401;working on a tiny, 5 million dollar budget, Cameron keeps the effects short and sweet, and with minimal publicity and no real stars, the film must have been an unexpected surprised for the people of 1984.
I:8408;1402;all in all this is a classic piece of US cinema, and should be in your collection.
I:8408;1403;This classic piece of science fiction is one of James Cameron's best works, and better than its sequel, excellent though that is.
I:8408;1404;Thus ensues one of the most compelling chase movies for a long time, with a dark plot that adds to a sense of despair and panic.
I:8408;1405;the acting is all spot on, with Hamilton being especially impressive as the ditzy waitress who suddenly has to come to terms with the fact that she holds the key to humanity's existence.
I:8408;1406;Surprisingly Arnie is also incredibly well suited to the menacing role of the terminator .
I:8408;1407;The action sets are all superb too, with some great special effects even by today's standards.
I:8408;1408;All this and there are some fantastic one.
I:8408;1409;That the movie manages to tackle a romantic subplot successfully should also be noted.
I:8408;1410;This is one of those rare movies where looking back, it is still the genre classic now as it was then.
I:8408;1411;I didn't entirely like the actor that played Kyle Reese, but I though Arnold did a great job.
I:8408;1412;this was a great movie, I personally like T2 a little more, but this is what started it all.
I:8408;1413;This review is for The Terminator: Widescreen Edition and its special features: There aren't any.
I:8408;1414;The Terminator is an impressive faced paced sci.
I:8408;1415;fi/action film that had a pretty small budget, but the enthusiasm of first time director Cameron and the cast elevated this film far above and beyond it's hokey sci.
I:8408;1416;ettes(one a few years after the films released and one many years later).
I:8408;1417;There are some cool trailers and TV spots, plus a copy of the original script.
I:8408;1418;After watching the extras I had a new appreciation for the film and realized just how far enthusiasm can take a project.
I:8408;1419;Arnold may not be a great actor(especially at this time), but his presence is certainly a big part of what makes this unstoppable cyborg work so well for this film.
I:8408;1420;Hamilton turns in a very good performance as Sarah Conner and also adds depth to this heart pumping thriller!
I:8408;1421;I would recommend it as one to add to the collection.
I:8408;1422;while I like T2 I always finds the first film better.
I:8408;1423;There is a greater sense of danger in this film.
I:8408;1424;the two Terminator films at least represent intelligent time travel films as opposed to the dire Back to the Future movies and their ilk.
I:8408;1425;It is very original and very good.
I:8408;1426;The most important thing in a action adventure movie is the story behind it.
I:8408;1427;Arnold was outstanding in this movie.
I:8408;1428;It is a great addition to a movie collection, but not as good as the rest of the franchise.
I:8408;1429;This has always been a classic Sci.
I:8408;1430;Terminator is one of the most important sci.
I:8408;1431;fi/action classics in American film history.
I:8408;1432;I am a big fan.
I:8408;1433;Terminator is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's finest movie.
I:8408;1434;Will pop this in and crank it up for great entertainment.
I:8408;1435;This is the film that cemented director James Cameron as a visionary director, and also cemented Arnold Schwarzenegger as a premier action superstar.
I:8408;1436;Imaginitive special effects and makeup are abound, and the film is action packed from beginning to end, and all the actors give superb performances, but this is mainly Arnold's show, and like I said before he is chillingly perfect.
I:8408;1437;first of, the whole context for the story.
I:8408;1438;but logic aside, lets look at the movie in closer detail.
I:8408;1439;The very first scene of the movie when the Terminator makes contact with people illustrates the physical capabilities of this cyborg.
I:8408;1440;He kicks ass, without using any guns.
I:8408;1441;Its as if a bunch of writers came together and figured out the best way to make a movie with the minimal amount of acting skill.
I:8408;1442;For the rest, lots of ducking, screaming, and faces of shock and awe.
I:8408;1443;With Arnold's career just starting to completely take off we find a movie that is worth watching over and over again.
I:8408;1444;I think this is definately one of arnold's best acting jobs because his character didn't need to show much emotion or even talk much.
I:8408;1445;Overall a great movie due to various reasons of acting, script, and good directing by James Cameron.
I:8408;1446;The colors are vibrant and brilliant, without overpowering the show, and the new Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is amazing.
I:8408;1447;I know most people proclaim Terminator 2 as the best of the trilogy.
I:8408;1448;however, my favorte will always be this little masterpiece for a couple of simple reasons:1.
I:8408;1449;The basic theme in the movie is: you cannot change the future, you can only hope to survive it.
I:8408;1450;The atmosphere in this movie is phenomenal and conveys the feeling of impending doom more clearly than the sequals.
I:8408;1451;in T3 when the T.800 gets his head knocked off and is only hanging by a few cables, we're thinking, Oh, wow.
I:8408;1452;I'll take style over photorealistic CGI any day.
I:8408;1453;i think what's so great about this movie is how you're slowly revealed the true form of the Terminator.
I:8408;1454;This original is a true sci.
I:8408;1455;fi masterpiece and is probably the best sci.
I:8408;1456;I love the terminator and the original is my favorite.
I:8408;1457;But right now in 2000's, I viewed again and I can tell this movie is indeed made 19 years ago.
I:8408;1458;My favorite part is still the car chase through Los Angeles.
I:8408;1459;The special effects can't hold a candle to the sequel, but the story is stronger here, and the characters are more easily identified with.
I:8408;1460;The John from the future sends Kyle Reese back in time to protect his mother.
I:8408;1461;arnold is perfect in his role, even though his screen time and his lines are limited, his impression is easily made.
I:8408;1462;The acting here is superb, and the mood of the relentless killing machine makes this an incredibly thrilling movie to watch.
I:8408;1463;The chase scenes are incredible, as well as the other action segments, including the ever famous police station shoot.
I:8408;1464;But along with the great action is the whole mood of this film, especially the relationship formed between Sarah and Kyle (resulting in a suprising plot twist that you'll have to watch the movie to find out).
I:8408;1465;"You connect with these two people, and feel their emotions, their fear
I:8408;1466;For years I only watched the copy I taped off of TV, when I saw this one scene after I finally bought the tape, I laughed for minutes on end).
I:8408;1467;One fine note for the younger generation tuning into this movie for the first time.
I:8408;1468;It's incredibly dated but well represented nonetheless.
I:8408;1469;this is an excellent concept for a film even though it isn't the first work of fiction to involve robots disguised as humans.
I:8408;1470;(The name of the night club, Tech Noir, suits this film's genre perfectly.)
I:8408;1471;It has a dark, dismal tone that suits the situation in which Sarah Connor finds herself quite well.
I:8408;1472;The performances of Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn are excellent and convince the viewer that the Terminator is relentless and dangerous.
I:8408;1473;Arnold Schwarzenegger gives a convincing robotic performance.
I:8408;1474;this film also has one of my favorite movie soundtracks.
I:8408;1475;Reese's reproducing with her then provides a new son who learns what will happen in the future from Sarah, preparing him to take the place of the leader of the resistance in the original timeline, which he does.
I:8408;1476;Wow, the Terminator franchise has a real knack for giving you a headache.
I:8408;1477;And this could still be his best role ever.
I:8408;1478;fi/action classic, this is it.
I:8408;1479;Speaking of which, Dick Miller is brilliant in his brief role as the ill.
I:8408;1480;My wife loved this movie, eventhought the acting seen bad now compare to then.
I:8408;1481;This is a movie that really doesn't need a review it was the first of the franchise and I loved it.
I:8408;1482;Will our future ever be safe from the rise of the machines?A wonderful storyline, a heart.
I:8408;1483;pounding score, great direction by James Cameron, and an overall grim feeling of futuristic mayhem are just a few of the aspects of The Terminator that make it a scifi classic.
I:8408;1484;Maybe we'll never really know why this is such an amazing movie.
I:8408;1485;This is the best movie because it has good acting, an awesome plot(that's not way too wacked out), and(since I'm a big 80's freak)awesome music.
I:8408;1486;I'm a big horror movie freak but this ONE action film is just outstanding!
I:8408;1487;T2 is a terrific movie also but not as good as the original.
I:8408;1488;This movie deserves a much better transfer than this.
I:8408;1489;They're kind of cheesy, but are entertaining.
I:8408;1490;the Terminator is a film that is highly coated with style, morbid moments and pure delicious destruction .
I:8408;1491;Great directing there, and just one reason I hold the first terminator close to my heart.
I:8408;1492;arnold is at the top of his game.
I:8408;1493;You can tell he's putting his all into this role (and showing it all!)
I:8408;1494;Linda Hamilton is sweet and reluctant, playing the role up to a helm.
I:8408;1495;Biehn is gorgeous and also shows us the right side of him when it counts.
I:8408;1496;There were some truly enjoyable small parts for unknowns back then, such as Bill Paxton with the blue hair, Lance Henriksen as a cop, and Dick Miller discussing home defense.
I:8408;1497;It's always true it seems.
I:8408;1498;"the eclectic score from Brad Fiedel is amazing
I:8408;1499;I classify it as horror as that's in there .
I:8408;1500;it's a great, almost seamless blend of several genres (sci.
I:8408;1501;The Terminator is now an American icon of sorts, as it should be.
I:8408;1502;The social commentary is both true and well received by yours truly.
I:8408;1503;executed in a vigorous and action.
I:8408;1504;"packed manner, ""The Terminator"" is excellent (and violent) entertainment."
I:8408;1505;Arnold Schwarzenegger gives a laconic, chilling performance.
I:8408;1506;One of the best movies with Arnold as a bad guy.
I:8408;1507;This is a must see movie and really enjoyable to watch.
I:8408;1508;There, I said it was simple!
I:8408;1509;The Terminator has become an icon, it has entered our collective memories .
I:8408;1510;become a cultural phenomenon, a cinematic urban legend with a life all it's own.
I:8408;1511;skynet is pretty well on course to achieve its goals.
I:8408;1512;and it's here that Skynet gets REALLY smart.
I:8408;1513;Through a combination of technical mastery, and financial constraints, James Cameron has crafted a 5 Star thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:8408;1514;this is a superb film, and I've enjoyed watching it again, so much better than the butchered travesty they keep showing on TV!
I:8408;1515;Although this movie is dark and has no humor in it,it is worth seeing.
I:8408;1516;It has a gripping sci.
I:8408;1517;The special effects were good at the time.
I:8408;1518;It even starts with a scene from the vicinity of Los Angeles, which you can visit in real life.
I:8408;1519;"this movie (along with ""Total Recall"") helped Arnold Schwarzenegger to enter into the genre of sci."
I:8408;1520;First you have Mr. cyborg man.
I:8408;1521;One such ability is the cyborg being able to replicate the voices of anyone.
I:8408;1522;all in all, this movie is entertaining, I'll admit, but far more entertaining if the story line is subjected to scrutiny.
I:8408;1523;A solid, fascinating time travel story, replete with action, romance, and a strange sense of the unknowable.
I:8408;1524;One of the best stories of its kind.
I:8408;1525;But I'm an optimistic and I hope one day one really intelligent director will be brave of creating a film with a male intelligent perspective of a possibility of human total destruction with no (liar, impossible) chance to the weak people.
I:8408;1526;ray disk and has all the neat things that offers, like pop up in.
I:8408;1527;over all, its an awesome movie, with lots of action and things going on, and I'm not mad that it isn't hi.
I:8408;1528;The original terminator would not say is the greatest sci.
I:8408;1529;fi movie ever but nonetheless a decent introduction to the franchise.
I:8408;1530;It is pretty interesting and the sci.
I:8408;1531;If your a fan of the terminator movies and have not seen it be sure to do so but otherwise look towards T.2, or T.3 for a more impressive sci.
I:8408;1532;Still captivating 3 decades after it came out, this movie is so good because James Cameron appears to have had complete control over the film.
I:8408;1533;not just an indie one, but a truly great one.
I:8408;1534;A good example is the two detectives.
I:8408;1535;one thing I also like about this movie is the action and excitement and appeal is based more on the relentlessness and callousness of The Terminator and the reaction of it all by the humans, than on big budget explosions, chase scenes and special effects.
I:8408;1536;They do that in the sequels but somehow it seemed more appealing in this one.
I:8408;1537;Arnold does a good job as an emotionless machine, though I find the few facial expressions he makes every now and then in the film questionable.
I:8408;1538;Linda Hamilton does a good job of playing a somewhat disorganized clutz of a woman who is suddenly thrust into this battle.
I:8408;1539;And Michael Beign is great as Reese, who doesn't play a smooth, confident soldier as would be easy, but rather take the high road as a war.
I:8408;1540;stricken soldier who's not on the brink of losing it but knows just what he's up against and what's at stake.
I:8408;1541;the script is good too.
I:8408;1542;There are many others too, ones worth devoting the time to memorize.
I:8408;1543;The actions are simple yet great as for the reasons I stated above.
I:8408;1544;I hope this helps and I hope I got all my thoughts down.
I:8408;1545;Classic movie that takes you back in time.
I:8408;1546;Classic lines, classic clothes, classic Arnold.
I:8408;1547;"I dont care who you are ""The Terminator"" is without a doubt one of the greatest science fiction films ever released."
I:8408;1548;Arnie is well cast in this blockbuster film about man vs machine.
I:8408;1549;With car chases and special effects that will leave you wanting more, Terminator is one to add to your collection.
I:8408;1550;This movie is one of the best I've ever seen.
I:8408;1551;The special effects is what makes Arnold look good.
I:8408;1552;There's action and drama all throughout the film.
I:8408;1553;michael and Linda are the best actors.
I:8408;1554;The music by Brad Fiedel is great.
I:8408;1555;this film is widescreen and has subtitles.
I:8408;1556;This film is what I call entertainment.
I:8408;1557;This is a great action film.
I:8408;1558;In fact, it's so good that it looks as if it were filmed just yesterday.
I:8408;1559;(Except for the occasional Gremlin you see in the film, LOL!)
I:8408;1560;Second of all it comes with 2 really great documentaries.
I:8408;1561;the Menu Navigation is also very cool which sort of takes you through several Cyberdyne animations.
I:8408;1562;They now have a jetliner sound, which may or maynot sound more realistic to you.
I:8408;1563;This is one of the best Sci.
I:8408;1564;If you haven't seen it before, watch it now!
I:8408;1565;What gives?On the cover of the disc, you see Arnold with the one red eye.
I:8408;1566;The Terminator character was short on dialogue but Cameron made the best of his star by providing him with one.
I:8408;1567;I suspect someday they will remaster and re.
I:8408;1568;I don't recall ever having seen this film with surround sound and it was a great experience in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound.
I:8408;1569;I don't remember watching this one before the others but it definitely has more of an intense feel compared to other terminator movies
I:8408;1570;it is nice to have a blu.
I:8408;1571;The movie, well, it's still great.
I:8408;1572;"You clearly see said ""part"" dangling and bobbing."
I:8408;1573;here's some software, a video camera, some film and the keys to the screening room.
I:8408;1574;The only reason this has two stars is because the movie itself is so good.
I:8408;1575;Otherwise, it's one star at best.
I:8408;1576;You really see it in the credits type.
I:8408;1577;The second problem is the extra features: Would you believe the Blu.
I:8408;1578;It's cheaper, the picture is just as good (or you can say the Blu.
I:8408;1579;The Terminator is one of James Cameron's most influential works.
I:8408;1580;stop action, a thrilling score, and incredible special effects all come together in harmony in this heart.
I:8408;1581;I'd recommend this to any action movie lover, and due to its bleak style and dark portrayal of its title character, the Terminator, I'd maybe even recommend this to any horror fan as well.
I:8408;1582;Butt kicking,Cyborgs, and good ole Action Movie Awesome.
I:8408;1583;In the year 2029, machines rule the world.
I:8408;1584;in this science fiction phenomenon of a film, we see screenwriter/director James Cameron at his best.
I:8408;1585;For over two decades, this movie has held its iconic position as one of the greatest sci.
I:8408;1586;He tells a story of the future, but gives a feeling of legend, of a struggle of incomprehensible proportions, a dark story that seems like there is no possibility of victory.
I:8408;1587;Throughout the film, we are treated to Brad Fiedel's perfectly.
I:8408;1588;matched soundtrack, including one of the greatest pieces of modern movie music ever recorded .
I:8408;1589;this is a movie that is highly recommended, to both sci.
I:8408;1590;it was a fast paced,thrill ride and he played his part of a cyborg killing machine,right down the middle.
I:8408;1591;henriksen would go onto star in director Cameron's Alien 2,along with Cameron`s friend Bill Paxton,who can be seen as the punk with the spiked hair outside the Griffith Observatory near the beginning.
I:8408;1592;the world of the future on 2029 Earth has machines battling humans.
I:8408;1593;the resistance learns of their plans and sends one of their own back to protect her,Kyle Reese(Biehn).
I:8408;1594;he admits that he loves Sarah and the two make love,with Reese unintentionally becoming the father of his good friend John from the future.
I:8408;1595;well written and directed by Cameron,this film not only cemented Schwarzenegger`s career but also gave Cameron`s a much needed kick in the pants also.
I:8408;1596;that is what makes it purr along so well.
I:8408;1597;schwarzenegger does a great job in his role,and if you didn`t already know,this is the film from which his famous line,that everyone to this day still copies,comes from:``I`ll be back``.
I:8408;1598;technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 1:85:1 and for its age it looks darn good.
I:8408;1599;the film moves along from beginning to end and has alot of heart stopping and thrilling moments throughout.4 solid stars.
I:8408;1600;fi creation and with the tools available they did a marvelous job.
I:8408;1601;One of the truely great sci.
I:8408;1602;This was the movie that propelled me into sci.
I:8408;1603;One of the greatest of the small time movies that maximizes its budget and is truly exciting.
I:8408;1604;The original Terminator is arguably the greatest sci.
I:8408;1605;Most of the new sounds are very cool (esp.
I:8408;1606;the HK entrance in the first scene), and the new gun effects are good for the most part.
I:8408;1607;There are two Terminator documentaries, which have cast and crew interviews and behind the scene footage of the original filming of the Terminator, very cool stuff for die hards.
I:8408;1608;Now move to the right.
I:8408;1609;Move to the right again, and another small box should now be highlighted.
I:8408;1610;This also gives access to four more interviews.
I:8408;1611;Its still a great movie regardless.
I:8408;1612;"In one of the most intelligent and unhesitating science fiction films of the 1950s, Robert Wise equipped ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" with technical marvels, chief among them the huge robot Gort."
I:8408;1613;in Stanley Kubrick's 'mythological documentary,' HAL 9000 computer is the most human character in the movie.
I:8408;1614;Both men seek the same person, a small and delicate blond woman by the name of Sarah Connor.
I:8408;1615;It is a role that suits his talent perfectly.
I:8408;1616;He is sinister in his long coat.
I:8408;1617;His whole life has been combat.
I:8408;1618;For him it is an honor, a chance to meet the legend.
I:8408;1619;'Linda Hamilton is quiet convincing as the strong innocent prey, targeted for termination, momentarily disoriented, vaguely disturbed.
I:8408;1620;cameron makes a successful move behind the lens in one of the most breathtaking modern action science fiction films.
I:8408;1621;the terminator is absolutely one of the best movies arnold schwarzenegger made in his career.
I:8408;1622;the terminator is a great film.
I:8408;1623;it has a great plot, quotable lines, good acting, and, most important of all, great action.
I:8408;1624;but oh well, it is quite impressive since this movie is from 1984 and was low budget.
I:8408;1625;this is truly a great start for a series im sure will be awesome.
I:8408;1626;this movie is quite impressive since it is a pretty smart flick, especially for an arnold schwarzenegger movie.
I:8408;1627;And the sound is great too.
I:8408;1628;A nail biter till the end of this science fiction drama.
I:8408;1629;I remember seeing this the day it came out in the theatres.
I:8408;1630;the movie is a bit old and clunky now, but it's still fun to watch and a good companion piece to T2, the sequel.
I:8408;1631;it's funny to see our governator all dressed up and playing a cyborg.
I:8408;1632;All I wanna say is that this edition is a wonderful gift for all true fans of the film.
I:8408;1633;there are 2 documentaries(the detailed discussion of the movie), still galleries,trailers, and.
I:8408;1634;(I was really surprised when I first saw them).
I:8408;1635;Considering it was filmed in 1984 and was the first movie directed by John Cameron it is terrific.
I:8408;1636;A good guy who is human also sent from the future to protect Sarah he is also John's father cause he and Sarah got XXX rated in the bedroom at their motel.
I:8408;1637;Academy Award winning director James Cameron envisionedthis sci fi classic it's reaction created something never beforeseen and set the standerd of action films to come of the 80's ,as well as many rip off's.
I:8408;1638;But I waited for this one and it's 100x better.
I:8408;1639;And, this really is the film that got Arnold going.
I:8408;1640;It has been a cult classic since it first came out.
I:8408;1641;I liked all the Terminator films but the first three with Arnold were the best for me!
I:8408;1642;the story is top notch to action and sci.
I:8408;1643;this is the best version will be able to get, great sound, good picture and a slew of extras to keep everyone happy and busy.
I:8408;1644;This is a classic movie to the point where it has become a serious cliche.
I:8408;1645;The soundtrack is seriously '80s but otherwise fine.
I:8408;1646;the effects are dated, but they work well enough for the movie because they are shot with competence and an eye towards the end result of the movie.
I:8408;1647;michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton work well together and Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast here in a rare (for him at least) villain role.
I:8408;1648;The Terminator is one of the great action movies of our time.
I:8408;1649;definition improvement of our favorite movies.
I:8408;1650;definition improved picture and sound.
I:8408;1651;"I believe George Lucas is the master of this corrupted ""bilk."
I:8408;1652;Then, improve on it, and then sell it again.
I:8408;1653;so, I hope this will be a lesson to us all.
I:8408;1654;This film truely shocked me.
I:8408;1655;First of all, the story was great.
I:8408;1656;James Cameron really does a wonderful job on any film he does.
I:8408;1657;The acting was wonderful, especially Linda Hamilton.
I:8408;1658;One of my favorite action movies.
I:8408;1659;The slip cover is very nice, I love it.
I:8408;1660;You get a very interesting Horror/sci.
I:8408;1661;This is the only time you'll see Arnold as a ruthless mo'fo but it's undeniebly an unforgettable performance.
I:8408;1662;But the humans send one of their own, a human who knows the situation.
I:8408;1663;the one thing I like about this film, is the fear it presents.
I:8408;1664;T.1000 is the best because liquid metal seemed nearly indutuctable.
I:8408;1665;This movie is one of my favorites and I should have picked it up a long time ago.
I:8408;1666;Arnold made the terminator character perfect and this movie set it self apart from other films because of him.
I:8408;1667;I was pleasantly surprised when I watched the blu ray.
I:8408;1668;Though most of the movie takes place at night, I was able to see much more detail than I had before (which is saying alot because I'm a huge Terminator fan!)
I:8408;1669;Just when you think the terminator is killed he pops up again.
I:8408;1670;fi classic and is worth watching at least once.
I:8408;1671;Lots of action from beginning to end.
I:8408;1672;If you love an action film, this is for you!Schwarzenegger was a perfect pick to play this character.
I:8408;1673;Do what I did and treat yourself to a great piece of 1980's film noir.
I:8408;1674;ray version's clarity and soundtrack is well worth every penny.
I:8408;1675;time classic movie, full of many of sci.
I:8408;1676;seriously, the final action sequence in the factory with the pnematic crusher has got to be one of the all.
I:8408;1677;time best scenes in action movies.
I:8408;1678;I watch it at least once a year.
I:8408;1679;I love you, and I always have.
I:8408;1680;Yeah, it's got the cool action thing, but it also has the love across time, I'd die for you stuff going on too.
I:8408;1681;Cameron made the right choice in making the transfer true to the original.
I:8408;1682;It is perfect the way it is.
I:8408;1683;time best flicks and definately a classic.
I:8408;1684;The movie is full of action packed battles, and a lot of cool sci.
I:8408;1685;Anyone who like Schwarzenegger will love this action.
I:8408;1686;Will she get rid of him?This movie is a number one choice for any action packed lover.
I:8408;1687;Schwarzenegger did an excellent job doing this role.
I:8408;1688;I personally think it is a great achievement in film making (especially if you consider the budgetary and other constraints) and after 28 years, it still holds his power as one of the most beloved science fiction movies.
I:8408;1689;I must say that I was pleasantly surprised to see that Blu.
I:8408;1690;ray transfer was actually quite good, if not without flaws.
I:8408;1691;There are talks about a new and better Blu.
I:8408;1692;ray edition is pretty decent (in my opinion).
I:8408;1693;It remains one of Arnolds best appearances under the brilliant writing/directing of James Cameron, who proved his protential to Hollywood with this film.
I:8408;1694;The Terminator launched the careers of it's cast and crew.
I:8408;1695;Along with the incredible action story, the films human drama is touching and true to people.
I:8408;1696;The plots conclusion with the theme of predestination paradox works perfectly with the films level pacing.
I:8408;1697;Terminator with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton is a classic.
I:8408;1698;James Cameron's The Terminator is a work of art!It has good acting,terrific story,and great direction from Cameron.
I:8408;1699;the visual effects are good for their time as well.
I:8408;1700;the weakest of the three,but still fun and enjoyable.
I:8408;1701;the sequals are great,if not better,than this one.
I:8408;1702;The Terminator is probably the best if not the best action/sci fi movie of the 1980s and is one of the franchises that's still going today.
I:8408;1703;I first seen this movie sometime after the second movie had came out to video and upon seeing the movie it was like one of the best movies I had ever seen at the time.
I:8408;1704;james Cameron did well when he went about making this franchise the way that it is with the writing and the direction that he took the movie.
I:8408;1705;The acting itself has a superb cast with it and I don't know if there's many 80s movies that have a cast like with 'The Terminator'.
I:8408;1706;world adventures that should really make you think about that computer you're typing on right now.
I:8408;1707;A wonderful film that at its heart has a well thought out story, and for the most part does not betray the fact that it was filmed 25 years ago.
I:8408;1708;the first hour is relentless action with a high degree of tension as well.
I:8408;1709;schwarzenegger was made for this role, and the idea of him being a cyborg with real flesh is entirely believable.
I:8408;1710;fi/Horror films in the 80's and early 90's.
I:8408;1711;This is a movie that will be watched for many years to come.
I:8408;1712;It is so well done I am not even sure where to start.
I:8408;1713;This is an action packed film, that keeps you on the edge of our seat.
I:8408;1714;This movie is the best scifi movie ever!
I:8408;1715;its got amazing special effects which would impress the effects of today, a 1984 classic must see film, Schwarzenegger at his best :) jim camerons best film ever with titanic a close second!!!!
I:8408;1716;:) and has the fantastic original case on the blu ray edition.
I:8408;1717;excellent special effects for the time.
I:8408;1718;good movie to watch over and over again.
I:8408;1719;ray version is crisp and clear and the soundtrack is excellent.
I:8408;1720;The menu setup is great looking and easy to navigate.
I:8408;1721;it was a little distracting at times and pulled me away from the story a bit, but overall it isn't that bad since the story is so powerful and interesting.
I:8408;1722;i would recommend this movie.
I:8408;1723;This movie is great,fun,cool and exiting.
I:8408;1724;Sarah Conner(Linda Hamilton)is a young woman who has one of the early points in her life made well.
I:8408;1725;A cyborg by the name of Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn),who,before he knows it,will be through a lot more than just protecting Sarah Conner.
I:8408;1726;The Terminator is one of the most richly executed films every made.
I:8408;1727;"The plot for ""The Terminator"" is very creative,and is skillfully and carefully brought to life by director James Cameron."
I:8408;1728;"Throughout ""The Terminator"",James Cameron cleverly tackles both science fiction and action."
I:8408;1729;His take on both science fiction and action appropriately and entertaingly represent both of the two genres,without going overboard in any way,shape,or form.
I:8408;1730;"The character chemistry in ""The Terminator"" is impeccable,and balances out ""The Terminator"" well,contributing to the goodness of the film."
I:8408;1731;"it is also worth noting that ""The Terminator"" does deliver some very strong acting."
I:8408;1732;In Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn's performances as Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese,Hamilton and Biehn make a perfect onscreen team.
I:8408;1733;Their take of the action succeeds in going along with the story,not trying to be action stars and being able to maintain the limnits.
I:8408;1734;"The chemistry in the script for ""The Terminator"" is intelligently brought to life by Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn,and keeps the heat up throughout the film."
I:8408;1735;As The Terminator,Arnie keeps one wondering what will happen next,and makes the suspense of the film both entertaining and chilling.
I:8408;1736;Add everything together,and you have the perfect film that posseses the qualities of a perfect and successful film.
I:8408;1737;The movie is always a fun time.
I:8408;1738;A great way to spend an evening with a bowl of popcorn and a classic movie.
I:8408;1739;This movie has held up well over time considering the budget it was made under.
I:8408;1740;The Dolby 5.1 sound track is superb considering the original soundtrack was a mono track.
I:8408;1741;The extras are just incredible, all 2.5 hours worth.
I:8408;1742;the Terminator is one wild and great ride to take.
I:8408;1743;the acting is great,the score is really cool,the images of the future are creepy to see and great screenplay and directing by Cameron makes The Terminator a classic adventure film to watch over and over again.
I:8408;1744;Kyle is her hardworking protector dedicated to helping her survive.
I:8408;1745;One of the most best action/SciFi movies of the 80s.
I:8408;1746;I just like watching the movies that I grew up with.
I:8408;1747;I think the movie was done and the line 'I'll be Back' is still being done.
I:8408;1748;fi action you will love this.
I:8408;1749;The version being released in the states will actually have MORE than the UK version, plus a possibility is planned to release a limited edition 3 disc set of only 30,000 copies in North America!
I:8408;1750;Great movie to watch with the guys, I waited till mine was 14 prior to me watching it with him and he loved it!
I:8408;1751;Writer/Director James Cameron's big breakthrough came in 1984 with this hard.
I:8408;1752;Still, despite its low budget, this is the best of the three Terminator films to date.
I:8408;1753;screen at the beginning of this exhilarating sci.
I:8408;1754;what makes this movie so appealing (to me at least) is the story.
I:8408;1755;executed science fiction movie with plenty of action.
I:8408;1756;schwarzenegger speaks 76 words in this movie.
I:8408;1757;however, the public was mesmerized with his part and, as they say, the rest is history,Both the special effects and background music add to each scene.
I:8408;1758;this film was not expected to be either a commercial or critical success, but it topped the box office for two weeks and helped launch the career of Cameron and solidify that of Schwarzenegger.
I:8408;1759;in conclusion, this is the movie to see if you appreciate good science fiction!!
I:8408;1760;The Terminator is one of my all time favorite movies, so when I saw it on Blu.
I:8408;1761;Judgment Day, this will certainly hold up as a must.
I:8408;1762;The Terminator is a significant film for many reasons.
I:8408;1763;"hit wonder after ""Conan the Barbarian"" (1982), and it introduced the general public to Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn."
I:8408;1764;Reese is charged with keeping Connor alive in order to preserve the timeline but that mission proves challenging as the relentless Terminator proves extremely adept at tracking down its prey.
I:8408;1765;The Terminator can be interpreted as a cautionary tale about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence, but to be honest it is better remembered as an exciting and entertaining chase film.
I:8408;1766;The energy generated by the pursuit of Sarah Connor is so intoxicating that any deep thoughts over the film's message is deferred until long after the end credits have finished.
I:8408;1767;Hamilton and Biehn are great in their parts but it is Schwarzenegger who steals the film.
I:8408;1768;He is perfectly cast and somehow manages to imbue his emotionless character with more charisma and humor than the average flesh.
I:8408;1769;The sequel is equally fantastic, (see the Special Ed.
I:8408;1770;truly a marvel of storytelling.
I:8408;1771;James Cameron proves his skills as a director and writer, in this masterpiece of 1984.
I:8408;1772;The movie itself is an original and frightening action/thriller with a dark, grainy look and an '80s feel to it.
I:8408;1773;The scene in the Technoir gives me chills.
I:8408;1774;This film made Arnold a star, and he was born to play the Terminator .
I:8408;1775;He's chilling, realistic, and scary.
I:8408;1776;It's the role he will be remembered for for years to come.
I:8408;1777;Which is a movie I really like.
I:8408;1778;I ended up liking the first Terminator more.
I:8408;1779;This is a cool movie that will play on for many years to come.
I:8408;1780;picturization of the movie is amazing.
I:8408;1781;This is one of my most favorite movie I enjoy watching it with my grandson and with my daughter we love Arnold
I:8408;1782;There are several reasons why the first Terminator was and still is better than its sequels.
I:8408;1783;first of all, even if one sees it now, 20 years after its original release it still holds its ground with particular tech.
I:8408;1784;"then it's also the ""feel"" this film has."
I:8408;1785;All the dark, industrial superbly edited scenes contribute to that feeling, and J. cameron did a memorable job creating a film that was expensive but kept you watching not because of ultra.
I:8408;1786;flashy effects, but because of an intriguing storyline, great directing, good to very good performances, and cool visuals.
I:8408;1787;speaking of the storyline, in T1 it happens to be more consistent and solid than in the following Terminator installments.
I:8408;1788;It's a solid script deserving of a classic sci.
I:8408;1789;fi film, one that puts the T1 in a pantheon of great futuristic films.
I:8408;1790;The coldness and the relentlessness of the cyborg is its trademark sign and that's what sets its unique atmosphere.
I:8408;1791;cameron kept the effects at a minimum and yet managed to give his film a dominant aura of technological.
I:8408;1792;He used more industrial visuals of the present than of the future to achieve this and he was succesful by a good margin.
I:8408;1793;It was after all one of his very best films.
I:8408;1794;the Terminator's machoism is well disguised underneath its fake skin and Arnold was a perfect cast for this role.
I:8408;1795;one of the top 20 sci.
I:8408;1796;Awesome move, one of the best action movies of all time, and the blu.
I:8408;1797;ray transfer is good, I highly recommend it on blu.
I:8408;1798;It was my first order an I'm very happy!
I:8408;1799;full of Schwrzy action and has a good story line I have all of them
I:8408;1800;uK reviews on this remaster are very enthusiastic.
I:8408;1801;(pretty good for a movie from the early 80's)Impress your friends.
I:8408;1802;give it to the Home Theater buff in your life!
I:8408;1803;wow where do i start on this one ?
I:8408;1804;to start off if your a terminator fan like i am this is the best copy your gonna find out there.
I:8408;1805;hEY what do you want from an older movie?the video was grainy but was good in some spots.
I:8408;1806;From a simple grainmill to a world spanning super computer, machines represent the pinaccle of humanity's technical capability.
I:8408;1807;But James Cameron hited the nail actually.
I:8408;1808;A humble waitress that will become from one day to the other the hope of humanity.
I:8408;1809;And know i'm holding my breath to T3, i'll hope its worth the ticket.
I:8408;1810;I won't go into further plot details, but this film grabs your attention from the opening credits to the last frame.
I:8408;1811;Even the special effects hold up well after all these years.
I:8408;1812;"The Terminator is Cameron's best film
I:8408;1813;"this movie was brilliant on so many levels, it's truly difficult to name them all
I:8408;1814;On top of that, it's a great time at the movies!
I:8408;1815;"underrated and much more entertaining than many would lead you to believe, ""The Terminator"" is one of the most innovative science."
I:8408;1816;Michael Biehn (with a superb supporting performance) plays a time.
I:8408;1817;"one of the earlier works from the great James Cameron (""Titanic"", ""Aliens""), this special effects spectacle is an entertaining roller."
I:8408;1818;coaster ride full of thrills, macabre, and good ol' Schwarzenegger fun.
I:8408;1819;, but it should be recognized for one of the best cinematic climaxes in science.
I:8408;1820;Excellent cinematography, a solid musical score, and nice performances.
I:8408;1821;Outdone by its sequel, but special and important in its own right.
I:8408;1822;fi addict, and this is Schwarzenegger at his best.
I:8408;1823;I am sure that at some point they will release another and we can only hope the video is upgraded and they pack it full of special features.
I:8408;1824;The Terminator directed by the brilliant James Cameron, is the most thought.
I:8408;1825;Good thing Hollywood made the best sequel to have ever hit the big screen to explain themselves.
I:8408;1826;this is a great Blu.
I:8408;1827;budget 80s action movie, and it comes with a good amount of special features.
I:8408;1828;The film is definately something that should be seen by sci.
I:8408;1829;fi fans, casual T2 fans, and young film makers alike.
I:8408;1830;There's also an excellent doccumentary and some other stuff, so yeah, this is a pretty packed set.
I:8408;1831;Arnold is as perfect as he ever was.
I:8408;1832;As we all know, this is the film that cemented Schwarzenegger's spot in the action.
I:8408;1833;brawn firmament, and it was well deserved.
I:8408;1834;The Terminator robots are pretty cool looking, and the fact that this film causes you to think.
I:8408;1835;I've always enjoyed this movie.
I:8408;1836;I ordered it twice from Amazon directly and both times received the original movie without the Lenticular Edition cover.
I:8408;1837;It is amazing that such a low budget movie can be so incredibly scary.
I:8408;1838;The darkness of the scene shots and Arnold's most quotable lines ever make this a fantastic movie.
I:8408;1839;The Terminator is a great movie.
I:8408;1840;I highly recommend this movie, it's an incredible one that is sure to deliver entertainment to the fullest.
I:8408;1841;This is a classic movie, it was in perfect condition and with the drone problem we face today in America, I recommend watching this classic.
I:8408;1842;B. film from the eighties that not only held up well due to an excellently realized production by cast and crew, It became a cultural hit!
I:8408;1843;great stuff, can not recommend it enough!
I:8408;1844;"When this movie was made, Arnold Schwarzeneggar was just an up and coming action/adventure star who was still best known for his body building days
I:8408;1845;"THE TERMINATOR changed all that vaulting the careers of Arnold and Cameron and making ""I'll be back"" a part of the American vernacular."
I:8408;1846;The story is strong and holds the movie together.
I:8408;1847;Also, though this is an action movie, the acting is rather well done.
I:8408;1848;A great science fiction/action film and a film that anyone who is interested in American popular culture should watch.
I:8408;1849;Blu ray is nice, clearer picture.
I:8408;1850;Not everything is blu ray worthy just because its on blu ray.
I:8408;1851;This movie is thrilling and truly kicked off the Sci.
I:8408;1852;He pretty much is the reason to see this film.
I:8408;1853;Alright, The Terminator is a classic that helped proppel Arnold S and director Cameron to fame, so I won't bother reviewing the movie because I give it 5 stars all the way, even though I prefer T2.
I:8408;1854;Nothing new except now it has a nice sleeve.
I:8408;1855;Now I bought it so my teenager enjoys what I used to enjoy.
I:8408;1856;We all love this movie and had watched the collection many times over.
I:8408;1857;Got this for such a great price on Amazon.
I:8408;1858;This is an 80s classic, sort of scared me 25 years ago when it came out and it is interesting to see all these years later.
I:8408;1859;This is an 80s classic for sure.
I:8408;1860;The soundtrack is simple but effective and great plot no crazy twists
I:8408;1861;Some people from the future, who wants change the history to save all the human's life is the best hero of the world.
I:8408;1862;This is one of the best action film of the eighties.
I:8408;1863;Even today, it holds up well.
I:8408;1864;One of Arnold's best films.
I:8408;1865;He was working the on post.
I:8408;1866;Regardless, of the inspiration Cameron's take on the material created a new subgenre within film.
I:8408;1867;the Terminator works amazingly well even when it has no reason to do so.
I:8408;1868;Cameron's understanding of moviemaking along with that of his collaborators Gale Anne Hurd (his co. writer on the final screenplay helping to flesh out Sarah Conner's character among many other things), Stan Winston (who build the Terminator exoskeletons and worked on the make up), music composer Brad Fidel and cinematographer Adam Greenberg helped create a viable action packed science fiction classic of the 80's.
I:8408;1869;while the popular sequel is a better film all around, the original has grit missing from Cameron's slicker effort.
I:8408;1870;Whatever The Terminator lacks in sophisticated visual effects, it more than makes up for in solid storytelling and a b. movie sensibility that works well.
I:8408;1871;while I like the two sequels, The Terminator established a new subgenre in film and helped spawn countless imitations.
I:8408;1872;It created a new template.
I:8408;1873;the transfer is very good although it still has quite a few analog artifacts and defects.
I:8408;1874;Still, the transfer is crisp, clean and sharp looking.
I:8408;1875;The transfer is from a new digital master from a high definition transfer (which might explain why so many flaw are evident).
I:8408;1876;Additionally, trailers, new interviews and a new documentary are included.
I:8408;1877;All in all, this version is an improvement on the very good laserdisc from 7 years ago.
I:8408;1878;fashioned devices like detail, atmosphere, and characterization.
I:8408;1879;"This is easily the rawest ""Terminator"" movie, and all the better for it."
I:8408;1880;while the screenplay is a model of tightness and efficiency, it's James Cameron's grim vision and stark direction that steal the show.
I:8408;1881;The L. a. of the 1980's is made to look pretty dark and desolate, but the post.
I:8408;1882;firing machines roaming around and human skulls littering the landscape in a very nice touch.
I:8408;1883;The Terminator is probably most notable for introducing a new entry into the pantheon of legendary movie supervillains with the role that launched Arnold Schwarzenegger into mega.
I:8408;1884;As the fearless, guiltless, pitiless twenty.
I:8408;1885;"If there's one area in which ""The Terminator"" clearly outdoes its successors, it's emotional depth."
I:8408;1886;Everything this guy says and does is intense, fuelled by the horrors that he's experienced and that he knows are coming.
I:8408;1887;The original still hits the hardest though, precisely because it relies more on writing and direction than the special.
I:8408;1888;The time travel storyline is simple here and it actually makes sense.
I:8408;1889;And speaking of the cyborg, Arnold Schwarzenegger was perfect for this role.
I:8408;1890;He's a huge, hulking mass and is intimidating to say the least.
I:8408;1891;action animation, there's some very cool scenes to drool over.
I:8408;1892;There is also some great model and old school puppet work, highlighted by the Terminator cutting into his arm and eyeball to do a few repairs.
I:8408;1893;The Terminator is one of the greats of sci.
I:8408;1894;I rate this and Alien as the two best sci.
I:8408;1895;Both will keep the you gripping the armrests.
I:8408;1896;And the android is practically indestructible.
I:8408;1897;Great use of the change.
I:8408;1898;past concept, and it comes with lots of excitement and action.
I:8408;1899;Absolutely, positively one of the best sci.
I:8408;1900;Linda Hamilton gives a stand.
I:8408;1901;This is a great movie, however blu ray shows a lower then expected resolution and it feels .
I:8408;1902;This is a great movie about two naked men from the future who chase a big.
I:8408;1903;If you haven't, you're in for a treat.
I:8408;1904;It is funny, violent, and intense.
I:8408;1905;You can clearly see all the makings of director James Cameron's future epic Titanic in his work on this film.
I:8408;1906;Good vehicle for Arnold but I really loved the story line!
I:8408;1907;It was well put together!
I:8408;1908;Great action flick for the guys and great love story for the ladies.
I:8408;1909;The studio did a superb job on the re.
I:8408;1910;Get detail and color retention as well as clarity.
I:8408;1911;Great action and story line.
I:8408;1912;I found this little bonus to be the disc's most interesting feature.
I:8408;1913;Since I'd watched the old mono 'Terminator' many many times, I was really able to hear the difference between the two sound tracks, especially when gunshots were being fired.
I:8408;1914;Just do a quick back and forth switch between the 5.1 and the mono during the police station shootout, and you'll see.
I:8408;1915;There's a few more poignant moments with Reese and Sarah, but most of the clipped moments involved Cyberdyne, the company that eventually paves the way for the Terminator's future.
I:8408;1916;the one extra feature I was hoping would be on this disc is, unfortunately, absent: a feature.
I:8408;1917;The movie, picture and specials are fantastic but I bet all will be dissappointed with the audio
I:8408;1918;I bought this movie so I could play it on my PS3 and I was blown away at how good it looks!
I:8408;1919;Even though my TV is native 720p resolution, it is capable to taking a 1080i signal and showing it.
